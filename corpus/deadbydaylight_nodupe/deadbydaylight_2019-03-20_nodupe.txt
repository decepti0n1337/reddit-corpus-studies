A silent and weaponless man, the cornerstones of the Evil Dead franchise

He will get a metal hand not chainsaw
---
Hmm i guess i havent played against her enough to truthfully judge but she has to charge before puking which gave me enough time to get behind a wall and run. The plagues ive been against havent really puked on gens pallets or vaults but thats just the people using her. I guess my first impressions are she isnt OP. definitely decent but not broken. She seems balanced so far imo but time will tell 
---
This is the most original thing I‚Äôve seen on this sub
---
You were the chosen one!!! 
---
*Fat as hell
---
I think its not so wild
---
Yea no. The survivor ran the loop he was near to get away, that‚Äôs just playing the game how you‚Äôre supposed too. OP on the other hand intentionally played sub optimally in order to get back at the survivor forbplaying the game. 
---
I'd more expect him to say Groovy.
---
You sound a little salt there bub
---
yikes that seems wayy too broken
---
In the worlds of Alice Cooper:

---
Sex, Death and *Money*, sunny, make this wicked world go round.
---
Oops I meant that it does deactivate still. I will edit it. (:
---
Who is your daddy and what does he do?
---
This is why I love Dwight‚Äôs ‚ÄúBOND‚Äù perk combo‚Äôd with the Premonition 
---
If I see them running at me and I know the boss is behind them thanks to Premonition I‚Äôm taking off as well
---
Double cool down essentially eliminates the slow you get from after vomiting. 
---
More Jane for me ü§ó
---
I‚Äôm not even going to read his rant. I can taste the salt from here.
---
Didn't they ban stuff like this in the updated EULA? 
---
What movie was this again?
---
I know I've seen this.....
---
I had to wait 10 minutes to *start* a lobby as Killer once; but otherwise it's been fine for me.
---
Did you forget Army of Darkness?
---
Following. (:
---
So who would the killer be, the rape tree or the actual house itself? 
---
I think theres alot more crutchy perks, like devour and dying light. Besides that, i dont think its too high power of a crutch as long as you can interpret what the killer runs. 
---
Also i just run small game all the time, so at 3 gens totems dont exist 
---
This isn't actually a bad move. Good idea. 
---
Yeah. Because nurse is balanced. Moris are balanced. Iridescent heads is balanced. Insta-saw is balanced. 
---
Get your head out of your ass. There's a crazy multitude of overpowered, unfun bullshit from the killer side still. 
---
Gross
---
Be gone weeb!
---
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll fire an employee with experience working on their money maker game for a single leak of content that‚Äôs probably gonna come out in a month or so. That‚Äôs totally how companies work. 
---
The Evil Dead
---
I was thinking of buying Freddy's dlc and now two associated perks pop up.
---
The Temple area is the best if you have Balanced Landing. There's a third and second floors you can jump from and loop the killers around. 
---
Here is a brief synopsis ‚Äúsaltsaltsaltsaltsalt.... but I‚Äôm not salty thought‚Äù
---
Got the same with Jane, escaped 4 times already, still no achievement.. =/
---
You need a new TV my man.
---
while u can tunnel a survivor, a competent swf will genrush and escape with 3-2 man anyways 
---
i play the exact same way, except i‚Äôm savage af and want that 4k. you can be fair and win at the same
---
time. fuck the messages lol
---
That scene with the "lie back down" was not from Evil Dead....
---
Ohh, the show is Always Sunny in Philadelphia
---
[removed]
---
a mod on this subreddit responded to someone saying that the license holder could file a DMCA if they wanted to.  Luckily this hasn't happened before but if it does, it's very serious
---
Toxic would be crying over a loss because you got outplayed or maybe holding the game hostage. Something OUTSIDE the normal play of the game.  Sure SWF groups have the advantage by using comms, but doesn‚Äôt make them toxic by working as a team. Feel free to add in which way they used these perks and items to make them toxic. From what you‚Äôve posted, only thing making them toxic is the fact they outplayed you
---
Just because you didn‚Äôt have fun and took an L doesn‚Äôt mean the others were toxic. 
---
ew, gross. Prove thyself is the only decent one...
---
When I heard about this my only thought was "Groovy..."
---
well, at least now i'll get plenty more shards and hope that the next shrine has something good
---
Yeah hence the Salt/Rant flair. It‚Äôs been a bother of mine for a long time now when people just dc within the first few minutes like come on dude 
---
So adorable. 
---
As someone who used to play casually and barely plays now, can someone explain how ruin used to work and what's changed?
---
I've had the opposite problem. Seven games, and three Myers but no plague.
---
Groovy.
---
I know I‚Äôm salty because it‚Äôs a reason to be salty over lol. I‚Äôm not denying my saltiness
---
Yeah, right. 
---
Honestly stay away from that place. It's yikes.
---
it can be nice for grouping up for swf and meeting new people in the voice chat, but i usually ignore the text chat.  Not much good has ever come from them 
---
Wasn't Wake Up! just on the shrine a few weeks ago?

---
Feng: Ugh, gotta do everything...
---
Ruin used to affect 2/3/4 survivors with 5% good skill check regression rate.
---
Now Ruin affects 4 survivors with 3%/4%/5% good skill check regression rate.
---
Even if Mcote is pissed and wants to fire the person (which I doubt) it‚Äôs not his decision. Bhvr is a full blown company with corporate officers and an hr dept that‚Äôs in charge of that stuff, not the lead designer. Plus most companies arent gonna fire a valuable employee for one fuck up since any possible damage is already done. 
---
It doesn't look like she got close enough maybe it has to be like as close as searching distance
---
I thought when they announced new match making one of the big selling points was ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never get into a lobby without 4 people‚Äù. 
---
So obviously that was a big lie because it‚Äôs honestly worse... 
---
That‚Äôs not toxic and it was 15 mins flat
---
This is enough internet for today
---
It definitely gives the survivors another objection aside from the gens and totems. It does get annoying when you are constantly getting spat on or becoming infected (idk the proper term) just by touching things/people that are affected by her toxins. But, I can only imagine how fun it is to spew vomit all over the survivors lol
---
Yessss!! I‚Äôve been longing for Ash to be in MK11 s a guest character but this‚Äôll definitely be a huge plus!! I‚Äôm a gigantic Evil Dead fan(username probably gave it away) and have been waiting for new ED content ever since the show got canned. 
---
Eat my ass Ethan
---
The graphics for my original PS4 looks super blurry now.
---
The hive mind is strong and expansive.
---
Holy shit I loved the Clock Tower games, especially the PSone version. Hiding from Scissorman in a bathroom stall or under a bed, and not knowing if he's going to impale you right through it or keep searching other rooms was like my first experience with video game horror. Left a huge impression.
---
I feel like that's be a bit hard to make, and at this point that'd be a completely different killer.
---
Good thing this game is only about repairing gens am I right?  
---
Theres a lot of things that go into grading someones performance in a match, and he completely skipped a part of it. In high level play, running a killer is just as important as holding one button in front of a gen for a few minutes.
---
His team died earlier because he took no hooks for them, and in turn couldnt save him when he got one hooked. This isnt an argument, this is the fact why he didnt double pip.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt go as far to say she needs a buff, she has add ons that help significantly, that said, I‚Äôm happy as a pig in shit though that someone else notices how weak her base ability is!     
---
    
---
In between Plague and the changes to DS I think today a lot of the survivors are.. let‚Äôs say.. out of their comfort zone lol 
---
üëèmyüëèppüëèhardüëè
---
Yes that‚Äôs the entire point doing gens ... 
---
So you combined the most frustrating offering in the game with the least fun to vs killer in the game using his most annoying addon and were shocked everyone just wanted to get out and go to the next game ASAP?
---
That‚Äôs like stomping on a wasp nest and asking why you got stung, no shit they all dcd and killed themselves on hook. 
---
Nope they explicitly said that she moves at full speed while it is charged. 
---
So was Prove Thyself I think, I remember picking it up recently. 
---
Yeah, maybe like the nurse's teleportation, where he's channeling the distance for the teleportation and valid  lockers/chests in range highlights in yellow.
---
Mettle of Man seems terrible, wouldn't being seen all the time outside that distance be bad?
---
I‚Äôve only gone up against the plague once üò¢
---
Probably tastes like salt

"Why won't you play against Legion with a Mori! It only reduces your total Survivor health states from 12 to 8, makes you unable to lose me in a chase (because I'm Legion!), I'm allowed to down you sooner (3 hits versus 4), and I've already basically won before the game even started! WHAT! Don't DC!!!"
---
All I can do is laugh.
---
Yeah, two piggies, three Myers, an instant dc before I could tell what killer it was (forgot to check power), and a legion.
---
ugh i love my vommy mommy
---
Found this glitch, if the plague downs you are cleansing yourself then she cannot pick you up. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b216mb/i_missed_the_part_where_thats_my_problem/
---
Same, i played five games and not a single plague. Weird 
---
Whore of Babylong
---
Yea it probably would be but I don't really like the way Legion is right now.   
---
I think we need a "different" killer.  It'd be cool.
---
They are only hurting themselves with the new ranking system. As long as you do your thing as survivor and rank up you will face fewer and fewer
---
So you play legion huh
---
Don't disrespect your Vom Mom like that!
---
I'm still going to get a P3 Oprah, but Ash is probably going to be my third P3 Survivor lol.
---
Dude. I have tried it 10 times and it only worked once when the killer was forever away
---
Ngl I saved Ashley on my first playthrough of Mass Effect because of her name. 
---
He still gets slower downs then any other killer, against good survivors, you won‚Äôt really be able to down them in time to stop gen rushing, and if you leave, you‚Äôve just wasted your time and once they wake up they go straight to the gen. Will this always happen? No. Freddy can do well against many survivor groups. However, his weakness lies in his ability being sub optimal most of the time, and even hindering him occasionally.
---
You just check their Steam profile and that'll tell you if they are SWF or not.
---
Not if their way of addressing issues - such as being tunnelled/farmed off hook with no means of counterplay - is based on perks, rather than basic game mechanics.
---
Besides, Enduring's actual utility is pallet play. It was later adjusted to affect DS, which was a welcome enough and good interaction when the stun timer was 5 seconds and DS a BS perk to begin with - now it however simply disables DS, a perk that is situationally tied to the user being on the receiving end of a BS game mechanic (getting downed again after being unhooked without any chance to do anything against it).  And this as a mere "side-effect" of the already very much top-tier perk that is Enduring - a perk that also has another quite ridiculous perk interaction, with Spirit Fury. (What perk do I use to counter that, by the way? The "basic premise" of perks countering perks does not apply to the majority of perks in this game.)
---
They might be "theoretical" perks. They might be discussing with the right holders to the Evil Dead liscense and creating future perks for a "Survivor" type Survivor (realize how redudant of a statement this is but I mean someone who's really tough to kill) and their respective perks. The names might be placeholders under the context of them actually getting the rights to Ash.
---
I'll try my best! &lt;3
---
I have played 7 game in a row and in every single game one or 2 people d/c themselves and with the new rank system I either depip or it's more difficult to pip in a match with a d/c.  It's starting to drive me insane.
---
Because there is nothing to improve vs legion. The only counterplay to legion is hope they‚Äôre stupid enough to run through pallets with their power activated and pray your teamates gen rush them. Legion literally clicks m2 and all skill on both sides goes out the window. 
---
Xbox also
---
I'm actually super hyped because now I can be a Chaotic Good Wraith while deranking and force Survivors to learn how to hit Ruin checks.
---
Hype!
---
Gotta play around with new DS, but at first glance just reading it, I wish it followed the timer rules that Pig Traps have. Something about being arguably punished for running a killer for more than 60s feels off. 
---
Hope it plays out better than I'm imagining though. Seems like a fun patch.

---
Dammmmmn, I forgot to try that out! But, I did try out some other things. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre interested, but you know how it says that your aura will be revealed after you‚Äôre fully healed? Well, it will only show for a few seconds. Also I know it‚Äôs quite obvious, but it is a once per match perk. (:
---
From speculation people think it's Evil Ash, since one of the perk icons looks like him wearing his skull helmet. But even then still unconfirmed.
---
Legion has zero counterplay no matter what.
---
If he is running mixtape/moonwalking, then he's a mediocre killer with zero counterplay. You might not escape, but even if you do you'll have zero fun the entire match.
---
If he isn't running mixtape/moonwalking, then he's a shit killer with zero counterplay. You probably will escape, but you'll still have zero fun the entire match.
---
Nurse's design (moves slower than survivors, blink fatigue) at least makes her technically susceptible to juking. You're not going to juke a good nurse very often, and even if you do you haven't bought yourself enough time to matter, but at least you're playing the game. You probably won't escape, but you'll have more fun losing against the nurse than you will winning against the legion.
---
Lmao I mean, vomit to your hearts content. But don‚Äôt be toxiccc. 
---
I will say, though, I do enjoy her design, her backstory and her play style. 
---
But I feel like it isn‚Äôt completely balanced and it encourages people to play like shite with her. 
---
Add Plague to the list of community-approved circumstances you can DC from. She joins 3-gen Doctor build, NOED Nurse, IR Head Huntress, Freddy + Black Box, killers using an Ebony Mori, and any Legion build whatsoever.
---
I wouldn't be dissapointed.  The more new content the better. 
---
I dont see how the killer not being able to find anyone is me playing selfish. Not much I can do to help team mates when they dont need help
---
How does BHVR always end up breaking shit?
---
The ultimate survivor main
---
For all platforms or specifically to one?
---
If only I didn't have to face plague......
---
Inb4 NoEd ClUtCh PeRk BaBy KiLlEr. Gj man. 
---
Yeah, that was my immediate impression. The only thing that would be sick is a Evil Dead hut in the Red Forest or something. No skeleton warrior killers plis
---
xD 
---
I got that and finished it in one game by being found last and getting chased around the whole map never finding a hatch. So goddamn sad. At least i got the daily done.
---
Toxic survivors be like
---
It um, did not work. I‚Äôm sorry XD 
---
It's a pretty big shame that we have to resort to being toxic back to swf instead of the devs finding ways to fix all the annoying exploit-y tactics SWFs love to use, like we're the Good Guy With A Gun, but yeah I leveled Legion purely as my nuclear option for if that **FUCKING BITCH FROM HELL NEA MAIN** joins my lobby again.
---
Nope, i  got a save with a locker stunt. you don't have to be that close to get hit as a killer. i even got a stunt when the killer past in front of the locker and was like half a meter away. they only time it fail on me was when the killer got close to the locker and immediately fall back even tho the killer was really close it failed to stunt her.
---
I agree, but let's not say the graphics were ever considered "good".
---
After the graphical adjust from this patch, most things do now. 
---
You both can eat my ass, Ethans.
---
Literally no one said that. Why do Survivor mains have such a massive persecution complex?
---
I whole heartedly agree. 
---
I like a mixture of both. Mixing it up between licensed and original is a fun way to keep us on our toes. 
---
Someone at BHVR lost their job today
---
Imo I like this
---
Oh, the irony.
---
Definitely, can't appreciate it enough
---
Legay
---
And this is the sad truth, anyone not playing nurse or high map pressure killers will derank like crazy because gens are just going to pop left and right even with the hex totems spawning away from survivors 
---
Where did the bad man touch you? 
---
I mean, I don't really think people care what you think of them. Personally, when I kill myself on hook (though I don't do it often,) it isn't to go haha at the killer or anything, it's just me sick of whatever is happening in the game and wanting to get to my next match.
---
Playing Legion with anything but Franks Mix Tape, bloodhound + deep wounds exploit is fine and I wouldn‚Äôt consider it toxic. Very annoying, but not toxic. Play whatever you like, just like the herds of survivors who used the old Decisive Strike because ‚Äúit was in the game so I may as well use it‚Äù
---
PLEASE LET THERE BE A DEADITE KILLER. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also it seems like Ash is supposed to be the mother of all distractions which...is very fitting, given how Dead By Daylight is played. 
---
Thanks!
---
&gt;No, he played the objectives
---
In an objective based game, imagine that....
---
&gt; his team died off earlier than they should have 
---
No one died, thats my entire point. The killer couldnt find people and the new rank system punished us for it.
---
Ah ok
---
No, Legion is not toxic.  Players are toxic, not characters. If you face camp and hard tunnel, or  exploit certain game mechanics, any killer can be toxic per se. 
---
Why do you like it?
---
nah my phone is old
---
I didn't think it was going to be a once a match perk, but I'm glad that it is. The wording didn't really give it away.
---
Really? mine has actually been WAYYYY better.
---
Well of course everyone is playing the new killer. That‚Äôs what happens when we get a new shiny toy to play with. 
---
1 of them is that guy, 10 of there are stalking you...
---
Again, no one on my team died. Not a single one...
---
No add ons she's pretty bad imo. Then I added two vial purge effectiveness add ons and she's at least top 5 now. Just spray them until broken. And then hit them regularly. Also make use of corrupted fountains.
---
They are coming.
---
I‚Äôve been having fun with deliverance DS too, it‚Äôs a blast. Even if it‚Äôs not the correct play, I‚Äôve been instantly unhooking and yelling ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre done when I say we‚Äôre done!‚Äù And such lol
---
The Legion is a lot like Nurse and Billy where you just have to learn how to get used to their movement. You‚Äôre not gonna learn shit if all you do is leave. It‚Äôs like throwing a tantrum and saying ‚Äúno‚Äù just because the game doesn‚Äôt go your way. I play Legion every now and then and I‚Äôve seen some pretty neat plays against me, and vice versa with me as survivor because I don‚Äôt dc. I suck it up and deal with it because I want my blood points and I don‚Äôt wanna de pip. And if I dc I‚Äôm literally screwing over everyone else in the process. Like I‚Äôm genuinely surprised there‚Äôs no other survivor mains here agreeing because literally when one or two survivors dc the other survivor‚Äôs chances of surviving go down. If they were going to fix or rework the Legion they would have done it by now but that‚Äôs the killer we got and we‚Äôre just gonna have to deal with it like how we deal with Freddy or Nurse
---
When‚Äôs David gonna get an actually cool skin :(
---
me too :( seems like they nerfed vomit so i we should just melee them and them vomit on them when down ig.. 
---
Yea, thats why i‚Äôve seen a lot of comments on youtube and facebook and over psn saying they‚Äôre gonna stop playing for a week since everyone‚Äôs playing plague, it‚Äôs understandable, lol
---
Ya, that perk is broken AF...
---
Can Corrupt Purge down if I hit them twice with it though as I‚Äôm sure I did a Laurie earlier and it didn‚Äôt down her, two separate spews btw.
---
I will not tolerate any thicc boi disrespect
---
Guess again [https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Qzn9VL](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Qzn9VL)

The instaheal is pretty dumb. Other than that shes pretty solid. 
---
Disclaimer: This is my opinion. I do not claim to be the knower of all things dbd.
---
Same here. Xbox has been extremely smooth 
---
great video shame it barely got any attention on this sub 
---
Yeah I can get that. I‚Äôm just mainly referring to when it happens at the way beginning of the game before any gens can even get done! It‚Äôs a waste of an offering and add ons honestly. 
---
Everyone's playing the brand new content in the game üòÆ 
---
You know, other player actually wanted to play for fun.
---
&gt; The names might be placeholders under the context of them actually getting the rights to Ash.
---
Notta, that's not how placeholders usually work, specifically because of stuff like this happening.
---
If they were placeholders while under the context of getting Ash, they'd be stuff like Groovy_man, S_Mart worker, Cabin_Man, or even Guy_With_The_Gun; something that represents them but isn't explicitly them.
---
Because while Raimi/Cambell themselves are pretty chill about it, explicitly labeling a placeholder model something like Predator without having the rights to it and that leaking out will absolutely get you sued by big suits who think you weren't going to ask for permission.

And yet its true lmao
---
Not enjoying her at all might submit a refund request as personally I hate her. Worst killer by far
---
A dedite would be awesome 
---
im just stupid
---
Definitely sucks for them. Finding out what the perks are going to be for the next chapter is a huge part of the hype train. Either way I'm still excited. But I also thought we were getting Jeepers Creepers. 
---
I‚Äôm convinced I may get back to rank 20 after this month 
---
They don't "have" to do anything. They've already said they don't see NOED and DS as equals. And besides, they already said they are happy with NOED atm.
---
On Ps4 
---
I'd assume so: I've gotten two 4ks as Plague with her 3 teachables today and didn't get the achievement, so I'm pretty sure it's busted.

---
I've found that this happens every time a new killer comes out with new spirit players being the absolute worst offender.
---
Agreed. While I don't hate legion like a lot of people seem to, I do find their power terribly boring. I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aiotny/legion_ability_rework_idea/) a while ago with my own suggestion on how to rework their power into one that more better suits the legion and their lore.
---
After this updates, ps4 stuck on loading screen 
---
I'll be surprised if we close out the year without Pennywise coming into the game. We've already had original killers with Licensed Killers (Hillbilly and Leatherface) so The Clown is no issue and the second part of IT comes out this year as well.
---
Worst killer by far? Yeah, no.
---
Yes it can, did it multiple times in my last few games.
---
She‚Äôs like C Tier at best, nowhere near as good as Billy, Nurse, Spirit or even Clown.
---
Yep this is just how it is now. I will forever no more be r1 survivor as I'm eternally trapped in r8 cause no matter what I do I cant pip, nor do I de pip.
---
What a bummer. 
---
It‚Äôd be more about deception than hiding. Base power could be like appearing as generic survivor w/ or w/o a terror radius then like an add on where you could appear as an injured survivor, someone goes to heal you and BAM. Or one where you could interact with a gen to make it look like you‚Äôre working on it. One where you‚Äôd look like one of the other survivors, cosmetics and all. 
---
You‚Äôd hear the killer close by and then all of a sudden a survivor runs up by you and you don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre being chased or they‚Äôre the actual killer. That shit would stress me out and be super unsettling. 
---
But actually implanting it in a game wouldn‚Äôt work because of swf and it would only be effective with 3-4 survivors left. 1 left would totally nerf it. 
---
Unless you're talking about a dev stream, no where in the notes does it say full speed
---
I'm on PC. I heard console got better and PC got worse :( 
---
I think a good trick is puking as much as possible

I‚Äôm pretty sure, not entirely, that either works or doesn‚Äôt as soon as you jump out of the locker, depending on where the killer is at that time, so if they are close when you jump out, you will go into the head on animation and stun wherever they end up
---
True but still I don't know. All I'm saying is that we shouldn't automatically assume it as be-all end-all fact that it'll be included in the game. Nothing is 100% until it's confirmed.
---
But yeah this is pretty goddamn likely lmao.
---
Holly Shit Lmao
---
This particular meme killed Uncle Ben, too
---
Clown is pretty terrible, almost freddy level. How can she be worse than that? she has a rabnged attack that damages survivors
---
He just plays a lot better than her to me? /:
---
Yeah puking and camping is dumb lol. I did a little spit up and then went to find other survivors, the proper way haha. She's pretty easy to abuse though, especially if she gets the corrupted puke which does damage. Will be interesting. 
---
Name a killer playstyle that doesn't allow it 
---
Wait till you see, that permanent looping for 4 gens and unhooking 2-3 people will also give you punishment for not doing objectives. This new system is a bit fucked up
---
Shut up Linda.
---
Your drawing's adorable, She looks so surprised that she's there, and is just adorable. Spirit is a shit killer to play against IMO but she's adorable
---
Nurse takes skill, billy can be looped, legion is neither of those things. 
---
&gt;The killer was playing with a handicap for 95% of the match, only using three perks. You might not have even lived until NOED's activation if the killer had taken a perk that would have been relevant for the whole match.
---
\^This. If you take the other point about 4x Survivors vs 1x Killer, that's 16 perks vs 3. Killer also running Ruin to have any attempt at slowing the game down, and did Ruin get cleansed within the first 2 minutes as it quite often does? That's 2 perks vs 16 for 75% of the game.  
---
For me, I run NOED on many killers because with the majority of killers (particularly slower non-meta killers) I simply cannot get shit done quick enough to prevent all 5 gens being popped. Is it because I'm not that good? Probably. I've been a R1 killer for three seasons now and I completely put that down to playing Legion, because he's fast enough to not need NOED.
---
I can understand your frustration, but chances are if you've played well enough to get all 5 gens done, there's a good chance you're safety/pipping. I've been getting 3 kills in games tonight and only safety pipping with the pipping changes. And with how quick the exit gates can be opened, getting NOED on one survivor is all a killer has time for anyway. If a teammate is knocked down by NOED, the others survivors rush the doors and are gone by the time the killer has finished hooking. It's already been said many times, but the best way to counter NOED is to actually play around it, even if it means leaving a man behind.
---
But I could forgive all that, if it weren't for the attitude of some survivors (not all, and I'm not accusing the OP of the same) at seeing NOED in game. The amount of times I've been screamed at post-game for running NOED by a Dead Hard/Adrenaline/Self Care/D-Strike opponent is fucking infuriating. Sorry, but you don't get to complain at me using a meta perk if you're doing the absolute same thing. Use them by all means, by don't complain at me for mine.
---
Finally, just because Freddy is one of my favourite killers despite being complete trash, let's not forget about Adrenaline. You want to talk about a massive advantage in the end game, let's talk about the perk that :
---
* is an insta-heal
---
* a speed boost that ignores exhaustion
---
* applies after an unhook/dropped by the killer if unavailable at the time of activation
---
* wakes up sleeping survivors and still heals (Freddy)
---
As far as I can tell, it does not cure madness or sickness or get you out of a bear trap, deep wound only heals to injured and broken survivors don't heal, they only get the speed bonus. But the Freddy counter is the absolute worst. So yeah, I'll keep running NOED so long as I see 50% of survivors running Adrenaline thanks.
---
I was able to get the Jane one on my first attempt and they one for completing the gen and escaping the temple. 
---
Too late, all the other killers just feel wrong
---
r/raimimemes
---
She immediately regretted that decision haha
---
You‚Äôre purple, when you hit red as a survivor give us an update on a few of your games. 20K = safety lol.
---
The graphics do look a little worse on Xbox as well but I‚Äôm noticing the frames are miles higher than before the update
---
Oh so I'm just really unlucky
---
some killers are better than others. theyre different, which is what makes it interesting. i hate the nurse because of her slowness and power, and i like the wraith because of his speed and power.
---
Sorry to hear that man, but it's about time us console players didn't have to play a game that looked like a goddamn Google Slideshow.
---
I would've let her have it too, but the flashlight sealed the deal xD
---
Vega is that you?
---
Yes it work
---
üòç
---
I think this will likely just be a paragraph that will be between this chapter and the next. If I had to guess, I‚Äôd say we‚Äôll get it in a month or so after some testing on the mid chapter ptb? Idk if it‚Äôs worth testing now with the leaks tho lol. 
---
I just finished my first game with her and thought she was moving so slowly with purge vs what I'd seen from PTB uploads, glad it isn't just me.  
---
Felt pretty dumb chasing with the power, I thought I was doing something wrong (other than probably playing her wrong).
---
Damn, you beat me to it.
---
No Self Care, you say? *hmmmmm*
---
*cries in cloaked wraith getting "lockered"*
---
F
---
You can see all 3 perks on PS4 on KYF xD
---
Dunno what rank you are, but since the update everyone's been a slug at least once in a game for me. It catches flak but I'm playing with literally 1 perk while I try to level plague 
---
It has happened before, wasn't a big deal then still isn't. Obviously it's great to finally get another licensed DLC which in my opinion is the most exciting thing when bhvr announces new stuff. I hope people don't get overly excited (yet) and dwell on it it too much considering the new dlc just came out and is in fact a pretty good one at that with an awesome designed survivor and very unique and fun killer.
---
being honest id fucking buy this on all platforms
---
Thank ya very much ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
chainsaw boy &gt; thicc momma
---
I'm pretty sure they come out on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Not sure specifically when or which ones though. 
---
This gave me a good chuckle thank you.
---
yes! that's awesome news. i mean i guess it's possible some of them are still broken though, but here's hoping the folks that reported that simply did something wrong. for example, maybe using any offering or item means it won't count to do the Jane escape or Plague merciless kill one. i noticed before that killers get those trophies simply for there being no survivors, whether quitters, bleed out, whatever, even if it doesnt say 'merciless victory'. but maybe for Plague they fixed it to be where it must actually say 'merciless'.
---
Bhvr take this. I want 4K DBD
---
It sucks this most likely ruined their reveal but I am so beyond thrilled for Ash. He‚Äôll probably be my new main.
---
Or older Ash from Ash vs Evil Dead with his new robotic hand
---
I guess it would be the deadite version of his sister or girlfriend? Maybe he‚Äôll be alone like Bill and Leatherface.
---
Thank you!
---
Not really, when we have a killer who can phase through the map, someone who literally rides a chainsaw like it's a damn motorcycle and Myers who can mori people no hook needed (that build takes time and build up but it's an example) freddy has been left to dry and wont ever recieve a decent buff 
---
Same here on PS4.
---
Also I have one of my buttons remapped to the left on my Dpad for self care and repairing and everywhere I go on the bottom of my screen it shows the button tooltip and says "undefined"
---
I‚Äôm guessing tomorrow. Cosmetics do come out on Wednesday a lot. 
---
Very
---

---
whoa 2edgy4me
---
like frank once said:
---
"gg 2 ez git gud"
---
Look at that human hair lace front she got on... she snapped. 
---
Cryptic.
---
Do not rely on looping then. There are enough pallets on the map not to abuse every single one for hours.
---
So what if he slugged and camped? get over it. You're the one who messaged him after the match AND you came to reddit to complain about what he said
---
Early April fools joke perhaps?
---
I just got her Adept achievement and I‚Äôm now running her with BBQ 2, Ruin, her other gen one and Thrill of the Hunt. See how I do now :‚ÄôL 
---
You mean thicc poppa?
---
lol why do all these killers ALWAYS think they're amazing for the shittiest tactics like it's hard to do lmao
---
Guess it was *left behind.*
---
*Checks date, realizes it's not April yet and not a cruel April fools joke. Smiles with immense joy.
---
Fuckkkk yesssss Evil Dead Survivor holy shit I'm beyond excited for this, might be an oopsie from them but honestly it will just build hype, and given Evil Dead's cult status it will probs bring in some new attention to the game. 
---
Self care isn't even that good lul.
---
Does it also work with doctor madness?
---
The real question. Does he get to use his boomstick?
---
Haha, nice feedback. 
---
If there‚Äôs no instaheal, then only idiots would use the fountains. Why would survivors grant the killer a crazy power just to heal sickness only? Instaheal is necessary.
---
I mean, it seems like he's just fucking around with op for being salty and messaging him after the match 
---
"They're the same picture."
---
I can fucking hear his laugh every time I see his face
---
i got both gens. none of my teammates were doing anything but getting downed. sadly.
---
didnt know getting hatch takes skill
---
To be fair, a few weeks prior is totally different than the day the previous expansion came out.
---
Cote made me crack up
---
Killer would be which ever dev fucked up so hard and leaked this. They got banished to the fucking entity‚Äôs realm.
---
im saying as, i did both gens, tried to run the killer for as long as it takes for my teammates to recover and go back to them. i did. but however my teammates decided to just run to the pallet and stand there and get mind gamed. 
---
I dont think they like the new changes to DS
---
The Bing Bong Boi is so misunderstood...
---
Shortest rant ever.
---
Use the fountains to get rid of sickness. It should make you go to injured, not healthy.
---
Yeah, new DS is just crap if the killer simply downs you and waits for the timer to end. 
---
Good.
---
Not many I get a bit salty especially after several matches in a row like this. I play a lot of solo so not much counter play to this. Lost count how many time though I see a camper/tunnel and my 3 teammates just keep trading hooks and chases while I end up doing 2-4 gens and getting out though.
---
Its the messaging him though its exactly what a lot of them want. Starve the trolls don't feed them don't message them don't DC.
---
The DBD community seems to attract toxic players like most competitive games. Sometimes campers are new players who don't know better but more times they just want your reaction.
---
I agree. Chaser especially is a huge issue for my main. 
---
Same thing happens for borrowed time
---
brother
---
P4 pig vs those hybrid demogorgon survivors around that fire 
---
I get that video games are super important, so I won't say: "It's just a game."
---
But like, what I'm getting is that your team did poorly and the killer took advantage of that. Seems like you should be messaging them for getting killed in the first place.
---
K den.
---
Ah, np.
---
Why would you say something so controversial, yet so brave?
---
If anything, old Ash tries to tuck his gut up in so I‚Äôm expecting a chubbier Ace but not as chubby as our boy Metal Jesus.
---
i agree. as a solo survivor it sucks. before this game i had 2 games just like this. time to switch to killer. though im rank 1, so dont know how that‚Äôll be.
---
Not to mention. We literally just got a new killer
---
Holy shit, dude. I din't see it either.
---
I was lag-spiked, hooked, and chainsaw-rev hard camped by a Hillbilly in my 2nd game of the day &gt;.&gt;
---
I just think they‚Äôre neat
---
lmao honestly. and i did, i said they shouldnt have been hovering around each other and did gens. 
---
I've had a lot of killers DC against me and a lot of survivors DC and screw me over. Plague can be looped easily, her base kit doesn't really help her if the survivor is good at looping.
---
Uh, Clown? Bubba thicc but there are better options. He makes it up in personality.

Nurse can blink to weird places on Lery's. Haven't tested other maps but I have a feeling that they're all broken.
---
I'm still learning what works best for me as Plague on PS4, I may get 1-2 kills because I don't have her best addons yet.. Hell I'm just having fun puking on people, especially tbaggers. I feel like she's fun! 
---
love this comment
---
I didn't get to play against a Plague all night :'( Just Billies, Doctors, and a Nurse
---
It's as if hes playing without thumbs 
---
I agree https://youtu.be/9QhYieJ7Zog
---
Or her waist trainer on to tight
---
Honestly its cause her purge with corruption is just stupidly overpowered. Its almost to impossible to dodge. Its strong enough by eventually making people broken, it doesnt need to also do damage.
---

Chromatic aberration really made him look terrifying.

My money is ready BHVR.
---
How is that more dumb than spending a half hour doing a stand off rather than getting into a new lobby?
---
*Laughs in Legion with Iron Maiden*
---
owo
---
Corruption is flat damage tho, it‚Äôs not going to taint others, and can be healed quickly. Plus it relies mostly on you already infecting people and wells being corrupted, and it‚Äôs easy to run out. Purge however needs to build up so relies on survs waiting on pallets or running to the open. A solid looper takes more time and by then they‚Äôre team should already be doing work. She‚Äôs a lot weaker than people are willing to admit tbh.
---
Maybe I'm confusing it with pallet stun in my memory, need to check it out
---
Raimi-fications
---
Don‚Äôt listen to this dipshit bro. An emblem called ‚Äúevader‚Äù punishing you for eveading the killer is fucking dumb. 
---
The remake of Evil Dead is also one of the best remakes and doesn't try to step on the toes of the original.
---
Haven't noticed this myself. Though I am noticing how buggy playing killer has become. It's super leggy walking around as killer. Plus the other bugs like the pallet when you put it down and slide away. This game feels unplayable atm. And healing others too, it's like they move to break the heal but it's not them it's a bug. . Few months ago it wasn't too bad, was better before the hallowed blight event they did. 
---
Referring to the ranks btw
---
When I first started playing, it was on PS4. I remember it being HORRIBLE. Switch to PC since.
---
Hopefully the stuff they're doing on console will continue to make it better.
---
So youd rather be broken all game as opposed to just injured? Seems pretty stupid.
---
Nice! Didn't know that, and I've been playing the new killer for about 2 hours. lol.
---
Couldn't find a high res pic with caption unfortunately :/
---
(If you were the survivor) why would you use it that many times?
---
Just accept it stupid it won't erase anything. Why would you even think something like that.
---
Warframe. a free to play game. it can be done.  
---
camping killers all just busted a nut hearing that borrowed time is glitched
---
I'll remember this once they announced it was an April fool's prank.
---
I doubt they will come this week but Wednesday next week for the first batch seems likely
---
Yes, because again..you are guaranteed losing the game by using fountains that only cure sickness. I feel like you are severely underestimating corrupt purge.
---
They seem to break more and more every DLC and fix less and less. I'd really forgo a DLC for a nice good hard optimization and bug pass. But they can't sell those.
---
it most definitely has been known to erase ALL progress. I'm not rolling that dice and taking chances.
---
Y tho? Aren't dedicated servers coming. Won't this be irrelevant in a few months or is this like the stepping stone to that?

---
I don't know if you can still do this, but I used to teleport into the exit zone, before the gates were open. Once they opened the gates, they never expected I'd be right there in front of them. lol!
---
There was a bug about a year ago where the Eula would reset all your data lol
---
No good survivors run self care period after the healing nerf.
---
I wish they could find a happy medium! I want ranking down to be harder. But this is crazy. I started as rank 1 today and now am rank 4. I have been playing for over a 1,000 hours on the game. I would rescue and end up dying with 20k points. No pip. I did gens, unhooked ppl 4 times- 1st and 2nd hook in game, was chased, got away, healed, got caught, Sabo‚Äôd and did totems. In one match. It should def be a challenge to get to rank 1 but not impossible. 
---
Dem bp man
---
Its easy to plague people which gives her corrupted fountains. On PC its very very easy to hit survivors with your steam and deal damage. Huntress axes can be dodged with skill, not so much with a corrupted stream. 
---
You'd think they'd learn to stop making  enormous maps.
---
Even if it‚Äôs only up a minutes that‚Äôs an extra minute of you dealing damage :) 
---
Idk, I can‚Äôt imagine this game having any kind of serious competitive aspect to it, even something as simple as a leaderboard. There‚Äôs just way too much RNG for anyone to ever take anything like it seriously. 
---
Tbh, I play legion only for bloodpoints, and I don‚Äôt really care if I got zero kill or depip. I usually hook survivors twice and let them go if they‚Äôre too potatoes. If only they are not kill themselves or DC...
---
god, i can't wait for this DLC to be old news so the cavemen grunting "JANE THICC" will be slightly less prevalent. my god.
---
The sad part is that last part still isn‚Äôt true for me. I‚Äôm losing my ruin in the first thirty seconds every game. Maybe I‚Äôm unlucky but this patch for me has been almost exclusively negative...
---
This is an upper mid-tier killer WITH instaheal....in other words, it‚Äôs fine as is. Your idea of removing it is actually what would break the killer.
---
Are you mad at the thought of a survivor using a window 12 times in a chase because you main killer? 
---
So you wouldn‚Äôt be Broken and vulnerable to one-hit downs the rest of the match. Going from Broken and sick to perfectly fine in five seconds is too much- let the fountains remove the Broken status and the sickness, sure, but it‚Äôs a free insta-heal too.
---
I mean I can at least recognize him. If Quentin or Laurie had different clothes I wouldn‚Äôt recognize them. Tapp‚Äôs head is way too round in this game. Judging by the pic of flip-flop they can‚Äôt even draw Ash so I don‚Äôt have much hope.
---
Yes, but the gameplay experience suffers for those few months and sure dedicated servers will reinvigorate the playerbase but in the end it's an unnecessary system that hurts the game overall 
---
They asked about "another" game.
---
Just said this in another reply, but one of the mods tried to ban me for replying to someone who asked what OCE was in the looking for squads or whatever chat. They didn‚Äôt know what it was so I elaborated and she got pissed at ME publicly, nothing said to the other guy. A lot of us girls got shit from her so we left/became inactive. One of the other mods actually had a go at me because SOMEONE ELSE posted something NSFW in the NSFW memes chat... they were like ‚Äúdo you know them‚Äù I said yea. Then they told me to handle it and I told them no coz it‚Äôs not my job and not my fucking fault and he went on the longest rant about it. They have some fucked people running that shit. I‚Äôm only in there now coz of the streamer role (and I don‚Äôt even stream anymore)
---
&gt;Usually the devs respond pretty quickly to bugs
---
Freddy says otherwise.
---
Or in my case not finding anyone lmao. Sometimes I luck out though!
---
That's your choice. You can either chance losing your shit which won't happen. Or you can not play ever again. 
---
I'M GONNA SAY THE N WORD
---
NO DON'T DO IT THAT'S RACIST
---
NI- ***blammo***
---
There are already several perks available for anti-tunneling as well as general strategies for anti-tunneling.
---
Perks: 
---
* Borrowed Time
---
* Deliverance 
---
* Decisive Strike
---
* Diversion
---
* We're gonna make it
---
* Quick &amp; Quiet + Dance With Me
---
* Urban Evasion
---
* Breakdown
---
* Spine Chill
---
* Calm Spirit
---
* Adrenaline
---
Not to mention exhaustion perks, particularly Sprint Burst. And then there are just the general strategies: 
---
* Body blocking
---
* Not unhooking before the killer Leaves
---
* Lockers
---
* Not t-baging or trolling the Killer since actions have consequences.
---
* Not healing directly under the hook
---
* And if all else fails you or one of your teammates can blind the killer with firecrackers or flashlights during a chase, during a pickup, at a pallet, at a window, or when the killer is carrying you.
---
It's enough already.
---
And any of the above, if they do stun the killer, has it's stun time reduced by Enduring as they should. Enduring is suppose to affect stun times - *ALL* stun times, especially a bs perk like DS. It should in no way be immune to getting it's stun reduced by Enduring since Enduring is literally the only perk available that reduces it's stun, which you want to take away. Four different perk counters to BB&amp;C and three different built-in counters to BB&amp;Q but you want to take away the only perk that reduces the stun (not counters, just reduces) DS?
---
It is only natural for a killer to want to get rid of a survivor as soon as possible. The faster a survivor is killed, the more a killer can snowball and achieve a victory (three or more kills). But this line of reasoning has somehow been made dirty and killers have been scolded to do the least effect method of winning this game (going after a different survivor after each and every hook). It's ridiculous. Any predator goes after the weakest link of a herd and in the case of this game it's either the one who is worst at looping or the one who is injured. And if you're deemed the weakest link then you're going to have a rough match. Survivors have been babied enough from this basic fact. Get better at unhooking away from the killer, get better at going away to heal, get better at being stealthy. Killers should not be punished for killing. 
---
Nice assumption, buddy. Are you assuming that because you main survivor? I play both, and the thought of a survivor using a window 12 times with no thought of going to another loop is disgusting to me.
---
*oh boy*
---
How did you even find that one then?
---
your friend doesnt know whatsup 
---
Should he go to another loop because he feels bad for the killer? 
---
He just ignorant lmao
---
So when did the smut from r/dbdgonewild go on the main subreddit?
---
if you zoom in, you‚Äôll see that little black piece floating in the middle. that‚Äôs how 
---
God I hear people complain all the time how one side is impossible omg such and such perk is overpowered omg but how fucking many of us can counter it? Oh a lot of us? Yea do the fucking math hey. My noob friends and boyfriend all know how to counter bbq, locker or in terror radius minimum. How fucking hard is it? God this post is making me ranty.
---
Not because "he feels bad" (what kind of logic is that?) but because it's broken as shit. There's a reason Entity block was added into the game. 
---
I don‚Äôt even know how to get points to be honest. I‚Äôve always just not worried about rank.
---
Itd be fine.
---
Really? Fuck I've actually been using this perk lately. People never expect it. Everybody was screaming for a spies from the shadows nerf right? 
---
My rank shouldn‚Äôt be determined if you *want* to save a person from the hook or do gens. Ffs the raking system would be fine if matchmaking was perfect. Games would be the exact right length for this system.
---
It honestly is a server where you get kicked out for not being liked by one of the mods. I won‚Äôt name, but one of the female mods (narrows it down) is very sexist to the other girls. A bunch of guys do something then you join in on the convo? You get warned/muted/publicly told off by her. Plus she‚Äôs also hated by quite a few, mods and community both. She‚Äôs only there coz of the owner.
---
I was doing a daily, when came across someone with this perk. I was about to open the locker when it hit me haha. I think you use it when the killer is literally in front of the doors. Cause I was in the opening animation when I got stunned. 
---
Y'all mad about the ranking system. Blame every person saying rank doesnt matter. Because if you lived you win right? You made rank 1 once you beat the game right? Its the streamers or fog whispers that made this a thing.
---
woops!
---
(i hope this hasn't been made yet) 
---
Dunno. On Xbox I‚Äôve been getting the best ping I‚Äôve ever seen 
---
The two aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive- playing a round and popping the achievement would likely involve many other items on the testing checklist. 
---
I stand by my point- a competent QA team would be a huge improvement and it‚Äôs unacceptable they don‚Äôt have one. 
---
Personally, the perks I love to run on her as well as the ones I find effective are totem perks. I like to use perks that compliment her power of creating side-objectives so the survivors are almost never on gens. Can't tell you how many 4ks I've gotten without a single gen being done, or maybe one, because they're so obsessed with finding my totems and getting the RBTs off their heads.
---
I run BBQ &amp; Chili, Hex: Ruin, Hex: Haunted Grounds, Hex: Devour Hope. BBQ is just too good for keeping your momentum and the extra bloodpoints are amazing so it's irreplaceable on any killer that doesn't require map manipulation, like Trapper and Hag.
---
I know man blame the streamers.
---
Odd to run into Tails Gets Trolled out in the wild.
---
Thanks! Happy cake day btw
---
I already did that, I couldn‚Äôt miss it ;)
---
Must be a pc and PS4 thing. Been great on my Xbox one s
---
Survivor main streamers im assuming. They seem pretty cancer 9/10.
---
New year, new oopsies.
---
This glitch where you‚Äôre unable to open the hatch has been here for far too long. This is the 4th time i died bcuz I wasn‚Äôt able to enter it in about 4 months now. How many updates is that? Geez the devs of this game have their priorities mixed up. 
---
HOW WERE YOU CHASED FOR .5 SECONDS?!
---
Honey, you got reaaal ugly
---
I actually like the change as a survivor because I can‚Äôt seem to get rid of megaminds unhooking me in heartbeat radius without borrowed time
---
That's like what the legion and plague (during corrupt purge time) have- their power meter just gets removed by pallet stuns. It must've carried over to spirit on accident or something because it wasn't mentioned in patch notes afaik
---
&gt; it's an unnecessary system that hurts the game overall 
---
What.
---
The youtubers discord‚Äôs are weird, like Noob3‚Äôs is just a bunch of people who are active (bonus) but the only convos are the same repeated ones that go like ‚Äúhey how are you I‚Äôm good what you doing‚Äù then a bunch of meme ‚Äúno u‚Äù ‚Äúdoing gens, you‚Äù ‚Äúdooooood‚Äù comments going back and forth maybe getting a longer ‚Äúdoooooooood‚Äù or an emote, a lol, it‚Äôs kinda childish. But Noob is active there, it‚Äôs just you can‚Äôt really make good friends there. I gotta try Monto‚Äôs server if he has one, I reckon he‚Äôd have a good one.
---
You did worse than the rank 14 lol
---
Oof
---
But the game doesn't have any ads?
---
If you‚Äôre not SWF you don‚Äôt know how many totems were done. If they add a counter I‚Äôm fine with NOED. Just tired of trash killers going from 0-4k in a few minutes not giving survivors a chance when the rest of us killers work for our kills.
---
Hah y‚Äôall go machine gun? I go full send baby ;)
---
If this is real I am excited for that! This perk seems pretty legit to me. 
---
Robo hand
---
That's an upvote from me! I love how we're all saying oopsie instead of mistake/accident/etc'. Thanks Pewds! 
---
The Plague is pretty disgusting...
---
Thank you oh my god. I honestly can‚Äôt believe this many people are defending dc‚Äôing like wow
---
How dare she puke on people!
---
You gotta love using his full name for it, just as a dig.
---
It will be interesting if they also included Mia Allen from the remake as well.
---
It would be good to see representation from all of the movies, be it a costume from each one.
---
The Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness and Ash vs Evil Dead
---
Neither does BBQ by the looks of it
---
Can you edit your comment to add some punctuation? I genuinely can't understand what you just typed 
---
I only just realized that Jane's Poised perk works for everyone gen that pops, not just gens that she pops herself. Still not the most incredible perk but way better than I thought. I've already escaped several chases in those few seconds of no scratch marks when someone else popped a gen while I was getting chased
---
I love it 
---
For some reason I feel like this was an accident. I know it isn't, but it feels like one.
---
Agreed.
---
Blame Jendenise and Kittychipz and Boxghostz ans any survivor main that plays swf and complains when they get downed. Bruh bhvr listens to those assholes and made the game like this.
---
w00t?
---
But for the hooks, a deadite possessed tree would be cool (*Ash and Mia's friends don't have a good track record with them*) as they could wrap around them.
---
A normal deadite would be cool, hell even Deadite Evil Ash would be great.
---
Yeah, I loved the buff it got with the Legion patch. Now they nerfed it again with this DLC.
---
I was using it a lot lately too. You're right people don't expect it. Oh well.  =/
---
Yeah both the description for Pig‚Äôs power and then Tapp‚Äôs model got leaked. Also the icons for Pig‚Äôs perks which people were trying to reconstruct lol
---
Freddy had the ‚Äúsandman‚Äù files and the lullaby leak
---
You heard me. Prove me wrong.
---
I mean I disagree with whoever said Legion is good, still a trash killer.  
---
But Plague is getting better more and more I played today, only issue I see is the hitbox of the puke is weird but that just might be me....I think it should arch more with less distance so I can puke over shit but maybe then it would be OP? Idk.  
---
Detective Gen Tapp is on the case, then. 
---
Got chased all game. Got no objective points. 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs honestly the people that main one side and only play that side are the problem.
---
I've been trying that but I only get grabbed out. The locker doesn't even open
---
How is that a contradiction?
---
Haunted Grounds, Devour Hope, Rancor and Make Your Choice. 
---
I'm a huge slut for instadowns. 
---
Feelsbadman :( 
---
She has such a surprised/sad look on her face, great drawing!
---
The scoring is low for this reason I feel.  
---
Cause I puke puke, hit, then hang.  
---
Or I puke puke, then hang if powered up.  
---
And I like Make Your Choice so thats even less brutality.   
---
I play a Huntress game (my worst killer who I have around 30 games on, still really new to her) and get 1-2k and score more than a 4k on Plague lol  
---
Sucks!!! Very inconsistent! I‚Äôm going to give it a test later on haha. I‚Äôll let you know! 
---
BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
---
It really is just absolutely staggering how over the multiple  years they've been a developer, they've shown no signs of improving at their practice.
---
If anything, BHVR really makes me appreciate the difference between independent developers and triple A developers.
---
I love it. They took a bullshit perk and re-purposed it into an anti-tunneling one. And before that, they dunked all over their community by calling out our dumb false equivalencies we always make with NOED. With no irony whatsoever, I think they've down a pretty good job so far. 
---
Did they seriously nerf Thanatophobia? lol
---
It's real bad. I didn't get the chance to use it in any of the games I played today. 
---
I was thinking the exact same thing
---
The Entity hot someüòè
---
As I live and breathe. The Wolverine.
---
And people thought that was fair smh
---
I‚Äôve noticed, the resolution visibility is low. I look off in the distance and it looks even worse than I did before! I‚Äôm on Xbox one s.
---
Be chased for 2 seconds? Sounds like my average match :(
---
You should get more for Mors Ambitio
---
The new pipping system is dumb. I play both sides, but Killer has always been harder to pip than survivor. Now it's making it a lot lot harder for killers to even guarantee a pip.
---
It's almost as if the team think both sides are on equal footing. 
---
What I can see is that players will have a harder time maintaining rank, maybe this is to even out the ranks but I'm not convinced still.
---
I've said this for ages. Devs need to make rank 1 worthwhile  otherwise people will stop caring for ranks in the end. I'd much prefer them have a quick match lobby where all perks and survivors (except for dlc) are unlocked and you can play that way, earn bp but you don't rank up, then have a ranked system for playing ranked matches.
---
Or maybe people disagree with you? You act like if they don't agree they don't care 
---
Knew I should have got Decisive and Devour Hope... Rodger me sideways
---
Not to mention, Coulrophobia and Sloppy Butcher render it ridiculously time-consuming 
---
Possession would be a really interesting gameplay mechanic, though deflated somewhat if the survivors are using Discord or something haha.
---
That tree sure could pallet loop, I tell you what.
---
All killers who aren't names nurse get looped 
---
Smh my head my head rne
---
/r/wholesomedbd
---
"Speculation"
---
The tag made me laugh more than the post itself. 
---
Lol dude it's insane how often this happens with games for multiple platforms. Every new season of Fortnite manages to be leaked by a different console each time.
---
PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR
---
Anyone wanting to play swf drop me a messsge
---
Sh*t I'm a legion main
---
At least Susie's Hot
---
I took a pic of this off my xbox with my phone so im sorry for the trashy quality and stuff
---
I don't find it that crazy. There's a lot of factors that go into game development. They need to create models and animations, bugtest everything, and of course balance it all in addition to simply making the perks. They need to make sure the entire DLC is ready a few weeks before release day, for the PTB, and it's always the small details that take the most time. In order to release on schedule, they're gonna want everything completed before the required release so they don't have to rush, especially if it's licensed content. It's not like the devs are working on anything once the Plague is released, so of course they'll start working on certain aspects of the new DLC immediately.
---
Sad
---
&gt;There are already several perks available for anti-tunneling
---
None of the perks you mentioned - apart from Borrowed Time, which is not a perk you can use yourself, being the victim - help against getting unhooked into immediately getting downed again. I suppose Adrenaline potentially can, but that's too situational to be an argument. Farming/hard-tunnelling off of hook is a BS game mechanic because it leaves the survivor player without possible counterplay of any sort.
---
As for the strategies: none of them work if the killer just so chooses to be around the hook (or is a Nurse, Billy, Spirit, Hag or Huntress and can return to the hook immediately) and down you again before you can physically make it anywhere that would allow you to initiate an actual chase (or if a "teammate" just so chooses to unhook you with the killer around, for that matter). This is called getting farmed. And it happens regularly, whether or not you teabag, or whatever. Flashlight and firecracker saves are nigh-impossible against any somewhat-competent killer, and they are also, again, something you cannot do to save yourself, but only your fellow survivors.
---
&gt;And any of the above, if they do stun the killer, has it's stun time reduced by Enduring as they should.
---
This is not true. The killer stun associated with a grasp rescue from a flashlight is not affected by Enduring. Neither are other stuns in the game, such as Nurse fatigue and Billy bump.
---
&gt;especially a bs perk like DS
---
DS is not a BS perk anymore, I don't think.
---
&gt;literally the only perk available that reduces it's stun
---
&gt;not counters, just reduces
---
The stun is now 3 seconds. That is not considerable duration even without Enduring, and often leaves you vulnerable to be downed again shortly afterwards. Players familiar with old DS tier 1 know this. Whereas Enduring now basically deletes the perk from mattering at all (https://imgur.com/UcXz4RL). Besides, why does the stun necessarily have to have means to be shortened? As I said, the game does not follow any principle of perks countering perks as a basic premise; there are a plethora of perks that are not directly or even indirectly affected by other perks.
---
&gt;It is only natural for a killer to want to get rid of a survivor as soon as possible.
---
I agree. Tunnelling is an efficient and effective winning strategy. I don't mind tunnelling much, personally - as long as the tunnelled survivor at least gets a chance to play at all, to get another chase. They are already injured and out of position, regularly in areas of the map the pallets of which have been depleted in the chase that saw them go down in the first place, so there's very much an innate advantage for the killer there. I am strictly speaking about farming/tunnelling off hook, that is, getting downed again after being unhooked without being able to make it anywhere, to get a chance for a chase scenario, to have gameplay.
---
BHVR have designed DS to be what it is now, so they do see this scenario as an issue and have tried to address it. Unfortunately their means of addressing it have been lackluster: unhooking invulnerability is too short to really matter and often doesn't even function to begin with; the Safe Rescue scoring event doesn't prevent farming "teammates" from farming (and it has been bugged for months now, triggering on any unhook); Borrowed Time, using Deep Wound, has the same inherently exploitable issue that makes Legion such a bad design: killers being able to follow survivors without initiating chase state; Decisive Strike gets hard-countered by an already-ubiquitous perk that has its main utility in the bread and butter of DbD gameplay, which is pallet interactions, plus one of the strongest killer perk combos in the game when paired with Spirit Fury. If Enduring would be a more specialized counter-perk, maybe I could see some justification behind it being as hard a counter as it is, since it leads to a possible meta of killer perk slots become more scarce, if they want to tunnel. As it stands however, Enduring is already one of the very best killer perks in the game, and killers are by no stretch compromising their builds to "counter" DS, using it.
---
Why do so many equate the old DS and NOED. DS punished a killer for doing their only objective. NOED potentially punishes survivors for not doing a secondary. They're not remotely the same thing.  
---
Some quality content finally
---
Lemme guess, you're a survivor main who does everything I described, and relies more on crutch perks and items to win rather than actual skill?
---
This is my boomstick!!! Shop smart S-mart
---
Again what does one have to do with the other?
---
Cosmetics is a completely different department to game mechanics. Your point does most certainly not stand. Why should they shut down the few people doing cosmetics? Just so they have to rehire them when they're done with bugfixing, and having to fire them again when bugs appear?
---
You're being childish.
---
Cheater I assume or was it some sort of lag?
---
But i just watched Youtube and then saw your nonsensical thread :(
---
it's not a safe bet at all that a $15 zombie model/rig is actually the upcoming licensed DBD killer....
---
Thing is they can't make him too similar, since they get rights to the character but not to the actors likeness.
---
thanks
---
Thats not what I‚Äôm saying. Im saying, that why do we get a new cosmetic update like once every 2 weeks, but when game breaking bugs like this appear, it takes 2-3 months for anything to happen about it. If you still don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm saying, there‚Äôs no helping you. 
---
I assume that would probably be the case since if there‚Äôs no new killer they should revamp a current one to make up for it
---
To each your own then, goof. 
---
A fellow person of culture, I see. You use STBFL as well.
---
Damn she got nerfed? 
---
Yeah, it's on all platforms and accepting didn't reset one of them. 
---
All you‚Äôre telling me right now is your skills of dodging don‚Äôt go past one single object flying though the air. Not to mention the salt by someone giving an opinion based on playing on both console and pc that instead of accepting as a possibility... you just downvoted lol
---
Yup lmao
---
Legion bad amirite guys
---
(I love legion but I respect the opinions of those who don‚Äôt)
---
Nope I'm a killer main. But I'm impressed that those survivors got you so salty that it's bleeding into reddit.
---
Look dude, I'm just telling you how it is. I've been playing a while now. Nothing is changing in the near future. If you can't handle it, than stop playing. I don't know what else you're hoping to hear.
---
She wasnt that special before and they decides she just *needed* to be nerfed? 
---
Almost never take it off. You know it. 
---
Again.
---
Different departments.
---
I cannot make this a lot more easier to understand.
---
They work months for cosmetics and throw them out when they're ready to throw them out. Why should they wait on the debugging team to throw them out with the patch?
---
Mind you we just got a big patch, and big patches in multiplayer games almost always have bugs associated with them.
---
Again, you're simply being childish.
---
The people who make cosmetics have nothing to do with development. New cosmetics don‚Äôt mean the devs aren‚Äôt focusing on bugs and glitches.
---
I'm in NA and until today didn't have problems matching against low ping killers. I just had 7 lobbies in a row against a 500 ping killer on PC. 
---
An address is an address, don't be scurred
---
Solo is always terrible, this game isn't fun without friends
---
Groovy
---
Maybe it'd be like fixing a generator. Constant skill checks, and when its filled the killer is kicked.
---
Its the same for left behind
---
That crouch and bounce of shame was warranted 
---
Probably a glitch. You can see his leg start stomp the pallet.
---
Thought it was called the Detroit chapter 
---
Once and yeah it was super weird. Also really annoying because there‚Äôs no way to get boldness points
---
Those lines are CRISP! It's a great piece. 
---
I agree that it‚Äôs nonsense for everyone else and they shouldn‚Äôt be doing that, I‚Äôm just saying why I‚Äôm okay chalking it up as a loss and moving on if they don‚Äôt do anything about it. Yes I got it through a subscription to a premium service, but I still consider it a free game through that because I would‚Äôve purchased said service regardless of this game‚Äôs presence (actually I‚Äôd had ps+ for like 8 months at that point). So it was like a nice bonus to the $60 id already felt justified paying if that makes sense
---
Whispers is good for knowing when to crouch
---
Nurse‚Äôs allows for you to get the drop on healing survivors
---
Monitor and Abuse lets you stay stealthy for longer when you stand up, making gen grabs easier
---
BBQ for those delicious bloodpoints
---
Ruin to **SLOW THE GAME DOWN** (^just a little bit)
---
When do they drop?
---
Wonder if Billys can still do the flying trick on Auto Wreckers map
---
Vomit timer? I didnt mention that dude
---
Hey BHVR, stop putting the shitty Quentin perks up and give us the only one worth a damn
---
I‚Äôm adding to your list. I know how to read. 
---
I‚Äôm saying that console doesn‚Äôt even have a vomit timer so that makes her even worse. 
---
I understand they are a business and need to keep making money but each DLC seems to be more bugged and broken then the last, feels almost a bit rushed and a bit more rushed after each DLC. I know they said they are now working on optimization but I'd be happy to miss a DLC for lots of bug fixes and optimization.
---
I‚Äôm sorry to say, if anyone is bitching and salty right now it‚Äôs you. I‚Äôd suggest you take a bit of time and then reread this guys reply to you as it really wasn‚Äôt bad at all. He was rather nice to you and then you freaked out on him, not exactly fair of you to do. 
---
I had this same mentality for a long time as Killer. Eventually you'll just stop caring, there are gonna be people who will hate you no matter what you do and regardless if they win or lose. It's not something personal towards you, it could've literally been any killer and they would've done the same thing.  
---
I'm a very sensitive person too so I also used to be very affected by what people told me in the aftergame chats (and still am just as everyone is.) But eventually your knowledge of your own abilities will surpass the knowledge someone else can impart to you. Meaning you'll know when you're being an asshole and when you're not or if you are doing well or otherwise. It makes it much easier to shrug off toxicity because there is less room for doubt in your mind. It's one of the reasons why as you get older in life things bother you less, it's because you've seen enough things to know your true colours (Or at least better than someone else could.)
---
Like others have said, even though from your perspective the fun of others might matter more to you, your enjoyment and success is just as important if not moreso than that of the people you play with. For you to go as far as to make a reddit post about it I can tell that its something thats been on your mind and I hope you find the answers you seek, either here or somewhere else.  
---
Hope to see you in the fog sometime &lt;3
---
lmao oof
---
Low effort*
---
Am I the only one that thinks thano itself is just a badly thought up perk? If the perk is even sort of good it's going to be massively strong on a lot of killers.
---
Yeah but Kate has the face of somebody who‚Äôs been smoking crack under a bridge for a few days
---
Thing is I dont grasp how both evil dead or pennywise would fit. Pennywise preys on children and everyone in the game is over the age of 21 or something if I'm right?
---
According to the team they only have one map designer, which seems strange, or makes alot of sense, having one dude design stuff means your probably not getting the views of a killer and survivor.
---
Honestly why don't they just get streamers to run through them, get some high level killer and survivor streamers, then get them to run a few rounds and list any major issues that happen in the map. I really do wonder what the PTB is even for, its not for balance clearly, and its not for bug fixes either, considering how every chapter snaps the game in half.
---
remember in the first evil dead where a tree ***r a p e d*** a lady
---
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YWZ9pJoPmZUwrMTrmaX9VyALGm1-01i6/view?usp=drivesdk
---
I definitely kill the survivors immediately if there‚Äôs only 1-2 in game. Not worth anyone‚Äôs time to farm points and then they leave. I‚Äôd rather just move on and play a real game. 
---
The exception is if someone burns BPS. I‚Äôll play to the best of my abilities but if 2 people DC and one suicides, I‚Äôll farm with the last guy since wasting a BPS feels pretty bad
---
Just sayin people who do this kinda toxic shit always a try to defend it by saying "Oh but you see im a [Insert side that they're arguing against] main, so I don't do this!"
---
No, not at all! It is a major distraction to the killers. If you stay far away from your team and constantly bait the killers, then your team can easily get stuff on the other side of the map.!
---
This has been all over the subreddit all day
---
Darth Plague-Ash the Groovy.
---
Your game running at 10 FPS has nothing to do with servers or P2P connection, only a better computer will fix that (or devs refining their code to reduce the usage of GPU resources).
---
Dedicated Servers just means the killer won't be the host anymore so you won't be affected by someone else's connection problems but that doesn't completely removes the connection issues depending on how BHVR handles their servers.
---
Exactly! He is the constant punching bag, he is like if Daffy Duck was tossed into a horror movie.
---
I've had a lot of lobbies as killer and survivor where we only get 3 survivors and the game never seems to give us a 4th even after 10minutes of waiting and then others tend to leave.
---
Seems good paired with Tenacity
---
Also, effed up my tittle to this post to haha.
---
As an avid Pig player I like to use a mix of BBQ, Hex: Ruin, Spirit Fury + Enduring, Nurses Calling, Sloppy Butcher, Discordance, Hex: Haunted Ground, Brutal Strength, Surveillance.
---
There's a few more perks that she can utilize well. Her traps are quite good at slowing the game down by themselves so Ruin isn't always necessary. But I like to use it just to get that extra bit of time at the start to get the pressure going. BBQ is great for snowballing and just keeping that pressure going. Other than that, just play into her strengths. Her traps are great for controlling the tempo of the game, couple that with Sloppy Butcher and you can make the survivors waste a lot of time. She's quite small which makes looping a lot easier, because the survivors have a harder time seeing you over the loops. Aura reading perks/information perks can be really nice on her because of her ability to sneak up on survivors.
---
Yeah what is he talkin about...
---
Yeah, I ran into that too and sandbagged someone to a Trapper running Distressing who was close enough to the hook that by the time they were off the hook he was already swinging at them (and got them down because perk is broke)
---
The trapper one reminds me of My Bloody Valentine
---
Yeah I couldn‚Äôt tell the difference either. Lol 
---
Meanwhile I'm still waiting on a damn bikini Meg cosmetic.
---
Something tells me Bruce would want them to use his likeness
---
Yup same. Its great.
---
Nice.
---
So is Spirit making MORE noise to give away what she‚Äôs doing and thus kneecapping her ability to fakeout intended or just an audio bug? Because that seems uhhhhhh a bad choice if it‚Äôs intentional.
---
Wow fuck ahe ia thicc, thats just dangerously thicc.
---
Risk v. Reward. Taking instaheals too liberally results in the Plague having ready supplies of instadown later.
---
Would you have any issues with the puke applying broken if this was changed?
---
Kate has DEFINITELY fucked her cousin before
---
If the base gen time was slowed it would create quite the ripple across the whole game. Personally as a killer main my average game doesn't feel super short or super long, it's clearly the games with SWF where the gens are finished far quicker than seems fair.
---
As long as they continue course with nerfing SWF and bringing solo survivors closer to that level and then balancing the killers around that we should be fine.
---
But thano to me is a lot of free power for what's honestly not that much effort on the killers part. 
---
That's not a bad way to play Freddy, though.
---
This is rich considering I barely play survivor at all lol
---
She‚Äôs full of poise, baby. She runs from gens with ease.
---
Yeah but it'd be a huuuuuge missed opportunity.
---
I could never find out but does Thanataphobia work
---
If a survivor dies? 
---
Damn those are high ranks and solid perks, good job fellow Freddy believer
---
No. 
---
What is the actual point of that perk anyway? Like what viable use would it have lmao
---
On PC, didn't get adept Plague when I should have.
---
It's not on pc either. It's the same as the pig 
---
Pretty sure it stops when they die. Would likely be too strong if it snowballed with each death
---
I also suffer from emetophobia. Played against the Plague three times today and can honestly say that the vomiting sounds and animations are not as bad as I expected. They didn't bother me at all. I can't speak for the killer perspective.
---
&gt; Because "Behavior" 
---
They feel like a company with potential and used to be a smaller company that managed to hit big time with one title. As they grew they really had no concrete idea of how best to polish their stuff. However they knew that when they released a patch if there were bugs they would get feedback. So they never saw a reason to hire bug testers. Then they leak something that might cause them to lose a licence or even prevent them from getting a licence with how bad they made themselves look with possible NDAs. 
---
The problem is deep rooted. Likely it will take a bigger loss than this to make them focus on making a better tested products. That or something of that magnitude will be their downfall. 
---
Can't wait to see how they manage to screw up the servers down the line. Hope they don't but this sort of stuff isn't building good trust honestly.
---
Many survivors here and elsewhere encourage each other to disconnect from matches if they don't like the killer or loadout(3-gen Doctor build, NOED Nurse, IR Head Huntress, Freddy + Black Box, killers using an Ebony Mori, and any Legion build whatsoever) and its a growing problem. BHVR needs to increase the penalty for in-match disconnects, and players need to start calling it out more here instead of pretending like this isn't a problem so that they appear 'unbiased'. It's getting ridiculous. 
---
This new system is HELL to survivors when killers DC. I‚Äôve lost 4 pips tonight ALONE from killers DCing during the match. I shouldn‚Äôt be punished for THEM leaving. It‚Äôs ridiculous.

Survivors in a nutshell. xD
---
Ahh that sucks - I thought it did. I really think it should 
---
Hey BHVR I have a suggestion. Maybe FUCKING FIX LEGION
---
Yeah for such a fun game at times, people in the community ruin it. 
---
Ok thanks :D
---
Well shit it‚Äôs tier 3.
---
See 
---
I hate the new update. It might seem trivial, but for some reason it ruined the game for me.
---
I see so many people saying "You don't need to use a /s" and "the /s kills it" while when people don't use it, a joke ends up as controversial. 
---
Damned if you don't, damned if you do.
---
this post did not age well.
---
Don't you DARE say anything bad about my PRECIOUS LEGION
---
&gt;Nurse
---
Alright, I can see that.
---
&gt;Clown
---
wait hol on now
---
They took it away?
---
Hag, spirit, good clowns.
---
This man's a scholar on zombies, he'd know.
---
Looping is a bitch made technique anyways
---
the killer should be his hand
---
You don't need a SWF, you just need survivors who understand the best plan is to not all clump up on a handful of gens. Which uh yeah that can be like finding four four leaf clovers.
---
Either way, at this point they've been balancing around Ruin and at least the existence of gen slow down perks. They should just figure out how slow they want gens to be. It's too important to killers for good gen perks to not immediately become meta.
---
I made a post to discuss the change, it is my opinion that is down voted, you're not supposed to down vote someone just because you don't agree.
---
iirc if you disconnect because your net stopped you can't join as spectator, unlike if you manually disconnect via the leave button. You may have just lagged out.
---
Its just sad lonely people getting kicks out of being an asshole in a video game
---
Yeah, problem is it's up to the studio. The guy who played Quentin didn't even know he was in the game until after the dlc was out.
---
That might be the case, as I'm told the quotes on the perks are from Ash vs the Evil Dead. 
---
Im rank 7 atm, I play solo. All of the plagues ive faced tonight have gotten 0 kills. I think maybe you just need ta git gud.
---
Agreed. It'd be about as confusing as Legion can be.
---
Yea, I mean self-care Tier 1 and 3 are literally the same thing.  Same goes for all exhaustion perks being the same other than the timer.  Balanced Landing Tier 1 and 2 got buffed not too far back to add the stagger reduction at all tiers.  Ruin didn't get buffed, BHVR is just making tier 1 and 2 of certain perks more feasible for the people who play this game casually and don't have the time to grind for hundreds of hours.
---
Pretty sure you can't get adept while using add ins haven't tested this I know bringing an item will cause you to not get it as a survivor so I don't use add ins or offering now
---
I thought the opposite, i did a weird weave between 2 tractors and hit someone vaulting a window, you can hold down the mouse button to go further
---
Really? She doesn‚Äôt seem all that powerful to me.  Maybe it‚Äôs just the fact that people are still learning to play her though. I‚Äôll give it a few weeks and see if I agree with you. 
---
She‚Äôs thicc definitely not fat. Fat is the clown, she‚Äôs sooo cute 
---
Your counter argument you listed a game you said yourself was educational. There‚Äôs nothing educational about DBD. It‚Äôs violence for the sake of it that people get to enjoy. It‚Äôs really not the same thing and you know it. 
---
You didn‚Äôt address my main point about game design either. Wtf would be the point in adding a killer and completely changing their identity? Literally all we know about Jack the Ripper is from the crime scenes. We don‚Äôt know he stalked women. In fact it‚Äôs highly likely he didn‚Äôt stalk them because they were prostitutes and would have gone with a stranger willingly. 
---
When a killer‚Äôs whole identity is sexual violence why would the devs add that? You‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm speaking on behalf of people being offended. It‚Äôs not about being offended. That‚Äôs what you don‚Äôt get. I‚Äôve been on Jack the Ripper tours, I live in London. I‚Äôve seen the exhibition at the London Bridge so I‚Äôve definitely been ‚Äúentertained‚Äù by the character. The point is that it‚Äôs an educational entertainment JUST LIKE YOU SAID BEFORE! Playing as him is not.
---
To reiterate my main point you just don‚Äôt seem to get. They can‚Äôt add him using the small info we know of him (extreme sexual violence) - and that‚Äôs all anyone knows. There is literally no point in adding a character like that and ignoring their whole identity. 
---
And like I said I‚Äôm not offended by it, I‚Äôd actually be more offended as a player if they butchered a character that badly so no, there‚Äôs no deep seated reason that you implied why I‚Äôm against It rofl. Honestly that was a ridiculous thing to say. I could quite easily reply saying there must be a reason you want to play as killer that raped and mutilated women and you‚Äôd probably feel that was a silly thing to say too :) 
---
That's a fair point, I base it off my own experience beads/amulet obviously helps her a great deal.  However I don't think it's one of the strongest but definitely one of the most balanced, it provides her with a good advantage without removing counter play from the survivors which to me says good balance.  
---
Though the spirit naturally has a lot of one hit incentive built into her natural perks (2 of her 3 in fact with rancor and Haunted Grounds) so NOED seems like a natural progression for that play style in my mind. But every player is different and can make the conscious decision not to use it. 
---
She looks really pretty in her other outfits. Her default is not good looking at all tho 
---
Are you sure that isn't BHVR every day?
---
Cute is fang, cute is Kate, cute isn't jane
---
Uhm exfuckingscuse me!?! KATE IS THE ONE AND ONLY MIS THICCSON!!!!!!
---
Williams 
---
If they dont save, they probably wont pip either. And I think the only reasons survivors wont save is if the killer wont leave (killer's fault) or they're busy or scared (survivor's fault). In normal games without the killer camping, neither are going to happen. 
---
How did you not see it are you blind
---
Jane is adorable. You‚Äôre just a hater 
---
If you throw the pallet down you're only playing into his game.
---
Check the "kill your friends" lobby and switch to survivor, and the perks are all there (unless you play on PC)
---
Claudette getting squared up for screwing the gen
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
r/gatekeeping 
---
i'ma be reserving my moris for jane from now on.
---
The reason SWF breaks the game is the direct communication. Even 4 solo players that understand how to play isn't nearly as ridiculous to face as a 3/4 SWF
---
I don't think they have been balancing around ruin and gen slowing perks, not with the assumption every game has them at least.
---
DS itself was fine, the problem is when a good survivors used DS it fundamentally broke the game.  Almost like being able to run an ebony mori as a perk every game.
---
Nah. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if BHVR got into some legal trouble though, but idk anything about the legal ramifications about this kinda stuff. 
---
How was this toxic lol
---
True, but i have an opinion just like everyone else and just because it disagrees with yours doesn't make it less than yours
---
Wow didn‚Äôt expect a reply to such an old comment. Luckily I can tell you why you didn‚Äôt get it. All the adept achievements were bugged with the release of the new chapter unfortunately. Not sure if it‚Äôs been patched yet. 
---
Darn...
---
It does feel weird. It's made in a way that if we don't OBLITERATE survivors by not letting them do ANYTHING, we don't pip, and sometimes even depip. Unfortunately I'll stop trying to climb and just play for fun (as I should, right? But I'm a competitive mf). I love Trapper &amp; Wraith, and I haven't been able to play a game and NOT depip yet. I was rank1, then after the reset, rank 3, went down to 4 and still going down, apparently.
---
Why be a dick to anybody ? 
---
Saw a post here about Bruce Campbell being asked on twitter a while ago about evil dead making a video game comeback and he replied with "yes" and no other game announcements since this could be what he is referring to.
---
Also the actor is one of the co founders of the production company that to my knowledge manages the franchises rights and I think he would be part of approving it. I'd also hope he was part of it given his love for his character and cult following.
---
This is all just speculation from an evil dead fanboy who is hoping beyond hope they don't screw this up.
---
Want to add as well I know characters in this game don't talk but now with the exception of the plague... I'm hoping an Ash survivor may grace us with a "hail to the king baby" or even a "groovy"
---
Laughs is impossible skill check Doc.
---
No, but at one point it would apply to spectators which was pretty funny
---
Am I the only one that thinks they should bring back tier 2 &amp; 3 rituals?
---
I just had three groups of incredibly toxic survivors. I play fair, I don't camp, I don't lobby dodge, and I want to try out the new killer. Like, wtf, stop with the bullying.
---
The 4 triangles in the middle represent killer vs survivor balance. 
---
LMAO This is literally the whiniest shit I've ever heard. Props to the trolls who managed to shatter your fragile soul bby killer :(
---
Its like come on I'm just trying to have fun why the fuck are you being a cunt about no lifing the game and being better than me?
---
My internet didn't stop and it happened to another person too and it showed killer as DCd
---
Just watched a guy watch his teammate die on the hook. Didn't even try. 
---
No I don't watch Tyde, I usually only watch the more entertaining ones that laugh at the game more than get mad like Tru3 or Monto. 
---
But to sort of amend what I said, your points are fair, I was just expressing my own feelings about how I decide whether to make a point to cleanse or no. With NOED I'll assume LF has it because of the killer's reputation and based on how well or poorly they play. With Spirit I assume she has it because  she has a lot of one hit incentive built into her natural perks (2 of her 3 with rancor and Haunted Grounds) so NOED seems like a natural progression for that play style in my mind. But every player is different and can make the conscious decision not to use it. 
---
But to what you said despite the strength and speed of her power. she is still an M1 killer because she still has to M1 twice to down someone without those kinds of perks. 
---
Good leadership would probably make sure whoever was in charge of that wouldn't have done that in the first place by not hiring a moronic amateur. 
---
In the PTB I was always saying "spit on me mommy" in every post game chat 
---
Ash is my favorite part of Evil Dead, so I'm fine with it just being him. Although a cabin map would be AMAZING
---
So if you‚Äôre not interested in it , nobody is? I personally like them. Just don‚Äôt read it. 
---
I really am not sure why type of original content you want specifically catered for you but maybe if you suggested people might try 
---
Original content is quite broad and you clearly don‚Äôt like most of it even if there is plenty here 
---
 
---
Does anyone know exactly what they changed with the matchmaking system? Before the update I would get a lot of lobbies with pings usually &lt;130 and now every lobby i get into they've all  been &gt;190.
---
Some one tallied up perks from a thousand games a bit back, and found that they ran into ruin 45-50% of the time. And from a design decision, it's an extraordinarily bad idea to not balance with the maximum potential in mind.
---
Then again BHVR gave us the old machine gun builds so who knows. It should have been immediately obvious that old Tinkerer was gonna be a problem.
---
Calling her fat is mean &lt;\3 
---
They're getting more creative with their sandbagging. 
---
Especially the new pip system. They continue to simply jump the gun and implement changes based on a vocal minority, without stopping to consider whether it's a good move for the game or not.
---
They are simply one hit wonders, lucky that this game went so well. Case in point, Deathgarden. They are a horrible company and wouldn't know how to make a good game if it bit them in the ass.
---
Yeah, really.
---
I went through my whole crappy work day and couldn't wait to get home to try out the new killer...thought I'd be having fun when I got home...and now I'm not having fun because of the way people are playing.
---
I don't have a lot of time to play and only started playing recently. So, I'm only rank 18 now. And all of these groups have been rank 10 - 13 or had a player or two who were rank 8 or whatever.
---
It‚Äôs toxic because the survivor went out of their way to message me to gloat about me disconnecting 2 minutes into the match as if I was giving (When in reality I had to leave ).
---
Well now I can see that, but the first hour after it was released is when this game was which is less likely but I guess still ‚Äúpossible‚Äù. Repetitive killers can be a pain ya but it‚Äôs a good chance to learn how to face them then.. which they weren‚Äôt :P
---
You can run cooldown addons, stab once, run to catch up, end Feral and then down them within a couple seconds. It's lame and works almost everytime. Even without cooldown addons you can do the same it's just easier to do that. Or stack dirty blade addons and they have to commit to a mend if they don't wanna go down.
---
I completely understand how frustrating these types of players can be for both fellow survivors, and for the killer. But reverting the emblem changes only fixes the ranking up problem and not general stupidity. I think making the changes would still be a step in the right direction, since it'll make it harder for those people to breach into red ranks. No amount of fixes can entirely stop stuff like this. Give the system a few more chances. üòÖ
---
Your behavior would be more toxic. All she said was ‚Äúsad‚Äù 
---
Lmfao how sensitive do you have to be of a person to think that was toxic ? 
---
I didn't say that nobody does, just that a group of us do not care for it. 
---
When I think of OC, I think drawings, renders, etc.
---
Could‚Äôve been a random disconnect that wasn‚Äôt his fault. It‚Äôs happened to me before, and they‚Äôre super fucking aggravating. 
---
Yeah. New system is pretty bad.
---
Your right by the way he should have left because if you face camp him next time you see him youre seen as wrong.
---
Ah that makes sense. Thought it was too early for the winter sale, my mistake. Cheers for replying 
---
Welcome to dbd.
---
Well that sucks for me lol I have all adept achievement except for the new characters and I apparently have been making it harder on myself 
---
A VR game was announced awhile ago though
---
just tell them how no matter what some people won‚Äôt catch it like perhaps most of the people above 
---
Yeah you're right, just hate having to do that. 
---
My name is ass and I‚Äôll eat your Ethan
---
Nurse is definitely stronger when played by folks who get good with her blinks.  She's a Killer that has a high enough skill ceiling to where yes she's frustrating to play against but ultimately you aren't always going to see them steamroll you.  
---
Meanwhile Legion has a skill carpet.  He literally just runs faster at Survivors and can ignore obstacles.  Not only that but he gets to see other Survivors after stabbing someone.   The only reason he's not completely OP is because of the Wounded mechanic that inhibits his ability to down multiple Survivors in a short span of time like the Nurse can.   
---
In comparison to other Killers though a chase with him is literally just a timer that ticks down to a point, and Frank's Mix Tape makes it count down faster.  He basically gets guaranteed downs in exchange for the inability to down people efficiently, and that's how BHVR "balanced" him.  
---
Isnt that like in the tos?  Taking the game hostage?
---
He‚Äôs just mad cause he can‚Äôt use his bitch-made looping technique. 
---
I know it's not bannable, but to me it felt like he was hijacking my game and talking incoherent shit on my messenger. I blocked him after ten mins and continued making dinner. Blah
---
I hope they fixed the trapper bug. Did you notice any traps sinking below the ground? I had some in the PTB which I placed alongside the temple that sunk underground which could not be picked up, but I would still get trapped when stepping in one
---
Ive escaped twice with Jane using only her 3 perks through exit gates. In one instance I didnt even go down once. And I still didn't get her adept achievement. None of the new achievements are working for me.
---
She‚Äôs hiding behind the Claudette!
---
Holy sheeps; thank you! üíï
---
I don't expect to be hit with a DMCA claim for leaks, but other gaming subreddits have come under fire for leaks. It's something we need to keep in mind.
---
That‚Äôs hella fucking terrifying, nice job man looks fucking scary
---
They're all broken atm
---
Yes, and as it turns out they didn't. The landmine glitch is indeed still a thing. 
---
*laughs in vomit mama*
---
I got it to work twice but its wayyyy to bugged and situational to run atm

---
Downvote if you're a salty killer
---
I put DS on for the first time tonight (and hit it for the first time as well, yay), and it felt really good. Thankfully the killer stopped tunneling me after that. 
---
They could do Evil Ash as the killer. I think that would be awesome.
---
What are we supposed to see here? 
---
Whats wrong with that? Because you got one rank 2?
---
The average rank of the survivors is 10,5 and you are rank 12, this seems like a decent matchmaking to me.
---
I think I know a Doctor you could see about that..
---
I guess it's another post about bad matchmaking...
---
Rank 2
---
I have never seen the word ‚Äúthick‚Äù get as much usage as it‚Äôs getting right now due to Jane.
---
This is one of the most Toxic communities I‚Äôve ever been a part of my guy. I just play and try to ignore the trolls. And it‚Äôs really sad that it‚Äôs so bad that this community is numb to it and like to say ‚ÄúGet over it or don‚Äôt play‚Äù. 
---
Sometimes its just a real disconnect or the game just crashes.
---
If you zoom in enough by the fire you can see ace and nea cuddling. Good lord ...
---
Yeah... almost makes me wish I didn't buy it
---
It depends on how the killer chooses to play, you can tunnel and get multiple frenzy hits on a single target or you can do hit and runs. With pig you can either let them ‚Äúplay the game‚Äù and try to get their RBT off or you watch the boxes and then down and rehook a survivor with the RBT on. It‚Äôs about the choices the killer makes, **I** personally don‚Äôt find fun in tunneling with things like franks and stab wound, so instead **I** do hit in runs using speed and duration add ons. It‚Äôs the same concept with pig, you can choose how you play, one may be more viable/rewarding than the other but you still have the choice.
---
Omg it‚Äôs Keith
---
Yep, games fun but mostly shit people play it.

Wait what?

Thank you very much!

---
I love the bigger skillcheck! :)
---
Maybe it's the manly cheek bones ',:)
---
I'm glad you think so, thanks!
---
Haha that‚Äôs literally what I said when I saw him
---
Tbh- I'm glad someone pointed out the lines. I spent the most time inking it over usual stuff just to get some form of texture. Thanks again!
---
CiV 5 callef it wants you back 
---
You cannot cleanse the toxicity of the survivors. They will always be toxic.
---
Oh, thank goodness. I didn't read the patch notes in depth and was worried that change didn't go through. It's only day 1 of the new patch, so I'm sure it'll be changed at some point.
---
Also the face on one of the perks looks very much like him from vs Evil Dead
---
kinda new ds ?
---
If you leave you can't affect the game. Even if all you do is force the killer to smack you out, that buys your other teammates time to escape out the other exit.
---
But will we ever get Slenderman?
---
Yes it can
---
No one will run this perk.

You can run away from the pallet, you can't counterplay that in deadzones.

Yeah I just bought her on ps4 today and I can‚Äôt do anything. Maybe I just suck but she feels really weak. The vomit seems to be very slow and or I can‚Äôt hit em with it
---
This isn‚Äôt new. Happened to me before legion was released
---
That's just Dwight reaction after being found in a locker for the 15th time.

---
Imagine this getting leaked and all of a sudden the evil dead movies get bought again and nobody knows why xdd
---
Thanks for correcting me 
---
From the wording it looks like it only negates m1 hits, so hello Leatherface?
---
The way the tile based map system works I bet the map designer actually does very little and most of the geometry falls on the art team.
---
Pretty cool! A ghoul killer would be awesome.
---
they updated the eula thats why
---
No cause it‚Äôs situational. If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs really good at running the killer and never getting hit then it‚Äôs a waste. Likewise, if you‚Äôre someone who gets hit all the time will still make the perk a waste.
---
The only time I‚Äôd imagine the perk being strong is if you‚Äôve take two hits and use the third to rescue someone. But even then, why would you rescue someone while being chased?
---
That's what I was thinking, but I really hope it's not the case. A deadite killer would be amazing.
---
He never said thats the new killer, just linked a ghoul model that COULD be something similar to a ghoul killer.
---
It was like this before the update, read the patch notes they said they fixed it... 
---
Don't know if this is an old pic karma grab or the bug is still in the game, but it's not the update that caused this.
---
Thanks for the downvotes, but it's the truth. DbD has one of the most toxic online communities. If they ban all the toxic players, you're going to end up with a very small playerbase.   
---
But hey, downvote this too. Let's ignore the "downvote button isn't the disagree button" rule. This subreddit is just as toxic as the actual game, I swear to god. 
---
*Wait was that real? That actually happened?*
---
Most people, no matter how good usually get hit 3 times, if you think about it this perk is literally just decisive
---
Thanks for posting this for the 1057th time
---
Killing yourself on hook and dcing isn‚Äôt a mechanic to use?
---
thanks.
---
Lol, thanks
---
You're willingly posting in one of the most toxic subs, if you don't like it suck it up or stop posting.
---
They probably sell data to Facebook or Google, and you get ads for similar games/movies.
---
i didn't play much PTB but as far as i know she never could see the vomit timer, just like pig she can tell if a survivor has a timer active but cannot see how far along it's progressed, only survivors can see the actual progression
---
Haven‚Äôt gotten it to work once. 
---
To be honest I think the perk is ok. I think you‚Äôll have to use it with other stuff to really make it shine, but at the cost of running better stuff.
---
Massive credit and thanks to /u/ZombieHuggerr for the templates he shared. It's meme making time!
---
wait they changed hex ruin what did they do to it
---
The bloodwebs are stealing bloodpoints and perks whenever you close application on PS4. It could be related to playing KYF with the leaked perks, but I can't confirm that. It's happened to a friend on Jane and myself on Plague.

P4 Pig:
---
People who say shes OP are probably not the most experienced players in the game.
---
The new system hasn't really affected me but it's probably because I main nurse. I feel like you're going to have a hard time if your not playing A-tier killers in rank 1.
---
Literally how my friend always is lol. Always some kind of excuse, never it being his own mistake.
---
Hasn‚Äôt happened to me yet. I was surprised when I walked past and random locker and this bish jumps out and takes my wallet.
---
Be nice to the magic player :P
---
Ah gotcha
---
"Lol trash killer" -one dead survivor
---
"Well, it looks like the trash killer caught you, soo..." -me actually crying to myself
---
I dont, because i refuse to spend money on DLC, which is what licensed killers are. Unless they are super unique like the plague or something there is no way of me getting them. Iridescent shards are here for a reason.
---
I think it was bugged before this patch too. 
---
I was getting unhook stacks but not protection stacks. 
---
I did love MTG when I was young. Oh those times.. played Black - White deck 
---
Lithe wasn't really buffed, they just made it actually usable because they can't fix their shitty chase mechanic.
---
And that being said people who think she‚Äôs too weak probably aren‚Äôt the most tactically sound.
---
Why?
---
Btw
---
I'm reformatting this in SFM. This is great
---
I mean, he probably won't be out until June/July anyway.
---
Yes it's worth it and I agree with the other replier
---
Senpai noticed me!
---
For real though, I always giggle when a survivor talks about how trashy a killer is *while they're dead*.
---
Eh, each to their own. She has too many weaknesses to not be bad IMO.
---
Scourge of my being! Black-Red 4 life lol 
---
It‚Äôs not really an opinion matter.. It‚Äôs math. Js.
---
omegalul yeah. I love that clip. Literally repeat it in my head everytime something happens thats bugged af
---
Oh snap that is hawt üëåüèªüòÜ
---
The new pip system is horrendous. Did they even test this?
---
I just watched a streamer do one full generator, unhook two teammates, get chased by the Plague long enough for the team to do the remaining 3 generators, pallet stunned her twice, got downed, unhooked by a teammate, downed again, unhooked by a teammate, downed *again*, then used Unbreakable to escape and survive. He got the most points out of anyone on the team and barely passed the safety pip.
---
I played a game where I finished 2.5 gens solo, cleansed three totems, unhooked two teammates, healed both of them, got chased and hit out the door and survived....and *de-pipped*. 
---
Wow, much fun!
---
Math? Lmao you have to be joking
---
I‚Äôve never seen people not even try to save
---
This is exactly what I'm talking about. I feel as though to get one pip you need to get iri in all categories and 2 pips is just a myth. 
---
How do you think the damn games designed? Fairy dust? What do you think the whole system behind optimizing loops is... The fucking distance around objects. The entire game is a system of math, how on earth do you not know that?
---
Unpopular opinion: being sandbagged by your teammate alerting the killer to your presence to protect themselves isn't objectively bad.
---
Think about it, you're running away from someone trying to kill you in a horror movie, and you can die, or trip the person running with you and escape while they die. Yes it's not a very altruistic thing to do and will make everyone call you a scumlord, but if we're being completely objective here, playing for only yourself isn't a huge sin.
---
Good point.
---
It also makes the rank system pointless, because you have to play like a supercomputer every single match to gain any ground. You have to rely on the killer/survivor always making mistakes and allowing for you personally to pull off a perfect game, every single time, which simply does not happen.
---
If they wanted to go to such an extreme 'solution', they should have just removed ranks entirely. Instead they subject paying customers to some fucked up form of eternal purgatory.
---
haha hes gonna have a face off with Billy on who wore it better.
---
You can keep doing bloodwebs until you have all the perks you have available. Prestiging doesn‚Äôt give access to any more perks than you had access to before. 
---
Probably to increase the overall skill of players at red ranks so you don't get teammates that are immersed survivors doing absolute nothing or something along those lines. 
---
Top 10 worst mistakes in anime. But interested in that Evil Dead DLC.
---
Same. I play on PC and had to dodge 5+ lobbies just to find one below 140ish ping
---
There are two gates. The other survivors might be trying to open the other one and seeing you get smacked or downed at the other exit helps your team. A lot of killers think it‚Äôs BMing but that‚Äôs not the intent of a majority of non-teabagging survivors.
---
My only real question is would you want any of those?
---
Maybe they could do it well. Spirit is pretty much THE closest I've seen a game get to Deadite attitude, noises, and posing.

how do you make the words all scared like that!!

Four people in the icon. There's four people that take up the Legion mantel.
---
This guy is obviously retarded. Just ignore the small man child.
---
Now hear me out üòÇüòÇ At least with the clown you can hear when hes coming unlike Micheal, but I guess that also depends on perks. Too late to change now lol
---
Don‚Äôt you talk shit about my Lisa.
---
Meanwhile, platinum rank in Magic Arena and I'm having a blast. üòÑ
---
My first game tonight was against a plague. I saw them using their power and was curious about what it would do so I stopped running to let them hit me with it. Even with me standing still and being right in front of them the stream missed and they had to try again. All 4 survivors escaped that game too. Idk what add-ons are available for the power but what I saw was far from OP. 
---
I didn't get a chance to look but their is an add on  that knocks on 2nd vomit attack.
---
Can have a switcher and they triggered if with their feet. Or just a random crash.
---
BHVR be like: okay here are your voice lines
---
Voice Actor: "hnghh.... haaaa.... owww.... ouuuu.... ha..."
---
Is that how that works forsure? Have you tested it?
---
Honestly, when I started the only thing I wanted was to pride myself in getting a higher rank, and if I could, prestige my favourite characters. Since then and becoming part of the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù (Of you can even call it that) I‚Äôve heard nothing but whining from players who ‚Äúdemand to be compensated‚Äù by the devs because they aren‚Äôt creative enough to challenge themselves or want everything easier. 90% of the people who complain I‚Äôd wager would never build a game yet alone cater to every persons whim when they just want more and more. Not trying to be a dick here but it‚Äôs the sad truth, people should be happier with this game instead of crying like people do with larger companies. I love this game, flaws and all, and if making it harder to rank is their plan, so be it, that‚Äôs my new challenge. I‚Äôm not gonna wine about having a goal to achieve. Js.
---
Great now i will never get out of rank 20 because i cant even find games
---
Thank you I missed that.
---
Yep that has been happening to me constantly, no gens, I literally have to follow someone to a gen to find one. It‚Äôs nearly every other game for me.
---
effects all ppl regardless of rank
---
I agree. Sure, they can make it harder to rank up, but the way it is right now relies on a perfect game every time, which is simply not possible.
---
Couldn't do 5 complete gens yourself because killer was chasing you for 2 of them? Too bad you don't get to pip!
---
The system is ridiculous. It relies on the killer/survivor (depending on what you play) fucking up each and every time, so that you can get the best possible outcome.
---
If I'm doing 3 gens, getting 3 unhooks, 2 totems, 4 chase escapes, open exit gate and escape, I should not just be safety pipping.
---
There is literally no point in rank now, unless you have a supercomputer that can play the game for you with such a fine degree that it gets max points in every category, during every game.
---
r/cursedcomments
---
I'm going to ignore everything else here and just point out one thing that seems to have flew over your head. "When you run from a killer for a long time, do you care about him having fun?".... What?? Lol dude that's the basis of the game. You think survivors running away, mid-chase, is toxic?! You're making *yourself* angry in these situations... Its best to cut the chase off in order to refocus and find the weakest link/out of position survivor. 
---
Since when did guys start liking the fat girl look? Lol square chunky hips and legs as big as a rhino‚Äôs just doesn‚Äôt look attractive to me. 
---
What else is he supposed to do? Sit there and die?
---
D: i would never! she's just smol, that's all.
---
Ok, well first thing, you have to admit to lag switching in order to be banned if I remember correct. If they were in fact over ps4 you can file a complaint with them. As for this person actually have been lag switching... I‚Äôm gonna make a call on that and say it‚Äôs 50/50 without needing to see the footage. I see a lot of people (myself included) who‚Äôs internet can drop randomly and get accused as such. ‚ÄúVery obvious‚Äù to some.. for someone like me with a tech background.. Is literally just lag spikes and nothing more.
---
*laughs in shelter woods*
---
Neat! I was wondering how long it‚Äôd be before I saw someone cry about the new killer in new 
---
&gt; damage caused..
---
Wat
---
The balance of this game and the rankings of the killers isnt just math. Its also about the mindgames they can pull off and how players can predict movements etc. If you want to talk about maths, how is plague mathematically better than other killers?
---
I just escaped using Jane with only her 3 perks AND I completed the gen in the Temple solo and still... no achievements... they're just not tracking whatsoever for me right now idk why 
---
It's actually not as bad as duels was. There are plenty of ways to earn cards. Whereas before, you were kinda screwed if you didn't sump money into the game.
---
Lmao he edited it to make himself look like less of a bad guy 
---
yes i understand
---
I'm not saying you're wrong.
---
I am saying that so many people fucking complained about matchmaking queuing into lower or higher ranks, and shittt ping, that when the fix it, everyone starts complaining about the long wait time.
---
It is impossible to please everyone at the same time and this change was an attempt at doing just that.
---
Crybaby.
---
...someone's in their feelings...
---
If it made some shit light up in the middle of the temple when someone is sacrificed sure. Adding another mechanic to buff a stat mid game that‚Äôs level exclusive...Reminds me of Ghosts and levelution. Gonna take a hard pass on this one.
---
Its a PC issue, i should have speciified, no one plays on red and they all dodge
---
what is with the folder called finland
---
I mean yeah, if you really count "shit" as a swear. I personally count it more of a cuss than anything.
---
Which expansion is Jane from?
---
You can tank 3 hits and heal yourself to gain immunity to your next downing hit.
---
That would be incredibly OP. Not only it gives you a free sprint burst and an extra opportunity but it forces the killer in successful hit cooldown.
---
That's like deadhard on steroids and not only that... It's not an exaustion perk meaning you can make even more distance using Lithe / Balanced landing / Sprint burst.
---
It'll probably take the place of the old Decisive Strike. And you'll be able to use it more than once per match.
---
Ah that's too bad. As for if he was actually lag switching I totally understand being hesitant in accepting that without seeing footage first. And I know that lots of salty people will jump straight to that conclusion. I don't know how to upload the footage to reddit, but I will say me and my girlfriend were frequently and very accurately predicting exactly when we would start lagging and stop lagging, so that was pretty suspicious 
---
Yes, it is theoretically that.
---
Theoretically, Leatherface can down the entire time in one chainsaw sprint.
---
The perk is an automatic Dead Hard that you have to build up to, and it can't protect or build of of grabs, or instadowns.
---
 I don't know how much more annoying it'll be than that / Borrowed Time.
---
Friend, im sorry to inform you...
---
THIS is the Mori.
---
Well it could make some areas less dark or it could block certain vaults or it could be something that would benefit both sides. The Game becomes more open as generators are completed it's the same idea. What if it happened for certain hooks too? 
---
*D A R N*
---
I understand where you are coming from. I play both killer and survivor and I have come across toxic people from BOTH sides. The new ranking system just makes this community even worse but honestly, nothing is ever going to get done about it because the devs are just as worse as the player base. Have you seen some of them stream or answer questions on the DBD stream? Yikes. I have learned to ignore it. I play other shitty games or actual good games with friends. Sometimes it is best to just take a break from this game.
---
Tobey Maguire? I'd say he's better than Garfield, but he's got nothing on Holland
---
What's the point of spoiler tags when it's in the actual game for everyone to see!? Spoiler tags seems inappropriate and unnecessary on an accidental release. It's not like no one on the planet that plays this game won't see it for themselves. It's clearly not part of the current DLC.
---
Could have been shroud of separation you know...
---
Idk why but whenever I hear or read 'bing bong boi' it always cracks me up a little haha.
---
Right, because I was talking from the perspective of what BHVR thinks lol. And no one "has" to do anything. Like that's such a pointless thing to say that someone doesn't have to do something. Like obviously.
---
I know there‚Äôs a couple parts of the Temple that open when the gens done, but maybe since it‚Äôs sorta maze like anyways it could ‚Äúre route‚Äù a few walls or something. I don‚Äôt hate the blocking vaults idea either because that temple is messy af with all the shit downstairs alone. Not a half bad idea though depending!
---
Oh ok.
---
really?! weird because i've played every day for a few weeks but i was away about 3 weeks ago for a whole week
---
And what BHVR thinks is where the buck stops, no? And if it's pointless then why did you say it?
---
They are solid but the killer has the whole game to recover/adjust playstyle. NOED is a last minute surprise that survivors have very little opportunity to counter.
---
No its not new ds is trash. With enduring its less than a second stun duration. With all the new requirements and reduced stun time its awful.
---
Im glad its been nerfed but noed should also be nerfed
---
Dedicated servers are not out yet. They've just changed the matchmaking system to load everyone into a simultaneous game queue system to start preparing for those dedicated servers at a later date. 
---
Bhvr couldn't watch ppl deranking themselves to have fun rekting killers so they help em out
---
Yeah. You have to be a supercomputer every match to even hope at pipping. Didn't repair all gens yourself because killer was chasing you for 2 of them? Too bad, no pip!
---
It amazes me how the devs can constantly make such stupid, game-breaking decisions. It's like they live in a separate reality from the rest of us.
---
If they want to make rank so redundant then get rid of it, don't introduce a system that makes it impossible.
---
A 4k shouldn't derank me, that's all I'm gonna say.
---
And right in front of the door, of all places.
---
Survivors when they escape like this: *haha shit killer get fucked* **teabag teabag teabag** *can't catch me boi I'm out!*
---
Survivors when they're camped like this: *oh wow yeah sure just stick me on the hook and don't give me a chance to do anything. coward ass killer gotta camp me to get a kill. what's the matter, can't kill any other way? man you got screwed this match just take the L and don't camp me you pussy!*
---
*sigh*
---
I‚Äôm praying it does, I‚Äôm frantically trying to get Unnerving Presence in my BW just so I can mess with some people lol 
---
That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to work.
---
Sarcasm doesn't come across well online. I'm saying that I wasn't actually speaking from BHVR's perspective. I never said I was. I was saying what I think. And you, for some reason, brought up what BHVR said as if they have proven themselves to properly balance their game.
---
While you are right that they haven't done a good job of smaller balance details, what they think matters. They ultimately make the decisions so in the end no matter how broken or unfun we find a mechanic or perk they decide what to do with it. That's what I was trying to say
---
Best case scenario, that‚Äôs disgusting. Realistically that‚Äôs rolling the dice on everything playing out perfect. Still... God damn 
---
Myers: *just gonna hedge my bets here in case you're doin me a bamboozle*
---
Spirit: [ ( ÔΩ∞ÃÄ–¥ÔΩ∞ÃÅ )Ÿà](https://youtu.be/lEN9gxZkmoM?t=47)
---
I'm saying it's unlikely to work, but yeah, it's theoretically devastating.
---
 All that said, I do think any team running this, Self-Care, and Flip-Flop is likely to be able to give you absolute bodyblocking hell, as needed, without sacrificing much on their build.
---
Hopefully BHVR is still figuring these perks out.
---
My name is not Ethan. But I, too, would like to eat your ass
---
WAAAAAH
---
That was literally the FIRST thing I saw when I played her today. Just a big ol rotten ass tiddy
---
I saw it coincidentally today also.
---
I've played a few killers where the goal was literally to do nothing.
---
Freddy is the only one I succeeded in getting 0 points with.
---
Didn't take pics but I reported each one individually and sent in a support ticket explaining what they all said. Hopefully their incessant toxic rampages will soon be over
---
"You lied to me"
---
Okay. I think they have saved files of their in game chat, but I just think it might be a while until they get to it. Just for the future, it was good that you reported them, and it will be a lot more effective if you screenshot it and send it to BHVR. 
---
That really sucks man. Not everyone that plays this game is anything like that, but I guess that doesn't really matter if enough people are dicks.
---
One of the perks also has fucko in it, although I don't know the difference between a cuss and a swear tbh.
---
Hahah and thanks for sparing me that easy google search I now realise I so easily could've done. 
---
Laughs in Bubba
---
I think its fair because a fully charged (unless changed from Beta, have not played yet) will instantly break the survivor if you can keep focus on them allowing an almost instant down.
---
Fuck that stupid new Matchmaking system.
---
I shouldn't have to wait 5 fucking minutes to open a killer lobby
---
then wait a thousand more minutes for a game because I keep getting players who have 700+ ping and leave.
---
i was gonna post a rant, but i thought this did more justice. i used to be rank 1, and now i'm stuck at 5-6 and i'm falling. they expect you to what used to be double pip every game now. it's stupid. 
---
On the frame with angry Dwight. I can hear fucking battle music from jojo 
---
i was about to do the sweaty hex build too but then tried Legion with Cold Dirt and Joe's Mixtape. still no pip on rank 2. that's insane. 
---
need to do flawless game to test
---
Heh. Glad it's not just me - I was whiffing like a MF last night.
---
Your description painted an image in my head of flushed faced people bashing on keyboards, swiping off desks, throwing coffee and threatening each other‚Äôs jobs! I literally laughed my fucking ass off! And for that I thank you! üò≠üò≠üò≠ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Honestly with how the game is I might just take a hiatus from playing until it's either fixed or changed
---
good idea. i'll test all i can and if everything is broken, i'll just go do some killings on Sims 4
---
If this ‚ÄòBattle of Man‚Äô perk comes to DBD, I‚Äôll definitely use it. Just by looking at it it seems really good with Dead Hard.
---
I wanna see an experienced player do it on YouTube, it sounds hilarious, I‚Äôm too new to use it effectively 
---
I mean spirits dont care much about pallets. Anyway its probably unintentional
---
Ok if you put ash williams, the goddamn king, in the game, you effectively fucked every killer because boomstick and chainsaw hand.
---
Totally agree with you there! I've not seen anyone use borrowed time all day today too.. I run it on my Nea but damn.. Good thing is though I've only had to use DS twice today!
---
One person starts as the obsession, the rest only grab the obsession status when they use it
---
Ive been hit by it and i can legit hit them a second after they hit the ground. Perk is a joke
---
You basically need Gold in every category. That means something like:
---
2.5 gens, 2 Safe Unhooks and a Heal, only getting hooked 1x, and winning multiple chases against the Killer
---
How about when the Killer's DC and the survivors get no progress or blood points? Or in some cases lose a pip.
---
The problem is is that the devs refuse to listen to feedback ever. I don't understand what the point of the PTB is if they never actually listen to anyones feedback. Literally every streamer I ever watched said that the change would never make it to live because it was too overtuned. And again, they pushed it to live ignoring every bit of criticism. They prove more and more every patch that their balancing team legit doesn't know how to balance the game. They just don't.
---
IIRC They've forgotten to put something in patch notes before.
---
Exactly right. I think I'm going to uninstall as well. No point.
---
I have already been enraged beyond belief at the constant infinite loading that forces me to restart the fucking game every two matches. Now this, you can't even have any kind of satisfaction that you accomplished something? I know pipping and ranking was rather pointless to begin with, but at least by pipping you didn't feel you entirely wasted your time playing.
---
Now it's just pointless. I'm with you.
---
I never cared for rank especially after hitting rank 1 and now I really don't. I see almost no reason to rank up now that its rng to safety pip. 
---
So.  Fucking.  True.
---
Hey man, has anyone actually offered you a solution? They updated the EULA so that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs showing up again, everyone had to do it. I‚Äôm on Xbox so I can confirm you will not lose any progress. (: 
---
Lol he's actually in San Francisco right now I believe 
---
The Rainbow Six sub probably had more usage since they too had a fat character added that was (and still is) the center of memeing.
---
That's a significant change and nerfs spirit hard. Her power requires it to be full to be used, recharges slow as hell and she is fairly dependent on it
---
i know what u said was sarcasm, but if totems actually contributed my life would become the whole 9 yards easier
---
A Cuss (this is my opinion/understanding) is a word that you wouldnt generally use in public or a social setting but if you did it wouldn't be a big deal, i,e "I got a lot of shit from my boss for turning up late again" instead of "I got a lot of flak from my boss for turning up late again"
---
A Swear is a word tht's not acceptable to use in those situations under any circumstance and are more personal use. Like fuck or cunt.
---
\*sigh\* This is just like when poor Farrah Fawcett died, but no one cared because some singer dude kicked the bucket on the same day,
---
Yeah, looks like it. Says it only works when / if injured, and it gives them a one way aura read.
---
 If you instadown them once, it'll proc once, it'll proc before their first hook, ensuring they're never hiding again. That's the ideal situation it still can proc in for both sides. M1 killers would likely proc it twice a match.
---
I'm very interested to see how this perk would go down, tbh.
---
Well and pipping was never worthless as survivor. Until rank 7 or 8 my teammates are just absolute garbage. They can be bad at the top ranks too, but at least there is less likely.
---
Now I'll just always be playing 3v2 no matter what.
---
but clown is good
---
Is that common? I've played a lot of survivor today and havent run into a killer DC once.
---
As killer Ive been getting DCs every single game. It screws over the survivors more than me, as I dont care about pipping. 
---
But the fact that survivors think I care makes them more likely to DC now that the killer can't pip when that happens.
---
the winning chases one is a mega fucking oof, but thank you!!
---
Yeaaah, I'm with you. I have been loving the new update, but this isn't cool at all. Out of five games won I only got high enough once to pip, and these weren't easy wins either.
---
Hi with stupid. I'm dad
---
I've got video footage of killers just up and DCing it could be a server side issue. But whichever it is running rampant. My girlfriend and I have had 4 matches in under about 2 hours that have been DC's from who we presume to be the killer. As suddenly her and I are booted back to the menu. 
---
It's with Bill
---
How in the hell did I not see that?
---
Then it was useless from the start and everyone was whining about it because of a .25 second difference? All that's changed now is that it functions more similar to borrowed time and other anti-tunneling perks rather than being an instant free escape. You seem to be more heavily focused on the stun time rather than what it does now. It is still a free escape but yes, that can depend on the killer's build (which has always been a thing, you could always have run enduring before it was changed.)
---
I'd disagree with that first part, her whole mindgame plays around pallets. Hoping it's unintentional!
---
Unfortunately, and it's pretty substantial. I was typically in the 120s or 130s with very little fluctuation during a match, but this latest update has most maps in the low 100s with constant swings in the range of 74-140. The new map is pulling the lowest frame, easily. 
---
How do I upvote this 100 times? 
---
What icon is that? Is it just a cosbole thing? 
---
It could be the same issue on that side, too. The new patch has made it so difficult to pip that it encourages all roles to DC as a "fuck you" to opponents.
---
Read the "Hot Posts," you're late on this one.
---
Whats the bid deal wity the leaks?
---
Cant wait!
---
I gotchu covered, yo. 
---
Legion ruined everyone's game first. 
---
Too bad so few players will be at Red ranks that they will be waiting hours between matches since only a handful will exist
---
Depends on whether you mean just overall best add-ons, or best add-on combinations. I'll assume the latter:
---
Trapper - Iridescent Stone + Bloody Coil; if you play to control an area around a gen cluster, trapping all valuable structures in the vicinity with self-rearming, injuring traps, this setup is very hard to break. Basically impossible for a non-coordinated group of survivors. Alternatively, using Stitched Bag with Iridescent Stone allows you to set traps mid-chase, being able to apply pressure right off the bat and set up the map at the same time, that way. Iri is important here since you don't have to worry about the obvious traps that mid-chase traps tend to be getting disarmed.
---
Wraith - Coxcombed Clapper + "The Ghost" - Soot/"All Seeing" - Blood; this combination of add-ons allows you to both get surprise hits and grabs on unexpecting survivors, as well as use your cloaking ability mid-chase to mindgame on tiles where line of sight is broken. "All Seeing" - Blood is especially nice for those mid-chase mindgames. Stacking Swift Hunts is still good, but for some reason doesn't feel as powerful as it did pre-rework. "All Seeing" - Spirit is a great add-on because it covers your tracking needs and then some, but its impact is more strategical. Windstorms can be used to, well, maneuver the map faster, and to try and cut survivors off of pallets and windows mid-chase, bodyblocking them - I don't want to say that is gimmicky, but it isn't reliable either.
---
Billy - Carburettor Tuning Guide + The Thompson's Mix; faster charge and shorter cooldown make the chainsaw a more effective, relentless tool in chases. Using Doom Engravings instead of Mix makes the chainsaw more menacing.
---
Nurse - Campbell's Last Breath + Fragile Wheeze; 5 blinks is the single-most overtuned, overpowered thing in the game. Ataxic Respiration + Catatonic Boy's Treaure/Fragile Wheeze is very strong, as well.
---
Huntress - Iridescent Head + Infantry Belt; needs no comments. Flower Babushka + Manna Grass Braid/Shiny Pin is a good combo. Venomous Concoction/Berus Toxin are mean, too.
---
Myers - Fragrant Tuft Of Hair + J. Myers Memorial; permanent Evil Within III is definitely the most consistently strong thing Myers can do. With Memorial, it doesn't take too long to stalk there, at all. J. Myers Memorial + Memorial Flowers is the next best thing. Judith's Tombstone + Fragrant Tuft Of Hair is powerful, but far from reliable.
---
Hag - Mint Rag + Rusty Shackles; the trick with this add-on combination is to place only a select few traps, so as to make sure you don't accidentally teleport some place you don't want to. Trap your Hex totems and your hooks - that's enough to comfortably win. You will want to run Hex: Thrill Of The Hunt with this, waiting for the notification of the survivor starting to cleanse your totem after triggering your trap unawares, and then teleport to grab them off of it. At hooks, you want to place your trap at an off-spot, where it will not be triggered by an approaching other survivor - that way you can teleport back immediately after the unhook and get your Make Your Choice/Hex: Devour Hope game on. For less build-dependent add-ons, duration and distance (Dried Cicada, Dragonfly Wings) add-ons are good. Rusty Shackles also works great outside of the Mint Rag combo.
---
Leatherface - Carburettor Tuning Guide + The Grease or Award-Winning Chilli + The Beast's Marks; Tuning Guide and The Grease make the chainsaw a much more useful and punishing tool in chases, and Chilli is actually good when combined with add-ons that increase the movement speed of the chainsaw attack, catching a lot of survivors out not expecting you to go that far that fast. Both of these combinations crucially make it more deadly in standard chase scenarios, like on pallet loops. Long Guide Bar is underrated.
---
Doctor - Moldy Electrode + any of the "Restraint" add-ons; Doctor's base shock range is too short, so he needs a range add-on - Moldy Electrode is the best trade-off in terms of being able to work with your shocks on pallet and window tiles while not decreasing charge speed so much that your timings to capitalize on the shock stun become unfavourable. "Restraint" on the other hand gives you constant tracking on all survivors, freeing up perk slots and actually making Doctor the anti-stealth killer he is infamous for being. None of the other add-ons provide nearly as much value, I think. "Obedience" is good for the Exhaustion effect. High-Stimulus Electrode + Interview Tape is a fun and nasty combo, as well, but very build-specific.
---
Freddy - Class Photo + Nancy's Masterpiece; Class Photo is by far Freddy's best add-on, providing excellent tracking and allowing to sleep multiple people frequently, applying lots of pressure, with which Masterpiece helps a lot. This is especially strong in the late, and of course even more so in the end game, where survivors will have few if any means of waking up, and face the Hex: No One Escapes Death challenge. If you can pull all remaining survivors into the Dream World in the end game, and have NOED up, that results in a win much of the time. Reducing transition time with blocks is always nice, Pill Bottle is mean, and Red Paint Brush paired with Monitor &amp; Abuse (0m terror radius) is fun and viable, depending on the map.
---
Amanda - Tampered Timer + Jigsaw's Sketch/Create Of Gears; now that crouch speed has been reduced and Combat Straps is no longer mandatory, the RBT add-ons are the best for lack of anything better, I guess. Video Tape and Combat Straps are still good, and along with Syringe and Medical File my go-to add-ons for Pig because I prefer the ambush mechanics over the purely RNG and mostly uninteractive RBT mechanics. Amanda's Letter is good on some maps.
---
Clown - Ether 15 Vol%/Redhead's Pinky Finger + Flask Of Bleach; increased affliction duration plus extra-Hindered can turn most bottles into a hit. Pinky Finger is not nearly as strong as Iridescent Head, but still a menace. Having more bottles is always nice, the Exhaustion add-ons are also mean.
---
Spirit - Prayer Beads Bracelet + Yakuyoke Amulet; you can mix and match most of her other add-ons and it will be good, but Prayer Beads is broken. Stacking reappearance (Wakizashi Saya + Katana Tsuba) or activation (Bloody Hair Brooch + White Hair Ribbon) is also pretty ridiculous. Father's Glasses is good.
---
Legion - Joey's Mixtape + Julie's Mixtape; obviously Frank's Mixtape + Cold Dirt is the hands-down most lethal add-on combination for Legion, but playing Legion "optimally" is a bore. All of their add-ons only modify Feral Frenzy specifics, and as such aren't interesting to me - all but these two Mixtapes and the two ultra rares, to an extent. I use Feral Frenzy to injure survivors, and then chase them regularly; Joey's and Julie's allow me to transition into a regular chase without giving the survivors as much distance on me, and they also allow me to use Feral Frenzy to close distances as well as cut survivors off of pallets or window. Iridescent Button is nice because it alerts you to all survivors' positions, and lets you break some pallets for free. Fuming Mixtape is also a tracking add-on.
---
Idk I pipped up twice in one batch but im only r14
---
Shit, man! I love your content, so I'm honoured!
---
Picking up the survivor and making them use it, making them miss it by swinging and distracting, dribbling towards hook? 
---
There's lots of counters to DS, but you're the shitty killer main that can't get kills without being faster and having insta downs
---
It's the new hex perk, "now you see me" the killer calls on the entity to make all generators dissappear for the duration of the match until the hex is destroyed

I mean I play the same as I always have, get decent chases multiple hook everyone sac 3 and let the last one go and I'll barely pip at rank 8. The system is flawed and needs changed, if someone moris anyone well good luck safety pipping, survivors found your hex ruin and busted out all the gens in less than 9 minutes? Enjoy a bronze in gate keeper, killed everyone prior to 9 minutes and have 3+ gens left? Enjoy gold (should be iridescent) the list goes on. This system is bad and promotes farming to rank up
---
Think someone mentioned borrowed time being busted after the patch 
---
The ultimate survivor main is that Dwight who sits in a closet, let's everyone do gens and gets hatch at the end of the game
---
True, I made a post about it. Too I'm gonna be posting videos to show how something is wrong. 
---
I was playing earlier today, knocked down 2 people hooked one person and was kicked to the main menus with the "this game requires an internet connection" my phone and tv still had internet connection as well as my playstation. Servers are just stressed because of new chapter release 
---
Fine, but this does not explain why the Killer gives THAT Survivor a free escape tho.
---
Not very logical. And it feels so bad.
---
Thats why I always go for the hookdiver/sandbagger or the toxic ones.
---
The victim gets the hatch, so he/she does not feel bad.
---
Unfortunately cosmetics aren't possible. 
---
I like the perks.
---
Best comment ive seen in a while
---
Maybe stop tunneling her just cuz her booty is big 
---
I was literally coming here to write this.
---
*HUEEEEUUUURGHHGGG
---
If you never plan on leveling Dwight, sure. Saves time on gaining BP.
---
Leader isn't that great anymore and bond is more for learning the game.
---
Regardless they've done it before so its possible they've done it again. I wouldn't put it past BHVR to make a mistake.
---
Not saying it isn't a bug, just saying its possibly a feature.
---
There‚Äôs nothing in the perk description that says it gives a sprint burst effect or does a successful hit cool down, only that the attack is ignored? I haven‚Äôt been able to play with it on KYFs so maybe it does do that and I‚Äôm ignorant. Even then tho, the killer getting a perma aura reading on you until the next time he downs you is a pretty big downside even if you do get a sprint burst out of it. (Though I agree it‚Äôd be OP.) 
---
But if it just forces a miss, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be used at all. From the description it seems like a lesser dead hard with a huge downside. (Making you the obsession, aura reading) 
---
Already better than most sound cloud rappers 
---
As a survivor I got all gold medals except for 1 silve. And I saftey pipped. Like I get they're trying to fix the ranking system but this just seems broken.
---
Those pants make her look even thiccer and I cant fucking handle it 
---
Im pretty sure the account reseting thing was old and was only a pc problem, besides your account would of already been deleted anyways, it wouldent matter if you accepted it or not. 
---
And now the spirit sound is broken.
---
 The last glass breaking soundbite when you right click to enter the spirit phase is randomly really loud. 
---
I'd hate to be That Literal Nazi, but Legion is good and fun. 
---
The only thing that matters with adept is perks
---
This will be great for Freddy Remember Me perk.
---
Shotgun working like a fire cracker / flashlight where it‚Äôs a one time use stun would be cool.
---
Yea, was hoping it would be footage of people using the perks. 
---
You COULD care less? Huh.
---
We honestly shouldn't have to deal with this stuff. Sometimes I'm tempted to send their post code (You can easily find this stuff out because IPs are pretty traceable) and an recording of it to the police just to see what would happen.
---
Though, very likely nothing would happen, but I would laugh my arse off if something did happen.
---
Before with enduring it was a 3 second stun. This gave survivors an avenue to run a little. Really though most good players didnt care about one ds anyway. It was more multiple ds and the fact you had to take the hit.
---
Now you have to specifically tunnel one guy to be hit by it and the stun time is reduced
---
I‚Äôve played so many games tonight on PS4 where survivors either randomly disconnect or disconnect right away. And the new pip system is so skewed either way you get a 0 or -1 no matter what. 
---
Forreal, it‚Äôs pretty ridiculous. It‚Äôs not our fault if we haven‚Äôt had a reason to do much in the match passed doing generators and surviving. 
---
Like if the killer can‚Äôt hold a chase or can‚Äôt manage to hook or even hit someone, why should that be detrimental to the survivors? That‚Äôs like encouraging taunting the killer for some boldness bloodpoints 
---
It‚Äôs really dumb. 
---
are there fewer pallets about or am I just unlucky in their placement?
---
\+1
---
I dunno if I'd say that quite yet.
---
Holland did a really good job in Civil War/Infinity War, but my god was Homecoming horrible. The reason why I still feel that's relevant was that Homecoming has been his only "Solo" film so far, despite a few scenes with Robert Downy Jr. in them.
---
I don't think we can see just how good Holland is until after Far From Home comes out, though that's just me.
---
I mean whats the plague player's reaction?Saw that discord thing on the left,my bad if thats a random killer
---
*borga borga borga*
---
I just want some Feng skins wtf
---
Its something in the water 
---
Get in line.

The new pipping mechanic is legitimately fucking stupid.

We play KYF in separate channels, so we didn't hear their reaction sadly :(
---
I was the Shirtless David in the screenshot, and I was trying to see if I could get a blind while they were being mori'd, and TIL you can! Lol
---
Evil Dead chapter got leaked b/c the perks showed up in a guy's inventory on console. 
---
Typo, should be "Disappointment Amoung Us"
---
PS4, I played the game after the update
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture.
---
I‚Äôve got almost 300hrs in this game and I agree wholly. Last night me and my friends were getting killers with really bad connection, they were teleporting all over the place, if you were anywhere within 20 metres of them you‚Äôd teleport randomly - madness! But the hit boxes were the worst of it and always have been.
---
fuck did this comment get silver for? i want one too
---
The new Pip System seems fine if you sre a SWF with 6k Hour People but its unacceptable for solo play.
---
i'm better with Fred than with Rin. but i used green add-ons, nothing too op, not a meta build either. and not like i sweated out my win
---
a guys??? its in everyones inventory on ps4
---
They finally gave us fingergun emotes!
---
Nope, The new tall bitch is way more toxic.
---
you are red after few games or you were red getting double pip?

---
And also the hex disappears 
---
I haven't played much of The Plague yet but give it time, in about a week everyone will know how to play against her. Every killer has a flaw about them, it's just using that flaw to your advantage that wins u the game.
---
Just don't abuse the moon walking exploit and be sure to only use frank's mixtape and cold dirt combo sparingly and you're fine. 
---
But ... But Ace Mains are that cool Uncle that's fun to be around
---
i mean, played  the game so much that i dont even reavt to getting fucked over by hitboxes, its been broken for so long
---
I have double pipped two red games, but most are single pips
---
I'd consider double greens an investment.
---
I'd say my point still stands, you clearly played well enough to easily ruthless that game but because of dogshit pipping you only blacked
---
That‚Äôs why it needs a change and the community needs to bring more attention to it
---
Is it possible to be both a daddy and a cool uncle? ü§î
---
just give it some timeeeee, everyone is trying to buy stuff right now it will work later
---
I didn't call anyone toxic here. I just said it's funny when survivors complain about no fun-killers or perks killers use, while themselves giving zero fucks whether killer felt like fun playing against them or not. I am not saying they shouldn't run from killer or stop looping him. All I am saying that's a lot of players have kind of double-standards, complaining about one thing, while thinking they are not part of the problem.
---
Yeah hopefully you‚Äôre right üòÖ
---
Her ass hit the camera.
---
Lucky camera.
---
im gonna miss the times ds and i had *I WILL REMEMBER YOU*
---
But Rank doesn't matter right?
---
right?
---
The survivor match was just as smooth and clear!
---
Her ass is tho
---
Yep. They are doing that to a lot of perks, where they buff the earlier tiers but leave the max tier alone.
---
Well godamm it I‚Äôm really not the only one :D
---
the devs are focused on money
---
Jesus... Dwight please pull the trigger.

dont worry it will fix

---
I immediately thought of this, too. 
---
The problem you are having is caring about pips...seriously, who cares.
---
what the hell are you saying? lol
---
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA
---
He don‚Äôt got ass though.
---
Even if rank doesn't matter, players need positive feedback for what they're doing. If you don't feel like the game is rewarding you properly, even if that reward is meaningless, you'll stop playing.
---
Haven‚Äôt tried nurse yet, I sure hope you‚Äôre right! 
---
well is that new for you?, ive had it like this for a real long time, ps4
---
She is tho
---
 i find it much smoother. 
---
they fix 1 thing, and break 2 
---
I think that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre trying to do is make it where how much skill you‚Äôve got at playing the game. It‚Äôs just they‚Äôre doing it... not good. :/ 
---
The issue then becomes how do you maintain or gain rank after that? Because if you just go back to the pip system already in place then we've basically returned to square one
---
Dwighthub
---
if you talk trash about my cowboy jake 1 MORE TIME.... we will have a duel.
---
I get this error and have to delete files after every single update
---
yeah, current rank system is playtime not skill based :(
---
Because you entered a locker while the killer was looking at you
---
One of the greatest episodes, "that guy has AIDs!"
---
By "strong" you mean brokenly overpowered. Go learn about balance kid. People like youbwere the type who considered the old DS fine.
---
well remove the "pip" system, remove "rank reset", just make it so the survivor will be put in a skillgroup based on SKILL. i think this would be much better 
---
Do we have the same friend?
---
???? she was stupidly good, even debatable she was op, now she seems balanced
---
Thank god they nerfed that shit.

Bruce Campbell tweeted a while ago that he was working on creating some game content for the ED fans. Exciting that it's this game ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
No, by ‚Äústrong‚Äù I mean ‚Äústrong‚Äù. Go learn how to be good at the game, maybe you‚Äôll stop crying about literally every survivor perk, reddit killer. 
---
Herd mentality
---
Now all she needs is a shoulder gun and a set of alien armor and she‚Äôll be the predator
---
Its probably intended. Just look at the state of people on this reddit, toxic survivor mains who love it. These are the people who think its ok to disconnect so their friend can get the hatch.
---
How was she op? Maybe only with beads
---
you didn deserve it, he is the one who played stupid
---
Really? wtf...
---
i though that in ps4 you had the issue where you lose items for no reason at the end of the match, but not about not getting quitter bonus. 
---
I must say it happened to me all the times the killer quitted after the release.
---
you wouldnt want shirtless rin??? and you want shirtless clown??? XD
---
one word: M O N  E Y
---
The main ranking change we need is a reward for being in high ranks
---
I have been saying it for a long time, it's entirely different for solos. If it's a full solo lobby then every person has to find all 5 totems which is bullshit. The least they could do is add a counter, or make it token based. Each remaining totem gives one instadown hit. Don't get me wrong, I was happy with the DS changes, but DS was mostly annoying on already good loopers or when it was unexpected. A bad killer will benefit from Noed easily. No one deserves a 4k for playing like shit.
---
yeah its way to hard to pip, alot of people are 4k'ing and safety pipping, or escaping after playing good and still safety pipping, or even pip down
---
Shirtless Rin would be a mangled sliced up rotting corpse.
---
Tfw your dad asks you for help repairing the car.
---
Most of those things are a functions of killer's skill. You face a skilless killer - you'll have little to no saves/heals. You face a camper - same.
---
And some of them are a function of your teammates' skills also. If your teammate run killer for 5 gens, you won't get chases/saves/heals...
---
So... it's not easy to measure survivor skill in this game, I'd say
---
Kate isn't licensed
---
Its nothing to do with Legion being good or bad. Its that Legion is boring to play against as a survivor constantly needing to mend and if a Legion wants to kill someone they can easily as in frenzy their is not punishment for whiffing a hit so you can just chop away. On top of all that their is a terrible exploit with Legion so you can follow a survivor but make it so your not in chase and their mend bar goes down making it an easy down. 
---
but shes a japanese schoolgirl, and clown is morbidly obese
---
I'd rather fuck a big fat guy than a rotting underage girl.
---
same, i love being on red ranks cause then people don't call me tryhard for skill D:
---
yeah, and alot of players use it when they lose becuase they werent loved as a child
---
Ebonys will always be pretty highly detested and in survivor's defense, they're kind of unfun to play against.  I tend to use them mostly as insurance when I run into a wild herd of Claudettes.
---
That said if you have some stored up and like using them, use them. The people who get overtly angry over it are the kind who'd just find something else to be salty about even if you didn't use a mori. 
---
This is [Clue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPbDmps0jg), OP wants a version that uses Dead by daylight characters. Why they want it, I don't know.
---
Pallet is the killer
---
she aint underage, and clown would surely be rotting aswell, since he is so disgusting 
---
Yeah, that's what was happening to me on PTB... I'll admit I'm more on the side of 'Immersed' survivor because of my build and playstyle (No Self Care/Exhaustion perks or Adrenaline means I really need to play safe...) 
---
But even with completeing multiple gens alone and escaping with the rest of the team, only safety pipping... granted, I was going to put together a more 'meta' build for an easier climb up, but still...
---
I‚Äôm a rank 1 too, but haven‚Äôt played enough to be at rank 1 this season yet. I‚Äôve double pipped close to every game
---
yea but it would be way better then the current crap id say
---
i don't care about it as survivor but killing i prefer red ranks. so not pipping is bit unpleasant
---
She IS a schoolgirl isn't she? And sure clown would be nasty as hell but not as nasty as a girl who is more than likely constantly bleeding out of every hole in her body.
---
oh, well they could have used *ENGLISH* and explained that, thanks for helping
---
i almost double pipped with Legion. but i sweated this one. used all the shit and Frank's. but it was a test  
---
it still wouldnt be easy, they need to change the rank system, check out my post from today, i think they need to make a rank system simular to cs:go and overwatch
---
Swap Evan and Kenneth, and I'm in. 
---
It's not stupidity, I thought it said "do not". You don't need to be mean.
---
Lol. I only ever do it if a survivor team is super toxic and I have put streamers down, especially if its a killer I am learning. Those fools aren't benefiting from my offering then bming me.
---
none of the characters in dbd are underage, i dont know if you know this, but people go to school after they are 18, and clown
---
is NASTY, spirit is h0t and i would smash, im gonna stop talking about this now since its stupid to argue over lol
---
What killers are fun to go up against? Every killer is meant to annoy the survivor it's just Legion make it so you need to be extra careful
---
Not really. Other than Hag and Doctor I personally enjoy going against all killers. Legions ability makes it impossible to be 'extra careful' if he hits someone in frenzy he will then know where you are and he can track you down. 
---
Like I said he isn't OP as you can hide and mend, I personally don't bother healing just get on with gens, but the games are fundamentally boring. A killer finds me off a hit on someone else, tracks me hits me, I mend, killer hits someone else repeat cycle again and again. I am not saying you should DC a Legion but I understand why some people just won't want to. 
---
Think of it from the perspective of someone who maybe has an hour to play. A Legion game typically drags out because of his ability and play style, so you play a boring game for most of the hour you can play just kinda sucks. Plus like I said if they use the exploit then their is nothing you can do and its someone getting a cheap win. 
---
Eh I think this version overdoes it and a fair few of the faces aren‚Äôt even amusing.
---
The one the dev had as his background was definitely far better 
---
Ikr, it doesn't seem to work sometimes and it's not consistent at all. In my 3 Killer matches yesterday with the new patch, 2 survs wanted to stun me with the locker but they just couldn't. And i've seem a lot of people complain about the range of this perk since the Killer always seems so far away for it to activate
---
well the current ones are horrible, making it so casual players that are good also can get a good rank would be nice 
---
Dedicated servers will be implemented in June/July and ping is not their fault.
---
Also "que"
---
Just cleanse totems lol
---
me too
---
The deadites. Basically their version of a zombie which are pretty dope.
---
Or the skeleton army from the third movie. Or Evil Ash from the third movie, but I don't think that will happen because it would be confusing.
---
The killer could be Evil Ash, Henrietta or a deadite. Evil Dead has no returning specific villain so it is possible that Ash has no killer released with him
---
Sued for what, exactly?
---
People always seem to forget that in order to be successfully sued, you have to show either a resultant damage, or an undeserved profit. 
---
While using Predator in patch notes might get a stern letter, a long law suit resulting in 'damages of ¬£0 because no harm was actually caused and no profits directly attributed to its use' is not appealing to anyone.
---
I thought it said "do not", my bad.
---
So we could potentially get ash as a survivor and a killer at the same time?
---
How DARE you put Evan in the no slot hes a whole hunk even without seeing his face
---
Mia as the survivor and (evil) ash as the killer. Lets go!
---
It is possible, but there's also a pretty high chance that it's only Ash
---
So much clever stuff for a spasticated, toxic unfun killer.
---
we currently don't know if it'll be a paragraph (survivor/killer only) or chapter (survivor + killer + map)
---
I also didn‚Äôt so suck it original commenter. 
---
I watched dbd on YouTube for more than a full year until I eventually got it (my laptop was too potato), and Even I myself experienced this in my very first killer game. I played as a Spirit and got 14-16 rank swf squad.. that only made me start learning nurse and shitting on everyone then. I‚Äôm not a dick as a survivor, but as a killer, you can say that the ‚Äúfuture generation‚Äù (aka future survivors) have to pay for what the first ones did.
---
And yes, I do get tilted quite easily. 
---
This is how bad this game is right now. Even trees can't stand it anymore.
---
What would be the point of a survivor only paragraph, all it would do is add a few perks right?
---
The one skeleton playing the bone flute in Army of Darkness.
---
Not to sound like a BHVR bootlicker, but I don't think they actually have much to do with the "official" server. I've heard the mods on there are arseholes though.
---
The fact your trying to justify and think its normal for someone playing in a very toxic way, a way that is deliberately done just to anger and annoy the opposition, leads me to think you probably do it to. Why should people who are trying to ruin my game experience benefit off an offering I put down?
---
So their is no point continuing this but I will say one thing. If you so sure its ok and you want to justify behaving like a toxic ass to annoy someone purely because its online and a video game then try it in real life and see if people think its normal and your justification is fine, my bet is you would get a fist to the face which is why I don't play or talk to people differently online just because of the anonymity. 
---
Make
---
Bubba
---
Shirtless
---
Of course people who play as him will like him. You don't have to worry about getting juked. The mechanics are broken in respect to the basic game.
---
The main thing I find playing against him is that it just is not fun, like at all. I can have fun playing powerful killers who I hate, but legion is just a waste of time and seems like an easy option for any killers. I don't ever disconnect from games - but I have recently with legion. If I have time for one more game before I go to sleep, I'm going to make sure I enjoy it.
---
Ash Williams from The Evil Dead. Pretty awesome (and kinda corny) movies/series. 
---
Put the mist back ): It's bad again 
---
the devs dont play their own game, so they have no idea what they are doing
---
I'd much rather play AND play against Legion than Clown or Doctor tbh.
---
The perk icon for Flip Flop looks like an older Ash too.
---
tell that to bill
---
Was bill a survivor only paragraph? I didn‚Äôt play till spirit so I don‚Äôt know much about that
---
I don‚Äôt care about if for ego, but lower rank survivors are more helpful, considering they don‚Äôt do a Usain at the first sound of a heartbeat ...
---
phew, glad they nerfed Empathy and Wake Up!, tired of seeing them all the time on every survivor...
---
..Oh wait.
---
OF COURSE its ok to PLAY toxic, tbag flashlight click, just like its ok to facecamp tunnel and bm as killer, what isnt ok is ruining the game for eveeryone by being a little baby, harransing players after the game isnt ok, but do whatever the fuck you want ingame, as long as it isnt an explout or cheat, youre deluded if you think that if someone bm's you, you think you have the right to take all they points away.
---
And tmso does the killer
---
Spies from the shadows nerf but no NOED nerf.
---
I dont think the devs have played a single game of DBD, not one.
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
On a serious note, why care about pips at all? Before the patch rank pretty much reflected time you sink into the game, now it reflects ascention level. As a regular player, you don't need to ascend to have fun. I mean, gameplay remains the same, right?
---
At least now "rank 1 btw" won't be a requirement to say some serious stuff on this sub. 
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre... pretty good.‚Äù
---
Yeah I mean I've already been to Rank 1 on survivor several times so I don't really care but this new system is fucking the survivors' ranks up a bit too much.
---
It's like the game expects me to have Chased, Escaped and Bold on max, and 2 iridescent medals for a single pip, and it's not even guranteed! Like wtf that's an insane amount score needed for each category. Welp, not entirely my problem if I don't wanna tryhard for rank and end up playing against Rank 12 killers.
---
It's not exactly an April Fools Prank if it happens several weeks before April Fools Day, is it?
---
taking no effort/skill to force the survivor to GUESS what you‚Äôre doing, no skill involved at all, is not mindgaming.
---
Actually, if you knew the new survivor that‚Äôs coming, you‚Äôd know the trees are actually arriving
---
he's licensed from left 4 dead that's why he isn't on console left 4 dead is owned by valve who made steam
---
Huh, the more you know
---
You didn‚Äôt see the 5 other spoiler posts? ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
hmm... I wounder who he mains
---
again, you have nothing to say so you personaly insult me you know youre wrong but you wont go back since you have a bigger ego than Cuntchido, deluded killer main who thinks spirit is freddy tier cuz you no longer can stand still to trick survivors, for your informatrion, i am indeed a killer main, almost all killers are p3, I bm survivors when they bm me, bad manners is fine and toxisity is fine AS LONG as it doesnt involve any messaging and its only gameplay
---
He‚Äôs a character from left 4 dead. 
---
They could use Evil Ash from Army of Darkness. It would be a unique idea to have an evil version of a survivor as a killer.
---
"I think we did a PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR"
---
Breaking glass from the husk, sounds different from your own.
---
He's one of the original 4 survivors from the Left 4 Dead games.
---
I cant fucking believe these changes went live.. Saw some streamers try her on PTB and nobody though the ranking was reasonable, and it went live...
---
Not going to be Jason.
---
That whole character is undergoing a legal disaster right now. There‚Äôs a 99.9999% chance that we‚Äôll never see him in the game. 
---
Agreed. Too situational. 
---
Are you serious? Are you that sensitive that bm makes you wanna call the police?
---
"I think we did a pretty good j-job so far"***
---
I am currently in military service, and havent played at all since January, so can someone explain me how ranking system has changed, and how it is so hard to climb up the ranks nowdays? Is it harder than before?
---
How is Claudette supposed to see the killer out of the locker when she‚Äôs blind?
---
*Freddy*
---
So we way back in the mine
---
short answer: no Long answer: hell no
---
The stutter says it all
---
&gt; The last glass breaking soundbite when you right click to enter the spirit phase is randomly really loud.
---
okay thats super scary
---
This didn't even answer my question, i never asked when the servers will be implemented. The ping is a 50/50 when the servers comes out if it's a good ping or not, and lastly wtf do you even mean "Also que"
---
How did your comment add anything to my salt/rant. 
---
It was always fun playing her like that though! Ah well, not the end of the world. 
---
exactly, lol

Hahahaha why does that mf just slide along the floor?
---
What were your emblems? 
---
Sorry but now that Jane Thiccness is out I gotta leave everyone else behind, including Dwight. I‚Äôll miss him but it‚Äôs for the greater good. 
---
I have thought about a more skill based matchmaking system for a long time. I have no experience with how other games do it as DbD is the only multiplayer game I play.
---
I have found it to be incredibly difficult to really define and measure skill for an asymmetric game. I believe that somehow it has to be done (and can be done) one day.
---
What you mention though is close to what is represented by emblems today and likely not enough.
---
I believe you‚Äôd have to look closer at how top survivors play and what distinguishes their gameplay from others. 
---
I think that ‚Äûefficiency‚Äú may be a factor, i. e. how much of the match you‚Äòre actually doing anything useful. You often see that high rank survivors have just lost the killer and are immediately on the next gen half-life where lower ranks will first run half across the map to get as far from the killer as possible and heal in a corner, or they leave the gen and run just at first hint of a heartbeat.
---
Also, how long you last in a chase alone is not necessarily a measure of skill. A survivor of higher and lesser skill can last about the same time in a chase (especially against killers of different skill levels), but the lesser skilled will probably waste tons of pallets to last that long where the higher skilled one will be far more ‚Äûresource efficient‚Äú and you‚Äòd have to consider that.
---
I have no idea though if such metrics would really make a good matchmaking system. That was all just brainstorming, I wouldn‚Äôt dare to actually suggest any of this. 
---
Yes, it matters because it affects who you play the game with.
---
I think you will find griefing isn't part of the rules. But hey thanks for the discussion, enjoy your games and hopefully someday you will grow up and realise being a keyboard warrior doesn't mean you can just treat people like crap and in real life you will get shunned for such behavior and belief. Oh also I DC rarely as most people don't feel the need to be toxic scum so a ban is unlikely, you however my friend will be racking up those griefing reports so say hi to Ochido on your way out. Bye
---
How
---
New system is horrendous. Playing survivor isn't even fun because I have to sweat my nuts off just to get a safety pip. Not going to be playing survivor for a while.
---
Thus shit needs to be reverted 
---
Would be cool for Evil Ash, especially if he has a Perk called 'Evenly Matched' 
---
As always, credit and thanks to  /u/ZombieHuggerr for the templates.
---
Just make it like hearthstone with ranks within rank 1 idk why not
---
Spirit is already a difficult killer to play for a lot of people, so the audible sound when she enters phasing mode doesn't seem to make much sense to me. It takes away a lot of her mind game potential. But the power charge depletion when she gets stunned is something I agree with, despite how annoying it is to me in-game. lol 
---
Maybe the audio when she phases is a bug? 
---
You guys are both childish for even having this argument holy shit
---
I‚Äôm just scrolling for more Spirit discussion damn guys 
---
STOP BULLYING PHILLIP!!!!
---
Why can't I pause whenever I want? Grrrr :/
---
Probably shouldn't have been a toxic player and t-bagged when he walked into his own trap.
---
Lol is it his second account or a friend? Pathetic
---
Seems to me that the new system makes it far easier to punish the other team if you wanna be a dickhead. Press Escape and then click leave, gg they're unable to rank up.
---
The sound change is whatever, a decent nerf but understandable (you can still just phase and not move) but the pallet stun reset on power fucking sucks. guess i won't be giving survivors stunpoints anymore
---

Ultra ultra rare momento mori: Just break the survivor‚Äôs game. You just break it entirely. 
---
xbox framerate isnt as shit as fucking ps4. ps4 is hell to play on
---
Honestly I've only seen one other post about this. So don't whine if you don't know why it's out x
---
Runs fine on my xbox one x
---
I think you should replace ‚Äúkiller‚Äù with ‚Äúplayer‚Äù.  I swear this sub acts as if only survivors were toxic sometimes...
---
Well keep licking your friends balls then, white knight. Although by your stupidity I think it's the same person
---
I kept reading hoping to find even one person that wasn't complaining. I don't understand how so many of you are having a hard time with this. I have pipped most of my matches since the patch went live even when I was solo and I didn't escape all of them either. 
---
The problem is now you actually have to try to rank up. Regardless, it was way too easy to get to rank 1 before. I could almost do nothing in a match and rank up, it was ridiculous. The point to the new system is to try and put/keep people in ranks they should be at. And again I'll say I'm having no problem pipping or at the very least, if it's a bad match, then I safety pip. 
---
Maybe once you get up to red ranks it gets almost impossible to pip, but GOOD, that's how it should be. It should be hard to attain that. Thus far it's been way too easy. 
---
The fact that you think anybody that disagrees with you is the other guy‚Äôs friend is pretty delusional
---
I really don‚Äôt give a sh*t what you‚Äôve seen, fact is that it has been posted about 5000 times in the last 2 days and everyone with two working eyes can agree with me.

Wow, thank you so much!!!

---
Mcote mains hag
---
i believe that would be greifing and is bannable, but yeah i hate those survs too
---
Red ranks is impossible to pip, and why should it be any different from purple ranks? I‚Äôm doing the same work. It shouldn‚Äôt be scaled on rank, the old system was fine. 
---
That was actually cute lol, its like they realised they were the coined salty after game sook and had a laugh at the whole thing.
---
Its everyone in For Honor.  *for fucks sake I parried that*
---
did you post this in the wrong subreddit? haha
---
shit
---
Leader boards in games only lead to people gaming leader boards.....
---
The pipping is absolute bullshit. I got a 4k with the last guy disconnecting at the end and I got ‚ÄúbRUtAL kiLleR‚Äù
---
Overwatch? Do you play OW? The ranking system is one of the biggest complaints about that game. 
---
i'd put clown above myers and hag as a tier, also freddy can be in c tier since hs isnt nearly as bad as people say, other than that pretty good
---
But Ace was right 
---
The only Shirlessness I need is all 4 members of Legion.
---
At the same time.
---
In the same room.
---
XD &lt;3
---
I reckon myers should be up there with legion because tombstone and tuft of hair is deadly and with the right perks, survivors have no chance
---
this was the first one
---
April 1st is coming up, just saying. This is either a fuck up or a brilliant mindgame.
---
Got rank 1 doing this last season....I'm bad at looping so I only get chased right at the gate to get out.
---
i didnt say it should be exactly like that, but it should be simular, the same concept
---
Ooh back to the main account, outstanding move from a victim of an unplanned conception

Why you so mad bro, don't want to see the post you can literally scroll by. The internet is a marvelous safe space for people like you if used correctly

Why have you got the wraith in this picture? I don‚Äôt see Claudette

what do you mean? it explains it perfectly, maybe just take some english classes... smh some people on this subreddit.
---
Immersed survivors did sorry
---
How tf you get a gold but also escape? We're you hooked once before getting out???
---
same
---
Yes
---
Love it when the game gives me safety pip with a 4k with three gens left. How is BHVR so absolutely incompetent? I got a bronze in chase because I guess they were too short, and didn‚Äôt get enough devout because someone dced at the very end.
---
I've got friends but prefer killer &gt;-&gt; dont throw killer mains in a category 
---
Bring bubba down and bring the hag up. Idk if your saying that the legion is the best l, if that is the case then, even Franks mix tape doesn‚Äôt make him better then the nurse.
---
motherfucker that guy isnt me, i dont even know him, youre pathetic
---
You did nothing wrong, I am not referring to normal teammates like you.
---
HAHAHA you're a cutie aren't you.
---
Honestly think the hitbox on it got reversed, I was behind a locker and got hit by it but when I was in front I wouldnt get hit by it weird how it worked that way 
---
She can dominate me everytime 
---
Worst part is that when you get the 3 survivor lobbies with only 4 gens it's impossible to pip for everyone.
---
allan please add details
---
I guess its understandable change becouse it was just a guessing game and it was pretty obnoxious to play against.
---
You can enter it and stand still
---
All terror radius effects will still apply to survivors, even the one hit by dark devotion. 
---
Dont chat just leave simple
---
not you, him, he is so sad
---
Cmon guys! This is legion related! Where's the seething rage?
---
Yeah it does it for me.
---
"Survivors found" 2%
---
the emblems are the same on survivor side.
---
on killer side gatekeeper has been changed to a 9 minute time limit. You get scored on how many gens are left after 9 minutes. Devote has been changed to be kill based instead of hook+kill based. 3k silver, 4k gold, 4k with 9 hook events will be iridescent.   
---
The main thing that changed is the pips. As you rank up into different colors (like yellow, green, purple, red) the requirements to pip move up. It starts at the old 6 emblems to safety and 10 emblems to pip, and moves to 9 emblems to safety and 13 emblems to pip. So on average you need to get 3 gold emblems and 1 iridescent to pip.
---
I want to help.
---
well last post he deleted he said that he disconnects from games via the close application so they dont getr any bloodpoints, just becuase he doesnt like the way they play
---
Oh shit dude no, its against the rules to post legion stuff here! :0
---
She has a cooldown after she finishes vomiting, if you didn't know. Also she is slower while holding the vomit with in the live patch.
---
The matchmaking in general seems very weird right now. I've got a few screenshots of the ranks on matches I played last night. Asked people if they were SWF (they weren't). I'm rank 5. On two matches the killer was rank 1/ rank 2 and I had people all between rank 14 - 16 in my team. Another match the killer was also rank 5 or 4 and everyone else was super low. Then another match when I was rank 2, all the other survivors were between rank 1 and rank 4 and the killer was RANK 18. Like wtf is going on. I felt so shitty winning against someone clearly new and I feel bad for the new survivors I played with (clearly were new and hadn't deranked) going against a killer that has so much experience. 
---
Played a match as freddy(was trying a build) went up against a 4man swf. I played super fair and very wholesome, only to get t bagged and flashlight clicked at in the exit gates. Next day, found them 4 times. That's all I'm going to say 
---
a good SWF isn‚Äôt a pip heaven either. If you do well (not a lot of downs), no one will pip
---
So basically my entire dbd loading screen is cursed
---
I Just love getting a 4K 4 gens remaining almost every chase won, being away from the hook bc BBQ and Devour Hope but going back bc I'm chasing someone and getting a black pip.
---
Yep, if Rank 5-8 you need 4 Gold Emblems for a Pip and if you are Rank 1-4 you need 3 Gold + 1 Iridescent to Pip.  Basically you need a Perfect game to Pip.
---
The new requirements are so absurd that nobody will be Rank 1-4 and hardly any will even be 5-8
---
Don‚Äôt bother mori‚Äôing anymore unless you can get all 4. Only 3 was barely a safety pip
---
!remindme 5 months 
---
I'm sooo confuuuused &gt;_&lt;
---
Idk what happened there, but her puke doasn't instadown at all.
---
The fact that this game which doesn‚Äôt look good to begin with needs to be run at sub 1080p on a pro in order to get a stable frame rate is a joke. 
---
And that's why i play legion also it's probably the shitty ranking system
---
Complaining dumbasses be like
---
It's weird for both killers and survivors right now. I haven't played killers since the new ranking system (just for dailys where I'm barely trying), but I had a couple of good games as survivor where everyone played really well. Nobody got hooked and we just did gens. Killer was not good at chasing. Depipped. I guess we need to get caught and unhook each other to pip? :S

I'm gonna address the placement in this comment
---
Legion: No I'm not saying legion is better than nurse. The addons change the way the match goes pretty drastically but he is not the strongest so I just put him in his own tier.
---
Nurse: It's nurse piss off
---
Hillbilly: His mobility, the ability to instadown and break pallets with insta chainsaw addons make him a very strong killer.
---
Myers: Instadown built in, insane snowball potential, early game threat with tier 1, addons that impact the game drastically
---
Huntress: All around balanced killer with counterplay on both sides. Iridescent head, infantry belt etc.
---
Spirit: Great mobility with the right addons, beads make her a threat and something survivors need to adapt to.
---
Leatherface: Instadown and all around alright.
---
Clown: The ability to slow deny some areas with his bottle make him a good killer in the right hands. Some of his addons would put him in a higher position but I decided not to. Because he still gets looped and if you're not good then you're in trouble.
---
Trapper: I think the traps are great and his red addons are AMAZING but some trap placements are too common for survivors to fall for them. And if he doesn't have any traps set he is just a wraith then.
---
Pig: Amazing in slowing the game. Ambush can be ok against worse survivors. Traps are pretty insane in slowing the game down against worse survivors.
---
Hag: Most people would call me mad for putting her this low but I don't see her as THAT strong. She can be with the right setup and mint rag rusty shackles are great. But her other addons are pretty eh and don't really change the gameplay compared to some of the other killers.
---
Doctor: He is alright at slowing the game down and iridescent king can change the game to the doctors favor. But he is still a m1 killer with a power that works from time to time.
---
Wraith: He really has nothing going for him. Although he is one of my favorite killers I just needed to put him down this low. He really is absolute garbage without addons and really needs them to win at higher ranks.
---
Freddy: Same as nurse. There isn't anything to discuss here.
---
What they should really have is two ratings.  One for people who‚Äôs egos depend on ‚Äúranking up‚Äù the other one a hidden one that is what is actually used for matchmaking 
---
She keeps trying to sneak past Billy, but she's dummy thicc...
---
They want you to not tunnel, slug or camp (not saying you do). It‚Äôs how I‚Äôve always played. You need to be aggressive at all times, pressure gens etc
---
But isn't it a good thing that getting rank becomes harder? People are being matchmaked by rank, and there were like a real lot red rank potatoes. I was a rank 1 usual on killer/survivor before, and how I hardly get a pip on purple as survivor but honestly I'm not a pro so it makes sense 
---
You're also competing against your team for a pip it seems like. If you all play "perfectly" (as in you don't get caught, finish the objective and gtfo) you depip because everybody is also doing gens lol. It's very fucked. 
---
Time doesn't matter in Entity Land so it could still be his girlfriend/sister. Or it could be Henrietta, the wife of the professor from the basement.

*ruin instantly breaks*
---
You realize that now??!!
---
I totally agree with this. Literally nothing matters accept getting the kills and the best way to get them is to camp because the survivors camp hooks and as soon as you go back to patrol that survivor is gone and 3 gens are done and you've basically accomplished nothing. Now if you chase and patrol and do all the stuff they want you to do you will get a ton of blood points like this but you probably will not 4k and you may even lose rank. On top of that killers are the ones who get flamed for camping and securing kills but we literally HAVE TOO.
---
I mean... the only emblem that remotely helps is gatekeeper, but that depends on the timing of the Hatch Escape. Let's not even talk about how bad Chaser is now, though. Before, I'd do well and score Gold. Now, I can smash a team apart and barely get silver. 
---
Another angle - https://imgur.com/gallery/TqdTat1
---
Oooo okay lol I wasn't sure if the game fucked you over
---
yeah, but still this is getting out of hand I personally like these nerfs. also what you just said changes this conversation, that's just toxic to leave in a way that the killer gets no fun nor points unless you have a good reason of course
---
It‚Äôs a good meme template 
---
&gt;do something to piss killer off 
---
&gt;facecamped in basement 
---
I dunno why, but, yeah, like every game now feels like ‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôre 4 minutes in aaaaaand that‚Äôs the last generator.‚Äù Like, the game is too fast, and just adding delay perks isn‚Äôt fucking helping, BHVR. 
---
In two of the games I played as survivor yesterday I escaped and depipped. We played perfectly in the traditional sense of nobody actually got caught or chased for that long (I lost the killer). I think because nobody got hooked and there was no saves, and I didn't get chased for too long and didn't do more gens than the others I depipped. It wasn't the most amazing game or particularly skillful on my part but I at least did better than the killer and still didn't pip. That's a weird system to me. 
---
I swear I was just thinking this 
---
It sucks for casual players who still play well, because now we're being punished for not being super sweaty and aggressive. We need casual lobbies if this ranking system stays.
---
Omg thats so true
---
I got Enduring so he's bout to be in for a very bad time
---
Me too i'm so dumb

---
Also take a Hag for example, she's dangerous on her part of the map, but she has absolutely no control over the opposite side of the map, she's more of a 3gen killer
---
Kinda better i guess, more ppl in green- purple ranks which means faster lobbies, and being in red ranks would finally mean something 
---
Feels like it now

Lmao

Ace Main, big brain

Had a game load in with 3 last night and just groaned when I saw it. 3 survivors had used bloody party streamers so we tried to make the most of that though. All did really well and had both exit gates open and then came the lag switching. I guess the killer lag switched too hard because it booted the other two players out the game (so they don't even get their points :/) and then I went from being standing still to being on the hook. Multiple bans on record on their steam and people like that are still playing, ugh. Sorry for the off topic rant I'm so angry still lol
---
#GROOVY
---
The system is really bizarre. I was trying out plague last night, got a 3 kill and barely scraped a black pip. Weren't they balancing the game around getting 2 kills not too long back? Seems counter intuitive.
---
Are you guys on ps4? I really didn‚Äôt notice but will try again later today
---
Well I agree killer shouldn't get rank for disconnects as it doesn't directly related to their skill, but disconnects should be punished harder too
---
I addressed this all in a comment of mine. I got distracted and forgot to post it.
---
They should just add ranking rewards and a casual mode 
---
I had this twice yesterday, at first I thought the killer DC'd but my friends were still in the match, yet it made it seem that the killer had DC'd so I was able to see the killers perks.
---
paint me *lik*\- \*snore\*
---
Haven't seen enough and not going with early release or ptb information. My guess would be low A or high B
---
I'm not sure if this is true but I think enduring 3 makes it 1.7 seconds not 0.7 seconds
---
I heard. She was fine, just wtf?!
---
I love cause it is easier to derank now :)
---
Why do people bully people? Is the question you‚Äôre essentially asking - some people are just... *shit* 
---
Yea tbh I don't even want to touch killer with this new system because it looks annoying af. I also played against a killer yesterday that dominated us, got a 3k and barely pipped. I'd be more frustrated playing killer with this system because it's already stressful and then not have your efforts rewarded is just meh. I don't care too much on survivor but for the people that care about their rank I feel bad for them. Super hard to pip as survivor too, even if theoretically you did well in the match. 
---
Well I guess that's why the Plague died from disease
---
Or maybe now the ranks actually have meaning? I‚Äôd rather a rank 4 that‚Äôs crazy difficult to earn and maintain than a rank 1 that‚Äôs literally meaningless. 
---
I've only had a few games so far since yesterday. I did get a 4 kill game and didn't even pip. 29k BP I dont camp or anything got in chases ect. It won't make me quit the game at all but it was frustrating.
---
If I have two people hooked in the basement, what incentive do I have to leave without at least fortifying the area first?
---
when you start phasing, you hear glass shattering over literally any sound in game. and phasing overall is very loud.

I don't see clown that high because (and this may be because of me) I haven't really been in a "real danger" against clown. If I'm facing Myers I fucking know the threat of EW3 so that's my preference. And yes I know freddy isn't that bad but I put him in his own tier because of this reason.
---
What's good about other people suffer?
---
I addressed why legion is in his own tier in a comment. I'm just slow to post it.
---
Too true. Have my upvote. 
---
You too, OP. 
---
Im pretty sure
---
i dont like the change either. it's a welcome change that they want to make climbing harder, because how easy it was. so at higher ranks we'll see skilled players instead of people that just played a lot... but imo its way too hard to rank up now.
---
with climbing being this hard, people wont pick lower tier killer as often... the hillbilly number exploded yersterday. got him like every second game. this will lead to a lot of complaints and/or rebalancing
---
"Datamine"
---
While i kinda see a point here, most people that still play Legion ( i quit because, even though i play him normaly, it just feels bad to play with as them) are usually human scum that will immediately switch to moonwalk strats if you run them too long. So sorry i don't want to endure that so you feel better about your purchase.
---
The same amount of work goes into purple that is needed for red. I still need to do x amount of gens and saves. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to scale the pips based on rank. It causes survivors to compete with each other for points, force gameplay, and also makes little sense that if I do two gens, two saves, an exit gate and a chase in purple I would Pip opposed to if I did it in red I would safety. It‚Äôs a poor rework and needs adjustments. 
---
Lol ok, salty killer main? Did you step in your own trap too?
---
Also change their terms and conditions back, make money honestly not by making us pay to have our data sold off to advertisers.
---
Before this patch everyone was crying that ranking up was too easy and that ranks were meaningless. Now that it's harder, everyone is crying that it's hard.

100% steller ad hominem there, attacking me instead of the argument were I actually present the math. Showing that given the OP's conditions that he should have pipped.

There is a gigantic difference between Tough and Fair/Common Sense. A game of DBD only has 5 Gens.

\-If even 2 Gens get finished while you are getting chased you are screwed. You consider that fair?

\-Or how about you can't Pip unless you teammates get hooked a lot.  Your teammates are very good, then you can't Pip because you cannot unhook them.  That seems fair to you?  
---
\-Teammates disconnect or Suicide. You can't Pip because you lose unhook opportunities. That is fair to you?
---
\*\*It defeats the purpose of a ranking system if everyone is at the same Rank because nobody can consistently Pip or it takes an absurd amount of time to go up 1 Rank.  Also, good luck to the poor people who do go for Rank 1 and realize they have to personally plan which day they can play together since they are the only 5 people at that rank

I mean it doesn‚Äôt happen when you‚Äôre in her terror radius.

what?

Perish. 
---
Skill difference, so you don't have to complain about bad players 24/7
---
The heck are you on about? These are so beautiful to look at and clearly were made with care. Give yourself a pat on the bag for me.
---
There was no terror radius heartbeat or anything, unless I'm missing something. Usually you hear the sucking noise when she's near and phasing. Last game, only heard it once and the rest of the times she was just suddenly in front of me.
---
F for the ppl who got to red ranks before the update 
---
Perfect example of a Ps4 Pleb
---
Look at Quentin
---
Your logic is basically: 
---
"Everyone says 3 Point shooting is too easy now, let's make it harder by moving the 3 Point line back to midcourt"
---
"Why is everyone complaining, they said they wanted it to be harder, and shooting from halfcourt is definitely harder!"
---
with Behavior it's always one step forward and several steps back with every update they make. oh well, i don't even know why i care about ranks, i should probably just start ignoring them
---
Considering it was one of the employees of the studio itself that leaked the roster. Yeah that could‚Äôve happened 
---
Unless you are a bad rank you need either 4x Gold Emblem to Pip or 3x Gold and 1x Iridescent. This means to Pip:
---
\-Do around 2.5 Gens
---
\-Safe Unhook 2 Survivors + Heal them
---
\-Get in Multiple Chases that have Multiple Escape Victories for you
---
\-Get Hooked 0x or 1x
---
GUESS I'LL BLIND PEOPLE TRYING TO SEE THE NEW MORI
---
Why waste say lot word when few word do trick 
---
Better out of the system matey!
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve had my fair share of annoying Killers. There‚Äôs no end game chat, but thank goodness for that. The tunneling, facecamping and so on are pretty irritating. And the killers who constantly hit you or barf on you even though you‚Äôre already on the hook are even more annoying. I fail to see how DS was supposed to be toxic in comparison. But idk, that‚Äôs me and I haven‚Äôt played too long. 
---
Never said he wasn‚Äôt. I main him. I have at least a few hundred hours of practice. Trapper *can* do this. You shouldn‚Äôt look at no perks no addons as a liability but just how the game is normally played. Perks and addons are just power ups.
---
You would pip in purple ranks. They expect more in red. 
---
Somebody‚Äôs forgetting about Jeff 
---
I would say no. Plague without effectiveness add ons is kinda weak 
---
Kinda I mean. Is face his a little scrunched up. If that‚Äôs how he‚Äôs gonna look like he‚Äôs gonna be like Tapp. From a distance you can recognize him but up close you know it ain‚Äôt Glover or Campbell.
---
Why the actual fuck would Jason Voorhees be the killer in an Evil Dead Chapter?
---
No shirtless Billy? Give that baby some air! That tank top is way too tight.
---
Hhhh thanks for the response. I'm going to def struggle then. Never really get into very many chases nor do very many unhooks...
---
This helped a lot, thank you sir!
---
Ok so if we took out the timer completely we would have infinite pallets with a 60 second cool down. What the fuck are you thinking lol?
---
Lol, thought this was about Python
---
Mcote isn't a lead designer though
---
I was around when the Clown was "leaked" at E3 or whatever (when they gave out those cards showing the Clown's finger key ring) and they'd ban you for posting those images.
---
You know: the images that were circulating around everywhere and were offically provided by Behavior?
---
There's "leaks" and then there's "denying offical PR material provided by BHVR."
---
I think one of my friends got warned when the SAW chapter was coming out for speculating that McCote's "I want to play a game" Twitter post (or whatever he said) was hinting at a SAW chapter. Got warned for speculation.
---
Contrary to people that complain and don't do shit - I haven't played the game for some months, because of bullshit like decisive strike (even though i play more survivor because of long queues on killer) - but - what was nerfed on it?
---
It's just that we are not satisfied with many changes in the past and we question whether the devs even know what they are doing with their game anymore. 
---
The whole community was against the new ranking system, but nevertheless it is being implemented into the game without any changes. Even though it might be an unpopular opinion, I think new DLCs (new killer, survivor and map) just aren't doing it anymore and are underwhelming as heck. It's not just the ranking system that's pissing us off and makes us want to leave the game. 
---

Crashes are common after new updates
---
Try turning the console completely off then holding the power button. This will bring up safe mode commands. First try rebuilding the database. This will take a few minutes and will not delete or change anything. Your game icons may move or change order but there is no real change from doing this.
---
If the problem persists you may need to reinitialise the console, this will delete everything so make sure to back up save data. Once done, reinstall and try again
---
I kept crashing every 5 minutes with this update but rebuilding database seemed to fix it
---
Lol confirmation bias? I never read this sub so I have no idea what people hear think. The one time I've been here before I complained about killers having it so much easier and got downvoted so I assumed everyone disagreed with me. Don't say shit when you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
I think some of Bill's Prestige cosmetics have swears in their description. They quote Bill's Left 4 Dead voice lines and swears sometimes in them.
---
Well yeah you also need sugar, spice, and everything nice. If you‚Äôre feeling a little spicy add a little Chemical X.
---
yo, thank you salem. thats all I needed. I appreciate it!

The trophies are broken right now

Yep I have had survivors dc as I didn't let them use their decisive strike.

Idk I got both trophies yesterday just fine. I actually got janes by escaping out the hatch. 
---
I don't think you even need to add cold dirt, just using Frank's is enough to turn Legion from a potential threat to a tunneler's wet dream (although the Plague might take that crown). 
---
Shit's broke at the moment
---
God damn, thank you, I thought I was the only one; I'll stop trying to get them for now, not worth the hassle then
---
Hype hype hype hype hype 
---
They didn't nerf them

Get your facts outta here he‚Äôs trying to VENT!!
---
Spies wasn't needed. They added a cool down just to avoid spams
---
Thank you! thought I was the only one, hopefully it will get fixed soon :)
---
So?
---
Received, thanks!
---
The problem is that almost never the 5 totems will be broken in solo matches.
---
Yea, the plague is gonna get nerfed
---
Thanks :)
---
Occasionally they need to succeed in skill checks, lest they get too excited and accidentally yell "BANG!" and alert the Killer.
---
I could get behind this change.
---
Thanks for the psychological analysis, doc. How much do I owe you?
---
Adrenaline 3, yes please 
---
Yes but unfortunately if it‚Äôs not a complaint it‚Äôs in one ear out the other with these people. ‚ÄúReD RaNkS dOnT mEaN aNyThInG‚Äù ‚ÄúWaiT No NoW iTs  ToO hArD‚Äù
---
Haha just making a joke. Poor ash is going to a place far worse than the entitie's realm
---
oh i see. Well it kinda fixes half of the issues with it, let's test it out in game!
---
Thanks for the update, Neko. You're awesomeow.
---
That moment the devs make reaching rank one a legitimate challenge to help with match making and the entire community throws a bitch-fit because they need easy success. 
---
Preparing for the downvoted but in case there is anyone from the team reading I just wanna say I don‚Äôt care so much about that stuff I have a genuinely good time just playing the game for hours on end when I stream it and the rank goes by unnoticed.
---
Argh, why does every other character get the skins I want for Jake?
---
Yeah it does seem to demand a lot from both sides now. Yesterday I had a match as survivor where I got almost 27k points which was barely enough to get one pip.
---
same for survivors as well üòï
---
Overcharge is now always the same skill check too
---
Are you kidding me with this shit?
---
The entire lifespan of the game has been casual, now they make it so the highest ranks aren't casual, and people are upset that it isn't casual, after people complain ad nauseum about how rank means nothing. This is cognitive dissonance of incredible proportions. 
---
Lower ranks are still casual. But there has been absolutely no tangible meaning to rank for the best players. Now, if you get the pip, you know that you dominated. There's actually meaning. The chaser emblem seems a little fucked up(the 4th one) , but the other 3 seem fine. 
---
You shouldn't be able to get to red ranks easily. I'm glad that there will be less red rank players and that the highest ranks will now encourage higher level gameplay, not people running meme builds and face camping. 
---
I agree just play it people or don‚Äôt and leave 
---
For real. 
---
There's always one of these wannabe tryhards on hand to let us all know how totally awesome they are and it's totally not a humblebrag, bro. 
---
3 survivors feels the worst it‚Äôs ever felt. 1 gen isn‚Äôt enough to make up for it in my opinion.
---
I played a game to try out vomit mama and one person didn‚Äôt load so we just farmed bp because I didn‚Äôt want to faceroll. 
---
Can you link where you found this? 
---
Really cool
---
This game's update process has always been a mess. Having to fully reinstall the game each time is a bit overkill.
---
But does it still work? Or is it just the description that's fucked up?
---
I really don't get killers that tryhard when it's 3 survivors. I actually main killer and I have never killed survivors when this happens. Yeah I pretend to chase them in the beginning because normally survivors don't get that you need chase points also, but after I hook the first one I make sure they understand I just want to farm with them and hook each twice before letting them escape.
---
It's seriously terrible. The moderation on the DBD Discord is the second worst I have ever seen.
---
The *worst* I had seen was for an indie game I enjoyed. I won't go deep into detail but I left the server after the server owner threatened to ban me for telling a professional player to stop harassing newbies. The server owner had warned and threatened me several time for "toxicity towards new players" when I complained about newbies doing stupid shit in the game. My complaints would never go beyond "shit teammates throwing my games reeee" but this professional player was something else. He'd literally invade discussion channels just to tell noobs that they were shit and would never get good. He'd talk about subjects he had no authority in just to harass people who were trying to learn the game. The game was a MOBA and the pro player was a tank main: he'd go to the text channels for Support and DPS play just to tell people that they were shit and would never get good at the game like he was. Whenever he was asked for advice because "if you're so good why don't you tell us what to do?" he'd just blow it off and insult people some more. The best part was that this guy was a bench player who was only part of his team as a sub. His team had never won a tournament either: they got some silvers but never gold.
---
Regardless it was a clear massive double standard. It was a constant problem on the server that pro players could get away with literal murder while the average person would be banned if they said hello in the wrong way. I left the server after being told by the server owner that I *shouldn't* tell people to respect the rules and didn't look back. Later on I met some of the normals from the server in-game and they told me that the server owner was literally banned from her own server by the game developers. They also said **in their own words** that "there was a second 'offical unoffical' Discord that was basically the 'fuck (moderator's username)' server."
---
I don't know why I told this story but again: Dead by Daylight Discord is the second worst Discord I've been on when compared to *that* shitshow. I am only "banned" on two Discords: the one for that indie game (wasn't banned I just left the server because the owner was a toxic Nazi) and the Dead by Daylight Discord.
---
I think it would do Behavior good to make a new server that **they** own and create a more positive environment. The current Discord is a toxic shitshow where people get permabanned for accidentally saying "kys" instead of "kyf" and inversely people can spam the chat just to attack others and not even be warned until they do something that's against Dead by Daylight's EULA.
---
nice job on devs 
---
Not only Spirit the sounds are f\*cked for all killers.
---
The old one was trash too, change my mind. 
---
Dwight thicc heratic
---
The owners of the Evil Dead franchise won't shut down a Discord server because people talk about screenshots.
---
Good, no free escape for you
---
Man... Imagine if we actually got the Robert englund model for Freddy. Would raise him at least 3 spots on the tier list
---
You either haven't played the game or never made it past the green ranks if this is truly your stance on the matter. 
---
I think they mean that if something is leaked they should just let the leak flow instead of trying to shut down free speach.
---
I think the best compromise would be to have Small Game have a totem counter. With SFW doing totems is almost trivial since you can tell people how many you have cleansed. In solo it's a pain in the ass since you don't know if any have been cleansed unless you see the broken totem later. 
---
The devs keep making pipping based on the team. How many unhooks can you get, how many gens can you do. Well if the teams good you don‚Äôt pip, they won‚Äôt get hung that often, if the teams bad you all die, no pip. Killer disconnects. Lose a pip. Survivor disconnects no pip for killer. 
---
You stay hidden and play safe, your team is dead no gens done. You play aggressive get unhooks, then the killer tunnels the injured survivor hangs them up. Everyone‚Äôs healing then hiding. No gens getting done. 
---
The pipping needs to be based on an individual survivor. How many great skill checks can you hit with hex ruin, without hex ruin, how many times can you circle a pallet without dropping it. How long can you run the killer (while your team hides). How long you can be by the killer without being spotted. 
---
As long as your doing something productive for 90% of the match you should be rewarded. 
---
I try to do a little bit of everything but even dying with 20k having done a little of everything no pip. 
---
Base pipping on the player not the team. Bold maxed that‚Äôs a safety pip, or Objective maxed that‚Äôs a safety pip. Both almost full should be a pip.
---
I do want it to be a challenge to get to Rank 1 and not be Rank 1 just because you play the game. But if it could be point based that would be better. 12k for a safety pip. 14k for a pip. Something to keep the active players that play the game in the same player type group and not a punishment by giving them survivors that are urban evasioning everywhere not doing anything. 
---
I‚Äôve played all day and literally only pipped when a pig ended up wanting to farm. And just barely made it. 
---
Kindly go fuck a cactus
---
Paid still broken
---
But if you rank up, you should vs better killers too. Why would you still need to do EVEN BETTER to rank up more when you get better killers? That doesn't make sense to me.
---
I mean now Rank does actually mean something is the thing. The problem is that it either means that you cheated the system or are an anti-fun tryhard.
---
High rank should mean that you're good at the game. Not that you know loopholes in the ranking system.
---
Thanks for playing along.
---
OP had the blindness effect
---
Sorry. You‚Äôre the mod that removes posts that shouldn‚Äôt be removed so I just put two and two together and 
---
how is ping not their fault?  why are they matching me with people from Asia and Europe and vice versa???
---
One of these things is not like the other
---
Now do one where "Okay team, we need to figure out who sprung the leak"   
---
Bill: Because someone fucked up 
---
Meg: Because the codes got jumbled and we sent the wrong ones in
---
Ace: Because you fired that one dude who warned you ahead of time about firing him...
---
\*Throws Ace out the window\* 
---
Technically it would be a public release, not a leak. I mean they put working perks, with proper icons and descriptions in the PS4 build which they released.
---
BP&gt;Rank
---
Thats all
---
Lol people that say this have no clue what they're saying. Literally the best players in the world (at this game) are struggling to rank up. Not a normal a struggle but one that again is too hard and not good for the game. As killer you essentially have to farm...same with survivor. But hey, if that's fun for you (playing the game the least efficient way possible in both roles) have at it. 
---
It makes people feel powerful. 
---
To repeat myself: there's a difference between "harder pips" and "literally playing a perfect match and safety pipping."
---
That‚Äôs less lag and more the vomit having some of the worst hit boxes ever, I‚Äôve hit people point blank and missed and I‚Äôve also hit the wall next to them and it‚Äôs landed. Needs some major work 
---
I‚Äôve been doing the absolute most I can in my games and still haven‚Äôt pipped once and even de-pipped. It‚Äôs a joke.
---
Hyper brain
---
ExperienceS
---
uwu
---
It was just a one time thing, my PlayStation is kinda crap and crashes games randomly sometimes, not super often.
---
Nah homie it‚Äôs hard with most killers to stop the gen rush, even with ruin ‚òπÔ∏èüò±
---
Where have you been
---
It‚Äôs not it‚Äôs just the cheap way
---
ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Either way mori crushes my spirit
---
My killer queue times take up to 10 minutes currently and it‚Äôs a joke, they need to sort this shit out pronto.
---
I‚Äôm honestly dreading dedicated servers as at this rate they‚Äôll fuck it somehow
---
Oh yeah you're right. I always saw Julie in the K but never the others for some reason.
---
Also oof seeing 6/10 on Steam when I Googled the DLC for the logo.
---
The new requirements require you to play the game in a less than optimal way with arbitrary requirements and you will be punished for playing well in most cases. It's asinine. I can't wait to be a rank 15-13 next season according to this with 3400 hours. I'm sure survivors that just got this game will love to be matched with me as a result of this system.
---
tbh recovery progress should be a default UI thing that survivor teammates should see
---
Shhh, we don't talk about that here. Killers are still oppressed and we need to keep nerfing survivors, it's fine.
---
could you share the files of the locket? i want to use it on After effects to do an animation
---
Works hard to make update
---
Mess up because humans aren't even close to perfect
---
Get ridiculed and spit on instead of constructive critisism
---
Cry?
---
yeah, personally i strongly dislike other people's enjoyment, so its gonna be fun to watch innocent people suffer for trying to enjoy something i like in a way i do not like lul
---
That is kinda confusing. I found the patch notes on steam after your comment and... damn, how do I "regress" some perks? lol
---
My favorite part is the 'expected wait time: 10 minutes'
---
Breakable perk. Nice 
---
Yes but that only means you can‚Äôt see auras 
---
as much as i agree with the fact it must be harder i disagree with this outcome in this particular match. i don't do sweaty builds more than like once a month for testing or removing frustration. and this match was a good skilled match against swf where i played Spirit and 2 p3 Claudettes having Iron Will. everyone had decent amount of points in this game cause i don't camp or tunnel(the least was 11k). and me not being able to pip is kind of upsetting. 
---
i played a game of Legion with Frank's and this is where i got a pip. and swear i didn't cheese out chases or camped but i dislike the build and killer. was just a test. and i don't want to bust my ass off to get my red ranks. you feel me? i was a red rank killer before Clown(with old bps and pallet vacuum) and this new ranking system is offensive.

---
the hits will be fixed in dedicated servers
---
amen. i don't want to face less skilled casual players because ranking as killer is fucked. no challenge means no fun to me
---
Why do they downvote you? Since DS came out its a super controversial perk and now its finally at its right place people downvote you for having an opinion everyone has for a couple of years?
---
You can derank without dc'ing.
---
Only d'bags will DC at the beginning of a match.
---
why is everyone buying stuff? are the new cosmetics out? pls say yes
---
DS still retains the normal increased chance to become the obsession. 
---
Oink 
---
Gotta be honest: as much as I hate old DS this is a nice fucking meme.
---
Not OP of comment but I tried playing new killer, said it would be 10 minutes, tried survivor and it said 8 minutes but only took like 2 but the Ping was yellow/red and I got camped hard.
---
Oink
---
I agree with all of what you said except about the Plague. She is easily the best killer in the game on console and probably the second best on PC. She combines elements of the pig, shape and huntress to extreme effect when played right (which isn't all that difficult to do) and has 115% movement speed to boot.
---
Your best play when going against her is to play as immersed as possible and try to not get infected otherwise she can easily begin to snowball.
---
It IS cheap. ‚ÄúOh I see no other way then to play Merry Go Round‚Äù 
---
Exactly! This was more me waiting for the other injured guy to escape, and Leatherface just happened to make me laugh with that head shake.
---
Interesting, would you put her mid to low tier? I agree that she is a bit dependent on her add ons, but I‚Äôve done pretty well with just brown or yellows. 
---
reddit wont let me post the video, will try again
---
Civilization apparently
---
It happened twice with two different killers
---
I've been tunneled by plagues quite a lot at rank 7, granted people are now falling back in rank so it's probably too early to call at this point. DS is good for dealing with that until you realise that they're corrupted and don't even need to chase you to down you.
---
Have you ever had someone threaten your or your family‚Äôs lives? Threatening to kill someone is not a fucking joke.
---
No I'd put her mid tier. Of course mid tier varies for everyone since everyone has a different opinion on tier lists but for me I'd say she's right under Myers, competing with clown 
---
I don't mind it but I'm not going nuts over it. 
---
I run no mither and I need to play It safe. Rocks Are great For blocking The Killers vision of me
---
I can definitely see that, thanks for your view
---
She's definitely stronger than huntress. She has machine gun hatchets and 115% movespeed like what? How is that worse than huntress?
---
an obsession is still randomly chosen, but can change upon DS being used by someone else
---
This one in particular is a hard pass. BUT I do appreciate BHVR trying to make rank mean something, but This new system needs tweaks. Shit is ridiculous
---
Eh.
---
128 meters is essentially a full map anyway. You won't really see a difference.
---
It's exactly the same as it was before,but it was just made more consistent with other perks.
---
Oh ok good
---
Then gives up and decides to reload hatchets
---
Can someone tell me the reasoning behind queuing up to enter a lobby that you host as killer? Why have an extra step/wait time? 
---
No way... 3 party streamers and the killer lagswitched ? Disgusting
---
It was map wide before :(. I guess 128 is map wide though
---
And that's were I think the rank reset and new rank system comes into play ...y'all realize that if someone is camping tunneling , they just got to that rank because if they spent that much time on you they'd barley safty pip ...rank 1 killers survivors pretty much get the new system and it's hard for a survivor main , I can only imagine a killer 
---
I‚Äôm a rank both 1 literally after one week each season
---
That‚Äôs good news. Mind games are her thing. 
---
Probably because the Freddy vs Jason vs Ash comic states that Jason is a Deadite because in part 9 the Necronomicon can be seen in the background inside the Voorhees house. Slim chances though. I doubt it's going to be a full chapter since none of Ash's adversaries are as iconic as the other licensed killers or even Ash himself. I think it's going to be a standalone survivor
---
Oh that's cool
---
When i first played dbd i really wanted to be at rank 1
---
Once i was i found out that there are so less people up there and the queues are horrible. When i want to play a fair match i see some guy with a 400 ping that annoys everyone.
---
I havent played dbd for a while (am rank 17 now) and i like it more then on rank 1. Not everybody is a noob (there are actually many people who should be rank 1) and i enjoy it more.
---
Its bad for new players but at least thats the sign they shouldnt put that much time in this bad awesome game
---
if there is no reward, why care about which rank you are atm? isn't it better to make rankings good before you maybe could not reach the rewards you want?
---
Same happens to me, Opening up to killer and while playing hag, all 4 of them got out and I walk over to the gates having a good ass time bagging and in post game chat was nothing but me being told to delete the game even though I‚Äôm rank 14. Some people need to get over themselves
---
I'm actually rather hesitant about the Evil Dead stuff. All the stuff I love: the boomstick, chainsaw hand, one liners, Campbell himself, and the general zaniness will be missing. 
---
I honestly think they should've reset everyone's rank to 20 with this patch so we can all experience the new system properly rather than deal with people playing like idiots.
---
Shift + Space is the correct order.
---
not much to say about it really
---
This.
---
Also, when not in a full SWF, you're probably going to have the easiest totems cleansed, leaving only 1-2 well hidden totem and increasing the chance you never find that NOED totem in the endgame. 
---
Those are situations when it would have been better to not do any totem to have a chance of it spawning on an exposed totem in the middle of the map rather than behind that bitchy swamp map corner huge ass tree. But since you're not in a SWF... that urban evading Claudette is just going to cleanse those obvious totems you wanted to save for the endgame.
---
Oh? It ‚Äòmust‚Äô be done in that order? 
---
I was pressing them both at the same time. 
---
Yeah... Huntress on console is a joke.
---
Its wonky I dont know where its suppose to hit honestly 
---
Sure let's change it. Give the Pig The Doctor's Laugh and the Doctor the pig's stun noise
---
Agree to disagree- the time limit and activation requirements for Corrupt Purge weaken it enough. If everyone stays Broken all match, it turns her standard attack into a chainsaw hit- every single hit is an insta-down. 
---
In order to pip from rank 5-8 you need 12-14 pionts if I'm not mistaking ...that's pretty much 1 irridecent and the rest gold's  ...I'm not complaining at all because I like what's it's doing for the game ...but regardless of skill level that's pretty insane that's why I said close to impossible ...I'm a survivor main but I can only imagine how it feels to be a good killer ..mybe it's easy maybe it's not ..but I believe they just need 3 kills to get a pip 
---
But even toxic survivor mains will get screwed eventually, and they won‚Äôt get points either, so no one wins most of the time
---
Lol you thought immersion was bad? Wait til you see the new unhook meta. You're going to get farmed hard. 
---
I got a 4k at rank 8 barely got a pip, this system is terrible for anyone who should be higher in ranks 
---
Glass breaking sound when entering phase (survivors can hear that) and power charge deplete on stun
---
This. Is. Awesome! The amount of detail you put into this is phenomenal! Nice job.
---
they just put a new patch ffs
---
So how was your last game before you saw my notification?
---
No, that‚Äôs good- bloodpoints are better than a slight chance at a certain map. Hope that helps, my man!
---
What did they change? 
---
"Deathgarden 2"
---
Given that the internet exists I imagine he's having a field day right now. Though then again I suppose San Francisco is more of an urban area.
---
Thanks! Glad to know the effort didn't go to waste.
---
‚ÄúAs he‚Äù count: 5 times in 2 paragraphs
---
Ok sure. The streamers say rank doesnt matter. Devs hear said streamera say that. They say ok we'll open the rank play system up meaning lower ranks can be seen playing with red ranks. Then on top of that make it harder to leave general ranks 8-12 ish via either depipping or actually winning. Please counter argue.
---
Nice another rupail dbd Cross over
---
140 hrs, am still noob: can you flash light stun out of Mori?
---
I do the same. I purposefully walk far away from hooks to go break gens and dropped pallets, and if more than 1 escape I can expect the chat to go wild with all kinds of slurs and aggressive flashlight spam

You are clearly new to the game. Feel free to return to this conversation once you‚Äôve gained some experience from the survivor side.
---
So happy to hear this.
---
*happy pukes*
---
they didn‚Äôt actually change the perk, only the description.
---
If it‚Äôs cheap it‚Äôs cheap and no skill comes from it 
---
Shes my favorite killer , She can do so much different thing with her kit but most of all : i love the cute pallet stun noise üê∑
---
Especially since they don‚Äôt tell you what ‚Äúin range‚Äù means
---
No one will be able to play weaker killers now unless they don‚Äôt care about rank. At high ranks, it‚Äôs going to be all Billy and Nurse. You won‚Äôt even see many spirits because she‚Äôs slow and they messed with the audio. Any killer that can‚Äôt travel the map in an instant is going to suffer immensely
---
this is actual good shit op
---
Knowing BHVR, it wasn't a leak.  It became a feature.
---
Downvote all day everyday for the attitude
---
\\o/
---
Bits of the system already made no sense but now it‚Äôs just broken
---
Thank you for the confirmation!
---
Should I give up hope for a Shirtless Ash cosmetic?
---
Omg kane why
---
It's kinda weird too, because I saw a lot of people complaining about this system on PTB, so I'm surprised it made it to live.
---
I'd argue about Noed though as it's not that hard to counter and it is really fragile. Mori and previous DS are definitely bullshit
---
Immersion as in doing nothing but hide. Not doing gens until someone gets hit or not at all, not going to rescue but urban on the side of the map while the killer isn‚Äôt even close to them, healing for more than 30 seconds before doing anything else, going down 10 seconds in a chase or wasting 5 pallets...
---
Doing gens, you
---
All good, it can be rectified but it requires them to actually put dedicated servers in as matchmaking with someone in Spain p2p isnt pretty but servers help a little 
---
Listen buddy, it is very much possible to track in the corn, it's not completely solid, if you have good differentiatetive (probably not a real word but you get the point) vision it's not hard.
---
I just can't perceive Ash being in the game and have him *not* be the Killer to the Killer
---
You‚Äôre right, it isn‚Äôt.
---
thisguy right here has the best answer for the rankingsystem imo.
---
Yeah I don't know. Like 95% of the internet getting a boner for fat asses just seems weird to me... I mean I don't have anything against a nice booty... But Jane here... That's not a nice booty that's a fat ass
---
This is awesome, how do we make it a thing??? Get this to behav. I reckon it would be terrifying playing against this killer. The suspense of not knowing if the other survivors are transformed killer or not would bring a lot of the fright back for long time players.
---
Some of us like the competitive aspect. Ranking up is fun. We play good and we are rewarded with higher ranks, which theoretically should mean we would play with higher skilled people.
---
Someone crying about stealth nerf to spirit and an argument started then ended with probably the funniest conclusion 
---
Ofc I alternate between rocks
---
Nah it makes you healthy, and this was also mentioned in the dev stream prior to release; it‚Äôs intentional
---
I think killers should get more credit for later dcs. It‚Äôs bullshit that a survivor can disconnect and make me lose the points I was going to get if they weren‚Äôt being salty.
---
i see them in the corn, blink to them, get fatigued and they‚Äôre gone somewhere and i have to walk track their scratchmarks to find them again.
---
It took me awhile to realize that‚Äôs ace and not jeff goldblum 
---
"Perhaps" - Alabama 
---
Am I the only one that doesn't care about it this all? DbD players have a lot of double standards.
---
"Rank doesn't matter!" - "It's too easy to rank up, I play with/against noobs all the time!" - "it's too hard to rank up!" - "Ranking is pointless because there is no reward!"
---
I'm not gonna protect BHVR, because the rank-system is not flawless or good or whatever. How could it be? This game is asymmetrical, you can't balanced it and you NEED your mates for a good score. But I'm so tired about this constant complaining. 
---
There will NEVER be a good and working rank system. It is just not possible. And if we could just stop pretending that dbd is a competitive game, it would be alright.
---
That is intended
---
It's all in good fun, I've done dumb stuff too as a killer. You should see me trying to master nurse..... All in all you have to have a thick skin for this game. If not don't play it. 
---
I love all these rank 15 killer mains with their hot takes about how it's "balanced" that the totally neutered new DS has had it's stun time nerfed and is now countered in it's entirety by a perk that they're probably running anyway.
---
Ranking doesn't work like this in any other game. Through winning/losing you get compared to other people. Both teams in this game can literally lose right now. How is it possible to play a football match and have both teams be declared defeated? This is nonsensical.
---
Here is what's gonna happen. Rank 5 will become the average highest point anyone can reach reliably. And nobody will give a shit because there is no reason for me to be rank 1. I get nothing anyway.
---
Oh but wait... mm nobody can get rank 1 you say? Well it's time to implement rewards that would otherwise cost them money!! They have to please the crowd after all. Bonus corporate points for Beehive.
---
My point is, if they keep this new system, even less people will care about rank. But if they introduce rewards, you better be sure they are fully aware nobody can reach them - it would be just a way for them to say "see? we gave you rewards like you asked".
---
But I'm pretty they will lose more if they try to pull this shit.
---
Ah fuck! Just when I was liking her. I mean she‚Äôs still my favorite, but I guess that explains the lack of survivors on a currently being worked on gen when I phase walk up to it
---
You are obviously mad and you express as such which is quite obnoxious. Though i do agree to an extent as i like it how the skilldifferenses on the lower ranks aren't crazy anymore. Though i'd like it if you happend to become the genjockey of the match that the objektive perk was a bit more rewarding.
---
The game is actually called **Dead by Daydwight.**
---
I have PS4 but don't realize why should I have any desire to say bad things about Xbox and especially about Xbox players. I don't have Xbox afterall, what can I say about it? 
---
oh oh I know this! Corpse riding a invisible magic carpet!
---
Who cares? Everyone has T3 ruin anyway. Making it so perks actually do things at levels other than 3 is a quality of life change.
---
*YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!*
---
No but they will get very pissed at BHVR. There could be financial penalties or at least a sore working relationship going forward.
---
&gt;Only d'bags will DC at the beginning of a match.
---
Sounds like the typical streamer to me.
---
exactly the point. i have both and they both have there flaws and both have their good points. but i guess people just can‚Äôt stand others having a different console 
---
Can confirm, I have very little problem tracking in corn generally
---
I don't have an issue with it considering I don't care too much for rank but the new ranking system is absurd considering you can do things in a match that would normally guarantee you a double pip from completely dominating as a killer or being well rounded objective and altruistic and survive as survivor but only safety pip or just about barely single pip.
---
Why nerf if you can counterplay her without notification? I'd say she is well-balanced right now (apart from Prayer Beads) 
---
Hopefully they at least try to get him on board. The guy that plays Quentin had no idea his character was going to be in a game.
---
Daduncle and Unaddy
---
Stop it you madman
---
I hate Urban Evasion too, it really is trash.
---
Being the poowerrole =/= being overpowered, cause that's what Noed is. And before you call me a Clueless Survivor main, I'm wraith main. 
---
Not sure why anyone here thinks this is toxic. If you DC it is kind of sad. Sure you might have a valid reason but overall it looks like you‚Äôre being a dick. Not like the killer said he was a baby or even insulted him whatsoever. 
---
Red ranks are impossible. It also just makes no sense. A good killer game can end up brutal because you couldn't get enough hooks. A good survivor game can end up with a -1 because you left too soon. It is quite literally possible for both sides to depip (not just black) and that should never be a possibility. That's just not how competition works, and we are talking about ranking.
---
I'm not mad at all actually, haha. Quite the opposite! I found myself deranking previously because I HATED being in red ranks. I knew for a fact I didnt belong there and was being outplayed every game. Now I dont have to. My decent skill level matches my decent rank just fine now. I'm in the middle. And I'm happy everyone elses does too. That practically eliminates boosted ass killers. Which drains the fun from the game.
---
This is what i was thinking but then it still took five min to find survivors :/
---
That doesn't mean it should be boarderline impossible for your average Joe to reach high rank, like it feels now. The game should reward multiple playstyles. If I don't get chased by the killer because I've pulled a big sneaky on them, I shouldn't be punished for it. Currently, the game seems to reward SWF even more now... as if Solo Queue survivor wasn't difficult enough. 
---
I noticed this as well, but specifically it only happened on the Mount Ormond map. I wonder if the snow overlay has something to do with it?
---
I guess trying to outrun the Plague towards the end is what lost me the Emblem points. Alright, I‚Äôll keep it in mind for future matches
---
You basically cant get bronze emblems, or silver. From what I've gathered and correct me if I'm wrong, but you need golds and iridescents.
---
Addons in 2019? LOL you have to be dogshit
---
Or the map could be made with placeholder tiles using existing assets especially since the Red forrest map is being reused for the temple and the art team can work on individual tiles later.
---
ah well that seems logical, i myself hate to play survivor for the fact of that my team usually doesn't really help or they do EVERYTHING so i can understand ya.
---
What's wrong with Bubba? You mean to buff him BHVR should remove Insidious so basement camper players will have to hearn how to map pressure 101 and become a decent players? 
---
It doesn't seem that hard...
---
Dick still hard! Thank you!
---
Doesn't seem to have happened with the Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street or SAW leaks.
---
I‚Äôm going to try to main her. I like the idea of the mechanics.  Any pointers? I usually main MM or Pig.
---
Also hate new matchmaking
---
I was just about to comment that
---
I just play her because her outfits are actually decent lmao. 
---
Oh, now I get it! Anyway no no, it's not like that, but I took this picture in a dark room so colours and black were all messed up
---
Since *every single one* of them has a way to be countered or prevented, yes?
---
rip
---
Ah alright. I saw another post with invisible gens but haven't come into any personally. I'm on pc if it matter.
---
She doesn‚Äôt shoot things, so.... sue me
---
THANK YOUUUUU. your post was a little less sassy than mine. But you and I agree 100%
---
I don't think I've ever heard it described like that. Isn't the go-to pear shaped?
---
Or they're just paying homage to that reference while making it the younger Ash Williams. But whatever route you wanna go with it.
---
I don't understand what your point is then. Survivors at exit gates are still 'playing the game'. They can come back in and help or distract if anything goes wrong. 
---
I'm a Pig main, but I don't see how survivors waiting at the gate is wrong. I admit to myself that they're pretty much a lost cause, but there's a chance they may come back in for an unhook, so they're still possible prey.
---
I admit teabagging isn't very nice (but also, as a killer, I don't really care? It's not like sending salty, nasty messages, which is FAR worse, but happens a lot), but OP didn't teabag in their gif here. So what is your complaint? 
---
I had same thing happen to me, definitely not bullshit, the system needs to be fixed 
---
Well rest assured one of those is a killer main. You can clearly see that the game cannot progress unless huntress moves or turns around. And the Meg shouldn‚Äôt have jumped down but It is what it is
---
I know it says it is an Ash perk, but what I'm saying is, maybe they were allowed to make perks for him, but not release him as a character. 
---
Or just a few seconds, depending on luck. There was too many times when I was playing survivor and have seen a dull totem become lit right before my eyes
---
Yes. This system eliminates boosted killers. If you play like a rank 8, you will be a rank 8. No more weaseling your way to the reds.
---
This system is just going to put many veterans of the game in Yellow ranks, these ranks are meant for newer players and will often match with brown ranks. Players that have been playing since beta with thousands of hours of experience like myself are going to have incredibly unenjoyable matches as a result. Nobody new will like facing me and I'm not going to get any enjoyment out of facing them. At least old red rank meant you put some degree of time in the game and understood at some level how the game plays out. Now all of that is going to be jumbled.
---
They say if you close your eyes as it swings towards you, you feel immense calm, because for a moment you think it hit you and you died
---
Pointing out the ridiculous amount of contradiction in this shit of a community. I highly appreciate the downvotes though...and also those that are getting in their feelings and using vulgar language towards me....you guys are the real MVP of toxicity lmao
---
Damn if I do and damn if I don‚Äôt 
---
I'm with this guy
---
And you think that will prevent them from calling you out for some other made up reason?
---
Nice job
---
That‚Äôs.... wow that‚Äôs dumb.. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Sorry wrong killer. 
---
As an add-on it'd be nice. Too powerful to be part of the power normally though.
---
Congratulations! Maybe we can get the people from Ripley's to do an expos√© on you and your otherworldly skill.
---
I agree. They should give him the shotgun perk which allows you to blow off one killers head once per trial.
---
Yeah I'm a Pig main and all these horrible design chases make trying to enjoy her more and more of a pain. BHVR genuinely has no idea what they're doing, I swear to god.
---
Comparing the ease of finding 1 glowing totem to a total of 5. I have seen more people cleansing now, but i have also seen a lot waste time to check an area and find the totem is broken.
---
Nope
---
Between "imagine" and "omegalul", both of you are walking cliches.
---
They haven't updated the text from the PTB.
---
Question about the Plague: if you get everyone sick and then they use up all of the fountains without you ever taking them, will they eventually run out of fountains, and be permanently broken?
---
r/centaurgirls
---
NSFW, duh 
---
I know its intentional. Its just stupid.
---
One person starts this counter to small game and everyone thinks it's the hottest thing under the sun. Bloating up a perk with new effects to please a select part of people  (in this case totem hunters) is not a good way to go about it.
---
If Evil (Deadite) Ash is the killer we could still get all that. The face on one of the leaked perk's is clearly Campbell so the devs have the right to use his likeness. So why couldn't they use his voice too? Campbell has said he was working on a video game. Now we know which one he was talking about.
---
Gens are probably getting faster due to a combination of being on the Red Forest maps all the time (and how insanely large the Plague's version is), and the possibility of people not wanting to play as aggressively since DS is gone. 
---
Made me snort, üòÇ
---
IM SICK AND TIRED OF THIS FUCKING COMPANY, YOU'RE TRASH! FIX THE GAME! AND I CANT STOP PLAYING! CAUSE IM FUCKING ADDICTED!
---
(or something like that)
---
                                -Tyler1
---
True, I just really wanted to throw in a reference that was somewhat suitable :p
---
What else are you gonna do while the exit gates are already powered? Probably sitting near the hooked person waiting for a chance to save that'll never come, yea that seems more logical to do.
---
i've played some killer games i managed to pip and double peep just fine when killing 3 or 4 all on the 3rd hook. if for some reason people die on their first hook , expect safe pip or less. survivor on the other hand felt fucked up for me, there was plenty of games where i did saves, got chased, worked gens resulting on a 20k plus matches and only safe pip thus far, didnt managed to pip up even once in about 20 games. i'm all in for a harsh ranking system, but c'mooon, it might be a little bit too much imo 
---
I mean 2 of the perk icons relate to old ash, so I highly doubt its just a reference and more of, it's old ash.
---
Throw the whole post away.
---
I almost started running my mouth üòÇ. I didn‚Äôt read properly
---
Tbf you can still mindgame. Just start phasing but don‚Äôt move.
---
Also her add on where you‚Äôre supposed to see blood trails when phasing isn‚Äôt working either, tried using it last night and it threw off my whole game
---
Use the new DS then, lmao. And that isn't broken, it's just the killer playing scummy.
---
i hope you realise that survivors instantly join after the lobby gets made. the wait time isn‚Äôt longer.
---
Brand new part is way way too powerful of it still insta-gen.  But insta-heal is fine as it is, I play both sides equally and when I'm killer and someone has insta heal I'm not bothered that's fine, I'd rather that than insta-gens.  Imagine four survivors each with brand new part, game is over before it begins, would be unfun and pointless.  
---
i do use new DS. 
---
Just to clarify: you don't agree but also don't want to continue discussion further?
---
Put it this way, his icon looks more like Bruce than Laurie looks like Jamie Lee or Tapp looks like Danny, as if they made an actual attempt to recreate his likeness vs. creating a completely new one. Regardless of whether they did it well, it looks like they based it on him instead of inventing their own face like with the others.
---
With how badly the game already performs on actual current gen consoles I‚Äôm seriously interested in how it will perform on a console that isn‚Äôt as advanced
---
Gonna get hate but survivor/killer player here in pretty even on both and I always play how o would want killers to play against me, plus with the new update killing 1 person doesn't matter a shit. I dont really care about tunneling cause like why wouldn't they go for the weakest, but face camping/hard patrolling is bullshit in my opinion. If a survivor dies on first hook then either their team is shit or the killer is camping way too hard
---
i was able to blink above the roof in certain places before february.

Map is a bit too generous in it's size, i always hate bigger maps with multiple building and second floors since non-mobile killers will struggle hard to put pressure on survivors. Other than that the chapter is great and a much better addition than the last.
---
I didn't even notice that until you pointed that out

I'm just surprised you didn't notice the "Survior" lmao

The only one powerful enough to defeat Legion by ascending into the sky as a god. He requires more sacrifices to fuel his divine methhead powers.

Bullshit man, its either a bug or you're trying to play us for a fool

I can see fine on PS4
---
And xbone i just checked
---
&gt;So nerfed and buffed.
---
I believe they call that balancing
---
i wish, man, i wish. it's literally what i got today. have full screenshots if you care
---
Billy's chase music in particular for me. He'll be around and just all of a sudden, no terror radius music. Then it comes back after I think he's left but he's been like, right on the other side of a tree, 2ft away the whole time.
---
If u vomit on them enough they get broken status and you will only need to hit them once.
---
This achievement is basically 4k 15 times. Yeah maybe you'll get a 4k after all the gens are completed once in a while, but this is nowhere near as hard as Evil Incarnate. 
---
&gt; there was a counter to DS. Enduring &gt; DS
---
Enduring merely shortened the duration of the DS. The couple of seconds it bought a survivor to find another strong tile to loop was plenty enough that Enduring wasn't as effective as people thought it was.
---
&gt; when in reality their problem was over commiting to chases they cant win
---
This isn't true. Many rank 1 killers would either disregard the obsession or just slug them and never pick them up because the time and pressure lost with a successful DS.
---
&gt; time management is key
---
Of course it is, but it's gotten ridiculous how simple time can be wasted and for how long.
---
&gt; if you are getting looped by a better player and you decide to over commit to that
---
Even without factoring the DS in, it has to be noted that the killer being forced into giving up a chase because they're being looped too much is a silly idea. We're talking about a bloodthirsty killer hellbent on slaughter and sacrifice, but seeing a window and a pallet just makes him go *d a r n* and walk away. It turns the game into a silly game of tag where the "base" is all over the map and they can sit behind the safety of a tile and blow raspberries at you.
---
Seems like poor design if you ask me.
---
Yeah but I still don't get why nerfing it. Her mindgames as they are now are a major fun factor of playing against her, at least how I see it. Feeling of unknown, many killers lack it
---
Interesting point point but counter argument have you ever seen Quentin‚Äôs shriveled ass?
---
I agree, though it's just hard to appreciate some killers like Pig, because they need time and effort to get going with them, so people that actually main them see more success than other killers that you can pick and drop at any time (not saying those killers cannot be improved and their powers perfected). For example, before i saw a video on Pig and how to correctly use her dash, i almost never used it or used it wrong, making the killer that i actually enjoy the feel off, become unplayable to me. Now, even though i still kinda struggle, i have gotten some sweet mindgame hits, so yeah, very solid killer but any tweak buff would be more than welcome.
---
Not only this, but remembering when the game was free on PS Plus, unsurprisingly it was a total shit show, the game stopped working for pretty much everyone for days and almost cause cooling fan mass genocide. They were so ill prepared, hopefully we will all be pleasantly surprised but I‚Äôm not holding my breath.  
---
Never trust a Michael. They are always scary, even when farming with you lmao. Super unpredictable.
---
Can we just take a moment for all the poor souls that want to get the adept achievements now. 
---
Wear camo leggings so it looks like you‚Äôre floating
---
sorry not enough hooks 
---
But the change post said "After successfully using Decisive Strike, you will immediately become the obsession". So I shouldn't be the obsession until after I use it, not from the start of the match (and the killer had no obsession perks either).
---
LMAOO would be a good one
---
well 1 shot takes less effort than 2 shot, so surely less reward is deserved?
---
I remember the days of pre-nerf brand new part. I've also been on the receiving end of a 4 man SWF popping 4 gens simultaneously and gathering for the 5th. 
---
My premise was to keep the items powerful while bringing them in line to be used in a more thoughtful manner rather than "well let's just insta heal, that'll buy me at least another 30 seconds in this chase".
---
That ain't a glock.
---
10000000% ruined.
---
Jk chief
---
I don‚Äôt know why people play like ~~OchiDO~~ that, it‚Äôs so fucked
---
And it's the same on the survivor end. If your teammates don't ever get hooked then you won't pip. If the killer chases you too much and your teammstes crank out gens then no pip for you. If 
---
Sometimes I'm glad that the killers/other survivors cant hear the things I've said in matches and this is a prime example of one

It's not a bug for them to "fix" as you say, and imo it is not a needed change, there is no reason to force a survivor to get to boxes the pig can easily patrol and just play the elimination game as more boxes are used.
---
It's been like that since pig came out. 
---
I'm getting run around a loop because I have no understanding of chase mechanics or how to use my power to break a loop, must be poor game design haha
---
i‚Äôm going to sing this to my boyfriend later to irritate him. LOL
---
We're talking about letting the leaks run around on an ostensibly official community thing, not just that the leaks happened. Although any financial penalties wouldn't be publicly announced unless the rights holders were really pissed.
---
Also the SAW leak came after the official teaser. For the rights holder they don't really care about the mechanics, they're trying to build up hype for their franchise. Release dates for such materials are a whole coordinated carefully considered thing. A Nightmare on Elm Street was datamining, and was just "Sandman". I can't find any information on a Halloween leak, although apparently the Hag got leaked through a daily ritual which is fun.
---
Hag cab still get looped if she doesn't use traps, spirt I forgot, clown can only sometimes. Point is almost all killers are looped 
---
Dcs should provide small bonuses to emblems, after a certain point in the match, because survs can dc to fuck over a killer trying to get a pip
---
"Teabag this bitch!"

I noticed this last night.  Not sure what we're really trying to accomplish with this.  Before, when I created a lobby, I'd always have four survivors in there in less than a minute.  In the post game, the ranks would be mismatched all over the place.
---
Now, when I "find a match," I wait five minutes, then drop into a lobby as normal, and then wait another minute for players to file in.  In the post game, the ranks are still mismatched all over the place.  And, to be honest, I think the survivor pings in the lobby were much worse than usual.
---
So, basically, what we have here is:  an extra four to five minute wait that doesn't seem to be necessary before creating a lobby like usual, only to wait another minute for survivors to file in (like we used to), only they've got crappy pings which gives me an unfair advantage.
---
To boot, like some folks have been saying here lately‚Äîeven despite that unfair advantage, they still manage to kill the early game more than they did before the update dropped.  I think they're spawning closer to generators or something.  I don't really mind that, because I couldn't care less about "winning," but it really does seem like the early game has been accelerated somehow.
---
Excuse me? It's like 10 seconds apiece, and you get a ton of BP for it
---
Hopefully never. I know this is a bit of a controversial opinion but I am personally not a fan of dumbing down all the cool addons.
---
I liked when you could kill with Mori instantly and I hope they wont remove instaheal either. 
---
BNP was too OP in my opinion but I feel like now it is too weak for an ultra rare.
---
on occasion, yes I do mistake them if they are at a distance. If I hear terror radius, I know for certain though.
---
I‚Äôm just referring to the extreme probability of survivors disconnecting. It‚Äôs no issue of getting the 4K before the last gen pops.
---
With Evil Incarnate, you only need one game where all the survivors don‚Äôt disconnect. This time you need 15 games where all survivors don‚Äôt disconnect. I‚Äôve played 5 games so far and only one didn‚Äôt have a disconnecting survivor at some point.
---
I haven't seen green ping since the new matchmaking went live.  Only about 1 in 5 matches was yellow.  I used to get greens and only a few yellow.  Now it is either play with Mr. 350 ping or don't play at all.   Also haven't seen a match that didn't have wildly different ranks. "Rank doesn't matter" indeed. The system just doesn't seem to care who it pairs you up with anymore.    
---
you don't need 4 gens to pip as red rank. 
---
It is actually possible for all 4 survivors to pip in red ranks. Each survivor needs 2 saves, 1 gen, to live, and then chase (or be chased) by the killer.  This would give them silver (2 points), gold ( 3 points), iridescent (4 points), iridescent (4 points). Enough for every one to pip. So best case scenario each survivor plays perfectly to that point and they all rank up.
---
however that is clearly NOT the intention of what BHVR is doing for red ranks.  It is either you go above and beyond or you just safety. atm a safety is relatively easy to get. 1 gen, 1 save, live, and be chased for roughly a minute (or be in the killer's terror radius for roughly a two minutes).  every survivor at red ranks should be able to do that each game.  Only those that go past that should rank up, well that is BHVR's intention anyways. 
---
If you want to rank up regularly, make two SAFE hook saves, do two gens, live and get chased for a bit. 
---
every one is going around saying they made saves.... did they makes saves or did they make UNSAFE saves? unsafe saves hurt you so much compared to just letting the person die on the hook.
---
Maybe actually play as her before decide you want her to be your main.
---
The idea of a shapeshifting killer has been bandied around a lot, but this is really cool. I hope to one day see it, or a variation thereof.
---
We've had a lot of non licensed killers this past year. It's been a year and 2 months since the last licensed killer, with 4 unlicensed since then. I'd like there to be more licensed this year, now that it's clear that even after this length of time the game is still going strong, Maintain hype.
---
A year of 4 killers, one being non licensed, plus \[spoiler\], the  Thing (and Until Dawn?)
---
My only query is why not have its entity name be 'The Thing'? I would worry 'Alien' would make people think it's from the Alien franchise.
---
Ok that was too far
---
Bois gunna pop a kap in her ass
---
I understand what you mean, but I feel pushing out this ranking system without adding rank rewards will just lead to more people deranking. 
---
Good to know. Have they pached it in the new update though?
---
Then you get moried
---
I think I might!
---
Tbh I just do what I need to do for the daily and then fuck around for the rest of the match
---
Literally just chase them again if they DS. 
---
I'm pretty sure that they didn't, I was able to do it to a Claudette today. 
---
I had a thought that since (from what read) the leak was only on console, so maybe he is our exclusive survivor like Bill was for PC
---
I don't have people disconnect as often as you are. For me it'll be one in five games I'll have a disconnect. I don't wanna assume but maybe you're tunneling or camping and people are just disconnecting out of spite or something. 
---
I'll just say don't worry about it. This achievement coincides with your goal as a killer so you'll get it faster than you think.  
---
Yes its miles better now for me on PS4. I can actually play the game with out it being a slide show haha. It's awesome :) 
---
the same ones who say amanda
---
Very true. My dream was always to make the ranking up harder AND adding rewards. 1 step closer...
---
When's bbq showing up in the shrine of secrets?
---
This is why I feel like the rankings need to be determined by how many bloodpoints you earn, not the current system.
---
So people should stay and waste a half hour of their life not having fun, so that you get to play an OP killer with no skill needed? 
---
I'm tolerant to a lot of things and never rage quit. But its dead simple with this - I enjoy the gameplay of DBD a lot - If I'm not enjoying it I won't play. I have been owned by many good killers and still had fun because you know there is something that can be done to escape, which makes it tense.
---
I have never had this in all my time playing dbd (I used to play lots then stopped for ages, come back and legion is here). I don't blame people for leaving a legion game. It is so beyond broken that it takes away the core enjoyment. I don't even know how they will fix him without making him into something completely mundane.
---
While I would absolutely love the Thing there is a major problem here:
---
1. Survive with Friends group counter this perfectly and the Thing then becomes a standard m1 killer with no useful power at all
---
2. Do you know which surv form are you in? I.E. If you know you are disguised as surv A, you might fool B, C and D, but definitely not A
---
3. Can the Thing do EVERYTHING a surv can? If not, it would cause every player to crouch/point when they meet, thus ensuring they are not the killer
---
4. It would add more fire to the "Nea is the Killer" memes... ;)
---
In my opinion Noed is balanced, because by the time Noed becomes active the killer has already lost. If you are a survivor with a brain you will very likely will not be found after the last generator pops unless you get very unlucky or you want to be found. Sure you can combo Noed with Bitter Murmur, but that is 2 perk slots that are completely inactive for 95% of the match for hooking 1 person once.
---
I would say moris are unbalanced if it wasn't for the fact that survivors can finish all generators in 4 minutes and just GTFO, and you still need to catch someone twice before killing them, so all the mori does is reduce the necessary times you need to catch someone from 3 to 2. I think that's perfectly fine for an ultra rare offering.
---
Best thing that happened means that the killer qont camp, the only people complaing are those who kill on first hook. Personally I've been rising through the killer ranks due to the fact that I'm breaking gens, hooking every player 2-3 times. It clearly stated in the update notesntahtnif you get 9 hooks you'll get iridescent, just means better and longer games 
---
Lol I see Adam in almost every game
---
what did i just witness
---
it‚Äôs about emblems not BP
---
Don't say that, now some dumbass mod is going to delete this thread and insist it be reposted in the bug thread, where no one will see it. 
---
I always loved these attempted lore explanations and excuses for poor balance/killer role plays.
---
This is an online game. No one "holds immense power" over any one else.
---
Juggling...yeah, I get it. Still, just take the stun and keep pursuing. There‚Äôs no way juggling saved that much time
---
Wait, why Until Dawn? Just a wish or sth more?
---
It happens. This sub is more for memes than any serious discussion it seems.
---
Not camping or tunneling. I only do that to especially toxic people. I do use Scratched Mirror Myers. So maybe that‚Äôs why.
---
But fair enough, I suppose it‚Äôll pop eventually.
---
When I cry so much a perk gets nerfed to oblivion you might have a point.
---
Little bitch.
---
Most people are assuming that since there were no leaked Killer perks it might just be a Survivor only DLC. 
---
Now I don't have to waist time intentionally deranking myself. I can just do so while giving it my best. I love it.
---
nice way to continue the  ad hominem. Call me a white knight all you want but if you read my posts or go to the dbdl form, you'll see I am actually against it being harder to rank up when there are no rewards. So I am actually against how it is harder to pip right now since there are no rewards at the end.  
---
i'm just sick of actual bullshit posts like this saying they did so much but didn't pip.  They are leaving out information on why they didn't pip.   
---
Such as "Oh I got chased by the killer!"  later turns into "Oh I got chased by the killer for like 10 seconds at the end of the match and allowed him to hit me on the way out!"   
---
\- which btw if you get hit during a chase, you lose half of your evader points from that chase. a really bad thing to do.  
---
As well as "I made 4 saves!" which later turns into "Well some of those saves were unsafe since the killer tunneled and downed them right away".... which means that you made some unsafe hooks, resulting in negative points for your emblem.   
---
Teamwork?
---
I have people with bond leading killers to me and throwing pallets in my face.
---
DS is garbage now, even after you get unhooked, most of the Killers have been leaving me and others on the ground for a few mins while going after another teammate only to come back and DS is gone, 60sec timer is to short... not running that perk ever again! 
---
Yeah true maybe people just hate going against that. I personally love those games cause they're actually terrifying. Good luck im sure you'll get it soon. 
---
Yeah hopefully rank rewards aren't too far away, but I'm not that optimistic. Personally I do think the pipping requirements are a bit too harsh, I think it needs to be somewhere between this new system and the old one.
---
Always prioritize going to a new looping zone rather that trying to avoid all her puke, because if you do this then that makes her ability able to zone you and she will just give you a quick hit when you eventually get broken. As you head for a loop you can attempt a few small jukes left and right to avoid some puke, the goal is to keep making her puke and losing time and for you to not be broken before a loop or at least not in the open. Also on avoiding puke, going on any jungle gym or loop with high walls, taking sharp turns around walls can make her miss most of her puke since it does not follow her aim well.
---
nah that's the old rank system. anyone still rank 1 now are gods
---
Use something sharp.
---
That and on a portable console where people will mostly use hotspots to get online.
---
So I am punished for using the killer power? Makes no sense to me. 
---
Context here: They all crashed. This is what happened next
---
She‚Äôs new after a crap ton of matches against her you start to find how to play against her. She‚Äôs probably higher tier though. 
---
first of all killers who didnt pick you up because of DS are just plain retarded. rank 1 didnt mean you were high skilled at all thus far, it just meant you played a good amount of hours. if you regularly play rank 1 you would know there is a huuuuuuuge skill gap within rank 1 alone. you sound like you analyse the game from a poetic kind of view rather than an effeciency pov. you are not forced to give up on anything, you know a looper objective is only to waste your time as killer while others work gens right? it's their sole porpuse when doing so. you have a simple choice to make , you wanna be a 'badass relentless killer that gives up on nothing' or do you wanna be in control of games pace? this is not an Role Play game my dude. it just works this way. you cant afford to commit to every chase, when have to know when and how to do it. it doesnt mean you wont get a good player, you will get him at his due time. if you find a good looper early game and commit to his chase for 4 gens , that's your problem for poor decision making , and bad gamesense overall, wouldnt make sense to make good players work on gens , while you kill slightly worse ones you actually can get while controling the games pace? if your argument on chosing what chases to do is '  a bloodthirsty killer hellbent on slaughter and sacrifice, but seeing a window and a pallet just makes him go *d a r n* and walk away. ' i literally don't know what to tell you. i never said you choose give up because of a pallet or a window i dont know where are you getting this from, you only have to analyse the games duration, is it worth keep on chasing this dude? am i in control of gens and their progression? are the gens popping too fast? and decide accordingly. like any other videogame, your optimal decisions are situational. not because you are this 'beast from the entity whos affraid of nothing' bullcrap. but ok let's play your game, a bloodthristy killer hellbent on slaughter and sacrife is going to cry on online forums over a... perk? i mean.... i totally get what your saying but if role playing is your style, you are def playing the wrong game   
---
not punished, just not rewarded as much. isnt that fair? instead of chasing and hitting twice, you hold m2 for a minute and insta down them for a lower reward.
---
The perk image is a berreta 
---
The perk describes a glock 
---
The doc has a m1911
---
Do you remember roughly what was said? comments have been deleted
---
Eventually the sides are just going to have nothing I dont think we need to remove everything on both sides. To be honest all of the constant back and forth changes are making the game not as enjoyable. As a killer I have never been upset by someone using it. You have to be good or smart to make the play and most people arent. So if you are chasing forever then work on your chases it doesnt need a nerf. As a survivor I view it as more of a help in very end game situations. If you use it instantly you're an idiot.
---
We dont need a new opinion every day on what to remove. Insta heals are not that big of a deal and are not run every game.
---
Lol I had a legion and a huntress drible me to the hook last night after the patch, guess they didn‚Äôt get the memo! 
---
I doubt anyone has ever chosen him, thought *Time for a fun, fair match!*, and meant it.
---
Yeah. I see your point i dont think thats accurate but because me and your conversation would go in circles im just cutting it here. Have a good day friend.
---
The only way to win is playing a sweaty build and dying from stress.

---
Oh it‚Äôs definitely changed a ton. 
---
I think it‚Äôs a combination of both but I think the ranking is still a little to heavy handed. My biggest issue as a survivor is that if I want to pip I have to play for myself and not for the team. 
---
Bad emblem change is bad
---
I understand that, but at red ranks it‚Äôs not about skill, it‚Äôs about opportunity. 
---
i love you Kirby
---
Is it just me or does anyone else agree this is cringey af when people sexualize video game characters? 
---
Perhaps I'm not being completely clear. I'm not saying this *needs to happen*, rather, I find the discussion an interesting prospect. I'll admit I'd rather it be a more skillful item combo instead of a braindead one, but I'm more interested in the discussion itself, not advocating for some sort of change.
---
That apostrophe was intentional because of reasons btw.
---
yeah... that too
---
Oh god you roasted me.
---
Jk, beta incel has no power here, as in their real life.
---
Lets make it the ranking system far more difficult - but still no reward for making it to Rank 1
---
The DBD sub isn't a place I would've expected to find yet another bunch of white dudes getting triggered by the word Latinx, how disappointing. 
---
&gt;and you get a ton of BP for it
---
The bloodpoints gained is a laughable excuse for bloodpoints.
---
&gt;It's like 10 seconds apiece
---
Then there is the part where you have to search for totems, unless you are SWF, the only way you can be sure all totems are gone is by traversing the whole map untill you either found all 5 totems or if you are lucky a hex totem gets broken and you now have 1 totem less to look for. It's time consuming and when you cleanse 4 totems on your own and don't imidiately find a 5th one, you either have to keep losing time looking for it or let it go and hope someone else found and broke it (wich is rarely the case to be honest). A huge part of the problem I have with the perk is that there is no way of knowing how many totems are left as a solo survivor. If they were to just place a totem icon next to the generator icon where it tells you how many totems are left, that would be very handy.
---
The other problem I have with the perk that it has a very strong effect that with activatr most of the games, but doesn't really require the killer to do anything to benefit from it. With devour hope, you need to earn the effects while also keeping your totem alive. With adrenaline (a perk I personallydon't like) you have to repair all generators to benefit from it. With noed... it just kind of happens. And you might say that NOED also requires you to complete all generators, but as a killer, you obviously try to slow down gen progress and if NOED doesn't activate, you already won (or the survivors somehow cleansed all totems). You are pretty much always in a win-win situation. Also, Adrennaline is only beneficial if you are injured or if the killer happens to be next to you when the last generator pops. When NOED activates, you always benefit from it.
---
I would argue that it is not OP, but the effect is just too strong for you to get it for "free"
---
The point of ultra rares is to be a quick game changer. Just like the Iridescent king and hatchet- they‚Äôre op for a reason. Just gotta bite the bullet and suck it up. Plus, once that insta heal is used, it‚Äôs gone. 
---
Oh yeah they absolutely love everything Evil Dead related, and can you blame them? They were a bunch of 20 somethings who just wanted to make a movie because they were passionate about it. I'm pretty sure none of them had any 'professional' training or anything prior to making Evil Dead. So with a tiny budget and a random cabin they found in the woods they made a movie that became a cult classic and gave many of them a career in the film industry. 
---
Don‚Äôt drag us into this without bringing Mississippi in as well
---
Fingers crossed if crossplay ever happens it doesn‚Äôt happen for Switch as that‚Äôll be a shot show 
---
**UwU**
---
Make sure you aren‚Äôt in exhaustion state when doing it. I had a friend having an issue but he had sprint bursted to the locker. I‚Äôve also noticed that if the killer directly in front of the locker it doesn‚Äôt always trigger and if they are in the open animation it won‚Äôt trigger. 
---
You waited 8 hours for a response bit I'M the beta incel? Go back to losing on anthem with your pikey Internet lol
---
I agree why do people want to fuck 3d models and pixels?
---
I think it‚Äôs a real shame that only Bruce Campbell managed an acting career out of it the actress who played Cheryl was pretty solid herself
---
Cause i'm not hirez, and I'm not lazy enough to be in their dev team, xo.
---
There's good Legions on both sides!
---
&gt; because I have no understanding of chase mechanics
---
What exactly do you need to know about chase mechanics when you're stuck at a jungle gym? Please, enlighten me oh wise one. While you're being a smartass, perhaps you could educate me on how the chase mechanics of ridiculously strong tiles like the basement loop on Haddonfield or Badham work, since apparently I'm missing something here. My tiny brain thinks a chimpanzee could loop those structures with relative ease. I must find my error.
---
&gt; or how to use my power to break a loop
---
You ever read something so stupid it gives you Forest Whitaker eye? Many powers aren't all that useful at certain tiles because of how they're designed. Granted you're not going against potatoes for survivors, many of them simply make small adaptations and continue the loop.
---
But hey, let's keep making shit up. It's fun.
---
It needs adjustments, indeed. But this is more like how it should be. 
---
I definitely wasn‚Äôt exhausted. Plus, exhaustion won‚Äôt keep you from vaulting. It will only keep the perk from activating. 
---
Can literally see your fat pikey neckbeard in your posts with your SS haircut lol fucking mook 
---
But if someone forces a death on first hook, or doesn't get saved GG to your iridescent
---
Well they pretty much threw leather face in there with no survivor or map. They threw Bill in with no killer and no map. So maybe we get ash with no killer and a we could get the Cabin map
---
What you're referring to is a med kit. We have those already. We dont need a med kit with botany knowledge add on. Without the speed to use it it is useless and makes an add on nearly worthless. It's not brain dead just because its fast or frustrates you.
---
I was reading somewhere from a post by them that they want to make insta-heals into something that kicks in after some time, so you can‚Äôt heal mid chase and just tank another hit. Idk how long the timer is but it might be enough that sometimes you can get a hit off before it works 
---
best tip, to actually play her first!  WTF kind of post is this, trolling or just didnt think it thru entirely?
---
I could say the no mither flashlight guy should definitely be at higher ranks. They wanted to have an easy game and they got what they wanted :/ It was my 4th time playing spirit and thinking back at my misplays makes me cringe. I was also using shitty add-ons because I didn't want to waste any good ones as I was still learning her power. I really hope they will deal with deranking and maybe add some minor changes to instant heals next.
---
In fact it should mean that. Consider a game like league of legends. 2% of the couple million players in NA reach diamond, (the equivalent of red ranks). Beyond that0.001 reach challenger, the theoretical equivalent of rank 1. Yet, in dead by daylight, there are almost as many red ranks as there are rank 15-20, which is absurd and devalues the rank system entirely. The average joe SHOULDNT be able to make rank 1. The average joe should be around silver in league (midpoint is silver V, Bronze 1), or the equivalent I‚Äôm DbD being about rank 15. The distribution is not as skewed as it should be and thus red ranks are meaningless. Make it hard to obtain and maintain, that way rank 1 means something. 
---
Garfield is by far my favorite 
---
The thing that gets me is survivors always needing the killer to watch them leave, either by hatch or gate. As a survivor, I am out as soon as I find an exit. As killer, Im gonna go break pallets, kick gens, and/or place traps while they fast vault on the other side of the map trying to get my attention.
---
&gt; or the Plague Achievement is bugged
---
All the new ones are bugged.
---
Nah us red ranks are plummeting to the purple and greens fast. The new pip system is a nice nerf to swf though because now you have to be extremely selfish. Also I think it could lead to more farming matches. 
---
It would but If they did evil ash it would take away the possibility of virgo ever becoming an character
---
I‚Äôm a pretty new player but I don‚Äôt think either are really out of hand...
---
DS doesn‚Äôt get you completely out of the woods. I‚Äôve used it a few times and it didn‚Äôt do much for me, also when I‚Äôve played killer I‚Äôve re-caught a few immediately that wiggles out.
---
NOED I guess could be considered unfair because it CAN be a huge advantage, but it‚Äôs kind of only a huge advantage for the killer if you don‚Äôt leave once the gates are open and stand around teabagging in the hallway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Just my thoughts.
---
Noted: I alternate killer and survivor and am probably a better survivor. Only used NOED once on a team of jackasses who were holding the game hostage. I just stood there to let them exit because I was tired of playing with them but they kept circling me. Killed 2 and they absolutely deserved it.
---
Ya true looking through a couple of more threads I can see where people can exploit it, I've had a couple of DCs myself on the lower ranks. But when people dont I feel like it makes the game alot more fun and rewarding 
---
Claudette (doing gens you?) main spotted. And whos gonna open the gates?
---
10-1 says BHVR is anti-gun so this would never happen, but it would be hilarious to see a doctor whip out a Glock, hold it sideways and say game over Mother Fucker! 
---
IT‚ÄôS OBVIOUSLY A JOKE, JESUS CHRIST
---
The first person said something like there was no way Plague was better than Huntress and the second person said that Plague was better because she had 115 ms compared to Huntress's 110.
---
Does the creature see wider while in survivor? Not necessarily 3rd person but can it see much wider or turn it vision 360 while feigning gen repair? Overall I love this idea!
---
Nah. I personally believe that your progress should not be tied to what the other side is/isn't doing. As killer, if survivors aren't rescuing people enough, you get punished. If someone DCs, you get punished. If someone let's themselves die on hook, you get punished. 
---
As a survivor if a killer doesn't get enough hooks, doesn't chase you well enough (or just doesn't see you), you get punished.
---
Personally I care very little about rank, the new system is beyond terrible though. I also never understood why people complained about ranking up being too easy. I hear the "potato" argument all the time but that makes very little sense to me. First off who cares if their are bad players around? Secondly this won't necessarily stop bad players from being in your game or you going against bad players. Third, sometimes people may just be having an off game or trying to have fun. Lastly just because someone is the same rank/level as you doesn't mean their skills in all areas or overall is as high as yours. This goes across anything that involves skill, from video games to basketball.
---
Also this game has way too many bugs and balance issues to think about a hardcore ranking system.
---
Groovy or Not Groovy?
---
I keep saying that. I play with a friend and we don't care about ranks at all. 
---
But I do like to win, or at least come close to winning but I won't use the "best builds" because I don't care about them. I love Spine Chill for example and I'm pretty sure it's never used. 
---
Dwight's rage face kills me more than me running around as Nea with bright pink hair. I may die, but I'm gonna look good doin' it.
---
It means she has consumed a corrupt fountain and her vomit will now deal damage.

10 4 man swf matches last night we had a combined 4 pips 8 safety and a ton of depips. All 4 depipped twice on 4 man escapes.

she gets corrupted purge.
---
This is a classic case of be careful of what you wish for. The cry they heard was ranking up was too easy. Currently I'm rank 9 survivor, 14 for killer. About half my matches I pip or safety pip. The rest is due to my poor decisions, end of story. I'm not going to sugar coat that I always play at my best.  
---
The conditions are a lot stricter than they used to be. It's going to force people to really look at the emblems and the conditions for getting the correct amount of points. Is it a little bit too much to ask for red ranks? Possibly. We did this to ourselves and we can provide feedback on how and why this isn't going to work. There might need to be point tweaking. 
---
This game requires logical thinking at times:
---
Is unhooking this person going to guarantee a safe hook? What's the plan b if it isn't? Did we gen rush too much? Am I chasing this survivor because I should or because of a personal vendetta? Am I monitoring these gens appropriately? 
---
The red ranks are going to become the people that truly have an understanding of how to survive/please the entity.  It won't be for casuals anymore. It will be truly be "oh damn, it's a red rank player." It's going to be a club that a lot of people used to be in that didn't belong in the first place... and it's going to be a hard pill to swallow.
---
Oh well, that was actually the only thing that made sense in my first version, seems like I forgot to add it to this version too. But yeah that is a possibility too (and I really hope it is (atleast if it will get fixed))
---
Her ass is fat, she isn't thicc at all
---
Had the same thing happen to me 
---
This is pretty damn good. The only one problem that I have with it is the mutation RNG. I think it would be pretty sweet if you turn into the survivor that is furthest away from you instead. That could give you info on who in fact is the furthest away and it would be much easier to trick the survivors into thinking youre a fellow survivor. Also, I think that when you vault or use a pellet in the morphed form, you should leave blue or green scratch marks that the survivors could see, it gives incentive to stay behind the survivors and for the survivors to be weary of whats behind them 
---
or run to the other side of the map before stopping to get a heal while the killer is picking someone else up.
---
The rights for the original franchise are so messed up they could barely reference any of it on the TV show and could only acknowledge Army of Darkness happened in the third season. While young Ash would be cool, I would suspect the far easier to license TV Ash is a significantly higher probability. 
---
i didn‚Äôt draw this, it was made using this game called gacha life.
---
i was planning on this being a ‚Äòall unlicensed characters‚Äô post but i forgot about kate. sorry kate 
---
These are nice but my main girl Kate is missing üò¢
---
Uh, Homecoming did not have Willem Dafoe as the villain, therefore it can't be the best.
---
Monitor and Abuse-With such a small terror radius you're really able to get the jump on survivors. I think it's 16 with that on.
---
Ruin
---
Make Your Choice
---
Nurses Calling or Save The Best for Last-Nurses mixes well with monitor since they won't hear you coming until a few meters after you've already seen them.
---
Calm down
---
damn this is addicting to look at lol
---
they are not hard to find i dont think anyone ever said that, it just takes tremendous amount of progression time to find them all, on solo games. you could be finished with 2 gens. it's just not worth it to waste all of that time for the small probability of a possible noed.
---
Yeah spies was too good.
---
Billy no addons, and Huntress no addons, 19 out of 20 games in r1 is 4ks
---
I wouldn't call it a nerf more of a QOL, I used it once after the buff and got so annoyed by the constant noise notifications that I immediately un-equipped it.
---
He should have camped.
---
Hatch is already a stupid mechanic to begin with. Why give it an item to buff it?
---
The lower range makes it a more reliable tracking tool. Who cares about crows 48 meters away going off? I can't get there fast enormous guy to benefit me. 
---
But the servers are not out yet. So someone needs to be the host.
---
I've been at minimum 5 minute wait times for killer and am getting ranked with purple at my own rank 15. Sad days.
---
Alright M Night
---
Too bad, noobie
---
Its also easier to hit, just because it starts before you move
---
Cote is King
---
If you think these perks are "brokenly" overpowered, you're completely incorrect. One is not good and two are just good, which is nice since the last new batches haven't been.
---
They all have conditions and downsides. Angrily commenting on reddit about perks that (sort of) aren't even out and ignoring their conditions and downsides, while insulting others about balance is hilariously ironic. 
---
It has always been the main reason.  
---
Were people saying otherwise ??  
---
love the GIF btw &lt;3
---
the last time BBQ appeared in shrine was like 1,5 year ago so just level up Leatherface and dont wait for it
---
Upvotes and downvotes here mean the same thing:  Someone read your post.  In addition to that, everyone reads the massively downvoted comments too because they're addicted to drama.
---
Don't worry about getting upset, just post things and let them be what they will be.  Also, here's a [guide to proper gen-tapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm2FBVvu2ro).

Damn! I was gonna ask if we happened to be in the same game but I was against a Leatherface and not a Hillbilly.
---
Michael: **You have betrayed me for the last time**
---
Have a good day too :)
---
So only 1% of players can reach, and remain in, red ranks. Okay, but here's the problem:
---
If the matchmaking is working correctly, red rank players would only play with other red rank players. That means your reward for the difficult task of reaching rank 1 is longer queue times and higher pings, since there's a smaller pool of players to choose from.      
---
yeah i forgot about her until the last second, im sorry kate üò¢
---
Hate playing against her...not only because of the jump scares. Pigs tend to tunnel a lot. With that being said, I've been thinking about playing her more (only have played her for dailys). She has really good mind game potential and lord knows I enjoy a good mind game. Definitely midtier. If they made her dash more effective like, idk, make the growl happen midway through it, she would be even more effective.
---
As well as when gates are open, there is no fear. You get seen to only run to the gates. Noed puts that fear back in because you may not be able to make it back. Before the exit gates are powered, noed is even stronger. You can down everyone with ease if they are together. It could use a little tweaking.
---
Pigs who tunnel are bad. They put a trap on someone and then tunnel them afterwards, even though they will do literally nothing for a minute.
---
samw but on xbox...
---
I'm okay with the thought of "making it harder on higher ranks". But now it seems like this systems asks you to perform near perfection (which is dumb). Also if a SWF wants to dick with you they can just DC, and it will punish you too. 
---
But the question is how does a survivor get the trap off of their head once through the hatch? Real talk. I know it‚Äôs a game but that is a flaw that should be addressed.
---
That‚Äôs the perk Tinkerer
---
I plan on on. I de ides to main her because I‚Äôve seen a ton Of gameplay but need my perks to be better before I jump right in.
---
Lol I would hope so. Thank you.
---
i disagree. all my lobbies used to be yellow to red ping, since the update its been green to low yellow. my lobby times have been 2 minutes to less than a minute. so idk what you‚Äôre complaining about. 
---
I just see a regular Claudette 
---
Yeah it was really cool to see the killer in third person. I was freaking out
---
No man, I plan on it but want to level her first to have adequate perks. I‚Äôm just wondering what strategies have been explored to what success while playing her. Looking for insight before I jump full ship into the disease.
---
Enduring 3 reduces the stun time by 75%, so 3 x 0.25 = 0.75 seconds. Even tier 1 would only make the stun 1.5 seconds.
---
&gt; So what did Blizzard do? 
---
Is this a joke I'm not getting?
---
Their ego needs every win they can get so they can feel better at a game.
---
Honestly, devs needs to add an achievement that has low-key but genius insult to those who teabagg. Like, when the game reads that you furiously crouched 20 times like an animal in less than 10 seconds you get something like "I am pro, don't kill me".
---
Give me your best ideas for this type of achievement.
---
&gt;if I see a rank 1 anything I‚Äôm expecting to be carried or murdered within 20 seconds
---
If a rank 1 killer murders you in 20 seconds then they're going to depip and stop being rank 1. They're playing *too well* for rank 1 and the game's going to derank them. (Okay, with the adjustments in live they'll probably safety pip, which makes a bit more sense.)
---
The reason the rank system is fucked is that emblems don't really measure how much you kicked the other side's ass, they measure a bunch of videogamey bullshit that would be called "grind" in other games.
---
4k the survivors in 5 minutes with 5 gens up? In "world that makes sense" land, you kicked the survivor's ass almost as hard as it is possible to kick their ass. Either you need ranked up or they need ranked down or both because you're way better than they are. In DBD land, you're all getting ranked down/staying in place because the game didn't go on long enough for anyone to farm enough emblem points.
---
Sweat out a 4k by the skin of your teeth after a 15 minute game with the exit gates powered? In "world that makes sense" land, that was a close game and the matchmaking algorithm shouldn't really rank anyone up or down, at least not much. In DBD land, you're all getting ranked up because the game went on long enough for everyone to farm their emblem points.
---
Rank only ever loosely correlated with skill because you have to put in a certain number of hours to hit rank 1 each month, and people with more hours are usually better players. Now hitting rank 1 is more RNG than anything and purple ranks are probably the new red ranks where everyone will stabilize
---
They really just need a proper zero-sum Elo system - something that says "team A kicked team B's ass this much, so team A moves up this much and team B moves down this much." You could use hookstages and set it to something like 7 as the breakeven. I.e. 2k+1 hook is a draw. Every hook before that transfers a point from killer to survivor, every hook after transfers a point from the survivors to the killer.
---
that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre wrong bucko 
---
Also no I‚Äôm not trolling. What builds are you guys using? What seems to be the best choice for slower gameplay and how do you implement it?
---
Very doubtful, but i hope the same
---
Yeah I have agree
---
Not obviously, you seem like you don‚Äôt  know how the game works, don‚Äôt have to be a dick 
---
In this scenario though it would be more like. They gave you $5 and then got mad because you stole it. 
---
Oh god.
---
You are a sad baby that get salty on a video game.
---
Grow up buddy, daddy won't come back.
---
I GOT A 4 KILL WITH THE PLAGUE WITH ONLY HER PERKS ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THE ADEPT ACHIEVEMENT IS BUGGED REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
he had a robot hand in the third movie though
---
the robot hand pablo made for him was kind of a reference to the third movie cause the series couldnt reference it directly thanks to a licensing issue
---
there are a few references to army of darkness like ash talking about not being the first time he fought an evil him, or mentioning he timed traveled before. the show just couldnt talk about anything super specific or show clips from it like they could the first 2 movies. 
---
Yep, every time you level up/select an add-on, the censer will bounce. Also pretty sure the audio is bugged, yeah.
---
The ranking system will keep me in the greens but the matchmaking will pair me with reds so it doesn‚Äôt matter either way.
---
&gt; they saw a survivor camping 2 feet away from where you were just hooked.
---
The best is when some potato starts looping the shack while you're hooked in the basement.
---
Literally makes no sense. Fat wanker.
---
I'm personally fine with the system. Makes red ranks more prestigious.
---
Only thing is the "defeat" sound that plays after getting a depip. I thought I played a good game then that plays. Yeesh.
---
Ash: ‚ÄúThis is my boom stick!‚Äù 
---
EvilDead FanBase: hOLy shIT DUde OMG
---
Are you talking about survivor lobby or killer lobby? My killer lobby is more than 10min but survivor lobby is ok.
---
I'd be begging people to photoshop my pics too if I was a fat ugly cunt like you. You're the definition of a incel. 
---
Tinkerer?
---
Oh my bad then, damn enduring eats ds then 
---
I THINK THE NEW KILLERS COOL BUT PEOPLE ARE YELLING AT ME FOR NOT USING HER I DONT HAVE HER YET BE NICE FUCK
---
almost every killer has some way to prevent looping, pig has the dash, trapper has traps. This used to be the plaugues way of countering it.
---
u just jealous that me have more chromosomes then u
---
Almost as good as when you kill everyone but them and they talk like the escape was their cleverness and not your benevolence.
---
both of my killer and survivor lobbies are fine. 
---
I GOT 17K BP AS A SURVIVOR ONLY TO SAFETY PIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
This new ranking system is pretty frustrating.  I can get not wanting survivors to be able to easily reach rank 1 all the time, and in fairness I doubt I'm a rank 1 survivor in skill, but needing 4 iridescents to pip once at the highest ranks is pretty silly. By definition, having 4 high rank survivors means that no one particular survivor can get the required points needed unless the other 3 survivors were basically AFK the whole match.
---
 There's no caps or rage in this comment because this is pretty obviously unbalanced, and needs to be addressed.  
---
With that said.
---
OBLIGATORY INB4 KILLER MAINS "MAYBE YOU JUST SUCK LUL TOP KEKKERS GIT GUD".
---
"separates the men from the boys"
---
Lol. Okay. I like the new ranking system but Jesus Christ, don't be such a tool.
---
If round is a shape, sure. Alpha? A fat piece of shit who cries because his pikey Internet can't run anthem? Fucking hell. Pure alpha male behaviour that.
---
Now that I think about it you are kind of right. That‚Äôs part of why Ash vs Jason vs Freddy never happened.
---
They didn‚Äôt want Jason or Freddy to lose.
---
I don't care. Remove ranks entirely. None of this shit has mattered and I can't believe you people who care about muh pips still don't get it.
---
This game reminds me of TF2 when suddenly everything goes peaceful and it's a bloodpoints bonanza, dancing (kinda - ees the animation) breaking shit - weeee
---
They're very underwhelming and it's pretty sad imo. Jeff is one of the best survivors and his perks are my personal favorites. Head on is good for Memes but it's an exhaustion perk(I think it should have a cooldown rather than be exhaustion based), solidarity is alright but I think it should heal you up fully(maybe that's too strong tho idk) and poised is crap 
---
Why is that a thing!? üòÇ
---
You get the achievement: ‚ÄúI just showed that baby killer‚Äù
---
Just checked his account and I couldn't see this tweet anywhere. Is this old or fake? Provide a link if you can.
---
You stopped playing the game because of one or two perks?
---
But if you're "stuck" at a rank that isn't rank 1, isn't that a bit more indicative of you *belonging* at that rank? Is it possible that people *weren't as good at the game as they thought*? No, game's fault? Okay, I'll go into my downvote hole now.
---
There's no point to being the obsession before you can use it. Then the killer knows not to tunnel you (like that point brought up in the same post about killers ignoring their obsession). I hope this is a bug that gets fixed.
---
25K BP AND I DON'T PIP FUCK THIS NEW RANK SYSTEM
---
THE DS THING MAY BE A GLITCH I VOULD BE WRONG 
---
Yeah I played for about two hours last night and this was the only time it happened
---
‚ÄúRemember kids do not put your butt holes near pool drains!‚Äù 
---
You know people are like, 'NO', but there's games where survivors can fight back and it definitely adds a layer of interest to the game. It'd be nice if they started adding layers in general though hahah.
---
Pretty underwhelmed with them all. 
---
While Head On is unique, the 3 second 'cast' time prevents it from being reliable or useful. Hopefully the devs will consider reducing or eliminating it, otherwise if will remaim a fringe meme perk. 
---
I had some hope for Solidarity, but the effect is too weak to warrent a slot over existing perks. 
---
Poised is extremely situational and essentially useless. Lightweight amd Urban Evasion completely outclass it. 
---
What the fuck are you talking about ? I have no issue running Anthem rn, but the game was full of bug at the beginning. You have no idea what you're talking about mate.
---
Still waiting to see your face mate. You've stalked picture that are 4 years old and making an assumption, which shows how fucking dense you are. Come buddy, don't be shy. Are you a coward or what ?
---
Never played LoL myself, but I've played OW so I'm going to use that as my reference point in my counterarguement. Sorry..
---
If LoL is like OW (Which it seems to be, in my few minutes of research) where it has a dedicated ranked mode and a bunch more 'casual' modes.
---
In OW, majority of the player base is gold/plat, with very few being in the top tiers of the game outside of pros (Such as GM and T500), which makes sense because of the complexity of the game. (Mechanically and otherwise).
---
However, OW and DBD are very, very different.
---
Both are team based games, where you /have/ to rely on your team for the win. You can't play solo and expect a victory. In DBD however, you have no comms or way to communicate with your team in-game as a solo survivor outside of two emotes, which can really only do so much. From what I saw, LoL does the same with chat as OW, where there is at least an in-game text chat (And from what I saw, I think now a voice chat as well?).
---
This makes getting a higher rank as a solo-survivor much harder then it was already.
---
Hell, honestly I wouldn't mind that as much though if a few more things where more coherent on survivor's side to help everyone be on the same page (Such as a universal totem counter visible to killers and survivors), or if the game had a casual mode and a competitive mode.
---
I agree that only the best should be at the top and that it should be hard to obtain, but I don't think this system is the way to do it with the current matchmaker. Currently, whenever you queue into a game, you're always effecting your rank. And it's the only way to progress in anything- BP or EXP. I personally just hate the idea of now having to pick and choose whether or not I'm going to play to relax and sacrifice my rank because of how I prefer to play or if I'm going to have to sweat my ass off to obtain an arbitrary number...
---
Granted, I also never really had much issue with the old system. I thought it was fine- I always pipped/safety pipped when I thought I should and de-pipped when deserved...
---
TL;DR: Wouldn't have an issue with the new system if they split up modes between Comp and Casual, but until they do they shouldn't run this system.
---
Thank you honestly im glad someone likes them :), I will probably end up redoing a lot of them at some point, I mainly mess around with them while I wait to find a game xD , thank you for the advice :P
---
Lots of people don‚Äôt seem to get that in asymmetrical multiplayer games, the power role is *supposed* to be overpowered.
---
I started a game last night with the wiggle prompt, if it tried moving left or right my character would stop because the game thought u was wiggling. I had full health 
---
I agree, this ranking system is an absolute clusterfuck to play with.
---
Naw to get a double pip you need to do a SWF and politely ask your friends to do nothing while you carry the whole game on your shoulders while your team depips. ;)
---
When I become so fat and ugly I need to beg people to photoshop me, you'll see it. Unfortunately I don't have those issues like you. Now stop trying to nonce up kids asking them for pictures. Fat paedo wanker.
---
I see. Thanks for letting me know about that. 
---
If both new and veteran players all get stuck at rank 8, I think something is wrong with the system. Also, ranking up doesn't require you to perform well in the game, you litteraly have to go out of your way if you want to rank up. If you play optimally, you risk depipping 
---
Bro I tried the plague for the first time yesterday night and legit go scared cause the I guess survivors cleansing? Went off 12 times every time one drank, and got stupid loud. 
---
Switch to console. Sure you cant play the nurse effectively, but who cares. Just play Freddy and be happy 
---
first tbag = insta dc
---
in all likelyhood it's not the graphics causing the terrible framerate, it's probably something in the background where someone screwed up coding a game system making it take up much more cpu power than it should, and since people are still playing and presumably buying the cosmetics they don't want to put the effort in when it could be spent on making more cosmetics for people to buy 
---
I have not noticed any indication of it running out other than the red glow around her vanishing

Oh god dude you litteraly said you are a kid, you are so fucking retarded that I don't even need to crush you, you're doing it alone.
---
Oh god, stay behind your computer slave, that is fine, you know your place :).
---
PEOPLE TREAT YOU LIKE GARBAGE FOR USING HER TOO, SO DON'T WORRY.
---
Cleansing the totems should be a standard part of the game. As it stands, a large part of cleansing them for solo survivors is just luck. Small Game is designed to help players quickly and efficiently cleanse totems. Giving it a counter or some kind of notification that alerts the player when all totems are cleansed would make it feasible for non-SWF groups to handle totems. I'm not sure what your problem with giving solo survivors a fair chance is.
---
Dead by daylight but the doctors strapped i dig it

When performing this there should be ‚ÄúFuck the police‚Äù playing in the background

FUCK THATS A FAIR POINT

That's really cool I'm guessing it's a computer ?

I think you are confusing BHVR team with Discord moderation team. And judging from this thread Discord moderation team haven't given a permission to post leaks, so I don't think this argument applies here.
---
But also talking about BHVR, they haven't given 5$, those have slipped out of BHVR's pocket. I mean they won't ban you for playing in KYF on console, but I kinda understood their reasoning when they were threatening with ban for exploiting character switch buttons to gain prestige/items. 
---
They seem to only listen to the streamers they approve of.
---
NOT ALWAYS, I STARTED A MATCH EARLIER TODAY WITH SOMEONE ELSE AS THE OBSESSION BUT THEN WHEN I GOT TUNNELED (OBVIOUSLY) AND USED DS, I BECAME THE OBSESSION. SO IF YOU ARE THE OBSESSION FROM THE START IT SUCKS AND THAT'S BAD LUCK BUT YOU AREN'T NECESSARILY GOING TO BE.
---
Relationship with decisive strike is over. Flip-flop is my new best friend 
---
I was hoping there would be one where I got downed lol
---
bhvr are the most incompetant devs i have ever seen. Never before have i seen a dev team, by no means a small one, fuck up so badly. These are the same people who approved legion. Leaked the NEXT FUCKING DLC SOMEHOW. giving empty promises of optimization, freddy reworks etc. couldn't be bothered to put a ban system on console until magically once a prestige exploit is found using the ps4 controller, they immediately find a way to ban people. The 2 crutch killers, nurse and billy get buffed while all the other sub par killer get nerfed....like what. The devs barely play their own game and are so out of touch with the community its insane.
---
Lol don't get triggered by my post, I'm just talking out loud

Not just farm maps, what about Haddonfield and mount Ormond? These maps are even worse than coldwind

I actually have had very little problems with the new matchmaking. Even in SWF we never had to wait longer than 1 minute and if the ping was bad, we could queue up again and get into a new lobby with better ping almost instantly. This matchmaking beats getting a red ping lobby after 15 minutes of waiting any day. The time indication for queue times have been accurate 9 times out of 10 so far for me. 
---
I'm a Myers main too just want to tell survivors to be careful around some of us

/: I'm self conscious about my writing cause i know it's not great but in my defense i wrote this in like &lt;10 min. Thank you for your constructive criticism. I hope the joke landed at least
---
It's not the devs though. The Discord moderators are a seperate entity (ha ha joke) to Behavior.
---
damn rereading this i definitely did that really bad. i even proof read for things like this damn lol
---
I know it would be probably be very over powered. but I wish we had a perk that made the killer be seen in 3rd person. 
---
My main reason is not for wining its so I can look at the cosmetics I bought.
---
Yeah this new system seems significantly worse. It's been like nearly 10 minutes for me already, and still going, whereas I'm used to waiting not even 2 or 3...
---
Whenever I try to go for the sneaky unhook and I get caught, I make it my mission to get as far away as possible from the hooked up, I literally just B-line it across the map even if I have to go down. You can tell when the killer is camping if they just hit you once and then go back to the hooked person.
---
Is iridescent king op? Idk it's strong but definitely not op imo 
---
nah, man
---
Because of all those 3848 other issues with the game too. :)
---
Is that true? Are we on servers now? If so why does it seem like 90% of the playerbase now has a worse connection.
---
I don't know how tbings are on the survivor side, but at the killer side, I often depip after killing off all survivors early in the game.
---
Feng looks haunted
---
Honestly as a Killer Main it would be a lot less infuriating then the flashlight spam and pallet looping. At least it'd be interesting.
---
WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOUR CAPITAL LETTERS, PRIVATE?! ALSO, I KIND OF LIKE THE FACT THAT LEGION EXISTS TO SHUT DOWN LOOPS AND FORCE A STEALTHIER SLOWER GAME, NEVER USED FRANK‚ÄôS AND/OR MOONWALKING CHEESE.
---
Look up on YouTube"Damnohtml" and watch the video he made on legion

---
Yeah but why does that matter??
---
Just what a Michael would say.
---
That sounds unnecessary, at least let the killer create the lobby as they did pre-patch and then group survivors and place them in the lobby. Either way on xbox my queue times were almost instantaneous and now I'm waiting between 3-8 minutes just to get in a lobby and hope no one leaves or is using McDonald's wifi. 
---
I‚Äôm honestly over this new rank system. I‚Äôm a red rank survivor and I understand that rank to some extent doesn‚Äôt matter but this system worries me. I think the rank should fairly determine experience with the game. If it‚Äôs near impossible to stay getting pips in red rank then we are going to have a lot of high skilled players in low ranks just screwing over the people who actually aren‚Äôt that good. This new system doesn‚Äôt help the rank system it hurts it by further encouraging (by making it easier) depiping 
---
&gt; killer goes afk as Wraith to depip

&gt; survivors can't get any evader points 
---
&gt; survivors depip too
---
Pretty good job so far. 
---
It shouldn't be that hard, rank means nothing but sweaty killers/survivors
---
CAPS LOCK MOTHER FUCKER! LOL
---
For her add ons you want the ability to teleport from a distance. I also like the faster drawing of traps. But her OP build would include mint rag and make your choice. Even if they sneak for the unhook you still get a 1 hit down. It‚Äôs brutal. Mint rag also works amazingly with thrill of the hunt. Pop up and smash people on those totems. 
---
On rereading, I get that you were just pointing out that it was funny that it was in front of the exit gates. But, I don't really get the rest of your comment, and I'm not sure others do either, which is why this discussion is happening. 
---
If you'd just said "Ah, and in front of the exit gate, too!" That would've been clear. But then you descended into some odd diatribe about camping and teabagging, and it all seemed very irrelevant since neither of those things actually happen in the gif. I'm not sure what your "point" was. 
---
If people are talking to you about camping and or teabagging, which you think is off-topic, *why the hell did you bring those things up* 
---
Yeah i agree certain rank ranges are nice, but at this point i just play the game. If anything i'm ususally happy if i didn't pip. Takes a lot of stress away when the killer is taking you to your third hook. Especially if you had a good game
---
Recommend me some please
---
They have everything going for them aesthetically, but just need tweaks to make them rewarding and fun to play as and against.
---
Dude that's what I've been saying! Like I played legion for the first few games last night and got maybe in total 3 kills. Figured ok lemme change to Myers cause hes more of a punishing killer....I only got 2 kills in total. Then I decided that I was gonna play pig cause of her traps and I kill everyone. I dont want to solely play one killer to even have a chance. Hell I barely pipped with pig!
---
FUCK YAH IT IS, ITS LIKE SLOWLY DRINKING ANTIFREEZE!
---
A Nightmare on Elm Street wasn't just datamining; sound clips were found, including the Freddy lullaby that more-or-less confirmed him. Halloween was a copyright thing on the bottom of a trailer IIRC.
---
Also, we're technically not an official community, but devs could contact us at any time to get leaks removed or the rights holder could smack us with a DMCA. Neither has happened, and in fact a BHVR dev started commenting on Reddit on the Freddy leak posts.
---
Because they dont think about it 
---
Just look at these numbers 
---
Should have put the Billy r.i.p.
---
I really don‚Äôt think so. People on PC would (rightfully) throw a fit. Console takes longer to get updates certified so what probably happened is, since they‚Äôre now making sure PC and console update at the same time, they submitted the console versions earlier and forgot to take Ash‚Äôs perks out like they did later with PC.
---
Dead Hard, Iron Will, Deliverance, Lithe, Head on...
---
Idk much about survivor perks.
---
and here's dead by daylight, boys
---
I ESCAPED WITH  ONLY JANE'S PARK BUT WHY MY ACHIEVEMENT IS NOT UNLOCKED
---
Errrgh I hate this guy he‚Äôs such an ungrateful asshole. 
---
Nah, see, here's the thing. As a killer, you can't control whether or not you get to hook a survivor multiple times. I've literally hooked a guy, walked to the other side of the map, and never went back, and he died.
---
That's not a rare occurence. Other times you get survivors DC'ing, which stops you from being able to hook them *AND* makes you lose the sacrifice points. If you get a 4k, devout needs to be iridescent. If not, then running a Mori or Deviur Hope is directly antithetic to the killer.
---
Pipping as a killer is completely out of your control now. It doesnt matter how well you do, if the survivors aren't playing nice, you're fucked. If the survivors gen rush you, you're fucked, because your Gatekeeper is gonna suffer. If the survivors dont unhook, you're fucked because you cant get 10 hook events. If you are able to hook everyone at the same time, you're fucked, because you still cant get 10 hook events. 
---
It's not about being a good killer anymore. It's about relying on the survivors to help you by unhooking and not doing gens.
---
I read this comment, seing nothing wrong, then looked at the post searching for what you were pointing out, saw nothing wrong
---
I did this 5 times intill I saw you wrote "Survior" in your comment, I checked the post again and still had to look for like 10 seconds untill I finally saw it
---
TL/DR
---
Don't hook farm at all.
---
what
---
Agree. It was so easy to get to red ranks, i couldnt care less about it. Now op (missing some "fuckings" in the post) is crying cause he cant mantain his ego anymore because he need to actually climb in ranks. I still feels is hard to pip but i think that its how it should be. When in the game the players who are red ranks is the same ammount of players in rank 19-20 you know something is wrong.
---
Ironically, Noed counters Gen rush, sort of.
---
Her left hand is so sassy, never noticed before. 
---
Idk I find the afflictions to not be that effective, the sudden terror radius and red stain in-chase are not really helpful and good survivors will usually shrug it off. The fake pallets will trick survivors on occasion but not always. The doctor extended illusions are really good and although the exhaustion one is solid it only affects survivors in madness 3. You also have to shock each individual survivor 5 times to give them the afflictions 
---
IT IS RAGE WEDNESDAY. USE ALL CAPS AND RAGE OR POST THAT DIATRIBE ELSEWHERE 
---
Yikes sorry for wanting the game devs to actually be competent for once. 
---
I HAD A CLUCH 4K AT ENDGAME AND I DEPIPED CAUSE I GOT SMOKED ON GENS AND ONLY GOT 4 HOOK EVENTS IS THE ENTITY NOT ENTERTAINED ????
---
Replace ds with the leaked perk, then yes
---
Well virgins do exist, and also for my own defence, Leon in the RE2 is based and facial capped off a real guy, he‚Äôs damn hot.

It has happened to me twice before. To ensure this doesn't happen, after my latest game, i go back to main menu, click something, back to the main menu, click something else. Just make a killer lobby, make a survivor lobby etc. i don't know why it happens but every since it happened to me i do this every time to ensure it really auto saves
---
LoL's playerbase is SIGNIFICANTLY latger than DBD's...
---
Not sure but my connection is fine. 
---
Damn. When everyone that leaves a comment agrees with you, but the survivor only players sit back as a silent down-voting armada. We got a bunch of silent salty bois.
---
No P3 Claudette?
---
Plague can vomit on the pallet or windows causing them to become infected. 
---
Traps traps are slow and avoidable, Wrath has no counter, Nor Leatherface. 
---
Imagine the Doctor with Amanda's noises tho. I wouldn't be able to play from laughing 
---
This is literally my exact same tier list except I'd swap spirit with Billy but put Billy in A tier. Spirit and Billy are both strong but nurse is light-years ahead of them 
---
Rumors are a funny thing I guess
---
That's not true and you know it. Even if you don't , I do, because I'm a killer main.
---
There's this play style that encourages people to unhook. It's called not camping,and it usually works for me. Do you get people who are cocks and kill themselves on hook sometimes? Yes. But(and now it's 9 hooks not 10) it isn't a thing that happens every game.
---
It's not out of your control at all. It's harder. Like it should be. Gatekeeper is a bit hard,and I think Chaser is fucked, but it's an improvement from before. Now killers who like to run strong builds and play against MLG squadettes like me can have a good time at red ranks and have it mean something, which we couldn't do before, and casual players still have their game at purple or lower. I think individual thresholds for every rank is highly nuanced and a great decision. 
---
For the record, I've pipped at red ranks half the games I played. All the ones I didn't - it was because I was playing the new killer with shit perks. I could easily pip every game playing a killer with a normal build. 
---
I wanna see a blind mori from the killer's pov
---
Agreed. It wouldn't really matter if they removed the cap on the separate bloodpoint categories when it comes to farming, as long as they keep the 32k bloodpoints per game cap.
---
Im a new player, like 5 days in, and literally every match I have played ends like this (Im trying to learn killer). Just makes me want to chainsaw someones face off next game 
---
Because it's a PC
---
In my POV it‚Äôs too difficult to rank up plus the system that removes score from the sacrifice category If you are within the vicinity of a hooked survivor is unfair because if you hook a survivor near a pallet and find a survivor hiding by said pallet they‚Äôll just loop you around said pallet till you get stunned or bait it, the system itself is flawed and needs to be altered.
---
2 Perks with icons of old ash, and quotes relating to the show (cant verify, never watched the show) seems pretty concrete to me, tbh
---
THIS HAPPENED TO ME LAST NIGHT. LUCKY FOR ME IT WAS A PRIVATE MATCH AND WE WERE JUST DICKING AROUND. 
---
You don't want to hug her imo. It's way too easy to hit you with a constant stream and plus she can just bash you right after it's over
---
The whole point of the ranking system is so that you play with/against players of the same skill level as you. When people with 20 hours are plsuing against people with 2000 hours, you have a problem. 
---
I have started trolling the post game ragers. I pretend to be oblivious to their hate. I start responding like a kid from a 50s sitcom.
---
That's when I started playing. It actually helped prepare me for the technical nightmares to come. 
---
It's weird. There's like a baked in animosity beyond the normal competitiveness for some people. I mean yeah, I want to kill them/survive them, but I don't hate them for not letting me do it unless they're just obnoxious jerks about it.
---
Like I played against a streamer and his SWF as Leatherface a couple of days ago (Trying to grind out his Survivor masks) and hearing all the "Oh yeah he's definitely got NOED.", "Oh he's taking me to the basement, yep he's gonna stay there with insidious what an asshole." and general trash talk on the VOD when I only had Haunted Ground and BBQ because I'd just prestige'd him. 
---
Funnily enough it all melted away as I defied expectations by not having the perks they didn't like and goofing around a little by carrying their friend named "Please don't kill me" to the exit gate and letting them go.   
---
People just need to chill. 
---
It‚Äôs an online game, whoever is the better player IS supposed to beat the opponent senseless 
---
They'll repair gens as fast as they can but once the gates are open they don't want to leave
---
It makes them feel like they accomplished something xD
---
Someone likes dbd a bit too much
---
2 DC's, found bill the first round so he DC'd, downed another one so he DC'd, other ones just played badly (or maybe they just aren't used to her like you said)
---
New ranked system is so much better, they just need to make it a tad easier. This should keep scrubs and facecampers outta red ranks. 
---
100% this. With how long it takes to get stuff approved on console I doubt they want to give the console players another reason to rain hate down upon them lol.
---
and also those killers who are really good and kill real fast therefore don't have a chance to get other emblems to pip. yeah. next season purple ranks are gonna have shitton of fun with me
---
=\
---
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHASER EMBLEM NEEDED TO BE CHANGED BECAUSE VALUES FOR CAMPING DID ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOTHING AS WELL AS CHANGING WHAT QUALITY OF EMBLEMS YOU NEEDED TO PIP, BUT WHY THE FUCK DID THE GATEKEEPER AND DEVOUT EMBLEMS GET CHANGED?
---
There should be bonus points for tbagging DCs.
---
My mood every time I do no-kill farming games with nothing but bloodpoint perks üòÇ
---
I think this is a great idea, as it's going to be much harder to rank up as killer when they rework the ranks
---
But he so far still has the authority to do a pretty good job right?
---
Did you not read what I said? I leave hooks. Always have. I dont stand near or in front of a hook. Its still not possible for me to get 9 hooks in most games. I get 7 or 8 in 4k games. Unless you recommend that I actively ignore survivors that I see while I'm walking away from the hook, which is, again, antithetic to the way a Killer should probably be playing.
---
I don't mind the extra difficulty. I think it's a good thing, actually. But it's too hard with the new set up
---
TO THE SURVIVOR WITH FRIENDS GROUP WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE SOOOO AMAZING AND I WAS SUCH A BABY KILLER THAT THEY KEPT POINTING AT ME AND TEABAGGING ...
---
DIDN'T YOU REALIZE YOU WERE ON AZAROV'S AND I WAS BAITING YOU INTO A THREE GEN?
---
WHEN YOU WERE CIRCLING AROUND ME CLICKING YOUR FLASHLIGHTS AND CROUCHING TO "GIVE" ME A HIT DID YOU KNOW THAT I WAS GOING TO 4K?
---
DID ALL THAT SALT YOU SPEWED IN END CHAT LEAVE A BAD TASTE IN YOUR MOUTH? BECAUSE PLAYERS LIKE YOU DISCOURAGE NEW KILLERS FROM PLAYING THIS GAME AND THAT LEAVES A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH.
---
ALSO ALL FOUR OF YOU HAD D-STIKE - HOWS THAT WORKING OUT FOR YOU NOW?
---
Omg using Drag race and Dead by daylight in one meme. That‚Äôs literally the only sub I follow ! 
---
Yeah, this happened to me as well multiple times as soon as the update came out
---
I‚Äôm trying to play spirit after the patch and I am so frustrated I would probably chainsaw one of these survivors irl
---
You can't equate public information with material goods, it makes for loosely fitting analogies.
---
I haven't seen the movies in a while but "Mettle of Man" is a big part of the last season.
---
BORROWED TIME IS CURRENTLY BUGGED AGAINST THE PLAUGE AND SINCE EVERYONE IS PLAYING HER I CANT USE IT. I HAVE SMALL GAME INSREAD TO LEARN TOTEM PLACEMENTS AND SUCH BUT I KEEP FORGETTING THAT I DONT HAVE BT AND WONDERING WHY MY TEAMMATE GETS DOWNED WHEN I GO FOR THE SAVE
---
Possed is the only one i dont like but everyone else i like. Because you should have some fear going to the basement. And if you can speed up recovery you should get to slow it down.
---
I doubt that lol. The only reason anyone ever doesn't die to Freddy is either because of plot armor or plot induced stupidity. In the movies, he's really fucking powerful, they just never ever show it. 
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. It‚Äôs just tricky for DBD cause in one way it shouldn‚Äôt have rank cause it isn‚Äôt really that kind of game but in another way we don‚Äôt want high skilled killers and survivors to stomp on the low skill players. So what to do is tricky and I hope the devs find a way to find that balance 
---
I have been having the same issue since the new patch. As a killer, all players DC within 5 minutes. As a survivor, I DC at any random time in a match but it acts as the killer DC'd. Testing SWF is what revealed to me that I was the one disconnecting. Never had issues before the update. Im at a complete loss on how to fix this. Verify and clean reinstall have been done.
---
I honestly don't care about my rank so this means for my average and sometimes above average play I should stay where I am as opposed to getting into the red ranks and playing the same people/killers over and over again. 
---
I see this as a "win-win-win" - in the voice of Michael Gary Scott
---
Its an unpopular opinion and I know it'll get downvotes but Ill say if its TV show Ash I will be a little less interested. I really love Evil Dead all the way through to the remake. I love all those movies. But I just couldnt get into the TV show at all, I just wasnt a fan. I really hope its Evil Dead II Ash. Again just my opinion.

---
And if there's a pallet she can't instahit you after, which is exactly the same as hitting you before you can vault with any other killer. You got caught out in the open and ran in a straight line, like...
---
Yeah no shit she'll get you down quick.
---
&gt;  it‚Äôs going to be all Billy and Nurse [...] they messed with the audio
---
I certainly won't be playing any killer until they fix the audio, it's ridiculous atm (Nurse main).
---
I imagine his response would be the grunt Legion does at the end of Feral Frenzy.
---
This happened to me too when I spectated after a match. Also, I get this weird bug that, when I load into a match, it gets me the prompt to ‚Äúwiggle‚Äù and I can‚Äôt move my left stick in the way that I would to wiggle or else it stops my character from moving. 
---
My thoughts exactly. 
---
it was too easy before, it is too ridiculous now. If i sit and do a gen or 2, the game is over in 5 mins and I can't pip.
---
If I get chased by the killer, I can't pip because I didn't do any else.It doesn't make sense. It doesn't matter what you do, unless you have the game of your life you cannot pip. 
---
I assumed it was just bad for me as rank 1 surv, but it's horrific for anything above shit rank... 
---
The right idea they just went too far the other way.
---
Ian Malcolm new survivor confirmed. 
---
Tbh a mori animation where the killer pulls out a gun to execute might be badass
---
Is it? I mean the one time I saw it recently, he seemed legitimately irked that people hadn‚Äôt donated. I could‚Äôve misread it I guess.
---
Personally I‚Äôm gonna have fun in this casual game, so I will be giving up rank 1 for this gladly!
---
That doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the doctor is getting every affliction from all of his separate add ons in one add on. Which allows doctors to run an iridescent king plus an electrode- which drastically increases madness gained per shock. Not to mention just being in doc‚Äôs terror radius when he is in treatment increases your madness. The afflictions are annoying enough to cause survivors to have to adjust their playstyle entirely around that one addon. 
---
I guess the game thinks you are still in her shoulder (?
---
They'll probably give that to the killer, might as well give him an assault rifle with quickdraw extended mags based on how they're going with the plague... I'm already *sick* of this killer  [üòÇ](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/)

---
DO THE DEVS PLAY THEIR OWN GAME OR EVEN TRY TO GENUINELY RANK UP??? THAT SHIT IS IMPOSSIBLE NOWADAYS IF YOU WANT TO BE A DISTRACTION TO THE KILLER. PLEASE REVERT THE RANKING SYSTEM BACK OR DO SOMETHING ELSE, JUST DON'T FUCK UP THIS BADLY. THIS GAME WILL BE A FUCKING WANK STAIN IF YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.](/intensifies)
---
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see shot out this thing‚Äù
---
Killer definitely has a much harsher learning curve imo. But that said, once I really began to understand how to combat each loop and optimize my time, I 4K more often than I even escape as survivor at this point. I'm probably a 55/45 survivor/killer split at this point, but it gets a lot better with more practice. I guess my point is that everyone is gonna have a different experience. Killer is objectively less "chill", but its only as stressful as you make it. 
---
Though I mostly agree, there is a point where getting over 20k is pretty good, and only getting a safety plp is a little dumb if you ask me.
---
s u c c
---
I meant before the update, not now.
---
Where 4x Claudette?
---
how do you fuck something up that bad
---
I've played against a few Bills that DC as soon as I down them. Maybe it's the same Bill though. 
---
I agree survivor can be a really easy going experience while killer is ALWAYS focused and stressing but if you're a really good killer you can stress the survivors out just as much, if not more. But let me say, this new addition of plague is very nice. Not sure if this sub completely agrees, but i feel like plague is one of the most balanced killers in this game. She can absolutely shit on people if played well and survivors can absolutely shit on her if they play against her properly. I feel like it's a straight 50/50 4k- or 4 escape
---
For me Billy is actually disputed. He doesn't have too many antiloop tools. But maybe it's only me :D Although I think he is disputed just like Spirit is(cause people dispute who's better - IMO Spirit btw).  
---
Hag and Clown are probably the most disputed :D
---
ehhh she's not bad. i see a lot of mixed reviews but i think she is one of the most balanced killers. I mean to be fair i havent been puked on from 20 meters away yet but if you play against the corrupt puke properly you can beat her
---
The entity has chosen her! She is now it's avatar! 
---
BP IS A DIRECT RESULT OF GAMEPLAY. OBVIOUSLY IF YOU EARN 25K IN ONE GAME YOU DID A FUCK TON. 
---
Also addon to this spirit without addons loses a lot of map pressure because of how long it takes for her power to recharge at base. Billy still has his chainsaw for both and isn‚Äôt punished too hard without addons. 
---
The counter play is to walk a different direction, if you walk towards the husk you only have yourself to blame. 
---
I really appreciate your input. Writing isn't something i do a lot but i like to think i'm decent at it. I'm sure i will find more opportunities to write some silly little short stories on this sub
---
The good ol days.
---
Yeah I know and my point still stands. You got massively long waiting times when playing at both red ranks and rank 20.
---
Seriously, the new MM is terrible. I used to get instaqueues, pretty much 24/7 as killer. But now they make me wait a few minutes just to start collecting survivors, and the lobbies still break if someone leaves? It's pretty deeply unpleasant.
---
Yeah the devs just need to get some braincells if you ask me. 
---
I've been seeing this ritual posted, is it actually seconds or just a typo?
---
I just wish that they'll change it back or make it easier because I don't have the achievement for getting to rank 1.
---
This. And as I said in other replies to this comment train the community there is very toxic and the moderators do very little to quell it. You can harass people nonstop for giving "bad advice" or asking honest questions about "common knowledge" since you're new. When I was a part of that Discord I saw countless newcommers ask honest new player questions like "who should I play first?" or "who's the best character?" just to be laughed at and shunned by the Rank 1 elitists.
---
But hey at least the bots will automatically ban you if you accidentally typo "kyf" as "kys!" Banning people who say that sometimes the best strategy to save your allies in the end-game is to kill yourself (because you said "kill yourself") will certainly help foster a postive environment! Automatically filtering out "toxic" word combinations sure beats dealing with actual toxicity! And you don't have to do any work either! :D
---
Chances of it being AoD Evil Ash are pretty low, given the licensing issues.
---
This reminds me of Fnaf for some reason, but whatever
---
Ideally you want to get the gens done and not let your team down. What are you going to do? Sit in a corner and do nothing. If so I'm glad you aren't my teammate.
---
Some folks don't realize Glock is a brand.
---
Sometimes you just can't avoid it though, there's quite a few loops she can shoot over, even when crouching... I've only been playing as Jane though so maybe the puke is clipping on all that THICC? idk
---
The OP said the DBD Discord, which I assume is a reference to the official DBD discord. This isn't about the reddit.
---
Also sound clips being found is datamning. It's one thing for users to extract files from a program, it's another thing for the DBD devs to accidentally put those files in a place easily accessible by the public. And I can guarantee you if a DBD dev commented on the Freddy leak in public that's because the rights holders for Nightmare on Elm Street gave them the go ahead. That's their prerogative.
---
This man. I got 1M saved for her which aint too bad but damn I almost got destroyed by the same thing you mentioned. They even sabo my hooks when I was about to hook one of their SWF
---
A pallet hitting a trapper. Brings Back memories.
---
People also seem to forget that spirit has to pick between map pressure and chase potential-she can't pick both. whereas Billy has both at all times

Kind of a strange choice as the show got cancelled. If it got picked back up, great! If not, just a weird choice. A groovy choice to be sure but a strange one. 
---
I honestly have no idea. I'll go into a match and let you know. :)
---
I would love to know how they decided that low-rank games should take 9 minutes to finish. Decent survivors will churn out all their gens in about 4 if you're lucky, and then you just have to try and scoop them up during the gate opening since that's when they decide to play stupid.
---
I know the internal testing team aren't red ranks, but surely they're not so bad that they actually take that long to finish gens?
---
This happened the other day when I was playing with my friend against a Myers. I got one hooked and was already dead so I was just waiting for the match the end, and my friend told me that he could see everywhere Myers went when he got hooked. It's pretty broken. 
---
I gotta try this with Quick and Quiet + Head On when there's two lockers near each other :D
---
The problem I have with the situation is that they are trying to enforce a rule in a way that is totally pointless. It's more like trying to prosecute someone for sharing the krabby patty secret formula after it was accidentally posted to twitter by Mr. Krabs. There's no point in trying to suppress the spread of information that is already public.  
---
  
---
If they want to enforce a rule that prevents the spreading of leaks, then that's their business. I am more inclined to believe that the rule exists to prevent people from spreading false leaks to get attention. I don't think that posting something you found in-game should result in a ban or qualify as a "leak." Sharing a post you found on a forum from someone pretending to be a BHVR employee, and sharing an in game screenshot, are two entirely different things. If the mods disagree with me on this, then I am forced to believe that they think they can control the spreading of information by manipulating a very small part of the total online presence of the DBD community.
---
I wished Head on actually worked, every single time the killer is right in front of the locker and they still don‚Äôt get stunned. Even after waiting 3 seconds with no exhaustion, it just doesn‚Äôt work
---
You don't have a single irridecent and you're honestly complaining about the pip system? Strange, as a killer I'm still double pipping with 3 or more irridecents at the end. Get good.
---
Who cares? Pipping is not even a good outcome for a match. What does it win you? A load of stress going against 4 man swf
---
Love to see this.  This guy  and his community are the embodiment of toxic behaviour, He literally bullies people in his chat who have a differing opinion and gets everyone to disrespect you as well.
---
This is pay back for that one game I had where all the pallets were invisable.
---
This concept is freaking amazing. Like some others have said, there are definitely some issues, but the overall concept seems super awesome!! Keep it up!
---
I think its just a bit over the top, but, if they slightly nerf it and also make killer emblems a bit harder then it will be balances.
---
THERE'S STILL A LITTLE IN THE CUP!!! SALVAGE IT, PLEASE!!
---
Dude... Have you read my previous post?
---
I experienced so much bug last night,i decided to take a break for a few days. Or until some of the bugs are fixed. I HOPE it won't take a few weeks or months.
---
Arbitrary rules =/= Unethical behavior.
---
Happened to me last night hahaha was so spooky 
---
I can have just a little bit of fun seeing how I had to solo gen 
---
Thank you for your service.
---
WHEN I SEARCH A GAME ON PS4 AS A SURVIVOR AND THE KILLER HAS MODERATE OR STRICT NAT TYPE IT THROWS ME OUT BECAUSE I HAVE STRICT (NAT3) WTF
---
If that is the case then BHV should make it 16 points to Pip for Ranks 1-4 and anything else you Depip. If you cannot get 4x Iridescent every match you are not good enough
---
If I did my fill of gens then I'm going balls to wall medic mode, protect the deathhooks or pull the killer to chase me. Also truffle, I mean totem hunting kills time and battles any possible surprise NOED. If getting out as fast as possible is your main objective then I really suggest you review the point conditions for each emblem. Of you have to do more than 2 1/2 to 3 gens in a match then you have some serious dead weight on your team. 
---
They‚Äôre fixing it by breaking it in the other direction, this shit pisses me off with games, instead of increments small enough that it isn‚Äôt miserable and we can find a change fluidly they spike it to oblivion. Say instead of making it harder by 120% off the hop, do 40% jumps??? If  40 is too low, maybe 80% is fine, that way we can fine tune shit instead of smashing it like a subscribe button and wondering why everyone‚Äôs upset... ( numbers used are examples not actual numbers) 
---
That's just a P4 Claudette.
---
No, they will reset to clean and you will automatically get your Corrupt Purge. 
---
Apparently it‚Äôs been happening to a good couple of people. Fucking hell. 
---
Sometimes I‚Äôm waiting to see if the survivor they downed is dead on hook or if I should try to save them. Or to make sure other survivors are okay/meet me at the gates. But I agree 100% about teabagging, it is the worst.
---
i hope they can buff wake up to 25% or 30% exit gate opening speed.
---
It seperates yourself to a group of people with a skill level similar to yours. If barely anybody can rank up, then the lower ranks is just a cess pool of good and shitty players.
---
This game is bullshit for killers.
---
Straight up.
---
you could just wait outside of the gate then its like 3 more steps
---
I feel like Bruce Campbell would get an absolute kick of having Ash in Dead by Daylight
---
Ikr? I killed them all, didn't tunnel (as Wraith) and I did not camp.
---
Black pipped. 
---
See, I would expect it from a Claudette, but a Feng--Really? 
---
You know what, valid point. You‚Äôre right!
---
Such a survivor sided map
---
Mind telling me how recent the tweet was, I can't open it. Blocked at the computer I'm at lol.
---
Also perpetuates hard camping/tunnel builds despite the counter to hard campers is "just do gens fast" netting them an extra unearned 1-2 kills, or like in my previous LF game, a 4k. In other cases its mostly fine, particularly in a back and forth game but these people and builds/tactics really suck the fun out of the game. 
---
At this point it is yeah. I dont care about ranking up to red ranks really but the sheer fact that you have to jump through so many hoops is ridiculous 
---
Is massively like 3 min? In my region thats the worst waiting scenario. Not sure if we had the same situation.
---
Thank you for explaining this. I was about to question OP myself because I didn't understand. But now I do. So thank you random internet dogooder.
---
I give no shits about pipping, I just want to get more than 1 hook and 3000 points before the game is over.
---
No he was the other survivor died early and left the chat 
---
Yet I see every bad killer use noed, so clearly it's not easy for them, and clearly they are obligated to use it under the notion that it's the only way they'll get a kill, hence why I consider it to be an extreme crutch. If you get more kills from noed than just playing the game on average, the perk's doing more than it should, because literally no other perk would give as many undeserved kills
---
I love when they don‚Äôt seem to realise you have Corrupt and teabag at a pallet only to get injured or downed, then the rage DC comes.
---
EVERY FUCKING LOBBY I JOIN HAS OVER 500MS AND AFTER FINALLY FINDING A LOBBY WITH A DECENT CONNECTION, I GET FACECAMPED AND FARMED BY THE FUCKING PLAGUE
---
It's like a shapeshifter killer but in reverse
---
This dude has been looped to many times
---
I'm sad that there aren't voice commands in DBD so I can crouch-walk around with a ~~sandvich~~medkit and spam "pootis" (or whatever the equivalent would be)
---
You do realize that the game already currently favors Killers with every map having a 53% or above Kill Rate and almost every Killer having an over 50% Kill Rate, right?
---
This would basically be a Buff for Killers since they get the slowdown effect for Ruin without having to use a Perk spot for it.  The only way for this to make sense would be if the Killers were also nerfed somehow to balance it out.
---
Dead by South Side of Chicago 
---
A bad nurse will get shitstomped, but a good nurse will shitstomp every single game. Whether she requires skill to play or not doesn't justify the fact that she can down faster than any other killer no matter who she's chasing, or where she's chasing them. There's no win condition for her. You don't have to outplay the survivor nearly as hard as you would, even if you played billy, the second best killer. 
---
You 100% don't need it on her, and if you do, either get better at her, or play a killer with a lower skill cap. If you're playing her because she's as strong as she is, but you are terrible at her, you shouldn't compensate with an unbalanced perk on a completely broken character, you should simply play other characters
---
Yeah me too, hopefully it gets sorted soon though 
---
Rules aren‚Äôt even rules if they‚Äôre ‚Äúup to admin discretion‚Äù it then just becomes rough guidelines that are extremely hard to defend against.
---
This is customary for every single update they've ever done. Unfortunately it seems like they're falling behind on things. Haddonfield intro sound has been broken since Chapter 11 and it never got fixed. But the silver lining is that this update isn't as bad sound-wise as the last few. I couldn't even play chapter 11. This one is definitely more tolerable than that build was. Still not great though.
---
I wouldn't call the devs idiots. They make smart choices, and make bad ones. the Plague is pretty well designed, and balanced, along with her perks. The ranking system sucks. There is good, and bad, try to remember that.
---
Ps plus free is neat but when I already have the game I‚Äôm like ‚Äúgee i sure hope nobody thinks I got it for free! I‚Äôm not a noob I swear‚Äù
---
4k more often then u escape!!??? Either ur a terrible survivor a shitty rank killer or a liar
---
I combine dance with me and lithe. Best combo ever. 
---
I like it when they waste time at the exit gates.  I'm not familiar with the maps at all‚Äîin fact I went to the chapel for the very first time just last night.  When they waste time with antics at the exit gates, that gives me loads of unpressured time to look around the map and help me get familiar with the basic layouts.
---
In fact, a lot of times, once the exit gates are open I just ignore survivors completely, even if they're still "in play" in the map somewhere; and instead I just start exploring.
---
I‚Äôd swap huntress and Michael, huntress can be dodged and she‚Äôs 110% so u don‚Äôt think she deserves A tier 
---
Well i'm not talking about difficulty, i'm talking about anxiety and stress. Sometimes ill play as survivor and not pay attention for like 50% of the game if i'm not being chased. it's easy to relax, maybe have eat some food while you play, but killer, your eyes have to be glued, your ears have to be open, you start to get that adrenaline rush and you're closing on a survivor about to swing and you know that if they move a certain way or have a perk you may not hit, it's just plain stressful lol even when im whipping their ass i'm on the edge of my seat and leaning into my hits lol
---
Because he'd already won.
---
2 or 3 is possible, but escaping then becomes considerably less possible because there's a very high likelihood someone else is also attempting to rescue, so you're wasting time having two people not on a generator, while the third is most likely being chased. Getting 30-40K points while also playing the game as intended isn't going to happen on the survivor more than maybe one in three games, at best
---
It kinda looks like it‚Äôs an image of the 9mm pistol from FNV.
---
No I escape through the hatch even tho he was trying to block me from getting in 
---
If it works, it could be useful for people studying away from home where the main gaming rig is (my case).
---
There‚Äôs no point in a spoiler if it‚Äôs in the title
---
Yeah, me too until I realized poised activates with any gen going off and I have lost many killers without vaulting mid-chase. You can essentially get a free dance with me for 10 seconds opposed to three. 
---
Girl, I screamed! Haha
---
Billy with sprint burst, all you'd need really
---
I
---
lmao you see that new monto video? That shit was hilarious when that person threw the pallet and you downed them with the puke. Some people don't like the plague but i love her whether im killer or survivor
---
Bro it‚Äôs not called effective strike either 
---
It‚Äôs definitely be a game-changer. Although so far, I‚Äôve had better luck as Plague by not breaking pallets and baiting survivors to them to get puke shots. It‚Äôs an interesting change of play so far. 
---
TraPC
---
That's exactly what it is. The 9mm in New Vegas is based off the Browning Hi Power. 
---
That sounds terrifying, but - billy can‚Äôt sprint to activate it, and if he could he‚Äôd have to stop moving for exhaustion.
---
Watching this clip, I realized I did that once or twice out of habit last night
---
Oh I didn't know that. Now I'm totally gonna try that out! Act
---
The even dumber thing too is that your teammates  guaranteed Depiped too since they would have had basically 0's for Altruism and Being Chased.  The Killer obviously Depipped for hardly any hooks or kills.  The fact that All Survivors AND Killer can Depip in a game is dumb.
---
I'm grasping the concept dude, but the math that you are talking about isn't even worth mentioning. Yes a lot of this game s based on math, but you cant apply that information in a tier list, tier lists are straight opinion. Later dude
---
*Ain't my fault you fall for my pallet loops*
---
*Gotta blame it on my jukes,* 
---
*gotta blame it on my jukes baby!*
---
This came to me at 3 in the morning and I couldn't get it out of my head, so you all have to suffer too.
---
Happened to me on the first week I got the game. I got my Laurie strode to level 40, and the next day it got resetted back to level 26
---
Kk
---
I am definitely liking effectiveness ones the best. Rubbing oil is awesome. The apple add-ons are also okay and have potential to really get a good head start on everyone with Corrupt Intervention in play. 
---
LOL that's why its called a shitpost XD
---
*wast
---
I feel that wraith needs add-ons to be b tier.
---
Oh wow, thanks for the great info. Question, does totem cleansing time reset when the survivor leaves it?
---
Am i the only one actually happy about the new system? I personally don't like to get into red ranks in a week and face only 2000h meta perk killers. Much nicer to stay at low ranks :D 
---
Very very true lmfao
---
&gt;Some people take this game too seriously
---
*gets offended at someone pressing ctrl*
---
Oh I didn't know that. Now I'm definitely gonna try it out!  It sounds 10 times better than what I'm using right now. 
---
50 LEVELS INTO PLAGUE, HUNTRESS, CLOWN, AND HAG, AMD STILL NO FUCKING BBQ ON ANY OF THEM 
---
I FUCKING RAN OUT OF BLEACH AFTER DOING WHAT MOM SAID AND WASHING MY CLOTHES 
---
Legion is easily D tier if he doesnt abuse the moonwalk/look at floor
---
?
---
Yes indeed. And the alert from Thrill of the Hunt will always be there for dull and lit totems, until the lit totem assigned to Thrill is actually cleansed. 
---
God, I hope they get the actual rights to Bruce Campbell's likeness.
---
Uninstalling and moving on????? Just because you cant rank up anymore in a game where rank 1 only gave you longer queque times and sweatier matches?
---
Never was to begin with
---
*rolls off the table*
---
Quick question, i notice you worded this as "until they are broken" so basically she gains/loses tokens if it's enough to break them but the tokens are not gained/lost if you simply just puke?
---
I mean, there would be no notification when the survivor goes into the basement whatsoever. It‚Äôd kind of be a roll of the dice perk.
---
I've seen it happen in spectator mode, it's never happened to me personally tho
---
hmm
---
I probably should have put that I play on console so nurse isnt AS good as she is on PC but still the best. that's why spirit is up there with her.
---
I think it's new, never noticed Nea yell while falling down; now she has like 3 different sounds that play.
---
What they can do is make Ash a killer, and when survivors are matched against him their character models are replaced with killers instead of their regular appearance. 
---
I thought Jeff was carrying her
---
There's a perk in-game that is potentially better at t1 right now and it's Make Your Choice, at t1 the expose and cooldown is 40 seconds and at t3 it's 60 seconds for both.
---
A good killer can easily make use of it in 40 seconds and have it ready for another rescue earlier.
---
Has anybody noticed the optimization on console? I'm not to tech smart so I don't quite understand the optimization they said they did for chapter 11 and what their next step is 
---
From Dev streams in the past
---
Wraiths stealth is still effective. Hes at least okay tier. Trapper and leatherface are worse imo
---
Exactly! But that‚Äôs above and beyond BhVR‚Äôs dev team! There brains might melt... 
---
Preach, brother. Embrace the downvotes from people who think they deserve a cookie for everything they do.
---
Its so annoying
---
I‚Äôm in class so I can‚Äôt play sound, but she didn‚Äôt happen to have that perk where she gives you her terror radius by any chance? Off the top of my head maybe that could‚Äôve bugged out when she received it back after you were hooked.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs happened to me a lot. Dunno why :/
---
I got tea bagged on my first game learning the plague by a swf group lol.
---
I'll chime in here.
---
I'm desperately hoping this turns out ok. The Switch has (and still is) a life saver when it comes to gaming and it thrives on the "have a quick game" style DBD offers.
---
There's also a lot more older gamers than you realize that own or have access to a Switch. If I told four of the ones I know "Hey, they're putting out a game where you can be Mike Myers or Leatherface and kill other players!", two would know of the game and would look into it. 
---
My point is, the market is certainly there.
---
Im buying it anyway
---
How can you blame the killer for using a perk you allow him to activate?
---
It ends the match faster so everyone can move on to an actual game.
---
This happens sometimes when you go to spectate after you‚Äôve died as well
---
I don't remember her perks since this happened last night but that would make sense if that's what's bugging it out. But I've seen it happening to other people with different killers.
---
Yes so so difficult. I had to put kindred on because no one would get me off the hook yesterday I lost my rank 2 and now I can‚Äôt seem to get it back. 
---
I'm still annoyed that the trailer implied the Legion would pretend to be a survivor, and then they just don't do that 
---
I see your point. They have the authority to create rules that they deem necessary for the community to function. On the other hand, what do you do if you want to be a part of the community, and disagree with a rule that they have? When I see a rule that I think is poorly made or enforced, I do the only think I can. I speak out about it and try to offer arguments against it.  
---
Rules should be based on reason, not just the opinions of people in authority. It's different when you go to someone's private discord server. There you are expected to follow their rules, just as you would if you went to someone's home. In a private setting you can have whatever rules you want. A public discord server is used by a community. I would expect that the rules reflect opinions that can be agreed upon by the community, and argued for with reason. I'm sure an argument can be made that the server is more private because it's controlled by the mods, but it requires the participation of the community to function and serve its purpose.
---
&gt; -survivors only armed with flashlight
---
Sounds like regular SWF for me
---
Same. I stopped playing for a few months because other games got released, so I'm down in white ranks. I literally can not rank up because people keep quitting before I get the first hook and let other survivors die on first hook. I don't know what I'm supposed to do to get out of these ranks if the parameters make it so that I literally can not get the points to pip
---
Nice
---
I JUkED ThE KiLLeR. 360s 4 EvER. WhErES mY PiP??
---
and I dont mean to have a shitty attitude about it, but I assumed we had all known for a long time that the old ranking system took zero skill to advance. This is challenging, and I welcome it. It's going to require a lot of people to rethink how they play their matches. It'll make for better teammates, and it'll make for skillful killers. I'm not sure where that's a problem to people. 
---
They really need to define how far the effect area is outside of the locker. 
---
Whack. Ok thank you
---
I don‚Äôt know why that guy got downvoted but yea I know it‚Äôs stupid but according to the game even in that situation where they‚Äôre close to stage 2 it still hurts your points if it‚Äôs an unsafe unhook
---
Back when he wasnt 350lbs. 
---
My favorite is having a kill ready while Myers and stabbing the bitches right before they touch the exit lol. 
---
My last one I swear Myers pulled her back through the exit it was so close lol. 
---
I think BHVR knew exactly what they were doing with that cosmetic.
---
Git gud
---
Am I correct in assuming those stats are from across all ranks?
---
Lol every time that happens I just stand at the gate and waste their time, and occasionally get a good NOED kill if they are stupid enough to walk up to me. 
---
where these 2k hours meta camping killers will be from now on as well lol enjoy 
---
And that's why I always down the snitch first
---
I mean, I'm happy for you to get enjoyment out of that but that sounds horribly boring to me. I mean there *are* literal farming simulators out there, so I may as well go for that instead.
---
High rank should be hard but not impossible. Right now it's essentially impossible.
---
Rank 1 should be maybe the top 10%; not the top 1%.
---
You'd see only Basement Bubbas for all eternity with this perk.
---
They have brains?
---
This killer can transfer her Terror Radius to you when she hits you. 
---
It‚Äôs only fair that you can transfer your camera to her when you very hooked. 
---
Lol, jk. 
---
Trapper is the only good killer on Haddonfield imo
---
Ah, I see what you mean! A timer/limit could be applied possibly for when it could be activated? To make it less powerful?
---
Rip to all the rank 1 urban evaders 
---
Oh good. Then you should know not to take something as trivial as an phrase/expression so seriously. The world hates us enough as is. Dont be THAT girl. 
---
Yeah, it‚Äôll probably get changed, cuz it seems like it‚Äôs very difficult at rank 10 killer I can only imagine at 2.
---
Had this happen while playing with a friend last night. I think I cycled back and forth too and his perspective was just her
---
"When a survivor is downed 1/2/3 times" would need to be ordered 3/2/1 for tier 3 to be the best. As it was posted, one would need to down a survivor 3 times at tier 3 to shoot them but only once at tier 1.
---
I was making the point that even though I was expecting someone to have posted about that error, the way in which top commentator phrased his comment still had me laughing.
---
Wasted gif
---
Jane.exe not found
---
Because people love Sam Raimi's films.
---
For real though, if you post there they'll treat you like a patron saint
---
I only implied that you are making wrong conclusions from my words.
---
And yes I don't get it when people criticize harshly the rules of small communities that are you free to join/avoid if those rules aren't breaking any human laws.
---
You are free to call me stupid for such opinion, I am free to call your ways of participating in this discussion unpleasant for me. 
---
Commenting to follow. (: 
---
 Thought I saw this a while back, wasn‚Äôt it made for a contest?
---
Can we change this shit back please!
---
Some think she's weak some think she's balanced. Learn to play her and you will be good. Most balanced killer in my opinion. But also people complain about getting hit by the corrupt puke from far away. I haven't been hit with that yet but i think she's great. very fun, very different from the usual way this game is played
---
Scrub here; what is your killer BP farming setup? I've got Doc with the Terror Radius increase and BBQ; anything else I can do to get those sweet sweet BPs?
---
Then the gun jam‚Äôs... 
---
What's that smell?
---
I smell a hotfix needed
---
Color blind killer here. Still not convinced scratch marks are a real thing... üôÅ
---
Not that hard to not immediately 4k if you wanna pip, the point of the game isn‚Äôt to kill all the survivors as fast as possible 
---
This made me LOL. 
---
Certainly a time to adjust ones gameplay!
---
You da real MVP.
---
He used to be super toxic back in the day. He played against me one time, and despite downing him several times easily he went on to ggez at the end of the game. He would teabag at every pallet, and just generally act like a dick on his stream.
---
He's a good survivor, I'll give him that but he's a good example of the worst kind of behavior for new people coming into the community.
---
At this point every pistol is a glock 
---
True, I gave them to much credit!
---
If I had gold I‚Äôd give it to you
---
I SHOULD HAVE EARNED 3 NEW ACHIEVEMENTS ALREADY BUT SINCE THEY ARE BROKEN THEY DIDN'T REGISTER
---
Okay, so...
---
Speaking of ranking from the killer perspective, if you absolutely crush the match you will not pip. And that's just stupid, a 4k should be a pip regardless of how it was achieved. Eliminating all 4 is a "victory" if you want to call it that.
---
It's hard to define what makes you pip in this game because people see "victory" different. If I kill all 4 I consider my job done and thus I won, however, I see no way to "win" as a survivor because escaping doesn't really mean I was the reason I escaped. 9/10 times I feel like the people who die as a survivor are the real winners because they made sure their teammates could get out, that's how it is being on a team rather than a solo player.
---
I agree that ranking up was too easy before and I do not have a solution for it, but it's quite harsh as it is right now. It shouldn't punish you for crushing your opponent. To me rank 1 should be a place where the sweat is pouring out of every player and it's just not, it's a place for people who just play a lot. Until that changes, I will continue to say that rank does not matter because it's not a showcase of skill it's a showcase of you playing a lot.
---
If you think about it logically, right now if you stomp you de-rank or don't rank up at all. Counter-intuitive, that just means the lower rank the better the player? Maxing multiple categories doesn't mean you are better than others, maybe the killer couldn't catch the guy for 5 gens thus there was never any way to get altruism points?
---
**TL;DR**
---
The new system makes takes away the problem of making ranking up too easy, but it doesn't solve the overall issue the ranking system has.
---
Really good! I would just swap Huntress with Hag.
---
Thanks a lot. Any views on her in comparison to the pig? I main her ATM but am struggling to get past rank 12 due to looping. I don't have enough time to invest into the nurse to get good at her, and was wondering if you had any views on her being able to be a substitute for huntress or nurse so I can get to higher ranks. Thanks again
---
It‚Äôs the thought that counts friend
---
I GOT 3K WITH ONE DC AS PLAGUE AND DON'T EVEN SAFETY. NEXT GAME I GET 3K 1DC AND DOUBLE PIP. WTF?????
---
I have to do some further testing on this... As the killer, I 2 pipped twice out of the 4 games I played last night and the other two I 1 pipped. Is it just simply more difficult with survivor? I've seen a lot of these posts get upvotes lately so I know it's not just a couple people having problems adjusting. Just curious if it's a survivor thing or if I was just lucky enough not to notice it (yet) on the killers side!
---
OoO buff LEAKED
---
For sure, I'm not saying it won't be useful to anyone, and I'm not saying no one has a switch, I know lots of people do. But what's the likelihood that they don't have a PC or console already as well? The game was given away completely free on PS4 and it's cheap as hell on Steam, usually &lt;$10 so most people who have heard of it and have wanted it, probably have it. The point I will give you is the portable nature of the Switch. If you're such a busy guy that you can literally only fit a single game in while you're taking your daily shit or something like that, it'll probably be a Godsend, but overall, to me, it seems unnecessary. Not apposed to a wider audience having the game or anything though, makes the reddit more fun :)
---
Get down misses president!
---
Are you suggesting the killer is... the woods themselves?  
---
I don't know atm. Gonna try tomorrow again. Where I can report it if it still persist?
---
Lmao would love to have this perk
---
The guys calls him a cool uncle, while the girls call him daddy
---
If you're referring to pharmacy... 
---
It's all ranks
---
I swear this is the most biggest update they ever released.
---
Mommy uwu
---
US KILLER MAINS WON'T GIVE YOU SHIT BECAUSE IT SUCKS FOR US AS WELL. HOOK 2 SURVIVORS AND NOBODY SAVES THEM? DOWNRANK. 
---
not fun as survivor either
---
Lol no it wasn‚Äôt 
---
HAVE A NICE FUCKING CAKE DAY!
---
For me personally, I usually do Huntress with BBQ 3, Beast of Prey 3, and Distressing 2 for BP gains as well as Ruin 3 to slow the game down. I also run it with no addons or offerings so that I don't funnel those points right back into Huntress to restock. If I manage to hook everyone 2x and fill up in all categories I walk away with 60k per game, and if I have a really bad game I still usually walk away with 30k. Also I don't bother killing since I'm not playing to win anyway and I don't need that sweat or salt in my life lol
---
Come on, Ace is too much of a vagabond to be a dad. Or at least a good dad. He could've fathered kids but he doesn't seem like the type that would stay around.
---
Prepare for the downvotes...
---
IF THEY DON'T CHANGE THIS RANK 1 WILL BE NOTHING BUT UNSTOPPABLE SWEATY NURSES. 
---
Muh 4K... 
---
WHY FUCKING THANK YOU! 
---
My reaction vs Huntress, Pig, Susie or Julie tbh.
---
Dude I still play this whenever I visit my parents! 
---
Found it at a local game show, there were some others as well, so very possibly
---
I see nothing wrong her, they have the same idea for game balance, as i have for diet balance. 
---
Shit i just knocked my 2 FKCs buckets of the table and cant get them up the ground ! HELP ! 
---
the amount of times ive done both gens then my whole team dies is enormous. I think its there for the people like me who is the best part of the team to have a chance to "get out".

Good to know achievements are working. I was scared to try because people were saying it wasn't working. Idk what TOTH is lmao. Yeah i've noticed the gen rush too. As far as addons, she's not necessarily add on dependent, if you want that broken status one shot then yeah you need add ons but after you realize that you don't always have to try to get them broken, you will do a lot better. get em sick, get em down, let em hit the fountain, then corrupt purge them into oblivion. I was expecting it to be easier to put them into broken but i quickly realized that that isn't something you can depend on unless you use add ons
---
You mean downed once. And you aren't robbing your teammates of their emblems if they're all either dead on hook or too dumb to do gens.
---
You're not totally wrong tbh. I probably should've used the word "entertaining" or maybe "is too stressful" instead of fun.
---
Yes but you can hear her flashlight click click click..................
---
much response
---
I would discuss those rules with mods and on reddit to try and get attention. I just don't like when people think they are right for breaking rules and call moderators morons. 
---
My only change to this would be instead of 2 prayer locations make 4 and they can only be used once so killers (especially ones like billy and nurse) can't just go back and forth from both of them and basically camp them. This also makes it so the survivors can't get lucky and all spawn together on a prayer location and basically negate the effect it's supposed to have. But I do think this is a good idea to help with the gen time without having to always use ruin or have a 3 gen strat. 
---
More than half the time they're braindead and untrustworthy. Still waiting on that Freddy rework btw. 
---
Fishes sure could use those RGB fans tho!
---
Bruh
---
Ahhh, see I cant speak on that because I dont main killer. I play killer for fun sometimes when I'm beyond sick of potato teammates in solos, and none of my SWF squad are available. 
---
I main Trapper for Gods sake, lol so take what I say with a grain of salt. But I'll speak on what I think I know.
---
I can see where that's frustrating for you. But are you breaking down every bit of the game and your matches as you need to?
---
Are you hunting, and finding survivors quickly and staying on them? Are you gatekeeping, and interrupting generator repair? Are you being devious when you can be? Are you making sacrifices in a timely manner?
---
I think all of these factors come together to pip or de pip a killer. Yes, essentially a 4k is a victory but you're now rated and ranked on HOW you achieved that 4k.
---
Is the list relative to each killers gameplay with add ons? Or just relative to each other? Because spirit is pretty add on reliant to maintain a high tier, much moreso than say huntress or billy
---
My heart kept out of my chest and I'm only watching the vid
---
24 hours since what lol? The rank reset was days ago and its a fact, that its not hard to rank up lol
---
Like the one user said, at least get hooked so you wasted some time. I played a game as Legion the other day, and I main him, sue me. During this game I had an entire team DC within 30 seconds, 30 blasted seconds. I wasn‚Äôt running Franks, I hadn‚Äôt even managed to hit anyone at that point. Not a single generator had been done, nothing. I don‚Äôt care who the killer is, that is absolutely stupid. It‚Äôs always the moonwalking/tunneling argument too. Not every single Legion player is gonna play that way with him. But at the end of the day, my argument is this: if you have that big of a problem with one killer, to the point you dc just by seeing him, just play something else. He isn‚Äôt OP, Franks is good, but he isn‚Äôt OP. The hate for Legion is just mind numbing at this point 
---
I had this happen as one of the survivors, although I don‚Äôt blame them for not knowing that the Wraith has a perk that legit silences his bell.
---
I do blame them for not trying to hide from the guy and work on gens. The three immediately DC when he gets them, and I just let the Wraith hook me because I don‚Äôt even think farming would have pipped either of us.
---
Tifa probably would say something like that
---
I never knew how bad Ace was till I played him. Dude is super quiet. Very easy to take advantage of.
---
I HAVE 35 HOURS IN THIS GAME AND IM SO BAD AND THE LEARNING CURVE IS INSANE AND ITS FRUSTRATING AND HAVING TO CONTROL THE CAMERA AND YOUR CHARACTER WITH THE SAME CONTROLS WHEN PLAYING SURVIVOR IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET THE HANG OF
---
God I wisb that were me
---
I think the survivor adept achievements are busted too. I went for Adept Jake and I pulled it off on the new map, except I got no achievement. Didn't get the Vulture achievement either. 
---
Old habits die hard
---
Really? What do you mean. The devs built that in on purpose?
---
So this is probably going to be same price as leather face? If released alone I‚Äôm guessing.
---
Hex: White privilege
---
We had this exact same thing happening yesterday.
---
Billy and nurse are "crutch" killers to you? You kinda had me with everything else but that is a ridiculous statement. Legion may be the only "crutch" killer but even that is a stretch... Unless he has Frank's...
---
Technically its always been bannable by eac but its so shit it doesnt actually pick up on it and you can use them anyway, far as im aware one person in the world has been banned for using them
---
Pretty sure this was one of the featured PCs for their Moddoween contest.

IMO Plague is much better than Pig. Pig's only option for dealing with loops is her dash which only works in very specific circumstances and can often be counter played. With Plague, once you get corrupted purge, you can shut down most loops, and if you EVER catch someone in the open it's just over. Aiming it takes a bit of getting used to, but it's nowhere near as high a learning curve as Nurse or Huntress.
---
The best part of a shite team is still shite.
---
what is the point of the game?
---
THEY NERFED BBQ TO 40 METERS NOW AND I WOULD RECOMMEND SPIES FROM THE SHADOWS BUT THEY NERFED THAT AS WELL. 
---
Adept achievements don't look at emblems at all, you just need to kill all 4 survivors.
---
Or you would, anyway. All the new DLC achievements are broken currently (on PC.)
---
&gt;ight. I seen the screenshots she sent but I didn't see what it actually looked like when she was running around. This is incredibly funny and completely unplayable.
---
Yeah, I quit the game shortly afterwards, think Billy wanted to farm tho
---
Sooo what i love about plague is that she is a mixture of all killers, shes a mixture of clown, huntress, pig. She's m1-ish like other killers, and can one shot if used properly like a billy or michael. She's comparable to pig because there are side objectives that slow them down a bit, except it doesn't slow them down as much, but makes you much more powerful because you get corrupt vomit. If you have problems at loops you might have the same issue with plague. I've had trouble at loops because if they're not broken or you don't have corrupt vomit, you're basically an m1 killer. BUT if you have corrupt you will shit on them at MOST loops. some walls are good cover for survivors. I don't really recommend her for gettting to lower ranks unless you get really good with her, and get good at knowing how \*GOOD\* survivors play her. Which is why i think she's so balanced, if you have mastered plague she will be very hard to beat, but if the survivors know how to outplay her tricks they will all escape 
---
Noed punish survivors that gen rush and don't waste a little time or one perk slot on looking for totems.
---
DUH THAT SHIT WAS OBVIOISLY WAY TO OP.
---
Looks like you're uninstalling then. Game will fall apart without you. That'll show them! ‚úä
---
Lol...poor feller
---
Looks like someone‚Äôs auto spell junk correct kicked in, let me guess Iphone?
---
I had my first game with her on Lery‚Äôs. It was okay, someone DCed, I got two hooks and one escaped through the hatch. I wanted to slug but I couldn‚Äôt find the other one, because that place is too small. I feel like this map is a disadvantage to her.
---
I was trying to do Adept Plague right away, so I should have also ran whispers just to be sure I could find them :P
---
I don‚Äôt go there as I‚Äôm lawless so Reddit is my home...
---
can only carry so hard dude
---
are you calling me a feller?? 
---
FIX THE GOD DAMN PS4 VERSION, IT LOOKS  HORRIBLE NOW, BLURRY AND SO LOW RES. IT SHOULDN'T LOOK LIKE THIS ON MY GOD DAMN PS4 PRO.
---
HIRE BETTER PROGRAMMERS IF YOU'RE INCAPABLE OF DOING IT RIGHT OR GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK.
---
All perks active mode: except no mither and ones that cancel out 
---
And what about Cowboy Jake?
---
I think that's a cool little updated audio cue for killers to help them hear which window a survivor may have jumped from. Back of the house, to the left, right, etc.
---
This game is best played with a headset as it's VERY auditory. Listening closely goes a lot way for a killer.
---
So you feel it‚Äôs entirely fair for a killer to do well only to be shafted out of s kill they by rights deserved so a survivor can get a free escape they didn‚Äôt actually earn. 2 gens completed isn‚Äôt a massive number or a major ask. So yeah, I expect a 4K in that scenario 
---
are you calling me a feller 
---
is the person supposed to just do the rest of the possible 3 gens w/o getting caught? there would be no point it‚Äôd just be an instant killer 4k, just smack the survivor and get a 4k with someone else
---
WHY WHENEVER I PLAY THE NEW KILLER I JUST GET TOXIC SWF GROUPS THAT DECIDE IT'S THEIR OBJECTIVE TO RUIN MY DAY?!
---
I was playing a pretty rough match yesterday as the Plague - the third and final game I played as her. One gen was left and I had only hooked/killed one person who killed themselves on first hook. I start chasing a Jane who teabags me after throwing the pallet down in killer shack. Jane isn‚Äôt great so I down her shortly thereafter and camp her. (I‚Äôm sorry, but teabagging pisses me off if you‚Äôre only teabagging to point out how bad I‚Äôm doing). Jane died and then starts messaging me salty rage rants. After probably thirty messages from him, I finally block him, but he told me he was posting my information on his Facebook account.  
---
And he did post all my identification information on his Facebook account. It was easy enough to find since he used his real name and gamertag on his twitch account. I reported it to Facebook, but who knows what will happen. Legitimately one of the most toxic player bases of any game. 
---
TIER 3 BBQ WAS ALWAYS 40 METERS, THEY BUFFED TGE FIRST TWO TIERS TO 40 FOR CONSISTENCY, THERE EAS NO NERF
---
lmao that's hilarious
---
It was fun until it lasted (and only on a bunch of maps actually)
---
Maybe make it so that once everyone is dead the final survivor had to finish a single gem for the hatch to actually open, or make it so the first chest they search is definitely going to have a kill but atm that final survivor doesn‚Äôt deserve to escape as if only two gens were done and their entire team died while they did those two gens they also played like shit as they let their entire team die?
---
If there is one male survivor that is known for carrying decisive strike, then it's adam
---
Thanks for the response. I'm only rank 14 ATM with a high of 12 a few seasons ago so I shouldn't have to many problems with that. I play on console: are you aware if that makes a difference to how she plays?
---
my back hurts
---
hm true the one gen thing makes sense, maybe each time a gen is done if its closed it‚Äôll reopen? idk
---
here a new solo survivor buff when your hooked  a new effect is added to kindred
---
THIS PATCH IS A JOKE. EVERYTHING IS BUGGY, THE NEW RANKING SYSTEM IS SHIT AND INCONSISTENT, DO THE DEVS KNOW WTF THEYRE DOING? I CAN'T EVEN USE BORROWED TIME OR WE'RE GONNA LIVE FOREVER BECAUSE THEY'RE BUGGED SO I CAN'T EVEN FARM BP ON SURVIVOR AND THE WAITING QUEUE IS TRASH FOR KILLER.
---
Do you expect the last survivor to do the last 3 gens? Or just use whispers to find the last survivor faster before they can get to the hatch but there is nothing else the last survivor can do besides looking for the hatch.. 
---
I believe they are for Ranks 1-5.
---
Yes the nurse was build to teleport trough walls and objects. That includes the exit door
---
What does PiP mean? I‚Äôm new
---
There‚Äôs a discord?
---
Exactly or maybe even make it so that when everyone is dead if two gens are done and another is finished the exit gates automatically power, that‚Äôs much fairer on the killer and they can actually counter a survivor going for the hatch 
---
somehow i'm actually happy he doesn't know the difference.
---
That happened to me as well, I noticed it once or twice last patch, but this one has been constant with Spirits I've faced. And I already hate fighting the Spirit, she's the hardest killer for me to go against! :(
---
I think leatherface is worse than Freddy without add-ons. That chainsaw literally does nothing. At least Freddy's ability slows the game down just a lil bit
---
You sound like somebody who slugs people so you can get the 4K. 
---
It‚Äôs not that serious. 
---
everybody forgets about Jeff
---
We should have a ridiculous ritual contest, just for laughs.  I'll start.

# RITE OF THE FORGETFUL
---
With the Wraith, immediately uncloak at the beginning of the trial.
---
PC only but we did get his Unbreakable perk! 
---
You bet your ass I do if I‚Äôm down to two people and two gens are done, I‚Äôm not giving ANYONE their free escape that‚Äôs bullshit and not earned
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Damn. That's going out of his way to be a prick. Hopefully Facebook will do something because that's legit harrassment. 
---
It's the same reason I (and a lot of others) use a Switch over another console or PC: convenience. 
---
Granted, I wouldn't pay more than 20 bucks for it unless it had a lot of its DLC, but that "Play wherever you want" experience is really hard to beat. 
---
Enter the Gungeon, Doom, Hollow Knight and tons of indies never caught my attention on PC, simply cause I had much larger or more multiplayer focused games to play. But cause of the Switch's nature, I gave them a chance and found them to be amazing games. I'm betting that's what gonna happen here too.
---
Here's hoping they make the game work well enough tho.
---
Holy shit sweat less. 
---
You‚Äôre a lunatic. 
---
WHAT FUCK DOES PIP MEAN
---
AND ANY ITHER ABBREVIATIONS WHILE WE ARE HERE?
---
Would a killer with a gun be out of the question though?
---
Like im talking some old European coloniser with a flintlock who was mislead by greed and fortune and now is cursed by the entity to hunt survivors.
---
Follow-up: I have found and fixed the the stun power charge issue. Waiting for some info about the sound issue.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm competitive and I enjoy winning. 
---
But there‚Äôs a difference between winning and trying to feed your ego. 
---
This dude is something else. Probably a troll based on his name. 
---
probably runs noed on ALL killers just for the ‚Äúgen rush‚Äù
---
Bill is exclusive to PC because Valve has had interactions with Microsoft. IIRC They wanted to have free updates back on the 360 and ms wanted to charge for them.

It hurts my heart to read this comment. It‚Äôs not THAT BAD lol.

BBQ AT 40 IS A BUFF. BBQ ALLOWS YOU TO SEE OUTSIDE THE RADIUS. BBQ AT 56 METERS WAS ONLY MORE USEFUL THAN TIER 1WHISPERS BC OF THE BLOODPOINTS.
---
Ah my two favorites things put into one quality meme. Nice. 
---
Hex: Ruin, BBQ&amp;Chili, Sloppy butcher ( depending on killer )
---
You know, this shit annoys me. Instead of people admitting that they're not that good and need to improve, they blame the game. 
---
"Oh, the old, easy pip system makes it impossible for me to make it out of white ranks, even though other people make it back to rank 1 in less than a day". 
---
If you can't get out of white ranks, then I'm sorry, but it's you. There's not much else to say. It's not that hard to pip at white ranks. It'll be harder now, bit pip thresholds change with each tier of ranks, so it still isn't that hard.
---
Maybe if you worked on improving your gameplay instead of blaming a system that was previously piss easy to rank up in, you wouldn't be in white ranks. Take some responsibility. 
---
Maybe its hector
---
They specifically redesigned DS so that survivors couldnt be juggled anymore.
---
Balanced landing, Adrenaline, and either Bond or Iron Will as the third.
---
See your rank? The one that goes from 20 to 1? 
---
Well, you need certain amount of pips (5, i think) to go from rank 20 to 19, as an example. You gain those pips in matches, by doing certain actions like repairing, helping teammates, etc. And piping means gaining a pip, of course.
---
Lmfao explain to me how I'm gonna rank up when i cant get sacrifices or enough hooks because of a dumbass arbitrary number that BHVR thought would work
---
I think you misunderstood what I was saying, cause we're on the same page
---
I‚Äôll also slug for a 4k and I don‚Äôt mind if a survivor escapes from the hatch at all. It‚Äôs a fair mechanic and OP is just whining. 
---
Literally and figuratively
---
And no awkward purple beard
---
Played it with my 8 year old last night. This and Mario Chase are my favorite. 
---
I HAD THIS HAPPEN TO ME 2 TIMES LAST NIGHT, I HAD TO DC BECAUSE I COULDN‚ÄôT HARDLY RUN OR DO GENS IT KEPT STOPPING ME, SOUTH EASTERN USA
---
My problem is, on top of what OP said, with this new ranking system, if you get 4 survivors and a killer who all want to rank up, the game doesn't play out "naturally".
---
 If the killer is more skilled than the survivors, the killer has to slow down or they'll risk a safety pip or even a depip. Likewise, if the survivors are more skilled than the killer, they'll have to force chases/hits/hooks on the killer. Even if the match was very evenly balanced, there's not enough points to go around for everyone.
---
I don't personally care about ranks but i'd hate to derank (or get stuck with blackpips) and ruin some player's game because i have way more experience in the game. I can already see it happening after playing less DBD = not climbing ranks so quickly = facing less-experienced players which is unchallenging, boring and must be unfun for the killer/survivors i face too. Slap on the new ranking system and i'll be hovering around with less experienced players for a while because i need my teammates/opponent to be good (but not too good) at the game to pip.
---
To be fair why would I ever want to make the entity pleased when he's the fuckin' reason I'm here in the first place, I'd assume most would just try to spite him.
---
LeGiOn BaD! dOwNvOtEd! &gt;:[
---
I definitely agree that dc'ing now can fuck you. I'm not saying the new system is perfect; I'm just saying that it more aptly segregates the population by difficulty. If I or anyone else can do it, you can pip at red ranks too. We all play the same game, have the same theoretical skill ceiling, and follow the same rules. You can do it. Maybe you need to change things up or watch back your games. I do, and it helped me improve. And while sometimes you really do just kinda get screwed, that isn't the norm. 
---
Hahaha I love this dude
---
I envision it as; when 4/4 survivors on the enemy team run decisive (pre-nerf obviously), the killer gets pissed off and no-ed glocks the whole SWF group down, also if the survivor teabags the killer automatically snaps onto them like an aimbot. 
---
Would be a funny and cruel perk, I'd love them to stealth patch the perk in for kill your friends on April fools or something (unrealistic as fuck I know).
---
Ruin is a scam and I dropped the perk back in June. It does nothing to slow down 90% of games and most survivors worth a damn know how to do a skillcheck. The other problem too is totems always spawn in the same area. There was research done on this about 3 or 4 months back and if you run a single totem, it will spawn guaranteed in a certain spot of a map.  (IE: Suffocation Pit it'll spawn right by the main building, usually by the back wall. Thompson House will be by the main house (Opposite corner diagonal to killer shack) etcetc).
---
I'm pretty sure this spawning logic hasn't changed, it seems to hold up whenever I survive at least but I also didn't memorize all the maps yet for these spawns.
---
This has happened to me too!
---
6 games as a killer.
---
4 kills everygame.
---
some games not even 1 gen was done.
---
I am still depiping and im back at rank 6.
---
I dont understand this game anymore and I think I will pass.
---
So to pip as a killer now, I have to kill 8 survivors per game?
---
Or should I be joining survivors in doing generators?
---
Jesus christ BHVR.
---
why get so upset if a someone escapes? just move on to the next game, it doesnt matter in the long run if you kill em or if they escape anyway
---
You fuck with the doc, you get the Glock(tor) 
---
balanced landing, bond and iron will
---
Yeah it does
---
OHHH WELL STILL IT'S NOT MUCH OF A BUFF IT REALLY JUST DEVALUES HAVING THE HIGHER TIER PERKS. THEY DID THE SAME THING TO RUIN AND I DON'T LIKE IT. RAGEEEEEE!!!!!!!
---
That seems rather subjective since a lot of the time I see people complain about gen rushing and now part of the game is actually how long the killer can delay survivors from doing gens. One of the best perks in the game heck probably 2 of them now are ones that delay the games length and directly contribute to the killers ability to rank up. 
---
The way you phrase it, doesn‚Äôt make you sound like you slug in every scenario, or even wait the full duration of the four minutes, assuming they don‚Äôt get healed. 
---
Hatch is fair unless they genuinely don‚Äôt deserve it. Only way I see that case is if they get under X amount of points or if a survivor gets caught and (old) d strikes out. 
---
I‚Äôd much rather lose a survivor than be bored leaving people on the ground. 
---
Anybody who seriously cares about the hatch standoff or tries to ‚Äúwin‚Äù it needs help. 
---
People just take escapes too seriously. It‚Äôs not like they ‚Äúbeat‚Äù you because they escaped. 
---
I‚Äôd prefer if it was called The Thing instead of The Alien because of the possibility of a Xenomorph becoming a killer in the future and the confusion that it could cause. 
---
WHY IS THERE NO DOUBLE BP EVENT???
---
Same happened to me
---
HOW DARE YOU TELL ME HOW TO POST I WILL PP YOU WITH MY PP
---
OK FAIR ENOUGH YOU HAVE MADE A GOOD POINT THIS IS BETTER
---
This but as a survivor vs legion.
---
Ok thanks
---
Thanks man
---
When you escape the trial, everything resets. That's why when you die, you end up back in the trial. There is no escape, it is an endless loop. I imagine the trap would just disappear because it is part of the trial and thus stays in the trial.
---
Not the Jane Mains, we just wanna share the **t h i c c** girl with the world.
---
Its just always something in this game lol.
---
Lol true. Maybe some type of limit/timer could be put on it?
---
Solo survivor is trash right now so i enjoy killer more cuz i dont need to go against through all bullshit killer have (anal beads, 5 blink nurse, exhaustion clown, frank mixtape moonlwaking legion, iri head huntress etc).  Im playing mostly for BP so my mindset is 4 BBQ stacks = win.
---
It doesn't happen all the time, but it does happen for unknown reasons
---
At rank 20-17? Give me a break. Listen to how you sound. 
---
The old black pip was 6, and +1 was 9, and 3/4 categories were easier. If you can't get out of white at that system, I hate to say it, but you're doing something wrong. For fuck's sake, you didn't have to kill a single person on Legion to pip. 
---
Stop blaming your issues on the game, and maybe you'll improve. Until you do that, you'll be stuck at white forever. 
---
When you're a P3 Claudette main, but get a Feng daily.
---
THE WHOLE PIPPING SYSTEM CHANGED YESTERDAY!
---
To be able to use it when the killer doesn't leave you slugged for a long period of time?
---
To be really honest.. I think Unbreakable should be removed as a perk and made into an inherent ability survivors have. Slugging is one of the most terrible experiences a player can have in this game, so it should be stopped this way. That would be my solution anyway.
---
I don't need to improve, I am literally playing, by BHVRs metrics, killing to fast. I'd rather end the game when the game ends naturally, rather than try to elongate games by letting survivors get unhooked.
---
I JUST WANT TO DO THE ACHIEVEMENTS TOG ET TO 100% COMPLETION BUT THEY'RE FUCKING BROKEN AND WON'T WORK WHY BHVR PLS FIX
---
Most slugging killers already do this though.. they slug everyone and just sit around doing nothing until they bleed out.
---
Sorry I'm not native so sometimes the meanings slip away from me. By mods enforcing the rule off of protocol you mean they were too harsh considering the admin rules of DbD Discord? 
---
Did you not read what I originally said? I didn't play for 3 rank resets. I was in greens for both Killer and survivor before I stopped playing. Pay attention.
---
lol it is certified tho 
---
Meanwhile I just double pipped despite a guy DCing on me to prevent me from getting all 9 hooks. Low rank life be like that.
---
Oh well that explains the downvotes i thought everyone was just being a bitch cuz they suck lol. Havent played the last 2 days so i didnt know about any system changes.
---
THE GAME KEEPS FREEZING DURING LOADING AND NOW I HAVE TO WAIT 4 MINUTES BEFORE I CAN MAKE ANOTHER LOBBY BHVR PLZ
---
They probably don't care honestly... the players who were complaining about how terrible DS is are satisfied and will stop filling up every forum and sub with crying about it and that's what they wanted. The perk is useless now.
---
I read what you said and it's totally irrelevant. So you forgot how to play, and now you're blaming the game, instead of even getting back up to green. 
---
BHVR makes a lot of mistakes, but it's not the old ranking systems fault you were at rank 20-17, it's yours. Stop making excuses. 
---
Another bug that has happened to me twice is when I'm at a fountain to cleanse myself and mid cleanse I get downed, I'm stuck in the fountain and the killer can't pick me up.   I can recover and then move out when a teammate is coming. It's only advantageous for the survivor because you're not truly stuck.
---
Happened to me after I got sacrificed and spectated after the last person was hooked. I could see Wraiths bbq on a hot day ass in 3rd person. 
---
MATCHES ARE TOO FAST! BY THE TIME I FIND SOMEONE AND DOWN THEM, EVEN IF I GET LUCKY AND FIND THEM QUICKLY, 2 GENS HAVE ALREADY POPPED!
---
BHVR! ADDING PERKS THAT SLOW DOWN THE GAME ISN‚ÄôT HELPING! I HAVE TO SPEND 2 SLOTS ON RUIN AND CLAWS AND THIS GAME IS STILL AT A RIDICULOUS SPRINTING PACE! FUCKING DO SOMETJING!
---
Empathy, Third Seal and Lithe.
---
Truth is. The Game was rigged from the start.
---
Huntress is decont too, especially with all the "hallways" made by the headges. You can also throw over common loops like the picnic tables and swing sets.
---
All they have to do is make enduring not effect it and it'll be a tad better. Still kinda useless. Or I think once you've been downed after being unhooked it should just remain active untill picked up. 
---
i need all of these üòî
---
DbD copied Nintendo confirmed, and now they're porting their game onto Switch for even more money, smh
---
Civil criticism is always a good thing unless it's starting to become rude and forced, I had nothing against it to begin with.
---
But yeah it's getting out of hand with the way you participated in our talk so whatever value you think your opinion meant I still dislike the form that was used to express with. 
---
Who touched Sasha? *WHO TOUCHED MY SAW?*
---
Yes. They probably didn't expect to have a leak like this, so the rules were not written to handle it well.
---
Holy shit you're dumb. I'm at white ranks now because for three rank resets in a row I did not play and went to the next lowest rank tier. Now that Plague is out and I'm back to playing with the new pipping system, I can not get out of white ranks because BHVR thought it would be a good idea to require a random number of hooks and a shitty chase requirement. In the old pipping system, I was in green ranks. How do you turn that into me blaming the old ranking system for my being in white ranks now
---
And save as wallpaper, what we were all thinking it
---
No idea what the devs were thinking with this. Some are going to argue that it‚Äôs a counter, but they are completely missing the point. The DS rework is supposed to be a PUNISHMENT to the killer for tunneling. You are not supposed to be able to just easily counter a punishment, it‚Äôs makes zero sense. Between this and how the running clock is implemented that doesn‚Äôt stop on chase or dying state, it‚Äôs a complete swing and a miss on a what could‚Äôve been a good change for the game.
---
I feel that, I usually don't buy killer cosmetics aside from weapons because I never see them, despite how many good killer outfits there are.
---
Seems that they really want to make more perks viable at lower tiers, which I‚Äôm super happy for.
---
As long as they don't DC within the first minute or so of the match, a DC still counts towards the achievement.  Unless of course it's bugged, which wouldn't surprise me. 
---
how so? how does a survivor getting hatch effect you? it doesnt, might matter for your ego but again it doesnt matter grow up
---
Ok I see your point thank you for taking the effort to express it
---
THE KILLER CAN BE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE LOCKER AND HEAD ON STILL DOESNT FUCKING WORK
---
Sure thing, nice talking with you.
---
Technically he's a polygon.
---
Honestly, i think the best part is that we got a female Survivor that isn't a skeleton. Not to sound like "reeeee representation reeee", but i  just think its nice to have something different.
---
~~i love the ass tho~~
---
That's some high quality bait there, my man.  Let's see if someone will fall for it.
---
Least they are at the gates! Been times where both gates are open and no survivor in sight.  Sure they are crouched in a corner arguing who is going to take hatch...
---
That's what I wanted to do, but I didn't see Jane exported for SFM in the Workshop yet. D:
---
Coolest looking killers imo...  worst to play as and against imo. It's too bad
---
OMG THE PLAUGE I LOVE HER LIKE SHES FUN BUT SHE CAN BE SO EASILY COUNTERED! ALSO I ENDED UP HAVING LIKE ONE SURVIVOR HOOKED SO I WAS LIKE WELP GUESS I‚Äôll GUARD AND THEY GOT HER DOWN, I HIT HER AND NOTHING FUCKING HAPPENED. SHE EVEN GOT THE SPRINT BURST AND EVERYTHING. SO I PICK HER UP AGAIN, DECISIVE STRKES MY SICK ASS. CATCH HER AGAIN AND I GOT TWO DUMB ASS CLAUDETTES TEBAGGING ME THE WHOLE TIME AND BLOCKING THE FUCKING HOOK SO SHE GETS DOWN AND THEY ALL DO A FUN LITTLE GROUP TEA BAG AT THE EXIT. LIKE IM ONLY SLATY CAUSE YALL ARE DICKS. 
---
Same problem for me.
---
Rank 1 both. My survivor play style is aggressive though.
---
Lizzo in this sub? Things just keep getting better and better
---
I agree. I too question why the survivors like to toy with the killers at the exit gates. They already won the game, they don‚Äôt need to rub it in. But I guess different strokes for different folks. 
---
I do.  She's so cute in her schoolgirl outfit!
---
It feels like NOED to me. You don't know if the player has it but the threat is there that they might have it. You could maybe run tenacity with it so if you do get slugged you can still make an escape and get healed.
---
Lmfao ok we're done. You obviously don't know how to comprehend words. Stay in your bubble of ignorance
---
And give you extra 1k BPs per 10 seconds in downed state?!? 
---
Oh dear lord has the wait times increased. At first, I credited it to a new killer being out that everyone wants to get their paws on. Now, I‚Äôve come to the realization that the game is just more broke.  It‚Äôs like the more BHVR does, the more it breaks and the game slowly goes down hill. This patch is so broken. 
---
isnt that a 1911 not a glock?
---
Yes, just puking doesn't give you on hit effects, only if they get broken by being puked on.
---
t. finger-eating clown
---
Glad to know it's not just us either, how does this go unnoticed?
---
Right? I didn‚Äôt even want to mention the ranking system. Got to deal with each of these issues one at a time.
---
your best bet is to slug the second to last player and hunt for the last one. The hatch is very stupid but that's our best way around it right now
---
I actually agree on this one. The perk, while I don't use it myself, has become kind of useless
---
BTW, got a -1 peep.
---
That‚Äôs fucking incredible 
---
I just leave. People can mess around get blood warden pulled on you.
---
Where's my boom stick?
---
I've had it happen. 2 people left during the final 5-second countdown. I couldn't unready and nobody joined anymore. I just left.
---
1. I do see the potential issues with SWF, but at the same time, I think any shapeshifting ability would have this drawback. However, if you have any suggestions, let me know!
---
2. The icon of which player you're disguised as will be highlighted. I should probably add that.
---
3. I feel like players crouching and pointing at others would be exactly as intended, to increase paranoia and slow the game slightly. Plus, it would mean adding more keys for new interactions, which would be a pain for console users.
---
4. yeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Last night I played against a streamer with a full swf crew and I was having extreme difficulty tracking people.  I'm half deaf so I thought it was my fault.  Good to know I wan't imagining things.  And that glass popping noise is annoying af. 
---
2 simple changes to make the perk work as intended:
---
- No Enduring...the fact they don‚Äôt realize a popular killer perk shouldn‚Äôt totally negate a punishment is mind blowing 
---
- Clock stops in chase or dying state. The clock could be shortened as I don‚Äôt feel 60 sec is fair if it stops in chase
---
Read the patch notes
---
Rank 4, that exact thing happened.
---
Honestly, at first, I was like, ‚Äúhuh, that ain‚Äôt right‚Äù. Then is was, ‚Äúthis too‚Äù, which led to ‚Äúare you fucking serious?!‚Äù  Each game, I‚Äôm noticing more and more fucked up shit. Hell, last game, a Dwight just appeared out of nowhere. Literally, *poof*. Right in the middle of the open. 
---
As long as you don't buy it from the bloodweb you should be fine
---
LOOKING AT THE WIKI APPARENTLY THE PERK STILL HAS THE INCREASED CHANCE OF BEING THE OBSESSION PART BUT THE REST HAS BEEN UPDATED. MAYBE THIS IS INACCURATE, MAYBE NOT
---
\*Plague Noises\*
---
Get out.
---
Dwight should be Kenneth. Good memes as always üëçüèº
---
Yea, i agree. I got called a face camper today because I camped a hook next to powered gates. 
---
I think there is some different definitions of tunneling. I think tunneling is just chasing down someone who just got off a hook for an easy down. I don't think downing someone from a chase is tunneling. There's a certain point in a chase where I have to down you because I can't have wasted all that time and not have someone on a hook.
---
Someone's poisoned the water hole!
---
How did they nerf it
---
You're fighting an uphill battle. This sub is less intellectually rigorous than flat earthers
---
Man, she's too young for you /shitpost
---
I mean, who wants to pip anyways?  There is no reason to rank up unless you want to play against the same 2 killers over and over.
---
It's fun the first time you work your way to rank 1 and then you just want to chill in green/purple.
---
Ah the Japanese movie poster.
---
10/10
---
Weaboo Myers. 
---
If I never had to see this disgustingly simple meme inexplicably hit the front page again it would be too soon.
---
Some of us like to play competitively but bc the ranking system is so bad it feels like im stuck with bad team mates aaalll the time. So ya, I play less these days. Tired of being matched with boosted noobs. 
---
What if he slugged u and camped u, or stayed near u 
---
Is that a gun from Fallout New Vegas? 
---
Yes, but Heavy != Fat.
---
She doesn't have more rolls than a pastry truck.
---
Ass, ass, ass and ass. Ass ass ass ass ass and ass. 
---
He‚Äôs such a cool guy, I bet he‚Äôd be really into it. 
---
I would love to see the haddonfield stat source, i would be blown away by what maps could possibly be more survivor sided even after they removed like 30% of the pallets.
---
The code of pipping is ridiculous and you shouldn't be forced to play a certain way just to face better killers and have better teammates. That's one of the worst parts about the ranking system. 
---
As a Feng main who has my moonwalks down, I'm a salty baby. I don't t-bag at pallets I moonwalk away, not to bm just to kinda flex I'm a good surv but also their fun. I don't think their toxic and as killer I think their funny, but I just get tunneled which I guess it's okay but yeah... I'm salty
---
Apparently it's the opposite of what they're doing, otherwise they wouldn't complain 
---
Auras are also barely readable. I'm prob about to take a break from this game
---
wasn't a pun. just a phrase. i can't hear anything this person said, it's a text. 
---
Give some examples please. Because as far as I'm concerned this game has gone straight downhill since the store was introduced. 
---
The dissimilar ranks is likely due to SWF, though.  They're out in force right now due to the new chapter.
---
Yes, politely ending a conversation in disagreement should be getting downvoted.
---
Reddit is a silly site for silly people.
---
R/youseeingthisshit
---
Adrenaline, BT, BL
---
I'm hoping that it's just because there's more people playing killer because of the new DLC. Hopefully it will level out in a week or so but it's pretty consistent 4 min queue times for me.

Look at her waist, it still curves into an hourglass shape.
---
She's heavier, she's bigger, but she's not fat.
---
YUP. WENT THROUGH 3 HORRIBLE SWF MATCHES BEFORE I RESORTED TO TUNNELING TO GET ADEPT PLAGUE.  
---
AFTER ALL THAT MOTHERFUCKING SUFFERING I DONT EVEN GET THE ACHIEVEMENT LMAO
---
No, that's the Pale Rose.  The one with the boat.
---
yeah, i still have yet to bind my emotes. i hope they are key presses in options and not some command console interface coding adventure
---
I've only been playing Jane, so I thought it only happened with her
---
Instadown in open areas lol 
---
It is? Damn I don't remember them being when I was there. Sucks.
---
You sure? I'm trying to get Adept Jane now and was going to test BT after. 
---
I ONLY WANTED TO VOMIT OVER YOU AND HOOK YOU AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. DO NOT TAUNT ME. AND DO NOT LOOK UP MY SKIRT WHEN I MORI YOU.
---
JK THOUGH. I DIDN'T MORI ANYONE.
---
Me, a color blind person who can't see scratch marks 99% of the time and knows they'll never add in an option to change their color because if you could make them fluorescent blue it's be too easy to see: I don't know did they?
---
Think he likes your waist.
---
What
---
Pretty sure you don't need to show resultant damage if someone puts or is planning on putting your copywritten material into their game without your permission, and I'm pretty sure you can argue that the leak would have boosted sales just because of the hype it would have generated.
---
For survivors: Kindred, Urban Evasion and probably Self-Care
---
For killers: Whispers, Ruin and Rancor
---
It goes both sides :) 
---
Let me throw in my expiriance. Yesterday I 4k'd three games in a row and didnt pip once. My 4th game was a 3k with a hatch escape and i depiped
---
What do you mean?
---
Self care, dead hard and iron will. Musts
---
Right?
---
The first time I fell in that hole scared the crap out of me. I definitely look forward to jumpscare-Myer-ing someone that way. But man, is that Temple quite the loop or what?
---
Looks kinda tacky?
---
Ah I love survivors bitching how "useless" new DS is..., some I see even ask that 60 seconds timer does not tick inside terror radius, while in chase or during downed state. Bitch you have 60 seconds to crawl away, get healed/run away  if killer is bad enough to look at you for those 60 seconds or be "close enough" there should be few generators POPING to punish him for that! If you are bad enough to get downed you should not have that crutch to guarantee chase reset like before. You fail you pay!
---
No way do they license a character for an april fool's joke
---
Jane isnt white.. 
---
That‚Äôs not so bad really. I have just avoided both. I added the people I thought were cool and I haven‚Äôt been back. However every now and then I get spam mentioned in the youtuber discord coz someone wants to play, they don‚Äôt get in trouble tho because they are a regular and I‚Äôm not. So I just start blocking. I‚Äôm only there for announcements really.
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the game itself or just how survivors are dealing with the new killer, but the gen rush is so real right now. Granted, that‚Äôs their objective, but it definitely seems more prominent than before. 
---
Its just annoying to do well and depip. Not to mention that by the end of this rank reset everybodys gonna be rank 8 max
---
LOL wow I was waiting for a post like this and it only took two days! She is mid tier at best or high with add-ons. Literally figure out how to bea her (her power is blocked by corners HARD)
---
I bet you blind on every pallet
---
don‚Äôt miss then, tier lists aren‚Äôt based off personal skill level 
---
wheres my kate ??
---
Yeah you can even join via the official game discords search
---
THE FUCKING PATCH THAT ONLY "FIXED ACHIEVEMENT" DIDN'T EVEN FIX IT HOW ARE BEHAVIOR SO INCOMPETENT 
---
yeah well, I dont care about pips, atleast like this its gonna be a challenge xD
---
I second this motion. 
---
Never trust a Feng, Fengs are the biggest trolls at heart. 
---
um
---
Thats gotta be so difficult, power to you. Have you tried bloodhound? That'd help a lot with tracking.
---
Well as unfair as this seems... it is realistic. If a killer finds you in a corner then you‚Äôre not just gonna be able to run through them and escape. Fortunately you‚Äôre able to phase through them against Myers* stalking and any other m1 killer in the game after they hit you 
---
umm
---
I don't mind the bugs as much, my locker bug was actually pretty funny. My dbd swf-buddy was hooked in the basement and I was literwlly next to him in a locker unable to save him. I ended up on the hook next to him and we died together. It could have been way worse and I'm having loads of fun with this new chapter
---
Please tell me you aren‚Äôt serious 
---
WHAT THE FUCK?
---
ITHINK_wedid_apretty_good_job_SOFAR
---
She has potential. I managed to get three people down in a short amount of time with the Corrupt Vomit last night. 
---
Same, there were two people left and after one was hooked and died, I could still see them but in the killer‚Äôs perspective, if that makes sense
---
Honestly my friends and I still use the term Terror Radius to describe the heartbeat in this game. It's so much fun though.
---
Some on salty as fuck maybe move to CiV 5?
---
You have a better idea? And yes it would be an hugely difficult skill check but I think it would work better 
---
I think it's fair as long as pallets/vaults no longer exist.
---
I don't care either way.  I'm pointing out that Bill's perks are universal survivor perks.
---
urban evasion
---
self care
---
sprint burst/dead hard (depending on what im feelin)
---
i wanna get rid of self care so badly but as a solo survivor it‚Äôs just not feasible and every time i try to take it out i end up regretting it
---
She‚Äôs not black, either. WOC aren‚Äôt interchangeable like that.
---
Give itto us in general, devs have already said in the past they would like to even the playing field for swf and solo survivors as much as they can without overdoing it. Just give a general counter, giving it to a perk is just the good old BHVR half-assed way of doing things, that is what i have a problem with.
---
Skill checks are to easy to hit 
---
Why do people still care about ranks and pips?
---
Deliverance exists, escaping the hook on a skill check might be the most unnecessary and dumb idea I've seen. 
---
Must be a joke
---
This one wouldn‚Äôt be. 
---
What the hell is even going? They seriously need to update this. There‚Äôs a game in their bug.
---
She can play well but survivors with BL and know how to run the houses will demolish her 110% walking ass.
---
I mean you had borrowed time you weren't in like any danger
---
The difference though is if the killer has Enduring, which so many killers run anyway, there is no threat from DS. 
---
Can‚Äôt suppress mentions. Only @everyone/here
---
It would have to be harder than ruin to actually be halfway good
---
My thoughts exactly 
---
This is better than my bug: having the wiggle meter the entire game and every second freezing for no reason.
---
You'd be surprised how many killers run a loop one direction and then reverse, most of reddit are not skilled played, and fall under this category! Np my apprentice, I can help you out with this any time! Most killers do not know when they will get hit by the pallet but also land a hit through the pallet vacuum etc, so many killers will try to get blood lust and not break a pallet. So yes, chase mechanics you ignorant fuck 
---
But... But thicc gurl.
---
Loop the puke and hide if she isnt using MaA
---
I got adept Jane last night on Ps4, didn‚Äôt take any items or offerings in, also escaped through the hatch, hope this helps! 
---
Anytime i run it i get crow free maps
---
lol, see my post, same thing happened to me earlier today
---
What I'm saying is
---
No, bad idea entirely
---
COULD THE PLAGUE BE ANYMORE OP??
---
Survivors are already OP. Skill checks aren't that difficult to hit. The only thing I can think of is that you get one chance only to unhook yourself and if you fail you instantly go into struggle, but that wouldn't be fun... I mean being able to unhook with a skill check is pretty much DS except you're hooked instead of being carried by the killer.
---
DAY 1 OF THE NEW DAMN KILLER AND ALL I‚ÄôM GETTING IS NOT A DAMN INCH OF FUN!
---
WAS THE POINT OF ME EVEN COMING BACK TO THIS GAME IF I CAN‚ÄôT PLAY THE NEW DAMN KILLER AND HAVE FUN KILLING
---
I've yet to even have it show up lol. Sounds wonderful 
---
I'd assume Latina or Hispanic 
---
Sometimes you need to learn to beat the system versus hoping that enough complaints will change the system to your preference. It's how a lot of things work unfortunately. We all default to complaining when it effects someone personally and requiring change. It's part of human nature and unfortunately is extremely coddled in some aspects within the last decade. Do I like the rework? So far yes, I just need to get more time in to see if it really my final answer. Other than that, it's another challenge I'm willing to face. I can't be a better player by always getting what I want. 
---
But it's your money and your time to figure out how you enjoy this game. I can't change the way you think, just give you you the tools and facts to reach your own conclusion. 
---
Damn, Dwight be looking charismatic and cool as fuck on that bottom pick.
---
I find it‚Äôs fine how it is, forces you to decide whether or not it‚Äôs worth trying 
---
Turning into a skill check would result in self unhooks becoming way too common, and survivors wouldn‚Äôt even need to stop working on gens to save each other at high ranks 
---
lmao this game is perfect
---
Please report them in-game and submit a manual ticket thru behavior's website and provide video evidence. They file it under unsportsmanlike conduct, under lagswitching. I've been doing this for a long time now and they've issued 16 temporary bans and 3 permanents to these scumbags. They follow a 24h -&gt; 48h -&gt; 1w -&gt; Permanent banning scale but each case is dealt individually.
---
Pretty sure you can phase through Meyers when he‚Äôs stalking 
---
I also wanna point out this happened to me twice yesterday, idk if redeeming it broke or what, but i redeemed the bloodpoints then when i came back to the game a few hours later it was back in my daily rituals, LOL
---
Someone pointed out that survivors can now hear a sound effect when The Spirit goes into phase mode, which basically ruins the whole mind game thing.
---
Thats pretty neat
---
That meme was funny for a whole 5 seconds. As the head developer for a game you should never tell your community to play something else
---
Link to original video/gif please for...... reasons
---
Thanks
---
No, slugging is an important part of killer strategy, it applies pressure and forces people off gens. Ideally, you aren't supposed to play dumb and let the killer get double or triple downs, because then you've just handed them the win.
---
Nice- opinions on viability at a high rank?
---
I'VE PLAYED FOR HOURS AND ONLY FOUND ONE LOBBY UNDER 100PING SINCE THE UPDATE. BEFORE THE UPDATE THIS WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND. PLAYING WITH A LOT MORE JAPANESE AND AMERICAN FOLKS INSTEAD OF JUST EUROPEANS NOW.. WHAT GIVES
---
I never said Dbd was educational I said that the jfk game was educational and rewarded you for repeating things exactly how they happen.
---
You said we knew nothing about his identity I only said the Dev's could change his identity as in looks because we dont know exactly what he dressed.  What he looked like. If he had mutton chops. Etc..
---
Again it wouldn't be off the record to add a killer who was into sexual things because we already have a killer who's touched kids, a killer who chops off fingers and licks them, they obviously wouldn't say the killer rapes his victims but subtle imply it like the writers did for FREDDY KRUEGER. 
---
Also the reason why I thought you were offended and bringing up the victims of the killings was because you're so defensive about it even though that want even a leg to stand on because I brought up another game baka the jfk game that is probably worse in scale but people didn't get upset about it. You claimed people would be if they added jack, people wouldn't.
---
The only reason whybi said he could beveducational is if the Dev's looked up and researched all available info on jack and informed us of what he did through his lore /perks.
---
So likevif he only stalked at night right maybe his ability would be something where he turns the maps sky dark almost like pitch black but enough to see so therefore he gains increased stealth and movement speed. 
---
So playing off of how he stalked his victims it would function into his kit.
---
But again I explained whybi thought you got offended it just came off as super defensive
---
Not complaining 
---
My friend was able to spectate the killer after he died when we were on swf :D (Only untill the person he was spectating got unhooked)
---
Nah my Adept Plague didn‚Äôt pop on PS4 last night.
---
Way too loud. It‚Äôs 100% covering up survivors grunting, etc. I‚Äôm an audio killer, and it‚Äôs messing with me. 
---
Oh! Something similar happened last night to me. I was playing swf with some friends. I died. I clicked spectate right when one of my friends got hooked and the camera had me spectating the killer until my friend got saved. 
---
adorable.
---
I deserve this
---
It has worked for me but sometimes it hasn‚Äôt when the killer has been right in front of me. So annoying
---
60 - 40 no? Not all perks need to be good ffs. Why do you think they added No Mither. Obviously I‚Äôm in the minority but the difference is DH and Lithe require a window or pallet to be useful. They also require skill unlike you buffed Head On. For this Head On you don‚Äôt have to worry too much about pallets anymore as killer‚Äôs can‚Äôt break Lockers. For example if your loop is gone and you know you can‚Äôt make it to a window just use your Locker and the killer has to take the stun. 
---
The absolute only reason I miss my Wii U.
---
I forgot about this :'(
---
Yes I agree, I would love to hear from the survivors perspective aswell. As posted the ones I had already asked seem to all agree on the chase music being too loud. Lets hope this discussion gets a bit bigger to get a nice pool of information.
---
The issue i saw alot in ptb is that you need to be in the locker a few seconds before it is allowed to trigger.
---
I guess. Maybe I‚Äôm being to hard on the drawing skills of the perk creators.
---
PEOPLE SAY IT'S TOO EASY TO RANK UP. BHVR FIXED THAT AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY LOSSES THEIR MIND! IMAGINE THAT!
---
I really like it and I really like that they added a new map to the Red Forest Realm. I understand why people would‚Äôve preferred a new Realm overall but I like that they‚Äôre expanding in the existing lore and universe. It feels more like the Entity is adapting memories into its world rather than just taking places into it
---
Exactly, the deadites aren't very special on their own and having Ruby as a killer, for example, would be kinda lame.
---
Or you ran to the locker and the scratch marks dead end in front of it. 
---

IMAGINE
---
Just infinite-loop her
---
MaA, nurses, sloppy b, ruin. Main hag there
---
There aren‚Äôt many bad experiences survivors can go through in general, so obviously ‚Äúit‚Äôs one of the worst‚Äù as there are only 5 bad experiences (camped, facecamped, tunneled, slugged, bodyblocked)
---
Anyway, it‚Äôs not a good idea because slugging is a strategy to slow the game down, and there are enough counters to it as it is.
---
This happened to me as well when i was dead and went into spectate. It was spectating the hooked person and it bugged out and showed this as well. It went away after that person was unhooked. 
---
I was thinking a timer once they leave! As the basement leaves a sort of terrifying mark on their mind even after exiting.
---
You were also funny for those 5 seconds 
---
Probably wasn't me, but I do use lockers more effectively now that I play Jane. The stun might not be great, but I can imagine it helping when unhooked in the basement with the killer nearby coming right back. Those 3 seconds go pretty fast.
---
Well whoever made this has the best cosmetic choice ever.
---
The perk ONLY works for 3 seconds after you get in a locker. 
---
IMAGINE USING HEAD ON TO STUN THE KILLER AND THEN SB AWAY. I'D LOVE IT AS A SURVIVOR MAIN, BUT EVEN IN THIS CASE I HAVE TO CONSIDER THE KILLERS SIDE ON THIS!
---
someone with a giantess fetish is *really* going to like this post

&gt;implying that rank matters

This video is irrelevant with the tbag

I thought the t-bag enhances it!

Ugh when will people stop thinking that this glitch is funny? 
---
What if it was 4 tiny skill checks?
---
Rip. Best luck ever getting Game with Doc.
---
Good for you
---
Ahhh, rupail
---
It's real, but the loop is referencing a crochet'd Ash. 
---
Have it been nerfed? Really?
---
vaccines cause autism
---
This is my opinion but Freddy is way better than leatherface and nurse but maybe that‚Äôs because I play him more than them.
---
Agreed, but the better you get at survivor, the better you get at killer 
---
REALLY NOT ENJOYING THE GENERAL GAMEPLAY LOOP VS THE PLAGUE + EVERY TIME I GET LONG RANGE HIT BY HER VOMIT IT FEELS SO CHEAP.
---
AND DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE RANKING CHANGES.
---
leatherface was released in the same update that had a map grim pantry has nothing to do with leatherface
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
Red rank games are a nightmare to play because half the time the red rank killers camp and the other half is survivors who troll. I stopped trying to get past rank 13. Better players, more fun games, and quick loading times in ranks 20-13. There are some really decent players in the beige and yellow ranks but they don‚Äôt ascend because they know how shit the ranking system is and how it‚Äôs just getting worse.

Isn't that a 1911 in the Doc's hands?
---
I believe they are
---
I didn't take offense. I simply will not debate with people who resort to personal insults. In my experience, it never leads to worthwhile discussion. Have a nice evening.
---
Isn't that the one that hides the stain, yeah no that sucks.
---
It‚Äôs worked for me a couple times, but I find it doesn‚Äôt work more often than it does. Seems very buggy atm. 
---
So ironic. Unbreakable is broken
---
It‚Äôs hard to use because you have to be on the survivors ass to charge it up.
---
I need this Dwight picture where can I find it 
---
Yeah head on needs to be fixed right now it sucks. It already was gimicky and also the worst exhaustion perk, add to that 90% of the time it just doesnt work and its a worthless perk atm
---
I HAD 3 CLAUDETTES TEABAG/FLASHLIGHT AT ME AT THE EXIT GATES MY FIRST TIME PLAYING PLAGUE. ITS A DICK THING TO DO ANYWAY BUT ITS ESPECIALLY ANNOYING WHEN WE ARE ALL CLEARLY JUST TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY A BRAND NEW KILLER. GIVE US A BREAK FFS
---
Not sure
---
You will not be missed
---
Well I have no idea what they did?
---
Self-Care, Urban, Empathy. The first two are self-explanatory, and being able to see where the killer has struck someone else and where chases are happening makes it indispensable IMO.
---
Nintendoland was the shit. A shame that so few games truly utilized the gamepad like this one did. 
---
CANT COMPLAIN ABOUT DS BECAUSE IT WAS NERFED AND ONLY ACTIVATES IF YOU TUNN

This game shines on the multiplayer experience, but I love the Donkey Kong maze-like game
---
I'm pretty sure it's 16/20/24% for the different tiers
---
Yes I'll make proper use of this material, you all can go about your day.
---
Puke back in her face
---
I'm not stupid. We're talking about PC. 
---
It‚Äôs 16% at level one, 24% at level 3. 
---
it‚Äôs 16% at tier 1 .
---
24% at tier 3.
---
4‚Ä¢4=16
---
6‚Ä¢4=24
---
quick maths
---
its mostly because it can run so poorly. its been better after this patch, but in the past ive wanted to throw myself at the tv. tho it gets more shit than it really deserves imo 
---
I love the facecam on mario chase. always makes me laugh seeing people's faces when they're trying to juke you 
---
That's a really good point! And vice versa stands true. The only reason I was fairly decent at playing survivor against certain killers was because of what I had seen survivors do and what perks they run
---
FUCK FACECAMPING DOCTORS WHEN THERES ONLY ONE GEN DONE
---
Quick patch notes:
---
Thanatophobia had it's values decreased after testing in the PTB. Values decreased from 4/5/6% down to 3/3.5/4% for a new maximum of 12/14/16%.
---
That's why I'm asking.
---
Agreed, and I'm really hoping the dedicated server will improve the game even more.
---
Why did they nerf it, it was cool
---
Best thing is that I don‚Äôt need to play with you two fucking idiots or know you two in real life.
---
Its real but he is talking about time travel.
---
WHEN THE KILLER HAS FRANKLIN'S AND ANOTHER SURVIVOR PICKS UP YOUR ITEM AND USES IT.
---
Here's the patch notes, that's why I'm asking this:
---
Ah funny how you try to pass over the fact that people will and do get less than 2 or absolutely none
---
R.i.p me
---
As a survivor main, I too hate survivors
---
mmm boob physics
---
in most game its prestigious to achieve rank 1 , but in dbd everyone has reached rank 1 within 100 hours. So even after the patch people seems to not care at all about ranks and i get why. 
---
I really thought it was fake.....damn
---
Ah, m'kay. So pretty much just let the Entity consume the teachables on each Bloodweb.
---
Thank you for your time.
---
It should have gotten buffed
---
You only hear it if you aren‚Äôt in her terror radius.
---
It kinda sucks, this is my second season and I was in green ranks last season. I was hoping to quickly get back to green because there is less potatoes but the last two nights I have de-ranked twice due to depipping even though I escaped and did gens. Feels bad. I know I don't belong in purple or red ranks but I don't have friends and a lot of randoms lack common sense lately. 
---
I have no idea what you are even trying to say. ?????
---
That's intended
---
Rewards are desperately needed for the rank system. Something like 500k BP and 1k shards for hitting rank 1 or somethinng
---
Hail to the king, baby.
---
Umm I literally had 4k and didn't get it.. so not sure if thats the case.
---
Still don‚Äôt see it. 
---
Can you elaborate more on why you disagree instead of just saying "I disagree?" Not much of a discussion to be had here.
---
Either that or just a totem counter added to the HUD.  Really, the solution is so simple, its a wonder why it hasn't been implemented alongside the obsession chase marks they did for everyone.
---
Literally, like omg guys, the hatch is so unfair I deserve muh 4k
---
I think it‚Äôs something to do with the nose dive the graphics took to buff the frame rate. I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed it but I run bond and it‚Äôs become difficult to find people‚Äôs aura‚Äôs when they‚Äôre on the opposite end of a large map much less figure out what they‚Äôre doing. 
---
I actually like the new Pip system. Finally Im not Rank 1 all the time.
---
Gonna assume that the notes probably are correct and they just forgot to update the tooltip because PGJSF
---
THE WORST POSSIBLE PERK TO BE BROKEN IS BROKEN!!
---
THEY NERFED MY GIRL SPIRIT AND I CAN'T  M I N D G A M E  ANYMORE!
---
Same here, and I somehow heard the sound with my speaker muted.
---
I WAIT FOR 5 MINUTES TO ENTER A MATCH LOBBY JUST TO GET A RED CONNECTION EVERY TIME RREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
According to the patch notes, they changed the "material" the scratch marks are made of, which was supposed to make them more visible in Mount Ormond. Apparently it worked for the other maps as well.
---
yah defiently, im going to actually just make a video response about why, i think they may have missed what they were aiming for with this recent patch in spite pf some good things happening.

now that i've seen this in action, definitely in favour of that proposed change of DS no longer being affected by Enduring now that it's base level stun and doesn't activate nearly as often
---
This update is BUGGY af
---
I do seem to be repairing gens faster now and I can't tell if I'm crazy or not
---
That's fucking disgusting.
---
LUL
---
literally this is my first time seeing this glitch lol, sorry?
---
Thank you for this post. I had an argument about this just today and i agree with you!
---
Well, I do know how to loop, 360, and efficiently run tiles. I belong somewhere near rank 1, and have been there for about a year and a half. Can't get there anymore because past rank 8 it's impossible to pip anymore. When high rank players start dropping down to rank 10 I'm sure you'll change your tune. 
---
Dude anything freaking guarantees you won‚Äôt pip. You have to the PERFECT game to get 1 pip. The new ranking system is a bit to challenging imo
---
Love new ranked. No more garbage teamates and facecampers at red ranks. Now there‚Äôs actually a reason to not derank 
---
This is hilarious 
---
Kate is hotter than Meg..just saying. 
---
GUESS I'M SHIT OUT OF LUCK IF I WANT TO PLAY AGAINST PEOPLE AT THE SAME SKILL LEVEL AS ME. IT ISN'T FUN PLAYING AGAINST A RANK 4 WHO KNOWS WHERE EVERY PALLET IS.
---
I CANT HEAR WHAT YOU WROTE!
---
I SEE YOU REPLYING TO YOUR OWN COMMENT TO GIVE YOURSELF VALIDATION. DON'T THINK I'M NOT ON TO YOUR LITTLE TRICKS.
---
Good God that is GLORIOUS.
---
53% is an average. Meaning of the literal thousands of games played theres are hundreds on those maps where people eont get a single kill at all. 53% is a terrible stat on both ends but it shows the game is balanced to an extent. That is what I'm saying 
---
Okay but it isn‚Äôt as bad as you make it seem. It‚Äôs not impossible to pip up with the new system, it just isn‚Äôt as easy as it was before. Rank never meant anything before because everyone could get rank 1 if they played enough. I experienced this as I got rank 1 on my second month playing, and I have also witnessed many of my friends easily hit rank 1 soon after they began playing. Maybe with the new system rank could have some actual leverage. 
---
That‚Äôs delicious. 
---
Spot the difference between the following: 
---
survior
---
survivor
---
i still think this is a hoax
---
Well I'm uh pretty sure I found a pretty broken bug but dont really wanna mention it in case it can be replicated 
---
"This new ds isnt a nerf, it's just a change for the better"
---
YOU REALISE BASICALLY EVERYTHING SPIES ON YOU, ITS NOTHING NEW. 
---
WhY yOu TuNnElLiNnGgGg ThO?
---
I just had a match where I turned on 2 gens by myself, escaped the killer after getting hooked once, got 1 person off of the hook and escaped the match. I didn't get any pips at all. What the heck.
---
Strong against m1 killers maybe.
---
It's hard to get chased when you live in the lockers
---
As much as I'd like to agree that this isn't a competitive game and that rank doesn't matter, I believe in general that this is pretty much impossible for a good chunk of people, myself included, as long as rank is part of the visual feedback loop of playing, so inbuilt as it is now. Whilst I firmly believe a stricter ranking system is good for the game in terms of better matchmaking, do you agree that there should be an option to hide player ranks to encourage a more casual and less competitive bias in the playerbase?
---
DOIN' GENS, YOU?
---
yay killer bullshit reigns again
---
Yeah if you know how survivors move and think it makes your life a lot easier. Loops can still be painful but you have a better chance, especially if you are good at faking with your red stain
---
If the game is meant to have people drag the game out for longer and show their skill in chases and avoiding the killer, this flips the entire tier list of killers, nurse would be bad since she can end the game so quickly. I am surprised to say this but this makes legion kinda good since he can end chases quickly, however he really isn‚Äôt fun to play against. 
---
I will make the point that judging a killer without taking into consideration their addons is a bit weird, it is part of their kit and you usually will always have some addons to play with. Overall, I think BHVR wants us to play the game differently than any other game we have ever played, not to win, but specifically to embody the characters and have fun playing with our food or outskill the big bad killer. Puts a whole new light on the game.
---
People see curves and think fat but her legs, arms, and torso look pretty toned to me. It's more than likely muscle that makes her bigger I mean she was a tv star so I'm sure she would've had an exercise routine. 
---
No idea. I tried to vault the pallet right after this clip but as I went, the last gen was repaired and the killer had no one escapes death...so I was downed 
---
ALL ONLINE GAMES REALLY NEED NAT2, ANY OTHER AND IT CAN BE FUNKY AND NOT LET YOU PLAY.
---
i realise that it will never die down completely, it's just like...do we really need five threads on the first two pages of the subreddit about it? :( i know, i know, "downvote and move on," i'm just a little tilted about it.
---
But I want him to voice act the screams and grunts in game for his own character too
---
"Dont leave a comment unless they agree with me". This is always a good opinion.

---
IT DOESNT DEVALUE IT. IT MAKES THE TIER ONE VERSIONS HAVE A POINT. I HAVE EVERY TEACHABLE UNLOCKED AND SOMETIMES ON A NEW KILLER I ONLY GET TIER ONE OF BBQ OR RUIN. AT LEAST NOW THEY'RE NOT COMPLETELY FUCKING WORTHLESS.
---
Well THAT explains it.
---
Last night I was spectating a buddy, switched to the hooked survivor and the camera was on the killer.
---
So we know who the new survivor is gonna be, but do we also know who the new killer is?
---
I've depipped twice in games where I 4K'd so I disagree.
---
well played freddy is enjoyable for the killer imo
---
It does
---
Sorry, I play video games to have fun.
---
This is the most unnecessarily high quality decorated DBD thing I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
I love it.
---
I've seen some weird bugs that came with patches, but this is the most broken patch I've experienced so far
---
Same thing happened to me. I also experienced a glitch where I could see from the killer‚Äôs perspective when I spectated. 
---
Right on the mark. Only reason it was upvotes is because ‚ÄúDAE survivors toxic? Xd‚Äù
---
CAN'T GET A GAME NOW BELOW 300 PING.   MIGHT AS WELL NOT PLAY UNTIL THEY FIX THE FUCKING MATCHMAKING SYSTEM.
---
The only problem with saying that killers that can end the game quickly are lower on the tier list is pretty obvious, though: with stronger killers, you have more control over the game because, well, if you won so hard with Nurse or Billy, you can just opt to pick up those survivors instead of slugging or, just, generally give them a chance so you have more time to 'play with your food' as it were. The speed at which they end the chase doesn't matter. 
---
You do realize Nurse, the best killer in the game as well as Spirit, Freddy, Wraith, Probably pig, Clown, Trapper, Doctor, Hag, Myers and Huntress all have no way to counter this right?
---
I don't like Monitor on her because of the early warning and the terror radius jumping from 16 to 32 and the normal fov during chase. I will often see survivors in the corners of the screen with Shadowborn. Being able to cover a consistent 24m of radius is much better.
---
I also know how to tip my terror radius just slighty into a gen so I can basically get gen grabs like prayer beads without actually using them. Survivors likely won't hear the faint heartbeat with the gen noises. 
---

---
And the best thing is tbagging a camping tunnelling killer because you dared loop them for too long
---
Nurse is not enjoyable for anyone?
---
I want this, anyone in Washington Tacoma/Seattle wanna get paid to make me a case like this?
---
Damn. My brain is so big and smart that I filled in this foolish error with the proper spelling. Man I‚Äôm clearly a genius and there is no other answer.
---
No, not all memes are simple ones; if you meant the best ones are simple, you're wrong about that too. The best memes are clever (which is something that's not the same as simple, it takes a lot of thought and sometimes work to make something clever, and sometimes it just goes together really nicely, even if it seems simple in its execution, good ones, usually aren't), this is stupid. The originating meme was a clever two-panel joke: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/eat-my-ass-spirits , this is a one panel with no fucking joke just a popular K-Pop kid and a simple overlay change to make it relevant. It can be altered slightly to make it "don't poison my ass, Clown" etc. but none of that is clever. Drawing a comparison to the fact that he's green and looks like a survivor that's going to puke and saying "when Cowboy Jake pukes so much he loses his beard" is clever. This, "hot take," isn't. And the fact that a lot of these lame memes "take the cake" when a lot of actually clever ones don't is why this sub sucks.
---

‚ÄúItS bAlAncEd tRust Me‚Äù
---
I was running away from him :&lt; Wasn't even too crazy wth looping, he did some really bad plays :/
---
Honestly this is my exact problem with it. The times that I‚Äôve popped since the new rank system, it‚Äôs been because my teammates have been horrible, and I had to do all the work, and even then I BARELY pip (r1, so 13 points needed to pip). 
---
Safety pipping in red ranks is easy enough. So long as you survive you‚Äôll most likely pip for sure (with the exception of one game where I played horribly but still survived, I‚Äôve safety pipped every game thus far, and pipped a few times)
---
I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs harder to pip, but they at least need to fix how we earn our emblems, because as of right now, for anyone in red ranks at least, you have to hope you‚Äôre the only competent survivor of you want to pip.
---
oh no! i use bbq all the frggin time
---
Decisive is still good, are you high?
---
Nah, it's just unpleasant. I never t-bag, even if the killer was being a foul sport.
---
Decisive Strike it the garbage disposal with Boil Over and Slippery Meat.
---
Or
---
They should remove the enduring effect and stopping the timer if you down the survivor.
---
I saw this in a game last night. I was like well that perk is useless now. All the person had to do was run like 50 feet to the hatch and they couldnt even get there before the killer catching up.
---
This perk is ridiculously strong
---
Meg be like: "Wait. That's ilegal."
---
They've changed some dailies from minutes to seconds (same duration, 3 min = 180 seconds and so on) in order to be easier to know if we're closer to finish it, but some of them were left like this. 
---
And even then, only if you heal between hooks.
---
To be fair, getting burnt out on a game is a thing. That‚Äôs what he was trying to say. But the delivery was awful.
---
The Dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities one may consider... unnatural.
---
i think if you're in the locker long enough to get birdies, it no longer activates? i figured the point is when the killer comes looking for an afk survivor in that locker, you stun them.
---
Who's the first one in A-tier, Billy?
---
When you say hide ranks, do you mean just visually hide the number? If so, I don't see how that accomplishes much assuming matchmaking works correctly. You should always be matched with people of similar rank, so you'd already know they are similar rank to you.
---
That being said, as of a few days ago, matchmaking is completely fucked.
---
Technically that's wrong since if you are really that concerned about the perk you can pull a survivor off a vault. It sounds like a solid perk but not an op perk. Also landing in a trapper trap would counter this so he shouldn't even be on this list
---
Huntress' hatchets are the power and Trapper's trap too.
---
Ridiculous..
---
And its in 3rd person the way it should be
---
"they fucked up" implies that it's directed towards BHVR.
---
&gt; nurse would be bad since she can end the game so quickly
---
The point is she *can*, not she *absolutely must*. She'd still be by and far the best killer in the game, who is in complete control of everything.
---
The trick is to not care and just play.
---
Yeah if you get targeted fresh off hook youll ignore one hit but your next hook will be your death anyway, so I'm not saying it's bar but it isn't has good as the post is making it sound
---
I don't see why you can't do this at tier 1
---
I only cared because I did not want to be in the high ranks because the higher I got the more stressful the game became.
---
I like that they tried to add a system where higher ranks would be more difficult to get to but this new system is absolutely insane.
---
The current system almost completely ignores skill and is just a measure of how much you did each game. The system is heavily dependent on how well the OTHER side performs during the game.
---
Let's say the killer is not very good and decides to chase you literally all game. The end result: no-one in that match will pip. The killer won't pip because he didn't get anyone, you won't pip because you didn't get a chance to do gens or save survivors. And most importantly, the other survivors won't pip either since they didn't get chased or get to save other survivors from hooks.
---
"Skill" shouldn't be determined by how much you did each game. It should be based on how well you did.
---
* If you carried your team and did all the gens, you deserve to rank up. 
---
* If you saved everyone multiple times without going down yourself, you deserve to rank up. 
---
* If you ran the killer around for the entire game while the others did gens, you deserve to rank up.
---
* If you escape you should at least get a safety pip.
---
* If you 4K you should at least get a pip or even a double pip depending on what happened during the match.
---
* A 2K as killer would be a 'balanced result' and can be considered as a win against a great team. So this should result in a pip unless you camped them.
---
The good thing about the previous patch was that you could get away with being really good at one thing because it would just barely be enough for a pip. Now it's not even close.
---
This is really a problem with the emblem system. Why does it cap points at 8k? This would equal to being chased for 2 gens and after that it doesn't matter anymore since you will get no points towards your rank anymore.
---
For these reasons, a lot of actually good players will be pushed back to green/purple ranks even though they can definitely handle red ranks.
---
Again, I would love a good ranking system where it's more difficult to rank up but it should be based on actual skill.
---
Survivor‚Äôs dc‚Äôing pretty much screws the other survivors from pipping to, especially early game dc‚Äôs. That 2 less hook saves and one less person to heal. 
---
No offense to OP, you have a lot of great work that I've happily upvoted before, I'm disappointed in continually seeing this frakking meme in this frakking format.
---
That's the thing I can understand if devs say its understandable to get burnt out and take breaks no worries we will still be here but to say go play civ 5 is terrible on his end, honestly feel after that the playerbase did go down a little 
---
Spirit isn‚Äôt enjoyable for survivors if she‚Äôs any good. Very little counterplay without iron will.
---
I... don't really have much to say other than I think you hit the nail pretty firmly on the head. The emblem system has always been intended to be the Entity rewarding evaluating you, not the eclectic concept of typical video game ranking systems.
---
I mean, take a look at the naming of the emblems. Lightbringer, Gatekeeper, Devout, etc.
---
As much as this game's lore has never really been that prevalent, I think the 'playing with your food' kinda deal fits very well. If you're so much better than the survivors, you absolutely can give them an extra chance here and there to get more favour with the Entity.
---
It should add the mending effect like borrowed time.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt know
---
That's a big yikes from me
---
Changing the ranking system is not how the devs should solve the 'genrush' problem and the stale killer meta that follows it. That is a fundamental balance problem with the core gameplay and should be solved by adding a mandatory secondary objective to slow down the game. Preferably near the end as that would stop the campfests and hatch standoffs that are oh so common then. 
---
Right now the devs are pleading for players to ignore how ez it can to pump out those gens... and for what? The Pips and ranks that come with no rewards?  No cosmetics, no shards, no blood points, no auric cells. We currently get nothing for ranking up. It's silly. 
---
I agree but you got those lame bitches who gonna riot if it did come back. üôÑüòÇ
---
Ok thx. It sounds interesting but yeah it doesnt actually look practical
---
K
---
that bitch said I AINT TAKING NO CHANCES ON THEM WALKING ANYWHERE!!
---
I only have one change and that is you should automatically black pip from a 4k; then the emblem results should be tacked onto that. The benefits are people no longer crying about not getting pips from 4ks, and slaughtering the opposing survivors (like in your scenario) would almost guarantee a 1 pip with a good chance at 2. 
---
haters will say the other way around
---
I do not think you understand what Average represents. Yes, sometimes people get 1 or so Kills. People also sometimes get 3 or 4 kills.
---
The fact that it is above 50% means that 3 and 4 Kills happen more often than 0 or 1 Kills
---
They‚Äôll nerf it into an usable state. 
---
You‚Äôll be exhausted and broken statused. I‚Äôm guaranteeing it. 
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not playing killer anymore. Used to be about a 50/50 split, but fuck that. There is now no reward whatsoever for playing killer. It‚Äôs just frustration upon frustration, after which you safety. No thanks.
---
THATS WHY ITS KILLING ME AS A FINNISH GUY LIVING IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST WITH INTERNET SHARED THROUGH MY FONE

IMAGINE IT BEING SO FUCKED NOW, I CAN MURDER ALL THE MEAT WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE AND EFFICIENCY AND LOSE A PIP FOR DOING MY JOB. SON OF A FUCK
---
Yeah that might be it actually, don‚Äôt have a problem using bond but will try empathy and aftercare and see if that‚Äôs affected. 
---
Dude it legit seemed like you just didn‚Äôt know how it worked. You probably didn‚Äôt and ur just making up for it now

This is a public post so anyone who agrees/disagrees with you have the right to commet.

Close enough the "power" description
---
FINALLY SOMEONE WITH A FUCKING BRAIN. 
---
IS IT A BUG, IDK. BUT I FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULDN'T BE THE OBSESSION AT ALL UNTIL YOU USE IT. THE WAY IT IS NOW MAKES IT SO THE KILLER KNOWS TO AVOID YOU WHICH, YOU KNOW, THE DS NERF (PART OF IT) WAS SUPPOSED TO AVOID.
---
Your experience with devour hope is the problem. If you end the match too quickly you won't get the amount of pips you deserve for beating the survivors so effectively. It's also too hard to pip for literally nothing (I mean, no reward for staying at rank 1? Really?
---
But... But muh ego.
---
WHY IS MY WAIT TIME 8 MINUTES?  ARE THEY RECODING THE MATCHMAKER WHILE I WAIT?
---
BUT I FEEL LIKE THE PERK MEANS NOBODY SHOULD BE OBSESSION AT ALL UNTIL THEY USE IT (OTHER PERKS NOTWITHSTANDING).
---
NOONE CAN CATCH A FUCKING BREAK.
---
yea
---
I FEEL LIKE THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED???

Free 30K! :D (Really hope it‚Äôs a typo though)

IM SO ANGRY THAT THIS THREAD IS SO LIT

Suing is going to a judge asking for compensation for a wrong that has harmed you. You don't successfully sue simply because people did something wrong. It's not criminal law. You're getting compensated.

We got PTB to find these bugs but somehow still fail. Hmm

Solo que gets me pumped to play killer. "YALL REALLY GUNNA LEAVE ME TO DIE ON FIRST HOOK AND STAY CROUCHED IN A CORNER HUH!" 
---
OH NO. MY MONSTROUS SHRINE IS THE BEST PERK IN THE GAME. I WILL BE RUINED IF IT IS NERFED.
---
Sneakier than a pink sweater Ace! Not as sneaky as the Dwight with Head On and Quick and Quiet, though.
---
Honestly I wouldn't mind it in this state it could just be annoying in the end game and just make NOED more of a necessity 
---
It's been worse since the update. In my first match as the new killer someone DC'd the first time they went into the broken status. My last two games were 3 and 2 man games after people DC'd when they saw what killer I was. It's insane.
---
Yeah I had invisible skill checks :l
---
PSA: BHVR does not run the discord. The fault lies 100% with the mods of the discord.
---
That's true. That's why I stopped playing survivor lol. Someone always sucks and DC's and I end up wanting 10 minutes just to safety pip.
---
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT SIR. I DO NOT AND WILL NEVER BELIEVE YOU HAVENT TRIED LEGION CHEESE AT LEAST ONCE, SIR.
---
I respect your opinion. I do believe that freddy can be better than some of the other killers in the right hands. Doctor too (I have seen bricky). But this is just overall and not any specific situations with players who main the character. I believe any killer has the potential to do great things. 
---
Leatherface has an instadown and the ability to break pallets faster. Yes if he hits an object it's pretty much a free escape for the survivor. But that is fairly easy to avoid no matter the skill of the player. The threat of a leatherface getting someone in the basement is insane and 80% of the times it's a one hook death.
---
Poor Legion :(
---
Ofc you need self care + exhaustion perk(dh for me). Then I am using adrenaline and iron will. Its my chaser build and it really defines my playstyle.
---
They should make it to where if you're in the gate area and killer near you lose bloodpoints. Just like how they nerf hook camping. 
---
&gt; Let's say the killer is not very good and decides to chase you literally all game. The end result: no-one in that match will pip. The killer won't pip because he didn't get anyone, you won't pip because you didn't get a chance to do gens or save survivors. And most importantly, the other survivors won't pip either since they didn't get chased or get to save other survivors from hooks.
---
That's definitely one of the counter-arguments. However, I submit that you can insert yourself into a chase if you are looking for boldness. If a baby killer is tunneling one dude the entire game you can literally just block his path and force him to hit you so you start getting chased. Others can heal you for altruism. I'm not saying this is necessarily how things should be and its pretty silly, but if you are against a killer that is so bad they are throwing the entire game to chase one person, you can still insert yourself in his face to get additional objectives. That being said, there really shouldn't be that many games in which the killer is led on a 5-gen chase.
---
&gt; "Skill" shouldn't be determined by how much you did each game. It should be based on how well you did.
---
I agree. The problem is, without a human being quantifying stats each match, it is pretty impossible in a game like this to accurately gauge the skill levels.
---
&gt; If you carried your team and did all the gens, you deserve to rank up.
---
Why? You held M1 for 5 minutes. You did nothing skillful. You didn't carry the game, the guy kiting the killer all game did.
---
&gt; If you saved everyone multiple times without going down yourself, you deserve to rank up.
---
I would find it very hard to believe that getting multiple unhooks / heals would result in you not pipping. Safe unhooks are huge.
---
&gt; If you ran the killer around for the entire game while the others did gens, you deserve to rank up.
---
This is something I do agree with. A type of system that detects if you were the focus of the killer the majority of the game, and then rewards you based on that, would be nice.
---
&gt; If you escape you should at least get a safety pip.
---
I think if you sit in a bush all game while your team dies and you get a hatch, you deserve nothing.
---
&gt; If you 4K you should at least get a pip or even a double pip depending on what happened during the match.
---
In most cases you do, until red ranks, where old double pips become single pips.
---
&gt; A 2K would be a 'balanced result' and can be considered as a win against a great team. So this should result in a pip unless you camped them.
---
You can absolutely pip with a 2k against a great team. Assuming the game was even throughout, both sides will actually most likely pip.
---
THAT'S WHAT OP WAS REFERRING TO IN THEIR LAST SENTENCE....
---
NOT ENJOYING THIS SHIT GAME ANYMORE, LATER!
---
SCREW THE MATCH, ME AND THIS HUNTRESS DECIDED TO FLY ACROSS THE MAP, BOTH OF US HAVE A TERRIBLE CASE OF PORTAL FEVER, AND THEN I WAS HOOKED. FUCK.
---
Yeah, it's a typo
---
Pretty funny still, although I've got no perks on jesus boi
---
What a screenshot
---
Talk about an echo chamber
---
Then that's no different than getting face camped. The gens just get rushed.
---
LET THE KILLERS SCREAM AT THE SKY "ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED???!!!"
---
Yep, just visually hide the number. It wouldn't mean much to the matchmaking or to the feeling of playing against players of equal rank, but I believe it would help people who *want* to play DBD like a casual game but find it difficult to because of the "competitive"-like ranking system that's impossible to ignore right in front of their faces. It's difficult to play DBD like a horror game, as was intended, when in the back of you're mind you're constantly worrying about pips. This is coming from someone with that exact view, mind you - I have difficulty just enjoying the game and taking my mind off rank when it's a good deal of the results post-game.

Survivor: haha i beat you haha tea bag tea bag gg ezzzzzz

Survivor: this is bullshit wall hacks cheater get reported enjoy your ban exploiter

I'd rather gouge my eyes out then play clown. Alternatively, I enjoy playing freddy even if i do bad
---
p h e w, i hope a fix comes out quickly though
---
This is the first one I wholeheartedly agree with.
---
Except a good freddy is pretty fun to play against 
---
It‚Äôs an interesting map but it definitely is more of a survivor map. It‚Äôs large which hurts low mobility killers, and there are a ton of very safe pallets around the temple that the killer has no choice but to run straight around unless you‚Äôre Spirit, Nurse, Hag, and maybe Huntress. Plague herself doesn‚Äôt seem to able to use corrupt purge over these loops due to the arc so the majority of killers are screwed by those. Further so, if survivors don‚Äôt do the temple gen, it is very difficult to catch survivors looping the temple windows, especially with BL. I guess this is all balanced out by that one shitty pallet right by the temple gen that should literally never be touched cause of how bad it is.
---
Looks like someone messed up a " in the code :') 
---
My gf was playing on the ps4 yesterday and had this issue with Kate, the survivor she was playing. It was absolutely terrifying to watch. I had no idea what she was for a solid few minutes until I realized the jean shorts weren't the body of some Lovecraftian tentacle monster.
---
SO PEOPLE WHO COUNTER IT SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COUNTER IT? NO. SMART PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT USELESS.
---
The strategy üëÜüèæ
---
What should happen is that you get there to hit them one last time for points. Like that's what it was meant to be when survivors stood at the door. But by now it's just douches wasting your time, yeah.
---
This happened to my last night when I was playing against The Pig. It seems like a lot of people are experiencing weird bugs since the update. 
---
blinding on pallets, what a hero play xD
---
I THOUGHT OP WAS SAYING THAT IN A WAY BECAUSE THEY HAD DESTROYED THE SWF SO THEY SAID HOWS THAT GOING FOR YOU NOW
---
I agree with the OP. 
---
I‚Äôve been playing a couple of survivor and killer games and so far it feels like stealth and gen rushing(for survivors) and slugging, camping and tunneling to get 4k (for killers) causes most of the depips in purple and ranks. 
---
Although I think it‚Äôs a little bit harsh and needs more tuning for the survivors side, I think they got it just right for the killers. It feels like it will encourage good practices for both sides in the long run.
---
And Decisive just gave you one free stun if you were down. What's the big deal?
---
Everything else with it is great but they need to make it so 1. The timer doesn‚Äôt run out while you‚Äôre in dying state 2. The stun is a little longer than 3 seconds so a killer with enduring can‚Äôt just eat it and pick you up 0.5 seconds later
---
I‚Äôm all for making the game harder to rank up, but they need to fix how we earn points then. For reference:
---
Let‚Äôs say my team does amazing, and no one, or very few people end up getting hooked. Welp, looks like we don‚Äôt get benevolence points (not enough to pip at red ranks anyway). Let‚Äôs say each teammate works on a similar number of gens (averaging 1.5-2 gens) that‚Äôs not enough lightbringer to pip, and the gates/hex totems only help so much. Let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt get chased because the killer decided to tunnel/camp one person. Looks like you don‚Äôt get evader points. 
---
Unbroken is really the only one that‚Äôs kinda fair the way this rank system works with the points needed. 
---
At red ranks, you need 13 points to pip (or at least 3 golds and 1 iridescent). Essentially, you have to pray your teammates suck if you want to pip. I‚Äôve managed to retain my rank 1 thus far by sheer luck of safety pipping, but I‚Äôve only actually pipped a handful of times, and when I did, it‚Äôs because I did all the work, and even then barely pipped.
---
Like I said, I‚Äôm all for making it more exclusive, and having people earn their rank, but I shouldn‚Äôt have to pray for my teammates to be horrible to get there.
---
That too.
---
Yeah Ive seen a few more posts on it and one about invisible generators. At least it's playable. The legion patch on ps4 was terrible. 
---
Ah, the good ol' Dance With Me+Lithe
---
Not just PC, it's my second 4K with the adept build on PS4 and the achievement is nowhere to be seen
---
When you're playing solo and a SWF trio loads in
---
Desire to Leave: As the Legion, have 4 survivors disconnect
---
When that happens I dont even look for them. Just go break palkets and ignore notifications. I dont watch them leave. Tbh unless you have instadowns or huntress/nurse a survivor can be across the map from the door and still get out. 
---
Unless dem real potatos.
---
Just chase them out? You get more points that way anyway 
---
When you confess your love to the girl you like and she replies with K
---
Dead or Alive but it's a horror game
---
The only reason I care about ranking up every month is to play with people of similar skill. If I can't, and keep getting easy games w/o pipping, it's super boring. I don't like to bully casual survivors/killers, and don't want to rely on chance to get good games. 
---
I'm all for them making ranking up more challenging; I think that's great, but they actually made it impossible. Now those "stressful" red rank games will be brought down to rank 10 - 8, mixed in with casual games. That seems like a ticking time bomb for Bhvr.

I'm a survivor main and I approve this message! They need to make a timer once the exit doors are opened

How to start a discussion 101 lol.
---
Been there before
---
The only way I could see any firearm working is if you cannot shoot people with it unless it's part of the execution. What you would use it for then I dunno, maybe shoot it into the air to make nearby survivors scream or something.
---
Pretty sure thats just a pallet stun time, the devs will probably change it to the old stun time. I have faith they will see how dumb that is.
---
Also been there before 
---
Give it a week or so, and things might return to normal.
---
Since Killer queues are trash right now, i started hopping on Survivor like right now and i'm at the lower ranks. I have yet to face a Plague.
---
So basically no different than most my survivor games?
---
give it 2-3 days and it'll start fading somewhat, a week and it should be relatively normal. that's my personal experience on PC
---
because the new pips are impossible to get i don't care about them anymore so tried get some fun and the new adept plague achivement. i'm waited 12 mins  doing nothing  (because if you are in a que u can't even view the shop... nevermind.)  (rank 11 eu )  
---
so after 12min im finally get a toxic swf group. after 6 min i'm dc'd and uninstalled. thanks the fun. pretty good patch so far
---
No one ever does
---
Ah, you're actually right. I've read both Decisive Strike's description and Diversion.
---
Diversion says "deactivate" while Decisive Strike says "disable."
---
Of course, the wording could be inconsistent, especially because it's not a finished perk.
---
It's still super unlikely that you'd get more than one use out of this perk but you definitely *could* get more than one use.
---
I needed to check the post 3 times after is comment and didn‚Äôt see nothing. Then I checked you comment and the post 3 times too. Only realised after reading OP‚Äôs comment again
---
I played against a Wraith who's terror radius just fucking vanished permanently even when he was visible.
---
2000 hour player here/
---
I pip almost every game in red ranks as killer. I even double pip if I do really well. If people aren't pipping as killer it is because they are not as good as they think they are. Brutal truth, sorry.
---
Only exception is you often only safety pip if you mori people down, even with devour hope as the emblem system punishes you for mori'ing.
---
Everyone agrees and i think they will change or revert the ranking system.
---
Yeah they gave survivors new voice lines. They have new coughing fits during plague sickness and they will sometimes gasp or yell when beginning a fall. 
---
I'm miffed because its pretty obvious that Jake got a different voice actor than the rest of his voices. 
---
BECAUSE THE NEW PIPS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM ANYMORE SO TRIED GET SOME FUN AND THE NEW ADEPT PLAGUE ACHIVEMENT. I'M WAITED 12 MINS DOING NOTHING (BECAUSE IF YOU ARE IN A QUE U CAN'T EVEN VIEW THE SHOP... NEVERMIND.) (RANK 11 EU )
---
SO AFTER 12MIN IM FINALLY GET A TOXIC SWF GROUP. AFTER 6 MIN I'M DC'D AND UNINSTALLED. THANKS THE FUN. PRETTY GOOD PATCH SO FAR
---
Not controversial it seems. Jane is thicc but is she better than Kate? This is the real question 
---
If she rings the bell she becomes P3
---
THIS GAME MAKES ME WANT TO D I E.
---
HOLY FUCK, QUEUE TIMES ARE GETTING TERRIBLE, EVERY FUCKING GAME HAS DCS (EVEN MORE THEN BEFORE) MY GAME CRASHES RANDOMLY NOW, AND I CAN DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO HELP MY PIPS IN THE NEW MATCHMAKER.
---
RANK 1 SURVIVORS DON'T E X I S T. THEY'VE DIED. RANK 1 WHO ARE YOU???
---
ALSO HOLY FUCK PLAGUE MOVES WAY TOO FAST JESUS CHRIST. I'LL HAVE THE HEARTBEAT FOR ALL OF A FEW SECONDS AND I'M GETTING NASTY STUFF. I'M OKAY WITH KILLERS MOVING FASTER THEN SURVIVORS (MOSTLY) BUT??? BOI SHE FEELS WAY TOO QUICK.
---
How often did we discuss that players should not be punished for pursuing their only objective on this sub alone?
---
I'll be honest I dont really wanna play the Plague right now. Her bloodpoint generation is really bad. I loved grabbing Corrupt Purge and hitting survivors with it. Then I found out I wasn't getting brutality points for the hits. I found myself just wanting to M1 for more points.
---
If they make Corrupt Purge grant brutality points on hit I'll be happy.
---
The legion looks pretty cool, too bad that they wasted the whole ‚Äúgroup of teenagers as killers‚Äù idea with a mend simulator.
---
Dude that‚Äôs just huntress‚Äôs lullaby tire 4 smh
---
i guess that is based on preference, Kate looks good in general, where as i find jane to only look really good in specific outfits.
---
I played with a friend today and everything worked fine. I noticed that I couldn't invite her thought. DbD completely disappeared from the party menu so my friend had to create the lobby.
---
In one of the games, they didn't get a generator done. I think I had six hooks. In another of the games, they got four generators done but I had either seven or eight hooks. I tend to be slug heavy and I do go back to the hook when I feel a save is about to be made. Like I get what the system is trying to do but I didn't feel a depip was justified in either case to be honest. Still feel they're trying to shoehorn a particular style into the game.
---
That shit is fun in a fucked kinda way. I usually do it unintentionally when I‚Äôm about to kill the last guy and the hatch happens to be next to the hook. Like have fun dying next to the hatch.
---
I mean, depends on how you get this 4k. People claiming this are either being super hyperbolical or they kill everyone on their first hook with no gens left, idk? I'm still easily getting double pip as a killer and a pip as a survivor, so I see no major difference from before. You shouldn't be entitled to get easy pips just for playing the game but for actually being good at it. So to answer your question, yes, it's much better now than it was before. Keep playing and improving and you'll see it's true.
---
I don't really hard camp unless someone is toxic and that wasn't the case in either game. I actually pipped up in a game where I chainsaw camped a teabagger to death and killed his three teammates normally. 
---
I can't even tell rhe difference tbh
---
How is this perk strong? It happens once in a match, once your healed your revealed to the killer.....how is that strong?
---
Grim Pantry is more Hag's map than the Pale Rose is,  the Pantry is where she was held by the cannibals that captured her.
---
Freddy without addons is actually not so bad compared to others. And how is he worse than Doctor? Doctor's power without (even with) addons does literally nothing. Pathetic shock range, madness doesn't do anything apart of making them scream. His only ability is that he can move slower if he wants and he giggles, which is actually nice. Freddy is at least low and has smaller TR with 115% MS. His power slows the game and he can see survivors in DW. I don't mean he's amazing but even with addons he's still better than our poor giggiing zappy boy. I really hope the devs will do something about Doctor, he is just pathetic.
---
I was trying to do my 3 Billy challenges and the last p3 Claudette was waiting to t bag and I came flying in and killed her and it felt amazing
---
holy shit
---
*Huntress goes for hatches in nearby locker*
---
They need to tune it but the old pip system is fucking garbage. They need to implement something so you can facecamp your way into red ranks or get to red ranks with no clue how to loop
---
I'm really happy they fixed this shit but this is a little bit too hard. The idea for the new DS is really nice but I think enduring shouldn't affect this.
---
Doubtful. I‚Äôve had amazing survivor games and in red ranks and only black pipped. Started at rank 2 and now i‚Äôm one depip from 5 because it‚Äôs literally impossible to pip up if the killer is bad, your teammates are bad, or you don‚Äôt have your greatest game of the year 
---
Come on man, 6 hooks = 4 kills? There's your reason. 
---
Is this momo
---
I completely emphasize with this post. Though I‚Äôm the one who chose the pastel masked Feng who‚Äôs easy to see and chase around, so it‚Äôs kinda deserved. Luckily I don‚Äôt care about ranks or really much else except having an enjoyable time. 3 killers back to back slashed me for three minutes while the others did gens, so it could be worse. I made a post about this and people suggested that they had bad manners or I behaved toxically, but these recent ones definitely caught me before I could do anything but run and work on gens.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, but I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs similar. Thanks! A week break from survivor may be what I need anyway.
---
do gens lol git gud
---
/s
---
Blizzard and Riot for imbalance, Bethesda and Ubisoft for bugs, EA and Microsoft for extortion.
---
Maybe others will tire of her as well for this reason. I understand wanting to try out a new killer though, so I certainly wouldn‚Äôt fault them if they ended up loving her. Thanks for mentioning a negative aspect of playing her!
---
I love playing against the nurse. 
---
Lol
---
It's referring to the Ash leaks, which only appeared on PS4.
---
Lol, im dumb.
---
Someone should go ahead and make a survivor version of the "Damn Scots, they ruined Scotland!" meme from the Simpsons.
---
For reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5lYXaVkA0U

Does seem kind of convenient 
---
Is another objective, if you don't pursue it to u can get punish.
---
EVERYONE BITCHED ABOUT RANKING BEING TOO EASY AND HOW RANKS DON‚ÄôT MATTER. YET NOW THAT IT‚ÄôS HARDER TO RANK UP THEY ARE BITCHING AND SUDDENLY RANKS SEEM TO MATTER TO PEOPLE. MAKE UP TOUR FUCKING MINDS.
---
Sorry for the ugly pic but it was live so I was limited on time. 
---
You say that like survivors aren‚Äôt also screwed over by the new ranking system. 
---
The amount of messages I get because I put them in the dying state and proceed to hook them is unbelievable.
---
I hate how accurate this is but I can't stay mad. This game was too good.
---
Clown was a boring addition to the game with the worst excuse for a backstory and absolutely no redeeming qualities even before the entity (also what happened to never adding a clown killer? Another broken promise from the devs there).
---
Spirit was alright lore-wise even though she could do with a lot more clothing and the jiggle physics are completely unnecessary but then they added the schoolgirl outfit for her which they shouldn't have because she's an adult and it's contributing to the problem in the East.
---
Legion was a disaster, not much else to say about that, and I haven't played much in regards to the plague so I can't judge her accurately.
---
Balance-wise it's been a disaster. Instead of closing the gap between solo and SWF, they've made it so unless all of your teammates are competent in solo matches, you won't survive against a semi-decent killer unless it's a hatch escape. With the new problem of the ranking system it's more unreliable to get decent teammates than ever before so you're basically fucked if you play solo unless you get very lucky.
---
Killer-wise, with the problem of solo survivors, SWF groups are more prominent than ever before so you're more likely to get destroyed as well.
---
I counted the pallets on the map once and got 8 including the shack. Thats not enough against a half decent killer but all the little 20 hour killers complained about getting looped so they nerfed it and now survivors don't have a chance. I've chased someone around a corner expecting to get stunned by a pallet and low and behold there wasn't one there. I felt bad for them with how unfortunate it was. They nearly made it and they probably deserved to but they didn't stand a chance. 
---
I could go on but I won't since this is already TL;DR. Point is, I can see a lot more negatives than positives right now and the devs really need to get their act together. 
---
*BUBBA TANTRUM NOISES*
---
the main thing with that is he can interrupt actions with shock and he also doesn‚Äôt have to wait 7s to get a hit
---
I support a harder ranking system but only if there was a reward at the end with no reward, there is really nothing to strive for past bragging rights.
---
If you reward people, a lot more people would attempt to actually rank up and maintain red ranks. This would help with the queue time issues since more people will be wanting to reach those ranks.
---
I don't see a problem with it. In what other game with a ranking system was it so easy to get Rank 1?
---
Literally every other game, DoTA 2, LoL, CS:GO- you could invest thousands of hours and never reach the topmost ranks.
---
In DBD, if you just played enough- eventually you got to R1.
---
Know when ranks are meaningless? When anyone and everyone can reach the top.
---
I really wish you could turn off chat in this game. It's just toxic as fuck.
---
Solution here is obvious, hopefully we won't have to wait too long to get it.
---
I havent noticed a single differnce at all. 
---
What am I missing?
---
Honestly for me and my friends the Xbox versio runs very well. There isn't as much frames as PC of course, but by the way people describe PS4, Xbox DbD seems alot better.
---
Thanks for the info! It seems to vary from person to person.
---
Pipping almost every game as killer in red ranks currently. I have had DC's. I have had people kill themselves on hooks. I still pip.
---
This is on you bud.
---
You can also say that if your side (killer or survivor)and you absolutely dominate the other side... Then do you deserve to gain ranking?
---
Other rank systems generally give little to no rank if it's a high skill player vs a low skill player and the high skill player wins. 
---
But what if I want iridescent 
---
Exact same the other way round. If one survivor DC's it basically means the killer will depip

---
Ok wasn‚Äôt clear, jackass 
---
actually the best response is to not say anything and leave
---
Because it's easy for the plague to infect survivors and make them broke. Without the Instaheal it would be like legion and no thanks
---
Actually, once you close the chat it'll be closed forever until you open it again.
---
Too dummy thicc steam doesn‚Äôt support files that large.
---
I mean permanently. Having to click an arrow at the end of every match is a pain.
---
God the devs have come up with some stupid shit but this is beyond dumb because it‚Äôs intentional. 
---
Thank you for letting me know. 
---
Both sides should not be punished for another‚Äôs actions. It‚Äôs ridiculous. 
---
So you‚Äôre telling us you‚Äôre gunna play like every other killer?? I really doubt we‚Äôll mind getting tunneled, proxy camped and slugged for a 4K since it happens every match anyways, then hit on the hook or watched bleed out. Cheers!
---
Saying I'm a killer main on console, and I main nurse I think personally for me its gonna be a while as I do not want to go back to nurse console frames
---
Headcanon is Myers slipped it under the mask and fricking gnawed the end off
---
Stop saying that blinding is toxic. What are survivors supposed to do?
---
I'm not having an issue, Have you tried turning it off/on again?
---
Sounds like something DBD would do. Send it in! XD
---
NOT ONLY DO I KEEP GETTING 300 AND HIGHER PING LOBBIES BUT I ALSO KEEP GOING AGAINST RED RANK KILLERS WHILE I'M RANK 14. I CAME BACK TO DBD FOR THIS UPDATE BUT I GUESS ITS TIME TO LEAVE AGAIN.
---
Honestly good for him getting stuck with noed
---
Bbq and deerstalker?
---
I'm wondering how the stricter ranking will impact queue times for the higher ranks though. Rank one lobbies for killers already took forever, and the new matchmaking system has doubled my usual wait times. A smaller pool of survivors for rank 5-1 killers would make this problem even worse.
---
He looks like shark boy with glasses
---
I'm sorry 
---
it's all fun and games until they get hooked and dc after teabagging
---
Add a setting - Allow Kate earrape? 
---
Why do you care so much about pooping? Honestly people should be grateful for this new update because rank 1 is a complete Fucking joke that makes the game twice as unenjoyable as it already is
---
I mean you‚Äôre punished now for being fair now 
---
Not for me at least
---
N O
---
It‚Äôs not like most survivors will notice a difference? I mean honestly
---
Was listening to Long Distance Call by Phoenix (around 0:57) and your dance routine synchronized well
---
This happened to me once as a survivor playing against a Meyers. He‚Äôd go off and do something and then come back every once in a while to check on me. I finally got out by mashing a ton of buttons. He stood there and let me run away. But eventually he hooked me. It was kind of nice I guess. 
---
Can someone explain this new pip system to me? The patch notes really weren't clear in my opinion
---
A man who respects opinions, finally someone I can follow
---
True, they don't make the doors open, but they can potentially make the killer powerfull, so they are another objective.
---
There‚Äôs quite a few nice killers, he just means they‚Äôre gonna be even less of them now. 
---
Did he confirm that it would be fixed soon? I saw him reply in a thread that it was just a bug, with no timelines. Not trying to be argumentative, just don't want to get my hopes up if we will need to wait till the mid chapter patch for Spirit to be playable again.
---
Why do survivors keep talking about the old DS like it was a must to have...?
---
I didn't say it was toxic it's just a joke.
---
But it's also too easy of a instaheal. Like there's no reason for survivors to heal each other as plague unless I hit them and don't puke on them. That's why I'm saying they need to make the whole cleansing speed longer. Or take out the insta heal. 
---
Agreed. At first it seems like a bit much, but when you look at the trade off, the insta heal isn‚Äôt really relevant. And it gives a sense of fulfilment for survivors by being able to just fully heal and move on. 
---
No problem man!
---
Sorry, I meant to say *Soon‚Ñ¢*, if you know what I mean
---
and that's all the statement "jane is thicc" is
---
**a joke**
---
Nope, but his perks are available as regular non-teachables with generic dudes instead of Bill on their icons
---
Yes, they we‚Äôre two patches, one with Chapter 10 and now Chapter 11. On my PS4 Pro the Framerate is always at 60FPS with small and rare Framedrops. There will be more optimization in future. 
---
ummm
---
Now its easier to stay in low ranks, works for me.
---
Any killer with instadown methods you should make sure to run to a loop as soon as you hear them. Plague, I'd say, is a mix of Billy's chainsaw and Huntress' range. With green bile, she can pretty much one-shot you out in the open. Red bile is like Huntress but a lot harder to dodge.
---
The way I play is: While you're healthy, loop her like she's a Huntress, since she likely wants to get you into the broken state with her puke. Also take advantage of cover in the loop. When you're injured/broken, her vomit can't really do much at that point, so just focus on not getting hit. With red bile, avoid the loops with low walls. Either try to survive the timer or risk going for a palletstun.
---
There have been improvements, yes. The graphics took a slight dip, but the performance is smoother. Xb1x btw, can‚Äôt say for base consoles.
---
I still love the game, but I hope you guys take the jokes with a grain of salt. The majority are too busy enjoying the game to be here discussing how great the game is.
---
Im only at rank 9 so dont feel too bad about it. Im sure ill float somewhere around 8-11 for the rest of my career.
---
U just want a broken killer at this point.
---
FUUUUUCK THIS RANKING SYSTEM. IT‚ÄôS HONESTLY SO HARD TO BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE THOUGHT OF THIS IDEA, TESTED IT(?), AND THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO EXECUTE? KILLERS ARE ACTING MORE DESPERATE AND ASSHOLEY BECAUSE OF THIS SYSTEM, AND MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE UP AS SURVIVOR EVEN IF YOU ARE CARRYING YOUR WEIGHT
---
THE ONLY WAY TO EARN BP TO MOVE ABOVE EVEN RANK 10 AS SURVIVOR IS TO STRETCH THE GAME FOR A LONG ASS FUCKING TIME, WHICH IS, AGAIN, IMPOSSIBLE WITH THESE DESPERATE KILLERS YOU SATAN SPAWNS HAVE CREATED WITH THIS STUPID FUCKING RANKING SYSTEM
---
Not much of a clown player honestly. But I can offer some general M1 killer advice, Enduring + Spirits fury are your new best friends, never respect a pallet unless you intend to use that respect for a future mind game. The clown suffers from terrible map pressure so the sooner you can snowball the better off you'll be. I can't recall the names of his addons at the moment but whichever one reduces your throw charge time I've found to be extremely helpful(most any killer addon that reduces cool down/charge time of an ability is usually a good choice if you don't/can't use purple addons). Reload your bottles once you've hooked/down a survivor. Keep in mind that the clown is a tall and can make mind games around jungle gyms and such difficult. Getting survivors to play short side of loops is difficult if their experienced, try to bottle the short side and force them to take the long end of the loop or go through the gas and take the hit either way. If you recognize a loop that they are running towards go ahead and toss a bottle at that loops window/pallet. The last bit of advice from a non-clown main is to use your bottles to herd the survivors to where you want them to go, a lot of the time you can force a survivor to go around a loop if they see the gas or force them to take a hit from the now unsafe pallet/window thats been gassed.
---
Honestly, I think the real reason for the instaheal is because its honestly super easy to down a survivor as plague. Yes it can be annoying, but reality is, as plague you WANT them hitting those fountains to get that juicy corrupted purge. If it didn't have something like an instant heal, even if you simply slow down the time to activate it. There would be little reason to hit those fountains because the survivors know if they do, they are giving you a even stronger power for little gain.
---
Happened to me earlier today. Next match I had a T-posing Dwight healing me
---
It sounds like she was still somehow on top of you once she hit you so I think it is safe to say she was using it.
---
He watched the VOD of the streamer he played with

---
*" A more controversial example would be a game in which you utterly annihilate everyone. For example, I've had games where I snowball and have all four survivors slugged within the first 2 minutes of the game. I only safety pipped for this - for completely destroying the opposing team. Those against the strict rank system would say "That is ridiculous, you completely outplayed those survivors and you didn't even rank up for it." I, however, would say that it is literally impossible for an even somewhat coordinated team to lose that quickly, so in this scenario I'm essentially beating up babies, which again is no proof of my skill. This is where the argument becomes interesting. "*  
---
I would like to add that if matchmaker is doing its job then NO, you aren't fighting babies and winning. You should be rewarded for your cunning, quick decision making and their poor ability to judge or assess the situation. You are playing players that are roughly in your player rank level and should be rewarded accordingly. 
---
I played 4 matches yesterday 4 as killer and one as survivor. The game ran the smoothest I've ever seen and looks the best and clearest I've ever noticed by a huge difference. I haven't noticed it dropping below 30 fps I think it's stable at 30-35fps even in the menu the frames seem like 30-40. I hope it honestly stays this way and gets better over time. Try it out yourself and reply back to see if there's a consistency

I present to you the 2016 december update that introduced dwight with chainsaw, nea who can blink like nurse, floating head myers with empaty, very fast hag that can't turn, meg with 4 sprint bursts, survivors having placing traps on their own feets, keys that heal and forcing the killer to chance character and play perkless
---
I mean there‚Äôs no way to say who is your killer while you are in the lobby. There are also omegablink nurses and Franks mixtape Legions farming bloodpoints out there. 
---
* Reposts within the last 60 days are not permitted.
---
1) put your clouds at the middle of the loop, the furthest away from the pallet. It gives you enough time for you to catch them because they have to go through it or break the loop. If they throw the pallet down early, bottle them then break it. If you run out of bottles in a chase, quit chasing that survivor and focus on the weaker survivors.
---
2) bottle them as they run. It takes practice but if you aim more downwards the bottle can hit short distances faster than by lobbing it high. Bring the sticky bottle for more ammo to practice with.
---
Clown lacks map presence but is the king anti looper. Bring kits that help slow the game down since you can end chases quickly with well aimed bottles. He just takes practice but he's very much worth it.

LMAO, @ THE LEAK.....  EVEN DEVS DONT LIKE THE DEVS...
---
unnecessarily mean i think
---
I‚Äôm on XB1S and it‚Äôs buttery smooth, Great experience now. 
---
in the meantims ohtofu says playing killer is boring and easy. he did this before the ds nerf. i don't mean that tofu is some great guy with wisdom or stuff, but good killers somehow still wiped more. it's literally boring to watch good killer streams on twitch.
---
Never mind! I went and checked. It‚Äôs STILL AVAILABLE on Console. We can STILL SEE IT.
---
Run to high walls and jungle gyms. Those are safest from her vomit.
---
It‚Äôs to balance the plague. Imagine having to heal after cleansing sickness only to get puked on again immediately after, like someone else mentioned it would become M1 simulator and draw the games out forever. The trade off for the instaheal is giving the plague a 115% huntress type ability, which is a fair trade-off for both sides.
---
One of the devs mentioned a heal over time type mechanic when using a fountain, which could possibly work if it was tested and some tweaks. I think the current setup is just fine though.
---
Thanks for getting the Law and Order SVU theme stuck in my head üòÇ
---
Also support means a lot for devs like BHVR. I'll buy a copy just to show the market is there. Maybe the switch port is a disaster but if it lets someone somewhere know that theres a market for games like DBD and F13 on the switch then our chances of getting a more dedicated experience/IP is greater. 
---
plus playing as Michael Myers anywhere would be fucking insane and its what 11 year old me always wanted
---
You can‚Äôt see through that mask but I assure you he‚Äôs winking at you
---
He only brought in BPS because he ran out of Survivor Pudding.
---
What you need to understand is that, if you main one killer all the time, especially one like Legion, and just use BBQ, you will inevitably get far more bloodpoints than you can ever possibly spend.
---
That Legion is sitting on twenty-five Bloody Party Streamers, and he's only using them until his next Survivor Pudding comes up. After all, no matter how much of everything else he gets, he has to keep farming for Frank's Mixtape and Cold Dirt.
---
That's what that BPS was for. Frank's Mixtapes, and Cold Dirts.
---
Not having huntress or trapper in the cuddly section
---
You're dead wrong but okay
---
Would love that

Yes, yes he does üò§
---
My big issue here, is it almost seems wrong for ash to be In a position where he can‚Äôt fight back. Unless one of his perks allows him to find broomsticks or chainsaws around the map, it don‚Äôt feel like Ash. Also, we need spoken lines

Thanks to the original maker of the template u/ZombieHuggerr.

Ace is me!!! Totally me. Lol!!!

---
- I like the idea of masking your footsteps. Would be good if it was 100% but then removed the effects it has on Bear traps and Hag Phantasms
---
- Having a perk that removes the reliability of a killers power is bad for both survivor and killer. Makes the perk balanced towards very situational use which is bad for survivors and for killers it makes a perk that can negate their power which is bad for them. 
---
- Same reason why no one runs slippery meat. It's balanced around escaping bear traps easily but it's too situational for any use
---
Swift Aid
---
- Seems very situational and almost useless. If you finished healing a survivor I suppose not having scratch marks are ok but if the killer is close enough to you then they dont matter. 
---
- Funnily enough it has the same issue with poised that scratch marks disappearing for 10 seconds doesnt really make a difference to a killer unless they are actively chasing you over a long distance.
---
- Their aura being concealed doesnt seem to provide anything. The killer wouldnt usually see their aura unless they had object of obsession or BBQ were to activate. In both cases these are incredibly situational. It wouldnt counter nurses calling either as killers see the aura during the healing process.
---
- Maybe change it to provide bonuses for the more survivors you heal similar to autodidact. Would provide synergy for both perks. 
---
Musical Presence
---
- Once again the perk is way too situational for any type of use. I can see where you are going at with the counter against perks like tinkerer and dark devotion but both are too situational for use. 
---
Goodluck argueing about this. If survivors arent full health at all times then they will uproar. Might as well delete the post.
---
Just leave. Gg, leave game. Takes 3 seconds.
---
If we do I wonder if itll come with a deadite killer or just ash
---
Each tier of emblem (none, bronze, silver, gold, iridescent) provide   +0, 1, 2, 3, 4 respective points towards pipping. Pretty much all they did was change the amount of these points you need to pip. So, now from ranks 8 - 5 you need at least 12 out of 16 to pip (all categories gold) and ranks 4 - 1 you need at least 13 out of 16 (3 gold, 1 iri).
---
So far the only perks that have this problem is unbreakable and left behind. That‚Äôll I‚Äôve found anyway. 
---
I like to barf on them. It‚Äôs so much fun and satisfying like a cat marking their territory 
---
More like it's raining bugs...

 Luigi new survivor?

Shirtless Myers ;)
---
I JUST 3 GOT 3 KILLS AS THE PLAGUE AND GOT TERRIBLE BP (FIX THAT!) AND -1 PIP. PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR AND I DON'T THINK I'LL KEEP PLAYING WITHT HIS SYSTEM.
---
I was watching someone play last night and they bit toer 3 decisive and the person had enduring. It wasnt even a stun.
---
Oh so that‚Äôs what unbreakable does. Thank you Bill, very cool!
---
Is sound fucked again? It's been fine to me so far, 2.4.0 was awful. Can they please not fuck spirit over every patch though? That would be great.
---
I agree 100%. It's pathetic and I hate how they took one of our only few decent perks we have and rendered it to be useless.
---
He can't interrupt shit. He will never catch good survivors maybe at a few really strong windows in the whole game(Suffocation Pit, Rancid Abattoir, Ironworks of misery) but usually the game decide to let them vault anyway. The slow down, time required to switch, charge time, crappy range, all of that makes his power completely unviable. It may work on potatoes camping pallets, but you usually you can hit them anyway. I completely agree with tru3 that his power is supposed to be antilooping but it doesn;t work that way.  
---
In my opinion, Doctor is the worst killer in the game. And it's a pity cuz I love his giggles.
---
While I agree that you probably should black pip if you escape - why should you pip against a baby killer/survivor? You stay at your rank, the other one deranks. Sounds alright.
---
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain...    Or in the case, both!
---
I'm dummy thicc
---
Totally agree. I tried to protest it before it happened because I knew what was happening. Everyone just scoffed and now we‚Äôve lost one of our only good perks because BHVR only listens to low rank killer mains 
---
It scales now with your rank.  So at low ranks it‚Äôs very easy to pip, at red rank as survivor you basically need to fix all of the gens, rescue every other survivor, be chased for 5 minutes and sacrifice your first born to get a pip.
---
Art the Clown does this 
---
All maps have crows
---
UE is the same as walking speed 
---
The only reason I‚Äôm not so excited for Jane is because she is fat. Doesnt matter how thicc if you are fat .. at least from my pov 
---
Why? It was proven to be on the console versions. 
---
Yep seems about right. They should‚Äôve made the stun LONGER because it‚Äôs apparently and anti-tunneling perk but *surprise* it was just a good cover up for a complete nerf. It‚Äôs shitty to call it a rework when the only thing they did was nerf 
---
It's just as insane for survivors to pip, have you not played survivor side yet?
---
Chase music is ridiculously loud for me, I can't hear survivors even with stridor on. A lot of threads I saw on the official forums were complaining about the chase music levels as well. I wonder if I do suffer from damaged hearing due to my line of work, so I might be struggling with it more than others. Judging by the amount of threads on the official dead by daylight forum no, I'm not alone.
---
24k in 10minutes is decent really. To get 32k you need a long game and to let everyone heal, get hooked 3 times, always use your power for each down, etc.
---
Survivors are just the worst, most are self entitled trashbabies that not only make it horrible to play killer but to play as survivor too since they'll screw you over as soon as things get a bit dicey for them.
---
Playing Survivor is easy mode in this game because Survivors are inherently more powerful than the killer and that's always been the case. Even in maps that are favourable to the killer are still not too difficult for survivors yet the same doesn't apply to killers. Honestly, I have a harder time dealing with other survivors than I do with the killer at this point. 
---
&gt;whitewash
---
üôÑüòí
---
That's a fair point, but a lot of bugs that were in the ptb and reported (broken borrowed time, insanely broken audio) still made it in this patch.
---
Yeah but OP was surely the winner here he really showed that killer how good he is XD
---
Pretty sure everyone has always called it a nerf. I also dont think the time should go down when you're downed on the ground.
---
Well since now it only works after getting unhooked and downed within 60 seconds it‚Äôs pretty underwhelming and doesn‚Äôt get used often. Enduring probably shouldn‚Äôt make it a 1/4 second stun. FYI the new DS is far from a crutch perk now but that‚Äôs just my opinion.
---
How about trying different perks? Don't feel trapped into using one specific
---
EA bad
---
Did you use moris? They did not count on the old system. [I got the achievement](https://i.imgur.com/avMldne.jpg), but I had both 4 iridescents and a 4k so I can't say for sure if they changed it in 2.6
---
&gt;If you kill everyone in five seconds the Entity would be like "Yo what the fuck, wheres all that hope I need to feed on and shit." If you drag the game out and push it closer to the gates being opened, story-wise, you're doing exactly what the Entity wants by giving the survivors hope they might actually escape. This also leads into another defense of the system.
---
A lot of your post makes sense. But doesn't the gatekeeper emblem contradict this line of reasoning to an extent? It heavily rewards ending the game as far away from the gates being opened as possible. So it seems like there's two conflicting scoring philosophies there
---
Meg main no brain
---
Ace main big brain
---
Jane main big... uhhh....
---
is this a *brain blast* 
---
You can just run her around a building forever, it's horrible map for Huntress.
---
*incoming 4th wave femenism*
---
Do you understand what countering means?
---
That's no moon... oh wait. 
---
I see this in every survivor game I play there is always 1 or 2 people who wait for the killer. It's stupid I mean just leave already.
---
I mean this in the nicest way possible, but obviously a killer would enjoy this nerf. But we‚Äôre still waiting for a NOED nerf they said isn‚Äôt coming. The window of time it‚Äôs active is too short and that‚Äôs what makes the perk garbage now. There‚Äôs two sides to this game and all the pandering to the killers is making a lot of survivors not want to play the game. I mean it isn‚Äôt just this they‚Äôre buffing more killer perks, the matchmaking sucks, they just released another REALLY good killer and a survivor with average/bad perks. I just don‚Äôt like that they keep fucking the survivors over and giving the killers what they want 
---
hahahahahahahaha
---
Yeah üòÇ
---
Yep, and low rank ones too, like rank 15
---
Do you understand the word punishment?
---
Legion sucks
---
Definitely agree, if you have a little time left and you get slugged that‚Äôs basically the new equivalent of juggling 
---
Ah gotcha. I read it like you could do it when ever how ever much you wish. But a combination of that with NOED and Blood Warden would be devastating and awesome. If you remove the end game part then you could separate it into two different perks. Still an awesome idea. I play both survivor and killer and this sounds like fun.
---
You should do a template of this with Trapper, if you can. I have something specific in mind...
---
 fire flower, super mushroom and tube system
---
Tube system would let him teleport from locker to locker if they are in a 5/10/15 meter range every 60/50/40 seconds
---
Fire flower stuns the killer when they hit you which needs to recharge 120/110/100 seconds
---
Super mushroom gives luigi a 3/6/9 second boost making him able to withstand an extra hit

Yeah I know, I‚Äôm just mad that they‚Äôve been fucking over survivors with nerfs for a long time now. Like the one good perk we had to really like fight back was this perk, and now it‚Äôs practically useless 
---
THICCass\*
---
Yea they should just make it not affected by enduring.
---
Tell that to killers Ranks 1-15 using BBQ, NoED, Ruin, Nurses Calling and Sloppy Butcher every game. And just recently the new killers Gen Protecting perk to pair off with Ruin. 
---
Yes, I do, but if I counter what you are trying to punish me with, then I am not being punished am I? That means your punishment has been countered.
---
i mean matchmaking is busted af so i really don‚Äôt care about rank. you can get a red ranked killer or yellow ranked killer. i‚Äôm literally just fucking around at this point. 
---
I'm pretty split, I play(ed) them pretty equally, though I don't play much anymore.
---
I got you buddy
---
Agreed. I have a friend who has a normal Xbox One and they‚Äôve said the experience has increased. 
---
I‚Äôm sure there will still be lag with doctor on red forest or something like that but the game has gotten a lot smoother over time.  
---
\*ahem\*
---
Legion bad.
---
This happen to me 3 times last night
---
I‚Äôve started using it now because bt doesn‚Äôt work. I hate myself.
---
Trophies are broken at the moment for the dlc. Adept only requires a 4k regardless of pips. Even with that I've done merciless 4k with her and it still wouldn't unlock.
---
&gt; you can insert yourself into a chase if you are looking for boldness.
---
You understand what you have suggested is considered intentionally throwing, right? You have literally suggested running into the killer with the express purpose of being hit.
---
&gt;&gt;If you carried your team and did all the gens, you deserve to rank up. 
---
&gt;Why? You held M1 for 5 minutes.
---
Yes, that is the objective. Your job as a survivor and the win condition. It's literally what survivors are supposed to be doing. Regardless of the skill involved, it has to be done. Punishing the survivors for doing the objective is how you get survivors to not do them.
---
&gt;I would find it very hard to believe that getting multiple unhooks / heals would result in you not pipping
---
Well, it's very simple, you get an iridescent Benevolent, and then you can't do any better in that category.
---
The issue is that you can only do so well in a category before anything else doesn't count anymore. That's why people were fine with the lower requirements. I'm fine with too many people ranking up, rank really doesn't matter, and if it makes more people feel validated, all the power to them. The issue is when people play their asses off and the game tells them they didn't diversify their portfolios like this is a mutual fund, and now nobody is happy.
---
*Entity* (but like, said ala *Newman*)
---
Same happened to me last night. What a gaming experience.
---
The worst part is that the gen-jockey types, the ones that give you five minute matches, are going to be stuck in the middle ranks since you need to do saves and accumulate Boldness/Chaser points to pip. So there's a possibility that middle-ranked killers will be see the quickest matches, which means there's less time for *them* to pip, too. 
---
Right, bit then the beginning of your comment is way off. I said we're lucky if we get it in 9 months(if not later) with how they're treating console. You started your comment saying we're not lucky, which sure I get that, but you are missing the point of my comment. Just saying this is kinda dumb for a post that was over 2 weeks ago. 
---
This is a really big challenge
---
Ikr but it feels so much faster even if so
---
But Jane isn't obese...
---
If this aint the truth
---
I know you're just joking, but Jane isn't even remotely obese.
---
Please don't promote unhealthy body images. Saying Jane is obese can lead people to become anorexic.
---
Her deviousness generation is awful, brutality isn't good either.
---
Lol you should‚Äôve used it when it actually worked and was good. I hate that players feel ashamed for using perks in this game. 
---
The entire point of the emblem system is to make it harder to rank up if you play killer like a dick, or you don't contribute as a survivor. It's not "I did what I wanted so I should pip," it's about encouraging engaging gameplay over limited stuff like immersing
---
I can tell you only play 1 side. Sit down.
---
Agreed. The problem isn't that the Ranking system is overly hard to rank in, it's that it forces you into a very specific playstyle that not everyone finds fun or rewarding.
---
Combo that with OoO, dead hard, and adrenaline and you have yourself a new killer running build.
---
Using OoO after you‚Äôre already revealed from MoM feels like it‚Äôs kind of necessary so the killer can‚Äôt sneak up on you because they know exactly where you are
---
Iridescent Ebony Mori: allows you to kill survivors during the selection screen.
---
So it bought you 60 seconds as the Survivor, and you're complaining? Granted, the old one could save more time if the Survivor had a chance to find a good running spot.  
---
By the way, happy cake day!
---
if you‚Äôre playing casually while do you care what rank you are? it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs any rewards that go along with it
---
PLEASE do
---
Is that why my cat throws up on my carpet? :0
---
Because it's shoved in our throats to separate newbees and casuals from veterans and tryhards. You know, so everyone could have fun. Except it doesn't really work anymore because of repeated bad decisions, so we are back in essentially unranked.
---
Epic, I want this style for Bubba fan art.
---
Ok ok fine, rank 10. That way they‚Äôre good enough to chase but not good enough to finish the chase against the survivor again after getting stunned for 4 seconds 
---
I was pretty shocked when I realized this game had jiggle physics after leaving for a year. 
---
Survivors aren't meant to be able to "fight back". Their goal is to persist, endure, long enough to get the exit gates powered.
---
Any gen ladiesssss, nice 
---
Have you seen the stun when killer have Enduring?
---
I can do one for you if want or you can do it in photoshop 
---
Wow from fucking google and you dont even bother to state his name
---
Oh and by the way, he won the art contest last year, soo I dont really see the point of your photoshop
---
THANK YOU! Glad I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks the puke ability is kinda OP
---
Jane at that point where you can‚Äôt tell if their stomach is flat and they just have big hips or if they‚Äôre fat and the shirts hiding it 
---
I saw a few with BT last night. Wasn't really an issue, but it's still fairly meta I guess 
---
what‚Äôs the problem? they were probably swf with the rank gap and it seemed like you did okay with a 2k
---
Those hips don‚Äôt lie my friend. 
---
I''m currently a rank 1 survivor through the previous system, despite having less than a 50% escape rate. I know I'm not alone. IMO that should not be possible in a good ranking system, and when it is, it makes it so much harder to balance toward the *"2 Kills, 2 Escapes"* standard they're aiming for. Conversely, it's always been much harder for killers to pip with less than a 50% kill rate, I doubt there's *any* rank 1 killers that are under a 2 kill average. 
---
So yeah, hopefully this change can start giving BHVR a better idea of where to target balance adjustments, it should weed out survivors like myself who only thrive in a support role and suck in chases or are hesitant to attempt rescues. I think it's too strict, but I agree, I see where they're going with it. 
---
I'm Dead Hard.
---
Not even fight back, just get away from the killer without the help of their fellows, and help buy their teammates time to win the game. 
---
Ah, there it is. The inevitable salt.
---
I dont have any problems with dead hard. Its probably a latency issue. 
---
Borrowed time and WGLF dont work when exit gates are powered. It‚Äôd be funny to see if No one left behind doesnt work either
---
REMEMBER THE NAME PLACEHOLDER FOR QUENTIN THAT WAS SOMEONE ELSE?  
---
# ASH COULD BE A PLACEHOLDER
---
Look at the tag lmao
---
I'm honestly reserving judgement on this emblem system until I see what BHVR's grand plan is for their 'End Game Rework'. 
---
Much of these ideal scenarios for getting Gold / Iridescent would make more sense if the endgame of DbD becomes more than "Sweeping survivors out the gate simulator" or "Slug the third to get the 4th" or "Hatch Standoff : The Movie!". While BHVR has been keeping a pretty tight lip on the matter outside of occasionally answering "What happened to the hatch changes?", I'm still remaining hopeful that we'll see something that turns post 5 generators game play into something more than 'clean up and move on' duty. 
---
There's been more and more signs recently that they're setting up to make some pretty big changes. This emblem rework is just another piece of framework.
---
However I'm initially a little wary with the changes as they are now because you want to know the most common sentiment I see regarding these changes is?
---
Something along the lines of "Awesome, now it will be easier to derank" On the plus side, at least they eliminated 3rd party deranking this patch so that big thorn is gone. And I don't think adding a reward will be a miracle panacea to this issue. But this is leading to a different discussion altogether. 
---
I think we're definitely at a weird time in DbD's history. For so long the sentiment that has been pushed by the community is "LUL, rank doesn't matter, do whatever the fuck you want" Now we're seeing some of those same people go "Yea, rank still doesn't matter, but seriously BHVR, where are my pips though?"
---
It‚Äôs all on the link though and I just wanted to share my photoshop so I‚Äôm not doing anything wrong?
---
There is no map in the game larger than 128 meters.
---
Ok why on Earth would I play survivor alone when half the time the ppl u get as for ur team are out for themselves? Besides I usually only have one person I play with unless it's Friday then I have 2 for like 3hrs. Gtfo
---
And talk about boosted, I bet ur the type of person who played Insta/Tomb MM. That or likes to use Mori and Insta down perks every chance u get. 
---
I love the vomit queen. She is by far the most fun killer to play against. She has only managed to catch me a few times so far tho. I‚Äôm not having a hard time dodging her or her puke
---
THAT‚ÄôS BECAUSE YOU‚ÄôRE SUPPOSED TO APPLY IT DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD
---
People are complaining, yet before the update all I heard was the rank system was broken and didn't matter, now all of the sudden it's I cant pip up and I'm de-ranking. Thought it didnt matter?
---
Damn thanks for gold kind stranger!
---
I say fuck it all, remove emblems/rank and just let the community have at it. Tired of each new patch breaking shit, maybe removing some *excess* features will help.
---
Is this a shitpost?
---
She does have speed punishment when charging vomit. 
---
It‚Äôs also quite easy to dodge it if you just loop a wall or crouch walk around objects. 
---
I usually get people who decide to stop and drop pallets. Especially when I have corrupt. They drop pallets, and run straight and I just down them from a distance. 
---
It‚Äôs all about learning, it‚Äôll get better.
---
Also Huntress.

---
Hope is so underrated
---
obviously she‚Äôs just well positioned for the bait into head on, clearly intended
---
Thanks!!!
---
Damn dude. I thought you were 12 from your other comments and this only cements my assumption. 
---
I actually enjoy using it now. I‚Äôm getting tunneled far far less. Stun seems fine to me. I have only died maybe three times since patch came out
---
I'm starting to feel it's right\~!
---
It‚Äôs a rage thread? Weirdo why do you care so much about me lol
---
Is this only PC or on Xbox/PS4 as well?
---
I dont but thanks for assuming. I actually play alone because I dont need people to help me get to rank 1. You have quite the ego though. Goodluck with that. Bye now :)
---
I go make a sandwich, maybe watch some youtube on my fon... let them waste their own time.
---
I figured something wasn't registering with the brutality, also I think if it spread it should be 500. I mean hag get 550 for smacking who triggered her trap. Billy get like 850? I think for a chainsaw. Heck even spirit gets 250 for just using her phase lol
---
"all in the link" - link doesnt even credit the artist
---
Lol at least link the official piece, not a fucking review about the nurse
---
And yea you are doing something wrong, you just changed the lighting and called it a day and didnt even bother to properly credit the artist
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/5243/nurse-painting-the-wailing-bride
---
Ok? So I‚Äôll remove it if is that bad 
---
Because she has a ranged attack that is a channeled aoe. Without that benefit from the fountains it would be insanely broken
---
Please do
---
HAPPY CAKE DAY!
---
People became anorexic because of Barbie dolls...
---
Alright you're just ignoring everything and attempting to compare two completely different perks. 
---
It's been real man. 
---
Huntress has one projectile that once thrown does not change direction, and is limited to 5 before having to search a locker, AND slows down to charge it, *AND* makes an audio queue to let you know she‚Äôs throwing it. This is comparable to an automatic machine gun with hatchets. 
---
Looping is pointless because if she‚Äôs in your line of sight you‚Äôre getting puked on, regardless if you‚Äôre next to a pile of rocks, pallet, barrels, whatever because she‚Äôs 8 feet tall and pukes over it for 4 seconds. 
---
What speed punishment? lol okay she goes from faster than you to just as fast as you.
---
Interestingly enough I had this happen while spectating a friend after I had died. His perspective was still him on the hook, but my spectate was the killer and it took me a moment to realize what was even going on.
---
I agree with you. I've been up and down on rank 2 and 3 because i play alot, not because I'm good! I don't even know everything in the game yet - and i do not belong there. Now after the update im rank 7, and first now im starting to have games where i don't loose any pips or even gain one. I love the new pip-thingy! I can finally feel like im doing stuff again. 
---
Agreed. Really solid and pairs wonderfully with both Adrenaline and Poised. 
---
Just have care how you speak. As someone who *is* significantly overweight, it concerns me when 12 stone sticks call themselves "fat"
---
The level of shitpost on this is out of the stratosphere and leaving our galaxy.

---
Oof, someone‚Äôs mad
---
I don‚Äôt teabag but I do wait at the door so the killer can get one last hit for points
---
Are there rewards for ranks yet? I just stopped caring about rank at all and the game became so much more fun :D (killer main)
---
Their fragile egos can't handle it. Also I'm not a great player but I'm still going up in ranks. I can only imagine how sweaty the red ranks will be with people who "don't care about ranks" trying to stay there, send help. 
---
At this point, they should just unlock the Rank achievements/trophies for everyone who was playing before April 1st, then get rid of Ranks entirely.
---
They do nothing but frustrate people  and make matchmaking hell. I haven't logged in a long time, I'd hate to see the damage rank resets did to my account.
---
Two wrongs don't make a right. DS was still garbage.
---
I can get behind that.
---
Yeah, kinda. Most bad survivors were carried there either by "immersion", or by their friends, and when they decided to play solo they were in way over their heads. Ranking up as killer was admittedly pretty easy, so bad killers could just "patrol" their way to the top and punish every save attempt. I don't think they stayed there for long, though. Most high rank killers I faced were pretty competent. 
---
I really don't mind them upping the difficulty of ranking, it's a great idea, but they went way overboard. A few bad players at rank 1 is much better for the game than most good players below rank 8
---
I'll be honest? I kinda love it when that happens. I won't assume you were BM'ing or anything, but when people do and they underestimate me... it yields some very just desserts. 
---
Then there's also the pig if someone has an that trap they need to get it off before they can escape a timer when the gates open would be so much worse for the game
---
Exactly.  It punishes you for playing to win and promotes you just doing as much as possible at the expense of escaping or letting your teammates get points.
---
Yes. They tried and failed at, "fun" with Legion. They certainly got it right with Vommy Mommy.
---
It doesn‚Äôt work for any of the people I play with either. It‚Äôs always been an inconsistent perk but never this badly before. 
---
right?! Pips should be a reward for high skill play, not for long time playing.
---
Yeah but 5 of those causes exhausted status so it's useless to use more than one unless use them wisely. Which alot of times ppl panic and don't really think lol
---
Man... This made me think... 3rd person on killer would be sick. They should make shadowborn have 3rd person effect instead of fov.
---
They didn‚Äôt buff ruin idiot, they changed it so at lvl 1 and 2 it‚Äôs still useful, lvl 3 is still the same as it was, and dev hope needed a buff, especially at lvl 1, and decisive strike wasn‚Äôt good for the game the way it was, yes it‚Äôs not the best perk right now, but it still punishes tunneling and makes killers avoid tunneling the person off a hook. They can buff stun time or what ever, but it‚Äôs still a good change, and it ain‚Äôt killer sided, killers are still weaker than survivors, and games are still based on survivor skill rather than killers being bad. Smh. No I‚Äôm not a killer main, I play both, stop having a sook you entitled survivor main.
---
Literally can‚Äôt relate the game is hell for survivors on Xbox 
---
It‚Äôs not even just decisive. 
---
I‚Äôve been playing against guys way higher than me. The plague is so easy to play, there‚Äôs deadass no counter play. Plus the DCs and High pings are crazy 
---
Oh so the kiler can tunnel you? Thanks bit no thanks!
---
Why did someone dislike your comment wtf
---
Have you actually used the new DS against Enduring though? The stun is currently nonexistent. It has absolutely no effect on tunneling, there‚Äôs no second chance or revenge. You‚Äôre going right back down.
---
Just confirming my own assumptions, I would rather ‚Äúown‚Äù a 12 year old fairly and hopefully pass on some knowledge than ‚Äúown‚Äù a disabled 20 year old. It‚Äôs good to know where you stand, you know?
---
I said the same thing and got down voted to hell.
---
I‚Äôve been on a hunt to thank whoever thought of the pig crouch speed buff.
---
If it‚Äôs you, thanks
---
Exactly! It's not fun when you can never outrun a killer because you're a fucking potato (I really am), when the killer had been playing for years and you started last month. I'm having more fun now! But again, i don't care about ranks (in this game), i just wanna have fun
---
I WANNA PLAY THIS GAME ON MY IPAD
---
Lol so we‚Äôre just gonna say two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right and just leave NOED? Like cmon that‚Äôs hella one sided. 
---
You should have received a message in your inbox where you can thank them directly. 
---
You‚Äôre still a weirdo trying to own a 12 year old okayyyy Go back to your Apex :) Zero kill games calling your name!
---
Why seinfield tho
---
Had this happen on ps4, also invisible skillchecks, and people instahealing from a fountain after being downed. Fix 1 thing break 100
---
No, I'll admit I haven't, nor have I yet to actually get D-Striked, period. 
---
My thing is I do care about ranks, I wanna be the best if I can, but a pip system that rewards dedication rather than skill ruins any sense of accomplishment I can get from that. I was really happy when I first got to rank one, but I quickly realized that wasn't as great an achievement as I thought
---
I don't think I ever called them toxic, I said that people who run those perks in stacks make it annoying to be the killer.
---
WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK IS THIS MATCH MAKING SYSTEM. IVE NEVER HAD THIS FUCKING PROBLEM BEFORE. I PLAY ON PS4 AND ITS 3 OUR OF 4 GAMES IM MATCHED WITH 3 OTHER PLAYERS THAT ARE RANK 1-5 AND/OR A KILLER THAN IS ALSO ONE OF THOSE GOD DAMN RANKS. NEVER HAD THAT DAMN PROBLEM BEFORE BUT MY RANK 13 ASS RARELY PLAYS THIS FUCKING GAME AND IM TRIED OF GOD DAMN RANK 3 LEATHER FACES KILLING MY ASS. 
---
Isn't that what we say every single time? Lol 
---
Ooof
---
I love this and now I really want another Sunny meme template. Specifically Dennis in his car with cereal.
---
I think a slow insta kill shotgun killer would be a good idea
---
Yeah this is on ps4 too. Although I didnt see any of the other stuff thankfully lol
---
