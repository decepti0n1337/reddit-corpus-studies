I had hope that we might get Englund freddy for the rework, but if they wernt going to do it then, it might not happen. But we didn't think we would get any changes to any licenses for a long time so things can change.
---
Choke me daddy Myers
---
This was aggravating to watch.
---
Idk man Kate, Jane and Feng are definitely what I’d get
---
He’s not based on a movie but rather a real life fucko. His name is Yang Yongxin
---
Oh god no the Dwight one
---
I think we all need that Michael one...
---
Thank you this helped a bunch :)
---
in the original when freddy was alive he killed the children of people who had wronged him in his life, when his wife found out about it he killed her in front of his daughter, but because his arrest was unlawful he was let go. Then the parents of elm street burned down his boiler room, where he worked in a power plant, where he made a contract with 3 dream demons that let him reside in the dream world and take revenge, where he then started killing the children of the elm street parents that took matters into their own hands.
---

---
in the reboot he works as a preschool gardener, where he's just a pedophile, and when he's let go and the parents burn him alive, he hunts the kids who told on him, which is a lame motivation for a killer- it really has no reason to exist
---
If you like legion you might like heathers
---
Thank you very much. This reddit comunity is so  good, unfortunately the game one isn't the same sometimes
---
Tis' true.

Here's a link to a video that shows the pig doing a dash attack and not losing and stacks of STBFL.

Good fuckin luck ya yellow starburst.
---
You ever just wish you can unread something
---
I might replace noed with Mad Grip, since they'
---
re probably gonna see the noed coming too and you already have the chainsaw
---
Baseball bats are portable pallets. Shotguns and flares are yeetable pallets.
---
This is how Spirit mains see Spirit, I think.
---
U can try DBD discord there is a surprising ammount of girls there (maybe 20% of players).
---
Idc what the game says
---
You totally hit that skill check
---
People love legion now, dw. Only the people still dcing against this killer are the dummies
---
*notices the myers one*
---
Thank you so much! I definitely put a little extra love into Meg because she's my main. xD
---
Because I enjoying playing solo more. Also, that's how people get your IP and DDOS your Xbox. However, If I do decide to play SWF, it will be with friends and not some random players.
---
Wow Ace and Dwight being bisexual like that. We stab.
---
Updated pictures! She won judges choice! http://imgur.com/gallery/yas6rYI
---
One of the best insults I’ve seen
---
No problem, remember that better survivors will expect that eventually so experiment and see what works!

So does good ol behaviour just not know what an offensive action is lmfao. Why would they ever do this , im a killer main but all i can think about is sonic cosplay piggeys now
---
I think it's okay, especially since they certainly have an aspect of parody to them. If I get a C&amp;D, though, I would definitely stop selling them!
---
That's dumb, that shit is basically her being a fast pig and hitting people with her M1 weapon. So dumb.
---
I seriously cant tell if this is just hilarious or actually upsetting.
---
Um, if you haven’t been hooked and your the only person they can find that’s not tunneling
---
"Well, i mean we have these fake pallets that would be cool to have alongside them but you need to gimp yourself to use them by removeing pretty much all your powers chase potential in exchange for a gimiky ability that is 100% reliant on the survivors and also wastes an addon slot."
---
Nothing gets me wetter than an e-boy cuck who probably is just doing this to see if his lonely, basement dwelling, hot pocket snorting, cheeto crusted ass can get a girl who is too dumb for her own good.
---
That’s an oof on his perfect game
---
[removed]
---
I was halfway through writing a comment saying how much of a prick you were then saw the last bit of the video. You had me in the first half...
---
I bought the fucking game and only played like once lol woulda played more had I know of all the goddamn eye candy. 
---
Probably gonna cop tho cause buttcheeks.
---
Had a feng drop 6 pallets early in a chase and tbag at each one, didnt end well for her
---
Yea, I only got out because Ace sacrificed himself, so I got to open the gate.
---
Killed all survivors, survivors only needed 3 gens to go, mind games. What is not to love?
---
Thanks, bud
---
Yeah probably. I don't remember exactly how many of them I've jammed but probably even more. I forgot one of them in a map corner smh
---
"New" lol
---
I don't normally tunnel or camp (because guess what I try to be fair because I started as a survivor main and couldn't understand why killers wouldn't stop camping and tunneling) but sometimes I just get left with no choice
---
Actually it Has a notification aside from the noise. The gen shakes on its position when an explosion is prevented. Although i’m not sure that visual cues is only for yourself or not.
---
i do it if its a baby dweet
---
Congratulations you can 360 with an analog stick you are very skilled at juking killers with really bad fps.
---
A perfect game is 32k bps, you got a full iridescent
---
Genuinely, how much for the Myers one, I don't mind paying for shipping
---
Is that the only one?
---
I don't care. Full iridescent is still a perfect game for me.
---
Thank you.
---
"Aha Aha haaaaaaa"
---
Source the video op.
---
Sorry forgot the /s
---
which killer are free exclusives for each platform?
---
I believe so, but stack it with a pudding, and any BPS if the survivors burned some, and suddenly you’re rich
---
Yeah, sabotaging hooks all game is gonna get you camped lol. Dont BM if you dont want BM in return
---
*ash mains have ascended*
---
I don't even get the no-tunneling rule. If I'm injured after being taken off the hook and the killer wants to chase me and knock me down again - go for it. No reason not to tbh.
---
Not my fault that you or they are bad🙄 it’s okay that your bad but you don’t have to whine on my post about it.
---
Meanwhile im here at purple ranks getting dead ass rank 20 SWF groups 💀💀 full of baby dweets how fun
---
You speak different wit a Mori
---
Snares are much better since they dont slow freddy down and can be placed premptively. Clown has limmited bottles and is slowed when throwing them meaning he cant cake an entire infinfinate with them in chase. Freddy can not only do that but also do it out of chase to get an effect faster, due to this he can make safe dropped pallets unsafe if atleast one side is playable if the survivor doesnt loop as he can trap the safe side, forceing the survivor to repeatedly vault the pallet.
---
I think the world needed to see some Dwight booty!
---
You're welcome!
---
You think this is a game?!
---
I'm not whining and I don't personally think I'm bad either it's just very egotistical of you to make a 360 juke montage just to show others your "better" than them. Please next time make a more constructive reply and we can have a friendly argument.
---
I'm canadian but I live in the usa
---
It all seems good I just feel David could use something else instead of 100% bp boost since he already has a farming perk
---
There are a lot of hooks in the game, sabotaging them is one of the most efficient way to survive. Mine was a method to manage to survive, his was totally unnecessary since the gate were opened. The others were all alive, he could have gone searching someone else instead of camping me
---
What a little twat. As killer I'm quite happy to get a 2K, 2 moris is even better because they can be challenging to get
---
Spirit booty where it at
---
All I’m sayin is one tbag shouldn’t result in getting tunneled the whole game which is what happens half the time
---
The most efficient way to survive is actually to not to be hit by the killer, fun fact
---
*hides in locker...* n- no ma'am
---
I was fine being left on the hook to die as long as they did gens, but
---
Here we are
---
They're $20 each + shipping, and can be purchased from rorydiesalot.com. You could also win one from my Twitch stream, but they are very rare prizes. Did just give away a Jane one, though!
---
Maybe body blocker Hag but even then that’s not a lot of punishment. Even scarred hand with bonus duration but you don’t run body block without the shoe. 
---
Plus Spirit and Nurse aren’t real killers. They don’t play the normal game.
---
Hi-hat intesifies.
---
The scores are shown rounded up, but are not actually rounded up when it calculates your score. It may appear to add up to 100%, but in actuality you were just a fraction below 100%.
---
I'm a P3 legion main, are you proud?
---
Terrifying!
---
Yeah but 9 times out of 10 you can just hit  them if they mess it up. The snares are useless
---
Oh, you're not living until you've played Jane in her lounge-y beach outfit. *_*
---
yeh
---
*cries in Huntress/Pig main*
---
It's very likely that since I use a monitor it makes the blinks easier, but I'm not entirely sure of its effects.
---
Fun fact. If I stay quite far from the basement and there are no hooks he has no chances to hook me somewhere else, I'll end up escaping in case he chases me after that I'll do it again.
---
If you like Spirit, you probably like [dick](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0144168/)
---
On PC yes.
---
Holy shit
---
It pisses people off, and understandably so. You know exactly where the survivor is and if you're good enough and created a deadzone around the hook it's a free down
---
I love that cheeky wave.
---
This happened when I was playing killer a few times and I felt so bad for the survivors.
---
Hey so how do I delete someone else's post?
---
Ah yes, relying on a crutch rather than actually getting good at running, classic big brain survivor move
---
I'm the Meg who was healing everyone, I told her to go hide and heal.

It's because of r o u n d i n g. It means you were somewhere between 99.5% and 99.9%. It's not a bug.

---
Also no need to be pretentious, I didn’t expect BHVR to be so incompetent that they’d round scores up yet not the total.
---
yeah she was definitely inspired by the asian ghost girl movie trope
---
And I’ve had this bug when I hit 101% before
---
We have a schedule now with 4 new chapters every year (following a trend of a lot of games that add content every season). Back when Leatherface came out, we didn't have a schedule, and BHVR felt it better to maintain the "One map, one killer, one survivor per chapter" formula.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
We'll never know for sure why Ghost Face is his own chapter (the timing just fit, and it could have been that BHVR was planning on obtaining the rights to the movie franchise as well as just the mask. When Ghost Face was leaked, he had a perk called Simple Formula which was a direct reference to the first movie. Obviously that never actually came to pass). Since BHVR partnered with Netflix for the Stranger Things chapter, it's possible they always wanted two survivors for the ST chapter and planned this from the start (doesn't explain why Ghost Face didn't come with a map though)
---
Short answer: \*shrugs\*
---
Don't forget that there's a weekly No Stupid Questions thread on this sub, to limit the amount of question posts in the New feed. It can be hard to find sometimes, since mods only seem to pin it for like a day, but a simple search should bring it up &lt;3

omg frank is literally exactly like jd i cant believe i didnt think of that. thanks!

Not me...all the swf counselors couldnt fuck with my Jason. Of you teleport in the right spots at the right time, you can shut down any loop in 1 second.

Never seen this posted before.

Oh bite me. I got plenty of blood points from that as well.
---
Toxic STRODE comes out the closet every once in awhile to wreck havoc on shithead killers or shithead survivors, when it’s been a shithead night! I have my Purge fun then back to normal the next day! Plus I feel better and actually have fun...
---
I mean... I feel like a thanks friend or something like that is more than enough. It was an act of kindness but if you expect someone to give you something back for it it wasnt exactly selfless.
---
I don't even play as killer and I'd have to buy that skin
---
Love it
---
Ah, I see. Thanks for the info, The Only Person Who Has Ever Run Tinkerer.
---
I was going to buy this game on PC but the queue times have me worried. I play on Xbox where the game is free and even then it takes 10 mins.
---
Rounding makes them incompetent? Lmao. If you didn't hit 100% you didn't hit 100%. It just makes it easier to round each individual aspect of the score.
---
Yes, because yuo shuold know yuore exact score. It’s an 18 we all know basic math.
---
Then your opinion is different to all of ours but not wrong. Just vastly different. You enjoy what I deem weird, more for you.

How? Legion is a group of kids with masks stabbing people. Scream is a single serial killer, albeit a meme-y one, and has his own movie.

If you don't bing bong then don't play Wraith. You must ALWAYS bing the bong.
---
Lul true
---
As I've said, they must accept it because they cannot do anything to prevent it, it is impossible without killing the game. 
---
This is from their FAQ: We do not have voice chat in our game as we feel this would ruin the survivor experience. However, you are able to use certain gestures in order to communicate with other players.
---
They literally think voice chat between survivors ruin the survivor experience.
---
I generally agree with what you're trying to say but maybe not how you're saying it. Maybe I have a different definition of toxic, but in my opinion those strategies are annoying. They piss me off and I get mad because I feel I got outplayed. Maybe the killer only gets me because they camo and tunnel and everyone else escapes, but I still feel cheated. The issue I have is that this is not toxic, or rude or unsportsmanlike. It's just annoying. Survivors will teabag and flashlight spam and killers will camp and tunnel. That's the nature of the game. Like playing a shooter and getting mad that someone is camping a room and keeps killing me, I may not have many options to deal with it, and it sucks, but it's not toxic. IMO the toxicity comes from AFTER the match. Regardless of how someone played, when people are rude or demeaning or whatever for whatever reason. Telling people how to play or that they suck or to get good. Those are the issues that are most prevalent to me in this community. They are exasperated by how many options people have to play this game. There is a lot of freedom and with that freedom of choice comes the freedom to play like an ass, but I don't think that's toxic IMO and I don't believe the game needs to change because of it. I think first and foremost a change needs to be made by the developers on how they deal with harrassment of messages or rude chat after the match, or the players to decide to stop acting that way. You and I both know the latter won't happen haha. I'm sorry I rambled so long. Again I understand where you're coming from, I play both sides too, mainly survivor these days, but I think there's an important distinction to be made about what is really "toxic".
---
Stop it, you're scaring him!
---
2k is a depip with a genrush. Imagine killing two survivors thinking that'd mean something just to derank.
---
I agree. I think her power (and other stealth type mechanics) are what the game really should be at its heart. It's like living a jump scare horror movie, and most people I see actually enjoy being genuinely scared, if only for a moment.
---
&gt;Sure, but this is completely reliant on skill and how you play.
---
Yhea but there are cases where you will die because your found first, ect. 
---
&gt;“blueprint” but still get 50K+ bp without add ons.
---
Everyone follows a version of the blueprint. It's still the blueprint even if you changed it severely. 
---
&gt;Still doesn’t make up for long queues and the ability to quickly get in and out of matches with a good amount of blood points.
---
Honestly this really isn't a problem and it does not make sense to me. The pool of survivors is smaller. It's just there are less players in general and Killers have been nerfed that it may appear as so.  There are so many people that have a problem playing killer due to the broken meta such as: https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1696043806569567881/
---
Learn maps, it's the most crucial aspect, you should always have somewhere in the back of your mind that you're going to head to next once you've expended all the time you can at a specific spot. Say you run a t-wall for as many vaults as you can manage, and use up the pallet there, you move on to the next nearby area with fresh vaults and pallets. Part of the goal of being chased isnt only just surviving, but wasting the killer's time. Run in circles as many times as you can and try stick to areas with pallets, even if you dont throw them down, you can still mind game killers with them and buy extra time. If you can spot good looping areas, have an escape plan in place while looping one area before moving to the next, you're going to make it that much more difficult to catch you and that much more difficult to stop other survivors from doing gens. If my teammates are doing gens, theyll be pretty much done by the time I've gone through 3-4 of my little loop areas. A good killer wont chase a good survivor for that long though, theyll break off to put pressure on others instead of wasting the time, it's easier to catch survivors when they fuck up versus when they're in the groove of a chase
---
Fuck it fine it's not a perfect game. Why can't I celebrate this victory for once?
---
Thanks for you input, now it most definitely looks like a ping problem. Hopefully it will go away with the next chapter and dedicated servers :)
---
I have legit been saying since day one no mither should start healed and then be broken and it also shouldn't tell the killer tbh  just the survivors like how we can see the plague progress bar anymore
---
It’s just the new way to passively tell people you’re a psychopathic pedophile murderer.
---
Opposite opinion on WGLF: I personally hate this perk and don't think it's equivalent to BBQ at all. First, it's functionally a dead perk slot during the game while BBQ is actually useful for more than bloodpoints. Newer players really need every perk advantage they can get. Second, it encourages bad play. You either rush for unhooks (instead of waiting for the right moment) or you take protection hits, which for most people means just walking in front of the killer and giving him a free hit while he's carrying someone for no gain to your team.
---
Finally, WGLF is something you actively have to focus on during your play to max out (cause many games you're not going to get 4 unhooks/protection hits yourself) whereas BBQ is pretty much always going to be maxed unless you have a really bad game or someone dcs before first hook.
---
That's unbelievably lucky timing - basically the client updated the host with the insta heal info after the host registered the hit to dying state. The window of time for this to happen is unbelievably small.
---
I’m just... correcting you? There’s gamer vernacular in this sub, you go ahead and celebrate your win, I’m just wanting you to use the correct terms, jeez
---
Ty
---
It's a weird bug, but it's happened to me before. I hit an injured survivor, they used an InstaHeal. The timing of my hit downing them and them using the InstaHeal cancelled out the dying stated. Game ignores the dying state instead of ignoring the heal. Doubt it's on their immediate fix list since it's something that rarely happens
---
Good luck man 👍 practice makes perfect, the more you're chased the better you get at running
---
Pretty sure you get banned for that.
---
But what’s your rank?
---
I only use "genrushing" to describe teams that are quite clearly trying to end the game as fast as possible. A team with all toolboxes, Brand New Parts, and Prove Thyself is most certainly genrushing. But gens just being done fast isn't genrushing. That's just the gens being done way too fast.
---
There's definitely a fine line between the game being poorly balanced and people specifically going out of their way to exploit the poor balance / be toxic. Yes if a Killer is specifically going out of their way to chase one person that's tunnelling, but a Killer going for the injured Survivor isn't.
---
everytime i see one of these "funny moments montages" i just think about ochido, most of these honestly look like you got them within 5 games of rank 15 survivor/killer
---
Wait since when is it free on Xbox?
---
It’s not I was on PC
---
Meg looks like a pig
---
Only way most of the survivors can get to red ranks. I've always said Red Rank SWF are really just Green Rank solo survivors.
---
You’re thinking of play with your food, m80
---
Maybe it's wishful thinking, but I think of most of the survivors as gay. &gt;_&gt;
---
"new killer idea" pog
---
As someone who’s been playing DBD rank 1 killer for 2 years it’s like that except without the ranking system to *try* to save you from getting butt rammed

Mate are you having a stroke?
---
I did that once when I played on my friends Xbox account. She was laughing at how butthurt they all were
---
Its honestly not even fun playing against those people because half of the time they are toxic as hell. Just today i ran into more red swf and all of them just t bagged in front of me and after some time it honestly gets annoying
---
Sometimes when it's quiet and I'm lost in thought, I find myself poking and squooshing the mouse pads. So, y'know, there's an option if you're looking for one.
---
back in my day you could blind the killers ears. Now most dwight players think you can blind the back of there head.
---
well thats why its better to Sabotage it to 99% and just destroy it when the Killer carries a Survivor close

I want Meg's sweaty feet in my face after she came home from a 5gen Chase.

You round down when it makes more sense to. In this case, it provides better information to round down then it would to round up. Actually, they *could* just round up the actual score as well to avoid confusion.

True, weakest killer in the game and only one made it out lmao

Fredster
---
Its not a weak change. There are 4 perks instead of 2 which greatly increases your chances of getting a perk you actually want. You’re underestimating thechange
---
They never expect you to accept death
---
IDK why you and u/Dante8411 are being downvoted because I honestly agree with you. This game isn't competitive and whoever says it is is only fooling themselves. The game breaks down fundamentally when you know how to exploit all the kinks in the core coding, which is further compounded by highly coordinated SWFs.
---
I don't think they can just *remove* SWF. I don't think they can ever remove it, nor do I think that every player should be punished just because a few exploit the system. But I do really think there should be more of an indicator that a team *is* playing SWF and more of a reward for a Killer to play against that team. (Even if it's just 10% more Bloodpoints per person in a SWF.) The fact of the matter is that SWF *is* stronger than playing against randos, even if it just boils down to "hey no one's coming to save me can you unhook me?" The mere existence of communication is a huge boost.
---
I do appreciate your attempt to fix technician and it does look like a better perk overall, but I’m a feng main  so I always find technician underwhelming compared to her other teachable perks.(lithe is decent for gaining distance at the end of a loop and alert is good for information gathering) 
---
It does look better and more effective overall though!
---
I can get mad at them for abusing bad balance but I'm more mad at the devs yes.
---
Which is why I said most. I've come across very good red rank solos. But it's very rare.
---
You mean a depip
---
people are so scary to take a hit but they also lack altruism. idc about dying so I’ll take a risk getting someone down even if it’s final hook.
---
Mate I'm sure at least %80 of my DbD time is playing in a SWF of at least 3 people with voice chat, although it's mostly joking around in there we don't really take advantage of the voice communication aspect. I don't hate on people who voice chat, I don't even think most of the SWF teams I face when I play killer is all that daunting really. 
---
However, it is VERY clear from every design choice in the game that voice chat is not intended; there is no chat in the game while there is one in the lobby, there are emotes specifically designed to be your mode of communication. They have specifically told us that it is NOT a part of the survivor experience. 
---
It is a necessary evil for the game, you cannot and should not remove SWF because people naturally want to play a game with their friends, and you cannot stop people from using voice chat to coordinate, but the game's core design is clearly not intended to be played with voice chat.

I would imagine they'd like to keep pallets easily recognizeable especially from a distance.

Is it just me, or do others pretend to ding dong the bell to get people closer

It doesn't look like I'm downvoted to me. I think people just think that I'm some guy who only plays killer and salty against SWFs but in fact I spend most of my DbD time playing SWF with at least a party of 3.
---
Now THIS is what I call memeing!

Congratulations :), you'll start dreading high ranks soon though, it's full of moris,a specific set of killers, swf, insta heals, keys, iridescent heads, prayer beads and long queue times
---
That Michael one. I am swooning 😭😍😍🤤
---
I can see how it's all set up this way, but as I've said before, the devs are cool with it, they do keep it in mind. While it may not be ideal for the type of game it is, getting upset at people who do it, and calling it an exploit is too far. Saying it's unfortunate i could agree with, but exploiting is just about a synonym for cheating, which swf is far from considering it has the go ahead from the devs
---
Nah.
---
As long as it doesn't affect gameplay.

Since everyone has a Dream Timer you can see at all times it's legit.
---
You can also change the profile pics without ban since it doesn't affect gameplay.
---
STOP NERFING HER
---
Maybe am inverted borrowed time or say every ~30 seconds he can see the killers and the survivor closest to the killers Aurora for 2-3 seconds
---
I think they mean you always went back to the hook whenever one got saved (and i Guess you went for the unhooker) definitively not tunneling but ill admit its annoying whenever a killer does It to me
---
Oh god please stop
---
Actually, I use minimizing words to make you feel small. If I wanted to feel good about myself I'd just do something fun, like everyone else. Shit talking you is just my way of letting you know I think you're a jackass. 
---
Not sure where the stigma that all arguments come from people suffering IRL, but if that's your way of projecting yourself onto others, I won't stop you. You clearly got some shit you're going through since you're ready to lash out at every single person on the internet despite being unequivocally in the wrong.
---
Okay, now give me one for left behind
---
I have no idea what you'd make the killer out to be for this chapter. How do you make solid the literal incarnation of death itself?
---
I’m XB1 and play a lot of ghostface so I thought maybe it had been me
---
Went through 5 blood webs for the offering but couldn’t find it and ended up on the Yamoaka Estate, it definitely wasn’t in my favor lmao
---
Been playing for over a year lmao
---
We have no way of knowing if that is even true or how you played. From what you posted, they are saying you tunneled them off the hook. The EVERYONE means, you did it to all of them. I didn't get S I M U L T A N E O U S L Y from that chat. 
---
You have to question why someone would go out of their way to even post something like this in the first place. Seriously why even do it? Just take a deep breath and move on to the next game.
---
I wonder how many people saved their Gruesome Gateau offerings for that extra 3% for the bloodhunt. 
---
I know I did :)
---
Whatever floats your boat brother, I don't mean to chat shit about SWF players as I'm also a SWF player myself. I just think it's not really fair to use voice chat in order to shit on killers.
---
Welcome to rust.
---
i wana rub the congealed blood from her p1 top into her pussy flaps and eat em mmm
---
lick it like im a dog
---
STOP CHASING US! IF YOU SEE US YOU SHOULD JUST TURN THE OTHER WAY!
---
Scream is actually several killers in the movies always 2 at a time and several groups over time
---
This post right here, officer.
---
Its possible , ive done It  once, however It requieres so much timing or lag for It to happen that its never really a Big problem
---
That's kinda tough because legion doesn't have traps or insta down. I would say mad grit for the body blocking buttttt I don't know what I would take off to put it in there. Maybe instead of agitation because you can move quick when hitting with mad grit . Let us know what you come up with.
---
I don't see anything wrong with that
---
because the entire log was actually about 60 more messages from the entire 4 stack SWF. All of them telling me to kill myself and saying they hope I get in a car accident and shit lmao. I'm not upset, I think you're overestimating the amount of time it takes to make a reddit post of a screenshot.
---
Idk. Killers take like 10 min to get into a games and it just seems to throw whoever it can into lobbies.
---
People who kobe have big balls
---
They're not very smart creatures
---
I said I wouldn’t cry
---
ah, refreshing to see cool killers ^ - ^
---
You could use the Huntress perk that shows them as they go in the basement and put yourself in between the basement and where you think they will come from. That way (with insidious) you can catch wannabe survivors before they get there and if your wrong see them when they get there.
---
Wtf Meg is my sister
---
I was a big technician fan when Feng first came out. I appreciate that you only made it slightly better than what it is. 50% at Tier 3 isn't good enough for what it does.  
---
As for No Mither--- I STRONGLY AGREE that it should have a built in Iron Will, and the additional bloodpoints is a nice touch.
---
Im proud to say ive hit rank 1 multiple times solo then
---
If this don’t blow up
---
I only play as survivor (I’ve literally only played as killer once) so I’m not able to give as good advice as killer mains, but I would HIGHLY recommend you use hex ruin in all your games. The survivors seemed to have “gen rushed” a bit. Even though you ended up winning, in the future this perk could help you prevent this.
---
I personally HATE it when killers use hex ruin. Why? Because 90% of survivors can’t function when it’s used. They either gen tap or spend most of the game looking for the totem. Hex ruin can buy you a lot of time in the beginning of the game. Even if they end up cleansing the totem in the first minute of the game, you have bought yourself a lot of time (which killers desperately need.) 
---
Good luck
---
How are dedicated servers gonna be able to make them see exactly why someone left? Unless you have to type in a reason when you disconnect BHVR is going to be just as clueless about possible reasons as they are now
---
I'm not overestinating anything. I fully understand what it takes to post on reddit. 
---
The question is why take the time to even do it and when you do ... why show the part that makes you look bad.
---
Obviously you need to stop tunneling 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
I was not expecting to see Crash Maul in this sub, yet here we are.
---
That means mettle of man still doesn’t f’ing work that good
---
No just leave MoM the way it is that's just old mom
---
It helps against ruin/huntress lullaby. But yeah, once you get good with skill checks it's a dead perk. :(
---
she tell me al about how mch of a loser u r wile she lick my toes
---
Expect more of those even on already ingame Killers when the patch drops
---
Maybe just go with a slug build, Nurse's and Deerstalker, Moniter and Abuse.
---
Offensive actions consume PWYF tokens, so all methods of damage lose PWYF stacks. Missing any method of damage also counts towards losing PWYF stacks.
---
It’s funny when you do a little BM back, they get mad and call you toxic like ???
---
Oh god the last Guy didnt even get 1k bp :(
---
I'm at university, moving in with my SO soon and have an amazing family life at home so I'm doing wonderful, actually :)
---
Maybe I'm being a dick, but did it ever occur to you that some people are dicks just to be dicks? Maybe I just don't like the way you come off and I want to let you know you're a jackass too. I bet that thought didn't travel through your skull, "kid". (Notice how I call the person I'm arguing a child because I am unoriginal and have no personality of my own, and assume that everyone who disagrees with me must be younger, and hence, more immature than me!)
---
The outrage may never die... and karma I guess
---
Yep. On nurse/billy/Bubba/any killer without a red addon, if you own all the dlc, you won’t get splinters, and will get an Ebony Mori almost every single bloodweb. I play Billy as killer, and have a large pile I use for annoying SWF
---
Y'all need that dbd gone wild for this post 🤦‍♀️
---
When you die and have more points than people who escape!!   
---
**That. Is. The. Saltiest. Feeling.**
---
Bruh
---
No. It should.
---
If you're toxic, you should fully expect toxicity back, and with extreme prejudice. If you want to taunt the killer, you should expect them to act in turn.
---
I mean survivors literally have to do gens to accomplish anything. In the majority of games before rank 8 or so, killers absolutely do not have to camp or tunnel early to win. The complaint is not with winning, it's preventing someone from playing.
---
Classic
---
I believe three perks show up in blood webs from 40-49 (you can buy two) and four perks once you get to level 50 (again, buy two).
---
This is why Jesus won't come back
---
1% survivors healed? How even?
---
It’s against the rules, I had a post like this removed yesterday
---
...that's why you don't miss? lol
---
Aaand you're stripped away from your profanity-filled oneliners
---
The Plague has dialogue. Admittedly, limited to her mori in game, but still.
---
Please read the rules before posting.
---
You sound like ppl looking for girlfirends or boyfirends on animal crossing lmao
---
Wouldn't be the first survivor only since I guess they didn't want to give us some cool demon alongside ash
---
Drake the type of survivor that would miss DS, because he know how much it hurts.
---
Extra chromosome unlocked!
---
Dem shorts are comfy
---
I’m a rank 1 and I keep getting matched with 20-15 ranked players every other game
---
The Fred Man
---
In reference to the movie, the queen of England is real, so therefore it will be coming. Big brain
---
And here I am, years after the video was uploaded, waiting for the rematch.
---
Have you done it?
---
Hey, stop using nurses, noed, ruin and play with your food. It’s toxic, now let me use balanced, ds, urban and deadhard. Hehe git gud scrub
---
As a killer and surv main was MoM really that bad? Inata downs and certin killers like billy/ bubba made it extremely hard to get the required three stacks and ntm it required you to go out of your way to get hit by the killer. Please dont take this as mr being an asshole, this is just my opinion lmao
---
I hit one chainsaw that whole game. And that person was the only one I hooked. They found ruin in 30 seconds and gen rushed me.
---
Alright well I definitely am getting one of these
---
Me and my Spanish-speaking amigos give overly Spanishized name to a lot of fictional characters. I think we called Freddy "Alfredo Krugiente."
---
^(It's not a real surname. Just Spanish for crunchy but with a K.)
---
Alright I'm sorry. Got overly excited and a bit egotistical.
---
I would LOVE Wendy Christensen from 3 as a survivor, especially since she kind of gets a prestige outfit by the end of the film with that final train scene scream.
---
Some random concepts:
---
We Have To Get Off: if you are working on a generator whose aura gets revealed to the killer for any reason, you get a notification
---
Read The Signs: auras of killer belongings  and traps within x meters are revealed to you for y seconds when you stand still for 4/3/2 seconds
---
Intervene: you don't leave scratch marks or disturb crows within x meters of a hooked survivor. Once per match, when you rescue a survivor from a hook, the noise notification and status change will be delayed by 1/1/2 seconds
---
Other good FD perks are maybe Alert, Bond/Aftercare, This Is Not Happening?
---
✌
---
Thank you so much and goodluck to you aswel 😃
---
Assuming I'm American is a very American thing for you to do.
---
I have asthma so I relate to her on a spiritual level
---
It was actually closer to 87 because I usually keep 30k in the bank.
---
Dope.
---
What are survivors supposed to do if no one is hooked and there's no hexes active?
---
If I was Bubba, I would have went to the basement and hide in the corner lol
---
She talks in the lobby as well, to my knowledge.
---
And then there’s the one rank 5
---
It's up to you, really. Personally I just put my points in to the characters I enjoyed playing first, and then once I had enough add ons and offerings to last me a while, I went and put points in to others for perks. I only really play 3 killers unless I have a daily, so it wasn't a terrible grind.
---
both are the obj. abusing loops and face camping are not. they waste time for both sides.  
---
note: face camping when the gates are open is somewhat acceptable.
---
No problem. Also I noticed you’re actually a pretty new player. I just wanted to say that some survivors are a bit mean or rude sometimes. Try not to take it personally. Take a break if you need it. Just try to have fun.
---
Also, remember that it’s not camping if literally every survivor is around the hooked person waiting for the save. You’re not obligated to leave. And it’s not tunneling if you go for the person that is already injured. It’s the survivor’s responsibility to make sure that you aren’t around when they are unhooking someone. 
---
Trust me, this will come up a lot.
---
I’m sure the new chapter will inject some life into it
---
That’s the exact same issue that plagued the series, that’s way too cartoony. There needs to be a balance between his horror and comedic aspects. 
---
The best kill they could use from the original series is probably just recreating Glen’s death from the original. When the survivor is on the ground, have an arm reach up and pull them into the depths of hell followed by a geyser of blood shooting up.
---
If you get bullied by flashlights and 2nd chance perks you 100% deserve it
---
Noed on Billy, really?
---
F
---
Wait until double BP comes for this Stranger Things release.. then run extra BP sacrifices and perks. Wasn't uncommon for me to get an upwards of 100K per game.
---
Legions theme is literally rock...

---
No we understand but you guys don't seem to understand that these "jokes" are not funny and are fucking stupid.
---
It was bad for M1 killers because it punished them because for doing their job. My main killer is trapper and MoM was basically “o you were good enough to hit me? To bad this chase isn’t over even though you couldn’t prevent it and had no counter play to it at all” MoM needs to be buffed but reverting it to the original form would make it frustrating again
---
So true bro.
---
Man, having to aim so high up to get survivors down with the sickness. Reminds me of Halo 2.
---
Fashion Icon: You can switch between 4 (up to 6 with addons) bodies around the map, with a cooldown of 20 seconds (can be reduced with addons).
---
When changing bodies you become still while it charges ( 3 seconds) , but when the switch is done, any survivor near a 5 meter radius is revealed for 3 seconds
---
Thanks!
---
And every time she misses an M1.
---
Rank 16s be like
---
Seeing as you're not playing on console it should be easy enough to get them. If you have trouble, try upping your sensitivity
---
We're the Killers now bitch.
---
Lol as someone who uses WGLF I can agree with this statement, protections hits are like stupid, they are so inconsistent it’s ridiculous
---
Wtf are they doing to her now??
---
WAH AH! WAH AH!
---
The endgame changed everything. Even if it's just having the gates open and not one on one. It wasn't well thought out properly and needs to be addressed. It's far from perfect and this is one of the many problems with it.  Maybe reserve it for both gates when there is more then one survivor alive. 
---
With that being said, I've rarely played against a Pig on any platform that doesn't camp or tunnel the trap.
---
haha 12btw
---
Naw fam a lot of us Slasher fans loved the corny Jason and Freddy. I think at this point there’s more of us who like Dream Warriors and it’s ilk more than Nightmare 1, 2 and the remake.
---
That's cool! She sounds like a bitch to play against.
---
My friend does this... Whenever he does it when I'm on my way to save him, I just let him die.
---
Haven’t they ended that choice, though? Any time I have a DC it force quits the match.
---
also, nice name. ;)
---
'Gen Rushed' 😉jk
---
Rank 2 Nurse in a double digit survivor game with an ebony mori, what could possibly be the outcome
---
I mean not every killer wants to farm?
---
Me: ok i took a hit for survivor while they are in a chase abd stopped them from being downed, this should count as a protection hit right?
---
Entity:no
---
Dream Warriors is never categorized with the corny kill you’re talking about (which is from Freddy’s Dead). 
---
I have to completely disagree with that first statement. The “corny Freddy” you’re referring to is from Dream Master, Dream Child and Freddy’s Dead, the latter of which are almost *universally* hated amongst the fan base. You may like it, which is fine, but majority of Freddy fans (check any sub or forum) hate those last two movies. 
---
I personally don’t mind Dream Child. But that’s besides the point. Dream Warriors features the Freddy I’m referring to: the balance between comedic and horror. That is peak Freddy.
---
Complain about NOED in post-game chat :^)
---
Gen rushing is when all the Survivors focus on gens instead of unhooking their allies or doing totems.
---
Tunnelling is when a Killer only chases one Survivor and ignores all the other Survivors.
---
Dude he was hella corny in dream warriors. That’s literally “WELCOME TO PRIME TIME, BITCH”.
---

---
I really like these perks. The ability should be that you can transform into a variety of monsters or other killers.
---
The bad survivors would be dead
---
Neither does DbD. Not that "females" need to be pretty to be put in a game.
---
Welp time to invest money into bara tiddie mikey then
---
Oh I see. Thanks
---
I think technician preventing explosions is no bueno.  Reducing the sound or reducing the amount of regression when you blow up a gen is fine.  But removing the most important penalty for goofing a gen skillcheck is bad - perks should give you the opportunity to benefit from good play, not make it easier to faceroll.
---
usually only survivors that cant loop/avoid feel like they get tunneled
---
I always thought that add ons would unequip if you had only one remaining
---
He's due for a rework. Maybe he can switch between his chainsaw and mallet.
---
Tunnelling is a viable strategy.
---
Although I love widowmaker and her story, I actually named her after Christian Lacroix, a french designer
---
Toxic
---
i've been hooked by her sexy since day 1
---
some do it, I never do it and never expect anyone to.
---
Its honestly just the Killers choice
---
So plenty of mannequins scattered around the map? Sounds creepy as hell, i like it
---
Like anyone's going to follow that lol. I only follow rules made by the devs and I'm pretty that handbook was made by a salty surv who doesn't know how to stay in his lane
---
I got her on day one but I just didn’t pay attention to her until I got bored with everyone else
---
Well hitboxes are broken in general but saying killer is easy I can tell you've never played killer before for long amounts of time( I play both sides) and killers have it rough if they don't run meta perks.
---
The only monster I liked from downpour were the mannequins, and I felt them being underused and badly executed.
---
it does, until you learn to use it ;)
---
And all of them keep twitching while being idle.
---
I am really excited for the PTB dispite the fact that I am a only PS4 player. It really helps with knowing details and I always love learning about killers.
---
Surprisingly, they're probably the least annoying enemy in the game.
---
It can be annoying but impossible?  No,  I and many others hit ruin checks every time almost.  Not really hard even on console
---
would really appreciate that
---
We’re talking about Robert Fucking Englund Freddy. He DOESN’T fit. Neither does Ash.They are both from horror franchise that embraced their corniness, which a lot of fans love. 
---
Like ffs dude Ashe literally has Mini Ash. which was a gag, as his hand. And if Ghost face was the scream version he would fit THE LEAST. 
---
Really Ash and Robert Freddy only fit together. Hell they fit so well together they literally did a crossover. They are actually extremely immersion breaking, especially since this is Ash that literally went to the dark ages and did “This is my BOOMSTICK” crap.
---
Lol I agree if it’s a perk then obviously you can use it
---
2 of these are a mistake
---
Yeah, Konami F'ed up the series, at least PT was a great dissing letter from Kojima.
---
No you cant.
---
Take my upvote
---
Nope I've fucked people through windows with chainsaws. It's a mix of "fuck im sorry" and "HAHAHAHA THAT GOT HIM?"
---
Because pig was just blowing the doors off everyone,amirite? lol
---
Why in the world would they keep nerfing one of the lowest rung killers in the game?
---
It's nonsense.
---
(Yes,i know this was last patch. I'm still salty.)
---
The build I have been requesting for so long is spreading
---
Were you a Dwight?
---
Also, Amelie is from the same named movie, Amelie.
---
I don't think anyone sees PT as that. If anything, Kojima's more likely to diss the players. Especially people who think video games can be art.
---
But that's neither here nor there. My point is: This reminds me of Scarlet and Konami is trash.
---
Anytime this happens I wonder how... it’s never games I do anything special
---
How do you get the Entity to take like 5 nodes from you at once? I know getting a perk ASAP summons it, but I want it to eat more.
---
You have the maturity of an 11 year old, also censor the names this post is against the rules
---
Just buy the Darkness Among Us DLC and you can play him whenever you want.
---
What a twist. What a twisty twist.
---
Why does having ttv cause it to mean nothing?
---
I play both, just survivor a little more and both have happened to me, both are equally frustrating but I never have cussed up a storm at being gen rushed. 
---
99.5 of the time If i see a stupid survivor unhook someone right infront of me, ill go for the one that wasnt hooked. Just how i play.
---
99.5 time ill show respect to the killer and wont teabag pallets and be toxic but that .5 percent i happen to do it when i get hyped i accept being tunneled and camped. 
---
I just use Ruin and DS and hope for the best.
---
Ooh, now I kind of want to draw a bootylicious Tapp mouse pad, where he's in the police officer uniform...
---
Funnily enough, I'm going through something similar
---
But the killer will tell either way. If you go down in one hit, then they could most likely tell you have no mother and just not pick you up wither way.
---
Oh you mean how most people play online games cool
---
Haha, I'm glad. xD Comments like this are why I make these!
---
Oh... Oh! Oh. Okay!
---
Ah, I dunno, I think those are pretty fun! I'm sorry you don't like them.
---
Good to know! I'll work on her this week. &lt;3
---
OP said it's Ace in a Chase, but I really wanted it to be Mace on and Ace
---
It's kinda a thing where ppl hate on who ever puts ttv at the end of their name.
---
Unlucky avoiding/bad avoiding may be true, but if you run the killer around for most of the round and you are the only one being hooked it's kind of not the lack of ability.
---
Imagine using noed then acting like you deserved the win or are good.
---
I don't see the point in hating on it though, it's just another way of putting your name out there
---
\&gt;Brings NOED
---
\&gt;Complains about SWF
---
Checks out
---
Bro it’s better than anything I could do
---
bro 😎💪
---
The way I see you unbelievable t to d when your hook someone walk across the map when they get unhooked to kill them
---
thx
---
healing someone + Botany gives you an even faster heal. My whole point was that healing buffs as a whole are weaker when used with self care than when they are used with standard healing.
---
I know exactly what you mean, and it's the dumbest logic in the world. The biggest asset in this game is time management for both killers and survivors. The more time you're wasting overall as survivors not doing gens, which includes healing and traveling the better it is for the killer.
---
16 seconds wasted is better than 32 seconds wasted, when it comes to healing in particular, you are vulnerable for a smaller period of time. When it comes to doing other actions, getting back to them sooner rather than later is better because you never know when the killer will come, if the killer comes 20 seconds later, good thing your teammate already healed you, oh wait no you're barely 2/3rds healed and are fucked. The time lost on a gen of 16 seconds is easily made up if the 2 survivors hop on it.
---
Then you can start taking into account various buffs survivors have such as Prove Thyself, Toolboxes, Medkits, We'll Make it, Pharmacy, Adrenaline, etc. and those trump Self Care even more. As for your comment on Leader, the best thing is if you're the one running it, YOU get the benefit of the faster heal, you're basically giving anyone who heals you a free Botany Knowledge. Literally look at the 2 new perks coming out for Steve and Nancy, 2 really good self heal perks that will make Self Care even MORE obsolete. If you want to heal yourself so badly literally just bringing a solid Medkit is enough, and if you have to dedicate a perk slot to it, Medkit + Botany Knowledge is even better.
---
There's literally millions of options to boost healing, making it faster or more efficient, yet you want to pick like the worst one and say it's meta for some reason.
---
Survivors are now doing gens efficiently
---
🧂
---
O K A Y
---
Trying to be a twitch streamer yet you post this?  You never clarified how they were toxic either.  Not to mention those ranks are kinda low, and the game is killer sided in low ranks.  If there was context, maybe all of us shaking our heads would understand.  And also don't say toxic perks, because that doesn't make a player toxic.
---
It's the same when playing killer and you get all 4 stacks. Even if they all get away you'll most likely still walk away with 50k to 60k+ points while they maybe get 20k~ or so.
---
Didn’t want no beef with no Bloods
---
Aww, thank you so much for the gold! I'm glad you like the Feng. I'm not in love with how that one turned out, so it makes me feel better to know that Feng is getting some love from someone!
---
Perfect
---
I had noed equipped but unused
---
They definitely do not get every advantage over survivors because they need to run meta perks  and play nurse, hillbilly,spirit to win consistently also. every other killer either gets looped to Oblivion or can win loops easily but has bad map pressure and you gotta hope they don't know how to run loops decently or get a map that isn't survivor sided. Playing killer is definitely more difficult then survivor
---
I have offensive and I find this asthma
---
Still makes you feel cheated out
---
(Technician)
---
It sucks because green ranks are full of killers that are not so good so they camp or use spirit to get to red ranks because they think it matter. Then you get into red ranks and all the survivors only care about getting out themselves and not temawork.
---
Not small. I’m newish and I’ve been yelled at by survivors for picking Susie. I’ve also had some make fun of me for being Ghost Face. Hell even in the DBD discord I’ve come across A-Holes. It was when I was just starting and wanted to play the Wraith. And they offered to help me pick perks. They picked perks that made me weaker to light. Then grabbed OP flash lights. It left such a bad taste in my mouth that I didn’t play again till Ghost Face and Legion were released and only with long time friends.
---
Poor huntress could finally get some goddamn shoes!
---
They look nice but not worth the risk of getting banned imo.
---
I believe they're making it so her ambush doesn't count as a "normal hit" anymore, meaning it won't work with sloppy butcher, the third seal, haunted grounds myc and stuff like that :(
---
This was creative.
---
Surge and Cruel Confinement literally do both of those.
---
I've learned if u rant like this or post any salt on here ppl will just troll u sooo might wanna refrain from that my dude. But anyway, just give it time. It's not much better as survivor tbh, I've had so many games the last couple weeks where I've gotten rank 20-17 survivors and not helping do anything
---
its all about your pathing tydetime made a great explanation on it on youtube
---
By no means an expert as I'm only rank 10ish in killer. But here is what I picked up.
---
Hug the corner of the loop tightly. Survivors might turn a corner a bit wide which let's you gain critical ground before they can tip a pallet.
---
Learn your lunge range as best you can. The better you know this the sooner you can swing to catch them. In my experience, lunging when their at the tip of your range discourages them from hiking you as they expect you to get closer.
---
Change direction. If your playing ring around the Rosie with a rock, stop and go the other way around the rock. Survivor might react a slower then you allowing you to gain ground.
---
Know the unsafe and the safe pallets. A safe pallet should be broken as soon as its tiped. No way around it.
---
Unsafe pallets can be mind gamed if the survivor stays. What the survivor will try is to fast vault to one aid rod the pallet as you approach, then fast vault again when you to the other side. Don't commit to either side until the survivor vaults to early allowing you lunge and slap them.
---
Moonwalk best ya can. If a survivor is looping you aroumd a spot that breaks sightline, stop walk backwards around the loop and quickly turn around. If the survivor falls for it they'll bump right into you. This doesn't work if they see you do it though so keep that in mind.
---
Get out of here with your logic

Entity Displeased. Faithless Killer.
---
Well she was already useless but now she’s officially just an M1 head trap killer.
---
That is seriously the best feeling.
---
A demon who kills you in horrific ways during your dreams and is even more powerful with the entity is chasing you and about to murder you once again.
---
*A WILD PLANK OF WOOD APPEARS*
---
Freddy - "DARN"
---
If it happens, you can only escape through the hatch
---
If I have a DC early on I’ll let the last one go. 2 DC’s I usually let both of them go and farm a little
---
Hmmm... Makes me wonder what perks would be "lore accurate" for each killer/survivor aside from their own, because sometimes teachables can be thematically off or generic.
---
Ghostface, Dwight, PC
---
Hilarious. The killer was a good sport to play along. This video made my day, haha.
---
I guess people really don't like Freddy. I myself don't really like him all the much but I'm not gonna just dc like that......(unless it's Legion, he's just annoying).
---
she's dead after nerfs I think
---
Just had a Plague game (I'm rank 10, have barely played since rank reset) where the survivors were all solo queue and were rank 17, rank 14, rank 4, and rank 6.  Just... come on man, surely the matchmaking can do better than this.
---
crazy idea here: Gen pressure.  
---
hes an idiot for staying on the hook self caring let alone miss skill checks, sure.   
---
BUUUUT gen pressure is key.  i couldnt give a flying fuck about whats happening on the hooks tbh, specially early game when there is so much gen progression everywhere, after i get my hooks done, imma make sure gen progression is slowed down as much as i possibly can. if by any chance someone off the hook just do a stupid thing like that on my way i will drop them and let  them be. i wont win if i dont get them to play the  game at my pace. if you pressure hooks instead of gens you will def not be dictating the games pace, survivors will. and we all know what survivors do when they set the pace :)
---
It literally only affects the odds of escaping off the hook. The devs talk about it in one of their older streams. It’s on YouTube
---
wtf bhvr made me a survivor perk
---
Actually it's more in their neck. And on Freddy's fedora.
---
Boil Over, Breakdown, Deliverance, and Saboteur. This is the "f*ck the meat hooks" build.
---
What do you mean? You were correct without audio.
---
Anni Cake is only 103%, you should have gotten 60621... Does Anni Cake apply *after* BBQ??
---
Traps were never meant to actually get the kill, they are at their core meant to slow the game down, by threatening the player with death if they don’t act, if they do actively try to get the trap off they won’t die but will waste time. I agree tho pig needs some love
---
The more I think about it it's probably true. Who cares now, just another game of dbd where something didn't go as planned :D
---
I remember watching this movie recently. I love it. However I don't think Ive ever had this happen to me.
---
Well rage quitting should be looked down on.
---
There have been plenty official statements, you're just not looking in the right place.
---
That is equally bad correct.
---
true :D
---
Indeed it is
---
How do I get friends like this?? Where are all the cool people like this what do you guys play on?!
---
I just think it was bland. Hence why I like Cassie
---
Yeaahh. Just a “little bit”
---
Ya I can usually tell minutes after loading in, but it’s too late then cuz whatever i picked is underwhelming against SWF (but they all coordinated to fight 1 killer). I always ask post game and sometimes I get an answer, a lot of times I just get a gg ez or other insults. 
---
Still would be nice to know for sure though.
---
Xbox. And I met them all just randomly online. We play a few times a week, various games. We're like best friends.
---
Pretty sure Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Nurse, and Huntress are the only free ones, and are free on every platform
---
The thing is that there's not a sound queue unlike hag, you will be on edge waiting if one of these things starts to move. 
---
Also, the thing is that you position them strategically so you cover most of the map or important objectives like generators or the entrances.
---
Bvhr is trying to do away with perks that reward failure, they nerfed is decisive, add used the same reasoning for mettle of am, now they just need to realize that noed does exactly what they don’t like.
---
I think this is all fair enough, I think you're limiting yourself a lot, and i personally would hate to stop facing nurses and spirits, but it sounds like you're not an asshole about any of it. 
---
I personally like it all, even the broken iridescents (so long as they don't start showing up super often in games, but it seems fine so far), they all spice the game up and i love the challenge of mind gaming against spirit and nurse. I use everything and i fully expect others to use everything too, the game is much funner to me this way AND i become a better player because of it.
---
but back to the main point, my only issue is people being assholes to others for using in game items as intended, idc what you think is unbalanced, don't be an asshole for as intended game play
---
Please stop god why
---
His interpretation of the meme is that killers are hunting an excuse to tunnel or camp despite survivors crying for them not to.
---
In reality, the meme is in response to the hypocrisy and blatant control issues survivors have when it comes to playing against killers.
---
No, you can't use Noed.
---
No, you can't stay by the hook even if you see us all there.
---
No, you can't play the game out normally if a teammate DC's. You have to farm.
---
I could go on and on and on and on, but the meme is saying how stupid survivors sound when they say this stuff. The comment that got downvoted was downvoted for thinking killers hate being told not to tunnel.
---
Thanks :)
---
Had a wraith chasing me for 6-7 minutes 3 gens popped in this time alone, I smacked 6 pallets into him and he still went after me, after some time he got me and hooked me and he chased someone else, I got unhooked and what happened he came back the whole way just to kill me. I ran and at some point idgaf so I stopped and let him hook me. Gens were finished, he had noed and got no one else. After the game I wrote him that he was salty because he threw the entire match just to kill me and his reaction was basically: no you?. After that I made fun of him for not leaving me after the first 3 pallets and he wrote: you wasted every pallet.
---
This was the funniest game ever
---
Follow the official DBD Mobile Twitter account for updates and info. I'm on iOS and I downloaded the game by temporarily changing my account region to Sweden. About 2 days ago the beta was officially released in Australia and it seamlessly transitioned regions without me having to do anything!
---
ugh toxic SFW are the worst, it's bad enough when one is toxic, but when they're all screaming idiotic shit at you at the end, EVEN WHEN YOU LOSE, it's shitty. I really wish BHVR did anything about toxicity
---
I just spent the last 4 games dealing with atleast 1 or 2 rank 5-2's in swf. I'm rank 13.
---
I'm so glad! xD
---
Seriously you’re my hero. I must have one.
---
i cleanse all 5 totems with or without noed everygame and i garantee you will still say you got gen rushed if you play against my swf.
---
Yep, it's ridiculous.
---
"Camping and tunneling is a strategy!"
---
Yeah, killer mains? Well looping you while my team powers through gens with green toolboxes is also a strategy, so deal with it.
---
There's also a lot of whining posts about survivor perks. If survivors get one decent perk added, killers want it nerfed. I know DS and MOM had their issues, but I just can't take anyone seriously who cries about these things, while at the same time using iri heads, belt, infinite ew3, and ebony moris.
---
Both sides have pretty big imbalances if that side kits themselves out. I don't know why killer mains are so adamant that survivors are the only ones guilty of this.
---
Can you imagine the outrage if we whined about BBQ, to the same degree as they did over MOM?
---
I should also say I play both survivor and killer. The killer mains who say a certain perk or survivors looping are a problem just aren't very bright, and can't use their brain in the game. Mind gaming loops is straightforward. And like I said, killers have tonnes of OP tools to wipe the floor with survivors.
---
But they keep whining, and whining, and whining, despite killer never been easier to play.
---
The only reward is max queue times.
---
Even the score screen hides your rank 1 from others. It shows a rank 2.
---
I honestly feel like plague is a little too strong. You either stay injured. Or give her insta downs. Pick your poison. She’s really underrated but she’s so insanely hard to counter against a good plague player
---
&gt;(assuming they stop forcing us to connect to their servers before removing support)
---
That's what I meant by this line :3
---
Hate to tell you but keys aren’t broken, the hatch doesn’t spawn until later in the game.
---
110% of Survivors movement speed. Most killers (including Pig) are at 115%. Hag and Huntress are at 110% due to their other abilities that aid in chase.  Also Nurse is at.. 95% if I recall correctly.
---
T1 Myers is completely immune to any and all detection. Spine Chill works even on stealth killers, but Michael even trumps that.
---
That being said, I would not be surprised if they gave him the Undetectable status in T1 in patch 3.0.2.
---
\*throws ash and misses, thus killing ash\*
---
Well... dbd as a whole is an unfinished game lol. But yeah I get what you're saying. It somewhat makes sense to do that but the feedback during a beta test is what they should be trying to gather instead of "here's a sneak peek at a game we're working on." For a small population of people on the planet. I've been a beta tester for a lot of unfinished games back when playstation let you sign up for the closed beta program on ps3. Some of the games you had to preorder before they let you in but most of the others you got an email with a code to put into the playstation store for.
---
Doing basic objectives can be above and beyond what some random groups are willing to accomplish.
---
So survivors can put run nurse if she doesn’t use her ability?
---
Mori me daddy
---
Most swf
---
If I'm remembering correctly, yes. It's part of why Nurse often feels useless in the hands of a brand new player.   
---
Also, she actually increases her speed while carrying survivors. This wasn't always the case. Iron grip/Agitation used to be pretty much mandatory to keep survivors from wiggling free.
---
Wtf is wrong with you
---
Great. Everything else is still expensive.
---
Man, I've known so many people who have stopped playing this game due to the constant DCs. Absolutely ridiculous that there is still no meaningful punishment for it.
---
Matchmaking is God awful and feels horrible when you go against survivors at a better rank than you
---
That being said, it doesn't matter that they all had DS. It's a valid perk against tunneling. It's not OP like it used to be
---
Because there isn't info on it. You wait
---
Alternatively, Ash and the trash
---
I thought this was a shit post since you just admitted to doing the most toxic thing you can do as a survivor. Sabotage is just a massive waste of time. It annoys the fuck out of the killer, and if you managed to do it 6 times, you wasted the fuck out of your teammates' time. You could've just been doing gens amd helping the team.
---
And since the killer caught you with gates open, the camp is kind of warranted. There's nothing left for them to do except get the one kill.
---
Insidious on wraith lol
---
I don’t think the huntress knew they were there. So saying the huntress had no reason to leave is kinda not true. Yes no gens were being worked on. But the huntress doesn’t know that.
---
Right click someone and they basically get the exposed status effect with annoying coughing that not even iron will counters. Plus they can’t go in lockers or else the locker glows green with puke. Yeah she good
---
People are already calling like half the survivor's perks OP, simply because they don't seem dogshit or meme tier.
---
Every rank reset is this scene for a good 10 games
---
oh no
---
She completely counters all stealth perks. She’s insanely good. Whenever I play her I win. No ruin required. She’s probably the best m1 killer in my opinion
---
oh wow i had no clue she cant see you when she phases o.o
---
If they want to make me mad, they've already succeeded. I admit that I get really angry at it really easily, and it usually ruins my enjoyment of the match.
---
I might as well try to ruin their experience in turn.
---
Just wish everyone would quit using him to camp! You have a really good 100% stealth killer and these lazy shits gotta camp with him and oh the other teammates know that your camping because of kindred! 
---
Sorry but on PS4 I’ve had maybe a handful of Ghostfaces who actually played the game and it was fun, I died and lived. The rest of them have left a bad taste in my mouth and anytime I see one in the game I’m like great, here we go again...
---
This is the best solution. Can you learn to enjoy the salt? Kill ‘em with kindness. Sometimes it’s more fun than even the game.
---
Can’t take the salt? Block all messages, block all invites, don’t look back. Take solace in the fact that they’re trying to spam you messages and wasting their time.
---
I played Clown excessively for a bit, but eventually got a little bored of him (mostly cuz I played survivor 60 percent of the time). He is really good at shutting down loops. People say Freddy does that with his dream snares (and I do love Freddy), but I find it harder to see scratch marks and even hear survivors as Freddy. Also, as for Huntress there's definitely a skill gap when it comes to her because of her 110 movement speed. I always have trouble hitting hatchets over obstacles at loops.
---
Get it now the sooner you get it and prestige the more chance it’ll have to pop up in blood web and also remember to get all the perks you see in bloodweb that way they won’t pop up again
---
Shes an amazing area control killer. A good Hag is able to put large areas of the map on lockdown. This can extend to the ENTIRE map if she has Mint rag. 
---
Her issue is kinda like Plagues. Her power is too easy to shut down.
---
\*MoriMeMyers1327 would like to speak with you\*
---
that one's expired
---
Pyro killer coming in chapter 14???
---
Oopsie-poopsie.
---
See? It's so underused, folks can't even remember what it's called.
---
But what if instead the killers won by giving my boi a snacc; what would happen afterwards. Essentially all would be physical then, even the ones who don’t have to exist (Freddy) chaos would reign after the expertise they had to put into killing? Only the human ones (Amanda, ghostface) would be planning it out tho.
---
Hol tf up would trapper, billy, wraith, doctor etc. be considered human? For some reason I see them as more sporadic than the others
---
There’s no harm to reveal that info post game though, right? Queue time is understandable, but  fairness is another. It took the devs long enough to hide killer perks until all survivors were out of the game.
---
This suggestion should just be a small QoL change for killers?
---
HAHAHA true enough!
---
Ive actually seen a few posts recently from people who are reading the 3.1 patchnotes as though they are the new ones.
---
Please read the rules before posting
---
On the bottom I skrrt skrrt
---
On the outside I start to hurt
---
Pig with the right add ons combined with tunneling is super good. Just I don't like tunneling
---
Its not really outsmarting, its more so, not touching your controller
---
I mean pros/cons wise. think about it, all you need to master are blinks, which is down to how long you need to hold , the longer you hold the further you'll blink.  THATS IT.  3hours of hard practising and it ll be engraved on your muscle memory , and you ll be killing higher skilled opposition, let alone with hundred of hours.. and jump ahead the hardest part of playing as killer, work around structures and tiles, deal with looping etc. as for predictions, that comes with experience , general sense of what players will do , that you will gain with every other killer on different situations, predictions is just general gamesense. Hillbilly, Huntress, way way harder to master, let alone do well on the higher ranks.
---
Ya seriously LOL. I wouldn’t feel so bad if I knew for sure if I went VS SWF (even if they’re toxic), it’s the fact that I still don’t 200% know at the end of the game while getting called a bunch of things lol
---
I'm not sure what BHVR wants from me as a pig main, but lately I've been playing prayer bead spirit a lot more as a result.
---
This is one of the few I've seen on here that I wouldn't mind seeing. Great job.
---
As survivor, I am terrible against the Plague because I can't resist the urge to cleanse sometimes. Also it's pretty hard to avoid her vomit. 
---
I imagine it's easy to just ignore an area of the map as a hag and guard your totems and 3-4 specific gens that are generally close together.
---
Awwww thanks!!
---
I'm guessing you mean true fullscreen? 
---
This game only runs in borderless fullscreen mode always has, maybe some external program could force it (though I don't know, I'm doubtful) but every single guide and YouTube video I've ever seen has been complete nonsense. The "ini tweaks" are silly, don't and can not work, same with startup switches and "read only" somehow magically making them work... that's the most lol part. 
---
Read only simply means nothing is allowed to write to the file, so the only thing it actually does is just that one thing. Anything you are not allowed to change you can't, things that you're allowed to change, within preset parameters, you can. 
---
For example in GameUserSettings.ini the following lines you can change:
---
FrameRateLimit=
---
bUseVsync=
---
You can verify this by saving the file normally (no read-only). Fire up the game until you get to the main screen, quit game and open GameUserSettings.ini and you'll notice the changes you previously made will still be there, the game will not revert to it's default for those lines. 
---
If you try to change something you're not allowed to, or if you use a disallowed parameter then the game will automatically and immediately use it's preset default for that line and at the same time it will overwrite that line with the default in your GameUserSettings.ini. 
---
Setting read-only can and will only stop only the game from overwriting anything in the file, that's it. Your game can't be "forced" to use the settings in the ini by any method let alone by read-only. 
---
If you want proof copy your current GameUserSettings.ini  somewhere else as a backup, then open it and erase the contents completely and/or fill it with gibberish or whatever text you want. Set read-only,  save file. Fire up game and notice that it simply uses it's default settings for everything. 
---
Anyway, whatever issues you're having can likely be solved by undoing everything those guides said to do. 
---
If that doesn't work I'll be glad to help you figure out what problem you're having and how to properly solve it. Same goes if you are looking for actual fps boost without losing much if any quality.
---
He dash attack is definitely underrated for mind gaming at loops.
---
When you prestige you lose all perks and add ons you have for that character, so there'd be no point in getting Hex ruin and waiting for it to appear in the bloodweb if your plan is to prestige anyway.
---
most of the game (especially as survivor) is not touching the controller tho...or at least just holding down one button
---
I'm so excited for these to be finished! I absolutely love them. Thank you
---
Think of Vile Purge as no mither. You get used to it after time and if ur good it doesn't rly matter. 
---
Cleansing is worse tho. Bc Plague with Corrupt Purge is basically Leatherface and Huntress had a baby
---
People spamming subreddits like this is just as effortless as memes like this
---
Stay strong sister ... maybe one day.
---
... not dead enough.
---
And for some reason the killer is usually red rank so it comes down to me babysitting
---
Yeah, because thats a survivors job, to do gens, can’t really escape without doing gens can you?
---
I don’t take risks like that unless I see them nearby. Aka the only time I shut a hatch was just now when I didn’t know where the meg was
---
Yeah and killing is the Killer's job, they can find clever solutions and ways to do that and ways to outsmart and trick survivors. quit bein saltin bruh
---
Do you want the bloody prestige clothes? If you answered yes, then you should prestige. If you answered no, then do not prestige.
---
Well yea it is pretty underrated If you don't look at the fact of how glitchy it can be like Micheals whole arm going into his body or in some instances.micheal shoving that 8 inch blade into a female survivors vagina TWICE
---
To be honest man I think he was wondering where you were more than trying to screw you over. But yeah I hate that when you're altruistic generally no one returns the favour.
---
Clown it’s fun to throw the bottle at people when they try to jump through a window and you make them so that animation then smack em down they get real salty afterwards sometimes plus he’s just a goofy fella
---
Same here, people who play this game don’t make sense most the time. Had another killer Dc as we were exiting tonight and had 1 kill, but me, the wife and a random made it out, but killer did that weird abrupt stop When he could have hit us and DC as we were passing thru the exit and this was a rank 8 killer.
---
You wouldn’t have had time to escape via hatch even if they ran out right away
---
Jake and hag
---
\*Groovy\*
---
Yes especially if ruin goes down within the first minute
---
Wtf does those words mean? ;-; I’ve got most down except those two and one more
---
I cleanse if others cleanse since I'd rather deal with a ranged Leatherface with 2 health states than deal with a ranged Leatherface with 1 health state
---
The Myers one is a cursed object
---
But it sends a message
---
Why is your name Dwight is bad look at my name:|
---
I could never understand why Nea is always pictured as "Cute" or "Sexy" while at the same time everyone is complaining about Quentin
---
Like, is this some kind of Community Sarcastic Joke I dont understand? Have you looked at Nea Game-Model? She looks like fucking Gollum, the fuck, the one cosmetic with the White Mask makes her look like some kind of Meth Addict who is trying to quit and is suffering from Withdrawal. Compared to Nea, Quentin is the god damn Brad Pitt.
---
And I would love to see a Nea that doesnt look like a Face-Burn Victim, because I love the Clothes she has in her cosmetics, and I love the "Agile as a Cat" theme of hers, but I really cant stand playing her with that face (And a chunk of hair acting as if she had it glued to her headwear)
---
Every time I mory with Micheal it always glitches and shows me stabbing a leg or something else I rarely get the normal camera position. But its probably bc I use tombstone to mory  bc I'm toxic
---
Teach me your ways? Any tips?
---
See, I know that it used to not affect chests, but wiki says it does (wiki isn’t always accurate tho) and while looking for it I couldn’t find the accurate answer. Could someone send me the dev stream link with, if possible, a time stamp?
---
Oof what perks would he have lol
---
What made you think that you were using true fullscreen vs borderless at that time? Back before this game even released it mattered somewhat in certain games but now and especially with win10 borderless works flawlessly. 
---
Gsync works just fine in borderless, if you want to use it of course, I don't like Gsync myself especially in this game. I very much prefer having 100% rock solid FPS and frametimes with no stuttering at all (and this is using something reliable to test both such as RTSS, because steams FPS counter is absolute crap since it's averaged FPS and frametimes but it works i just tried using Gsync quickly to make sure it still worked and it did, and took no time at all to turn it on/off. 
---
What makes you think it's not working/What's the problem you're having?
---
Literally everyone
---
You can find the exact numbers and percentages at the wiki
---
Just getting 4 safe unhooks and a 1.5 gens done with Prove Thyself active will pump up 2 categories to almost full.  Get a few good chases with a killer, cleanse a few totems, and that will max out Boldness.  And that is 24k points right there.  If you run Deliverance, that is an extra 1.5k survival BP.  Add in a killer who gives you access to survival BP naturally (Plague/Freddy/Legion) and you can get around 2k or so of that even without selfcare.
---
Her lunge attack is throwing a tree, and her close is tbag
---
Great for keeping pressure on gens as long as you can get regular downs. Like BBQ if you can’t get hooks it’s a wasted slot.
---
When the last gen has poped, and the killer drops you, activates your adrenaline and strikes you back down
---
Become a nurse main
---
Make your own character for other less-used characters
---
Thank you kind Anon 😊
---
The entity filled the gap god's absence has created.
---
This character would be so cool if her map was just a bunch of mannequins that looked like her and she could just stand still and blend in and then a killer might casually walk past her and she’s like bam
---
I think it would be great but I would want them to take from the book. He wasn't a clown the whole time, he's a shape shifter. It would be neat if they used one of his other forms and gave him a reality altering power since he feeds off the fear of others
---
Pyro from Tf2????
---
Wraith, hands down. He's the black sheep of the killers.
---
my 2016 ps4 that I use basically everyday of my life literally sounds like its gonna blow up. buddy still treats me well. I dunno if I should buy a pro or if I should wait till next gens come out.
---
Nurse is 96 and a quarter because
---
That's right
---
He was definitely dumb man I agree with you lol. I've seen people teabag till the timer ends when they dont know where the other person still alive is, just to have them die waiting for hatch to open. It's stupid but people think that you have to teabag no matter what lol.
---
Old MoM was almost worthless against good killers and punished bad killers a lot. 
---
“It’s only one hit calm down”
---
But the killer faces 4 survivors. That’s 4 addictional hits that a wrait has to do.
---
The game can end in 3-5 minutes yet this perk alone, that wraith could nothing about unless you didn’t get unhooked, would add over a minute of chasing to the match. 
---
On top of that, those were hits that you thought would give you the down, fucking with not only your pressure, which wraith lacks, but you can’t even do stuff as you planned.
---
“Oh this injured guy tried to flashlight save, I’ll drop whoever I’m carrying on the floor, down them, slug them and hook the previous guy”
---
*MoM*
---
“Oh boi I got oUtPlAyEd, sucks to be me”
---
It’s mental how many free escapes it gave me when I was playing survivor.
---
I had an 87% escape rate during that patch.
---
I want this perk to stay dead. MoM was a mistake.
---
I've seen the same exact glitch right after I saved someone from the hook. It actually made me kinda scared at first lul
---
i do think I got angrier than i shouldve here but a fire just lit under me after seeing that
---
Actually, her map would be Lacroix's warehouse (in a different answer I give more details on her background). It wouldn't be exactly like her, but there would be a lot of discarded mannequins that look like her.
---
Only on killers who can get around the map quickly like Billy, Nurse and Freddy
---
This needs to be pinned. I just hope even 10% of the incoming tide sticks around.
---
Let's take it a bit further.  Other survivors bringing the Anti-Vaxx perk will become infected with any communicable diseases when within close proximity of another infected survivor rocking the Anti-Vaxx perk.
---
Red rank killers almost definitely won't give you the hatch, because they need to do everything they can to pip. Other than that it's up to the killer. There's absolutely no obligation to let a survivor escape, it's just a nice, generous thing that some killers will occasionally do.
---
DS has won me more games than I can count
---
Making the killer tunnel me is my objective 😶
---
No Mither would become every immersed Claudette's favourite perk.
---
I was gonna play Jake a lot, even bought a lot of his cosmetics.
---
Then they went and "Improved" (aka fucked over and removed) most of the hair physics, and I didn't wanna play Jake with Gelatin Hair that fucken stays in place and wiggles instead of that glorious mess he had before.  So, previous jake main :\
---
The Ghost with Bone Clapper/Cox Combed Clapper are his best add ons. ALWAYS try to sneak up to gens incase there is a survivor there. Unless you can trap a survivor, NEVER uncloack in their line of sight
---
One of these mouse pads are not like the others 🎶
---
If only I had a computer to justify buying one of these
---
Cool, glad you like it
---
And for people who can't play all day?

Why did i ever make a reddit account
---
Except traps are ONLY useless when the LAST gen is done. Activated traps still kill people trying to escape out the gate. Pig was unfair before this.
---
Noed + Unlucky Survivor + Trap = Death. Unless they could grab the Hatch, they are ALWAYS 100% dead, unless the Pig was dumb as hell

When you get the tier 3 one (purple) you can instantly down anyone once the door is open or powered I don't remember which.

---
What about green (while I level up my ghost face)
---
Door opened
---
Yes its fun when survivors run in a straight line so its easier for killers to catch them.
---
That first hit landing is outrageous lmao
---
Powered. NOED activates when all gens are done:
---
The others aren't as useful except for they show you where everyone is on the map.
---
admit it, its a wannabe funny moments. If you want to make montages then you make montages showcasing skill or showcasing funny moments that happen at higher ranks. The way you where looping, i would say you could prob get around rank 10 by yourself without a carry or a smurf on your team.
---
Ty and I’ll get to stab tomorrow because it’s the only thing I’m good at
---
NOED insta downs at all tiers. They buffed it awhile ago.
---
As soon as the last gen activates, you can insta down survivors.
---
eXpLOit.
---
Bet they were running self care and adrenaline lmao
---
Happy 5th cake day btw
---
Running self care, one was running deliverance, one DC'd because I hit them across the map with a hatchet
---
It was a joke tho haha, but still...
---
there shouldn't be multi directional hooking so there is no need of a "counterbalance" to it.
---
Do you realize what they had to do? They had to change the entire foundation of the game to get it to support dedicated servers - something they once said was IMPOSSIBLE
---
haha this couldn’t be more true
---
Pfft. What are YOU smoking?

---
I've only been playing about 2 weeks, and I've only bought Kreuger so far.  I was torn between Spirit, Pig, and Hag as my next buy.
---
The Plague has dialogue if you count her ancient language that she yells at you when she kills you, and also in the lobby.
---
BUT the DLC doesn't come out til a day after. So it could be the 18th

Probably farming
---
the term vacuum is used as a synonyme of i frame. You perform an action that make you invulnerable and uninterruptible. Survivor can be hurt and interrupted while vaulting.
---
If you get to 100% struggle while the killer start the hook animation it doesn't interrupt him.
---
Plus it gives us a general time frame for the DLC release
---
i assume the part where your wrist sits is lifted up with a cushion bc it looks like it is.

---
To add to what rororoxer said, the map is randomly generated but there are only so many preset "tiles". So if you become familiar with all of these presets, it will take you a lot less time to feel situated, and you'll have a quick sense of where the easy and difficult places on the map to chase are.
---
In terms of raw speed, nurse is faster than billy. Base blink speed is 333% or 13.33m/s while base chainsaw speed is 230%. No clue about spirits speed tbh but I would reckon she is third in speed too
---
ruin helps you learn when to try to hit the great skills checks. but even if it’s a good skill check just getting it is all that matters so you don’t blow generators the whole game. i wasn’t the greatest a skill checks either so my boyfriend helped me and put technician on my perks so it could make it easier on me and not i don’t even use it. i stopped using it like a month after i started playing. youll get better though just takes practice.
---
Wtf? You prestige a character you are dumb as HELL. And i'm sorry that you can't play one game and max out your character. I bet you play Skyrim with mods that start your character at 100 in everything
---
*screams in fear of the unknown*
---
I don't blame people for gen tapping if you have a mannequin right behind a gen spot.
---
You're evil. Great idea.
---
It was over in less than five minutes.  Total nightmare dude
---
Then there's no vacuum during the hook, because if a survivor enters the hook area at the right time, killer's hooking action will get canceled.
---
Bro I hope you don't feel bad about it. In one of my very first matches I had a swf group who all had purple toolboxes with BNP. They gen rushed the Fuck out of me and messaged me afterwards to bully me lol I didn't know what I was doing at the time. Otherwise I would have dodged that lobby😂
---
If I see you coming for me and you're honestly not that far and I can spare an attempt, I'll try to kobe just for the heck of it
---
You’re fast to assume things. Says a lot about you.
---
A useless one.
---
Shipping alone costs 125% of the item 😥 Cries in European. I'd pay 20 bucks for that Spirit in a heartbeat, but not 45 :(
---
so this survivor was expecting the killer to not use BBQ and Whispers? 2 really decent perks on 99% of killers? bruh.
---
Nah, not blindly running. Running and having to hide again.
---
Nice work man keep up the dedication! P.s I absolutely hate Freddy’s.
---
I haven't even touched the game for a while and I still feel the excess dissapointment in that survivor..
---
You sre literally arguing that you'd rather get 6 million (20 million if P3ing) rather the 3 million (10 million is P3ing).
---
This is the second dumbest argument i've ever been in
---
Yeah I have been sitting on 1m for a while now. Luckily, I haven’t been wanting to play dbd lately.
---
Lmao yeah man it hurts, they were teabagging at the exit gates and lopping me for miles.  Only got one hook that game :(
---
I’ve played for a few weeks and never had a game this bad before.
---
I don't see any mouse pads? just shirts &amp; mugs.
---
Twitch chat on announcement seemed like the reverse.
---
It's wonky as hell.
---
Sometimes it be a 1sec reveal or a 5 second. No telling with this game sometimes.
---
I think it’s quite fun to read the reasons people come up with to give me a -rep.
---
But like I said, they don’t want it done to themselves. Which is ironic.
---
what?
---
It's not bad. Took me awhile to like it but it's a nice game. Definitely recommend it
---
Ace all over the place
---
I play solo and can confirm rank don't matter. I get killers at all ranks regardless of my rank.
---
It really be like that sometimes. The important thing is to keep trying and not letting the toxic ones keep you from having fun and playing the game :) learn how to cut chases too. Sometimes I get so salty about what a player is doing that I let them let me chase them and bam two or three gens get done.
---
Yeah, this guy is right, just using the perks and playing with friends isn't toxic. This is where you'll have to complain to the devs, not the players
---
DBD isnt xbox one X enhanced meaning they run the same you'll just notice slight loading differences Microsoft literally provides the tools to make your game run better on Xbox One X. Dont know why BHVR wont use it.
---
since the gen wont progress for 2 seconds they do it so they wont catch another skillcheck they can fail. it also helps reset your mentality a bit
---
Honestly the T bagging is what kills me the most - JUST FUCKING LEAVE. Like I SWF and try and keeps ranks as close together. I will not and won’t be playing with anyone who t-bags. It’s a waste of time and just rude.
---
Had it happen the other way around b4 I was rank 5 I got rank 15-20 killer and 15-20 teamates they wouldn't crouch when unhooking vs hag long story short they died I got hatch
---
How is this remotely toxic?  They used meta perks, you used meta perks....I see one instaheal those are annoying but still not toxic.
---
Survivor: *tries playing game*
---
Killer: wow. toxic
---
Guys my internet is really bad and I can't access the links does it say when the bloodweb update will be released in the live build? Thanks!
---
4 flashlights is basically UBER Ruin.  So many survivors waste so much time trying to flashlight save and it's so easy to counter - just make a habit of turning around right before you pick someone up.  If someone is hiding to get the flashlight save they will hide in the direction you're facing.  Making a 180 right before you pick up makes it impossible for someone in that position to get the save.  Even if they're off to your side they still have to quickly move and then try to flashlight save.
---
So just to clarify, because I've been reading it exactly like that, but people keep arguing. So EVERY survivor on the gen, assuming it's a 4 person gen, gets +30% repair speed, right? So that's 4 x +30% repair speed.
---
well… that's the opposite that would require an explanation actually.
---
Why would you be able to hook from every side to begin with. Regarding balance or even "realism" i don't see the point.
---
Guys my internet is really bad and I can't access the links does it say when the bloodweb update will be released in the live build?
---
the killer can't be interrupted by wiggle or flashlight while hooking someone
---
Actually, I already thought of a power! check the other comments! ;)
---
What the other guy said. If you stay on the gen you aren’t making any progress whatsoever, but instead you can get caught with another skill check that (if you failed) would regress the gen even more. There’s literally no benefit of staying on the gen when it has that electrical fizzle, but there is a risk. Hence, people will stop repairing for a moment before continuing.
---
after landing a "good" skillcheck with the ruin, the gen can't get repaired for a moment. you can still get another skillcheck during that time tho.
---
people stand up to not risk getting a skillcheck while getting no progress
---
Killer got me with it a week or two ago and I couldn't be mad. Even had a nice chat with him
---
U will be a survivor or a killer, i frankly dont know which is worse
---
It’s not toxic. It’s like saying that killers that use NOED or hex ruin are toxic
---
Just break the survivor lmao
---
Guys will Franklin's work in dash attacks?
---
Pop works well on pretty much anyone.  A minute to kick a gen is a long time.
---
You can't post footage from Pikmin here, this is a Dead by Daylight community.
---
Yeah great perk, very strong on many loadouts and promotes a good playstyle of playing aggressively and pressuring gens.
---
Nurse Base Blink (13.33m/s or 333% Speed)

How do u get matched with a rank 4 when u rank 18
---
The survivor was an idiot the spirits skin shimmers while she’s phases so it’s easy to tell when she’s faking the phase walk.
---
My issue is twofold with that though, one it takes away viability from a more perks than it gives, and two, to even have STBFL you need to wait for shrine or spend real money.
---
Except gen rushing literally is their objective, i mean what the fuck else are they going to do? Unnecessarily loop the killer and teabag to piss em off or run around getting hit and healing? Fuck no we only have two objectives, Generators and totems, that's literally all we have to do, so instead of sitting there doing nothing how about we do WHAT WE ARE FUCKING SUPPOSED TO?
---
Tunneling is just a scummy strat shitty killers use to guarantee one or two kills at most unless you're at lower ranks, when they could be getting 4k's, which THAT is the goal for them.
---
I find that MOST tunneling does just that though. The entire issue with "tunneling" is that the killer is ignoring the entire rest of the map, risking the entire game, allowing gens to get done, just to fuck with one person.
---
When I started playing it was a CLEAR sign that the killer was a "baby killer" and the match was going to be easy. Maybe they'd get someone, but the game would be over quickly as they ignore the map.
---
These days, especially on this subreddit, it seems killers constantly act like it's a legit strat to ignore gens. It's wild. I see posts like this one, and comments that agree with it, way too often. These two things are not the same, and aren't used similarly at all.
---
"Gen rushing" makes way less sense in the way people use it. Unless people are running specific things to get gens down quick, you just didn't see them. There really isn't anything else for them to be doing. Maybe looking for totems? But only if it actually matters, or you think they'll have noed. In the mean time your only objective is to complete skillchecks on gens. What are they doing to "rush" the gens that makes it a thing?
---
I'll tell you what, not getting killed, lol.
---
Thought the killer would do it. They led me to the hatch and waited beside it for me to crawl over and then shut it in my face
---
That is infuriating
---
Bruh that’s sick, I can just imagine her bending all forward like nurse does in fatigue after a hit, or her moving kinda like the spirit
---
## bruh 👏👏🤙👏😤
---
There's no discussion to be had. Perks aren't toxic, add-ons aren't toxic. It's how the killer/survivor plays that should be deemed toxic or not imo.
---
That’s sounds super op cause you could put a husk at like every gen and jump around but it sounds super fun
---
When you pretend to be farming with myers but when you whip out that tombstone
---
When that fresh David hits.... mmmmff
---
"really decent" those are top tier meta perks bruh
---
depending on OP's killer/ loadout, using both of those tracking perks kills stealth ez
---
Matchmaking only requires one player close to your rank to match I guess.  I think SWF should have a rank cap for matchmaking so that lower ranks like me aren’t    pitted against pros.
---
Pig does nothing to deserve the nerfs, she’s always been a pretty Killer but she still gets nerfed for no reason.
---
Imagine this situation: Someone runs into you and starts teabagging. you down them, hook them and they deliverance, get into locker, DS you, get into locker again, head on you and run to the exit gate while getting protected by someone else, making you unable to kill them.
---
that's not being mad because "you lost". That's being mad because someone deliberately tried to make you mad and succeeded. Guess I had to play around that ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
It's one thing when you "use your perks"
---
It's another when you go toward the killer just to hit them with all your second chances to make them mad and to safely escape anyway with almost no risk involved
---
New to the game....what’s tunneling?
---
They haven't nerfed BBQ/ whispers like they have nerfed self-care, all I'm saying.

He's not too bad atm.

Do you have any proof it’s like that?
---
Yes. , yes and yes!
---
I only give them Hatch if they don't Wiggle at the end when I down them as the last Survivor.
---
Not true.
---
That really did escalate quickly.
---
Your job as a Killer is to fiddle with survivors to feed the Entity, not to kill per se. Never camp a hook or slug unless it's justified: you lose points, and you won't rank up (the game punishes those behaviours). Check the tally screen and you will see that you won't get a "Merciless Killer" title, or close to 32k bloodpoints by playing like that.
---
That really did escalate quickly jeez
---
Pretty balanced either don't tunnel which you shouldn't unless you have dying light or just use a Mori.
---
Though that might cause a dc since survivors who had ds but get Mori seem to like quiting when they can't use ds
---
^^kate
---
I think perks like distressing also will put it past the cap. Don't get confused though it will still stop at 32k no matter what but then adds on the post game bonuses, that can give you more than 32k in one game
---
Run Monitor and Abuse and Ruin. They are necessities for her. Secondly, when you approach a gen that's being worked on, pule on it from a distance to try to infect whoever is working on it before they can run. Always keep your vile purge charged and ready. When you find a survivor, keep puking on them until they are broken. They don't get a speed boost from your vomit. They will try to run loops. Don't break the pallets they drop. Instead vomit on the pallets and survivor. They have a hard time looping her puke. Once they are down, m1 them, hook them, then go patrol gens. Whoever saves them will immediately become infected. Then rinse and repeat. When you get the upgraded vomit, hit them in short bursts. When using it, try to spin with it for a chance of hitting more than one. She's great at stalling them game. For perks, I would use Monitor and Abuse, Ruin, Spirit Fury and Enduring, or Bamboozle and Brutal Strength. When she goes to the M1 stage, she can be looped easily
---
should’ve said , “Oh that’s sounds like a YOU problem.”
---
There are two ways of playing:
---
1.- Survivors don't cleanse: some survivors believe it is better to not cleanse to not give you the metal slug vomit. in this case I like to use perks that help you take advantage of their no mither state, for example, play with your food, it gives you a NOED like state, even faster, and since the normal vomit does not counts as an offensive action, it last longer. also things like I'm all ears become really good since now they just need 1 mistake to go down.
---
2.- Survivors cleanse: in this case remember to use a corrupted fountain if you see them all getting corrupted, to avoid them all from losing it's power. also knowing when to consume them it is really important, so you don't end up wasting it in a place where you don't find anyone, or a place where you can't really use it.
---
Can you explain your logic here more coherently? How are keys 10x more pussy than ebony moris?
---
I didn't know who leatherface even was before MKX, Ghostface on the other hand, I've known who he is since I was like 4
---
Yeah honestly I’m a fan of the game, but when I play I want to enjoy it.  Many players I’ve gone against really get off on the idea that they’ve outsmarted me or whatever and like to rub it in, but honestly I’m just trying to have a good, casual time playing.
---
Its okay. She fell victim to NOED and killed herself on the hook
---
Killers: kill the survivors
---
Survivors: you werent supposed to do that.
---
Imi, anything becomes toxic ONLY if it is self detrimental to the person perform the action, ie: face-camping like, almost always,  most forms of baiting the killer to you, and about half the tunneling cases. Ie, someone gets rescued, next hook is death hook, and you see a p3 Claudette for the first time all game. I’d go for claud cause I think hurting her benefits me endgame, but thats getting into play style and personal starts I guess
---
you are not very likeable in this post

work on that in the future

---
That's because the best counter for Ghostface is for survivors to force you to play up in their face rather than stealth. You cant really be an "up in your face" killer with him because it forces him to be just an m1 killer.
---
Demigorgon
---
It's always the game's fault, not the fact they're actually trash and can't mind game. Why should survivors feel bad about looping an idiot around one piece of terrain for a few minutes. I play both survivor and killer, and any killer who whines about it being hard (when they never had it easier than they got it right now after all the survivor nerfs) is simply bad at the game.
---
And lol, a quick search of this sub shows that it's 90% killer mains whining about survivors. Apparently a 4k is fine, but survivors daring to escape is cardinal sin. And now, they make threads theorising on how survivors are supposedly going to whine.
---
It's rather ironic that they spend their time convincing themselves survivors are the whiners, when all they need to do is look in the mirror to discover the truth.
---
Doesn’t it take the hatch like 3 seconds to even open once you’re the last survivor anyway? Billy would’ve caught up to you before it popped, not really fair to blame it on Dwight.
---
And that’s also the risk you take when you do solo Q and not SWF, you could’ve left him to die.
---
New perk does that.
---
Kinda.

In a way

Please game end yourself

I thought I was having a shit night for matchmaking...goddamn...
---
As an experienced ghost main, Lean stalk as much as you possibly can, almost impossible for suvivors to break you out of night shroud, if by michael route you mean 99ing exposing then only ever do that with groups of survivors together and if you're far. and then focus on one and fully expose when close enough to catch up to them and quickly down. That's how i play anyway and I always get 4 or 3ks
---

Bring on the downvote, killer mains. Upvote your own circle jerking that purports you as noble. If you do it enough you might just start to believe it.

It’s so frustrating. I would love to main Ghostface but I get legitimately angry when I play him. He’s so cool but he’s so so so hard to use.

that's why.

I just played wraith at rank 8 had survivors rank 16 and 20 I'm like oh no I'm a monster
---
Yes they are. Play the tutorial and youd know that.

I just had to come back here and share with you guys. Front page on this sub, killer mains posting topics about how survivors will supposedly say 'demogorgon op' as soon as it's released. Meanwhile, they forget the majority of threads on this sub are in fact killer mains complaining about survivors. The topic has 98% upvotes, because sub is run by the killer main illuminati.

If you're talking about getting out of night shroud then lean stalk, basically impossible for survivors to break you out. What I usually do is stalk from afar and then get up close and finish the stalk. Trying to be stealthy up close is extremely difficult against competent survivors.
---
down that person. Before they unhook?

Michael has tits.

Usually if they don't wiggle, I walk towards the basement, but yeah when it's endgame I'll think about it

About the ability I've posted it in another comment. The perks would be as follow:
---
Hex totem: Envy : Every time a generator is completed, the survivor who repaired said generator the most gets the exposed status for 5/10/15 seconds
---
You break it... :When a survivor cleanses a totem, the survivor's aura is revealed for 3/5/8 seconds
---
Wardrobe: When a survivor near the terror radius exits a locker, he leaves scratch marks, regardless if he's running or not. 
---
Also,  he suffers a 1/2/3 second delay when exiting.
---
no it wasn't ghostface's redstain was literally up to his head.
---
Sometimes when you know you're going to lose during a chase, and you're definitely dead, then just stop running away from them and walk towards them. They might have mercy on you
---
No, I want easy kills, not sit and sweat for an hour trying to get 1 guy
---
Will Ferrel is so great
---
Once you get past a certain rank/certain time put into the game, his ability to track survivors becomes pretty redundant as most Killers will be running Whispers/BBQ/some other tracking perk, and will know telltale signs a survivor is nearby. The benefits it provides besides that (Skillchecks appearing all over the screen, having to snap out of it, etc.) are all easily pushed by without much issue. Plus, his shock attack is unreliable and sometimes doesnt even block vaults properly when it should, along with his shock being quite weak and hard to land without Brown Electrode (plus at the range you need to land it normally, you might as well walk forward a bit more and just...hit them, instead.)
---
He's not the worst killer, but I'd put him around the bottom 5 personally. Plus, he's super annoying to play against as Survivor, which detracts from his positives even more. I will give him this though: His addons are rather fun, I really like brown electrode + Iridescent king.
---
Must've missed that part.
---
Regardless, I don't think it's even possible for them to do that.
---
The entire progression system is on that. The Bloodweb, Bloodpoints, Iridescent Shards, Auric Cells, inventory status and unlocked cosmetics all hinge on their inherent servers.
---
If they’re trying to u hook themselves then it’s come safe me
---
If it’s like a butterfly then it’s killer is camping do the gens
---
I now want DBD hentai, someone get on it!

&gt;There's nothing you can do about tunnelling.

I get it now, thanks! I'm still fairly new to the game with about 2 months of owning it.

I mean bottom line is that you cant reasonably call either toxic, but it is an unfun way to play the game and the game would be a lot more fun if people didn't care so much about "winning".
---
Slug them
---
... Uh... Does somebody wanna tell him?
---
if they teabag then just fucken face camp their ass. Or play a game or two of survivor
---
Thing is nobody wants to wait longer than 5s for a lobby and everyone complained the shit out of the devs so they "tweaked" matchmaking. 
---
That is the result.

This is all the time or 70% of this sub-reddit

Damn, I feel your pain bro :/

It makes sense, as PWYF is an "offensive action" not "attack."

Dwight be looking extra thicc

*Laughs in Spine Chill*
---
Matchmaking is literally s&gt;!tunning!!&lt;
---
I feel bad for you. F to pay respect.
---
Every 60 seconds when waking up without a clock and every 90ish I believe when waking up with one also getting hooked gets rid of the sleep effect also giving points and other survivors waking you up is slower each time
---
The one who eats people's organs is not feral. Huh
---
Ah, I see the merry go round has returned.
---
Of course not
---
This is a good point to be honest. I do disagree though, I believe there should be spme punishment for camping and tunnelling, and before anyone says "the other can just rush gens, thats the punishment", no, no its not. There should be a visible debuff to th killer or buff to the survivors for these moments.
---
Killer is tunneling? Extra hook state or longer timer
---
Killer is camping? Faster gens for survivors 
---
I don't claim to be a professional game designer but I don't see the issues with these things. Please let me know your view on them.
---
Ps. I think decisive should deactivate if the killer gets another hook. It should punish tunneling only.
---
I was soloing with other red rank teammates in a match, the Legion that dced turned out to be rank 16. Shit is bad.
---
You’re drinking and killing.
---
I've only been playing for a week and already laugh when I see this. As long as you don't move they seem to get the point after awhile.
---
Is just you
---
If you play killer you legally cannot use any perks. You should know this by now dude!
---
What are you talking about?
---
*HEE HEE*
---
In the next update they will change her name from The Pig to Bacon.
---
Eats sand and fucks to survive is a huge mood
---
Wait for it.
---
Because they think they are pro when they try to bully, and they won't admit that they actually suck when they die because their ego's too big

Because they're just having a good time with friends. Trying silly things like body blocking and such. They know it doesn't work, but it's funny if you still try. Just sounds like to me that you've focused too much on "swf = tryhard" instead of "swf = bad, good, having fun, trolling, sweating, etc..."
---
Fellow wraith main here, I think the two main issues with Wraith are his base cloaked speed (126%) and uncloak time (3 seconds), a slight numbers buff to his base kit (from 126% to either 140% or 150% along with reducing his uncloak time to 2 seconds) would not only give him great mobility without the influence of add-ons (considering he's extremely add-on reliant), but it would make Swift Hunt an add-on that's on par with either Windstorm or Shadow Dance.
---
It's a video game. You have the power to walk away. That's one of the cool things about being an adult, knowing when to walk away.  It's not about winning, it's about having fun playing the game. Losing can be fun if the match is still fun. 
---
5 year olds are also the first ones to gloat when they pull one over on you. There's worse poor sportsmanship in the community than walking away from a venue of entertainment that you just aren't feeling anymore. Next you're going to tell me i can't leave the table until i finish my peas.
---
My head cannon for Dwight now is that he's from Auckland, and his co-workers abandoned him in the bush so they could move into his apartment

Where's David and Jake ones?

This has never happened to me, but I've heard that sometimes BP gets refunded and sometimes you can get everything you've earned since you started playing back.
---
Is it a positive oh my god or a negative one
---
I think you mean u/cheeseontoastkid
---
Imagine taking a killer that already has a hard time applying pressure, has no mobility and just got their end game power spike deleted and nerfing them again. good job bhvr
---
Great art! One of the best I've seen so far on this sub
---
I’m so disappointed because Jane is dummy thick but she didn’t get a booty pad ? I’m a meg main anyways and daddy Myers is love so...I know my purchases anyways lol. But you should do a Jane booty one.
---
Public test server
---
Agree
---
I’ve literally had the same concept in my mind for so long omg thought thief
---
This happens so much to IDV and they just give into it and it's so damn annoying :/
---
You usually want to use regular attacks anyways unless at very specific loops.
---
Who is 'we'? The other neckbeards living in your basement?
---
She has an ultra rare that lets her teleport to any trap she’s previously set, which I’d argue is still more powerful than demogorgons teleport because hers is instant
---
The exit gates? I sure will try!

i got one of my posts removed by the mods for highlighting how bad the matchmaking was hopefully urs doesnt get removed

Can I ask how you arrived at that laughable 90%? Both sides want to win, people get upset when they don't and they vent. 90% of the internet is porn and 90% of what's left, 9%, is people pitching a fit about something. It'll never end. Best to try to let it go.
---
I killed a rank 2 sooooooooooo
---
My friends shit on me all the time about this I feel ya
---
They then dead hard to gain distance and have now reached a pallet/window.
---
Simple. Get spirit, run Haunted Ground, Ruin, Thrill of the Hunt, and Discordance. Add Prayer Beads, Mother Daughter Ring, and a simple Ebony Mori.
---
Is this still available?
---
*eyeroll* have you tried not being a dumbass?
---
Yeah but, not on this Calibre lol
---
She is really not strong at all unless survivors get super unlucky with trap RNG maybe
---
I had a kind spirit hook us all once and then down us again and make us wiggle free as she would drop us by Gens. There was also bloody party streamers involved lol. It was funny because a Dwight didnt know what she was doing and kept running from her. Me and the last teammate offered to let her kill us in the end so she could get more points but she let us go instead.
---
idk, if a YT with like devotion 5 or higher had this happen I could see it almost reaching 100 mil
---
i have a running fetish ok, let me run and vault and stab
---
Hag has worse chase (because of her 110% ms) and doesnt have a pounce
---
Ah maybe,
---
I know, I’m talking based purely on teleport abilities, hers is better
---
I'm just not sure how fair that could be in a chase. Provided he's able to keep his eyes on a survivor during the transitions, its almost impossible to lose him
---
i ran a hag for 5 gens the other day all while he was tunneling me and putting tons of traps down when i got hooked and when i finally got sacrificed he called me trash
---
Completely true I remember being told that Freddy was broken and stronger than the nurse when he first got released after I said he wasn’t that strong
---
Gen rushing exists. Pretty much, it happens when survivors are too interested in doing gens, than anything else: To help in their survivors to heal, to  rescue them, to cleanse totems etc. Topped with always using toolboxes, and it becomes annoying as hell.

If this is not sarcasm... Then ok i guess
---
Barely see people complaining about these things. Killers live in their own little world. The front page is always full of only killers complaining or casual memes....
---
Noed is obviously fine. Camping, ive covered. Not sure wtf you are talking about with dcing and farming. No you can't go on forever. There are 2 things killers are directly responsible for that survivors complain about. Camping and tunnelling. 
---
Not perks. That's a dev issue. If its in the game its fair game.
---
Wait,isn't that Freddy before rework?
---
This is the greatest meme page on here
---
Going after the same guy. You hook him, when he I unhooked, you do everything possible and ignore everybody else to hook him again, until he dies.
---
In a way, it makes sense, as you kill somebody like this faster. However, it is not as fun to play against, and not optimal at all (you do not disrupt the decoding).
---
I wish I could give you a hug, I know that too damn well
---
PS4 player here and definitely Hag or Plague when played right. 4 totem Hag is super powerful as long as there isnt a damn map. Plague is hard to go up against when she vomits all over the entire map.
---
I honestly hope this is satire, 
---
Do you know just how much map control this gives the killer? Even if they can only have 3 portals at once you can go from one side to the other incredibly quickly, not to mention while survivors are destroying it (which looks like it takes a while) they get the new oblivious status effect, which causes the terror radius to have no effect, and the killer can see their aura, the killer can just run up and with the demogorgons pounce they can be damaged before they even see the red stain
---
Not to mention the other teleporting systems (Freddy an hag addon) are much more limited
---
There’s a sequel coming out in October too.
---
no, 60 seconds to fall asleep, then you stay asleep until you wake yourself up again, by failing a skill check, getting snapped at by your teammates, or using an alarm clock.
---
Remove the rng from technician and just make it 100% with a cooldown, and it's perfect.
---
I had a game today where I was the last alive. I snuck around, found the hatch  and went through. Then the killer messages is and says “boring game” bro like what?? Just because I didn’t run around you for 10 mins makes it boring?
---
You're not wrong is the sad part.
---
Best part is that this at least I think stops lag switchers from being able to lag switch? Though I might be wrong on that.

Demogorgon

Gotta disagree. I think trying to actually finish the gen is more productive than crouching around the map or just running around looking for the totem (unless you've got the spawns down). It's like Self Care; sure, it helps, but people end up spending way too much time doing it.

To be fair, I think most people are in the mindset currently. I think the only thing dictating how broken Inner Strength is would be what ends up the meta build.
---
Like realistically it's VERY possible without balance changes, the current Adrenaline, DS, DH, BT stays meta for survivors and inner strength just ends up as a side option for healing.
---
I do have a feeling we'll probably end up seeing like, Inner Strength, Head On, Quick and Quiet, DS. Head On already has made a decent step into popularity with that change to it and Inner Strength could really help that build if the killer wastes time on trying to bait you jumping out early and if they grab you then you DS. It's a bit of a lose lose situation for killer.

Thats because of selective perception. Only Bad things get recognized and Good things usually pass by real quick. Take everything you read here with a grain of salt.

The game on average is nice. Some times the salt levels are high sometimes they're low. Enjoy your time playing dbd and if you Think this subreddit is too toxic leave for a while and check back. Times change quick in the internet
---
Mmmmh yeah spray rhat goo on me
---
Somebody needs run the killer around for 5 gens with just his teachables
---
Yeah but Huntress' hatchets are different than her main weapon, the axe. But Pig uses the same weapon for her dash and M1 so it's like saying her sprinting makes the blade weaker for some reason.
---
this guy has lots of bp because some time ago there was a bug that made you lose your entire in-game progress, so people that lost it emailed the bhvr support with screenshots of what happened and depending on how many progress you lost they would refund your progress with tons of bp. I lost my progress and did all I mentioned before and got 9 million bp. So don't open your mouth if you don't know what are you talking about :D
---
Look at me... I am the puppet now.
---
wraith is op
---
He is fun to play but only on green ranks  alltho i get rekt on red ranks with everything but spirit or nurse
---
I'm still waiting
---
We all are
---
Leveling up your account grants iridescents yes, but they're saying that someone who has played long enough to get to devotion 5 would have gotten a whole lot of BP in that time
---
I lost my file at 2.3 k hours. I did get refunded my BP, but my Legacy is permanently lost. The BP I was given was a little over 120 Million, so more than the picture above.
---
There is also 1 person called Jed Sawyer. Leatherface is real and he will facecamp everyone
---
That is the unfunniest joke ever
---
Is PoP goes the weasel bad too?
---
Why cannot we reward killers doing their job? (And it is not a Dead light tunnel perk)
---
Also, you can use it in two ways:
---
- Store all the tickets until later in the game to destroy few at once and decrease the search zone for the other survivors.
---
- Destory the gen progression 
---
Also, it rewards survivors preventing the first death for as long as possible, and making this perk less useful.... As well as finishing gen 99% will be still an option...
---
What are the party changes? Will I be able to stay in a swf group after a game now?
---
But that's irrelevant. Player skill is different
---
The manga was better...
---
And sloppy butcher is pure toxic. All it does is make survivirs heal longer, which is not fun for survivors, so you need to take it off too.
---
Feel free to replace them with things like monstrous shrine (but remember putting a survivor into the basement is a banable offense) and beast of prey (but if you use bloodlust it means you are a noob that relies on crutch mechanics, so you should drop the chase once you get bloodlust).
---
If someone sabos a trap, will it be destroyed for the rest of the match? If you use hangman's, does it repair your destroyed traps? I really don't know
---
They will be able to tell you are no mither once they see you tho.
---
I play this way as killer tbh. Usually doing a daily or have extra cake to share.
---
&gt;So i mainly play hag if i wanna have fun and **place traps on my first hooks** and just stay a little outta range during chases so **i can quickly turn and teleport there**
---
&gt;Yesterday i got a easy 4k match cuz the survivors were **over alturistic**
---
wat
---
Who?
---
That's how survivor perks work. They're either considered cheesy/OP or a meme. There's no balanced state in the reddit's eyes.
---
Same cannot be said with The Clown and The Legion lol.
---
Bone clapper + Blink addons, to spam the shit out of survivor's ears.  
---
Or, for a serious build, try The serpent + Shadow dance addons. Quick pallet or generator breaking and quick chase resuming after that. Makes you actually be able to use your power in a chase!
---
Been told this too 😭
---
You *hack* are the *wheeze cough* entire *hack wheeze* circus!
---
I didn’t even know about this. Pig is so low tier and her ambush isn’t good enough to deserve this treatment. She has so much potential to be a fun and solid Killer but her values aren’t up to par, especially when you consider how much better Ghostface’s stealth game is. I hope they reduce the RNG aspect of her traps and give her better tools to end chases in the future.
---
I’ll take the Dwight and Myers one then burn the rest.
---
There shall be no wahmen in my reverse harem. ❦

”There’s no such thing as tunneling. I’m simply doing the objective...poorly.”
---
As a survivor main who doesn’t wanna use DS but only does cuz tunnel. Bless your soul.
---
BHVR - Please make it happen!! &lt;3
---
He is basically saying that he proxy camped all game and got an easy 4k because survivors were over altruistic by saving other survivors while the killer is in a chase instead of letting them die on first hook. Probably said "gg ezzz" in end game chat too.
---
FFFFFFFFF
---
FFFFF

you cap out at 1 mil

You ever been so mad you hit a motherfucker with another motherfucker

Is this a Jojo reference?

Its not, one is a fruit the other is a vegetable!

bruh
---
Survivor bad Killer good am I right guys? We Killers are so cool, but those survivors are so bad, we are the morally superior beings
---
There was, but he sabotaged his production line !
---
I just want them to actually give Meg more muscles. Sis hasn't worked out a day in her life.
---
Honestly, I think Technician should just prevent explosions and make no noise when working on a gen. Give the explosion prevention a short cooldown if you think it's unbalanced (though I personally don't think it would be).
---
I see your point. It is fair.
---
Which change would you propose to make it balanced?
---
that three dollar target microphone killed me
---
Thank you, the only problem is i replied to the email about 2 hours after i was told they have been credited. And the support staff said they should be there just restart your game, i must have reset it about 30 times by now. Still no bloodpoints. So i emailed them back explaining this and havent heard back since :/
---
What am i looking at
---
there's one person in the world named kate denson and 12 named meg thomas and jake park
---
Potatoes are no vegetable. They are nightshade plants like tomatoes
---
See, 3 gens in 45 seconds is not even possible, with or without toolboxes. It might feel like a little time in a chase, but time passes quicker than many killers think.
---
Wait wait wait, daddy I can explain, come back... I'll let you choke me I know you love that and so do i
---
Should have used the wazzzaaaaapp face
---
I see, thats unfortunate, knowing BHVR it'll take them a while, but just have hope :)
---
Oh I’m not trying to say that, hag only has one power so her teleport should be better, demogorgon has multiple abilities so it makes sense for them to not be super strong
---
So we back in The Game, got the Killer swinging side to side, side side to side
---
Ah i see, being able to heal yourself in 8 second whenever you want is bad, so you really have to get the bonus 20% walking speed.
---
As much as I hate to say it, really is no point in trying to rescue your teammates at endgame, most likely killer will be right on your ass so at least one person is going down. And generally once the exit gates are powered it’s a free for all.
---
Yeah, they could have done better, once I bought GhostFace I regretted immediately, but as a Killer main, after a while I started to like him, maybe just because stealth killers fit my style of gameplay, no matter how awkward or weak he can be, I still have lots of fun and perfect matches on red ranks.
---
In older version there was a bug where you would lose all of your progress. If this happened, the devs would have refunded you all the bloodpoints since you started playing, so they will obviously be more than 1 million
---
Tysm I'm wet now. God it's literally my exact kink. Daddy Ghostface next please
---
That only will work with trapper and even then his traps aren't consistent so this might turn out to be a waste. I think im most likely wrong on this, but i dont think you can trap lockers anymore.
---
i(red rank) soloQ'd and got into a game with a 3swf and a bubba.
---
i looped the bubba for a good 2 minutes while the swf didnt pop a single gen. 
---
when on the hook i noticed they were all 3 hunkered up in a corner with each other.
---
the bubba let them farm bps and i was never rescued off the Hook. i lost a pip obv.
---
they had the bubba on their friendslist and they were all, including bubba green ranks. :)
---
none of them were banned even though they had done this many times before since i saw screenshots ln the bubbas profile of the SAME SURVIVORS farming with him. and a random fourth player had been sacrificed..
---
A poor, poor soul.
---
This basically sums up how my team bones me whenever I save them. Recently, I brought a key and found the hatch in a losing Hillbilly game (that's a pretty frequent trend huh) and I saved the only other person alive and ran them towards the hatch. This man body blocks me to heal himself, with billy right behind us, and I get chainsawed for my death hook.
---
I guess that could be a change, but chances are you’re just gonna punish the killer more for something that is already extremely punishable. Camping sucks cuz it’s no fun, but it really is a bad idea by the killer.
---
I like ass and tiddies
---
In these potentional scenarios you are missing the one where the killer can just not tunnel and he won't need to deal with it.
---
Yeah thatd be cool af
---
If he left when Billy was behind him he would have had enough time for sure.
---
Yup. No Mither would actually be usable
---
It takes one totem hunter on your team to make it useless for the rest (I'll cleanse all immediately so you better beat me to it), might be on a map where some are decently hidden, could be a totem protector build, broken status overrides it so Deliverance and not cleansing against Plague halts it.
---
Thx bud
---
What an original post. Like all the posts in this subreddit.
---
As survivor you just get injured and heal and get healed then do hens as killer I have no idea
---
I'm actually more disappointed that the killer didn't feel bad for you and just let you have the hatch.. but I suppose he has a quota to meet.
---
But isn’t ghostface in dbd not based off anything in the movies?
---
She?
---
I thought you were fucking joking!  Jesus Christ!  Lol
---
Generators are the only objective for the survivors, everything else like looping, unhooking, healing etc is just buying time and space to do that objective.
---
Tunnelling one survivor is not the objective of the killer, he's trying to stop them all escaping and by tunnelling/camping one you actually let the others escape more easily.

They couldn't even NAME HIM PROPERLY because of rights
---
As much as I don’t like the FNAF series I think an animatronic killer would be dank
---
I actually pitched a Killer with this concept a few weeks ago:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cqmq4r/killer_concept_the_zealot_20_updated_and_now_with/
---
Imma head out
---
"I'm not going to jail because I said hateful things. I'm going to jail because of [insert group of people you said hateful things to] are scum!!!!!"
---
Ya no idea how but ya
---
Yup this is big meme time
---
But he is right. This whole subbredit is just killer mains saying that survivors are op. Almost every post in hot is "survs are toxic" "survs are op" "killers are underwhelming" "look how i morid this toxic SWF" "noed is balanced because it just is" "genrush is a thing"
---
Unrealistic there's no bagging or flashlight clicking
---
why would you do that...
---
Isn't that the one from the least popular game? Pretty sure they would pick a more iconic character from the series like Freddy or even the purple guy and in a animatronic suit.
---
Either way I don't think they can translate jump-scares into a power. Hag already kind of has that on lock down.
---
Hatch opens instantly if the last survivor leaves via escape. Sacrifice takes 3 seconds.
---
just wait, she hasn't pallet stunned yet
---
I’m out of the loop, anyone have info about these updates perks
---
Frick, frick

I'm on ps4 and play ghostface but don't camp, perhaps we played against each other lol

I did it with adrenalin and last gen ones so i commited gen and run away from dying state

Yeahh

Shriek if you know what i did last friday the 13th. Kinda like scary movie but worse

It's from a movie called Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th—it's like Scary Movie but even worse.
---
See this man is an academic of the highest kind, we need sexy Jake and we need it now!
---
A subreddit shouldn’t be judged by its worst followers
---
Terrifying
---
How is the netflix adaptation whiter than the source material
---
This is a JOKE. the meme posts about waiting for the PTB were a JOKE. We know how hard the devs work, we just want to make memes.
---
Shit never really put that together til now.
---
Probably because the pig can't kill people who are exposed with her ambush anymore.
---
Yes, but it would be a survivor and a killer + 6 teachable perks for €5.
---
That’s more reasonable then spending €5 on a new skin for a character. Rather spend money on something that bring new gameplay to the game then just a cosmetic thing, that has no impact, other then looking cool.
---
They mentioned before that they'll do dc punishments once dedicated servers are live since it'll give them what they need to do it how they want to do it.
---
Yes, they are supposed to blind survivors too lol, you can even blind your friends if you wanna be a dick 😂
---
SKELETON BALL! DADADADA DA DAAAA
---
Pig is still better than Wraith by far lol.
---
Looks like a hunter from Bloodborne
---
Cool concept, not gonna happen. The director’s a kiddy fiddler
---
No, FNAF needs to be purged with fire
---
This scene is such a good representation of dead by daylight I love it
---
porn parody is rivers cuomo
---
First, this is NOT the same thing as the minecraft mining off camera.
---
Second, r/uselessnobody
---
Theres 3953 people with my name... Fuck.
---
Tapping gens is the 3rd hidden option, because it's so bad nobody should do it.
---
Yes, you *can* gentap, but if you do the math it takes so long that it is never worth it. Gen tapping is worse than doing the gen even if you miss every Great skillcheck on an average completion.
---
Missed opportunity with Jane smh
---
Rip SBFP😟
---
The feeling of doing a good loop against a good killer while all the others watch in awe as you and the killer both mind game each other.
---
Springtrap isnt an alien, spring trap is the restless soul of purple guy trapped in the srping lock suit
---
They do, I used spine chill to know when the killer was looking at me, and then premonition to determine from what direction (so I could run in the opposite one lol). Works if you like stealth with no teachables unlocked but obviously there are better things out there
---
Yep. Sadly it just isn't good anymore. Used to be WAY to powerful at release
---
Nice noed fgt
---
Who is Ghst Fae?
---
Saying a killer is low-tier is not an equivalent of saying you can’t play them?
---
I'm not talking about bodyblocking the hook location normally. I'm talking about bodyblocking the location when hooking is already in process.
---
it also can cause a similar bug to grab that didn't go off. sometimes the killer's camera gets locked and he can't look down nor up until he presses M1 or hooks the person
---
They might be trying to account for games where you get screwed over and don't get many bloodpoints.
---
However, they may be overestimating the amount of lower bp games. Games like that honestly aren't too common, especially in the long run.
---
It's my face when I try to sneak up on someone far away as the pig, but they suddenly turn their head towards me and start glowing.
---
Isnt anything new "OP"?
---
This task a grueling one, hope to find a goddamn ruin totem tonight
---
Please read the post again
---
*Buenos Dias, Quentin.*
---
Make me one
---
Freddys remember me perk thank you
---
Pay me
---
Wait do u like those films
---
What a fabulous killer! I'm so here for it! x
---
It's just a lil thing, and also from what i can tell, this OP is kinda falls under all the categories that define a player that has dbd in it.
---
I know that that's why they said they did it in the first place, since it's *technically* consistent with other killers, but I'm saying that it just *feels* wrong given how it looks. If she dashed with another weapon all this time then I would only have the complaint that it was a nerf.
---
At max scenario, you will bloc three gens, and the person looks for the hatch anyways.
---
Two — still one possible to be done (the last gen).
---
One — still two and so on.
---
It might be harsh, but it pretty much turns 2v1 into a more favorable match-up.  It does not delete all gens from the game. As for 3v1, the team still has a chance, so no worries.
---

Also, this is a Hex perk..... Forgot to mention. If you break the totem, all the blocked gens are unlocked again

Aight  how much fam
---
Let's  not :)
---
Agreed
---
How many blood points do you have?
---
I know my opinion is somewhat flawed as I play 2-3man swf and so have an advantage with coordinating escapes like this, but there are always chances to get everyone out. Killers often screw up once the gates are powered and if everyone at least tries and has some traces of brain cells you can often turn the situation around. Everyone has terrible experiences with braindead or asshole teammates. I'd try not to let it ruin your team spirit as the game will get less fun after that.
---
The scary thing to remember (new players) is that Dwight wasn't modelled after Cote - there was a MORE dwight like person in that office than Matthieu Cote
---
No. Devs stated it only affects the % for jumping off the hook
---
What does your love for Scream have to do with how he is in game? It shouldn't affect your opinion on this killer at all for obvious reasons.
---
I'm a big fan of Scream too but Danny has nothing to do with GF in Scream. And for a good reason. GF used to be a person behind a mask, not ONE person. Danny is another GF.  Besides, in Scream he was laughable at times...after all they were teenagers.
---
The lore of DBD's GF at least portraits him more complex and actually brings justice to what this Slasher Character should be - a patient meticulous psycho.
---
I don't see how people complain about not being able to reveal him, when all survivors get me out of NS all the time :(
---
I think you used this format wrong, the Netflix Adaptation is supposed to be the worst one, not the best.
---
The lore of DBD's GF at least portraits him more complex and actually brings justice to what this Slasher Character should be - a patient meticulous psycho. A stalker...so yeah, a stealthy killer. All his add-ons and items are related to stealthy behaviors, as BHVR intended to create him. People should stop comparing him with the killer in Scream. Not the same and never was their intention to be.
---
The problem is that he is mid tier because his Power, which should be used for exposing, is barely viable at low ranks. I only use it for surprise attacks with Nurse's Calling and mindgaming.
---
I don't see how people complain about not being able to reveal him though, when all survivors get me out of NS all the time :(
---
this video is cursed. i just had some odd feedback come through my speakers that sounded like aliens trying to contact me.... not today satan!

It's not that a FNAF killer wouldn't fit.
---
I can handle the Stranger Things fandom coming to DBD for sure, no problems there.
---
But I cannot handle the FNAF fandom.
---
Yeah ive had enough of Dbd for today
---
It causes a longer time the hook is sabotoged. And if you want to bring another item. Your friend can 99 all hooks and when they go down, you can finish it before they get hooked
---
"ecotoxic" sounds like DbD alright
---
How old is this picture? I can see a common coldwind offering.
---
[deleted]
---
Then you put on furitive chase and get all 4 tokens and monitor then you’ll never be heard
---
They should make it so that you can sabo hooks while being carried
---
and if you do kobe you'll just deny me of my points
---
“You killers” dude your adding to it right now. I just pointed out that as a new player a shit load of people have done toxic shit to me, and the worst was from people in the discord, and you wanna do what aboutism.
---
And you need to reread. It isn’t “distracting” it’s being unable to play because I was the wraith and they told me to pick stuff that made me weak to light and then just kept me perma blinded.

Scoops Ahoy Steve is pretty much the o my reason I’m getting the DLC

Especially when they leave you in the endgame, 3 teammates each with 10-15k points survive and you die with high 20ks
---
you are incorrigible
---
We’ll have to see how exactly it work. Wasn’t sure if it counts forever once you cleanse a totem or you have a time limit or have to do it while injured. But I just don’t see the benefit of walking faster, sure seeing you scratch marks is good and all but you don’t really need to know that often.
---
I had the same yesterday when i was playing pig i was so confused
---
It's not the fact that a FNAF character would be unfitting
---
I can happily take the Stranger Things fandom being introduced to the game, I have no problems there.
---
But I can not handle the FNAF fandom.
---
For real tho imma need a source on that top image
---
Yes. It works from the beginning. In fact, you can take it instead of ruin (to slow game down, as you pretty much eliminate 1+ gen they worked on). Then, they have an option to stop deciding, and seek for the totems, or try to do so, but in a greater danger (similar to hex:ruin).
---
If you take it as a stand-alone hex, chances are they won’t feel it’s effect until some gens are blocked for too long. So, odds are that they will not cleanse it/notice it. 
---
In you take a hex build, then it will not matter as much too.
---
I just hope I don't get you on my team, useless people who rely on self care always lose matches for others.
---
Wow old photo, this must have been taken before the bloodweb rework back in 2016.
---
Had a game against a ghost face. Team dead, I’m trying to find hatch and I hear the Exposed status pop and everything inside me dies. I turn around to see the Ghostface walking towards me but he stops about 10 feet away. After 20 seconds I get aggravated. “KILL ME ALREADY” I yell as I sprint towards him. He starts running away. “NO YOU DONT YOU BASTARD” I howl, the pain of watching my friends die wells up. 
---
He turns and sees me still chasing, he goes to a jungle gym and starts trying to hide. I find him and he t-bags and runs again. After a good minute of this I am crying and he comes over and one hits me and t-bags over my body. He picks me up, and drops me in front of the exit gates switch. 
---
___
---
Funniest end to a game I’ve had.
---
Can we please not have fnaf here?
---
Why? It's not a great series but same can be said for all of the other licenses
---
I love this concept and think he would be an amazing killer for the game, but have to agree with the people who doubt this will happen. Interested to hear some perk ideas for this guy tho.
---
I think it could result in some really unique perks and powers if done correctly but the "haunted grounds" *pun definitely intended* of the FNAF fandom is something that would have to be considered
---
I like surveillance for pig. Let’s me know when they go back to gens so I can sneak up on them for cheesy hits/grabs. Spine chill counters that playstyle though.
---
they aren't highlighted, their position is given away at that moment, really big difference. Also 15 seconds ain't shit, a killer trying to take advantage of it will lose out on half the exposed timer by the time they get to the survivor, and after running a standard loop once the exposed effect will be gone by then.
---
r/sbeve
---
Can you honestly tell me that you can consistently loop a killer for the entire game, and further from there, that’s it’s an easy thing to learn
---
A original one would be better..
---
Because Flat Earthers dont believe you exist
---
Urban evasion is a stupid perk and does not belong with those perks
---
HE COULD BE ANY ONE OF US
---
To be fair if they are killing off the game that would mean the community is mostly gone so most people attempting to play it will most likely be in parties playing KYF
---
Only misses the killer turning around to catch the survivor only for the survivor to also turn around and them falling into an equilibrium of small back and forth movements on opposite sides.
---
If anyone get out from that hatch they get a Happy ending
---
I don’t think you can really compare a ruin nurse to fucking urban evasion. Ruin nurse will destroy 99% of teams, and urban evasion will let you go zoom when crouching. It doesn’t really add up
---
ribs... you want some?
---
Monto nuts in the distance
---
"Just don't use half of your power"
---
Yes, this is big brain time
---
I've seen all kinds of variations of this. Birds, hatch, loot boxes, lockers.
---
The only time I've ever seen these is when I'm playing kyf with random people cause I'm bored and the host has the shittiest internet connection on the face of the earth.
---
Similar to the dude above me who left the same comment 3 times within seconds because his internet is garbage. People like that shouldn't be hosting matches or playing games online.
---

---
The more you play the more you will also realize that not every survivor is the same and you will have to change strats based on how they play and they will do the same to you. But I always say that it’s best to play both sides evenly so that you can always have a sense of what the other side is thinking. You certainly don’t need to in order to excel at the role that you’re playing but understanding what the other player would see in a chase will help you to mind game more effectively imo.
---

---
An extra-dimensional alien is being added to this game and THAT guy will look out of place?
---

---
You do know that they have Bill from Left 4 Dead in the game, right?
---
Yes
---
Completely on accident on the locker jump but I’ll take it
---
Best pig build is whispers, enduring, spirit fury, and ruin. 
---
Whispers lets u know to crouch before they hear heartbeat. Im sure theres all sorts of super funtown perks u could run but a swf is gonna make u eat 200 pallets and 4 escape wo endfury.
---
Ghostface needs noed. Zomg why he has noed in kit!??  Because tryhard 4 man adrenawin is gonna run ur ass and make u their little bitch otherwise.  U have 3 perk slots.  Well u need ruin or CI or ur gonna get gen rushed hard as fuck.  U have 2 perk slots.
---
Vg
---
&gt; Kinda like scary movie but worse
---
I find this movie to be alot funnier than Scary Movie tbh
---
The games I played never used a PTB as far as I knew. And league had a PBE. So I was completely unfamiliar with the term PTB.
---
Had a game where the killer used my body to break the hatch,much like a hatchet. I was freaking out as it was the first time I had seen the game glitch. I thought it was some new kind of killer perk and couldn't wait to change over to killer and try it. Imagine my disappointment. Still cool to see though

The only "Demogorgen is OP" I want to see is from No0b3

Would like to know me too

It does nothing because it isn't put into regression state which is what happens when you kick a gen. I'm guessing surveillance will work with surge though when the demogorgon comes out.
---
And eat some gingersnaps
---
Great, now I’d have to hit skillchecks in my sleep too?
---
“OC”
---
I said exactly this on the forum. Hope theu listen to it
---
Yes, they can. That’s why no-blink nurse is such a memey thing to use and PWYF is somewhat mandatory on it. You’ll still max at 110% but that’s better than being outrun by anyone and everyone.
---
Edit: wtf was that typo
---
Eh, I feel like a lot of asymmetrical games are like that. I really like dbd because of the running/looping aspect. Most viable killers have tools to outplay survivors in chases.
---
No, he means 3.1.0.
---
The changes that happened in July.
---
People are just crying again.
---
Winchesters wouldn't work: no way Sam and Dean wouldn't kill the ever-living shit out of any of the killers
---
Sydney would be great tho
---
The time of the screenshot and live drawing isn't the same time I've waited. It times you out and kicks you back to the lobby at exactly 10 minutes if you haven't gotten into a match. I've been in queue for the past 26 minutes to try playing 1 match of killer. Kinda sick of playing survivor right now. Those queue times are around 2 minutes flat. The amount of times I've played killer on mobile is exactly 1 and that was with Billy.
---
Because this is /r/deadbydaylight, son! Every week we need something new to cry about, even if it's *not* new!
---
I knew a Jake Park in high school actually.
---
Except he was a rather douchey football player.
---
It isn't. I had to download a few files from google just to play the game.
---
Yeah I did, as the first time I got one on the hook there weren’t any auras so I knew they were close, and got a visual on one of them.
---
That being said; Ripley and Xenomorph and a werewolf
---
Like I REALLY want a werewolf
---
I mean... you're right but chill
---
hex: hilarious and original
---
Hate this meme.. so overused and mostly used incorrectly by kids or teens in every youtube comment.
---
I mean, I’m not defending stream sniping, but if you’re publicly broadcasting the fact you’re streaming, you’re gonna get stream sniped.
---
Power: Marionette
---
Spawn with 4 Marionette Dolls in the map. You can take control of a Doll for 10 seconds. Dolls can attach to generators to keep them from progressing
---
Dolls can also "trip" survivors when passing by it while not attached to a gen. So like .5 seconds of moving at 90% speed or 95% could possibly help not by ensuring hits but leading to less rotations on loops
---
While on a gen the doll must be extracted and then broken (10 seconds) whilst Dolls off gens can be destroyed by pressing M1 instantly
---
The Marionette can reassmble dolls by approaching them and interacting with them
---
I dont know it gives her some help with loops while adding a second objective but im not a game designer so its probably shit haha
---
&gt;Like a player losing their entire inventory of add ons after too many DCs in a one month period.
---
lol
---
Honestly when this occurs I actually hope to be first found because then at least I’m not gonna down the first 5 seconds into a game.
---
Really? Didn't know that. Yes. These changes need to be seen by dbd devs. Plague has potential. Dont waste it, devs!
---
No it has one upside - you saved like an hour one fall afternoon
---
Are you jealous that they're streamers or what?
---
A dying light one would be clever
---
Unfortunately I only started playing just before ghostface was released so I only got to play his old version for a little bit but he was fun as hell. The rework is amazing though. Made my own perk build geared towards his genporting that I just unlocked all the teachables for. So excited for the new chapter to drop :)
---
Lemme tell you, that might seem extreme, but i bet there won't be as many rage quits. Trying to think of solutions other than bans.
---
That’s some grade A cringe right there.
---
Thanatophobia and sloppy are basically worthless perks
---
Cake stun*
---
Its very unexpected, I will give them that
---
True true...
---
I have to disagree that you would’ve escaped. Again, the hatch took several seconds to open upon Dwight leaving. I don’t know this for sure as I’m to lazy to do the math, but I believe the killer would’ve made it to you within the time it took for it to open regardless.
---
And of course, you have to remember that thinking and reacting in the moment is far different from hindsight. He likely didn’t know what the right move was, went for what he believed was, and failed. Nobody’s perfect. Everyone makes a mistake every now and again.
---
I get your frustration, but compared to some of the flukes I’ve seen team mates make, this seems minor in comparison, and certainly not malevolent. I don’t want to sit here defending him because it’s just a game, but if your gonna go for a risky play like that you can’t expect your team to be superstars too. We can’t all be pros.
---
Find it amusing that you felt the need to point your repost out as an OC.
---
Its not in the description? Yt people usually put stuff like that there otherwise you gonna have to rip it or ask him
---
Don't keep us waiting
---
My guess is the last guy just went up to you to tbag and end the match. Did the last survivor attempt to run you at all? Its possible they saw their team trolling and doing nothing and wanted to just die. 
---
It sounds like they did a terrible job and failed miserably at trolling you. Why even be bothered if you beat them?
---
Okay is this just like a meme or joke? Or am I missing something? I'm brand new to the game. Is this based off of a manga and are they planning something for Netflix? I thought it was just an original game. Unless this joke just went over my head.
---
Send them proof (character select screens and bloodpoints so they know its legit) you might have made a typo in your cloud id an they credited it to someone else
---
The large hadron collider
---
Oh boy, just wait until you discover prayer beads. The survivors will practically be throwing themselves on hooks.
---
No, this is just meme format.
---
Last surv didn't run me around at all. No looping or anything. Hit him once, he kept t-bagging, hit him again and put him on the hook. 
---
Next time I get a set of survs like that I'll just slug all four and wait till they bleed out. I don't mind waiting upwards of five mins to let them die.
---
Amazing! Reminds me of an old 50s movie poster.
---
Oh damn! You're right. My apologies.
---
I feel bad for calling clown "captain fat fuck" now..
---
what's wrong with drinking milk tho
---
Only kids drink milk unless *inserts jerry face*
---
-rep and +rep are pointless as fuck
---
tbh, i hate Ochido, i dont see his videos. and its not my fault that matchmaking was shit and i get a rank 8 in my lobby, im rank 5 as survivor and rank 1 as killer. Also, explain to me: Where is the ear rape? where is the "DUD" thing here? Where is the tbag and flishlight flcik and me screaming baby killer?  For some reason edited videos with sound effects its a copy of ochido's video for some stereotype people and it frustrates me.
---
Okay I thought so but wanted to make sure lol thank you
---
Easier to progress out of purple ranks than green at resets.
---
Mine is BBQ, double points and see auras on hookings.
---
Discordance, I want to know when theres two or more on a gen.
---
Rancor, see auras when gens pop and play with my obsession and kill them if they actually pop all the gens.
---
last is Tremors so when carrying a survivor the gens are blocked and I'll know which one is being worked on.
---
The new mind breaker might take tremors spot because tremors has a cool down and I dont like the cooldown and it'll stop them from taking off as fast when im porting to their gen.
---
Uhh... sorry, but these are not my png render pictures
---
Except Mcote better
---
Are you the dwight?
---
No
---
Yeah. It’s like people think the shirtless Myers thing came out of nowhere. It was in the manga. We just want the game to match the source material.
---
Well yeah the killer can get them. I am not complaining about that. The whole looping thing just makes it seem loke they are not scared of me as killer. Which is literally the only reason I play the game.
---
And when I play survivor I had a blast trying to hide and get scared if they found me. But once I learned loop spots and got to rank 1, it got boring. The "game" is not as fun as the feeling of horror to me I guess.
---
Just a heads up if the Dwight ever ends up seeing this, im over it man, don’t take it personal, this was a heat of the moment reaction, and I did overreact.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cxx1ul/lithe_quick_and_quiet/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Not healthy to drink it every meal 8oz, I dunno how it is for females but milk causes males to pee in burst rounds because of the effects of milk.
---
It’s bad for females too every meal 8oz but for different reasons can’t remember
---
Only after they add it to the game
---
you know what slows down gens quite a bit? having 3 survivors working on them instead of 4. if i see someone missing skillchecks right where he was unhooked, im not gonna go to some random gen to kick it, im gonna go kill him so theres not 4 people working on gens at the same time
---
Not only can't they remove SWF, but they were review bombed for not adding it. And honestly, a multiplayer game you can't play with friends is a bad multiplayer game, anyway.
---
The issue is just that yeah, SWFs ARE going to use voice chat and that gives them an advantage the devs have done nothing to counteract. More BP would be nice, but it doesn't help at all with the gameplay side of things (or matter at all unless it's post-game due to the tiny caps).
---
I've always advocated a sort of mobility buff, like a more limited variant of Freddy's teleport (say between two distant but set points), just so it's hard for SWFs to keep track of the less mobile Killers, but there's very little benefit to Killers like Nurse and Spirit, who already have superior mobility options.
---
scary movie is very good, some of it doesn't really hold up- like you can tell it was made in the late 90s with it's humor but i still love 1-4
---
Only one person should look, and this person should know the spots
---
It can be a game changer but only at the end game. Paired with a box, you can 99 all the hooks, then drop when the gates are up to help anyone who gets caught at the end . Still, that means you get basically no points for being preemptive, other survivors could also drop your hooks for points not knowing your plan, or you have to drop early in case you can prevent someone else from getting hooked before gates...which while fun, gets you tunneled usually. 
---
If they want more people to use this perk, it needs an overhaul. Right now there are perks such as prove thyself which maxes out your gen score like we're gonna live forever maxes out total score. I think it would be nice to see sabo get a max out bold effect, and a buff such as hooks stay broken longer than breaking them with a box. Alternatively they could make it like hag trap limits and say you can sabo all the hooks you want like normal with regeneration on the hooks,  but the first hook you sabo is guaranteed to stay broken. Therefore if all survivors ran it, only 4 hooks would be gone from map and you would have to decide which one you want gone permanently.
---
Well, that's the community in a nutshell. "Says things that, if  they were acted upon, would make the game harder for me REEEEEEEE!"
---
Validity doesn't come into play at all, and it's impossible that someone would have an opinion that could compromise their main.
---
Milk is just not healthy or necessary to a human diet. Here is a peer reviewed article about the top sources of calcium (to keep our bones strong). https://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/foods-high-in-calcium/
---
I know people are going to be upset and offended, but we literally don’t need milk for anything.
---
Holy shit my head actually hurts. Congrats man the level of that Dwight's stupidity actually caused me psychic damage.
---
The changed it in 3.1.0 I think.
---
They released the original concept art for Megs’s perks?
---
&gt;trying to frame it as something it's not
---
When you are *this* stupid, you should just be banned from the sub. Sorry, but that's just hypocritical of you. 
---
If you still believe I use noed in the way that you think, then you are too young to read comments properly.
---
The fact of the matter is: It's in the game, and the Devs have stated that it is in a good spot.
---
 It's counterable, so you crying about it falls on deaf ears, because you only have yourself to blame. 
---
It poses a threat even, if the killer doesn't run it. M1 killers make good use of it at top ranks, and that nice, because we all don't want to always play nurse, spirit, and hillbilly. 
---
You can claim to be whatever rank, and use whatever perks, but that doesn't change the fact that it is used from time to time by many players.
---
If you haven't noticed, a lot of streamers play random, and community chosen builds. If noed happens to be in that build, are you going to call that player a baby, using a crutch!
---
Laugh my Fucking ass off.
---
When I see Hybrid panda, or Monto use noed, I'm not judging them.
---
You, are a judgemental kid, and you might never learn from your mistakes enough to be humble. You have no ability to see past your judgements, and no matter how I play, you won't see it. You think I use noed to get kills, but I told you I let them crawl out, or get themselves up. It's not for me as killer. It's for me as survivor in future games.
---
Now. I hope you get banned for being uncivil. Bye!
---
So, did you not read everything I said, or are you saying genrushing doesn't exist? Because that's the genrushiest thing I can describe, and you said that's not it as though something is.
---
But if genrushing isn't real, tunnelling isn't real.
---
Low key demogorgen looks traaaaash
---
Top tier post.
---
Hooks have a very red aura when nearby, you cant really miss it.
---
Pallets survivors have to always constantly look for the next pallet however. When a new map comes out and I dont know the pallet spawns, my brain is basically wired to when I see those bright yellow, red and blue objects among the dark and gloomy world, I instantly know it's a pallet. Yes people wouldnt have a problem either having it a different colour once they get used to it but it's completely fine having the pallets without textures, plus it's more work for the devs and might be harder for new players.
---
"I play dbd for the lore"
---
Stop trying to make the Creeper happen it's not going to happen
---
Exactly, if voice chat was intended, what even is the point of aura perks, which take up around a quarter of surv perks? How can you explain kindred being designed the way it is with voice comms in mind, or even some killer perks like knockout and insidious?
---
I only play this game for swf, because its a relaxing game to play with friends (oddly enough) but there is no doubt that it gives an unfair advantage randoms simply can't achieve and isn't referenced in game balance, it would be like the entity giving every survivor a walkie talkie lol
---
Jokes man

Ok dad

The netflix adaptation is supposed to be a blackwashed version, wrong use of meme
---
Ranking system right now is a mess but don’t give up on killer. Some games are definitely better then others. I go into a game thinking if I just get one person I’m happy.
---
He would, but I think there's a licensing issue involved with getting him.
---
Besides, DbD doesn't do ANYONE justice. The lore is that all of these iconic slashers are getting bullied by a fanfic spider-god and some neon-wigged douchebags 1/3rd their size. The only one keeping any real dignity is Michael, because sometimes he just kills Survivors himself with no offering and the Entity just has to deal with that.
---
Realism with all those cigars
---
Yikes. I was hoping to provide more evidence to a potential problem. I truly hope your post isnt a total asshole post
---
That’s my face print on her backside
---
Thats assuming you wont waste 3 gens time to get him off the game.
---
You’ll be fine. Feel free to update us on future bad matchmaking examples we can upvote with the dozens of other posts about it :)

I think you're on my Twitch merch store. Go to www.rorydiesalot.com and click on "Online Store." Then just scroll down!

i put haunted ground over iron maiden because not only can devour be more longer lasting than haunted but you can also mori at 5 tokens. i feel iron maiden is just too situational.
---
Thx for this!

There’s plenty of evidence, thank you for your contribution ❤️
---
That's not true fanatic eyes.
---
-legion main
---
Rank 17 with tier 3 BBQ, Ruin and 2 other teachable perks. What are you complaining about? You’re obviously experienced enough to have all that, you should be decent enough to take on that group.
---
Are you just jumping on the band wagon, really terrible or hoping to bully some baby survivors?
---
Fair enough. When your right, your right.
---
Honestly, I thought I could make it back for you when he turned around, that’s why I stood there. Not sure, what I was thinking exactly, kinda panicked a bit.
---
We all want just want to be a hero for somebody, no?
---
No, you're strawmanning. Don't try to play assertion bias. I have a problem with design exploits in a poorly-designed game. Obviously SWFs will voice chat (although it's still an unfair advantage given by a third-party program), but it's that next-level coordination where they maximize their advantage from that that I take issue with, and while it may be "well-coordinated," it's also "cheating."
---
The fact that the devs got bullied into adding SWF and can't figure out how to balance it doesn't mean they intended for detection perks to all be shared and Bond to be a passive.
---
I mean he is from England
---
I am inevitable
---
and I am.... thinking we did a pretty good job so far
---
r/uselessnobody
---
&gt;Yikes. I was hoping to provide more evidence to a potential problem. I truly hope your post isnt a total asshole post
---
There was so much "evidence" these posts became against sub rules and are being deleted by mods (thankfully).
---
I’m rank 15 and level 16 on doctor and this keeps happening to me. I have no bloody characters yet. The survivors aren’t rude at least.
---
Yes, but many Killers would dodge SWFs because they don't want to be bullied, which kind of argues a point in itself.
---
Fuck those people honestly. Pure greed ruined a game with great potential.
---
Awww

This happens to me way too often, mostly resulting in a "gg ez grab".
---
Wait, you have a long queue time as Survivor? It's like 30 seconds every time I play, but I play solo.
---
3 gens in the first 45 seconds of the game is literally impossible, and doing gens solo is more efficient
---
Tell me, would you rather have 1 gen done in 45 seconds, or 3 done in 70?
---
Dying Light builds are pretty damn strong IMO. I don’t think people like to run it because it really requires you to tunnel. Definitely an unfun perk and I understand that. But damn, immediately taking someone out of the game and getting an action penalty on top of it? Really gnarly to play against.
---
yea i don't get it neither… what the fuck with your actual rank and all those perks you unlocked OP ? I mean yes the matchmaking at the moment is at his worst but in your case there is an additional issue
---
Cursed with three really good friends, that is!
---
Most of the time is at the discretion of the Killer.
---
Sometimes if I felt like I had a good game and I'm in a good mood. I let the last survivor live
---
Or 
---
If I feel like the last survivor was screwed over in a certain way either by a particular farmer or by a Hatch camper
---
ur welcum sweety xoxo

Wait am I getting r/whoosh ed or are you the Dwight?

Inner Strength looks busted. Second Wind just seems like a great way to tell your team you don't trust them. Everything else seems meh.

Hah, good to know! xD
---
The gulf between mobile Killers and standard movements keeps widening.
---
LOL, fortunately, this have been pretty easy to draw. The most complicated part was probably Meg's outfit and coloring. Thanks for the compliment, though!
---
It'd be bad for business, yeah.
---
Jason won't happen because of legal disputes even his own game is being affected by it.
---
I know, the post doesn't say who could realistically be added. Just who do you want to see.
---
Ohhh, Daddy Ghost Face is coming. 😱🔪

Hop in a locker with DS, maybe Head On. Killer has no good options.

Lmaoo

Holy shit I fucking hate typing on mobile(r/FoUnDtHeMoBiLeUsEr)

Who is the huntress sleeping with? It looks like jake

Oblivious? Is that enough?

I'm a legion main now before you hate let me tell you why...

He looks dope
---
It is... Just get closer and stand up, its the same thing, i do that instead of dashing, its more efective
---
Is this the movie shriek
---
I mean I won't cut it out for possible future if legal things get finished up with but I just like to think of possilities that are likely withing the next year or 2 and I have a feeling a lot of next year will be some original killers
---
oh.. :'(
---
Don't give em the stick!
---
More like CAKE Denson
---
Tiny Meat Gang
---
Bing bong
---
Right?  They already tried this in a ptb and discarded it.  IIRC, they take away sacrifice emblem points if you hang around but some killers definitely don't care about that
---
This is literally a game where the main objective is for the killer to stop people from playing by killing them. It's a competitive arena-mode video game where there is no option for casual play, only ranked; Of course people are going to kill you instead of playing nice.
---
just don't tunnel then. Also you're using 3 whole perks to make this combo work, 1 of which is single use and only has certain times it can be used, another which is limited in use and needs a previous action to activate, and another which is an exhaustion perk.
---
It's ok for perks to have synergy, that doesn't automatically make them broken.
---
no it's shit since you waste a lot of time saboing for almost no result.
---
If you'd just spend all this time fixing gens that would have been better for the team.
---
There are way too much hooks too close from each other to use sabotage for something else than farming BP
---
It got deleted. Just type in DBD in communities and there is one with 40k members
---
Trapper, Wraith, Billy, Nurse, Huntress. They are all of the killers that come with the base game. Hag and Doctor are seperate. All other killers are just like ps4 and have their own respective chapter or paragraph
---
Unrealistic - when she looked at him it shouldn't have broken his night shroud and he would have downed her even if he missed that attack.
---
Um. Yes and no. It works both as a game-stalling tool (they decode 25/50/75) gen, and you can pretty much nullify it until the totem is broken.
---
And yeah, in the late game, having only 1 gen to get the last one off, might be quite good too. 
---
I would say it is mid game-late game ish
---
Damn that’s an F. Thanks for the reply
---
I had this before. I had opened the gate at the other side of the map but decided to save some guy, nobody had escaped yet but the other gate was also open. I run to where the guy is hooked, get one-shot by Michael's tier-3 and all 3 teamates fuck right off.
---
You’re set for life
---
Does it shut off automatically after 30 seconds?
---
Like yeah the only thing I would change is make it so that the totem doesn’t activate until one gen is disabled
---
10/10 bloodlusting done right
---
They changed that a while ago, people can depip below 15 again. Not sure if being unable to depip past 15 was even intended or a bug that devs went along saying they changed.
---
Hillbilly, Wraith, Trapper, Nurse and Huntress are free. Meg, Claudette, Dwight, Jake, Nea and David for survivors are free (I believe, someone correct me if I'm wrong). Over on Humble Bundle for PC all dlcs and the base game are currently on sale for a few more days aswell.
---
Killing isn't the issue, effectively preventing someone from playing in the first place is. Especially before rank 7, there is simply no reason for a killer to do it if they aren't hot garbage. Win by being an asshole or win by not being an asshole, the choice is always easy for me.
---
Fair point. I was just trying to point out that it's not useless though. Unlike something like slippery meat or left behind.
---
&gt;Dwight: Guys, I'm trying to sneak around...but the clap of my asscheeks keeps ~~alerting~~ attracting the Killers.
---
fixed it for you
---
I was dying for someone to post this, actually. xD
---
Survivor: worst deja vu...the gens all have giant lights above them and are very easy to find. Except for maybe on lerys. Especially the closest ones so the perk is very useless. 
---
             
---
                Best in my opinion is borrowed time. The ability to get super clutch saves is very strong, especially in the endgame. 
---
Killer: worst hangman's trick. It may possible be useful if you are playing a 4 man sabo squad, but the chances of that are very few and far between. Plain and simple, people dont sabo hooks that often and if the do, you just slug. Pretty useless perk imo
---
          Best bbq, it gives you very solid knowledge with the locations of survivors and with the added BP bonus it makes it even more viable and strong. Brutal strength is a close second for me because pallet stuns are inevitable and the ability to get back into the chase 20 percent quicker is very crucial very often.
---
True, but generators have always helped to block survivor auras, provided it's possible to put the gen between the survivor working on it and the hooked survivor.
---
« Ban isn’t a solution, so we’re gonna reset the user’s account » That will work!
---
Flashlight-clicking intensifies. Gotta love a chest stand-off! One time and me and someone else were both trying to get the basement chest and while we were stood pointing at each other a Myers just stuck into the basement and stood there starring at us. Let's just say a basement party ensued.
---
as so do I...
---
I find leader is good, and plunderers instinct can help you out if you’re too far away to find other survivors cause you can get a good Merlot when you’re in a pinch
---
I like the way you think
---
I remember seeing something like this a long time ago.
---
https://youtu.be/OAOSHmwoOyI
---
I hope the three of you had a great time!
---
You mean the survivor that was just unhooked ? Or if he's unhooked by someone that went in the second phase you would hunt them ?
---
4/5 times yeah
---
Please show me when and how they got "bullied into adding swf" and how they "can't figure out of to balance it". 
---
It's balanced enough, you can win against it, they literally said they keep it in mind while making stuff. You're trying to frame this as some sinister third party program, but i can play the framing game too by saying you're calling talking to your friends cheating. You're calling coordinating with your team in a competetive team game "cheating". The devs are cool with it, most of us are cool with it, it's fine.
---
Also, assertion bias? Did you just make that up? I'm pretty familiar with cognitive biases and logic fallacies and I've both neither hewrd of ot, nor could i find it mentioned anywhere
---
Edit: also, i didn't ask, please explain to me how my restatement of your point isn't literally the same thing if you just follow it to its logical conclusion. I didn't misrepresent anything, you described a well coordinated team
---
Loved this movie, this is obviously where Cote got his inspiration.
---
It'll never happen but Alan Wake

Ho-lee-jesus how did I not see this
---
(I meant to spell it like that to emphasize on the "Lee")
---
Year 3 gift i think
---
The other two players invited themselves into the basement when they realised we'd been hooked on the party. We all had a killer of a time, especially Myers.
---
Now this is comedy
---
David
---
What is tunneling?
---
I mean, that's complete viable, as explained in another comment by me, but it doesn't make it less annoying for the survivor, if you know what I mean.
---
Killer best : bbq and ruin
---
Killer worst : hangman's trick, overwhelming presence, monstrous shrine. 
---
Survivor best: adrenaline, DS
---
Survivor worst : left behind, deja vu.
---
I'd love to see more original killers but boy is it depressing to grab trapper, equip his bolo machete, and let out a deep sigh everyday
---
nah
---
Death by snu snu
---
That punishes the killer in a sense though because the more hooks they get the more emblem and blood points they get
---
Yeah but if you put the best survivors against the best killer, and the killer plays a low tier killer the survivors will always win
---
"I'll get you bitch!"
---
It's not the hand we care about haha
---
Just watched it back real slowly. You would’ve got hatch if other surv hadn’t been an idiot.
---
Dwight is a man like any other, with needs and desires and three luscious daddies ready to take care of him.
---
Pretty much! xD I've been working on these for weeks.

---
It should be worse considering it will limit players to play on their own server. If there aren't enough players in your server during a low population at a certain time of the day, it should take even longer to find games. 
---
We'll have to see how high is the ping people get from playing in a server that isn't theirs.
---
For killers, definitely. As a killer you wont be able to play outside your region because the input lag will be unbearable. Playing in your region during low population time will result in facing the same people over and over if you even get a match.
---
He is looking for locker
---
Im glad they got Freddy back to closer to how awesome he was in the comics. Grwat crossover issue when the manga writer wanted to bring fredboi in from the west.
---
Hmm, it looks like it might just have been overloaded. I checked it and it's working fine now. If you're on mobile, try scrolling down. If you still have trouble accessing it, just let me know!
---
Yep yep.  It was tried years ago at this point, and like most nice things, a bunch of people immediately figured out a way to abuse it to troll the killer.  Whenever there's enough new players that don't know the history, this suggestion makes its way around again like an urban legend. 
---
  
---
Game devs learned this way back in early Mmos... If you introduce a system that CAN be abused, it WILL be abused (usually with the following ideology - early and often, before it turns bannable).
---
No most killers need some add ons to help them out like Micheal with teir 3 infinite to put more pressure on their back and insta saw for bubba with play with your food
---
This post maybe, but I've seen multiple posts talking about these nerfs as though they are upcoming
---
Oh, I remember a time that I was innocent, before I knew about r/dbdgonewild. :(
---
It's really hard to get 9 kills in a game, unless you're playing nurse

---
I like this idea!
---
I'm not gonna lie, if I do this, you're probably getting the Wicked Wares Jake...
---
For me, it just kinda feels like a waste of a perk if I don't get to use it, especially if I'm able to get myself off and the killer has already walked away.
---
*Laughs in Git Gud*

This isn’t the way practicing works.

Lag affects both sides. Idk why you survivor mains feel so superior
---
My cousin depipped to 17.  He was 14 for a bit but sucks pretty bad still and I saw him go from 16 to 17 with my own eyes.  Not sure if It's a bug or not.
---
I agree with you. Whats worse, is they gave it back to streamers who lost it and people who are connected to devs. I even have copies of old files where i have the legacy, but it doesnt matter cause saves were converted to the cloud and not local, right around that time.
---
Bold of you to assume I'm a survivor main
---
Are you
---
I recommend saving 80% of this amount and wait until the new bloodweb arrives to start spending. Until then, if you want to continue playing normally, spend 200k and save the rest. Save 1.000.000 again and repeat.
---
What's everyones opinion on Ghost Face by the way? To me, he's just too similar to Myers with a crouch ability. Is there a plan to make him more unique or is he good where he is? I don't own him and from my experience he isn't played a lot on Xbox so I don't get a chance to form a first hand opinion on him.
---
I would say make it an obsession perk and work in both phases. Or like a monstrous shrine type perk but only works on obsession. So hooking the obsession gives them a 9% or so faster entity progression. Pair it with that ghost face perk that changes obsessions after they get unhooked and it could be solid. Pretty cool idea you have though
---
So play Nurse then
---
How do you catch anyone without phasing as a 110% MS killer? O.o
---
I love this. &lt;3
---
It's not off the grid, that's exactly what it is, it has been announced and known that is the reasoning behind it
---
&gt; See this man is an academic of the highest kind, we need ~~sexy~~ Wicked Wares Jake and we need it now!
---
fixed
---
Ghostface is smaller and makes less noise than Michael most of the time you can hear him breathing before he gets close enough to yank
---
See that does make sense on paper but for example if you had a person who was the worlds best nurse/legion vs the worlds best survivor team the killer will be able to finish Chase's much faster with nurse than with legion because unlike legion who has a stall/tracking perk the nurse with her movement Power wins outright
---
I think the dedicated servers are supposed to help with the matchmaking.
---
I much more prefer the new one, but okay
---
David king/bill. King first to get "we're going to live forever" then bill to get "borrowed time". This gets you a lot more bp and helps the team vs aggressive killers/ endgame save

The only bad thing about this is it looks like the game ended too fast. If bad matching happens I always play with my food as killer. As survivor I will try to make the game last longer as well, why leave a match like this when you can farm the killer with such a small amount of bps? Everyone here could have left with 29,000 bps.... The game just knew they suck and I guess that's why it match made like that lmao, jk.
---
assuming you're looking to purchase one to win, spirit is just better in general, but if you want to BP farm doc is probably a safer bet. Overall, spirit is easier and better though
---
you can rank rest past 16, but you can’t depip past 16
---
spirit is better
---
docs power is treatment mode, you switch from weapon to treatment by holding m2, my holding m1 in treatment you release a wave of electricity, hitting survs with this levels up madness, it has 3 tiers. among other things tier 3 madness makes you scream, unable to work on gens or heal, makes skillchecks very hard. shocking a survivor makes them unable to vault for like 0.5 seconds.
---
survivors can snap out of madness 3 but only madness 3. madness 1 and 2 are weaker effects. add ons change him a lot. you can also level up madness by walking around in treatment mode, but you’re slower. 
---
perks are overwhelming presence which deteriorated items faster when in TR
---
monitor and abuse, which gives you a FOV change when out of chase and -8 TR when out of chase too. it also gives you +8 TR ( on basic TR, so 40 meters for most killers) when in chase. probably worst perk for doctor since you want a big TR to tier up madness quicker.
---
and overcharge which gives gens you kicked a very hard skill check.
---
he’s quite fun but can get bullied very easily and has both a high skill floor and skill ceiling.
---
spirit is also quite hard, but her power is way more basic.
---
when holding m2 you enter spirit mode, where you move faster and are invisible. you leave a husk behind. you have a limited usage of it and it recharges so you can’t really spam it. she’s an a tier or s tier arguably, since she can shut down loops by either faking the faze walk, by holding still, or actually faze walking. she’s great to counter unsafe pallets. she’s also got pretty good mobility.
---
her perks are: haunted grounds: it spawns 2 hex totems that when broken give exposed effect (1 shot downs) for up to 60 seconds. great to protect other hex’s like ruin or devour hope
---
spirit fury allows you to break pallets when stunned by them after breaking a few pallets, goes well with enduring since you still suffer from the stun
---
rancor lets you see where survs are after gen pops (scream not aura) but obsession can see your aura after gen pops too. after exit gates are powered it gives you noed on your obsession and a morí too. i hope this helped
---
i would recommend spirit but just cause she’s more meta, watch gameplay and decide for yourself
---
&gt;I think the dedicated servers are supposed to help with the matchmaking.
---
How?

It might increase your chances of getting ovarian cancer. However, IIRC, it depends on a ton of different factors and not all milk actually increases risk.

okay idk how I got there lol. thanks!

"Ghst Fae"
---
I don’t thinks the 9% progression is good (it will be a copy cat of the monsterous shrine). The difference is that the unhook animation is longer, and the hook still progresses during the animation. So, the unsafe unhooks will be much harder to do of the people in the struggle faze.

It is made to make unhooks harder. Not to make people die faster

Wait, but Steve is everyone’s Mom, why would you ask him for him

im just gonna go ahead and keep drinking it thanks for the nerd review though
---
They can monitor stuff better and fix it from there?
---
Idk.
---
--- No one
---
Nooooo not the final distortion stack!
---
Whenever there are only 2 survivors left, and there is that pause where they both just want to hide and not work on gens then whichever one I find doing a generator first will likely get the hatch from me, while the one that just wanted to keep hiding and let their teammate die will not get mercy.
---
btw if you’re new-ish (since it’s your first 9k shards) hmu and i can give you some tips

lool yeah had to edit out me whining over losing my last distortion stack

I would like to hear

they need to get rights, and rn they’re working on a lot.

Haven't got Spirit yet. I got the special edition on console which came with doc. He is good for bloodpoints farming but not the easiest for ranking and getting consistent wins. I was maining him til I bought Legion and is one of the more fun killers to play as for me. He has some game changing add ons like the interview tape which can pretty much defend every gen and totem from the center of the map. Monitor and abuse is very useful for certain builds since it shrinks your terror radius for stealth until you are in chase, then it grows it. Overcharge can be useful if coupled with other perks like huntress lullaby and is generally effective on its own at lower ranks (20-15). Overwhelming presence doesn't seem very useful, it just wears out item of survivors near you a little quicker. If it were buffed to like 50% it could be useful but at the moment, it's like 10% and not that great. Spirit has spirit fury for people who take a lot of pallet stuns and haunted ground which works great to protect other hexes and possibly get some one shot downs. She is also considered on of the easiest killers to dominate with once you get good with her. She may be my next iri purchase, but I'm also considering plague for her perks corrupt intervention and infectious fright.
---
Eta: the skill in using doc is being able to effectively switch between powers, his shocking ability can stun survivors for a second through walls and when timed properly, stops survivors from dropping a pallet or vaulting a window in a loop, you do that and then switch to your attack mode to get free hits. That combines with the madness tiers that increasingly cause survivors to reveal their position by you being in proximity to them, an using your shock. When they are in tier 3 of madness, they can't work on generators and constantly reveal themselves until they heal their madness back down to tier 2. These mechanics help stall the game and increase your bloodpoints.

I tried posting it there but it wouldn’t let me
---
Trust me, they're all talking about 3.1.0 from what I've seen. Misinformation is a hell of a thing.
---
Yea pretty much this, there are far too many many people playing killers in this game in comparison to survivors, these killers most likely waited for a very long time and matchmaking decided to put what survivors it had in queue at that moment to play against.
---
They are definitely doing something right now. I know it’s probably to help with the dedicated servers and future matchmaking but it’s a nightmare. I’m rank 3 Survivor and I haven’t had a teammate or Killer higher than rank 7 in 3 days, they are normally green ranks. And i’m rank 7 Killer and 90% of my games no Survivor is above rank 12.
---
I am not able to use discord right now
---
Slap on a good pair of headphones and spirit will almost always land you an easy 4K
---
&gt;They can monitor stuff better and fix it from there? Idk.
---
How do you instantly fix low population? 
---
"idk"
---
You said in such an affirmative way I thought you were onto something.
---
P2P connection allows killers to find survivors from anywhere in the world. The closer they live from that killer, the better the ping. If there are enough survivors available the same rank as the killer, the better matchmaking you get. If there aren't enough people the same rank available, we see matchmaking anomalies just so people can even play, reducing queue time. 
---
With servers connection it will limit survivors and killers per server, reducing the overall population even more. If anything, matchmaking should be even worse and as a killer you won't be able to avoid it because changing servers means playing with more lag input. As a survivor you still can change a few servers until you get something around 150ms.
---
what what what
---
I'd say that he diddles kids is a rather well known fact.
---
I don't get this whole killer tier system. I got to rank 1 easy with the pig, if anything her ability to stealth makes it impossible for survivors to win if you know how to use it. 
---
I find it hard to play non stealth killers after her. I never use ambush either, except for short loops.
---
That game is horrible even tho I'm a Jason fan
---
Because matchmaking fucking sucks

I hate this and everything it stands for

Billy is fun, as you're fast, have an insta-down, and can do some cool curve plays when you get a little better.

*cries in remake leatherface*
---
Nurse and Wraith are pretty cool
---
You might get a alpha pack
---
His real name is Danny Johnson tho.
---
We fucking get it
---
Wait... are you suggesting that matchmaking is broken right now?
---
From time to time I see this argument when this subject comes up, and it never ceases to amaze me how fucking stupid some people could be thinking this is relevant in any way shape or form.
---
Is this the reason behind the abnormally long waiting times on Xbox too?
---
The killer would be able to instantly teleport to any part of the map. It has no terror radius for 10 seconds, and no red stain. Also when it teleports the teleportation has a between medium and long cool down. It has to teleport outside of a certain distance of a player, and if it gets seen for half the amount of time it takes to break Ghostface out of the the stealth state, then the weeping angel is stuck in place for 10 seconds. The killer is as slow as the nurse when moving normally but for 10 seconds after teleporting it moves as fast as the spirit when using her power. Also when a survivor is in the process of breaking the weeping angel out of it’s power state they get no noise or visual notification of their progress.
---
-this power might seem op at first but if you get caught and frozen you will have to move on to a different survivor because they will too on guard to let you get another chance.
---
Quentin needs a face rework please
---
It's not very buggy. There's bugs now and then but overall it's stable, and dedicated servers are coming in the next few weeks which will make the game as a whole much more stable as well. The game is also more balanced right now than it's ever been. I have just as much fun playing killer or survivor.
---
As for the community, it can get very toxic, but if you just ignore people you'll be fine.
---
I think we did uhhh.. pretty good job so far!
---
And black hood as the killer
---
She does. You have to be in a chase sometime during the dash (even at the very end) to get it though, and you get 100 points.
---
The frame rate issues are being focused on this year, There are quiet a few bugs, but nothing currently that really bothers me (other then ones that have been in the game for ages). 
---
Both killers and survivors can have equally the amount of fun, most of those claims where from 2017-2018 when survivors where SUPER broken, Things are p balanced in terms of just 1v4 without addons or items.
---
Clam slamming
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
That is kinda the point. Maybe the numbers should be increased. However, I did not want to do another exhaustion speed perk, so I came up with this, and to make it relatively balanced
---
I like this pairing.
---
I like to chill in the lonely killer discord , trouble is at times you get mic spam parties who scream and ruin your immersion but definitely a good idea
---
I had someone dc because I was looting that chest and wouldn't get off it for them.
---
&gt; I'm going off of something I heard.
---
What exactly did you hear? Was it just "dedicated servers will improve matchmaking" or whoever said that gave the reason why it would improve matchmaking?
---
You forgot about bloodlust and probably speed burst
---
Can't be arsed to read it though.
---
Haven’t you heard? Since his rework, Freddy is actually pretty good.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cxy661/deliverance_isnt_working/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
For killers? The main reason thats taking too long (my guess) is that theres a massive amount of people wanting to play Killer. Its easy for survivors to find 1 person to play against. Its harder for a killer to find 4 people around that rank to play with. 
---
I think BHVR said fuck the rank algorithm to help queue times.
---
I don’t have ttv in name but I sure as hell do reboot the game if a Mori is played. Last night I versed a Ghostface with an Ebony Mori, NOED, Ruin, his best add-ons and he got no kills and 1 hook lol. And I teabag killers who play Moris, there’s like no reason. I solo q a lot and when i SwF we don’t bring the best shit so it’s so overkill
---
Wow, he'd be perfect. But I would be forced to use up all my flashlights. :(
---
Wicked Wares jake is the neon 80's outfit Jake right? If so I completely agree
---
Currently, it doesn't have any game-breaking bugs. But, it has before, such as a perk that mistakenly gave survivors a 25% boost to generator speed and another that broke two perks completely which were Dead Hard and Sprint Burst. 
---
Yes, the community is woeful. 
---
The game is imbalanced, yes. Low-rank survivors are atrocious and barely manage to get a generator done even against a noob killer. But, as you go up the ranks, survivors become the power role and can bully non-meta killers. The killers that are actually viable at higher ranks are busted, except the Hillbilly. 
---
I'd totally get this game if you're interested, but don't expect perfect balancing.
---
I’ve never heard of this humble bundle. I’m gonna check it out now.
---
I had a bug where spirit body blocked me then left me there I picked myself up and was running like I had sprint burst the whole time. I let her kill me cause it was unfair but i dont know how it happened. I play on xbox
---
it’s a casual game. balance isn’t n1 and although there are bugs, it’s playable
---
What’re you on about this meme took me 4 hours to complete /s

Thank you!

It's been my main game for a year now and it's super fun and addicting. Add some people when you start and just have fun.
---
Sidney Prescott! It is a travesty that we got Ghost Face but not her. :(
---
Spirit with prayer beads
---
Was gonna comment Quentin is just a fucked up Jonathan
---
You can find them on my website, www.rorydiesalot.com!
---
If you're sincerely looking to improve as killer I'd swap out NOED for Ruin.  That perk won't teach you a thing about playing killer it only exists to get a kill when you otherwise probably wouldn't have gotten one at that point.  Teaches loads of bad habits regarding gen pressure and decision making during chases that are difficult to break.  You'll become a better player faster learning to play without it.  It'll force optimal decisions.  Ruin will help slow the game down or serve as a distraction long enough to get the ball moving and try and get some momentum in your games.  
---
Also my condolences for the matchmaking.  It's pretty busted at the moment.  Hopefully you get appropriate matchups soon.

My killer is like rank 16 cause I don’t play killer, I’m planning on just stalking people as Myers or teleporting around as spirit. Maybe hooking everyone once or twice, but no killing

i was actually watching Tell It Animated's video of The Evolution of GHOSTFACE/SCREAM last night ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFuDlpO-zVU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFuDlpO-zVU)), and it showed Ghostface's portrayal in Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th. i looked it up on YouTube and found that clip and immediately wanted to make a DbD-inspired video, although i can imagine the gameplay similarities have been referenced plenty before
---
&gt; It should help even out the queue times. Most people play Killer due to how much easier it is to get Blood Points, but if most people have everything unlocked then they don't really care so much about which side they play and can just play what they want to. 
---
Actually, that would make EVEN MORE people play the killer, as survivors rarely reach those caps and killers are usually the ones who get 2-4 categories maxed out
---
Just a bad baysitter
---
Idontwannagobackitstoosoondontremindmeofitagainpls
---
Well they were useful in like uh.. 2015
---
Your knight concept is also neat, and seeing a castle map would be breathtaking ♡u♡
---
that would be great. also, they should finally realize that without a perk that incrseases the speed of gaining brutality or sacrifice points, each Hit event should be at least 350, not just 300, as well as sacrifice events giving more. the easiest one to get 8k each game is brutality when u have distressing perk
---
Or it’s fine up until exit gate time and NOED + Blood Warden activates. I’ve had a couple of games with at least NOED where the game really begins and the lag begins, but most of the time only 1 person gets killed as they are camped for the whole end game collapse.

Head on gang, bringing horror back to dbd

Dude, you cited a website that **sells fucking DETOX kits**. Holy shit, they still sell this pseudo-science these days?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
&gt;Here is a peer reviewed article
---
By who? Who peer-reviewed this rubbish?
---
If you do your research, then you can find the author of your source is Dr. Edward Group. *WHO ISN'T A REAL MEDICAL DOCTOR.* 
---
"He holds a degree from Texas Chiropractic College, but although he lists five other higher-ed institutions on LinkedIn, Oliver points out that he didn't graduate from any of them; when pressed for comment by Last Week Tonight, **he admitted to not having an undergraduate degree.**"
---
This is the same level as "vaccines = autism".
---
https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Edward_Group
---
This dude is the definition of Quackery. He is selling scam products that have no factual evidence to back up their work, and you are falling for it. I'd never think I'd find this absolute garbage on a gaming Reddit.
---
Dear anyone who read what u/Mahgrets said, please ignore them. In fact, ignore me as well. But please think for yourself and do some research before some buffoon on the internet tells you what is and what isn't.
---
-------------------------------------------------------------------
---
Doing some more research on this guy because this *seriously* pissed me off as a premed student.
---
One of the products he sells on his website is called "**Oxy-powder**". He claims his product "**uses the power of oxygen to safely and effectively melt away the compaction from your small intestine, large intestine, and colon.**"
---
If you go to the back of the label, there is a little warning from the *Food and Administration* organisation stating that this product has **not** been evaluated. This is required by law if the product is to be intended for diagnosis, treatment, cure or prevention of any disease. Because this product is utter bullshit, of course it's not been evaluated and passed as medicine.
---
If you look closer you can see that the tablets are basically 100% Magnesium Oxide (with a little bit of plant rubbish casing). 
---
Do you know what magnesium oxide does to you? It makes you shit. This fucker is selling you **laxatives** at **ten times** the price of what a normal pharmacist would sell you.
---
There's no "**toxin cleansing**", there's no "**faecal compaction melting**". What does "**using the power of Oxygen**" even mean? Is he trying to say oxygen will react and oxidize with your gut? THAT'S CALLED RUSTING! You don't want fucking rust in your bowels.
---
It just causes water to enter your bowels via osmosis and severely dehydrates you. YOU ARE PAYING TO GET THIRSTY.
---
-------------------------------------------------------
---
Why has this upset me so much? I think I'm going to go have a cup of milk and relax for a bit.
---
Side note; u/Mahgrets I'm not angry at you. Sorry if this post makes it seem like I'm *shitting* on you (*see what I did there?*). It's not your fault that you feel inclined to believe in "Global Healing Center". In reality, a lot of people do. People like Edward Group (who doesn't deserve to be called Dr) are professional con artists and make a lot of money this way.
---
Over here in the UK and most parts of Europe, people like Edward and his business are not allowed to directly advertise to potential patients. We have laws to prevent this sort of abuse to maintain patient trust in the medical profession. Unfortunately, America's healthcare is more of an industry rather than a social right.
---
----------------------------------------------------------------------
---
Edit: Just sent an email to the company. I'm pretending to be a customer who is interested in buying oxy-powder, but is worried about the oxidization affecting their sensitive stomach. I've asked if it is safe for cases like me to use and how it works. I'll post their reply here if anyone is interested in how they attempt to explain this bullshit.
---
Y would you put yourself on the hook tho?
---
Trapper is so fun. You are chasing someone and then run towards a trap and you get so excited
---
But you don’t improve when you have much much better players tea bagging and flashlight blinding you... atleast give me green ranks
---
Shout-out to Down, keeping us updated on the teabagging sitch.
---
You know killers host the game. So the ping is determined mainly by the killers.
---
I like trapper a lot. It feels nice leading people into a trap. However, there are games where you can't even trap a single person. Those high level trappers are fun to watch. The mind gaming involved with that playstyle is fun to watch and play.
---
I don't own him either, unfortunately, but it seems like a lot of people say his stalking mechanic and the ability to stop it by looking at him is really inconsistent, so he basically just becomes an M1 killer with the ability to crouch. People also say the add-ons that shrink his detection range are really good, though. I'd be really interested in seeing if they rework him and change his power up like they did with Freddy (and holy shit, I can't wait until they fix Leatherface).
---
Honestly I am being whiny but I think he is a little OP. Maybe it’s just bad luck but everytime I face a Ghost Face I get destroyed. 
---
Im a respectable lvl 11 and maybe it’s just bad luck but still. Id like input if anything has advice or something
---
Initially, but in the long run the majority of people playing would be able to play whichever.
---
It's also not like they couldn't take under-performing perks and throw on some BP increases as well. Technician giving double Objective BP would actually allow people to justify running the perk and would help combat Ruin in a way.
---
When did I say solo que wasn't a thing? I just said they have a strict disadvantage that isn't intended in the games design, I said nothing about player count
---
And your point on "pinpointing locations" is null, we're talking about high levels of coordinated play, not people who don't even know what/where the meat tree is, seeing as they probably don't get much out of swf anyways.
---
My team has completely cast aside aura perks which makes more room for other useful perks just because we have map awareness and comms, and you can't even tell me kindred has any kind of place in a 4 man swf group, its main purpose is to let you know if other survs are unhooking and if the killer is camping, something any team with voice chat can simply say to each other. Our argument is that there is nothing wrong with playing with friends but it was never intended to work that way by behaviour because of the games actual design, and there is no way for them to balance swf with randoms because it will either require voice chat, which they explicitly stated is not a favourable solution, or more perk slots which swf won't need to use and essentially gives them more perks to choose from by reducing the ones they need
---
I mean , the perks are good for solo maybe not what youd want but still good
---
Yes, I'm aware that it's from 3.1 lol
---
Well, he'd have to stay small. That's the character. He'd have to talk as well although they may not want to pay Brad Dourif his fee. 
---
Powers: 
---
Possible that he cannot vault at all BUT to compensate he can completely take away a vault via whatever. He uses voodoo to take away the window vault like a buffed Bamboozle. 
---
If he's short he'd have to be stealthy. I'd prefer normal movement speed (he can book it and run like a normal human when needed in the movies). So, lower terror radius but normal movement speed where the tradeoff is that it's harder for him to see survivors. Another possibility is that you affect the red glow and make it much harder to see and not have as much on him. So, normal terror radius but because of his height and different glow you wouldn't know exactly where he is or how exactly to juke him at a jungle gym.  
---
He can booby trap chests and lockers. You could work in some lore that he escaped from a toy factory and the chests are like a present.  If survivors open a booby trapped chest or locker a bunch of shrapnel explodes and injures them. Possibly booby trap generators. It would kind of look like this:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nID1enI2xW8
---
Mori: stabs them to death or uses a Yo-Yo to strangle them (since he was a strangler when he was human and used a Yo-Yo to kill in part 3). 
---
The big thing about the character they have to get right is that he has to talk. They fucked up Freddy by not securing Robert Englund's likeness and by not having him talk I hope they don't do the same for Chucky when they eventually get him.
---
Tangent: Brad Dourif is an amazing actor (a lot of people forget he was nominated for an Oscar) and IS the voice of Chucky. No offense to Mark Hamil. When they finally add him (with another perk that affects gens) just fucking pay Brad Dourif his fee to do the voice. It's not Chucky without Brad Dourif. The man is almost 70, he's not going to be around forever, don't fuck up by being cheap Behavior.
---
As a killer, is there any way to prevent survivors from lagging?
---
The ".ttv" at the end of your name is exactly like you shouting wherever you go, "HEY COME OVER HERE AND GIVE ME VIEWS" which is why you always want to clench your ass the whole game.
---
Honestly though swf are probably the worst games for NOED because coordinated ones count totems on their comms and cleanse the dulls preventing it from spawning.  If you suspect a toxic swf you're better off just upping your addons to something stronger instead.  If I was Plague for instance and remember a group for being particularly douchey I might give them some Black Insense to smell for instance.
---
Nice man!  You're right there.  Ruin will be very helpful in extending your games a bit and buying some needed time to maneuver.  My personal recommendation is to ignore the totem early on don't just head right there to check on it.  You're basically just telling an observant opponent what are to check first.  Best of luck man.
---
Something to make totem perks less shitty they get popped too damn fast
---
More counters for swf groups it's very hard to win against a good group so there needs to be extra options for a killer to use to beat them.

Yea there’s still more studies that need to be done and researching between the different kinds of milk but it seems hormone  milk is the general consensus not to be ideal.  Even so most of the world population is lactose intolerant after age 5, seems only 35% make it to adulthood.
---
Only begins the majority of people lose the ability to digest lactase.
---
Overall milk isn’t the best for everyday meals 8oz, I’m not saying a small glass a day is going to kill you but making it a habit/routine into every meal isn’t ideal.
---
Lmao get good
---
Killer is host, if survivor lags it might be cause your connection is super poor. If multiple people are lagging, it’s you. If it’s radically different for each surv, then it’s their personal connection.
---
Adam
---
Tunneling is when you get chased by the killer constantly, and they don't go for anyone else until you're killed. Or when you're unhooked and the killer goes straight for you, instead of hitting a survivor that might be closer.
---
Rly? What a cringe then haha

hey jake

Dead hard in my opinion. Not as map reliant and Dead Hard is the only perk in the game(that I can think of) that provides I invincibility frames. Not the endurance effect, actual invincibility frames

That's weird hope you figure it out
---
Quality shitpost
---
You can say whatever you want. But the ability to reduce the recover time after falling is a pretty good side effect
---
Just get good
---
True. I have times where it doesnt work. However, once dedicated servers are officially released and fully functional, that wont be an issue anymore
---
Shaun from Shaun of the Dead
---
* General horror content (including movie discussions) is better suited for /r/horror or other related subreddits.
---
That would be like adding a better Whispers perk to the killer's base kit. If they stayed near the hook, they could automatically tell if another survivor was close by.
---
Well known bug right now. You probably had trouble healing and wiggling that match too, if I’m not mistaken. 
---
Devs are still working on a fix.
---
You mean in a few years from now?Didnt they say summer?

Ass do I*
---
She can literally blink back there
---
I just saw that psa like yesterday
---
I’m assuming she teleported into it after the gens we’re done, probably not a good start though because the survivors can just run to the other gate.
---
You will get screwed by dedicated servers as huntress even if your ping is green.
---
Any ping vs current 0 ping will feel much different, you will have to re-learn huntress.
---
Whenever there’s ruin, killers always say “IT SPAWNS NEXT TO SURVIVORS EVERY GAME” but as a survivor, I think 9/10 games ruin lasts for 4 gens before its found IF it’s found at all
---
I love balanced landing. The recovery time on falling is what keeps it in my line up.
---
This is common, Nurses can blink behind the exit gate during the match whenever they want and sometimes you will find some people who like to jumpscare with it, I've had some hilarious matches like that before. Plus she's not gonna wanna just walk away from you when you're hooked near the gate and she has no kills, so I kinda see why she camped but it's never a fun experience justified or not, wouldn't call her toxic tho
---
As far as I was aware she’s always been able to teleport behind the gate. It’s a bit of meme to run Insidious and Noed then wait for someone to open it.
---
&gt;. I think decisive should deactivate if the killer gets another hook. It should punish tunneling only.
---
Then the killer downs you, downs the unhooker, hooks them, then ur decisive is gone but you still got Tunnelled
---
Sorry man you right this is a ass appreciation post.
---
This actually was an awful attempt at that meme.
---
BL, Dead Hard and Lithe are all ridiculously good.  I find myself running BL bc it can turn a random hill with no loop into a viable spot until you make it Too a legit good loop.
---
Dude just don't tunnel.....I literally eat like 2 decisives a week and those are usually intentional as I often run STBFL and want to force the obsession change so I can finally switch targets to my obsession for some hooks.  Play aggressively and switch targets and decisive makes survivors 3 perk players.
---
Between Bloodlust 3, finite pallets, and the entity blocker eventually that Survivior loses no matter what

Almost nice
---
Question was who I’d like to see and my answer was Sidney :)
---
Once you get high enough level, you'll start getting one ultra rare node per bloodweb. If you have the Freddy, Myers, Pig, and Leatherface DLC's (Not the killer with cells, but the actual DLC) the splinters for playing them will stop spawning. With no ultra rare addons, this translates into one Ebony Mori per bloodweb.
---
I love this build. It is so funny. Do the bones even when the killer seems to be afk
---
Or, and hear me out on this, just play the game right without lag helping you so you can actually get better. Many people consider it cheating to use lag against people for an "easy win". I main killer and I do not agree with this in any way.
---
Ghst Fae
---
This may be true. However, human breast milk is the probably the healthiest thing you have have to drink, considering it's the only food/drink you can consume solely throughout your life without dying an early death.
---
Gonna have to shut that shit off after the first 30 seconds of every game because you already know a survivor found it
---
dbd-facebook is such a good tumblr blog
---
Yeah! Let her know I said thank you.
---
ok this sub is probably fed up with the rank thing but holy shit, a full rainbow, 69 and 420
---
"The characters don't look like movie stars, but they're objectively pretty attractive."
---
Oh yeah totally, I agree in that. Except for Nea's and Quentin's faces
---
The point of what I said is not just "Nea Ugly in my opinion", is that Nea has an Ugly Face and we paint it as the cutest adorablest face of them all while Quentin has the same Ugly Face but people are all like "Fuck you Quentin, you ugly piece of Shit."
---
The 4 gens before first hook thing is kind of a you problem. The rest is kinda relatable but I’ve just learned to stop playing the game because people are just toxic fucks in this community.
---
I had someone do that the other day... It's pathetic.
---
I've been a victim of this a few times. It's pretty funny. Although I'd combine it with Blood Warden.
---
Jane Romero: -enters the roam moaning suggestively and thiccly-
---
I need milk for my cereal, choco milk and hot chocolate.
---
Why post the same thing twice?
---
Ghost Face being similar to Myers and Pig actually makes sense for the character. In the movies they mimicked popular slashers. So it's understandable that this iteration of Ghost Face does the same.
---
And about the fact that placing RBT on a survivor’s head after the gates are powered is now useless
---
Wow, if I could do this on Xbox I totally would !! That sounds like a great fix
---
Ruin, monitor, Thanatophobia and Pop works well on her as a build.  Offering wise Black Incense is her Prayer Beads.  That shit is amazing.  More common rarities though anything that increases the effectiveness of her puke is always good to break them faster. 
---
Sometimes it's enough just to tap a survivor with your ability to infect and leave to continue your patrol.  You gotta make the read on when it makes sense to commit to the chase to fully break and down.
---
Yeah I'ma need a whole explanation on " We will publish the final list of server locations in the coming weeks. If none of these locations are near you, you will still be able to play the game and have the same experience as before. "  
---
Does this mean things will work the way they work now for people in countries that don't have servers, or will we be forced onto servers that are far away from us with 300+ ping?
---
You know her breathing is loud AF right? Did you see where she was waiting??? You were asking for it lol
---
No but it’s to extremes for a perk. Like compared to pop and other perks it’s too OP. Plus you ignored the fact that it gives the incentive to get early kills
---

---
Holy crap this couldn't be more accurate.  I currently have no perks used for shortening loops so I pop of out nowhere exposing the survivor only to be looped the whole game. lol very nice
---
Yeah it looks weird but it's the most efficient way to work through ruin as the other commenters pointed out.
---
Lol get fucked
---
I can second that, lots of people say it when you get to that subject.
---
I don’t know how to feel about this
---
You're not wrong, but yesterday they said they were testing dedicated servers on the PTB on September 3rd. That's less than a week away, so I highly doubt they'd change their timetable too drastically at this point
---
Nope, never leveled Bill ever and I have Borrowed Time and that perk where you can stand up and run after recovering from a downed state. So you’re good.
---
I know red ranks camp too but not as much as brown ranks.
---
Have u gotten them recently though? I still have my unbreakable on Claudette but I can’t seem to get his perks any more in the bloodweb
---
If they're truly veterans switch to a 1 hit killer or use noed since they'll be overly altruistic and usually crowd the hook. Don't let one grab your attention to chase you away or pretend you're letting him and backpedal it to the hook
---
Nice
---
You should try streaming sometime its really fun and you can make friends... try to imagine it just like you are normally playing games. BUT people can actually watch you and chill and talk to you, unless your personality is repulsive then you can always chill with nightbot!
---
shame they instantly escaped tho
---
I am saying to fit the lore of the weeping angel, that wouldn’t work. The idea is fine, but it wouldn’t make sense.

Soy/tofu doesn't lower testosterone, it has a chemical that mimics the effects of estrogen.

Yep, got adept with freddy at red rank pre rework

He does stalk its mentioned in all films that the killer was methodical, planed out his attacks and watched his victims and even in the TV series the killer watches , taunts his victims and then kills like gf
---
1. Keep playing and practicing.
---
2. Keep leveling and grinding to unlock Teachables in order to have access to stronger, more viable builds 
---
3. Learn to play either Nurse, Spirit or Hillbilly as these are the top 3 viable killers with the best tools to shut down Survivors' abilities to outrun you.
---
I still hear him too.
---
As a survivor main, yeah. It's probably an unpopular opinion, but every game has something that makes the gameplay challenging. Whether it be a: skill, weapon, character, stat/characteristic, etc. You can complain about it or learn to better yourself against it; while understanding that since it's available people will continue to use it. Ffs this isnt a new concept. Educate yourself for next time, type "gg" and then press on to the next match.
---
Ah ok thank you all. I didn't know
---
What’s the level I have to get to?
---
I don't know the exact level but it's around the 40's where you start reaching "One Ultra Rare per bloodweb" territory.

EDIT: And I mean character level. Like "Level 40 hillbilly". Not account level.

Uh yea dude...you  just going to play games the rest of your life with one arm held back?  I main survivor and I’m perfectly fine with ebonies/omegas/PB/iri hatchets.

Please give proof then

Why don’t u give proof ?

Fr I'd rather take a perk that let's me get away and have control and advantage with it than one that needs me to risk myself and take a hit first.

Thanks for the help

Ooph, I hope you at least beat it first cuz it might be my favorite... I know it's my opinion but I cant decide which is better, DS3 or Bloodborne. They're both masterpieces
---
oh, it's this post. again.
---
So once survivors figure out who the killer is, what is stopping them from running as a 4 man pack, and everyone looks into a different direction?
---
Or if the looking around doesn't work while gen repairing, have 3 people work on the gen and 1 guy is the spotter.
---
Even if the spotter messes up, after the first hit he can just stare at the angel, 3 guys heal him almost instant and back on the gen it is.

Yeah it does, I use both terms and are fine with both as tactic.

Jeepers Creepers, as a franchise, doesnt really have the same momentum behind it as the other licensed DLC in the game so far. He'd be a niche choice that wouldn't attract many new players, if any.
---
Take out self care. Bring borrowed, or we will make it
---
Does crouching actually affect the hitbox or does it just feel like it does?
---
Oh, god, are people really thinking that I care about Jeepers Creepers? No, fuck that series, I never even watched it, it's just that the character's relevance is a funny thing to criticize in this situation.

3 swf didn't need u
---
Well, that's good to hear.
---
Why is everyone so mad that I don't keep up on what directors I don't care about are rapists?
---
They have to get woken up by alarm clocks around the map so the killer just has to wait for their opportunity.
---
Thats an achievement of getting adept freddy, not showing rank at all huh?
---
He said it in voice messages.
---
Just you wait till my Evil Within pops, then you’ll be sorry!

Let Killers opt-in to face SWFs for a BP bonus that scales to how many. That way, baby Killers just trying to practice someone new don't get dunked on, and there's still incentive to challenge SWFs.
---
Clip is mine! Twitch.tv/blakemistow :)
---
He replaced Myers as my favourite killer since his release. I don’t think he’s super powerful or anything but after extensive playtime with him I can confirm that’s he’s not as bad as everyone says he is. If you actually think about the best way to stalk a survivor instead of just running in then you will be applying exposed to people a lot of the time. His level of power greatly depends on if you’re actually playing to his strengths or not. And yeah, of course he can get looped until exposed runs out, but so can Myers and every other killer for that matter. He’s just really fun to play as, especially since you can tbag those toxic survivors back.
---
This just happened to me! A ghost face let me and one other person complete all the gens, while downing us and letting us heal each other. Let us escape in the end too.

This never gets old I can laugh FOREVER😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

While it definitely is that in some cases, for smaller newer streamers the chances of having someone manually scroll to the very bottom of the DBD directory and join your stream is RARE, like really rare (I have a fairly successful stream and have been on the platform for years).
---
I have personally visited a BUNCH of streams of people I played with during the game, and found some really nice people there streaming. 
---
For someone at the bottom having this ability to sometimes draw someone to your chat for you to talk to is pretty much necessary in my opinion. Its not like these people are making insane amounts of money, they are just streaming the game because they want to and they want someone to chat to.
---
It MUST be a fair trade because so many people put TTV in their names, even though it seems to make killers use a Mori, Tunnel and also gives you the potential of being streamsniped.
---
So many negatives to having it in your name and yet people still do, and I don't really think they should be negatively judged on that personally. If it works for them it works, and if someone comes into their stream and they get a new regular viewer and some random person finds a new stream to watch then good for them both :) 
---
(all of my friends nowadays are people I met through streaming and I fucking love them)

Oh hey, is Fernan el crack. What is he doing here?
---
It's pretty much every game on Xbox. They just can't help it, it's beyond their intelligence.
---
Well, Freddy can teleport to any key point at any time. I'm thinking of something like interconnected gates at map walls so Killers can go from one set point to another on the opposite side of the map. Just because you saw Bubba go in one direction, it doesn't mean he's still there.

&gt;Results: Twelve subjects were enrolled with a mean age of 32.25 years (range 25 to 47). Serum testosterone decreased 19%(±22%) during the 4-week use of soy protein powder (P = 0.021) and increased within 2 weeks after we discontinued soy protein powder.
---
&gt;Conclusion: Soy protein powder decreases serum testosterone levels in healthy men.
---
You can find research that debunks almost anything when it comes to food.
---
Good. I underestimated them.
---
This killer is meant to be played by looking at someone from a distance, than teleporting near them and killing them when they go past a corner
---
Base game costing money doesn't pay for servers.
---
If it did MMOs would only need you to buy the game and it's expansions as time goes on, and wouldn't have Subscriptions or Microtransactions.
---
Microtransactions or subscription is what gets you servers and keeps them running, when DBD first launched it didn't have a shop for microtransactions so there was no hope in hell for dedicated servers.
---
Most PvP games aren't small enough for P2P to be effective either, majority of PvP games have teams of 5-12 versing each other, which no regular gaming computer or home internet would handle.
---
DBD on the other hand is just 5 total people which is rather easy for most computers and home internet.
---
When you put all that together, DBD until now has been rather logical being P2P rather than dedicated servers, and it's a far far safer option for small development teams than going balls in on something as expensive as dedicated servers without a guaranteed flow of cash from the game.
---
NOW DBD has that cash flow, they've grown enough to not only secure a lot of high profile licensed killers, but managed to convince the owners to allow cosmetics, so they are in a safe spot for it now.
---
But I'm still hard on the fence as a few months ago they basically told us Australians to fuck off and that we're not getting dedicated servers.
---
Same here!
---
Add in the sound of 3 generators finishing while they're running in circles for maximum effectiveness.
---
Wow what a bloodlust gamer.
---
DS has limitations, but it's still meta, and Head On is run without any Perk synergy already. A perk is broken once it allows a no-win scenario or vastly disproportionate gain, such as if Pop were to stack with Surge (it probably won't).
---
Man the amount of "sick juke montages" and "baby killer bullied" vidoes will be of the charts when dlc hits.

You can straw man with the person there, all you have to do is misrepresent what they said and fight against that falsity instead, but yeah, I just said what his point is in a more concise manner. different words, same meaning
---
Oh God...hell no!
---
If you live near the servers you’ll have slightly better/more reliable ping vs someone who lives on the edge of the servers range.

Lmao.  Teamates?  Helping?  What game are you playing?

That bloodhunt post may not be real.
---
🤬 I need a spirit one and they are sold out

The future, predicted.
---
If a killer picks up and drops a survivor after downing them, it means they want to farm essentially. Not much you can do to try and farm with the killer as survivor.
---
really? thought it was from bhvr
---
Ok why am I being downvoted all of the sudden? I am sorry for whatever mistake I made but I didn't knew if the poster owned the video so I just wanted to say thank you, plus I wanted to end the joke that came from the sentence I made (stupid mobile phone). I'm sorry everyone on what I did even if I really have no idea on what I did.
---
I live in Australia, and months ago Devs said they wont be bringing servers here.  
---
So there's no chance we'll have a good connection to any dedicated servers.
---
honestly I'm a solo player 95% of the time so i relate so much to this. but still i hate when Deliverance gets me excited about rescuing myself just to be cornered by a killer 30 seconds later.

Adams usually use deliverance in terror radius and DC when downed instantly

Okay, this is sick af. As someone who is low-key creeped out by mannequins, this killer has so much Spooky Potential. I love her perks and power, and I'd honestly love to see her in-game. I can practically HEAR the clicking of her joints. Nice work op :0

Pretty sure someone posted a similar gif ages ago. Something like "ghostface gameplay leak", just without the music added.
---
Oh no he didn't had deliverance he was just a god (I could see his perks).How do I do it on mobile? The instant heal
---
Pet all the Jake's George.
---
Then the gen bois loop me as well. But it is better than just getting ran by the same dude
---
OchiDo fans already salivating
---
Thank you I like it too :)
---
I've noticed at high ranks, the games that it doesn't get found instantly, it does tend to last a lot of the game because peeps just power through it
---
Oh no, the matchmaking is messed up at the moment? Who would've thought?
---
"🎵We are the Dwight brothers and there can be no other🎵"
---
Not sure.
---
On one hand it would be nice to reduce exhaustion time but on the other depending on how much it would reduce the timer it could be too strong
---
pepehands
---
Because we’re still mad.
---
I spent hours and hours leveling up my Pig, collecting “Meta” Perks, and even bought one of the new Cosmetics. And now she’s pretty much a joke of a Killer.
---
It’s the best survivor perk.
---
Don't take the meme literally, it's about the message.
---
Thats Jonathan from season five
---
dh is good for another loop at most, balanced gives you the same distance youd have gotten with a pallet stun.
---
also like 90% of maps have a spot you can get bl from, and some spots are borderline broken with bl.
---
Yea and head spider as a killer! Seriously, a very small killer could be freaking terrifying... and hilarious while carrying someone to the hook
---
She had blood warden
---
Best perk you get from that is ds useful for being tunneled
---
As far as I know, they haven't added the ability to use instaheals yet. They said in one of their AMAs a while back that they're working on it but it wasn't in the game yet.
---
Quentin is a beautiful boy
---
That’s the reason, veterans don’t go running around the moment they see ruin like the new guys lol
---
The only issue is Michael is so tall that most survivors can see him over the corn and the maps are so big his slow movement speed means he has a hard time
---
Save the best for last is just as good, if not better.
---
I’m sorry it’s just so easy!
---
Michael is just a decent killer and Laurie's DS perk is sweet. Worth it just for DS tbh
---
And Freddy is a fictional character not created by a pedophile. So to be fair, stfu with your dumbass straw man argument.
---
BTW, you still got your BS "facts" wrong. They backed down from the IMPLICATION that he may be a pedo because of a scandal with a pre-school involving pedo panic where everyone was found not guilty because the kids were coaxed to lie.

Mount Ormond Resort, there are two trees right next to a 3-man gen with a flaming barrel nearby, When in the dying state you are able to crawl underneath one of the trees with only half of your legs visible but can still be picked up by the killer.

Nevermind, I'm just living under a rock I guess.
---
This isnt Yoda its Leatherface i swear
---
That’s when I reboot the game. Yeah right I’m giving you 2x BP and you’re gonna Mori me? Fuck outta here lol
---
I think you need to learn how to make a joke.
---
The alien is too cute to be a killer
---
Pretty sure this guy is just tryna get compliments or flex from/on newer people
---
i mean..its ok? if youre trying to flex it's not impressive but it's better than rank 20
---
420 69. It’s the holy number, my friend.
---
I FUCKING LOVE THIS! I really had to stop reading for a few seconds after the climb. But who would the killer be?
---
No I just wanna know is it good or bad I'm prob gonna delete this later
---
i hate when people post something completely unrelated to a subreddit but the title mentions the subject of the sub so they can try and pretend it's not just blatant off topic shitposting
---
Thank you very much, it's useful. Can you also tell me if Myers is good killer? I was hesitating between him and Ghostface and I want to know if I did good by choosing Michael.
---
Tts?
---
It’s completely relevant? Ya can’t jump in DBD. But ok.
---
I think it's super good but there are so many maps when youd get more use out of lithe due to how flat some maps are.
---
My thought when making these is always "how would it be at low, mid and high ranks? Would it still be effective after the first week? What about 3 months when people are accustomed to it?" 
---
Let's look at two. Huntress and doctor. First week doctor.and nurse were equal. No-one could hit the madness skill checks but nowadays they're easily done. Huntress? One of the top 3 killers.
---
Always remember when making these "is ir for fun or for competitive" then, accordingly add that into your title/first sentence. Helps people out on what to expect.
---
Happy Cake Day
---
This is the saddest bait I’ve ever sern
---
I dont have her
---
\+1, fucking over all the spam for the past week flooding my home page
---
First one is just funny to me. 
---
But that second one is actually an AWESOME idea. They would have to make it so the illusion stood or crouched still, would be a little over powered to have it copy your actions and movements. Can you imagine all four survivors using it and BBQ procing to show a killer 8 survivors!? Maybe but a token limit on it like Distortion. 
---
Last one wouldn’t be bad either, just maybe lower the percentages to 5/10/15%
---
Really any killer in a nutshell.
---
Neeeouu
---
is this the new live action dbd movie?
---
depends what milk, what quantity and depends for which people. But if you care about your own health i advise you to do some research about cow milk effect on us.
---
"this picture talking about jumping in video games is relevant to dbd because you cant jump in dbd"
---
🤔 just what is going on inside your head my man?
---
It sits below those two for me but above DS2 (have yet to play Sekiro but I heard it great). DS1 is more plodding and one dimensional than BB or DS3 but it still has a special place in my heart. Hard to say DS1 is the best if you've never even played DS3, which is essentially the culmination of the Soulsborne series. It melds the best parts of all the games almost perfectly. I'd say I enjoyed the overall map layout in DS1 more though!
---
Remove self-care because it takes a year to heal with. Rather just bring a medkit.
---
Ngl these are really well done
---
... I'd say 100 hours qualifies as veteran.
---
Even Nea sounded like she’s had enough
---
Oh is the bug fixed now?
---
How do you prove to the dev's that you lost that time?
---
*Sad squeaky clown shoe noises*
---
The real nightmare 😂😂
---
I’m assuming the killer in that game is a rank 17 though?
---
What was the mistake?
---
He’s an ex-jock y’all
---
That moment when you don't understand the stranger things dlc until you binge watch the entire series in three days
---
Vigil with no exhaustion perks you madman
---
I got one at level 1 Billy so yeah
---
Literally the meta perk, everyone is running it you’re the only one having issues
---
Whatever works lol
---
Prerework you only needed a 4k lol
---
That I thought down was a person but it was just the mess up that was I'm the sentence I first put down in the post.
---
I wish they'd make the cap 2 mil. Maybe 1.5 mil would be a little more realistic.
---
Ehm... For me scary movie worse
---
Then don’t complain that you missed your skill check
---
I mean, The Huntress is a big girl. Her slower movement speed reflects how T H I C C she really is, das alotta meat for one man only.
---
Meh, I’m pretty sure they are going to be awful at first. Maybe it’ll work out.
---
Weeping that the others werent doing gens
---
Yeah you have good points, I agree with everything that you said. It was an obvious choice back in the day to make it the way they did.  Would be very sad if there were no aussie servers, I hope that's not going to happen.
---
The killers offering should overpower the survivors offering tbh
---
Ace main here with Plunderer's and Ace in the hole, I will run this build even in red ranks and still go around to loot all the chests to give my teammates either brown medkits or pink keys
---
As much as I like bl, the fact that its completely useless on some maps is a major turn off. I always run dead hard, not because it's better, but because it's more consistent.
---
You would think that but I just don’t see it. The level of hate he holds for it is immense. And I don’t think he even cares much for references made about it. Could have sworn he some something of the like in an interview.
---
Seeing 4 fengs with default outfit joining at once, items are irrelevant
---
“Ensure your escape” I cant hit the skill check 99% of the time. How does this ensure your escape. It seems like it ensure a wasted perk slot.
---
I actually had no idea that the director was a convicted child abuser. Justin Long as a survivor would have been awesome.
---
Today I did my first good loops in shack, stalled for 3 gens and then died. Wasnt even mad
---
You're probably wondering how I got into this situation.
---
Yeah same. :/
---
But hes slow as fuck so any sentient player will take advantage of that.
---
Not sure why you were downvoted, but I appreciate this reference. Have my updoot friend
---
This is one of those sounds that sound completely different the second time you hear it

All I know is, eating pallets is 100% safe. The more pallets you eat, the better your odds of being a winner.

You also won't get cancer from eating a bag of Cape Cod now and then. Probably.
---
Did you tell him hes a dumb fuck in chat?
---
This is true, however I had a match were I got the cornfield and the team was over alturistic. I hooked someone in the corn and they all rushed me but because it wasn't a swf (or a very bad one) they could not keep track of me through the corn
---
Ill do that if they had trash/toxic teammates. (Or if theyre clearly new
---
This speaks to me on a personal level.
---
If you click or dip at me repeatedly you are signing up for that kind of match, imo.
---
Want a game with a killer that isnt targeting YOU? dont paint the target on yourself!!!
---
I agree, but I shouldn’t be hit a good 4 meters after a fast vault lol
---
When me and my friends do something like this, 2e all locate the basement and rush-enter a locker. Whoever gets pulled out last, wins
---
I enjoy playing F13, you can literally rapenall the counselors in under 5 min if you feel like being a pure evil sumbish
---
She's not mentally a child, she's just feral.
---
Interesting. Although he might hate it(I don't think it's immense necessarily), I doubt he'd reject a game company that he doesn't even care about or find relevant. He's not the type of guy to reject some quick money, not to mention that Warner Bros also plays a part in the production of the 1980 Shining. But we'll see in the future.
---
I hate camping but when you act like an asshat,i'm gonna dunk on you and ruin the rest of the match for you
---
I got 69420 once
---
Maybe they will add it eventually. Like testing it there or something. I didn't know it had a visual indicator on mobile though.
---
Exactly like this? Because a friend of mine made it herself and I didn't check \^\^' Sorry then D:
---
Has this been posted before? Trying to use it as bait to draw out the salty survivors.
---
Stubborn would let you get the left behind achievement if you are lucky
---
But what if the killer is right next you when you get the puzzle lmao
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Thank you friend!
---
thank you!
---
the ability to hit skill checks is the single most basic skill for a survivor, it's not even that im super great at it, it's just that it is literally something you do dozens of times every single game. not being able to hit ds is 100% you being bad at the game. get over it and stop throwing a fucking tantrum, youre embarrassing yourself
---
In my eyes it just shows youve gotten good at the game, if you whoop them and they call you trash, it just means they got whooped HARD.
---
And add "direction indicator" just like on mobile dbd. But it gonna be hard to not make this an exploit.
---
its a dangerous place and i love the smell of it.

I didn't know we had to hit skill checks the size of a dime, everytime. Your right we always have been hitting this "basic" skill check. Fucking legend m8.
---
Yeah that is my fear. I wouldn't want people abusing it but it undoubtedly would be

Old meme from this Subreddit yeah.

Diversion doesn't charge in a chase though, which wouldn't help a deaf person.

Now I am extremly impressed that it looks almost the same with the spacing...
---
same watermark my man
---
He honestly looks more like ace
---
I love when that happens. Then they blame you for camping.
---
Weird I just got a leatherface splinter and a Freddy splinter on Myers... Who is a great pick btw! Also Ghostface and Pig. Those three profit a lot of stealth.
---
Enjoy self caring for upwards of 40 seconds with sloppy butcher/mangled when you could've completed half a gen in that time. But hey, who cares about winning/having fun when you can heal for ages with a terrible perk?
---
r/dbdlfg
---
Did you actually make this? What is this from?
---
I did hear that ghostface is a lot of fun but frustrating on coldwin.
---
How do you get legacy cosmetics?
---
orrr continue to throw a tantrum. ok buddy. ever heard of hex: ruin? learn to hit the skill checks for that and you will never miss ds again
---
You're god damn right.
---
Sounds like a good way to get added to the “Mori on Sight” list to me
---
You know my girl kate be getting them gains lol.
---
Lol i remember my very first game, i slapped on balanced landing cuz i saw videos about it being really good and then managed to spawn in the killer's ass and i died within 90 seconds into the match
---
If you don't mind my asking how did it turn out so bad that it got scrapped?
---
Since I don't play her, I really can't really talk about her. I don't know main strategies with her.
---
I would wait until the Stranger Things chapter is out before making any decision, it’s still up in the air, but it looks like it’s gonna have some potentially meta perks that you might wanna grab
---
I mean, it was this or nothing. I find him fun
---
The ability was the thing that I wanted to change the most really. But the good thing about him looking like a survivor is would be that survivors would have to think twice before approaching other survivors. I think that the Doctors terror radius does what I wanted Pennywise's ability to do. If they get too shocked they scream. But I also think that the more scared the survivors are the more powerful he should become. Seeing how he feeds on fear. As for the ballon I was thinking that it would be on one of the ability pictures. If you do have an idea for how that could be an ability I would love to hear the idea.
---
It says attacks that cause status effects. In relation to exhaustion, I’m guessing that would mean killer add ons that cause exhaustion like Clown’s or Huntress’. Using Sprint Burst normally would still cause exhaustion.
---
If it is lag, its your lag unfortunately. Might want to get a new controller is my suggestion.
---

Also lets you escape if you are unhooked close to an open gate
---
Sleepy boi is best boi
---
Ahhh, you're right. Makes more sense now.
---
i'm in love, do you have instagram or tumblr??
---
This basically.
---
The ping was green and at a steady 50 for me and my teammates and once we load into the game, the killer managed a 4K with only one generator done because we were rubberbanding every 2 seconds. Fuckin' BS
---
This why I try to hunt down totems in most of my games. I'm not exactly thrilled to sit a gen for a few minutes and then be out.
---
There is no way tell in the lobby but while loading in you get tips. Sometimes you'll get tips on whoever the killer is. Like what their ability does. You can't get tips on any other killers except whoever the killer you're going up against is.
---
That's the reason I run Lithe
---
Most people say to get out of EW 1 as soon as possible, but depending on the rank, you can usually open the match with a gen grab before that. If the survivors spot you, it’s then best to try and get to EW 2 as fast as possible, I usually try to then 99% my stalk so I can pop EW 3 mid chase when I’ve got a guaranteed down. Monitor and abuse is an excellent perk on Myers because it can still afford you a little bit of stealth in EW 2, and the rest of your perks should just be your choice of standard M1 killer perks
---
You got that Dwight!

Thank you so much for drawing my mains &lt;3

To be fair you try to avoid self care if you're mangled but this guy seems to think "it's self-care or nothing"
---
The trick is to just don't do them at all, but speaking wrong answers with such confidence, that the teacher just thinks you did it wrong.
---
However, it also says that if you enter the radius of someone using Vigil, you ignore status effects for 30 seconds. I’m not entirely sure how this would work with exhaustion.
---
Holy shit you fucking killed him dude
---
I once sent a gg to somebody and I got multiple  voice messages  about how people ruined legion which would of made sense except he was a survivor and I was said legion
---
Manga?? Where ??
---
well, i'm sorry, but i suppose i don't understand the point of your replies and what you're trying to get at with them, then
---
Tbh it looked a bit like lag could've been the crippling issue or your skill. Either way it sucks
---
That's just Laurie
---
Eh that seems kinda bad for survivors, hard pass on that one...
---
He’s beautiful as he is
---
thank you.
---
Thank you, I do! 
---
I think if it worked with Nurse’s Calling it would have to mimic the healing action.
---
Honestly you should do this. Break him out of his power to deny him of instadowns, and force him to hit you normally to get rid of any stalk he has built up on you. Do this and he's just a very sneaky M1 killer
---
I've always maintained that there are about as many hits that should not have landed as there are hits the clearly landed and do not register at all. I've literally watched my weapon disappear into a survivors body as they're climbing through a window and it did not register as many times as I've watched a fuckin leatherface chainsaw me through a corner.
---
I don't camp myself but I do understand where his coming from. Sometimes I encounter a really good survivor and get looped. I eventually break off to find a weaker target but leave frustrated and thinking "I'ma camp this cool!". I have literally never camped but I'm always tempted out of frustration. So I get it and won't judge anyone for doing it.
---
Edit: and like you said, baby ranks if that's what they normally do, so no skin off my back.
---
They do stop after awhile, mine stopped after I faced each killer for the first time and occasionally pop up after rank reset
---
As much as I love him make him have eyebrows at least
---
You mean it wasn't Sony?
---
Punished Steve aka Melty Steve. "Second-hand Steve" on weekends.
---
God this is the worst feeling. I actually go out of my way to apologize to each of them after the game because I feel like a bully, matchmaking needs to get it's shit together.
---
That’s me with Nurse, Spirit, and Legion. (Legion was for a ritual, and I was just trying the other two for fun.)
---
And move the mop? Heathen

wait till they catch up...they always ketchup...

HAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA

---
Adrenaline?
---
or really anyone in small areas/ far from metropolitan areas
---
It’s detrimental to your own game though. He’ll forever be relegated to the shit tier ranks if he’s so easily tilted. Try to show your fellow killer mains the errors of their ways. No reason to doom any chance of snowballing late game because some survivor played really well during the mid game.
---
is this streamer paying u to put clips of his average gameplay on reddit? its the third post today...and how annoying is clip that shit phrase? vomit!
---
REALLY cool, but I feel like the weapon could be something besides the original weapon with some lights. I do like it, but it could be a little bit more of something
---
Reading the designer notes, how the hell does the oblivious status effect work? Does this mean for example if you're working on a gen while someone is being chased that the oblivious status will be applied? Or just when the killer is in stealth?
---
When you prestige a character (getting them to level 50 and then restarting it) it increases the odds of getting higher rarity things in your bloodweb
---
Is that myers a real person
---
No, the only way to get that many is when the devs give it to you, or hacking.
---
Well he was a track athlete... then he joined a circus, became fat, sloppy and complacent then some spindly spider-like appendages got him and now he's stuck in an alternate dimension hunting people.

Yeah. Does it cut down the timer basically? And then it basically ignores Sloppy Butcher and ignores any current Exposed effects?

Not true at all
---
Sometimes the Host backs out of the lobby or an error on the games part. Nothing you can really do about it sometimes other than try again.
---
meg is just superior
---
I didn't know I needed this
---
I get people want to practice great checks but please do that on a gen and not me. Lol. I get mistakes happen but I legit will get people failing up to 3 times on me before I just move on.
---
I agree that it's dumb with the way it cuts stuff off, but I can't see a great compromise. There's a whole perk (Shadowborn) just for increasing your FOV, and if it was increased just by having a better monitor that could fuck with game balance.
---
Ok, but not all at once

Orange man has 2020 that's why he doesn't have glasses /s
---
Pfft lithe is better than BL. But in my opinion dead hard is the best.  There are only a few places each map where you can BL. Whereas lithe is any vault which is almost guaranteed in a chase
---
Yeah his dbd look foes suck but to be fair at no point in any of scream do they call him ghost face
---
The best way to beat a survivor like that is to very very intentionally utterly ignore them. Beat their friends down and almost always they'll have been following you (wasting their time) to either try to get your attention again or to get a flashlight save. 
---
Not taking their bait to go into a chase with them gets them all hot n bothered and they often throw the match continuing to try to get your attention
---
you just ruined a cultivating moment for all of us.
---
But what's wrong with people trying to grow their stream? I don't understand that mentality. Do you turn the TV off every time there's a commercial or close your eyes in the highway when you see a billboard?
---
Whilst I agree, A good match (which let's be fair, we all have) will net you a lot of BP. 
---
At least switching regularly between the two modes makes it more tolerable!

Is that supposed to be thicc jane
---
thats what normal people called a texture pack or missing texture it can happen a lot in some games
---
I do my dailies but that’s about it.

Lol, the exit gates at the end were a nice touch.
---
Buy the killer who you like the most and enjoy the game
---
Yes, and they must be purged
---
I've been waiting ever since he released.
---
adrenaline is a reward for doing the objective  
---
noed is a reward for not doing the objective
---
I actually pull this face when I'm carrying someone to the hook and someone gets in the way xD I love this post.
---
Do you want BP farmers every game.
---
Because this is how you get that.
---
Personally I like playing the game instead of farming for BPs
---
Should be a weaponised candy cane
---
I love this game us well, but...
---
It's not hard to be better than Friday the 13th lol
---
The developers ruined F13. Not the lawsuit I don't know where you get your info from but the devs have been fucking up F13 since day 1.
---
Pwyf is also good as it counters OofO and can make some killers that would normally get looped hard way quicker (wraith and bubba being my favorites to run it on)
---
Mine don’t even have the audacity to apologise :(

Dairy is bad for the skin and I'm lactose intollerant, guess I'm being ripped in half

Lmao
---
Why not a dying light one?
---
I believe they stack (There's quite a few things that don't say stacks, yet stack anyway like Leatherface's chainsaw speed addons) but haven't actually tested it. I only see something as not stacking if the game explicitly says "Does not stack" in the description.
---
I love tommy
---
This is the game. This is the community. I stick around because playing killer is a unique experience. But for the most part I'm completely divorced from the community and its autism. 
---
1: don't play by survivor rules I.E. "No camping, no tunneling, blah blah blah." Play how you want. Never feel bad about how they want you to play or feel like you need to give them a chance. Survivors have plenty of 2nd chances in the game and you don't need to give them more. Plus survivors never give killers a 2nd chance so why should you?
---
2: don't be afraid of using mori's especially against SWF squads. Look for the signs of a squad: are they using meme names, did they load in together with items, can you check their friends list, did they load in with using the same character or outfit? Once you get to rank 10 and beyond the rise in SWF groups is massive. You cannot avoid all of them. At red ranks it's 90% SWF players. They infest red ranks.
---
3: try to learn a strong killer that can deal with the BS like the Nurse, Hillbilly, Freddy (use the snares with Freddy) and Spirit. 
---
4: watch killer players like Otz or Tru3Ta1ent and see how they approach loops and pallets. Take note of how they juke them.
---
Omg I love it xD
---
Why would there ever be a DBD 2? Nobody has ever suggested it. They can infinitely add onto the DBD1. DBD2 would be worse than cod sequels in differentiating itself.
---
Both sides have perks that help that side. Just figure out how to counter them and the body blocking and it’ll be fine
---
Until they check what exactly you write. Then youre majorly fucked for life
---
The WiFi warriors. They have good internet for streaming, terrible for gaming. It’s spotty and is basically an automatic lag switch.
---
Telling survivors not to body block, gen rush, and use installing heals is like telling killers not to kill, hook and use Moris. Survivor have been nerfed plenty of times and is already an extremely boring position.
---
Wdym
---
Body blocking is teamwork lol. If it wasn't a mechanic they wanted they'd remove collision you tard. I'm a killer main but I do not agree with this person
---
Haha someones mad alpha males arent interested in them
---
He’s a stalker, that’s the whole basic premise of the killer.
---
When he calls and taunts, he’s stalking.
---
The reason you don’t see Ghostface crouching and observing in the movies is because the attention is focused on the victims.
---
If we were to follow Ghostface, we would most likely see him (or her) doing exactly what we’re doing in DBD.
---
When we chase survivors as Ghostface in DBD (because that’s how he attacks), that’s what you see in the movies.
---
It’s 100% in line with idea of the killer (killers) from the films.
---
Honestly I don't think you played killer in 2018 if you're talking like this today lmao
---
Demagorgan best girl don't @ me
---
Michael and GF are different but equally effective at exposing and downing survivors (their main gimmick) spirit playes vastly different but I recommend holding off on her because you can but her for those shards you get from leveling, if you’re buying by the chapter I’d say go with Meyers because of laurie having decisive strike and object of obsession
---
If someone hitting their control button a few times bothers you that much maybe you should delve into some single player games, since multi-player ones are too much for you.
---
Speed is life. 5x5

It’s out on mobile?

Rick Grimes for sure. Tom Engel from Krampus, Erin from You're Next, Peter Strahm from SAW, and Peter Graham from Hereditary.
---
"Hag has worse chase" someone doesn't know how to play hag
---
No u can hear her phase walking if ur near her
---
I dont really see that happening. They could go more of a monster route instead of human killers but the demogorgon throws a wrench in that.
---
I’m not the only one
---
It does. He's a common poster of both subreddits
---
Oh okay, I’ve never played against a Spirit.
---
Sure you’re a killer main, definitely
---
I pray for these baby survivors
---
Edit: fixed spelling
---
Ideally yeah, especially if it's your main
---
Left behind still bad, why can't it have a buff to gens too???
---
I used to not check for ping, had a game that was so laggy I still don't know if it was a lag switch or not, now I refused to play 100 ping
---
What was the most recent nerf? Last I checked DS and Borrowed Time got repeatedly buffed and they reduced the distance of pallets back to 8 meters. You try to paint this sad picture that survivors have gotten nothing but nerfs when that hasn't been the case. 
---
In addition to the BUFFS and map changes you guys got in your favor Legion got annihilated by nerfs and Pig's strong end game was taken away from her. About the only possible killer buff is in the form of a perk with Thrilling Tremors which is alright but it's hardly a game changer.
---
Check my flair you fucking clown
---
They are messing about with matchmaking for whatever reason because of the upcoming dedicated servers. It will likely be like this until then and probably afterwards as well.
---
I’m struggling to see the relationship with this sub. Can I post any meme as long as there is a picture of a killer in someone’s profile picture?
---
The days of true infinites, vacuum pallets, insta gens with BNP, permanent hook sabo, insta blind flashlights. Sorry to all the killer mains who dealt with all that and may be experiencing PTSD reading this.
---
Honestly I hate using mori’s it’s a unfair advantage to me, in fact I try to make my builds as non toxic as possible
---
Again, thats assuming we will instantly fall. I play red ranks, because he missed a skill check doesnt mean im going to get him out of the game, tunneling a survivor means giving other 3 all the time and space they need to repair. A survivor thats healing its not repairing, better yet they can be healead by someone else and thats two survivors off gens, and thats how you apply pressure to several survivors in different parts of the map, having them go to saves , heal, etc. Pressure gens doesnt mean kick a gen,  Tunneling one survivor, means letting three other without 0 pressure. Just different realities its my conclusion :)
---
if they can bodyblock so can you. there is a give and take here. bodyblocking doesnt even need cordination so that cant be swf all the time

I've played plenty of times without sound its possible but def tough. Skill checks are what got me the most.

Yeah it wasn’t amazing, kind of reminded me of a Disney channel original movie on acid. The whole newest season was meh. Crocodile from last season was probably my least favorite episode so far.

But you don’t have to get defensive and mean towards people just because YOU missed it.
---
4k hours and you still bitch this much about things you should know aren't bannable? Luuuuuuuul

I run meme builds in purple rank and I still get a 4K, and it’s a lot of fun you should try it.

Just run. Using urban evasion to crouch walk around the map just wastes time

Gonna be that guy and say Springtrap from FNAF. 
---
I know, the internet considers that series trash and I’m by no means a fan. I did however like the atmosphere and lore of the first 3 and Springtrap’s look and backstory would fit DbD well. 
---
Considering they just got Stranger Things and there is a FNAF film in the works, and Scott likes money, it could possibly happen. 
---
Please don’t hate me.

Not always an option to opt for Ethernet in everyone’s cases.

It’s literally based on her life while IN the Disney world stuck as Hannah Montana. Obviously without the extra crazy shit. The entire episode was written for her and based on her life. It also is far from the worst episode, people just like to jump on the hate train because hating MC is a stupid fad.
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Who bms the killer for not having noed? The team is usually like “thank god” or “cool”
---
Edit: now if all totems were cleansed and they did have noed, that’s a different story lmao
---
What changes are coming?
---
Yea
---
Yeah I started on Billy so I almost never get bullied as him but I know you'll get better fast I promise. OhTofu just dropped a really great comprehensive guide on playing Billy and it actually taught me about bodyblocking windown as a mindgame
---
Or even better...Barry Wheeler.

Sorry I have an opinion? Like what you just expect everyone to just deal with what they don’t enjoy, lol so just sit the fuck down with your adrenaline and purple flash light and wait for the ptb, okay bud?

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cy205g/if_i_buy_a_perk_in_this_sanctuary_or_however_its/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Yikes bruh
---
There’s no reason to grow in this game, growing just makes things harder
---
Lithe can be used in every map, because windows and pallets are used to save yourself., even without lithe. The are essential to designing any DBD map, so they must be present. However, I don’t see how falling off of a building is essential in a chase. Balanced Landing is even less useful in indoor maps, especially in the hospital map, when the only drop is in the centre of the map.
---
&gt;Borrowed Time and DS didn’t get buffed, they got a rework and a QOL change due to new mechanics being implemented in the game. They are still viable but not stronger. 
---
Aaaaannnnd both got buffed, yes? You hide behind this nonsense 'There have been mechanic changes" Yes, mechanic changes that made perks better. Now the BT doesn't go down when in the killer's Terror Radius and Enduring doesn't effect DS. Those are both buffs.
---
&gt;Pallet distances were changed but again that was due to them reducing the number of “safe loops” and they were only changed on Springwood. Most pallet loops on the reworked Badham can be easily mindgamed or bloodlusted. 
---
What game have you been playing? Because maps like Blood Lodge and Autowreckers Heaven are just as bad if not worse. And I've noticed with Spring Wood there being clusters of pallets all very close to each other. You can't really Bloodlust a pallet cluster like that and if you do rely on Bloodlust then you're wasting precious time.
---
&gt;Legion was bad for the game the way they were, no argument needed. If you can’t see that I don’t know what to say. 
---
Did they or did they not nerf the absolute fuck out of Legion and nerf the Pig? Yes or no answer. The answer is obvious: yes, they did nerf both characters. 
---
Also, this bit of nonsense made me laugh:
---
&gt;And Pigs endgame was changed because Killers wanted to end hatch standoffs and wanted to stop survivors staying in the match once the gates were opened, so along came the ECG.
---
And why did that need to be changed? The timer for EGC is halved if someone is down or on a hook. You mean to tell me 4 minutes isn't enough to get a trap off? Also, they didn't have go about this long convoluted EGC. They could have just let killers close the hatch like they did in the PTB but people like YOU cried about that and claimed it wasn't fair. They could have even fixed it by making it so killers can grab survivors using hatch during the recovery animation of an attack but they didn't do that either. They had to bend over backwards to once again give you people more second chances.
---

---
On paper I think the perk is great. However, I don't think it's very good. You should just be aware of your environment. I think a perk like empathy or bond is way better and accomplishes the same thing. If you see the killer chasing someone else via bond or empathy, you can focus on doing objectives. Those perks make it so you never need to evade anything because you're not in any danger.
---
A) I never bring items cause I'm a hoarder 
---
B) Adrenaline is boring and I don't use it
---
C) It's okay, you can have opinions kiddo, even 3 year olds have opinions, doesn't make them valid. I'll hit F for you on the world's smallest keyboard my guy.

---
Run. Urban Evasion really only saves time against rescuing hooks survivors against Hag.
---
Nah, looks like an animatronic from Spirit Halloween.
---
I haven’t watched TV in literally months, and I skip any and all possible ads on YouTube. Plus, do you seriously expect me to tune in after I’m done with my game? Hell no, back into the queue and gonna watch some YouTube or porn while waiting.
---
I know how to. She still has worse ms and if your trap is not ready at a loop, the survivor will just run away while you set it.
---
I don’t get it
---
It would be preferable if they added black bars on 21:9 rather than cutting off part of the screen. Annoying having to switch to a 16:9 ratio every time I open the game.
---
Stop, my penis can only get so erect.
---
&gt;Honestly I don't think you played killer in 2018 if you're talking like this today lmao
---
That doesn't mean the game is in an amazing place right now. It still has a long ways to go before anyone sane would suggest it was balanced. It's not even close to balanced still. Not with SWF with mics on Discord running around.
---
Facing greater challenges, and over coming them makes you a better player. Being a better player is the whole point of extended play. There’s nothing wrong with playing casually, but your destined to burn out eventually if you only ever engage in the basest challenge the game has to offer

A friend of mine won't play the game at all because of the lag in general "2+ years in development and they are just robbing people for a unstable experience. This is the second worst optimized game ive ever played and I find that unacceptable."

What movie is this? And what's the context?
---
That's what I thought so I'll stop using this perk. Thank you
---
She definitely mentally got older through time as she literally hunts people for sport, and abducts children to be her own children.

It's more accurate to describe her as *Feral* rather than a child.

You might not, but other people do. I've met plenty of people after games because of it. It has zero impact on you in any way, but you decide to impact them and their stream negatively on purpose.

People confuse lagging for lagswitching all the time. After experiencing real lagswitching, people don't accuse people of it, they curse/spam/report the player for cheating because they saw themselves rubberband back to their same position for 30 seconds, then in 1-2seconds are hit twice, picked up, and hooked as the host allows data to flow.
---
I think Dwight’s are jacking off while person is on hook. Op is spectating
---
&gt;You know what’s crazy, the other day I played in a 4man swf because I missed my friends and we all had time for each other. We never once said “Now we’re a 4man we can BULLY” the killer. I think killers think that’s how it goes, but it doesn’t. It’s just friends hanging out. 
---
That's your perspective. That doesn't mean the guy playing killer feels the same way. Tea-bagging isn't exactly a friendly gesture and never has been in any game.
---
&gt; Gen rushing isn’t a thing. People are doing the objective. 
---
Space Coconut defined this perfectly. Gen Rushing is when the killer feels like they have no control at slowing down the gens. So yes, it is a thing. That's ONE of your objectives. You can still rescue downed survivors or break totems to prevent the dreaded NOED. 
---
&gt; Borrowed time isn’t a crutch. Get away from the hooked survivor.
---
Not if survivors are right there at the hook. You mean to tell me if I hook someone and see another survivor close by that I should just walk away and let them get a free un-hook? No. Not happening. Especially when gates. It seems like you people never once consider that.
---
This is cringe wtf

I usually linger around 14-12 rank, I’ve only been playing for 2 months or so. If someone pisses me off in a match I’m not thinking about my rank, I literally only care about combating the person who’s tilting me, I dont even camp, camping just leads to two fully healthy survivors getting the save off anyway, I’d rather just play and make sure the problem player dies first.
---
Oof
---
Zubat and Monto are assclowns. Zubat cries when playing as survivor when killer uses Bamboozle or uses good add-ons. His chat is absolute cancer too. Monto is an even bigger joke. He ragequit on me multiple times when I got him. He cries when survivors aren't mindlessly hook rushing for him and he acts like he's hot shit when he downs bad survivors.
---
Panda is fine but I wouldn't say he's a great killer. Never watched the other two.
---
Edit: his gay fanboys will probably link this or copy paste this for him to see. Personally I hope they die in a car accident. Maybe they can all die in a bus crash as they go to meet their lord and savior Zubat and hope to be blessed by receiving his disease.

brother jake
---
Why fucking run if ur 20% faster.  U save sprint burst

The worst is how you can't let go of a gen in time or the skill check lags. Also the progress bar takes forever to go up again if you fuck up a skill check in lag or just keeps dropping up and down for no reason. Sad times :(

Like I said, move at your own pace, but there comes a time when you elevate your understanding of the game, and be able to better combat the more skilled survivors without having to directly target them constantly

And it's still not balanced. So what does that say?

Why do you keep saying 8oz?

I think it works if you’re using a spine chill build, but considering Fixated is probably going to replace it soon, I wouldn’t recommend using it for much longer
---
I've had these games before.  We complete 4 of the 5 gens with the killer being easy to avoid and no one having been hooked, and then all of a sudden we all start hardcore lagging/missing skill checks and the killer gets a 4k.
---
Nah bro this my usual order
---
Dead hard is pretty helpful to though

She’s a full grown ass adult, who can tactically kill entire groups of military trained men

Ever heard of moris? And there are no infinites like there were, windows get blocked, blood lust and more. You didn't comment about the rest of the things I listed. Hell with all the aura reading perks killers should have no issue finding survivors since stealth was basically nerfed by them. You have everything and more you could possibly need to find and kill survivors. 
---
We keep getting amazing perks for killers as well, if survivors get a decent perk it ends up nerfed like MoM. Quit bitching and go play solo survivor to rank 1, maybe then you'll be able to see things from other people's perspectives instead of just you're own.

---
We'll Make It will never allow you to increase the healing speed of yourself.
---
We'll Make It does allow you to stack OTHER healing bonuses. Its description refers to not stacking with itself. Healing a survivor with Botany and We'll Make It allows you to heal in 6.3 seconds compared to the 8 seconds with We'll Make It alone.

He's making the argument that they are both technically Undead so I guess that makes a friend's game that is only popular because of fanfics, rule34 and markiplier pretending to be scared by jump scares after the 47th time.
---
Depends on how you use it, people say it's bad because the majority of the time they only see it being used by neas on the edge of the map. Putting urban into your perk slot fortunately doesnt automatically turn you into that, it's good for a gen jockey build mixed with spine chill so you can get a gen done. Nothing is more frustrating as a killer to go over to a gen you know is being worked on and every time you go over there the survivor has magically vanished
---
I like Panda’s mostly laid back approach and ways to play without ruin. ScottJund is a wicked huntress. Zubat may be a tool but he’s an incredible nurse from what I’ve seen. Never played against Monto (I’m on PS4) so I’ll take your word for it, but I’ve always found him to be informative.

This was me when Ghostface came out.

lol that's weird. about as weird as people sending voice messages... like wtf? always weirds me out, because I imagine them in their living rooms, or maybe a bedroom and then im just like wtf why do i have to think about this? theres somthin off about these voice message folk.

---
The Doctor has been released for quite a while, now.
---
(More seriously, I don't know when the new DLC will release.)
---
A good Nurse is easy to find on YT/Twitch. I'll take your word on the other two but Monto is a prick. One time he showed my profile in a video he uploaded to YT and acted like a little child as I camped him with Doctor (while the other 3 survivors were obviously hovering around him). Which lead to me being harassed by his little fanboys in-game after he uploaded the video.
---
Look, another hate train rider who doesn’t care to actually know anything about her. She enjoys her lifestyle she worked her ass off for and gave up her entire childhood for. How dare she!
---
So they're both assholes? Or?

This is one of those ideas that works out on paper but in practice it's disastrous lmao. I feel for you bud.
---
Did it or did it not get buffed? Yes or No? Answer.
---
Is the video still up? I don’t remember seeing it
---
If she's so strong why does no one ever use her
---
I'll try and send a nice message to the killer even if I die first, I'll usually spectate to see if they weren't toxic and then send how well they played
---
Nah you pull them off then just yeet yourself on there

There's still infinites. Just look at Haddonfield or Disturbed Ward. And killers shouldn't be forced to run perks like Bamboozle to take away cancer loops. Oh and BTW, Bamboozle will not help you on Haddonfield or Disturbed Ward or certain other loops like the 2nd floor in the center area of Lery's where -for whatever reason- there can be 2-3 windows right next to each other up there.

You gotta accept its kinda cringe bro...

Killer DC Bait
---
Bro even sometimes with my other account there are rank 15 swf groups organized like a rank 1 premade with insta flashlights and bodyblocks, but i think that the game needs more new players, the Stranger Things dlc will help with this
---
that is a very specific guesstimation of your play time. lol nerd ass red ranks.
---
i think the matchmaking may be busted right now. i have had hard games as killer that don't make the game as cute and fun recently. i hope they fix it. no need to derank as killer, just do this and you'll derank anyway as an unintended icing on the cake: just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. don't down them after u already hooked them. that just slows down the match. for perks use BBQ, Distressing, Nurse vision, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i'd never play any other way.
---
A little of both. My friend doesn’t like when he’s distracting the killer just for the other 2 survivors to be crouching around, essentially doing nothing.
---
This is over a year ago. I've been told his behavior has gotten worse in his videos.

I use wifi because it's the only option for me, but my ping averages like 50ms so it's not that big a deal.

I respect the number but the name is funnier to me haha
---
ew 02
---
"No \*you\* hang up \*\*giggle\*\*"
---
That's great and all, except it's a competitive game. Your teammates are there to win. Not farm.
---
That’s me at Rank 16 going against green/purple ranks on Yamaoka’s Estate. :’)
---
Does pig trap kill you if you unhook yourself or was the timer about to finish before he got hooked? Im newish to the game so idk
---
Sad 3 bbq stacks sounds
---
Well deserved
---
As a (mostly) survivor main, I’m 100% for this idea.
---
Jake: Laurie I have an issue. 
---
Laurie: yes?
---
Jake: I wanna fuck Micheal. 
---
Laurie: WHAT? You realize he's a homicidal murderer right?
---
Jake: yeah but....he's....
---
*Kate walks out of the fog limping and smiling*. 
---
Laurie: how did you escape him? Did you get the hatch?
---
Kate: *grins* Let's just say I opened wide to my window of opportunity.
---
"Nerd ass red ranks"
---
I want them to start a barber shop quartet and sing "It's a Hard Knock Life".
---
Why is there just an extra Steve floating there in the middle of the post
---
Are you not in school yet?
---
Well for mine, right before I got downed it was about to go off, so right when you unhook yourself it’ll keep going as you can see from the video.
---
If you're close enough to be matched into a dedicated server, I don't think you'll go against killers outside your server area, unless you're like, right on the edge of a service area or something. And even if you were matched into a peer to peer match, you could just leave that lobby.
---
What they probably mean is places like Australia are gonna get screwed over again and not get a server
---
Literally not the point.
---
But seeing as to how all the ones i've met they take the time to messeage me about how i am a trash killer while im playing a lvl 13 trapper and don't have any cosmetics, than so far yeah.
---
it was a gift from the game awards, yes, dbd was in the game awards

Free hat though

I fucking shit myself each time

Such an adorable huntress ! :0
---
Jeff reminds me of Zaheer from Legend of Korra
---
That's great and all except it's a video game. I'm here to have fun, not let strangers dictate how I'll play.
---
And just because it has a ranked only mode don't make this game "competitive". Way too much BS on multiple levels to even have it pass as an competitive experience besides the bare minimum of going against another player.
---
Ruin, BBQ, Enduring, and Spirit Fury
---
If you like staying rank 10-15 hell yeah it got buffed, the ppl i'm tunneling for my 2k just won't die cuz i keep getting dsed.
---
Thanks man, that means a lot :)
---
Wow you're really friendly, I can only imagine how bad that discord is.
---
We need more gens like this one
---
Thanks man!
---
Not even in that Discord anymore... I just said it's a great place, honestly there was no reason for your comment anyways
---
Just hilarious to me. Uninstall your game if it angers you so much. I'm going to keep playing, I'm a Rank 1 Trapper, I don't have problems with being bad. I used to be bad when I first started, we all were. All of us nerd Red ranks just didn't bitch about it on Reddit and figured out how to get better. Better a nerd than a whiney bitch.
---
yeah, I figured. but applying it to all hooks might help out newer players, and completely makes the perk not utterly useless, which what I was really going for.
---
Source: I've done and gone blinded my friends and so they have done the same in retaliation
---
Where is this meme from? Or what's the name of it?
---
Did I not say like 3 times she was teabagging?
---
I had a game where I didn’t get hooked at all, I saved everyone once or at least twice off the hook, last gen got done and someone was on hook stage 2. So I went for the save, got them off and immediately ran into a trap. The person I saved jumped into the hatch with another person who had a key. I got hooked, the other person opened and then ran out the exit gate. They didn’t even try
---
My friend hates it when I use autodidact hahaha
---
it's not awful, but I do think it could use a buff at some point. I do like my idea of rewarding killers that hit multiple targets at once in a quick succession. I picked the faster cooldown speed so you can pressure survivors better.
---
Yep. Not their character levels. Not their cosmetics. Just their add ons or items. Hell yeah that would work.
---
That type of bs is exactly why I wish I had friends to play with lmao
---
Same for me - only the other way around. I end up getting rank 1-2 killers who just wipe the floor with me (rank 8) and even more with the complete strangers I play with (usually rank 15-19).
---
IN HER FACE
---
I don’t understand
---
Exactly, so when you have people wasting even MORE time it makes it that much easier for the killer to win lmao. Self care is bottom tier. Especially since sloppy butcher is meta now.
---
Sorry for the late response, I just got out of work. The idea would be that if you're already exhausted, Blind, Haemorraged, etc. standing within a Vigil user for 30 seconds will clean that effect off of you, and provide future immunity for 30 seconds. It's good if you're trying to work on a generator and need to get effects like Sloppy Butcher off them or something - or if you're exposed and would like to not die instantly for 30 seconds.
---
That’s awesome! It’s super detailed
---
inside joke when it comes to the devs. anytime something is broken its either "working as intended" or "its not a bug its a feature" sometimes you might get a "pretty good job so far"
---
Not a reason to trashtalk someone and then post about it.
---
Whatever you say man. I already explain how to use it properly. Not going over it again
---
Sauce?
---
Wraith standing still most likely
---
You can't like an adult women because she is not hyper intelligent like me
---
Alright I get that
---
If no one bags then does that mean my perspective is correct? It’s how the player chooses to react. That’s not the survivors’ fault. 
---
Gen rushing is not a thing. You said we have other objectives like unhooking etc but if the killer doesn’t have “control” and they’re not hooking and snowballing, what objective do we have besides totems? See my point? 
---
When gates are open then it’s free range to do whatever. Camping hook is necessary if you care that much to get a kill but don’t complain to reddit that they got out because of BT. It’s the point.  Same goes for a teammate near hook. Push them off or let them get BT and snowball with hits on everyone.  Also, if you don’t see scratch marks what makes you think someone in near hook? Because no one came up with BBQ? As if lockers and distortion aren’t a thing.  
---
There’s always going to be an excuse what one side is worse than the other but my only argument is, it’s how you react and how you take these things.  I use to let certain shit bother me until I played both sides. We all want to win.
---
I’m not the one who said anything, sorry it’s not wholesome :^|
---
Yea…
---
Lol I just played a game as hag and what do ya know.. body blocking cunts🤦🏻‍♂️ you get extremely mad after the game but u just gotta learn to cool down and move on to the next.
---
I thought it bugged out just and there wasn’t even a killer but as soon as I saw Myers I thought he was trying to run permanent tombstone and stalking all of us to hit tier 3 but we were too quick.
---
Wheres Spirit
---
Yeah there a tons of other perks but most high ranks use the higher tier ones making the game stale. And I'm not sure how in your mind being able to not have two survivors in a vulnerable state is bad.
---
You and every Self-Care hater brings up Sloppy Butcher brings it up as if it is built in a killer's build. It's not. Self-Care is perfectly fine and the only reason it get shitted on here because higher ranks here are filled with SWF players. Play a few solo games and you'll realize while it's not a waste of a slot. Even if it'll never be mandatory.
---
Which is how perks should be btw.
---
True, hopefully the servers are well done so it's not a heavy nerf. It's a pretty good Quality of life for survivors
---
Wow! That IS relatable!
---
As a Dwight main, FUCK THAT DWIGHT
---
I love the game map
---
I came on the idea of this meme because I've got this situation in my last game🤷🏼‍♂️😂
---
Yeah. I don’t want to pick one side cause I look on steam pages and stuff about people saying it’s not overpowered, just sometimes I feel that way so i don’t know what I’m doing wrong or right.
---
I love these types of comments. I can almost see the game unfolding with this freddy.
---
Get new friends.
---
Same
---
We aren't all like this. He's probably trolling though. So I would pay him any mind
---
The game wasn’t meant to be a Friday the 13th property originally, they clearly weren’t able to handle the license that came with taking up the offer to turn their generic slasher game into an F13 game. 
---
Although the lawsuit did contribute a bit, it prevented them from adding new content to the game. But they did indeed not handle it at all like they should have
---
Tier 3 tombstone or tombstone piece if your close enough you can grab and mori them
---
I've seen a lot of new players have a hard time against killers (mostly due to the jerks who de-rank to play against new players.)
---
My best advice to you is to keep playing and watch some gameplay videos. Seeing how more experienced people play can help you get a hang of techniques, perk loadouts, and give you overall more knowledge on the game.
---
Like someone else said, playing killer as well will show you what they see and give you an advantage.
---
They will not fix it, they locked it intentionally. In Unreal Engine there is setting to keep X or Y fov. X-option is set by default and this is how game currently operates. You could change it to Y in settings config file and it would actually keep Y-fov same and expand view range on sides. But developers programmatically locked it to X.
---
P.S. I have ultra wide monitor and I am struggling too.
---
Don't insult mommy like that
---
But it could work thanks to the new team up with netflix. Thanks to this team up we have found out that multiple people in the netflix service are big fans of the game which would make it easier for this show
---
Yeah, that’s good feedback right there. I should play more as a killer, but the rush of escaping death is sometimes too good.
---
Face camping even (if exit gates are open) is still face camping! Lul all killers do it for BP but that just makes it all the better when they get saved.
---
Survivors t bag each other as a greeting you moron! Its how they say hello. Imagine getting salty because someone said hello
---
I don’t have a clue what any of this is. All I know is dead by daylight and entity. But luckily I’m a simple man. I see thing I know. I up vote :)
---
Is that your 'thing'? saying something is relatable to unfunny memes and than leaving?
---
Seems to be a lot of nutshells these past few days.
---
Sometimes when get bored, I’ll stand in the basement with bubba. Everyone gets to leave unless they touch my chest. Don’t touch my chest
---
Yes. The mods don't care about this dumb shit. So I mock it.
---
I'm going to stop playing DBD until they fix matchmaking, my mentality can't handle the constant "throwing you in the deep end" trope. I want to have fun or a challenge playing this game but playing Killer is leaving me broken and playing Survivor is leaving me frustrated.I will check back after the new DLC and dedicated servers comes out and see how things are but for my own mental health, I'm temporarily leaving this game.
---
To me it's cringe, just stating my opinion, but i know how opinions work on reddit.
---
Consult the 30 posts today stating matchmaking is broken, that’s how
---
They could always make it so you can toggle it.
---
Doc + 3-genning + Jigsaw Piece = PAIN.
---
nice.
---
yeah i think my pc has the xbox program on it. also this question is just for all platforms but i use pc.
---
Wait is that monitor and abuse on the doctor first you need to get that out of here
