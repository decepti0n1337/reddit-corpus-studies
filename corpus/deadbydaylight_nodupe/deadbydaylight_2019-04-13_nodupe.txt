If it was meant to be played solo why did the devs add SWFs.
---

---
Gonna have to unlearn Legion slightly too. I'm really hoping, regardless of what they do, that they keep his fast pace gameplay. No matter what it is I just wan't him to be fast.
---
Dude. No normal person needs to change their name that many times. What makes you so special you need to change names over and over again?
---
Weak but annoying to play against.
---
Lookout, we got a Hackerman over here
---
Hiding from R3 Myers is so damn horrifying because if you mess up Once, that's usually it.
---
Most of the memes on here are fucking shyte but this is a 10/10 for me .

---
Bravo
---
The balance team a joke lol
---
Add season rank rewards already. I wish they would explain why it's something they don't want to implement. It would make the game more competitive and it will draw more player base. Just do it already
---
Many players already believe that slugging "takes away their agency", lets not give them a real reason to bitch.
---
You know... Many people have the last name Romero... Right?
---
Identity V, the mobile ripoff of DBD, has a 2v8 mode that would actually be a pretty good template. Survivors go down in three hits, it has to be two different killers, survivors can carry two items and all characters can purchase items and buffs in-game using points. There’s seven generators but they go by really slowly, and once all generators are completed or there’s three or fewer survivors left, a key spawns somewhere around the map that can be bought to open hatch. It can only be on the two largest maps in the game. It’s actually a lot of fun.

I think it’s because you are awarded blood points for things earned before the killer DC’s.
---
so you have source for them confirming this?
---
Pretty sure it just shows you your last games post game screen.

Hags is supposed to be Eddy in this scenario, I think. While Nurse is Edd.

This makes it even funnier for me. Lmao

This is not woomy

She was part of a team of survivors in that lost that match, but she'll be the only one blamed for disconnecting.
---
I agree with basically everything you just said...the problem is that the console playerbase has already expressed these problems and potential solutions, like the ones you just wrote, for several months. Man, people have been complaining since I joined back in summer 2018.
---
The queue system was legitimately the first thing that "improved" the experience. Yes, its was a double-edged feature, but an improvement nonetheless. The only thing we can do is just wait...but for many people, patience only stretches so far while new games are being released.

Alternatively, Haddonfield in 2019 with Balanced Landing.

Can you get four survivors versus multiple killers?

It's the Doctor's new buff. The Illusion of Distance.

Enjoying those downvotes, you ignorant child?
---
If you're lucky enough to get a hook in endgame. I honestly dont think it's good. It only helps at the end with a condition that is fairly hard to meet. You would be playing with one less perk the entire game besides the end as well so I would highly disagree with people who claim it is a good endgame perk.
---
This dude's name is already going to be outdated soon. Oof. Well we still getting midseason update at least lol.
---
That new perk he got eh? 😂
---
But part of a successful night for me is not dealing with SWF bullshit....
---
Bug report forum post stating they are aware of the issue and will get fixed eventually.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/55476/mettle-of-man-not-working-against-nurse
---
Absolutely is a bug, Nurse’s blinks are weird right now I guess for counting as hits.
---
PC. [this terror radius ear rape bug. ](https://youtu.be/pnNWNGxgL40). Has happened to several streamers too. It really just makes you want to DC. No idea how to reproduce it but it happened 2 games in a row and I restarted my game and it was gone.
---
Sure didn't seem that way to me when I woke up.
---
I haven't noticed it.  Doctor's shock the universe build on any farm map or the Red Forest is still a slideshow on both killers and survivors, Nurse is still horrid.  Huntress might've improved but that would require me to get a non-swamp map which is also horrid on framerates.
---
now restart the game and watch the pip come back my man.
---
Well you lose movement speed
---
Well now you know
---
Maybe but they have lots of other shit to fix. They should hire new people. This game 3 years old..Why is it playing like a beta game.
---
Could just not be high on their list of priorities.  They obviously knew people would use coms. Between discord and xbox party functions its not hard to know that they'll do it on their own so why add it themselves its unnecessary work. What they should do is just add voice comms for the rest. Who the hell wants to play a multiplayer came with out communication. The whole point of it is to work together. Even if its at least voice proximity so you can talk while working on a Gen or getting an unhook.
---
Id be against it mostly because having your control taken away is annoying.
---
Imagine being hit by crowd control in a moba and being like "that was epic gameplay".
---
You could've atleast made it a Hexagon.
---
So I just got into a game where 2 claudettes were hiding in tall grass with lots of fog spamming emotes so that birds would not flock I had to leave because of this... it was simply too much and just annoying is this a banable offense... I have game footage
---
I’m gonna need to call Chris Hansen because my ears just got raped
---
Are you just playing devil's advocate? SWF has been out for what, two years? You think it's more likely they "just haven't gotten around to it yet", over the idea that they're aware that coordinated voice-comm undermines a ton of perks and mechanics?
---
Most likely inspired by the other john Romero, creator of night and the living dead and by extension the modern zombie.
---
 You don’t think it’s a little much and kinda weird to start cursing someone out and insulting them for playing a character you don’t like? Seems a little weird to me.
---
a character that nobody likes, that he knows nobody likes, that he knows is broken and bullshit, it’s deserved.

I killed some chick once and she messaged me telling me to get the last guy in the basement. I asked him if they were friends, he said no so I just let him go.
---
Shit is annoying af.
---
cool thanks.  that's good news.
---
What do you mean by stall?
---
Good meme.....I tried.
---
If I don’t want to play that and you keep making the dailies Killer then that is forcing me to play something just to get the blood points.  I don’t want their encouragement.  If they force me to play Killer for bloodpoints then I will ensure others do not have a pleasant gaming experience as I only care about the bloodpoints.  Give me a daily for 2 sacrifices and get ready for some camping and tunneling.
---
There was a 3-man with a Legion and a Claudette dc’ed while the Dwight killed himself on hook. The Legion felt pity for me so he let me get hatch. One of the only good souls out there that plays Legiob
---
I feel like that would be a better end game perk rather than a hex. Fun idea though.
---
The Dwight Stuff.
---
Whispers is good but I have a good build that I enjoy using, and I don't want to change it because of the endgame.
---
Not by a redditor...
---
Seriously I have tried, even asked for it to be pmed and told em it’s my fault if I get banned etc. I honestly don’t think anyone actually knows, they just claim to.
---
Basically like when I pull off the play I did earlier in a random game where I solo body blocked a survivor who was brought to a close hook where I'm crouched and spinning awkwardly so as to bait missed swings, the survivor wiggles out and I body block him out the exit gate.  That could be referred to as a clutch save which it totally was by the way.
---
Hex: Yes. Killer can do The Carlton while Hex is active.
---
Now that this perk is leaking into the meta, any Killer without a 1-shot power/add-on or Devour/NOED is essentially fucked. Both gameplay wise and Emblem wise since 1-shots give you less points to Malicious.
---
Our ways is totally different. Idk why u think I would do it for ''youtube views''. Jesus
---
#YOU FORGOT THE MASK
---
They could have dealt with some of the SWF issues with leaving random lobbies (no swf) and gave a survivors proximity chat like Friday.  Make the chat audible to the killer as well.
---
This is exactly against terms of service of dead by daylight, and should give you a ban...
---
A survivor can't get away from a decent Legion player (they can vault), while Legion's power takes 4 (or 3 with an addon) hits that stun and drain the power after the first attack to drop a survivor which applies a timed effect that drops a survivor if it runs out without being healed (the timer stops in a chase).  Also, there's no punishment for Legion wiffing an attack when they're using their power.
---
It leads to a killer that can't really be looped and takes forever to drop a survivor without cheese strats.  Overall, pretty unfun to both face and to use.
---
Beheaded.
---
r/woooosh
---
If only she didn’t switch her focus at the last second
---
Thanos, new killer confirmed.
---
Id buy that DLC
---
WAIT! What cosmetics did that Trapper have?!
---
It's a joke. I'm saying they break this shit consistently.
---
As killer i’m gonna miss those games because i would always use them to farm. As survivor i can say fuck those games because any killer who thinks that 3 survivors serve as a legitimate challenge is delusional.  
---
Think about it if u hook any single player, the second must unhook while the other is left to do gens alone. With perks, addons, map pressure, snowballing, hook patrolling, and gen structure it should be impossible for all 3 or even 2 to make it out unless the survivors are extremely competent and killer is not.  
---
Regardless i’ve had killers that refuse with 5 gens and only 2 people as a result of DC’s
---
sooo….we getting 3 exit gates!
---
...or even better
---
#4 EXIT GATES
---
LMAO
---
This pleases super Freddy
---
I cannot fucking wait, frankly.
---
Oh yes. Punish the many for the sins of a few. Great idea.
---
Yo delete this post and then cover their names
---
Flair checks out. 
---
No one's saying the Legion is overpowered, just not fun to play against.
---
That plain "What did she do you to you" has me laughing hard
---
Oh my god! Ectoplasm!
---
It can definitely slow the game down a lot, but if you're tunneling a single survivor that reduces your overall pressure and lets survivors do generators more safely. It's only useful when you don't have to explicitly tunnel your obsession to get them down, which typically only happens when a lot of generators have been completed anyway.
---
If it slowed exit gate speed as well it'd be much better and it'd definitely be deserving a perk slot but for right now? It's a total gamble
---
The 50% action speed debuff is natural and a base part of Freddy's kit. Freddy does have add-ons to decrease the speed even further.
---
Especially if she doesn’t have ruin
---
I just think it needs some other condition to it, like Deliverance. Also, some other kind of trade off or downside. You can 99% your heal, literally giving it no downside.
---
Oh wow, you're right. That doesn't make any sense, what about quitting more than once? What about if you double pip, do you lose those too?
---
It'll be something that punishes survivors for trying to rescue teammates at the end, probably will make it so when the exit gates are powered, killers automatically get bitter murmur, NOED and a ebony mori so they don't have to wait for survivors to escape they can just kill them instantly and end the game.
---
There just needs to be some kind of legit punishment for dc'ing.
---
I just hope they don't take away legion's 'running at full speed and stabbing everyone' power. I have so much fun when I run and step everyone 4 times and hear their scream.
---
This is part of the update, it’s a implicit update.
---
Yeah, it’s a stronger, easier Dead Hard. You don’t have to try and time it, or judge distances, nothing. It simply activates and you avoid a hit.
---
Entity... Aroused?!
---
I just think it's really funny how the idea is that the game screwed you- but you escape like a second later. Don't game me wrong- that axe never should have hit you.
---
It shouldn't *favor* either, that's the point.
---
Ah yes the true Michael not the one with unrealistic body expectations
---
Got hooked Borrowed Time unhooking a Survivor who then started Self Caring in a corner after I got hooked, because lol it's not like Nurse's Calling is a perk that exists. Other Survivor then got spotted sprinting right in front of the Killer towards my hook.
---
Survivor I unhooked died about 1 minute into the match. I unhooked him on his second hook. The Survivor who was sprinting to me called me bad because everyone hook swarmed and I died on hook as a result.
---
Rank 8 btw.

Can someone make a Transparent version of this so just the finger? I'll mod it into my game and post a picture to see how it looks in game.
---
I am literally. Overflowing. With excitement about the legion changes.  I don't know if I can wait a week for the changes to be announced.
---
Just a game unless you d/c again then 50% reduction and so on
---
Possibly repeat offenses skip up to 50% or higher, faster
---
Freddy poops on people who don't know how to loop, which the lower (higher?  Green and brown ranks) tiers are full of.  Stealth won't work against him, his weakness is looping.  I'm terribad at looping right now. I can't make the call of 'safe or unsafe' loop locations, I don't know distances for lunges, and I can't gauge movespeeds enough to know when I can loop again or I need to drop the pallet.  Despite all of these things, I can loop Freddy much longer than most survivors at my knowledge level (which is what rank is, not a measure of skill) because I don't freak out and I've abandoned the 'immersed' gameplay (which is hiding from the killer, trying to never be seen in the first place) which Freddy punishes really well.
---
Overall though, what I'd suggest is playing as Freddy if you can against better survivors.  Keep an eye out for how they get away (without doing camping or tunneling exclusively.  Those won't teach you how they beat you).  If you don't want to buy the DLC, watch some streamers face off against him.  Most of them play PC, but you can see what they do to counter him.
---
Idk I play SWF because when I play multiplayer games I play for communication and working as a team. There's no point in playing multiplayer without. Which is why when people who play multiplayer games that do have voice comms and then dont use a mic or dont try and communicate at a high level they shouldn't be playing multiplayer. Unless you have a disability there is no reason to not have a mic and use it.
---
Maybe its because I come from games like halo and counterstrike and competitive games but communication and working together is everything. 
---
As far as communicating means were not trying that's just not true. In fact most killer argument against SWF is their coordination and level of teamwork is too much to handle. We cant be "trying too hard, and not trying" at the same time.
---
I'm gonna run this now and its the only build and the only killer I am going to play. Thank you.
---
Some guy posted here how to do it too. Its gonna be a fun weekend....
---
On the survivor side, hitting skill checks is much smoother, easier. I still get hit when I run into latency issues, but far less drops in frames thus far. Haven't run into or played as a doctor yet since the pass, but I could see him still being problematic, with all the treatment screen effects. Playing as Nurse is vastly improved, but still tough. I also run around as Hag and Myers, and it has felt much smoother to me. Still lots of room for improvement, of course. Just my observations.
---
How...does the game mess up THAT badly?
---
Yeah, this is the worst situation when some experienced survivors want to bully a baby killer. I hope they add some kind of "enrage" end game, when gates are opened for a while and no one on a hook. Get out or get fucked !
---
I like to run it with spine chill and lithe for super fast vaults that blast me off to the moon also, healing to 99 and basically having old leader all the time is cool
---
Definitely should count.
---
I'm spiritually dead, so finding memes at the sexual level will have to do.
---
Basically this. I really don't think the aura reveal effect is that tangible of a downside. I think making it apply Broken would be a lot more effective and still keep in line with the perk's theme.
---
I didn’t say it wasn’t a 4 person game, just that I like it when survivors get salty and disconnect mid game.  They only screw themselves and their fellow survivors.
---
Link? Because I've seen no such post, and I searched for it too.
---
Youre not going to retroactively get what you've lost.  Its gone forever. But when they implement the changes in the mid chapter patch (no date yet) when someone DCs in the loading screen or doesnt connect you will return to lobby with all items and offerings.
---
Most things favor survivors, and it HAS to be that way. You need 80% of your players playing survivor at any given time. If killer was more desirable, then no one would ever get to play.
---
Out of Shape
---
Entitled killer main I presume.
---
Two killers? It's a bug. Apparently, it's a frequent one. You can consider it a exploit as well, as there seems to be a semi-consistent way of doing it.
---
Why op? Just cleanse 4 totems and leave toth, guaranted noed free end game and one less totem to find. Diversion only works when the rock is thrown very close to the killer for him to see the explosion.
---
But it lets a silent killer hear survivors talking.  It offsets the ability to communicate to teammates.  Makes it risky if playing against Wrath, Pig, Michael.  What you described about taunting could happen but that is why there is a report button no?
---
It's a bug. Two or more killers in a single trial is a bug that can be abused. There's a way of doing it, but I don't know what.
---
i think i recognize that gut... is that you Randy?
---
Platform: pc
---
Type: ingame/matchmaking
---
Description: Lobby started the game with 3 survivors, which me and my friend thought was weird. After finishing 1st gen he saw 2 killers via the perk. This could've been fun but 5 generators was too much.
---
Screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/jq06JB7
---
Steps to reproduce: go to the lobby, if it auto starts with 3 survivors then good luck ^^
---
Thanks for the link/info
---
Somehow the killer always sniffs out the person who threw a streamer and tunnels him into the ground.
---
Why do people keep bothering about pips? Do they change the gameplay at all in the end? Before the latest fix, every survivor was stuck at rank 4 or 5 and it was basically the new rank 1.
---
All of these things are getting fixed in the coming month. The ranking system was *just* fixed but they’re fixing even more to more accurately represent skill level. They’re reworking Freddy and Legion, getting rid of game breaking bugs (infinite load screen, 3 man games). For a company like BHVR they’re doing better than I’d ever expect. I mean, look at F13. I love that game but sheesh.
---
You mean the Discord overlay?
---
&gt; Most things favor survivors
---
LMAO.
---
Oh... that's  good one. you must be a comedian because that's the funniest shit I've read all day.
---
Time for some fat Myers gameplay!
---
Ultimate buff. Instantly SSS+ tier
---
I tried it and couldn’t get it to work earlier.
---
Huntress waifu did good
---
dunno.. my friends stopped playing dbd because it wasnt fun to play as a swf group when someone crashed every second game. if they actually fix the random loading screen crashes my friends might start playing again.
---
maybe enough people would start playing again and the queuetimes would actually decrease.
---
I'm new to the game so sorry if this question is dumb. What is p3?
---
I was actually going to ask if you had Corrupt Intervention on, and this was the Entity animations for when it blocks gens...
---
But no.
---
What a odd bug... or is this a feature?
---
You might have stumbled across something...
---
&gt; many of them were just changed to give you a different playstyle for better or worse.
---
I like that. That was the explicitly stated point of add-ons, and almost no killer's add-ons really do that. Sure, Nurse is good without add-ons and disgusting with, but that's not great design.
---
I think that was a kneejerk reaction. What do you think now?
---
This isn’t witch hunting. They did nothing wrong. Just highlighting the matchmaking in this game. They were good! I could have done without the t bagging but hey i deserved it, I’m a noob haha
---
Ok me when someone screws me over.
---
Don’t worry I fixed my post
---
Is this a new Wraith skin I’m unaware about or...?
---
Legion = DC
---
*megalovania starts*
---
* Angery survivors typing can be heard in the distance *
---
Alrighty, here's a few tips from your friendly local P3 Pig main-
---
Always try to get the first trap on before a generator pops
---
Ambushing works mostly for mindgames more than anything, shutting down potential loops
---
You can sometimes make a trapped survivor go out the gates, killing them instantly
---
I would go more in depth, but it sounds like you somewhat know what you're doing. Just have fun with it all
---
Prestige 3 and if you’re new then there’s no shame in asking questions
---
Well I think that it's a good way of designing addons in general, but that it didn't necessarily make Wraith a threat. Just gave Wraith players more options and QoL fixes, and survivors more adaptations to overcome. But I just don't think he's... great.
---
I would actually *like* if more killers were just plain good without addons ala Nurse, coming from someone who has a habit of leveling all my characters and starving them of addons.
---
I think Wraith fell into the buff trap, once he got his gameplay changes he was never likely to get anymore and I think he's due for even more. But hey Freddy and Legion are being changed so there's always time!
---
thrill of the hunt would slow down the process of cleansing (which would be a secondary objective, meaning it could be the equivalent of ruin in that aspect) and would also notify the killer of it. it surely would be an obstacle the survivors would have to deal with, and considering the killer only actually has one single objective—which is to sacrifice survivors—it could create a slight imbalance in the game.
---
but survivors also have tools to help them in order to overcome this problem, like small game, detective's hunch, etc. you're right, thrill of the hunt wouldn't be necessarily op, just annoying:/ but eh, my previous comments were mainly jokes, not very well thought, but it got a good laugh out of me lol.
---
The grind really kills it for me. I needed monitor and abuse so i leveled up doctor. Nurses calling so Nurse.  Ruin so Hag.   And then i gotta find them in the bloodweb.  
---
I know there has to be a grind but its daunting.
---
Sounds like the translation Identity V has..
---
They make the mend time take an ungodly amount of time I’ve heard different amounts but they range from 1-5 minutes to mend
---
i read it in Hulk Hogan's voice, thank you
---
Nice. Alright, yeah that makes sense
---
Kind of unrelated, but I played my first ever killer game last night. I had saved up a lot of bloodpoints, spent them all and got a survivor pudding and some decent add ons. Loading into the game, I got infinite loading screen. All of it was gone. Now I have nothing :)
---
I wanted adept bubba and played 4 games back to back and got all 4ks didn't camp or anything and the game never gave me the achievement I double pipped a game and still no achievement this happened 2 nights ago
---
Taste, but what do you build for her?
---
Killer mains teaming up to fight flashlight SWF's
---
you get'em, man! you tell'em! &lt;3
---
though i don't dodge cause don't want to wait for 20-30 minutes more. D:
---
In a weird way personally I kinda like having no voice chat because it forces you to get more creative with ways to communicate lol for example ya have the 'crouch and nod' and the 'multi crouch thank you/hello' depending on the situation

What’s scary is he could legit leave and not do anything for like an hour and you still couldn’t get hatch, alternatively you could leave and like go get lunch and he probably wouldn’t hit you because he seems hellbent on winning

fuck. guess its just me glovey boy.

Or proximity chat like in friday the 13th
---
i've only had this once last summer. i wish they'd come back :c i'm goofiest killer if you show you're friendly (it's like RP thing, especially if i play Rin, i mostly do, and someone plays with me and being cute, i can't kill them cause it's how i see Rin. she's that vengeful spirit but at the same time she's a young lady that didn't have enough love in her life so when survivors are cute, she's cute to them too).
---
all in all, killers and survivors need some friendly time every once in a while and what can be better than a pizza Dwight squad to circle basement hooks
---
That would be equally bad. The only thing a survivor can be more salty towards than the killer is their own teammate.
---
The reason this happens is because your hitbox when healing is the same as when standing.
---
It sucks, but it is what it is. Hopefully this gets changed.
---
Just to share a quick story I had a rare toolbox with some even greater add-ons then I got hit and was forced to drop it then i escaped and i saw someone pick up my toolbox and run off so i kept pointing at them and crouching then eventually they got the hint and gave it back lol
---
Yup! Just take the Bloodweb to level 50 three times.
---
oops, got the names mixed up.

Maybe it’s a rework for the hatch standoff?
---
I wonder what they’re planning for Legion, I can’t think of a way for them to make them less frustrating to play against unless they were to remove their ability to vault windows and pallets like survivors or remove deep wounds from them, either way I’m excited for these mid chapter changes to everything.

Can we not pretend Dead Hard requires any skill? It’s literally just Free I-Frames. Either it’s gets baited and you get hit, or you effortlessly dodge a super easy to expect attack, there’s not many mental gymnastics there.
---
MOM isn’t really a perk about “skill” it’s about “sacrifice” It requires you to get the shit kicked out of you to work and then reveals your location after healing up.
---
I will admit tho if they make it to where killer powers give it tokens it will be stupidly broken, but as if it’s treading the line but not quite there yet. But the fact that some people have been comparing it to decisive is just laughable.
---
They can’t accept that the other survivors just suck.
---
He's said it slower before on stream, but everyone has a different interpretation of it. He's tried to explain it before, but I still didn't understand it.
---
When you see another repost on the sub
---
I agree!
---
These are all great things, but I’m still waiting on that console optimization patch that was supposed to come out in December...
---
Agreed, it does hamper my own enjoyment of playing Legion when they can be super obnoxious with fucked up addons.
---
I just wanna be able to play stabby emo teen without people wishing death on me.
---
Holy cow watching you heal with self care makes my eyes bleed i knew it was slow but not that slow
---
Yucky I don’t use either
---
Holy shit.
---
Freddy rework? Dedicated server updates?
---
You guys are doing a pretty good job so far. &lt;3
---
People who DC need to be banned. Plain and simple. You shouldn't need a reward for not disconnecting from matches consistently; that would be ridiculous.
---
If people don't want to play the game, then I say they uninstall and go play Civilisation instead of constantly DCing and ruining everyone elses time.
---
I really need to start posting the horseshit that happens to killers to balance out the spam from survivors
---
They started working on that last month I wanna say, my frames have definitely improved since they moved to a new version of the engine on console. They said it was a continuous project thought, so just check in from time to time on the game and see how it is.
---
But how will you know if they bring a Mori or not?
---
Got it so ironically. The Killer was farming so I just didn't let him hit me.
---
I hope energy is positive up at BHVR :)
---
Should have saved them, then. Or learn to hit a skill check. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
***No Sympathy for Deadweight/Weak players***

Unless you’re seriously challenged, or new? No sympathy.

Addons I go for speed and recovery. Before I P3'ed her I was running Haunted Ground, Ruin, BBQ and Third Seal. I try to go for Survivor disruption and totems because maps like Game, Swamps and Lerys are quite common from what I've seen and Third Seal makes coordination almost impossible until it's cleansed, its really underrated I think. And BBQ just for vision. I don't really like to follow any Metas and just build what seems fun.
---
I was thinking ... what if the Entity chooses a random player to become a second killer OR something along those lines?
---
Ok?
---
ZombieHugger has made loads of these awesome template if you want to use one
---
Start with the ridiculous hitboxes and work your way up, buddy.
---
I’d say camping because they think getting a kill is worth 3 gens popping, and tunneling depends on how you see it, sometimes people call going after the injured person tunneling, which it really isn’t, and sometimes it’s targeting someone even if it’s worse for you over all. I see tunneling as the latter, so there’s no excuse to me. I rarely end up as Ormond when I’m killer, but last time I don’t remember it being that bad.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/57097/developer-update-april-2019/p1?new=1
---
which killer do you play? do you use Predator? which platform?
---
Im not against it. In theory it would be great and should be how the mechanic works. But in reality, killers would have to mute survivors to avoid being abused. And its not always easy to just report even in games that have had it for years there's little actually punishment that comes from the reports.
---
I don’t main survivor, i play killer/survivor on rotation. But i only get game breaking shit like this on the survivor side.
---
Better listen. She'll be back in a blink
---
I mean like make it a perk like we'll make it, NOED, sloppy butcher etc. Ones not locked behind a character till you get the teachable
---
Some people just want to play the game man. If you want to farm message them while in the lobby prior to the match. I like to farm too but I usually only do it when there's a 2XBP event, that's when people typically look to doing it more than usual. Best thing to do though is to send a message. Before equipping the offering.
---
Thanks.
---
Depends on my mood, mostly cannibal to get bbq teachable, no predator, PS4
---
“It’s just one extra hit man” -the guy who could track a CIA as spirit
---
blood points ;(
---
Who thinks it’s not OP? I’d be willing to give 10 cents to any survivor who thinks so
---
Secret offering
---
and to camping, i honestly don't think it's cause they think it's worth it. it is worth it. i tried to camp one game and i got 4k. i played fair all other times, i didn't get shit even though it used to work pretty damn well. 
---
same with surviving for me. if the killer was camping or hard patrolling, he gets the kills because at the moment if you don't save you will have to max literally everything else including chase but how can you get proper chase with camping killer if you don't want to be camped later. they play on current altruism because right now it is necessary to pip and also there are much more reasons for survivors to pip than for killers.
---
Too bad the change is going to be something like "sleep timer now works like bleedout"
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
and
---
"terror radius reduced by 2 meters"
---
Huntress on PS4?
---
Wheres my ten cents
---
so you have Seen 3 Legions? wow, there must be a nest
---
The did some noticeable optimisation in 2.6
---
Haha neither should have tho. It seems to have been happening with others too. I saw one dude post a 3 killer vs 1 survivor match. Usually involves myers with all the ones I've seen
---
Except once he is near you you have no fucking idea where he is. Most Freddy's just run behind you and then hit you as soon as you enter the dream state and then you can't get far away from him because he has aura reading.
---
i don't know how it's on consoles but on pc it is heavily broken for killers. 
---
also, if you're low rank that might be it too cause lower ranks are just much easier to catch so you wouldn't know the red rank struggle on 100% survivor sided map.
---
He does, 50% of the Freddy's I have encounter tunnel and camp.
---
It’s for one of the most recent daily rituals - deep wound 4 survivors
---

i'm a killer main and i think it's op. used it less than 10 times(including green Moris) through over a year of playing. few times to remove frustration and couple times for Dying Light. 
---
the yellow Mori is pretty cool though. green is fine.

Does it work on ps4?

If you play freddy right you won't get into that scenario.

how does freddy differ from others in being unfun against?
---
OP you are good peoples, thanks for going above and beyond.

I tried it a couple times out of curiosity, but from what it looks like it doesn’t work on console at least. Which explains why most of these screenshots you see are pc.

You lost me at Hexagon
---
I'd bet the guy meant to say you can't wake up with self care.
---
I play Freddy because I can 4K most consistently with him
---
Go ahead and quit. We don't want you here.
---
Idk how you have all this shit happen to you. I've got like 30 hours on this patch and haven't seen a single thing yet you have all this sshit happen.
---
  Hey devs, thanks for the communication. I really missed them, even though I think your weekly streams were a bit redundant. I would love a monthly cast !
---
Good news for dedicated servers coming at the timing announced, I expect it will give a fresh breath and bring back burned out players like many of my friends who just couldnt stand the infinite loading and the inconsistent gameplay due to p2p lag spikes.
---
However, I'm sad to not find any discussion on the current game balance between solo survivors and swf. To this day, I'm very confused to why it has almost never been really debated here.
---
My point is : The game is absolutely not the same, balance wise, if you play solo or with a group or coordinated players. And I trully think the latest changes over the past months have screwed over solo players, while only nerfing the fun of swf who will now always rely on repairing gens as fast as ever to win the game, instead of trying bold moves to prevent hooks or save their mate.
---
A short list of changes in the past month:
---
- Healing increased to 20sec
---
- Sloppy butcher giving a permanent -20% healing speed until healed (when it was only some specific, timed addons which could do that before)
---
- Hooks placement rework and Saboteur being useless. The way you designed the hook spots make it impossible to wiggle out. Worse, iron graps and agitation which were once really good perks are never played now, because you have a hook proximity guaranted wherever you are, even for several survivor downed in the same spot.
---
I dont understand why changing saboing to increase the struggle timer instead of destroying the hook was never tried.
---
- Faster downed survivor pickup which makes flashlight / pallet saves harder, while the timing required to successfully do it remains terribly unforgiving. Any experienced killer knows how to counter or take avantage of attempts to save anyway (fake pickup, watching a wall...)
---
- hex : ruin buffed recently to affect all survivors. Played in 90% of high ranked games. Still kinda rng dependant of the map you play, and ultra punitive for average players who dont know all the spots. The latest plague perk which blocks 3 gens for a definite amount of time is way more coherent and should somewhat be the manner hex ruin should be designed as well. A meta perk like that shouldnt rely on luck, where it can be cleansed during the first 30 second of a game, and last during the whole trial in another because it appeared somewhere hard to find (lerys, the game, myers map)
---
- Large survivors hitbox and m1 lunge kinda autoguided (best example is a locker juke where you can clearly hear the wiff, but still take the hit while exiting the locker because the weapons can hit for far too much frames)
---
To this day, no avantage or real downside to use short m1 click or m1 hold "lunge" click. Simple fact, only inexperienced player (aka baby killers...) dont know the lunge move and will miss many of their attacks. Any experienced player will always use the lunge.
---
- Thanatophobia buffed
---
- Gen repair ajusted to the value it should have been before the prove thyself rework (still a repair speed nerf)
---
I cant remember the streamer name who did several 4 swf players session with or without perks and litterally crushed almost all killers they faced before all this changes occured. And I think many of them were oriented to counter the 4 swf group.
---
I dont get why a system has not been implemented that would adjust the "difficulty" depending on the number of swf players (kinda the opposite of WoW dungeon group were you are buffed while playing with random players)  this could be a general action speed debuff or skill check difficulty. Something that would not affect solo players.
---
You also never really put more information for solo survivors. I dont want a voice chat in game, but why cant I see the perks/items of others survivor in lobby? Why cant I have a totem count or just a notification sound when one gets cleansed? Why cant I have somehow a default kindred perk when tagging solo? Why cant I have just a little more ways to give indication through emote to other survivors...
---
Balancing should be done with key idea in mind : Adjust the gameplay as if it was a 4swf by default. Nerf or buff all you want, balance the game around it being played as 4 people together in vocal against one killer, and then give the tools to 4 random people for a fair match. I always get the feeling that you're still running after the original idea, when swf did not exist.
---
At this point, all the games are kinda the same and the outcome is mostly known within the first 2 minutes. As killer you either down someome quickly and can put enough pressure for the rest of the game, or the first chase takes too long and you're in trouble, only saved by Ruin if no one destroyed it yet.
---
This sounds familiar and the gameplay has always been oriented like this. But after almost 3 years of existence and countless patch and chapters I never experienced this scenario as much as today. And many players or streamers and feeling the same.
---
Slowly, the game lacks any kind of diversity.
---
Every killer m1 attack must hit. Every survivor downed is guaranted to be hooked.
---
I'm also surprised that after countless map layouts rework, pallet adjustement, looping spot changes, ect... you never changed the basement which is now more than ever a game over location if the killer really wants to secure his kills, and I've seen so many ideas that would add interesting stuff without removing the "dangerous place" we all are attached to.
---
Dont judge me wrong. I love the game, its so unique and it still give me so much fun. But I want my fun back, I want surprise, I want survivors trying to risk all to save their asses. I miss the games where people would go yolo and take hits and borderline saves without being punished and doomed as it is now. 
---
I want full on pre-remake Freddy.
---
You do a generator, it grows wires which pulls survs in.
---
You unhook Jake... it's actually Freddy.
---
Freddy turns into a worm and eats you as mori.
---
I think one major factor is that there's very little punishment for leaving a game. I think there's 3 big problems:
---
Many people don't care about losing pips because higher rank doesn't give any kind of reward and leads to more difficult matches. 
---
The loss of bloodpoints also matters to people less if they're high level and already have the perks they care about.
---
Disconnecting stops you from losing valuable items and addons.
---
Ikr, apparently there is no such thing as fun for us console users. Tbh, the only reason I want to do this is to meme with friends. Hopefully, some genius out there can figure out how to preform the glitch on console and inform us. They’d be a really awesome person lol.
---
Where your bro fucks your mom~
---
Sweet home Alabama 
---
Lord my cousin is my dad
---
moris arent op lol. they have to catch and hook you at least once, then catch and down you a second time. you really think if they can do it twice theyre gonna have more trouble a third time? i view moris as the killer version of the hatch. both let you skip straight to the end once certain conditions are met.
---
survivor main btw
---
Leddit's the only reason I know how to abuse that shit now.
---
No, PS4 matchmaking is just garbage lobby simulator, unfortunately lol.
---
I'll take it
---
I’ve always hated that there is zero communication options for this game
---
freddy buff, legion nerf, infinite loading screen patch, must be christmas!
---
r/entitledkillers
---
the yellow is fair
---
Whenever i get a bug, i post it here the same day it happened. So all the videos I posted today all happened today.
---
For reference what’s swf?
---
Downvoting to raise awareness about my small pp
---
neither of those perks needs a buff.
---
There is basically a bug where a survivor can queue up with other survivors, and they can swap to Killer.  So SWFs turns into KYF, with one rando killer going WTF is going on in my game.
---
I'm in the opposite camp. I'm glad it doesn't exist and don't want it. People are abusive as hell in this game, and I don't want to hear them being jerks. I have my messages set to friends only, never get hate mail, and I prefer it that way.
---
If only people could stop dodging me just because I have flashly cosmetics or happen to join at the same time as someone else playing the same person I am, seriously stop it!
---
i’m so exited for the freddy rework. freddy is a terrifying horror icon in the movies, and the game doesn’t deliver that. i’m really exited.
---
It's a bug that's been all over the subreddit since the PTB. For some reason the survivors scale up about 20 times.
---
So killers having to go up against sweaty survivors is the solution?
---
You’ve never watched jojo? And yet you approach our memes instead of running away? Well come as close as you’d like! 
---
But to be honest, I’d definently take a peek at the show. Its pretty good, I’m not really into anime, but jojos bizarre adventure definently holds a spot in my anime shows catagory.
---
Yup! I have this happen pretty often with Freddy
---
Well I mean.... I have all of them except the Plague... I didn’t find them that difficult, but I guess so...
---
freddy buff- 300% movement speed, all survivors in the dream world constantly, can teleport, 100% skill check chance every second, no totems to cleanse, exit gates do not open
---
PC or Console?
---
I feel like not having it is why I don't get salt messages. I've gotten one in my two years of playing, because it takes more effort to go to a profile and type it out than it does to send in game chat. I'm honestly glad It's not in console play, idk if I would even be interested if it is. People are needlessly trollish, rude, and salty.
---
It seems like I’m not going to be able to change your opinion on these changes so I’m not going to repeat myself anymore. If you want to see things though a negative light only, I only hope it doesn’t bleed into your enjoyment of the game. Stay Safe in the Fog.
---
Discord username checks out
---
I just don't find them fun to fight. The mend just seems really annoying and boring to deal with not mentioning the bugged addons that constantly add time to the mend timer, and how a lot of legion players are just kind of scummy in general. And on top of legion not really having any true counterplay to their power (note I don't think they're OP, just that their power has very little genuine counterplay. Doesnt mean that I think they're good.)
---
- You replied to me first LOL
---
- It’s a very common reddit joke that went way over your head.
---
- I’m really loving your trend of “I didn’t get the joke, so I’m just gonna be angry and pretend that offering basic legion counterplay knowledge that everyone knows somehow makes the killer less mend-y!”
---
I have also had that happen, just this was more recent for me is all. Your's is most definitely worse by a longshot. Getting tunneled is more gameplay than not getting to play at all, so I feel for there.
---
Rip
---
Awesome to hear what the plan is, even if it's a bit down the road.
---
Can’t help it if they got tunneled. I think they meant great skillchecks. So get off your high horse
---
I think this is one of the most underrated perks in the game, depending on your play style. I don't bring self care or a healing item either (solo Q). I run it on all characters and wont heal unless I'm on death hook. 
---
Those extra seconds add up quickly over the course of a match and have clutched an Adrenaline proc to help team mates so many times. Even better if you run into a plague with a team that doesn't cleanse.  Def a keeper in my opinion.
---
Bruh you need to be following the killer with that camera lmao. About to give me a heart attack as well.
---
Oh, at least people are doing it to their friends, and not random killers being assigned the same game.  Makes it a little better.  Still busted as fuck tho.

Cool. That's a good point
---
you know the joke “you don’t have to run faster than the bear, just the person next to you”?
---
that’s what sandbagging basically is
---
Civilization is my go-to when I’m not playing Dead by Daylight though so I’m offended but just a lil bit.
---
Like them CHONKY CHONKY
---
Thanks :)
---
No I had a couple of hits this game but I didn’t get a chance to hook anyone. They all escaped after t bagging and then I got to see that I was the only one with only one perk haha
---
I mean... if you’re good at killer, SWF won’t always screw you over. I play 2-4man SWF often cause I’m lucky enough to have friends who play the game, and we win some but we lose plenty, too. Plenty of games where only one of us makes it out, or none of us. Shrugs. But if you’re expecting to *always* get kills... that’s cute, but it’s wrong.
---
&gt;everyone thinks hes a bad killer but he's really not
---
He really is.... Freddy is the only killer where if you gave his power to another killer, you would be making the killer weaker.
---
If you kick gens often, overcharge is a decent perk. Even works with ruin.
---
You're free to your opinion of course, but I love blood warden and don't think it's rare at all to get a hook after the gates are open. 
---
You say it's hard to meet and I wouldn't try to say that you haven't had your experiences.. but there's really 3 ways the end game goes. Either killer kills all survivors before the gates are powered, the gates get powered and the killer doesn't successfully down and hook a survivor after that, or the gates get powered and the killer gets at least one more hook. 
---
Of the 2 endgames where the gates get powered, in my experience when the last gen pops I'm far more likely to be in a chase, or readily able to reach that gen to start a chase than not. 
---
Blood warden can kick off amazing end game blow outs and if you get used to factoring it in to your gameplay you can be more consistent with it. It's not about being 'lucky' getting a hook endgame, it's about *planning* getting a hook endgame.
---
I think a simple way is to provide iridescent shards as a reward at the reset, give people a reward for ranking up, I like being in the higher ranks because it makes me feel more gratified but it seems most people don't feel that way about it. 1,500 iridescent shards for R1-4 1,000 for 5-8 500 for 9-12, none for anyone being under r12
---
I don’t think they do either, but it wouldn’t do any harm to put them together, and the perks go together quite well. Sort of how bbq would mesh with the “bloodpints for hooking survivors” part if it was a separate perk. Just seems like a smart thing to do with no downsides.
---
Are there options so it repeats while you hold down a button or it infinitely repeats until you tell it to stop?
---
*eyes glow* **Its nightmare time bitch**
---
This is actually touched upon in the matchmaking section. The new matchmaking that was used briefly will be making a comeback once some final tweaks are made. This should greatly reduce your queue times regardless of the platform you're on.
---
Can't just tease the rework like that, I need more than just a little taste hahaha.
---
1) dodge SWFs. it's blatantly unfair to you
---
2) bring NOED. totems are intended as a secondary objective to counter it and that's part of the reason gens go so fast. survivors decided to screech that doing totems isn't faaaaaaiiiiirr
---
Freddy fading away as he's being reworked: Entity, I don't feel so good...
---
I thank you all and have a fun weekend. Games are for fun not stress so please destress.
---
Nobody needs swf they enjoy playing with friends entitled shit heads like you that think they are better then everyone say that. Just because you get your ass beat by swf
---
Coming from you? You’re a toxic piece of shit
---
I can confirm that we are not just talking about a Mix Tape change, we're talking about the Legion as a whole.

It's like the best time to be a killer right now.
---
Go to play some casual SWF with a friend. Bring Bloody Party Streamers that I've been keeping just to use when playing with him.
---
* Match one 3 Survivors against a face camping Doctor with NOED.
---
* Match two 3 Survivors against a Spirit who loses connection about 40 seconds into the match.
---
* Match three I'm the only person who loads in and the Killer just DCs instantly.
---
Behavior I'd like my Bloody Party Streamers back please.
---
You're implying that scoping is an option
---
I'm lucky in that regard, I only recently got them so I don't have anything to unlearn on them.
---
I just hope that if they're removing cheese and busted addons, they give Legion something to account for those changes because playing them without either of those is a big oof in my, admittedly limited, experience.
---
by "rework" and "changes" do they mean rework and change them outta the game ayyy amirite fellas
---
Last two swapped for me, Freddy is my favorite slasher.
---
That’s what you call a trashy killer
---
Me too good work keep it up.
---
I duo with my friend most of the times. Im around rank 15 and he is around 10. Im usually lowest by the rank. Getting rank 9 killer is painful :c.
---
Also my killer rank is 20. I have played 2 games as killer, all survivors were rank 14-16. Not playing killer any time soon, not before I know the maps well enough. Too bad all my daily rituals are about killers, I'm just giving free wins away.
---
Unfortunately I don’t think it counts cause the game does eventually end since it’s a bleed out timer, it’s just annoying and ruins the fun.
---
The Developer Update shows that they're working on it, but it still really sucks when it happens and I wish it would be fixed faster.
---
i wish they would up the punishment for campers its really boring to just die because of it
---
What? Full Freddy rework? Why the fuck are they going to ruin my boy?
---
Wow!  Thanks for the update, looking forward to it.
---
Idk he’s stopping the game from progressing in anyway, he had the capability to hook everyone of you.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MLLMASSXSg
---
I got a little dizzy *writing* it.
---
They aren’t working on what needs to be fixed, all that’s gonna happen now instead of playing a game with 3 survivors you’ll get sent back to the lobby and the killers will leave. Looking for another game
---
My first 5 games I dropped every single pellet I saw until I spectated my friend and learned to use them. Would be nice if tutorial included more of the basic stuff.
---
**HE BROUGHT MENDING TIME ADD ONS**
---
Is anybody else massively fucking disappointed by the fact that they are fully reworking Freddy? He was my best killer and was fine the way he is...
---
Sounds like we're in the exact same boat.
---
Mid to high tier survivors just seem like serious pussies, honestly. I get random killer D/Cs quite a bit but survs are by far worse. 
---
I don't get it. I like playing against Freddy.
---
Fuck Legion, though.
---
Big disagree. His only ability is to track survivors that are far away from him, other than that he's a default killer and needed work to keep up.

Even intermediate players such as I consider the Grind to be a bit of a hassle. I have to get Wraith all the way from 7 to 35 just to get Bloodhound for my Huntress and eventually Legion, and that's after spending so long getting my Nurse from 11 to 40 (STILL haven't seen A Nurse's Calling in my Huntress bloodwebs in like 5 levels, and I don't have much else to gain on Huntress considering she and nurse are the only characters I have above level 10). I'd talk more about the perks I want to get and the time it would take but you already know what I'm going through.
---
I enjoy both sides of the game - I also enjoy this reddit community and the discussion posts that come with it. I can understand why you feel like nothing will change and also understand why you think I am arguing this from the point of a killer only (because the screenshot shows a killer of course).   
---
You make a good point with NOED - but, I find it engaging to discuss what might make NOED fairer (like actually showing us when we're exposed maybe, instead of having to gauge whether the killer is faster all of a sudden). But, people complained about DS and now we have a much fairer DS, which is anti-tunnel, and anti-toxicity (stops you being farmed as easily, negates some of the damage that bad teammates can cause). I just really like this game and would like to see it improved in some ways. I'm not out on a witch hunt, I really hope I've gotten across what I'm trying to say here.
---
Look at all this positivity just from the devs communicating and acknowledging things the community has questioning. Just communicate is all, so we're on the same page, we want the game to be in its best state.
---
I hope with Dedicated Servers will keep SWF groups together so we don't have to keep reinviting. A more streamlined game will keep matches moving along, no wasted time setting up lobbies
---
ive had it too. seen people saying its a bot, but im not sure how true that is
---
I think taking the game hostage is reserved for when it simply can’t progress without someone quitting, like a survivor camping on an inaccessible spot or the killer body blocking in a corner and doing nothing else. Since the game is progressing, albeit incredibly slowly, I don’t think it fits.
---
You track people and keep them progressing super slowly. If you play him correctly he can be extremely strong. Also the dream world was the only way I can see survivors and there’s a good chance they are ditching that :(
---
According to a poll I did on this community, more than half of players dc in matches.
---
I think this likely contributes to the suggestion for harsher penalties never gaining much popularity (as much as it deserves).
---
Honestly, i dont even remember the last time there was a fun bug
---
None of those things are an excuse to DC. Just play the game out and kill your self on hook at least. Don’t make excuses to ruin the game
---
Sorry for the newbie question, but how do these chats work? I thought you can't communicate with the killer in the middle of a match?   
---
Or is this whole thing fake?
---
Lol
---
It's worth noting David that I know nothing of coding and the actual guts of the game, so of course I would oversimplify what could be a fairly big task - I don't mean to suggest it would be simple and I agree that the game does seem to get jankier with every update. Remember when Dead Hard used to almost sort of work?
---
I use NOED frequently and get salt every single match lol
---
How come they (or any games with freddy) can't get original freddy licence? Just curious :s
---
So those are an excuse to be a crybaby and DC. Good on you brother. Nice.
---
Man I don’t know what I was thinking
---
The difference between 2 and 3 hooks is massive for the amount of time saved chasing a survivor a third time and the amount of perks that can be ignored after immediately downing a second time.
---
That boy's perks need some serious TLC too.
---
You did clear as day, and no offense I didn’t mean to attack you but. I enjoy this game a lot but there is so much wrong with the game that a punishment for disconnecting isn’t going to fix anything. First and foremost the servers are the biggest issue, I don’t know how many times I’ve been 5-10m from a window just for a killer to stretch his arm that distance and hit me, or for a pallet stun to not count because on the killers screen I hadn’t threw the pallet yet
---
Currently, there’s no reward for ranking atm. (hope they’ll change someday) 
---
The only good thing for playing as high rank is you’ll get less camping and tunneling, because most high rank killers play fair, but lots of tryhard tbh.
---
You can use the post-game lobby to get the killer's profile and add them to send messages, and use the Steam app on your phone to type.
---
Pretty much the same deal.
---
YOU CAN'T SAY THE 'M' WORD THAT'S RACIST
---
Did it get changed in the past few days? If not then you’ve got it backwards. MoM won’t protect you if you’re injured.
---
post game, sure, but not mid game
---
Yeah, I've had this a couple of times, I think that's absolutely the case - when the game gets harder people just trey to depip and fuck up newer players.
---
he dun goofed
---
The OP said the guy only started messaging after he died. That's the same thing that we can do on Steam.
---
In fact, it's even easier to do mid-game on Steam due to the simplicity of the Steam overlay compared to navigating the menus of a PS4.
---
***waited 20 years for a lobby***
---
**Face Camping Legion**
---
I really hope they don't make him worse
---
Controller on pc?
---
Or any map with any perks when you're not Nurse.
---
I'VE HAD THIS IDEA SINCE LIKE LAST OCTOBER! I figured if two Killers could go up against 6-8 Survivors on the bigger maps with more/harder to complete gens, it would hopefully be pretty easy to tweak into balance and be an amazing addition to the game! I love playing with my friends but the downside to that is that I'm a Killer main bc I suck as Survivor so I never do well and usually just martyr myself for my friends that actually care about escaping bc they know they have a chance. My dream is that someday my friends could team up on a killing spree and have a good time trying to figure out Killer pairs and perk matchups, like maybe a Jumpscare Myers with a Distressing Doctor, or team the Trapper and Huntress and go for a basement strat, just for gits and shiggles.
---
Yeap
---
I think it’s a pretty decent demonstration of balance. It means good communication doesn’t guarantee that SWF will always perform better than the killer. It just makes strategy possible, but still not always successful. Idk, I always feel like SWF is built up in some killers’ heads as inherently unfair but... you just gotta learn to outplay them is all. Toxic SWF not included obviously, but they’d be toxic solo too so it’s kind of a moot point.
---
What “type” of killer?
---
Still the only mechanic I despise. It's not enjoyable in the slightest. Both sides lose due to the time wasted.
---
I'd give away my ability to Mori. Legit.
---
Not once have I complained about anything else. From Decisive Strike to Mettle of Man — nothing's worse than the autistic stare down.
---
inb4 I get told to give it away.
---
"No."
---
Don't you ducking dare....
---
Michael looks cool bloody :o
---
is this sarcasm or do you actually think someone would stand there pressing the attack button for ten minutes rather than just going afk? hell if that were the case attacking doesnt even make sense because alot of the time when this happens survivors will purposely get hit to heal so they can farm which means you get points and potential pips.
---
you are very correct. i'm red rank killer/survivor every season for almost a year now, i've never been dcing till Legion as survivor and before pipping change as killer but through over a year i only dc'd couple times maybe cause got really much bullied by very very toxic swfs. and i say very very toxic who abused all they could. 
---
right now i dc quiet often. as both sides. as killer because i am not efficient anymore. i have to go tryhard builds or camp in order to get kills and i really don't enjoy it. the game change after Plague chapter made killers lose momentum with tiny little things that less experienced players can't notice: you get stuck on invisible things in loops way too often, the chase starts with a delay, the scratch marks appear with a delay, the walls and obstacles unrealistically muffle survivor noises, chase music is too loud, hitboxes are extremely weird - i've missed way too many hits when people vault and i know my range, i've literally perfected Freddy and Spirit with timing, range and everything, i have steam comments where people i killed with Spirit say i got insane skill with her. but right now i am like a baby, can't do things i used to be able to do cause of how trash these small bugs/flaws are.
---
as survivor i dc even more. so i run the killer for a very respectable time to give my teammates a bit to fix a gen or two, i go down, gen progression stops but everyone crouches around instead of at least working on gens/cleanse. then i get saved while already in struggle stage and of course killer comes back for me, downs and of course i dc cause i already lost a pip might as well lose two. because i have to go out of my way to pip on simple purple ranks, as in have to be greedy with saves, gens, go tryhard in chase, i don't fukin see why i don't just take a quick escape if it's instachainsaw Billy, Huntress that proxy camps whole game or damn Nurse who comes back to hook second after you're unhooked and 5 gens still require fixing. basically, if i can't play with my beloved red rank brothers who stay there with me every season why even bother? i loved being on reds. it was 90% skilled killers who don't camp much, 90% skilled teammates who do gens, saves, kite killers for over 20 seconds. i don't like being amongst diversed players, i want my old friend randoms back.
---
Perfection
---
god rest it's soul.
---
I meant the hook decay, like the time it takes to die.
---
that hasn't been touched, and it isn't effected by the killer being nearby
---
Usually when I’m killer and get an early DC I’ll see one dude just teabagging the air or some shit like I’m not supposed to play anymore and lose a pontential pip like it’s a rule somewhere. Enjoy the hook.
---
I'm a Killer main from PS4, I can confirm. I play SWF occasionally with one or two pals, and there's usually a random who just hides all game and will lead the Killer to us to save themselves. They usually die anyways, but it's still toxic as hell. I do the opposite: I suck as Survivor so I martyr myself for my friends to guarantee their survival either by hatch or by exit gate bc they actually take playing Survivor seriously and have a chance to escape and do well.
---
Exactly. Survivors act like total shitheads whenever they use streamers, I hate using BPS.
---
-You now need to double pip, before a 4k was enough
---
-They made double-pipping harder, it's 3x iri + 1 gold now.
---
-They made the emblems harder to get
---
The current emblems punish you for winning  too hard as well, so you need to "play with your food" whilst being "merciless" (like literally that's what you need to do, you need a roflstomp where you basically force the survs to farm)
---
Plus if you have the app on your phone, it takes next to no time at all to read and even reply!
---
it's just amusing to me from a survivor standpoint because i know as long as i just stand there and wait there's absolutely nothing the killer can do. just walk away and let him have it because unless they make a mistake(which granted can very obviously happen) you get nothing but 15 minutes of wasted time. i know it sucks to have that one person get away after a flawless game but sometimes that's just how it be fam.
---
Yep
---
that would be a macros and people just getting the bp cause actual games suck right now and farming is boring. they just turn this shit on and leave.
---
Oh lol, I’m around 12/12 each 
---
Highest I got was lvl 8 killer the last time a blood rush event was going on
---
Don’t have the meta perks available for every1 to really practice
---
Tunnuling is just unfun to a survivor. Otherwise, it is a perfectly usable strat. I personaly dont do it because i hate when i get tunneled. Its up to you to chooses your playstyle. 
---
And people hate legion because there is no counter play to his power. You cannot avoid his attack, it is nearly immposible to escape him, and there is a discusting strat that people use that just make it infuriating to play against him.
---
You can, actually. If you look in Steams 'Recent players' menu once a game has started, it tells you who you're playing against and you can go to their profile. 
---
Once had a guy literally crouch next to people on hook and not unhook them to taunt them, and then he would bodyblock people from being able to go to the pig's boxes to get their traps off. The killer started to farm with him when he was the last one left and I added the killer and messaged them like 'that dude literally has 1k points and has done nothing but sandbag us all game' and the killer killed his ass instantly. Instant Karma.
---
The guy was just 'what the fuck?' at the end of the game because he thought he was going to get the last 3 gens and get out (he literally got two people killed by body blocking the last trap box they needed so we were only able to get 2 gens done) and then was furious when the killer was like 'yeah i don't farm with shitlords.'
---
I couldn’t care less if I pip or not. I DC when I get blatantly tunneled or if my teammates are trying to screw me over or not doing the objective/ urbaning around the whole map. I’m not going to waste my aggravation and time on a game where the other side is trying to ruin my fun. The best bet to fix DCs is to improve the quality of matches.
---
Freddy is gonna be nerfed so hard 
---
He's plenty viable atm, and I don't mean to be rude, is used wrong. He has some of the BEST stall in the game, even if your rng is terrible.
---
His add ons are phenomenal too, I just can't do this.
---
The forums have been blowing up about it too Freddy ISNT bad. He was memed to DEATH however.
---
I like this idea! What if the position of the gates changes or the hatch jumps around? Whoof
---
Doesn’t Agitation only increase radius when carrying a survivor? Usually you won’t be carrying a survivor and be in a chase at the same time so it doesn’t really synergize with M&amp;A.
---
You feel like you're about to have a bad time...
---
fitting, since that picture is from when he dies.

---
I missed that part, my bad.
---
A lot of "We're doing stuff!" but there's an awful lack of actual details.
---
I am waaay too cynical with the gaming industry to be excited for any of this.
---
I played against the legion the other day that had the add-on for longer mending time. Holy shit, is that broken or what? I was mending for 2 minutes at a time. It was ridiculous!
---
95% it’s not, and even if it is it’s worth the risk. With the matchmaking the way it is getting matches are quick as solo and there aren’t any real consequences for doing it
---
Lol. 
---
Imagine loading in as a clueless survivor when the camera rotates around you and you see your fellow survivors (as killers) all standing by you like this.
---
I would be down to farm if everyone in the lobby threw down a BPS. Other than that, it’s no different than a pudding to me.
---
I wouldn't doubt it if they manage to put him in to fortnite
---
No I’m just gonna wait to post it.
---
Also female characters have hitboxes slightly taller than their model.
---
Yeah as killer I wait like 20 seconds tops. Literally no reason to get worked up over it.
---
True
---
I know the hitboxes are enormous but this shouldn't have hit.
---
I don't think anyone expects you to farm because of one early DC but I will usually give last survivor the hatch since I got to play an unfair game of 3 survivors 5 Gens.  I don't need a toxic little shit of a survivor to gift wrap my wins for me.  A little sportsmanship goes a long way but play however you want.  I just try to play with integrity.
---
Technically speaking, a survivor running within the killer's FOV counts as a chase, so it is actually to get a chase while carrying a survivor. The chances are low and Killer will probably never commit to the "chase," but the fact that the chase music still plays means that chases can in fact be initiated while carrying survivors.
---
Maybe not for the individual players, but it'd balance out overall.
---
Your the man lol. Been trying to find somewhere to stream it
---
The game progresses for the killer. What are you talking about? you were given a real good situation where something actually is taking the game hostage and you've ignored it. All game progression for everyone in the match needs to be stopped in order for it to be taking the game hostage. Just because the killer can do something doesn't mean he needs to in order to progress the game. If everyone bleeds out the match ends. Thus moving the game forward. It's literally what you said before you made the stupid claim that slugging is holding the game hostage. They're just trolls.
---
You can use the program Reshade to alter the visual elements of the game. Seems to work well for some people that need assistance with color.
---
The point is large Terror Radius, the point is complete BS nonsense Terror Radius.
---
After all, if your heartbeat is consistently inconsistent, it's basically equivalent to have no Terror Radius, right?
---
(I considered Insidious because it gradually changed the Terror Radius, but decided Distressing was more important so the contrast of the Terror Radius going from 100 to 0 would be more harsh.)
---
I hope your as "exited" as all 4 survivors are against current Freddy
---
They did improve totem spawning quite a lot tbh
---
This has got to be the most TR centered confusing build I've ever seen (Thanx for that btw :3), but I wonder... Does Dark Devotion pass on the TR from a frenzy stab? 
---
Reason I ask is because Frenzy stabs don't currently provide MoM stacks, and Neither does a Nurses Blink strike. Nurse also doesn't trigger Dark Devotion when she blink strikes making me believe that her lack of applying MoM stacks is related to this, so I am unsure if Legion is like Nurse in that aspect or not. Has anyone unlocked Dark Devotion on legion and tested to see if Frenzy stabs trigger it? Because if they do, I'd love to pour some points into Legion and make this build... It's really gotta mess with survivors heads.
---
It's really not that bad. I mean look at Haddonfield and mount Ormond. These maps are a fucking joke
---
Maybe 4 out of 5 games (not counting games where i end up dying) i barely make it out by my shirt. With a mori there’s almost no chance besides a hatch escape and usually i don’t make it that far anyway if i’m found first because they want to guarantee the mori. I’d rather give myself a worthwhile chance than risk it on a 1 in 4 shot to get hatch and possibly fail as well.
---
Had one as Freddy, and everyone felt the effects that round so it wasn't just me.
---
I like the changes but for reals tho, f that guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8UQ4O7UiDs
---
Sorry to interject but just because a killer doesnt have counterplay doesnt necessarily mean they're OP. What he means is that there's no way to prevent legion from getting his stab and inflicting deep wounds/progressing the meter, which is true provided the legion isn't brain dead tbh. This doesnt mean the killer is good necessarily, it just means there's no real counter
---
Ruin, sloppy butcher, bbq and chilly, and a perk of your choice to make the chase or location easier. possibly enduring or unrelenting due to her short distance swing.
---
If the killer wants to farm I do my best to get them at least 20k blood points since they’re doing me a solid. I also take the opportunity in these farming games to finish a daily or two.
---
As opposed to one who wants to farm
---
I just turned off messages because it was just pure trash that people were sending me. Life’s too short for the toxic shit.
---
Yeah but do those people who have thousands of hours not want something different to happen for once?
---
Hey, baby  
---
Wanna see the "evil within"?
---
This is ground control, we copy
---
As a Freddy main I feel this deep in my soul.  I've gone from looking forward to next month to dreading it in the span of a single Developer update.
---
thats the coolest shit ever
---
I honestly don't remember a version of the game without Dead Hard shakes.
---
Funny how people are downvoting you even though you're right.
---
How bout killer uninstalls every time they lobby dodge a difficult looking group (not because of ping)? I’m not against killer, i play as Nurse, Myers, Freddy, and LF from time to time, but bringing a mori is just not fair no matter what perspective.
---
Sounds cool maybe it creates a smoke like aura that surrounds the map after the gates or hatch are open and survivors will suffer from hindered if they stay in it for too long after some time they get expose stat and after a long time their aura is shown.
---
 
---
Before this happens both killer and survivor get a message saying
---
The entity grows impationt then the smoke effects start to effect the map
---
I have almost 2k hours and I'd be happy playing this game mode for the foreseeable future as long as they did bugfixes.
---
Clutch essentially means pulling off a Longshot action right when it's needed. 
---
  
---
See also: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_hitter
---
Yup. happend to me twice in a row both games started 3 players and the killer tunneled me to death both times lol got no points
---
**Clutch hitter**
---
A clutch hitter is a baseball player with a knack for coming up with the "big" hit. The big hit is typically a game-deciding hit, sometimes a home run, often coming with two outs, although it can be any hit or play with a significant impact late in a game. However, a clutch hit could come as early as the first inning. Being known as a clutch hitter is a position of high honor and responsibility, as the clutch hitter is recognized as the "go-to guy" for the team, and his exploits in pressure situations are celebrated by both fans and players alike.

New background music:”dream is collapsing” from inception
---
Because being chased with zero counterplay isn't fun. Add that on top of the bloodhound cheese and double blade exploit that's currently going around and I don't blame people at all for dcing against that garbage killer.
---
Best killer should be evil ash
---
Lobby wait times have been horrible for me lately, especially late at night. It sucks because I work late so a lot of the time I can’t even get on until 1 AM my time.
---
Happened to me the other day also. Was like...uh, okay...cool.
---
then why the FUCK play it ?
---
If you know how can you give me a heads up? Method I saw earlier didn’t work “no disconnect message upon unreadying”
---
is this real? i have been waiting for a didicated server for so so so long
---
I'm a hoarder too. My husband is always surprised when he sees my collections, asking why I NEED 74 purple flashlights, or 200 brown medkits.
---
How?
---
Today I got reported for hacking. I had gotten a grab that would usually be impossible right after a hit, but I had save the best for last, so I assumed that was what they thought the hacking was.
---
I explained this, and the survivor said I was hacking because I didn't have hands.
---
I don't understand either.
---
Literally happened to me last night. Used the streamers and I was the first one to get hooked and they didn't attempt to save me. That's what I get for playing with randoms lol
---
Killers that camp your body. Probably does it when there’s 5 gens left too.
---
I can’t charge the shot out of mettle of man without getting closer

---
Micah is that you?
---
Somehow, it’s more disturbing than her half-rotted face.
---
Then somehow it doesn't stun mmmmmmmm
---
*angery loud*
---
Remember when this happened in 2016.. and the devs fixed it.. just like they fixed infinite loading.. and when they fixed a hundred other bugs that they'd somehow break again a while later.
---
I think killers should be allowed to close it after some time. Or survivors should do their fair share of work like get chases for a certain amount of time or repair the equivalent of generators or healing others and unhooking, and they can all stack together so if you do a small amount of each, hatch will open that's fair right cause people who hide the whole game or are douches and get hatch is angering and hatch Stand offs are dumb and survivor sided too much. That's at least fair
---
You’re the problem, OP. If you’re dcing on loading screens you fuck up the game for those who don’t dc. Good thing when I bring a secret offering and players dc before loading screen I farm. Even it’s an ebony I’ll gladly farm. Would rather waste the secret offering than make the game extremely unfun and going for moris (if it is one) in a 3v1. 
---
I’ll also dodge players who have done it before if they’re a streamer and I saw in past streams they have dcd on loading screens to secret offering or I’ll bring a secret and farm with the rando(s). Extra step to being a cunt: call the streamer out on his shit if I brought a shroud or splinter and he has actual viewers that aren’t his parents or the players in his swf (usually 2 friends because dcers on loading screen don’t have more friends to play with as they can’t fuck over randoms any other way)
---
Also, it doesn’t encourage camping. Unless it’s altrustic survivors no one is unhooking vs a camper with a secret offering. Sure, it encourages tunneling, but it depends on what your definition of tunelling is.
---
Well, obviously a high amount of people in this subreddit finds memes amusing, sorry for you that you don't, i guess your life is boring without any humor. And so you get me straight: 
---
These. Are. No. Lies.
---
They said in a stream they will not punish lagg-switching. They said they are banning people that DC too often, but still it is a problem, but it got better. And that with the legacy skins is just how i wrote it, there is nothing wrong in this meme.
---
Yup, I've had instances where I had to wait 30 minutes for a match. Hell I'm waiting right now and it's been what feels like forever. Resetting doesnt even work it just draws it out even longer, huge rip
---
Just a question, is the mentioned update to Legion giving the survivors the ability to mori them?
---
*too literally
---
As the main Pig lover in this community, I approve of this message.
---
When I play SWF, we get mixed rank killer. My friends have been playing longer and sometimes we end up with killers closer to their ranks, and other times closer to mine (so about rank 8-ish to 15)...
---
ah yes, the atrocity that is the legion.
---
remove noed for sloppy. they wont heal with timer on. It is amazing
---
It's not update-based, they can change the matchmaking system used in realtime on their side.
---
Don’t know what game your playing, but in my games it’s either a green mori, yellow mori, or shroud. Sometimes the green randomly becomes an ebony whenever players dc right before they know they’ll get morid
---
No way dude. We are at the first 10%
---
I agree
---
I thank you for this. From thus day forward GlenOck is the official Pig guy.

How will he be able to facecamp 3 people at the same time now ? Sad Bubba ...

**I can’t teabag the shit out of you without getting closer.**
---
Midnight, UTC time, in 2 hours, 56 minutes from now.
---
It was in a stream
---
Lmao that's awesome
---
I never get why people do those hatch stand offs, after 1 minutes I get bored and just give it away. I just don’t get why you waste your time over 1 hook.
---
1. How am I being selfish? I'm consistently a rank 1 Killer, and mid-ranks Survivor. I'm advocating for the rank system so NEW PLAYERS aren't pushed away by the learning curve. YOU arecbeing selfish because you want new players to suffer just so YOU get shorter queue times.
---
2. Many streamers, such as Tyde and Tru3, acknowledge the importance of the ranking system for its ability to separate new players from experienced ones. Those callimg the system pointless are NOT calling for the removal of ranks, but for the addition of rewards for hitting r1.
---
3. There's still an average of 16k concurrent players on PC, so you're wrong in saying that "Everyone has damn near quit the game". Those that have recently left, mostly did so due to constant DC's, which the new Survivor pips should fix.
---
4. Check out the latest Dev Update, they are going to be fixing many core issues in the next patch.
---
Happening in random games for me too, hard to figure out what might be causing it. A perk maybe? Who knows
---
If you end up in a broken lobby he also says “are we gonna be here ALL day?” After a few long minutes of waiting. Its honestly the best

My joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took me a total of 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. 🤬 What's that? My joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. I outsmarted you, nitwit.🤭
---
In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as "R/Wooooosh" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile. The Germans refer to this action as "Schadenfreude," which means "harm-joy" 😬😲. WOW! 🤪 Another reference I had to explain to you. 🤦‍♂️🤭 I am going to cease this conversation for I do not converse with simple minded persons.😏😂
---
Oh shit really? That one I haven't heard! I'll have to listen out for that one :)
---
I love Freddy and the Legion.   
---
Freddy makes me feel mind-gamy , and using remember me / noed / blood warden gives you those moments of pure raw power that turns the tide of a game and makes you feel amazing. Plus, while he is by far one of the weakest killers, he is still Freddy. It always makes me feel great doing good as Freddy, I feel like I achieved something.  
---
Legion is fast and slashy. When people don't insta-dc, i try to play a more "enduring" play style. I try to run up, get everyone hit, and walk after them. I NEVER moonwalk, I refuse to play toxic, yet still get insulted and DC. It kind of makes me feel warm inside when people say gg after a legion match. Like,  i'm \*not\* the type you hate, It makes me feel a bit better... I like them a lot, lol.
---
More like you find out the killer is standing in place and swinging their weapon. Idk about how it is in pc rn but I’d say out of 20 matches I played this tonight 8-9 were killers doing that. I never seen it that bad before.
---

---
Sounds nice, I just got freddy and I can't really play him very well yet. But I'll learn.
---
Didn’t Roony Mara like REFUSE to let them use her character model? (Not that any one *wanted* ***YOU*** as Nancy, Roony! 😡😤)
---
To hell with Quinten. GIVE US HEATHER LANGENCAMP AS NANCY AND ROBERT ENGLUND AS FREDDY!!!
---
Yeah, you're right 😅
---
The devs once mentioned in a dev stream that they want to block the exit gates when a survivor is on a hook after all gens are done so they have to save or either hide and risk dying too.
---
That‘s also not how it works.
---
They probably tried to get the originals but the license was too expensive or not available at all (cause some refuse to be in videogames)
---
Or just do it yourself, it’s really not that hard to just spam f.
---
Wow. A Face camping Pig against a 3 man and with no generators completed.....
---
*“No harsher penalties for toxic gameplay needed!”*

It was on a stream, he speaks about some dev stuff if he's allowed to, you should follow him on Twitch. Only streams weekends if I'm not mistaken.

---
You can't see addons when actively using power in some scenarios, which is why I ask.
---
To answer your question: they'll stop DCing when Legion isn't the absolute most boring, mundane thing in existence to go against.
---
 I’m not using the power in the screenshot.. literally just stood still and took a screenshot, but anyway, I don’t use add ons. And if I do I only run the brown/yellow ones - not something like Franks mixtape because I know that’s zzzz to go against.
---
🤷🏻‍♀️ I feel the same way about facing Plagues but I don’t DC against them every time they make eye contact with me.

I don’t blame the actor, I blame the director, costuming, effects makeup artists, producers and writers. They made a horrible remake. And I agree he couldn’t do much with the hand he was dealt. And that was also the problem with the remake. I hated Nancy in it. She was horrible. That’s a case where I also blame the actress, because I’m sorry but she was just terrible. 
---
What’s sad is original Nancy was much like Laurie Strode. A classic survivor girl who despite the horror, become a strong warrior. The girl even died trying to save others, help destroy Freddy and teaching them how to fight back against him.  So if anyone should have been brought in, it was original Nancy/Heather Langencamp.
---
Probably a hacker on the survivor side
---
Yeah, good thing DCing doesn’t derank you anymore. You can put the tinfoil away.
---
It’s the best I could do on a mobile
---
Well, then you are just misinformed. It's not hitboxes, they are fine. It's the latency between Survivors and the Killer due to the fact that the Killer's computer is the host for the lobby.
---
I feel like adding Blood Warden as an actual feature would ruin the game. If the killer ran NOED it would be an instant 4K.
---
Omg I just pictured a Freddy running at me full-frenzy with his claw held up in the air, while he yell smth like "I'M GONNA HARD TICKLE YA, GURL". That's some "nightmare" fuel.
---
Gladly
---
The horrific grammar completely kills the meme.
---
I know this might sound strange asf, but when i play hunter i realized that ppl be popping generators like crazy fast. When i play surviver, this is hardly the case though. For that reason, i always needed a viable way to have a target in sight to keep the tempo of the game in check. Initially when i tried playing hunter, i just left the hooked surviver and went from generator to generator hoping to find someone. Eventually I'd end up like half way across the map from the hooked surviver, and i couldn't even get back in time to find scratch marks. If ppl pair up or work in 3s, these generators get popped asap too, so I'd just get wrecked. Some ppl intentionally bait and want you to chase them while others do all the generators, but if i can't catch them in a controlled period of time, i just go after another person as soon as i come across them
---
As much as I'm afraid that Freddy is gotta get dunked on with this rework, either by being even worse than he is now or so next-level overpowered that he's gonna get reverted again - I still welcome changes to him. Bad changes are better than dull stalemates.

You'll get downvoted like mad — but every P3 Krueger that didn't cheat to get there will agree. He's been memed to death by scrubs and those that roll with the general consensus. 
---
Hilarious how nobody uses Leddit's voting """feature""" as intended.
---
Doesn't matter what you think - Devs only care about player base. Maybe they aren't DC'ing on purpose? Half the matches someone one hangs and we get a 3 person round.  So much a lag and killers dropping out too. Hell, I got stuck on a tree today in a match. 
---
Can't have penalties when the game already penalizes us.
---
First 2 killers in the game? Yes I think so.
---
Goddamit, all that Freddy needs is 3 QoL fixes:
---
1) No progression for Survivors during sleep transition  
---
2) Self-care failed skillchecks don't wake Survivors up   
---
3) Some numbers change on standart sleep transition time and add-ons (maybe overall reduce the transition by 2 seconds, make the add-ons give a bit less of a reduction so that it balances out to roughly the same).
---
=Sorry if noob question but what is the heart surrounded by all the ritual stuff?
---
me when i bought the yandere cosmetic for Spirit 😔
---
Me and my buds were playing kill your friends in free weekend to try the game and i would tell them to drop pallets when they see them so they can be ready when they are in a chase.
---
No, it's you since you obviously didn't read what I said. That's why I didn't mention regular windows, I mentioned drop windows since with those you can't move forward at all, so if you get hit once falling, it means that killer weapons still reach once a survivor is all the way through a window. Again, it has nothing to do with lag as a drop keeps you in the same place for a second, plenty of time for the lag to catch up to your location, and yet I still get hit through drop and regular windows. Even in green ping lobbies.
---
I feel like saying killers dont have a choice is really dumb kill the farming trash but i always get pissed at fellow surviors who frame me before getting slightly annoyed at the killer who killed me right off the hook  cuz i have no choice in getting ripped off
---
"are you okay???? XDDDDD"
---
Off yourself.
---
Am I the only Freddy main who is completely happy and would honestly prefer him the way he is now?
---
PC
---
- Sounds are all over the place. Terror radius heartbeat and music get lower as killer moves away then spikes up real high for a second. 
---
- Did footsteps get real quiet now?
---
- Still getting stuck on a tree when trying to urban invasion around the edge of the swamp map. 
---
- Evil dead dlc looks nothing like Bruce Campbell. Putty faced grandpa. Do you not want my money? Did you get rights for the looks? or just the character? Fire your artist.
---
Compared to early dbd? Doesn't take much
---
This is the impression I was getting too.
---
4th survivor is replaced as a legion which can also step in trapper's traps. Go figure.
---
Yeah, I guess. Although bbq is dlc but wglf(I think it's that one) is free on David m
---
 And I still haven’t gotten it once! :(
---
Thank god. I can still enjoy my fedora boy for a little longer :)
---
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Please dont revert the matchmaking. The people complaining were assholes who live in australia and eastern europe. Now we are going to go back to having to join 10 rooms to find ping that is even playable.

Lets not forget

https://clips.twitch.tv/PlausibleTriangularNigiriFailFish
---
Unless you fast vault at a reasonable distance. Y'know, like you're meant to.
---
Reported for Exploit kid :) everyone knows fake phasing, swinging to gain distance, and using ambush to counter unsafe pallets are exploits. 
---
All things I’ve heard are apparently exploits. No one ever bothers to explain why though.
---
You realize they can grab you off the save animation, could have unrelenting, and could get BOTH the saver and already hooked Survivor still, right? Face camping in general is an unfair dick move, no matter who the killer is. I mean the Devs literally had to change hooks to be multi directional because killers used to literally be able to body block other survivors from saving the one on the hook. It’s how Face camping in general started.
---
I know, shitty hitboxes means it's killer sided. Not defending killers here.
---
Basically fucking over another survivor - pulling them off the hook like 2 seconds after they're hooked so they just get downed again, throwing a pallet down in front of them while they're being chased, etc
---
I can't see them putting that much work into it.
---
Who knows. The devs act in mysterious ways. Such as making it IMPOSSIBLE to counter Cannibal camping. They really got it.
---
Survivors can still run at the killer at the start of the match and killers can afk. And wdym tinfoil?
---
pp hard
---
It's not because it's 'trendy'. It's because playing against legion completely negates everything you're actually able to do as a survivor, making it unfun. Here are all the ways you get away from a killer:
---
Run away - Legion is faster than you and will always outrun you.
---
Vault windows to gain distance - Legion can vault windows.
---
Throw down pallet - Legion can vault pallets.
---
Hide - Legion can see where you are if he hits someone, no matter what perks you have.
---
Have someone take a hit - This literally just helps Legion.
---
On top of that, getting hit is supposed to give you a chance to get some distance and hide or get to a pallet/window, but against Legion, not only can he still catch up to you, but you are literally forced to stand still and mend. If he finds you while you are mending, you go down. And since he can catch you so easily, you spend more time mending than anything else.
---
They could've given legion just one of his abilities (Speed, hitting multiple people, seeing auras after hitting someone, vaulting), But they gave him ALL of them. It's boring to play against. Imagine a fighting game where one character was immune to all projectiles. An entire strategy and half of your moveset is negated. This is how survivors feel when they bring perks that help them, like faster healing or speed boosts or avoiding a hit, only for Legion to straight up ignore them all.  For most people, they know exactly how this game is going to play out, so they'd rather just move on to the next one where some strategy is actually involved.
---
I tend to go for both
---
Burger King Myers / Man Girdle Myers
---
My man wraith finally got some fresh J’s
---
why would yu use spine chill is every stealthy killers could ignore it ?
---
I won't miss those games at all. They often spark a chain of DCs which either ends with all four going out or me stuck with a single survivor who doesn't understand that hitting gens or hooks means we can farm.
---
They can't but it depends how they play.
---
If survivors are obviously up for farming then removing them quickly with a Mori is a dick move imho.
---
As long as you kill the ass farming me im good do w.e ive seen killers let them get hatch its so annoying
---
that would be Adrenaline right there
---
You sweet summer child.
---
Enjoy him, you are in the prime time to do so.
---
I've had survivors show up healing themselves all the way across the map with BBQ and still been able to get to them in time for Nurses Calling to proc.
---
Run Sloppy Butcher and it's even better.
---
Most survivors run it but I think it's a pretty balanced perk.
---
I appreciate all the responses guys! Last question though: which killer should I level up first? My friends say leather face cause of bbq and chili
---
On the bright side, that means DBD has like 15 more years left in that case. But is it worth it without a new Freddy?
---
How did this happen? I kinda wanna try it
---
Only Mike ignores it, it's a special part of his power. It's really good against other stealth killers.
---
also doesn't. Myers T1 is immune to detection perks, it's a special part of his power.
---
"INFINITE LOADING SCREEN 
---
This bug prevents players from loading into a game. This occurs when one of the players in the match experiences a game hang. The player’s only choice is to force close the game.  
---
The Infinite Loading Screen is a complex case that requires a lot of investigation from our engineers. We already identified part of the issue and pushed some fixes to the live game; however, some cases remain. To better identify the cause behind the remaining cases, we will add more debug information in the mid-chapter update. Although we don’t have an ETA yet, fixing the infinite loading bug is a top priority for us. "
---
Here's a little sneak peak of BHVR's finest engineers: https://media.giphy.com/media/5Zesu5VPNGJlm/200.gif
---
It’s annoying though, and no real reason for it
---
Yes. I've been told it's bots farming BP but I play on PS4 so I'm not sure how easy that would be to set up.
---
Nope, you are playing killer as intended. What you are doing is called "soft patrolling" Hook, check a gen, return, and repeat. This strategy punishes altruistic survivors that hesitate to save from hooks waiting for the perfect moment when you are long gone which will never happen. Survivors seem to think they can dictate your play style so it favors them and is "fair" by their standards. Point is if you catch someone and as long as you aren't standing 6 feet away from the hooked survivor and waiting for them to die you are not camping. No matter what that survive with friends group says not all survivors are supposed to get out, and if you kill their friends you are just playing the game as intended.
---
Because pig isn't meant to be in the game, she joined by a KWF bug. So the game code doesn't know wtf to do with 2 killers.
---
Well, she is back being a normal peasant again.
---
Tunneling is mostly an etiquette thing, it almost becomes necessary to a degree at high ranks. What differentiates bad from effective tunneling is knowing when to give up on chasing a survivor and apply pressure elsewhere.
---
Actually does work on The Pig. Myers is the only Killer having such power.
---
It's another bug in the game
---
Thus you couldn't be even more blind not to see Myers covered in blood and stalking you.
---
yea that's why the perk is used by a lot of players. Would be useless if it wouldn't work on wraith and pig
---
Sorry, I meant pig's stealth also doesn't fool spine-chill. should have worded it better.
---
When you say wait for the grab, I'm saying you're able to bait out a hit for the killer and then unhook them while they're wiping the blood. If he goes after the recently unhooked, there are many perks to counter getting farmed such as Desisive Strike and Borrowed time, I've done it against good facecampers, it does work a lot of the time. My main point is still that your joke would of made a lot more sense putting Leatherface there because his build is perfect for facecamping while legion is probably the worst to do it alongside freddy as his power is useless in that scenario.
---
Also, Unrelenting only lowers when the killer misses an attack and hasn't had any affect in the blood wiping time in a very long time. Are you talking about Save the Best for Last?
---
You can see the jigsaw boxes later in the game.
---
Why would the number of killers affect the traps? That sounds like a specific thing to be coded into the game, rather than something that happens accidentally.
---
I get that from the first sentence either way.
---
It's also weird, because in chat my name is yellow (which is the killer) but the other guy is listed in the score list.
---
This is some quality content.  Good jerb.
---
ps4
---
* chase music is obnoxiously loud for the survivor
---
* loading into the match as a giant leg is still happening
---
* loading into the match and having everyone affected by the giant leg bug
---
* invisible skill checks. (the notification sound dings but the skill check never shows up)
---
* Invisible hex totems are a thing and is RNG
---
* infinite loading screens
---
* dead queues
---
* 3 hour wait times to play a match if you have a full 4 man SWF team
---
Those are the most frustrating and annoyingly game breaking bugs that I've been forced to experience so far ever since the plague was released. Her and her perks have been a literal plague to this game.
---
You have some competition buddy
---
he got 4 iridescents. that’s a double pip at any rank.
---
Dead look on her eyes. Its terrifying
---
I will crush the cometition
---
And Nurse seems to be a fair killer? No matter the offering she is still op af and is also DC worthy,but appsrently you only cry about moris. Thank god you didnt play back in 2016 where you could mori someone directly after you downed him.
---
You're doing your best, good meme
---
i love flashlights. it’s basically like i just got 4-5 instaheals, i can flashlight save people and possibly save multiple lives. i hate getting toolboxes usually.
---
LeatherfaceI know that you can bait a killer, but people are potato’s and still don’t do it right. And smart killers won’t be baited. Those perks aren’t always at play either. Especially when playing solo. And they still don’t deter killers from Tunneling. A tunneling killer isn’t going to change because it’s all they know how to do and the only way players like that get kills. And in MY experience it doesn’t work. That is my games and PS4. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Also I’m not joking about face camping Legions. I get facecamped by the stupidest killers all the time. Legion, Nurse and Hag being the biggest ones. 
---
The normal ones are obviously Billy, LeatherFace,  and Michael. 
---
My mistake on unrelenting.
---
Are you kidding? It's what makes this meme.
---
What was his response?
---
and doesn’t that stop gens being done quickly?
---
Thank you
---
He's not the weakest :l
---
Just today, a survivor reported me for hacking because I have no hands according to them.
---
no, it doesn't make any more sense if I explain it any other way.
---
Oh god yes I've been so nad about the game being broken and theyre FINALLY starting Rehab
---
There’s a special place in hell for people like you 😂
---
the audio gave me cancer
---
I would also add in like 1-3k BP free when this happens as a sorry.  
---
Not enough to be game breaking, but enough that it didn't waste too much of your time.
---
Hotel&gt;Trivago
---
Level up who ever you find fun or intresting. Dont worry to much about strats/perks have fun. I started with nurse because i liked teleporting around and i knew nurses was fun.
---
Also if you sont get why people dislike tunneling play a bit of survivor and if you have a bad day of a bunch of tunneling youll get it. But theres nothing "wrong" with it, it just makes the game unfun and very un worth it for one person.
---
The problem i have with legion is the deep wound timer stops when healing and doesn't deplete when chasing them so there litterally is no point when they are in danger of getting downed by it and mending barely takes any time to do.So basically deep wound is pretty much useless as a time waster.
---
Wait.  DBD gonna get dedicated servers ???
---
Is that real. And when ?
---
It's a bug.
---
Yeah. Sure.
---
I think I had this exact same person in my game while I was plague. They kept selling out the last survivor
---
Um, what? How can hitboxes be sided? When a hitbox or hurtbox is so large it makes it easy for one side to hurt the other. In this case, it makes it easy for killers to hit survivors. That's how, don't know what you're on about
---
Oh shit that's me haha.  Well the David getting merc'ed.  Great shot again.
---
Cultured comment but underrated 
---
#Darn
---
Well, I did haha
---
Then the killer has Frank mixtape and increased mending time add-ons and bloodhound to follow blood trails.
---
You and what Reverse Bear Trap?
---
Question - I get the perks, but what makes this build better for legion specifically?
---
I like them STALKY
---
actually self caring makes your hit box even bigger
---
I thought you meant sided as in either survivor client sided, or killer client sided, which sounded crazy to me. Glad to know I was wrong.
---
I suppose it's to bully the players that used the offering to deliberately make the offering worthless for them. 
---
It could also be that the killer is trying to maximise their personal bloodpoint gain. Camping &amp; tunneling are the easiest way for a killer to get points in the sacrifice category. Though they do lose out on brutality &amp; deviousness bp.
---
More likely it's just bad luck. Some killers just try harder to win the game when a bps is put into the lobby to try &amp; amplify bp gains. This sadly translates to playing more scummy to win the game.
---
Had 4 or 5 games in a row like that yesterday. Two face camping pigs (literally right by the hook) and then other killers that "proxy camped". They also never left the vicinity of the hook and just mulled around it doing nothing. I asked the killer what was fun about face camping and they legit responded "run borrowed time if it bothers you". I can't deal with this game sometimes lol
---
You can only see the offerings used by the survivors and the one used by the killer. You can't see which survivors used which offering.
---
Ah thanks for the correction, another dense moment. You can usually tell which one has the streamers though, seeing as how they’re suddenly always the hero of the group. Or they have WGLF
---
This is normal, they devs dont care, because balance or fighting toxicity dosnt get you money !
---
The best thing is, that if they constantly do this you block them, you then have to load into games and check if your vs them again, if you are you d/c.
---
They'll never be banned so you just have to minimize the time wasted.
---
Killers can check in the lobby and dodge anyone they feel like, And if there are 1-2 survivors with 300ms ping that arn't dodging for whatever reason it's a win-win for the killer, and lose-lose for the other two survivors.
---
Look healing without a med kit (self or with another person) is about equivilent to half a gen. If instead of healing you use resilience you will get gens done much much quicker. Obviously this put you at risk but it also might save you and your teamates
---
A point I specifically addressed.
---
And communicating trap locations isn't actually that easy. At the very least, they will be spending considerable amounts of time looking for them, and then, again, there are those complementary add-ons I've mentioned.
---
Besides, if we were to take into account SWF with voice communications, a variety of things would instantly seem ill-adviced. Do you never set traps around a hooked survivor, or instance?
---
Even if it did happen to you, there was a joke in that first post, has a punchline and everything that is bolded and put a paragraph after to show that it is meant to be the punchline and the main part of the joke...
---
You didn't say "A few games ago I had a very long wait time and then it was a facecamping leigon", if you did then fair enough, you put it in a format to be a joke. You intended it to be a joke so don't talk like that just to make me seem stupid.
---
Haha relatable :D
---
Honestly I WOULD like rewards but with matchmaking at its current state it’d be broken.
---
I'm with you. I love playing against Legion and play with. The chases are much more fun and exciting.
---
I like Michael standing awkwardly in the background
---
I don't know why but lately I've had to dc a Lot through the loading screen. Even if the ping was green before, it'll get stuck &amp; not load at all. If I do wait , it just says host was disconnected &amp; depip anyway. This happened way too many times tonight.
---
Resilience does not affect window vaulting speeds any longer (despite still mentioning so). For that reason, it is not worth a perk slot.
---
9% faster action speed translates to ~6.6 seconds on a generator repair, 1.15s on a totem cleanse, and 1.65s on opening exit gates. That's about as miniscule as it gets.
---
A screenshot of the glitch existing is very different from a step by step guide to accomplishing such a feat
---
You’re playing legion.
---
However many people go with the “don’t want to support the pedo who profits from keepers creepers”... 
---
But honesty, I am a fan of the character and it would be cool.
---
I have and I've played most of my survivor games with friends so I know that the killer didn't DC.
---
I have always been a fan of the character. I don't know a thing about the writers or anything like that so this is solely based off of me enjoying the movie and the character it's self.
---
Maybe a dumb question but what does End Game mean? Is it the same as a second objective?
---
I've decided on the Dwight's Leader perk and what I like to do is wait next to the person opening the gates so it's way faster
---
Well yeah then i guess they'd need to make sure nothing or atleast very little on their end is causing people to dc before they implement this.
---
Does the pallet make a sound when dropped if their isn't a survivor there to hear it?
---
"Not an argument."
---
There wasn’t a joke in mine. Excuse me for not saying “THIS IS A JOKE” at the beginning. Didn’t know I had to have a disclaimer to not be taken literally. Pretty sure I know if I made a joke or not. I didn’t. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
---
And if you MUST insist that there is a joke, the joke is:
---
Most of the time I wait 20 years for a game and literally get the stupidest killer to face camp me when I finally find one. That’s the punchline. The idiot using the worst character to be a dick. Legion is already a massively hated character. And so a lot of people play Legion in an ironically jerk style. 
---
I also never said I was trying to make you feel stupid or intended to. That’s you being defensive.
---
Yeah.
---
I want the creeper regardless of who gets paid.  He’s an iconic horror character.
---
There's is a counter, I found out. 
---
When doing the glitch that gives you 2 killers, Legion is unable to use his power! It's such a great counter!
---
oof
---
Agreed
---
not legion
---
if the killer is rank 15 then just don’t die lol
---
Exactly the same thing for me!
---
1) People will just dc more to avoid losing pips. It’ll also bring out awesome omegablink Nurses, instasaw Billy, 4-man swf with instaheals and other broken bs in this game since everyone will tryhard to rank up. 
---
2) I don’t think game could detect if dc was intentional or not. Possibly punishing players for their game crashing is shit.
---
I still save him for bloodpoints tho (ik i can be hooked)
---
I thought you could only do that in kyf but it happened in a random game. I hope BHVR will take care of this bug...
---
Ooohhhh burn. Now you’re insulting me and belittling me. I knew what I was talking about the whole time. You didn’t. Hence your anger. 
---
Except for with Unrelenting. (A perk I don’t ever use so I didn’t realize it was changed, or just simply misunderstood how it worked)
---
I just now realized that p3 means prestige and not playstation.
---
Your post indicates that it happened to you and that you came her to ask about it.
---
Dear god no.
---
So much for not reading it and the fact that you completely ignored all the points I made in that entire thing I written before is what I'm talking about, so then you can just stay in your happy little bubble where you're right and everything else is wrong. When shit gets too tough just run away and say I'm a troll.
---
[another thing before you leave](http://www.haveacocktail.com/images/da/8691.jpg)
---
I still want to know how to do this.. for educational purposes of course
---
I like the idea of it, but with the implementation of this it could mess up balancing. Currently the game is balanced to one objective. More time added to side objectives may just put things in the killers favor. But hopefully they realize this and re-adjust certain perks/core mechanics accordingly.
---
Either way I'm hyped to hear about what's to come
---
No
---
It would be cool as a seperated gamemode, but probably won't happen because of the additional coding required for every single perk.
---
Planks sounds nice lol
---
Then buy Leatherface and quit complaining.
---
When will we get 2x Bloodpoints again?
---
He never said he himself was implicated. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Just look at reddit for the last week. Hundreds of people are experiencing what he said.
---
Oh yes I’ll buy a Killer I hate and will never play with my broke ass  for one single perk on a video game instead of paying oh idk....MY RENT? 
---
Why even make the comment?

---
the game isn't held hostage just because you don't like being a bleeding little slug on the ground. the killer completed his objective. his only objective is to kill survivors. if no one can get up guess what happened? everyone died. the match ends. game over. quit trying to make rules up just because you don't like something. get mad, be mad. i don't care. slugging isn't against the actual rules of the game. 
---
the fact your tiny little brain can't comprehend that is amusing to me to be honest. holding the game hostage would be to trap X amount of survivors in the basement by body blocking the stairs and then going AFK. holding the game hostage is body blocking someone into a corner or a small room and then going AFK. the game can't and doesn't progress because neither the killer is going to complete his objective and the survivor can't do theirs or leave the match until they are hit or the killer walks away. **THAT** is holding the game hostage.
---
Most of us blame BOTH of you. You could always not be a jerk, but fine I get it...take your free kill so we can get the hill out of the game and away from the asshole who farmed us. The main issue is when the killer doesn’t even try punishing the farmer for being an asshole, they just insta region because that’s fair.
---
Unpopular opinion. Oh yeah. Downvote me. You know you want to.
---
Intentionally throwing the game so that the opposite team wins.
---
I am super intrigued by the reworks but also End Game Collapse. It jush sounds so dramatic I love it.
---
How about killer d/c everytime you bring an instaheal, dead hard, mettle of man, and decisive that let you completely skip and avoid hits which completely fuck over the killer and drag the chase out extensively while he gets gen rushed?
---
Or when you body block hooks and flashlight him to deny him hooks?
---
Or when you loop him around pallettes and purple flashlight him anytime he tries to break a pallette?
---
Should he d/c then too because you're making it very difficult for him to win against a good coordinated group who's all gen rushing while this stuff is going on?
---
That's the ENTIRE point of a Mori. Survivors have so many tools to WASTE a killers time and drag out chases while gen rushing him. Getting 12 hooks before 5 gens pop can be ridiculous at times with all of that. 
---
Mori's put the PRESSURE back on the Survivor and cuts out their ability to rely on dragging out 12 chases to get shit done. They now have 8 chases only.
---
That's what a Mori does, give each survivor one less chase chance against the killer. That's 4 less chases he has to do.
---
Long story short, stop being a crybaby over it and 'git gud'.
---
And then they act like there's nothing wrong when they disconnect from a game because someone is using a killer that they paid for. 
---
The game itself is fine. It's the community that has resulted in me not playing anymore. Spending $8 on anew killer only to never be able to use him because survivors  quit every time is where I drew the line. If they can't abuse the killer, they leave. 
---
And the fact that this post WILL get downvoted is only going to prove my point about how horrible the community is. Sad seeing so many people depending quitting out of games. These same people are the first ones to make threads here whining about killers leaving a match when they see a bunch of flashlights in the lobby or p3 Claudettes.
---
definitely not in EU zone D: every time i try to goof around there, killers just kill as if Entity literally forces them.
---
but this one time i joined shittiest ping(400 but it was stable af), it was a Korean Trapper and we goofed a bit and then even added each other on Steam but our lobbies together are impossible to play in :c bhvr give, bhvr take, amirite?
---
I was a Huntress main until they messed her hatches and hitboxes with them up. By the time they fixed it I had already moved on. Combine that with her slow Movement speed and the disadvantage you have with her Lullaby, and it wasn’t worth it anymore. She’s also glitchy on PS4 sometimes. I see my Hatchets go throw people all the time. I miss playing her though, but she just isn’t always viable anymore.
---
That sounds pretty awful.
---
I said it in another thread they need to implement the same penalties games like WoW have for quitting a match. If you quit you get a 30 minute timer where you can’t que for another game. Quit again it goes to an hour and quit a third time you’re done playing for the day.
---
Where you get a weird wiggle bar when you're not being carried? This happened to me on PS4.
---
I hooked a survivor, went across the map to look at gens, survivor gets unhooked, then I find them on my side of the map, hit him once, dc, messaged I was getting reported for tunneling.
---
It’s also part of what’s killing and ruining the game. People are quitting left and right because of it. And innocent killers take the heat for it too sadly.
---
but the sub doesn't agree lol. as if they don't understand that noed can be cleansed even before activated(plus the bp you get for cleansing) while you can't prevent Adrenaline to pop. i mean surely you can kill before last gen but then you're a tryhard or camper or tunneler.
---
That’s a Leatherface for ya!
---
It rewards you for unhooks and body blocking. I can't remember the last time I played a survivor game and didn't max out on stacks.
---
Look at it this way, now you get to learn how to be an expert at fixing gens.
---
idk. i wish it wasn't a thing though. you get people like me with killers that have every perk in the game maxed out and no perks left to buy in the bloodweb paired up with people who don't deserve to go against me. they're just not on the level i'm on skill wise. makes for some very boring and unfun games for everyone involved.
---
booping the pig her snoot
---
Freddie is fine. Completely. Don't let a a meme form your truth through violent repetition. He's only weak when gates are powered and it's exactly why his perks counter that game state. So annoying, Freddie's smashes so easily just don't tunnel.
---
oooohhhh llooorrrdd he's comming
---
That is helpful.
---
Jason is the only one i want. Probably never gonna happen but im still hoping...
---
If they dont load in it knocks it down a Gen. If they load in and then quit, it will stay as 5 gens.
---
No that’s before everyone loads in. If only 3 survivors load in, 4 gens will be required

---
It is a double standard but there really isn't much else they can do about it. Swf groups with that wide of a rank gap are definitely less common, so it makes sense they would match favoring the survivors.
---
Lets see how many Legions main will come here pretending they are survivors wich like play against Legion.
---
Which is stupid, 3 people 5 gens on maps like Game with killers like Annoying doctor is impossible, unless survivors are really good.
---
In cases like that, if I'm the killer, I'd let them farm and escape cause it's not fun to be in matches like that. If a person ruins the game for 4 people (3 s, 1 killer) then might as well have BP farm to make the most out of it instead of being one sided game.
---
After these, I will can finally place Freddy and Legion in a more acurates places in my tier list.
---
r/THE_PACK
---
Yep, you're right: extra sparks make the difference
---
*Myers
---
Even though they don't. They used to only care about suvivuors. What's a suvuvior issue that needs to be fixed currently?
---
But I just equipped the Herman Carter one and I don't see any difference in the amount of sparks. Maybe I'm blind but thanks for the quick response.
---
It was the first time it happened for me I guess, hadn't noticed before and thought it was part of the latest patch. Thanks for letting a fairly new player know.    
---
Too bad BHVR couldn't implement such a feature so that íf a survivor disconnected while still alive after the start of a round one random generator on the map was instantly autocompleted.
---
Thank you, finally someone who’s not an idiot
---
You seem like a dumbass who’s would slug because he can’t actually play the game the intended way
---
LOL true I respect good huntresses so much
---
God this sticks of ochido
---
Dont you fucking dare dis Clem like that
---
Too bad BHVR couldn't implement such a feature so that íf a survivor disconnected while still alive after the start of a round one random generator on the map was instantly autocompleted.  
---
It would also even out games with less than 4 survivors since currently, such games are far too easy for the killers, who then either have a field day or leave the remaining survivors to farm. If a generator got auto-finished if someone disconnected the balance of the game could still be maintained even if there were less than 4 survivors.
---
I thunk I have only had fun in a legion match once and it was because the legion would deep wounds every person in there terror radius before sticking to the last person they hit so it was just a match of stick by your team mates and try to get hit first. Most of the time it's either infinite mending legion, Frank's mix tape with cold dirt legion, no cool down legion, or just that legion that chases the one person all match until they hit them 3 or 4 times depending on if they have Frank's since most do. Throw in a mori with each of those and you have 95% of my legion matches. I totally agree that it is super fun to play against a killer that completely ignores most game mechanics
---
I still think a neat method they could use  would be to have his Dream world be a constant, like a reverse madness, Survivors not performing actions or sprinting will begin to get Tired, if the tired bar reaches full they will fall asleep of their own accord. The make a power that augments that. 
---
Freddy biggest issue is he is not reactionary, unlike every other killer in the game, if a survivor is infront of him, he physically cant do anything to them. They need to get rid of that in some form. Let him leap out of the dream if a survivor is pulled into it, maybe even have it be that the Dream world is different from the normal world. With less generators present (4 instead of 7,Can be effected by addons) and gen progress will not carry across,so survivors have to search for a 'dream gen' since they cant just pick one of the 7 generators and wake up, oh and drop waking up from self care fails.
---
Thank you!
---
Too late to ask for this. Developers started to work at this rework a year ago. They will not reverted now just because some Freddy mains said so.
---
Bleed out eventually? That’s not the point, he’s stopping game progression for survivors and causing only himself to benefit from that whole match. And their is no way out of that match without disconnection and losing 2 pips or waiting  4 minutes for yourself to bleed out. When you could be using that 4 minutes to find a game that the killer MIGHT participate in regular gameplay.
---
Actually, tyde time made a video explaining the recent update. It makes it so whenever three people spawn in, everyone goes to the end screen
---
No worries dude. If I'm killer in that situation I will make it an easier game, get my chilli stacks and let them leave. Some killers do this or farm and some try hard and try kill still. It is what it is unfortunately. Just dont let it put you off playing. I do like your idea too, would make the game somewhat winnable for the remaining survivors.
---
Don't be that guy...
---
This has pissed me off from the moment Myers was released lmfao
---
It's probably because of the rank reset. I got it all the time when I was lower rank, then didn't see it forever, then when I deranged again I saw it all the time. The bots are all rank 15 usually so you have to be low enough rank to get those kinda killers.
---
Person was getting camped by a crouching pig I saw the pig and was pointing at them little did I know there was a Dwight on the other side of the pig and sold them out the hooked guy saw and reported me for working with the killer
---
This guy right here, Got looped for 5 gens by some ochido fan boys in there last match. i can smell it in there sweat
---
Hit registration previously has never been as bad as it currently is. Whether it be hitboxes or latency something needs to be done to address it. The amount of times I’ve been hit or swung through pallets and gotten hits I shouldn’t have is too many to count.
---
This subreddit has seen better days
---
I feel that one won't happen because he already has his own game.
---
Dedicated servers will fix it.
---
But NOED is fine!1!1!!
---
Im just going to say this, i dont like playing against freddy. he is just annoying, i feel wraith is honestly worst bc i do better against him then i do with freddles
---
"I cant use the key?" lol this was funny
---
Because they’re sad people who find enjoyment in ruining things for others for some reason. Like a kid who breaks a toy if someone else wants to play with it.
---
Aye, since he came out. It's what properly got me into the game (I bought the game before release just at the end of the beta phase) and didn't really get into it.
---
Freddy and Quentin are my P3 duo.
---
Stop right there survivor scum.
---
BEcause they mentioned how much of a Freddy rework is being made while briefly mentioning the Legion update, I really hope they just don't make minor changes that make him less annoying but worse of a killer.
---
At this rate, I wouldn't be surprised if they just removed his ability to vault pallets &amp; then called it a day.
---
Hope they add some more functionality to his power or better yet improve his base movement speed so that chasing survivors without his power is possible.
---
Would only really work if it was a fast locker and even still that’s not a guarantee. As a killer, unless I see the survivor run, I usually kick gens first and then search.
---
That'll be me when the shirtless Laurie cosmetic hits the store.
---
I can't believe it's not butter
---
* lag from killer that renders very hard to time properly evasion manouvers
---
* wrong hitboxes for survivors
---
* wrong hits at pallets + windows
---
* no counter vs camping and tunneling
---
* useless wiggling
---
* useless ranking system
---
* no gameplay variety with only 10% viable perks
---
* bad matchmaking
---
Ranking is just pointless atm for everyone. I had a game that lasted 3 minutes at most because I was on a team of 2 lvl 15s, a lvl 14 and an 18 vs a lvl 6 killer with full perks. Not a single generator got done believe it or not lol
---
Don’t forget that they added a debuff to generators just for survivors working together on one because “THEY DID THE GENS TOO FAST!!”
---
So many ways to extend gameplay and they choose the worst ways possible. Such is BHVR logic, they aren’t the brightest Devs. And there’s a lot of stuff they don’t seem to get.
---
They need to accept that certain cases should be reportable and punishable. They literally made a killer capable of Face camping with like a 1% chance of counter-play (LeatherFace), but don’t want to accept the fuck up. It’s the literal reason why I refuse to pay for the character, I’ll just have to never get BBQ. (In the year and half I’ve been playing I’ve never seen it on the shrine even after Daily gameplay)
---
On the bright side, Leatherface is one of the best killers for generating salt. 
---
Something about a P3 Leatherface with a Claudette mask just pisses off survivors lol.
---
That'll also be me when this Kate cosmetic hits the store.
---

You can stun Nurse with pallets too, doesn't mean it's going to give you much distance. Legion doesn't have to break the pallet, and can almost immediately make up any time lost with his sprint. Not to mention, even if you stun him, if you've been hit you're going to HAVE to stand still. You are not allowed to do anything else in the game if he hits you. Plus, any Legion with half decent tracking will never lose you. And every time you lose him for a second, you are punished by having your mend bar go down. Not to mention, he does not have to sprint and hit you to down you. Most legions sprint to get you into mending, then walk at you and slap you to get you downed. On top of that, say you do lose him. Welp, next time he stabs someone you better hope you aren't nearby because you are revealed and it starts all over again. 
---
It's boring, it's repetitive, and most of the time you'd rather die than spend the next 20 minutes getting hit and standing still over and over again.
---
getting those salty reddit posts is one of his accomplishments
---
Yeah exactly. This would probably never work and no killer is stupid enough to search the locker first instead of kicking gens (especially if it's at 99%)
---
that would be easy af to abuse. imagine swf getting rekt with no gens done so they just disconnect at the hook to instantly get a gen done so their buddy can get the hatch
---
Bbq and chilli was in the shrine once or twice I think
---
I had a 120 second one and got the same amount of BP. What the fuck?
---
Sadly this is very niche as most killers would immediately kick a gen before chasing after a survivor. Then again the regression would be negligible if your right next to the gen.
---
Would need to combine posied with Adrenaline for its full effect. With adrenaline that's 5 seconds of 150% movement speed &amp; no scratch marks. No one is going to track you if you enter a building at that speed.
---
Must have been when I wasn’t playing. Definitely hasn’t been any time recently. 💔
---
Holy shit. I actually really like how Kate looks. This just changes it for me.
---
I wish I got that
---
This is the realm of the entity nothing makes sense
---
After a week or so of this man of metal shit all I play is bubba, Billy, plague, and legion if I keep getting a cancer SWF group. It's just so much more annoying to have to hit everyone that extra time. It being released after the DS nerd would be like if NOED got nerfed and they released a skill that made you automatically exposed if a chase lasts longer than 30 seconds regardless if you are hit.
---
Adrenaline + Poised is fucking nasty. That completely changes the tide of a game and could mean the difference between life and death.
---
Which is a straight up lie because I know people who have been banned from Overwatch, warframe, neverwinter, paragon(RIP), and paladins all on ps4. So the blame Sony for some function not working on you game scapegoat doesnt work here.
---
Exactly this
---
She’s one of my favourite killers. Usually very reliable to get kills and fun to play as. Aesthetically she is amazing, along with her map (except the sheer amount of bamboo). 
---
Arguably the best original chapter they have released.
---
Lol thank you
---
probably won't work 99% of the time but itd be very satisfying when it does i imagine
---
I bought the legion when they came out and haven't had much fun playing him since people always leave.I would lol but it's not any fun at all it just feels like wasted cash :/
---
You got finessed
---
I tend to hook the farmed person and also punish the farmer, and from my experience most of "us" is just blaming me.
---
I don’t play a lot of DBD, and usually have watched, but I don’t really think they would need to do a complete overhaul for Freddy. He’s by far an interesting killer. 
---
From my stand point of limited knowledge they should try working more around his Dream mechanic.
---
I suggest everyone starts in the Dream World, and they must wake themselves up. This would give Freddy at decent advantage, in now he doesn’t have to start the match behind. 
---
That and/or potentially add a new mechanic. Fatigue, the more a person gets put to sleep, the more fatigue they become, making it quicker for the next consecutive sleep to take affect, down to a minimum duration. This way Freddy isn’t spending all match trying to put people to sleep, it becomes quicker and much deadlier to be put to sleep.
---
In a literal sense, I suppose...
---
I know! I feel bad for the killers who have terrible wifi, it's just unfun on both sides! Dedicated servers will be great!
---
A lot of survivors aren’t going to spend enough time farming off of the swings to make the killers pip most of the time, and just standing there doing nothing nets you absolutely zero BP. This used to be a massive issue when they game first launched. It used to be Wraith standing still spamming the cloak/uncloak, but I’ve been seeing a lot of Docs lately just afk and swinging.
---
cursed image
---
he censored himself KEKSKS
---
Yeah, I bought the flashy Jake 80's sunglasses and paired it with the black vest and red flannel shirt, then blue pants, it looks great but I think it makes people think I'm planning to be toxic. Even my Claudette is brightly dressed, I just stick to Tapp and Quinten now
---
It’s not really about boring. It’s about annoyance. Unless it’s a total Baby Legion people insta DC because they simple just don’t want to deal with a Legion game. Not all who play Legion are scumbags, but most still have this happen even when they play normal/respectful. People simply just say, “Ew Legion, fuck that!” 
---
Hell I started reading all of my Legion Daily’s because people instant DC the moment they see me. Not even worth it. Not to mention Legion is possibly one of the most annoying, infuriatingly bullshit Killers to play against. Even Baby Legions can pull off 2-3k just with luck.
---
None of this excuses the DC’s though. Is Legion fucking annoying? Yes, usually. Do the games against Legion usually bite all? More often than not in my experience, yes. Is that a reason to screw over an innocent person who is also dealing with the same annoying Killer just because you didn’t get a killer you don’t like or you’re angry about how the game is going so you decide to leave mid game? 
---
**NO**
---
The only excuse is when a killer is holding the game hostage by body blocked (ie: blocking survivors in a corner/basement/etc until they leave, or when the game shits out and kicks a player for no reason. Also yes connection drops, and electricity going out type situations also are excusable because they are accidental.
---
Dcing is a huge problem right now. It’s one of the things killing the game.
---
platform: pc
---
type of bug: perk
---
description: head-on doesn't work at all, even if the killer is right in front of the locker
---
Nice news devs waiting for this update to be honest
---
Getting reported for playing as the pig and outplaying altruistic swf groups.
---
Yea, another thing is you know damn well if they are a level 15 or so they really really don’t care about their rank, so that means those are the ones who disconnect right away if they get caught ruining game for other survivors and killer. In a way rank matters to tell you who actually plays the game right vs who plays to their own convenience
---
Yeah, I hate the whole prospect of his current power and hope it changes altogether, but if not I’ll accept whatever makes him bearable while still playable
---
Ranking up is a combination of skill and time. I barely played and ended the month at rank 5 with the new patch and I'm rank 1 the rest of the time. I only play solo. Your teammates being bad shouldnt stop you.
---
What a nice thing to say.
---
I don't know what you are talking about. Whenever I try to do such goofy thing killers dodge lobbies, and lobby simulator starts. Rarely someone agrees to play with goofy squad, but they choose Legion always. EU region is boring. Everyone thinks that this game is about pwning everyone. Rude
---
truuuuuuuuuuuu AF
---
lmao, i feel you. during the loading screen, i don't watch what kind of offering are made and then in the first minute of the match i see someone getting moried xd
---
wait, so you are saying that a killer shouldn't have the capability to hit a survivor when theyre next to a window? great logic
---
I cant look at Kate the same ever again. I'm switching to either Megan or Nea because of this. Not even memeing for real.
---
He’s talking about the theoretical game mode of 2v8
---
Hate rank resets lol
---
Yeah you know it! (PS4 player so no post game chat 😭)
---
No I mean in terms of Dead By Daylight, there are no bans. I’ve literally reported hackers and lag switchers with tickets and the report function on PS4. But the Devs always respond saying “hey sorry we’ll look at the log but there isn’t much we can do unless they also play on PC. And then they have to get caught on PC doing it.” 
---
I’m not kidding I’ve literally been told by at least 3 Devs that they cannot ban or punish PS4 players at all because Sony doesn’t allow them to. 
---
Games like Overwatch are different and have permission obviously. I just wish DBD did too.
---
Make it an item you can pick-up, and is placed randomly around the map. Use medkit animations, Vigo’s Satchel. Using it takes about a second, grants bloodpoints. 
---
Limited amount per player can be picked up, enough for 3 players.
---
Killers get event hooks, Vigo’s attenuators, hook survivors to allow the entity to corrupt them. 
---
Whatever number of hooks is deemed needed, killer can attain 3/4 the total amount of bloodpoints a survivor would get for collecting their max.
---
Lore wise Vigo has been attempting an experiment, but at the last moment needed to run. You can pick up his things, or destroy what he’s worked on.
---
That's a really cool idea!
---
But it's not easy to think of corrupted perks.
---
Here
---
Oh I thought you weren't going to wear a shirt. Silly me.
---
Now that's scary.
---
LUL you guys still dont have that? ....well to be honest im kinda jealous....id rather dont have it. I dont even know why its there in the first place.  they should just have sliders or smth to rate other players,  1-10 killer  1-10 survivor
---
Dead by daylight players are garbage with garbage reaction time, if you had actual good players here then they'd just stun legion on the pallet completely exhausting his power or juke him due to him not seing tracks while frenzied.
---
Yeah I don’t really know what the best strategy is when you have completely potato teammates. I’m the only one who does gens, the only one who saves, everyone goes down in ten seconds, and people just creep around looking for the inevitable Ruin totem. Maybe I should go full on immersed Claudette too, do two gens and just worry about my own escape. 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Basement Leatherface be like...
---
Because smart survivors don't cleanse.
---
Yeah doesn't stop salty survivors from pm-ing you on psn though lol
---
thank u!!
---
Lmao. Meg family Guy memes.
---
Meg players are the stereotypical bad players.
---
Lol this is like the same conversation I had with a huntress once. She said I played wrong and I asked her how i was playing wrong and should I just let her kill me. If she was good she could’ve easily stopped me from routing and looping her.
---
Like everyone else said, tunneling is mostly an etiquette thing but there is one perk that sort of requires you to tunnel. Dying Light makes it so that if you kill your obsession early in the game, everyone’s actions, either repairing or healing, are slowed down by a percent. 
---
This can be negated with the obsession changes. If someone other than the current obsession uses Decisive Strike, they will become the new obsession and Dying Light deactivated until the new obsession is dead.
---
Seem like you don’t really get my text.
---
You’ll see the difference of difficulty to get 4 iridescent once you reach high-rank. 
---
I’ve seen so many killers in this sub bragging about how good they are at mid or low rank and it’s meh to me. cuz everyone can easily do that.
---
They said with dedicated servers it would actually be easier to track things like this
---
It added an extra layer of fear to the game because it would sometimes prevent me from running. Kind of like in a dream when you can't run fast. This bug made that match much more intense and fun weirdly.
---
yea and that means they will be exposed all game, and if they dont heal, whats the purpose of sloppy butcher
---
That seems bizarre. I wonder what in the code would make that happen. I mean, the trigger of the trap is tied to the person trying to walk out through a gate or the timer expiring...I don't see how that would have any relation to there being extra killers...does extra killers make it set the timer to zero somehow? Or does it make the game think they are running out through a gate. It seems bizarre.
---
Hex Ruin
---
Good Skill checks lower gen repair by 10%, and Great ones lower it by 5%
---
Breaking a Pallet still stuns you
---
Them vaulting 3 times and downing you? Sounds real fun
---
Damn, 2D really let himself go after the last Gorillaz album.
---
As a freddy you literally cannot win against perfect survivors like the depip squad, it's just mathematically impossible. This isn't quake where you can outplay your opponents hard.
---
It was the first day of the tinkerer 2 killer radius bug and I never heard about it. After getting a amazing amount of 4ks a p3 Meg messaged me and said "enjoy the ban lol"  (this was on PS4). I asked her why tho and she said "you shouldn't be abusing bugs" so after a long discussion, I got her to understand that I didn't even know about this bug. We became friends and with the newfound knowledge, I continued to get 4ks.
---
well thats abotu equally dumb
---
Because of the free characters people start with, 99% go for sprint burst or self care, then get attached to Meg and Claudette so there's a tonne more of them than anyone else.
---
My friend plays Meg and they’re pretty bad tbh
---
fucking annoys the shit out of me
---
the fact that some stealth killers actually work as stealth killers while other ones are essentially hot garbage because some killers can completely ignore certain perks while others can't isn't really right
---
i could understand if it was part of myers' right click power to become immune to detection perks or something, but, it's not, it's just part of his tier 1's state, meanwhile, wraith has no terror radius while cloaked, but still gets detected, just, really fucking weird and inconsistent to me.
---
I get THAT reference-
---
Guys, I’ve talked to streamers that were with BHVR for that event thing they had and all of them said the freddy rework is gonna be amazing
---
That have an anime profile pic so they aren’t good
---
Unlucky
---
Dwight fairfield
---
Wait were you really trying to win in a match like that? That’s why you’re frustrated. It’s a bug meant to be toyed with, but you ain’t gonna beat 2 killers lol
---
Not even a joke, I only noticed the Claudette was there because of the name above her head.
---
A community of casualplayers who can't make it in other games, that's like antivaxxers disagreeing with me.
---
If NOED is up, gates are open, face is camped.. that’s why I would ask the same q
---
Oh, ok,  understood! thanks for the info
---
r/expanddong
---
Just destroy all the totems 4head
---
Nice comeback lmao.
---
Noone likes people like you. Are you saying you can do something about all seeing wraith with silent bell on lerys? You can at least hear pig and michael breathe, you cant do shit vs the wraith.
---
Why would someone bother asking "Why?" if you saved a survivor?
---
I’m assuming you mean the glitch where you spawn with the wiggle bar and it never goes away? Yeah that one sucks. You have to turn you camera angle to the direct you want. You character to go specifically or you can’t turn well and get that funny running in place issue. Sadly I experienced it for the first time two days ago, and  it made me get stuck at the top of a tractor on a Coldwind Map. Told my teammates in a message what was happening, and they played normally as long as they could (because I offered myself up as bait to stall the killer when I managed to start fast vaulting the ledge over and over). As soon as one died, they messaged the killer and asked him to spare me so I could at least safety Pip. And the last of the 3 (they were a SWF I think) gave me an item, unhooked me before my struggle ran out, and then let the killer kill them because they understood what happened. Killer was nice and carried me to the hatch. Got an Ash DLC trophy as compensation lol.
---
Wallhacking as Mirror Myers
---
Wallhacking as Spirit with Nurses
---
Making the hatch "invisible" as Pig (She was on the other side of the map nowhere near)
---
"Speedhacking" as Dwight because the ping jumped to the 700s right as it hit 5 seconds and I couldn't leave the lobby
---
Groovy.
---
Sandbagging is really any way that youre working against your team. Im just saying body blocking is usually referred to as that and is a positive thing.
---
Wait, he was complaining about a Nurse barely blinking ??
---
Nah thank you, I am not dumb enough to fall for the marriage meme and lose half/all my stuff. I am especially not dumb enough to take out a loan for a house and be in debt for the rest of my life.
---
Yes, there's a joke that they Eat the Cold Dirt.
---
Rank reset is only fun in swf. If your swf group is good you don't have to worry about bad teammates. Solo is horrible though. I actually prefer being low rank because you can use more variety of perks, and occasionally play against perks other than ruin,noed, and barbeque. I enjoy trying to figure out what 4 perks the killer has but in high ranks you only need to figure out 1.
---
(I'm not saying there is anything wrong with using those, the game needs more balanced perks so people will want to use other ones.)
---
I mean I’ve tried the jump scare Myers tactic and gotta say even though you can just pick people off gens, you slow speed and shit makes it impossible for end game
---
Using certain perks given to you to use by the game isn’t toxic, tbagging at the gates certainly is though.
---
Weird thing happened just tonight, i decided ill play survivor, bubba got us all and i specced the last guy, bubba chainsawed him on the hook.
---
End game chat went like this
---
&gt;gg (1st guy
---
&gt;gg (3rd
---
&gt;gg (killler and from now on me then killer
---
&gt;..was that bm? Why?
---
&gt;Why not?
---
&gt;because its not sporty
---
&gt;...
---
&gt;There were no tbags or any of that stuff, ya know? Well anyway gg
---
&gt; youre right, i shouldnt have bm'd, sorry
---
Then left. I was blown away, never saw that humility, hope the dude gets that i understand we all act like jerks sometimes.
---
I do, 98.7% of people who play her suck.
---
It is indeed the cold dirt he's staring at. XD
---
No, a person disagreeing with you on the balance of a video game is not at all similar to someone arguing that vaccines are harmful. If the legion was balanced, you wouldn’t see the whole community come together to agree that he isn’t. Especially in a community where no one can agree on anything.
---
Yeah again im assuming this wwould come after fixing some connection things. And it would start with like 30 min and work its way up to a week not just instantly be a week. But if youve DCd like 10 times in a short amount of time its clear youre just being a bitch and should be banned for a week
---
legion bad
---
Corrupted Save the best for last
---
For every hit you gain 2 tokens up to 8/10/12 tokens. If you hit the obsession, you loose 3 tokens and get stunned for 3/3.5/4 seconds. You don't get stunned if the obsession is the last living survivor. 
---
Each Token grants a stackable 5 % decreased cool-down on successful attacks. You can't earn more tokens when the obsession is dead.
---
It's a step. I would love for them to reduce the amount of games with less than 5 people but bringing people back to the lobby instead of forcing them to play the game at a significant loss is a far better alternative.
---
How So many survivors think tunneling or camping will get you banned I’ll never know
---
I'm hoping it's not a full overhaul.
---
I mean I have all the characters, I still main meg
---
I woulda yank on those pigtails like the thirsty neckbeard I am on the inside
---
I personally hate self care and prefer to just run Bond and Iron Will, so medkit and toolbox are both cool with me
---
I mean, that works too. Daddy Myers after all  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
That lower left panel especially checks out. I've actually had all others be Iridescent but I was snubbed the double pip because of Bronze Chaser.
---
So it's a 15% drop in movement speed. Thanks for the help.
---
So you don’t want tank to matter?
---
WAT I DO
---
On PS4 you can exhaust Legion's Feral Frenzy so easy that is frustrating for the killer. 
---
At that speed is hard to control the killer and a good survivor can easily escape him. I speak from experience from both survivor and killer.
---
#SHADDUP MEG
---
I ran blood warden against someone that didn’t know it existed and said they were reporting me for hacking the gates so he couldn’t leave and downing him and his friend.  I *did* down them both, but I left them to crawl out once the BW was up. I could’ve hooked or trapped them even. (Was playing Amanda)
---
*The Freddy update became a full gameplay overhaul*
---
Thats in the update post

If you expected a different result, I don't know what to tell you... :(

You don't understand, they're entitled to win. It's in the constitution.
---
My first r/CursedImages reply on Reddit.
---
Now I know I'm doing something right.
---
u/ImCows, the guy who apparently found this glitch, messed with it for a while but filed a report to BHVR including execution and details. This should be patched sometime soon. Sit tight.
---
Can't unsee
---
As a feng main wtf is your outfit why have you done my feng a bad
---
Then you are the one who should to be proud then.
---
Do you spend your time playing in Autohaven or what ? In a lot of maps when you're working on a gen you have no visibility outside the junglegym you're in.
---
No it's dumber, cause our takes more effort than just typing into a keyboard that PC player have already.
---
I dont get it. The pig was clearly a beginner and you did a pretty mediocre job at looping her. It's super uninteresting
---
I wish it wasn't so messy but it is. I'm probably not gonna play DBD all that much for the rest of the weekend.
---
It's a sign that many of their kind have not succeeded in being immersed.
---
Crouching pig tears
---
At this point, any time I put on a Mori I expect the game to crash, thats just how it be sometimes.
---
Yeah, but I'm hoping it doesn't mean they're scrapping his power. Those are two different things.
---
It's funny, you talk about decent players and then bring up pallet stuns.
---
Any killer who even remotely knows what they're doing is not tanking a stun unless they're getting a hit with it.
---
fair enough
---
But I’m not sorry
---
Do you kno how to have a conversation without belittle someone else's opinion and thoughts I'll wait.
---
I'm a filthy degenerate and can't help but check out Spirit's ass when I'm being carried to the hook.
---
It's against the rules to cuss people out now.
---
I guess the basics of the Dream World will remain, but theres so much to change it may be completely different
---
Not gonna lie I did this once against a Dwight that hid in a locker all game while the rest of us got wrecked. I could see him on the hook as I was dying, unmoving in his locker so I dropped a DM to the killer and he got caught.
---
Yeah. People have to remember, though, they have to stay true to the license.
---
im pretty sure theyre aware of this and theyve already announced legion changes where (i assume) theyll fix it
---
on a side note, i showed this to my brother in a kyf match and it was very amusing seeing his reaction
---
hell yeah!
---
I will never stop running noed on every single killer because all you guys do is bitch n moan when you literally have multiple second chance perks.
---
why is there a Harambe? is Min in heaven? pretty sure she's trapped in Entity. unless.....
---
Whenever I see a basement screenshot, I always feel weird not finding the leather face, feels out of place.
---
i hope they will too so im trying to draw attention. and yeah in kyf it stupid funny but horrible in i public match
---
Yes, at least thats how they literally state their intentions in the post
---
Seems fair you tunneled as a pig why am I not surprised.
---
honestly only Meg looks terrifying. for others it's just angle and lighting. Claude, Min and Laurie actually look better than usual. smile does make them prettier :3

*pig*
---
That isn’t most people’s problem. It’s that it allows crap killers to get 4Ks, which is why it’s a crutch perk. 
---
Not being able to prevent Adrenaline doesn’t make it worse than NOED. Stop chasing the survivor and stop bitching about getting looped.
---
If you want to complain about a crutch survivor perk, complain about old DS.
---
I’m confused
---
This is legit how they probably would all look irl. Being trapped in the fog forced to be murdered over and over again. For eternity. Everyone would have gone insane long ago.
---
Amazing
---
I think generally if people feel like someone is being toxic to them, they will be toxic back. I'm not saying what you did was wrong or right.
---
Relax. I was joking by putting WOOOOSH. I did laugh. You're a little over the top, I'd say.
---
Thank you good person. I just found my new Twitter profile background. 🤗
---
i'm always playing without headset so we i don't hear those kind of details. I'm always in hardcore mode, solo, no headset.
---
Yeah because rank can’t matter in asymmetrical game. Everyone can get to rank 1 using busted builds now, even with new pipping system. It’ll just make game more unfun for everyone.
---
i was so confused because this has been floating around r/2007scape alot so i assumed you posted that thete at first lol
---
Yes 100%

This dude is going places

thats dum the only language i know is cussing ppl out :(

Oink Oink fuckers
---
There’s definitely been an influx of network related DCs. This community is too retarded to consider it an option though, or lack the memory of how this used to happen far less a few patches ago...
---
I’m pretty much done trying to talk to people about it.
---
In reality this Killer likely got DCed and the survivors were left wondering “wtf” as well.
---
But NOOOOO it must be the survivors every time, even with bps! *rolls eyes*
---
Glad to be of service. 💅🏻
---
wheres he even from? northern england?
---
You can’t punish DCing until the insane amounts of network-related DCs are fixed first. Aka when dedicated servers come out.
---
It’s rare. It’s not supposed to happen but once a blue moon you’ll see it.
---
You literally don't know how latency and pallet stuns work. The killer can stop walking and not get stunned, or swing through it and get a hit through the stun.
---
Mediocre killers and better will do one of these things.
---
Play a bit of survivor, and get below rank 15. It'll widen your perspective.
---
im a meg main and i can hit ruin skill checks are u guys proud of me
---
You should really change the name of this game to Dead by DC. Clearly all anyone does in this game now
---
Sounds like the SWF just considered you the random. Sorry, man. They let the killer have a kill at your expense.
---
And no, there are no rules for farming. Anything goes.
---
People are getting more and more stupid who cares that you want views on your stupid yt channel just dont share exploits. If it was on any other killer it would be fine but its fucking legion
---
That's on you then. I'd imagine most (PC) players use a headset.
---
Well, i do no something about you: You must have a really boring life, otherwise you wouldn't waste your time in such a useless discussion. Konix out.
---
I really hope the end game changes is actually new and exciting, and not just a fat 3 minute nerf to survivors. I have a feeling it's gonna be a fat 3 minute nerf to survivors...
---
All female models must have topless cosmetics for purposes.
---
Rin about to get micheals evil withing 3
---
I'd pick up every teachable you can from the free killers first, but you should prioritize Hillbilly's, particularly Enduring. Others worth picking up are Barbecue &amp; Chili, Save the Best For Last (From Michael at 30), A Nurse's Calling, Hex: Ruin (From Hag), and Blood Warden (From Freddy).
---
Its annoying as a surv main because some idiot will be caught in the first minute and instead of at least wasting killers time they dc and now theres 5 gens with 3 people
---
Harsher dc would benefit all, idk why it isnt being implemented
---
that’s normal sir
---
I don't even want to imagine the prescription level deodorant required to address the level of sweat of any killer that has the audacity to kill the survivors in a multiple killer game.
---
The first sentence of the comment is saying its a suggestion after they fix these DC issues of people in loading screen and other unintentional ones.
---
nah, nurse takes no skill to play and only luck is needed to counter her, not much to be proud of
---
He thinks unrelenting works on successful attacks. This is why I stay off reddit. A bunch of whiners who don't even know how to play the game or haven't been playing long crying about shit that isn't an issue if you're good at the game.
---
Thanks man! You were a real good sport
---
Oh you sweet summer child.
---
Dwight Lives Matter
---
Just Dwight things.
---
Fair play then, if they were cocky assholes themselves it was definitely a legit DC.
---
But yeah what I am talking about is when the connection just severs for no reason. In DBD when a “true” accidental dc happens, both sides think the other DCs. They see a 0 for their opponents score.
---
Not that this board cares because it’s too stuck on the topic of toxicity right now... but if you take time every game this occurs in and just *ask* why they DCed, you’ll find a HUGE number of them are true DCs. It’s extra obvious in situations where BPS are used, The opponents were doing better than you, etc. 
---
I started doing this after myself calling survivors pussies and took it to their steam profile... and I got told I was the one who DCed.
---
Those stats of people DCing... it’s not all toxicity man but people don’t want to entertain the thought and keep their game buggy :/
---
He came in here expecting likes and good comments for mediocre looping and typical flashlight use
---
As a Nurse main, I don't understand the infatuation that other Nurse mains have on Gideon, I don't get it. I suck at that map, I hate it because of the line of sight issues I have. Jesus....I do great in corn maps but Gideon...ugh.
---
I love the legion in the background
---
Just make it do a quick friends list check and not complete gens until everyone in the group is gone. 
---
Also, I dont think it should complete generators past what the game already does on startup.  If one person dcs and there's 5 gens left it should complete one but if theres 4 gens left and one person dcs it shouldn't because thats how many gens are in a 3 man game.
---
And... for fairness reason have it complete the gen that has the most progress on it because it's a waist of the killers time when they chase and the person dcs
---
I have gotten lucky with him. It depends really. He needs a rework though.
---
How did you do that? I tried messaging it to one of my alt accounts and save the picture from there on my ps4 but it wouldn't load the picture.
---
I only got into the game last September and I've only entered the online community for it for a few weeks now; I'd never heard anyone else talk about it before. And in my idea for it I was unsure whether 6 or 8 Survivors would be better, because 8 fits by multiplying the player count all-around by 2, but also the numbers are a little out of whack and if two skilled Survivors were able to run the Killers around for a good while, the other six could get gens done frighteningly fast. Six would counter that a little bit, even if it messed up the proportions, but I think it might be a little more fair that way and help against getting gens done too fast. But yeah, same idea I suppose. Kind of makes me upset; if people have been asking for it since beta I've basically lost hope that they'll ever add it to this game... Maybe to the sequel though...
---
The first thing you described is farming, sandbagging is just getting in the way so you can’t run from the killer
---
What system and rank?
---
Read the comments please. I'm not a killer main. I'm not a survivor main. Disconnects are bad for everybody. Abandon your "he says, she says" mentality and look at the game objectively. The screencap is just to exemplify my point that disconnects are bad for everybody.
---
Uncanny Valley here we are
---
Oink
---
To be fair back in the early days of the game after release in 2016, unrelenting did work on successful attacks and was very strong, infact completely broken when combined with save the best for last, but I doubt that he was just living under a rock for 3 years as it is completely useless now and has been for a very very long time. Now I think of it that statement there was more of a joke then the facecamping leigon thing was,
---
Using items,offerings, perks is a requirement for killer performance. What if blood web costs were slashed by 50%.  Would boost leveling up without changing any game mechanics. If the target is 10-20k blood points per match than currently you will only get a few items in the web after. Some are not helpful.  Maybe keep items you dont want to be over used as is.
---
I was threatened with a report for hacks on PS4 because the swf I was playing against weren't getting their flashlight blinds off against me at pallets.
---
I was running Lightborn...
---
1) problem here, 
---
if you make it so that you have to reach rank 1 and stay in rank 1 for the entire season then someone could be rank 1 for weeks and then loose a few games on the last day so they go back to rank 8 and loose most of the rewards.
---
Otherwise if you just need to reach a certain rank, someone could get to rank 1 and then dc all the way to rank 15
---
2) softbans are just a no. It wont solve anything on console, and queue times will be longer than ever on each platform. At from my expereince people despise softbans on casual modes
---
And now Nea is hotter than her fanart
---
I'm glad that survivor mains can see this too - there are too many commenting here in opposition when it's painfully obvious that those same comments come from the ones who BM, flame and DC.
---
I disagree with that, you could spent 30 minutes finding that match for one person to disconnect then have to wait another 30 minutes for the same possibility to happen which in both of those instances instead of being forced back to a lobby and waiting 1 hour for maybe one game id rather play short and get 2-3 games in 1 hour instead of the slim chance of getting 1
---
Oink!
---
&gt; I think killer mains should stop whining and play the game
---
&gt; Seems to me killer mains dont like a challenge.
---
&gt; Lmaooooo ok...
---
Don't use belittling language if you don't want to be belittled yourself. You've done nothing but put words in my mouth and pull arguments out of thin air. You assumed I was a killer just because I suggest a balance that would benefit killers. You assumed I wanted swf removed when I made no mention of anything like that. You talked poorly of killers, ignoring the fact that survivors complain just as much for different reasons. And you ignore points that are made when you don't have an answer for them.
---
So don't act like I'm being this big bad bully when you came into the conversation ready to treat me like an idiot for daring to suggest changes to better incentivize playing killer.
---
In most games, using 3rd party tools to give an advantage outside of what the devs balanced around would be considered *cheating*. I'm not saying swf using comms is cheating by any means - that'd be ludicrous. But the devs need to either add comms to the game by default so that they can proceed to balance the game around having it as a baseline, or they need to find some kind of compensation for the people put at a disadvantage, because no one plays swf without comms.
---
the only people who get mad about it are those who dc themselves. There is literally 0 gain for me if another surv disconnects
---
We are all Dwight
---
If your screen is still showing you the tally marks moving then its not you that DCd and the loading bar will pause until whoever did lose connection closes their game.
---
I have all the teachables for all the free killers except huntress.I know I have blood warden, spirit fury, make your choice, dying light and save the best for last. Also Bubba and clown’s teachables. Not sure what else since those are the only 2 dlc killers I bought and I can’t bother to turn on my PS4 to check. 
---
But ofc I hardly have any of those perks at lvl 3 much less 2 or more of them unlocked for a particular killer. Gonna be putting blood points in my killers when I’m done with getting Ash teachables tho.
---
Let this be unwritten rule:
---
If you have the audacity to put your trashy ttv in your nickname then you can also use party streamer in my game.
---
New Killer: Harambe
---
Right here, COME AT ME BIIIIITCH!
---
Idk why you're associating that with the pig. No point in tunneling as the rbt doesnt count down while theyre being chased.
---
shes one of the oldest survs. Visiting junk yards from sundown to sunrise wiill do that to ya
---
If u ask me his power is not being able to damage survivers for 8 seconds but new details for a rework are coming out next week so we'll see how it goes. But he can be fun to play especially with ththe right add on and perk combos
---
can we just say that claudette like.. actually looks good
---
Both are on the radar, don't worry, we just don't have anything we're ready to share at this time.
---
Can someone send me directions on how to play a killer in a SWF... I have looked all over and I cannot find out how
---
I thought it was an invisible bug or something at first.
---
Awesome! Anything the devs will do about players who dc in the first 5 minutes after the match started? This is a really annoying issue since the killer is usually starting to farm then.
---
The grind is only fun if it is not required to do do well.  If you need to get 5 characters to 40 just to get a build you want to use is tedious and unfun especially if you have crap skills to grind with.
---
There could be, but this ain't it.
---
Hahaha I know that NoSoulWolf streamer, I so wish you were able to get that streamer 4K. Next time!
---
Then dont play the game if you cant handle other people. There should be huge penalties for purposely DCing. You all agreed to play the game. Goes for both sides.
---
You're really going all out for "most hated on the sub" aren't you.
---
Glad you noticed
---
I know she's in an infinite loop of life and death but she could at least accept that and lighten up a bit. Embrace it. 💅🏻
---
She's really nice with a smile.
---
Imagine DCing a game because the opposition wasnt worried about your fun. Lol you gonna leave a FPS game because the other team is better?
---
What is end game coapse?
---
LMFAO this is becoming a trend
---
Someone reported me for seeing their slugged aura with bbq. They had distortion but it doesn’t fire in the dying state
---
There are 12 of us
---
I've seen something like this before.
---
I guess you could say we're... Dead Meat.
---
Here's the problem with leigon, he ruins the whole gameplay dead by daylight is centred around in chases
---
The main gameplay is this. In chases, the killer is much faster then survivors and in general can catch up to them pretty fast in terms of running alone. To counter this, survivors have the ability to interact with objects around the maps faster and better such as vaulting windows much faster then the killer, using perks such as sprint burst and being able to stun the killer using pallets and perks. They have to use this mobility to out run the killer.
---
Now when you add a killer who can vault windows faster then the survivor, can jump over pallets just as fast (if not faster, not 100% sure) then the survivor and also has a much faster movement speed then survivor, this only leaves 1 possible way of countering him, stunning him with perks and pallets. 
---
If the killer knows the general mechanics of the game, this would prove to be very difficult and will give you very little of an advantage. The only real way of dealing with a leigon is to get as much distance as possible and avoiding chases which is just the general logic of chases. This is what people mean when they say that leigon has no counter play. There is no outsmarting a leigon. There is no skill of leigon alone, the only skill is just general knowledge of playing killer and knowing when to M1 and when to use your ability. 
---
Lets also not forget how cancer leigon's addons can be, including Frank's Mixtape and additional mending addons that can make the mend timer literally take longer then generators (I'd say usually twice as long). 
---
As a killer main I refuse to play leigon for these reasons. Him and wraith (only due to me just disliking playing wraith) are the only killers I don't play.
---
No they can’t lmao. I’m trash and can’t make it to purple ranks 
---
Ranking should matter otherwise you’re just gonna have SWFs who all could be red ranks decide its more fun to stay at rank 12+. The point to adding in a purpose to rank is to deter bullying new/bad players by veteran/good players

Why not? She would be a great fit. Yeah age her up a couple of years but she would fit in.
---
Press F for Susie mains. 😭
---
I got to talk with some of the devs at PAX EAST and when I talked to them about the Freddy rework one of the things I gleaned was expect late this year for it to come out. :(
---
red stain, no insidious lol
---
Honestly the only reason he's bad is because he's one-dimensional to play and his chainsaw doesn't have the speed and map pressure of the Billy's. One hit down potential is always a good thing, and his perks are solid, but I just think that when it comes to the chase, Billy is better.
---
I haven’t touched my Tapp since that event so it’s still in my bloodweb
---
I like object better, I can see the aura of all killers but if the perk is active and I don’t see the killers aura then I know it’s either a Myers or Freddy
---
With the right setup, he can be a solid, average-tier killer. Without the right setup, he's pretty bad. Regardless of what he's using, he's considered a good noob-stomper and newer players often have a lot of trouble against him.
---
It’s so funny to me when players complain about you doing the right thing. Like should you have run into him and get yourself killed?
---
Unless you are the killer body blocking the basement stairs. Then it's not too positive for the survivors.
---
How many hours do you have? 
---
With rank rewards even more people are gonna derank. Nobody wants to play against nurse-nurse-billy-nurse-spirit-nurse-nurse with bullshit addons even for rank rewards.
---
You really don’t understand that people will derank no matter what? Every game with ranking system has problems with smurfs and derankers, you can’t solve it entirely. What you can do is get better and still win against them)
---
This is a dope concept. Would love if they implement this
---
Really?
---
It's the Summer Event, their best event. Frosty Margaritas and Hook Grills.
---
Although his power works against him a lot (can't tell you how many times I've opened a gate right in front of his face due to the long sleep time) i personally end up giving him a lot of free hits because it can be hard to tell where he's coming from before he puts you to sleep. A lot of times I end up running straight at him on accident. Still weak af tho, excited for the rework.
---
Still if the gates were blocked if someone was on a hook the killer could easily get a 4K.
---
I understand what it is, i dont understand why they still have it in the bloodweb if the event is not active
---
Don't blame her tbh

That are your favorite to least favorite
---
Yes. It’s a strange language to be sure, and one can be forgiven for thinking it’s gibberish if they’re unfamiliar with it. I took four semesters of German. I’ve forgotten most of it, but I can still recognize the language when I see/hear it.
---
Yeah this is so accurate. I solo queue survivor on PS4 and there are a lot of extremely boosted individuals. If they aren’t sandbagging or hatch camping they are going down in 4 seconds to a Legion... It’s gotten to a point where I seek out the killer at the start of a match because I can at least *somewhat* hold a chase. Even then I’ll still have games where I juke for 2 minutes and nothing gets done even with no Ruin up.
---
Idk if it’s just because console has more kids or what but there are just some truly ascended survivors on console.
---
I was joking, hence the 4head twitch-speak.
---
Yes. I couldn’t tell is u/Kovil666 was making a joke or not, so I may have just gotten wooshed.
---
I love this idea. I came up with a few let me know what you think
---
Corrupted balanced landing: 100% stagger reduction from falling and a 5 second haste effect. 
---
But
---
While exhausted you are hindered and you get a 50% stagger reduction from falling. 
---
Corrupted Decisive strike: 7 second stun time on successful use with a 120 second use timer 
---
You are broken for the remainder of the match 
---
Corrupted alert: see the killer’s aura for 7/8/9 seconds when killer does the break action
---
The killer sees your aura as well for 3/4/5 seconds. 
---
Corrupted we’ll make it: 150% healing speed for 30/45/60 seconds on unhooking a survivor
---
You cannot heal yourself via Medkit or self care (others can heal you) for 180/150/120 seconds. 
---
Corrupted borrowed time: both you and the unhooked survivor gain the benefits of borrowed time (like it used to work) 
---
The killer sees your aura if you are outside of the their terror radius until put into the dying state (similar to MoM)
---
Corrupted tenacity: You crawl 75% faster and can move while healing and heal 15% faster
---
But:
---
The killer sees your aura if they are within 12 meters of you. 
---
Corrupted No Mither: you are broken and grunts of pain are reduced by 100% and you gain 50% more blood points in all categories 
---
You cannot heal your teammates and their aura reading perks do not work on you. 
---
Corrupted We’re gonna live forever: gain stacks of 4/5/6 and on unhooking and you and the saved survivor see the killers aura for 3/4/5 seconds
---
You cannot perform any action with a progress bar for 60/45/30 seconds after unhooking a survivor. 
---
Corrupted Adrenaline: when the exit gates are powered you are fully healed (woken up, mended, madness cleared, not sick, etc) and gain a 5 second haste 
---
If you are hooked after the perk activates you are instantly sacrificed. 
---
Corrupted aftercare: healing or saving a teammate also gives you a 10% altruistic action speed bonus toward that teammate and they to you as well as seeing each other’s auras 
---
If either you or any other survivor affected by aftercare is farther than 56 meters from the killer, the killer sees their aura as well. 
---
Corrupted bond: See survivors auras from within a 28/36/42 meter range
---
The other survivors cannot see your aura by any means (even on hook or dying)
---
Exactly lmao
---
Yes, but every game tries to deter them from deranking/smurfing with rewards at playing at a higher lvl. 
---
You really don’t understand that by not rewarding people for being Rank 1-4 is hurting the game. There’s no reason to play at such a rank. Wait times alone make it so players are deranking. There needs to be SOMETHING to deter you from deranking. 
---
Please don’t tell me you are one of those guys who deranks cause you don’t want to be in Red Ranks.
---
It depends on the killer. Hillbillies who only use their chainsaw to to get around and not to down because they aren't confident in their chainsaw ability are often mockingly called "M1 billies".
---
I mean.. It was a nice play, regardless. He had no way of knowing how much time was left on the exit gate, and OP made a good play to outsmart him. Period. Just let the guy have it.. We get it, you're killer mains. Chill. LoL..
---
He likes you so he dosen t want you to leave him, he just wants to be loved
---
Corrupted Adrenaline vs NOED Doctor would not end well if Madness 1 gets to come back
---
There's a chance you can use 360's to catch even the good killers off gaurd if you use them sparingly. They mainly work on the killers with less experience. You should really focus on finding pallets, looping them and breaking chases, those are crucial. 360's are most def fun tho
---
It could be the other way around with the last panel
---
Did you meme over a meme?
---
Definitely, except at lower ranks. Clown is quite good, Pig is decent, Doc is on the lower side. This is because Clown can deal with looping at high ranks quite effectively, and Pig has traps to slow the game down a lot. Doc is weak but still better than Freddy. This is why they’ve been pressured to rework him by the community.
---
survivors got nerfed
---
survivors were nerfed because SWF was too powerful, keep the current system and buff solo survivor lobbies ez fix
---
XD hate self care it takes ages to heal im pretty much good without it
---
On PC some games I will be randomly disconnected as a survivor in the middle of playing. Then when I play killer, survivors will disconnect against me randomly. If it was an internet problem I would imagine my stream would go down partially as well and it never does. Any suggestions?
---
If these were real I would be a David main
---
No thanks, "Gangsta".
---
When nobody is at home:
---
Self care
---
I mean, you also have Jeff Johansen and his perks, and judging that his perks are all okay, not a complete waste of money unless your a killer main. And when you bought legion, you got discordance, the one good perk he has as it prevents gen rushing.
---
Glitch
---
&gt; could have unrelenting
---
???
---
&gt; You recuperate faster from **missed attacks** made with your main weapon.
---
Unrelenting does nothing if you hit someone or something. You have to literally swing into the air.
---
"Oh how dare you not fall for the meme goy."
---
also he can just spam m1 and he doesn't get a penalty from it. thats the worst part. 
---
at least you can juke the other killers and it'll slow em down a bit. with legion you can juke him 3 times in a row and it means nothing
---
Nah chief that ain't it.
---
I can understand that feel, getting run by a survivor that clearly outclasses you is probably one of the least fun parts about being a killer.  Though, typically in a situation like that the best thing to do is switch off of the good Survivor to someone else.
---
Yeah sure it is.Come on dude,noone is buying it XDD
---
Get an exorcist!
---
Can you edit the blackboard too and make the guy mccote
---
Of course 💁🏻‍♀️
---
What system?
---
Are you me?  I'm garbo at looping but I almost always give people playing killers I'm familiar with advice after the match ends lol.
---
BBQ and Ruin are not that strong.
---
I'm working on a much larger one with more stand out cosmetic characters. 😎
---
muh instagens
---
How are people doing it is it an exploit of something random
---
Ps4 slim
---
didn’t say the nerfs weren’t needed, just that’s why it’s harder now
---
I still don't get why you all just can't cleanse totems before all the gens are finished
---
Oh. Well I play Xbox. However if u want to get it, get it now! Ranks reset today and if u wait, u will have difficulty finding matches due to your low rank! Hope this helps.
---
Ah I see. So...
---
Why are you gae?
---
Gae? Not me. 😂
---
I play in PS4 and my answer would be yes. Exciting announcements were released yesterday. I've been playing today and there's no wait time for lobbies currently, Atleast in my area. Hope you get it.
---
This is the best Update!
---
https://youtu.be/p--GfVXfNa0?t=65
---
Personally, I think the issue is that most survivors don't know wtf they're doing because the gameplay is much more casual for that role and so a lot of players learn less, especially if they play SWF a lot. Survivors who understand what they're doing on any level are quite strong
---
I really wish I knew
---
Bröther you must be de gey cause you knöe de wey
---
Sounds like you need to track better and learn how to find survivors.
---
Can you pm me how do do it ?
---
Literally the worst killer in the game right now. The effectiveness of all killers is judged, in my opinion, using them with their best perks, no add-ons, and against survivors who know what they're doing. Going by that set up, he's the worst killer in the game bar none. His power in effect is really just having to wait seven whole seconds to hit a survivor. This causes all sorts of problems for Freddy. Generator about to pop in six seconds? Literally if you were any other killer you could prevent it from popping. Freddy? Well you're fucked. Survivor fast vaults a window six seconds after you started putting them to sleep? Well you're fucked. Survivor six seconds away from opening the exit gate? Well you're fucked. And the issues don't stop there. Even when you finally have a Survivor asleep, what's his chase potential like? Dog shit. Just a 115% move speed, M1 killer at that point with NOTHING to help him chase. No bear traps to help with looping, no chainsaw for instadowns, no way to slow survivors movement. Literally nothing. "Well what's the trade off for all that bullshit?" I hear you ask. Well get this! Literally nothing! Sure, having a Survivor asleep lets you see their aura pass 24 meters and it cuts all their action speeds by 50% but really, how often do you have more than one survivor asleep at a time? The one you're chasing? The one who the action speed penalty doesn't even apply to since they aren't working on a gen or healing another survivor... you seeing the issue here? Good survivors will stay spread out against a Freddy, making it literally impossible for you to have more than one, MAYBE two survivors asleep at once. "Well it's hard to wake up right?" HAHAHAHA no. Simply... MISSING A SKILL CHECK will wake a Survivor up. And that applies to all skill checks in the game. Healing, repairing, sabotaging. Hell if you could, missing a Snap Out Of It skill check would probably wake you up. Everything about Freddy is a downside. His power helps him in no conceivable way, and only serves to hinder his chase potential and fuck you over around every corner. I really hope the rework we've waited over a year for is worth it.
---
M1llies.
---
Nerfed in what sense? What did they change? I know they changed not being able to see killers perks until match end I agree with that one.
---
Congrats! I'm on my way, just have a few more killer-centric ones to get and I'll hopefully be joining you!
---
&gt; thank you for being the only one who actually posted how it's done to satisfy my curiosity
---
Damn, I can't believe I missed the answer to life's greatest mystery
---
Those are SURVIVORS?
---
They don't have nearly the same texture tone!
---
I'm not Gae. You are gae.
---
They have changed nothing since that

Normally I'd laugh at anyone ragequitting over a Freddy but I saw the Insidious so I have to ask.  Were you camping them?
---
maybe the killer
---
I think impaired should you hear the terror radius at a reduced range to be more balanced
---
This might be good!
---
Corrupt Pop goes the weasel:
---
After hooking a survivor the next 2 generators you break is instantly regressed by 27%/30%/35% of its total progress.  Failure to break 2 generators within 45 seconds will give the next survivor you hit endurance and will not put them in the dying state.
---
No. I only used it once to find a hiding Dwight near a gen
---
Sometimes you don’t.
---
“Remember, you will die”
---
Okay, weird perk but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.  Sounds like they were just little bitches.
---
It's not an avoid. it's literally a free hit. You get a speed boost, they go into attack recovery, the full 9 yards. It's a Desicive Strinke that instead of only working for the obsession, you just have to get hit three times first.
---
NO BREATHING!!
---
Ruin recently got a QOL change making the lower tier versions of it affect all players rather than just affecting 2 survivors but at a lesser degree. It's not a significant change for higher ranks but I suppose its made it more popular at the lower ranks.
---
As a result, new survivors are having a hard time fighting against this perk.
---
There was also a sale meaning its likely that a wave of new survivors have entered the match making which means they are susceptible to wasting pallets &amp; failing ruin skill checks.
---
Cause of the ranking changes I wouldn't be surprised if the killer skill at the lower ranks is a mix between decent killers being deranked because of the new piping system or higher ranked players smurfing to be able to access a larger player base.
---
Isn't witch hunting against the rules of this sub?

Just report them and move on.

I want to use this time to remind everyone that due to password breaches existing and probably affecting sites you wouldn't expect, it's a good idea to protect the accounts you care about (Steam, Reddit, XVideos etc.) with Two Factor Authentication. I was lucky and was able to recover my account within 2 minutes, it might now be the same case for you. [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) is an excellent resource to find out if your emails and/or passwords have breached already, in case you are curious.

Harambe stand confirmed
---
How can you not read it in Monto's voice?
---
Sounds like scummy swf...not you. I do farming with both swf and as killer. When you cant message people it's harder because people will run and leave the person on the hook until you walk away. Me and my friends have our rules tho and it's basically common courtesy. (If you dont its whatever cuz the only points that you want get back is repair) 
---
2 hook save per person, 
---
Dont waste pallets, use them for stun points. 
---
Dont be rude to killer, they are being nice so do the same. Help the killer get points to. 
---
And finally DONT FINISH GENS. A lot of people dont respect or know this rule but if you do coop actions on gens, 99% them tell the killer and go to another. Do so until everyone have Repair pts. If they all pop then there is someone who got the raw end of the deal. 
---
Understand that's just me and my friends and we try to make sure everyone is on board. Now as killer I have my own rules so it isnt reportable. (Yes it can be reported if not consensual on all sides.) If you're a killer farming get consent with these steps. 
---
Message the survivors and tell them what you're doing. 
---
Hook the accepting ones and leave the other ones alone, tho if they get salty go ahead and murder. 
---
Only hook each survivor twice 
---
Let them be and just get your points and only stop when you are full and so are they.
---
What's up fellow daddy
---
Love that!! Thank you!
---
What's "witch hunting"?
---
They banned people for the bloodweb glitch too lmao. But banning people who lagswitch? Nah
---
I feel Janes spotty potato forehead mashing my soul.
---
Fantastic question: I've been watching Bricky for way longer tbh, but yeah it doesn't take much to hear Monto too lol
---
She saw shirtless Myers
---
Yeah, aside from being mori'd EVERY game (and I do it to them when I play killer, it's professional courtesy, right? lol)   I'd never put TTV in my name just because 99% of these people that do are jackasses.  
---
I'm a jackass that doesn't need TTV in my name.

Well Freddy works really well for survivors that are not experienced or understand how his power works. Which funnily enough, because he is such a rare killer to see, most people have not really played Freddy enough to fully counter him.
---
Freddy is a pretty mediocre killer. He is pretty much an M1 killer that has amazing tracking potential &amp; a game stalling ability. 
---
Hes bad because most people dont fully understand how to play Freddy. He is by no means an great killer, Low mid-tier at best but he can be very good if the correct perk combination &amp; add-ons are used with him. 
---
Tips for beating Freddy
---
- Freddy's power means that as soon as he puts you to sleep, you have a 7-second timer at base to find a window or pallet to use against Freddy. Make sure to keep tabs on his location because after the 4th second he disappears &amp; reappears in the dream world where he can hurt you meaning a free hit can be likely.
---
- Never sneak while in the dream world. Outside of his terror radius he can see your aura meaning he can see whatever you are doing. Best thing is to work on a gen &amp; fail a skill check to leave dream-world otherwise if you see him coming try to run to a loop &amp; waste his time. 
---
- Freddy is funny in that he is both strongest &amp; weakest during the end game. 
---
- If he sleeps everyone then the exit gates are going to take much longer to open which can allow him to spend more time slugging survivors to try &amp; win the game. If he uses perks like Remember Me then opening the gates is a fever dream as they almost take as long as completing a full gen by yourself. Once you get a gate open through then Freddy is really weak. If you are unhooked then you can usually make it to the exit gates providing your teammate's body block Freddy or take hits for you.
---
- His power is countered by using the perks self-care, Adrenaline or Borrowed time.
---
- Borrowed time really hurts Freddy because his lullaby counts as his terror radius. Survivors being put under with borrowed time have 7 seconds + the effect of borrowed to escape Freddy which can guarantee them an escape.
---
- Self-care has a very high probability of providing skill checks. It's like 10% per second, so you can escape fast from Freddy if you are injured. You will also want to heal against Freddy as he can usually
---
 get a free hit on a survivor if they are caught out of a loop or vault location.
---
- Adrenaline immediately removes sleep from you &amp; heals you meaning you can run from Freddy before he sleeps you again or escape a chase with him, forcing him to try &amp; sleep you again. This perks removes all of Freddy's pressure at the end game.
---
- The best advice is to simply work on gens &amp; break all the dull totems you can find. If you are in sleep mode, either break out of it by going to a gen when sleeping or self-caring. 
---
- If he chases you run to the nearest loop &amp; waste as much of his time as possible. 
---
- Freddy is really weak to gen control as his power doesnt help end chases but allows him to watch what all the survivors are doing. Its not very good unless he wastes alot of time trying to sleep everyone together which doesnt work if survivors keep failing skill checks.
---
They increased the minimum pallets per map to 8, so sometimes it'll force double pallets to hit the minimum now.
---
Since you're running all by yourself and your team isn't there, it looks like your internet had a hiccup and disconnected YOU from the host
---
Death’s door is a end game unbreakable, let’s say that everyone is getting slugged down when the exit gates are powered. You can recover yourself once again during the exit gates being powered at the cost of aura revealing yourself to the killer.
---
Double Back I was thinking of changing to make it so that when you are hooked, pallets respawn, though you cannot respawn the same pallet twice. Though it’s still just broken in concept.
---
I also haven’t seen much people run anything that tracks black locks for Entity’s Bluff, so that’s why I created this one in the first place.
---
How do you send such a ticket?
---
Yeah true, especially when combined with the Perk:Spine Chill, so you know the killer is watching you, maybe it should be reduced. I think it’s meh for an idea.
---
Do you really hate Noob3
---
James Charles called, he wants his pants back.

Thank you! :D
---
Freddy does need a rework. I love Freddy but I can’t deny his crappy performance above my rank.
---
Why would you think that?
---
Uh oh retard alert
---
But all the zombies are the same, imagine having to run from Myers and you walk right into Amanda, I’d probably shit myself right there
---
downvote for clicky clicky :&gt;
---
Freddy’s lullaby isn’t effected by insidious so it wouldn’t work for camping
---
Decisive strike worked for all players who ran it, in fact the non obsession DS was strongest because it was unexpected and the killer couldnt play around it.
---
MoM is not “free”. You have to get M1ed three times.
---
The perk sucks. Its amazing against low tier killers and completely useless against the high tier killers. Literally any perk you slot in for MoM would do just as fine against low tier killers while being good against the high tier killers who dont activate MoM or care about MoM.
---
A well typed up comment, many valid points, but...
---
&gt; To this day, I'm very confused to why it has almost never been really debated here. 
---
Everything you've said has been debated endlessly across this forum over and over.
---
I don't think anytime soon, and I don't think crossplay with Pc and Console will ever happen since Pc players would have a big advantage maybe between Xbox and Ps4 in the future. I believe they have other things they need to worry about before that.
---
Nah, we need Jane in a G-String.
---
Right they both suck but you'll still run both in 100% of your games, weird how that works.
---
Anything so we don't have to look at her spotty forehead.
---
Nope, killer could have hard dc’ed, she wouldn’t get anything and lose her item
---
Meh, lots of games use seasional ranking for match making, it has it's up and downs. You wouldn't be happy being rank1 and getting 3 guys that haven't played in 2 years but still are rank1 either.
---
I personally like it, because i want to try and learn to play new killers, so being a few ranks lower is a good time for that.
---
Put your finger in my AHSSSS gachiBASS
---
Nothing out of the ordinary.
---
But Wriath still can't do a thing about his loud stomping. Or can he?
---
Kiiller side: 
---
Lag from surviviors makes it hard to hit them.
---
Bad hitbox for attacks. 
---
Wrong hits happen too. 
---
No counter vs Gen Rushing. 
---
Getting blocked. 
---
No gameplay with perks eithger
---
Looks like Count Olaf's hideout.
---
Woof, were they trying to stress test people’s epilepsy?  Not night mode friendly lmao.
---
99 a gen then slap on a Humming bracket to prevent it from regressing? 
---
Killer Mains: YOOO THATS SO BROKEN

---
Lol damnit, no matter how many times I see this Vince McMahon gif, it still gets me
---
All the greens are in yellow tho so it works.
---
Its one of my favorites. I’ve been waiting for an opportunity to use it and I after I read the dev update I was like fuck yes I’ll post it when I get out of work. I get home and there’s a template version posted already....
---
Regardless I think the gif is way funnier so I posted it anyway.
---
What a waste, jump scare myers is how you deal with streamers.
---
As a killer main, if a survivor goes in front of a closet i open it first, ive caught like 7 people like that, always pissed em off
---
I've seen some other people suggesting there be an option whether or not you want to be pitted against SWF groups or not; unsure what the devs' opinions on that are, but I think that would be a pretty good solution. It could be the same possibly for KWF. Realistically, it would have a seperate kind of lobby compared to regular games - think of the FPP and TPP divisions on the 4 lobby types in PUBG. That way you know whether you'll be working against one Killer or two, and you get to pick your poison.
---
Hilarious
---
They give those. You're just being unlucky
---
Haha worth it
---
Oh, what I read was to unready as soon as it said searching for a match, yours makes a lot more sense, thanks.

I dont mind facing them but I usually do the trick where you jump through a window or pallet they just jumped through and then when they get their fatigue I run away.
---
Usually I get facecamped for being toxic once they catch me though. :(
---
If you want that cosmetic I want Jane in a slingshot bikini or just pasties.
---
It's not bannable unless you're holding the match hostage. Blocking the stairs to wait out BT, DS, or just to ensure you get a hit on ever survivor in the basement is not bannable.
---
Isn’t there a way with perks and addons to make it so Freddy has practically unlimited wall hacks in the dream world?
---
His addons are filthy blade and nasty blade!
---
Raise the drawbridge, release the sharks, burn the countryside.
---
I honestly Lobby-Dodge all Twitch Streamers. They’re usually the most toxic/showboating Survivors (since being toxic = views) and I cant stand it.
---
I think I’ve gone against maybe 2 Streamers who weren’t teabagging me at every opportunity, and they were nice enough to clip my Devour Hope Mori and send it to me.
---
You can just bin the ritual to get another ritual once a day. You might get another killer ritual but its purely luck based.
---
Screw Moris, if *anyone* has twitch or TTV in their username, I'm switching to Leatherface and putting on Insidious.
---
Same my guy, im a killer main and i get NOTHING but survivor dailys, I do not like playing survivor one bit and i keep deleting them but it only EVER gives me survivor dailys
---
How would a closing zone work though, the gates are on the edge of the maps.
---
Because average killers can use overpowered addons and easily get in red ranks. They’ll want to do it for rank rewards. I don’t want to play against omegablink nurses or other similar shit every match. My solution is that you have to take into consideration addons for ranking up. Want to play ultra rare addons and moris - black pip maximum, etc. But that’s still not good enough since sometimes best addons are green+yellow or similar. Game needs actual balance before implementing rank rewards, and that’ll never happen.
---
I got “reported” for “rage quitting” after having an absolutely crushing start.  2 survivors were dead, one was on their death hook, and only 1 gen had been done.  I was absolutely fucking crushing it, and by that point I was just toying with the last 2 survivors trying to build up some deviousness points (ambushing them, letting them go, and then ambushing them again.  This was pre-deviousness buff Oink Mistress so it took fucking forever to get those points).  And then my fucking game crashed, and I was upset because I had worked really hard and had done really well, and would earned really shitloads of bloodpoints.  Then, this stupid dickhead/cunthead messages me, calling me a coward and a bitch and saying that I was going to get banned for “rage quitting” and all sorts of other nasty stuff.
---
Like, mother fucker, I was kicking your shit in!  Why on earth would I leave a game that I was winning?  How can you be so stupid to think that you were in any sort of advantageous situation?  I think that s/he thought that I wasn’t losing them on purpose, that I was genuinely getting bamboozled, but that’s even fucking stupider because after every ambush in the second half I was just standing perfectly still, not even trying to resume the chase or anything.  And after using my powers so well in the first half, did you think I just suddenly forgot how to Pig?
---
I’ve got a decent amount of general complaints from losers and rude, gloating messages from sore winners, but very few times has anyone brought reporting and banning into the mix.  This is one of the only ones, and it just made me laugh.  I was actually in a better mood after receiving this, at least there was something gained from my lost Bloodpoints.
---
I did, thanks for the help
---
Plus the audio of her clapping when she runs.

stalking with myers in t1 is the best part of the game, fight me.

My friend just got into a match where he was plague. There were also a doctor, a Freddy and two survivors... He just searched for a game as usual and this happens?
---
That developer update restored my faith in the game
---
Seconded
---
This is exactly right. Part of balancing the game is making sure the player base has enough of both role to equal out to lower queue times. If they make Survivor too difficult, they risk losing numbers on that side. It doesn't make sense from a business or game play perspective. Plus, I like that Killer is more challenging and thus more rewarding when you work hard to get good at it.
---
Nea would have yellow teeth just saying
---
This is why I wish they’d just add mod support already. We all have access to Unreal, I’ve seen cool custom character/map/item/skin concepts. Just let us play custom games with a non-EAC client and a modded content folder. Add workshop support and add the coolest stuff to the game, TF2-style.
---
You don't hear them with a head set either because the terror radius drowns it out
---
Heads up, I’m pretty sure even if only you act as the killer, the game will still have two.
---
Omg
---
Dead hard + powerhouse would be extremely fun but a bit too powerful
---
Regarding the last thing you said, I noticed I get notifications from RepostSentinal bot if one of my templates is used and its close enough to the original, but does Magic Eye Bot prevent some posts from being pushed through? I haven't seen that yet.
---
BHVR pls make these real
---
The crossover none of us saw coming. Next Killer is Tom Nook.
---
that feng min tho man...She went to a pallet, i used my power and then she dc'd before she even got into the dream state.
---
I play both survivor and killer
---
lmao
---
ur welcome
---
Yes
---
Seriously. I love Legion's mori animation. So much better than anyone else's. Only one that comes close is Nurse's, and there's not really any reason to use a mori with her.
---
Thats epic meme
---
The thing is that I wasn’t doing any of that. It was a David and I left in the trial. We were both doing our best to survive together. Idk if this was a salty killer or salty survivor.
---
That’s what I was thinking. If you’re going to call what someone did to escape or get away from killer a nice play or whatever the killer should be good
---
You haven't been here long, have you?
---
It seems super powerful on paper but all around he’s outdated. Survivors aren’t “scared” of the killer anymore. Back when I first started playing I remember getting jumpy over hearing la la la la la la la, but as you play more thengane loses the horror aspect and he’s just awful now.
---
same
---
By "its", the devs are referring to the chapter
---
Dwight got that cake cake cake cake cake ca
---
This will be fixed when 3 man games are cancelled anyway. That way no one has to deal with a 3 man game or a mori.
---
No they were not fixed. Its 2 years now.
---
Every killer rant gets addressed immediately to the point of "heavily rework the gameplay to have a better freddy", while nothing its ever done for the surv community and we get the same **** since 2 years now.
---
I think we have the right to say it regardless of killer mains trying to silence these facts.
---
Killers always claim "balance" but how are the things in the above list "balanced" at all?
---
Yea i have never ever access the bloodweb through Dwight so that might be it.
---
Deliberately, and the probably weren't using gens if it was that constant. Instead, they're likely hopping in and out of lockers, or fast vaulting repeatedly. If you're far enough away, they produce the same alerts as a gen mistake.
---
Sign me up twice.
---
Hopefully that comes with the dedicated servers. Right now when I play Killer I know I can lunge throw pallets and windows and get a hit probably 80% of the time or more.
---
I need a link to these photos.
---
If it made it better I did it on purpose
---
As long as he has about the same schtick, I'll be cool. I just really like a chill killer that lets you just tap survivors and not worry about looking stupid for them. And, well, since they can't see you when they're awake, I see a lot less bullying when I play as him.
---
Make sure the game is using your dedicated gpu,
---
That killer could be me, I am terrible at playing the killer, this is why I am a survivor main.
---
People using your templates can probably just use the age old method of putting a picture of billy in it and that should bypass it, worked for me. Otherwise I'd imagine if two people use the same template I'd imagine a similar issue might happen for some of the templates
---
No. I reset bc of an “activate windows” bug
---
fair i was assuming he meant holding the game hostage
---
Thought i was on the darkest dungeon subreddit for a second lol
---
That's weird. Based on my games today I could have sworn their favorite store was this one: https://i.imgur.com/RZnOhHf.png
---
On PC it's sadly not as easy to do
---
Boa br
---
Exactly! I agree. Cos my friends and I have some fun af games whether it be two of us or the whole quad squad
---
Why sad? This is a good update to fix Legion.
---
You keep insisting that they shouldn’t reward good players but instead punish new players with SWFs squads that want to make the killer DC.
---
Upvoted
---
The thing is dedicated servers should help if they do them right, but you can even watch videos from like 6 months ago where the the killers actually had to hit people. How does a game regress that much you know, I haven't even seen anything from the devs regarding this, which is the biggest problem.
---
Good job, what trophy did you have the most trouble with collecting?
---
Wth 😂
---
 Loved this Freddy buff
---
How do you go about making sure the game recognizes your gpu?
---
Might as well, console started with voice comms for everyone.
---
Thank you!!  From start to finish in like 16 hours!
---
Dont do that. Its the most obnoxious shit you could do
---
Not every 4K is a merciless. And depending on your rank you need to do a lot more for a Merciless.
---
I insist that being in red ranks is not equal to being a good player.
---
I’m not trying to be toxic I’m saying things like the fireworks they’re odd stuff that could be fun
---
Way to ruin a joke

Oof, uh, it depends on your GPU I'm pretty sure. I dunno if they all work this way, but I can right-click my desktop, open up my Nvidia control panel, pick DBD from the drop-down and select GPU in the other drop-down
---
Hey BHVR I just wanna make sure you guys know I'd definitely hand over actual money for these
---
Thx I’ll have to look them up I don’t remember perks very well but thank you
---
Sad? Man, I can’t fucken wait. I’ll be able to actually play legion with out getting DC’d on all the time I don’t care if he gets hardcore nerfed I’ll still be happy
---
[Oh, bother.] (https://i.imgur.com/TogJIFA.jpg)
---
What if your both?
---
*TM*
---
Wraith is a yellow bear confirmed.
---
Something tells me you would have gotten bullied this game
---
Use Ruin and a killer with good map pressure (Nurse/Billy/Spirit). I'm a killer main but doing gens is the survivors main objective, you can't really fault them for doing gens. I main a low map pressure killer so I just try and end chases as quickly as possible and give them other things to do besides gens (finding totems, healing, etc...). And just accept that sometimes you're gonna lose everybody, it's how the game goes.
---

---
Y'all need Jesus.
---
Absolutely not. In fact, I love meg. If you pick Meg then you automatically have a higher chance of me giving you hatch than the others and getting you off hook. I love megs :')
---
I've bought this game for many people. I always take them through an advanced tutorial right after they finish the built in one. I pick trapper and show them how to run the short-long wall, the kill shack, and the jungle gym. They usually can't do it very well at first, but understanding the principal's of looping will allow them to develop the skills much faster. Also knowing about noise notifications and scratch marks is very helpful.
---
A little bit of plastic for her brow line and she'd be stunning. 💁🏻‍♀️
---
I'd be dead..... HARD
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GPplbqrnH7E
---
I need all of them.
---
Because as I said, it needs a main effect. How is seeing the Killer's aura within 40 meters for 4 seconds too much? It'd give you information just like Barbecue &amp; Chili does but as a Survivor. It'd give you information you might not get otherwise with 40 meters, like if a Jumpscare Myers is around a corner or if a Insidious Leatherface is facecamping in the basement, how is that too much?
---
What does Endgame Collapse mean?
---
00f hot bois
---
Meh.  Mostly everyone gonna run Self care, DS, MoM and a exhaustion perk regardless.
---
Holy fuck buddy
---
Its a meme
---
He's showing his killer privilege, I am offended.
---
"bg toxic gameplay, reported" - Billy
---
You are correct. Also worth noting is Object of Obsession is weird when playing against Freddy; if you're awake and looking in his direction, the perk procs, but you can't see him... *but he can see you*.
---
Once you're asleep, though, you can stare at each other all you want, since he can see you anyway.
---
I think you’re forgetting that it’s 1v4
---
The killer gets such a better perk (although it’s silly to compare two perks on different sides of an asymmetrical game...) because they are all by themselves, and the survivors have 3 other teammates on their side.
---
WGLF is fine.
---
Was just in a game with my husband and our friends, we got Mori Myers who killed us while being a cutie sharing his bloody streams and i was screaming about how he should have mori'd me shirtless
---
i need a shirtless Myers
---
That IS the intended way to play for killers though. They have to murder, and they did. It just takes longer. I’ll get slugged before I get camped
---
You can hear Adam scream when he gets hit. I was watching with headphones though.
---
Didnt that change after the ranking changes? I havent attempted any adepts recently but I and many other people werent getting adept challenges from 4ks after the ranking change.
---
I wanted to take the rank reset to grind the Adept killer trophies but I think its bugged.
---
STILL FUCKING PISSED!
---
Not playing optimally on purpose. Letting yourself get hooked on not chasing well. Example: I'll sandbag as killer if only 3 people load in.
---
Oh and you’re not supposed to escape and get MAX PROGRESS MAX PIP MAX POINTS every round. That’s insanity, to think you are entitled to it. You aren’t even entitled to have fun (something that is completely perspective based anyway)
---
*NOED INTENSIFIES*
---
Rofl shouldve known it was this douchebag behind the "just do what you want, I mean whne old BNP existed every game would have 4 of them because survivors do what they want as well" except survivors didn't do that and some of these made-up "rules" as you'd like to call them are actually pretty fucking good for the game, cunt.
---
If I'm playing solo sometimes I'll run it because I don't use self care and I can't rely on teammates to heal me. My usual build is an exhaustion perk, Iron Will, DS, that 4th slot is open to whatever (Plunderers, We'll Make It, Prove Thyself.)
---
Makes sense :)
---
Real talk I am starved for new survivor items/addons/offerings.
---
Did you forget to take your meds?
---
i hope they fix him
---
i want them to make her as fast as regular killers when not using feral frenzy, increase the duration of feral frenzy
---
and make it so it only takes 2 hits to down someone with feral frenzy
---
Somebody looped the spirit for the whole game...
---
Probably better off without you anyway.
---
NO I JUST HATE THAT THING!
---
?
---
I'd recommend playing some civilization.
---
Are you alright buddy ? If this is not a troll post, I think you need some help :)
---
I still do hear em, it's a lot quieter than it used to be though (recent patch fucked it up).
---
I’ll give you a simple answer
---
no.
---
ik you are trolling but please stop, you're hella cringe
---
Nope.
---
When you go afk1 minute to grab snacks and when you come back exits are already open
---
Maybe you should just watch some shirtless myers- hell calm you down good~
---
1: I religiously main myers
---
2: read the flair before you comment
---
HEY! i have an anime pic and i am good...a good survivor. i'm a shitty killer
---
To make it simple. Survivors hate legion because there isn’t any real counter play to him, he can vault windows and pallets so it’s almost impossible to win a chase. Killer mains dislike him because despite that power he isn’t a very strong killer at higher ranks. Overall in the current state legion is just a toxic killer.
---
Because it’s right next to the exit gate.
---
I'm not a troll I just started a shape religion
---
Uh, i guess something like, Do Everything Myself Build: Deliverance (get yourself off the hook) Self-care (heal yourself) unbreakable (pick yourself up from dying state) and resilience (do things faster when injured) would that work?
---
Then you did it on purpose cus that was good
---
I like that gachimuchi reference there
---
Nice
---
I just ^H ^A ^T ^E that meme!
---
Revolution?
---
It probably is but still it does not have a /s soooo..... Idk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I've played for a year, but I don't like talking to people.
---
&gt; They become audible when he is really close and its easy for the sound of a gen being repaired to mask his footsteps.
---
I personally have no problem hearing killers' breathing/footsteps over repairing sounds.
---
&gt; Also you cant see wraith on lerys thats the whole point of that map
---
Using Spine Chill to counter a certain Wraith build in a certain map is even more situational than justifying using Calm Spirit to counter Doctor...
---
&gt; Spine chill with resilience also makes your vaults much faster in chases so thats another use for the perks
---
I've used that myself, and it's ok(ish), quite situational especially with the current hitboxes/lag issues. Also i hear it might've been shadownerfed (not completely sure on that as i haven't tested it myself)
---
Yee
---
Ok...go play something else...
---
My god that is my body exactly.
---
You're not toxic by looping killers
---
Everyone plays her cus she’s invisible
---
Anime profiles are a mixed bag, they’re either good at survivors but suck as killers or vise versa.
---
Not related but i played against the pig and her name was RubyRose 
---
also no, Nea is more of a badass
---
I like that there is a killer who can just vault pallets. I have been forced to deal with people circling around and jumping over pallets over and over again forever. 
---
I like Plague cause I can puke over pallets, and Cannibal cause he can obliterate them.
---
&gt; Also worth noting is Object of Obsession is weird when playing against Freddy; if you're awake and looking in his direction, the perk procs, but you can't see him... but he can see you.
---
Yup. With T1 Myers you get no perk proc or aura. OoO is part of my usual build :)
---
Dude yes! Like holy shit i was like this is so cringey
---
Because you are ruining my character
---
That I modled
---
Tbh BBQ&amp;Chili is great just for the BP. It's very easy to counter the aura reading.
---
I have no idea about the Ted talk but that is the girl who helped get the recent picture of the black hole. This pic is a photoshopped pic of her with the original having the black hole on the monitor screen.
---
Sad DC culture isnt a priority. On average I have two plug pullers a match....
---
How much worse does it have to get?
---
TAKE IT B ♂ Y
---
Way too true lol
---
Mark survivors for death? Calm down pooh bear
---
Is this a serious question?
---
Overcharge: 
---
* After damaging a generator, the next time a survivor interacts with it, they will be faced with a **tremendously** difficult skillcheck. 
---

WHY DOESNT THIS HAVE THE APPROPRIATE APPRECIATION IT DESERVES THIS IS SO ACCURATE
---
I needed a good laugh! Thank ya man.

Problem is people use no mither with resilence and starting healthy defeats the point
---
Just in time to see a new meme. :)
---
fuck you mean, this is best Feng outfit hands down 😠
---
You insist that they shouldn’t reward players getting to rank 1 lmfao
---
That's like a killer saying the DC when they get blatantly looped... this is the exact kind of skewed thinking that's made DC into such a prevalent culture.
---
Stop placating yourself for your losses and rage quits. This the exact reason BHVR needs to prioritize abandonment issues... people aren't responsible enough to be honest with themselves or the game. Humility and pride use to be enough but these words mean nothing to post millenial gamers.
---
Yeah because hitting rank 1 rn doesn’t mean that you are good at the game...
---
Awwhhh yeeaahhhh
---
And because of such great feedback from Discord, I'm definitely making killer and killer/survivor variants of this meme, probably all for tomorrow as the .5 posts.
---
So it begins...
---
Can’t they get sued off this if it causes someone to have a seizure? Pretty good job so far
---
I approve. Post this to

/r dbdgonewild
---
YOU DONT HAVE TO BE! IT’S TO REWARD PEOPLE FOR REACHING IT LMAO
---
I’m sorry, but you’re way too dense for this conversation
---
Um. Yes...
---
Lmao what is this come back?
---
I once had a dude in my lobby, he literally called himself toxic in his username and was a TTV guy. There were two flashlights in the lobby too.
---
I whipped out Legion with Frank’s Mixtape and Cold Dirt. I think you can tell the outcome of the match
---
Literally had this last night. Had an instant dc when they got downed, aaaaaand I got tunneled directly after. At least I got +0 to pips. And then...ranks reset as I was getting off so I didn't hit 8 before season ended. :( how long are these seasons anyway? I never knew but it feels its only a few weeks.
---
What is 'Endgame Collapse'?
---
There's a similar effect with Spirit, aura reading will only show you the aura of her husk, it won't show you where she is if she's invisible.
---
Good for you but look at your flair. Same shit in my opinion.
---
Except you aren't lol.  All the "Good" persk can be taught to others.  You can be busted as shit given enough time.
---
Don't understand these idiots who are scared of some punkass legion
---
I randomly DC'd from 3 survivor games in a row.  Restarted my computer and the DC'ing stopped.  If you have the DC'ing occur in succession like mine, then I'd suggest restarting your computer (restarting the game on Steam did nothing by itself).
---
I would like to keep my keyboards intact.
---
So.. One players skill should be solely based on another's? Seems legit..
---
What’s the survivor?

Join the official dbd discord server and find people there to play

---
You know what's actually crazy? Ace looks EXACTLY like Ricky in the thumbnail.
---
Obviously spending the last 5 mins searching for the ruin totem.
---
Maybe a little of both. The fire makes it very difficult to see survivors because of the lighting adjustment. It's also difficult for the cannibal to use his chainsaw around objects because touching them will cause him to go into a tantrum. He probably couldn't see whether he ran straight or not until he got past the trashcan, but then couldn't turn sharply enough to hit him without hitting the wall.
---
Shouldnt this be from the killers pov?
---
I see a slight resemblance, but 'twas my intention to try and be as similar as possible. 
---
I love TPB and Ace. 
---
GODDAMNIT, I'M FUCKING SHOT AGAIN

A teased new way to speed up endgames. We don’t know what it is yet but I assume it’s an effort to get rid of hatch standoffs and improve 1v1’s.
---
Not lewd enough
---
You know they’re toxic if they’re an Alisa main
---
Could you please pm me how to do that? I really wanna know.
---
Not insulting you at all. The time required to get to rank 3 to be able to kill people is only possible if you fully stalk all players to max. Plus you don't ever get tier 2 so you are at basic speed the entire time. Its exceptionally difficult to get tombstone and get all 4 kills. From personal experience at rank 5+ people normally get 3-4 gens before I even get tier 3.
---
Did you play against it recently ?
---
can only assume the guy never seen a coochie if he thinks it's a good idea to say what he said on pretty much ironic comment that is literally a communist propaganda during Soviet times. bet he thinks communist ideology is starvation and gulag cause that's what memes say.
---
Bruh, they’re good enough to get rank 1. People like that shouldn’t be deranking to face new people. 
---
It’s really simple, but I’m amazed how you don’t see this. Thick skull for sure
---
I'm so proud of this community
---
yep, happened to me several months ago, there is a post somewhere in my profile with a video of it. Bubba is a big boy.
---
&gt;If you have the audacity to put your trashy ttv in your nickname
---
Are you actually okay, you have a lot of anger in you. They just stream to their friends and would like to get a viewer base.
---
Oh okay, well, makes the issue even more apparent
---
The game is not just PC, so the statement that "it's a fact that Nurse is the best killer" is false because she's not the best killer on console.
---
Yes, I saw the rest of that sentence, but that doesn't change that statement being wrong.  IF the optimization passes ever bring up the game so that it's not a slideshow on certain maps, then I might agree with you but it's not just the controller holding back Nurse.  Even if that was the case though, she still wouldn't be the best killer in the game, she would be only the best killer on PC.
---
This one time, I noticed a Claudette t bagging from afar, and she was injured, just watching me go hook her friend
---
I dropped him right by the hook, took my hatchet, and chucked that sucker at her forehead, picked him back up and hooked him and while I hooked him it hit her
---
I’m still mad that I wasn’t looking when it hit, but I didn’t expect it to actually make it with how far she was.
---
Give me shirtless laurie,amanda and its a deal.
---
He needs to have fully picked them up and be mid step
---
Nea 💁🏻‍♀️ but yeah Megs totally *fucking done* dying in the realm.
---
It takes forever to reach it though. Just stay out of LoS to make it harder for him to reach EW3 and you should be good, unless your teammates feed him.
---
I know, I just never let go of a chance to make a funny comment or meme.
---
OINK
---
1. I personally don’t care about what rank you are. But you just proved my point. Wait times are outrageous. If someone on console says that they are waiting almost an hour- that’s a problem. If you think rank actually means something, you’re apart of the problem. 
---
2. 16k isn’t a big base, you do realize that? This game has seen a negative downfall since last year. When did you start playing? The fan base has dropped incredibly due to the lack of support on this game from the creators alone. 
---
3. You named two streamers. Which the only person out of those two who I value their opinion is Tru3. However those two don’t make up the fan base for DbD. 
---
We have to start taking in consideration for the countless console players who get the short hand of the stick when it comes to this game. The lies about optimization. The dedicated servers should NOT have taken this long, and the servers they had on DG would have been of value here. Let’s not forget what happens to games when devs start working on other projects.🙄 
---
That update means nothing to me. I’ll hold my breath, but then I might die from the lack of urgency from the people who pay these devs. Let’s not forget also how the devs acted once they got their money from petty DLC when they fucked up major mid last year. I am all supporting this game. Been playing since release on PC, but the creators need to have their fans back. In return- we will have theirs. But loyalty and word goes a long way.
---
chill out, take some
---
cold dirt
---
....  depending on how you read that, that could go awkward and illegal rather quickly.
---
1. Spine Chill - In my opinion, it's one of the best perks in the game giving you early detection beyond any default terror radius except for Myers in Tier 1. Can't tell you how many times I've been able to silently creep away from a gen and avoid a chase using this.
---
2. We'll Make It - Honestly, I just love being able to heal fast since healing is the number one thing that takes away from doing gens usually.
---
3. Plunderers - It's just really nice for item farming.
---
Oh lol
---
Ahh I see thank you
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Why not
---
If the killer isn't looking... Use it to you advantage. Credit to Noob3.
---
Oh dude, I just came up with a slightly better version. Let me recomment for the joke.
---
" Being able to kill all survivors without an Ebony momento Mori is just ridiculous"
---
Haha yeah how ridiculous......OINK!
---
I assumed Nea but then I remembered Feng had that blue hair cosmetic and got confused haha
---
This... chill, bro. They didn't say nerf and they didn't say anything about the plans.
---
You can stun nurse, but it is really finicky. It won't work if you stun during the blink, so you have to hit her just as she is coming out. With bad ping this simply isn't possible.
---
Is it just me that sees a Kate,Dwight,Feng and pink hair Nea?
---
Sometimes it's hard tho. Especially if they are good at stalking, u won't even know til they hit tier 2
---
Resilience actually makes you vault faster as well, so paired with Spine chill thats 15% faster vaults. It also affects snaping out of it.
---
Tunneling and face camping can be used to get kills. If you take it as an insult when killers try to kill, you should be playing a different game.
---
Yeah, someone already made that joke. But to be fair the pig kill is easier to avoid and is just as rare as a Mikey getting a tombstone from the bloodweb
---
Damn it I read it before reading this lol I feel dumb xD
---
Glad you like them! I'm trying to get them done faster now that I've got a formula down, but some of the testing takes a long time to do.
---
There's no debate. This is fact.
---
...and occassionally shitposting about it, without even playing that much. Yup.
---
Happens to us all. Have a good day sir.
---
Sneaking because the killer aura is scary.
---
Really? Who? Was it that sexy Pig guy?
---
Nah, I find “open exit gate as *survivor*” worse. For coop daily I just take bond+prove thyself, it works pretty well for that.
---
so whats the outplay from a killer that makes you drop to the ground without even hitting you because they can purposefully lose chase?
---
its not that legion needed to be nerfed, they're not even a strong killer. Its the mechanics of the power, what you can exploit with it, and how boring it is to play against thats being changed.
---
LF's benefit is that he has a ridiculously generous "Hitbox" that is basically a fucking football field to the sides of him while he is chainsawing.  With Billy you can bait his bullshit fairly easily but LF can hit you at seemingly random with his saw.  If they made him any faster he should absolutely lose that hitbox.
---
This isn't even counting that LF can down two people at once with his ability so the slow speed is more than made up for by smart camping, which is basically the intended way to play him from just looking at it.
---
The only time that kind of shit is acceptable is if the gates are open and you plan on bodyguarding the survivor you just unhooked. Running BT doesn't do much when the killer is standing next to the survivor getting unhooked. They'll get hit as they touch the ground, and I doubt that Nurse is gonna have much trouble hitting them again. BT is for rescuing from camps, not deliberately farming your teammates.
---
Needs a transparent Billy in the background.
---
True, considering that a majority of internet arguments I see are started by some jerk with an anime pic. Pretty much anyone on the internet or online game network with an anime profile picture is someone you should avoid. Trust me, I’ve had my experiences.
---
Not bad, but there’s a few mistakes in my opinion. Michael can stalk people who come to the hook. Doctor can keeping zapping so unhooking isn’t possible. Billy is really easy to bait the chainsaw.
---
Ride haunted mansion for me. Favorite ride.
---
No...I don't. Being a survivor main I appreciate it. In fact, the problem is you potatoes typically do the opposite and run to one and wait to drop it on the killer just to get your flashlight and don't loop it at all.
---
Nor do I see flashlighting as "insulting." It is simply annoying. If you're going to annoy the guy trying to kill you...then he's probably going to focus on killing you. So either deal with it like a big boy, or quit complaining that someone is being as big of a cock to you as you are to them.
---
I'm not saying bad killer = bad survivor I'm saying Bad killer vs good survivor = can't be a nice play
---
Thankyou so much Peanits. First time I've gotten a response on this for Months. We've actually had this issue before the change as well. I've had DbD for a year and me neither my friends or  any other Sout South Africans I've come across is able to play because the region placement is so out of whack.
---
You should do one where Dwight is popping out of a locker.

Another rank 20 guy who claims to main killer but only uses killer for dailies and is another moron that thinks Mettle Of Man is fine and pre nerf DS was fine too.

---
Your welcome kind stranger who most likely stole this meme

For a sabo build i like to throw on breakdown and if playing in a swf, no mither. Then you can always see each other and know where to go to sabo
---
Breakdown is great if you get hooked for obvious reasons :D
---
You are more than happy to suck my dick. Fuck your condescending and holier than thou attitude.
---
Find me a good photo and sure, it can be added to the list. ;D
---
OH MY GOD LMAO
---
That’s not the point!!!! It’s to keep away poeple who have 200+ hours on the game separated from people who have less than 50!!!! Dude, think for a second!
---
People who want to challenge themselves would play SWF, such as me when I'm trying to improve moreso than have fun. If you think all of my ideas are so terrible I don't see why you even feel the need to come back and leave a reply. I just wanted to express my opinion on a Kill With Friends gamemode and it's devolved into a miniature shitpost.
---
I was just genuinely curious what you thought what kind of video games gays play. I wasn’t trying to bait you or anything. Lol
---
I say let it die!
---
The purpose of the flashlight is identical to pallet stunning a killer to drop your teammate. It's a normal part of gameplay that is rewarded. Deliberately throwing the match by facecamping is punished by the ranking system and by standard gameplay. There is nothing wrong with bringing a flashlight, and and if you get annoyed over standard gameplay, it says a lot more about the killer than the survivor.
---
I hope we'll get new cosmetics for all four of them.
---
My stepbrother just played a game and got a 2 killer, 3 survivor game. He was pig, other killer was Myers, this is a new bug for sure and wondering how in the world this is happening now.
---
Should this be a killer?

im just trying to use up all my items/offerings so i can prestige my david and paired an oak with sabo which would have worked pretty well against mori legion cuz you cant kill if you cant hook lol but he wimped out, tbh im pretty bad and would have still died xD
---
That's... What I meant.
---
I know you can but “I’m Dead Hard” Right now and I would like to “express” myself that way......
---
Literally not angry. 
---
If they want to promote, they should scratch teammate backs too.
---
"His perks allow him to mark survivors for death and execute them without mercy"
---
I took your advice and went up 3 ranks with borrowed time and juking
---
Running detectives hunch with a map (with the add-on that allows teammates to see the auras) is one of my guilty pleasure builds, but every time I try to run it I end up running the killer lol.
---
Pretty sure you just described add ons he has that don’t work
---
Im ugly, but i know how to play dbd
---
1. You go in the subreddit 
---
2. click the 3 dots

3. then click change user flair

4. Choose the one you want
---
5. Yay Im so happy time
---
I didn’t have my save file backed up so he gave me his. I didn’t question it coz I didn’t know what save file hacking was at that point. When I got banned I talked to one of the steam mods who is a mate and they investigated and said that’s what it looks like, he checked his profile after I explained to him what happened and said yep it looks like he was too so I reported him, and one of the steam mods was looking into it. If I was hacking I couldn’t care less if I got banned but where is the fair punishment? Why me for simply taking someone else’s save file because I lost mine and not someone who was actually hacking?
---
Absolutely. Instead of an "Oh shit, the Dream Demon is near me." reaction to Freddy's terror radius, it's meet with groans because now you have to go against the weakest/most annoying killer. 
---
Scratched mirror Myers on Lery's is still terrifying though. It feels like the dam walls are watching your every move.
---
Just jump into a locker
---
I know he gives me slippery meat
---
ilysm ty
---
Both blades? Some people
---
Dude that blue hair, mask wering, weeb looking ass. Is just an instant mori
---
First of all, its not punished by the ranking system, its just not rewarded as much as leaving the hook. You still get points for a face camp. That said, even if it was punished, it doesn't matter. You're not playing against the emblem system, you're playing against someone who doesn't like your obnoxious methodology. Therefore, they are in turn going to use obnoxious methodology to kill you for it. Simple as that. I fail to see why this is so hard for you to comprehend. It is not about the points, its about you being an annoying little piss ant they want out of their way so they can enjoy the game and pursue kills without you jumping out from behind a rock every time they try to pick someone up.
---
Second, flashlighting is not identical to a pallet stun. A flashlight is mobile and can be used at windows, pallets, pick ups, etc. It's an annoying item used to be annoying. If you don't like being focused down for that, then find another way to get points. Because you're literally complaining that you can't be annoying to people without them doing it back to you...
---
Finally, no, there isn't anything wrong with bringing a flashlight. Likewise, there isn't anything wrong with the killer getting your annoying ass out of his game as soon as possible either. Get over it or get better at running.
---
is this a bug or a hack?
---
"Sometime in Spring". Don't hold your breath.
---
Good one
---
What? Doing what? Shopping for clothes? Smearing ketchup on those paper plates with chicken fingers? Just don’t do anything legion.
---
i can never watch someone play a game if its not a turorial to do something or learning tricks to help
---
me in game. I feel jts a waste of time and i
---
could just play the game instead and enjoy
---
it
---
Your first point has little bennefit, billy has a curve which gives him even more control over his chainsaw allowing him to get round obsticles with enough skill.
---
As for your second point it rarely comes into play unless a survivor is in the basement and even then LF needs a perk for it to work well.
---
Yeah, well maybe if survivors didn't BM the killer or constantly quit from a game if they don't like the killer, more people would want to play killer. As it it stands, there just aren't many people playing as a killer anymore because it's just too frustrating with all the disconnects, frame drops, and unnecessary flashlight spamming and teabagging. The end result is what you have now. Long wait times because more and more people are giving up on playing as a killer.
---
Legion = doo doo price me wrong
---
&gt; The grind is part of the game, getting new perks as a new player is always interesting and leaves you wanting for more.
---
&gt; If you think grinding blood webs is tedious and daunting now, well then you haven't seen how it was like back in the vanilla days. Now that was a real grind to 50.
---
That makes it sound like you are already a long time with the game, and thus, as an actual somewhat new player, and without wanting to insult you, let me tell you. You have no idea. 
---
Its not "fun" to unlock them, we arent talking here about the equivalent of unlocking an entirely new character, say, like unlocking an op in siege. These perks are vital core aspects of the game, and some of them are outright mandatory. It isnt like unlocking an op in siege, its as if you had to unlock the op, then again grind the full way to unlock every single tool and weapon, and in the meantime could only use a pistol. And its a looooong way to the unlocks.
---
I play both, survivor and killer. I dont even know where i should begin. On the killer side the games i just get genrushed even if they dont try. I dont have ruin. Seeing 2 repair boxes makes me consider quitting the lobby. Well sure, it could help and save me time if i could spot them easier, lets say, after hooking them, right? Good thing theres BBQ and chili, the mandatory killer perk. Well, not for me. Letherface level 0. As you can guess i still have quite a hard time with those loops, especially with windows, lucky, theres bamboozle - once i unlocked that. Spirit fury for those pallets. Sure, i do have that one! As level 1 on the spirit. Hell, im a noob, no shame in noed i guess, even if its frowned upon. Its not as if id actually catch them 90% of the time. Forget it, dont have it. 
---
And when i say "unlock", dont misunderstand that. Im not talking about unlocking them on my favourite killers. Im talking about *unlocking the teachable*. Because i dont even have them as teachables. I dont have one single teachable unlocked, after 15 hours in the game.
---
On the survivor side im now a Meg main, i figured sprint burst and adrenaline might be among the most important for me to have first, although by now i regret that i didnt go for dead hard as that seems pretty mandatory, but meg is now level 20 and david level 0 and i want at least one of them unlocked maybe anytime somewhat soonish. Would still be great if i could heal myself since nobody at this rank seems to want to heal. Nope. 
---
I have to play the game without its tools. That wouldnt be so bad. If i played with others like that. The thing is, as the facecamping asshole russian meyers (i hope only because of rank reset and not depip) with over 3000 hours and a showcase of this game with almost all achievements unlocked on his profile, could tell you, whom ive met yesterday, i dont. I regularly play with people who have their tools unlocked.
---
Worse, especially on the killer side, since they are unique in their special ability, instead of leveling a killer i like and getting their addons in addition, to exeriment and optimize my gameplay with them, i have to level those i dont enjoy, or at least dont want to play as much just to get their perks. I dont realy enjoy hag, but i need that ruin. I enjoy spirit ever since i managed to down some teabagging survivor at the exit gate who forgot that me ghosting around leaves the "body" behind. But i cant spend anything on her. I have to play her not just with level 1 default perks only, but also without any experimenting with addons. Cause i still need that ruin, and then i definitely need bbq next.
---
Aww did someone have a bad legion experience? 😟 maybe you can offer your blankie and salt at the next trial.

I would argue Jeff is better!

---
Hemophobia definitely. Shocking treatment was a bit hard too
---
Yeah it's a little shitty how being a good Survivor can sometimes fuck up other teammates or the general flow of the game.
---
I'm pretty sure r/dbdgonewild has *looooads* of this, if not more.
---
You learn to work through it. Often times you save more time working though it than you do looking for it.
---
If they can’t reliably hit skill checks, tell them to aim for good (not great) and let go of the gen while it’s sparking. They can still get skill checks during the time it’s sparking even though they won’t earn any repair progress on it and regress it even further.
---
Try to farm with the killer. If you play on ps4 I have a big tip that can help you, just say something and I’ll help you
---
XdxDxaDxdxdx
---
And when I play survivor during RR I get called a bully for looping all game. It’s fun, but I feel bad.
---
....said the guy complaining about getting face camped for using a flashlight lol. 
---
But yeah, they aren't annoying at all! As long as the killer brings his handy dandy wall with him to every down he gets! Of course, that doesn't stop any of the other times where he is stuck in animation and cannot avoid the blind...But they should be totally unphased! Because all killers are experienced killers! And they automatically have all perks on all killers as well! That's just how it works, right?! YAYYYYY ENTITLEMENT!
---
You're dumb. Being such the grizzled veteran of the fog you so clearly are, you should probably have already realized that you're going to get face camped for being annoying and you have no right to bitch about it. It's common sense.
---
Btw, face camping is also used for a legitimate purpose. The purpose of getting you and your little toy out of the game. Enjoy it, because you're inviting 90% of it
---
And when you walk in, you’ll find the Clown looking for Ashy Slashy.
---
Sorry to be annoying can you tell me what these builds excel in
---
:'v
---
Uww
---
They linked their deviant art account, they got one for each killer

Getting Over It
---
I don't know if you've ever played killer,  but you get a quitter bonus under the brutality scoring event when people leave early. Plus you as a survivor lose two pips...  And get reported if it's in my lobby.

---
It's funny to see people scrambling to keep their argument going. Even if it is deadass wrong. I think it gets really bad as Spirit because her power is already mindfuckery enough so a lot of accusations are thrown when I play Spirit, even when they can see my build at the end of the game or something.
---
Game is now banned in China
---
I never just watch a rando person playing. Most of the streamers, specifically the fog whisperers, are really good and you can learn a lot by how they play and the small, subtle things they do.
---
But then again, I just love observing things. Like lizards. I could watch them all day, barely moving, seemingly doing nothing, and still learn something.
---
Well now that's just unfair.
---
Perfect! Hope to see you out there! I’ll tbag before I DC too. Even better if I have a purple flashlight to click click. 
---
How are those reports going BTW?
---
dammit Claudette, not again
---
See? Complaining about how the DBD developers add new things and dont fix the current bugs really works!
---
So don't you stop complaining guys! Complaining is the best way to make things get fixed! :)
---
That's actually the only part I understand. I have no idea who the dude is, why he has a body pillow and who that person is in the background.
---
Never seen the Dwight ass one, but I never knew I needed it until now

Would be cool but BhVR won’t do that because they don’t wanna be showed up by a bunch of people who know what they are doing and make the game work better then they ever could!

All I know is try to fake and make her blink aimlessly so I can keep putting distance, NEVER heal in heart beat, and Tires are my best friend.  Lol
---
I'm just tired of seeing the word NOED on this subreddit so much. I must have read it like 150,000,000 times by now. Including the shitty half assed template memes about NOED. Those infuriate me.
---
I misread a perk I NEVER use and I almost never play killer. sue me
---
I took the correction and apologized. What more do you want.
---
the last hit of bubba chainsaw doesn't do damage anyways so just running forward at the end would have done the same thing except adam would be further so he wouldnt have gotten hit at the end as easily
---
The ranking system in dbd doesn’t effect the match making hard as many on this sub-reddit can tell you hell I’m a rank 7 killer and had 6 games in a row against red ranks, I know rank has a purpose in most games not in dbd it does nothing
---
Yeah I didn’t realize the perk was changed, I never use it and barely play killer anymore.
---
I feel like the middle one was put there just so perfectly
---
Bruh
---
Those are the good kind of medkit Julian, eight bucks!
---
I like your idea, but yah throw in 9 gens, 8 survivors and 2 killers with no hatch and let the games begin. But if your hit by 1 killer, he can only hit you again and hook you, the other killer won’t be able to touch you until unhooked. That would put a twist on the game. Watch killers fight over hitting survivors!
---
I hope they'll be crossplay for Xbox and the future Switch port (don't ask)
---
I wish
---
F*** yeah let’s hope they don’t forget about it
---
I think ur monitor’s busted my guy
---
I personally don’t care for Telltale games. It’s a biased opinion.
---
I never said they're equivalent. I said it's a common sense result. And yes, your point is made. You don't like something. So what? They clearly don't like you being obnoxious....so what?
---
It's "bad practice..." Says who? You? Survivors? The unofficial rule book of DbD? Why is it bad practice? Because its not fun for YOU? But getting blinded every pallet and window is fun for the killer? What makes it any worse than you being annoying to them? The emblem system? Who cares! It's a meaningless system.
---
The only reason the emblem system is the way it is is because in a hypothetically given game, 4/5 people would complain about a face camp whereas 1/5 would complain about a flashlight ruining their experience.
---
Why should a killer care that they aren't being fair or fun for a survivor that is intentionally trying to annoy them? 
---
I don't like a face camp anymore than anyone else, but it happens. When it happens to someone using a flashlight, I tend to laugh because I don't blame them at all. It's one shitlord shitlording another shitlord.
---
How right was this guy? That Huntress theme is dope. 👍
---
mad child alert, fuck off idiot

There should be a 'dont unhook' button

#fREADY
---
False sense of security
---
Just remember us when you're famous
---
These are my opinions on everything you said.  
---
Aftercare: Not too bad, but I kinda feel like Aftercare has its own niche..
---
which is to mainly save ppl who just got off hook
---
Alert: Is already extremely strong, what does a killer do every game..kick
---
gens, knowing where he is all game due to the constant killer action of kicking
---
gens is useful, mainly for stealthy survivors.
---
AutoDiDact: Could work, but apply it only to healing maybe? 
---
Boil Over: Good Idea, maybe a 10% increase, and keep the wiggle effects now
---
instead..your idea would be broken.
---
Bond: Is already a fantastic perk, it lets you know how to play smart..its like
---
one of the best info perks in the game
---
Borrowed Time: Would be broken with ur suggestion, its fine now..Its kind of a
---
high tier perk
---
Breakdown: This perk has fucked me over when i play killer at times even as
---
someone who tunnels, this perk is fine.
---
Buckle up: Would be broken, theres no counterplay to this perk idea, and it
---
is a fine info perk if you generally get to the last two survivors with a 
---
killer who slugs, niche but it has a purpose.
---
Dark Sense: No, it should only be the survivor but should apply the aura
---
reading when any gen is completely than when its specifically you who finished
---
it.
---
Deja Vu: Is a great perk, if your running it you wont be 3 gen lockedowned..
---
its so nice.
---
Deliverance: Its balanced.
---
Detectives Hunch: This perk has helped me find ruin plenty of times, its fine
---
how it is.
---
Diversion: Yeah should be shorter and should start with one
---
Flip-Flop: Would be broken, 50% is pretty balanced generally youll get off.
---
Head-ON: Fine, maybe removed the 3 second requirement.
---
Hope: This perk is extremely underrated, it is a nice perk and has saved my
---
skin multiple times, this perk allows you to make so much distance esspecially
---
with adrenaline..you are getting that door open definately due to the time
---
saved by the speed boost. Also showing the hatch as an effect on a perk would
---
be broken, hatch already favors survivor.
---
Kindred: Its a fine information perk, and mainly shines during solo-queue
---
if they are camping you can use this to just focus on gens and get out as
---
the killers stands baiting them to catch you off-guard
---
Left Behind: way to high of a speed boost, i suggested rework would be to give 
---
an incremental repair bonus increasing for each survivor killed.
---
Mettle of Man: Its bugged, itll effect high tier killers soon.
---
No Mither: nah no mither as a rework should be starting healthy then when
---
injured get the no mither effects, but only get the no mither icon when you
---
pick yourself up
---
No one left behind: this would just become baby borrowed time.
---
Open-Handed: I agree
---
Poised: Its fine how it is, but a different perk having that effect would be
---
trippy and I couldnt tell how broken of balanced it would be.
---
Premonition: too strong, this perk is more of an alternative to spine chill
---
Resilience: maybe 12% instead of 15%
---
Slippery Meat: Honestly this perk should just increase luck for escape the hook
---
Small Game: is fine how it is, even though i dont like this perk existing 
---
mainly due to NOED being ridiculous and this perk existing make people believe
---
running this perk is effective at all, which it isnt.
---
Solidarity: maybe 75%
---
Stake Out: Nah just make the max amount you can aquire higher.
---
Streetwise: 50% would be ridiculous, this could be like vigil but for items
---
This is not happening: Remove making the greats bigger, maybe give an increase
---
to the bonus greats give that stacks everytime you hit a great until you get
---
downed. it would reward ppl who learn to hit greats.
---
Technician: is more for new players to be honest, have it as 100% would be
---
ridiculous
---
Tenacity: Is fine, its a niche perk not all perks can be super game changing
---
Up the Ante: is fine for early game looting cuz better luck means better items
---
Unbreakable: This perk is game changing, and decently balanced.
---
Vigil: is a nice perk, kinda underrated.
---
Wake up: 300% is way too fast, the 15% speed it is now, is really noticeable
---
its just not a good perk bcuz its situational cuz you might not be able to
---
get on a door
---
Were gonna live forever: is a bloodpoint perk, a damn good one at that, its
---
good to reduce the games grind.
---
Windows of opportunity: I agree, there shouldnt be a cooldown.
---
Yes Legion is bullshit but I don't think at any moment disconmecting is justified, unless suddenly something comes up in real life or internet cut/game crash. Even if he's the shittiest character to grace this game I will sit through any match with Legion as survivor and brace it because I usually believe not all the Legions I go against are assholes who "only deserve DC". I am surprised this is acceptable behaviour from the community.
---
Chill out dude! Some of us are stuck behind trees? Sheesh! It's just a game,
---
Because of Clown? Uww
---
Shroud of separation?
---
One survivor will get 1000 BP for cleansing it, the equivalent of 20 good skill checks. You're taking BP from the team and giving them all to whoever finds the hex.
---
Hex: Lottery
---
I remember when I played a game with this Meg who only saboed hooks and literally didn't save anyone or did any gens and everyone died and she got the hatch. I was so fucking pissed.
---
Gaming's most ambitious crossover
---
Everybody would Insta buy it uww
---
It worries me, to be perfectly honest. I don't want to possibly lose Freddy's aura-reading or built-in stall in the process of helping him get better.
---
No the algorithm for match making is just broken. They have acknowledged that in patch notes and the dev update. The ranking system was technically never supposed to be looked at as a competitive ladder. 
---
The ranks are at the bare minimum there for balance. We don’t put fresh newbie Rank 20’s in a solo que against a Rank 1 with 2000+ hours played, right? That’s the main purpose, it’s skill levels at the least. Most games have it, like Overwatch. You don’t have to play in competitive but the game take into account your skill levels to match you in quickplay. That’s what DBD really needs, a more transparent “ranking” system. Real ranked for serious players, and quick play. People just don’t seem to get that the ranking system is there to ensure balanced play. And like I said with matchmaking having issues it of course is broken and doesn’t matter.
---
I have it recorded on Xbox, if my monitor was broken, the clip would be normal, but its not. If you dont believe me check the clip of FuriousPanda134 on Xbox.
---
If only it went abit longer
---
call the health department
---
I solo played with a Legion and my team got him to DC by us all escaping.
---
Except legion isnt a great killer. he’s just broken. Mechanicaly. The fact you quit months ago is showing
---
Yea but surely you knew orasked what characters he had prestiged and knew you didn’t have the same? It just seems kind of shitty to accept it then report them after you willingly took the save file. Whether he hacked it or not you still took a save you knew was “better” than yours. It just seems childish to want someone else to get “punished”, especially someone you called a friend.
---
Wish I did. It was a busy time of year for me :/
---
Id smash
---
What's a Claudette? Never seen that.
---
popular demand, thats why its in the game. ppl wanted it, and they gave ppl what they wanted. its just the way the game was designed.   
---
People ruining the game at all is bad, and you doing a swf can ruin a killers experience and again this is coming from someone who plays in swf's. Pipping as killer is alot harder than it is for survivor, a single dc makes a killer depip, i depipped from a game where 2 survivors didnt connect, but the two survivors pipped.  
---
im not saying swf is terrible remove it, but if i know that yall are giving each other information and applying that info to increase efficiency, before i have a chance to get anything done, that ruins the experience for me, so if i suspect a swf ima gonna dodge it.   
---
I also dont tunnel or camp, so if they have more info to increase efficiency and it forces me to tunnel ppl, i dont wanna play that kinda match
---
Very true, and that is exactly why experienced huntress players don’t run the gloves and Iron Maiden, however the knowledge of fast reload times allows for newer huntress players to go for more risk : reward shots.
---
Don't even worry about it, we're all here for fun and nothing more.

God,are you really this sentimental over a video game character?

Holy shit dude it’s in my favorite color as well. I fucking love you man.
---
What survivor in their right mind would use an offering for the game :|
---
Seriously. I looped a pig for like 4 gens and couldnt even feel good about it because i was like watch her be like rank 16 or something and she was. I was like ahh man, sorry piggy :(
---
Allow her to violate me, a little church boy

Especially with the shitty matchmaking even when I play at my normal rank (4-8) I still get matched with new killers. I just played a rank 20 Myers with nothing but play with your food ffs.
---
Am i the only one bothered by this? She just made a giant scientific discovery and her picture is being used as a meme with Homoerotica? Thats just degrading
---
I also got platinum and my toughest one would have been the 3 blinks grab as nurse but survivors helped me with it. 
---
The Adept Nurse took a lot of practice as well. That was probably the most full skill non cheese one involved.

You’re so pure.

Thank you for the free points, and pips. God bless.

I never said I didn't understand why they slug.  It doesn't make anything about what I said about the experience any less true.  You're still holding their game hostage for several minutes and it is severely unfun.  I'm actually a killer main believe it or not and because of the fact I play survivor too I know how painfully unfun it is so I choose not to play that way as killer.  I feel killers feel entitled to a 4k when they slug and lose sight of how bullshit it is to do this to the other side.  Also at worst a 3K will be a safety this new pip system isn't nearly as oppressive as you're describing.  The only way you're depipping on a 3K is if you camped which no offense you don't deserve to pip anyways.  And I don't hang around afterwards.  That's the point, I'm not going to be forced to lay on the ground I'm queuing into my next game.  If they get it they get it.

I'm an atheist and I don't go to church so... I'm saved!

---
Puke on me, Vommy Mommy
---
In all fairness if i juke a killer for 5 gens and hes rank 20 it doesnt mean much. Doesnt make me good
---
No I took a save because i lost everything I already had which was a lot (I just didnt prestige people) and no it didn’t occur to me because the save file hacking wasn’t being talked about yet because this was at the start of the bug and people weren’t getting banned yet. So no it didn’t even occur to me to be worried about people being prestige, even if it was ever so slightly better than my own account, like I said I just didn’t prestige people but I had all of my perks, I was not gonna grind for them back. And how is it childish to expect someone who was hacking to be banned when I got banned for just trying to get my stuff back? And my friend was aware of the fact that he had hacked and he was aware of the consequences if they saw I suddenly had prestige 2 and 3 achievements and still did it anyway. So how’s that fair?
---
That Myers is a Spy!
---
I mean it’s not like it’s that big of the problem anyways imo. Most deranking people derank to like rank 7 maximum to get faster queues and variety of killers
---
The people who downvote the post know its true (o‿∩)
---
thats not a trail, that an execution.
---
I didn't realise it was a joke. Could you explain?
---
Will do. I really don’t play killer and when I do it’s mostly for challenges. But I do want to get better at it. Thanks for the tip!
---
I'm still hoping that the Legion changes are more than just minor things. I really wish they felt more like a Legion. Make each one more unique. Make them feel like a Legion. Give them a slightly altered power. It doesn't need to be major, just different.
