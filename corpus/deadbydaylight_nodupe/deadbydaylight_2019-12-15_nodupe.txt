Hopefully the same thing happens to NOED. They make some stupidly simple tweak like 'cleansing a dull totem gives a notification to all other survivors similar to the hex-totem cleanse'.
---

---
Then, just like Decisive Strike, Mettle of Man, and every other item on that list, everyone goes, "Wait, why were some people vehemently defending the old way like it was a core aspect of the game?"
---
---
---
Fremandabillyhag isn't real, it can't hurt you
---
/\\
---
Thanks *le sigh* and I agree with you on that
---
Don't forget Camaraderie which halts the struggle phase for up to 34 seconds once a survivor is within 16 metres of your hook
---
Second, even forgot I was in queue once and still didn't get one
---
I think what they mean is on PS4 the trophy sections got split after Stranger Things was added. Now when you go into the trophies there is section 1/2 where almost everything is and then section 2/2 which currently has Stranger Things and Curse Legacy trophies.
---
Killer and surv ranks are independent, he could have poured BP into killers to get the perks without ever playing them,  I‚Äôve only played 2 games as killer but have bbq and ruin on pretty much all of them
---
I wouldn‚Äôt run a build using anything like that at rank 20 though just seems cruel
---
I'm on ps4 too and I think I've played with you before
---
Nurse yeah, Huntress not as much. I've faced a couple of pretty damn good Huntresses on console. Like, they hit almost every hatchet, makes me think they main her, too. And there's very few that can do that.
---
EDIT: Now that I remember, there might be one or two people on here that are actually console Huntress mains....so yeah. They exist. Only that they are an endangered species...but still...thats the only reason why I dont underestimate her
---
&gt;Can we be real here with the amount of effort that is actually needed?  
---
I wouldnt call that polite. And $10 would be fair. If I was selling it unpainted... I'd like to see you spend time on shit like this and then sell it for pennies. I spend hours each day, *after* my full time job, working on this shop. Not worth the effort for a hundred bucks or so a week. If I spend x amount of my free time filling people's orders, I need to make x amount of dollars. $10 for an hour long paint job. Plus materials, electricity, time... I dont think so. This isnt China.
---
Fungoose. He‚Äôs plays all killers but is really good with Bubba. He should have a lot of bubba vids on YT
---
r/PerkByDaylight
---
Oh my. It appears that the hook has summoned another spider!
---
That's never going to happen. Devs have stated that they don't really want killers to speak. Plague's Mori notwithstanding. Otherwise Freddy would be calling people bitches when he hits them.
---
I definitely think it‚Äôs better but still could use some tweaks.
---
Really?! üòÅüòÅ We should play again sometime!!!
---
R on PC.
---
Doc laughs histericly at sight of patients going insane
---
Same, I thought this was me for second, but it isn‚Äôt cuz I didn‚Äôt find the survivor, I wasted about 50 seconds hitting the locker the time that I did it lol
---
I probably ran into you as killer, but I'm always down to play with people. just let me know ‚ò∫
---
I still play him, he is amongst my favourites along with Myers, Spirit and sniper Doc
---
Ghostface trumps him because in tier 2-3 you have a terror radius. While gf has zero terror radius while cloaked and can instadown survivors without increasing his terror radius. Mike has to go through tiers 1-3 to be able to imstadown. Also once you stalked someone with myers you cant stalk them again whereas gf gets unlimited stalk. 
---
Also think about speed in tier 1 mm is slow af, where as gf hes not as slow while cloaked.
---
It's not there
---
While it does, it doesn‚Äôt buy as nearly as much time as before. Now, they can wait till last second to mend, because that decreases the risk of legion being able to use his frenzy and learn where you are.
---
I'll just let them unhook while I go pressure a gen if I'm in a good mood, but any Survivor that actually puts that in their rule book is a baby even to other babies.
---
What killer do you main? And you can add me on PS4 if you want. Same username w/ 92 on the end
---
Working as intended
---
 In general don't give up at the first hook (even if you just started the trial and got caught in 10 seconds). Remember chasing/hooking/killing is a main component of the game so instead of trying to avoid it completely, take your partial wins. Even just juking the Killer two or three times and prolonging the chase is a huge time gain for your team. Even though it's gonna feel AWESOME when you finally truly disappear in a chase and win it, remember that stalling for time is still a fundamental boon for the team
---
Also be wary of what the Killer knows about your whereabouts. From the perspective of the hook, when you're rescued, don't always go to your first idea of a hiding place or escape route. Whatever is obvious the Killer will check so try to really suss out options while you're hanging
---
Is that a... Warframe?
---
I used to main spirit and wraith, but know I'm just switching between all of them. and alright. I'll add ya
---
I got my first hatch given to me on my 500th hour of playing, was pretty nice I got an achievement as well
---
Doing this just basically decreases the chance of surviving on the hook for next time, so to me thats kinda pointless. Perks seem to take a while to get, and getting a specific one just to extend my playtime sounds a bit off.
---
I dont know, its obviously a 'me' problem. Ive been trying to like this game cause its concept and atmosphere is really well done but the game seems to love taking playtime away from me for the sake of feeling underpowered
---
Wait DBD is on mobile now ?!
---
You still need to mend, you either mend or run around to stop the timer so for 12 seconds that survivor isnt on a gen. Yeah, the reduced timer was a straight up nerf. DW was always shit, only new players would go down to that shit.
---
I guess
---
I know sometimes people think you‚Äôre camping when you‚Äôre trying to place a trap as hag but you didn‚Äôt even try to place a trap.  It‚Äôs annoying to try to place a trap near a hooked survivor, step forward, step back, step side, repeat.
---
yeah!
---
bc built in wallhacks, why else? they also run bbq and sometimes nurses to make sure the game is faceroll and remove all skill and fun of hiding and searching. add in the fact that he is fast as fuck and the shitty pallet / vault hitboxes and this game is literally free 4ks.
---
Its just a shame that the people who program the game are too stupid to do their jobs yet the animators are always on top of their game.
---
Nothing. I think it was a group of friends so they just acted like that
---
Unless that last rank reset change changed this, you can derank past 15 from rank reset. If it is changed, then he couldve just not played for a while before that change
---
Yeah there isn't really much you can do in terms of going to a hook, Having people destroy and body block are your best bets
---
Yes on Xbox! That‚Äôs happened to me a lot of time too.
---
Yeah he is worse than ghostface or Pig, but for different reasons and he is still good.
---
Ghostface:
---
* Best Stealth in the game
---
* Still can instadown with his stalk
---
* Can T-bag
---
Pig:
---
* Better Stealth than Myers (especially with Whispers)
---
* Traps are inherent slowdown
---
* Ambush lunge can help on loops
---
Myers:
---
* Small terror radius, but is loud and tall
---
* Best snowball game
---
* Gets Looped
---
I dislike the new map too. It's literally impossible yo find survivors if they have more than 1 braincell and are hiding
---
This is as funny as it is accurate
---
There are all kinds of mounts on thingiverse.com. I just made a ceiling mount actually for someone Haha let me grab the link  
---
Edit: [ceiling mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4047184) it's basically the same thing, but stretched and twisted a bit
---
*Bubba has left the chat*
---
&gt;I need an enthusiast with a smile who actually taunts and makes jokes of survivors
---
Freddy is literally right there. He'd speak in canon, but can't in-game (just like any other killer).
---
just not fun to play legion..
---
Reboot Freddy still made jokes, they were just not the type of funny that we're used to from Freddy.
---
But survivors are not powerless, they are very good and annoying
---
Are those, drum chunks?
---
Because it's annoying to the killer to be trying to walk and help you and have you incessantly wiggling, trying to stun them and get 'grasp escape', and it leads to people who say "GGEZ Killer, you walked right past a hook" thinking that they escaped because the killer was bad.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You wiggle, you get hooked, you don't have to like it; but look at this entire thread and any other thread and you'll see most of the community is okay with it and accepts wiggle = no mercy.
---
Sometimes you actually do have to go with the established crowd, this is one of those times.
---
No! BNP was BROKEN BEYOND BELIEF
---
I've seen it in-game, but popular on Reddit when this is where we chill is enough for me.
---
I've had plenty of killers testing to see if I'm going to wiggle at all, had a Billy 'stutter stepping' and generally dicking around near the hatch for like 20-30 seconds before letting me have it when we had one disconnect-on-first-down and one immediate suicide-on-first-hook, it was a little tilting, but not wiggling for mercy is okay, wiggling makes carrying you to the hatch harder.
---
I like it a lot and I think it's fucking fire üî•
---
It didn't take an hour to paint that and you can't convince me otherwise. Grey krylon spray paint, some splatter and a few strokes of red and yellow in the middle. Brown lights. Especially for something that small. 20 minutes at most and the majority of that time is waiting for the spray paint to dry enough to get tacky before you drip brown and black paint on it. 
---
Idk about you but when I'm in the shop I'm only getting paid or paying as a customer for time worked not time waiting.
---
Your wait times are not labor times.
---
Damn 500th hour! No one gave you it before that holy shit
---
Definitely not ages ago, I got deranked past 15 like 2 months ago since i hadnt played survivor in 3-4 months beforehand from red ranks. But yeah probably either of those
---
No. I play normal because if they're good I'll get wrecked and if they're bad I try to encourage them by giving them some action so they won't quit. I want more Nurses and Huntresses
---
Hes mad cuz he was working on that gen for a while. Another one was close by, and another ~20m away was another surv working on the last gen. So I was going back n forth for a few minutes. Trapped tf outta that entire space too hah  
---
You can actually see the last surv (cuz of bbq) walk away from the other gen at the end of the clip
---
This would still happen even with it.
---
These Time Traveller posts, I swear! :'D
---
New killer: Joker 
---
Power "we live in a society" you can hide inside lockers and catch survivors by suprise. You can also teleport to any other locker but the Survivors will either  hear a small joke or your laugh doing so. After teleporting to a locker you need to wait 30 seconds before you can hide inside it again. 
---
When the Joker is in a chase longer then 20 seconds he can press the ability button which makes him throw a laugh grenade, survivors who are inside the laugh grenade AOE will suffer the hinder effect for 15 seconds and laugh out loud.
---
"How about another joke, Murray?" -The Joker 
---
Joker got 3 teachable perks:
---
Last laugh: survivors inside your terror radius will suffer the blindness effect for 10/15/20 seconds and will also have a 13/14/15 penalty speed on healing, sabotage, repair. "HAHAHA" -Joker
---
Insane: Every time a survivor repair the gen furthest away from you its aura will be highlighted in yellow for 5/6/7 seconds. "I just hope my death make for cents than my life" -Joker
---
Peek-a-boo: Every time you hit a survivor your Terror radius is heard all over the Map for the next 10/15/20 seconds. Every time you Hook a survivor your Terror radius is decreased to 0 for 14/16/18 seconds. "If you're good at something, never do it for free" -Joker
---
Why don‚Äôt you hide in the basement????? TOXIC. 
---
Nah you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, it was sods law that the other survivor came back when you casually came to see. This game has a lot of that!
---
I hope you forgot the /s. There's a very good reason why voice comms are not in this game.
---
Your wish is my command hold up
---
True. But I feel like itd be less often. The path of least resistance and all
---
So everything that happened in this video is anti-toxic?
---
Survivors tend to prioritize unhooks rather than generators. It is a valid (albeit niche) strategy, with perks supporting it, counterplay to it, and a reason to do it. It is not toxic, it is not mean, it is simply a strategic decision that can often net you extra kills, even in red ranks. No amount of complaining will remove it from the game, you can't even technically do it anymore as there is more than one side you can pull people off of hooks from. I advise you to do gens, and have a good day.
---
Even after the nerf, he's still good. Kinda just shrugged the nerf arrow off
---
It‚Äôs not so bad on the switch but I‚Äôm a low level player (15-18) and everyone seems to be keen to make a rescue. So keen, in fact, we sometimes [have a party in the basement. ](https://twitter.com/allaboutsplat/status/1192554250007531520?s=21) .
---
Also lets your team see your aura and power the gates faster
---
It's not just the killer but the other suvivors aswell. I knew there was something fishy when I realized that some survivors had 70h+ on steam while the killer had purple ruin while fixing the gens. But for new players things like these might just be disheartening.
---
Actually yes lol
---
Literally no-clipping through everything is a great power if you know how to Nurse and aren't me, somehow picking the wrong camera angle and moving 2 meters with a full blink despite not looking at the ground.
---
There's nothing about no-clipping through every single fucking thing to land right on a survivor for an absolutely free hit that cannot be denied, and then just doing that again, that is "not a power role"; she's easily the most lethal killer with any decent amount of practice.
---
Oh my god I need this
---
NOED is already bad, just not knowing you have exposed until you get hit is the only strength
---
so true.. i always hope they add a feature to disable that clip ... or at least make it less loud
---
PS Plus is what you need to be able to play games online and DbD is multiplayer only. You can get a one year subscription to PS Plus for $60 and with it you get two free games every month, usually one AAA game and one other game. It's totally worth it as for that $60 you get 24 free games throughout the year. Also the game only gets more expensive if you choose to buy cosmetics or new killers which is totally not required to enjoy it. The edition you're talking about comes with a lot of good killers already so unless you want to you would never have to pay another dime into it. It is also one of the most fun games I have ever played so I think it is totally worth it to try out.
---
As previously mentioned each struggle unless luck add-ons or perks are used will have a 4% chance of success. You can only attempt this 3 times as each attempt will remove around 33% of the timer for the first phase. 
---
Each hook phase lasts 60 seconds meaning if you are hooked then it will take 120 seconds for you to fully die on the hook if no one comes to save you and you do not attempt to struggle. This can be extended with perks like Camaraderie but otherwise It cannot.
---
If you want some good perks for increasing your chance of survival, try to get Decisive Strike and/or Deliverance.
---
Decisive Strike gives you a 60 second timer after being unhooked. During that 60 seconds, if the killer tried to pick you up you will receive a skill check which if you succeed will allow you to escape the killers grasp and stun the killer for 5 seconds. Its deactivated after being used. Amazing perk for preventing tunneling while also providing you an immunity to being picked up by the killer meaning you can do bold actions like work on a gen next to a killer.
---
Deliverance activates after you safely unhook another survivor (Unhook a survivor and have them not be downed by the killer after 8ish seconds). Once activated, it gives you a 100% chance to escape via struggling during the first hook phase allowing you to escape the hook by yourself. Very good when combined with Decisive and very easy to use. This will help improve your chances of survival while also reducing the need for your team mates to save you.
---
How are these abominations created?!?
---
Yea but apparently not in the USA? I can‚Äôt get it to pop up for me. Irritating but I mean I guess I don‚Äôt wanna throw my phone everytime I get face camped so win win I guess?
---
So you're okay with letting the first person you happen to find in the trial suffer simply because you play a game to stand still for two minutes?  I don't know man.  I think it's extremely inconsiderate and I know it won't be removed, I just wish more face camping killers realised how they affect other people's fun
---
Yes
---
fuck no
---
Yeah you didnt play for a really long time thats why
---
&gt;You wait 15 minutes or more in a lobby and then you get a game and you end it in a third of the time. Like where the hell is the fun in that? 
---
This. What's the point of going intio a match if you're just going to end it in five minutes? That also doesn't grant you a whole lot of BP, either, for either side.
---
Adrenaline procs if you do your job as a survivor and accomplish your objectives. NOED procs if you fail as a killer and need a consolation prize for refusing to practice proper technique. Both are crutches, but NOED  is worse
---
It's the bell curve, around those ranks is camper/tunneler zone.
---
I kind of need this
---
According to one guy who messaged me "you could at least try and kill someone else" as the exit gates were open and I was able to down and hook him before he could get to the door
---
Well, I can only speak for myself, but I hear the heartbeat throughout the whole 8 seconds
---

That's totally what I said ya donkey üòÇüòÇ‚ò†

*WAZZUP time stops*
---
What... why are you being upvoted? You seriously think he doesn‚Äôt know what that means? It‚Äôs a joke. The weekend Reddit is cancer.
---
Imma quote Endstille, creator of the video showcasing how you can force multiple double blinks just by running in a straight line. ‚ÄúHonestly it is way too effective for how braindead easy it is to run in a straight line. This has nothing to do with skill.‚Äù. 
---
Let me quote  Edgarpoop as well, who was adamant on the PTB forums against the basekit nerf, ‚ÄúThe cooldown actually does the opposite of what non-Nurse players think it does. Instead of requiring more skill, it necessitates more guess work and devalues mechanical skill because there is no correct blink anymore in LOS break situations, just guesswork.‚Äù
---
Or maybe l, to sum up the discourse about Nurse, should just quote KuromiStarwind: 
---
‚ÄúSo. Red ranks. Low pickrate. Low killrate. Unfun. All the hallmarks of a killer that is underperforming and certainly one that has been overly nerfed.
---
BHVR: We're not going to do anything about the Nurse.
---
Yeah. Who cares about the countless people that have given great feedback, arguments and tried to explain things. Heck, even the stats you guys love so much point to all of these things. Let me guess: there's 40 other variables at play for why the Nurse is where she is currently. After all, statistics only matter when you want them to matter.‚Äù. 
---
But the stats mattered when it was Spirit. The stats mattered when it was Freddy. Suddenly now it‚Äôs Nurse, and now the stats only stopped mattering when they suggested she‚Äôs not a S++++ tier killer. 
---
I suggest you look at the feedback people are giving and actually listen. Watch Endstilles video. Listen to what people are saying instead of returning to this bullshit ‚ÄúSHE STILL IGNORES WINDOWS AND PALLETS SO SHE OP‚Äù
---
I got bumped to 17 from 13 this week
---
U forgot the ass
---
I gotcha lol. Yeah that would make sense, I can probably test it myself next reset since i havent been playing much recently
---
That would be way to op as if they hunter had a ranged attack and a giant burst of speed that applies deep wounds she would be one of the best killers
---
the fuck does this mean
---
lol awesome
---
nice u made her look not so fat :)
---
Well huntress doesnt always hit too, and legion is trash atm.
---
it would turn them into the casual street robber!
---
do u do like the charge and then attack
---
It‚Äôs also probably something to due with the bug on spirit rn. She doesn‚Äôt get a speed boost out of power anymore. So if you run through her and away, it‚Äôs really difficult for her to adjust to where you ran.
---
he's 2010 version which is more serious. Too bad
---
I played since release and saw 4 man swf with insta gens, infinite bus cheese and self care+we'll make it=self heal in under 2 seconds.
---
Also vacuums, this game has come a long way.
---
&gt; Face camping is a toxic play style.
---
Toxic is the specific actions that harm another person **with no greater objective**.
---
You said it yourself, face camping is a tactic. It is effective in certain situations, less effective in other situations... But it is still a tactic.
---
A killer using a tactic, regardless of it‚Äôs effectiveness, isn‚Äôt toxic.
---
Unfun? Sure. Unfortunate for the guy on the hook? Sure. But it‚Äôs not toxic.
---
If you‚Äôre going to say that the killer needs to be concerned about the fun and enjoyment of the survivors, and if he‚Äôs not he is toxic - Then survivors are toxic when they use tactics the killer doesn‚Äôt find fun and enjoyable.
---
And that argument is wholly incorrect. Your opponent is not toxic for trying to win the game. Survivors aren‚Äôt toxic for using DS or BT or doing gens, and killers aren‚Äôt toxic for using NOED or camping or tunneling.
---
So long as the player is striving for a greater objective (winning), then they aren‚Äôt toxic.
---
I watched this without sound and legit thought dedicated servers were this bad
---
Yeah but good huntress usually will hit and legion would be op with the ranges attack
---
Plus you still hear the phasing sound in her terror radius. 
---
Maybe it was bc I have IW3 but I was able to throw off almost every Spirit I played against.
---
&gt;EGC
---
Equipment Grounding Conductor?
---
PC
---
Anyone else get this new speedhack bug? Its fucking hilarious but happened to me twice in 2 days. Idk what triggers it other than getting unhooked but you just have superspeed for the rest of the match and it doesn't stop. Kinda don't wanna get banned tho
---
You might consider that each side may have the same **percentage** of toxic individuals.
---
If 25% of killers are toxic, you‚Äôll get 1 toxic killer every 4 games.
---
If 25% of survivors are toxic, you‚Äôll get 1 toxic survivor every game.
---
Same percentage, very different experiences per game.
---
By the way he only had zanshin and infectious
---
I understand why PC players would initially get that impression, but it changed a lot, actually. You can really feel the sluggishness of his newly-reduced strike angle against optimal SWFs that have solid movement. The "flick" isn't instantaneous with gamepad of course, but his new demon strike is restricted to such a narrow angle that you can no longer deal with corners at all.
---
I main Nurse on PS4 at red ranks so I've picked up on how to make use of/compensate for limited gamepad turning to the best of my ability. Oni has been neutered so heavily that his demon strike will literally only connect if the survivor is total potato with their positioning and movement.
---
That‚Äôs a bug? I haven‚Äôt come across that one yet. Oh, also sounds are also apparently broken again on killer side so that they can‚Äôt hear footsteps.
---
definitely, I don't support toxic survivors either.  I don't think it's needed unless the killer is having fun with it too.  Very well put :)
---
What if Whispers is just the Entity confessing love to the killer 24/7?
---
Oh boy, Auric cells worth 100 Dollars
---
[deleted]
---
Yes because that is her specific job it‚Äôs her ability main force of dance and it‚Äôs not like plague where it‚Äôs a unique projectile it‚Äôs just one object doing damage
---
Well, you did nothing wrong (except not closing the hatch those sweet points losted) what i may think is that the head shake was misunderstanded? like except of a dissapointment as a "git gud noob" from their perspective, but really idk,  for being a Team most survivors are assholes between themselves so...dont let them get to your head, just play healthy and well, almost always you'll have a good game (there are always who just hate for losing)
---
Yeah, but it also buffs a meta perk, borrowed time. That perk was so good; why did it need a indirect buff? I still don‚Äôt see the reason for the change. Why not make it so when legion is within a 24 meter radius, your deep wound timer will stop ticking? Not hard to implement.
---
But you need calm spirit in case you're facing a doctor, no?
---
I'm on Xbox and queues consistently take like 30 seconds max as killer for me. Survivor queue takes around 5 minutes though.
---
Imagine paying to win with killer that is ok at best. What a scrub.
---
Your build right now sounds pretty good. Have you thought about maybe using lithe as well? Not the quietest since you have to fast vault but good for getting away. Also, if you have Yui, definitely use her scratch mark perk. Can‚Äôt remember the name but you don‚Äôt leave scratch marks once you‚Äôve been hit. Can only be used once per trial but i have purple 3 tick and it lasts a full 2 mins, and i don‚Äôt believe it runs out when you‚Äôre walking/doing gens/healing. Only while running. I find it lasts me almost half the match on a good game.
---
I know it‚Äôs crossed out but demogorgon reee‚Äôs after a hit and it‚Äôs bloody satisfying (I don‚Äôt think he or his perks are good though lol)
---
I did thank for the kind
---
Go suck a dick. ‚ù§
---
Like they're right in a sense, hiding is an option if you see them coming, but the idea that you should never get hooked in the first place is stupid.  Killers have abilities, perks, and the game advantage in chases.  Getting hooked and unhooked is part of the game, there's no reason to punish a survivor for getting hooked
---
Bravo. Keep it up!

are y‚Äôall ok? Old legion was undoubtedly the worst thing for dead by daylight.
---
Some months ago, a wraith tunneled and camped me all game - literally all 5 gens were done. He got blinded by a flashlight about 10 times during all the time he spent chasing me around the map and downing me. Then he DCed. I don‚Äôt even know what I did, he just tunneled me from the moment he saw me.
---
they're saying that myers is pay2win?
---
wait till they hear about spirit, or oni..
---
Reeeepost
---
Nah Mikes not p2w and in my experience he‚Äôs mostly played to do fun builds like jumpscare Myers rather than as some super sweaty meta build
---
I think that perk just stops you from leaving a blood trail,not scratch marks
---
Yes.
---
There are actually tons of abandoned ski resorts. The features in the map and in the video are actually fairly commonplace. The circle of chairs around fireplaces for example.
---
Honestly while I hate Adrenaline I do agree. NOED is a far bigger problem than Adrenaline but I do still think that Adrenaline needs nerfs.
---
Who said I didn't close the hatch? Thanks for the advice :)
---
Hi-Viz Horror used to be my favorite skin before the Blight Spirit one came out. So nasty.
---
Yeah, not very useful imo.
---
I said it once and I'll say it again. Toxic killers are worse than toxic Survivors. Sure Survivors are "more toxic" but that's because... DUH there's 4 of them each match to where there's only one killer but if you're being tunneled and facecamped that killer is physically keeping you from playing the game, a Meg Teabagging and flashlight spamming, while annoying, cannot physically keep a Trapper from playing his game (unless he's being stupid and only goes after her the entire match but that's his decision to do so.) All that Meg is doing is putting herself at risk of being murdered. And while yeah a killer also risks loosing the match for being toxic, they can have several things that can change that very quickly like the noed and blood warden combo and/or the exit gates spawning close together (especially if it's hillbilly or Oni)
---
The splinter offering is what caused it, it lets you try paid killers for free
---
Huh. Just checked and it isn‚Äôt there. Could have sworn there was a bug flair, maybe I‚Äôm thinking of a different subreddit
---
Looks like you used a glass shard which lets you play as the pig for a match
---
It‚Äôs been gone for a while now
---
i love how there are actually people out there who think every change was bc survivors where complaining.
---
It was changed due to EGC.
---
Don't want to get punished by BT? Don't tunnel, you'll also avoid DS, another meta perk btw. And don't ask me, I'm not a dev, I'm just saying that the change they did was better than doing nothing and letting the Legion exploit a loophole to become cancer again.
---
I'd offer that it becomes an obsession perk, with only the obsession getting the health state boost. When all 4 ppl bring the meta perks, it should have diminishing returns for each additional player who runs it.
---
Not to be rude but did you even read the offering?
---
it's a star wars reference, ya doofus
---
It's been give since the end game collapse was a thing.
---
Probably because you used an offering that turns you into pig....
---
No, not anymore.

Survivors are hitable again.

---
Im still waiting yo another AMA to asi them if they will add something like that,  after all, they modeled the brackets on Susie's theeth, so i have hope for seeing them without masks
---
I agree with this. Solo survivor is hell on Earth most of the time. Most of the teammates you get are boosted and will not be there for you even though you do literally everything. Good luck if the killer is competent.
---
Games are so erratic nowadays. You either steamroll, or get steamrolled. Like you said, there's rarely any in-between.
---
He can still one hit without the dash attack right?
---
Holy shit those bp
---
Oh sorry,  you said you stayed between the hook and the hatch and thought you forget to close it.
---
Very well done then! Dont get the salt get to you ;)
---
No. I main Yui and it‚Äôs scratch marks, I also have the teachable on everyone else. it‚Äôs a really good perk. No Mither (David King Perk) is no blood trails. No mither also injures you the whole match. Not really worth it. I‚Äôd stick with the Yui one for sure!
---
Wait, it's supposedly your fault for the survivor letting themselves get stalked?
---
If argue the game is a bit better due to it being smaller and having way less loops
---
You are lucky to not be in my play sessions then, i always get wall-piercing-hatchets huntress, facecamping bubas, tunneling wraiths, and god forbid i with friends because they think we are a de-pip squad or something.
---
id level up meg, q&amp;q and sb are great for stealthy playstyle
---
honestly he just needs a fucking rework from scratch.
---
Yeah, if you're smart you'll assume they're running borrowed time. Respect the perk cause if you dont then you get punished for tunneling. Seriously, don't tunnel, not to be nice but to not get punished by BT and DS. Be smart, chase the person who unhooked the survivor, dont be a dumbass and tunnel someone who has BT, DS and dead hard...all meta perks...
---
*shitpost/meme*
---
Lithe can be used in every map because of it activating on windows or pallets, sprint burst can be used anywhere and is great if you 99 the exhaustion, balanced has 2-3 spots to activate it worse case. I'd Sprint Burst &gt; Lithe &gt; Balanced.
---
CLUNK nnnggggg.... errrrr. errrrr. errrrr.
---
uuuuugh, well..  also thought about it just being a "general fireplace concept"
---
What if it‚Äôs endgame, and all the survivors are bodyblocking? Yeah assume they‚Äôre running it, but what are you gonna do about it?
---
Personally since they removed the stagger reduction from balanced I use lithe, sprint burst forcing me to walk doesn‚Äôt work for me and I hate accidentally triggering balanced from a fall. Lithe is more enraging when they manage to hit you through the window me right after the vault though.
---
She's thicc not fat.
---
You get fucked lmao. You can't do anything about it. Why are you mentioning all this shit? This has nothing to do with the Legion? This is just you getting owned by optimal survivors, which happens. You just tip your hat to the survivors and take the loss. Not much to do in that situation.

I'm level 12 killer on average. If you feel it's necessary to teabag every pallet you drop, I'm face camping. If you get BT'd, I'm tunneling. Don't matter if game ends at 1k, I'll make sure their attitude doesn't get them anywhere.
---
Holy shit this needs to be fixed ASAP
---
&gt;you won't leave trails of blood for a total of...
---
The perk description in no way mentions anything about scratch marks.
---
I feel that it's up to the survivors to pattern out the play style of the killer. As a survivor main, I feel the killer can face-camp all they want.
---
If they do it on the first hook though, they get everything that's coming to them.
---
BLOODWARDEN
---
‚ÄúOptimal Survivors‚Äù Yeah that complain when you run certain perks when they run all meta perks, right? It‚Äôs basically saying ‚Äúhandicap yourself‚Äù
---
And this post has to do something with deep wounds, which reflects off of borrowed time.
---
Bro he rlly wasn‚Äôt that balanced because he could kill. So in this next patch, we need to nerf his ability to kill. Replace his one shot ability with deep wounds. Ez fix
---
Pc
---
Just had a guy escape via hatch because I could close it at all. Was in a corner near a pillar on the game map.
---
lmao nope, i feel so dumb now hahahah
---
Was supposed to be released this year but was pushed back to 2020. You can play the beta by following OP instructions, but once you play it it‚Äôs really clear why they postponed the release lol.
---
You don't have to actually get a save. If you flashlight them early so it blinds them but the survivor doesn't get off, it still counts just fine.
---
keys are unbalanced? I mean.. its not like you can find the hatch so easily, as killer it is 10000 time more easy just to tunnel survs and face camp them
---
Yup, unhook responsibly
---
No I dont but the killer did kill a steve and claudette.
---
I‚Äôve never been more moister then an oyster before in my life.
---
Then use lithe. Also you‚Äôre asking for a stealth build??? Wouldn‚Äôt you be asking for a killer evading build? Stealth isn‚Äôt really what you‚Äôre looking for?
---
I would not wait that long for a light switch to go for a piss at night. Just do it in the dark. Do it anywhere, your dog, your bed, your wife. The last one is the best cause it's more authentic when you're impaled.
---
I've got my channel name on my PSN profile and have yet to have anyone comment on it lol
---
How do you like it? Sounds like they're still having some balancing and technical issues.
---
At this point this isnt even about the Legion anymore lmao. This is just the survivor's running meta perks, which is good, I run meta perks too. Survivors should be allowed to do that as well.
---
There's a difference between thicc and fat, and Jane is not fat mate
---
The devs say they balance the game around 2k. That means the game is balanced around gates powered *every single game*. That means it's not the killer "failing" it means they get a late game buff on a stage of the game the devs have balanced around occurring regularly.
---
You may want to make the lines connecting the upper lip and nose a bit more faded, otherwise, looks great mate!

TBH I'd just make teachables passives and make them unique to that survivor/killer. Never cared too much for the teachables since they were really only there to farm until you could get them on one specific survivor, at the very least making them passives instead of perks might add some variety to the game.
---
\^ This.  Also, if she has the barf-radar, I'd rather stay off it, thanks.  Also, doesn't stunning her still knock her out of it?
---
Just be smart about cleansing.  It's a case-by-case sort of thing anyway.
---
Lol such disrespect to otz.
---
Rip
---
Or at least fractured masks, or like masquerade masks?
---
You could just be getting burnt out. Maybe take a break from the game for a little bit
---
Wouldnt say stupid! Some of those guys are top talent in the industry! Its not because a bug isnt fix for your personal satisfaction that nobody is smart enough to fix it!
---
They got ton of complexity on their hands and a game that a few years old with some legacy code to maintain and improve over time!
---
The game have bugs, it has flaws but is damn fun to play either way! So in my books they doing a pretty good job all around, i easily excuse a few little hiccups here and there.
---
&gt; Lastly, it is more than possible to win without face camping.
---
Indeed.  I reached Rank 1 killer with The Pig, *without* ever getting a 4K or ever using a basement hook.
---
Honestly, the new Pig Head is awful whatever the combo. It just looks ugly, but not in a way that makes it appealing (if you get what I mean). It just looks stupid.
---
Yea that wouldn't be me lol
---
I'm pretty sure everyone agrees on that
---
Still more fun and consistent then i have with dbd cant even get past the maun menu on dbd anymore. Even if i die in last year at least its to a cool kill like being dragged through a vent stabbed in the eye etc. Dbd is iust wack wack wack
---
Yea ik, really bad color-wise. But it works with what I‚Äôm going at
---
How much did it take you especially the handyman
---
Michael is the boogeyman, but this is a cool concept nonetheless
---
&gt; my BBQ shows no one
---
If I have discovered that you have BBQ, which I probably will (because you have come directly at me or one of my SWF teammates), I'm going to be in a locker every single time you hook somebody.
---
Oh definitely
---
Wasn't even stalking, I was doing staying in evil within 1 lol
---
Wow....I‚Äôd totally buy a light switch like this if you made these
---
It‚Äôs just two head ons chained together, honestly head on is pretty funny and just a meme perk
---
I think it‚Äôs randoms as well, not really too toxic, toxic would be like a sweaty SWF going for triple blinds and clicking/tbagging  like crazy
---
That's what I was doing haha
---
Or Ghost face which can insta down you shorter than Mikey can!
---
Smh my head
---
Same!
---
Or nurse, i'd say in capable hands she's still as deadly as ever and she is in the main game :D
---
I guess a good nurse, spirit, oni or billy would have made him/her dc right away
---
That's even worse then lol, I tell every killer I meet to hold that stuff in high regard.
---
Salt like this is the real emblems xD
---
You forgot people laughing at Steve's scream.
---
that would be nice but you‚Äôd definitely have to reduce the amount of lockers it can actually teleport to. there are so many on certain maps that it might be a disaster. there would also need to be something that reduces power effectiveness in a chase because that would be terrifying. overall this is a really good idea, i can see this killer being an interesting mix between hag &amp; demogorgon. very unique!
---
To make a stealthy escape.
---
Eh.
---
‚ÄúWhy are you annoyed?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúSomeone used incorrect grammar on the internet.‚Äù
---
Very reasonable.
---
True he is the jump scare master while Ghostface is the jumpscare memer
---
Ok
---
I figure it would be on a cooldown. Emerging from a locker fast would provide no stealth but would cause nearby survivors to scream
---
Well I mean he's literally referred to as the boogeyman
---
I appreciate the perspective. Still curious as to how devs expect killers to get their adept achievements these days, if what you say is true.
---
Iconic
---
I think it's because the Spirit is shorter and the animation is designed for the trapper's height. My buddies i played with told me she was kinda stretched indeed.
---
that‚Äôs a cool idea
---
I‚Äôm guessing the complainer is one of the 2 running spine chill? Probably salty they wasted a perk slot because it‚Äôs useless against a tier one Myers
---
For real haha
---
If the zodiac killer had a jacksfilms sized forehead
---
I want a full icon pack of this, but i can't find one anywhere. There are so many memes that are perfect replacements for perks.
---
We broke his kneecaps so he can't walk anymore, we thought this would be a good balance change to allow more counter-play on the survivors side.
---
worked, ty
---
Nah, it's not what I mean. I mean the killer who acts like a showman. He comments everything around him through (for example) some loudspeakers , like when he hooks a survivor he has a chance of saying "You are next" through it, when he kills a survivor survivors hear laugh. 
---
I think he would be something like Alastor from Hazbin Hotel. Bored af and doing whatever he wants
---
The first time they scream: Tier 1
---
The second time they scream: Tier 2 and they stay there no matter what
---
They're hunched over while they walk or run: Tier 3
---
I was just playing a couple hours ago, unless you mean like right now then idk
---
SB is the best exhaust perk hands down if you know how to use it.
---
I really don't see any way to change moris without making then unusable.
---
because that's him, baby
---
That just makes moris worse than hooking someone. Nobody wants to spend 7k BP for that.
---
he kinda hot ngl üò≥üò≥ I'm just vibin doe üòé
---
Because Bruce Campbell is a god if not some sort of lower level deity
---
Survivor can‚Äôt be mori‚Äôd until death hook. Boom, problem solved.
---
EDIT: personally I‚Äôm perfectly fine with them being removed entirely; but if they *have* to stay, then this fix would solve that problem.
---
Madness level is shown by the static intensity in the bottom right icons 
---
For the second imagine your throwing a life ring and that‚Äôs the area of effect, in the centre or outside it won‚Äôt do anything, use the add on that lets you see the range in KYF to get a feel for it
---
GF is Pig myers
---
Oni is Billy
---
Spirit is nurse
---
Demo is pig and hag
---
Whats your point, almost every killer is a copy paste.
---
Opening hatch again isn't the problem. The issue is that survivors can 3 gen themselves and not be punished at all for playing stupid if the killer kills one person.
---
Good for you! you discovered the counterplay to BBQ. But like I said, if i see people around the hook im still not leaving.
---
First time I‚Äôve ever heard someone call Myers Pay2Win. It must be hard for that guy, functioning on a daily basis with so few brain cells
---
What that legacy nea
---
Look who‚Äôs shitting in the tall grass
---
EZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
---
He was fun, challenging, unique and original, and then unskilled noobs started complaining about never getting 4ks with him, not being able to win and other dumb reasons, now he‚Äôa bad, annoying and they even removed the fact he was original and unique by making him a pale copy of other killers. I used to play him a ton, but now I can‚Äôt bear to just look at my killer side because of how dumb that rework was.
---
If Legion was a disguise killer, SWF groups would have beaten the living fuck out of him.
---
When you think that but you actually did press the button because the servers are hot garbo.
---
Because it fits with his character, plus he‚Äôs the only one voiced by an actual actor or voice actor, the rest of them are all voiced by random devs at BHVR
---
Doctor when using one of three add-ons. Plus the rework was before Demogorgon. But nonetheless, as unoriginal as it might seem now, even as an old Freddy main myself some changes were definitely necessary. Why he needed the aura power replaced I'll never know, I thought that was great, but the inability to target those not in the dream world and it being far too easy for Survivors to break out of it far outweighed that benefit. And him actually having something to end chases faster was a must, so if they couldn't have all of that AND his old abilities, then I'm happy with the trade off.
---
No
---
Ahem.. What is that she's holding there, bud? Please say a flash light, and not a fantasy! Haha!
---
That's just worse than hooking them normally. It takes longer, gives fewer points, and sticks you in one place while giving survivors an aura of where you are. Literally worse than base kit for 7k bp.
---
Dwight Nervous leader: Does stuff faster with other survivors around/somehow buffs the abilities of other survivors.
---
Meg Energetic athlete: Recovers from exhaustion faster
---
Claudette Studious botanist: Heals faster with medkits
---
Jake Solitary survivalist: Does stuff better alone
---
Nea Urban artist: Quieter movement noises
---
A lot of this wouldn't really work since most of the stuff they are known for in their backstory is already in their perks
---
Ok then...
---
It‚Äôs a microphone, srry:/
---
Nice sketch, Btw. Keep at it!
---
Man, wtf. I've agreed with this for so long and people have been like "nah dead hard is best exhaustion perk". Is it the majority consensus now that SB is the best?
---
The reason all killers look like copy pastes is since they try to make it look as near as possible to the movie. Freddy was like how he was in the movie, but then they just gave in to the noobs complaining and reworked him into an annoying killer to face and boring to play.
---
Agrerd. Plz make more.
---
its a microphone.
---
I was just messing around. üòÅ
---
jane isnt fat though, she is fluffy
---
No worries!
---
There should have been a compromise; if they ever get the license for the OG Freddy, they should bring old Freddy back. They could label new Freddy: the New Nightmare or something. I really liked his aura reading stuff, it was broken. Imagine what Freddy could do with Dark Devotion, furtive chase, nemesis, and any other perk that gave him instant wallhacks.

The entire fantasy of the game is playing a horror movie slasher. Having hooks as the only way to kill doesn't fit that idea. I see a mori maybe once every 10-15 games. They're fine how they are.
---
No-no-no, its preeskool, dont you know the spelling of such simple words?
---
Love it
---
But you can still spot these players from miles away. And with the new spirit change you‚Äôll hear her phase. Plus juking out spirit in her phase isn‚Äôt too hard honestly
---
That sounds like a really good idea, I would love to see something like this implemented into the game!
---
Badham maps are much more balanced than many other maps nowadays... Unless this is a repost from last year or something rofl
---
Lithe, Dance with Me, Iron Will, Fixated. The entire point of the build is to get Lithe to proc, and then disappear into the shadows before the killer can figure out what happened, make sure you use Lithe in an area with a lot of LOS blockers tho
---
What is it with you two writing tella novellas for responses.  Her original response was she didn‚Äôt give a fuck then changed her tune once she got heat for it.  Best way to apologize is a changed attitude.  I haven‚Äôt seen that.
---
You're kidding, right? Lol
---
I know. I'm a Survivor main but the point I'm trying to make is that moris are overpowered
---
i think this would be decently cool, but there are much better ideas out there. 
---
The killers have their fun, Clown laughs, GF takes pics with his mori, ect. I understand the idea though, its supposed to be like, a super evil character who laughs even though the entity is commanding them.
---
I mean it‚Äôs obvious this game has a fetish with killers having masks because literally more than half killers have a mask
---
Nice.
---
No...Doctors are rare anyway. And he doesn‚Äôt shock you 100% of the time
---
this, this is what we all must understand and become. i mean i was just playing some casual freddy, no swing chains or any kind of slow down and this kid with a fortnite pfp messaged me saying i tunneled and camped him even though i got a 4k and they only did 2 gens ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Blocked my loadout bc I don't feel like getting roasted, I forgot to change it from the last round and it makes zero sense with the add-ons.
---
That isn't cool d00d
---
But doctor.
---
Why fixated instead of urban?
---
Honestly the only way not to offend some killers is to just run in a straight line and never, not even once, even THINK of playing with any friends, no matter there skill lvl.
---
Insta blind was purple, with odd bulb, high end safire lens
---
How satisfying is the "click" noise?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Fixated is faster than Urban, plus the added benefit of being able to see your scratch marks, which means you can use them more effectively to trick the killer
---
Almost no one plays him, and even if im p sure your aura still shows when you scream you just dont make any noise.
---
This build will help you lose killers
---
*instantly blows uip meth lab*
---
Correct. I‚Äôve said that, but he would be fun to play against if you were not in a SWF.
---
This debate gets brought up at least 3 times a day and no one ever convinces anyone of anything. At the end of the day, everyone is playing to win and will do whatever they can to get under your skin and tilt you. Its on you whether or not you let it get to you. Hate messages in the post game chat are just salt, learn to enjoy it. If they're hating, they're mad, and if they're mad, you probably won. When you're playing killer, you're the wolf, they're the sheep; play your role and their actions/words won't mean anything. 
---
TL;DR - everyone's an asshole, don't let them get under your skin.
---
No I took a picture of this
---
what if you're on the game? or hawkings? or lery's or inside a house on haddonfield or any of the 5 badham preschool maps? what if you're in a jungle gym and can't see outside it?
---
obviously you can see these killers if you're doing a gen in the middle of an open field, but more often than not, there's a lot of ways they can sneak up on you or at least get a very strong head start
---
Also knowing when the spirit is using their power is not intentional. It's a bug and doesn't happen consistently.
---
I run lithe and I have gotten it too, so idk if it‚Äôs just SB
---
Personally the speed boost only goes away if I lunge during the speed boost, I'm glad I haven't had to to deal with no speed boost
---
I once did something similar but even better. Somebody got caught trying to pallet save me, and he went down on top of me. I had unbreakable 99%ed was just waiting for a good opportunity to use it. Huntress picked up the other guy instead. I unbreakabled, pallet saved him, and we both got away.
---
Exactly? They should be unusable. Or deleted, rather. A killer shouldn't be able to skip 2 hooks because they spent 7000 bp on an offering... and survivors shouldn't just randomly skip generators.
---
No not really. A killer that can disguise them self as a survivor is gonna have to have ways to tell if he‚Äôs the killer or not in order to not absolutely stomp out soloq, but would be absolute dogshit against SWF no matter what.
---
based on dummy thick caboose campbell ü§§ü•¥ü•µ like damn didn't know this was ass vs evil dead üòµüòúüçë
---
But it doesn't work if you're injured.
---
Freddy‚Äôs rework is fine.
---
I swear all this community does is bitch
---
If you're on the gen with them, shouldn't you hear these things too....?
---
He's a rank 20, what the hell does he know?
---
80% of killers rely on wall hack perk builds. So unless you just hop in a locker every time a teammate gets hooked (which is actually bad anf a giant waste of time imo) you are better running exhaustion perks and letting the killer aggro so you can work on movement. All stealth builds will do is teach you to hide at the first sign of a terror radius, and if your teammates aren't amazing the added pressure on them will lead to them getting 2-3 hooked asap. Work on movement, looping, and pulling aggro imo.
---
Imagine 3 of your teammates just died and you can somehow say that the killer lost and claim it‚Äôs pay 2 win.
---
yeah as a survivor main i know we can get pretty fucking toxic 60% of the time if the killer played well ill let them kill me but if theyre camping me you know im bout to blind them at every pallet
---
This combo as a whole works better in uninjured anyways, it‚Äôs awfully hard to escape a chase if you‚Äôve got a constant blood trail leading right to you
---
Ps4, got picked up by hag on the foghorn boat thing, couldn't wiggle until we got off the boat.
---
Don‚Äôt listen to anyone‚Äôs opinions in Rank 20.
---
Just don‚Äôt (unless it‚Äôs constructive of course)
---
but your proposal is only drawbacks. why would i bring one in your change? the animation? personally i think they should make it only on death hook, but make it a game mechanic rather than an offering. like if its gonna be the same thing as just getting the third hook, don't make me spend bp on it. just let me do it.
---
You got my upvote :)
---
not when playing surveillance + pop on freddy :o
---
What does he mean "pay to win"?
---
I don‚Äôt know, man, have you seen Frank and Julie‚Äôs faces? Yeesh.
---
Eyes on the back of her head?

Scarier than their masks!

Your personal experience doesn‚Äôt dictate everyone else‚Äôs, nor is it the norm. I ran into **three** ebony mori‚Äôs in a row just last night; granted this is an extreme example, but I‚Äôve seen a severe uptick in their use these days.
---
Memes were a mistake. It was funny 10 years ago when we were adults and originally made them, but now that all the 13 year olds grew up with them it's just an endless barrage of of copy pasted templates .

It's always a claudette lol
---
B'yeah
---
Take a deap Breath Young 1
---
I think more what I was trying to get at is when you solo queue at rank 1 it's less fun more stressful. I can completely agree that the game is fun when playing with other people, getting good teams and good killers, but 9 times out of 10 when you run alone your teammates are hot garbage, or the killer proxy camps everyone until you are inevitably 2 hooked. Sometimes both if your really unlucky. The game just isnt fun when you play alone at a high rank unless you get the occasional good team good killer
---
They weren't actually. One was a Nea and one was an Tapp.
---
100% ok with that; if anything, I think it might fit better into the gameplay, lore, etc.
---
 I‚Äôve stopped running mori‚Äôs entirely (outside of extreme cases) simply because of how ridiculous they are, and how unfun they are for me to face. I‚Äôd be perfectly fine with their removal.
---

Oh wow. That‚Äôs really good üòØ
---
lol insecure pussy
---
maybe make the main part of the perk you can carry multiple items and the scraping be secondary but other than that love it
---
I actually never went after you personally. I just pointed out that I personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be fun to play against a killer that‚Äôs gonna be such dogshit that they‚Äôll never beat a SWF group due to voice coms alone, and will be so overloaded to compensate for it that soloq stands no chance.
---
i only like moris cuz the mori animation is so much more satisfying than just death hooking. I'd be happy if instead of going for the death hook i could just mori them. helps get my killer rocks off. but they cant get rid of mori before key nerfs. they both are unhealthy but also keep each other in check in a way
---
Damn it's the exact opposite for me. Maybe it's where you're at?
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous now...it‚Äôs ruins gameplay and the flow of the game. It‚Äôs not anti tunnel half the time. It‚Äôs oh I have to slug and wait a whole fucking minute to do anything to this person.
---
Me having Myers make me win I guess
---
Well them beeing tortured makes for a good excuse to keep "killing" people that end up living again anyway. At least ingame lorewise, these dudes are just Victims, pregame, thats a diffrent story.....
---
Face camping is a legit strategy
---
I doubt it but I wish we did, even if the hairstyles freaked out I liked to see it move around when they run instead of just standing still like it's made of plastic. One of the main reasons I love Nea's pink hair w/ the mask.
---
I know, sorry came across the wrong way I‚Äôm just a bit sick of constantly replying to everyone‚Äôs samey comment. Obviously it would require some thought, I just think the idea would work if done correctly
---
Mori animations are **faaar** more satisfying than death hook I agree, especially when you catch that one fucking survivor (we all know the one). 
---
I fear I can‚Äôt enter the key discussion simply because of how infrequently I see them/have a chance to use them; from my personal perspective, they‚Äôre fine (despite the few times I‚Äôve run into them it was quite infuriating), but my own experience can‚Äôt be used as the ruler on which all others is measured.
---
I play solo, the only times I play with friends is KYF. What I meant is yeah, you have a few bad games and some assholes go out of their way to suck the fun out of the game, but finding good things and fun moments is not that difficult
---
&gt;The game just isn‚Äôt fun when you play alone at a high rank unless you get the occasional good team good killer
---
To me is the other way around, where boosted players or toxic players are (thankfully) the exception or the rarer encounter. In my experience rank reset is where he‚Äôll lies, when low ranks and high ranks get messed up and it‚Äôs all a fucking blender of morons running in circles, but still, I try to keep a positive outlook and have fun either way
---
barely makes me muster an exhale
---
why does anybody do anything shear absolute boredom
---
Thanks
---
A week or two ago, a Myers and I desynced so much that he downed me then spent a solid 20 seconds trying to figure out where I'd been downed on Lery's. Presumably, on his screen, I was just running headfirst into a wall and then vanished after being hit.
---
Cropping game 11/10
---
It‚Äôs a fun map in how absolutely fucked it is. I feel like I‚Äôm in a game of mousetrap when playing it.
---
they both do the exact same thing. end the game earlier than its supposed to be by breaking the rules of how the game is played and without any counterplay from the opponent. they cant stop me from skipping a whole hook cycle to kill them and i cant stop them from crouching all across the map while im patrolling gens to find the hatch and escape through it
---
Fucking love it
---
Funny thing... I am a rank 17 killer actually xD
---
Scrapped Tape basically turns your shock from a cone to a donut lol.
---
You hook a survivor and start going after their friends and you just see all their friends at the top and say nope and its camping
---
You're aura isn't shown to him when you don't scream.
---
Ruin certainly serves its purpose for most people in yellow and green ranks, hahah. They either frantically search the map or blow up every gen trying desperately to hit greats. No one can seem to really power through it. 
---
I recently moved into purple ranks and realized Ruin does NOTHING. The survivors blaze through it with zero difficulty and know the maps so well they find the totem spawn almost instantly. At least it buys me about a minute lol
---
Nice format.
---
Idk... The Dragon Ball Fighterz opening might be louder
---
I post on ~15 or so subs, this subreddit is the only one that massively downvotes.
---
Even if it mask that, so what? is one perk slot really worth one killer that happens to be one of the easiest killers to go against and one of the worst in the game?
---
This is just the peak of everything
---
Did you see the leaks for the next killer coming out? He has no basic attack, instead you use your words to ask the survivors nicely to get on the hook. Using anything but kind words will result in a permaban from BHVR.
---
I've owned DBD for about a month now so needless to say I don't know the backstory of this meme in its entirety. But when Oni dropped I got to see that happen and, in the nicest way I can out it, that was a dumpster fire. From what I can tell this game has always been in the Survivors favor though, so I cant say it surprised me.

i get more survivors commenting on my profile then killers, but when survivors are toxic its mostly just, Tbagging and then dying.

but when killers are toxic, its like a wave of hatred and sorrow floods over you while you get tunneled by a ebony mori, iri head huntress.

Yes but it doesn't make you recover faster. That's the misconception

Reset game wont do much. Its been happening for the hunger since the archives released. Im also on console so what do you mean by "verify the files?"

Ah thought you were on PC try contacting customer support? Best advice I can give
---
I was gonna try that. Probably will. Thanks
---
I'll put this nicely. If all of your perks only benefit YOU, then you are a trash teammate. You think killers complain about swf because they are all running selfish perks?
---
What can i say, i have good taste
---
Well if you were going to blind a killer I‚Äôm pretty sure you would only click once otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt get the blind. This post is very mis informative.
---
Also no crows.
---
Iri heads do not equal wins.
---
Abusing Moris means you don't get points (which is winning imho)
---
&gt;T-bagging is toxic
---
O I am laffin.
---
That poor baby dweet got 0 points
---
there are hardly any crows on any of the new maps, and almost no killers even notice them
---
this is just me but i think that they were meant to nerf billy(the killer that REALLY needs some balancing rn) and instead they nerfed oni because between chainsaw and demon charge they couldn't tell them apart and then it was too late.. :(
---
I don't always play to win. Sometimes I just play to have fun.
---
That's what this build is. Sorry that I'm trying to find different ways to have fun in a game.
---
To compensate for 3 garbage perks?
---
Fake grabs have always been a thing, but the move to dedicated servers have made them massively more frequent and made the timing much more survivor-favoring on whether the grab is real or not, as well as making the killer lose much more time to the survivor running off while the animation plays.
---
Iri heads do equal wins if you are competent. They are OP as shit.
---
Abusing moris DO get you wins. Your definition of winning isnt the games, Getting a 4k is winning.
---
I mean I know, I die quick anyways because I can't lead a chase for shit. I just want to be playing with them so they can constantly be telling me what I should and shouldnt do (like should I go for that unhook, stay on my gen, take a hit, when I should walk, when to run, etc)
---
You didn't even leave a trap either, which is like camping as Hag but considered ok because it's her power
---
They probably don't want to de-pip. I understand where you're coming from though.
---
Rework their faces and then yeah go for it

---
Rank 1 killer: trapper &amp; freddy mostly
---
On freddy:
---
The biggest mistakes I see survivors make when I'm freddy is being greedy on loops while asleep. His lunge is the exact same as everyone else but is misleading since his model is so short (it's longer than you think it is). His snares make excessive pallet looping impossible if the freddy is any good. Drop pallets early and then book it to the next loop. Also, don't expect to be able to be ballsy and start running at the last second. If you here him coming start making your way to a nearby loop.
---
Keep an eye out for the alarm clocks when asleep. Don't waste a ton of time seeking them out every time you're asleep but definitely use them if you go anywhere near yours. If you hit clocks when you're near them and wake each other up when you see each other freddy's powers are all hamstrung (slower gen TPs, ropes are less effective, snares/fake pallets don't work).
---
I also see people try to be ballsy around hooks. Remember if the unhooker is asleep borrowed time won't trigger, and a perk like STBFL will make that suicidal.
---
Overall the big thing with freddy is *play safe.* Drop pallets early, don't go for unsafe hooks, be mindful of his power (try to be awake).
---
Some general commentary:
---
&gt;counter
---
As an aside, I'll point out that this isn't a 1v1 game. You shouldn't expect to "counter" killers. You can stall a bit, but you should *expect* to lose the chase in a short amount of time. Your goal is to make it take as long as you can and do gens if you aren't being chased. All killers can be wrecked by a good team. A good team has players that spend 99% of the match on a gen or being chased and pretty much nothing else. No wandering, no walking around, just directly to a gen, and *the second* you aren't being chased get on the closest gen immediately. At that point any long loops are just a bonus. I've been wrecked by teams even when chases were pretty short and the reason is because gens can be done *so fast* when a team focuses on doing them and isn't timid or goofing off.
---
If you play on console I would be down to play!
---
Imagine having to start at level 1 for each character... because there are no bloodwebs, you need to play games to level them up, the only compensation is that the first teachable is gained at level 20, but the other two are at level 30 and 40...
---
Nurse was free DLC. 
---
Also you can force her to waste multiple double blinks trying to just catch up to you when ur doing nothing more than running in a straight line. I‚Äôd hardly call that ‚Äústill deadly as ever‚Äù
---
I post primarily on gaming sub right it's and on those people use the downvote as a disagree button
---
Looks like a fucking ghoul NPC from fallout lol
---
If you are a really good survivor you can juke her hatchets. Literally just dont get hit.
---
What do you win when you win any online game like this? sure saying "I only win if i get 4k" is a great way to challenge yourself, but killer isn't balanced around 4king every game, nor is that the intent.
---
Lore wise the entity doesn‚Äôt always have full control of people or even killers. Micheal has those add ons that let him kill people and lore wise that‚Äôs basically him breaking free from the entity for a moment. Perhaps Ash is strong enough to resist it to some extent and therefore gets to keep his voice? 
---
In reality though they got the actual actor who played Ash and they weren‚Äôt going to waste that opportunity
---
That's just pathetic. Most SWFs say fuck off and don't farm with killers. Look what happened when a SWF did. Lovely.
---
[https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/106566/stats-november-2019](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/106566/stats-november-2019)
---
65.80% kill rate at red ranks (ranks 1 to 4) as of last month, since the changes to her blinks exclusively, according to BHVR.
---
She only drops down to 47.5% (estimated, halfway between 45 and 50) when you include all ranks, which indicates that it's still a skill issue causing her to underperform when you include ranks 5 to 20.
---
I suggest you look at the REAL statistics from developers who ACTUALLY track the games, not hyperbole pulled out of the nether because some random nobody without all the statistics thinks otherwise. &gt;:P
---
You're wrong, the entire collection of every single post-change Nurse game proves you wrong, as you go higher in ranks, Nurse has a viable kill rate, ergo time spent playing (and/or experience needed to even hit red ranks as killer) results in her having an equivalent kill rate.
---
Pick rate being low doesn't mean she's bad, look at Hag's abysmal pick rate compared to Trapper in the above link.
---
Or how Huntress is picked as often as Freddy at red ranks.
---
Do you think this means Huntress is stronger than Hag, Bubba, Doctor, Plague, Pig, Demogorgon, Clown, Nurse, Wraith, Myers/Shape, Legion, Trapper and Ghostface?
---
She's actually below most of those.
---
Nurse's difference in kill rate at red ranks is &lt;5% lower than the bulk of the killers, she might need one or two number tweaks, but she's actually in a much better place than she used to be, and still averages 65 kills out of 100 survivors.
---
Take a small trip over to r/hearthstone . Spout an unpopular opinion there and say goodbye to 60 karma easily (luckily karma doesn‚Äôt matter)

Regardless, I think everyone kind of overblows how ‚Äúfat‚Äù Jeff is. He‚Äôs got a little meat on his bones but he doesn‚Äôt remotely compare to thickness of Bubba, Clown, or even Jane. I‚Äôm waiting for an actual LaChappa survivor in DBD not someone with a slight dad bod.
---
Cool opinion dude, also, shut the fuck up
---
it was a freddy and they got me right as i got unhooked, like i wasn‚Äôt even able to move a single inch
---
...that's literally what you have to do to get the achievement. So maybe check on that next time.
---
Man if a killer messages me and wants to farm like lets go, I'm all for helping others in the community when they need it. Trapper needs me to step in 5 traps? Cool I got you. 
---
I have messaged others to help with challenges and they helped and I didn't screw them / vice versa. But this is a first.
---
So you have to double pip?
---
Why doesn‚Äôt say that?
---
Towards the end, I heard a ufo sound effect and I cant tell whether it was in during the video or if you added it in.
---
Keys being reworked to be more utility-based might be a good idea.
---
* Start with removing broken key and rebalancing the usage time of the other keys.
---
 * Give Keys the ability to recharge over time while not being used.
---
To compensate Killers the hatch will only appear if the gates are powered or only 1 Survivor is alive.
---
 * Prevents 2-3 Survivors from nabbing an easy hatch escape if only 3-4 gens are done.
---
I liked the part where he said the n word
---
Sometimes you have to play dirty for challenges. This is the way of the Killer.
---
I hope I see something like this one day. That‚Äôs hilarious.
---
Yeah it sucks because I really like Legion as a character. And even now they can be really fun to play, but compared to other killers they just don't stack. Ghostface main myself. But I'll have to see if I cant find some old posts from around that time cause I bet the memes were god tier
---
Practice great skill checks. Honestly just work through it. Or learn all the totem spawns. I know probably about 85% of them on coldwind, autowreckers, and Macmillan.
---
What an entitled a**
---
I like Legion and they are still viable with a good build. Plague is also pretty underrated and great at map pressure and control.
---
I've got another scenario for you.
---
They've done 2 gens and as you put your second survivor on their death hook, a gen pops.
---
You start getting notifications for rushed actions.
---
You find Feng Min self-caring on the hatch and Blendette head ons you then opens the hatch.
---
Fade to black.
---
Entity displeased
---
"GG EZ baby killer"
---
I liked the part where he made a fair point
---
Other times I hear nothing, or it swaps multiple times within a chase, from loud and map-wide (like survivor injury sounds playing right next to me no matter where they are) to absolutely nothing, dead ass silence, from the same survivor.
---
On the killer side, Freddy's lullaby/heartbeat are particularly offenders, I've had them right in my ears and thought he was camping the hook, but he wasn't, and I never saw him when I risked the unhook anyway, like he wasn't even present after looking around for 30+ seconds.
---
Did you actually un-ironically hit me with the "just dont die lmao"
---
So if you think like this, when you get a 4k with a ebony mori... who wins? the survivors didnt win, and the killer also didnt win, so why even have the offering in the game in the first place if no one wins.
---
People who use these addons and offerings "effectively" couldnt give less shits about pips. I dont think i have cared about pips since i got the rank one achievement but i still get it almost every season.  
---
These things shouldnt even be in the game in the first place.
---
Okie Dokie
---
That weight loss joke legitimately makes me burst out laughing lol
---
[holy fuck its quan chi's deadly alliance fatality](https://youtu.be/ESiTYQy0ulM)
---
I just DC so the other can get hatch if the killer keeps slugging us and checking on gens. Like if you're patrolling gens and just going to slug for the 4k smh.
---
Honestly it depends on the game. At the beginning there is no point in face camping. However as it progresses and people die it's a great strategy sometimes. Especially if their are only 2 people left
---
I'm a console pleb
---
It was awesome first person. I wish I was recording. I probably will start soon though.
---
He really dropped his nuts like no tomorrow lmao
---
You need merciless killer, AKA a double pip. It does say that.
---
I was playing as Freddy a couple of days ago and got down to two survivors.  A Quentin who has run good chases, unhooked others and did gens, and an urban evasion Blendette who crawled into Yamoaka bushes anytime I came close.  I made real sure to hook the blendette and let the Quentin go just to teach the blendette a lesson.
---
A killer who brings a Mori:
---
1: Cannot protect their addons with a Black Ward (and cannot keep them on use in any other way, while survivors always can); this can cost up to 14,000 BP in addons.
---
2: Cannot bring any sort of BP offering, either to max a more difficult point category, or something like survivor pudding (which doubles the BP, up to 32,000).
---
3: Cannot influence the map, its visibility, hook spawn distance, or number of chests that spawn.
---
Then they still have to chase a survivor twice, they just mori you instead of you hook you the second time, but there's almost no difference since you're probably not going to get saved if the killer picks you up instead.
---
Also I think moris shouldn't be considered in isolation, games pass far too quickly to make 3-hooking 4 different survivors very feasible compared to chase times/safe pallets resetting chases/etc.
---
Odds are you can still crank out the gens with two full "lives" (downs) instead of three.
---
i‚Äôm so used to watching and playing with people in college or older, i tend to forget that a lot of high school kids play this game as well :L
---
Definitely sprint burst. You usually start the match near a gen so you just walk to the gen and if the killer comes then you bait him and sprint away to the nearest loop. Then it will take him much longer to catch you. 
---
Even if you have to use sprint burst early then it will come back whilst you are on gens or whilst you are hooked or downed. This means you can spring away from a killer returning to the hook, sprint away from that gen if you need to and spring instantly when revived from the dying state or whilst being healed if you need to.
---
When exhausted you can let yourself recover to 99% and then keep running. When the killer comes then you walk for a second, sprint burst returns and you sprint away.
---
It takes a little practice to use well but it's probably the strongest in the game because whilst I love dead hard, sometimes it just simply doesn't work due to lag.
---
Endgame collapse
---
gotta love that guy who wastes the first half of that game using pharmacy to get a high tier med kit instead of doing objectives. Self care basically is mandatory, like unbreakable or bt
---
If we ever do get something like it hopefully it doesn‚Äôt look like that
---
is that a Blendette in the corner
---
Remember that downs translate to hooks almost 100% of the time, and you have to be downed twice for them to mori you, if they didn't mori you, you would get put on the hook and have been hooked twice.
---
Meaning you're only losing one hook.
---
That just simply isn‚Äôt true. Yeah there‚Äôs positions that are better than others but there‚Äôs plenty of generator positions that don‚Äôt  give you line of sight from every direction. Maybe from one or two directions but not all. 
---
Also re: spirit I think we‚Äôre having a misunderstanding. I don‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs good to know when spirit is approaching. Rather mid chase to help determine if she is actually using her power or just standing still. A spirit will often look away from you to go around a loop in their power, so if the husk is looking at you but spine chill is off, you know she‚Äôs using her power. The bug I was talking about was how sometimes you can hear the woosh despite being in her terror radius
---
Unfun does not equal toxic. Unfun for you does not equal reportable/bannable/not allowed.
---
Also, unfun doesn't matter in regards to your opponent. Survivors looping is unfun. DS and BT is unfun. Losing is unfun. But your opponent is never responsible for your fun. No other player is responsible for your fun within the confines of the game's mechanics and banned actions.
---
Of course we hope that the community, as a whole, strives to increase fun... But no one has the right to dictate how another player plays the game (within the confines of the game's mechanics and banned actions).
---
i will say i think killers should have a way to keep add ons like survivors can. like if a killer gets a 3k or 4k or if they get so many hooks they don't lose their add ons or something like that
---
I personally find Legion the most fun and they have that sweet sweet discordance
---
Demo has some lag issues if you're on console
---
Oni is meh on console
---
Clown is relatively weak but still fun and he has Pop goes the weasel and Bamboozle which can be used in some pretty fun meme builds.
---
Plague is usually fun and she is definietly the strongest of the bunch.
---
We have an ingame friends list now... Maybe we'll be able to add people to it regardless of platform? Idk
---
Nice nosejob
---
He‚Äôs clearly a 12 year old
---
Then can we get a thicc yui
---
I'm not the author of the picture.
---
I don‚Äôt like survivors that were never weaned off the tit and mistake a generator for their source of food. But I‚Äôm not about to go and bitch that it isn‚Äôt fair for a bunch of gray rank survivors to do that against my red rank killer.
---
touch√©
---
Works for me
---
no i doesn‚Äôt need nerfed you entitled survivor main she only gets 1 yes &amp; yes you can get 3 but you need to bring infantry belt so no its not op since you need to use 2 addons to get 3 1 shot hatchet 
---
note sorry for the bad grammar im kinda sick
---
I recently swapped out dead hard for it and have been doing really well. If the killer comes then I run from the gen to the nearest loop without ever getting hit. Can sprint away after getting unhooked so you don't need DS as much. Can 99 it and get the unhook, then bait the killer and sprint away etc...
---
Probably the biggest thing for me is that you have to be injured to use dead hard and with this you can avoid getting injured.
---
$5 he's still stronger and more viable than current Legion.

These posts are tired as fuck and honestly toxic. If you're going to give the hatch for some reason, who cares if they wiggle out? Give them the fucking hatch or gate, you're ALREADY giving it, just stop moving and let them have it. Instead it makes sense that in every fucking game survivors shouldn't struggle, give up on any chance of getting out (and it's literally something I've done multiple times and gotten away, especially when there aren't many hooks or they choose the wrong hook) AND the struggle points, for what? For the off chance that 1 in 50 killers give you hatch for not playing anymore?
---
I don't know what streamer started this, but I assume one or a group of them are keeping this notion alive for some reason, and it's extremely tiresome. Killers don't give hatch enough for people to not struggle, and if you're already being nice, then be nice, don't be a fucking dick and pretend like the survivor who you didn't tell you were giving hatch should assume otherwise.
---
Well, there are a few issues that aren‚Äôt being taken into account with the graphs. 
---
1. Doesn‚Äôt tell the average rank of survivors against particular killers. The current ranking system is putting a lot of low ranks, &lt;10 against high rank killers often because of people that want to play with friends. This will skew the data by a large margin.
---
2. Killers have to get 3-4 kills per game to actually maintain a red rank, so on average they have to be extremely good. Below red ranks you tend to need 2-3k to maintain ranks. Again, this will skew the data and until they fix the ranking system people need to stop talking about how BHVR wants killers to get only 2k per game. Otherwise no one would ever get a higher rank. Until they make that change it makes 0 sense to talk about killers over performing. They‚Äôd literally have to or no one could get and maintain higher rank.
---
3. This data likely includes extreme outlier players, such as streamer. Those ppl often have thousands of hours played and play more than the average player by a significant margin. They could further skew the data.
---
I‚Äôm sure there are other other factors that aren‚Äôt accounted for.
---
Makes sense, but I have people downing me next to it and encouraging me to crawl towards it, just to close it anyway.
---
While I might agree that the percentages are more heavily weighted towards toxic survivors than toxic killers, I was more using the above as an example rather than specific numbers.
---
I was attempting to show that even if the percentage was the same, the sheer number of survivors compared to killers will make it worse. The difference of a toxic game every 4 games versus every game being toxic is huge.
---
Also --- Camping isn't toxic. It's an inefficient and often unfun way of winning, but it's not toxic.
---
That's my sleep paralysis demon
---
Oh yeah we do. Yeah idk how that works 2. Sad

Not deleting the intro movie so that your load times are faster.

Not replacing your DbD icon with a script that checks if the video exists and deletes it if it does, starts your AHK struggle script, and then loads up the game.

imagine?
---
Since the Craven Estate got rights to Nightmare in the US but New Line still owns the franchise, licensing is gonna be tough for all 3 parties. It could actually bring regional exclusives, which BHVR wants to avoid at all costs
---
I know right? Slugging for the 4k is just as bad as using a key to open the hatch after the killer closed it, or lighting up one gate and then stealthing for the other, or trying to switch generators because the killer keeps camping one.
---
Just stick to one thing and don't consider other strategies even if it means accepting your death.
---
Like that killer should just hook the one survivor already, instead of going after another, you should only stick to the one gate/the one gen/the one chance at hatch without key.
---
And if doing so is going to get you found and killed, and you know it, keep on trying anyway - you should be honored.
---
Camping is toxic
---
Just make sure the killer doesn't run Remember Me

Technically, u use sprint burst to run to the farthest loop :p I know what you meant though, just wanted to clarify.
---
She‚Äôs the new survivor
---
ok
---
I took this picture from google since trying to screenshot the struggle stage on xbox will definitely kill me.
---
The thirst here is drowning me
---
Ew they even asked for Streamers. I can't believe there's killers that do that.
---
It's to delay the EGC. Why you would need to delay it, idk. If someone's downed or hooked, the EGC timer is slowed anyway.
---
This is a good example of someone who is unwell and is abusing the trust of a stranger to get a high from tricking them. I realize some people may want to say, "It's not that serious, it's just a game." But some cruel people will get their "ill kicks" through any means they can.
---
Sorry that happened.
---
Lmao!
---
All gens done and/or hatch close.
---
the bar below your Icon is literaly the same
---
Ok thanks
---
It's pretty good, most people hide in lockers now, but not everyone.
---
My personal advice to stop proxying killers is that if you're literally across the map from where the person got downed, don't enter a locker, let BBQ&amp;C light you up.
---
The killer is more likely to leave the hook to come for you, allowing the save, but also you're across the map and have a chance to hide after the aura fades as well.
---
Of course if I've actually got serious progress on a generator I hide in a locker even so, it's one thing to take aggro, it's another to let the killer potentially Pop Goes the Weasel on your 75% generator.
---
Makes sense
---
Read my comment. My bar is not the same as a timer for how long you have to live.
---
Cheers ;) but it's very situational. The furthest loop could be right next to a gen my team mates are working on, it could also be somewhere that has a very unsafe pallet etc.. Of course I agree that you need to try and make as much distance as possible but ideally you also want to be able to return to the gen you are working on easily if it is close to being done.
---
The two iterations were broken beyond belief honestly
---
your Comment wasnt there yet lol
---
But how about removing the mashing altogether?
---
Had a game once that actually took like 20 mins because the killer would switch between slugging each of us, I was like heck this and left lol. You stop getting xp after 10 mins anyways, so not point.
---
This is great, awesome job!
---
You say that but I own every killer and still get splinters. It's bugged af.
---
u/raynebou gave us a treasure with their work
---
Theres nothing immersive about slapping a button over and over. Why do you think QTE are disliked? There is little to nothing even immersive about the game.
---
I agree. Like I said in another comment though, I think this would be a decent middle ground since the dev's like the mashing for immersion.
---
I‚Äôm a Freddy Main as well and I was at rank 1 until reset. My build is as follows. BBQ, Discordance, Stridor, and Ruin. BBQ so I get information on where players are(as long as they are further than 40 meters and/or not in a locker/near the hook). Discordance so even if they do hide I know when they come out and start working together. It also slightly slows down the game because if they pick up on it then they know not to work together too much. Stridor so that way I can have better luck hearing where injured survivors are unless they run something like Iron will and/or calm spirit. And ruin just so I could slow the game down...just a little bit. You won‚Äôt win every game you get into, but I‚Äôve gotten a 4K a good 90% of the games I play every night. As for snares or pallets, I usually use snares, but on azorov(sorry if that‚Äôs spelled wrong I‚Äôm drunk rn) I use pallets.
---
The post itself even says it‚Äôs graphs numbers don‚Äôt mean everything because of the fact it literally doesn‚Äôt take anything else into consideration. I feel like whoever brings up those graphs for the ‚Äúkillers are op!‚Äù Argument didn‚Äôt actually read what they had to say.
---
You are preaching to the choir here. All I'm saying is if they really want to keep it something like this would help.

Inconsiderate is not toxic. Your fun is not my responsibility, whether I‚Äôm a killer or a survivor.
---
Tombstone Piece and Tuft of Hair does not grant the ability to kill survivors and stay in tier 3.
---
Only Judith's Tombstone and Tuft of hair allows that.
---
Plenty of people do, why wouldn‚Äôt we?
---
Major 4head here, this is for survivors, the killer can‚Äôt see this
---
Breakout doesn‚Äôt stack, I‚Äôm sure of it. The devs probably saw the quad swf with 4 breakouts and boil over coming and removed the possibility of it stacking.
---
She did that and she got the notification saying it was being looked into. I don't know why people need to be an ass to someone else for absolutely no reason at all. Just makes them look bad.
---
Agreed, honestly this is the only thing I‚Äôd like about crossplay. I‚Äôm so tired of trying send someone a gg or mention something funny about the match only to see they have their messages privated
---
I'm a survivor main, actually. And when I do play killer I don't face camp. I do tend to run a 3-gen plague strat, so if I hook someone in my normal patrol, I'm going to continue my normal patrol... And I've been called a camper because of it... But that's more circumstantial than anything. I'm not one to camp just for the sake of camping.
---
But, I do see how some people could use that tactic or want to use that tactic, and they are welcome to do so. It *should* be inefficient. It *should* be easily countered... But survivors take the bait and reward the camper. So if it's stupid and it works, it's not stupid.
---
I do try to help teach people to expand out from camping. It's better for everyone involved if everyone enjoys the game. And I agree that teaching people to do better, play better, and such helps in that... 
---
But the major issue that comes up in regards to Camping and Tunneling is that survivors will just cry and scream about *their* fun and not give a fuck about the killer's fun. When killers do make posts, the same survivors that cry on here about camping and tunneling are telling killers to grow up or get better at the game. RES is wonderful to track people... Heck, I even have you tracked based on your post history. Am sure some people have me tracked too.
---
But that aside. When one side only cares about their fun, while disregarding the other side's fun, then it's unfair. There's a reason survivor queue times have gotten ridiculously long the past two months. Killers haven't been having fun, so they've stopped playing. It's gotten to the point that BHVR had to expand the rank search to +/-6 recently and that's only going to make it worse. Now mid-rank killers are going to go up against low-rank survivors. Those survivors are going to stomp the mid-rank killers. Mid-rank killers aren't going to enjoy their games at all and will stop playing. Then mid-rank survivors are going to see a lack of killers to match with, thereby causing further problems.
---
Survivors bitch and complain and dictate how killers should and should not play. And then survivors wonder why no one wants to play against them.
---
Killer wants to camp? They get to camp. No one gets to dictate how another person plays the game within the confines of the game mechanics and the bannable actions.
---
Ah that‚Äôs messed up then but then still I don‚Äôt understand why it worked for others x)
---
A killer got me with that, I didn't hold a grudge. It was actually a fun match, since two of my friends that rarely play joined me for that round. I told them I was going to the basement to get some points, since sometimes killers were cool and will go AFK and not attack. The conversation went as such: "I'm just going to run down here really quick, since he's been AFK the whole time, then I will run right back up and help you guys! I don't even see him down here, oh! He's in the cor- OH GOD HE IS HERE, HE IS HERE-HERE!"
---
 He hooked me and got the other two while they tried to save me. We were cackling hens the whole time.
---
You get my üëç
---
No. You have to get multiple hooks in order to safe pip at higher ranks. I‚Äôve had games end in like 5 minutes where I got a 4k and deranked at rank 4. Being too good will actually give you negative rank. And from my understanding, since I‚Äôve never been rank 1, you have to get about 2-3 per survivor on 3-4 survivors to even pip at rank 2. I think your game has to be near perfect to double pip at rank 2. I struggle to safe pip at rank 4, because I‚Äôm still not super aware of endless loops.
---
Edit: as someone that went from rank 20 to rank for the past few months, after taking a year off, I ran into way less higher rank survivors than lower ranks. When I hit rank 4, about 80% of my games were against 1/2 red ranks 2-3 purple or lower ranks. The ranking system more often favors the highest rank to be matched at the killer‚Äôs level.
---
That's what I'm talking about though, I'd literally Dodge every lobby bc I can't stand people running those perks.
---
The Plague's pose.
---
I always hook the remaining survivors twice then let them do gens while fucking around delaying them. Then I'll kill everyone at the end.
---
I had the SAME happen to me,  and I posted it as well. I got harassed the whole post, saying it's not toxic and I shouldn't of fell for it. :/ Parts of this game suck. If surviviors do ANYTHING they're toxic, but killers can do the most toxic shit in the game and no one bats a eye.
---
I didn‚Äôt want to say this because I didn‚Äôt know how popular my pic would be but I was REALLY hoping someone would use the Dwightermit as meme material. Thank you so much for making this üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
No one likes it... Sure.
---
That doesn't make it toxic.
---
I don't like going up against Ghostface. Doesn't mean playing Ghostface is suddenly toxic.
---
Camping is a strategy. It may be an inefficient strategy. It may be a strategy that should be easily countered. But it is still a strategy.
---
&gt; No one gets to tell another player how they should play within the confines of the game mechanics and non-bannable actions.
---
This is a very neutral premise. It includes survivors and killers. If you disagree with this premise for any strategy -- If you draw the line for one strategy -- I'm going to use the same argument you use for every other strategy.
---
This is so damn relevant it actually hurts.
---
Team repairs are time wasters unless your doing an important gen, unless someone has the perk that makes it faster.
---
Not only is the efficiency decreased when two people are repairing, but if the killer comes, he takes 2 people off of gens instead of only one. This is obviously not good.
---
As survivor you want to be spread our from your teammates and be doing different.
---
Self care is bad, but it's not a time waster. You could even use the above to argue it's a time saver.
---
I find sometimes posting on here is hit or miss.
---
Sucks that you had the same game experience as me though. :/
---
Fix the swf issues
---
I‚Äôm glad you like it! Hopefully others see the potential
---
The wound is fresh every time it happens üòî
---
I‚Äôm not talking about any bug. If you‚Äôre playing against a killer, you should know who that killer is and play accordingly. Spirit can‚Äôt gen grab you anymore so that argument you tried was irrelevant. The stealth killer can all be seen, and if you know you‚Äôre playing against them put yourself in a position to see all approaching angles. Don‚Äôt tell me it isn‚Äôt true, I‚Äôm a rank 1 surv bud. Trust me it‚Äôs true
---
Kindred only works if the person on the hook has it or you are running it, you will be able to see all auras whenever anybody aside from you is hooked.
---
This is looking like an enemy you'd find in Fear and Hunger. Love it.
---
I really wish they added crossplay. As a console player, I would love to go against a good Nurse or Huntress
---
Thanks, but don't take it so seriously, I was just joking.
---
Anyway, so wholesome.
---
Hence, why I said you need about 2-3 hooks on 3-4 survivors. On 4 survivors you'd need 2 at minimum on each and 3 on one, or some other combination. You'd also need to take into account all the ways in which you'll get negative points in each category. Most categories can actually deduct points from your overall progress to piping. Hooking survivors is one of the few that doesn't have a negative to it, but staying too close to hooked survivors, which can sometimes be a thing when survivors try and kite a killer around and it happens to be close to another survivor hooked. Also why I said you need a near perfect game to pip at high enough ranks.
---
Thanks it came from the heart
---
I play Adam all the time. He's one of my favourite survivors even though I'm a Jake and Quentin main. It's a shame Adam hasn't gotten many cosmetics though. I made a post about this just yesterday.
---
This is how I got the two sacrifices during Endgame challenge, just a complete Endgame build.
---
I feel it. Started off on a bad note with all that abandonment and then you have those matches where you do some cool shit
---
And huntress just hums over it? horrible
---
Pretty sure hes joking dude lol
---
She looks similar to Revelations Jill, but just different hair (and actually modeled after someone, don‚Äôt remember if Revelations based their models on anyone). 
---
Regardless, I would have much preferred they brought back Julia Voth, and I‚Äôm a little disappointed that they didn‚Äôt.
---
It could be helpful for people with medical constraints, such as nerve damage or other issues that make the repetitive tapping difficult. Hell, sometimes my own thumb will lock up and my hands are fine lol. While I am not personally bothered by the tapping, I wouldn't mind giving it up if it benefits others!
---
It's almost like the graphics were enhanced 100x over
---
Yeah I figured with all the sadness I'd throw in some good clips too
---
Punch one person everyday. Now do it with friends, repeat the process for days, weeks, months
---
Don't be surprised when you get stabbed several times in return
---
Not just that, I don't know if the data takes into account rank reset properly. Reset would often put much higher ranks against the must larger pool of low ranks. This can skew the data as well.
---
I've recently taken him up along with Tapp, though I think Tapp might be my main to fall back on.
---
They look really bad, Joey's is alright but the other 3 look like they were just thrown together because they didn't intend on showing their faces
---
I'd totally be down for survivor facial reworks, for the older ones at least. Obviously they wouldn't look that good, but I feel BHVR has already come a long way since they started.
---

Great work. I want to order a gen, but the color selector makes me think it‚Äôs not going to be colored like in the first picture. Can you clarify please?
---
Ok bud.
---
They changed it awhile back, in case you didn‚Äôt know. It used to be just getting a 4K. You now need a double pip.
---
He spoke too soon
---
Fix the damn hitboxes. Straight up, I've wanted to eat my keyboard with how many hits that should not have connected connecting.
---
Quite the shitty take
---
He's a god now
---
I‚Äôd actually be down for this, it gives incentive for players to actually prestige instead of just getting the bloody version of that characters default outfit.
---
So what I said is correct then, it is possible to get 2 pips on a 1k game, it might be really hard, but it's possible.
---
In fact now that I think about it, I think you need 3 iridescent and 1 gold to pip, so the 3rd hook on one survivor isn't even necessary, which would mean you can double pip on a 0k game if I remebered it right
---
As a killer main I can 100% agree. However, survivors can be incredibly toxic themselves. 
---
I try my hardest to avoid face camping and tunneling, but if you piss me off, you‚Äôre getting face camped, I don‚Äôt care if everyone else gets out. 
---
There has to be balance for everyone to enjoy the game
---
Think About What You Just Said... Reread What You Typed, But Slowly...
---
Werent Steve and Nancy voiced by their actors? Cause if not those screams are spot on for whoever did them at BHVR
---
Getting your snowball effect easily and early is SO much better than tying the game after two other teammates got killed
---
Not to mention that you counter every single save that could happen when you pick them up, including DS
---
Keys either require good luck or your item slot, while basically putting a massive target on your back saying "tunnel me plz" a mori is a fucking offering that doesn't give a shit about any downsides, it just exists.
---
I just realized what the perk meant I misread it ty!
---
I was really hoping Legion would be like this. Like the ‚Äúteleport‚Äù would be Frank going into one locker, and Susie coming out the other, for example. 
---
I suppose a killer having this power now would just make them a discount Freddy. Instead of teleporting to gens, it‚Äôs lockers. But I thought it‚Äôd be cool nonetheless.
---
As a killer main, just survivor challenges in general are obnoxious. I only play survivor for dailys. I used to hate SWF, but I get why they do it. Playing solo survivor is a major pain in the ass. If I'm not with incompetent teammates, I'm going against a camping/tunnelling killer with NOED. Lobbies take forever as a survivor for me recently. 3 killers in a row, face campers with NOED. One of them even rage quit because two of us were going to escape.
---
I just had a match like 10 minutes ago where all 3 of my randoms disconnected and them the killer left me slugged until I bled out.
---
RIP to all my green mori's
---
Gg

"Pretty much anything" is a gross exaggeration. That said there are numerous subs on reddit who are very swift to downvote things they don't agree with, and a lot of cases of piling onto something that is already downvoted just to add to it. However I don't understand why people care about karma. I find most people click on the most downvoted stuff just to see what it says (hell I've heard people skip regular posts just to see those posts) so it's not like they're being ignored, and karma is pretty worthless as an indicator for how good a poster you are as most peoples biggest karma points come from, well, memes and jokes.
---
Look out, the guy with the long list of URLs is going to spawn! Lol
---
So it's not just me and my buddies then (me and my one bud are mediocre-bad, and my other one is our dear potatoe that we're trying to protect. So we're not toxic. Just tryin' to do gens and not die). Combine that with shitty killer ping and hits being even more killer favored than ever (and three asshole killers after an early DC), I flat out rage quit early tonight because my brain just said "if you play one more game, you're gonna break something. Stop".  I'll pick it back up again another day. Just not today.

When out in open areas like that you really need to looking all around you, literally because this can happen. This killer was running Monitor and Abuse but you probably coulda spotted him if you looked behind ya. All in all always look in all directions
---
Never ran into one on pc, at this point, was quite surprised.
---
Your first mistake is thinking you're gonna constantly get 4ks with Legion.

I had someone escape earlier because of this. Like it‚Äôs not a big deal, I wasn‚Äôt crying about it, but he was playing Adam with his darker jacket, and I could not see him for shit. The amount of times I‚Äôm positive I was looking right at him but couldn‚Äôt see him was unreal. 
---
I chased him towards Hatch, closed it in his face, but couldn‚Äôt spot him when my killer looked back up. Looked all around but the dude was practically the fucking Invisible Man all damn match. Of course, he picked up a key from where someone died on hook, and left. Whereas if I had been able to chase him when I closed hatch, he would‚Äôve been dead.
---
Like I said, not crying about it, but it‚Äôs dumb that on any other map I would‚Äôve gotten him but I literally just can‚Äôt see a fucking thing on the new one. Even when I‚Äôm just in regular chases, if they‚Äôre wearing darker clothing and run through the tall grass, I get juked so easily because I can‚Äôt fucking see lmao

QnQ is more versatile.
---
Yea, I'm a rank 1 killer and I just felt disgusting using NOED. It was such a terrible experience, I felt like Ace Ventura when he found out the chick she made out with used to be a dude.
---
That's why I said if you were going OBJ heavy. If not then Id keep everything
---
I think you're equating the phrase "a way you can play the game" with "a strategy".
---
Facecamping isn't punished by bloodpoint loss because those kinds of proximity punishments were abused by SWF groups. Facecamping isn't reportable through the system because it's not something you can really code out or account for situations where it's acceptable or not, not something you can add a system in to prevent without SWF (again, as seen in the PBT) or players in general abusing it to the detriment of the killer.
---
But it is a series of actions in the game that lead to negative reinforcement, loss of emblems, an inability to get bloodpoints for other actions (or even stack up your BBQ&amp;C) that prevents the full use of most bloodpoint-related offerings, and even (in the case of stuff like survivor pudding) only offers a very low-percentile use compared to the 32,000 BP that survivor pudding can return.
---
If we define "facecamping" as "a series of actions that you are allowed to take without being penalized or banned by the authorities in charge of the game and the rules they have set forth", you can apply that sort of argument to many other things.
---
There are **lots** of games in which you can play suboptimally to the point that you are not achieving your primary objective, or even "winning" (in Dead by Daylight, getting 2 kills and safety pipping) as defined by the developer (BHVR); that you can take actions allowed within the confines of the game that cause you to lose, and which you know (short of your opponent throwing the game intentionally, such as diving against a camping Bubba) will cause you to lose.
---
We don't consider those actions a valid strategy, the goal of Dead by Daylight is to prevent the survivors from escaping, to prevent them from completing generators, to kill at least two of them.

Anything that is a "strategy" is supposed to be a situation that is designed in consideration of the goal of your activity, rather than just something you decided to do because you could. Your own personal goals (like facecamping a survivor) and any strategy you use to achieve them are not necessarily valid strategies for winning Dead by Daylight.
---
A personal goal to take every single one of an opponent's pieces in Chess before checkmating their King is not traditionally a valid strategy for the win condition of Chess, despite being possible to attempt within the game; and while surrendering checkmate conditions in order to take other pieces may not cost you the game, it doesn't win you the game either.
---
**TL;DR: If you personally want to do something that is opposed to the established win condition of your activity, you may be employing a personal strategy towards your own personal goal, but you are not employing any valid strategy towards the established win condition of the activity, so calling it a "strategy" is inherently subjective, self-biased, wrong.**

EVERY TIME MAN ;___;

Holy fuck dude are you literally my teammate when I don't play SWF? It's a fucking team game. If you bait and stealth you WILL rank up, then you will become a detriment. Listen to what I'm saying asshat. There is no casual play, it's all ranked, so either quit the game now or learn the right way so you people like stop wasting time at higher ranks. Jesus christ I hate your mentality.
---
McSpaghetti? Cursed image
---
It is because every time you play without them, you get camped and tunnelled to death, so 3 of these perks almost feel mandatory to avoid that.
---
Usually the survivor's reaction is "OH SHIT" once they realize the obsession got mori'd (A nasty surprise since I didn't bring a secret offering) + the gates are taking forever and NOED is up.
---
That too. Obsession has been altered in recent years to be more of an upside than a downside, with the exception of Remember Me and Rancor.
---
That's because every attempt to make being the obsession be a downside has been a major disaster and unhealthy for the game.
---
Both Rancor and old Dying Light were just massive middle fingers to one survivor and incentivized the killer to tunnel them to death, ruining their experience.
---
Enable facecamping Bubba mode
---
honestly most of the perks you've given are fine where they are. I do agree with the botany knowledge one though.
---
The ability to see what perks your teammates are bringing *(especially when you're playing solo)* is something that should have been a feature from the start.
---
The thing about Nurse and why her kill rates are so low, if that she's one of the hardest killers to play. If you aren't good at her, you're going to get few kills. It would be really hard to show how strong she is statistically, because there's a lot that goes into her. I think you'd need something like time played compared to people primarily play her and only her and have a consistent rank.
---
Which platform?
---
Facecamping Bubba mode activated
---
Someone jumping into a locker to force me to eat the DS is someone who will repair a generator in front of me and force me to grab or lunge/slug them, or vault a window purposefully into me and get grabbed if I press M1 (which I do without even anything about it) while they're injured or something else, SWF make sure you eat that DS at some point and it's either right now or when the gate is wide open.
---
If I'm nearby and not in another chase I'll probably just yoink them out. They could always miss the DS, or maybe there's not a decent pallet by the locker and I can down them again. I tell myself this and hope.
---
Is clicking just a bm thing? I see teammates doing it a lot and honestly I can‚Äôt understand why they would want to waste their item lol
---
I'll be at a rank where my winrate is about 50/50. People who want to rank up at that rank I'm at will do it if they're good enough to.
---
Pipping isn't dependent on how good your team is. If you're whole team sucks, I still find it easy to pip. Do genwork, loop the killer, get saves.
---
It's not hard to pip as survivor with a bad team.
---
My man.. it's you!
---
Welcome to DbD
---
Keep me updated because I bought something a few days ago and haven't heard shit either. Good luck, friend
---
Cooler than real legion
---
So what happens if someone goes in there and has Remember Me? ü§î
---
Do you honestly think I'm comparing a pixelated PS1 image of Jill to a 2019 image? Who let you out of your gimp cage? Someone's getting fired.
---
"Fuck this, the hook was warmer."
---
Level doesn't matter much but rank, I'd only Dodge if I was red rank and everyone else was yellow/white. Anything below like green or purple I didn't mind getting paired with.
---
It's not exactly unfair. If you didn't secure a kill already it just is what it is. Don't expect them to just abandon their teammate. You have the option of endgame camping (annoying for Survivors but fair enough if it's during the endgame collapse) and NOED if you want to secure an easy kill at the end and don't care if you get grief post-game. But ultimately a loss is a loss. We can't win every match and just have to accept defeat if no one was playing dirty (looking at you, Insidious Bubba).
---
If umbra or scott are better than me, no.
---
Yeah.
---
Yea, my console data is from PS4, strange since she‚Äôs pretty much the 2nd best killer In the game I would think you would see a lot more of her. But maybe it‚Äôs because she has a decent learning curve.
---
You're hit if you're in LOS and you are in the red stain. It's the stain, not the weapon. That isn't hit boxes that's you not know what the hurt boxes are
---
How many days max did it take to receive that message?
---
This bothers you doesn‚Äôt it? Enough for you to write a novel. Geez
---
What are you talking about? Very clear connection. Super legit hit. Never seen such a clean hit.
---
Well, if I was in a 4-man, I would just immerse through the entire Corrupt for two minutes to ensure she found no one and didn't get any kind of headstart on 3-genning us, yes.
---
There are other things people are more than happy to wait out more than two total minutes for, like EW3 Myers multiple times in a row, or hiding through each of Oni's power charges.
---
I'm just suggesting that like people have learned to wait out EW3 twice at 60 seconds each rather than let Myers chain multiple downs, that people should get used to chilling out for 120 seconds to really neuter Plague's attempt at a 3-gen without letting her start infecting people and chasing them/downing them.
---
It may sound boring, but we already know survivors can immerse that well, so...
---
When you complete a gen it shows you all gens, totems, and chest in a certain area around you
---
I stg, this exact situation happened to me before - the deadhard lmao
---
add the Grim Reaper as a survivor you cowards
---
Other than using iron will; you don't. She's a coinflip everytime she phases.
---
Oh wait she was one of my teammates yesterday, the Meg was *I will DC* while the David was *One shot= DC*, the Meg did indeed DC while the David literally carried looping 80% of the match.
---
#thatsthepoint
---
It's a free win, you have to not have hands to lose on it.
---
Even the entity is pissed at you
---
yes
---
Bt changed so it activates no matter whst and runs downovertimr and faster if survivor runs
---
I think hook farming should be bannable. Like if you report it and show video evidence, 12hr ban. Obviously if you don't mind if someone farms you, or it's a friend with BT, don't report it. But there should be the option to.
---
Because he's the King!
---
Hoes mad
---
I'm a simple android; I see a Detroit meme, I upvote.
---
A lot of you are talking about things like "The survivors obviously did well, they worked hard to get objectives done, if you haven't killed someone already then it's your fault, they deserve to get it" etc.  
---
My response is, I worked fucking hard too, why does my 2 to 3 minutes of stressful gameplay, mindgaming, dealing with team mates body blocking before running to the ultra safe central structure, and pallet flashlighting count in this scenario? This isn't even counting the 8 minutes of gameplay beforehand where I had to juggle like a madman and breakoff chases because the survivors knew where multi pallet loops were (Thanks for all the badham houses Behaviour).  
---
Why are you saying that survivors who got hooked once or twice, sat on gens M1ing, and bodyblocking me, deserve that unhook more than I deserved the kill? How is that justifiable?
---
Rework legion. He looks badass, he imo my favorite killer in terms of looks and lore but man is he some hot garbage
---
I wish we could shake our heads no while on the hook. Aggressively lol.
---
Forgot Jane was L A T I N A . Need to update again
---
This is why I play Leatherface. In the end game, if a gate gets open, I stand in front of the hook with my chainsaw revved. 
---
I have a lot of experience so it usually doesn't come to this. The most that'll get out is 2. But it's one of his very useful powers. 
---
A lot of people are altruism farmers or hook bomb especially SWFs so Leatherface can get you easy downs during the entirety of the game.
---
This is genuinely a good meme. Good job my guy/girl!
---
I see Bubba is sharing his fashion tips with the other Killers.
---
It'd be hard for an algorithm to determine if that player is hook bombing or just sucks at the game. The last thing the devs want is low level players getting banned for just playing bad and not knowing.
---
Are you a wizard?
---
You need to get an actual table my guy. I see those plastic buckets holding your shit up lol
---
Great BT Definitely Needed a buff
---
There's your downvote, Dead Hard is the best IF you are in a stable lobby
---
Actually there are some bricks holding the whole thing up lol
---
You kinda looks like Michael bed sheet costume love your cosplay
---
when did they do this?
---
The most amusing thing here is how hysterical you've become. You've crafted this villainous straw man and spent several minutes furiously typing away to "destroy" it in some half-assed attempt at eloquence. It's really quite sad.
---
Do I wish for a world where hatred didn't exist? Absolutely. Do I know that world is not likely to ever exist because of humans and their own nature to revert to tribalism when they have nothing else? Bingo. 
---
You can spare me the grandstanding. Your emotionally driven attempt at a speech won't get you anywhere with me. 
---
You want to rise up against something and use the governmental cudgel against your enemies, not realizing that if that's possible, then it's entirely possible to be used against you. You don't get to wield The Ring and be immune from its power. Eventually, it gets back to Sauron, and you become its target.
---
Thought policing is a vile practice that has led to the deaths of millions of people. If you want to be an ideological fascist, then go right ahead, nobody is stopping you, but at least have the nerve to admit that's what you're doing, rather than acting like you're some sort of benevolent force fighting against the encroaching darkness. You're no moral crusader, so stop posing as one. 
---
I believe it was Voltaire who said something to the effect of "I may disagree with what you say, but I will defend to my death your right to say it." Not sure at what point you became so self absorbed that you lost the point, but hopefully you find your way back.
---
You accuse me of a whole lot of things without evidence, which is ironic because you're using your own free expression, which I vigorously defend the ability to do, yet you want to strip that of others because they don't line up with you from an ideological standpoint. If there's any monster in here, it's you, and before you craft your next straw man and accuse me of gaslighting you, at least be able to recognize you're trying to remove from someone what you yourself are using based on your own subjectivity. Simmer on that one for awhile, though I doubt it'll do anything; virtue signaling is far more important since it grants you that sweet sweet social justice cred you're so desperate to acquire.
---
I mean. It‚Äôs a Nurse on console. She gets a pass
---
Because you don't get to apply the protection of free expression when it's convenient for you. You either have principles, or you don't. Principles apply at all times, not just when it works in our favor.
---
Think of how moronic it would be to strip someone of their free expression if they were to say they hate apples, but you love apples, and your family has 10 apple orchards. It's no less moronic when you change the topic of what is being hated. So long as that person isn't trying to burn down your apple orchards, let them think and believe what they want. Thoughts require actions to *actually* be harmful, but until then, they're harmless.
---
How were you laughing together? I am new to this game and don‚Äôt know how to talk to other players!
---
&gt;Ds is good for solo survivors
---
No shit, ds is good no matter what. The killer can be playing normal and get owned by it. You are just too scared to experiment with strong perks because your crutches will break.
---
That‚Äôs stupid, only happens at awful ranks. Farming a hook hurts your team, yes it‚Äôs boring for that 1 survivor. Punishing bad play, might as well ban survivors who aren‚Äôt on a gen doing nothing.
---
Why tf was this removed by mods?
---
Why does everyone seem to hate backwater swamp (Always thought it was ‚ÄòBlack‚Äô water) I like it bc I can be a blendette
---
And there it is, the classic taking of the moral high ground.
---
You want to spout off about originality, yet you're about as clich√© as they come. I expected as much, and was not disappointed.
---
Come back if you actually have facts and data you'd like to battle over, rather than your pathetic bleeding heart nonsense.
---
Ah thats hot
---
Ok, NOW dbd got scary. Way to go devs üò±üòÇ
---
for the exact same reason but from the other side boi
---
No it‚Äôs just not good for the health of the game , why make perks insanely strong for SWFS.  A crutch means I can rely on myself, which I prefer, but you do say make BT a self perk which makes it crutch. You make no sense.
---
That‚Äôs just my exact response but smaller lol, we aren‚Äôt different. I have no high ground and you aren‚Äôt good either, that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs no point to continue the debate because it‚Äôs just us spouting opposites like it‚Äôs a big brain discussion.
---
Ninja edit because I‚Äôm bad:
---
She came out with the nurse, so technically DLC but free
---
You changed nothing about the perks?
---
Oh
---
 O.o
---
&gt; A crutch means I can rely on myself.
---
Do you even know what a crutch is?
---
Yes it‚Äôs a support you get from when you‚Äôve injured a low part of your body.
---
Then you can down the unhooker and the unhooked, hook the unhooker first, then hook the unhooked with no D strike. In that case you very much were tunneling, but circumvented the counter for it.
---
I think the main point that you don't seem to understand comes from your notion that toxicity is strategy based.  You keep bringing up face camping as a strategy, which to be entirely honest, it is.  But toxicity doesn't have anything to do with the goals set forth within the game, or strategies employed.  Toxicity is based upon general guidelines developed by the community of players, not by the devs.  In COD you can set up in a corner and camp other players until the end of time, devs don't care because they still make money, but the fan base doesn't appreciate the action.  The same can be said about flashlight clicking or an entire SWF team that just runs spine chill and urban that the killer never even sees.  The majority of players on both sides of the fence see that as dumb.  Face camping is one of those 'strategies' that isn't accepted by the majority of players on both sides of the field, Killer mains that understand the game see it as a bad strategy and know that it isn't as fun for themselves and survivors see it as a bad strategy because it makes the game impossible to enjoy. 
---
So basically what your job to do is to prove that Face camping is a strategy that both groups of players, both survivors and killers don't see as generally bad.  And that this isn't just you trying to defend your own actions in-game.
---
I mean I think they‚Äôd prefer a game than have a 47 hour queue time. Plus they did seem to do alright against you
---
Okay well on console they all come with the game until David and not licensed ones. And even David is free you just have to dl him. Maybe I bought the SE but it was like $15 on Xbox and free on ps plus when I got it.
---
Are you kidding? Go use Stake Out. Right now. Get out of bed, boot up your computer, launch the game, queue up as a survivor, wait 10 minutes, and then play a game using Stake Out at tier 1. It‚Äôs a worthless perk.
---
Edit: DS is also garbage at tier 1, it‚Äôs incredibly short.
---
I feel that 5's pain
---
Wraith. I swear i‚Äôm not a newbie i‚Äôve been playing since August 2017
---
What about me??
---
He did post it here I'm pretty sure as fanart of a custom legion blight skin he would like.
---
Yeah but yet another buff to survivor and another buff to second chance perks
---
But that‚Äôs the point I‚Äôm trying to make here, more so to the guy that is trying to say that killers aren‚Äôt underperforming at all. The November stats suggested that clown was holding a 60% kill rate while being picked about 4.3% of the time at red ranks while nurse was at a 65% kill rate while being picked about 4.7% of the time at red ranks. But that kill rate chart means nothing because we all know there‚Äôs an argument to be made that clown is possibly the worst killer in the game and that nurse is undoubtably still god tier. There are so many other statistics that play a part in the balance of this game. 
---
And just on a side note that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve mentioned yet, but somehow their data has to be fucked. Because you‚Äôre not going to convince me that in the beginning of the year that red rank survivors were escaping over 50% of the time (obviously meaning lower kill rates) but now at the end of the year the worst killers in the game are only allowing a 40% escape rate while other killers are around a 30% escape rate. Something is completely off about that to me.
---
Play weak through out the whole game, struggle late game when they can escape. Complain about it. Logic. You are right, survivors should just insta hook if they don‚Äôt leave in seconds
---
That‚Äôs because the last breath chapter (nea and nurse) came out before the console version of the game did.
---
Dates:
---
Last Breath Chapter - Aug 18, 2016
---
PS4/XBox release: June 2017
---
So you were just hiding in the basement with no one hooked? Yeah if they go down there after the gates are powered for any reason other than a save, they are forfitting their life. They definitely asked for it.
---
Your response fucking killed me :')
---
But it should've always been like that though. Not even sure if it intentional. Can't see anything on the dbd wiki BT page about this change.
---
This is fucking hard
---
I have so much to learn. I‚Äôm still relatively new to gaming in general. I got my switch last year and I‚Äôve basically only played Splatoon2 and Stardew Valley. I feel sure my daughter plays League (of Legends, right?) so I can ask her.  Also, sadly we don‚Äôt have Freddy on the switch. They also play dbd on pc but they travel now for work so I don‚Äôt see her and her husband a lot. She likes all my clips and supports me, haha.  Thanks for your help!
---
Do it Nea! We have [soul pizza](https://bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/A-Nightmare-on-Elm-Street-The-Dream-Master-Freddy-Krueger.jpg)!
---
Give decent cosmetics to Claudette instead of a new dress every season :(
---
Please tell me it has the sound effects
---
Yeah i usually get the characters to lvl40 for the teachable there are only 2 characters i have maxed out huntress cause shes my main ,claudette you know why other than those 2 i have 8 survivors and killers just stuck in lvl 40
---
Than it might be a bug if it is it needs fixing lets just leave it at Can we buff legion?
---
Oh def. I was more trying to further support the statement you had made, not argue. Sorry about that.
---
zubJAMMER

That nea is so me

\*The killer is a Bubba\*

Friend: "He just left me... guess I'm too good"

Me: *hears terror radius* "Oh lawd he comin"
---
I think switch is its own special thing
---
Cross play enabled means you can play with people who bought on Microsoft store. No cross platform yet
---
&gt; Can we buff legion?
---
I thought they just did? Not sure what they can do to him.
---
That's dbd for ya. Somehow it has such a big player base
---
don't believe everything you read online, lol. especially from a company making money off the lies.
---
To taunt the killer it's fun
---
hating apples isnt the same as hating gay people
---
They were probably SWF with the rank 5. 
---
Killer mains asked for this so I don't know whats the problem.
---
very good
---
*Reasons why kindred should be base for survivors, or what should've been added as the anti-camping mechanic*
---
Ohh okay makes sense
---
You were running NoEd, don‚Äôt lie. Only reason you blocked perks
---
There's no other way to get a 4k besides slugging and relying on RNG. It's the only guaranteed way to 4k. Using a key to open hatch is not the same as slugging for a 4k. You're using an item with no counterplay to get an unfair escape, the Killer is doing what the game forces them to do to kill everyone. This plain ignorance and lack of knowledge of what both sides need to do to win is what causes toxicity in this community.
---
Fixed?
---
I see Feng Min I upvote
---
Jesus christ. Call it. Nothing can be done.
---
I'm with you man. I think that once a survivor hits the unhook button it should commit to the action like a pallet break. Not this constant pretending to unhook shit constantly. Especially since grabs are boned right now.
---
If you fuck up a skillcheck with Ruin, stop working on the gen for 2 seconds until the sparks fade. You'll reduce your likelihood of another skill check.
---
When hitting the Ruin skillcheck (or any Great skillcheck) factor in the time it takes for your hands to react to the skillcheck marker and press your button/key. Once you get used to it, you'll be hitting multiple Hex Skillchecks easily.
---
You can also run Stakeout to gain tokens that give you an automatic Great skillcheck. Most killers tunnel their current chase so farming then is easy. You can even get away with doing a gen in their terror radius sometimes.
---
Another great perk to try is Detective's Hunch. When a gen is completed you'll basically get info on any totem spawn within 64 meters, and if you're using a map they will be marked each time you use it. There's even add-ons that will show the map auras for every survivor in the trial, so you can combo those to help your team find and stamp out Ruin in record time.
---
Joey has BBC and n-word pass
---
&gt;As for your name, ty, I'm never running a mori again.
---
b-b-but...
---
...Then what else am I supposed to get off to?!?!
---
Can't slap someone else's ass cheek and expect it not to jiggle, my friend.
---
You do realize you can combo it with Plunderers to find and loot a chest within literal seconds right? Then you can continue to loot high tier items super fast.
---
Based on looks she looks the same. Perhaps a better camera than before. I didn't watch long enough to grasp a possible change in personality though.
---
I'm in red ranks and I never use Self Care. Instead I use Kindred to show how foolish you are using it in a corner while someone is on the hook.
---
Using my ivory on clickers is also fun.
---
Bubba. Can someone please draw him? He gets no love. :(
---
All good my brother
---
With how undetectable currently works, I'm not so sure of which one is better, but Ghostface controls his ability based on "himself" (like, he can activate it without stalking survivors, but the exposed part needs to stalk them) yet however, many Ghostfaces say "fuck it" and just gen grab instead of stalking.
---
However, get this: Ghostface doesn't have a pants-less cosmetic. *drops mic*
---
Aim for greats, but Goods are better than blowing it.  If you get goods, let go for the ~2 seconds of paused progress so you don‚Äôt trigger a second skill check.  Even in the most unlucky scenario, the Gens will eventually get done if you only hit goods.  Keep an eye out for ruin while moving, but don‚Äôt waste too much time hunting it down.
---
Depending on the map/killer, you might get a clue about totem location if you can keep a decent track of the killer‚Äôs movements.  Do they keep protecting an area with no gens (especially Hag/Demo/Trapper)?  There‚Äôs a chance they‚Äôre protecting their totem.
---
In most cases, the extra time Ruin puts on gens is still less than wasted time scouring the map for the totem.
---
I love your drawing my guy, its spot on. My favorite will forever be ghostface
---
Idk, Jane's butt? Or David's crotch if you're into that.
---
ED: TIL DbD doesn't like nsfw jokes... But they do? Jane's butt comments usually get upvotes but talking about gay stuff gets downvotes. Big F in the post-game chat.
---
I said that both the sides don't need add-ons.
---
 Rework on ruin and make it such that the strength/effect of ruin depends on the progress of the killer (maybe it can depend on the number of hooks that the killer had done at any point in the game). This will remove th shitty RNG. Ruin rarely goes off I'm the first 3 minutes of the game. Mostly, the ruin stays till the end of th game. So, let RNG not mess up a skill based game.
---
probably, and there‚Äôs no problem?
---
Prove Thyself is bullshit.
---
I main both killer and survivor so I can agree
---
&gt; But toxicity doesn't have anything to do with the goals set forth within the game,
---
Back your point up with facts. You've set forward an argument based on the  definition of a word without actually defining the word.
---
I've been very clear with my definition of toxicity. If you've got an issue with that definition, please point out where specifically, or provide your definition.
---
&gt; Toxic is action(s) that cause harm to another individual with no greater objective.
---
This definition is based off of studies that sought to research toxicity in online games and were required to offer a definition of their own to remove any vagueness of the study. Mulligan and Patrovsky in 2003 defined a "griefer" as "a player who gets enjoyment from performing actions that reduce the enjoyment of the game by others **rather than playing the game itself** (bold for emphasis). Foo and Koivisto in 2004 further underlined that the griefers act is done intentionally for the sake of griefing. And while many studies to state that the definition of griefing behavior is based on perception, they almost all universally include intent and aspects outside of the game's objective as the main component of their definition.
---
Hence me putting forward the above definition that Toxicity is an action that causes harm to another individual with no greater objective. If your objective is to win the game and you pick Camping as your strategy towards that, that's your right and choice as a player and no one can take that away from you. Just because the fanbase doesn't like it doesn't immediately make it toxic because what is and is not toxic is a matter of perception - So people will see it as toxic and others will see it as not toxic. 
---
Since such defining of the action is based on opinion and bias, we cannot confirm toxicity just because Survivors don't like that Killers do something. Were that to be the case, then everything a Killer does would be classified as toxic because **some** survivor somewhere would say "I didn't have fun, this is toxic!"
---
The fanbase screams about NOED as toxic, but that doesn't make it toxic. Case in point, you bring up an entire SWF team that runs Spine Chill and Urban -- That's not toxic, that is literally just playing with mechanics built within the game. So your definition of toxic is fundamentally flawed because it is based off of people's opinions.
---
**Especially** since you have no actual data to show whether or not your claim of those opinions is valid. You're just talking out of your ass at this point. Everything you've said is anecdotal at best, or just outright personal opinion at worst.
---
-----
---
Also - My job isn't to prove that face camping isn't toxic. You want to say Face Camping **IS** toxic, you need to prove that. No argument starts with proving the negative. You claim something is toxic, you hold the burden of proof to back your claim.
---
&gt;  isn't just you trying to defend your own actions in-game.
---
Am a survivor main, so sorry. Just because I argue to defend something doesn't mean I do the thing, or even like the thing.
---
Sounds like a plane taking off?
---
Now I have to wait to turn the lights off
---
I know that Remember Me slows the gates, but I forgot how it gains its tokens
---
I just want thin mint Jeff is that so much to ask for ;(
---
Right Jesus I thought it was just me lolüòÇ
---
Its crazy how much pretentiousness exists in a casual game. People legit sweat over this game like their life is on the line, or like they hope to "go pro" in DBD. Like this games purpose is a single one, having fun. But yet you got people dodging lobbies over rank levels like "OH. MYGOSH. This PEASANT hasn't slaved away every last ounce of fuck to being the biggest and whaliest whale? Despicable! Blasphemy! How dare they breath MY, xXOwnAnus69Xx, musty and unforgiving air!".
---
How proud their parents must be lol
---
This is  also true
---
NOPE! I was concerned the first time I played. Thought my PS4 was gonna spontaneously combust.
---
Moris are already sacrificing your Devout emblem as a killer. They're not worth using from a pure gameplay standpoint and are basically just BM.
---
Only fix I want is that getting Mori'd as a survivor automatically granted you 5k points and a black pip because they still feel really shit.
---
I figured he was just trolling. I decided to dip.
---
Billy Buff looks amazing. 
---
Honestly I hope they keep this in the game just bc of how fucking hilarious it is.
---
Wait. 
---
WAIT.

WHEN DID MOBILE HAPPEN?
---
Yeah, I enjoy my builds but I know I‚Äôd get sick of Lobby dodges if they were always public.  It always annoys me that survivors are basically just skins once you unlock teachables, so I‚Äôve just manually assigned them all roles and most of them have builds centered around at least one of their own perks (Totem Hunter Nancy, Hook Rescuer Steve, Team Healer Claudette, etc) cause that‚Äôs how it feels it *should* be to me.
---
Playing the game and completing the objective within the confines of the game mechanics is not toxic.
---
Bitching and complaining that your opponent only won because of cheap tactics **is** toxic.
---
I got called a camper bc I chances a ash (the only survivors that wasn‚Äôt knocked or hooked) back to a fang Ming that was hooked and I didn‚Äôt hit him when he  baited the hit so he could unhook her.. instead I waited till he had to commit to the unhook and I grabbed
---
Him this resulted in me being called a ‚Äúpussy camping no life and u should kill myself‚Äù üòÇ 
---
I go on to check how many days they had played and if they were survivor or killer mains they all 4 had around 70 days played with 1500+ escaped and not one had more than 200 kills as killer.. survivor mains will say anything and everything to not except the fact that they messed up and that‚Äôs why they lost instead they reason they lost is bc the killer played unsportsmanlike/tunneled or camped

Might as well make lobbies have a one hour minimum wait time too while your at it
---
Yes, it‚Äôs so irritating! Apparently cleaning it helps but I don‚Äôt have the right tools to open it up.
---
That's strange, I play around the same rank, same area and same time and it's always instant for me.
---
I‚Äôd say keep doing it if you liked to not to let one person ruin it for everyone else because they are just a dumbass
---
She looks the same to me. Maybe slight hair change with different make up and now a better camera?
---
Never ran into insidious,  noed, blood warden, nurse i see.
---
That is fair, you‚Äôre right. I was a hardcore killer main since I started, and received lots of hate. I didn‚Äôt care much, but now that I‚Äôm doing survivor, I can see it a bit more. Survivor ‚Äúthat‚Äù perks often punish tunnelling (DS) and camping (BT) in vase form, while killer ‚Äúthat‚Äù perks are just good. Even then, you‚Äôre more empathetic than I am, so good on you. I play the game for the rush, as others do too, so I just assume the angry players LIKE to feel that anger.
---
Those are the game mechanics. If enough survivors are up that you have an issue controlling that situation, you made a mistake and are being punished for that mistake.
---
If you find yourself having a problem with the situation, there are perks you can use to alleviate the weakness. Choosing not to use them is on you.
---
Survivors should have a chance just like Killers should. Yes, things are survivor sided, but even still. If you lose because the survivors used the mechanics and got away, that's not bullshit, that's the game.
---
Are you playing survivor?
---
so cute
---
f
---
I just love finishing a gen and watching her goblin silhouette hobble across the map lol.
---
Both sides
---
Follow the survivors rules you dumb ass killer pleb!
---
This sub (and ahem, the sister sub) needs more of Best Girl.
---
all good.
---
I'll honestly give it a try. I have been suggested this in the past, but never did it because it goes against my personal ideals of enjoyment. Your comment was a unique, objective approach. Very persuasive :)
---
I'm dying right now haha, all I see is her little hobble
---
I mean... Big Steve don't run from a bitch in a bunny mask... How'd you not know that?
---
Does it stack with boiled over ?
---
okay but I mean like right now. I'm actually playing the game right now
---
Maybe because camping is a huge problem,  and we deserve a chance? Wow. Lol. Like I hope you're being sarcastic. Like yeah, so a campers can just snatch the person and have someone new to camp, makes sense.
---
Why are you stalking people's profiles? That's creepy.
---
I‚Äôve had a recent game earlier and it kind of just made me not want to play another match. 2 of my teammates were yellow ranks and there was a purple rank. It‚Äôs not really fun for me when I have teammates who can only last 10secs in a chase. Getting slaughtered is just a bad feeling.
---
First off, you can fuck right off bitch.  I didn't disrespect you before but you've totally lost mine.  I never said people couldn't tunnel I'm just voicing that it's not fun for survivors and they should rethink.  I don't think giving up a seat is a good analogy, because that implies giving up face camping leads to losses.  It's more like when you have your bag on the seat next to you, and you give it up for someone.  That way you can both be slightly comfortable instead of you being very comfortable and the other person not being comfortable at all.
---
And I will not be gaslighted by you man.  I'm never going to feel bad for telling people they should let others have fun too.  That's how I see things.  They don't have to listen to what I have to say, but I'm going to say it because people work too damn hard to have their gaming time be unfun because of people who play the game in that way.  It's not needed (unless in specific situations) and I don't believe it's how the game was intended to be played.
---
This whole idea that just because it's a game means people shouldn't get emotional over it is stupid.  People get upset over sports, racing, cooking competitions, etc. because it's something they are passionate about.  I'm allowed to get upset over a game if my fun is being robbed and I think there is a correlation to what is robbing it.  When I put time and money into a game, it should be somewhat enjoyable.
---
I never said I thought I was better than you so I don't know where you got that from xD
---
All i can imagine is the people lobby dodging when they see someone with perks they don't like.  WGLF? Nah fam, not farming me. Self-Care? Nah, i need to heal people, next. And yes, i know people that would lobby dodge over dumb shit like that.
---
He shook his head too, he was so confident and left with nothing but embarrassment.
---
I'm a survivor main and even I know to just simply run. Survivors, especially SWFs, all have this unwritten survivor handbook up their ass that says, "Don't hit injured players in front of healthy ones. Don't hit survivors being unhooked. Don't chase survivors that are being healed." Killer is supposed to win IMO and if they start acting like a baby precious when they didn't get healed after two hooks then it's on them. Let 'em whine OP, just say "ggs" and exit lobby.
---
No lies detected
---
 Never mind for some reason I thought boil over increased wiggle speed üòÇ
---
Bless your soul
---
Lol
---
If it takes MULTIPLE people to commit the unhook,  then THEY worked hard to. You aren't the only one in the match. Lolololol.
---
Survivors who get unhooked and sit selfcaring at the hook and stare at you not running away then bitch that you dont pick them up and eat DS are my favourite.
---
The Billy Space Program is an astounding success
---
You're supposed to be able to hit  survivors on the other side of windows. That's like, a thing thats been in the game the whole time.
---
omg that beautiful face lol
---
Got a lot of respect for you, mate. Thank you.
---
You go stabby and stabby and stabby and maybe i just wanna stab ppl ay? Trapper puts me under so much pressure sometimes so legions nice and easy
---
I think they meant through chat at the end. If you are on PC the lobby allows text chat with everyone in the trial survivors and killer. There is no voice chat in this game. 
---
I suggest typing gg no matter the outcome though :)
---
And I see a floating head and hands, lol.
---
Bill didn't fight in World War II he fought in Vietnam.
---
I was playing until like 20 minutes ago haha
---
I say we all petition for Danny to be a survivor...
---
Or killer?
---
I got a lot of respect for myself too!
---
Though my jokes need work.
---
Good luck in the mist! If I see you, I'll only teabag with the deepest respect from my heart. ;-)
---
I like how you're getting down voted for saying someone's political views doesn't matter in the current conversation lmao. I didn't realize how many SJWs played this game, let alone were on this subreddit.
---
I fap to murder. lmao ü§£
---
I hope you run Wake Up.
---
It's bad on Xbox too. Wish they would do cross play just for the increase player base.
---
Bought my first DLC since Legion getting Oni, Behavior starts beating him up with the nerf-hammer. 
---
I am not even surprised at this point. Just disappointed.
---
Steve should've been labeled as dessert. Missed potential. 3/10
---
Exactly Legion need a rework as soon as possible and I really hope that they end up donating an entire chapter to that rework because let's be honest it feels like shit to have new killers constantly releasing when you're main is fridged.
---
What I was trying to get across is that I desperately want Legion in a better place because I love them thematically and from an aesthetic design, but I also know that that better place wont come without a full rework of their power. All the buffs we get are gonna be bittersweet because they have to come with nerfs to maintain player enjoyment.
---
And we all happy it's coming.
---
Steve is ice cream
---
Kate is roadkill
---
Look it's not my fault for camping you when your dumbass teammates keep trying to farm you and keep failing miserably
---
i had my sound off the first time i watched it and thought the parts where the video stopped my computer was fking up lol
---
This is god damn spooky.
---
The killer ended up dcing after adrenaline popped in for the other 2
---
"It's just a game" is just the mantra of people who know their behavior is unacceptable
---
That weapon though looks like a sledgehammer shotgun.
---
SAME HERE! Thought I was the only one. It has made playing way less fun.
---
Her voice is so god damn good too.
---
DCing before the game starts
---
Was I in the Wraith one with you. Amoreline1. If not we had really similar games
---
This made me laugh way too hard. Incredible job.
---
Nah, but wow that's a weird coincidence
---
how did they nerf freddy? if you are referring to his rework that was a clear buff... unless you are talking about something else i didn‚Äôt know about.
---
They nerfed his slow down addons like two days ago
---
Yeah this person just let us win and get points. Even showing me stuff lol.
---
Quite some time
---
please no.
---
...yes
---
I honestly had a whole 30min rant a out how trash matchmaking was, then I finally realised I didn't search... The big sad was soon to come.
---
Now that's a lie. Playing the 2 tutorial sections give you enough bp to reach level 5/6. People who play characters in lvl 1 are either throwing, or don't know the tutorial gives bp.
---
Ah, weird it still showed the skull instead of the dc
---
bruh wtf
---
All 4 of them!
---
Did you literally just compare gay people to apples
---
But IMO it should only display during loading screens, because if it displayed in lobby, some survs would def dodge some other survs.
---
b r u h   It's just mean.  Someone spends all that time queueing up, spending and offering and item, looking forward to a fun experience and you're going to make their game last less than 5 minutes.  If you patrol gens well you can have a 4v1 with 4 gens left to do and if survivors are smart, your face camping will lead to 3v1 with 2 gens left.  I don't think that's a better situation to be in, plus the fact that you are completely fucking over somebody's enjoyment.  I think that is toxic.  Ruining someone's game to do something that you don't need to do in order to enjoy the game yourself or win.
---
Throw in some charms, and I'll throw in my wallet.
---
Most of this community is dumb as hell so that doesn't really mean much
---
In the mobile you don't level up with no you level up by playing the character so everyone starts at level one with everyone one
---
Yeah holy shit ikr. I HATE it when a survivor uses a perk that is DESIGNED to help them and they get up using a perk. This is so toxic smh.
---
lol nice. yeah when ure an afk killer ppl get bored and look for u. nice touch with them all being in a row
---
I'm a new player, what does this mean?
---
The L E G I O N
---
I like the idea of the animitronics lugging themselves around like they do in that fan game Joy of Creation. No idea what the power would be but it would be cool.
---
Should be "screams in camper"
---
What perk is that, where you can revive yourself?
---
No0b3 üòÇ
---
Legend
---
It's fun when you're high, I just don't T-bag. Im not blueface, I'm not trying to get disrespectful lol.
---
I got my first flashlight save after 1,959 hours and it was merely for the flashlight challenge. üôÉ
---
I'm trying for the challenge now. I never really brought in flashlights before so it's a real challenge for me lol. Especially in the higher ranks where the killers know to turn their face away üò≠
---
Cue the Trapper grunt
---
I just hit 1 milli !! Just started the game like 3 weeks ago. Crazyyy
---
Now who to spend it on is the hard question.
---
Sure... Unfun. Unfortunate. 
---
BUT NOT TOXIC. Toxic is outside the realm of the objective. The killer killing a survivor isn't toxic, ***it's the fucking game.*** The killer killing that survivor first, or quickly, or however they do so isn't toxic, ***it's the fucking game.***
---
&gt;I think that is toxic. Ruining someone's game to do something that you don't need to do in order to enjoy the game yourself or win.
---
Good.. You've provided a definition. You're wrong, but at least we can start somewhere.
---
Pallets are unnecessary. So those are toxic.
---
Flashlights. Toxic.
---
Toolboxes. Toxic.
---
Perks? Toxic.
---
Offerings and Addons? Toxic
---
Generators? Not needed to win or enjoy the game, right? We all see Blendettes playing without touching those, and they have fun and survive! So generators are now toxic.
---
So how wrong your definition is? Because anyone can say "You ruined my game" you've left your definition of toxic up to people's opinions.
---
There are killers that don't like flashlights or toolboxes. There are survivors who say burning an addon ruins the game. There will always be someone who says "Such and such is unfun and ruins the game." So your definition includes everything.
---
Good try though. At least we finally got an actual definition out of you... After how many comments?
---
Also - Please note: You're not responsible for my fun. I'm not responsible for your fun. No one is responsible for anyone else's fun. Requiring someone to reduce their fun for the sake of another player is wrong because no one can dictate how anyone else plays the game outside of the mechanics of the game and bannable actions.
---
Feel free to readjust and try again. I'm 100% certain you'll find yourself getting closer and closer to my offered definition of toxicity over time.
---
it‚Äôs always the fucking Nea
---
no0b3 seems more popular
---
this sub lowkey hates him though
---
Unbreakable. It's a teachable from 'Bill' Overbeck. Another perk that you can pick yourself up is No Mither.... but avoid No Mither unless you want to give yourself a challenge.
---
Hitting the obsession adds four seconds each hit to a max of sixteen. Opening the door is not slowed down by the obsession though, so killing them means nobody can circumvent it.
---
Bruh dont complain....some may say high rank players are worse than low ranks bcuz many of them like to farm and sandbag whereas low ranks are just trying to get high rank so many take it seriously
---
If I would see more than 2 people running self-care I would dodge too
---
Try Dead By Daylight! Only On "WWW.Cooldeathgames.com"
---
This is pretty cool, sorry, who‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs not Nea tho?
---
Bill doesn't consume food he survives on pure cigs
---
You still don't understand even what I'm arguing **and** what you're arguing against, do you?
---
I'm arguing that **NO ONE** has the right to dictate how another person plays. That includes killers, survivors, me, you, anyone. Everyone has the freedom to play this game how they want to play within the confines of the game mechanics and based on what BHVR has stated are bannable actions.
---
You're arguing that past those things (game mechanics and bannable actions) certain people get to tell certain other people how to play and what they can and can not do, based on... What? Fun? Enjoyment?
---
You're literally trying to strip people's freedom away and you somehow think you're the wholesome, compassionate one.
---
Still nothing but a hypocritical, judgmental asshole.
---
And you wouldn't be matched against me **BECAUSE I'M A SURVIVOR MAIN**. I don't know how many times I need to tell you that. I'm a survivor main and I'm still defending killers, because it's the right thing to defend a person's right to play how they want to play (within the confines of the game mechanics and bannable actions).
---
9 time out of 10, Claudettes gets hit, and then prepares to selfcare for 3 minutes cause the killer is running sloppy, only to get instantly hit and waste more time. People who run selfcare just don't understand how bad it is compared to Inner Strength and Pharmacy.
---
What do you play on? I have a group that would gladly help you out
---
i think that about sums it up
---
Welcome to the club, I also play perk roulette in red ranks.
---
I just recently discovered Noob3 and I enjoy his content! He‚Äôs entertaining and looks good at the game. Why does the sub dislike him? I‚Äôve never heard of the other guy, though.
---

---
Happy cake day!
---
yeah dude that's exactly how you play legion. you injure everyone and use the killer instinct if you're sure someone else is close by. when everyone's injured, you turn into an m1 killer with no power.
---
If you so much as express an opinion you get downvotes here
---
What about it? They're 2 different memes about the same thing
---
Or Plague with Incense.
---
Probably because looping = toxic

Aw man, im on xbox unfortunately. There is a server for a looking for group.

---
I am :)
---
Thanks! :D
---
Still there, open his profile and look to the right, it gives a list of subs he mods.
---
Hillbilly is the only balanced killer in the game, having good counterplay and a high skillcap that rewards skilled players with high kill power.  The rest of the killers are either underpowered or lack enough counterplay to be fun to play against and are overpowered.
---
That switch under the lever is pretty smart.
---
i'd not mind
---
bro what nea is the hot one
---
I hooked bill (i think, didn't know who the surv was) yui saved him immediately after so i downed him. He had ds, 12 ish seconds later i drowned him again. yui, nea, and ace was body blocking hook so i started hitting them. Everybody got hurt before bill wiggled off. I downed nea then downed yui, then hooked yui. Bill was Trying to sabo hook and ace was trying to pick up nea. I downed bill then downed ace. The guy who messaged me was nea(i think)
---
Giorno's piano theme starts playing...
---
Pretty much NEED blood warden or if you‚Äôre lucky enough slug 2 persons and open the gate yourself and then hook. Or slug 2, at least one has to be on death hook and face camp the other.
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a bug but i‚Äôve noticed recently when i‚Äôve gone up against a Wraith the terror radius stays for like an additional 5 seconds after he‚Äôs cloaked. Didn‚Äôt use to be like that but I guess that‚Äôs why BT activated.
---
Hank voice, knowing I should put pressure on gens instead of giving chase: ‚ÄúDo not go after them!!‚Äù

---
Yes. I kill trash.
---
Can't wait to buy Freddy to complete a tome challenge
---
It takes a couple seconds to type that much. It's not my fault you hunt and peck in 2019.
---
As for it bothering me, of course it does. This tired boring shit gets heavily upvoted only for another one to pop up the next day. It's tired and stupid, and clearly there isn't any code or etiquette people go by.
---
You either give hatch or you don't. It's that simple. Next.
---
Damn I want it so much now :(
---
she looks towards me until the very last second. Hard to see though
---
Hmmmm -----^
---
*Whats gibby thinking about*
---
Because legion keeps getting nerfed. Atleast it seems that legion and ghostface players go hand-in-hand
---
this comment is funnier than the actual meme
---
you play with some toxic idiot who has 1-2 perks and kills himself on the first hook, I'll gladly wait.
---
I used the key üîê on the hatch and escaped, but it didn‚Äôt count as a depleted key. So mad I wasted a purple key.
---
Thank you lmao.  You are a wise man.  u/Desdomen assumes if it's in the game we're not allowed to complain about it.  Sometimes you're able to do things in games that ruin the fun for everyone
---
KYF exists for a reason use it.Douchebags like you are the ones who die on the first hook, can't function without SWF, lie and claim they are solo. Or have that Kung PO mentality where they think losing is winning. Not everyone is use to sucking ass as you are customed to failure.
---
Probably because there‚Äôs a lot of dust building up in the air vents.
---
The way David is crouching looks so accurate lmao
---
Imagine if (on top of that), he can pick up survivors, then cross the door, hang them just for the survs get back to the match (maybe while the escape animation is playing) on the hook...
---
Speaking of hanging things, do you think it‚Äôd be possible to make a basement hook set?
---
Has nothing to do with rank reset.
---
Rly?
---
Ay
---
Ive found when i went for evil incarnate that i would get fake grabs when trying to mori people...
---
Yep, that was the same story here.
---
Yep, disgusting 1154 x 1080 resolution
---
Never
---
Every. Goddamn. Time.
---
Because nobody wants to play with me and my no mither build :[
---
NOW YOU'RE PLAYIN WITH POWER!
---
I love it how ppl feel like they‚Äôre so entitled to the save they just kill themselves trying to save one person.  One person with bt is all it takes; if you get knocked down with 2 of your buddies flocking towards save I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre in any position to talk this mans just butthurt
---
Wraith top 4 btw
---
At that point you are legion with mobile insidious
---
Ha! This meme thinks this is relatable, friends, ha!
---
Yep I got this last night, hooked someone, could hear someone running behind me, looked for them after the hook, the other two bum rushed the hook, so I stayed as the whole team was at the hook, get called a camper end game.
---
CALLING YUI
---
Monto is a bit too childish in my opinion.
---
Only once that I can remember, becayde they had unique and memorable names. It was three of them. I morid them as Ghost Face like four months prior, so I had to do it again. I messaged one of them about it. Turns out only 2/3 of the ones I recognized were in a group, but I know it was against those three at the same time. Shit be crazy.
---
I know and like killers are faster than survivors too it‚Äôs bullshit how are we supposed to win
---
Legion mains be bringing sloppy butcher and thanatophobia and be going on a frenzy every 2 mins. The most boring killer to play against when all your doing is mending/healing all game.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
I jumped off in his face lmao i wanted to do this üò≠ i jsut didnt know random was gonna hop in locker after me
---
Higher and lower ranks have longer queue times.
---
Idk why but reminds me of Lisa from PT...
---
the auric cells required to buy this is was actually 5$. And I had enough left over for a 2nd skin. Seems like BHVR learned that skins don‚Äôt have to be so expensive especially for a 40 dollar game lmao
---
A legion without sloppy butcher or thanataphobia? A rare sight indeed...
---
I hate how accurate this comment is. Legion's power needs a full rework or a full replacement. Legion just becomes braindead as soon as you injure everyone. A new ability would be interesting, yeah, but what would that be? Or if they reworked their ability, how would they do it? I have so many questions that I need answered, as Legion right now is just... Not fun for any parties involved.

I just consider it the farming tax if it‚Äôs a 4 man still, I let survivors get pallet saves, do gens, get max points, get safe unhooks, whatever, they‚Äôll pip. I won‚Äôt take my farming tax if it‚Äôs 3 people or less, unless I don‚Äôt like someone
---
Yeah but usually if I remember you, it's because you were a toxic piece of shit and I'm bringing a mori just for you, or tormenting your entire survivor team with 3-gen doctor with a Jigsaw Piece.
---
Possibly but he went down in 0.001 seconds lol

Oh holy üòÇüòÇ (I play on ps4 If you ever see fragolata it's me and I am never toxic just really friendly ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°)

Yeah I'm incredibly sorry of assuming so much things. To be honest I was on 2 hours sleep and didn't really think about it. I hope that you can forgive my foolishness

*Incoming whinging survivor mains*

i can‚Äôt stop playing her after i bought the sweater ( ‚ó†‚Äø‚ó† )
---
If they are only flickering the flashlight it is mostly a bm thing, like saying "haha, look I stunned you! You suck!"
---
I would guess that most people that use it this way don't really use the flashlight otherwise so they use them up in their own way.
---
She's so cute
---
Dang dude how far did you zoom in for that
---
Look up videos on how to loop as a killer or survivor and/or figure it out in game fast. Honestly the #1 thing you will need to know.

Just imagine him in his underwear... OH MY GOD HE'S HOT

I never played him pre-nerf, so I can't miss what I never had, but he's a top 3 killer for me. He's just so fun, and he's still strong.
---
Read that slowly... Now read it from a teenager boys POV. Think about it.
---
Score! Thank you so so so much! :)
---
The ability to kill doesn't make you smart XD
---
LEGIT think I had the same guy message me tonight!! Did he call you ugly by any chance?!

It‚Äôs just a little ridiculous. Sometimes the survivor entitlement  gets annoying. People actually want to see   the spirit as she phases and that defeats the purpose of the fact that she‚Äôs pretty much a mind game killer and if you take that away she‚Äôs useless. If every killer is easy to counter or go against there is no challenge for the game at all.
---
But I'm 23.
---
So? I'm 15
---
Damn you're right.
---
That neck ain't playing around
---
Yeah, so toxic! hurdurdur.. "I don't understand what I did to deserve this." hur dur..
---
When you can‚Äôt decide which killer you feel like playing
---
Ehh what is the point you are trying to make?
---
Actually I just noticed that long neck combined with the hat makes it look like a mushroom
---
Yeah, what another guy said. He fought in the Vietnam war. Bill is old, but not that old
---
I've had this a couple times with nurse, scared the frick outta me
---
That normal people will have a hard time repairing (as Patrick is demonstrating) while Ruin is active
---
"Escaped"
---
As a loyal blendette, good ridance. Toolbox for life. 
---
Amazing story telling tho :)
---
It's extremely difficult for me to rank up when so many of the randoms I play with get downed within the first 30 seconds to a minute lol
---
Are they the only survivors you have? I think your asking what perks are worth getting?
---
Happy cake day
---
Why Ela and not our glorious, gifted, handsomely handsome, number one waifu Tachanka?
---
depends if you play solo or swf personally i don't use it either but i play swf or use inner strenght (nancy) to heal.
---
Hentai version when?
---
Yeah. Toxic Claudette who saved me on second hook and body blocked me to deathhook. I saw her like an hour later while doing a daily for spirit. Camped because I was angery
---
I don't like toxic Claudettes üôÑüôÑ
---
Legion pins are total ass. Legion add-ons are total ass. Whereas other killers get cool add-ons like "Infinite tier 3 of evil within" or "Completely silent Bing bong bell" the best legion has is breaking pallets when they vault, or seeing gen progress. Something similar to the fragrant tuft would be awesome on legion, like Infinite feral frenzy until you deactivate it. Obviously not perfect, but a step up from what we've got, and with a few Nerfs could genuinely help the "Buff legion" situation.
---
/s ?
---
Demigorgon should be protected at all costs no one should harm him he‚Äôs just trying his best to be a killerüòî
---
Wasn‚Äôt even bright color. Just there and body blocked the vault every single time.
---
My advice is save around 200,000. Try not to go below and honestly spend them the way you like, check out all the perks and see what suits you best.
---
Try to conserve I remember when I had that many I blew threw them in like 2 days, but also do spend some before playing another game because you‚Äôre capped and it‚Äôd be a waste. have fun
---
Freddy's seen some shit.
---
Thats how it works, when the trapper hits you in the trap, he deals a health state of damage, which Mettle of Man can proc on.
---
If he grabbed you instead, you wouldn't have gotten MoM to proc, and would have been picked up instead.
---
When you want to play Freddy, Hag, Pig, and Hillbilly, but cant decide
---
Why are people like that 
---
I once played as Claudette and feng min was there too. She wanted to snitch on me the whole time I guess because I had a key or something? And she bodyblocked me the whole time. Killer saw that, killed her and let me escape ^^
---
That man straight up found the way outta the entities realm lol.
---
Solo pretty much. I just got 1 mill so I'm struggling to decide. I just made a post with my Survivor levels
---
Hes obvs doing it cause you haven't activated windows /s
---
May I ask why you hate playing against him? No hard feelings, just curious.
---
there were ideas of making them like they were in their trailer -- disguising as survivors, though he'd then be shit tier with tryhard 4man swf on discord. 
---
if we were to keep their "feral" part... uh.. it's hard to come up with anything tbh. but deep wound 100% needs to go. it's a bad mechanic.
---
The visual feedback is a big nerf to the Huntress since her humming's direction is always shown meaning that you always know where she is.
---
The visual feedback also shows you the Hillbilly using his chainsaw, doctor with his electric sounds and even the direction of a phasing spirit.
---
Yea I just got the game and dont think ima be buying any survivors for a while
---
I'm a killer main btw, I always try to let them have the extra BP when I play survivor cause I know the feels bad of getting stomped
---
I‚Äôm glad you agree.
---
For comparison Mikey can kill a survivor instantly within a minute and a half with a tombstone piece (6000bp) and legion gets a shitty piece of paper that decreases the mending timer. 
---
May not be the ENTIRE problem with Legion, but it‚Äôs a really big part of it.
---
It‚Äôs not possible
---
Not really, while it was intended to match you with a rank 10 killer, the game still matched you with a rank 20 killer.
---
Pretty much this.
---
That last sentence. I first started playing around the Legion mid-chapter update, and saw videos of instablinds and pallet vacuums and old Brand New Part and thought it was ridiculous, but thought Decisive Strike and Mettle were balanced. The game‚Äôs in a much better state with less ‚Äúget out of jail free‚Äù cards, and I‚Äôm completely fine if they go after keys and mori‚Äôs next. Both end the game early and are, in my opinion, really stupid and unfun to go against and need to be adjusted.
---
Sexiest killer in the game
---
Change my mind
---
No I don't. The regular, basic cosmetic was selected upon switching to that character. The lunar event cosmetics I used to have disappeared.
---
That's how Bubbas show love to survivors üòç
---
I hate playing against some killers but the only one I complain about now is gf (not to the player cause it‚Äôs not their fault, his reveal mechanic is so weird and it pisses me off but oh well), but don‚Äôt act like it‚Äôs just survivors complaining about killers. Killer mains bitch a lot too, sometimes well within their right (old ds, pallet vacuums, etc) and sometimes for the sake of it (BT, gen speeds, I have had people complain about exhaustion perks, not a specific one or anything, just...exhaustion perks). Like OP said, this community is a mess
---
Imo having Reddit or chat at the touch of a finger when you just got out of a match that pissed you off is the reason of such complains/toxicity, cause people react with their anger/frustration in the heat of the moment and spread the...well, shittyness
---
Not sure I understand.
---
More than Legion?
---
as one person put it, "fashion travesties"

And damn do we love it
---
Just get everyone to lvl 40 and do not prestige. i got everyone at 50 now and  got a p3 ace with all perks and now i'm leveling my survivors to p3 by playing ace. Don't forget to do the challenges aswell for both sides. the 4 pages are like 3.6M BP, 1 and 2 are super easy, 3 will take some time and 4 will be released in 3 days.
---
"YOU FORGOT THE POWER GLOVE!"
---
It‚Äôs on mobile? I can‚Äôt find it!? I have IOS
---
Nope, his psn did start with a D and end with an 0 tho
---
Why. Not prestige
---
You're welcome OP. I see you're glad you changed it to clicking!
---
Survivors: Adrenaline, DS, and annoyingly so, even in fucking red ranks, Self Care. 
---
Killers: Ruin, pop, bbq more often than not
---
THIS
---
Probably because it's a dead meme that this community has been dragging on for years now.
---
Sorry my photoshop is cheeks I really tried lol
---
Nea&gt; Every other female survivor
---
A lot of killers make the mistake of walking straight to the totem when the match starts as well. If the game just started and they beeline to something, check for a totem there.
---
Beautiful , just beautiful
---
Unfortunate, everybody will always have / find a thing to complain about
---
Eh, both would work it's just flashing leaves more to interpretation and yeah people would probably eventually look at it that way. lol
---
I played against a Susie just last night with the most awful connection. Maybe it‚Äôs the same one lol
---
You know what. I think that could actually work
---
I do sometimes. If I have two downed survivors left, I give hatch to the one that seems newer or less of a dick.
---
Blood warden is just extra protection in case you need the extra 60 sec to finish off the last survivors. Getting the gate open is enough work on it's own, blood warden will make it that much harder.
---
You heard hot for teacher?
---
Devs: That‚Äôs enough to make them shut up and be content... For now.
---
Usually I just hit killers with a good ol gg ez if I win
---
This is the best pic of Dwight I've ever seen XD
---
Don‚Äôt remind me :(
---
I don't know what this OchiDO is, but it sounds obnoxious.
---
New Survivor Perk "Fuck this game"
---
Once/Twice/Twice in the trial you can hook yourself on the nearest hook. "Fuck this game" has cool down of 99999/60/30 seconds.
---
"I am so fucking tired of you Dwight, get the fuck out of that locker" ~ Jake Park
---
Really? It happens *all the time* to me.  You can walk up behind the rescuing survivor, hit them in the back, and nothing happens.
---
There's something of an art to actually being able to hit the survivor as they unhook.
---
Teammate is down!
---
I had a run with more braindead than toxic, but yeah, rank reset hitting on a weekend messed everything up I think
---
I have a bug that whenever I try to play survivor the first match since I opened the game always disconnects me during loading. Has been going on for weeks now, shits weird
---
This happened to me too but two people left and a trapper showed mercy too
---
During the PTB the oni could spin a full 180 when lunging out of his charge, it's usually called a flick by most people. Everyone knew this had to be nerfed cause it was insanely powerful. So when oni dropped on live servers, they made it so you could not go past a 90¬∞ turn. 
---
Which everyone agreed was a fair balance and as long as you were smart, oni couldn't easily down you while in his rage mode.
---
Now with NO PRIOR WARNING they decided a few days ago to nerf his flick AGAIN and made it so the turn doesn't kick in until the very last milliseconds on the end of his flick. Making his chase potential dogshit. It's impossible to hit anyone that is remotely to your side.
---
Now oni went from a balanced unique killer to billy but a billy that can't bump into walls and has to wait for his power. I hope they fully revert this change cause not only was it stupid, they didn't even consult people. I was in the middle of p3'ing him and then this drops, now I dont want to even touch the fucker, that's how bad he feels compared to before.
---
If there is any nerf I'd argue for, it would be to make it so he can bump into objects and walls if you meet them at a 45¬∞ - 90¬∞ angle. Good oni players almost never make contact with walls and Bad oni players can take advantage of this, resulting in moments where oni "fakes" one direction and goes another.
---
For real, I have been seeing more legions than since release. I‚Äôm starting to think people are playing them out of spite (you nerf us we gonna play them even more!) lmao
---
What kinda weird ass babies you've encountered with?
---
Basement Bubba: *furiously swinging chainsaw and making autistic noises*
---
This is probably the most toxic DbD player that has ever existed. He is vocabulary definition of toxic survivor main.
---
This is my average solo survivor match, no matter if ruin is active or not. Its usually me who does the first gen.
---
Adaptive?
---
*raises hand* I've always done this. I pick the survivor up, wait a second, and if they wiggle I kill them. I want to make sure survivors don't start urban evasioning while looking for the hatch and prolonging the game for another 10 minutes.
---
You can run Small Game if you don't know the totem spawns yet.
---
With more SPEEEEEEDD
---
Or at least add this information into the ESC menu, like they did with the offerings. There is still much unused space, and would not clutter the ingame UI. They already stated this back when they added the addon to the Items into the ingame UI.
---
It's probably not ideal, but at least it's some kind of variety. I'm tired of playing against the same ruin-bbq-noed combo every game...
---
Thats a weird way to write "Inner Strengh" at the right
---
Ok Boomer
---
Ash has so many good cosmetics and outfits he could get, with the sweater being added and what seems like a few new voice lines, there may be hope for more (at the very least, ash vs evil dead) outfits.
---
Thanatophobia is insane on Plague
---
I have a different story, due to my place having 3 WiFi‚Äôs and each one being good for different things, I was connected to a different WiFi and everything was shit. 
---
After I hit a guy the game just closed. I tried explaining but he didn‚Äôt listen to me, I mean I don‚Äôt blame him because this is not fucking normal lol. But what hacking killer would just hit and dc as well.
---
Nope, Suns like that are normalizing hatred towards marginalized groups.  Ignoring it will let it grow and foster.
---
&gt; Steve - Toxic Sludge
---
Excuse me what? Are you saying Steve "The Hair" Harrington is toxic? No he's obviously ice cream.
---
you're a.. you're a fucking idiot!
---
Unpopular opinion: saying that a killer is "A" tier implicitly means it's not balanced. If killers were balanced there would be no tiers, expect in particular situations.
---
Legion chasing anyway: "28 STAB WOUNDS"
---
Survivors be like: 
---
Party streamers
---
Bound Envelope
---
Hearing Ash speak was fun at first. But now I just find it irritating to the point that I don't want to play as him anymore &amp; wish there was a way to turn them off. 
---
I feel like any other characters with voice lines added will be the same, they will end up being repetitive &amp; eventually annoying.
---
WOA-
---
[there ya go](https://i.imgur.com/YZk8nYV.jpg)

DAT ASSSSS
---
Otz basically coined this, it's pretty much the only viable way to play Mr Tum Tum
---
Might aswell go to bloodlust 3 in every chase then aswell
---
You sound a bit too young to be playing this game. But nice video.
---
Not about that, look at pandemonium‚Äôs comment. See anything wrong with it?
---
You filthy camper /s
---
i mean realistically placing traps around a hooked survivor is a bad idea so the game was right in denying you the good trapper award
---
Well this happens like every other match. I wish they made the challenges a bit more, well, challenging.
---
GOT EM
---
....Alright, so picking up a disabled trap and setting it up in the same place means I'm not a good trapper?
---
Guess I should have left it there, god forbid I use my already limited power.
---
The same meme applies to survivors using cakes as well. So nothing unusual there.
---
Remember the good old times when Streamers were common?!
---
If you don't get a down before the first gen pops its over if everyone is playing perfectly. Perfect play is expected for 90% of survivors given the low skill ceiling for survivor. A perfect M1 Oni is not going to down a guy before gen 1 vs a perfect survivor. 0 mistakes made and the Oni loses. 
---
That being said if you are fighting the minority of survivors that still make mistakes after the game being out for x years then the Oni's mechanics are geared toward snowballing.
---
TLDR: Dude is on the money.
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
I'm not even going to try the challenges after this tome, getting my blight skins and Trapper weapon then I'm done. They just make the game even more of a grind than it already is. Wasting matches trying to do them just makes the game unfun for everyone.
---
Power glove?
---
r/unexpectedskyrim
---
Am I the only one who isn't even that good and hasn't found the challenges to be too bad minus a couple of the old lvl 3 ones?
---
I do have that as well, i have it since the dedicated servers hit stable tho.
---
Basically me and my potato teammates every game.
---
Ps4
---
Major performance issues when playing the Demogorgon
---
This is filthy good fun, I love it
---
correct. You should of picked it up and then put it somwhere else, you just improved my point. Putting down a trap in the exact same place that they disarmed it, which means they know about it, means your a terrible trapper.
---
Always right
---
They're both hot
---
so either he‚Äôs bad or you lag. not impressive
---
Guess I'm hotter than nea
---
Let me be da baby, then they underestimate the baby     
---
###HUE HUE HUUUEEEE
---
That's understandable on mobile but i was referring to PC.  People already want to be able to see ranks so they can dodge lobbies that aren't evenly matched,  being able to see perks, items etc would just mean more people dodging.
---
There are only slight changes and the descriptions are different.
---
What did it cost?..
---
Friendly reminder that she's NOT using a helmet while going 80 mph
---
Play with your food got nerfed in his description where if a survivor gets a skill check it loses a token which would be terrible as play with your food is already pretty bad. And he made STBFL get a token with stuff like demogorgon pounce

yes. all it does is unlock the next level.

Pretty good job so far
---
This is the edit to make his suit look darker lmao, still wish it was in the game
---
dbd is on mobile?
---
Isn't the math to get dying light to equal a full thanat team 6 stacks ?
---
So 2 stacks for one injury, which you get upon hitting them vs hooking a non obsession twice. Doesn't sound worth to me unless its in the situation of late game where you were gonna win anyway.
---
It's gained some attention thanks to Otz and ScottJund, using it with Leatherface turning him into Usain Bubba.
---
If you blind a killer while they are hooking someone mid animation it should count for the challenge. Worked for me. They won‚Äôt drop the survivor but it counts as a blind while carry for the challenge.
---
Yup... they ruined what could‚Äôve been a great killer
---
Meanwhile a survivor can boot up pornhub, go in a locker, jack off while everyone else dies, yeet down the hatch, "GG EZ BABY KILLER", barely safety pip, and get the adept.
---
It‚Äôs better to save Party Streamers for double BP- that‚Äôs typically what most killers do.
---
The part where you said ‚ÄúThe killer is a bubba.‚Äù It had the *‚Äôs in it but it wasn‚Äôt italic. It‚Äôs not normal. It should be *the killer is a bubba.* but Reddit is broken so yea.

I mean, old Freddy was my absolute main. But the rework was still really goddamn good and was a vast improvement. He was dogshit before and while hes not quite the same style now, we should appreciate he fact that hes actually both good and not toxic af to fight.
---
How dare you insult Nea Cuntsson
---
Monster.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eaugll/tired_of_long_queues_i_have_a_secret_that_gets/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Freddy‚Äôs old power was very little like how he actually was in the movies. What are you even talking about?
---
-Freddy is meant to manipulate the world around him when survivors are in the Dream World. How much of that did he actually do in his old state? That is much more apparent in his rework.
---
-Freddy doesn‚Äôt pull people into the sleep state- he waits for them to fall asleep and invades their dreams. That is exactly what new Freddy does.
---
The argument that Old Freddy was ‚Äòlike the movies‚Äô is dumb as hell. New Freddy resembles the character a lot more than the old one.
---
Congrats one person is lvl 5 by using tutorial... what about the rest? Oh wait. Using an I levelled survivor is throwing according to you. Way to be beyond toxic dude.

---
Wait what huntress ?
---
What is dbd mobile
---
Yeah, of course it‚Äôs different people, I wasn‚Äôt implying anything
---
But it‚Äôs so damn tiring, and it does nothing but further the divide, the stupid ‚Äúus vs them/survivor mains vs killer mains‚Äù that is so prevalent and damaging in this sub. Like, I get you, you need to vent, but your rant/vent stays there, and it breeds another place to bash the other side with anecdotes and more rants and more venting that just ends up building up to more toxicity, imo
---
Yeah, lets make him even more annoying.  He just needs a complete rework, honestly.  His power isn't fun to play with or against.  
---
  
---
Id rather have him rotate through different potion types to buff himself or something.  Maybe have different types of bottles?
---
Legion is a thing
---
This on PC? I think on console he got better?
---
Git gud.
---
I heard you paint houses
---
Funny that the people who wouldn't stop complaining like "oh no the killer that needs to charge his power and gets literally no benefit outside of it is strong while using his power" instead of learning how to play against it are now the ones saying "git gud".
---
p*rn - man and women have nice time wrestling together in the bed yes
---
All the 'toxic Claudette', 'clicking flashlight' and 'teabag after pallet stun and at the exit gate' memes exists because of him
---
I got the game 3 weeks ago and had this issue. After a lot of research it appears to be an issue with fake full screen and multiple monitors. It‚Äôs been around for years and people said the fix was to change scaling in windows to 100% from 125% or 150% default on higher res monitors. I hated the ui scaling on my high res so now I switch to a lower res at 100% before playing and it fixed it.
---
This could be interesting, but what should they do?
---
He ain't awful tho
---
I rarely play survivor, I‚Äôm killer main but I also get toxic messages for winning matches.
---
Interestingly when I play as a survivor and the killer is totally OP and wrecks us it just makes the game more fun for me, like woah that was crazy! 
---
I would find it boring if every match was the same, do gens, pallet loop,  exit gates,  done.
---
I love winning like everybody does but getting your ass kicked should be just as fun as losing.
---
At the end of the day it‚Äôs a game, and like all games you win some and you lose some.
---
Almost every type of ‚Äútoxic‚Äù behaviour has a counter to it, it‚Äôs just a matter of adapting
---
Rip forever freddy after nerf
---
you will never reach the exit gate
---
Owl is my personal favorite
---
Nancy knows she fuck up hard
---
Yeah, I love it too, and I love this community. But sometimes after a bad or unfair game I wanna open Reddit and either post something or go to other posts and see other people with the same mindset (my mindset lately has been _fuck rank reset_) but I see that because of the competitiveness of the game it pushes us to talk down the other side, so I take a deep breath and hit ready again lmao
---
Let him eat cake
---
Brad as in TheRadBrad?
---
He's giving her massage don't worry- OH MY GOD MICHEAL NOT AGAIN
---
Nea‚Äôs fucking cute excuse you all!!
---
First reason entity took her
---
He's not the only one, man
---
Its michael?
---
yea on console he was unplayable and got slightly less unplayable
---
they need to see at least 3/4 of your body iirc, so ducking behind a wall/tree works but its on a .5 second delay so if your already been revealed for a second its too late.
---
&gt; as you have to be injured and you have to be healing yourself for it to work
---
An action that takes less than a second is incredibly easy to do even mid chase, just vault a window or do it after throwing down a pallet. Exhaustion recovering while running was removed for a reason...
---
How would this not be OP? You get a free 2nd chance to get away/get distance.
---
More than a little disappointed that there is only one picture, NGL
---
He‚Äôs pretty good at getting people out of hiding by throwing bottles wherever he thinks people could be, but that‚Äôs about it bless him.
---
I can't believe the devs see one week's worth of bitching and think "Yeah, we better change this immediately".  They listen too closely to the swf groups that play 3 times a month at rank 18 and think every killer is op.
---
Why cant I find the mobile version on my phone?
---
It so satisfying when it happens. I had a nea yesterday, teabagged at every pallet, clicked at me the whole match, followed me around to harass me because she was legit a looping god. I could not catch her. I said gg at the end even though all 4 escaped and she sent me a message saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be such a pussy, get mad I stomped you‚Äù I was very fortunate because that same nea was in the next trial and I found her out of position. The 3 other people on the team enjoyed farming with a friendly killer after I face camped the shit out of that nea on the first hook.
---
The thing about Clown, I mean, why no one except me plays him, is him having the smallest gen pressure among them all. He surely can finish chases quickly, but he's genrushed so quickly that you won't even finish a chase without Ruin.
---
A nice head rub
---
Actually, using bottles is not a bad idea, but not seen often. You'll need those bottles later during a chase, that's why it's a rare tactic. Just run Whispers or something.
---
See that #OCHIDO FANBOYS
---
Yeah, most clowns I come up against use one for wherever they think someone could be (I‚Äôm always where he thinks I am too lmao) then the rest to slow the chase.  I think it‚Äôs a good tactic too but yeah most just use them for the chase. If I was clown I‚Äôd probably use more for getting people out of hiding.
---
Lol, of course it is.
---
would be nice for example if u fully stalk someone the survivor hears like a phone and then "hello meg" or something like that
---
What I do, is I check myself if someone is there, and then if I see someone I throw a bottle at him to prevent him from reaching a pallet.
---
My friend is obsessed with that guy. His gamertag is very close to what Ochido uses.
---
Hell, he somehow managed to get into his discord somehow.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a really good idea. I don‚Äôt play clown that often so I haven‚Äôt got a set routine that I do, but I do think he needs a buff. As survivor I think ‚Äòoh okay it‚Äôs clown, not too bad‚Äô... I wanna be SCARED
---
This comment is confusing...
---
Why would the people who thought pre-nerf Oni was weak now think post-nerf Oni is fine and say "git gud".
---
I play him on PS4, where he could NEVER 180¬∞ flick and have consistent success. This is why I believe PC players, who are now whining that the flick is gone, should GIT GUD.
---
If you look at their art, they're supposed to look more attractive than they turned out.
---
I'd actually really like a reskin of the old survivors. New survivors have way more care and detail in literally their entire bodies...
---
I don‚Äôt know who they are listening too? I know they pull info from here sometimes and it‚Äôs probably from their main forum. I never go their just because their forum looks like some kind of janky shit made back in the late 90‚Äôs and I hate saying it but allot of the shit that gets changed comes from the PC community. Us console people are always at the back of the bus when it comes to BhVR Interactive. 
---
But allot of other game devs keep listening to all the little crybaby kids and immediately throw out nerfs and other weird bs because to tailor the game for a easier time on them.

He honestly lack game stall mechanics and that's all. He's really good except for this. Same situation as Bubba actually, he lacks game stalling too, except that Clown's ability is more useful.

The problem with NOED is that some survivor mains think that "If I'm already that far (reached the endgame) I DESERVE to escape now!" And that's the moment where you block this with NOED by one-shotting them. And as they're salty and still think that they deserved the escape, they'll "destroy you in the post-game chat.
---
Don't worry about them, just write "gg" and leave.
---
Honey that aint your friend anymore.
---
Farm with the survivors
---
Survivors see it as allowing a killer to be rewarded even though they've technically failed their objective by allowing 5 generators to be completed. Which is true. But there are far worse perks than NOED, on both sides, so I wouldn't take much notice.
---
There is always going to be a meta /clutch perks , no matter how balanced a game is. That why developer should focus on the fun aspect. Is Clown fun to play as? mostly yes . How to make him more fun? Add addons that gives the clown different buffs.
---
I play both killer and survivor. and when I play as the survivor the only thing that keeps me playing is the fact that not all killers are strong and I have chance of facing a weker killer and having fun.
---
Other than the fact that the butthole devs decided green medkits need to only have 16 charges for some reason. Why wouldn‚Äôt it just have been 18 to get the heal and keep the medkit
---
The Exhaustion one is a must on higher ranks, reloading speed add-ons are nice, AoE range is cool and off course the Ultra Rares.
---
Ah, this spot was right next to a gen, so whenever I'd inevitably leave he's just jump back on it
---
Getting up to the spot was hard for me since I'd never done it so I could really just waste time going up there to finish the chase
---
NOED is fine, the community just gets equally entitled on either side. If survivors do all the gens and don't touch the totems that're all usually next to one or nearby, they get mad when hit with it. It's a wildcard perk and a failsafe, especially a wildcard if you're already playing an instadown Killer since nobody'll expect it.
---
For survivors, NOED is like a reward for being a bad killer. You couldn't kill them before they fix all gens, but after that you can just one hit them all. You can use it, but be prepared for bad comments, especially on higher ranks
---
Everytime i try to solo a ruin gen without an op toolbox the skill check just comes and resets my 15% of progress

I tried playing just now and when I tried to select survivor mode, it was cancelled and said "Party Creation Faild."
---
Hahaha. No.
---
I agree that fun is the most important factor, but balance is just a must, because it destroys the fun. You're more likely to lose as a Clown with more experience than as a Nurse with more experience. Losing doesn't mean fun (mostly), that's why the game should be balanced so that even low-tier killers can win if *you're good and practice a lot*.
---
It‚Äôs seen as rewarding failure because it only works if you fail to defend the gens, people will always complain about the other sides second chance perks though so don‚Äôt worry about it, I‚Äôll only find it irritating if they then complain that I‚Äôve ran dead hard or adrenaline or whatever.
---
Hahaha. Yes.

---
Me too fam, Me too
---
When I survive, I usually expect to escape by the time we've finished the fifth gen, especially if all four of us are alive and did well (especially if the Killer did poorly at chases), so when the Killer finally gets a NOED hit it can seem like an unfair deus ex machina. (It is a fair play, it just *feels* unfair from a survivor point of view)
---
I think if you like NOED you should still use it. It makes for a high stakes endgame if the main game went by too quickly or uneventfully
---
I can't actually imagine why anyone would want to play this on mobile and it's funny to me that they've dedicated resources to it. Different strokes for different folks but I just can't see how this game would be enjoyable on mobile.
---
I‚Äôm a killer main and I despise NOED because to me it‚Äôs rewarding ma for failing and generally not fun. It is roughly the same reason survivors hate it, punishes them for doing their objective, not fun to play against and rewards the killer for doing bad. That‚Äôs my take on it, I usually see it as a crutch and don‚Äôt recommend it if u want to get good with killer.
---

Happened to me too and when I camped one of them after 30 min of searching  the other ones used a key and sent hatemail about me camping.

Swamp btw ._.
---
I play a mean Clown with Distressing, Infectious Fright and Make Your Choice.
---
I can't say it's perfectly optimal but it does create map pressure, and like the Doctor, reveals a lot of locations. If you're close to me when I down someone, I see you. If you're far away from me and you save someone you become exposed.
---
It makes zigzagging the map somewhat useful and causes split pairs of survivors to do worse
---
I would recommend bill because borrowed time and unbreakable are both really good perks

---
Third time lucky haha
---
Yeah except Quintin but I would buy those santa hats legacy Santa hats would be cool too
---
More like the sole reason why I play. Tormenting salty survivor mains is my pasttime as a Doctor main.
---
I‚Äôve literally found it impossible to solo queue after the DLC. I don‚Äôt know why. I can‚Äôt stand the teammates. They got better, but then rank reset happened.
---
Balance and fun are both subjective so without context none of them should take a priority over the other. The reason why in dbd I said fun takes priority is because of the nature of the game .you can't play this game competitively where the balance is more important(Twitch rivals proved that). Also the nature of the 4 perk system is part of the "you win some , you lose some " design philosophy so why should they change it for the killer powers ?
---
Yeah, you cant win. And I dont know what is going on with swamp but I keep being put on that map. 3 out of the last 5 games have been swamp and there went even any offering and I hate that map.

P.P.S. There's also a new hundreds mask coming out soon too - Reindeer head. Looks cool also!
---
isnt a whale sound one of the loudest?
---
I wish that in the dlc the killer was bad Ash  and the survivor was good Ash from army of darkness. That would be sooooo cool.
---
I wonder if they are still going to fix Quentin's face?
---
Imagine dead Harding twice in a row ? Very balanced
---
Yes I thought the same thing XD
---
To be fair it's pretty easy to notice them.
---
I think you're right. Can't respond on that. Don't wanna fight.
---
It's not a bad suggestion, as SWF and solo players are currently miles apart in terms of balance, hence it is hard to balance the game properly.
---
Guy is just good at the game and has fun with it stop
---
Being such a hurt snow flake
---
I feel like if survivors can use Ds then killers can use noed ruin is just a good perk in general.
---
(I'm a survivor main)
---
I‚Äôm presuming Meg is your intended ‚Äòmain‚Äô yeah? 
---
I would recommend leveling David first, grab Dead Hard &amp; WGLF and unlock those on your Meg then farming for Bill‚Äôs teachables will be quicker. 
---
I would then also recommend if you can grabbing the Halloween Chapter and leveling Laurie for DS. 
---
Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Decisive Strike &amp; Borrowed Time or WGLF is a good standard meta build to wrack up bloodpoints and slowly start focusing on other teachables.
---
dw i thought the exact same as you when i read "no longer tied to terror radius" thinking that went the same for BT.

I wouldn't be surprised if this was a challenge lol

"four survivors try to escape from an assassin" "assassin like assassin has supernatural powers" - this article
---
Most of the DbD articles on the internet seem like they are written by someone who has never played this game.
---
Quick trivia: The user that wrote that answer has been banned by Steam.
---
That looks cool your talented
---
Did you take into account that multiple survivors on a gen is not 100% effective unless you have prove thyself? I think with 4 survivors on one gen, progress is actually at 370% speed efficiency? Might be wrong but I think that‚Äôs how it works
---
Why?
---
I've seen countless videos of otz where he is resetting a trap in the same spot because it's a good spot, and if one survivor knows where it is, it doesn't mean the others do to. 
---
Also what global announcement? If they step in you get a bubble yeah, but if they disarm it you only hear the snapping sound, either way it's not enough for the other survivors to pinpoint where the trap was set.
---
And even if they know where it is, setting it to block a pallet next to a hooked survivor is still worth it, because if they unhook and you start to chase them right away they won't have time to disarm it and you deny them the pallet which most likely is the only thing saving them from a hit. Best case scenario they don't see the trap, giving you a free down after the unhook, worst case you get a free hit on the unhooker because he couldn't loop the pallet.
---
If he tries to disarm the trap before saving you'll have time to get back and get your free hit on the unhooker while he tries to save, which may even lead to a 1 for one, or he aborts the save, which might give you a free hook state on the unhooker, while also making sure a second survivor is not doing gens.

The only thing that would make people move on would be if another game like DBD would come out which for sure won't happen. They are 100% going to make it available for PS5 as well.
---
It's funny how salty you are but i bet you still play the game every single day. If they have treated you so badly you should leave once and for all

Somehow my skills at hitting great skill checks some games is just flawless and I'll laugh at the killer for having wasted a slot on ruin as I pump out gens and my team struggles and others times? I'll be the immersed one afraid in a corner because I can't hit a great to save my life and the world is dark and cold.
---
I blame the maps. Some of them just reduce my will to live and thus my abilities to hit ruin skill checks.

I really hope this is a joke. I really do.

Spawn on the hook. You can't get rescued or unhook yourself for the duration of the trial, but you complete generators 50% faster
---
Just the same penalty as for DCing. You have to wait if you dodge.
---
as a legion/doctor main,
---
y e s
---
Oooh
---
That's not the challenge though, it's just blind while they're carrying. Both picking up and hooking count as still carrying, so blinding during either of these times (which is easier than timing a flashlight save) will complete the challenge.
---
I don't use steam.
---
Hell yeah, brother. Remove all the nerfs in HC mode. No more entity blocker on windows. Vacuum vaults/pallets are back. Fast vault from any distance. 75% speed Self Care that works with We'll Make It. Decisive works anytime you want it. MoM back in full force. Balanced Landing un-nerfed. BT protects the unhooker. Hatch can't be closed. Hooks and traps are sabotaged forever. Instablinds are back. BNP is an instant free gen again.
---
Hillbilly gets his flick back. Default 3blink nurse, none of this cooldown shit. Moonwalk Legion. Full power Oni. No-Totem Infinite NOED. Bring back Prayer Beads.
---
Let's go dude, I'm all for it. Sounds fun as hell man.
---
Does anyone know when in 2020?
---
 Still waiting for any explanation on how to beat an actual good oni pre nerf. Literally every time i watched a streamer play oni he got a 4k unless it was a garbage map for his patrol or he got denied his power early and lost too many gens.
---
If oni was in power and you weren't at a window or a pallet, you were just dead. You couldn't loop, you couldn't outrun, you couldn't juke the smash. Why? Because he had a dumb as fuck 180 flick. All you could do die unless he pathed wrong. Billy you can dodge the chainsaw and its harder to control. Nurse you can break LOS and predict her location. Spirit you could at least walk and if your not injured possible escape. Oni was M2 and get a down.
---
Was he fun as hell to play as? Yeah the flick felt nutty and rewarding to use. Was he fun to play against? Not at all. The counterplay to oni was "don't be farther from the loop then it takes for him to m2 to you"
---
Oni flick deserved to be put in the dirt, and that PTB m2 charge cooldown too, but every other nerf went too far including the glove addon.
---
HEUGH HEUGH HUU HEUGH
---
Same. I can always trust the DBD community. I mean just look at DBDGONEWILD, it's gay as fuck and I love it.
---
He didn‚Äôt have Monitor, he only had zanshin tactics and infectious fright
---
But with rancor u dont get to block the door off
---
Youre talking to a fool who never tried using the flashlight much for various reasons lol. I finally just got it done because I got a killer who I had a game with in times past. I was the killer then, and I let her live, so she repayed me by letting me get the save 
---
Good karma ftw
---
there is no confusion just a mistake by saying it's the same for both side as i explained.
---
Escape menu should also display your current Archives goal. I forget mine too often.
---
Better
---
again, with rancor it doesn't matter because the doors won't be open by the time the mori finishes since rancor triggers at 5th gen pop, not EGC and remember me makes gates take 36 seconds
---

NOED is a crutch perk for terrible gameplay throughout the match, it rewards bad killers but I do think it‚Äôs a fun ‚Äòdo they, don‚Äôt they‚Äô towards the end. It adds an element of surprise or fear I guess, makes it a bit exciting. Plus it can be cleansed. 
---
(I run NOED on my killers because I‚Äôm okay admitting I suck at killer)

I think you're overdoing it and it almost seems like you took offense when there is nothing to be offended by? Or am I getting the wrong impression here? Please do correct me so I don't sit in the wrong. Maybe on the small chance you were actually laughing but it seems more like mockery. 
---
"survivor bad killer good" makes no sense and it wasn't what I was aiming at. There are both good players and bad players on both teams. We were just having some fun with impersonating an offended survivor, aka a "bad player" in this case on the surviving team and it didn't target anyone specific. Although with that said I kind of get the impression that you are tired of hearing these things and it seems like it made you snap, resulting in your comment.
---
Piggy, even though I don't play her as much anymore. I still have to play 1 match of her a day and allow someone to book the gosh darn snoot!
---
"Yeah, you WERE supposed to walk away and let my team save me for free."
---
How can you be so utterly brainless? Seriously, that's just scary.
---
Agreed. It has nothing to do with ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù an escape. But if I suddenly get bs‚Äôd because the killer has a one hit down, it‚Äôs just a bit frustrating. Yes, I typically cleanse totems and haven‚Äôt been hit by NOED in awhile, but the perk‚Äôs concept itself rewards bad play: you failed to defend generators, and now you have a one hit down. It‚Äôs stupid and crutch, just like the old Decisive. You failed a chase, now hit a skill check and you can escape the grasp. Same thing with NOED, you failed to protect gens, here‚Äôs a one hit down. One got a minor rework, and not the other. 
---
I‚Äôm not gonna cry about the perk whenever it pops, but it definitely feels cheap.
---
The killer is running Play with your food, a teachable perk from the shape. This perk requires the killer to lose chase with the obsession to gain a token which increases the killer's movement speed by 5% for each token.
---
Can you Mori w/tombstone right off of a gen?
---
I didn't see it? All I saw was a bind to toggle between "i"
---
His helmet is like a bob cut isnt it?
---
I‚Äôve had this happen twice. Was attempting Adept Oni and three gens popped within two chases. Not like the chases were that long, but in the span it took me to hit twice and then hook, they had two brand new parts on green toolboxes and fucked me up, not much I could do.
---
That so good WTF.
---
Some day
---
as a killer main I refuse to do it... its just directly destroying someone's enjoyment and really uncool. A lot of salty survs, but when you play fairly you dont get them often
---
Do they not stack?
---
I am the latter and proud of it. I can loop pretty decently I'd like to think (Typically around 3 gens before I start to really risk going down) but I prefer not being forced into too many lengthy chases. Primarily because I assume that if I'm not doing gens nobody is as I solo queue almost exclusively.
---
Played a game against Freddy on Friday that resulted in a 3k (last survivor found hatch) and lasted twenty three minutes. We got three and a half gens done. Forever Freddy is very much alive.

&gt; I'm pretty sure you can still black pip on 4k games if they are fast enough

it's your own fault if it happens. if the survivors fuck up enough to let you 4K during the first minutes, then you are in control of the game and can make it a easy double pip for you.

---
Brain dead man I swear
---
I mean, to be fair his stun sound is more a frustrated sigh than anything. It'd be amusing to hear him expressing disappointment in the delay of the inevitable if he wasn't so hilariously broken.
---
How... Exactly...? Let's say the killer has both bps and a pudding. He chooses to offer the pudding and by doing so only he gets 100% more bloodpoints and no one else. But if he offers the bps then everyone, one killer and all four survivors would get 100% bloodpoints. Still with me?
---
Same goes for survivors. Let's say a survivor has both bps and an escape cake. He chooses to offer the cake and by doing so only he gets 100% more bloodpoints and no one else. But if he chooses to use the bps instead then everyone, he, his 3 teammates and the killer gets 100% more bloodpoints.

i prefer dying light because thanatophobia punishes you for hooking people. it‚Äôs also pretty impossible to get 4 people injured for long enough to make it viable unless you‚Äôre legion or plague. to me, a mid-lategame slowdown perk is more valuable than a small penalty that often never stays for more than 60 seconds.

The amount of survivors that do not get this is ridiculous.

IIRC thanata only punishes you for killing people, injured dying and hooked state all counts, its only when they die you get cucked. Maybe its just cause i play freddy/GF/trapper but keeping the injurys is fairly simple. No, your not gonna have a constant 4 stack of thana, but sloppy makes having at least 1 if not 2 people injured all game fairly easy.
---
same here! i thought my game had broken. very glad to know it‚Äôs not just me but really hope it‚Äôs fixed soon
---
NOED is not only bad for survivors, it's bad for you too. By running NOED you won't learn how to properly play. I see a lot of killers slack during the round before all gens are done because 'NOED will save me'. By not running NOED you learn to put effort into the game and get the survivors killed as quickly as possible before the gens get done.
---
Right now it might seem like a great perk but as you rank up it will become less effective or it won't even activate at all. And then the game is practically over for you. Learn to play without it and you'll be much better off.
---
i love the idea of giving all your survivors roles, but i would hate if the devs did that. i don't have the time to level every survivor to be able to play them all depending on my teams comp. i main killer so im spending all of my bp to be able to play killers and using the shrine to buy the survivor perks i want for my kate(who im going to spend my bp on once I've gotten all 4 of the perks i want)

---
I'd disagree on calling him balanced pre-nerf, he was pretty faceroll once you knew how to use your power. Getting his power charged up didn't take that much time compared to how strong it was. Chases vs good oni were very one sided. Hopefully they get him to 90 degrees after they change him again, maybe increase the blood orbs requirement a little.

Its a terrible perk for both. For new players its teaching them to ignore the objectives and waste time that they won't have in later ranks, if they get there. For solo queues with experience, the above applys except now they don't have an excuse since they should know better

I i absolutely agree that if you get that far that early you should know you're gonna black pip and start messing with them as a real sadistic killer would, but that's kinda besides the point, considering the 4k giving you a black pip is the issue, not that you can't prevent it.

It doesn‚Äôt teach them to ignore objectives what are you on? I‚Äôm hurt I‚Äôll heal then go right back to doing gens. That goes for both cases.
---
God who cares
---
Great comment, 10/10
---
shut up if you have a "nerf legion" tag lol.
---
Why do you care?
---
Ain‚Äôt no rules regardless though. Play how you want, no survivor is gonna accept any type of gameplay that involves them dying. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That‚Äôs what blood warden is for
---
The Killers objective is to kill all the survivors, not just prevent five generators from being repaired. That's why this excuse is such BS every time I see it. It's not a reward for failure it's just completing the objective in a different way.

ok, let me explain.
---
with billy, right from the start you can charge your chainsaw and depending the map and your skill you can be on the other side in the matter of seconds. let's remember that billy's chainsaw can instadown people, so you also can instadown people from the very start of the game.
---
you can compare billy with oni at this point, and this is why i posted that comment (that people didn't understand or didn't like). billy's chainsaw and oni's demon charge are pretty similar, right? oni is a skill based killer too, right? a "good, solid, A tier, balanced killer" as the picture says, right? and oni got nerfed a few DAYS after his release, right?
---
one part of the nerf was that they made it so when you are using your power with oni, and you down someone, you have to pick him/her up almost  immediately because your power starts draining a lot faster, so you can't down everyone (and slug them) when you get your power for the first time. now billy not only can do this still from a long time now and oni got nerfed because of this very thing a few days after his release. billy doesn't even need to "get" his power like oni (and remember, the devs themselves said that slugging is not the way to go).
---
so you got a killer with no downsides: he can charge his chainsaw normally for all the duration of the trial, so he can have all this map pressure, instadown, slugging, breaking pallets, with no cooldown. do you think that's balanced? if you go from side to side of the map to check gens with oni, and no one is there, you lose time from your power, so there is a downside (and remember that oni doesn't start with his power charged, it takes x time for him to get it), if you teleport to the wrong gen with freddy, you have to wait for the power to recharge, so there is a downside (and freddy can't teleport to gens from the very start of the match). billy doesn't get affected by any of those things because he can simply charge his chainsaw again and no problem.
---
i know that not every billy is like this, and i know that it takes skill to learn how to play him (nurse takes skill too, and still she was the most op killer for years). imo he needs a change
---
Oh, I see you're a man of culture as well... But I saw nothing but T H E  V O I D
---
Chad Survivors (and Killers) say gg regardless of how the game went.
---
Says the Adept Nea, LOL. The Killers objective is to kill all the survivors, not just prevent five generators from being repaired. If they choose to complete their one and only objective after the generators are repaired it is not a reward for failure or a scummy way of playing. It's the survivors fault for not cleansing all the totems. I love how lazy survivors try and shame a killer for playing the game a different way by constantly spouting the BS that it's a reward for failure.

I thought you said you opened both gates? Is there a 3rd gate I‚Äôm unaware of?

---
I've started playing Killer, because my daily rituals have not drop any survivor ones in MONTHS. Decided to pick up Bubba, because it's the killer I have the worst time going against... I've seen some things as a rank 20 Bubs, that make me question some of the higher rank players.
---
I've been chasing survivors and literally witness some get inside a locker in front of me. No DS, and no one in sight to flashlight... Like why Bruh? You're a rank 9, why are you getting in the locker instead of waiting save this Baby Meg? Why can't you wait for me to pass before getting inside the locker?
---
I have so many questions.
---
The rework will come one day that's for sure, let's hope it's not too far away...

That's why it's p*rn.

because hes the weakest killer. You main him youre in a world of hurt
---
The fact you got that many bloodpoints despite giving them all moris
---
It is a concept that can use tweaking. I think its an interesting concept, but i think maybe it should make it so when recovering exhaustion normally (walking) it would recover 2x as fast, then the next time you are exhausted it recovers 2x as slow
---
Assuming you're not being sarcastic and assuming the person using Dead Hard knows what they're doing... Yeah it wouldn't be :P
---
Listen man, every time you bring this up 90% of the responses are going to say it's a reward for failure, that you failed in your objective to prevent all the generators from being repaired. But no matter how much survivors want to make you believe it your objective is not to prevent the generators from being repaired, it is to kill all the survivors before they escaped. So using this perk is just a different way to play the match, it allows you to kill all the survivors after the generators have been repaired and that is your only objective. They will constantly try to shame you for using it because they were too lazy to cleanse all the totems.
---
And the killer is Doctor.
---
At least you could farm him for your power
---
I throw the pudding because they usually dont deserve the bonus with how they act
---
It's happened to me too, but with Bubba. The M2 won't activate and M1 won't work, either. Have to wait it out and then try it again.

---
It's based on the speed of the killer. So all 4.6 meter/second killers (plague and wraith included) have the same lunge.
---
It gets really old seeing this bullshit spouted. The match isn't lost until all the survivors Escape. The Killers objective is not to prevent the generators from being repaired but to kill all the survivors. Some people choose to do that after the generators have been repaired. Stop trying to cover your own laziness for not cleansing the totems by shaming Killers for using a different strategy you're not used to.
---
Wow, no one cares. Huh, would you look at that?
---
As a killer main. That Kobe and unbreakable were both infuriating and fantastic to watch. Also you had a key.
---
Yeah seriously that intro blows my ears out everytime, i rush to turn my sound down before the game starts.
---
I shit you not when I first started playing I played as Freddy and ran this exact build (I got rancor quite a bit later)
---
Why is he using two hands. WHY IS HE USING TWO HANDS
---
You can delete this start up intro in the files and it starts the game up straight to the menu. Gotta do it every new update though.
---
First off, using the fact they are 'Adept Nea' in your argument already shows how much you reach for insults, but i'll ignore that. NOED is not very fair. Survivors can prevent it from going off, but not every survivor will think its necessary, especially if the killer has Ruin or other gen-slowdown perks. Its text-book definition of a crutch.
---
While from a gameplay standpoint, it helps the killer get their objective done, but its in a way that punishes survivors for getting objectives done. Cleansing totems only gives you points, and the POSSIBILITY the killer has NOED, so the only real reason to cleanse them is if you have Inner Strength. NOED forces survivors to either spend time looking around the map to prevent it, or else they get fucked at the end.
---
I know I sound like an entitled survivor main, but I also play killer alot, and it even feels dirty using NOED. Especially against randoms, who don't know how many totems have been cleansed and have to guess.

that isn't a mindgame for the love of god stop saying that. A mindgame is taking information present in the situation and getting rid of it or reducing it for an advantage. Moonwalking to hide your red stain is a mindgame, survivors faking pallets is a mindgame.
---
Spirit standing still and giggling because the Survivor has no idea if she's actually phasing or not is not a mindgame, there is already no information to reduce or get rid of.
---
It's more efficient to do Nancy's hair that way
---
Nope, all Killers have the same lunge range in their speed tier. Wraith, Trapper, Plague, Ghostface, everyone who moves at 115% has the same lunge range, barring Myers T3.
---
Huntress, Hag, anyone at 110% has a shorter range just based on the fact that they're slower.
---
And finally, non-blinking Nurse and T1 Myers have incredibly short lunges, thanks to their incredibly low speed, and Myers actually just has a shorter duration lunge at T1.
---
Yeah exactly. As a survivor main I agree üòÇ
---
I have a mountain of anniversary gateaus on legion but everyone is such a shithead I never bother using them
---
Oh, I didn't know it was stale.

I'm casually invested in R6, but I just really like Tachanka.

Every lunge is the same (other than tier 1 and 3 myers and slightly post blink nurse)
---
David for Dead Hard or Claudette for Self Care
---
32-40 seconds to heal base + the time it took for you to go to whatever your standard of a "safe" place is, usually the dead corner of a map for blendettes vs finding a survivor at a gen and healing in 16+ the time it took to find them and doing a gen afterwards or gen then heal. Even if you can't find a friend, its better to just do the gen, thats 1/2 a gen completed for the team to capitalize on especially since your injured and he hasn't come to you yet so that means hes not tunneling since he is scared of DS or he isn't chasing you anymore
---
40 seconds is a complete gen with a friend and you spending that time doing nothing being useless except ready to take another hit for free mean that A- another survivor was looping and you did fuck all since you can't get hit if your not being chased B- Another survivor was caught + hooked and you did fuck all to progress the gamestate or C- the killer is afk and you did nothing.
---
Self care is a terrible perk that should never be taken currently and only handicaps yourself. People are stuck in the golden age where you could take  a hit and self care to healthy withing the animation CD of hitting someone.
---
They set it so every killer has the same lunge no matter their base speed
---
It makes the killer a threat
---
Prince of Persia? (2)
---
Sorry, meant BPS, will edit it now
---
They changed it so even 110% killers have the same lunge range and speed as 115%
---
was doing my monstrous shrine basement challenge yesterday, after over 2 hours of queues and bad games I finally was gonna get it, had the one survivor hooked and the other went down on the staircase. Went to pick them up and they dc'd before I got to the hook. Fucking rage inducing.

As a survivor main, I‚Äôm totally fine with dying. But if you get me right away, and camp me to death, without me getting to do anything, that‚Äôs rough. Wasted time in loading screens üòÇ

I try my best to not camp, but once the doors are open and I haven't sacrificed anyone yet I will sit my fat ass down and not let my only sacrifice get away.

He's gonna mori you

Edge Face. 
---
Jokes aside I think it looks really damn good.
---
The conversation continued, debating on whether or not I should post the part two.
---
Spine Chill has its uses but once your knowledge/confidence of the game grows its a perk you don‚Äôt really need as you can generally gauge killer directions etc and develop far better map awareness. Also should be learning to rotate your camera as you‚Äôre exploring the map to be aware of everything.
---
But it's not an opinion, it's absolute fact. The Killers objective is to kill, not prevent generators being repaired. So you can disagree all you want but it's still a fact.
---
He's probably 10
---
Pretty sure he is not perm banned
---
He's like 10 he plays fortnite don't let him get to you. Yes it's hard to justify camping but if they teabag and that's your only hook but the gates are powered then they are more toxic
---
I remember playing through these games as a kid. Sands of Time then Warrior Within then the 3rd one too, I forgot it's name.
---
All great games, some of Ubisoft's best.
---
However... I'm not sure if Prince of Persia and Dahaka (? I might be mispelling the beast's name lol) would fit the theme of DbD...
---
I'd say this is highly unlikely.
---
Dbd gone wild
---
NOED would be more fair if there was other reasons to cleanse totems, besides activating Inner Strength. To majority survivors, cleansing totems is more of a chore to prevent a perk the killer might have, then actually benefiting the survivor team, so its really either you go around the map cleansing 5 totems for that possibility, or you take a bet that the killer doesn't have it.
---
I just need where did they go to get platinum, it‚Äôs been that way for months now

A lot of people don‚Äôt seem to know what dbd mobile is.

Bc SB does everything that DH does but better. other then the invincibility but you really dont need that with SB
---
If there is anything like the stupid spine chill one in tome 4 I will cry
---
That depends on how many people are in the queue at the moment. Sometimes it can find you a game in 2 seconds but i remember when it took me 16 minutes to find a game.
---
Uh.... you won't double pip if you 4k during the first few minutes unless you're at really low ranks. You'll begin losing rank as you get higher if games end too fast. People need to stop claiming that getting an instant 4k is an easy double pip at anything that isn't rank 16 or lower.
---
It's a map addon that let's place a marker (shown as that beam of light) where you are to highlight a point of interest. Everyone on the team can see it.
---
Yeah i wasn't exactly familiar with the medals, i looked it up on the wiki and according to that, you can at best get a safety pip with a 1k
---
You can get 525 points in the gatekeeper category, which would mean a silver emblem (1 gen left for 200 with no gens done within the first 9 minutes for 7\*5 points for each minute)
---
I found out the game describes the emblem very poorly: 9 hooks equal a bonus point towards the emblem, which needs 10 points and gets 2 points for each kill, 1 point for hooking all survivors, and 1 point for hooking 9 survivors, so you have to hook 9 times, hook all survivors, and get the 4k to get iridescent devout emblems, so the most you could get on a 1k is, again, a silver emblem (1 for 9 hooks, 1 for hooking all survivors once, and 2 for getting a kill, which is exactly enough)
---
Malicious might be able to get an iridescent on a 1k, it requires 36 points, gets a point every hit you get and 2 points for every hook state, your point loss for healing or dropping them is returned to you when you hit them again. You can hit each survivor 2 times before they go down the first time, then once more for the second hook, and a fourth time before the 3rd and final hook, which totals 16 points. Then you have and additional 16 points for each survivor going through two hook states, and the extra 2 points for the sacrifice stage of the killed survivor for a total of 34 points. If unbreakable doesn't count as a healed health state (although i assume it does) you could hit 2 survivors coming out of unbreakable to get those last 2 points for 36. This would assume the last 3 survivors escaped through the hatch right after you knocked them all down as well though
---
I have no idea how the final category is calculated, because it is definitely calculated the way the wiki states, but even if we assume an iridescent in the chaser category, as well as the unbreakable not counting as a healed health state (even though, again, i assume it doesn't work like that) we get 2 silver and 2 iridescent emblems, for a total of 12 points which is still only a safety pip at rank one.
---
So in this, extremely unlikely scenario, you kill 1 survivor, have every other survivor dead on hook, kept all generators unrepaired for 9 minutes, and had the 3 dead on hook survivors in the dying state on top of the hatch after two getting up with unbreakable, with all of them escaping with a key and 1 gen remaining to be completed. And you still only safety pip (barely, since one more medal tier would get you the +1 pip, again assuming you can still get iridescent malicious and chaser, which I don't think you can do for malicious unless you get 2 sacrifices) which is ridiculous for this kind of performance on the killer side
---
I was entirely wrong and I apologize, the game really had me confused on the way the medals work because of some of the descriptions
---
Wait wtf there is a dead by daylight mobile app?
---
Xbox times are decent, killer queues are instant later in the night
---
All lunges are the same, just some animations and models make it seem hella long. Freddys claw for instance is hella small compared to a trapper weapon but they both it the same
---
Billy does have downsides. If you're not good with his chainsaw, you're heavily punished by gens being finished and not having pressure to move people off gens.
---
DBD should play in a way where as killer, if you play at the highest level, which I'd say I'm probably close to that level as someone who regularly does well with "harder" to play killers. You should be able to 4k. Now at the moment, DBD doesn't play like this. DBD currently plays as:
---
Let's assume low rank is a new player all the way up to someone with say 80-100 hours
---
Let's also assume high rank is someone who understands basic concepts like correct loop pathing, mindgames, and other things for counter play all the way up to a perfect player that always chooses correctly and never makes a mistake.
---
Low rank survivor vs. Low rank: Could be no kills or a 4k, all depends as skill level is difficult to determine at lower ranks.
---
Low rank survivor vs. High rank killer: Usually a 4k, most high level killers can spot these matches early and focus the less skilled players
---
High rank survivor vs. Low rank killer: Just absolute demolition. Killer has no chance unless they face camp for the 1k, or maybe the survivors meme and the killer snags a 2-4k. But that shouldn't count.
---
High rank survivor vs. High rank killer: This is where the killer matters. 
---
No point before this did a specific killer matter, because survivors dont look behind them, they dont loop correctly, and they make mistakes. Killers make bad plays, path incorrectly so they lose distance, and make general mistakes.
---
Here is where actual skill takes place, where the balanced gameplay resides for the most part. If a perfect billy plays against a perfect survivor team with coms and tactics. Billy WILL NOT get more than a 2k at the most. This isnt just me pulling a kill count out of my ass. Plenty of people have played high level games to see how this will play out. Even with the best killers on the game, besides broken bullshit like iridescent hatchet type builds, you can rarely get above a 2k because gen speeds are so fast.
---
Killers like billy are top tier because of exactly what you point out. He has an insta down the whole game, he can use it at any time, and he also has high movement speed tied to it. Allowing for some easy downs at times.
---
The issue we run into is what side do we balance for? Do we balance for the lower skill players that dont understand the game, or do we balance for the top tier players that want the game to be fair?
---
Regardless of that answer, everyone knows killer is in the palm of survivors. If you're playing any killer other than billy, nurse, spirit, or freddy. (Still ignoring the OP builds). You have no chance of beating a good team of survivors.
---
Killer has to capitalize on mistakes, but when survivors don't make mistakes, suddenly these OP killers become useless. They just have to either leave and pressure someone else, hoping they're not as good. Which at higher ranks tends to not happen, so it's the same outcome as: 
---
or they have to commit, eventually forcing the survivor to use 7 chain loops, tied to main building, which they abuse for 9 minutes, forcing all gens to be finished, resulting in only a 1k unless survivors are altruistic.
---
My main point is I can understand why you think hillbilly is OP in comparison to other killers. But the issue is you're not comparing it to general gameplay and how these OP killers only appear OP when used by someone good against someone bad.
---
Bad players vs. Bad players should never be a sample for data as that's just 4 idiots vs. 1 idiot. There is no skill there to base anything off of.
---
I dont want to play with potatos its my fucking problem if I have longer queue times but i have better ramdons

Of course he is a twitch streamer and a toxic survivor.

Both
---
What rank are you?,were you playing killer or survivor?
---
Because for survivor, my wait time averages about 2 minutes while for killer it‚Äôs like 5-6 minutes
---
I don't think you know what that word means which shows that you can't understand basic logic so yeah, have a good one.
---
&gt; it's funny to me that they've dedicated resources to it.
---
Just think about all the MTs they can get away with adding in mobile games. For PC/Console, there is a limit to how much monetization people will let devs get away with, but on mobile there can be soooo much monetization with nobody caring, especially people in the Asian market.
---
That being said, considering the state of the PC/Console versions, I can't help but wonder just how buggy and unstable the mobile version will be.
---
As I said before, you can change your location to one of these countries, I use iOS, so I don‚Äôt know how you do it on Android

Nothing screams assassin like a babylonian woman who vomits on you.

Last time I got shit like this and posted it my post got struck within 20 minutes. The mods told me "Its not allowed because you're shaming other player" even though I censored the guys name. What. The. Fuck. Is this selective enforcement bullshit.

I think it was patched this last update, but you could launch yourself off a specific side of the hill
---
Legion-face.
---
Do you main him now? Do you play him? Do you KNOW how to play him? Do you know good builds to use on him? Do you know proper Frenzy management and when to not go for a stab because you know you won't make it? Do you cry because FF stabs are no longer basic attacks (ok, that was a stupid change but you can still make builds regardless)? Do you have your own opinion and don't just copy whatever DBD youtubers say? Judging by your words I don't think so. Legion's ability to constantly injure survivors forces them to either constantly heal and not do gens or stay injured and be easy pickings, plus the info he gets and speed makes you constantly know where everyone is and force them away from whatever they are doing. I literally went from rank 16 to rank 5 with Legion only and until rank 9, I didn't even use Ruin. Sure that doesn't mean he is the greatest killer in the game and doesn't need buffs but assuming he is the worst killer while killers like Leatherface just exist is absolutely stupid.
---
Using my ebony on neas in general is also extremely fun.
---
Not convincing enough the BP gain is too low.
---
I am here to say these survivors today are not wholesome I‚Äôve had the sweatiest rank 1s and 2s in my game who do all gens in two minutes and loop you forever
---
Ok boomer
---
Ahh gotcha. I‚Äôm on Switch. I can‚Äôt even figure out how the other survivors are pointing and motioning.
---
No matter your math. Self care always takes 2x the healing speed of another survivor healing you. If you are not doing a gen for 2√óX seconds, or if both you and another survivor do not work on a gen for X seconds is the same time wasted.
---
Now the only difference is how fast you can get to the heal spot. You can jump behind the nearest pallet and start healing or run around finding another survivor, which might take more time, of course if another survivor is nearby you can get the heal that way.
---
i dont think so, but SB is still much better.
---
Uh yeah you're gonna hook them and?
---
I knew you had no idea what you were talking about
---
I, Michael Myers, have a dream.
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs actually pretty crazy, and it‚Äôs part of why killers will often complain about survivors being too strong and gen speed being too fast. As killers rank up they have to be disgustingly good or survivors just that bad to actually maintain a high rank or climb in red ranks. A lot of streamers make it look pretty easy to stay high rank, but plenty have a few thousand hours and you usually don‚Äôt run into good survivors outside of red ranks.
---
If anything I think that‚Äôs where a lot of the killers irritation with killer nerf comes from. Sure, if you‚Äôre good you can play any killer at any rank and be successful, but it‚Äôs so fucking annoying to do it. When you take into consideration the map size for most killers it further complicates the issues.
---
The ranking is probably another reason killers will sometimes favor more broken builds and killers. I personally think that‚Äôs pretty un-healthy for the game. I‚Äôd rather it was more lenient on certain aspects so that it was less stressful for everyone.
---
Finger licking good
---
Yep, PS5 (and the new Xbox) were both confirmed to be backwards compatible.
---
KYF. Messing around on Coldwind Farm against Nurse and one of my friends managed to blink through &amp; past the gate after all five gens were completed

You are a god of wisdom. You have completely demolished me. I'm on my knees begging for forgiveness..how dare I have an opinion about a killer I own and play..dear God, I even disagreed with your highness..just end me now
---
Torment these people at every given opportunity. This is the way.
---
??? Who cares just leave lobby and go next idk what's the issue lol. This guy is obviously just incorrect don't even waste time responding.  People are toxic in chat in every game but this is the first game where people make such a big deal about it.
---
I literally only like the Legion because of how they clean the knives.
---
Damn that sucks
---
It would be cool to have something like this but the downside would need to be different because having a longer exhaustion wouldn‚Äôt be bad considering what you get for it. Maybe add a hindered effect after you get exhausted next or make the exhaustion go away over time like a syringe so you can still get it back when running or in a chase but it‚Äôs not as powerful otherwise it could be very annoying to go against as a killer.
---
His second perk is completely broken. Run it on Spirit with Wakizashi and Katana Tsuba and you‚Äòll never miss a hit again. Or run it on Nurse and you won‚Äòt even need to double blink. Myers with Fragrant Tuft of Hair and this perk would destroy everything. 15% per survivor killed is a huge deal and would make it almost impossible for survivors to win once one or two survivors are dead. Every pallet would become highly unsafe and everyone would need to abandon loops immediately. You‚Äòd also need to drop every pallet early. Even if we ignore those issues it would practically encourage tunneling people and running an Ivory Mori would be the most used offering in the game because you‚Äòll get the bonus for a dead survivor as well. Changing it to 2/3/4% per survivor could maybe balance it, but it‚Äòd still be an insane perk.
---
Yeah, Meg has the brow ridge of a caveman.
---
Ohhhh... Okay, thanks for all the responses.  I have shockingly/sadly played since near launched and this is the first time I have ever seen someone use this.
---
Your post is spot on. I think it comes down to the confines of the game itself and the fact that survivors freak the hell out whenever a killer seems wildly different and they can't default to their typical "ring around the Rosie" nonsense. Something like the photographer would cause people to riot, honestly. As much as I love this game, I feel like the devs have nothing special left. Its why I'm always on the lookout for other asymmetrical games because I feel like DBD has peaked.

I doubt that we will ever see a killer who has a wacky power that doesn't fall into the same traps as all of the other killers.
---
I'm brand new to this game too. It appealed to me because I'm a huge horror fan. Michael Myers and ghost face are my favorite, but I'm a little nervous to put money into it.
---
Oh, I've heard jokes about the infamous helicopter pilot from RE3, never actually knew the name.
---
When?
---
Do me a favor and stfu
---
Is there?
---
I have her withering blight skin and I like it but it's the only one and the Susie Christmas sweater on legion is so goood
---
Except running to the nearest gen is more preferable, because either a survivor is there, which you would know if you just got off the hook and the killer disengaged from you to get the unhooker so its a free heal + gen or they aren't in which case you get 1/2 a gen complete. It is almost always objectively better to be injured and get gen progress then it is to fully heal in 40 seconds and get no gen progress. 16 seconds is forgiveable which is a friend/medkit heal baseline no addons or perks. 40 seconds as i've stated, is half a gen or a complete gen with someone else.
---
Point is gen progress&gt;health states. If you can take 40 seconds to heal its either a 3 gen on the other side of the map and you ran all the way over there in a 2 survivor situation or you wasted valuable time not doing a gen while another survivor is looping.
---
Self care is the reason why survivors lose games, because they do what should be at minimum a 1 gen loop run and they go down to see a silhouette healing in the distance.
---
The only time self care is possibly good is assuming you can't find any other survivors and are on death hook, and in that case, you weren't gonna survive this game anyway because you chose to heal over getting the presuamble last gen done or you died so quick earlier you wouldn't of made it to egc
---
As far as I can tell, it's not that killers are weak but that the ranking system is just not entirely fitting to the game and that's what causes the problems. Killers are mad because they feel weak when ranking up is so hard but Survivors are mad because they are still dying more often than they should on average
---
Nope I can still play normally
---
Once you start you'll never stop. I've only had it a few months and I've bought almost all the DLC and spent $20 in skins. Luckily most of the DLC was from an Xbox card I hadn't been using..I'm actually trying to decide between spirit and Freddy as we speak..
---
Dbd mobile
---
Depends on rank and region.
---
As a red rank killer in europe i find killer games instantly.
---
Survivor matches can take forever in that rank though.
---
From what i've heard it's the other way around in yellow and green ranks, and when i was in purple after rank reset it was pretty even.
---
Why can‚Äôt we enjoy both? I watch Noob for survivor and Monto for killer and have learnt a lot from both really good players
---
LOL why would u want to be that guy
---
Pwyf, nemsis, pop/thrilling/thana, ruin
---
Add-ons - tape and sketchbook
---
 Pwyf and nemisis to end loop fast.
---
Well that changes a lot, but still, during EGC securing a kill isn‚Äòt bad
---
Lmao thanks üòä
---
*skill check
---
The killer things is what I was trying to say at the end.
---
But the survivors dying more than average is debatable, and goes back to understanding the statistics. The data released by BHVR isn‚Äôt telling the full story, so to base any conclusions on that is inherently wrong. It‚Äôs all ppl have to work with, but that doesn‚Äôt mean ppl can base any conclusions on it that would hold weight.
---
Have an authentic devil face with tags for sale ..lmk I'll send pics
---
Many perks are good on him.
---
BBQ ruin enduring+spirit fury infectious fright for snow balling discordance for the early game stalk (and stopping the dirty gen rushers) bamboozle, maybe even whispers.
---
What do you have?
---
Well you would have been at 99 anyways, even without the -2
---
It would be cool if there was a hex like haunted ground that instead of exposing everyone just injures the survivor
---
The hell is a chicken McDo, anyways?
---
Plus the lack of model-esque survivors really lends well to the games tone and style, imho. 
---
Despite the memes and jokes, Nea not looking conventially attractive is what makes her unique. I'd be worried that a redesign could potentially turn characters like Nea, Claudette, and Meg into more generic versions of themselves that are less identifiable by the people who already liked them.
---
At first i thought its fan made skin. Then noticed Blendetts...
---
Oh but someone else is allowed to destroy your enjoynment right
---
If the killer is so bad they should just assume noed and do the totems, but that's just my opinion lol ü§£. The amount if times I have removed most or all totems in a game for the killers noed to never active is great.
---
Forever Freddy? Pleas explain.
---
BhVR and delays. Name a more iconic duo.
---
Gotta get that entry for the archives man, think of the lore!
---
This isn‚Äôt a good reason to not play. You just gotta ignore the dumbass‚Äôs trying to tell you how to play.
---
Get woke, go broke
---
Yeah, that's pretty normal.
---
&gt; over the standard set forth.
---
You have claimed that a thing that is an opinion is somehow considered to be a standard. You have no backing to this. Your argument hinges on this point, and therefore falters completely.
---
You want to make this grand claim that toxicity is subjective, but then you neglect to include the idea that the only people clamoring that a certain action is toxic are those bothered by it and, for the most part, those not bothered by it aren't going to comment.
---
You have no backing to even begin to prove that majority of players considers something, anything, toxic. All you have is your own bias and a small vocal minority of people that want to complain.
---
Add the fact that the majority of the community is one-sided in a Survivor versus Killer situation, and you have a wholly biased situation where, by your own logic, one group of the spectrum can control the other group despite not being a part of that group. 
---
Your argument is flawed and based on opinions and biases. Under your standard, Survivors would be able to claim anything Killers do as toxic and be correct because they have a majority.
---
Luckily, the definition of a word is not a democracy.
---
I want it
---
Oh man survivors go to bear traps in the shack above the basement like flies to shit, I got accused of camping because I couldn‚Äôt leave for longer than 3 seconds without another survivor getting stuck on a trap
---
So it's what I thought just suffer through 30 min wait times and try to get out of rank 20s as fast as possible?
---
 r/quityourbullshit
---
Honestly I wish you could see the ranks of the survivors you‚Äôre playing against. Not saying it should be added, just a personal want
---
I‚Äôm a newbie and I bought Myers and somehow I‚Äôm good at him so I doubt your bad
---
Aye bro No homo, I‚Äôm trying to see what my boi is packing too
---
*morri*
---
But that's missing the point.
---
The point is that adepting with killer takes much more skill/luck than adepting as survivor does. Not everyone has the required skill to 2-pip as killer, meanwhile, you can adept as survivor just by.... surviving, really. And with the hatch being a thing, it's just adding to the inbalance.
---
Basically, adepting as survivor = survive, adepting as killer =/ killing. Of course, killing is a major part, but I've seen people pip even with one kill. So go figure.
---
This is not lunge distance increase. This is a speed boost making the lunge longer
---
and Oni's Demon Strike is not a lunge. It doesn't stop itself when a survivor is in range. It's closer to Bubba's Chainsaw
---
I'm not sure if Feral Frenzy increases the lunge distance, but might due to, again, the speed increase
---
that
---
It's good for taking down SWF groups who run the game fast.
---
It's much worse
---
Thanks for your notice, I'll change it now! :)
---
These are rank 18's
---
Again stop the incorrect math.
---
And if you run to that gen to get healed you and another person won't work on a gen for 16s each. Which is 32 seconds of not working on gens, if you healed yourself and the other guy does the gen you will be healed in 32 seconds and the gen has been worked on for 32 seconds.
---
In fact this is better, since a solo survivor working on a gen for 32s will do more progress than 2 survivors working on a gen for 16s.
---
Edit: also gen progress is not always more important than health states. It depends on the killer. Against a wraith or ghostface being healed is important, otherwise you'll give him free downs without any chase time, that makes you lose the game faster than any perk could.
---
Definitely Freddy. So what are the dlcs? Is it worth buying versus just the killers? I main killers because I'm ass at being a survivor lol
---
The thing that annoys me is that not only are you absolutely justified in that situation, and we‚Äôre you civil, but neither matters. We can see if the game considered us camping now, you can point out you got Iridescent Chaser with -0 Proximity yo Hooked Survivor but you‚Äôre still a camper and cancer and blah blah blah. Anything is a perceived slight like we‚Äôre not meant to be murdering them.
---
I dont get scared. Just annoyed when I get hit once and that's the end of the game because I can't get away. Been playing as the doctor lately. I really like him. Ghost face seems to be really op. How's Myers?
---
Bill is a fucking beast
---
thanks!
---
As much as I enjoyed this, I just wish the rewards where much lesser than more
---
I hate the flashlight with a passion. Pallets are just delaying the ineviatable haha.
---
The survivor rule book, duh
---
This really humble of them and I rarely get survivors who message like that. That‚Äôs honestly something that puts a smile on my face seeing things like this!!
---
I would play the shit out of dbd mobile fymmmm. Pubg mobile runs better on phones than on consoles which is HILARIOUS and cod mobile is actually really good. When your not home things like that can be handy af.
---
I edited that part too to say like: hey do this challenge and you get this but you're never going to complete it and you have one attempt
---
Edit: I load into games now but get disconnected then sent to the menu
---
As someone who only started playing this game a few weeks ago I‚Äôm definitely going to check out more!
---
Not that particular problem but getting multiple errors of different kinds.  I can't get a game at all.  Been trying for ages now :\  I'm on Ps4.
---
I generally don‚Äôt get it. Like is it pc because on PS4 I‚Äôve dominated every group I‚Äôve have gotten at rank 1 and so have my friends.
---
Why are you in a game with rank 18s
---
Yeah i guess, don't know about rank20, but i imagine at that rank most people play killer, because if no one knows what they are doing killer is the power role and more fun.
---
Also if people just got the game they'll probably play with their friends, getting into higher ranked matches, and rank up that way.
---
So a severe survivor drought sounds plausible in that rank.
---
R.i.p. ):
---
Can't we all get along?
---
Same I keep getting thrown back and forth, I‚Äôve been trying since this morning (free day) and nothing
---
Open three exit gates
---
\* Must be completed in one trial
---
I still occasionally have survivors die during the EGC because they‚Äôre too busy teabagging and going back for points after the doors open. It‚Äôs not fun for me to have to wait minutes after the game is over with my ass at the door because you decided you weren‚Äôt obnoxious enough yet
---
you think I give a fuck if you change your opinion for me? You think the reason I even bothered to reply in the first place is becasue I want to feel better? I was hoping for a civilized discussion or for you to give me a single argument as to why Legion is bad and you instead only tried to defend your pride and attack me. It IS self entitled to not be open to changing your mind and hanging on to your opinion and not even bothering to try and defend it properly.
---
Maybe one day we can all pull our heads out of our own asses to see the other side
---
Thanks dad
---
Bless you for getting this cosmetic. I haven't found a pantsless Myers in any of my games yet D:
---
There are times where I'm in a SWF group and we do really well until about 3/4 of the way through and realize we've done *too* well. Then I'm is like "Guys, no. Him's babby we can't." And then we make stupid mistakes and get hooked a couple of times so killer gets some points
---
Oooh new cosmetic? Gimme some Doctor Tiddies
---
Hatch: Am I a joke to you
---
Yes! Me too.  Can't get past menu, get past menu &amp; can't find a game, find a game and get disconnected for some reason.  Round &amp; round in circles.  Then no network again or host unreachable.  It's madness!
---
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt play this game, it‚Äôs like playing cap guns when your kids and getting into an argument about wether you got shot or not lol Seriously people you expect for us to purposely play ring around the rosy with you lol we hang them up walk away knowing your hiding around the corner to take them down! Get the fuck over it ‚Äúcamping‚Äù we‚Äôre killers! killers kill and survivors don‚Äôt survive every time! cry me a fucking river!
---
Sorry bud but the toxicness ain‚Äôt left, the new perks help w different playstyles so playing good w pig is still possible
---
I just flat out don‚Äôt get streamers, and when I do I save them for if someone is nice or I like something about them pre-game
---
Survivors hear the whooshing if they're outside the Terror Radius, so while Monitor &amp; Abuse makes it "easier" to walk up to people "normally", it also means they're far more likely to hear your whooshing any time you're using Phase Walk out of chase.
---
You'll need to make a decision based on how you use Phase Walk.
---
I‚Äôve checked everything and it‚Äôs just not working   Really sucks :(
---
i have a feeling he gets the bug when killer's screen freezes in the grab animation, rip
---
He's a meme DbD Youtuber that primarily focuses on entertaining builds, video editing and humor. He's probably best known for using the models of killers and survivors as puppets, making them dab after every video.
---
When he's not on YT, he's usually streaming some DbD.
---
Would reccomend him. Farmer John in YT

u can kinda replace m&amp;a with the dead rabbit addon, if u are intrested in reduced tr

Happened to me once too, on PC. The gen in question was the gen ontop of that large building on the swamp map(not the one with the ship). I stood there for a while until survivors were nice enough to start working on that gen. One of them phased into my body and I was able to grab them off, which ultimately freed me. I'm not sure if survivors were even able to see me as I was stuck there or hear my terrorradius.
---
Saaame! It wouldn't do anything since I was only like rank 12 before the reset ( since I split my time ) but it'd be nice.
---
How can you be this braindead? I like how you weren't able to do what I asked. Truth is not an opinion, do you even know the meaning of any of these words?
---
If I‚Äôm a survivor I‚Äôd get streamers because I could play a swf (I don‚Äôt usually but sometimes do) and give my friends a boost, but as killer I‚Äôm going for the pudding

You're supposed to block out their names when you post here because of witchhunting.  Doesn't seem right.

You mean Arkham Batmobile.
---
If you place a trap on someones head one of the boxes get chosen to have the key. This is always random, for each trap.
---
So no it's not really possible to predict which box a survivor needs. Maybe otz was in that area for some time and he figured the survivor has already checked the other boxes. (Will have to check the video when i get back home)
---
You sound entitled and douchey
---
Sloppy sounds counterintuitive since you have a oneshot power that you should use instead of going for normal m1, or am I wrong?

Okay but out of those 2 *not counting r6 bc he is named Lesion* titanfall legion is big boi that go kill everything and legion in dbd is tiny boi that go fast and kill nothing while remaining a joke

Must just be you? Or maybe the rank. Greens/yellow/white has been pretty sodium-free these last few days.
---
He got asked in the chat on multiple occasions if he was using Q and E, every time he said he didn't. Neither did Scott. 
---
&gt;It‚Äôs also why BHVR made a specific mention of it in the hot fix patch notes. The patch notes explain that the turn ratio was intended to limit how much keyboards would make in turning with Oni.
---
Both Scott and Zubat commented on that, saying that they weren't using Q and E so the change shouldn't have affected their turns but it did.
---
Cool concept and art, but doesn't really fit ghostface in my opinion.
---
Question: On which Prestige you get Bloody Dwight Head (or just prestige hat cosmetic)
---
Unless they changed it, each RBT has a predetermined box where the key is. For example
---
RBT 1 has a key in box 2
---
RBT 2 has a key in box 4
---
RBT 3 has a key in box 2
---
RBT 4 has a key in box 3
---
So box 1 doesn't have any keys but they don't know that. If The pig used the addon that makes her only have 2 RBT's and 2 boxes it's a 50/50 as to which is needed but if you do 1 you'll know it's the other. Thr same goes for if you go to 3 of the 4 spots and the RBT doesn't get removed from your head.
---
I wouldn't say replace. I'd keep my rabbits until M&amp;A is unlocked, because using both at the same time is hilarious, you have basically no terror radius during T2, just mind your red glow and you can pull off insane plays, unless it's an open map.
---
On Prestige 3!
---
You have less than 20 hours in the game.  NOED was literally designed for you.  It's for brand new players who don't know how to play yet.  It helps them get kills they probably wouldn't have gotten without it and let's them slowly learn the basics of the role without the stress of needing to play optimally and pressure gens.  Run it and don't think twice it was made for you.
---
My only advice would be to ditch the perk once you've unlocked more perks for your characters.  The biggest problem about NOED is it doesn't teach you a thing about how to play killer.  It encourages absolutely terrible game losing habits like overcommiting to chases and not applying gen pressure.  Run it until you have pretty much anything worthwhile to replace it with.  You'll become a better killer much faster when you do.
---
Lmfao that pose...no blood...typical no mitherüòÇ
---
It‚Äôs not like Otz described, there isn‚Äôt a specific box where everyone will get their trap off. 
---
I think that the intention with the traps was that everytime you got a trap in your head, it randomly picks a box where you can get your trap off. I don‚Äôt think this has been confirmed though and some old data showed that it would‚Äôve been about a 50/50 chance at every box whether you get the trap off or not. 
---
Conclusion: it‚Äôs unknown how exactly the traps work
---
That actually looks sick as fuck
---
So did it just come down to bad RNG for the survivors that all of us needed to get off our traps at the one trap box she was sitting at? Dang that‚Äôs unlucky haha
---
I've always wanted more med-kit add ons. Especially charge add ons.
---
And its like you have only one attempt but if you dont get it you lose the whole level 4 challenges.
---
Thank you, I thought so. I always thought that on prestige I you get Bloody legs, then bloody torso. So I was a little bit surprised that after the first prestige I get a torso
---
Honestly, being a pig main, have never body blocked the boxes. But her traps can be altered with addons and the amount of boxes and such, but her traps are allllllll luck base. Everyone‚Äôs traps can lead to the same box and each survivor doesn‚Äôt have there own box. But if you put in numbers, each box you go to there is a 25% (20 if she uses extra box addons) that you will get your trap off. It‚Äôs impossible to predict what box you will get and she won‚Äôt know either unless she watches your every damn move. Everyone has been asking for her RMD chance traps should be changed as well as her addons but BHVR isn‚Äôt going to do shit. In the end it‚Äôs all luck base and that game you just got reallllly unlucky.
---
I doubt they will I am thinking about this like Destiny 2 all your DLCs where locked to one platform and for another u would have to rebuy them however u could still access all the items from said dlc u just cant do the activities
---
how so.
---
Maybe just play the fucking game and stop worrying about wins. Be a team player and don‚Äôt bitch about everything. Stop worrying about your teammates meta and handle your shit. It‚Äôs a fucking game not real life.
---
How do you know which box is box 2 or box 3?
---
You don't, it's just an example if the boxes were right next to each other. The number doesn't matter, it just helps explain it better
---
Wow that‚Äôs really crazy how unlucky we were that game then haha we all just sat there trying to get past her to the box while she growled at us until we died hahah there were no boxes left for me to try anyway and I‚Äôm guessing the other two were in the same boat unless they gave up before trying all them
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
And then maybe some generic "Do you like scary movies?" sort of things for new/licenced survivors  so they don't have to keep adding new lines. 
---
Or just generic stuff from the beginning. Doesn't matter to me.
---
I know it wasn't in the options then, but I really wish we had gotten a full Scream chapter with Sydney Prescott.
---
mainly because survivors have no idea if NOED is in the game or not and doing 1 totem well u have to do them all and u will have no clue how many are left or how many your team has done adding that to the fact some totems can be hidden really well it is impossible to counter such a powerful perk. short answer doing 1 is a waste doing all is a waste
---
I think they have lowered floors to allow customers to look down on employees, must be a local thing
---
It's not BS.  25% of your emblems and rank is determined by your ability to defend those gens from popping.  Gens are a core objective along with killing survivors.  
---
Also by far the easiest way to consistently win in this game is to end games with a gen or gens up that way the only way they can physically get more than one out is with a key.  Good killers play their games to end them with some of their objectives still up.  Run a perk designed to help accomplish this instead of hedging your bets by relying on a safety blanket to bail you out for a kill when you play poorly.
---
**YOU FORGOT THE POWER GLOVE!**
---
Fuck NOED it gives everyone how faces it HIV
---
Nope.  You don't get this.  Don't be the NOED isn't a crutch guy.  Can't you players just run it but acknowledge that it's a crutch?  You aren't going to trick the community into thinking it's just another perk because it's not.
---
I don't even care about NOED personally I run Small Game to destroy you guys consistently so even soloqueue you guys don't get your gimme down.  It's only when bad killers pop on here to tirelessly defend it that it annoys me.
---
It's easily the biggest crutch perk left in the game and it isn't even close since its competition in Decisive and MoM were reworked ages ago.  It only activates when you as the player fail to defend your 5 objectives.  The devs determine your rank off those.  Lightbringer is 25% of your rank progress.  You're basically competing for a C Letter Grade as killer anytime you bring the perk in game.  All good killers consistently play to end their games with 1 or more gens still up.  This is the most optimal and consistent way to win your games.  Bring a perk that will actually help you achieve this instead of relying on a safety blanket to bail you out of your games.
---
Run the perk if you aren't capable of playing without it yet but please get off the soap box and stop trying to pretend this perk is something other than it is.  It is tone deaf and beyond obnoxious.  You can run it OR be good at killer you don't get to have both.
---
Deep wound doesnt currently go down if you run. This means the timer is almost non-existing - you can completely ignore it. It doesnt go down if you are in the killers terror radius

To me, Frank feels like a re-skin of Julie and not the other way around. Dia de Los Muertos is where it is at! That said, Julie and Frank read to me like the type of couple who would have matching costumes at a party.

In the first plague episode, ‚ÄúIcky icky icky icky ptang zoom boing‚Äù is a reference to ‚ÄúMonty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail‚Äù, where the **Knights Who Say Ni** change to the **Knights who say Icky icky icky icky ptang zoom boing nourrirmmnjuhwgz**.

Great input. I literally said there's nothing wrong with NOED.
---
I have the opposite problem. Can't kill for shit on plague but she looks so damn cool
---
I couldn't find it on the store fsr
---
Can't base it on the chase. Killer will be able to chase you backwards again (google Legion Moonwalk Exploit)
---
Any killer that has an add on for a ranged insta down attack that can be combined with another add on for multiple ranged insta downs is a bit too powerful.

No it is not possible

Thanks for the reply. It was AaronPlaysTV. Their was a glitched hatch spawn, the GhostFace was stream sniping him because he had knew where they were at all times, and the GhostFace tunnelled Aaron to oblivion. It‚Äôs 100% the killer being GhostFace that lost him the streak. It‚Äôs honestly sad you had to lie to make your point look stronger.
---
Pretty annoying, but just play Trapper with agitation and if you're feeling particularly spicy throw in iron grasp and ruin to buy you some time. Trap that basement up and you should get it done quite quickly.

You can skip it entirely by renaming the video file in the game directory.

Ghostface in DBD is not licensed from the scream franchise and is actually an original character. I don‚Äôt think they could get the iconic voice even if they wanted to

David hasn‚Äôt got a lot of action since being taken by the Entity. Be a nice Mikey and let him look up your dress üòÇ
---
Yeah, when OP?!
---
Oh no-
---
Using BHVR's data is not a good source. They shared little to no info on ranks, maps, length of the match, people killing themselves on hook, mori's, etc...
---
It was a flat data that has no correlation to the actual utility and efficiency of a killer.
---
Currently the game Last Year is experiencing huge issues with matchmaking. Currently there is no skill based match making, which is causing solo players to get absolutely rolled by the fiend because Last Year is even more team oriented than DBD.
---
For some reason right now, DBD is also having issues with matchmaking. I.E me playing survivor as rank 3 and getting two rank 9 survivors and one rank 8 survivor while facing a rank 2 killer. I understand this could be because there were no other matches with a sufficient amount of red rank survivors. But there is a fairly large gap between purple rank skill and red rank skill.
---
Though that skill gap has sort of disappear now that they made it so red ranks only go back to rank 5, purple goes back to rank 10, etc...
---
Not a good idea to let those boosted players sit at high ranks since that waters down the solo survivor experience and creates a match that heavily favors the higher skilled killer.
---
I do think we have a lot of similar views, fix haddonfield &amp; work on finding ways to make gens take longer or make games last longer in general, but I think our views on the killers differ.
---
I understand you're speaking from a perspective that looks at the killer's specific potential, but I'm looking at it from different perspectives at different skill levels.
---
Even I dont know what my view is on them though, sometimes I feel unfair cause I slaughter people as nurse. But then I remember that there are shit killers like leather face, where his entire kit is a downside, you get punished for using your ability.
---
I really hope they start to work on core mechanics of both killers and basic gameplay. I'd love to see that doctor rework and the addons reworks for billy, bubba, huntress, and doctor come soon.
---
I've always wondered if they could make gens harder to do in terms of skill check difficulty, frequency, type, etc...
---
Just something similar to the impact EGC and closing hatch made.
---
Tldr, sorry.
---
But yes, the writing is ass and always has been. Hell, 3 of the Trapper stories are basically the same.
---
F
---
I get that that's the general idea, but at the same time, on the title screen, the Survivors are clearly chilling out by the fire. Why wouldn't they discuss tactics, strategy, their strengths and weaknesses, so on and so forth? It's a team game.
---
Mission failed,we‚Äôll get em next time
---
we love og legion :)
---
Could've been worse, imagine buying cells, never getting them and being charged for it because the currency spent of cells has to match your game version.
---
I'm about to make you look real stupid, go check the VOD or ask him or fans what the delay was. I'll tell you rn its 5 minutes but you dont seem to believe anything. 5 minute delay, you wont get sniped, name changing every game, private profiles too. Wasnt a snipe and that facts.
---
This looks like a meme
---
Did this happen to you?
---
You died for the toxins or your fellow survivors.
---
Implying nea isn‚Äôt hot?
---
You still get more bloodpoints from each game in a shorter amount of time and lower overall effort.
---
I'm not salty, I just think it's fucked up to assault underage girls.
---
And how is he a normal person if he does that?
---
In some of the saw movies the attack noise is very similar
---
I guess hearing a lion roar right beside you out of nowhere is what behavior thought was scary
---
The thing is. When I play Claudette I probably get tunnelled/lag switched because they think I‚Äôm a Blendette. No joke I had a wraith chase me for 5 generators.
---
Exactly, but there was a time when half of the players lost their progression ingame and devs granted them like 20 million bloodpoints ignoring the cap. Watch Ayrun's video as a example
---
‚ÄúYou were on your first hook, Meg! Why you DC?!‚Äù
---
Meg: ‚ÄúMIND YO BUSINESS, DAVID!‚Äù
---
I did. I fail to see what that has to do with anything.
---
Could you elaborate?
---
Yesterday I DC‚Äôed because I had a glitch where I heard every sound on the map at once so I sent the killer a message saying sorry and later I said sorry for missing bbq stack. He was pretty cool and we moved along with our day happy.
---
Chickenheart Vickers...
---
I just watched the video and otz actually explauns rather well how he knew this.
---
He scared nea off of Box1, then saw her going to box 2, across the map. He heared the laugh so he knew it was the wrong box and saw her running to box3.
---
Shortly after he saw her aura with BBQ on box 1 again, and concluded that she already checked box3, since she still had a trap on her head he was sure that box 4 held her key, since it was also next to a hooked survivor he decided to play a bit dirty and stay there.
---
Now we will never know if his assumptions were correct, because the nea could have just beelined to box1 from box2, ignoring box3. Box4 had the key at the end, and since nea headed to box 4 after box1 didn't hace the key chances are she did try box3 (because box 3 would have been clearly safer).
---
I agree that Deep wounds isn't necessarily in the best place right now, but there are a number of things here that seem problematic.
---
Skill checks are too random to use as a method for keeping someone out of the dying state. The missed skill checks while releasing M1 on a gen are a much smaller penalty, and enough of an annoyance to most players. If someone has to release M1 and receives a mending skill check, they shouldn't be punished so severely for that. Even from a killer POV that seems crappy.
---
Reducing the bleedout timer, but expecting the survivor to find a place further away to heal doesn't make a lot of sense. Yes, I feel like if multiple people are afflicted with Deep Wounds, there should be a good chance of inflicting further damage to at least one of them, but they should also have a chance to get away. The balance seems tough to achieve - right now I feel like it's tilted in the survivor's favour, but still slows the game for the killer.
---
The "bleedout timer active while not in chase" was actually recently removed because of the ability to manipulate the chase mechanic so the timer would continue running.
---
If mend progress is not saved, the killer could approach a mending survivor so they start running, let them go, and then come back repeatedly, requiring them to restart every time.  With an increased mending time, increased bleedout timer rate while in the TR, and the timer manipulation, you could force someone in to the dying state.
---
Like I mentioned earlier, finding a balance is going to be difficult. Small changes in either direction are ideal for finding balance, but it can take a long time to find the sweet spot.
---
No crossplay between consoles and PC.
---
Hmmm that's fair. How about on top of a chase it's a fixed radius like 20m?
---
It's been happening way more lately, either they don't like the killer they're playing against, Maybe they loaded into a match and had to quickly get out of there...Idk
---
One of your suggestions was removed from the game earlier due to bleedout timer manipulation.
---
They're both cool and for the most part widely liked and respected in the community.  
---
Monto has way more uploads which is cool but when Noob does upload I find myself enjoying his videos a little more.
---
Monto wears on me playing killer at times.  He can be pretty toxic and tryhard in his vids.  Like still slugging the 3rd to last to cheese the hatch spawn even when 2 survivors dc at the start.  Like seriously bro?  Take a shower after that game.
---
Is it the basing the timer on chase?
---
Directions on YouTube
---
Pop goes the weasel is one of my favourite perks.
---
These could be tracings...
---
The emblem system has entered the chat
---
You can't, it's the survivors connection to the servers that are beating the shit out of them
---
Not downed all game... make a killer RQ and Report you?
---
That part isn't too tough
---
Yeah I noticed and took note of that, it made sense to me how he knew that one survivor would be at that box, however I was referring to him saying we know that box has the key or whatever he said which now I know he was just referring to that one survivor. I thought maybe he meant that‚Äôs the box for all survivors to get traps off at, just because my unlucky game where 3 of us died while she body blocked one box. Based on the comments I know now that was just random luck and bad RNG but I thought maybe there was a connection/way to tell this one box is gonna be the key for all survivors
---
Sorry if that didn‚Äôt make much sense haha
---
‚ÄúYou forgot the power gloveeee!‚Äù
---
Horrible... WE all have killers we don't like (Mine are the nurse, Krueger and our Christmas Carol bell striker ghost) but gee, being saved gives my teammates points
---
Yes, the killer is able to follow someone while not actively in chase, forcing their timer to expire.
---
Pretty sure 100 percent fan speed compared to 70 isn't much of a difference in temp due to diminishing returns . Also 70c isn't even bad lmao 95 and up you should worry champ just enjoy the game rather than nitpick
---
*without getting chased
---
when blood warden backfires
---
Hmmm I forgot about that honestly, back to the drawing board I guess
---
This ruined the game for me,. I stop playing for a few months and decayed to rank 18 or 19 and honestly 80-90% of games have 1 D/C or multiple. It just makes the game so much more difficult and boring. They need to make a 5minute or so wait time to join the next game if you disconnect but I know by now that they‚Äôre not gonna institute that.
---
He gets triggered on DC's but I don't blame him they piss me off to he's a good dude.
---
I chased someone as plague shaking no and they went to clense because I was being nice then I just pulled them off and let them get off of me and I walked away.
---
I wanted to play a regular game still but they were like 'nah you are nice lets farm!' Same thing happened with the Catch a ton of people in traps in one game mission.
---
ü§® weird. Thanks for the info though! :) have a good day
---
Don't get why you have to be patronizing. I know how the rights situation works, and FYI, Ghostface IS directly related to Scream. Otherwise the mask is "The Peanut Eyed Ghost". The name Ghostface originated with the movie, and was taken by Fun World afterward, as did that manner of cleaning the blade after a cut, as well as the MO of the killer and the dark humor related. Also, with the new classic outfit, the original "Father death" robe was custom made for the film, so there's that. It looks slightly different but it's called classic in-game for a reason. Legally it's not *Ghostface* Ghostface, but thematically you cannot say that it's just intended to be some random serial killer with no basis.
---
I just got right up their asses and forced them to vault, acted stupid too and faked some misses to get them confident.
---
Boohoo 1st world problems maybe mommy will give you another 20 dollars ?
---
Fuck you, I was playin damn
---
My steam is Zubatlel and I‚Äôm a legacy player so I wouldn‚Äôt go there. I guarantee you if we did go on KYF  then number of killers would do better than GhostFace - Nurse, Spirit, Billy, Freddy, Huntress, Hag and maybe even Demogorgon if you want. Those killers shoot GhostFace right out of the park. 
---
I mean if you play Wraith or GhostFace I will surely get rekt won‚Äôt I? The boring Sloppy/Thana/Nurse‚Äôs will get me won‚Äôt it, darn. Tell Tru3lyTa1entl3ss that perk builds don‚Äôt define how strong a killer is. Lemme show you: Dying Light/Thana/Ruin Plague, the survivor‚Äôs are put in a no win situation, Nemesis/PWF Bubba is kinda meme build but it‚Äôs strong, 3 Gen Hag/Trapper with Corrupt. My point is, any killer can be made viable with the right loadout, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they are strong overall. Tru3‚Äôs definition of viability is fucked and so is his tier list ranking.
---
Literally just happened to me in a match lol, always.
---
So this is what Nea mains think she looks like. Explains a lot.
---
Thanks!
---
Which honestly doesn't make any sense, since she's just some girl with a mask on...
---
I love a good game of chase and fetch. It's my quality - run circles with the killer around obstacles
---
Exactly he doesnt need to be
---
I just wish we could have more than one challenge active as long as it is the same tome
---
"Spirit is still op!!" - that guy
---
I was trying to go for an impotence feeling. But heck, watching Blendettes and TNeas getting moried sure feels good.
---
Wow, you couldn't even get the meme right. It's "git gud". You had one job...
---
And how is that even relevant?
---
What about the walking scrotum that screams at everything?
---
I like how everyone just assumes he was camping and TuNnELing because you said so lol. Sheep.
---
oh id never do that, u want the power to be rechargable, lower base speed, and no more 1 shot chainsaw, i read pretty fast
---
Aaron is pretty toxic, but Ussylis verbally abuses killers and is pretty negative at times. Not many survivor mains to watch that aren't cunty. Check out Fungoose. He's a killer main, but amazing at survivor.
---
Or the player is compensating for small pp. You never know.
---
Even if they have more time to get away, it doesn't change the fact that mending + healing takes up a lot of the time they could use on generators.  They still get affected the same way.  I think 25 seconds is way too little.
---
Legion could move at mach 5 speeds, it‚Äôll never matter as long as they have that 4 second stun after Frenzy. They essentially don‚Äôt have a power for most of the game and their add-ons are utterly worthless. Clown and Leatherface both have a lot of flaws but they‚Äôre still able to actually down survivors.
---
[Here are all of her voicelines with the chapter included.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmg4HuEMJtU) I really don't mind herself doing a roar. And not the animal one. Even though this may sound unpopular opinion but her voice is more terrifying when she starts running at you with ambush than the roar.
---
That would eliminate 95% of all camping complaints
---
Are you actually trying to sell Self-Care as a good perk in 2019? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
People giving killers 110% movement is JUST as boring as people suggesting longer gen time. Just saying.
---
Billy is fine. Rework Legion please.
---
Right??
---
heheheeh
---
He's too simplistic and over-tuned for the game's current balance. He needs more of a learning curve IMO. He's been a crutch character ever since he released, and grants shit players free passes to red ranks (which is why so many people are defensive about him).
---
oh cool thanks
---
Hahahah hopefully your survivors walk right on in :)
---
aaron can be toxic, but most of the people who think he is toxic is just bc he is really good, but he is no where near ochidos lvl of cancer.
---
cool, thanks
---
Aye.
---
I must have missed that Assassin's Creed DLC
---
My Dyslexia read that as you calling him a Handjob.
---
Wrong. He takes skill to use his saw. (Other than his Insta-saw) Again, he should and will stay where he is now.
---
I completely agree with what you said. Deep Wounds ever since the rework have been pointless, even more so after the latest changes and it's obvious that the devs are sweeping the problems under the rag instead of properly addressing them, judging by the changes they keep making to them. As for the downsides, I also agree that they are way too punishing and believe that some simple changes like reducing the fatigue timer, having power recharge start the second fatigue does like nurse and having a portion of the power lost when missing instead of the whole thing would be amazing and would definitely catapult Legion higher from wherever he is now, even with the current pointless Deep Wounds.
---
I'm sure the kid is fine, bud. The oven probably wasn't on/they took him out before it was ever an issue. I understood your concern but hit a joint or something man.
---
Are you a dev?
---
How about killers with so bad connection that the game feels unplayable? Like... hits totally not connecting... and character is lagging back if you are going somewhere?
---
No, but nobody needs to be a dev to know what balance is.
---
What are you on about? Proof??
---
They're Redditors, they must CONSOOM Jojo and Rick &amp; Morty
---
I think if they boosted the base numbers on bottles he'd be better. Gen speed itself is kinda a universal problem
---
He about to yeet her into the oven behind
---
Let's not introduce past tense into this. Yes, the movies have left a mark on the character, even with the DBD version having little homages to Craven's iteration, but Ghost Face is still only just the costume in the end. Besides, I feel it was a better choice to only aquire the necessary rights of the costume itself rather than trying to gain rights from Mirimax for their random Ghost Face killers. If it DID become a Scream chapter, Ghost Face would lack the designs he has now, which adds more variety to the original killer BHVR made themselves. The Classic skin in-game is literally the Fun World Halloween costume (which looks nothing like the custom shrouds the films used) you can buy at a supermarket, party city, or online btw.
---
To be fair, wild aggressive boars sound very similar. I never thought of it as a lion
---
This needs some love, that was great
---
Just looked it up. The "classic" costume in-game is the Scream 4 costume, which specifically is labeled as copyright of the Weinstein Company, who produced the Scream kills. It gets complicated, as Fun World produces an identical outfit, if not the same one, but it's also labeled by them as the outfit from "The movie Scream", so it looks like the Copyright is in layers that are too complicated for people to sift through while they're still making money.
---
Well yes but right now mending is dead easy, it only takes 12s and you only have to hold M1. This is in no way enough of a slow down and the more you rank up nobody heals against Legion anyway. It needs to be scarier to survivors in order to be efficient.
---
I can't disagree with you there, she does look kinda weird, especially compared to how they made her in CGI.
---
then why are u making a pointless comment?
---
Sacrifice 5 survivors. Must be done in a single trial.
---
I got it by waiting for someone to vault a pallet while injured
---
Either way 29k BP is impressive *without* a morri, it‚Äôs even harder with one because it makes the game much shorter
---
not saving mending progress. the killer could hold mending players hostage.
---
screaming when you stop mending. sometimes you have to move for reasons other than what you're trying to solve and a very vulnerable player giving away their position like that isn't fair
---
i don't have an issue with it having skillchecks, but i don't get a quick succession of ones that difficult are needed. you're just making it unfun. like, player's don't get to decide if they get deep wounds. why should they be subjected to that? it's poor balancing for low ranks
---
then the TR one is just old Legion.
---
I wasn‚Äôt trying to be impressive lmao. It was just a funny clip
---
I'd love if capcom could teach bhvr how to model and do proper lighting in their game.
---
A sequel DBD has so much potential. I cant wait
---
he didn't find the clipping tool
---
Clearly you don't read everything though, since he still has 1HKO chainsaw... He just now gets two chainsaw abilities.
---
They already cleaned up the textures a bit on it, I don't think they ever agreed to the proposed complete facial redo unfortunately. Here's hoping one day though, maybe when they do the other survivors.
---
Yeah probably deleted it after the shit storm lmao
---
1st world problems ig
---
Luckily I never had to deal with those :D
---
no
---
they literally can't
---
Never said anything about them having to look attractive (though I wouldn't mind it, Jane kinda has a monopoly on that field imo), just less play-doh-y
---
Why do people think I'm actually that upset over it? üòÇ
---
Like I am semi upset but in a joking kinda way
---
Legion is definitely a priority. [Here's my concept for them :)](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e5pq00/concept_the_legion_rework/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Lay switching call of duty, a classic.
---
Wait!? NANI!? BUT B-BUT DEDICATED SERVERS!?
---
Yea bruh it's not hard to just lag out the server.
---
The stories are awful. They‚Äôre all written like utter garbage and it‚Äôs really hard to listen to the auto-play narrator guy. I really hope they hand over the responsibility for writing to someone else for the next Tome.
---
I love this so much
---
Idk maybe if they made Ebony like the green rarity morri (forgot name) it‚Äôs be balanced for an ultra rare, and maybe add like one were you can morri one survivor during the EGC
---
Balance is not shite players flying through ranks with an over-tuned character. Not everything can just be balanced around 4-man SWF.
---
Aaron is not toxic.  Let's be real, he's just good
---
Are the roots permanent? If so, seems really overpowered. There‚Äôs a reason Bamboozle only lasts 15 seconds.
---
Imagine blocking two of the three final generators with the third add-on. You could hold the game hostage indefinitely if you chose.
---
Ive been playing this game since release, been here through all of it, but these servers finally made me uninstall. In a game where the main thing is looping and it's milliseconds that decide if you make it through that window or to that pallet, servers will never be the answer.
---
Atleast with P2P we could dodge killers with bad connection, to ensure a fun and good game. But nah.. not anymore. Devs not realizing this just proves they have no idea why people play this game.
---
Yo what the fuck are these flying hatchets and mask
---
Boohoo. I didn't know 3rd world countries play DBD.
---
Have u even watched him?
---
Personally was never a fan of the locker stuff. Concepts like that have no place in high ranks.
---
What are you talking about? I dont see any Claudettes or Huntress here
---
you're literally making shit up
---
That dude is just making shit up and got upvoted for it
---
I imagine this ghostfaces dialogue just being like almost lewd snickers and laughter, like the 2010 freddy (ironically). It fits the lore of him just getting excited by murder. I get the voice lines perspective though, I care more about the horror  in this game than a lot of others seem too and a few lines could work well
---
I had to put that vine in there, I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing at the thought of it.
---
Thanks for all the replies! I think I understood NOED‚Äôs issues. I will try to avoid using it once I get better perks (don‚Äôt think Insidious is a better choice for a Wraith). I think I can manage without it if I push survivors off of gens. The most use I made of NOED so far was sacrificing a Claudette who was teabagging at the exit gate.
---
And rightfully so

Lmao what? Ayrun is one of the most toxic people? Ochido, yeah, he's a shithead, but Ayrun really isn't more toxic than the average survivor main tbf.
---
With the full rights, they still could've made Ghostface a new character, as that's a running theme too, it's always someone different behind the mask with different motivations. I love the new costume tbh, I just wish it could be in such a way that Danny was inspired by previous Ghostface murders. All the Ghostface iterations have sounded the same b/c of an in-universe voice changer, despite being different people. Plus, it would've been nice to get Sydney Prescott as a survivor. She's always having to deal with new people dressing up to torment her. 
---
Other than that, Danny is my favorite iteration backstory wise. Love the vibe. In the future, it'd be neat if they managed to get the rights to the scream IP, and could offer Sydney as a survivor and some Brandon James cosmetics+Rodger voice lines for GF, sort of evolving it into a full Scream chapter.
---
I think there's room to experiment within the lore they made
---
Did you do it as Leatherface or were you a different killer?
---
Use botany knowledge and you CAN keep the medkit ;)
---
I think it'd be unique.
---
Legit
---
I strongly believe that skillchecks addition will be a good enough change because, as is, mending is not only really easy but also really boring. You just stand still when the killer leaves you for someone else and just hold down M1 for a few seconds. From what I gathered from friends and others is that playing against Legion is boring because it's boring to just hold M1 for a while and then go on. I believe making mending more engaging will be a fun addition. With the addition of the possibility to be downed if they mess up, survivors will be more scared and look for a safe place to mend which will not only buy the killer more time but also make the game more entertaining for survivors because they actually feel threatened by Deep Wounds.
---
As Leatherface.
---
His xmas sweater is close
---
well duh can you imagine if myers had the tools to procreate
---
He's perfect for smooth-brains who want to rack up wins without trying. He's also incredibly boring, and lacks depth in his kit.
---
The thing is, face camping is a strategy for killers that don‚Äôt know how to play killer. Logically, it would make sense to kill survivors as the killer, but they don‚Äôt understand that it‚Äôs more effective to make them all work to survive rather than take away one players chance to survive at all. It‚Äôs the rank 20 logic
---
Pigs can make scary noises, ever seen Razorback?
---
You‚Äôre probably just off on your counts.
---
I didn't really think about that, maybe yes, cause I thought that the killer would always keep spending the roots throughout the whole game. But now that I think about it, you're right. Maybe they shouldn't be permanent, and it probably should be an add-on instead. I'll see what I can do.
---
Are they really? And no worries, I know it is lengthy, I just wanted a complete breakdown in case someone contests it/in hopes the devs see it.
---
It's just been a thing no matter what Ghostface's origin is that he loves to mock his victims over the phone. Even the Brandon James based version from the TV show had a nearly identical MO, despite having no connection to the killers from the movies. 
---
Tbh tho, I'd take snickers and and laughter over his current whispery noise.
---

---
Anyway, your Billy rework is not really necessary and it's not even a good idea tbh.
---
##The Hillbilly
---
*The Hillbilly's base speed is reduced to 110% from 115%.*
---
###Weapon: Hammer
---
###Power: Chainsaw Lunge
---
The Hillbilly revvs up his chainsaw (his speed is reduced to 90% while revving), and dashes forward with a viscous strike. To activate the power: **Chainsaw Lunge**, **hold down the Power button**. Any Healthy Survivor hit by Chainsaw Lunge is put into the **Injured** state, and afflicted with the **Hindered** status effect for **5 seconds**. Injured Survivors are put into the **Dying** state. Using this power causes The Hillbilly to enter an **extended recovery cooldown**.
---
###Power: Chaotic Sprint
---
The Hillbilly has a **power gauge** that fills up over time (12 seconds). To activate the power: **Chaotic Sprint**, **hold down the Actions button**. Activating the power causes the power gauge to drain rapidly over time. During Chaotic Sprint, The Hillbilly revvs up his **chainsaw** (his speed is reduced to 90% while revving), and sprints in a designated direction, with reduced turning control. He can run up to **32 meters**, and attack with his chainsaw by **tapping the Attack button**. Hitting Survivors with the chainsaw instantly puts them into the Dying state, but causes The Hillbilly to enter an **extended recovery cooldown**. To exit Chaotic Sprint without attacking, simply let go of the Actions button. Upon ending the power, any leftover charge is incorporated into the gauge's overall refill progress.
---
*Perks remain unchanged.*
---
Never noticed until now but his mask doesn't look anything like the real Michael Myers Mask. What's with the mouth? The completely inaccurate nose?
---
And personally DM them to everyone.
---
Just be careful, technically this is a banable offence if a surv gets upset about not having a "real" game :\
---
Again, what are you talking about?? And why are you so pissy? Don't you have something better to do?

And it sucks because they've proven that they can write amazing passages. Take a look at Kate's backstory and you'll see how much emotion and detail they _can_ write. It's downright terrifying to read how she gets taken by the Entity, as opposed to the original character backstories, that mainly boil down to "they went to X and they were never seen again".

Idk why you‚Äôre being downvoted, I was able to download it doing exactly this.

Imagine if Survivors had to actually double pip to get Adepts. Which is the exact reason why Killer Adepts need to be reverted to the 4ks or double pips.

I agree on the narrator. I don't think his voice is terrible, and it feels like the voice actor tries the best for what he is given, but he is just so... out of place with the rest of DbD. It also feels similar to the opening video, much louder than it need be.
---
As for the writing for the next tome, this feels like a rough draft and it needed to be looked at, edited, and improved. I really suspect they are pushing content faster than they can handle, the poor writing, the bugginess of the Archives, and the recent surge of bugs seems far too much correlation to be coincidental.
---
Great.
---
I would more expect Ussylis instead of Ayrun
---
It's a a perk that rewards bad game play you should learn how to play without it &lt;3
---
You‚Äôre welcome, it‚Äôs HostiiTostii XD
---
I mean, it's not really a trap if you know exactly what you're getting.  At that point it's just a transexual prostitute, and if that's your bag then proudly bang your Bangkok B.
---
Hate to tell you bruh but the creator already posted it on this sub
---
You really don't like this guy lol
---
Yikes sweaty!! I can't even deal!
---
He bragged about it as loudly as possible while shouting "op lol" then the nerfs hit and he was so shocked and surprised. He's kinda responsible IMO. Oni controlled like crap on console and was somewhat unplayable, apparently he was turning 1/6 as fast on xbox as he could on pc.
---
Yeah I used to main bill for some solid months, first survivor I p2d, but by then he was at a year and a half and still no cosmetics, so I had to let him go and started on nea for a bit
---
Good doctors can shock you at the right moment.
---
GG I spelt toastii and messed up xD
---
Edit: Fixed it
---
good to know, thx! then I will delete it.
---
There‚Äôs a possibility that they couldn‚Äôt actually get the rights to THE Michael Myers mask- since I‚Äôm pretty sure Miramax own the specific design of the mask in general (for some reason). Either that, or because of the William Shatner look the mask has (since it was originally a Shatner mask), BHVR had to make changes. Halloween is a convoluted franchise when it comes to licensing.
---
Yeah I'm usually the totem cleanser then people give me shit for cleaning dull totems and not doing gens you get points and prevent noed
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
I got a similar vibe when I complained about the Claudette memory above to my friend, who said some of the information was just rehashed. Its a shame really, another facet of DbD that is just not up to code right now.
---
Okay but I‚Äôm talking about red and purple ranks pure salt maybe you should get there and see what that‚Äôs like was never talking about green yellow and white ranks literally....
---
Honestly I‚Äôd love to have customizable hook cosmetics as a killer
---
That's exactly the reaction I want when you see him coming at you!
---
In that context you're right
---
I don't really feel like arguing about it, but spreading out is better. There's a reason why people spread out at red ranks.
---
Yeah. Doubt it will get better too.
---
I‚Äôm somehow not surprised baby legion giving baby meg hatch
---
Not all killers need 3+ abilities. You probably just died against him too many timesüíÄ
---
HELL YEAH TITANFALL 2
---
Which is why I proposed he have another ability with a status effect??...
---
Makes sense.
---
Actually you get a lot of extra BP for hooking during the EGC
---
imagine using STBFL on new Legion, I wish it still worked with their power
---
Finally a accurate representation of the game
---
Pretty sure he was
---
.....what
---
The writing reminds me of how I would ramble on in my essays in middle school to reach the word count.
---
I fucking love this.
---
I always forgot how weird those movies got
---
Strangely, Mobile has *so many good features* that the PC version should really add.
---
I had a gen where I was the only person doing gens because the other survivors kept running around unhooking in the killers face. I ended up having to find the hatch because there was literally zero progress on the gens except the ones I worked on.
---
Wait does it not anymore? I haven't played in months
---
This is absolute fucking garbage.
---
Demanding nudes from underage girls isn't sexual assault? Tf
---
There's proof and screenshots of him doing that. You a troll or some shit?
---
I imagine this ghostface says stuff like "mmm, yeah.." when he stalks and marks. There's this perverse hobbyist undertone to his lore that makes him sooo creepy, even to someone who lives for horror
---
Just have to keep killing them as leather face. took me for ever to get Jake's face
---
What detailed and well-thought-out criticisms.
---
Why the attitude?
---
I'm actually not a baby legion lol I used to be rank 6. Just stopped playing
---
Sorry, i dont have the time to paint them! The demand is too high, it would be a full time job lol
---
Similar issue with killer; hard to rank when so many survivors still DC at low rank and also tend to get too immersed so you don‚Äôt get the required scores. 
---
Then there‚Äôs the issue of it taking so damn long to find a match as a low rank killer
---
athiests lunch
---
I‚Äôm shaking and crying
---
I played ghostface and just tried to get people of the gens that way. Only took 2 games i believe
---
I went against a toxic team that gen rushed and I hooked the innocent survivor. I felt bad camping the hook, but it was endgame. What other strategy is left after gens are completed to secure hooks for such a brief moment in the game's phase?
---
I'd say Bill for Borrowed Time, and Dwight for Bond. It's such an amazing information perk for solo queue.
---
Op said that their meg is lvl 50
---
There's only one reason people go to Thailand buddy
---
Then you probably didn't kill 25 yet. For Dwight and Jake it takes longer to get the faces because less people play them.
---
Funny, I actually have the basement in the works! Just a matter of time. The shop keeps me busy enough as it is with what's for sale atm
---
Okay, appreciate it. Just had to check.
---
just stop lol. I'm not giving you any more of a reaction than that.
---
Or the cropping tool
---
That one time Jonathan Byers regrets taking photos of Nancy.
---
&gt; Stop trying to cover your own ~~laziness for not cleansing the totems~~ **lack of skill in ending chases and creating map pressure/preventing generator completion** by shaming ~~Killers~~ **survivors** for ~~using a different strategy you're not used to~~ **not spending several minutes each that can allow a killer time to snowball by making sure every last Dull Totem is destroyed on the chance that the killer is running 1 out of the 66 perks in the game.**
---

He's a nasty troll. Just makes posts to get reactions out of people. Then deleted them like a wimp.
---
Oof. You're an angry elf.
---
*[Evil Within] appears*
---
I wasn't sure if he had 0 in t1 because I was fuzzy on undetectable's details. Thanks! Maybe I can just swap for the rabbit. Doesn't he basically have 0 in EW2 with monitor and rabbit? 16 -8 -8?
---
billy is fine honestly. He's high tier and more powerful then most killers, but he plays by the rules and rewards players for skill rather then cheap gimmicks (cough *old legion* cough *cannibal*)
---
Jesus Christ
---
I made a wholesome Christmas post trying to bring positivity to the community. An extremely small amount. But still some. This is why everyones so divided in this community. No matter what happens everyones just at each other's throats. Calm tf down
---
With *The Trapper*, blink and hit¬†all 4¬†Survivors *5* times each in a single game. Missing a hit will result in progress regression.
---
Push through. Allows you to get better at skillchecks overtime as well.
---
Of course it's not the same, and if you read, which you clearly didn't, I never said they were.
---
I'll bold the lines for you since you clearly are intent on misconstruing me.
---
&gt; Think of how moronic it would be to **strip someone of their free expression if they were to say they hate apples**, but you love apples, and your family has 10 apple orchards. **It's no less moronic when you change the topic of what is being hated**. So long as that person isn't trying to burn down your apple orchards, **let them think and believe what they want**. Thoughts require actions to actually be harmful, but until then, they're harmless
---
If that's still not clear enough for you, let me break it down one more time.
---
I'm specifically talking about someone's ability to express themselves freely. It doesn't matter if the topic of their expression is one thing or another because they're allowed to express it regardless. Principles are principles all the time, not just when it makes you feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. Everyone's happy to be the fascist whenever it's benefiting them, but if the roles are reversed, indignation erupts.
---
No, it doesn't.
---
Not everyones a God player. And not everyones trying to be a god player. I'm not anymore.
---
They don't have different lunges but weapon sizes make it look weird
---
No, I didn't, but clearly you have either an issue with reading comprehension, or are intentionally misrepresenting my statement to farm karma with your virtue signaling.
---
I don't know how you can draw that conclusion when I'm speaking specifically about how moronic it is to take away someone's ability to freely express themselves because you don't like what they have to say.
---
Fascism isn't ok.
---
Lmao right this challenge is so EASY I‚Äôm a rank 1 survivor main with 21k hours btw 
---
^/s
---
Rank 8 survivor in Midwest US, I was getting 15 min queue times last night.  One game was 3 purple ranks and a 20 vs a rank 16 demo.  A 15 minute wait to bully a baby killer twice my rank.  Sucked.
---
He fly
---
I wish Blood Warden applied Exposed while they're standing inside the gate lasts for 2 seconds if they leave. It'd make hanging out in there so much riskier
---
I love to main Demo, too. Even though it is such a bitch to play as it a lot of the times.
---
Yeah there is no way I‚Äôm taking anything you say face value especially from a blind hater of him
---
As a survivor, crouch 500 times while in a chase with the killer. If killer proximity camps progress is reset.
---
because most dbd players are suck and  tired of unasked for nerfs instead of addressing  actual balancing issues such as legion, pig, cannibal, clown, totems, noed, keys , ebony moris, lag issues, crashes, matchmaking, and ranking. It's like every remotely powerful is expected to be nerfed to the ground. this nerf your suggesting is unwanted and uncalled for.
---
if I wouldve recorded the whole game i wouldve showed how he face camped the jake and our teammates opened the gate before we could even save him
---
I don't use baby killer as a negative term. Just usually another way to say new. Higher rank you are the less you say it
---
I'm not a blind hater, it has been shown his DMs incriminating him......
---
Bro how old are you?
---
Try Tier 1 Myers
---
If you see jake in a lobby switch to leatherface and tunnel his ass, that mask takes FOREVER to get from normal matches. You can even let the others escape. Not sure if it counts moris or sacs only though
---
pretty sure you can still do that, happened to me the other day
---
Same tbh
---
I had NOED, opened the gate myself and got lucky they thought I was giving them a free escape.
---
they were red ranks so camping is garbage for them
---
People who tapp, deserve to get clapped
---
-piggy 2019
---
Haha he said he is a baby killer fucking classic
---
Thanks for the respectful opinion. Those are really in short supply. The biggest issue with Billy is that he's low-risk / high-reward, and has no cooldowns. He's also incredibly bland, seeing as he only has one very generic ability. I see Billy as the character that noobs pick because of how cheap he is, and then they end up in high ranks complaining about Survivors being OP. This is further evident when you go back and look at BHVR's tier lists, which place Billy in the top 3 best AND most-picked Killers since the game's launch. No other Killer has maintained that placement for that long. It's not as if he's stayed around mid-tier, which usually indicates balance. He has literally NEVER been overtaken. And in my experience, if you're not SWF, he's almost always guaranteed a 4K. BBQ is all he really needs to down each Survivor within 3 - 4 minutes. Add insta-saw to the equation, and he's basically a god.
---
Precisely.
---
I was hard camped while doing the blind challenge and wasn‚Äôt even mad about it. I don‚Äôt understand why they pushed people in to playing a ‚Äútoxic‚Äù way when it‚Äôs already such an issue with both sides.
---
Ah! Good man. My only problem is that I used to really enjoy running ace in the hole with it, but it doesn‚Äôt guarantee any extra charge addons, and it sucks having to run all three and use up almost all your perk slots.
---
Saw your one post the player base became much more toxic while you were gone
---
Could be a challenge, I hate how these challenges are causing this but that might be what they were trying to do. Doesn‚Äôt make it not toxic
---
YES
---
I can see that. Never going to change unless both sides do something about it.
---
I know, it doesn't make sense.
---
I had to do this for the jake mask too :( felt so bad I‚Äôd always try to make sure they maxed their boldness and chase scores before being tunneled to death üíÄ
---
He got so close to doing a no damage run of DS2, so close
---
Lmfaoo I might try playing as him, everytime I play as a survivor I'm always stepping in traps and hating myself for it haha
---
But he found the screenshot buttons
---
yeah true, can admit I've had to sweat a bit for the iridescent emblem challenges
---
Reasonable honestly
---
Thicc bunny mama
---
The worst part about that whole shitshow was when people lost their legacy skins and BHVR refused to give it back to them. To add icing on top of the cake, people were banned if they hacked it back in. I‚Äôd be pissed.
---
If not classic bloody mask, bear mask for sure, it looks so sick
---
ah makes sense, luckily they didn't mind as they got max points :P and in end game chat they said thank you, but i do understand what you mean :)
---
i‚Äôm not sure who my favorite is. Probably Bubba, simply because TCM is epic and i‚Äôm a masochist
---
He doesn't need to be touched. He's a good killer, and he isn't super busted. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Well, BHVR seems to ignore buff requests, so this is where we end up. Might as well try to balance out other aspects of the game, while Legion, Pig, Leatherface, and Clown collect dust.
---
Also, Hillbilly has NEVER left the top 3 best and most-played Killers. Not even Nurse has achieved that. Spirit did briefly, but she hasn't been around for 3+ years.
---
I like the manifestation and snap out of it suggestions oh, those would be amazing. I literally just started playing him 2 days ago and he is incredibly fun. Definitely looking forward to his rework though.
---
Remember when you lower ranks and the person just started playing one of those two and you fucked with them and then they kept playing and got gud but now you‚Äôre not having a good time
---
Good player can manage their resources.
---
Of course you get extra BP. Yet if that's all you managed to do in the match, you will have almost no points and an 'Entity Displeased'.
---
Meanwhile I'm still waiting for BHVR to fix the rank update error, but at this point I don't think they are competent enough to fix it.
---
Have you seen Quentin?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt tap, makes you better at skillchecks
---
What kind of red ranks have you gotten into? Oh yeah, just solo complete the mid gen, which happens almost never. Completing key objectives fast is the best way to survive and reason why survivors are extremely strong.
---
I'm on PS4 and it takes me maybe 15 to 30 seconds to find a match.
---
It's called baby dick syndrome.
---
Same. My main problem with him is that he's an anti-loop killer that cant properly anti- loop without a lot of practice. That's why a lot of my predictions are based on Shock Therapy. Poor new players just get pre-thrown on anytime they start to shock at a pallet. Still love the killer to bits tho
---
Some people have no other options. This is going to likely make them a boatload of cash once it releases. Win/win.
---
Bruhbba
---
I think the video explains itself. I suspect the killer was in on it too since they didn't kill me. Here to vent, mostly, but hopefully this guy gets taken care of.
---
Tapping takes longer
---
This guys videos are so cute.  Love the demo and hags friendship
---
Same thing just happened to me but it looked like I was still on the killers arm
---
@mochimochialice commission, turned out so well!!
---
It was first thing that crossed my mind when I saw this post. Im sorry that people from different fandoms sharing their memes and shit upsets you
---
That‚Äôs, a lot. Of, punctuation. 
---
FTFY ;)
---
Aaah there have been so many instances in rs6 where I‚Äôm trying to call out Lesion to my friends, but say Legion instead
---
Insta-saw and no cooldowns say hi. Also, this is a rework that aims to balance him, and add more depth to his kit. High-skill players will be rewarded, while scrubs won't be able to get free rides to red-ranks, then proceed to bitch on forums about Survivors being OP.
---
Billy is one of the most balanced killers around with a power that has many uses. He doesn't need a nerf, nor a second power. Everything below Billy is underpowered, everything above Billy is overpowered. Billy is at the point every killer should be
---
Old quintet face should be a cosmetic eventually
---
I only DC when the killer is running 3 or 4 gen regression perks and is just patrolling a cluster of gens from the start of the game. It is basically holding the game hostage, and I'm not going to sit in one game for 30+ minutes slowly trying to progress one of those gens in solo queue. It is becoming a quite common strategy, and it's a shame. I play everything else out. Solo queue survivor is a terrible experience and I think more DCs is a result of that.
---
Was a joke not that deep damn y‚Äôall fools are a trip goddamn
---
These are always very funny lol
---
I already said his Insta-saw add-ons weren't okay, clearly you don't read. Not every killer needs a change like your proposing. Even then, billy is at the bottom of the list of killers that desperately need changes.
---
stay near walls and other cover, break line of sight, play more immersed than usual. use the directional lullaby to better pin down where the hatchet is coming from.
---
tl;dr, don't get hit
---
I‚Äôm a legion main u pleb Issa joke
---
billy is the most balanced killer in the game, instead of editing him to be more like other killers, other killers should be edited to be more like him.
---
Which movie is this?
---
Sounds like spam.
---
He's not wrong though.
---
Considering the thread we‚Äôre under is shitposting an memes that‚Äôs what I was going for
---
Sorry. I misread your post... 5 times, lol.
---
In my defence, I'm sick af.
---
oops, u forgot to say that the best perks for EVERY killer are BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's Calling, and NOED
---
Tl, dr: he's fast as fuck boiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
---
Billy's win and pick-rates say hi.
---
Pablo escobar is actually a super underrated killer.
---
&gt;And no, I'm not doing a TL; DR. I'm not in the mood for it.
---
darn
---
Just exit the game and rub one out, its what I do. Hell, I do it on the menu screen sometimes.
---
lol awesome. white monster loves jesus
---
I don't think the killer was hacking but the Bill was.
---
Hexy fanboy.
---
This is what dbd could look like if bhvr weren‚Äôt  bad at rendering
---
All Killers should be basic and braindead. Got it.

Thats a cute mf boi

That's Reddit
---
She isn't making the noise, in the movie.
---
Though, I believe the Entity morphed her into a monster.
---
Patrolling is a legit technique for the killers imo, even it's an unfair one. But my favorite technique to not get caught is runing in circles around certain obstacles like a Benny Hill movie. It's pretty unfair as well since the killers can't really make use of their higher speed and most commonly their skills - even the huntress is pretty petty with that tactic and the other players can clear the gens.
---
Cod has never had dedicated servers lmao
---
You get a message from the admins? I did saying it's under review
---
billy takes a lot of practice to do amazing with. Its almost like he was made to be basic bc he was one of the original 3.
---
do you honestly think he is op?
---
And with thw doctor rework coming he'll become even more annoying to play against
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAAHHA
---
üêê
---
As someone who knows what abusive/negligent parents are like, I want to personally beat the shit out of whoever did this, even as a joke.
---
That's close. Every extra Survivor on a gen reduces the efficiency by 0.1 charges per second _per Survivor_, meaning that at 2 people work at 180%, 3 people work at 240%, and 4 people at 280%. It has drastically diminishing returns, and Prove Thyself honestly doesn't help all that much either.
---
Prove Thyself doesn't increase the repair efficiency based on default, but instead the current repair efficiency before debuffs and toolboxes. Given a 0.9 c/s repair efficiency from 2 people, it would increase it by 10% of _that_ efficiency, so each Survivor would have 0.99 c/s, which the generator progress bar rounds to 1.0, and thus tells you you have no efficiency penalty despite the fact that you do, albeit very small, and will be complete in 40.4 seconds, down exactly 4 seconds from 44.4 without PT.
---
Take that to the extreme with 4 Survivors, and every Survivor's efficiency is increased to 0.91 c/s, resulting in a 22 second repair, down ~6.5 seconds from default, 28.5 seconds.
---
I really don't know why people use it. A 4/5/6 second save on a gen with 2/3/4 people on it is just not worth an entire perk slot. Most of the time you don't even start with everyone at the same time, so the efficiency bonus isn't even used to the fullest, and crowding on a gen is a bad idea anyway, since not only do you have to factor in everybody moving to a new gen once it's done, but also the fact that if the Killer is near, now _everybody_ is pressured all at once.
---
I find killer games in 15-30's
---
Survivor games are nearly impossible for me.
---
Saying that killer is just ‚Äúsalty‚Äù because a survivor is being toxic is stupid, and that‚Äôs why you got downvoted, it‚Äôs not relevant, so that‚Äôs what happens and it‚Äôs not bullshit, it‚Äôs just you saying stupid shit, and you being a legion main doesn‚Äôt change anything, I‚Äôm a legion main and I don‚Äôt go around saying stupid shit
---
Sonic Bam Bam with Tinkerer has been my build of choice recently for him. It's not really as good as the Infectious Fright slug build, but god damn is it fun to just zoom to a gen with no terror radius and scare the fuck out of some pple.
---
Tinkerer, Ruin/ Corrupt, PWYF, Nemesis
---
Yes a lobby of 20 people is p2p.
---
A Joke is supposed to be funny lol
---
The Irishman on Netflix. Prepare yourself it‚Äôs almost 4 hours long but it‚Äôs good. Scorsese.
---
Billy requires mechanical skill in order to use the chainsaw effectively enough to fly to red ranks, and is honestly on of the most balanced killers, addons aside. This ~~rework~~ nerf would make him the weakest killer in the game by a large margin.
---
You fucking google it
---
How hard is it to do?
---
Yeah lol. I hope to start playing dbd shortly but I dont have a computer üòî
---
Idgaf about the downvotes I just don‚Äôt need the notifications over a joke your big brain didn‚Äôt get. 
---
How good does it make you feel telling me my jokes aren‚Äôt funny, what‚Äôs your point here?
---
Imagine this mf popping out of a ground anus and ripping your shit
---
They‚Äôre funny when you understand them
---
How good does it make you you feel making a bad joke that everyone disliked? What‚Äôs your point here?
---
I understand it you leaky cumsack
---
The only bug I had on ps4 with skill checks was that they where the only delayed thing in the game, when I used a certain monitor. Really weird, but maybe if you change your TV monitor it may fix it?
---
Yea, for sure. I just didn't really understand why the killer didn't kill me. Instead, bill kept reviving. Pig would then let me just do my thing for a bit before slashing me again. It felt like they were both messing with me... but you're right, Bill def was the hacker.
---
You missed the point. The point is they aren't chasing anyone. They are ONLY patrolling those gens and basically waiting for the survivors to get bored and give up. I've seen it 3 times just today. My ego isn't so fragile as to just sit there for 30 minutes running in a triangle not allowing anybody to really play the game just to try and get a 4 kill. I'd rather play the game.
---
It makes doing daily quests difficult as hell
---
Jingle bell noises of death.
---
My point was to shitpost and yours is just to bully or make yourself better on here than you do in real life because you have nothing better to do.
---
Stop w it already I get the point, jokes not funny, move on.
---
(PS4) What do you mean by performance issues? I'm getting severe lag today and can't land any hits on anyone. Grabs aren't working, getting pallet stunned when not even close enough to the pallet, blinded when survivors are behind me, and survivors appear to be teleporting. It's really frustrating when I can't get a hit on someone who's healing another, or as they're vaulting a pallet. 
---
I've already checked my internet speed, and my connection so I doubt the problem is on my end.
---
I just go to the KYF screen with trapper, make him face me and rub one out while I imagine him choking me.
---
As long as I can't play with my ps4 accounts data I won't play it.
---
So you're saying that Nurse is underpowered because stats say so.
---
We got incorrect stats and basing anything on them is a mistake.
---
All platforms are mixed together, so we can't tell exactly what needs to be done where and play/win-rates on one platform can drag all the stats in one direction
---
We got "all" and "redranks" so basically we got nothing. Only rank 1 stats matter when it comes to balance.
---
do you really believe that all killers have ~70% killrates now? since the last stats, all killers gained around 20% for nothing.
---
we don't know how DCs and Moris are counted
---
and when not looking at broken stats we got and talking about billy himself
---
His strongest part is the fact that the power is good for:
---
1. Mobility, to get around the map. All killers are getting charges, teleports and shit like that so it's not an issue at all
---
2. Using in chase, but Billy is STILL loopable. His power can be used effectively to cut out escape routes or make you not vault a window, but in the end, you can force him to M1 you if you loop correctly.
---
3. Punishing mistakes. Being out of position against Billy is an easy death. Just because other killers aren't as good at punishing it doesn't mean it's too strong and, as name suggest, mistakes are something you should avoid as a Survivor.
---
I'm actually a girl lol but yeah. Glad to see nothings changed
---
Maybe it's me but in this photo she looks like Mila Jovovich FFS...or however  you spell her name...üòÖ
---
Take a break for a while. You‚Äôll feel better. When you return, everything will feel fresh and fun again, and your rank will have lowered from the rank resets. If not, there‚Äôs always the option of getting a full team of friends. Playing with my friends makes this game a thousand times more fun. :)
---
Just an indie studio guys. It‚Äôs better than being released with bugs. They‚Äôll fix the bugs that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs delayed. They‚Äôre doing their best. Programming is hard. 
---
____
---
Did I cover all the excuses this sub makes every patch?
---
You mean he butchered STBFL on the two killers where it shines exceptionally well. Pig and Demo aren't so strong that STBFL is unfair on them.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eb3g1g/connection_issues_ps4/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Freddy is 1st? Nurse is 5th? Huntress is 9th?  I‚Äôm what world is GF above nurse? That doesn‚Äôt make too much sense to me. Care to elaborate on the order you placed these killers in?
---
Nothing changed with PWYF but there's a new perk that synergizes very well with it. The new killer Oni's teachable perk [Nemesis](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Nemesis) helps switch your obsession around every time you get stunned, so basically everytime you eat a pallet you get a free PWYF stack.

Also, it's just been pretty popular recently among some of the top content creators for the game so it's just kind of the trendy perk right now. The same thing happened with Tru3's Ghostface build, Monto's Bubba's Basement, and Otz (I think?) doing double stun with DS/ Head On. A lot of the popular meta tends to trickle down from the content creators in this game and PWYF is the flavor of the week so to speak.

Why do people think Nea needs a facial rework to look pretty? She doesn‚Äôt need to look ‚Äúpretty,‚Äù she needs to look like a person, which she does. Not every video character needs to look like a supermodel.
---
So you played like a toxic asshole and are shocked when people decide they don't want to play with you? Your shit score and bad game is entirely your own fault.
---
Dead by devs??
---
Your no fucking dev
---
You obviously don't know what P2P even is lmao.
---
Eh sometimes it right behind you if you just turn the corner sometimes it's still up over 10 minutes later with all 4 looking for it.
---
In my experience it's *usually* faster just to get ruin popped and it lowers the chances of having someone get greedy going for greats near you and missing their skill checks
---
Those perks tho
---
Off-topic, but i agree with your Tag so much
---

Whoops, shit. Isn't skillchecks bound to one of the trigger buttons, if the option is available, I imagine a face button would be an improvement in the same way :/
---
PC on grim pantry nurse will blink straight into the basement if you are anywhere close to the shack.
---
I'd never force Trapper to watch me. He's too pure.
---
AWOOGA
---
We have both restarted the app and console many times. This has been a multi day issue.
---
That day I learned it's really hard to play with just one hand, I bumped in a lot of walls and missed a lot of skill checks.  
---
That trapper was a sweetheart though, he had the patience and just wanted to finish his archive challenge.
---
Yeah I watch him maybe once a week.  He mainly just does meme builds. Hardly ever does anything toxic honestly. Guess just different opinions on toxic
---
I totem search because I honestly believe nobody else will. Still like to practice hitting my ruin skill checks to keep me fresh and not a noob but for the most part 100% agree with the low FPS being an issue when trying to hit them. It really depends on the killers ping which is str8 cancer.
---
You mean the raisin man?
---
What is this template?
---
This has been the case like 2 years ago
---
This is a less toxic way to do it than the one I used. Huntress with insidious. Hooked 1 person in the basement and waited. Literally took 15 seconds to do this one.
---
Perklists are overall good, but tiers are not.
---
Just because I can attempt to do the gen doesn't mean the whole team is, if I go and find the ruin and everyone starts working on gens again without stress it's better for the team. I generally know all totems spawns on every map so it doesn't take 10 minutes to find. I also use detectives hunch so if I get far into the gen with no ruin skillcheck I just commit and then check everything that gets marked.
---
I don't have anything against that. What annoys me is specifically JoJo fans trying to make every thread about JoJo, even when the only connection is something really strained like "JoJo and Halloween both have piano music."
---
I just want some threads on Reddit not to be about JoJo.
---
r/streetwear (I like it)
---
Nancy will be fucked
---
well it is the fact she has nothing to help her in chases that makes her less good on a tier list hence why nurse is the best but that doesnt mean the lower tier killers are trash and shouldnt be used bc that simply isnt true any killer can be good in the right hands just how Tru3 made the wraith look very strong with consistent 4ks in high ranks
---
Connor my baby
---
Is it bad that when I play R6 I can only ever play Lesion? I don't actually know if he's good or bad but I just like having those little gus.
---
Nah more like 25k bps and 3 rift fragments
---
People don‚Äôt cleanse at high ranks. And she is literally an m1 killer with no ability after everyone‚Äôs broken. Meaning a good survivor could run you around the map while his teammates do all the gens in the time it takes you to down one
---
I‚Äôd be fine with just changing his shackles to Christmas lights. I don‚Äôt play demo but I‚Äôd buy that shit
---
this is a lot you're asking for. some of these are cool. snap out of it is already challenging enough especially for new players as it is so I strongly disagree with that. the rarity of his add ons are fine? especially saying that interview tape is his best add on, you want to lower the rarity? with Freddy's dream pallets, he has to hit you or wait for you to get into dream state for his fake pallets to work. doctor just has to shock you 2-3 times in a chase, making both chases too easy. I like the concept of it, but unless they nerf the speed for them to gain illusionary pallets that seems too op. 15% speed slowdown is too much to be shocked by, especially considering that other killers with slowdown abilities don't have the advantage that doctor has that he can just shock and hit. Freddy has to hit or wait, clown has a limited amount of bottles. everything else I like a lot.
---
Just main Ace
---
Well maybe speed addons??
---
Yeah there are quite some of those players. But now that you say this.... Had you today a match with MadMausi?
---
I imagine it might be a NAT Type issue or generally the servers crapping out on DBD. I had a lot of failed match connections the last week or so. Could be related. Usually it solves itself, when I had this issue I usually have to play something else for a while.
---
Most of the time I think this sub is just all killer mains
---
probably for the same reason Freddy is seen as the most powerful killer bc nobody likes to play nurse
---
If I have prove thyself and a friend w me who has a toolbox I have no problem slugging through it just as someone else said in the comments on console it solely relies on the killers connection so if it‚Äôs high latency you hear the skill check and your gen just blows up because the skill check ZOOMS by because it took a second to show at first. Console is honestly horrible for dbd in a lot of aspects but it‚Äôs just so addictive and I‚Äôve put so much time into it I‚Äôm not gonna stop now.
---
Nah but is there?
---
except its every clown i go against.
---
Im Quentin main. How can you not love such a cutie face :3
---
A cute girl is a cute girl *wink*
---
I once had a game as pre rework freddy, and after the match, one of the survivors berated me for using an overpowered killer
---
I main him... I'm playing him now... he is quite good.
---
you don‚Äôt have to come off as a douche with your reply
---
I would agree on the NAT type, but we can play literally every other game just fine. With the servers, how long does that usually last?
---
I don‚Äôt play Demo as he can be tough on console...
---
But if this was a cosmetic and heck, if the lights lit up like in the show with his chase music, I‚Äôd throw my money at it so darn quick and give him another go. Can you imagine black painted letters, K, I, L, and L twinkling? üò±
---
Dammit
---
I'm not very sure. Usually after 3 tries me and my friend would just play something else for the day. Sorry! Wish I knew more.
---
Who cares if he‚Äòs good? There‚Äòs nothing about Billy that is unfair or cheap. And even if there was, nothing is wrong with his base kit. You can only really nerf his speed if you want to see him being nerfed, so REWORKING him is absolutely unasked for. Yeah, the devs are very slow when it comes to picking up on a Killer that needs to be reworked, but that doesn‚Äòt mean we‚Äòll have to stop voicing our concerns or in your case address issues that don‚Äòt exist. Doc‚Äòs getting a rework and he really needed it, so they‚Äòre definitely listening albeit not quick to act.
---
Amea bazinga tocu a pigaly wiggley edit: yes I speak plague
---
He‚Äôs a good survivor, he doesn‚Äôt bm or talk shit about the people he plays against, and he doesn‚Äôt disconnect? What‚Äôs so toxic about him?
---
This happened after I got out of a match. The "an unknown error occurred" thing popped up, then instead of the game going to the main menu screen, I got this screen. It's like a combination of the survivor menu with the main menu/the killer lobby menu. I'm not able to actually go into another menu, so I guess I have to force crash and restart the game now.
---
It‚Äôs ok, I appreciate the help. Thank you.
---
Kill 2 people. Be nice and farm with the last two, try to keep them close to each other, preferably on the same gen until they finish. As soon as they pop final gen slug them both with NOED, open a door, then hook.
---
You can run an injured build without no mither sir, it just keeps you going so you don‚Äôt have to waste time looking for someone to heal you / healing in the corner with self care like a jackass
---

---

I'll work on the Gen until the killer comes by, then I'll keep an eye out for the ruin as I'm running from them lol.
---
Nowadays queue times are pissing me off. I really like DBD, don't get me wrong here, but I don't have enough patience and time to wait for 10-15 minutes to play 1 game. According to steam charts there is almost 30k current players (right when I write this comment), but it still takes around 10 minutes to find a game. This really needs to be adressed by BHVR.
---
I wonder how many drugs Sam was on when he thought of that

That's the pettiest use of a perk I've seen so far, I love it.

Yes I have to know how is it possible for baby dwight to be so fucking adorable
---
Maybe. I'd be open to anything that makes it not dog shit.
---
it could also be an issue with wiring in your controller. have you tried a different controller?
---
Thanks for the help :)
---
her vomit helps in chases pretty well. you can let them loop you for 30 seconds or so while vomiting on them and immediately they‚Äôre injured. this is usually their weakest point if they used pallets or had the window blocked off. plus the disease spreads to others so you‚Äôre practically just running noed the whole match.

---
Guys no pls I just wanted to let the baby david live
---
well the problem is even if u can insta down that means u have to catch them first with ur m1 and usually unless u know how to play m1 only and the survivors arent dumb plag has problems
---
U realize we‚Äôre under shitposting an memes
---
Freddy has the most kill % but there are so many factors that go into that. His slowdown ability is great with his built in map pressure but I never see Freddy on red ranks. And when I do being asleep isn‚Äôt a big deal at all.
---
I often don't remember the people I play with, sorry!  
---
But this was a match from last week, so probably not \^\^'
---
While I agree that JoJo fans can be annoying with forcing their fandom memes and references everywhere I have to say that every other fandom does that. People just like to laugh and make other people with same sense of humor or taste in shows laugh and I think that's completely okay. Just let others do and enjoy what they are doing when they don't do any harm to anyone with their actions.   
---
Sorry for my english but I hope its easy to understand what Im saying.

or you get downed instantly by any of the stealth killers, give a constant stack into perks like thanatophobia, or give away your location due to your cries of pain... Each hit is so crucial, and the killer knows when you are running no mither, the slight benefit does not outweigh any of the draw backs, let alone all of them
---
I feel 2 hits would be easier to get rather than 3.
---
You got a link to the leaked challenges?
---
They‚Äôre really hard to see and force attackers to back up and remove it. They also make a really loud sound when they pop. He‚Äôs pretty good, I see him a lot in games.
---
Ruin greatly increases the time it takes to complete a generator. If a generator normally takes 80 seconds, and maybe it takes 100 seconds for the killer to patrol a big circle around the map, checking each generator, it's possible you could finish the gen before the killer returns. But by adding Ruin, which adds time to the generator, its far more likely you'll still be on the generator by the time the killer circles the map and returns to you. So survivors try to cleanse Ruin before doing gens to take away that larger chance of being caught.
---
You think you're wasting time when looking for the ruin totem, but its not that much of a waste or risk, because you're typically not going to be too close to generators. Therefore not specifically where the killer is patrolling. If the whole team decides to look for Ruin together, and avoid generators until it's gone, it spends time, but is not a problem because everyone is less likely to be found than when at a generator. 
---
So there, now you know survivors aren't "giving up" when they leave a gen to try to cleanse Ruin, rather they're trying a different strategy increase their odds of survival.

Xbox, auto aim always messes up my hits, and it lags whenever im chasing a survivor and I swing. Especially oni slam, lags from the second i tap the trigger until i let go and i miss half my hits bc of it. Plus the turning should be increased a bit because i hate how all you have to do to counter the slam in the open is turn back toward him. And i cant seem to control short slams and the lunge slams. Hes way too hard to play on console

Sure if you make it 4 with either/or. 3 unhooks and protection hits is kinda EZ

With the new ranking system I got sent back 2 killer ranks (11-13) so it‚Äôs not so fun for me. Actually the opposite of fun because it makes me want to de-rank but I‚Äôm not bout that just to play a few games to get back to the same rank.
---
good job, I hope you have your fun, make the most of it while you‚Äôre still a low rank because you‚Äôll be in purple/red ranks in no time if you keep getting all iridescent emblems!
---
Just no to gen tapping.  It takes longer than powering through it and more importantly you'll never improve as a player if you do it.
---
I feel like you‚Äôre the type to complain that killers are OP
---
Yeah I get if people dont like it, but we were all trying to get some of the harder archives out of the way so we wouldn't have to throw games. It wasnt that he didnt want to farm that made me mad, it was that he pretended to be interested and then slugged us
---
In T4 Myers can break the 4th wall.
---
Oh so the gens were powered and so he defended his only hook.
---
Got it
---
Fucking survivor mains
---
Yeah I understand that, lured you in and then slugged you
---
He's one of the most comfort picked operator, it means that he's easy to use
---
Vs those ranks you can win with any killer.
---
Here I am
---
Wow thanks a lot! :)
---
I disagree, I think entirely complete mechanics can be introduced, I mean, remember back when we didn't have any proyectiles whatsoever? Now we have hatchets, pebbles, fucking ***vomit*** for whatever reason... My point is, we never thought we could do that... And see how well it was implemented in the game! Killers with unique props are something the devs are capable of doing, and I don't doubt once they find a balanced way to implement one they'll surely do it... Right?
---
lol
---
Something from Twitch, idk
---
Add ons

Judging from the wording of his power and the calm addons, treatment mode is being removed in exchange for something like left click swing, right click shock, and ctrl to do the "Static Blast" which is basically an AOE zap attack that hits everyone in his TR, while his passive insanity aura is being removed.
---
EDIT: In terms of wants I just want madness to be more...mindscrewy. I want stuff like Doctor hallucinations pretending to chase and lunge at you, dull totems appearing lit, etc.

Not at all. You can lagswitch in any game, but the way it affects the game is different. 
---
Previously you lag switched and everyone experienced lag. 
---
Now you lag switch and only you experience the lag but other people still see you lagging around. You won't be able to hit anyone, but it's still possible for sure
---

Ghostface is the mask with the costume, a character, and not the person wearing it. You can see that in the movies, as the person who wears the mask changes, but not the costume, or the mask, or the name... It's always Ghostface, regardless of the person carrying the role. It's a stealthy serial killer who kills for fun. I feel like this is something legion would have as a skin, because it's a bunch of teenagers.
---
Like noob3, who got banned once for hacking legacy after losing his data and legacys and never got it back again
---
Why do killers DC when I find it fast? It just takes us 15 seconds less to do the gens and I already spent at least 10 on cleansing it
---
I really hope that we get something really unique for once. Heck, I don't care if this game doesn't have guns, yeet in a killer with one! Proper balancing would be a pain in the ass, yes, but I wouldn't mind trimester-like DLC releases if that'd mean more original killers.
---
no, most actually need a buff.
---
Wow, Lvl 50 Dweet. Lol :)
---
Thanks man appreciate it

I think the map was kinda lame and could have been better thought out in the structures the new characters lore is interesting and they look interesting but their actual perks and gameplay kinda bad
---
Wow she said baby killer fucking classic
---
Your right still sounds the same like someone making the same joke üëçüèª
---
May I ask where are you playing from?
---
Yeah I play legion too. She's got this one cool skill where you rain down a bunch of arrows in an area, and it does more damage the more people it hits. Gives legion a nice speed boost too.

Yeah, I mained huntress when I was starting out as killer so whenever I verse a huntress as a Survivor I'm happy about it because I can apply my knowledge as playing a huntress myself. One match I had a huntress keep respecting the pallet so I was doing a similar thing as you and also at one point I was looping her around a rock while walking because she just wouldn't put the damn hatchet down and basic attack me instead.
---
Billy is free
---
Why are his legs so long

I mentioned breaking shack pallet instead of mind gaming it and got like 30 downvotes lol.

ayrun is not toxic at all LOL, he just plays to have fun and not to ruin the killer's fun like oshito

its because of the tomes, its forcing everyone to burn themselves out
---
That Hatchet is Basically a Heavier Sniper bullet but with less damage
---
I appreciate the reply! Thanks for the explanation. For me whenever I see a nurse in game they are usually gods or potatoes. Which is why I usually have nurse as number 1. Freddy is really difficult with the right load out for sure! But I think I would have him behind spirit personally.

The backflip I made him do was completely by accident and I'm glad it's included in the clip, lol
---
Was playing pig and decided to just oink at survivors (stay crouched and spam ambush at survivors for rapid grunting) and a Meg couldn't find an exit gate while time was running out, so I downed her to slow the timer and carried her to an exit gate, she had literally just gotten out right before EGC popped.
---
That is terrifying
---
Depends on the Killer and the circumstances. I find that if the Killer is a high tier Killer, Survivors are more likely to DC when things go sideways. Similarly, if people get caught and downed barely a minute or two into the game, real solid odds they'll DC.
---
I... I want to address all of this...

Downvote me all you want, but I hate how this community consists of a bunch of nancy‚Äòs (pun not intended). AaronPlaysTV and Ussylis are just really damn good loopers humiliating the Killers with skills + verbally and just because most Killer mains are sensitive and insecure about their abilities and sympathize with the joke of a Killer in their videos. I‚Äòm a Killer main and I‚Äòve never even reacted to ‚Äútoxic‚Äú behavior. I mean what is even toxic behavior? It‚Äòs the abuse of game actions within the game‚Äòs limitations that were established throughout the game‚Äôs life cycle as actions signaling humiliation of the opposing party, examples being teabagging and flashlight clicking. However, people tend to forget that being bad or being humiliated in a GAME means absolutely nothing. The people doing those actions just abuse your own sensitivity and by extension idiocy. Honestly, if you get angered by a game you seriously need to stop playing it, because you definitely have issues you‚Äòre projecting into the game.

If you're still new to the game and trying to learn and don't have any better perks? NOED can be a nice safety net for you while you get your bearings and try to understand the few yet complex systems the game pushes on you as a killer. My only request and suggestion would both be to try and slowly phase it out as you work towards incorporating other (and better) perks into your loadouts.
---
It's a great perk for a new player but once you've gotten a few hours under your belt I do believe it holds you back from reaching your full potential.
---
Good luck and try to have fun in your games, killer can be immensely stressful a lot of the time but it can also be very rewarding when you get some good plays in against a tough team. Happy hunting. &lt;3
---
lesion not legion
---
Of course. Mockery and dismissal. You've practiced this moral high ground taking before, haven't you?
---
Way easier than actually having to put logic, facts, and reason, into a discussion, rather than insults, character arguments, and meek dismissals.
---
Must be nice to be that deluded.
---

I think she‚Äôs still one of the strongest killers but having that lunge and collision gone makes me hate her that much less. I used to b that guy that hated spirit but now I never see her and when I do it‚Äôs mediocre gameplay against her and I‚Äôm just like eh this is alright but not fun, for either of us but mostly her because that patch hurt a LOT of spirit mains on console. I‚Äôve seen her like 4 times since.
---
You can't blame one person for community toxicity.
---
Power through, HOWEVER if you fail a skillcheck, stop working for 5 seconds.  You make no progress for 5 seconds after a good/failed ruin check but you can still get a skillcheck in those seconds which makes it risk for no reward.
---
What is that? #what the fuck is that

Glad it worked well for you.

If the survivors are genrushing *really* hard (I‚Äôm talking like 3/4 gens in 2 minutes) then I will tunnel/camp. They‚Äôre ruining my fun, so I have no problem ruining theirs.

Thankfully this rarely happens, but I‚Äôve gone against super sweat teams all running BNP‚Äôs, Prove Thyself, and other shit to make the game as quick as possible.

yeah cause your notifications were bugging me

Kill or hook?

Yea I mean technically, although there‚Äôs only one post made 220 days ago lol. Wish it were more popular though I think it‚Äôs easy to focus on the negative stuff too often in this game. I tend to forget there are a lot of great fun people who also play.
---
Was your ghost face wearing a white robe by any chance?
---
I didn't know Obama played dbd
---
Hm, I understand the rage they feel... How bad must it be for the killer than? 0o (never played one, tbh)
---
Yep, someone will get unhooked then run into me or heal under the hook, and that‚Äôs my fault.
---
It certainly feels as though quality has been sacrificed for quantity.
---
The skill ranking will never be good simply because there‚Äôs too many cheese tactics and variables. Moris, keys, tunneling/camping, coordinated gen rush, etc. Some people play the game like a party game. Others play it competitive. Usually the two don‚Äôt mix well and that‚Äôs where a lot of the frustration comes up. As for the toxicity, I just ignore the other players. The dumbest things could trigger people. I even bet ten bucks your post will trigger someone, lol.
---
No he was wearing a the one with the red.
---
I run both on Huntress, and it's actually surprisingly good combo because Anna lack of map pressure (and especially on indoor maps).
---
Nah, That person's just a scum, I play ghostface more then anyone and I would never kill a survivor because of anything like that
---
True that! I feel reaaaaally lucky right now.
---
There‚Äôs a difference between doing the objective and going out of your way to rush the game as fast as possible.
---
If they‚Äôre running certain perks/items they can rush the game extremely fast, and in many cases the killer can‚Äôt do anything especially if the killer‚Äôs power has no map pressure.
---
And saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs their objective‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really help your argument because I can argue that killing them is my objective, which I can do by camping/tunneling.
---
Bill: backflips
---
huh.. most ash mains I know are just really loud
---
Oh I agree with you, tunnelling is the killer equivalent, I have no issue with it,
---
I was just making an Office reference, but good job either way! üëç
---
I'm glad that its not a common thing. I dont even understand how people could think like this.
---
You shouldn't have explained it, was about to upvote
---
Ah, in that case it was just a coincidence üòÖ in didn't play past week at all, had no time
---
tbh very very few people are actually toxic when they play, regardless of the role.
---
A lot of people are pretty fucking boring, but that's different
---
Every human should have the same right of being killed mercilessly by me independent of their color
---
Oh look otzdarva fuckbois downvoted me &lt;3
---
I think Susie is underaged lol.
---
Very few my ass
---
Noed doesn‚Äôt need to be active and you pretty much have to open the gate
---
Good mindset to have when playing killer.
---
You basically just ignored what I said......
---
Also let me just say Ghostface is ‚Äújust a bunch of teenagers‚Äù besides number 2. OnÕèe was an old woman and the other guy was in college... but people in college still act like teens.
---
Also on top of that all Scream seasons had a teenage person under the mask... besides that one girl.
---
explain to me?
---
Run bloodwarden and open the gate yourself before you hook someone, forcing the egc to start.
---
Idk what it is but every time I use BPS as a killer I end up playing the most sweaty matches of my life, so I usually don't use them unless it's 2x bloodpoints.
---
As a woman, a gamer, and even a lesbian who dates other women, I think you need a reality check.
---
Either you're spending more time gaming than you think you are/than is healthy for you and your relationships, or the pair of you aren't compatable.
---
Even if she was a gamer, finding a healthy balance is key.
---
And since she isn't, I have a question for you, do you care about her hobbies?
---
Is there a way to counter this? All I can think of is "Hey Bubba, get yo ass back here", and run after them when they try and break chase.
---
Good, tbh. The other platforms still have so many issues and this game would suck on mobile anyway. 
---
Sometimes producers need to engage their brains instead of rushing to the newest shiny lol
---
Pretty sure she was doing dailies or was barely learning the killer. I‚Äôm at the red ranks, but whenever I try out a new killer I‚Äôm an actual potato
---
Oh, shit! Duh.
---
Based
---
Dude it‚Äôs always Nancys that I grab off gens. Or megs. It‚Äôs hilarious.
---
Not a fan of Sloppy Butcher on Legion anymore, just cause Feral Frenzy no longer applies the effect. To which I say, booooo.
---
‚Äúmlc15 is [REDACTED] years old at BeepBoop academy and he doesn‚Äôt fit in. His teachers have given up and his parents are about to as well. The other students point at him. Mock him. Laugh at him. They say his writings make no sense. That they were clearly written too fast and nobody peer reviewed them before they were put to live servers. mlc15 tries to ignore them all but he can‚Äôt. The word count is just so high and he doesn‚Äôt know how to reach it like the other kids. He doesn‚Äôt want to do this. He doesn‚Äôt know *how* to do this. It‚Äôs not his fault he was pulled at random from the art department. It‚Äôs not his fault they picked him. It‚Äôs not his fault...‚Äù

&gt; Demanding nudes from underage girls isn't sexual assault?
---
Not according to the law, no. Of course, it depends on your state's verbiage in the statute, but sexual assault requires an "assault" that is "sexual". Words aren't assault. Demanding nudes, depending on the age, is more along the lines of enticement of a child. 
---
Some states don't even have a statute for "sexual assault". They're written as sexual abuse, sexual misconduct, sodomy, and rape, just to name a few examples.
---
While it's certainly creepy as hell to demand nudes from underage girls, that doesn't constitute sexual assault. Is it still a sex-related offense? Absolutely, but specificity is important, otherwise we just conflate everything.
---
I've heard the allegations about the nudes thing with Ochido, but I would be curious to know the age of the victim. I'm pretty sure Ochido is Spanish, and the age of consent is 16 there if I'm not mistaken. 
---
Regardless, he's still a creep whose absence is not mourned, save for those who dig his ear-rape montages of glitch exploitation and noob bullying.
---
Start by smacking a pallet and letting them stun you. Getting into a chase and stopping mid chase when they're clearly looking at you and then smacking the air in their direction.
---
What platform
---
On Xbox you can msg them in the pregame lobby
---
CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNT!
---
r u serious? is there anything else killers will complain about on this subreddit?
---
just ignore them
---
I mean he is also a cop/detective. Still a scummy thing to do.
---
Was really just giving my homie a final spotlight
---
I haven‚Äôt lived with anyone I was with, but I have sometimes felt like I‚Äôm playing games too much and not giving them enough attention.
---
All my gfs were gamers tho so when I happened to play a lot and they wanted to spend some time with me, they joined me.
---
If they don‚Äôt share your hobby, you have to find the middle ground. Remember that they are the most important (unless they aren‚Äôt, but I assume they are)
---
Yeah, the issue is with the press release, not the journo. No journalist could thoroughly play every game they ever write about, so they rely on press releases to give them accurate information. This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve seen one where the PR guy goes ham with a thesaurus and makes a huge mistake.
---
Kyf is fun
---
True, but I honestly stopped playing Spirit because it feels too easy (at least for me) to play her. Literally just full blast your volume and be a decent enough killer and there you go.
---
U realise your karmas gonna hit negatives soon?
---
lets not with slurs please
---
"Just ignore them" someone doing this bullshit nonstop can literally make it so you can't hear anything other than the sound notification spam.
---
I wonder if the next killer you find all the time after this Rift will be Wraith or Billy?
---
Oof, I got bad info then
---
Ah that‚Äôs understandable. AITH scares me now with the decrease in charges, getting the green add-on that drops the charge count by 8 means the perks essentially cancelled each other out haha.
---
Apex has Wraith! Lol
---
Don't tell me you never get the feeling they are just salt mining and get off on making others feel miserable online.
---
Yes!
---
I demand a d‚Äôartangan skin(and this sweater) for our boi
---
Apologies for apparently being the only idiot here, but what exactly was changed for Flip-Flop? I can't tell the difference.
---
It‚Äôs hentia but real
---
Nothing has changed for us killer mains, we can do all of that while waiting for the game to find us a lobby and it will still be searching for one after we return to check the game
---
Well that was a single player not liking tapp then. Nothing to do with ghostfaces/killers/any other group
---
That was pretty cool but toxic as well
---
Yeah, I have, thanks anyway.
---
But I‚Äôll have to try the database rebuild, and hope for the best :)
---
Dude with the current matchmaking a rank 20 could be matched with Otzdarva, it hasn't happened to me yet but I am hoping and praying
---
I actually prefer playing Feng, but from time to time an invisible Claud is certainly fun.
---
Being the type to run her darker cosmetics though I don't run Iron Will and do try my best to establish from the early portions of the match that I'm not actually a blendette as much just someone liking her bloody cosmetics by trying to get into early chases and making myself seen.
---
It depends on how you use the cosmetics that make it a simple choice or not, me thinks.
---
like u would not rejoice in getting a 4% escape
---
Nancy‚Äôs fucked
---
Not much, man. Seems quite unwinnable.
---
No one wants to play Killer on console.
---
He lost an argument and called you a rat kid. Ok i understand
---
First, legion and lesion. Two different words
---
Second, why the q-tip?
---
That's not the only point I made, dumbass....ppl already hated the Spirit as it is so creating a killer based on her lore is lazy and underwhelming....why add on to the already hated Spirit instead of just giving us something fresh. Idk who the Teacher is but I've been hearing they were gonna add him long time ago but didnt....Something new is what ppl prefered.....and to top it off...they just gave us another gay Yamaoka map only instead they just added rocks everywhere that just gets you stuck.
---
Don't worry, I saw the same meme 
---
Too accurate
---
This
---
Eboy face
---
Hey it‚Äôs cool man. If this is how they wanna play the game, then let them be pathetic. I wanted to bring up an important issue being how easy it is to pair up with a killer friend and exploit unknowing survivors. Three games in a row, I got the same cheaters. Makes me wonder how many times I was cheated and didn‚Äôt notice. This was the first time I noticed and that‚Äôs mostly because their usernames identified one another.
---
good god this is embarrassing for you
---
So annoying that people have to blame every single fucking thing when they lose
---
Techincally freddy, As he is the only with slowdown addons, though plague is better at than
---
Let's be real, everyone's killer tier list is gonna be different because each person sorts the killers by how they perform as them and how they see others perform as them. Just look at Truetalent, he put Wraith 4th on his tier list because of how well he's done as him using the way he performs as him and the way he's seen others perform as him with his similar playstyle. I almost put Spirit above Freddy but in the end I decided that I wanted Freddy at the top on my tier list because of how well I've performed as him ever since his rework.
---
Traps aren't gey Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ° ‚Äì
---
Haha I love doing this. Got unhooked once and killer came right back. Got some distance then teabagged and jumped into a locker. Killer wacked it for a few seconds then walked off. Best mindgame you can do.
---
Sorry If I made it seem like I was accusing all ghost face players. I just thought it was odd that someone would do this.
---
I saved the video clip, because I was shocked to have found him so easily post phase. I never play Spirit, If I do I can't really "try hard" causs 1. Idc to &amp; 2. She isn't leveled up at all. This is the 2nd time i had a salty person blame their death on me bc of "hacking". Gotta laugh sometimes.
---
why u talkin shit bro
---
Why even post this? You did nothing special nor did anything interesting happen
---
If you generalize the whole community as "the worst" they're definitely not gonna be nice in a post saying that.
---
Ina survivor main and I'm embarrassed reading that. Take your Ls like adults ppl. Losing is part of the game. It wouldn't be a game if you won all the time.
---
I‚Äôm the complete opposite. Idk why. Survivor takes 5 mins while killer is instant for me. I play ps4 but idk how that matters
---
What did you do out of interest ?
---
This worked, just laid down 5 traps in a straight line, went afk for like 3 minutes, came back to 4 survivors spinning in circles and every trap already activated. Farmed some more with them and let them escape.
---
The fuck do you want the killer to do, stand in a corner until all the gens are done?
---
That's what I always try to tell these people, before I'd be mean back but I'm like "what for?" It's just a game. &amp; when I said It was "luck" he was like "luck? Yeah sure" like okkkkkk.
---
Not sure if that website is serious or not, because it's still available on the playstore.
---
under shitpost for a reason buddy
---
you killed a survivor?
---
fucking banned mate
---
Toxic behaviour over luck, downvoted.
---
Okay buddy.
---
I‚Äôd rather see feed spelled out or eat
---
Correction; The pin that lets you put survivors into broken is better now, the rest of legion's addons are still boring and pretty useless.
---
He might have also not had a reason for it and came up with basically anything after you asked to maybe offend someone, in which case, you‚Äôve taken the bait
---
Maybe Obama is a survivor main? Nobody knows what he has been up to since he stopped being President
---
Dead By Daylight came out in 2016. Obama‚Äôs last year as President was 2016. 
---
Coincidence? I think not
---
k.
---
I wish there was a way on Xbox to not report but give feedback somewhere you know that it will get to bhvr. I‚Äôm sure I have 30+ unknown bugs to dbd but I‚Äôm not going to go through my clips now and send each one to the dbd team and expect them to fix them all at once because honestly they‚Äôll probably just make more bugs in the process.
---
Just a little box after game or in menu to write down things us console users see that people on windows store or steam don‚Äôt see because honestly they have so much more support for the game than we do so most of the things we say they assume we blow out of proportion or isn‚Äôt as bad as we say it is, but it is. 
---
Its just an opinion but I wish more people agreed on this because I‚Äôve wasted like 20 charge add-ons this week forgetting that they didn‚Äôt fix it or even acknowledge it- that‚Äôs more of a personal rant I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs even fixed on pc I just want my charges and batteries back :(
---
You‚Äôre legit making by your words ‚Äúthe worst community‚Äù even worse by your responsive comments

okay you are completely braindead. no surprise here.

i wish you luck on your future prospects. you're gonna need it

It really sucks that shit like this is so commonplace everywhere.

And here I thought I was getting blocked :)
---
Have an upvote
---
Ruin, Thanatophobia, BBQ and Pop in my opinion
---
How do you feel about corrupt and Ruin? i always find that corrupt just makes people search for totems, making ruin useless
---
More like when I play r6 I call lesion, legion and I want to off myself.
---
Latest patch re-added hook hits!
---
bruh we don't even have an option to turn of vsync
---
behaviour doesn't care about us lol
---
I successfully did this yesterday and got a two paragraph long message about being a tunneler who needed traps to win.
---
Like XD Trapper using his trap! How dare he!
---
What's with this "Trap is a slur" thing I've been seeing recently? I've never heard of any controversy about real life trans people being called a trap
---
You also have a nice holidays :)
---
Thanks.
---
I am so disgusted with some people in this community. Like have some level of competitive respect. Its fucking gross seeing stuff like this.
---
Yeah had it a few weeks ago, too. Got an infinite sprint burst üòÖ was a bit laggy though
---
I mean it's only one post on this 2-3 year old subreddit, nothing to worry about.
---
Please I was scratching my nose
---
I main killer, so no lol.
---
survivor rules dictate you must give the last player hatch
---
He can scoop ice cream but he can't scoop himself off the hook. God speed, Steve mains.
---
As A killer I see as a easy win, especially when the last two suriviors are hiding until the other one dies.
---
I like it because in most my games I can hold them off gens for the duration  of corrupt and by the time they realize I have ruin I already got a hook or 2 and helps slowdown midgame better. But this has been at green/purple ranks since I just started getting back into dbd more.
---
Op didn't give them hatch
---
More often than you could possibly know, bub.
---
Please don‚Äôt remind me
---
Just played against legion who somehow stabbed me through the window even though I was well out reach.
---
Eve saw your post and made sure it got onto my feed:
---
https://i.imgur.com/kKRtznl.jpg
---
Lmao I always let scoops Steve live because I remember the dark Ash days
---
As a killer I hate when someone leaves someone to die on the hook. Sometimes I kill the other person and bring their ass over to the hook to unhook the other Survivor.
---
Disappointed
---
I really like my corrupt/ruin combo but Im gonna try this out later.
---
This is a continuation to a prev post I had posted.
---
Nah he's hated sex since he was 6
---
I actually have had some really nice exchanges with killers and survivors on this game. I would definetely say as a whole survivors are worse, but even they can be alright. :)
---
:)
---
I'm not a Plague main tho but I play her sometimes and this build usually works. Corrupt Intervention is also very good so if you like it, keep using it.
---
More like Leg-Ion-Face
---
*posts something publicly*
---
‚ÄúYou wasn‚Äôt asked to comment!‚Äù
---
I dont see anywhere on ingame news that says 28th
---
I would say NOED, maybe, but in certain cases.
---
Cute as always! Keep them coming! &lt;3
---
With me its ruin, don't think it's unfair at all don't get me wrong, more my teammates behaviour when it's active gets on my nerves, if you count the sprinkles of salt I have in each match it adds up haha
---
I think you mean 18th...
---
Edit: yup the 18th.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/103996/developer-update-november-2019
---
You have to scroll down a bit to when they first added the archives, it says the tome level release dates.
---
You mean asmongold?
---
yeah but i understand the frustration with that one
---
Its not that deep bro. Cool your beans
---
Oh yeah, thanks
---
I actually never use it because I refuse to give survivors an easy excuse as to why I won a match when I do. It's just really annoying seeing others get shamed for using it because maybe they're a new player or just not very good at killer and want a chance at getting some points. I guess I'm really just arguing semantics here, the objective is to kill survivors regardless of the emblem system and it is very effective at helping accomplish that objective.
---
say what u want but if u consider a survivor that is getting face camped and escapes with a tbag or 2 toxic then I fear what u think about  clicking a flashlight
---
can I have your great grandma
---
I LOVE IT!!!!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
---
This dude's mentally unstable or something. He's been posting suicide notes and rants here for a couple weeks now.
---
Hahaha I was playing, hope she lives to be a hundred and beyond, healthily too.
---
No one deserves the hatch. You earn the hatch.
---
All of the survivors do at some point during the animation lol
---
Omg!! So sweet
---
yeah id rather just fight through it instead of running round doing nothing
---
So you say this is the worst community, yet you‚Äôre a part of this community? Whatever floats your boat, man
---
You arent cool. You are forgiving. The people thinking that this makes you cool, it does not. It makes you seem like a nice person. Personally, I do this more often than i can count. But as a killer, i do grow tired of it, so some times, its just fun to murder everyone instead. But then you get these pain in your ass survivors who demand the hatch. My point is, this meme is almost like a page from the Survivor rule book for Killers
---
FUCK OFFF I HATE YOU
---
No one Escapes Death, dying light, A nurse‚Äôs calling, and remember me 
---
I‚Äôm sorry I had to
---
Awwww

That's why I half walked up the ramp, I was pre-walking in case it was there before I looked there.

I hope so too. She didnt think shed make it past 80 and shell be 90 in january :)

Shes the community's grandma now. All of you guys can have her
---
That‚Äôs it billy can now throw his weapon!
---
Lmaoooo
---
OH YEAH
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs just a logo
---
Same I find killer games easily
---
Tbh people leave because of certain killer behaviors. I‚Äôm Not supporting people who leave but don‚Äôt want people to leave your games? Then don‚Äôt camp and tunnel and stuff. Avoid the super cheap killer strategies if you want to decrease the chance of people leaving
---
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
why do i hear a heartbeat
---
A flashlight is useful item for survivors to help protect other survivors.
---
A tbag is a way for you to intentionally be a dick, its not celebratory, its insulting. Kind of like your bold ass claim you got facecamped yet cleared more field then long distance runner.
---
Listen man, I don't think it reflects on you that you did a douche move, everyone does. But defending it makes you look pretty bad.
---
Commit to a chase so everybody can get on with their life instead of hitting someone once with your dyling light thanat pop build and running straight back to your triangle. Chasing is much more fun, and I'm good enough to win using chase perks instead of perks that make one game last 45 minutes. It seems you are not.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if it doesn‚Äôt happen much if it‚Äôs still a possibility like dear god I could use this same argument for any small annoying things killer had that survivors bitched about
---
just because he is in the top 3 doesn't mean he has to be nerfed. and to say that he is "for noobs" or an easy win is  false. He chainsaw doesn't help him in most loops or jungle gyms, and can be dodged by experienced survivors. you have to aim his chainsaw and guess which way the survivor will run, and take nearby line of sight blockers into consideration while also making sure there are no vault spots nearby. your suggested "rework" would make him alot more tedious and unfun to play.
---
Who is downvoting the kind comments about Granny?  Get a life.  
---
Anyway - she‚Äôs adorable.  Def makes me wish they‚Äôd put in an older lady character to kick some Killer butt.
---
At least everyone that doesn't leave gets to keep their offerings/items/addons
---
You should see the r6 community
---
Welcome to the game
---
NOED and it's not even a contest
---
No i mean the game never actually gets played cause someone leaves- happened 2 times in a row. i shocked i waited 30 mins plus to even bother trying to play- havent tried killer since and i miss my trapper
---
Its an annoying reality much like facecamping is. Both sides have their own cheesy bullshit. I feel you though, if you are a sound oriented killer it fucks things up.
---
It totally works, but by that logic most perks do. I'd argue it brings nothing special to Legion and is no better or worse than it would be on any other killer.
---
I love her. Who is her favourite character?
---
Laurie looks finely aged. We can pretend its from 2018 Halloween and not the original
---
Yes ‚Äúmolly‚Äù
---
Remember to excessively bully the claudette who taps on your gen. Point at them endlessly for the duration of the match.
---
I'm involved in r6.  They aren't as bad as this game
---
Deerstalker, Coulrophobia, Cruel Limits and Devour Hope.
---
We don‚Äôt speak of them
---
Presidents, or us presidents? In any case, doesn‚Äôt make it any more okay lmao
---
Jane (my main) because she looks like me! I love her so much üò≠
---
I think aside from that one perk that let's you see recovery progress, forgot its name, both of Ash's perks are in a fine place. Flip Flop works great in anti slug builds especially if another person on your team has breakout. MoM is frustrating to play against but after they changed how protection hits work it feels genuinely fun to use, once again in combination with Breakout.
---
Damn, your lucky. In my experience it's been way worse.
---
Omg üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
---
What about us who play both?
---
Same... but they allways wiggle
---
 There is so many things right with this clip

fixed it for u pal

It's specifically a good kind of fat. Phat is a compliment. Fat is the harsh truth.

enjoy it

Legion Pin might not make you use the power in a different way, but at least it isn‚Äôt an addon that just increases a stat by 20%
---
I love your content so very much. &lt;3

Fat isn‚Äôt always a bad thing ;)
---
in the basement i definitely pick up items accidentally a lot, more common than you‚Äôd think
---
That's why it's *phat*. ;*
---
Well he‚Äôs disagreeing with you, and you‚Äôre ignoring what he said. 
---
Ghostface‚Äôs identity under the mask doesn‚Äôt matter as much as the mask and costume itself. 
---
Just because Ghostface can be anyone under the mask, doesn‚Äôt mean that the mask and costume can change to be anything while still retaining the identity of Ghostface
---
This concept art is very in line with the theme of legion. Where the theme is very much of young (teen) killers, who differentiate themselves (necessarily, due to their being merged) through their senses of style.
---
plz explain mate
---
Sorry but Ronin&gt;everyone else
---
Only reason why movies don‚Äôt really change much is 1. Original Design works so stick with it 2. The original design is what pretty much brings up any ptsd Sydney Presscot has.
---
You wait for killer games? I literally wait 5 seconds top, usually just instantly load into a lobby when I play killer. Survivor queues are insane for me, however.
---
This happened to be one time. I think it was in the basement as well, I was mad cause i was like "wtf i don't want this" &amp; I felt bad i didn't want the guy on hook thinking i was fucking around lol.
---
This is high IQ
---
same

TFW broken window infinite is actually blocked
---
Trap is a term **exclusive** to feminine males in female clothing and has nothing to do with transexuals.
---
With 10 and above, do you mean 1-10 or 10-20
---
I expected a "Change my perk" hehe, but yeah, I agree
---
Hate the downvotes you're getting, tf guys? My boi here was lucky, sure, but they're happy due to the luck, gtfo with your "they teabagged and that ToXiC!!!!! &gt;:(" because most of you guys HAVE teabagged, because pretty much EVERYONE teabags because it is a way to express yourself, they were happy so they teabagged a camping wraith. Calm down guys.
---
which tier list was this based off of by any chance?
---
Not me, I'm in the US :(
---
I've played with and against most of the other popular streamers though.

It‚Äôs slang that used to be used in the 70-80‚Äôs I believe to pretty much make fat a positive word. Mostly used by rappers an such they‚Äôd say like ‚Äúyo that chick is phat‚Äù. It‚Äôs like the old timer word for ‚Äúthicc‚Äù ig.
---
Trap isn't a slur for trans people.
---
Dont get me wrong hes still amazing, just not op anymore
---
Killers ques took forever up until like 14-15 ish rank. Then around 10-12 the ques were instant for me
---
that would require me to have a reputation to start with
---
oh shut up
---
I have ASH, but use none of his perks.
---
Franklin's Demise.
---
I play all these games too but my copy of r6s no longer works :'(
---
I feel like that as well. I had a 2 months break and ended up back around brown ranks around GFs release. Hour long queue times and ez games I don‚Äôt pip for.
---
I even considered quitting the game.
---
But then I started streaming. I was known in some streaming communities before so I had a few viewers from the very start. Playing killer 4 hours a day and having Peggle Nights open for the queues. I also tried my best not to crush people to make sure I rank up asap
---
I usually couldn‚Äôt sit through the queue, but streaming made me commit. Over time my rank increased and queues decreased. Now, redrank killer queues take ~5 seconds
---
PC-Was doing the complete 3 gens in one trial challenge, actually completed 4 in game.  When went to claim it was finished but I couldn‚Äôt, upon relog it was completed but didn‚Äôt get rewards.  Suspect it triggered as completed, but check upon claim looks at = not &gt;=
---
a part of me says this is the biggest troll ever another part says who cares I think it was funny my friends thought it was funny so I am happy lol the wraith never said anything about my tbag he was just salty over the 4%
---
Now I‚Äôm debating wether or not I should leave survivors to die when playing solo que
---
Leatherface walks in, everyone?
---
I always take note of who is toxic or not in my killer games. If you were the only one not toxic you get to go free.
---
1-10. Higher ranks have more survivors and less killers, meaning killers get matches faster
---
I'm just mad because everyone is getting all shitty over this, good on you for not caring tho
---
Damn she looks like a straight killer main lol
---
When you call a bronze player a rank 20 and realise your talking about the wrong game
---
I genuinely believe that this is the last time legion will be touched. They have the best m1 game IN the game (yeah, not actually a good thing but the Devs don't care). I still find FF amazingly fun but too many arseholes that just dabble a little and don't actually learn the killers power (aka the Devs, case and point Hag allegedly didn't get buffed til a dev got steamrolled in a livestream), which means they don't understand its flaws (you get a bunch of free hits and some nice information that doesn't actually help against good survivors on half-decent maps. Or, honestly, nearly every map even with bad rng for survivors). 
---
TLDR: legion probably won't be getting touched again. The Devs don't care that good survivors trump good killers in a 'traditional' chase in a 4v1 game, and legions power fits right into that formula.

---
That tbag wasn't necessary
---
I know :D
---
Okay see more to the story, I mean that‚Äôs very entitled of him I just knew there had to be more, not that his actions are justified especially if it‚Äôs only a few seconds and he died. 
---
But if you did that and he had to wait the full bleed out timer that‚Äôs a different story lol. That‚Äôs why I wasn‚Äôt sure who was more wrong in this case.
---
Franklins
---
Wdym gen rushing what else are the survivors supposed to do
---
They should add safe unhooks counting as well, if that causes mom to be activated too frequently than just make it require more tokens/stacks to activate. 
---
Hell they could bring the old way back and just make it harder to earn. Ex. More hits required or hits that put you in dying state don‚Äôt count. 
---
Im not sure why BHVR is hellbent on making it require 3 stacks when they could just make it require more stacks.
---
And thats why I don't put on ruin unless there is sweats.
---
Imagine being him seeing a cameraman
---
Hmmmm im gonna teach her how to play hag lol
---
I hope she doesn‚Äôt play against a hag, i damn near get a heart attack when i initially trigger a trap and im young lol.
---
This visual glitch has been posted a bunch already.
---
it uses the ps4 cover despite the fact that didn't come out until a year or so after the game
---
A full meal of friend chicken, rice, and gravy.

Is she better than the shape?

Want a scalp massage?

This is where the fun begins.
---
Shoulda heard her scream at scratch mirror myers
---
Original meme pls
---
(Kyf ofc)
---
Give her the most toxic build and tell her that crouching upland down is respectful
---
So unless a killer plays how you want them to play you DC? Sounds reasonable ü§°
---
He looks like a Rainbow Six Siege dropout
---
I‚Äôm actually so grateful for ruin because it‚Äôs taught me how to hit great skill checks when there isn‚Äôt ruin too. It‚Äôs at the point where I don‚Äôt usually bother looking anymore because I can do it. 
---
However because I‚Äôm on PS4, if the match is a laggy one or one where my FPS is dropping, I will look for ruin because the skill checks are a LOT harder to hit when the FPS goes to shit.
---
Bruh I gotta get rid of them somehow smh
---
Same deal on pc. Im playing a lot more killer because of it
---
DON'T BULLY THE POOR BABY
---
You can play with people on Steam **if** they have crossplay enabled in their settings, but I‚Äôm not so sure about the friends part. I‚Äôd suggest just using Steam to purchase it if possible for you.
---
... I was about to agree with OP before this, plus more often than not in my experience if someone died on first hook it's due to the killer camping more than survivors just leaving them hanging.
---
I would love playing dbd with these graphical settings
---
LMFAO
---
HAHAHAHAHHA!
---
Can't, got game pass free with my GPU so dbd is free.

It's extra leaked lore

How on earth did you pull that out? I literally listed one specific scenario that I DC in and stay in everything else. Do you know how to read?
---
E x a c t l y. T A R G E T T H E W E A K
---
It isn't his gameplay mate. He's in spectate with some Nancy that got the bug
---
you obviously have literally 0 idea what you are talking about. so why would i continue?
---
Dont be so agressive when answering back, he can report you and get you banned in psn
---
He's very clearly spectating.
---
Definitely looks suspect.
---
Their user name is at the bottom of the screen, did you report them?
---
I don‚Äôt experience much lobby dodging and this is a kinda scummy thing when done intentionally. Just ready the fuck up and make it faster, stop playing those worthless games
---
Most killers aren‚Äôt even looking at the lobby and those who were and saw you do this shit will pull the plug in the loadig screen
---
Great tip. I do this as well when I want to bring a flashlight especially
---
It‚Äôs a bug
---
LOLLLLLL i told her it means hello
---
If this doesn‚Äôt work, try checking my profile as I couldn‚Äôt get it done like this, still upvoted for the help :)
---
My content and a half, damn
---
Damn didn‚Äôt see that... well I am slightly blind that‚Äôs my excuse lol.
---
I 100% agree. None of his perks have him or his puppet busting out a chainsaw and taking down the killer. It‚Äôs unacceptable that BHVR would rip off Ashe and give us this pale shadow of the man that‚Äôs a god amongst all men. Does he even have a shop at S-Mart voice line or one where he coughs while muttering random shit? I feel we need to boycott this game until we get a chainsaw perk and a distracting cough that opens a portal for Ashe and throws him across the map.
---
Toxic survivors = spicy food
---
Dude next time take a screen shot haha
---
Can hardly make it out.
---
*is that adrenaline and D Strike??
---
And then get absolutely slaughtered because I got carried there.
---
Haha
---
The bug happens when an exhaustion perk breaks. Do you see an exhaustion perk?
---
Ok, thanks.  But i don't think i was aggresive at all. I've said worse before to people but I just don't bother half the time. I didn't think he was seriously upset until he said my luck was "hacking" lol. Oh well.
---
Survivors already do this to me
---
... why?
---
Nope
---
Oof mate. Guess we all make mistakes occasionally
---
Yeah ik it was being SUPER laggy but there survivor perks it was a bug
---
100% agree
---
It would be awesome to get a Halloween Laurie skin from the most recent flick.
---
But actually you only get 3000 BP and 3 Rift Fragments.
---
#MONARCH GANG RISE UP
---
I mean you said it‚Äôs quite a common strategy nowadays for killers and said you DC whenever the killer plays that way. Is that not what you said?
---
I've thought about it, just haven't gone thru with it.
---
It only recently just got changed to add its best feature so that‚Äôs probably why
---
It's awful, didnt you read. "Once at least one exit gate is opened, you gain the following effects"
---
They are scared of powercreep and want to make the game less ridiculous. Imagine if killer power was balanced around old old BNPs (press space to complete the entire gen instantly)
---
Not when an exhaustion perk breaks. I experience the bug occasionally even without exhaustion perks. It's basically chance it triggers
---
"Loser" and "fucken" are keywords for the auto mod on psn. 
---
Got banned 2 times for that shit already. one more ban and im gone, stay safe.
---
I did yes but that‚Äôs still not a horrible downside
---
Its only active during the collapse so it is very situational and you would just be better off to bring something else, botany knowledge would be similar, but would work the whole game.
---
Man don‚Äôt rank up I swear. The game gets more and more frustrating. Always the same builds and pallet looping forever.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve thought about it once or twice but there isn‚Äôt really a way to do it without fucking over your team mates.
---
I don't really know how to nicely say get good, but y'know, get good. I've gotten to rank 8 just fine because I learn from my really tough matches. Watch some higher ranks streamers or YouTubers play. I noticed also, though I am a killer main, watching videos on survivers playing helps me learn to counter their play styles.
---
Because it can only be used if the exit gates are powered. People are more likely to bring something that will help them throughout the trial.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt feel good about it but you know when you get tired of the game you have to shelf it for a couple of months or so lol.
---
I should've been banned already then, didn't know haha. Thanks for the heads up. :)
---
..this is transphobia?
---
Man sometimes I forget about botany
---
If you're Trapper and the obsession steps in a trap whilst chasing them it counts as letting them escape
---
I actually only play solo survivor, as I don‚Äôt have any friends on PS4. Occasionally I will play Killer if the grind starts to feel monotonous. I think you, and a good portion of the fanbase, are taking this game too seriously. That‚Äôs BHVRs fault for making this game appear to be competitive when in fact it should be cooperative. There probably should be two matchmaking types so that everyone who wants to feel like TrU3Ta1ent can worry about how many 360s they hit in a game and complain about servers and their team.
---
Yeah, but shape is pretty terrible. Plague would be okay if they would fix the bugs/emblem system but in general her power relies on survivors for its full effects and there's really no reason to cleanse. Let's be honest, if everyone on a team could select No Mither and the killer wouldn't get their power, every good team would.
---
Imagine teabagging someone who clearly hasnt played much. Its not like you played well, you could have got curved twice if you were against someone whos actually played before
---
That‚Äôs cool. I‚Äôll start running it on himS
---
What you said
---
Not european so there‚Äôs little hope for me :(
---
That would be pointless. If you just buff everything equally to be so "overpowered", then in the end you've changed absolutely nothing.
---
The bug I‚Äôve seen is getting a haste effect form either BL, SB or Adrenaline and never losing it. I‚Äôve never seen a player randomly getting a speed boost like this for nothing and I don‚Äôt think getting hit counts cuz it‚Äôs not a status effect
---
It would be fine if there was a killer power that let you instantly down all survivors if all are injured if unbreakable was standard
---
Yeah! I‚Äôm not tired of the game, just tired of seeing the same meta perks/killers and play style. In lower ranks it‚Äôs a glorious shit show of people getting a feel for it and I think that‚Äôs more fun sometimes.
---
That is what I said. Then you tried to make it sound like I DC every time the killer does anything lol. I swear I don't know why I bother with this sub. It's been infested with little rank 10 killer mains who have never played survivor in their lives...
---
I admit, sometimes I take it out on the next games survivors for a toxic SWF from the game before. I'm sorry, I'm weak...
---
I already have reported it, made this post so people could do their own testing, figure out if the issue is as I've stated, and report what they find.
---
You run those loops way too wide. If the killer was good you would get destroyed.
---
Also you only use apostrophes to show posession. So it's "baby billys" not "baby billy's".
---
Not sure what platform you're on, but lobby dodging has been a major issue for every survivor player *especially* on console. I admit its scummy, but it's just as bad as dodging every lobby because survivors bring items, meanwhile these same killers have no problem bringing their best addons and a mori and expecting survivors to just suck it up and play anyways.
---
Survivors aren't given the luxury of dodging lobbies they don't like or think isn't fun, so why should killers? Killers aren't more entitled to fun than survivors. So since killers wanna be scummy and throw survivors back into endless queues, I'm encouraging survivors to be scummy right back and force killers to play against stuff they don't like just like we have to.
---
I don‚Äôt like when people do it because they say ‚Äúnah I‚Äôd rather get good points than actually have fun by having a challenge and play fair‚Äù. No I keep my rank as high as possible
---
I deliberately stay rank 15 and below for killer tbh
---
She will become an icon of the community soon. Tell her I said hello and to have fun &lt;3
---
That helped üòÇüòÇ
---
As someone who comes across toxic swf this brings a tear to my eye. Downvote away.
---
Good to hear, I‚Äôll keep my eye out for it next mid-chapter.

Honestly thinking about it üòÇ

Powerless vs Too Powerful? I think I‚Äôd rather be op

You all made me reach the top trending post in the r/deadbydaylight I'm crying. Thanks for making me this a great day. Due to some of your comments, I'll make one funnier and better. I don't think I'll get these upvotes ever again, but hope some of you see it ad like it. Again thanks also to my first follower lmao.
---
I understand where you are coming from and yea, people should be reporting these things but I just felt like it wouldn‚Äôt even put a dent on the problem at large and I just wanted to be done with it and address the main issue instead.
---
Yeah I see that. I get bored of the same perk builds and killers sometimes that‚Äôs all. It would get boring having bad killers non stop after while!
---
*Please god, tell me this gave you some ideas*
---
There are interviews with people who were once friends with OchiDo and they said he was pretty agressive.
---
Ardetha made one.
---
For him being a horror icon, he really got shafted when it came to his perks. Mans defeated Jason AND Freddy
---
100% disagree, I think mettle is the best but the problem with mettle is that protection hits are the most bullcrap thing other than hitboxes.
---
Damn this is awesome !
---
I can vibe with that.  
---
although if you bring a key and try doing this I expect them to just dc LMAO
---
Lol holy shit
---
I think they should bring the flick back, but make it 60 degrees instead of 90. What he has now is pitiful, what he had then was too good, 60 can be a happy medium
---
no bc I am not a asshole
---
I've never purposefully deranked, but I have purposefully not double pipped or safety pipped because I don't want to go to a much higher rank.
---
Good luck, I tried that with the trapper , had everyone down and swatted at the traps repeatedly all set up in the killer shack, they just kept running away....I kept bringing them back (3 of them) and they eventually let one die and the two others grabbed hatch with 2 gens left. I asked them why they didn't trap and they said I had to earn it.
---
It's hype people get this worked up over something so stupid. He did a little movement in a fucking game. Good job for getting your panties in a twist over something y'all have probably done in your video game career. Grow up.
---
Oh yeah no doubt I just wasn‚Äôt sure if it was just me seeing things. Now it kinda makes sense that‚Äôs what it was because the whole match he didn‚Äôt do anything but run around like a crack head. 
---
When I was playing it didn‚Äôt look like they were going fast or anything unusual until I spectated which was weird. That‚Äôs when I noticed killer couldn‚Äôt get him.
---
I also play all of these
---
you get good

Cause they are trash
---
Oh yea, consoles.
---
On pc once the killer leaves, you wait a few seconds in a killerless lobby and a new one comes in after like 15 seconds so it‚Äôs not a big problem at all
---
And people stopped doing that
---
You wouldn‚Äôt be overpowered the Standard would change so stuff we think would be op now would just become average
---
Yeah! I try to stay around purple but tbh I have more fun at green. There‚Äôs just not much of a way to de-rank as survivor without fucking your team over.
---
Missed opportunity
---
thanks friendo
---
Thank you &gt;u&lt;!!
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I‚Äôm dead serious. 
---
The more you progress the less the game is ¬´¬†scary¬†¬ª. Survivors just don‚Äôt give a fuck about being chased because they all run the same brain dead builds and they know the map by heart. So you‚Äôll find yourself just running around as generators pop up everywhere 9/10 games.
---
Kinda ironic how they complain about survivors who dc at the offering screen when there's a hidden one, but then they'll turn around and dc when someone sneaks in a key lol
---
Fuck, I just completed this with a farming killer. Then he dced cos he wanted to derank
---
I'm kidding
---
Im a survivor main
---
Maybe it's your rank I just had the same issue I'm only rank 8 but it took like 5 minutes.
---
Thank you for your sacrifice battling through all the shit you don‚Äôt like. Happy holidays

Survivor: *teabags in exit gate with Bloodwarden
---
Spirit: SUBARASHI
---
Eh only toxic if u let it get to u. it is usually why I don't consider tbagging or flashlight clicking toxic bc it is merely means to get the killer annoyed and follow u
---
I didnt? I posted it in the facebook community at the end of march, but if its already in here, that means somebody stole it üòí
---
It‚Äôs just a joke
---
*as nothing more likely
---
I mean, what if flip flop is the best, but hook frequencies are just bullcrap and so is getting picked up immediately? With actual regularity and effect of the perks in context, flip-flop does more for a team or player than mettle of man. Regardless, as far as individual perks are concerned, flip-flop fills a niche in a relatively balanced way, whereas mettle of man does not.
---
Not even powered, gates have to be OPEN.
---
I love ghost face mains
---
Fuck this is wholesome as fuck
---
Shes the loml
---
"hot"
---
We all know this but we still keep playing it... guess we are hooked
---
Can we get Titanfall Legion as a killer? His ability can be Aggressive Sustained Counter-Fire
---
Killer, you are outnumbered 4 to 1. Recommend aggressive sustained stabby fire.
---
Same tbh, he looks kinda derpy and I'm proud of him
---
I get that, mine is the same to me also
---
Lockers have hatchets in them. Pallets can be broken and you can pick up the broken bits. Trees have limbs you can use as clubs. Ashe would also beat the shit out of most of the killers. He'd smack the shit outta Legion and take that knife for example. Don't underestimate the will of the chosen one you mere mortal. And if the Necronomicon can't strip Ashe of his gear, the bitch ass entity wouldn't be able to either.
---
True!
---
Thank you :)
---
Yeah, I've found that the current penalty is negligible enough that those who camp within it don't know about or don't care with a fair amount of those who will just camp right outside it which is still close enough for total shutdown. And the kindred is really nice for no mic scenarios to help the survivor's not get snowballed when playing normally against a killer who is playing a way the dev's have tried to limit.
---
OMG OwO Thank you! I love your comics &gt;.&lt;
---
This fan-art looks amazin.
---
You're welcome, good luck.
---
Funny. I think I've met them too.  I blocked them because I don't plan on playing with them anytime soon.
---
Well devs weren‚Äôt clear then but I‚Äôm pretty sure they mean when a real life problem pops up.
---
I‚Äôve only seen Freddy and piggy
---
Shirtless David, perks don't matter.
---
There is definitely a lot of cheese. Some things that I feel could be measured, for survivor at least, would be the ability to hit great skill checks consistently and how well you do in evading the killer during chases. Those to me feel like something that are major factors of being high ranked.
---
You got a point. It's like Overwatch in how some just want to goof off and practice while others just want to try their best to win. A Casual and Ranked mode would help it, although I don't think the population is big enough for such a split. Either side could be very empty while the other thrives. It's a difficult situation to say the least.
---
And well, you pretty much won the bet xD But I'll take what you said to heart, I appreciate you and some of the others' patience with me.
---
With 9000 shards you can permanently buy some killers. I just got Oni for example this way. Others like demogorgan I used Auric cells as it was cheaper than buying the character directly.
---
Yeah absolutely. I don‚Äôt blame killers AT ALL for using the meta perks, I totally understand why, if you don‚Äôt, you just experience exactly what you said. It just gets a bit samey samey in my own opinion but yeah, don‚Äôt blame killers at all. Just wish there were some other perks that were just as viable as the usual meta ones.
---
Freddy pig and Myers.There are shards for doc,hag and leatherman but those don't appear in the blood web anymore
---
It‚Äôs probably just the logo of his Rugby team.
---
He‚Äôs got a point
---
Oh yeah absolutely. I like to fantasise about a time in the future where dev time isn‚Äôt solely dedicated just to new chapters and fixing bugs.
---
&gt; "He just left me... guess I'm too good"
---
I always pretend survivor says this when I double back for the mindfuck hits.
---
Buckle Up, is what you were thinking of- and yeah, it really ain‚Äôt good.
---
Wait until they find out somebody is controlling the Myers.
---
Said it once, say it again, why does spirit have a tiny bulge
---
I dont like the Look of bloody Cosmetics in general, neither the Survivor nor the Killer ones. 
---
Also found out here that Prestige does basicly nothing for better items, so theres legit no reason for me to Prestige anything
---
Not that type of shard he means the ones in the bloodweb.
---
You mean splinters?
---
Neither do I, because I just did this for a joke
---
Every 100 levels in the game you get 25.3k shards, a killer other than (Demogorgon, Pig, Myers, Ghostface, Freddy, Leatherface) costs 9000 to own that character.
---
Level 40 Nea???
---
I like the chest perks for ace and Quentin, I also like Quentin‚Äôs exhaustion perk it just needs a little higher numbers.
---
Deranked as in afk or DC till my rank is low ? No. What I do do however is if I want to stay within a certain rank is I hook everyone once for my barbecue stacks and then just kind of go easy on them and slug them all until they complete all the generators and leave it usually give me a black pip. It's  helped me complete the archive challenges because God knows I wouldn't be able to finish most of these if I was ranked five and below.
---
29, almost 30
---
It‚Äôs to niche
---
No, every other fandom doesn't do that. Strained JoJo references are in nearly every single thread here. They outweigh all other fandom references put together. There's no other fandom that's anywhere near that level of pushy unless you count Jehovah's Witnesses going door-to-door.
---
Look at this thread ‚Äî three different people all made the same "Giorno's theme is piano" reference. Zero people made references like that to any other series, despite the fact that most shows' soundtracks feature the piano.
---
I am happy to let them enjoy what they enjoy, I'm just asking them to stop pushing their fandom on me by clogging up unrelated threads for no good reason, and maybe watch another show so that they understand the piano is actually a *very common instrument*.
---
You get like no blood points

Crosspost this to our Boys in the r/StabbyGang please.

That‚Äôs a good idea!

Yeah I should have included I didn‚Äôt mean de-tank like DCing or AFKing, just doing enough to not pip. As a survivor there isn‚Äôt much of a way to do it without messing everyone else‚Äôs game up.
---
If you play Ash while the killer is playing Freddy I want to hear Freddy mumble something in fear.

Happens to me to me aswell

You are the definition of arrogance. If you can‚Äôt participate to a debate respectfully then grow a pair.

More like pie
---
Same experience with wraith on pc.
---
By Perks: Meg, Bill, Claudette, Nancy, and maybe David
---
If you exclude their default perks, then Ace is the best survivor because he's the most quiet. Tapp is also pretty quiet. 
---
Nea and Feng are chosen a lot because they have small statures and can hide better.
---
That doesn't mean anything. It's about playtime and rank. You're obviously very new. Don't bully baby killers, it's not cool.

I sucked so hard but it was funny as hell so I guess we all win.
---
A 16% gen repair reduction is not "small," especially if ruin is up.
---
Fuck oh shit oh
---
So far ibe gotten myers, freddy,leatherface and the pig on the splinters

ION LIFE!

The worst part is when you do too good as a killer and the game takes your pips away. I can see not letting someone rank up when survivors play that fucking bad, but there‚Äôs 0 reason you should de-rank.
---
For real Obama is following!?üòØ
---
Tf kinda sick person do you have to be to put this?
---
Even worse is when you‚Äôre playing Killer specifically for the Adept achievement/trophy and then they DC. To add insult to injury, you now need more than just sacrificing all four survivors to earn it; you need to get at least two gold emblems and two iridescent emblems. But, the silver lining is that it‚Äôs much more satisfying when the acievement/trophy does pop. Ex: my proudest trophy is Adept Plague. It‚Äôs also the most difficult one so far. By the time I popped it, I had already sacrificed all four in three or four different matches.

I would laugh so hard if she only played with stridor and no other perks
---
What you could do for survivor depending on your skills and luck is try getting the killers attention and try to run him as long as you can. I'm not too sure how the game judges a pip , black pip or depip survivor side. I think if you do at least one gen and run the killer as long as you can and at the end let him kill you you should black pip.
---
He says as hes holding a key.
---
I wish we could fit stridor in there too
---
I just saw myself in the future
---
would look great till your eyes melt
---
You know I did think about this. I have some good chase perks, I could run a chase build and just try that because at least I‚Äôm being of use to my team mates!
---
yes i want to marry jake thanks
---
Almost like there would be more viable killers at higher ranks if survivors stopped crying and instead learned to deal with new things
---
Nurse would be dumpstered if she came out today.

Frenzy, with its increased speed, guarantees a free 1-2 injures upon activation and with the broken pin add on they can severely cripple a team for 60 seconds. With the extra running speed, you pretty much force the survivors to drop the pallet since you‚Äôre too fast for them to fake a drop and run the loop once more, this also makes the iridescent button better. Sure, you become mostly an M1 killer when everyone‚Äôs injured, besides optional information gathering, but that‚Äôs not bad when there‚Äôs no pallets left halfway through the game. The extra vault speed is also great for never getting window/pallet teched again and can catch up to survivors easier. New Legion IS better. It‚Äôs the best I‚Äôve ever seen him.
---
I wish I was a streamer because I did what Otz did and played 16 games of Legion at red ranks and got 14 4ks and 1 3k and 1 2k to show his viability.

&gt;karma hoaring someones sick grandma  
---
Gotta love this community
---
Sweet repost.
---
As a red tank survivor, dont you dare bring that trash into my trial. Slippery meat is better
---
Your grandma has good taste!
---
Well for others competition is fun.

Baby Dweet wouldnget along well with Amanda fr

Still praying for a single blue eye mask and blue hoodie for my boi
---
What about a masked journalist who stalsk you and then teabags you to assert dominance?
---
I‚Äôd argue Laurie over Nancy
---
At least we have the most fun power to use
---
Finally, I am not alone haha!
---
Maybe this is a woosh moment but I'm pretty sure this guy is just actually that gigantic...
---
Jake looks the dirtiest out of all the survivors
---
ah yes bc apparently u must put urself in the shoes of the wraith when u didnt even see the end game chat or the pre game ah yes that isn't being entitled and insert yourself into situations they dont have any idea about. 
---
or attention u got
---
Give him a little bell that jingles when he walks
---
She looks a bit too enthusiastic..
---
tbh those perks dont really exists I cant come to think of any at least but I might be over thinking this
---
Except imagine 2 trappers.
---
Or imagine going against a clown and a legion. Oof.
---
oof and almost the same caption as well. while the picture is wholesome, I guess he just wanted to easy farm karma by reposting it almost exactly the same?
---
As a toxic survivor, I 100% agree with this. It takes days to move down just a few ranks. I want nothing more than to slide down into baby ranks
---
Better yet, p*rn is when two people who really, really like each other have a wrestling match
---
I would be, both survivor and killers get everything back and it‚Äôs all based on skill then
---
You drive a hard bargain there Patrick
---
Dunning  Kruger is insanely common in survivors
---
*Let's survivor escape*

MERCILESS KILLER
