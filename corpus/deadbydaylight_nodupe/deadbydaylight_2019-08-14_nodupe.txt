I think this bug is a case of we don't know or it would have been fixed. I think several things can cause it not just one thing.
---

---
I remember in some patch notes or dev article they said they added tracking for the issue to help find causes and resolve them so I don't think they even know all the causes.
---
As for abuse it you can't really if gates are open endgame has started and you have 2 minutes to explore then die by then entity.
---
---
---
... what in the deep corners of hell?
---
Adept plague; it’s the only one I haven’t gotten and it’s annoying..
---
And camping isn’t a good strategy and will make you lose if your not facing potato survivors and how in anyway does this invalidate my point yes Leather Face is one of the worst killers in the game
---
[removed]
---
You’re playingg spirit. Loops dont exist after you get a hit, any other killer fair enough complain but when a killers power completely negates looping and has 0 counterplay other then luck theres really no reason to complain
---
F
---
Dude i know im a no life for it but i read ALL the lore your killers are a tad off tbh im not hatin and if you want ill explain them all lol
---
I've seen a game do this before... ohh wait it was this one...
---
Mandatory... pretty good job so far
---
You need more water team, got a little too much salt in your diet lately.
---
The same amount of players on both sides are whiny, you cannot say survivors ALL bitch about something then count yourself in the majority for killers who are okay with other nerfs.  
---
DS is so assholes don't tunnel so much, and people use it to their advantage, same as killers who need NOED is a crutch for new/bad killers.  Every good perk can be abused, but GTFO with your crazy last post.
---
Honestly, even as someone that almost always runs Spine Chill when I play survivor I've gotta say that I agree. If a perk completely breaks a bunch of killers' only power then something is wrong with it.
---
Then don't play until they fix more maps. Take a break.
---
There should only be crossplay between consoles
---
It's just a little vomit.
---
Yea that one. I won't dear to touch that one without any friends
---
Long answer: definitely. Hell yea. 
---
Short answer: yup
---
I hate using plague in general it’s no fun
---
Yeah but F13 fucking sucked on release. Was a glitcher shithole then DbD has ever been, an a cess pool for trolls and team killers.
---
Have your opinions, but understand they are not facts an I do not agree with them.
---
Yeah :c
---
Yeah no shit sweaty swf time
---
no not really all I care about is getting my 4 BBQ stacks I don't really care if all 4 escape
---
How you get the survivors faces?
---
[deleted]
---
Yea I don't even get why it even exist in the game as a achievement like wtf
---
As a killer main honestly I think current DS is in a good place... on occasion in endgame it has cost me a kill but win some lose some.
---
It’s never really gonna happen naturally which is why it’s annoying
---
What is the joke?
---
Kinda sad but i do the same lol, almost every game has people dcing or the game goes down to 2 people and there's 1 person trying and the other just hiding in a locker. In both of those cases, or if a survivor played particularly well and survived to be the last person, i give em the hatch at the end.
---
New meta survivors' perks are totally fine unless they are like MoM - giving reward for making mistakes and being 0 counter crutch perk if used correctly.
---
That’s a funny / friendly-salty post-game msg idea
---
Same I don't really care if I don't get a 4k all I care about is getting my BBQ stacks for some extra bloodpoints
---
Honestly I was in red ranks and got reset to 11 or so and bc I'm a solo player (someone with no friends lmao) I hate to play with the higher rank survivors that run around half the game without touching a gen, injured or hooked person.  If they wanna improve the system make it so that every two days you dont play you depip (not a whole rank, just a pip).
---
The title makes it sound like this is an ironic joke, but it actually is real lol
---
Ah, yeah true. When I play Hag, I'm usually using Trap Speed/Trap Duration, because I like to use them mid-chase and stop myself from being looped. I'm usually not doing a lot of in-direct chasing personally, I'm just littering an area with Traps and running people into them for free hits.
---
But if you take away one **super** obviously broken perk, then what'll we use!?
---
Besides Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, Borrowed Time, Iron Will, Bond, Decisive Strike, Lithe, Spine Chill, We'll Make It, and Dead Hard, that is.
---
What if they’re so strong you can only get one stack?!
---
Laughs in doctor...
---
Thanks for the chuckle. I bet the killer did a bit of cursing.
---
Balance changes: buffs to bubba (worst killer) and wraith (my favorite but kinda lackluster without addons)
---
What i want in the game: Probably too much to ask for right now but in the future more gamemodes and more iconic survivors/killers.
---
one of these things is not like the other
---
360s arent reliable, should only be used if you have no pallets or windows near you to use, and even then its only a slight chance you'll make the kille rmiss
---
I don't get this mentality. So you just play a slasher game to get points? You think the point of the game is to get points and not kill them? You're fine with people just doing whatever they want and trolling you? Why even play a slasher game then? 
---
This mentality is so bizarre to me. If you just care about points then go play Pacman or Tetris or something. Get that high score, dude.
---
Spine chill gives the survivor a 40 meter warning to a killer coming to them, if they stealthily escape before the killer arrives that means they probably have a good location for their generator or they have other perks to help them escape.  Either way they escaped because they used their time wisely or they used a perk they have correctly
---
Worst shrine ever
---
What is the purpose of rank reset? I still haven’t found out yet
---
Depends on if there are other games too on the switch that you’d want to play.
---
I’m on board with buffs to Bubba.
---
Also a 2v8 mode would be amazing, I want to be able to kill WITH my friends damn it!
---
I really think that one perk in the shrine every week should be limited to perks that are over a certain usage percentage, so that we aren’t subjected to incidents like this where we get a month of total garbage.
---
everyone has rough games, dont let it get you down.
---
Wow this shrine is garbage. A Wraith perk (Free killer with like no good perks), Claudette perk (Free survivor and not even a good perk), Legion perk that isn't Discordance, and the only one I could see being semi-decent is Detective's Hunch, but even then there are far better perks.
---
&gt;1.) Hitboxes Redone
---
How would you re-do it? 
---
Personally I don't think they are that bad for the most part. The funky aspect of hitboxes happen when you interact with something like a pallet drop or vaulting, which involves some processing and hitbox transfer / deformation during that animation.
---
Balance changes
---
1: SLOW. THE. FUCKING. GAME. FUCKING. DOWN. By any means that this is achieved. Slow down the gens. Slow down the gates. Secondary objectives. Whatever. Just slow the fucking game down. 
---
2: either balance around SWF or nerf the absolute best survivor perks. 
---
Two things I want:
---
Robert Englund Freddy and he fucking talks.
---
Pinhead.
---
Cutting Out.
---
It is soo rare for the killer to not get to a hook. And getting 3 people to body block is actually impossible with randoms. I am one wiggle away from it, and I rarely play survivor...
---
I heard of dbd alpha but i heard bad things
---
Well... at least huntress mains get a decent perk.
---
I don't play killer to win I play killer for bloodpoints
---
Good point
---
Go play Civ 5, right?
---
I generally don’t mind dcs on either side. I’m confident in my team and myself so it doesn’t matter much if a survivor dcs. It’s only when I KNOW that a survivor/killer dcs because of salt that I get annoyed.
---
100%
---
look for the dbd discord server and there are always plenty of peeps to talk and play with. SWF, KYF, or killers just hanging out
---
☝️ Whats up with all these fake accounts with troll comments recently? My block list is getting bigger each thread.
---
And why do you get bloodpoints? Is it to level up survivor characters? To level up your other killers? So you're playing killer so you can get points to level up killers and that alone is fun?
---
You know what's really cheap?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Generators only taking under two minutes (about one minute and fifty-three seconds) of collective effort from the survivor team to repair all five. **Under two minutes**. Less if they're running toolboxes or resilience or spine chill, particularly since they can use spine chill to immerse and hide the moment you glance in their direction.
---
This makes the match take longer, but not in a way that benefits the Killer (since an immersed survivor with 36 meters of warning is going to be difficult to find, so you're still not getting in chases and wasting time looking within 36 meters just lets the other survivors keep on repairing).
---
NOED is a perfectly viable perk given the state of balance on the survivor objectives, and the developers are reworking where pallets spawn so that all/more loops can be mindgamed instead of just "Press W and win" on stuff like Haddonfield/Ormond/Fractured Cowshed/Groaning Storehouse/Grain Silos, this is why Badham has been getting ongoing reworks.
---
It only takes twenty seconds to open an exit gate, if all the survivors are gathered at one exit gate and you manage to get three slugged, that's on them. Smart survivors will split up and the rest immerse so that if you get one, the other can open it and escape when you inevitably have to pick up the first.
---
And if they wait, you won't get any, since they can open one while you check (or camp) the other. Also unlike Adrenaline (**which is ridiculously easy to pop, because of the aforementioned generator speed**) NOED actually has a counter that slows the game down (doing totems), totem spawn cells can be memorized - not their exact location, but the general area in which they spawn, even the Badham rework didn't change this.
---
NOED is far more fair than any mid-tier Killer getting gen-rushed and not having an endgame.
---
Your connection is cleary bad, dedicated servers will fix this problem if the killer's connection is the problem. Hitboxes are not the problem.
---
What perks would you nerf, what would you do to them and why?
---
Iridescent shards whatever.
---
Yeah that’s fair, does ds work with it?
---
Nope. It doesn't.
---
This is the only game I lag in though, I was playing rainbow for like an hour and my ping was less than 20 the entire time.
---
when you can't loop, he's OP as fuck. i remember my time as a baby dwight. i hated him so, but my rank 1 friend at least helped me understand why i was bad against him
---
What the fuck is this why is there Carl
---
I’d make them closer the actual size of the survivor while doing anything but dropping pallets/vaulting windows.
---
When dropping pallets or vaulting windows the hitboxes would be the same as they are now as to not give the survivors a massive advantage.
---
But if I juke a killer and he can’t aim and it hits me anyway in a chase, that’s where I think the problem lies.
---
God, all of the 2nd chance/get away for free perks. You know the ones; DS, Unbreakable, Borrowed Time, Sprint Burst, etc. I would just give them a downside. Slower action speed, can't pick up or use items, etc. I wouldn't take them away but give them some kind of risk/reward which would only be fair.
---
Fully corrupted survivor who tries to hide in a locker with quick and quiet. Like comon man the locker is literally dripped in puke.
---
yeah it is fun
---
Nurse is one of the easiest to beat. I’d say Hag, ghost woman and Legion are the hardest. Billy is probably the easiest. Freddy is terrible as well.
---
That's what you should be doing.
---
As a survivor main who doesn’t care about my killer side I can’t say I do. It sucks sure but I usually say respect. It’s literally only because I’m a survivor main though. 
---
But to be fair NO ONE likes a steam roll, survivor or Killer side. And I usually feel bad when I find my SWF just outright stomping someone who honestly just couldn’t do anything or catch up. I’ll frequently offer up a free kill in the end too, especially if I already know I’ve got at least a safety pip and decent points. Sometimes it’s a killer who’s never played a character and just doing a daily, or trying a new character they aren’t used to yet.
---
Thanks, I know someone is going to complain, but i feel bad for the guy on the hook. Sometimes you join solo and the other three are an overly altruistic SWF. You dont really have a choice.
---
But at the same time i know i cannot please everyone. And I guess it isnt my fault that people are swarming the hook. I really dont like camping. But i guess there is a line between that and punishing overly aggressive people.
---
Ahhh that’s the worst, what about boil over or whatever it’s called the Laurie struggle perk
---
I have every adept achiv so imo:
---
- Billy was the hardest one to me
---
- I was scared about nurse one but i got it in my second game with her
---
not everyone levels the base characters
---
We have yet to see a killer that uses a Staff. Or a sea swallow like in Chrono Cross
---
"I only got borrowed so that your dumbass doesnt get downed within 10 seconds of me shamelessy faming you" 😂
---
To be fair, Hag is one of the ones that is insanely hard to counter if you want to ever get a save, especially in the basement.
---
Survivors move at a genuine crawl (just over one meter per second) when crouching past her traps, you put three down along the stairs (or if on an outside hook, three in both directions of approach) and in front of the hook? Survivors are never gonna get out, because by the time you get the unhook notification, you can be back inside the shack (from 40-50 meters away) before they get out of the shack.
---
They don't get a Borrowed Time proc, they can't sprint or walk without getting teleported to, it's almost the same thing as Wraith facecamping.
---
See Wraith takes 3 seconds to uncloak by default, and a survivor crouching takes about 11-12 seconds to move the same distance they would in 3 seconds while running, and Hag can move 44 meters in 10 seconds.
---
So both examples, Wraith cloaked and Hag trap-spamming, catch the survivors within three seconds (twelve meters) of the hook; sure Hag might be sitting 44 meters away, but she still performs identically to the Wraith facecamping, except she can also patrol any generators and hunt other survivors within 44 meters at the same time as she's "camping" the hook.
---
This is why Hag tilts me, personally.
---
Not me, unless it does but I don’t hear it lol
---
Without rank reset experienced players would just stop playing, every game is spirit or nurse as survivor. Every game is filled with god tier survivors as killer. Rank reset is bad for new players but it is 100% needed.
---
Just power the gates and start egc with no hatch if 2 gens aren't done
---
I do agree the game is bit too fast when you play against good survivors, but they’ve done a lot of work in this regard already by nerfing gen speed repair, nerfing self care and healing in general, the ability to kick gens, and hex ruin of course. 
---
Also you have to remember most of the people that play this game aren’t very good, so it’s honestly more rare to find a good team that will actually crush gens super fast.
---
Nurse is easy if you can make good predictions early. Billy I found easy too but I’m a billy main so that’s mostly why
---
Wth why did I get downvoted so hard lol I didn’t even say anything wrong Jesus
---
Not usually. Most of the time I laugh at how poorly I did and try to analyze where I fucked up.
---
Although I will admit to the occasional "sure wish I could *fucking* get teams like this when I play survivor" under my breath in the middle of the chase, though.
---
Thats what mori's are for.
---
Survivor makes it to a safe pallet, drops it, misses the stun, then slow vaults back over to the side I was on into my arms. I yoinked him slapped him on a hook then shook my head in disappointment before breaking the pallet and moving on.
---
Also any survivor who trap themselves in the preschool playground fence. Easiest downs in the whole game for me. I just patrol the side making them vault until the entitiy closes the vault. For some reason a lot of survivors get stuck there.
---
It's Kate who has Boil Over. I'm guessing it works, because your wiggle bar fills up fully. Still, it barely works either. Flip Flop would honestly be my best hope, but, I don't own either of them, and I certainly don't want to buy Ash, spend 600k bp, just to maybe get an achievement.
---
^^welcome ^^to **^^HELL**
---
Each person working on the gen gets a 10% bonus, no one person gets more then a 10% bonus.
---
So if 3 people are on the gen, each of them gets 10% separately.
---
Oh boy...
---
Legit just had a game vs ghostface where he tunneled the first kill, but saw the Nia going for the save immediately after hook, so he lingered.  Gave me time to finish the gen and open the exit, but he got the Nia.
---
It happens, and sucks when you're on the hook and some idiot teammate comes in full speed before I'm even on the hook, but I at least understand where the killer is coming from.
---
[Don't take it from me, take it from someone with around 6-7k hours in the game.](https://clips.twitch.tv/VastTentativeLapwingFloof)
---
Several videos of him playing with Nurse's base kit on YouTube as well if you're interested in seeing him live up to what he says.
---
I wish I had a clip with Spirit, but he will say something along the lines of her having very little counterplay when it comes to looping because it's just a guessing game. And prayer beads being straight up unfair.
---
And I personally agree with both.
---
And now imagine that you are chased not by legion but a Freddy haha
---
To make you uninstall the game and play Civ 5 instead.
---
Now look from the other side: Killer facing his 10th *full swf squad with 4 toolboxes* in a row prepared to genrush the living shit out of him.
---
If you're spending real money I'd always suggest the licenced ones because you can always get killers like spirit or clown using your shards. Myers is definitely one of the most fun killers for me to play as and his rarer add ons make for a better experience
---
I counter shitty players by being super annoying to them. Say I'm on first hook and someone jumps in a locker or is hiding right next to me and it's safe to unhook but they just do nothing. Well ok, I get that you would rather do nothing, no gens, just hide and watch or whatever but I then just make it my mission to show you how shitty team mates and make this game terrible. I get not wanting to get seen or hit or whatever; maybe they are bad or doing a daily but if you're doing nothing then why play? Your money, your game. My money, your fucked.
---
I literally had a killer camp and tunnel everyone. What was his excuse.... That the last game he had was toxic so he decied to take it out on us.... Thanks asshole.
---
Far as i can tell, prestige does almost nothing. It gives you a cosmetic and slightly better blood webs(which can be worse because of how random they are). Honestly i’m considering not even prestiging because it doesn’t have enough benefits.
---
I entirely disagree, but not in a snarky 'classic killer main' way (i play both sides though i do use more killer).
---
Ok, I lied, I agree with you a little bit; I do not beleive NOED is entirely broken, after all its no more broken than D-strike and Adrenaline combos (before the D-strike nerf I mean cause lets be honest it sucks something major now as a perk imo), but, a little TLC to dial it back wouldn't be too crazy.
---
What I dont like is your idea, mainly cause that's just unrelenting but with extra steps albeit beefier.
---
I think NOED should retain it's OHKO status, after all its no different than some other killer perks out there that act under specific circumstances with the same punishment.
---
To list a few :
---
-Iron Maiden
---
-Make Your Choice
---
-Haunted Grounds
---
-Devour Hope
---
-Rancor
---
I beleive a better alternative would be thus:
---
No One Escapes Death
---
As long as there is an unused, uncleansed totem on the map, when the exit gates are powered all survivors suffer the exposed status effect for 20/25/30 seconds until downed, if there are any additional unused, uncleaned totems left in the map the entity consolidates there power to increase the time bu 5/10/15 seconds to a maximum of 45/60/90 extra seconds. Cleanseing the hex totem will immediatly cancel the effect 
---
I know its a long one but here me out.
---
This nerfs the power without making it useless AND it promotes the act of keeping an eye out for totems (wich is extra bloodpoints anyway!).
---
I believe there is 7 totems per map unless i missed something (I might've I'm not omnicient). So with NOED taking up one that's 6 eligible totems that can be used for bonus time (Granted you dont take extra hex perks as any active hex totems dont count for bonus time). Now i also figured with quick math at at max rank 30 + 90 seconds for a total of 120 seconds of NOED is more than generous as is but you only get that bonus if the survivors cleans 0 totems this takes a little of NOEDS power and makes it entirely dependant on what the survivors do or don't do. 
---
At max rank 30 seconds is plenty to nab one person unless the killer is a bit inept and that should be alright as the other perks have about the same time on them as well.
---
Any extra time after that is on the survivors for not cleansing totems.
---
AND DON'T SAY Y'ALL CAN'T FIND THEM EVEN ONLY DOING A FEW WOULD BE A MAJOR HELP TO THE TEAM IN A ASYMMETRICAL COOP SURVIVAL GAME AND Y'ALL A DAMNED LIE IF YOU TRY AND ACT LIKE YOU DONT SEE AT LEAST 2 UNLIT TOTEMS A MATCH.
---
Anyway, I've gone on long enough, It's open for discussion I'll answer as soon as I can, I deleted my first comment cause it was a little rude and snarky, I came up with this after eating some burritos.
---
You've convinced me that nurse is extremely strong, even more so than I previously thought. However i still do not believe she is completely overpowered. I think I have come to an understanding of why she is so strong. The first is her ability to borderline negate windows and pallets and the second is the poor map design in the game. Most killers are at great disadvantage when at loops where direct eyesight can be made on the killer at all times. Making the loop to some extent unmindgameable, but nurse benefits directly from this very thing which hurts pretty much every other killer. This leads me to believe that the way to solve what is an issue for many killers other than nurse, are to change these loops where you have eyesight on the killer at all times. This would not only make nurse less strong but would also grant vast amounts of viability into many other killers. Perhaps now I begin to see why many say map design in this game is so important aside from just things like infinites.
---
I would like to say that I do not think Adrenaline = NOED and is why I made this.
---
I like shoving pans up my ass too
---
Only reason I would prestige Claudette is because people say on p3 you're basically a ninja
---
Do you plan on prestiging all the way to tier 3 or stay at 1? If you want P3 then get to it first and then level other characters.
---
You husband now
---
Well teachables can kinda clog up your bloodweb with stuff you wouldn't want but if we're talking strong teachables then yes definitely get them all before prestiging as you can get really lucky and get a strong build at low levels.
---
Yeah I dropped down from Rank 5 as Killer to Rank 12. Went in as my P3 Doctor for a daily and got merciless victory with 0 gens done.
---
Everyone liked that
---
Unlock important teachables leave the bad ones in the blood web so your web doesn’t get filled with trash perks
---
Hey also grab We're Gonna Live Forever from David King as long as you play nice it's a free 100 percent bonus to all catagories
---
D I S G U S T I N G
---
Nurse and Huntress definitely harder. All other killers should be fine though. I would expect the slow turning may be contributed to the FPS issues, which if they are releasing on the Switch then that would hopefully improve.
---
You mentioned playing on PC then you should have an idea on the amount of survivors that do not even bother looking behind them, even at rank 1. Those aren't even controller users either lol.
---
I haven't personally played DBD with a controller but watched several streamers who have. I've even heard the opposite for survivor in that it is even easier to 360 on controller than with a mouse and keyboard.
---
We will have to agree to disagree because I just do not see it being a huge game breaking balance issue for a game like DBD in its current state.
---
Double idiot
---
I do this every single time.
---
Ptgw? I haven't played in a while
---
Oop pansexual means I’d even date Freddy pre-work
---
Too good to use
---
That’s more saying those people are *skilled* enough to be a ninja. The actual cosmetic just adds blood stains to the clothing and fact/hair.
---
That’s a little bit op? No?
---
I would consider this a very beneficial discussion. Thank you to all who helped me understand your points of view.
---
Hahahaha what? I like to check back on threads what once guilded or interacted with.
---
Made an account to save posts many years ago, and have only recently begun to ‘actively’ use reddit.
---
Not sure how sticking to the same reddit, means a fake account, but again, go off my friend.
---
I've got full-on high-level protanomaly (orange, red, yellow, and duller colors, meaning not only is hard to see red, it also blends and blurs into **EVERYTHING**) and also mild Deuteranomaly (not a lot, but some) and scratchmarks are a *fucking nightmare*.
---
I need to be able to *choose* their color. Straight up, no excuses; they're already highly visible neon signs to everyone else without color blindness, who find them impossible to lose.
---
In my case even when I can see them (like on the concrete inside Ormond) they still blur, they seem to twist in weird directions that no survivor could be (because I'd be seeing them running), they appear in front of me as if the survivor is invisible and doing circles right in front of my face.
---
Even when I see them, it can still be difficult to ascertain direction, since I'll only see part of them, the rest will fade out or into the environment, or I'll see two separate patches and have no idea where the survivor went. Following them along part of the way and then completely losing them, or seeing them running in the distance without any scratchmarks between us (at a distance that they couldn't have stopped running).
---
It makes me nauseated just attempting to track, I really hate it, I want to have fun - but I need to pick the color I see.
---
Wazzzzzzzaaaaaaaaaaaaaaap
---
No no no. They aren't saying that being P3 makes you a ninja, they are saying being P3 shows that you are a ninja.
---
PGTW(Pop Goes The Weasel) not PTGW(Pop The Goes Weasel).
---
I was really thinking of getting Spirit but now that you said that Spirit can be bought with shards, it makes the choice harder. I might think between Myers, The Pig, and Huntress since I love her lullaby
---
Wrong. Bubba's scared
---
Just sussed it, hahaha that’s brilliant
---
Legion gets points better while somehow managing to be a worse killer.

What about that guy who was posted about awhile back?

He was selling Steam accounts with Dead by Daylight with legacy cosmetics hacked and the accounts were already banned, his own accounts he used to play with had been banned two or three times for hacking.
---
And he was still using alts to play.
---
Would you be toxic to that guy? Facecamp him, tunnel him, Mori him? 'cause I would. I would hit him on the hook over and over and troll the fuck out of him, because he's a cheater and a scammer.
---
I don’t have legion atm but I didn’t know he gets better blood points. Thanks for the info
---
But him tortured. Spirit is someone who wasn't suppose to be a killer but she really wanted to get back at her father so the Entity made the promise so she's probably higher

My best ones are always taking a survivor to a hatch.. that happens to be right next to a hook. I always stay in the middle looking at the hatch.. then look at the hook and the survivor always starts struggling instantly lmfao

I’m not inboxing you, these comments are public? 
---
It’s how reddit works unless you turn off ‘send replies to my inbox’. 
---
Weird to think that you don’t get how reddit works considering you’re claiming to be an expert in it.
---
 Its way better Pop goes the weasel tbh
---
Haha! It was awesome!
---
1. I was chasing someone when the gates were done, but I was right by one gate when I downed the first person. I made my way to the other gate when I hooked the first survivor, then I ran into someone on the way there, and a third person trying to get the gate open. 
---
2. They didn't leave because they took forever to get the gates open. To be honest, They definitely could have gotten a gate open, but no one really tried when they found out I had NOED, and the one person who did got caught. (Also, gates take 20 seconds to open, and the gates weren't that far from each other)
---
3. Have you heard of perks to prevent gen progress? There's quite a few of them. There's the infamous Ruin, Discordance, Overcharge, Pop goes the Weasel, etc. They are all there to help prevent gen progress. And let's take a look at some perks that fall into the category of giving a survivor a second chance:
---
Adrenaline: A perk that rewards survivors for doing their one and only objective, doing the generators (Which brings me back to gen prevention/slow-down perks: run one of them, they really help with slowing the game down, thus meaning gens won't be done in five minutes)
---
Borrowed Time: A perk that gives a second chance ONLY if within the killer's terror radius (Meaning that if the killer still comes straight back after someone is unhooked, and the unhooked person was outside of your terror radius, they are pretty much fucked. A few killers can even counter Borrowed time completely, as they can suppress their terror radius)
---
Deliverance: Deliverance won't activate unless you safely unhook someone, which means if you hook someone first who had deliverance, or are a tunneler/camper and down someone who just got unhooked, Deliverance won't activate. 
---
Unbreakable: Unbreakable is only useful if, and only if, you slug someone and give them the chance to use the perk. This goes for all anti-slugging perks, really, slug as little as possible, and you have a very small chance of dealing with them. 
---
I will say that i was at brown rank, however i'm not a good killer whatsoever, and rarely play killer at all. Even when I play killers that I feel i'm okay at, I get one or two kills max. 
---
What do you mean my phrasing is bad and that you assume all four survivors were alive? What did you think "The gens got done with no kills" meant? Anyone could tell that means that all the gens were done, and I didn't get a single kill that match at that point in time. 
---
Since when did I claim what side I mained? I only said I wanted to practice with Legion. I AM a survivor main, however I am bad at killer as stated earlier, so I tend to play Killer rarely. This may sound weird to you, but I think spirit is perfectly fine. And I don't even have an opinion on Nurse, since I have never run into a good one as i'm on console. I also have no objection to making gen work slower or more complex as to make gens go faster, and therefore make no need for all killers except Nurse or Billy to run Ruin. I have never heard anyone suggest a secondary objective, but what the hell would the secondary objective be? DS and BT are balanced perks that I actually don't understand how you can think need nerfs in any way, DS is more of an anti-tunnel perk that guarantees a survivor a minute of protection, and borrowed time, just leave the hooked survivor alone unless other people are nearby, and you won't have to deal with it. 
---
From the way your acting, I don't even think you read what my suggestion for a change for NOED could be. It's kinda funny reading your thing about how your sick of survivors bitching about NOED, yet your bitching about meta perks that have no problem, like Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike.
---
I think you misunderstood my comment, I’m just saying people shouldn’t get so triggered over certain shit
---
Nice

Facecamp

I third this.

Is the huntress not a free dlc? I'm not too sure the situation on pc but the lullaby chapter containing her and David king is free for console users. It takes 9000 shards to buy each survivor or killer with the shards so if you're willing to be patient in order to get a licensed killer now that's totally up to you.
---
Inbox as in private message. You can quit now. 👋
---
I had hatch spawn right next to hook that I was on and I had deliverance 😂
---
Killer loadouts tend to be similar when 1/20 perks in the game are actually useful
---
I totally get this too!
---
On a similar note, I always see We're Gonna Live Forever as a man standing over a brain.
---
Shit post
---
It's fine. I actually kinda like your idea, it's sort of like an endgame Haunted grounds, and it would go really well with Thrill of the Hunt. I actually didn't read your previous comment, I was busy reading and replying to someone named NOEDisfineSTFU who was ranting about how I lied about my story and how I was wrong.
---
Get used to it, ruin is required to play killer
---
It'd make more sense if you actually had 'placements' and would skip ahead ranks but instead you still have to grind through every single rank... So fucking stupid. Look at other games and you see pros losing in low ranks sometimes which is why you don't just get knocked down to the bottom every time. So why does DBD make you, especially in a game that relies so much on your team?
---
HAVING THE LEFT FOR DEAD FORSAKEN ACHIEVEMENT WITH EGC ACTIVE IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE LOVE OF CLAM STRIPS SOMEONE FIX THAT I EITHER NEED A COMPLETELY TERRIBLE KILLER AND SURVIVOR TEAM OR THE LUCK OF EVERY DEITY EVERY BELIEVED IN TO GET THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES FOR IT
---
Smiles again when he sees an insta heal on it
---
Y'all act like people don't derank on purpose already or something. If someone wants to derank it should be their choice. Maybe make it so you have to use AC to derank. It's boring for me and not fun for the survivors when I get reset. At least I enjoy playing against people around my skill level. Playing against a bunch of potatoes is boring and makes grinding out back to red ranks harder than it needs to be when they all quit like bitches and I get de-pipped because of them. Quit rage quitting and y'all won't have to see me for a whole ass month......... Just sayin.
---
Definitely getting Botany so I don’t have to waste 35 levels on Claud, very convenient shrine because I was just about to start leveling her.
---
60 seconds is long for tunneling, I agree with that. 
---
I think it is in an ok place now. 
---
If I were to suggest changes, I would reduce max time to 30/40/50 seconds.
---
If you mean NOED tiers, the tier differences are 3%/4%/5%. I see your point though, it can definitely change to something like 1%/2%/3%
---
Garbage shrine . 
---
Only thing i got in it was botany knowledge to get 150 000 BP since i already have it
---
I don’t think it’s a bad idea... but these drops are too drastic, with less drops
---
In rank or more rewards it could be better
---
Eh.
---
When "the objective" doesn't even two minutes (80 seconds per survivor on the first four generators, and then 28.57 to 33.33 seconds on the fifth generator depending on whether it is three or four sided) collectively from the entire survivor team.
---
And you place a Killer with low map pressure that has to spend 30-40 seconds patrolling all seven generators before finding someone (particularly against immersed survivors) and proceed to chase them through Balanced Landing (or Lithe), Decisive Strike, Adrenaline (not hard to pop Adrenaline given generator times), Borrowed Time (definitely going to proc in the EGC at least, if you even caught someone then) and/or Dead Hard.  
---
Through all the pallets, the vaults you get blinded on, and the truly ridiculously no-pallets-required double-window building loops.
---
Oh yes, the Killer almost always has to rush, the game is a rush, the generators are repaired in a rush without even trying. Just hold M1 while someone else gets chased through pallet town and you'll have three done before the first hook.
---
Just because generators are the objective and they are mechanical extremely simple and *very very fast* compared to the killer objective doesn't mean "gen rushing" isn't a thing from the killer perspective, because "rushed due to generator repair speed" is exactly what they experience every single game.
---
And may I ask you why you retch at the awesome cosplay?

Again, you might want to work out how reddit's inbox system works. The replies are going to the "comment replies". [I'm not actually messaging you](https://imgur.com/a/lUS4bUe).

I heard this comment.
---
What is with baby Dwight (im new here)
---
Bloodhound isn't that bad, but bad shrine overall
---
Pop is meta for less than a month and we're seeing complaints.
---
For my teammates a couple minutes ago, that meant letting me die on first hook when none of us had been hooked yet, the killer was nowhere around me, and there was one generator left.
---
Could be runes in the shape of a person.
---
I have a friend right. This guy trash talks to all the killers that destroy him. He's done this for a year, and I'm surprised he hasn't gotten banned. 
---
He even thinks the Sony 3 strikes (report) isn't a real thing, because he has never faced the consequences.
---
He doesn't understand he will lose all his games, and even gets cocky about it, thinking he's untouchable. He's certainly one of the lucky one's, because he is extremely toxic asf.
---
I want a killer that just beats the shit out of survivors.
---
M1: a solid and sturdy right hook, strong, fast, and reliable.
---
Ability: when close to a survivor you can perform a finisher: randomized animation will play, body slam, RKO, Ora Ora beatdown, etc
---
Passive ability: able to throw a survivor on a hook from 15 meters away 
---
“Get the fuck on that hook you fucking dweeb”
---
-punch killer
---
So not worth the purchase if I'm not running maps?
---
Ruin bbq nurses and sloppy
---
Pgtw, discordance and stbfl are good choices too
---
Then tell me before the music stops
---
Put more texture on the entity's claws
---
The worse the killer the better the points
---
Honestly as killer, sometimes I'll just keep running into the same exact person (who is usually a potato) without meaning to.
---
360 on fleek. 👌🏽
---
Bloodhound is seriously underrated. It’s almost impossible to lose an injured survivor while under its effect, and most killers do want some sort of tracking/information perk. With self care not quite as popular as it was before and staying injured vs Plague/Legion more of a thing, it can have its place.
---
Yea I thought it was a base speed increase in this game though percentages of speed are crazy the five difference of huntres is noticable but I think the quicker wipe will roughly serve the same purpose but still give some fighting chance to survivers
---
i had a similar situation like this, i got downed but the animation of me getting into a locker played, i couldn't get out and the killer couldn't get me out so i just had to bleed out
---
You can get her for free with shards though. Definitely not her.
---
Freddy,pig,shape, and ghost face all require to pay for. + leatherface. 
---
You can unlock most killers with shards
---
Why not Carl?
---
Tik tok makes me ill. Sorry.
---
It’s one thing to trash talk but a completely different thing to use hate speech. But yeah your friend should still be careful lol.
---
i try not to get salty when a killer uses it because i run it with blood warden :)
---
Pre-rework Adept Legion.  Good luck getting through the game without a dc lol.
---
It’s always fun to see people losing their minds over a videogame
---
I dont have leatherface, I think he only can be bought with real money if Im not mistaken
---
Why not the crapper, he is the cousin of the trapper
---
Wow, you clearly have a rank 1 on your hands there... what an excellent killer! Amazing technique.
---
Freddy being awoken by nightmares
---
Ironic
---
I was hoping you'd try to touch it
---
Weird perspective
---
M first was huntress followed by my one of my new mains pig  but I've actually  gotten legion back when everyone complained about him even though I didn't know the exploits I'm like wait hes broken but I dont even use him like that
---
But... but... self care tho
---
Im some runes stuff
---
now clean me
---
Bruh it’s hilarious. He did it the whole duration of my hook and I couldn’t get off 😂
---
Can we rework bubba? Like give the poor baby some love. He doesnt need to be S tier but he really needs some addons changes or a base kit tweak.
---
I just picture a Dio Walk
---
I know, it’s not my fault you suck at staying out of sight.
---
Come on freddy its pronounced  sloppy butcher and thantophobia
---
This is not a shit post. 4 survivors should be able to overpower over some skinny guy holding a knife.
---
Add make your choice and you have the very best freddy perks. Probably run ruin too
---
Don’t make me laugh
---
i mean yeah that’s fair but he’s only like 5 bucks to get him forever
---
It’s definitely a must have perk for killers, I always suspect them to have it
---
That's still invisibility, which makes him a stealth killer (at least when survivors are awake). So again, what about Freddy?
---
How toxic were you though
---
Love killers like this, you can just know they grew up in a loving household knowing what the meaning of fun is.
---
If you want an extra spicy endgame try adding Rancor and Remember Me to that. Just make sure you actually get some kills with that otherwise you're gonna get fuckin' roasted
---
I do it all the time in both solo queue and swf and both work out reliably and I live most games. I dont get why you guys love to bitch about taking maybe a few minutes off of a gen and do a damn totem.
---
Bruh literally not at all I was on a gen and he found me so I started running and he eventually downed me and then hooked and stood there. 😂😭
---
Well they can’t just let a character go to waste on one trailer right?
---
Just because it doesn't, doesn't mean it cant
---
Dude 😂 I just sit there like yeah man you’re so good
---
Question: Should I waste my shards on two of them for BPs or should I just save them for next week’s shrine/buy a new Killer?
---
Last gen &gt; guy on hook
---
What was the context tho did you BM or be toxic?
---
Once Saw an injured Ace who was running Up the Ante find a brown Med-kit with abdominal dressing on it and nothing else. It legitimately made me cringe because of how bad his luck was.
---
(Abdominal makes you lose 25% of your heal charges in return for faster heal speed, meaning the Ace couldn't even heal fully),
---
i did try a little bit before recording, but i don't think it can hit you
---
A killer disconnecting has no real consequences. Match is over- find a new one. If you're playing solo, this won't be problematic. If you're in a group, then it will take forever to find a lobby- again, just play solo, faster que's 
---
If a survivor disconnects, that team is F.
---
Terrible game for everyone, but the killer. Since teammates need to pick up the slack.
---
What’s BM? And no it was at the beginning of the match first person he found was me and I don’t play toxic never tea bagged or any stupid stuff just ran and tried to hide.
---
I dont think itd effect the Nurse much, but loops with no way to mindgame shouldnt be as common as they are now. Making more loops have LOS blockers would help out weaker killers though.
---
Also Nurse's base kit is fine.
---
Okay? You could literally make that statement about anything. My statement stands Freddy is on par if not more evil than Myers ever could be. Myers has an almost innocence to him as he kills. Freddy? Sociopath.
---
I got knocked down twice today because of a bug in the rank reset. I was originally rank 14 got bumped to 16, Logged off for a bit. Hopped back on and it ranked me down again to 18. Even when I was knocked down the first time I felt like I had to carry my team a majority of the game. Still though I had enough good players to win (or at least allow myself to be sacrificed for others to win). But then I got bumped down to 18...
---
Lmfao, and BM is just like bad mouthing. So yea this kid is really good then
---
You know. I saw some guy had iron will 3 yesterday, and I told him he was moaning a lot. 
---
He said he did notice it too. They said they think the killer has stridor, could that be it guys?
---
He was moaning loud on iron will 3
---
The only time I ever use NOED is to get a few bp and then take the survivor to the exit gate.
---
After I died I sent him a message and I was like jeeezzz man you’re so good and he was like LOL YOU MAD ?
---
Ask the dev team, get a ticket
---
There is no way that a creature with the power to abduct, create worlds, force people Into killing is afraid of someone with a knife. Myers can be as evil as he wants, it's not going to hurt the entity in any way. It might be annoyed it can't control him, or he won't kill for the entity, just for himself. But fear is not what it is.
---
He respond back?
---
Wouldn't it be cool if they put an additional perk for both killer and survivor on the shrine, and the spots are guaranteed to have a Franchise DLC perk?
---
Except they weren't doing the last gen.  They were healing (keep in mind, no one had been hooked yet.  I was first hook all game)...and they let me stay on without even attempting to come to my side of the map.
---
***CRITICAL MISSION FAILURE***
---
This is probably something they are doing for the long term. Making all perk tiers similar and eventually get rid of it.
---
Arent bi and pan the same thing?
---
i'm sorry i don't get it. i don't own a ps4, so i don't know what you mean. does it overheat and make fan noises?
---
And the wait for Discordance continues.
---
It's bc of how dusty the inside of your ps4 is. I'd recommend cleaning so it can be an epic gaming experience
---
Yeah, I've avoided him before, and now refuse to play with him. I stopped playing SWF in general. It's depressing when everyone starts rage quitting or showing their true colors on how everyone is replaceable. (Psn friends have no loyalty) 
---
Playing with many people throughout the years. Then again, it's not hurtful, i knew people's intentions beforehand. 
---
I actually enjoy coop games with randoms, since I don't have to use a mic, and since it makes games spontaneous, and unexpected.
---
I’ve started using lightweight and iron will and holy fuck does it mess with rank 10 - 20’s killers minds lmao
---
There was some salt from the Meg the game before, so maybe they didn't want to try, as for everyone else idk
---
Ah true.. Man, this sure sucks then lol I hope I'll be able to pip fast enough to leave them behind
---
same
---
I cant unsee what i saw
---
Botany is good for medkits and works well with selfcare. Iron maiden is good with huntress. The rest...
---
My bad.
---
Adrenaline is noed? It's helping you when you're doing your objective and you get rewarded unlike noed where you can be an unskilled killer and still get a few kills because you got a perk that rewards you for being bad.
---
Why are we complaining about a mid-tier perk?
---
Wait was that you on mother’s dwelling?
---
What does Mori’d mean?
---
Find a good grinding killer like LF or The Doctor And then get 1 million BP for someone with good perks so you can get them for teachables.
---
*shhhhhhhhhh*
---
Yeah and this dipshit didn’t even have insidious he was just being an asshole
---
Did you survived?
---
I'm not even trying to be an asshole when I say it. I've reached red ranks every rank reset and not one game have I ever heard someone complain about those two. So it honestly caught me off guard.
---
I always go second phase on first hook, even when playing with friends.
---
Well, to be fair, it doesn’t work 100% of the time. Look at some of the clips on my profile since I play Xbox and maybe it will help you figure some things out.
---
lmao sloppy butcher😂
---
If anyones curious, I believe OP used Brantsteele Hunger Games simulator. Honestly its really fun.
---
Is this apart of the legion bio or is the legion based of a killer movie, the purge maybe??
---
It's not even that good (to the point where it deserves complaining about) its only really good on killers with much mobility like freddy, nurse, Billy
---
thats always been the theme I got from the game's intro movie. Someone screams off screen and Jake is like leave her and help me do this gen! meanwhile dwight just hides and watches claudette and jake get murdered.
---
I believe OP's asking about a pc as they stated they have a switch and also to answer their question I personally play on pc and have for a few years now (not just DBD which I only started really playing this past sunday) But I would say if you could find a decent pc or have one built it's 100% worth it for the amount of games on the platform. Note I have no experience with DBD on switch although I do own one so can't help with that. However if you have friends that would be willing to join you in getting pc's it's wonderful albeit a little on the expensive side however you wouldn't need to really get anymore consoles unless it's handheld really ever again unless they have an exclusive you are dying to play. It's 100% worth looking into and depending on age (thinking highschool to college age) you may be able to get help securing a laptop thats decent using the excuse it will help with school. I would recommend this laptop in that case as well as a decent mouse  [https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Predator-Overclockable-Aeroblade-PH315-51-78NP/dp/B07CTHLX8C/ref=sr\_1\_4?crid=1452PWUNZAWHM&amp;keywords=helios+300&amp;qid=1565747581&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=helios%2Caps%2C169&amp;sr=8-4](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Predator-Overclockable-Aeroblade-PH315-51-78NP/dp/B07CTHLX8C/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1452PWUNZAWHM&amp;keywords=helios+300&amp;qid=1565747581&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=helios%2Caps%2C169&amp;sr=8-4)  it's still expensive but has fairly decent components only needing a extra hard drive later on. Or you could try to build an actual pc but then you need a keyboard monitor etc. But my pc has been my all time best spent money and I've had it for going on 3 years now but it's more expensive. Thats just my opinion anyways but steam sales are also a great way to save money on games that may be full price on other systems
---
Lol you don't need all that extra shit for me to make fun of you if you don't get kills. noed alone is just fine :)
---
Lol nurses base kit is fine, that sure is one opinion
---
Depends if you think theres more than 2 genders
---
I went back to save someone, saved them, got downed, and then got facecamped and toxic afterchat. At least I saved them :')
---
Self care, spine chill, borrowedtime and an exhaustion perk of your choice (lithe, Sprint burst, dead hard) or swap out self care for adrenaline or decisive strike
---
Remove the Speed boost from it
---
1. If it's removed it would be harder to track noed
---
2. Also without the boost it could give the survivors more time to open the gate
---
Didn't read because your suggestions are terrible and you should feel bad. See my username, fucktard.
---
Nope. Ps4 :P
---
Because your playing on a console and it has generally shittier performance and can't handle as much
---
Siege does it. 
---
The ps3 used to actually lift up off the ground playing GTA 5.
---
Ace in my hole:
---
You can hide drugs when you shove them up your ass
---
You can at any point in the match take pull out some drugs from your ass and offer them to other survivors
---
if they accept they die instantly
---
if they decline you get super mad and gain the option to mori them
---
Happened to me yesterday. Literally did NOTHING to the killer but he decided to tunnel me for 4 gens. He ended up 1k'ing so I'm not too upset.
---
/r/MisreadSprites
---
I also notice an increase in both DCing and crashing today I've only played since sunday but haven't crashed or anything and only ran into a few people DCing (I play killer btw) but I've crashed atleast 3 times today and have had tons more games where we don't even get to load in because of a DC does this happen everytime?
---
Lithe or Sprint Burst would have done it, let Sprint Burst recover 99% and run, get the first unhook, sprint away from the Killer, vault or use a pallet, get the second unhook, ride an injury to the third (or if the Killer slugs the second unhook, you get to the third anyway).  
---
There are three people up, all three people you unhooked, or you (full health) and two of them, letting you take a hit for the last unhook and then the person on the ground gets picked up while one of you (last unhook or you) are being chased.
---
I mean I know we're not talking about actually you, but I've tried some daring saves with a mixture of 99-recovered exhaustion (Sprint Burst) and Unbreakable against NOED before. Didn't work out, but I got both unhooks and picked myself back up...
---
I still died though, and one of them didn't even get out! I was pretty annoyed.
---
Try and glide to left and right ( if you have time ) then do the 360 tends to help a bit
---
It's within their incentive to make it bad. Less perks you want means that you'll have to grind it out, or buy content locked behind DLC/shards.
---
That's how PC circlejerkers 🅱️
---
Oh look, another retard who never played Nurse before has an 'opinion' on her base kit. How cute.
---
I expect nothing and I'm still disappointed.
---
so begin moving one way, then spin the opposite direction?
---
It is a tactic and takes skill to win doing this if he beat you it means your team was bad. The time it takes to camp one full kill your team should be done 3ish gens.  Camping is a bad tactic and is only good against bad teams.
---
Well I go by facts and rn there is only 2. There is no biological science that has come out to say otherwise.
---
But if the op wants to go by pan , I can respect. Just know that I am ignorant to all preferred pronouns.
---
That was so funny 😂
---
What's different about it?
---
Amazing as always, keep up the good work.
---
Lol.. Glad u like
---
The butthurt in this post is overwhelming.
---
Seems about right.
---
They most likely will never add anything of the sort. That's what the lead director said once so expect to never see anything of that sort
---
Most likely he thought you were just messing with him. Some killers do that, give survivors hope then take it away. It really bothers some people.
---
I'm assuming you changed your mind part way through, but why close hatch if you're going to let the survivor go?
---
&gt;I literally had a killer camp and tunnel everyone. 
---
Two things here love;
---
Tunneling is going after one person til they're dead and ignoring others so how can you tunnel everyone?
---
How where you guys not done with gens after the 2nd full hook to sac camp? Lol
---
Mhmmmmm this was me all evening today.
---
The other 2 got out
---
It was the last of one of the ardent wreaths I had. I'll check which I'm missing in a couple minutes.
---
Yet "camping is rare." Lol
---
I always thought of the Night Mother from the brotherhood quest line in Skyrim
---
No that's too obvious, start like shaking ( aka spam left and right ) It can confuse the killer
---
What skill does it take to do this? I’m curious
---
Look at how its shaped. The current bloodwebs have cuts to not make that shape.
---
Yeah that's what I did lol I only pay for the perks that are on characters I don't have, like LF with BBQ and Franklin's. After that I just spend the shards on perks I already have for the extra BP.
---
I ran it once and git hate mail for apparently speed hacking.
---
NOED boils down to either a small nuisance that slows a good player down a bit, while taking up a killer perk slot during the early game.
---
 or a perk that punishes a player late game and rewards a killer for the effectively empty perk slot in the early game. I don't get the complaints.
---
Yeah i was just wondering if this sort of thing is to be expected with a reset (even though I went back like a rank) it was still frustrating to crash or just freeze up.
---
They can make it where if you cleanse 5 totems, it won't activate at all.
---
Any time I see 3-4 people load in at once, SWF or not, I switch to a toxic killer build and play as toxic as possible. Using Discord? That's a paddlin'.
---
Like a moth to a flame it was fun to do it as trapper
---
Rest mode? I usually just shut it off when I give it a break.
---
Alright. At least TRY to be nicer about it in the future. i made a suggestion. You disagree. That's all that needs to be said. And I don't think the suggestion is terrible, as almost everyone else who commented seems to think its a decent idea, or at least think i'm on the right track.
---
buckle up is one of the worst perks in the game
---
You do an execution animation on the survivor which kills them on the spot, no hook needed. It is from memento mori add-ons.
---
Me too. I like to use annoying  perks only when I'm really bad at a killer or learning them.
---
Thanks for the reply! Is quick and agile a bad perk?
---
No. I play a lot of Leatherface, and you won't believe how many people will wait for you to start charging your chainsaw, then jump in a locker because they don't want to be insta-downed. With Iron Maiden, them jumping in a locker becomes a really bad strategy and will set up for easier chainsaws later on in the game. If people forget about Iron Maiden, it's a free insta-down. If they remember and you get close enough, it's a free insta-down or at the very least a pallet broken
---
Just ignore the post and leave idiot. I was making a logical suggestion and if you disagree with it, tell me why instead of crying like the sensitive baby killer you are.
---
That was a face of pure focus
---
Becaus people like to use lockers to dodge the Chainsaw and iron makes them
---
&gt;I'm pretty sure they said they won't ever remove perk tiers on stream and Q&amp;A just make it so each tier is closer to one another so the perk is still useful at any tier
---
They also said we would never get a killer Clown. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
They talked about doing stuff to reduce the grind so who knows.
---
I don't know why people legitimately play like that.
---
It looks much cleaner for sure!
---
Literally going over the legion rework, every single attribute of his power was nerfed minus the duration he stays in feral frenzy and his movement speed when not using his power. Other than those two things it was a complete nerf. Legion was the number one killer on console before he was reworked, whether that included dc’s is something I don’t know but either way, legion was completely unfun to play against. 
---
He wasn’t made more viable, he was just turned into a standard m1 killer with a semi-guaranteed first hit on survivors. He went from being basically uncounterable to being too counterable imo, I’ll admit I don’t exactly have like 5000 hours of survivor and killer gameplay lol
---
That's what I thought. I closed it before I changed my mind.
---
Playing both, I would gave to agree. DBD is much better than F13.
---
Transgender and intersex dude.
---
Ay! The killer is just trying to slow the game down just a little bit
---
Literally
---
Anti-NOED Gamers Rise Up!
---
The face of a man/shark on a mission lol
---
Like how much no are we talking I might get him...
---
[umm, no?](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/719/CPIDC1XE8JBT.jpg)
---
There are literally more people playing solo than not. You expect half of the playerbase to coordinate by sheer force of will?
---
It is also a little odd when you realize he’s devotion 1 level 78 lol
---
It rewards the killer for not being able to protect gens.
---
Yeah every now and then, I'll go in with the IH, and Ebony Mori, and the leather loop. I feel bad doing it, but it's a special treat on occasion.
---
He is in general a frustrating killer to master
---
I'm not 100% sure if this is the reason or not, but say a red rank player stop playing dbd for a long time. When they get back, they obviously lost a lot of their skill just simply due to forgetting. So they shouldnt be in red ranks, but rather a much lower rank. I'm pretty sure that's the only reason rank reset exists. Doesnt justify it at all, just make a system where you lose a pip everyday, so much more tolerable!
---
I haven't seen them either but from I heard he ws just a family boi ^_^
---
Well, he's definitely not like "sane", but I wouldn't say he kills out of madness.
---
r/memetemplates
---
yeah she killed her self after downing someone else within a couple of seconds of hooking her.
---
Your right they nerfed it forgot
---
Neither, i'm of the opinion that he needs a good old fashioned re-work to be less annoying.
---
Or when you see them running away from the hook but don’t see their teammate that unhooked
---
Or even just a pip every week or two or something it’d be too much if it was everyday because of vacations and work and stuff. Or even ranking down only by 1 rank maybe.
---
Yeah. The entity enjoys feeding off of emotions. That's why if you kill survivors too quickly it becomes displeased. You're supposed to hook them multiple times. You're supposed to drag the match out. You're not just supposed to dominate them and kill them quickly. Which is what Michael tends to do when using his best offerings. Instead of torturing or terrifying more efficiently he just kills. He doesn't put them on a sacrificial hook... He stabs them and tosses their bodies aside. The Entity must hate him for that due to his Disobedience and Pure Evil
---
New Decisive is an anti-tunnel perk, and as the game is, it is way too easy to tunnel someone. There should at least be a warning of some kind at a point in the game if the killer has NOED, as IMO the big problem of it is that it might not even be there and just wastes valuable time for free.   
---
  
---
Also: imagine punishing players for completing their main objective.
---
Just cleanse all 6 though?
---
Thank you so much! The reason why I run Poised + Sprint Burst is wanting to get out of dodge and to the next gen discreetly. I do like your explanation of Lightweight compared to the last critique I got about it; you actually go into depth on why it's not that great instead of "This perk is ass, drop it". 
---
In terms of pallet efficiency, how do I adapt to teammates wasting pallets?
---
Sooooo you think it shouldn't be nerfed?
---
I run NOED and haunted ground on my spirit to one shot people out of her in is.
---
Toxic gamers rise up.
---
Both ideas are good IMO.
---
What's your loadout?
---
Note that all 4 of those survivors get killed by a blind trapper.
---
Okay I noticed that addon says "a healthy survivor that frees themselves is put into the downed state"
---
So it will put them into the downed state if they are "injured" as well?
---
Yeah so far the only thing being cloak does is increase your speed or when you stand and become completely invisible which is only good for camping which no one likes or blocking hatch and closing it on the survivor
---
10/10
---
Paragraph?
---
PGTW is a meme-level perk for like 90% of its life span. It gets its buff and is considered less of a meme tier perk, but you should still probably run something instead of it.
---
New Freddy comes out. "Stop using PGTW, I'm tired of seeing it"
---
And if you're not used to BBQ &amp; Chili by now, not sure what to tell you. It'd be like complaining about seeing an exhaustion perk on a Survivor.
---
I like resets. Finally I can get away with 360'ing again.
---
Alot of ppl might be taking the opportunity to derank so they can play with their less skilled friends
---
As a killer main, I’m always thankful for Rank Reset. &gt;.&gt;
---
When Leatherface is a Paragraph but Ghost Face is a Chapter. 
---
Leatherface even added a new map (Grim Pantry).
---
The link for the gif is actually called "ranks_survivor_karl.gif"
---
The game takes your rank from 20 and halves it. That's how many ranks you lose.
---
20-1=19
---
19÷2=9(ish)
---
1+9=10
---
Seems fair and balanced
---
Why dont survivors get punished for Tbagging? Like maybe a move speed reduction for spamming crouch more than 3-4 times within a certain time frame. As a player trying to come back to the game i find the toxicity keeping me from enjoying the game, used to be rank 8 killer btw.
---
I suck at this game. How do I escape the killer when he chases me? And what are tips that would be beneficial to new players?
---
Pink drop item rates are consistent, but you could get unlucky with drawing splinters or pink addons instead of moris.
---
Ok nerf NOED you nerf Adrenaline just saying
---
Me: I'm gonna play dbd uwu
---
PS4: visible sweating
---
Luck doesn't affect chests tho,but devs said they will implement that eventually.
---
The only thing luck affects currently is unhooking yourself and escaping from a bear trap,and that's it.
---
I got red key with two yellow add on today!!!
---
I stopped running noed like 2 months into maining killer from baby-tier , haven’t turned back , its for-sure a crutch perk, I prefer blood warden or rancor if ur gonna HAVE to run a endgame perk
---
OMG ITS HORRIBLE AGAIN!!!!!  Woooooooh!!!
---
I just made a post about my personal idea about it and my opinion on its re-work. Feel free to go check it out and give me your opinion :D
---
I like how you are trying to make the game more positive, but seriously, JUST DESTROY THE TOTEMS!!
---
The survivor: IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT!!!    Goodbye everyone I'll see you all in therapy.
---
Totems do not progress time needed to activate and open gates. They instead harm generator completion times. You should not have to worry about a perk that may not even be in the game.
---
Well since you have your normal human powers you will be able to run alot faster than any killer and the entity cant do you shit, that means that you can hurt the killer and youre probably bigger than the killers...(someone made a post stating that survivors are very smol)
---
I run NOED because survivors always complain about not having enough objectives. Well NOED gives you one
---
I think she’s a great killer on the game she’s awesome.
---
It’s not about being good... it’s about sending a message..
---
New Killer: The Ocean.
---
Very elaborate but on point I like ur perspective.
---
made with mematic
---
Thank you!
---
Tell that to my friends who still won’t let it go FIVE DAYS LATER
---
I think everyone needs to play both sides so they can make these realizations vs the normal me vs. You mentality.
---
I P3ed all my 12 killers and 3 survivors just for the accomplishment feeling of having grinded everything I could. Can't say I noticed significant changes on the bloodwebs. Do it for the personal satisfaction and bloody clothes.
---
With the in-game shop being so good and popular, bloody clothes are not even that interesting anymore.
---
I tried to get Claudette to full perks without prestiging but shortly after I spent a shitload of BP in her past level 50, I regretted the decision.
---
Thanks I try to go hard on that part being that it’s really common for the smaller objects to lose details.
---
Guys. Blow some compressed air though your damn fans. Take that shut apart and clean it.
---
I’ve had mine since the day it came out and have never had that problem
---
I appreciate it. Thank you!
---
That happens on my PS4 too! Except now I can’t even play the game on mine Bc it overheats and shuts off.
---
DBD is the only game that causes this. 
---
I have to use my fiancé’s PlayStation or my friends.
---
I did it for the trophies. The bloodwebs are the same
---
u/JohnnyGotCaged you going to tell us the joke or what?
---
I can absolutely see that, because, of the three paragraphs, only Bill is excluded... But that's just it: the Left Behind "chapter" isn't included. (Maybe that's the joke?)
---
Death is not an escape
---
Legion's bio.
---
Because it's crouching.  Imagine if they tried to implement this, it'd be a disaster.
---
Love samination! I’m on YouTube also but no we’re near his subs 😂
---
But that thing made with mematic
---
If you want to do it for appearance, worth it. If you want to do it for luck, definitely not worth it.
---
That is why i run kindred when im with randos
---
Thanks for the answer
---
that pisses me off so much, acting like they're gods at the game by camping you
---
Paragraphs were DLC that didn't include a Killer, Survivor, *and* a map in the bundle.
---
To do this and actually win(as in down 3+ and pip) you need to do some mind gaming of some sort as well as a couple reasonable chases between facecamps.
---
Happens all the time to everyone.
---
You mean a Rubber Glove ;)
---
In all fairness, Adrenaline is really good. what if your on the hook you don't get healed and you don't get the speed boost?
---
At high ranks you need ruin to even be able to play the game
---
Do not sit there and say it takes skill to stare at a hook with 4 gens up as a Billy.  Just don't man.  You cannot possibly spin this turd.
---
Yes but also no. I think No mither should be better, but dear god do I not want to see it on any of my teammates. I like my altruism bloodpoints from healing tyvm.
---
Literally they just do it to show their “power” like lol ok buddy we get it you’re a god at this game
---
Why would it be a disaster? Devs have done similar changes in FPS games to prevent the abuse of cover.
---
true but for NOED  killer has to know where survivors are which is usually by exit gates
---
It literally took me an hour to grind out Ruin on hag. Y'all just whiners
---
Yeah I’d like to know who does this and actually wins and makes good progress lmao
---
yeah, exactly. I think it's fair to say he's like hillbilly, but worse, but he could be like hillbilly, but worse, but still also be good. I think he's pretty easily the worst killer in the game rn. His power is basically just bait for him to waste time and without it he's a true blue m1 only killer
---
Your goal is to escape alive, not escape alive in 5 minutes. "harming generator completion times" is a non-complaint. 
---
The killer properly patrolling also "harms generator completion times". Chasing does too. Everything the killer does, is to hamper your completion of generations and kill you.
---
Google "spongebob lou" and find images there. Had to make the two panels myself.
---
2 of those are already perks. That being said I love it. The Virgin Nurse vs The Chad T-Rex
---
What do you mean “with getting downed” or “leatherface?” Most of the times it happens to a healthy or merely injured survivor, and no one plays Leatherface lmao it happens with any killer. I think there’s a variety of things that cause it, but I don’t think it’s either of these. I’ve had it happen to me while I got a sprint burst, and a lot of times I see people having been hit by the killer out of the gate, which gives them that speed burst. It might have something to do with the speed boost giving the game trouble in registering an escape.
---
Honestly it's a really underrated perk.  You instantly know whether to save or gen rush.
---
thank you! i’m very up to date if you couldn’t tell, haha.
---
Idle Crows. As in, the crows that would appear if you were idle for too long.
---
okay. thank you!
---
I'm not addressing your problem with NOED there - I'm addressing the argument that totems aren't an objective because they harm generator completion times.
---
Totems are ALWAYS an objective, regardless of NOED or not. Same as Altruistic Actions are an objective. They aren't the main objective, but you should be doing it.
---
Zero map offerings too, weird.
---
I’m pretty sure I saw a video on this today on YouTube.
---
Detectives is good
---
I will remember your name and i will see you as a killer, what rank?
---
It's crouching. Does it really bother you that much? If tbagging really bothers you I would suggest that competitive online gaming is not for you.
---
LMAOOOOOO
---
Game theory: BHVR added this to hint that Carl, in fact, survived his encounter with Ghostface. /s
---
Not worth it unless you’re bored.
---
Idk,this is from a conversation i had with some of my friends a week ago or so
---
I’m gonna be honest, I think huntresses hitboxes need to be somewhat broken but not this broken
---
i was rank 9 before rank resets and i havent played today but i usually stay around 10 and i main quentin and nea
---
Self care seems pretty worthless these days.
---
Imo, trapper should be higher and Pig should be either second bottom or bottom. Ghostface should also be up there with Myers.
---
Not cool man, not cool
---
Leather face - the cannibal
---
This isn’t true, please stop spreading misinformation. This is just a theory people have been spreading around on reddit because BHVR is working with Netflix.
---
Had this happen the other night on Xbox. I only lost my offering because the killer dc’ed a minute in the match
---
Usually I'll just slug em and leave as a warning haha
---
This was the best idea so far.
---
Also notice something between the yellow coin and the medkit at the bottom. Never seen that perk before.
---
Imo as a survivor main who plays killer from time to time noed is fair game if the killer doesn’t run pop and ruin  (bonus if they use top tier killers with an ebony,) those games are what make me want to quit.
---
fair point
---
Mine goes to the moon.
---
I never said totems weren't an objective. I said totems are not the main objective and do not help progress to open gates, unless a hex like Ruin is active, as cleansing a ruin speeds up your repair time compared to when the Ruin was active.
---
Okay i have the same rank. Maybe ill see you and show you my collection of nurse teleportations lol
---
It’s a 50/50 chance you won’t be hit no matter how good your 360 is. I seem to have better luck when I don’t move my camera stick and do a slower wider 360
---
Bruh I don't even need to load a game and that shit be heading down Heathrow runway 2
---
Its alright but its an old perk and by that i mean it keeps returning like every 4th or 5th rotation. Is it just bad luck or rng bot is stupid ? We never got Head on or Distraction etc .
---
im toxic
---
He knows, if you’re referring to op saying bad luck, he’s definitely referring to the players luck, not his in game luck stat.
---
Mettle of man is a shit perk now. Barely even works right.
---
Wrath=friend who just got the game
---
Nurse=you with 3000+ hours with everyone p3 and lvl 50
---
Acurrate spanish because ace is argentinian, argentinians speak spanish
---
How long does it take you to get to level 46 from 0?
---
i realize the perks are already perks, but they are those perks only to the extreme to the point where they aren't balanced at all. as the whole post is a meme.
---
And it ain’t like they were small names either- Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Saw, A Nightmare on Elm Street? Freddy fuckin Krueger? That shit was huge.
---
Yeah I love running that when I have open a gate daily. I’ll add wake up too. Or during rank reset when you know you’re going to see a higher rate of killers lower than your skill level but they have noed.
---
I've been trying to time Blood Warden so that the timer runs out before the perk does but I never get it quite right.
---
Yeah, after what you just said I can tell you either don’t give a shit about the game thriving, or you contribute to the toxicity and don’t want your ability to flame to be taken away. Nice job promoting the game by suggesting I play something else though.
---
True
---
When that happens I give up on gens and just try to get chased or if I have to do gens I tap, still an incredibly annoying bug tho
---
Lol were ya?  It's okay to admit you're wrong.  
---
Did you take a few sweaty laps around it OP?
---
Not really worth a perk slot, def not worth buying the teachable. Even tho self care isn’t that great anymore it’s still worth leveling claudette.
---
I play both. And I find noed completely balanced.  It’s a hex perk. Every hex perk is completely balanced.  By the fact that you can destroy it.
---
I don't get the hate half the time, NOED is basically Adrenaline. Both are perks that do nothing until endgame where they confer massive benefits. Thing is, Adrenaline can be ran on four people while NOED can be countered by doing totems. Don't get the hate tbh.
---
How long does it take you to get 1 devotion? Normally?
---
You can't hear sound in space, buddy.
---
Don't shit on Bot, just think: Max Bot, Max No One Left Behind, Max We'll Make It, and an Emergency Medkit with Abdominal Dressing and Medical Scissors. All of this while being affect by a baby dwight hiding in a locker with Max Leader. Basically and Insta heal without wasting a medkit
---
/s
---
I laughed so damn hard at this.
---
I run Devour and thrill as spirit and people just assume that it’s haunting. By the time they know it’s not.  It’s to late.
---
Being solo:
---
1 perk to find people (bond)
---
1 perk to not die in the hook (kindred)
---
1 perk to avoid 20 min match with ruin or noed (small game)
---
1 perk that I actually want to use
---
What a fun time playing alone
---
Take you home
---
&gt;How long does it take you to get 1 devotion? Normally?
---
Each devotion requires 353.370 xp total. Again, averaging 500xp per match it would take 706 matches total.
---
How long does it take you to play that amount of games?
---
I booted up the game, ready to play. Saw it was rank recent and immediately changed games.
---
Self care itself isn’t great tho, and it’s really not worth to run 2 perks dedicated to healing yourself.
---
Mine was a joke, literally replaced killer with survivor and power with generator
---
Hey me too, keep being kind :)
---
I feel that
---
Start playing nea and get spine chill, urban evasion and balanced landing. That should be very very cheap since you start with 2 out of those 3 and spine chill shouldnt be too hard to get. If you're new, you're much better off just hiding nearby while working on a gen than just running away and starting off a chase that you dont know how to handle, and in worst case scenario balanced landing is gonna give you a hand if needed. That's for starting, at the very least, once you understand a bit more how to loop/juke/mindgame you can transition into a bit more "meta" build like the one mentioned below, wich also requires a LOT more bloodpoints, but spine chill is gonna be a life savior for you
---
https://i.imgur.com/poQxTe3.jpg
---
Yea but it’s much more worth it to save your shards and level a base character.
---
Mom says its my turn to use the NOED
---
Sounds like fun
---
I'm unsure. Probably 4-5 months of non stop DBD.
---
I'm at level 98, and feels like I've been playing forever. When I took a long break last year.
---
Billlll Nyeee the Science Guyyyy
---
Same with pc tho lol.
---
Depends on how much your charged your chainsaw. You could, but it's also reactable, unlike Hillbilly's
---
I dunno, it's a dark themed horror game with a competitive nature, where only one player is capable of killing the others. A certain amount of edge is to be expected. I'm not a toxic player, I don't grief people and I don't actually tbag.
---
But here's an example: I'll often rapidly crouch by another survivor to let them know I need healed. Actually, a lot of people do. Other people do it to be silly, others do it to say "thanks." Now imagine if you were being punished for that, or if you were nervous about it, not knowing if you're on the verge of hurting your movement speed, when you're already painfully slower than the killer.
---
Toxicity to me is doing things like sandbagging, where you're literally wasting someone's free time just to grief them. Or telling people to commit suicide in the post game chat, etc. Things like tbagging, slugging a survivor who pissed you off, etc.. that's like trash talking in real life competitive sports, to me. 
---
It's a horror game, it's not supposed to be pleasant all the time.
---
I’m the 100th like fight me
---
Wrong? Why I’d never, I thought a man of your stature Mr Late Magic Johnson wouldn’t make such baseless accusations
---
I wouldn’t recommend blowing 2000 shards in botany. Self care, while not great, is a solid perk to have, same with empathy. Claudette should be a character you try and level pretty early.
---
I'm mainly talking about the menu as blasting off then how it gets quieter as you get higher, until it becomes silent in space.
---
You're more of what's wrong with the game than noed is
---
It bothers me only when the SWF group intentionally antagonise me to get their laughs. 
---
The other night I had such a bad game against SWF that I contemplated quitting. Had to take a break to clear my head.
---
Go play Civ :)
---
Meh.. If you win you were better. GG
---
Make it give double BP in survival. Boom. Or in boldness but not both.
---
Before I properly respond, let me just say you’re the first person I’ve ever seen call pre-rework legion ‘the tunneling tortoise’ and I absolutely love that name. Moving on. 
---
The movement speed buff was a very powerful buff but I don’t think it counteracted all of the nerfs stacked on top of one another. Also his movement speed in feral frenzy itself was reduced. I can’t remember the exact speed it used to be but now it’s 125% which is obviously very fast but the speed nerf and duration buff basically counteracted each other (though maybe it is slightly better now, not much of a legion player now nor was I back then) 
---
With my own experience against pre-rework legion, even without Frank’s Mix Tape, he could down a single survivor (by being the tunneling tortoise) pretty quickly due to being able to use his power with only a very small amount of the power gauge being filled, and being able to stab the air for distance gains, plus palleting vaulting and fast window vaulting to aide in the chase to get that next frenzy stab. I can’t quite remember how much a base frenzy stab removed from the deep wounds bar so I can’t give precise numbers as a response.
---
Except now your argument doesn't make sense. 
---
If they are an objective, than you should ALWAYS consider doing them regardless of NOED is present or not. NOED isn't the only reason to worry about them. Thus "You should not have to worry about a perk that may not even be in the game" isn't true, because NOED isn't the sole reason to do totems. 
---
Clearing totems is a risk/reward situation in every game. They are an optional objective and if you don't play around them, you take the risk of them running totem perks and not knowing it until it comes back to bite you in the ass. If you do them, game takes longer but you get rewarded for it. Just like saving another survivor - its risky but doing so successful rewards you - even if it slows you down.  
---
Which is all ignoring that obvious flaw of - if you haven't identified all the killers perks than you are always worried about a perk that may not even be in the game. Good survivors play around any potential killer perks.
---
the same thing is happening this year. We got ghostface as the first killer of year 4, a freddy rework, new licensed cosmetics, all of which would have to be discussed with the liscense holders. Plus, it seems quite likely that the upcoming killer is licensed aswell.
---
Either that or people are trying to say be nice to new players.
---
Seriously man, they haven't gotten a grasp of the game yet, go easy on them.
---
The hatch spawned underneath that dead corpse so it didn’t actually appear.
---
Why is the green map on the bottom left so small. Lmao.
---
So killers should not have to worry about DS, because it may not even be in the game
---
Well thanks lol it’s actually my brothers idea for the perk, just basically remembered what he said from a conversation a while ago
---
It's very hard to properly explain what a survivor should do over text, i'd advice you to just go watch youtube videos about it, it's gonna be a lot more clear.
---
To keep it simple, most new people just run away from the killer in a straight line, and that's basically just gonna get you killed in around 10-20 seconds, what you need to do is when you're working on a gen, or see one you're going to be working at, you need to look at your surroundings and see where you're going to run if you see the killer. In general you want to have 2 options considering he could be coming from where you're thinking of running to. These places you're going to run to should have pallets or, at the very least, windows, since killers take longer than survivors to vault windows and that can save you some time. Once you're in those places, you need to play around with the fact that you can move your camera to look over walls, while the killer cant. So you go around a corner and wait to see if the killer is following you or not, or juke that you're going in one direction then going another.
---
If you're starting it's much more effective if you just run spine chill and hide nearby the gen once you see it light up for a couple seconds (dont just instantly go away every time it lights up for a split second). Dont run since the killer will see the scratch marks.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Yeah i was using that gambler guy perk that increases luck and box luck
---
If I recall, Legion no longer sees how close a Survivor is to bleeding out.
---
&gt; Allows *Feral Frenzy* attacks to **moderately reduce** a Survivor's [***Deep Wound***](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Deep_Wound) ***📷*** timer. 
---
Except since Legion doesn't see the Deep Wound timer anymore, and since Deep Wound's timer doesn't go down while the Survivor is in Legion's Terror Radius (even if they're not in a chase, to prevent moonwalking as an exploit, while still allowing Legion to moonwalk at a loop to perform red stain mindgames), Frank's Mix Tape does not actually appear to do anything.
---
It shortens the amount of time a Survivor has to start mending after leaving your Terror Radius is all, if you want to know by how much, grab someone and test it in Kill Your Friends so that they can tell you (or so they can play Legion and show you).
---
Botony paired with a medkit is insane  combo. Also it helps your team in general. Pair botony with bond and you are cooking son.
---
Why is adrenaline uncommon is my question, last I checked it went from rare to very rare. Maybe now all perks will be very rare are tier three? Not so sure I like that change because I like having some perks be green like enduring. 
---
Unless now perks will also be common like they used to be, but they just can’t be ultra rare, so enduring would go common - uncommon - rare while lightborn would go uncommon - rare - very rare
---
Someone did the math and there is literally zero increase or difference in what you get on the bloodweb from prestiging. I saw it on an article on steam and I’ll link it when i get the chance. My idea is, if you really want to prestige, don’t prestige right away. Farm a metric fuckton of blood points, then prestige so you’re at a comfortable place once, or if you decide to.
---
Wow, Pepperoni?!
---
They exclaim in happiness because their pizza has arrived. It's rude to ruin this moment for them
---
I flashlight blinded her to release them both after we finished that gen. Then she continued playing as normal (which was hardcore tunneling till death.) She tried it on me but i had BT and she ended up Dc'ing end game when she knew she couldnt get me.
---
Are you sure about that?
---
Shit happens, plenty of times I get left to die on my first hook when I carried the team and queued solo...doesn't mean hooks should be reworked
---
*Que Trapper with distressing*

I'm wondering who are the people complaining about NOed? Is it the bad survivors or the top tier players. Almost everyone hates NOed when it's quite balanced as is. 
---
Personally noed has never really been a problem as a survivor. Never. It sure sucked when I got 1 hit, then again I should've done bones. It's just so easy to counter, but as a new player, I guess it can seem unfair. It's really not...
---
No release dates? So you guys can take a year or 2 years for any of these updates?
---
Looks different to how adrenaline looks
---
Any help?

I mean it says right in the post that dedicated servers are still coming out this summer.
---
It makes lockers unplayable for Survivors. Every option they have means they can be insta-downed, especially if they time everything right, they can still be insta-downed once they leave the locker
---
And it's the plague who just got the corrupt purge
---
I can hear my PS4
---
*laugh's in no mither*
---
Lol BM actually stands for bowel movement, as in you’re shitting on someone. 
---
In the gaming community “BMing” has come to mean being toxic and rude by teabagging and such.
---
Theres an extremely high chance that its a stranger things chapter. A while back, there was a teaser from netflix, saying to look forward to collaborations with a few game devs, including Behaviour. The other collaborations have all turned out to be stranger things related.
---
I'm slippin' under
---
Except NOED completely counters adrenaline.
---
This is the first time it’s happened to me, hope it doesn’t become a consistent thing.
---
Try NOED and Devour Hope on GhostFace, god its so fun
---
Funny video footage but my Lord those sound effects it's like they just downloaded a soundboard and started hitting buttons
---
Adrenaline doesn’t last for the entirety of the end, it’s a sprint burst and a heal. And I’ve found it’s quite situational, I’ll be fully health and boom. Adrenaline goes, kinda wasted. I don’t think it’s quite the same.
---
Lmao sounds like a great experience
---
https://youtu.be/DoGbjW1usZk
---
It was fun not gonna lie
---
They hated jesus because he spoke the truth. Just like the survivors mains pretending to be killers hate me.
---
Ha, that reminds me. A level in the first Division game had lots of fog and lights on a rooftop. There was also fire effects mixed with snow particles and it looked amazing. I remember 2 of my friends ps4s automatically shut themselves down due to overheating in that area.
---
Honestly, getting a good gaming computer is well worth it! Especially if you love playing games in general. If anything, pick up a cheap PS4! 200 bucks somewhere from a pawn shop! Plenty of PS4 games AND quite a number of ppl play on PS4!
---
You play the game you want to play it, camp and stay at your rank, walk away and maybe pip up a rank. Or 3 gen strategy, and come back to that hook, chain saw a-blazing, and cut them down like the meat bags they are.....your choice.
---
I agree. When I grinded out P3 Michael I think I had maybe a total of 3 ever. Rolling in ebony though.
---

Go to that link and look for ‘submit a ticket’. In the ticket be sure to let them know all of the progress you lost and you’ll need to give them your PS4 username as well as your player cloud ID which can be found at the bottom of settings in-game. 
---
This is an issue when the game is closed prior to auto saving. I used to deal with this pretty frequently, I think it’s more common on console than pc as I think the game auto saves on pc when you click the ‘exit game’ feature next to ‘store’ on the main menu. 
---
Now I don’t deal with it by forcing an auto save after I spend bloodpoints and/or before logging off by just hopping into the kill your friends menu and then backing out. It’s now just a habit of mine
---
No why would they do mobile as well just console and pc... and console survivor is the same as pc survivor just the killers on pc are better, and is console players just got to get some balls and grow up. I also hope they would make it so console players can use mouse and keyboard. Like cross-platform is a massive step for dbd take less to find matches could have potential to make new game modes. BHVR needs to add cross-platform way more pros then cons!
---
For killer its a hilarious meme fest. I took off ruin and have just been devour hoping people left and right. 
---
I imagine its a nightmare for survivor though.
---
It's most annoying when you have a killer than struggles getting any hooks or downs the whole match, but gets saved by noed, obviously it's not true for all killers. But it does end up rewarding a lot of bad killers.
---

Big brain play: Use the lowest tier of distressing that still gives 100% BP in deviousness but lowest amount of terror radius increase, run monitor, ruin, barbeque. EZ
---
Self care isn't as great as it once was, but its not as terrible as the echo chamber this sub makes it out to be. The utility of healing yourself without a med-kit cannot be denied. Whenever I run it, it's frees me to take a toolbox to pump gens out much quicker and increase my odds of escape/survival. Of course there's a time and place to use it. Ex: Don't just heal in a corner of the map if there's another survivor who can heal you. Botany also isn't just about healing yourself faster, but healing others quicker as well. It is also really useful for solo survivors. 
---
However, I agree people should just level up Claudette to get these teachables but if you'd rather not grind 40 levels there's the shrine.
---
That's nice, enjoy!
---
My friend was stuck in this locker for like 5 minutes. Also the killer was super laggy at the moment that he was trying to jump in the locker to use headon and there he died. Rip. Why’s this even a thing?

Taken directly from the Wiki.

Survivors on Generator | Default Repair Speed (c/s) | Prove Thyself Speed (c/s) | % increase
---
------- |-------|-------- | -------
---
1 survivor | 1.0 | --- | ---
---
2 survivors | 0.9 | 0.99 | 10%
---
3 survivors | 0.8 | 0.96 | 20%
---
4 survivors | 0.7 | 0.91 | 30%
---
I added the % increase column, which is how much of the default repair speed is added to get to the Prove Thyself speed. Remember that this is _per survivor_ so while 1 survivor repairs a generator at 1.0 c/s, 4 survivors repair at 0.7 * 4, or 2.8 c/s, but with Prove Thyself active, at 3.64 c/s. Here's a table for how long a generator takes in comparison.
---
Survivors on Generator | Default Repair Time (s) | Prove Thyself Time (s) | Repair time decrease
---
1 survivor | 80 | --- | ---
---
2 survivors | 44.4 | 40.4 | 4 seconds
---
3 survivors | 33.3 | 27.7 | 5.6 seconds
---
4 survivors | 28.6 | 22.0 | 6.6 seconds
---
Here's a question.
---
Why haven't you patched the bug that won't let you exit the gates?
---
Or self care?
---
Or Dead Hard?
---
Or Mend, or Snap Out of It. You've been silent about it.
---
If my console can run RDR2 fairly quietly, which has some of the best graphics I've seen in a game.
---
I wonder how a game that looks as mediocre as DBD is causing me issue?
---
Definitely the way 2 go.
---
It wakes you up, heals you a health state, and makes you run at 150% for 5 seconds all while triggering through exhaustion. Hell it even is saved if you're being hooked or carried at the time it actives.
---
That shit is ridiculously strong. Noed can be prevented, adrenaline cannot. That shouldn't even be an argument.
---
Go on YouTube and look up "how to loop." There are very helpful videos that will teach you how to lose a killer or/and how to use pallets to your advantage rather than just tossing them and running away.
---
Dstrike has a warning, unless you are using obsession perks.   
---
   
---
also just don't tunnel or slug them
---
It isn't misinformation? And I never said it was guaranteed, but it is extremely likely. Especially considering that all of the other collaborations netflix announced at that time, have turned out to be stranger things content in games.
---
I have a PS4 Pro and it still sounds like a stupid Jet Engine. Spaghetti coding.
---
ITT:
---
"Well yes, but actually no"
---
It also counters Adrenaline
---
It’s a heart with a syringe in it, there’s no other survivor perk that looks like that lol
---
Bullshit. I literally got 10 4ks in a row and had barbecue. Still only level 28 hag
---
0/10 won’t buy unless they get Jeff Goldblum to be the survivor that comes with this chapter.
---
Isn’t it adrenaline?
---
this guy has big brain
---
Now I want more! More Licensed killers!!
---
Saying " just slug them" is the same as "cleanse totems"
---
Of course would be a great idea, imagine having to remember without any aura in which hook that survivor died and good luck finding the moried body. Also teammates don't even stop when I have We'll make it, sure they will stop to me check them
---
Kill them for the glory of the entity.
---
Agreed.
---
I just use it for points, I typically don’t even bother looking to see if there’s anyone revealed by it.
---
Oh the stranger things one? I figured that would probably be the Chapter 14 release if anything, though obviously that’s just what i thought. If it is the chapter 13 one, i guess maybe I should actually start watching Stranger Things to understand the killer/survivor lol
---
You can’t run into one game without it. It’s necessary to even be in the high ranks
---
Thanks for the feedback! I'm just starting to get into editing. And my humor is kinda like that...a little on the cancer side. lol! But I'll keep that in mind that maybe others would like less!
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Luck#Overview
---
“It does affect the Rarity of an Item found in a Chest”
---
&gt;It’s a heart with a syringe in it, there’s no other survivor perk that looks like that lol
---
Its a heart but that is not a syringe. I thought it was Adrenaline too but looking closely and comparing to the actual Adrenaline, the icons are distinct enough.
---
Thank you so much.  When filling this out however I never came across the player cloud ID
---
No
---
If its happening at all, its probably the upcoming one.
---
Oh yeah, I saw that video just after it came out so I forgot about it. I’m a little skeptical that it’ll be the chapter 13 rather than the chapter 14 or 15 release but anything’s possible lol
---
It seems like you missed the point. The term "Genrush" refers to trying to do the gens as fast as possible, not the feeling of being rushed by gens being done 
---
btw, this "rush" is the point of the game. Killer has a limited time to do his job and is rushed to complete it ASAP. Also, the better he does, the more time he has.
---
You can apply pressure on every killer, even wraith or bubba. It's just easier on others.
---
You don't have to tell me what the killer experience is. I play both sides and spent quite a bit of time on them.
---
Did he enter a locker when the dinosaurs broke out?
---
Just because it went to space doesn't mean he had to hear it when it got there, buddy.
---
If you’re playing against a LF you just gotta play smart. Always know where a reachable window or pallet is and play around them. Don’t forget to abuse small trees and other objects if you can’t make a window/pallet.
---
Thing is, I tend to not have a problem with DS because I almost always go for the saviour. DS and NOED are entirely different on how they are set up and how they work.
---
Same. I used to run NOED on weaker killers like Wraith until I survivor showed me how miserable it was to face.
---
nah i deleted all the paths to the lockers
---
&gt;Isn’t it adrenaline?
---
It is slightly different than the Adrenaline icon (no syringe). Here is a better image [Bloodweb](https://deadbydaylight.com/images/game/bloodweb.png)
---
Glad to hear I’m not crazy or just unlucky (not that having more ebonies than ivories is a bad thing for me as a killer lol)
---
You can get called a camper even if you literally never stand anywhere near wherever you hooked. Fuck ‘em all, do what you want
---
Ah you’re right! The quality definitely makes a difference.
---
Play with your food to get 2 pips and move on. You want to get out of those ranks asap
---
I’m just hoping that it’s not a paragraph.
---
Kill them
---
I always put something like ‘hope you enjoyed the view from the hook!’ If they’re being a toxic asshole, saying I’m shit, even though I won fairly
---
I still wouldn't be able to heal those teammates though....
---
I think a good tradeoff on the perk would starting the trial in a new unique broken state. The idea behind this state is you're injured, but unable to heal *yourself* even with a medkit. 
---
You can be healed by a teammate to the regular state beyond this point, but you'll be unable to heal yourself for the duration of the trial by any means.
---
I just unlocked noed for the first time on freddy. Since I'm a new player I have no idea about this power but I've seen enough to be excited lol hopefully I get the higher tiers soon
---
It's not a lazy title though, the title itself actually retorts this accusation.
---

lol Tru3lyTa1entl3ss
---
Whoa, the totems are really neat. Nice work!
---
One thing that could make No Mither unique, is something to do with being picked up.
---
Perhaps making the killer pickup 50% slower. This would give more time towards flashlight saves, and could help the perk combo with things like flip flop, tenacity, and unbreakabill.
---
I like Freddy's because he looks so sassy as if he's checking to make sure his manicure is still A-OK
---
Literally the second rule was not to complain like this, plus they fixed dead hard lol
---
RIP Dwight “The immersion was too much”
---
Might I ask what you don’t like about it? I absolutely love it, it lets me know where to go after hooking someone and even if it doesn’t show me anything, I can get double bloodpoints with it

You have to hook once to mori someone. A long time ago you didn't need a hook.

I mean when I played survivor and got killed because I was just trying to get self care as Claudette that was not fun
---
Same!! I spent so much time on Friday the 13th when I should have just skipped that entirely to get to DBD. I’ve been playing consistently for over a year but I still feel so far behind everyone else haha
---
What I dont get is why do killers get a good perk that also gives an increase to BP in all categories, meanwhile Survivors have to give up a perk slot to farm BP. Like people run BBQ &amp; Chili even when they no longer care about BP.  I also find that even without BP farming perks and offerings, Killers are just easier for farming BP. I just feel at the very least it should be the other way around.
---
Not trying to be a dick but I literally could not understand what you’re saying due to either me being too dumb to decipher your grammar or your grammar just being so bad that it’s incomprehensible.
---
I was in a game where it was just me and a brain dead trapper since all 3 other survivors dc’d. I got my gens done and went for door instead of hatch bc I wanted bloodpoints. I start working on the door and I see the trapper come zooming after me. Next thing I knew I was on the hook.
---
I'm pretty new to the game, but you guys are making it sound like I should buy Leatherface and unlock the BBQ perk ASAP
---
Yeah, me neither
---
F, nice job getting the 3k though!
---
but you can get 2 perks per level.
---
I'll have to do the math later to check how much you'd spend per level on average tho
---
They asked for it like you said.  Thanks again man you saved me some trouble 👍
---
Yes
---
by doing the bones
---
Congrats! Prepare for Nerfs after your hard work and earning your skill.
---
Adrenaline has to be earned and worked for though. NOED doesnt. It rewards a killer for failing their job at protecting gens....
---
also, look how on the picture one node is in the middle of being unlocked and AS THE SAME TIME one is in the middle of being locked. it seems like you'll be able to check what the entity wants. no more guessing
---
she tried desperately which caused me to end up killing her too, press F to pay respects
---
Both monitor and abuse and iron will you can unlock on your own with their respective characters ya loon...
---
The first ones to die.
---
Already got self care. I hate Claudette as a character and i just refuse to spend any BP on her
---
No problem, glad I could help!
---
150k BP is a joke compared to 2k shards.

I’ve been having this issue for a while. It’s happened in the past but not as often as it has been the past two weeks or so. It’s beyond annoying not being able to wiggle and being sent to basement or your team tries taking hits only for you to not be able to wiggle.  Can’t dead hard or heal others or self and this problem is so annoying I hope it gets fixed soon.
---
DS isn’t a second chance perk anymore. If the killer isn’t terrible, you’re probably getting hooked at some point because they’re significantly faster than you and bloodlust exists. DS only protects against camping or proxy camping and tunneling killers. It’s pretty bullshit to get downed within a second or two of getting unhooked, and put right back on the hook.
---
I think Ojomo would probably be a pretty sympathetic guy all things considered. Just someone trying to make the best of the shitty cards he's been dealt, but ends up going down an extremely dark path even though it's never his fault.
---
That said I think the Huntress would be the coolest actual horror villain out of the original killers. She has a sad backstory, an extremely dangerous set of skills, the humming is fucking creepy, and then she has a reason for the protagonists to stick around in the woods (she abducts the youngest female member of the group and they have to save her)
---
Though it'd be great if *somehow* the 13th chapter were Jason Voorhees. Not gonna happen though
---
Yikes ima try that
---
Ok fine
---
I’m sorry but if the Killer has rancor, noed or god forbid BOTH and I’m not the obsession I’m gone
---
Except they’re not right next to each other and 99% of the time the killer is camping one or rushing back and forth between the two? There’s no killer in the game who can’t get to both gates before they’re open unless they spawn directly across from each other on the biggest map or they start a chase.
---
Had my game held hostage by a couple of assclowns last night. I messaged them and told them to play the game or quit. Their response was “no”. They hid and didn’t do gens for a good 10-15 minutes. I just went in a corner and spammed a link to Smash Mouth’s All Star in the messenger until I eventually found them and got one. The other one got away but at least I didn’t lose my points because they were trying to get me to quit. 
---
If you’re the assholes who did this and you’re  in this thread reading this... eat a bowl of poop.
---
It would be a honor
---
Awkward moment when you get more points for escaping through the hatch...
---
Really good mechanic? I wouldn’t go that far. 
---
A way to put some time into killers I don’t play as often for practice, curiosity and generally shaking off the seriousness of games for a week or so until I’m back to the dreaded red ranks? Absolutely.
---
#It also counters adrenaline
---
Almost every match as killer
---
Lol
---
Adrenaline is a meta perk for a reason. NOED can be cleansed, but Adrenaline is always going off no matter what. You underestimate the usefulness of the perk:
---
Complements genrushing so that if whoever is bring chased gets hit or downed, they can potentially run one more loop, which is very crucial in endgame. Endgame is very quick and every second counts.
---
Unhooks at endgame leave you at full health, making you very unlikely to get tunneled, even without Decisive Strike.
---
Full parties being adrenaline healed just generally spells death for the killer. It also hard counters slugging in the late game.
---
I was able to double pip still since I had yanked people off hook and healed before they chose to dc, so it was a win/win for me
---
Technically it still buffed ruin to reduce the grind after getting tier 1
---
Okay that's pretty funny
---
id rather dc and ruin the game for the killer because they dont deserve to have fun if they are going to be sweaty and play a killer which requires no skill
---
Came back to this post because I had a total Karen at work today and I honestly want this as an official survivor now. Would use a morí.
---
EGC = facecamping is fine depending on the situation.  Killers aren't required to let you get rescued for free if there's no real chance for them to apply pressure or down another survivor.
---
&gt;Guess I'm not too convinced by that. You can currently get perks on the 2nd tier of our bloodwebs, it's just not common past level 35ish.
---
They patched that out
---
That’s not even close to true. Hag and Huntress are the only ones I have trouble patrolling gates with usually, and they both have powers that help make up for their speed. Additionally, in most of my games (survivor and killer) the gates are *way* too close to each other, often spawning in the same third of the map. If you’re a killer and the survivors pop all 5 gens, you really shouldn’t be getting a 4k anyway.
---
If the gods could bless us for 3 more for this year. I’d say:      
---
1. Jason Voorhees (doubt it though)      
---
2. Chucky (more likely for a deal, but less for the mechanics).    
---
3. -  demigorgon (Sounds likely at the moment) or,     
---
   - Red, from Us (personal preference)
---
Yes it is, I mean, look at this ghostface running noed lol
---
i've learned recently that Pocket Watch + White Nit Combo shortens fatigue time without any consequence that would hinder your muscle memory while learning her.  
---
good luck, from another player who's trying nurse ( though on pc- )
---
I play for fun as is, I've already got most of what I want. Bad shrines are just unfun and hurt the player base since it raises the barriers to getting good perks.
---
Just let him attack without needing to switch modes. He’s literally the only killer like this.
---
just murder them and don't care about their feelings
---
So you rather ruin the game to 4 people just because of yes?
---
And you dc if a killer is going to be sweaty... do you do that if you or any other survivor do the same?
---
what a relevant fact to put on your PSN profile lmao
---
That's not what he was talking about. Even then who gives a shit why? Don't encourage toxicity because you don't like a perk the other side has.
---
Just a few posts down from this one is a post complaining about how survivors can essentially deny the killer and have the enjoyment of said killer's game in their hands by DC-ing if they don't like the killer of choice the killer player picked. It goes both ways.
---
Also, it adds up in every single game ever. It's called time.
---
Your question isn’t just dumb it also makes absolutely no sense, congrats
---
low effort karma farming post is low effort
---
Gotta be a bombastic match
---
boots to sparta kick survivors to death
---
Sorry I play it on ps4 and never had an issue with matchmaking.
---
Same
---
Guys I have 5 tufts of hair 2 splinters 2 tombstones all before level 40 on Myers and no Mori
---
"Lift her up... AND THEN CHOKE SLAM INTO VICTORY DANCE BIIIIIIITCH"
---
Blood points are nice but not nice enough to get me to buy the perk out the shrine and the whole aura read on hook at x range is just meh just not worth it to me is all im more comfortable patrolling gens works for me plenty fine
---
Doctor
---
Perfectly Balanced As All Things Should Be
---
Spirit, Billy, Huntress, Hag, Freddy
---
Sorry fam, but he is right, that question doesnt make sense
---
nah, his list is one of the better onces
---
I'll tale that as a:
---
"Of course not, i can be sweaty if i want, but no killer can try to win within my sight"
---
Perfect meme to use BBQ and chili
---
Well TF else are we supposed to run? Fucking Coulrophobia?
---
That’s what happens after you have been killed a bunch and just want some fun
---
What part doesnt make sense? I'll see if i can improve
---
Yo i paid money for this game, and i cant play it the way i want to?
---
I just stumbled on these but damn they are drawn so and make me laugh great job keep up the good work
---
How the fuck spirit is sweaty? You cant even see the survivor in the fase walk. If it was tombstone myers or base leatherface i could agree
---
Thank you, but, XS would be too tight for me. Needs to be small or medium size for the Julie cosplay.
---
Thanks! 
---
Why is the doctor bad? I thought he seems pretty good. Seems like it’s impossible for survivors to hide from him with his aura that makes everyone scream.
---
I never knew of such an idea. I wanna hear it
---
Depends on the situation really
---
It counters adrenaline and also counters people not using adrenaline
---
Impale her on your weapon of (m)ass destruction
---
Yeah and I said 6 silly goose. Also ik it’s a joke but if you really care that much then yeah, cleansing all the totems isn’t hard.
---
Never said anuthing about playing with friends.
---
And i actually saw videos of people kiting spirits.
---
also at red ranks every spirit uses prayer beads no joke
---
Ur kidding right
---
I don't have that many teachables right now, so i'll run Adrenaline/Spine Chill and then the last 2 perks will usually be unique ones for each character (currently grinding Dwight and Nea, so Bond/Prove Thyself and Balanced Landing/Urban Evasion respectively)
---
U said being sweaty and its pretty hard to be sweaty unless u have friends who can help u

Def dont agree with this kid about DC’ing, literally just got demolished by a prayer beads spirit 14 seconds ago and dealt with it but she’s sweaty af. You move at 180% speed and as long as you know how to follow scratch marks and they don’t have iron will tracking isn’t all that difficult
---
it sounds to me like english isnt ur primary language and someone dropped a bolder on ur head because ur making no sense at all
---
Dude I'm so sick of this argument. Total horse shit. I don't see **anyone** running distressing even tho it automatically doubles a portion of bloodpoints. 
---
Just saying call a spade a god damn spade already...
---
Because I have a limited time to play and I want to finish this challenge and play with friends right after
---
Can we just get this in game please I need it
---
I run Ruin in low ranks. I don't need NOED, they never get more than 2 generators done.
---
The perfect counter to NOED.

I agree even though I already got it before it came in the shrine
---
Scumbag Jake
---
This is how I feel about the whole thing. Killer has NOED, you get hit by it, you were either dicking around waiting to "teabag" at them, or you were in a chase you were likely losing anyway. I don't even run it when I play killer, but I don't blame people who do because it screws over toxic survivors.
---
Sadly no, i'm not good at kiting :(
---
distressing increases the points you get for your actions, but you still CAN'T get more than 8k, so it actually increases NOTHING
---
What country/ time zone?
---
Don't think so
---
NOED burned our women and raped our churches.
---
Ok and hex thrill of the hunt?
---
That's why detectives hunch is op
---
but seriously tho detectives hunch, bond, openhanded, and Leader (idk about the 4th perk) would be a really good solo info build
---
And I got downvoted for it :(
---
Have you done it before?
---
Not on purpose but yes I have
---
Ah, Alright thanks
---
thank you for the tip and good luck as well!
---
His ability only helps with finding survivors. It does not help with chases, map pressure, or give you mobility (these 3 things are the most important attributes for a killer to be good)
---
This almost happened to me, she unhooked me in a chase and got chainsawed by bubba right after
---
Oh yeah gotta get that face camping spam shocking doctor
---
When ur 10 yo and juke a Baby plaque. "Dead By Daylight plague JUKED!!!!!!!!! Crazy funny juke"
---
Hopefully they’re not to harsh
---
What makes doctor a good killer for grinding? I was also going to ask who is LF but someone already did.
---
Well, it's like NOED but not really counterable.  The only way to counter Adrenaline is to just win before it comes into play.  It's really stupid when every survivor runs it because instead of having a close game where you maybe get 2-3 kills you often get zero kills because Adrenaline completely destroys any pressure you may have built up.
---
I know survivor mains will just say "durr protect gens" but that's a pretty laughable option if you're up against good survivors - especially when so many of the maps are terrible and 80% of the killers are weak vs good survivors.  
---
It's really only egregious when 3-4 survivors have it though.
---
Totems are more efficient than gens in terms of emblem points per second so it would make sense to do them if rank mattered
---
The best killers are nurse, spirit, Billy, hag and huntress
---
Sniper Doctor is best doctor.
---
Its hard to actually define but easy to identify. It varies player to player and senario to senario.
---
nope
---
"Know your fucking place Jane!"
---
Most people rejected his message. 
---
They hated him because he told them the truth
---
At least on PS4, all the licensed survivors and killers cost Aurec Cells. No shards. So without the shrine, if you didn't pay, forget about BBQ n Chili, DS, Mettle etc.
---
For survivors: tbagging, sand bagging, end of game chat toxicity (name calling, death wishing etc). Honestly people say pallet looping but I don’t see it. 
---
Killers: EVERYTHING, okay I’m kidding in all seriousness for killers, it’s not considered toxic but very frowned upon is camping and tunneling. Killers can be toxic but their behavior is looked over since it’s considered harder to play killer( to me personally it isn’t) but hey. Either way that’s what I really see as what toxic is but who knows
---
The problem isn't one survivor having Adrenaline.  It's 3-4 survivors having Adrenaline.
---
All the licensed killers.
---
Can you elaborate on the unbalanced gameplay? I only want to play survivor.
---
Do you remember when it was last on sale?
---
I don’t personally like this idea, but I get the premise. For me, online games are only fun when there’s a grind to achieve something. That “something” in Dead By is improving upon my ranking every season. Without some sort of stat tracker or way to know if I’m improving or not I don’t think I would be as interested in the game.
---
The real answer is whichever killer you are best at.  Whichever killer you can reliably protect gens, drag out the game, and then 4k with.  Doctor is simply fast at maxing devious Ness, and with certain builds, delaying gens.  He cant reliably close chases and 4k as much as some others. (well, unless he's the one you happen to be really good with).
---
I'm too waiting for time zone
---
I think they’re doing a pretty good job.
---
june/july
---
Thx but that was Not the question.
---
He was my first maxed out killer, and I still like him, though he's hard to not depip.
---
Yup. All survivors can essentially be the same if you get teachables and items, as they have no specific abilities. Only difference is cosmetics where some have certain advantages like uhhh... Claudette. 
---
Killers can have builds tailored to the character and perks are better depending on who's using them. A Huntress with Iron Maiden is waayyyy more OP than a Wraith with IM.
---
 
---
survivor vs killer:
---
flashlight click, especially if they have a macro for that
---
teabagging and pointing after getting a lucky stun/window vault
---
running at the killer with DS
---
doing 360 when the killer is behind a window just for show
---
killer vs survivor:
---
teabagging on those who can do that
---
nodding after downing
---
camping
---
hitting you on hook
---
leaving someone to die by the EGC just to see the animation and waste some time
---
moritapping
---
survivor vs survivor:
---
wasting pallets
---
sandbagging
---
repetitively tapping hooked survivors
---
making loud notifications around others for no reason at all
---
both:
---
Mean end-game chat
---
bug exploits
---
I’m normally a survivor but this shit was satisfying to watch. Screw rude survivors.
---
This image has been branded into my brain, I can’t unsee it
---
Did she use the exhaust hatchet hit addon?
---
Did they nerf the combo or something? (Because that sounds like extremely rotten luck)
---
It kind of is im saying anything and everything is toxic. And that you can say something is toxic but you'll find people who consider it fine.
---
as BNP only uses the add-on now, they wanted to use their BNP and then sabo hooks
---
Maybe you do bones next time?
---
Not saying gg.
---
That's actually exactly what I was talking about though? I literally said that if you run noed, have it active in the end game, and STILL don't secure a kill I will make fun of you for it.
---
Trapper can be inconsistent, especially without ruin or corrupt intervention. 
---
Pigs dash isnt very good in my opinion, I was even a pig main for like 6 months and I have over 2k hours as well. I know you can do the dash to jump people in loops but even that is inconsistent as a smart survivor would just run away from the loop (which is still good but nowhere near enough to say shes a strong killer, hag can do the exact same thing and it's nowhere near as risky or takes as much time, and the trap can still help later on.
---
Her traps are also completely RNG, you cant say the traps are good and only hope that you dont get unlucky with the jigsaw boxes for it to be useful. In my experience with slowing down progress, even fucking legions power is better then her traps, as it isnt completely rng and you get a lot of information with it as well. Pig traps were useful originally, when traps automatically turn on when off, as you could use that to keep someone practically hostage and use him for bait as others wont want to leave, until they got rid of that.
---
Clown, Leigon and Pig are very weak, the only reason I disagree with Ghostface is that he isnt a low tier killer and doesn't belong with them. He isnt top ranks but definitely not weak.
---
oh
---
Lol u for real ?
---
US central, I play mostly night time to early AM.
---
Omfg, I'm going to hell and getting my anus pounded by Satan himself
---
I havent really touched it in a few days been playing cave digger and beat saber lol
---
As someone who plays both i find the complaints about noed done cause totems are so easy to rid yourself off. But i also think the people who use it are bad at the game if they need it to win
---
They can say gg ez because technically you have gg in there. Not saying GG? Woow,  that's toxic.

Distressing makes him get 600 bloodpoints per shock, which allows you to cap out deviousness category really easy, which is minimum 8K points. Distressing is also good because it helps your treatment mode put people in T3 insanity way more easily

There’s like 9 meta perks in the game and at least half of them come from free/pseudo free characters. I knew the shrine was a trap roulette system when I started playing last year. It’s so much easier to just get the character instead and just grind them to 40 and leave them there for Dailies or random itching moments to break away from your main. 
---
TLDR: The shrine is filled with sub par perks and no one is surprised here.
---
Got a psn name you wanna share?
---
I once won a game by NOED against a toxic SWF group, Safe to say they were not happy
---
DS isn’t an anti-tunnel perk, it’s more or a “Delay the tunnel” perk. It won’t stop anything just delays how long the tunnel takes. If you hit the skillcheck and are not like me and miss it every time i need it xd
---
Freddy, Pig, leatherface, myers and ghostface(As well as their respective survivors)
---
The main objective is to escape alive. To that extend you have other objectives, with totems the one that you can ignore, but might end up with the killer having NOED. It's a risky play. Either you take the risk and rush  through gens, speeding up the trial, or you take time to make sure all totems are gone. It's perfectly balanced.
---
ive never understood why survivors fall for this "mindgame" since the spirit makes a special noise to all survivors when she is in ghost mode where as if u see a spirit standing still when u know they dont have an addon that removes the noise is useless to anyone with a brain
---
I played f13 for about 8 months. It was fun but the community is VERY toxic. And I mean VERY toxic. Jasons and counselors alike. I swear most people either don’t do anything, get you killed, or get on top of the roof to avoid Jason. It also doesn’t help that the developers gave up on the game. It honestly could’ve been a good game, but it ended up trashy in the end. 
---
DBD isn’t perfect but it’s better than f13. I still miss f13 sometimes though.
---
Where can i buy these
---
Ya chief imma be honest this wasn’t it, just say u like NOED as a perk because you need ur pity kill after being destroyed. It literally is a scummy perk and I didnt need it once to get to Rank 1, as I stated before IF IM GOING TO RUN A LATE GAME BUILD ill pull out blood warden or rancor. Not that I run it religiously like most noed users
---
Dead by daylights site. They just redid it and their merch tab is organized really well now
---
This happened to me too, this was back a few months ago, there were 5 gens left, one guy left and this piece of shit decided to hide the whole game. Not working on the objective, just hiding. I searched for around 40 minutes until I found the jackass in the basement in a locker. There were also no crows so this prick was being a dick just to be a dick. Felt so good when he disconnected when I caught him.
---
Nice!
---
Everyone is pissed that it doesn't include any of the 10 perks that they consider good.
---
Good.
---
Ignore everything else I say, cool. But saying ghostface is as good as plague and pig is practically saying hes bottom. He deserves to be as high as freddy and Myers.
---
Who doesn’t use adrenaline though? If it’s a sweaty try hard swf group then it’s going to be 3/4 or 4/4 with adrenaline
---
I thought I was the only one
---
It is a strategy, a really bad strategy. Any survivors with a brain will rush the gens and get an easy win.
---
Modded
---
I completely agree - as someone who plays both killer and survivor about 60/40. Cleanse the totems or risk NOED. "But totems aren't an objective!" - hell yes they are, and everyone who was hit by NOED would have to agree.
---
So next week, you want no mither, saboteur, territorial imperative and overwhelming presence? Got it!
---
Rank rest at rank 10 brings you to rank 16, my friend was rank 10 when the reset hit, I was rank 8 and got put in 15
---
Deviousness is easy to max with most killers that see play.
---
More likely to see beast of prey if it was a bit stronger or gave 100% bonus after the match.
---
Altruistic survivors who don’t know when to walk away (or at least run away and hit the totem then come back to the hook)
---
How do you know it lied? Mansion is in ruin, and she has the katana from someone. She probably already fulfilled her revenge part, but as any other angered spirit, doesn't stop with just person that violated her.
---
'Isn't that great anymore'
---
You either use two survivors time for 16 seconds or one survivor's time for 32 seconds. The time wasted is the same. The only difference is now you don't have to go hunt down other survivors and waste time being wounded
---
I get enough complaints when using overcharge+Pop.  Always wondered how bad/good it'd be to toss Ruin on just do an extra 'f your gen progress'
---
I don’t know how much I believe in that last part. I think it definitely depends on the player. But however I wouldn’t have that much of a problem with it if it didn’t bug out for me set me back twice today.
---
Wow, actually toxic
---
You much of been pissed off to make this post right?
---
How ?
---
Spirits are pretty much everywhere. Not surprising people have gone over to iron will. It's a good perk in general, but I suspect that's the real reason. Most spirits won't phase until they hear your groaning and moaning, and this makes it just as difficult to find you as if you were uninjured
---
just for everyones info, his PSN is CodyJalen
---
first of all, this was a huntress challenge
---
he got salty bc i was playing huntress and he was mad that i got a 4k and said i was “camping” 
---
all in all he was superrrrr salty calling me names blah blah blah and just kept messaging me, i was laughing up until this point
---
:(
---
That’s fair enough a strong gen pressure build is almost required especially with swf but noed on top of good gen pressure is straight up “f survivors fun”
---
bro. do i have to spel it out for you?      he-ll-a ga-y
---
I ignored everything else you said, because I can do nothing about you not seeing value in pig's dash, the fact that the traps are kinda luck based and whatever you said about the trapper.
---
it's just a rule in tier-list making that you don't put more than 2 per tier in higher tiers. the left one on each tier is the stronger of the two, and while I don't agree with Myers being better than Freddy, GF is still in the "slightly worse than freddy" place. 
---
you're arguing about moving him from D+ to C-...
---
BHVR, this is the seventh week in a row you've shown trash in the shrine
---
The lvl don't imply skill
---
Play solo and try to cleanse all totems, and actually make it out the exit gates. Half the time, your teammates die too fast, and the other half you never find the last totem
---
Ever stop to think maybe the survivors you’re disconnecting on also have limited time to play? Or are mid way through a challenge themselves?
---
Limited time or not, dc’ing on purpose is a dick move whether you’re a Survivor or a Killer.
---
Oh i just did lol, i’m preparing my Jane for the double BP weekend and saving up as many Bloody Party Streamers as possible!
---
Wait, survivors would think you'd guard haunted grounds with thrill? I KNOW it's devourer of hope if someone uses thrill, and do everything in my power to cleanse it, and the killer will always come running back, dropping a wounded chase to defend it. It's such a dead giveaway
---
Then ill tell him he is
---
I can sense the hate messages
---
I'm just waiting for BBQ and Bamboozle... WHY BHVIOR!?
---
The things that happen when /survivors complain about killers existing and premade /survivors are a thing.
---
No they have just done a pretty good job so far
---
So basically only 2 good perks
---
Dont you see what they have?! All purple AND an ebony Mori!
---
Well, Alrighty then but I didn’t dc for this challenge nor will I
---
I have 170 red 40 green and 80 yellow blood web is a bit broke
---
Something along “you’re so bad you need NOED” or something
---
? And? He may be a very bad player, or maybe he has returned after a long time
---
rank reset was recent
---
Omg kid learn how to play the game
---
That’s a violation of the rules though.

---
* Most crossposts are automatically removed, as they are typically unreleated to Dead by Daylight.
---
Lmao yup, And my excuse is that I’ve been playing for a month now
---
rank reset was today, and it could be someone returning after a break of two months or more
---
I mean, I've seen gg ez, but never 'haha shit survivors ez 4k' - I think you're intentionally blowing it out of proportion to make it seem worse than it is. For every 1 toxic killer, there's at least 30 toxic survivors(On account of there being more per turn, of course) - I play both sides plenty enough to know that what you're saying is just ridiculous
---
And those very same people are the ones that will rage quit or complain post-match anyways. So whenever someone says that, I just immediately think that they usually get shit on, and like to feel good about themselves for succeeding for once
---
Big oof. That brings a smile to my face haha
---
A lot of people spend their survivor bp to level killers up before playing them. It could also be someone who hasn’t played killer the past couple rank resets.
---
That’s incredible keep at it
---
And if it’s not? You’re punishing people who play the game normally - not that there’s anything wrong with adrenaline. Running a perk that is known for being very unfun to play against, a crutch and rewards failure just to counter a perk that they probably aren’t even running isn’t a very good idea.
---
Yeah it’s a fun game, But I’m kinda bad at it lol
---
It's ok that dudes obviously a pro virgin
---
No its a bomber with Minecraft TNT this is a shit joke for dbd
---
Yeah it gets easier when you learn everything
---
Still, I think they deranked on purpose. I figured if you haven't played in awhile youd be a bit rustier.
---
If you’re not happy with the new killer design I think you should contact the devs.
---
Ngl I’ve learned like a whole ton, Terms and what to do just I can’t do what I need to do if that makes sense lol. Like I can’t loop well but I know how to do it
---
Ah yes, let me hide as I run out of the basement against a camping nurse, or a spirit that was on her way back to hook, and I was downed pretty much two seconds after the unhook with literally no chance to escape
---
No, comparing DS to NOED is ridiculous. The times I get to use DS are the times the killer had to pretty much walk through someone to get to me. It's anti-tunneling, noed is just anti-fun
---
I recently reached devotion 3!
---
But I'm really disappointed it doesn't do anything..
---
You must play survivor if you think adrenaline is a perk that survivors “probably aren’t even running”. It’s everywhere, every game.
---
Discordance procs (lights up the gen in question in yellow and makes a visual/audible notification, like say if a survivor fast vaulted a pallet, failed a skillcheck, etc.) when two or more survivors are working on a generator at the same time. 
---
I'm waiting for it to appear on the shrine in order to put it on Freddy in particular, since a huge part of his power revolves around teleporting to generators. I want to be able to know who/how many/and when survivors are working on the generators at any time, so I can teleport to it and push them off. Discordance, Surveillance, BBQ+C, and PGTW will be amazing on him.
---
Well it pretty bad so I think I will
---
At least killer powers cause some of them to switch one or 2 perks for synergy. With survivors, it's always the same 4.
---
This is really cool, But kinda seems a little OP lol, A bit of tweaking and honestly this could be a killer
---
he's no pro: there's no BBQ perk! it's true he used high add-ons and offering, but i myself just use BBQ to hook everyone once but let them live. this keeps my rank at a steady 16 (or 15, i forget which), despite skill. its just funner to let everyone win and make more pnts
---
Glad I could help
---
A completely one sided match is no fun for either side. If gens are done in three minutes, the killer probably had a real shit time and survivors didn't really have a good time either.
---
Stop complaining and we might get a good one.
---
Jesus.
---
This is just the real shape of nea.
---
That’s definitely just rank reset
---
Lvl 50 with her doesn’t mean you’re a god. Because you can always gain blood points elsewhere and then level her up. It’s people like him/her is why sometimes this community really sucks.
---
Iron will is mandatory for Jane.
---
Noed guarantees solo survivors get hit by noed or the game ends before they can cleanse all totems because it takes too long to find them all, or you're looking for a totem that's already been cleansed. And if you get chased for 80% of the game, you have to rely on your teammates to cleanse them all(Never happens) - You have very little influence over this perk as a solo player, and regardless of whether it gets cleansed or not, it punishes way more than any other perk in the game
---
If it was really so easily counterable, noed would be trash, not top tier
---
OR MAYBE it's a killer that deranks to shit on new players? 
---
Actually no wait I forgot, only swf do that. Killer players are literal saints.
---
That wasnt me. I thought the mori was only an ivory or cypress
---
Thanks, I'm still learning all the abreveations
---
Oops, Sorry, I meant he/she* was
---
Well I didn't expect all purple perks and add ons with an EBONY mori
---
Not that I'm aware of? Would you elaborate on what you mean.
---
Probally a rage quit or they pulled their plug so they dont derank.
---
I had the same problem, the i open the fucker up and cleaned all the dust, now its quiet
---
They might be frustrated with the game going poorly.
---
I don't know how exactly it happens. 
---
I didn't even know it's a survivor vs survivor thing
---
Lolol I didn’t say it 🤷‍♂️😂
---
I would say that it would cost them the game but maybe I reckon it would more of a prevent a hook on a different person depending on what killer it is and what loop tiles and pallets are available. I run DS myself and understand how damaging it CAN be, but imo it doesnt entirely delay that much like you are saying unless its a basic bitch killer and not say a Nurse or others that can gain distance. Calling it an “anti” perk just doesnt fit imo.
---
thanks i will make edits probably i had fun making this
---
No One Escapes Death. All survivors suffer from the Exposed status effect once all generators are finished, but it will only be revealed once at least one survivor has been hit(It only takes one hit to down you, not two. The exception is borrowed time. It also only affects M1. Abilities are not influenced by the exposed status effect). It also gives a 2/3/4% movement speed boost(Which is nearly a 25% increase over the usual 15% extra you hvae on survivors).

Killers use it because it becomes tremendously easier to down survivors when they don't get the speedboost for a second chance at life. The only counter to it is cleansing all totems before end-game, or cleansing the totem once end-game has started, but you only know noed exists after a survivor has been hit in the end-game. Until then, it is hidden
---
The rank reset can only put you back as far as rank 17. Once you pass rank 17 you cant go back
---
Lmao store order the wrong door?
---
. You form bad habbits with self care. I always see players get hit right away, then waste a whole minute crouching to a corner. Heal. Get hit again. No generator gets done. I use empathy. I see everyone in corners not being productive wasting 5 minutes total on healing. Mainly finishing a self care just to go heal again. I swear. Players who run self care don't do anything if they're injured. They just waste time, and are deadweight for the  most part.
---
Come prepared, and you'll never have to heal.
---
yep, just spam space on a locker someone is already in, since you cant both fit in.  It's pretty funny to see, but can be super annoying on the recieving end
---
“You suck tunneler” but you ran round the corner into my face you dumb potato
---
Probally a smurf account to get easy game
---
Oh dang. I’ve got an xbox 1 but my gf I love with has ps4. I’ll make sure to get those on her ps4 so she doesn’t miss out on them. BBQ is a godsend for killers.
---
Nah. I went from rank 7 back to 13 this season. So if they took even a bit of a break it makes sense.
---
Seriously. That's one of dbds biggest problems. Hypocrisy
---
I‘m a rank 19 killer after not playing killer for a while
---
I don't think anyone really pays attention to cross anyway, and also, there's like, this second gate? 
---
You could also unlock self care to heal yourself or bring in a med kit of your own?
---
That's what I'm thinking. I'd understand maybe a couple ranks back, but all the way to rank 18? Too far imo
---
I should point out that disconnecting from a match results in two lost pips. Just an FYI.
---
To all y'all give me the side eye cuz I'm breakin dulls... You gonna thank me later.
---
BREAK EVERY TOTEM you see, if all 4 survivors did this noed never gonna be a problem.
---
Good advice getting downvoted. Smh.
---
Well I went from 12 to 16 as killer. And I dont have all purple perks and an ebony
---
oh that's what you're talking about. I was thinking you meant the bug that makes you have full control while being inside a locker like [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cppcvp/i_faced_a_killer_that_was_so_laggy_i_ended_up/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
It’s alway the journey that matters not the outcome
---
Hex: No One Escapes Death. When the generators are finished a dull totem becomes a Hex Totem and all survivors become exposed, so they go down in one hit. It also applies a speed boost to the killer as long as the Hex is up
---
it only takes about a month to get to Devotion 1
---
It’s a smurf. Most definitely.
---
Yeah, It’s a little tough on me lol!
---
I just decided that the survivor I see first is the one I get, turning it into a moral dilemma loses time. If I se the savior and the saved at once, savior takes precedence. If I follow the marks and reach the victim first, sorry buddy.
---
Id never seen that before, thats pretty funny too though haha
---
Tf you say, why you will want to buy an smurf in dbd?
---
Makes a lot of sense.
---
It takes a lot of time to get to tier 3 with tombstone, especially considering that tombstone is usually used with unlimited tier 3 add on.
---
By the time Michael is in tier 3, all gens are either done or almost done.
---
Tombstone reduces your movement speed.
---
Noed increases your movement speed.
---
So, Noed actually complements tombstone Myers really well, as it goes into to play when Michael needs speed boost the most. People keep forgetting that Noed is not just one shots, it's move speed as well, which helps even if you have insta downs as your ability.
---
I love the people on the comment taking this as a personal offense and saying "i paid for the game i can play however i want to"
---
Yes you can, but you're still an asshole 
---
It isn't ILLEGAL to Camp/tunnel/Farm friends/sandbag/teabag
---
But If you do this things, you're Just an asshole that most people wouldn't like to play with
---
Also consider they could have played heavily and then taken a long break from the game while still keeping all perks and items. Rank reset is a difficult time for sure haha
---
I love surveillance, PGTW is just icing on the cake
---
Bing Bong
---
What else is there
---
What! Damn. I feel I've played a lot. On console the wait time takes a long time. I waste more time finding lobbies then playing. I'm playing solo now, so I can see a month being possible.

Then noed isnt anyone's problem but yours too I guess.
---
Noed allows to instantly down survivors, adrenaline gives a free hit to endure if youre not healthy. So noed is a direct counter to adrenaline.

&gt;How are you watching 4 survivors benefit

Saw it couple times on videos/streams, 2-4 survs just pop healthy and killer has to chase them all over again to get a down.

I don't use it but I don't get all the hate for it. Sure it's a bit of a crutch but so are many survivor perks.
---
It's also good to point out that Bottany anulates sloppy butcher (one of the most commons killer perks)
---
Removed - Shaming other players
---
We do not tolerate this behaviour. First and last warning.
---
When you're constantly teabagged and bm'ed, you tend to want to hard camp these toxic survivors, not saying that TC was being toxic.
---
Nah, not zero. My whole SWF group runs DS, except me, and I still sometimes start as obsession.
---
I don't like DS nor BT, I use both Spine Chill and Bond. 
---
Adrenaline and Balanced landing are the only "second chances" I need and I use the other 2 perks for info gathering to be as efficient and productive as possible
---
I don't see a problem in using noed if survivors use adrenaline.
---
Indeed, makes a lot of sense. It does however seem extremely overkill on the surface
---
I’m like 99% sure we were in the same game LMFAO
---
Rank decay is a feature that more competitive games like LoL and cs:go use.
---
https://rankedboost.com/elo-decay-works-league-legends/
---
There’s not really a need for a rank reset in DbD, all it does is frustrate everyone.
---
Well he’s a good guy now so probably not
---
That problem with this is they have to distort Negan kinda like Wraith or else it’d be awkward. I’d definitely love to see it though.
---
First game showing my friend how to play as survivor we got lucky enough to face the spirit! I’d never faced her either as I had little survivor experience. Let’s just say it was over rather quickly
---
As a killer main its a bit sad to see red rank survivors not know what looping is make me wonder how they got to that rank even though rank does not matter in dbd
---
I fucking hate legion and I played legion and I fucking hate them even more.
---
If you really need it you can go unlock self care or just bring your own medkits.There is also a perk called plunders instinct that allows you to see chests and get better stuff from it.
---
 If a killer is at one gate go to the other one.
---
Crows aren’t used that often but you shouldn’t have to worry about it. I think you might want to upgrade that perk more.
---
Iron will works best when standing still you also might need to level this one up as well.
---
That's like complaining that Ruin does it's job at slowing down the game, and punishes solo players because they don't have 3 other eyes looking for it at once.
---
NOED is counter to adrenaline, but in the end even solo survivors can disable it. Even if the killer only gets one kill and it happens to be the solo survivor, they still lose and the survivor will most likely pip if they were playing the game properly.
---
It's like using ebony moris and using them immediately when possible. Sure, you kill the survivors quickly, but you don't pip, you don't get the satisfaction of a good game. You still lose.
---
Though in the end, you have to remember that it's a killer's job to hunt and slay the survivors using whatever means at their disposal. NOED is counterable, instead of a perk that makes endgame a slaughter. If someone uses NOED, or you think they use NOED, *try disabling many totems as possible*. You might not be able to get all of them, but getting as many as possible will make it easier on everyone else who is hunting for totems.
---
If survivors are constantly rushing to the endgame, why shouldn't killers take endgame perks if delaying doesn't seem to work?
---
I don't use adrenaline I use tenacity
---
It would kind of suck if someone got to a high rank and then didn’t have the opportunity to play for a while and then when they finally do they’re all the way back at rank 20 though
---
Yeah true but still the entity could reawaken the evil in his heart as if he were a majin lol
---
Lol, your whole PS4 flashes red!
---
They only labeled ghostface a chapter so Jason has his rightful spot as chapter 13 am I wrong probably but hey a guy can hope right?
---
It's alright I said it for you
---
They probably just play only survivor and level up their killers that way so now the have really good stuff at low rank.
---
Why not both? I like rank reset, gives me chance to change up my builds an do the whole non meta deal for a few ranks until back to the same old same builds over and over against the same 3 survivor skins all running the same 6 perks in different rotation.
---
Sounds like you're ranking up quite a bit
---
That’s not how it works, you have to not play for a solid 5 months before your rank disappears in csgo. You then get around the same rank back after you play a game.

Twice.
---
I played a match today where three of the four survivors would stop running in a chase and crouch in a corner. The scratch marks lead directly to them and they weren't hiding behind anything. Just crouching in a corner?
---
Only if he can be the one killer that talks like Ash does.
---
I just wanna here him talk shit in his Mori and after a hit or something.
---
Yes console. It’s the opposite here.
---
It must be different on console. Always super long waits here. But I agree.

No mither 2.0:

You start trial on a hook, affected by broken, exhausted and blindness for the rest of the trial.
---
\- Gain additional 2% to unhook yourself.
---
\- Gain 25% more bloodpoints in survival category.
---
Oh thanks I wanted to drop all pallets as soon as I see them, blow every gen and fast vault every window. I just thought I shouldn't play like that but you're right ma man.
---
You were supposed to blur out their names
---
I wanted to say something about the nurse being level 50, but I decided not to. I felt confident with what I said. If they were actually good with her, it would only defend my case. I had another game shortly after that where I lost my ruin right off the bat and then they were tea bagging me/circling around me, so I disconnected. I hate disconnecting, but I didn’t want to go through that again. :/ 
---
While it is very discouraging, I have kept playing and I’ve done decent! I’ve been able to get a 4K the last 3 matches, so I would say I’m improving. However, I’m still really bad at certain occasions. I have been messaging people telling them I’m practicing and they have been nice about it!
---
It does include DLC that you have to buy on steam. I'm not sure of the exact comparison but it's not fair to compare base game on steam to this on the eShop.
---
Ace In The Hole and Pharmacy is my fav because -most- of the add-ons for kits are good(looking at you, gloves and sponge).
---
And they proceed to get smashed cause they can't heal lol
---
why is it always hillbillys with that outfit
---
When you try to heal someone then they use an insta heal right in front of you
---
I can say that once I find a survivor, they have to do really well at losing me to survive. Other than that, I’ve been able to get someone down so long as I don’t give up the chase/target someone else.
---
Why are you lying? GG WP is an insult and it means Git Gut Werewolf Pussy 
---
A pussy so hairy it resembles a werewolf's face.
---
Dont believe me? Here is a proof! [https://imgur.com/l0DwSrK](https://imgur.com/l0DwSrK)   
---
So remember if someone writes GG WP it means that they are toxic players and be sure to report them for offensive language!
---
Quentin isn’t really work the 3 teachables May as well wait for a shrine with pharmacy
---
Bc killers have hard role to play that's why (keppo)
---
Furtive chase/Monitor and Abuse/Sloppy Butcher/Brutal strength it is for me.
---
Freddy his teleport can disorientate survivors so having perks which makes you harder to notice is good.
---
Sloppy because of the hit and run playstyle I have with Freddy and Brutal Strength because I will do a lot of gen kicking. 
---
But when I want bloodpoints bbq it is.
---
I agree you should be able to use it, but to be fair if that was how it worked the killer would most likely watch you struggle first anyway
---
Kinda stupid :/
---
pssst... hey guys
---
^(over here...)
---
^(little closer now)
---
Alright, now that the coast is clear I got a little secret to give to ya, it'd cost ya but since it's your first time this one's for free: **Iron Maiden and Botany Knowledge are pretty decent**
---
Now don't you go around tellin people that! Wouldn't wanna get found with that on ya, or even worse... **downvoted**
---
I Find pop not as useful since sometimes you can not use it because you hook multiple survivors in a short time or let them go while you can down them to kick a gen.
---
Bamboozle was on 2-3 weeks ago. I think you'll be waiting a while till it comes on again.
---
When killers complain about BT adrenaline DH balance landing self care sprint burst etc (XD)
---
Do you ever see perks released for the licensed characters that don’t come to the store for ps4 but show for Xbox 1 and pc?
---
Because the entity secures the last Hook as a kill, regardless of how many times the last survivor has been hooked. It’s seen as redundant as the killer would be staring into your soul when you Kobe and will smack you back down.
---
Is Dbd really a competitive game though?
---
CaMpInG iS RaRe though lol
---
Useless no one
---
Actually the illusions already spawn on Tier 2
---
user interface, the bug where your skill check and healing progress disappear for some reason
---
Wait can that be a thing? I haven’t found one yet. But I found a Purple Flashlight that has a Green battery and a Low amp filament
---
No, u/Troontoon is just nitpicking and biased, I win bye bye
---
i mean its basiclly a useless perk until endgame. especially when you are not the obsession. for a non obsession survivor in the trial its better if the killer has rancor instead of something like brutal strenght or whatever else might help in chases against him.
---
and yea im fun at parties
---
I pay attention to crows. Crows are servants of the entity and a great way to pinpoint the location of survivors that are on the move
---
He would 99 the hooks
---
Grow thicker skin ... if teabagging triggers you I think you have bigger issues to deal with
---
He would sabotasje hooks to 99%, then he will finish them when you are carrying a survivor and are about to hook them
---
Hiding in lockers or behind gens can block your aura for BBQ. He also struggles with windows, so use those to your advantage.  Jungle gyms especially can be good
---
Lots of killers go look for the hatch if they have time, so it could work.
---
Gotta that that +4% speed
---
This is a masterpiece
---
After coming back from the brink of death, the entity decides he would be an interesting one to see fighting for his life.
---
And thus, the "Carl the Cashier" DLC is born.
---
*pls BHVR we need Carl*
---
Imagine thinking all those perks are broken.
---
Deserved 1000%
---
Smurfs in DBD are players that purposefully derank to bully lower rank survivors. Of course it can just be a player returning but in all honesty, the addons and mori really just scream Smurf rather than "I returned to the game after a while".

Lol once my fiancé and I were playing, someone got hooked, he went back with an open gate and NOED ongoing to unhook them, got out safely, dude fucked up his escape and got hooked again;

"I did, you did xyz and got yourself hooked again"

Some people even those who are legitimately good in a game don't feel good at the game or their accomplishments unless they rub it in or put someone else down.
---
Advice don't let ingame toxicity bother you just move on to the next one you'll often forget them soon enough. Easier said then done in some cases but on PS4 set your messages to friends only to avoid these kinds of messages.
---
I’m not gonna lie I’m gonna get hate but I’m not too into stranger things I’d rather we get another original character or pinhead
---
The gen 1 is a new 1 tip I haven't tried.
---
My Xbox overheats sometimes because of this lol
---
Cleanse totems.
---
I don't want a ST chapter either. You're not alone. It just doesn't seem to fit the game.
---
I took a long break from the game.I was rank 3 at my highest.Thats how i know how to 360
---
I wouldnt say that. Its really only useful when you escape a chase and are trying to hide. It doesnt have much use otherwise.
---
that still makes no sense. If this game had real MMR and rank based off skill, then a player coming back after some time would simply drop to their true rank just by their performance and playing. 
---
Resetting serves no purpose other than to shake out people who got boosted to a rank they don't really belong at, which is easy in DBD because it's ranking is not based on skill at all and why towards the end of the month before rank reset, you find a lot of bad players in Red ranks who don't deserve being there. You can game your way to the top by simply playing and doesn't matter if you're bad or good... and even easier to do it with SWFs.
---
I would Play with you. Search for me on steam: Demmou. If you dont mind me being from germany
---
He would be able to have a better power if it had some more restrictions.
---
Leatherface is rewarded for hitting terrain with a 'tantrum' that also one-hit downs, it removes a lot of skillful plays like one sees against Hillbilly (locker juking, evading in front of a rock).
---
Leatherface has more control at short ranges, but still moves faster than a survivor while chainsawing, meaning that the wide AOE is hard to avoid when caught in the open. Unlike Hillbilly, he can usually catch someone changing direction and cutting across to the left or right.
---
Leatherface can hit multiple survivors, multiple times, completely invalidating bodyblocking and perks such as Borrowed Time. Unlike Hillbilly, he doesn't stop at a single target.
---
Ideally Leatherface would be changed in at least a few of the following ways:
---
1: His power can only hit one survivor one time. It can hit any survivor in the area, but not all of the survivors, and it will not down someone through Borrowed Time or Mettle of Man by two-hitting them.
---
2: His Tantrum will be able to hit multiple survivors, but not any survivor hit by the original chainsaw. It will injure survivors if they are not injured already, and will hit injured survivors protected by Borrowed Time or Mettle of Man, but will not down survivors. It will have its range tweaked so that Head On will be able to stun him without the user being hit.
---
3: Leatherface will get a move speed buff during his chainsaw, so that a survivor who has recovered Sprint Burst to 99% will not evade it just by running in a straight line. In turn his ability to turn while chainsawing will be lowered. (Probably something like move at 6.5 m/s for the duration of the sprint compared to Sprint Burst moving at 6 m/s, but have a more limited degree of turning, like 30-45 degrees, letting a survivor evade left or right, but strengthening Leatherface at straighter loops).
---
4: **Leatherface gets a secondary power or effect.**
---
I'm not entirely sure what his secondary power/effect should be, but a chainsaw is too much like Hillbilly after all, and some of the above suggestions are intended to make him Hillbilly-light.
---
I suspect that his secondary power should be something about hooking unique survivors in a similar fashion as BBQ\&amp;C; giving him unique buffs as the game goes on, I had some thoughts.
---
A: Leatherface gets increased move speed when moving towards generators based on hook tokens. He cannot earn tokens from the same survivor multiple times in a row. (May need a clause to prevent Leatherface from slug-camping, something about being put in the dying state before he hooks another survivor doesn't count when he hooks you either). This helps Leatherface actually apply pressure across the map, but it should have a clause that it doesn't apply when he is in a chase (otherwise it gets super broken).
---
B: Leatherface gets one token per hook broken through sacrifice, or two tokens for basement sacrifices. These tokens either increase the speed he moves while chainsawing, or increase the effectiveness of his aura reading (duration, distances? Such as lowering the distance limit of BBQ&amp;C or increasing the duration).
---
**C: Something about hooks. It would be interesting if Leatherface could empower certain hooks and if his kit interacted with sabotage in some fashion. Though I'm not sure what sort of power could be placed here that wouldn't promote tunneling; it'd be interesting if hooks applied effects to survivors at random, or perhaps Leatherface could have them self-sabotage after someone was unhooked for unique benefits, as long as he didn't down the survivor who was unhooked, or even get some form of aura reading from certain empty hooks if survivors were nearby.**
---
Adrenaline is countered by killing them before Endgame, so the way I see it a lot of people in these comments are just bad.
---
Definetely. Legion as a survivor is a mild nuisance
---
Ya stranger things doesnt fit in with every other license they've had in my opinion
---
You think that's scary?
---
Those tentacles can spray ink inside me all day, mmm.
---
There's an unfortunate amount that get boosted to red ranks by simply playing SWF with lower ranked survivors.
---
Damn y'all suck can't beat noed even swf
---
Lmao BM in gaming community means bad manners and did not come from the BM that means bowel movement. Never heard of anyone thinking of it this way
---
slightly increase map offering?
---
The totem looks amazing, but I like the legions mask more. I also like the blood points you made. Amazing job you did
---
No ones forcing you to like it, don't worry lol but I definitely agree I'd much rather Pinhead over stranger things. I really dislike how DBD just go crazy every now and then and release a ton of licensed killers. I'd prefer one licensed killer every year.
---
I’m like lvl 18 with a prestige 3 level 50 hag does that make me not a rank 18 because I just repicked the game??
---
sometimes there 2 shack
---
I agree with you. That being said, I'm fond of running Sloppy Butcher as killer to further take advantage of that mindset and waste even more of their time.
---
the first time i used noed i got addicted and now i cant take it off. all of the salty hate messages are just to good.
---
Well, you could see totems as a secondary objective for surviors. I mean if every totem is cleansed you don't have to deal with the bullshitery that is NOED at the end of the game. 
---
But I agree that NOED should no reward killers for losing.
---
Copied a comment I made a while back to paste here, WGLF really needs some love :(
---
If WGLF is gonna have an extra effect, it needs to be in the same vibe as the perk, something altruistic or supportive that encourages saving team mates, some ideas I had are
---
•	⁠stackable heal speed (only applies to the target you unhook for ___ seconds) 1 unhook is 35%, two is 70%, 3 is 100%, and at 4+ you can instantly heal the survivor you unhook
---
•	⁠a less interesting one would be seeing the aura of the survivor you unhook for 30 seconds
---
•	⁠any damage applied to the survivor for 15 seconds after being unhooked applies to you instead (potentially would pair great with borrowed time?)
---
-WGLF lets you see the aura of the killer for 4 seconds after unhook (basically it’s just bbq for survivors now)
---
•	⁠for every unhook you gain plus 10% healing speed for the rest of the match, stacks up to 50%
---
Edit: also take away the 100% cap for purple rank! You can only get a max of 6 unhooks per match (150%), and if you get all 6 unhooks then god damn you deserve the bloodpoints. Also it’s not like survivors take a ton of protection hits.
---
Dead Hard and Self-Care aren't real problems.
---
Sprint Burst wouldn't be bad if not for the huge number of safe pallets scattered across most maps, since you can get yourself into a bad position and get out of it once every 40 seconds. It's not really frustrating otherwise.
---
Not like Lithe and Balanced Landing on broken building loops, that's for sure.
---
Borrowed Time only works when it shouldn't - since I don't camp outside of a gate being open, Borrowed Time only procs when a survivor leads me back to the hook. This is punishing the killer for a survivor mistake, and is incredibly frustrating. (Of course it should work during the EGC, naturally).
---
It also doesn't work when it SHOULD, an Insidious Leatherface or a cloaked Wraith don't trigger Borrowed Time, but they *should*, fuck it. **Borrowed Time should proc because Wraith is facecamping even if he's fucking cloaked, for real.**
---
Adrenaline is only annoying because all of the poor balance between chase time and generator time, it completely stomps M1 killers who don't have mobility deep into the ground and basically functions as a free chase escape/heal against killers (not the player, the actual killer, such as Wraith) who can't defend the generators effectively due to time spent transitioning between them.
---
But Nurse or Hillbilly will just catch back up and stomp the Adrenaline user back into the ground, because they're faster than someone using Adrenaline, so Adrenaline is powerful in all the wrong places.
---
Fuckin David Hughes, dunno whether he is the worst or one of the best Australian comedians
---
Not if you force quit the entire game
---
If you still have 3-4 survivors alive by end game (unless you’re running an end-game build) then adrenaline isn’t the issue
---
Wtf is this clip? You got a link? xD
---
What website did you copy this from?
---
Theres nothing else to do once you get rank 1, i just switch to bbq and distressing then farm bp win or lose idc. You probably wouldnt find this game fun if you expected to win everytime, even the best killers out there dont win everytime.
---
If you really hate DS then unnerving presence counters it pretty well. I have no problem with the new version though, I think it's great.
---
Dude the second a survivor gets a strong perk before the PTB is even out we get complaints from Killers welcome this reddit.
---
Upvote for the inclusion of the middle verse.
---
Huh. Didn't know that!
---
You should check older videos. 
---
In Hillbilly preview video we can see crows following Meg, and the game wasn't released back then.
---
I think that as long as survs use purple flashlights with odd bulbs and insta heals it's ok for us killer to use op addons.
---
So the alternative is having to mash the button for literally no reason?
---
People dont go afk when you are downed on the ground, there is no reason to think that they'd go afk when on hook. Do you see them going afk during the first stage?
---
Yeah those people frustrate me. :/ They are immature in the sense that they need to make themselves feel better than others to have satisfaction. 
---
I made the post to exemplify the point that just because you’re good at the game, doesn’t mean you need to bully other people. 
---
I usually brush it off, but this probably had to be the second worse game that I’ve had with a group. I used to have my messages off, but I changed it because I wouldn’t get invites from clan members for destiny 🤷‍♂️ Hopefully this won’t happen again.
---
Maybe, i saw it in the lore ages ago but i haven't checked recently
---
&gt; controls on keyboard are much easier than controller
---
Not entirely correct. The controller vs mouse issue is largely due to controller sensitivity seemingly having a harder cap that that on the mouse - and that affects PC as well as console.
---
Outside of that, there's possibly an argument for Huntress having a harder time on controller due to accuracy issues (thumbstick doesn't beat a mouse for accuracy) but most of the other killers aren't negatively affected *outside of the sensitivity cap that happens across all platforms*.
---
I like this!!!!
---
Just give me Pharmacy please
---
As I recall, it's not that they "hear it", it's that the TR becomes map-wide. Should work with any TR-based perk - it's been tested with Coulrophobia and works fine there.
---
I generally play good killers like spirit, nurse or hag not because I suck at the game but because if I try to play anything else or learn I constantly get spammed with "GG EZZ" "NOOB KILLER" people clicking flashlights and teabags.
---
 It's like you guys have no self awareness
---
I dont think that they can touch the game anyway since they are in court I think.
---
&gt;why are the characters so bloody expensive?
---
Wait for a sale and buy the chapters- don't buy individual characters for money, the chapters give you 2 characters at once.

---
Imagine we need memes to tell other human beings to not be a dick to eachother.
---
Still the time it takes to make 150k is not worth 2000 shards
---
Absolutely, given the new season there’s potential for a big retro 80’s mall as a map
---
I’d love it if people wasted two perk slots against me too, talking about self care and MoM of course
---
\[Real!\]
---
Not sure where you go this info, but it's either outdated or incorrect.
---
Legion as a character is just a big dumpster fire, it’s really obvious they rushed the character(s) out to meet a deadline.
---
The first perk seems a lot like spies from the shadows. She also seems to have a lot of abilities but seems solid :)
---
I’m a fan of Ghostface’s really “I’m so done with this shit* sigh
---
Bless 💕
---
Jason dressed up as Roy from part 5, but with the normal jason mask AND hair? I’m disappointed.
---
Mettle of man is more like a "you never see it" perk nowadays. It's completely useless. Decisive is a good anti tunnelling perk but not much more, often a dead perk if the killer is good. Also self care sucks, gotta love survivors wasting 40 seconds instead of doing gens.
---
Anyway, you're probably right for red ranks, but in the world of green/yellow solo queue ranks, survivors are not that meta at all. I can't count the number of times I've done the last gen hoping to proc the adrenaline of the Meg being chased only to see her still injured with mister NOED closing in on her.
---
I fully levelled up a couple killers' perks before I first started playing killer. It's not as common to see, but not impossible.
---
Everyone wants Ash to snuggle next to them.
---
Insta heals and flashlights don't change the foundation of the game or how it's played.
---
With prayer beads, there's no hide and seek. There is no chase. There are no mind games. There is no game sense. And most importantly, there is no skill. All associated chase/stealth perks (on both killer and survivor) are thrown out the window and will not come into play. The game boils down to whether or not the survivors have spine chill or premonition. 
---
If they don't, they either gen tap, causing gen progression to be near non-existent (and still take an unavoidable hit), or they stay on the gen and pray that she doesn't come to it. That's it.
---
they absolutely dumpstered legion which is a damn shame
---
Not really the same as Noed then is it?
---
Purple/Crimson addons and Mori time.
---
I assume this was BEFORE you could close hatch? Because if not, I hope you now know you can close the hatch and it will always open when only 1 survivor remains and if you close it it triggers like a 2 or 3 minute timer for them to get out.
---
Game design has nothing to do with it, unless you're stating that swf inherently imbalances the game in the survivors favor. But since you arent saying that, I dont know what you mean.
---
It's a lobby, nothing to do with the game. Dcing in game is bad, but a lobby... is a lobby, its not the game. So if you want to dodge, its within your right to do so? You cant force people to stay in lobbies lol
---
Firstly, equating survivor DC and killer DC is wrong. Killers have no one relying on them, is it scummy and a rage quit, yes. But it is nowhere near as bad as a survivor who has teammates. 
---
What if the killer doesnt like the pings and decides to dodge, should we force the killer to stay? I swear, entitled survivors give us all a bad reputation. The killer doesnt owe you shit, now go wait in queue if you want to abuse swf.
---
yea i wanted a perk were she could she through the crows from any where but cant be there bu that would be  to strong
---
I think it’s because of the Fire Sparks in the background. I always think, in ads, they say it’s the “NEXT GENERATION OF CONSOLES!” Meanwhile: Fan dies due to the fact there’s sparks on screen.
---
Feeling alright there?
---
Can relate but with the tables turned
---
Nah vro I'm tryna hear all that nomsayin
---
?
---
Solo survivors also get instant lobbies on ps4 btw.
---
&gt;cries in legion&lt;
---
How about all perks stop being broken and just all become situational and equal (in means of usability and power), same for survivors' and killers' perks, so gameplay wouldn't be determined by perks, but more with powers and items, then perks will only enhance your chosen gameplay and make it better, rather then playing around them.
---
No a P3 character shouldn't be possible at level 20. Even if you got the other perks from the shrine.
---
I got this for atleast 3 Killers and I'm a survivor main. My Killer rank mus br around 19 to 18 right now.
---
Yup, https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UzG9Qb1hTR8
---
The Bloodweb is made of grinding, and it feels like a good match will only get me one level on one character Is there any particular way/setup to obtain bloodpoints?
---
Billy was a tortured soul but not by the entity
---
Yes i p3'd before i took the break
---
If there's 2 hooked, it's pretty damn ez to unhook one guy.
---
Even if you die it's so easy to snowball back due to 1 for 1's and insta healthstates off hook with adrenaline or BT/ DS/ Unbreakable.
---
Go for it, you'll be fine.
---
&gt; So true I feel dbd should accept its better to live than die saving someone who’s bound to die anyway
---
OP's post, unless they're all in basement, is very easy to bounce back from unless the killer sees you and you weren't camping the exit gate like someone who is brand new to the game
---
I havent playey for a while and I deranked to rank 19 with my killer. I still got full loadout spirit with anal beads and ebony mori if I wanted to. Doesnt make me better tho. ( i really suck at killer) I didnt derank on purpose  so there is that.
---
Twice in 156+ weeks so it's like a 1.2% chance of it showing up

---
No one thinks NOED is OP, it's just super boring to play against. No one wants to hold m1 on some bones to counter something that the killer may not even be running.
---
Or just bring adrenaline, don't heal, and rush gens. 
---
Self care kills whole teams. Either bring a med kit or don't heal at all.

I'd like PGTW or Haunted Grounds tbh

---
That's a build I'm gonna use when I get the perks. Better yet, let's make it a Doc.
---
I expect all Nurses on console to run NOED because they always get bullied all game then want to get a pity kill. They tunnel people hard so it’s pretty easy to do all gens and find all the totems
---
I used to have the Astro A20 (~$120 I think) which sounded really nice, but I went through 5 pairs of them in a year. Buy some sort of protection plan if you go with them.
---
I mean at least you can use Hillbilly's power for insane mobility. You can't achieve that with Leatherface unless using certain add-ons which should be a massive no no when it comes to balancing
---
They DO realise that you were playing with 3 (maybe even less if you had Blood Warden) perks then, right?... God survivors are toxic. They don't assume bad Internet, either. They assume lag switches. They're the ones who stuck in my lobby even though they all had yellow ping!

---
Console Nurse is hell. The panic NOED sends is fun.
---
The only change that should be reverted is the 4 seconds stun. The rest is good.
---
Honestly nothing you say changes my opinion. Sorry I hit a sore spot.
---
Lmao
---
Yeah there should be one, but the devs haven't made one, is saving survivors not a objective because there isnt a counter on how many times a survivor can be saved, no there isnt.
---
I get the feeling man
---
Nah seriously, that was you?
---
Why u do me like that, tho?
---
That would be great! I was planning on getting back into streaming here soon! Hit me up at twitch and YouTube.
---
T- sergeantatams
---
Y- sargepepper88
---
No thanks
---
Enough with the shitty dbd streamers
---
Also, everyone plays the game to have fun. The two sides of fun is 'we all escape before the killer gets a hook because hahaha flashlights and toolboxes' OR the killer runs what they want for their entertainment. Which, for me, is NOED, Overcharge (would swap for PGTW), Surveillance (would swap for the legion perk where if 2 survs are working on the same gen it gets highlighted) and Thanatophobia.
---
It just happens to be that's how I have fun. Also stupidly long jigsaw boxes with skill checks every two seconds.
---
Pretty sure Hitler killer himself
---
Yup. Also its a game, people wanna have fun whatever way they can.
---
"gameplay"
---
Advertises shitty stream
---
Playing the game and using your tools is never toxic, either side of the game. We need to promote positivity and support being the best role you can- even if it's a quick kill or a VERY long game of hide and seek.
---
It does, but all obsession perks have this effect, I'll quote: "Increases your chances of being the Obsession."
---
True, but can you imagine this community if they would delay a new killer?
---
I wouldn't say overnerfed as much as his/her design just doesn't work well before or after the changes. I honestly think that a Freddy style rework is needed to improve/balance them.
---
We need to get more Jakes in the game
---
I think the length of queue times is based on your region. I have had both sides fluctuate and I am on PS4, recently I had a wait time of 10 minutes for a killer game. Due to this I don't think punishing killers for lobby dodging would work because you will just reduce the amount of games in the pool for survivors to join. 
---
I am also interested to know if you play killer at all, and I mean actually play killer not just dabble now and then or play against low easy ranks? This isn't a dig btw. I used to get annoyed too when I played with my friend and the lobbies would be constantly dodged but having played a hell of a lot more killer I completely understand it. Killer is way more stressful as your on your own and even though SWF is fun I can admit it breaks the fundamentals of the game and completely swings the balance in the survivors favor. SWF games are always nightmares and if its a 3+ SWF team their is a strong chance it will be a toxic cesspool of a game that makes the killer want to just turn off their machine and go run outside.
---
It's fixed I reset my game and it's back to normal
---
While that's what I thought how they balanced it out, we still haven't had a survivor in a very long time, and survivors are just reskins anyway so I'm sure it wouldn't be that hard, along with the fact this is a very big license so they'd put a lot more work into it then usual. The two characters they followed are also very connected and go perfectly together if they choose to add them. 
---
Ash also didn't get much cosmetics being a licensed character, so maybe they were able to spend more time on the new survivors as well. Regardless, I think they were either leading towards getting both or following both hinting that it's one of them.
---
Yes I play killer.
---
I DC'ed against a Ghostface cause I had that glitch where you can't escape, can't recover, can't wiggle, use self-care or dead hard, and I was being taken halfway across the map to the basement, I mean, I thought this glitch was supposed to be fixed but I get it way too often now.
---
I love to see people getting downed at the exit
---
For killer, the perk BBQ and Chili will get you more bloodpoints. There are others for killer, but this is easily the best. Doctor is also a good bloodpoint generator.
---
Survivors can use the perk We're Gonna Live Forever for bloodpoint multipliers.
---
Wot
---
What really? I thought they made like a safe zone for newer players that you cant go back to
---
Eh just take the L and move on man. It's easy to get that pip back anyway.
---
It’s basically just stomping lobbies until you hit rank 1 again
---
I would love to see you do it consistently. I can count on two hands how many times I've seen all 5 totems get cleansed and if you wanna talk all 5 cleansed SOLO I can count on one hand.
---
If you're consistently cleansing all 5 totems and getting all 5 gens done your killer is braindead. I play with 2 friends pretty often that both have 1k+ hours played and out of probably 75 games in the last week I can remember 3 games we got all 5 totems cleansed and gates powered.
---
How long to scratch marks stay visible for without the aid of any perks?
---
I do it to flex on everyone. I think having bloody clothes is better than buying something from the store. It says that you have skill even if you don't... ;-;
---
Rank 10 to 20 is still baby’s just green ranks are learning to use moris
---
What i said^
---
Clearly even if u don't. Noticed too many prestige players who are dead weight. Some actually do have skill.
---
I feel so blessed that hag was my first main by pure chance.
---
I mean you are kind of right but what worries me about this is the low ranks getting face campes and probably struggling to rank up but i mean i dont think there is much we could do about it i just wanted to read other users thoughts on this
---
Or they aren't aware that I'm doing totems due to a lack of knowledge on the matter, such as their only Hex being NOED? And I do them my self, so 3 people are working on gens.
---
Facecamping works when the survivors all stand near the hook to try and get the save, as you said, rush the gens and it's an easy win. 
---
I disagree when you say only bad survivors complain about facecamping though. Yes, it'll encourage the killer to do so but Facecamping is pretty toxic and stressful regardless and is pretty reasonable people getting mad at. What about the person who got facecamped? Still pretty unfair for them.
---
I looks real cool.
---
Kinda makes him look like the grim reaper tbh.
---
Still not worth a perk slot at high ranks

I have my messages on because often when toxic shits message you if you stay calm and civil in your replies they can't resist saying something disgusting and then I report them to Sony. Sony don't mess about and will ban them, I know this is true as I have had it happen to me once when I was having a bad day and I regrettably snapped at someone. The best thing is the ban not only means they can't play any games online but as well if they have downloaded any games free via ps plus they can't use them. You also can't access you library to download games and any online feature of any game is disabled.
---
Not if it happens back 2 back ×3
---
Contrary to most, I find this Shrine great. I love Botany, and Iron Maiden is going straight on my Huntress. Can someone explain what Bloodhound does?
---
Yup. Not on PS4 but damn my xbox gets loud when I boot this or Holloe Knight.
---
Problem is I'm not getting those 2 perks in literally ages. I have like 50 hours under my belt but still I'm unable to get either.
---
I’m still waiting for pinhead 🤞🏻
---
They’re working on a stranger things mobile game and said that there will be content releases to existing games later down the road, but this was announced after the roadmap for this year was created and released. I don’t think they’re going to change the existing roadmap plans. Maybe it’ll happen in the future, but I don’t think it is going to be the next update.
---
Yet you don't have empathy towards why a killer would dodge a 3-4 man SWF? I mean even the streamers who play day in day out and some claim are best in the game will get antsy about a potential 4-man SWF because no killer enjoys it and it is way more stressful to play. It is pretty much a consensus opinion that it breaks the game and almost flips the power role to survivors.
---
8% is also too high, killer are already faster by themselves.
---
Wait, why would the bloodpoints cause facecamping? The bonus applies to the hunter category which is the chasing category.
---
If you're gonna tunnel you might as well have face camped to secure the precious K.
---
Winning is objective in DBD, though.
---
I actually would try to bait the killer into basement hooking me when I ran deliverance to buy more time for my randoms, I ended up getting first hooked occasionally which completely kills the perk
---
Thanks for the insight! I'm level 40, so I guess I'm not a complete noob but very noob still. I do love the spine chill perk!
---
money don't by everything.
---
In some game you can be banned by not playing accordingly to rules that aren't written anywhere.
---
Specially in Moba.
---
I love when people think they've trapped me but I'm just running head on lol
---
Didn't knew that was a choice. Thanks!
---
Well not facecamping, but a killer could abuse the perk by repeatedly picking up and dropping the survivor. Then when another survivor comes by, free blood points. Also most killers have decent movement speed so the 8% seems kinda op on some killers
---
Boy howdy do I love me some sweaty tryhard nurses my first day back bc I happened upon reset.
---
We got Mad grit earlier too.
---
Ruin also slows down the game and you have to find the totem but i don't see anyone complaining about it.
---
not really
---
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean.
---
People don’t like SWF because they’re more coordinated and less bot like. My philosophy is to get better at the game and not make excuses.
---
Again, it’s an advertised feature of the game. If it’s as broken as you say it is, then that’s something the devs need to address.
---
Steelseries Arctis 5. In your price range. My brother uses them on his PS4 and seem to work perfectly.
---
That’s how I felt watching two baby dweets and a Claudette Hide in lockers while I got face camped by a Freddy yesterday. It was pretty clear that I was the only one who had actually played the game for awhile, but as a no-mother David, I glitched a dead hard (perfect game!) and got downed.
---
The Claudette at least got out of the locker and made an attempt to get closer. The two baby dweets were on opposite sides of the map and didn’t come out of the locker until I was halfway through struggle. 
---
I kept myself alive on the hook as long as possible hoping that they’d get the courage to gens, but they didn’t.
---
Normally I spectate the rest of the game but I had to just bail, it was too hard to watch. As soon as they would hear the faintest heartbeat they’d dive in a locker and not come out for several minutes after it was gone.
---
Honestly they have to rework addons for suvivors items. While a quite part of addons literally aren't worth the slot ("easy skillcheck" addons, please begone from my bloodweb), some of them like that abomination dressing are actually bad to equip.
---
All of that makes **Ace in the Hole** perk really much less fun to use.
---
Also, the cursed green key. Just build aura reading into it and make it so it stacks with aura reading addons/Bond at half rate. That would make the thing at least somehow useful.
---
So I can get more than one kill a game with trapper
---
Basically the fact that the perk last so long means that the killer can just quickly search areas for more survivors, get in a short chase with them, pick up the downed survivor again, and rinse and repeat. The fact that it grants more blood points for following survivors while giving them a speed buff is kind of op
---
You can get a purple insta heal yeah, I get these pretty frequently when running plunderes, ace in the hole and pharamacy
---
What's wrong with swf?
---
There are two reasons why people dislike tunneling.
---
1) If you're trying to rank up, you get completely screwed out of two categories (Altruism and Objective) with a third one being a crapshoot (Survival). It also makes it impossible to do Dailies such as "Repair generators", "Sabotage Hooks", and so on.
---
2) Probably the more egregious of the two, it's boring. Three survivors are forced to sit at generators and M1 the entire match, and the last isn't allowed to do anything else than loop. The game becomes less "Oh shit, here comes the Killer" and more "Oh great, this again".
---
What is a list of solid perks for use with Huntress?
---
He doesnt, if he did, why would he state his teammate was using up the ante?
---
No it actually means play how you want unless you’re doing things I don’t like. Had a guy tell me I shouldn’t be running any perks on Myers yesterday
---
It does not, only thing luck affects is kobeing off the hook and getting out trappers' traps.
---
What are you showing us
---
Ok. I meant like I’d pick one after the other but still get others
---
Nothing
---
oh boy this reminded me of the old nurse's lunge
---
imagine this shit
---
after blink she had a longer lunge than EW3 Myers that had a 360 degrees lock-on on the closest survivor
---
Ah, ye makes sense. 
---
Also, Perks on Myers? Thats like next Level toxic
---
Luck. Doesnt. Affect. Chests.
---
So you'd prefer if the bonus was removed then?
---
You are not very smart, are you?
---
well the killer will probably not pip as well so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ it's not like pips count or anything too
---
Not at all m8. Remember, all you have to do one survivor is max out one character and get everyone else’s teachables, because survivors don’t have unique abilities. You have to max out Every single killer you want to use so you need a tone more blood points.
---
Oh the camera is super close to the killer, like if I had Michael In you’d only be able to see up to his waste. I’ll post the survivor one where it’s like 20 ft back
---
Your edit doesn't really solve the issue, though, since now it's a perk that heavily incentivizes Slugging. Down them, pick them up, drop them, go run out to find another Survivor to repeat the process. You don't have to hook until they're all on the ground.
---
No it’s just the perk in general is a easy farming perk and is kind of over powered
---
Soooo truuuueeeee aswell
---
Would have been great if not for the "Daaaamn" part at the end. Comedy homicide right there.
---
Could it be like Devour hope that gives a speed boost after hook?
---
Do you have an instagram?
---
\*Way more powerful, not ''OP"
---
Idea may be, if you drop the survivor after X seconds and are in a chase with another survivor
---
it used to, but doesn't anymore
---
only missed
---
it's not worth a damn
---
Ok I understand. Might want to explain in the title though. Kind of confusing with no explanation :|
---
Agreed. XBox here, I haven't had any issues with frames, graphics and especially not with the cursor speed in menus. If anything it's almost too fast at times and more difficult to control with precision.
---
image with this exact text was posted here already
---
&gt;ruin.....i don't see anyone complaining about it
---
bruh. 
---
Are you serious? It's the **most** complained about thing in this game.
---
Oh... oops
---
Where did rank 20 go...
---
True but it wasn't like an 'annoyed getting a kill face camp' more of a build to hide near the hook with insidious to catch other survivors out
---
They created and released the roadmap for this year before the announcement that they were working alongside Netflix. The wording said that there will be upcoming content releases in existing games from Roblox, Ubisoft, and Behaviour, but these will be later on, closer to the mobile game release. I don’t think it’s going to be the next chapter, just because people are following actors in one of the most popular media right now lol
---
Just use one of the five million gray medkits you probably have with Botany, now you can have two full heals on a gray medkit so long as you put addons on it
---
Oh. So I've been using distressing on trapper for no reason then
---
Congrats! Your prize: Sadness because he isn't in the game!
---
Is it really outlandish that people are following famous actors from an insanely popular property because they like it and not as some subliminal messaging?
---
Noed should activate during endgame collapse.
---
i played against a rank 4 myers the other day with the exact same addons and we did all 5 gens and escaped before he got tier 3, he didnt even get a hook
---
I had the same problem, with some frame lag. I turned off/on the play and improved the performance. Sometimes ps4 has some problem.
---
Maybe make it a little bigger than a EW1 lunge, like a boyfriend's memo lunge or something like that
---
But their ability is completely counterintuitive to the killer’s objective. Most legions don’t even use it outside of mobility, and it’s not even that good for that. I think people mainly play them for dailies anymore.
---
Jeff is the loudest male and Jane is the loudest female I think. Otz made a video about it if you really wanna know how loud everyone is.
---
They could be but atm it’s a waste of one our two perk slots to maybe get one heal out of it
---
I know your pain
---
is there a tyler1 of the dbd community or something?
---
Buckle Up Buttercup!
---
What have yobrought upon this cursed land?
---
Well, I'd love ANY sort of nerf to her lunge as the normal killer lunge is meant to steal a hit in a tight situation.
---
I'm always curious as to what that sort of person is trying to achieve. I mean how plain griefing can be fun in the game that has no chat during the action phase? Unless you are griefing somebody you know, what's the point?
---
I'm not griefing myself, just sincerely trying to understand what's going on inside some people's heads
---
As long as it works both ways sure 👍🏻
---
Yeah, i know it's not the greatest perk, and i've seen a lot of memes about Neas urban evading around the map and being useless. I will stop using it the moment i can get my hands on some better teachables.
---
I want it so bad. I really hope we get Steve as the survivor or barb. I know Steve hasn’t died and he hasn’t left the show so it wound be harder but it’s my wish
---
Same, I have the white Stanford one
---
A good alternative would be a slow QTE with some buttons.
---
I never said that mashing buttons was a good idea. Thinking outside of the box helps
---
Michael stalked him and instadowned the guy on his team named Hitler with EW3.
---
To be honest, i dont see how people can call noed overpowered, i play both killer and survivor at rank1 and i more or less never see noed, killers simply cant afford to run a perk thats only active late game. So if the top players in the game doesnt even think its worth to run, how can it be op.
---
I’ll be a hundred percent happier with if it told you there’s noed. I don’t know why someone has to be the test dummy to see if there’s a exposed effect
---
Believe whatever you want to believe, but I’m just saying that stuff like this gets ridiculous. Stranger things is a very popular property, and a lot of people follow the cast members. I never said I don’t think they’ll be working on stranger things content, but I don’t think it’s going to be immediately. Also, just because the roadmap was released 2 weeks before the announcement doesn’t mean it was made exactly 2 weeks before the announcement. A professional company releasing content on a game plans and begins development on content well before the release of said content. It’s likely that the roadmap was made well before this announcement, and therefore, the plans of release for the chapters was decided well before this deal occurred. Additionally, they’re working with Netflix on a mobile game, so it’s much more likely that this content will be released closer to the release of the mobile game to generate traffic for it, especially if it benefits Behaviour.
---
Waaaah don't kick my gen I worked so hard holding m1 for a whole minute
---
I don’t really understand how it’s punishing killers to reward killers that do want to take the lobbies other people want. At the end of the day, those SWF get lobbies. The only difference is you just make them longer by quitting upon seeing them. It’s not fair for those other killers so giving them a boost seems pretty reasonable to me 🤷‍♂️
---
I found a rainbow map last night, I was pretty happy
---
I love that combo with no mither
---
I actually have all the Franchise DLC survivor perks, and I don't really play killer much, just a thought I had.

Like everyone before me said. HyperX are amazing for their price tag.
---
It was never a bad perk, it was always one of the best, the problem was that its duration was extremely short, when you get to a gen it was already off.
---
Escape cakes have 1/3 chance of spawning per bloodweb
---
I know that... but I didn't mean the actual in-game status effect luck, I mean just the bad luck of getting abdominal dressing on a brown so he couldn't fully heal.
---
The killer doesnt lose anything aside from a few BPs if a survivor DCs...
---
have you ever seen hentai
---
Well the uncommon mori allows you to kill the last survivor regardless if they've been hooked or not
---
daaamn M&amp;A Rank 1, what a tryhard
---
Have you ever seen the sky?
---
Wasnt her m1 lunge short like myers though?
---
No, I understand that you got the joke, but you were being pretty rude like you got offended lol and here you go doing it again. You could have just said you got it instead of being an asshole, but this is reddit
---
See the way you put it was that killers who don't play in the SWF queue get reduced points, that makes it sound like killers who take SWF games get the normal amount. If someone got extra and the none SWF queue was just normal fair enough but I think you missing one key point. You are in a minority of people who are ok with just playing against SWF's and I think it would be a safe bet their would be a lot more killers in the none SWF queue meaning SWF would still get few games and the wait times would be crazy.  
---
The key to the issue is people find SWF unfair and the games are unfun because of all the advantages they get over a team that consists of 1 person. This is why my solution is aimed at enhancing the need for teamwork, you still get your advantage of communication but now you really need to work together. This should appease killers as SWF is no longer just an easy way to dominate a game which means killers are less likely to lobby dodge.
---
There’s been a lot of hints towards a stranger things themed chapter
---
I lose my addons,
---
When a surviver dc’s mid game? No you don’t
---
While I disagree, I will respect your opinion. But I want to know, why do you think it's a good perk?
---
How am I being an asshole? Im just joking around as I said previously explaining the meaning of it. Im sorry If it came out rude, that wasnt the purpose. Only one mad here is you atm lol
---
True, hmmm... maybe the less people sacrificed in the game the higher the boost? Like 1/0/0,
---
2/1/0, 3/2/1?
---
I like to play as them, its fun, but they suck, and there's no worse feeling in this game than missing a frenzy hit lol
---
I’m not mad at all lol it’s really funny to see your responses, since you seemed salty about nothing.
---
They could make it the same queue but give a pop up notifying you of it being a SWF thus bonus bloodpoints.
---
I like to play legion when i dont really feel like using my brain while playing
---
When you say "The announcement" do you mean the one from the official netflix page? They just said be prepared for upcoming projects, if it meant we have started working on projects with BVHR right away then fair enough, but them working together probably started months in the past. I mean, Fortnite released stranger things content right after release of the 3rd season, so they obviously were told in advance to create the licensed content, and the Netflix announcement wasn't announcing that they just started working on something.
---
Also what the hell are you talking about with a mobile game?? I searched up every bit for them working on a mobile game I couldn't find anything of it. I found a Stranger Things mobile game being made by NEXT games for 2020 release, literally nothing at all for behavior.
---
I get you're going around saying "stranger things is only a rumor and stop spreading misinformation" and all that shit but all this is speculation so calm down. There is a lot of evidence pointing towards this, and if you dislike theories, then just don't comment on them to try and get people to see it your way. I mean you just completely grabbed one tiny thing in my list of evidence and said "lol just because they followed someone doesn't mean its confirmed".
---
I'm aure people with microphones are more than people without
---
What do you mean its "not entirely correct"? It is correct. Keyboard and mouse has a significantly lower skill cap, considering the accuracy of doing anything from skillchecks to looking around.
---
Seemed being the key word lol. Sorry if it came out rude, that wasnt my intention. Sorry about the confusion.
---
Doctor is a dlc killer tho..
---
It's a shame really, thought it was a fun game for both of us I hooked them all individually 3 times each and started each chase when they were at full health. They got ruin instantly too. The guy being racist in the chat there threw down the cow tree and killer shack pallets down absolutely instantly too and still T bagged? Some people I guess
---
Doctor is one of my least favorite killers to play against. Everyone's power description is like 4 sentences and his is like 30. Also so annoying when you cant use an item for the whole game because you keep snapping out of tier 3 and it immediately goes back due to overwhelming presence. It's like playing the original legion.
---
PGTW?
---
You’re getting downvoted but you’re correct if he’s complaining about 4 people having a perk while also being alive at the end of the game, then he isn’t good. Also, what pressure? Does he down 2 people chase 1 and then the last gen pops? That’s like the only scenario of genuine pressure, otherwise, they’d just heal and go for gates lol
---
I agree but the complaints of delayed content would probably be almost unbearable.
---
There are articles published after E3 saying Behaviour is working with Netflix. The articles I read didn’t say anything about NEXT working on the mobile game, so terribly sorry for not knowing that when it never got mentioned in the article I read. This subreddit constantly gets flooded by posts like this, when everyone knows something is coming and people are grabbing at literal straws as hints for what is happening (like people following someone on twitter). I don’t have a problem with stranger things coming to dead by daylight, the problem is with how this community acts over it and constantly spams theories and stuff about it. It’s already been announced that it’s happening, so why even post stuff like this in the first place? You don’t need to compile proof when they’ve already said it’s happening lol
---
Godspeed brother, godspeed.
---
The point is, the main objective is so unbelievably easy and quick to do. Gen rushing isn't the survivors fault, it's the devs for making survivor so easy to play.
---
Demogorgon as killer. Hawkins Lab as the map, the killer would have a mechanic like Freddy’s to suck survivors into the upside down.
---
The killer is a no-brainer, and the survivor has to be an adult. That leaves Hopper, Steve, Nancy, Joyce. Bob and Barb are dead. Nancy, Joyce, and Hopper have all been to the ud and survived.
---
Honestly, since Ash was the last survivor, I could see a female this time. I’m banking on Nancy Wheeler.
---
Just saying, if someone perceived your attitude as one way (meaning, when they say you seemed a certain way) and they responded before you clarified that wasn’t your intention, they still perceived your attitude being that way lol
---
I get what they quoted, but it’s still silly to me. I mentioned in my other comment it feels like grasping at straws. It’s already been confirmed that there will be stranger things content coming, so all this seems unnecessary since we already know it’s coming, there’s no need to try and find weird evidence to support existing facts. 
---
Also, just like other people have said, 2 survivors wouldn’t even balance out the last chapter being only ghostface because y’all are forgetting Ash lol
---
Ah thank you, I’ll have to try this then, only need that can of air.
---
Holy shit you have my irl name wtf.
---
I've also never gotten trapped in a forest with a supernatural entity while being hunted by a killer. 
---
Basing these things on real life is silly. If I vault through a window and have enough time to move on the ground, I shouldn't be hit, period. They've been gradually making it easier for killers to swing through pallets and windows, and it really shows. It's not balancing the game out at all... it's making it easier for shitty killers to get a hit.
---
Well, the same post was deleted last time because it's "unrelated to dbd", let's see if this one does better.
---
First off, that's not me (random video on YT), secondly that's a man :)
---
This has got to be the dumbest argument I've seen yet.
---
Pinhead over all!
---
It is 10 but they are almost invisible after 7 seconds
---
Tunneling is kind of a dick move, and DS is only OP if you tunnel people. Dead Hard is extremely easy to bait out and once it is baited they don't have an exhaustion perk for the rest of the chase. Adrenaline really depends on the match. Sometimes it is completely useless while other times it can save someones ass mid chase.
---
Doc is included in the ultimate/game pass edition
---
I run iron maiden on at least 1 build with all of my killers because of how well it pairs with BBQ. Either you get spotted, or you get exposed.
---
At least they got no flashlights
---
Grimes gets it. Run a tank/aggro build and keep the killer busy the whole game. 
---
8k boldness from just chase makes my pp HARD.
---
About as fair as losing a pip to a salty survivor DC.
---
Most I get is where to teleport with freddy to use my PGTW.
---
it smell like broke in here
---
This is how the devs explained getting hit through windows. Will you also complain about hitboxes if a killer hits you over the small fences on Haddonfield? 
---
About "having enough time to move on the ground", perhaps you didn't have as much time as you thought. Killer is playing at 0 ping so he will always be closer than he looks since your model is ---ms behind where you see it in your screen.
---
"slightly"
---
It takes alot of time to get the perfect perk setup you just have to grind in my experience you get alot more Blood points as killer so maybe get barbeque and chilli and just play killer but invest the bloodpoints into survivor
---
Sucks to lose a pip like that but you can get 3 kills as killer without camping and still depip
---
I'm not sure if they've changed anything at all in regards to hitboxes btw...
---
Run kindred. Thank me later.
---
Fallllllllse. Been playing this game since launch. I remember when you would swing at a person in killer shack window and completely get owned by the edge. Now, I can stand at a window, have a survivor be 2 meters off the vault, and hit them. As they're running away. Shit is broken.
---
My hopes for the next few licensed killers, in order of what I want:
---
* Until Dawn (Mike/Wendigo/Snowy cabin);
---
* Silence of the Lambs/Hannibal (Hannibal/Clarice/Dolarhyde/Will Graham/any of the foregoing);
---
* Stranger Things (Steve/Demogorgon/Upside Down) (seems likely to be happening);
---
* Hellraiser (killer only - Pinhead);
---
* Get Out (survivor only - Chris Washington).
---
I’m assuming he meant ace in the hole, because he refers to add one in another comment. I could be wrong tho.
---
the mobile game had nothing to do with Behaviour? lol. Also, all of the other stranger things crossover things have already been announced in fortnight and roblox. Ontop of that, the agreement would have been made with behaviour, long before that teaser announcement was made, if a DLC is the case, its been in the works for a while, and its this upcoming chapter.
---
Yooo dawg I wasnt going that far back, I'm just saying I the last year they haven't changed anything and it seems fair👍Only bullshit factor is when for some reason Billy can chainsaw you through a window.
---
95% of the game is just slowing the game down. 
---
What you’re saying is that a lot of the perks are unfair because it punished people. 
---
Ruin -   Well. Better just leave it up because if I go looking for it. It’ll slow the game down. 
---
Devour hope -   Well. May as well just kill myself o hook so then nobody is wasting time looking for the totem. 
---
Thrill of the hunt - well. May as well not cleanse a single totem otherwise I’m not going to be doing anything else.
---
But that takes effort which no one has
---
He not actually invisible he just bends light to make him transparent duhh
---
Until he just Gets one of you and facecamps The shit out of you
---
I would also note that I've gotten more griefing messages playing DBD as killer than any other game. It just sort of comes with the territory, so don't take it too hard.
---
I mainly play the huntress and hillbilly, what other free killer should I level up to get their teachable perks ? 
---
The nurse to get the nurse calling is that all ? 
---
Should I level up the huntress and hillbilly or should I wait that the nurse calling is teachable ?
---
Congratulations, have a cookie
---
Again.  It really is.  If you’re thinking noed.  Bring in a map or detectives hunch and boom.  You’ve found it straight away,  it’s really not complex. I play solo 95% of the time only to play with streamers who are open to playing SWF and my GF. And even as I’m playing solo. I feel like noed is a completely balanced perk.  If I get downed by it. That’s what I get for being stupid enough for letting the killer get close to me.
---
LMFAO!! Are you upset on behalf of the streamers you watch? You're not even making credible points now. If you don't want to deal with 4 survivors potentially having adrenaline, learn to apply pressure and DO YOUR JOB AS A KILLER &amp; take out a survivor sooner.
---
It seems like every survivor main thinks noed is op. Will complain about how clutch it is. 
---
But those same people probably run adrenaline and don’t see the irony.
---
You lose them when you play the game. Wasted add ons when half the survivors dc because they’re salty boys.
---
It takes less effort levelling up a character for three teachable perks than getting 6000 iridescent
---
Killers are still far better off than survivors at the moment. One killer dc ruins the game for four people, one or two makes it worse for a killer, but you still get some bloodpoints out of it at least.
---
Repeating myself a little from a post further down, but here's a list of all scoring events [here](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodpoints).
---
As a killer, you want to make sure you get multiple hooks rather than having people die on their first one. You also need a bit of chasing and frequent use of your Ability. The mistake some players make is to take Billy or Myers, aggressively patrol their first hook, and then slug the whole team with a Sprint or Evil Within. Efficient, but a poor payout. By comparison, Hag gets points for anything to do with her traps, can have good mobility, and comes with things like Ruin by default. Many people will suggest Doctor, although Doctor gets nothing from Madness, only from landing Shock Therapy (which you can certainly spam if you have something like Ruin to keep the survivors busy while you're not downing them) - with a little bonus if he hits them after.
---
The trick is finding the balance - if you're burning through "efficient" games then you might just make more BP than the equivalent time spent in slow-paced but high-scoring games.
---
For survivors, bag some gens, do bones, open a Gate, but take the Hatch. Go for safe hooks and don't leave anyone wounded or hooked during Collapse. The last category boils down to how good you are at looping, running around the basement, or convincing a killer to eat a pallet.
---
When the web gets bigger, start "gaming the Entity" so that you're not spending BP unecessarily. **Bear in mind that the max payout is 32k, and at 50 you'll be spending in the region of 50k BP per web.**
---
I fucking hate shit like that. Like yeah okay waste it dumbass
---
Vommy mommy next
---
As a billy main with 30d time on him bbq is a great perk for him ruin is not needed but the best thing to do is go around loops be careful for the skilled billy mains that run the green and yellow add ons that make him have 200% speed on the chainsaw they will try to mind game by turning left and right then turn with the chainsaw around the loop and try to get a hit very rare to see a player like that on console mostly seen on pc don't really play survivor so that all l have to said good luck
---
I don’t know about this lol the problem with legions power isn’t the numbers or anything, it’s the concept of the power itself. It goes against the killers objective by making it harder (now it’s pretty much impossible) to get a down while using it and using it just hurts you because it prolongs the chases that you don’t need to prolong anymore since you’re 115% movement speed. The concept of the power is cool but it doesn’t fit with the mechanics of the game, so changing numbers and stuff doesn’t really fix it. IMO they need to just give them a Freddy treatment and give them something that fits more with the game and it’s mechanics.

Now I can't unsee it, thanks &gt;:(
---
Again, you're thinking people only use DH when the killer is right behind them, a good survivor knows the exact point where they NEED DH to make a window or pallet and won't use it if they know they won't make it, usually it's the same point where a survivor complains about the hitbox, the attack that shouldn't have hit, wouldn't have hit if a survivor uses DH. 
---
DS wastes a killers time HEAVILY, 40 seconds is a long time, considering 10 minutes is the average length of a game. 
---
Any perk that gives the survivor another chance to escape, another chance to start a chase, another chance to pallet loop is an incredibly strong perk. How are any of these any different to NOED that gives the killer another chance to kill? They aren't, if you consider NOED OP, you MUST consider the other perks OP otherwise you're a hypocrite.
---
Did u flair it
---
They used BP from survivor games on their killers.
---
Their loss ig
---
&gt;!Maybe they could make it work with him getting taken by the entity whilst in the upside down - if it releases before season 4 it could work.. well better than any other survivor that is currently known to be alive.!&lt;
---
yeah, but since it is coming out the PS5...
---
Bill works on generators.  Mind has been changed.
---
Yeah, some 115% killers ideally have a free first hit, then a "normal" chase for the second. Applies for Legion, Pig, Wraith.. All bottom tier ones when I think about it.. Plague also kind of apply by this mechanic to some degree.
---
Thank you so much!
---
I think people just prefer to see new concepts that's all.
---
I still think that the idea they went for in the rework is really good but they did overdo it with nerfs. He needs more duration and speed to chain hits easily and have more map pressure since he can't down anymore and a total addon rework since only 3 are good and the rest are useless.
---
Bloodhound will go great on my Legion.
---
If NOED is to stay in its current state there should be a totem counter that everyone can see and that’s all there is to say honestly
---
The map with the marker add on
---
Already exists.
---
Introducing Dead by Daylight's new chapter : The sex dungeon.
---
What is his power going to be? Seducing me?
---
Wasn’t saying they aren’t. Just that a Killer does lose their add ons at the end of the game and it sucks when everybody gives up because of one or two salty bois. Ruins the game for everybody.
---
Wtf, you haven't played very long have you?
---
If he made it into the game, I would be so happy. The Mori would probably be the most brutal, and that music (chik chik chik ah ah ah ah) would be amazing in game. I wonder what survivor would come with him though, I never really watched F13, but I liked the game
---
This is how i felt. Going from players who worked on gens and didn't waste time to people who crouch around the map the second they hear a heartbeat lol
---
This is why i swapped to perks that let me solo, like deliverance in case people are too scared to unhook which, unfortunately, is usually the case.
---
3rd or 4th best killer in the game. Use Thana on him and he has the chance of really slowing the game down. Survivors are already adapting to him and just running forwards or throwing the pallet down and moving on instead of looping.
---
The idea is really good but he needs more buffs to get more use out of his power and become a bigger threat. More duration and speed to chain hits more easily, less stun time, total addon rework since only 3 are good and the rest are useless and a more engaging mending with skillchecks so there is actual danger when missing them.
---
I mean, there's one common denominator, just sayin'.
---
I see the same discussions in one of my other horror obsessions,  Halloween Horror Nights in Orlando.  People always prefer the original haunted houses,  but it's the licensed IPs like 'Stanger Things' and 'Halloween" that bring in the crowds.
---
How do you clean the inside?
---
You no longer as of Endgame Collapse update can grab survivors out of hatch. You can close the hatch tho.
---
They removed this feature when they added hatch closing.
---
You can’t do it anymore. Instead you need to close the hatch before the survivor jumps in.
---
Oh makes sense thanks
---
Everyone is different, but I classify 'genrushing' as ignoring more time sensitive objectives to stay on a generator. Like not healing yourself or letting a teammate go into struggle-phase. Maybe also not going for a Hex totem, especially Devour Hope when it's already at 3 tokens.
---
Some idiots in the killer community call 'genrushing' any time generators are just done quickly. Which is dumb, because if you don't give the survivors anything else to do, why wouldn't they work on generators.
---
Thanks
---
But you broke the eject button, which seems pretty annoying...and having a noisy fan doesn't seem to be much of a problem as long as the console itself isn't getting absurdly hot...So was it really worth it?
---
You just kind of have to accept the devs aren’t gonna add any mechanics (besides killer depips/safety pips) that punish camping.
---
if we're gonna get stranger things make Steve a survivor
---
Killer mains man smh
---
That’s because 98.4 million people own a PS4 and only 43 million own an Xbox. Hopefully the game will do better for you when it’s added to that gamepass thing.
---
Actually a survivor main OMEGALUL
---
Just get better at the game instead of making assumptions.  It makes you look like someone who stays at rank 20 and not on purpose.
---
Legion is an amazing bp farming killer too. His power is just too good for farming/ranking up.
---
I wouldn’t be able to. It would be too painful for me to kill even one of them :(
---
Yeah because it got nerfed into the ground
---
Pop goes the weasel
---
 Botany knowledge is much more useful in that case.
---
You're not really good at this whole summing up people's arguments into a single quote thing, might wanna stop trying that. And whatever, at the end of the day your the one getting worked up over literally nothing. If you have a bad game and can't handle people laughing at it, then you're a child. Simple as that, you're the one that needs to grow up
---
I dunno. Billy has built-in map control. Tack on Ruin &amp; BBQ, good chance you're slaying a non-swf.
---
You didn't WON the match though if the person that has deliverance hasn't been hooked yet. So they should be able to use it. Knock them down and count if you're scared of DS.
---
are you trying to say the kinky part is a bad idea? (͡ ͡° ͜ つ ͡͡°)
---
Bhvr does make other games. ST originally collaborated with TTG before they went bankrupt,  so this may be another attempt at making a game
---
Excuse for the very late reply!
---
Well knowing its low ranks and that a rank reset just happened not to long ago its not uncommon to find non-optimal teammates.
---
The best thing you can do is to figure out where the survivor has already been and consider that place a dead-zone. Try to imagine how long the chase has been going, and how much pallets do you think the survivor could have possibly used within that time. By visualizing where your team has already used their pallets, you can safely route where you may escape to if the killer ever comes your way. Then simply follow the same rules as stated before such as going to the next loop over and be optimal with your pathing.
---
Of course, its still ideal to give the area a quick scout to see which pallets have been ACTUALLY used. But you know, save the trouble and time from physically going to the area by considering "has my team been through this area?"
---
Hope this helped!
---
I'm happy you phrased it as "Proud of this" and not "Oh hey guys I'm new here not sure what to post, just started playing, am kinda noobie ahahaha is this any good you guys?? Ahaha can you tell me how good this is?!?!?!?!"  
---
Yeah no you're way above that, fucking CRAZY clip bro! :))
---
Im just thinking from a business viewpoint, but for pleasure... ;)
---
Yeah I lose the opportunity to use said addons because everyone has left.
---
Botany knowledge is decent at best,  rest are pretty garbo. Can we please get a decent shrine for once?
---
Agree.
---
Bloodwarden has become the best perk in the game
---
It’s Shawn the dweet
---
NOED burned our crops, poisoned our water supply and delivered a plague unto our houses!
---
I don't think NOED applies to M2 attacks. It might've been Iridescent head
---
And this is why whispers is such a great QoL perk.
---
I found one but have no idea what it does.
---
Well yeah she's really easy to play, its ok bro in every game there's a character that is easy to use and is really good
---
Spiderman new killer
---
yea and use those 60 seconds to walk them off to the nearest open gate :)
---
LIKE THE WRAITH
---
Jaws new killer
---
No, we’re supposed to run overwhelming presence.
---
always nice seeing a fellow kindred user!
---
I guess that is true, still, pick them up and of they stab you it's your fault for not hooking them sooner. They used a perk for the ability to get off the first hook and even had to do work to use it so they should be able to use it. Still have to pass a skillcheck for the ds and make it to gate or hatch before being hit again.
---
No outsider can enter without permission? Hawkins labs opened the gate in the first place and Nancy, Joyce, Hopper, Will, and Eleven have all been there and survived.
---
Joyce and Hopper went in there willingly to find Will, and Nancy stumbled in there through a tree. There’s gates opening all over Hawkins, so what’s stopping the Entity? I mean, it infiltrated the dream world, for crying out loud.
---
Cuz you are on controller
---
Running deliverance guarantees I get hooked first.
---
Problem with licensed content is that it makes devs limited in some ways in the way they design the characters, their traits, powers etc. That has been a factor in why some characters never get skins or why Haddonfield is the most shit map ever
---
&gt;not even worth it  
---
&gt;decides to message him first
---
I got 2500hrs and still got 130/131 :^(
---
Game throwing.
---
"I'm gonna retort you with the same statement I made earlier showing that I'm a stubborn ass who refuses to listen and I'm also gonna point out that you're bad at using a certain way of making me look stupid, because I look stupid and I don't like that." I'll do what you did and just repeat myself: no one has to tolerate you being a giant cockwaffle.
---
If you try to blind the husk, and the Spirit is faking a move, it will either blind her or she will look up. Basically it is a check to see if she is actually phase walking.
---
Predator isn’t a bad idea. I can see him as an exception to the rule of the killers having to be a human in the past before the entity took them.
---
Yeah haha
---
He can't really turn or anything with the chainsaw active. There's really no mind game to that.
---
Thanks i might actually try that out, doesnt mattet where i look i cant find the icon
---
What about baby shirtleas david? I swear that every shirtless david play like a dweet

---
I'm enjoying playing him, especially late game when I'm running surveillance lol. He seems like solid B tier to me
---
Because they are smart and are trying to trigger skill checks for point gains.
---
They really need to make that clear. Caps are stupid.
---
I realize now how much they sound like angry feminist vegan karens
---
Jules: We happy?
---
Vince: Yeah, we’re happy
---
...But that kind of weak structure appears on literally all maps.
---
Slugging is not against the rules. It's a killer strategy, and very effective on some killers/builds. It's also a good way to deal with people who sabo your hooks.
---
It isn't fun from a survivor perspective if you're slugged though and just bleeding out for 4 minutes, which is why you might get some salty messages.
---
Yeah I know that this behavior is a game throwing, I'm asking you to show me the rules you are talking about.
---
Get gud I mean bbq and ruin shouldn’t be a problem for a gud player hit them great skill checks and loop his ass chief and just get gud lul
---
I mean apparently you do because there's no mute function and it's not bannable to laugh at someone, so keep making up your imaginary rules to try to force on others 👍🏼
---
It should be noted that Doctor and Hag are only free on console.
---
\*3 DC noises\*
---
.... This is fine....
---
I’ve actually found the Freddy rework has been getting me maxed out on Deviousness and Hunting without trying. Brutality and Sacrifice come along for the ride as long as you do decently. is fairly easy to do with perks like BBQ, Brutal Strength, Pop, and whatever perk you like (I’m a sucker for stbfl).
---
I was doing a daily where I had to chase people for 180 seconds so I didn’t want to kill them off too fast and also my ruin got destroyed pretty quickly.
---
Doesn't this just mean everyone is a 1 shot but it's slightly delayed? Other one-shot perks actually require something to happen for them to become active (haunted grounds must be cleansed and only lasts a limited time, devour hope requires 3 hooks) whereas this seems to just be flat-out power creeping both of them due to the fact that from the start of the game until it's broken, everyone is a 1-hit down. I know there's potentially some counterplay(??) with the effect only persisting onto the last 3 survivors, but that means that either the killer purposefully doesn't hit someone, or survivors purposefully do get hit, which are both completely against what their goals are.
---
Imagine thinking being a decent person is just some imaginary rules put there to oppress you or something
---
Stridor hard-counters Iron Will.
---
Yes, awhile back it was It turned into a big meme here on the sub.
---
Some Huntress players like Shadowborn, to increase their field of view.
---
Only 520 hours? Were you just grinding for cheevos from the very beginning? Good lord. That sounds so stressful.
---
I haven't run Ruin since 2.0 launched. It's not needed at all. Once you're at reds most people just power through it; at most it'll give you an extra 30-40 seconds if the totem doesn't get destroyed before that. Corrupt Intervention or some perk to help win chases faster (Brutal/Enduring/Fury) or something to slow down other aspects like Sloppy does way more damage in my experience.
---
I think if you can get reported for gamethrowing then it’s against the rules.
---
Wait is dead by daylight going to be the thing that actually gets me to watch Stranger things?
---
So you want second chance perks to be guaranteed with no downside nor risk associated with running them, so people can just play stealty, not risk anything during the game and then have so many "second chances" with them it won't be possible to catch them in the end-game
---
gotcha
---
&gt;Garbage rank system.
---
Garbage sweaty killers. FTFY
---
Interesting theory -- so facecamping a survivor, thereby letting other survivors finish gens and escape, is how they kill survivors? My dude, most of the time I see killers facecamping, they get less points than everyone but the person they camped, and sometimes not even that. 
---
The killer *is* responsible for engaging with the game. There isn't a game that exists, idle games notwithstanding, where you accomplish the goals of the game by not playing it. That's like survivors who hop in a locker and don't move all game. Their job is to survive and escape, right? So why should they do generators when they can let the others do it? Yeah, the killer is not responsible for the survivor's fun. There are plenty of viable killer strategies that make the game nothing but frustrating to survivors, and much as I hate them, they are valid. But facecamping specifically is the antithesis of how the game is supposed to function, and if it works, it's as you said -- bad survivors. But a facecamping killer is a bad killer. This is because **you can't hook survivors if you stake a tent by a hook unless they're idiots.** Perhaps I misunderstood some of your points if you were trying to communicate that this is somehow viable.
---
I had 2 people dc when i was playing killer and the 2 left were so bad it took them 40 min to escape despite me not even trying to kill them
---
Uncle Lary's Sex Dungeon*
---
these addons are very strong, no wonder poor guys died easily
---
I started grinding around 400 but i didn't have much achievements remaining

&lt;3
---
ngl, i was saying the same exact thing when i first started
---
Do that in the open and she'll smack you if she is faking. Do it at a loop and she'll smack you if she isn't faking.
---
The thing is, uou can be reported as a gamethrower for anything the reporting person considers as such. My question is, what is *stated* in the rules as a gamethrowing behavior.
---
Phasing does NOT move grass or corn, this is a popular myth which isn’t true. Thats why Prayer Beads has no counterplay whatsoever and is absurdly OP. You can’t have collision and also no grass movement. That’s the problem wit Spirit.
---
Ok I've seen people say this on here a lot and it doesn't make sense.
---
"Oh you're just gonna waste all your time healing with self-care you should be doing objectives."
---
But this is my line of thinking. If someone gets hit, and then escapes, then if they dont heal they will go down in 1 hit and not be able to provide a very long chase. If someone is, as you say, constantly in the corner healing, doesn't that mean if they weren't healing, they would be going down all those subsequent times (after the first hit) that they didnt heal? How is it more productive for someone to be downed than to have healed and provide a longer chase?
---
Basically any time after the very first time they heal, if you see someone healing that means they would be downed/hooked right now if they hadn't healed last time. You see what I am saying?
---
And wouldn't the maximum number of "wasted" heals (meaning you didnt need to heal because you didnt end up getting hit again) be 1? Due to the nature of the fact you cant heal again if you aren't hit again. I just dont get how self healing is considered so bad.
---
Yes, it was in response to how stressful Killer could be. Instead of responding with promises of balance changes, he instead suggested we play another game (CIV 5), in order for players to get over their player's fatigue. It didn't go over well.
---
Just took 1 achievement and playied i farmed with survivors to get some of them
---
its not that hes op, he just isnt fun to play against
---
Maybe some but I am not a dweet
---
But adrenaline pops at the last gen and only lasts for that time. A door won’t be open in that time. Noed can easily counter adrenaline with one smack. It’s just up to RNG with the totem placement.
---
Yup!
---
I can make a lot as survivor with wglf but that requires I beeline to hooks to unhook people first or take hits, changing my playstyle.
---
As killer, bbq is just free blood points because I get them for doing the thing I have to do no matter what, hooking.
---
I find killer more rewarding as a gameplay experience as well. Survivors just get to sit next to a machine and sometimes hit space bar. They need to make survivor side more exciting with new objectives to get people playing more survivor. Also more bp.
---
source/explanation? i mean this genuinely, considering she was so hellbent on being a mother.
---
Thank you.
---
We are in agreement. Spirit is dumb.
---
If I buy LF they'll put BBQ&amp;C in the Shrine the next week!
---
Here's how to counter Spirit:
---
1.) Know when she phases; the glass in her body glows during this time, so you can watch for that before reacting to her phase
---
2.) Spine Chill; it works on her when phasing so you know when she's coming at you
---
3.) Windows; like most killers she cannot go through physical objects and must find an entrance so a window on a long wall is your ally
---
It’s not uncommon to miss a hit, but losing a survivor is worst cause if they run iron will you’ll never find them.
---
sick!
---
tbh iridescent head huntress is the only add on i’ll just dc the match because of it. it’s not worth it
---
Killer good survivors bad
---
You are a big boy, as baby as dweet that dead 'ard in the wall
---
after gridning for ruin, devour and nurse's calling, pop is the next one.  i debated between pop and overcharge.   but pop for freddie would be amazing.  or even nurse or any other fast moving killer.   
---
im running clown with pop, ruin, bbq and nurse's.  and its a grand ol time.

Yes it works.
---
Baby Dwets so precious
---
Legion gets lots of Chase, Brutality and Deviousnes even when playing poorly.
---
His reply is to one of the comments (zLight), not directed at you.
---
&gt; Any survivors with a brain will rush the gens and get an easy win.
---
I don't play survivor to just do gens. I want to do other shit like being chased and getting saves. Fuck EZ wins - that's not fun. And killers camping survivors kills the Altruism category of the teammates
---
This just punished players who don’t have time for this, don’t agree with it.
---
Twitter follows could easily be a coincidence, the collab was a stranger things game, done by BHVR, and already released.
---
the worst part to me is they act like its skill. The fact that the hook proximity deduction and that a maximum of 4 hooks instead of 12 also lowers your bp significantly results in you gaining less than 5k bp overall, should be their first clue that this is not how this game is played... As a killer main, this shit pisses me off
---
All g friendo
---
🙏
---
BBQ and Chili, Unnerving Presence, Distressing and all topped off with Overcharge. Now that is cancer. And that's my go to build for Doctor. I'm sorry for the crimes I have committed.

Are you letting go of R1?
---
U have a minute right? That’s plenty of time
---
Imagine thinking that saying something like "lol nice noed" makes you an indecent person. Nice hyperbole, stay offended fairy
---
&gt;oh shit really haha who was I playing as?
---
''Use pallets and windows'' Are you giving us a guide on how to deal with bad spirits? None of that shit works against good ones.
---
Demn, Haunted ground. Good thing I'm not getting chased.

---
Yah I was told and hopefully they perma banned that guy who was sniping him, that’s pretty low to have to get a program and stalk someone online...
---
I mean.. its 3 unless you are getting 32k (max) every time or you are talking about survivor puddings as the offerings.
---
Still 3 isnt much, I just keep seeing everyone say 2
---
Oh no 😂
---
There isnt a stranger things game by BHVR. Theres one by BonusEXP and a mobile one by another company coming out next year. The Behaviour one isnt confirmed to be anything so far
---
I can only see rank decay being bad for a long vacation from the game, otherwise it seems fine
---
I pretty much only come back when there's licensed content I enjoy.
---
Aye. You won't ever find me complaining about the licensed content but I'm a much bigger fan of the original ideas. Much more room to experiment with them.
---
What about detective tapp?
---
&gt;as if the first person is saying that the cheese was fine.
---
There was literally nothing else you could gain from it, if that's your opinion you were using him the brainless way which had to go.
---
&gt;Frenzy is useless
---
Was useless before unless - again - if you used BS tactics. It's still free first hit, tracking tool and mobility.
---
Me and my 2 friends were playing and 1 of us was dead there was me and my friend + some other dude me and my friend did the last gen and escaped and we got that it was some weird glitch and i got realy lucky and the last dude died after
---
&gt;  Also, there are killer builds with 3-4 perks for endgame, why is it bad when a survivor has 2? Lol 
---
The killer gets to the end-game by not killing everyone by that time. This means that they either win early without perks, win in the end-game with those perks or lose even tho they had an end-game build
---
The survivor has to survive up to that point and do the objective to get there, and this part of the game isn't as important to them
---
Ah, yes yes. I myself am familiar with the parodies created by Samination, and I myself am referencing an exact quotation from the YouTuber Demi.
---
So no, YOU should check thyself.
---
I've done this
---
What kinda chicken hokey pokey cooka argument are you making?
---
You know the killer is busted when survivor has to have one perk to even have a chance against them.
---
But slasher isn't that popular. A licensed chapter needs a large croud to bring in fans, slasher doesn't have that.
---
Not to mention that WGLF provides zero use in-game outside of post-match bloodpoints
---
They’d probably use Tommy Jarvis- I think he’d be a pretty good addition to the survivor roster and a good choice to release alongside Voorhees himself.
---
Exactly. It really can be nothing but a dead perk.
---
Much appreciated man :)))
---
I sometimes do when I wait for a game
---
Jesus christ. Bye.
---
Not gonna lie, I play shirtless David so that I am more noticeable than the newbie I am playing with. I would rather take the aggro while he stays safe.
---
Someone must be for people to continue to do it.  Also inlove all the downvotes I'm getting.  For what it is worth I'm a survivor main.
---
Krampus outfit for clown maybe.
---
You know nothing about point efficiency
---
These are great tips for figuring out when Spirit is phasing but after that, then what? So you work out that she’s phasing, you’re injured, and you... what, exactly?
---
Yeah I plan on getting Freddy when I get my money.
---
Thanatophobia [spelling?]
---
Window on a long wall?????????
---
If that happens, you'll probably be a runner up for the unluckiest person of 2019
---
Jason is literally impossible (unless, like someone pointed out, they’d finished a F13 chapter before the lawsuit- but that is beyond unlikely). Which is a huge shame, as he’s maybe the biggest horror icon there is (at the very least he’s at the same level as Freddy and Michael).
---
Lol NOED needs a rework, Ive been hearing that since I started playing over a year ago, there is nothing wrong with it in my opinion and if 4 people can’t simply take care of 5 totems because they wanna blow thru the gens and be out the gates within 3 mins that’s there problem. They get what they get and now you get 1000bp for dull totems! people are just to focused on the main objective or think they can steam roll a killer, and then he gets his revenge, but it’s called small game  and I use it all the time and count totems as I make my rounds playing solo survivor. Plus it makes it a fun side mission and I don’t know how many times I’ve denied a killer NOED and gotten a fuck you from then for it lol! 
---
Just cleanse totems, 14 seconds isn’t that long and idiots will be off in a corner healing themselves for 20-25  seconds all frickin game long and then get smacked down by NOED in the end.

Bhvr's main, high budget games are dbd and deathgarden which is nowhere near as popular as dbd. The rest are mostly mobile games or game versions/ spinoffs for already existing titles such as Fallout shelter. It could be one of those types of games but stranger things is sorta a horror series. Theres already mobile games by other studio being made for stranger things, and already official stranger things game. Right now it's looking like its going to be a chapter.
---
Depends what your aim is in each match - the best moments for me on this game are when you pull off the unlikely late game saves, even though they only come off 1/5 maybe
---
No guts, no glory!
---
You’re definitely not worth trying to discuss this with if you don’t get it lol have a good day
---
&gt; There was literally nothing else you could gain from it, if that's your opinion you were using him the brainless way which had to go.
---
lol no it isn't there are absolutely criticisms of how much they were nerfed that has nothing to do with the cheese mechanics
---
&gt; Was useless before unless - again - if you used BS tactics. It's still free first hit, tracking tool and mobility.
---
Against even semi-decent survivors these don't matter. I spend most of my time in trials injured and have a build around that and Legion is omegalul simply because I am sort of decent at looping. The only time I have any kind of trouble with them is if they're boosted and have Bamboozle.
---
I'm shamelessly farming everyone to get that damn 250 hit trophy, at least I have the kindness to run BT while I'm at it.
---
"ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA" - Dwight working on totem
---
Yup. that message was basicly "I'm done talking to you sir" if you didn't get the difference between the end-game for the killer and for the survivor
---
Yeah literally just ignore everything else she has :D
---
They are
---
Rest isnt tryhard either. He even brought a BP Offering
---
So the survivor is Nea + Claudette + Adam?
---
Slugging is neither toxic nor is it bannablw. There are about 5 separate perks to counteract it and three or four that encourage it. If someone messages you to say you’re getting banned for it, they’re a salty moron. If someone calls it toxic, they’re being dramatic.
---
It's because treatment mode is slightly slower than punishment mode.
---
anything below 30/40 is bad
---
Doesn't mean he's free/not dlc..
---
Yeah, I don't know why every time a killer see a shirtless David in the lobby they go full tunnel toxic mode, just let people be babby ffs
---
I don't think he looks much like Donald Glover. They obviously tried to keep base similarities with Laurie/Tapp but didn't model the face exactly after Curtis/Glover, whereas Ash is definitely modelled with Campbell in mind, and for some reason they decided they would replace Quentin's actor's face with a melted kneecap.
---
Endgame killer effects endgame survivor.  It takes time to get to a door and open it, and the killer will be trying to prevent that. Using perks to help you play against that and assist in getting out are useful. They do play differently, but they still have to be played. I’m not sure what you don’t understand about that.
---
It's a great idea but way too difficult for the devs for something as small as to be limited to a certain map or certain perks. I'd much rather a playable killer as the demogorgon if they're gonna make attacks and animations for the demogorgon anyway. I'd like the idea of the upside down being ingame somehow though.
---
Tbh it was a joke at first playing on what VESTINGboot (which is probably the most useful response) said about subjectivity. But I’ll explain why you got downvoted.
---
“Thx but that was Not the question.”  This is just an ass way of responding to someone. You abbreviate “thanks” to “Thx” which is what annoying white 14 y/o girls do— it’s annoying. You also capitalized “Not.” Your intention may have been emphasis in reference to the question, but this capitalization made it appear that you were mocking him for being wrong and floating about it— it annoying just like with “Thx.” You also put a space between “How ?,” no one does that— you are doing it to make yourself sound like you’re  innocent.
---
What you should always do as an OP when responding is sound respectful. It’s your job to be likeable. I would recommend you having said things along the lines of “Sorry, I don’t really see what you mean, can you answer more along X?” and “what?” 
---
You’re entire way of communicating in this thread just reads as annoying/rude, try to change it a little to be more professional. 
---
I know we are on the internet, but remember—you as the OP are being judged by everyone else, we have no reason to like or to hate you unless you give it to us. The only way we see you is through your writing.
---
have a beautiful time
---
I should have said that I'm on pc, thank you
---
Using up most add-ons before prestiging (until I have no good bp offerings).
---
Hmm, I think they look alike, not as similar as Ash was though, or how different Quinton and laurie look.
---
You find noed.

You destroy noed.

That was my thoughts, There are still tons of great pop culture horror icons they could licence or base original killers off off, i'd hate to get a new chapter just because something is currently popular.
---
The 3 others being dead doesn't mean they didn't basically get to end game without that person, if that person was truly playing only stealthy, doing nothing and in lockers every time you'd see their aura.
---
Meanwhile the killer gets ruin from the start, can see when 2 people are on a generator, can see when people are healing, can see survivors when they hook somebody. 
---
But yeah that one person shouldn't get to kobe off the hook with deliverance or not.
---
Until you remember Gideon and Haddon field.
---
True, true. The only reason I thought it might be worth their while is that they said the Halloween events are a test at new/alternate mechanics - unfortunately one that everyone seemed to hate. This might be a new way of testing, albeit more permanently. If it works they could in future maps (or add variant maps) with perkless 'dead zones'.
---
It seems a lot of killers take 3k as a loss somehow.
---
Double rare addons on a killer that doesn't even need addons to be good. But ok. I don't blame the guy for being salty because that is a disgusting spirit. Just doesn't justify slurs like that.
---
I try to just scare the babies away the first few times. But at some point it's more of a mercy kill
---
Why do you believe there will be a Stranger Things DLC?
---
I agree with your title for the most part, but I think it's a little over the top.
---
&gt; there is no counterplay whatsoever
---
This I don't agree with. 
---
But playing against Spirits becomes a chore because of how common she is
---
Definitely no change in blood web quality that I've seen. So it's all about the appearance.
---
I did the licensed killers first as they have no other cosmetics. Then my favourites after that.
---
Ok so now we need to rally behind which Pokemon we want as the next licensed killer. My vote is for a Haunter that possess objects. Get that Sylph Scope!
---
&gt; and show them i was being friendly and just wanted blood points... I don't think that is very annoying.
---
It's extremely annoying. I want to play a real game and not some boring, drawn out patty-cake session.
---
le "friendly killers" are the worst
---
They all of diff lunges
---
Whenever I’m having a bad match I can count on getting at least one more kill if not two just off people being overly altruistic. I won’t even have NOED going and still get people because they just won’t give up and feel they can get someone.
---
No one hates it. It just sucks to not get original, unique content
---
No need to downvote me because I explained it.
---
I was sitting around ranks 7-9 for most of last month. I'm by no means stating that I'm the best player to ever live, but I don't think I'm terrible. 
---
The problem here is that you're not understanding what I'm saying. I'm not saying that I can't figure out how to handle facecamping. I'm not saying that bad survivors don't feed into it. I'm not even saying it's a problem I encounter on a regular basis. I'm saying it's bullshit and shouldn't be done. The crucial part you seem to be unable to grasp is that ***I am not complaining about my experiences, I am merely stating that facecamping in general makes the game less engaging for everyone and shouldn't be practiced, because the point of the game is to pay the game.*** Your point that only bad survivors complain about it makes no sense to me. It is possible to not be afflicted by a problem and still recognize that it is a problem. To make this absolutely clear: I understand how to recognize a facecamping killer. I understand that this happening means I need to do generators and let the other survivor die. I understand that if I'm getting camped, I'm going to be the one who dies. I understand that this is a bad killer strategy.  But I also understand that it shouldn't be practiced and will state as much.
---
I like playing Legion, but I know I'm only getting 2\~ kills at best. Idk what happened last night, but I kept playing against some really good survivors. It seemed like every game they were all running flashlights and they were all super coordinated. At least I can farm ezpz blood points to invest in other killers.
---
You say that until he catches you offguard and downs all 4 of you in one swing
---
Por que no los dos?
---
Seriously... that should just be one button.
---
Your opinion. If you don't like it. Why bother commenting. Play your game your way, and ill play it my way 💁🏽✌
---
Didint downvote anyone, i just linked to poes law.
---
I was going to say I saw this last week. But I see this as related to dbd. Also the show is amazing.
---
If its a Doctor then it’s probably sadism
---
I'm just annoyed about the survivor perk vs killer perk comparsion. Still love ya &lt;3
---
Oh for sure, especially when the survivors bones cease to exist on the ground. Makes for some good screenshots. But sacrifices have to be made for better balance.
---
You’re wrong, and that’s okay.
---
Because old lunged were based on normal speed. So 96% speed is shorter, and 333% is the longest.
---
I guess I should probably learn to play Huntress. I didn't even know you could throw hatchets that far.  Nice shot!
---
From what I hear the developers do not want any non-human Killers. Also, there are many horror and science fiction antagonists that, personally, I think should be next in line. Though the evidence seems to be pointing to a Stranger Things chapter I would be very disappointed with that. Mostly because I have never really seen it as a horror show, I understand that I am in the minority with that opinion. Honestly, I'd prefer a new original Killer cause this is getting to be a bit too much like Smash Bros.  
---
I don't mind the licensed characters. But when I'm playing DbD I don't want to be constantly reminded of other media and at a certain point it just feels like advertisement.
---
Maybe you don't understand what am talking about and that fine
---
Which skin is baby Dwight? The where is Waldo one?
---
If I remember corectly, when Myers was released devs said there won't be any cosmetics or skins for him except for prestige and even though the shop wasn't around, they already had skin bundles back then. I have some skins from 2016.
---
Was just something I threw on prior to the game, ranked the spirit up so much I have so many addons so may as well use them. Used all my prayer beads/ double iridescent pushing to get my first rank 1 last season, fair enough calling me try hard then haha
---
"u mad?" - feng min 
---
nah but for real, i really love jane's quote *"Showing up when things get rough, listening to people's problems, and supporting those in need; that's how you become stronger, that's how you grow."* 
---
and i also really love this quote from jeff "*bravery can conceal your flaws, even when you are at your most vulnerable."*
---
HAVING THE FORSAKEN LEFT FOR DEAD ACHIEVEMENT WITH EGC ACTIVE IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE LOVE OF CLAM STRIPS SOMEONE FIX THAT I EITHER NEED A COMPLETELY TERRIBLE KILLER AND SURVIVOR TEAM OR THE LUCK OF EVERY DEITY EVERY BELIEVED IN TO GET THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES FOR IT
---
FRANKLINS DEMISE IS A BITCH PERK... JUST SAYING SORRY YOU DONT LIKE ME FLASHLIGHTING UR FACE HOLE!
---
Yes that is an interesting point about bhvr testing mechanics in events and I really hope they think of something similar as this could be really interesting .
---
HOW THE FUCK AM I SO BAD?  I HAD TWO FUCKING SURVIVORS LITERALLY RAIN FROM THE SKY IN FRONT OF ME ON BILLY AND STILL COULDN'T SCORE A HIT.  I HAD ANOTHER CORNERED LATER AND STILL MISSED.  I THINK I NEED A BREAK.
---
I agree I almost never run it but I do like the perk.
---
lol i was looking at trophies and i just saw this one and thought of how ridiculously hard it was
---
This is kinda racist, way too little diversity
---
He was RPing
---
Which is ridiculous because there is no definition of what a “win” or “loss” really is. You can gain plenty of BPs and still pip even if you only kill 1 or 2 survivors, and you can also get a 4K yet no pip because you played the round shitty or got a dc. 
---
Yet you still get those killers who must slug someone just so they can find the last survivor, even if it means dragging out the game for half an hour. So much fun!
---
I've been the doctor in that situation many 5imes before.
---
The answer is both.
---
Understandable, but while the Demogorgan is not human, he is very human-like, unlike, say, a bear or shark. I say yes, it is not human, but it still is human enough to have a shot at getting into the roster
---
But y’all get original content like: The Legion, you guys screech a protest to remove him or get him nerf to an oblivion. 
---
Dbd fans don’t know what they want.
---
That game sounds familiar. Was that on Xbox?
---
Where are they? I get only f#cking pro players
---
So is intentionally failing every skill check, jumping in and out of locker teammates not gamethrowing just because it’s never stated in the rules that those specific actions are gamethrowing?
---
I really hope so too, but keep in mind that the hatch part is just speculation. Only the hook part is confirmed sadly. I think if the hatch husk makes it into the game, it should be on a timer tho, something like 30-60s after DC the hatch opens. That way you cant screw the last survivor by using the DC-Card to trap them with the killer and 5 gens left, but also cant screw up the 4k of the killer as easily.
---
it is cursed for me when i solo
---
Apparently I've heard that the PTB should be out next week, and Behavior hasn't said a word about their next chapter. Here's hoping!
---
I meant Ash and GF. I haven't spent shards on DLC other than BP since Plague
---
You should carry one around like a buddy while you hunt the others.
---
Not really. Try hard with the others and the one or two lone people that farn with me will farm with me and when I come across you, ill kill you. Ya act like i do this every match. I don't maybe 1in like 100 when i am tryna level up a couple of characters a little to get some decent perks. Your opinion though still isnt going to effect how i play my game. Especially when i usually play survivor 💁🏽
---
Why doesn't the hair move naturally ffs ! xD
---
it was kinda funny cuz when they reworked Nurse they made her lunge as long as a normal one, when Huntress and Hag still had a bit shorter ones
---
obviously?
---
All good, friend.
---
Ok. Thank you
---
You just got PRANKED, bro!
---
Welcome to the genre monopoly.
---
Everything being. Literally nothing is needed to counter it.  It counters itself. 
---
HEX: NOED itself is countered by HEX: NOED
---
By being.  
---
A hex. 
---
It’s really that simple.  Just destroy it!
---
Learn every map. 
---
Learn the totem spots. 
---
The only people that get screwed by NOED.  Are newbs.
---
A mix of the 2 is nice. I'm sure this game wouldn't be as big as it was without such iconic horror killers and survivors, the 2nd ever DLC was Michael Myers and Laurie Strode.
---
In the same vein all the original characters show the creativity and bring a unique aspect to the game making it it's own thing.
---
A good example is the F13 game being the closest thing to DBD but it's based entirely around a license, even without the licensing hell their hands are so tied with what they can actually have made for the game
---
The reason they can be useless is because Baby Dwight's are new and still learning the game and trying to do well, that's why when something like a mori comes and destroys a baby Dwight it's sad because they stood no chance against it. It seems you just think that as soon as someone starts playing a game they must instantly become good at it, and that if they don't, they're just "incels".
---
Finally we know whats inside the briefcase
---
ALRIGHT FINE GO NUTS WITH UR 4 PURPLE TOOLBOXES THEN
---
I’m a baby survivor despite being rank like, 16 or 14ish, but I’m a baby in the sense of having no idea when I should do X vs Y: like idk when I’m supposed to help heal people or just say fuck it, I helped you off the hook but we gotta go! 
---
Or like, I’ll play with my friends and I’ll see someone get hit and one of them will ask why I didn’t try to distract the killer and get him on me, but then the times that I do, they’re yelling “omg why did you do that” and shit haha 
---
Basically, how do I know what I should be doing at a given time? Obviously working on gens, cleansing totems, hiding when someone is getting hooked in case of BBQ is obvious, but mainly in chase and shit, idk what I should be doing with my hands. 
---
Any assistance is greatly appreciated &lt;3
---
Because Netflix announced that they are partnering with Behavior to release some content, and then the guy in charge of licencing killers for dead by daylight commented too.
---
&gt;changing my playstyle
---
Except the perk entices you to be more altruistic, fitting David's character (the survivor it comes from), and being altruistic is something survivors are supposed to be doing anyway.
---
OH LOOK AT YOU, SURVIVOR, YOU CAN BALANCED LANDING OFF THE DOCK IN GRIM PANTRY TO THE WINDOW AT THE MAIN STRUCTURE YOU ARE SO GOOD WOW
---
ALSO FUCK KILLERS WHO USE BAMBOOZLE. RUNNING L-T WALLS IS LIKE THE BEST THING I'M AT AS A SURVIVOR AND YOU RUIN IT! JUST LEARN TO RUN TILES, NERD
---
Mine is also pronounced KAY-LUM
---
I'm always hooking everyone, and killing the last one with the Mori =)
---
(I know, i'm evil. Sorry :P)
---
Damn that’s a rough one. I got 3 Iri King Doctors almost back to back to back, all of them had NoEd too it was such a fun experience...
---
“It is game throwing”. Then it’s bannable. Gamethrowing is against the rules.
---
Carl will be our reward for reaching rank 1 survivor next season.
---
Her cosmetics put the 'flat' in 'flattering'.
---
This also happened to me on xbox. My two friends and I were playing swf one of our first times playing the game at all and a doctor just kept shocking and chasing us. It took us a while to realize he wasnt going to kill us. The skill checks were ass though because we were new.
---
I don’t know what I’m watching … but I love it
---
Honestly, i still think billy will be the killer. The entity has never had a non human killer before, so while that doesn't make it impossible for the demagorgin, idk if they'll break precedent. Plus billy actually shoulder carries somebody in the show
---
I hate that achievement
---
Isn't it kind of a nonbo with legion because he can't see blood marks in his power?
---
I like Surveillance because it lets me know if even one survivor has gone back on the gen. I don't want anyone on gens; I want gens to be dangerous to do as Freddy.
---
While I'm a bigger fan of their original content, I'd be lying if I said I didn't get giddy when they announce another official killer from a franchise. Simply being able go play an iconic character appeals to the nostalgia of people who saw those films. 5 years ago who would have thought you could have played a game where Freddy, ghostface, Myers, and leather face are all playable characters. People overlook this but that's freaking awesome. That being said I still prefer original killers because they get more freedom with their design,powers, and cosmetics. It's no coincidence that top tier killers such as nurse, billy, spirit and huntress are all original.
---
Yesterday: Killer Rank 20, Survivior Rank 20.
---
Today: ***Fuck this shit i'm out***
---
Imagine being the brainlet who complains about spine-chill, it seems some players are on a crusade to get every survivor perk buried 6 foot under.
---
You have no idea what I have planned for you. It'll be in the news for weeks: I'll make sure of it.
---
I didn’t know people hated it
---
damn, that's a lot of effort. I thought this would be just another complain post. Nice ideas btw
---
everyone uses ruin without thinking, Sloppy is always a good choice if you have no specific Plan and 2 random add ons arent tryhard lol, maybe you're trolling me?
---
&gt;they won’t sell their rights to a video game. 
---
Tell that to Fortnite's Jim and Demogorgon skins.
---
Do people also call you Caleb all the time and you have to correct them?
---
Maybe I'll edit it just for you lol
---
I agree with this 100%, but as a (slowly turning to be) legion main, with the right perks and add ons I believe that can be fixed in a way
---
So it's too easy?
---
This is me trying to do my trapper daily. I would just stand in the corner of the map waiting and they still wouldn’t get gens done. I move 5 feet and there’s the Meg, unable to run more than 10 seconds before I down her. I would even wait on swings and still...took me 6 games to get 3 trapped people because they just didn’t loop anything. They didn’t get far.
---
NEVER GO INTO THE BASEMENT AGAINST A LEATHERFACE, YOU FUCKING IDIOTS. JUST DO THE FUCKING GENS AND LET ME DIE ON THE HOOK
---
My statement is as speculative as it possibly gets but thanks for the warning
---
&gt;Theres an extremely high chance that its a stranger things chapter. 
---
Ew. I don't understand how such a meh series managed to get so popular.
---
Well yeah, if you are trying too hard to win and not playing for fun. You are a try hard.
---
I'm glad you can rela5e 5o 5hat.
---
There’s been a few times I thought me and the killer/a rando player were having fun in a match only to be cussed out post-game.
---
It can be really hard to read people’s intentions.
---
Most killers consider pipping a win. In red ranks, you can play really well and still only safety pip with 3 kills but that's an issue with the rank system. There's also players who are so bloodthirsty they get salty if 1 survivor gets away.
---
You are truly an unfortunate case. Have a great day, sweetheart.
---
No, you can't
---
that's a pretty good explanation for it, but i doubt they'd make a character not available to everyone
---
No, I get double pips because I do gens, loop the killer and heal teammates instead of selfcaring in a corner
---
I’m not cherry picking his theory, I’m just saying it’s literally been confirmed that there will be stranger things content, so grasping at all this weird evidence isn’t necessary. Stranger things is still insanely popular and everyone’s already talking about season 4. It’s just that this isn’t the only post I’ve seen about this, it’s just becoming an oversaturated thing. Theorize all you want, but we already know that it’s coming. Also, they posted this online and so people are allowed to discuss it and disagree with it. I’m not being mean, they just posted it for discussion and I’m discussing it.
---
what are u missing?
---
As a quentin who runs a full ace in the hole, pharmacy, plunderers and dead hard build i feel like im being attacked rn
---
God reminds me of the Freddy match I just had. I killed everyone at 5 gens and only hooked this Claudette once so I let her have the hatch. My Ruin was in the most obvious location and no one could find it. I literally teleported to a gen just to have the Jake who was on it not move and let me grab him. *Twice.*
---
This was then proceeded by a match with my P2 Wraith running Purple and Green addons (Purple Windstorm + Decloak Speed) and absolutely stomping another group of Survivors. My Save the Best Obsession was a Dwight who had literally no idea what to do. I managed to grab him off a gen after uncloaking literally right behind him and he just didn't react. End-game I saw he was a Rank 20 with This Is Not Happening 1 and nothing else. That one perk Dwight who probably just installed the game shouldn't have been playing with my P2 top tier addons Wraith.  
---
Also found the last Survivor (a P0 Bill using Bill's 3 unique perks) by following a huge line of scratch marks to a locker.
---
Oh i know.. I hate any board that has corn on it..
---
There were no quotes on this so at first I thought I was getting threatened on a reddit post XD
---
Open handed
---
This I totally agree with. The killer's task is to stop gens from being completed, and this perk rewards... Failure? It doesn't make sense. I'll run killer around and complete gens all game, the be denied my (earned) escape but a slap from NOED and a camp
---
Could also get a possessed billy since demogorgan would be our first non humanoid killer
---
Bill’s loud as fuck, and he coughs
---
As a 500+ hour killer main, I started really trying out survivor (about 30 hours as it so far + some shards spent on random perks). I saved a baby dweet who got slugged and I managed to loop long enough to pick him up and then he got the hatch.
---
https://imgur.com/kZP4BX8
---
Truly I now know the definition of love.
---
Lmao is that so.
---
Can they give that to cloaked wraith please? Tired of losing to SWF OoO
---
I feel bad for McCote since he really doesn't *try* to be condescending but sometimes he just comes off that way. I know it's going to sound like r/casualracism when I say this but it's because he's French: his voice sounds rather smug and condescending at times because of his accent and this community can't separate his voice from his words.
---
He did explain that the "go play Civ" comment was less "lol fuck you stop crying and go play something else ya baby" and more along the lines of "if our game is stressing you out you shouldn't be playing it. You shouldn't be playing a video game that makes you unhappy." He just worded it poorly and this community, being this community, overreacted like hell.
---
LMAO the same thing happened to me, and the huntress camped the hook as the cherry on top
---
Sacrifices must be made
---
BHVR: How many sporty Megs do you want? Devs: Yes
---
Isn't this impossible?
---
Ever since I started using it I’ve had multiple games where I know for a fact Pop stopped the majority of gens and clutched the game for me
---
Some people dont do it fir the 4k.. Some people just like ruining other people's fun by face camping, bming, ebony mori's. With survivours they gen rush, play unfun, abuse maps. I let them have thier fun, say gg and move on. Pointless feeding them.
---
What’s really good too is that the killer that has it as his teachables has some of the best devious farming, behind the dockta.
---
correct!
---
All of which are consistent problems with the game except the double bp. What’s your point?
---
The Power of swf groups i see xd
---
My favorite type of people are the ones who tbag, go down in 5 seconds then dc
---
Legendary stuff, dude, nice! 
---
Which achievement you'd say was the hardest?
---
To be fair nurse doesn't need any perk to slow down the game.. In my opinion if you're learning how to play her and want to "slow down the game just a little bit" you should run thanatophobia or ruin (if not both(
---
Uh.....survivors have a problem with +15 seconds on a key? News to me...
---
Nope I'm on ps4, I tend to watch YouTube while waiting. I'm not even sure why it happens, but everyone I've spoken to on here agrees that they take forever, it's horrible.
---
She's an athlete with zero muscle definition. Just look at her recent banner where she's somewhat toned then look at her in-game outfit where she's a twig
---
I hate that "Taking One for the Team" exists. They actually encourage you to farm your teammates with unsafe unhooks 250 fuckin times.
---
No, i Just thought It would fit better in this meme, didn't know that it was already done
---
I'm still a little bitter over losing Freddy's aura-reading, but with the right build, I can still play him how I want to. I've become the ping pong in my analogy, rather than just propelling myself like one.
---
Depends on your play style. Which killer do you think you’d enjoy playing? You probably have played against them all at some point. Who seems like fun?
---
In terms of perks, Clown has Pop and Bamboozle, Spirit has Haunted Grounds and Spirit Fury, Plague has Infectious Fright and Corrupt Intervention. Legion has Discordance. All of these are solid perks.
---
You have to accept the fact that licensed characters still draw the most audience. This game wasn't even on my radar until I heard that they were adding Michael Myers. To this day I still talk to people who say that the main factor that made them consider buying Dead by Daylight was the ability to play as Freddy Kruger or place Reverse Bear Traps on people. The fantasy to live out your favourite movies can't go unmentioned.
---
Monstrous shrine? Check.  
---
Agitation? Check.  
---
Insidious? Check.  
---
Yup. It's basement time.
---
Really? I would think survivors with &lt;4 perks wouldn't be much of an issue.
---
as a killer you are on your own and if you fuck up, you lose
---
as a survivor you can get carried by your teammates and think you're doing fine when you're actually wasting time
---
survivors also care less about the game
---
The number of DC's is too damn high! I accidentally caused a large argument about this.
---
Well, I'm hoping that it's something to do with the fact that it's always pairing me with killers from the opposite ends of the earth, and with dedicated servers it might give me better chances of finding people closer to me, maybe it's help. Idk man I'm praying for anything at this point
---
Mine is when 1 person disconnects and the whole team gives up.
---
That happens so often! And I don’t get it. Like the game has just started. You could easily still survive the round and get lots of BPs. But no, let’s rage quit and screw over the rest of our team.
---
For me i think Taking one for the team or the huntress one were u have to but someone into a dying state by throwing a hatchet 24m or more away
---
Thats fudgin weird
---
It just throws me off my rythm, idk how to explain it but very rarely do I chain kills together with BBQ. I think it's probably that most survivors play as if they're facing BBQ every game now.
---
Yeah. I don't want to use this term loosely but... Hypocritical
---
wait people getting mad at license killers and survivors now?
---
Silent Approach. Kinda only able to grab survivors while using Scratched Mirror or Prayer Beads and I got none of them, even after a few mil bps spent.
---
That poor Feng just took it. She was 100% allowing you to decide on mercy or not she could’ve made it in there. Poor Feng died trusting you.
---
Of course Dwight is in the locker! When isn’t he?
---
it still did when Wake Up was bugged
---
if it wasn't mentioned in the patchnotes, it still does
---
I do think it’s funny when they release a new character cosmetic pack, and people respond with stuff like “we don’t need outfits. Just fit hitboxes!” As if the people who design the cosmetics are the same ones that fix bugs.
---
I've got 9 days before I can prove if [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cfimpn/when_bhvr_announces_the_stranger_things_chapter/) was accurate.
---
Hopefully Freddy as well, when he's invisible to awake survivors.
---
Most of the games were just unhook a survivor and get ur self hooked and killed or tunneld
---
Same, games are so boring and sometimes takes awhile with all baby survivors. They crouch the whole time, and go to the most random corners of the game, hide in random closets for no reason, and you don’t get much bloodpoints out of it.
---
As a Freddy main: You mispelt Surveillance.
---
thats mad cringe
---
PLAYED A MATCH AS LEATHERFACE LAST NIGHT. I HOOKED 1 IN THE BASEMENT. AS I PATROLLED I SAW A SURVIVOR RUNNING INTO MY BASEMENT TO SAVE, HOOKED HIM, PATROLLED AGAIN SAW ANOTHER SURVIVOR RUNNING TO SAVE, HOOKED HIM. GOT ACCUSED OF CAMPING. DON'T RUSH INTO BUBBA'S BASEMENT!!
---
Old hatch standoffs
---
She misjudged how long it would take her friend to die on hook; and you can’t actually jump into hatch from the ground if your directly on top of it. Should’ve stood to the side and took a hit
---
They're fun enough for me to main but their weaknesses are quite apparent.
---
Who the fuck thought a chase Killer being unable to see both scratches *and* blood stains needs to be fired out of a fucking cannon.
---
I wrote a lot of my points about my problems with Legion in [this thread.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cpcuxr/i_feel_this/) You can look for my comments (Ctrl + F "TigerKirby215") to see just some of the problems I have with them as a Legion main.
---
since hopper just “died” i could see him as the survivor
---
Its not supply demand if both of his queues take 20 minutes.
---
Normally, for most people, killer is ~3-4 minutes time, survivor is near instant, which is caused by supply demand.
---
Usually if someone disconnects I let the other guys win (unless they were being toxic prior to that) and let them farm as many points as possible just to say “fuck you” to the quitter that just lost BP.
---
noob
---
I’m conflicted. 
---
As a killer main I think she’s the level of good we need and she’s so fun to play as. 
---
But as someone who also plays survivor a ton and hates HATES Spirit because of how seemingly impossible it is to win a chase or break a chase with her once you’re hit. 
---
And I’d argue that Spirit takes a lot of guess work too it’s not just sunshine and roses unless they’re injured.
---
Also the demogorgan was referenced to as "the bear behind the Harrington kids house" by murray, as that was the cover story given by Hawkins electric on what the creature was.
---
You're understanding him wrong, he would rather face a challenge (4 man SWF) than a bunch of noobs
---
**I NEARLY GOT MY FIRST ADEPT EVER AND A SURVIVOR DC'D!**
---
I'M LITERALLY NOT GOING TO TRY GOING FOR ADEPT UNTIL THEY FIX THE DC ISSUE WITH THEIR HUSK IDEA (WHERE YOU CAN STILL HOOK THEM)
---
BECAUSE AS IT IS, **YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO GET THE ADEPT MULTIPLE TIMES (BECAUSE SURVIVORS USUALLY DC)** AND HOPE FOR THE ONE MAGICAL TIME WHERE NOBODY DC'S.
---
See, I’ve never understood why someone would bother playing a game just to purposefully ruin other people’s fun. It’s really sad that such a thing exists so predominantly in this community.
---
I'm saying 4man swf is challenging, that's why it is better than playing against these ranks
---
i dont feel like its a useless perk until endgame.  
---
i like finding out where the survivors are.  so when they finish the gen i can see what gen they're working on somewhere else, or find tha trandom survivor trying to heal somewhere in a corner.
---
That’s why she stopped moving entirely even after adrenaline kicked in? And I’ve seen people jump in hatches on top of them once being hit plenty of times actually. I’ve done it. She could’ve jumped in regardless.

The purpose of posts on social media is to inform people of upcoming events, cosmetics, content or developer updates. The devs are already well aware of the issues facing the game and are already working to solve them all the while bringing players additional content. Comments like that are better suited for the forums where the devs are most likely to see it. Social media is purely marketing and information. It’s nice to see what people think of new content or updates but it’s usually drowned out by useless comments like those.

Hey tha’ts mean !
---
I'VE BEEN ON A WORKING VACATION SINCE JULY AND I DON'T GET BACK UNTIL SEPTEMBER. I MISS THIS GAME AND I'M PISSED OFF AT ALL YOU GUYS FOR STILL GETTING TO PLAY IT. I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE GHOSTFACE MEMES BECAUSE I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED HIM. REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I think a battle Royale game mode would be better
---
I’ve only faced one Bloodhound Z Block Freddy and it was one of the easiest escapes I’ve had in a while. If you’re gonna do bloodhound z block might as well add sloppy butcher too. That’s what he was missing from his build imo.
---
The only thing that needed changes was the Moonwalk Exploit and the "Nurse for Stupid People" 4 stab Kill. Those were both fixed but a bunch of extra nerfs made Legion incredibly weak. Whoever the fuck thought a chase Killer being unable to see both scratches *and* blood stains needs to be fired out of a fucking cannon. Also who was asking for Legion to vault slower? Like actually literally who?
---
I wrote a lot of my points about my problems with Legion in [this thread.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cpcuxr/i_feel_this/) You can look for my comments (Ctrl + F "TigerKirby215") to see just some of the problems I have with them as a Legion main. [This comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cpcuxr/i_feel_this/ewpgigz/) covers a lot of my main views about new Legion.
---
Oh after I closed it yeah she gave up.
---
Meg's face looks photoshopped in, it's uncanny.
---
need to put a spoiler warning on this thread for those who haven't watched season 3 of stranger things
---
Ok. That makes sense.
---
Bitch has bigger arms than me
---
His knees always kill me
---
Perhaps it's not so much about time to move, but rather distance traveled. Go open a window and stick your arm through it. That's a good amount of distance a killer's arm and weapon can travel through, depending on how close they are to the window/if they were lunging.
---
Ps4 does have longer wait times, we just have to wait for these fabled dedicated servers that have been spoken about...
---
I feel attacked
---
Wont dedicated servers actually raise queue ti.es. because it will be searching for people in the same servers which will be significantly lower than anyone on any server? I'm not entirely sure what exactly dedicated servers does other than it will be connecting to behaviors servers rather than the killers but I'm pretty sure its location based.
---
One possible reason is Killers gives way more BP.
---
Another reason is remaking our SWF lobbies always take like 5 minutes...
---
Original doesn't mean balanced
---
As someone with a shitty computer, ruin makes me cry
---
What leaks? The only (non-BS) sound leak I could find sounded more like what the Archives would sound like. But again, if I missed something, illuminate me.
---
SAMWISE GAMGEE TO THE RESCUE!
---
Host Billy was the best part of season 3
---
Agreed
---
This right here, no matter how many times this gets told they still complain.
---
As a survivor main, Freddy would be really good to match up with pop goes the weasel
---
When your the worst killer in the game but you still get bullied
---
WHY BULLY KILLERS YOU KNOW ARE BABIES!! IM TRYING TO LEVEL UP MY BUBBA FOR BBQ AND I’M HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE ADJUSTING TO KILLER, HOW TOXIC OF A SURVIVOR DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO TBAG AT EVERY PALLET AND WAIT UNTIL LAST SECOND IN EGC TBAGGING ME? I’M NOT CAMPING, TUNNELLING, IM TRYING TO PLAY FAIR AND LETTING EVERYONE GET AS MUCH POINTS AS THEY CAN BECAUSE I RESPECT THE SURVIVORS, WHY NOT RESPECT ME TOO?
---
She has a thicc....
---
....meaty....
---
....vagina....
---
Ok. Thanks for all the info, you've been very informative.
---
I just made it. I guess great minds think alike
---
And also, killer happens to be 5x easier than survivor, but let’s keep buffing
---
It won't be next but probably after, why would they do 3 licensed Dlc's in a row? Just doesn't make sense. I have 32k shards to spend on DLC and am hoping we get some OC
---
I think it’s shit for survivor as well. It’s only good if you have balanced landing and if you don’t you only have very few pallets and shitty fence windows.
---
Depends on the killer a bit. As huntress i tunnel those lockers after hooking someone, as had and sometimes trapper i have to decorate the ground next to the hook. 
---
And sometimes there's just a pallet to break near the hook, so at best BBQ gives you a general idea at what is goind on at the map.
---
It was on pc on mother’s dwelling, i was a backpack meg and there was an ash and claudette i can’t remember the last guy.
---
Why is Tarantino hating himself so much?
---
How can i send u the pictures
---
Oof
---
Just sharing this gem... If anything we think this is fair. We were trying to depip the night before reset.
---
We  figure we are all one shot, we are all showing our location to the  killer. Nobody is running an exhaustion perk. The killer can win this  game easily by hooking somebody and going after someone new. If the  killer goes after a new target or the person who does the unhooking he  has nothing to worry about and it should be an easy pip/4k.
---
We believe the killer got greedy for the person fresh off of hooks and ending up eating 4 decisive strikes...
---
I  believe we made it an easy game for the killer but he ended up giving  us all pips plus the escape... While he didn't get much score at all.
---
He  then messaged us and said that we were more toxic than Bubbas Basement.  Kind of makes you think. Toxic is a blanket statement that get used way  to often. We were not being toxic.We were really trying to depip. It  was up to the killer. If he had a bad game it was only because of his  own actions. Tunneling is toxic. Tunneling lost him the game, even tho  everybody was one shot and he knew where we were the whole time. For me  as killer i would constantly hook somebody and jet off to the other side  of the map to find another one shot victim.
---
What would you do? Get D striked 4 times and t bagged at the exit, or 4k ?
---
Fuck. I should have seen the match through then. I DC'd out of frustration and took a long break.
---
so get used to being injured
---
It’s like when people don’t like guest characters in fighting games
---
You are aware that just killing all 4 survivors doesn't give the adept, right? You have to double pip. So if a survivor DCs early, it's going to be very hard to double pip anyways.
---
I heard it’s to de-pip
---
WHEN YOU’RE ABOUT TO UNHOOK THEM PERIOD AND THEY DO THAT SHIT. I’M RIGHT HERE BUT OK!!!
---
Maybe one they we’ll see Alien
---
Only sacrifice the teabagger though, just so they don’t think they’re too good
---

Yeah its annoying. My swf group bitches about at least once a night
---
Spine chill and hiding, dont need to escape a chase if you never get found \*insert black male pointing at his head\*
---
Ya know what is ironic, before the nerfed selfcare everyone ran it.  Now hardly anyone run it and instead use adrenaline and rush gens to get adrenaline to proc.
---
70% killer 30% survivor - guess you found the wrong survivor.
---
i wanna die
---
Meg x Dwight canon?
---
Stop spamming the subreddit when??
---
no
---
Post this again with more red circles and maybe people will care.
---
Please Know that this is a joke/shitpost. BHVR works hard on cosmetics and im not being ungrateful.
---
&gt; But no one would want Bob and Barb in the game. 
---
Speak for yourself lol
---
They need to complete all the gens for that. I get them before they do. I generally give the last hatch unless they are toxic so it won't help me much when it comes to the last survivor.
---
I understand that people want to win, but if you were one of those people who waited 30+ minutes for those standoffs, you are a clown
---
Good killer dont need noed
---
I would delete but do what you want
---
Yea and they nerfed Adam's Black Lab Coat to be much brighter.. false marketing on that one. I ought to be reimbursed my shares for that. Also they need to fix the ps4 glitch which the default skins show up in the lobby. I would be really upset if I spent hella casholla on skins for them not to work. Kinda makes me bot want to buy any skins of their glitched out ya know..
---
no give us mrs claus and she crushes people w/ her tits
---
Dude I was under the impression thanatophobia was like.. a REALLY good perk for the longest time. Then after watching some streamers/YouTube I realized how miniscule the effect even is. Rip.
---
You really should though. Stranger Things was good.
---
I hope not. Demogorgon doesn’t fit the theme at all, even though I’m a huge fan of ST. It’s not a slasher series.
---
His toes are ugly
---
Survivors are usually  just so dumb making my life easy  or just makes a mistake like being greedy for saves and for 2 other reasons I play Ghostface and he can do one shots also plus the survivors I play with usually actively hunt for any totem and do it immediately.
---
Nurse main? Or are you just amazing at killer?
---
I just like to be in a chase so I guess I will buy
---
I have bad news for you...
---
Dedicated Servers won't fix this if you play on the wrong server or even if the server closest to you doesn't give you a decent ping under 150ms.
---
I'm going to side on you with this one. Out of curiosity though where did you see that Stranger Things content was confirmed?
---
In my opinion both perks are crutches but one is way more rewarding in my opinion you don’t need neither of them.
---
Quentin looking for a chest to get his green medkit
---
Cool, I can respect that.
---
I hate when this happens. Like just hook me or give me hatch. Don’t carry me around the map looking for hatch, only to close in front of me. Such a waste of time.
---
moreso dwight, claud hides in grass
---
Adrenaline is a reward for completing your goal.
---
NOED is a reward for failing your goal.
---
I really don't get why u can't see scratchmarks when using frenzy. I stopped playing him bc of this bullshit
---
I like my perks to all work together in some way and I like more active perks. Like make your choice, bamboozle, ect. Perks that I have to make use of and change the way I play.
---
Spirit and Hag, I do want to learn Nurse tho but Im not ready to invest my time
---
his power isn’t very good in my opinion
---
I like how both your posts and also this video's title are targeting the wrong problem. 
---
This hit wasn't caused by "broken hitboxes" and dedicated servers won't fix this if you live far away from your server. 
---
You can stop spreading misinformation now.
---
Thana is shit
---
And good survivors need adrenaline?
---
Because one perk pretty much decides whether you win or lose on this map.
---
To get merciless killer, you have to double pip. It is possible (depending on what rank you are) to not kill all 4 and double pip, and it's also possible to kill all 4 and not double pip. You were likely seeing old information from before it was changed.
---
they must learn the hard way
---
P U N I S H
---
yea but kindred only works if you’re hooked, so if ur w/ a swf it’s pointless, use bond instead
---
Other ways to do it my dude. I understand you want views, but annoying people isn’t the way to do it. Good luck with your content though.
---
To be honest I figured Ghostfaces set would be with the bikers outfits considering it kinda matches them really well but since he came out by himself it doesn't really matter right?
---
Thank you man, appreciate it. Yeah, I wasn’t looking to have my dick blown, I just wanted to post it because I thought it was cool.
---
I edited this for a friend of mine and figured you guys would enjoy it/have some good critic :- ) thanks to anyone that checks the video out
---
The way I see it is NOED punishes survivors for not clearing dull totems and Adrenaline gives a huge boost to players who are already 90% of the way towards escaping. Adrenaline rewards survivors for doing something that that have to do anyway to win. Then didn't do anything special.
---
"That Guy.."
---
How dare you insult Bruce Campbell like this.
---
It’s not that serious. Calm down. There are not rules on what people can or can’t post.
---
That’s easy. Just grab people in T 1.  I got that one very quickly and was surprised like less than 1% of people have it. Most people just go for the stalk early instead but I like to get an early hook or two.
---
More so speculation but it seems definitely possibly considering currency leak which is dust and some sounds sounding pretty 80's ish also Netflix did a deal with BHVR
---
Bob would be op. He's a superhero.
---
Honestly tho, like, just because I say it’s a glitch; which, it clearly is, others can’t see it?! I didn’t even say, “this needs to be patched.” Or some shit, just, some shit about - “hey, look at this interesting perspective glitch.”
---
I'm pretty sure it's the last outfit set that releases according to leaksbydaylight which have been accurate about all the cosmetic releases so far and many other things
---
I just want a map. We haven't gotten one in six months.
---
demogrogongongongon
---
I'm not sure if we have the same definition of the word useless. I'm a doctor player, so thank you for the tip!
---
And noed rewards killers for doing something that they're **not** supposed to do.
---
i need lore to know why this is so kinky
---
Hahaa you put on BPS. You knew what you were doing hoping for easy survivors post rank reset.
---
I don’t run NOED but this attitude that you DESERVE to escape just because you got the gens done is not correct and it’s a very entitled opinion. You haven’t won until actually escaped. 
---
You don’t deserve anything until you get there. That’s like complaining in football that the offensive team got down to the 1 yard line and then get denied the touchdown. They didn’t let me score, The other team sucks. 
---
Don’t be stupid.
---
Would rather go with a build that's fun *before* all the gens pop.  Enjoying myself takes priority over getting downs.
---
Yeah mettle was OP, but they didn't have to absolutely kill it. Even if protection hits worked more than half of the time, it still wouldn't be good. They didn't just nerf it into the ground, they nerfed it 6 feet under.
---

---
Imagine if he can teleport like the way he did in mkx
---
A lot of the houses, even without balanced, are still shit for killer. Certain windows don’t even apply the falling penalty. The window by the top of the basement stairs in the Myer’s house is a great example. Get yourself a 110% killer who isn’t running bamboozle and that window is open? Have fucking fun.
---
I will admit the pallets feel sparse but a lot of the pallet loops are, again, strong on the map. A good runner can easily waste a killer’s time on Haddonfun, it’s just a matter of rng as far as window/fence openings when it comes to how long.
---
when ever i play killer and give up a chase after hitting someone its because i have too, but its  a huge bonus if the person wastes time healing with self care instead of doing a gen. When i play survivor its not hard to find someone to heal me just work on the gen with them and complete it then get healed after. I stopped playing the game when self care was super meta, i don't really know what happened to not make it meta anymore but survivor games are defiantly a lot more productive without 3 blendettes int he corner healing every time they get hit
---
Adrenaline isnt the survivor equivalent of noed.
---
And no, good survivors dont need adrenaline. But good survivors can benefit from adrenaline as it helps them if and when they complete their objective.
---
On the other hand, a good killer is going to have pressured and killed some survivors before the endgame, so they arent going to benefit from noed as much.
---
Freddy is my main, i also love Pig, so shut the f*ck up, cuz they are my favorites, and also they are LICENSED!
---
Probably pre work Freddy but with something like teleportation to generators or the ability to grab a survivor and bring them into the upside down where pallets and stuff give weaker stuns and less windows?
---
It was unfortunate because it was my “one last game and I’m done for the night” game. I was dead tired. I just wanted to Mori a bunch of people with Pig and call it a night. But NO!
---
I WENT TO MAKE A SANDWICH AND I FORGOT TO BUY BUTTER, THE SANDWICH WAS REALLY DRY
---
Killer's aren't supposed to stop their totems from being destroyed?
---
no problem glad i could be of assistance.
---
Not really if you’re playing as Myers and still in EW1. Just sneak up on people at the beginning of the game from behind walls, Spine Chill doesn’t activate. I just about get 1 or 2 per game.
---
huntress hitboxes as well
---
Heard this a thousand times, like people don't realize that Adrenaline can also reward shitty survivors who haven't done anything the whole match.
---
Haha oh I know, I’m not accusing you of anything lol. But when I say team, I mean the fellow survivors you are queues up with each round. Doesn’t matter if you are SWF or solo, they are your team because you all depend on each other to a certain extent.
---
NOED is deflating the football. Don't come at me
---
Ya you’re just dumb.
---
So is the comic I got the whole collection for 12 quid and it certainly was worth it
---
That means they finally fixed the totem spawns in Springwood.
---
I guess. Ormond is like a top 3 survivor map though.
---
y do ppl thing virgins an insult
---
I can literally run around the whole map and still can’t find it 😭
---
Why the bashing? I'm just having a conversation, this doesn't make me dumb
---
He’s fine, I love using him, sure he can be better no doubt but he’s not as bad as ppl say
---
I’ll give you all my iridescent shards just for a week with either ruin or BBQ
---
I'll 360 you with an Xbox one controller any dayyyyyyy
---
Ahahhahahahahahah just kidding I'll go down in 2 pallets
---
Because it’s an entitled and incorrect opinion about deserving to escape and it should hold no water in any argument but I see it here all the time. You haven’t won until you escaped. 
---
Plus if the balls are deflated that supposedly helps the offense not defense. See Tom Brady’s suspension. :p
---
Because it's the cheapest way to get kills and very annoying to go against.
---
*These kids were gonna troll me. 
---
I grabbed the sharpest tool in the shed.
---
They were looking kinda dumb 
---
So I took my instrument 
---
And then I stabbed it into both of their dumb heads....*
---
**Well...**
---
I liked him too he was a very unique character who stood out.
---
So your telling me that a killer that lands 1 single hit the entire game should win and I should lose? I don't think that's entitled at all, I think it shows a flaw in the game
---
There will always be shitty survivors who didn't do much from time to time. I personally don't consider escaping a reward if you get shit-all points to show for it, but that's just me.
---

Thanks for the tips. Why is Dwight the go-to then?
---
Killers aren’t supposed to let the gens get completed and still get kills
---
..... Okay?
---
Noeds been nerfed three times now.
---
So then why doesn't the game end as soon as the 5th gen is completed?
---
Oh god that is terrifying LOL
---
Actually 21k was not a lot. When I play against red ranks usually have over 27k
---
How so? What did they change about it?
---
Nice.
---
Because you’re still allowed to try to get more kills after the gens get completed.
---
I know there are some people that are against stranger things potentially being the next chapter since it isn't exactly "horror" or doesn't fit the theme of DBD, but I'd adore having best mom Steve as a survivor.
---
Remember the opening of the first episode where it slashed through the whole base with scientists running for there life.
---
It punishes survivors for not doing something that's not important for their success and rewards killers for being bad.
---
Unlike most people, I don't see Adrenaline as a reward for fulfilling your goal. You simply get it when gens are done, regardless of what you did in the trial.
---
Good survivors use Adrenaline because survivors frankly need more assistance at this point than killers. Good killers don't use NOED because they're capable without it
---
It sucks when we're only getting licensed killers for a while. Happened with Leatherface, Freddy, and Pig. Looks like it's gonna happen again with Ash, Ghostface, and the potential Stranger Things chapter. It's nice to see the devs expand the lore when they make original characters, plus you get to purchase them with shards instead of having to pay real world money. People are allowed to get annoyed at that issue when it seems favored towards one side.
---
Or I guess r/dbdgonegay
---
It's basically Predator at a certain point, group of soldiers gets picked off in a forest by a massive hunter.
---
Everyone’s not going to ask why the Totems look so angry?
---
Well both posts are, we once started a crusade on this subreddit because mods used to remove any picture that wasn't directly related to dbd even though the title made a connection with dbd and the picture. Maybe it's time for another if they do that again.
---
We both know what he's wanting
---
Oh my God, do you want to trigger the fuck out of Mortal Kombat fans?

Point out that every game since MK VS DC has had guest characters and more are obviously on the way. It's the easiest way to lower your Reddit Karma short of posting something actually offensive.

Too bad his power and add-ons don't really match his lore.

---
I personally prefer the original killers. They have brought more fun, stronger killers with better perks but I also love the licensed killers since they attract more people as you said and give you a really strong feeling since you are playing with a horror icon
---
Was playing a killer game when I heard failed skill checks as I was carrying a nea to the basement at shack. It was then that I saw 3 dweets all crouching with their faces touches each other. Dweets are the best. I am one of them.
---
First nerf was changing it from being active forever after gens being done to a 120 second timer,  the second nerf was turning it into a hex that uses dull totems, the third nerf they removed the attack cooldown bonuses but made it more available by granting the one shot property at all tiers.
---
But you want people to go into lockers though? It's a free down
---
i actually gave hatch to a dude last night.  i was spirit, they 3 genned themselves.  i had maybe 1 or 2 hooks up until that point.  killed 3 at that point.  last guy let me hit him, pointed to something ??? then went to vault over the dropped pallet.  i snatched him up and carried him to the other person who was on the hook.  dropped him, figured he'd see the hatch.  he didnt.  picked him up, dropped him RIGHT ON THE THING and he finally figured it out.
---
&gt;they are far more skilled in the game then me
---
You want them to be nerfed because theyre more skilled than you?
---
What does it matter though? It’s not like said guest characters are in the story unless it’s some sort of crossover game like Marvel vs Capcom. As long as they don’t affect the story, then I’m fine.
---
Solo survivors are pretty fun to mess around with but not on rank reset
---
O K
---
:( unfortunately
---
Honestly i just want to see her in something that isnt sportswear for once
---
Never got a 4k and depip even though I have 1000h in the game but I wouldn't be surprised if that was true
---
NOED TAPPED THE TAINTED WATER SUPPLY
---
Let's go popcorn face alien. I have 0 concept of what he does.
---
I was thinking about getting all the achievements for playstation, then I noticed the huntress trophy was down 100 ppl from 24+ meters
---
Because it's a substitute for learning the game.  It does nothing to teach you any mechanic to outplay your opponents.  It's just a free perk that rewards you for playing poorly.  I aim to end every game with gens up so I plan my loadout accordingly.  I have confidence in my killer play so I don't gameplan for a safety net when things go badly.  It forces me to play better and make smarter decisions midgame.  NOED is incredibly effective against soloqueue but even a decent swf team will use each other as totem counters to prevent your crutch from ever spawning and now you're stuck playing a 3 perk killer against a coordinated swf group and since you run NOED chances are you aren't the greatest at decision making or ending chases efficiently which means that's a gg and a road to a hard loss.  It teaches terrible habits so I avoided using it so I could learn how to properly play the game against strong opponents.
---
Picture of just a wall?
---
I used to participate in hatch standoffs when I was new because when you're new, you really care about the game, kills, maybe pips etc. Then I just didn't care. Even now If I kill 3 people, find the hatch first and the doors are close to each other, great a 4k. If not, then nice a 3k. It's soo nice when you just don't care about 4ks and I think more killers should work on this attitude because it really helps you long-term.
---
There's nothing there...
---
*opens sub* 
---
*nsfw warning, with my only option being back*
---
wow it must be so bad that reddit even is trying to protect me
---
The point of playing a game is to have fun. Its shitty to ruin the game for other people because "it's a strategy". How is the hooked survivor having fun? Or the killer? Or the gen rushers? 
---
I dont care if I win or lose a game as long as it's fun.
---
Its not rare for a rank 10 to be matched against a SWF where they're rank 4, rank 4, rank 4, rank 15. So yes SWF often have several players way more skilled than the killer. And the low rank of the team often isn't that bad.
---
This has got to be a troll post. No doubt about it
---
MEG'S NEW COSMETIC IS FUCKING BORING! I'M SITTING HERE WITH $20 IN MY STEAM WALLET FROM SELLING ALL MY KF2 NONSENSE BECAUSE THE GAME IS DEAD AND I CAN'T SPEND ANY OF IT BECAUSE KATE AND ACE'S COSMETICS AREN'T OUT YET, JUST MEGHEAD'S
---
Yah if the person didn't change or choose anything and just dive into their first game they would be playing as him cos he's the default character. So they usually don't have a perk and have no clue what's going on.
---
What do you mean beat? 2 or more escape? No way you 4k every game
---
I mind. I hate games where there is zero fear of the killer finding you because he's facecamping somebody else. It's a perfect way to make every match unfun.
---
Survivors shouldn't be punished for playing with their friends, that's a terrible idea. 
---
&gt; they wre far more skilled in the game than me
---
I don't want to be that guy, but this is really a "get good" situation.
---
And a rainbow map my dude
---
We still got crashed plane Ace/Nurse and crackhead skater Nea vs Voodoo Hag to go through
---
&gt; They are to efficient and effective. You chase one they do 3 gens. You patrol some gens they get to heal and apply pressure on the other side of the map, they don't 3 gen themself and heal immideadly in like 3 sec
---
So you played against a team who knew what they were doing and you got stomped. Somehow I dont think its *them* thats the problem in this scenario.
---
Who do you have?
---
It might help if you calm down a little bit. Discussions can't happen if your reasoning is being clouded by your salt.
---
Tbh what I do it I level up one person to 50 then keep using all the addons and items till there’s no more, then I keep using the bloodpoints I have on the next character I want and when I think they’re good enough to go out I prestige the one that’s at 50. 
---
I’ve been doing this with my characters so far and I’ve got 3 prestiged. I think it’s worth it to have the whole bloody collection aha.
---
Its not a bad perk.
---
It’s the same people that bitch that Ash is gonna be in Mortal Kombat too
---
4ks are overrated
---
That didn't address a single one of my points. No CC in this game should last longer than 3 seconds. I think reducing the power by 4 or 5 seconds for a miss would be more fair than canceling it altogether especially since even after the 4 second stun they can't use their power until the bar is full.
---
Reminds me of [this](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/QKVhFGi). They could even name the entire outfit Father Death, it'd be a cool throwback. I'd buy instantly.

This is why I run small game.  Did someone call for a Hex Perk Exterminator?
---
Quality of life
---
The speed boost only last for 5 seconds but what about the heal? Do they get injured after 5 seconds? No. I have played plenty of games where all 4 survivors get healed and all pressure I had is now gone. I have games where the someone 99%s a gen while I am chasing an injured survivor and as soon as I hit them they complete the gen and the survivor gets up and runs away while I'm wiping my weapon. They lost the chase and got rewarded for it.
---
Also about that wraith that just sits in a corner waiting for NOED.....if he's not playing then why don't people break the totems? Nothing is stopping them from stopping NOED from even existing.
---
Cutting that cord is the first step to becoming q consistently more valuable teamate.  That perk wastes a tremendous amount of time.  Just spend it on the objectives.  If someone's right there cool take a heal.  If not who cares being injured isn't a big thing.
---
100 ppl wtf on pc its 20
---
Speaking of licensed killers, it would be badass to see The Fiend from WWE be added. It would be great cross promotion.

---
It is not going to a gen in a minute.
---
It is that you can not get use out of it since you can sometimes hook people before kicking a gen.
---
The effect is good but it is not worth missing a hook.
---
Alert is better imo
---
It’s mid tier. Good for new maps or people who aren’t familiar enough with typical map layouts. Very good for The Game and Treatment Theatre if you go in with a plan. Anytime I plan on going there I take Dark Sense and tap all of the Gens so they can be found easily or distract the killer.
---
Ik the first one is no longer in effect, but I think they should still follow their own logic of nerfing perks that reward bad play. Even if they don’t want to give it some sort of pre req then they should at least nerf it in some one. Honestly I think the best idea to make everyone happy would just add a totem counter, or some way to know how many totems are left
---
it is when you arent as good at the game as some people, i think i’ll wait till im good at looping and such before i remove it
---
You are welcome to explain how old power was better when not cheesing.
---
&gt;Against even semi-decent survivors these don't matter. I spend most of my time in trials injured and have a build around that
---
Congrats. Doesn't change the fact that legion will have better information about survivors around, one of the best tracking tools in the game. How does mobility not matter again? Also ofc you spend the trial injured he forces you to. If you don't see how it opens up possibilities for legion I can't argue further. 
---
So how is it being weaker than he was previously?
---
HAD TWO GAMES BACK TO BACK WHERE THE KILLER DCED LIKE A LITTLE BITCH.
---
GAME ON THE MOTHER'S DWELLING MAP, TRAPPER, WE COULDN'T FIND HIS RUIN BUT WE MANAGED TO POWER THROUGH HIS GENS. HE KEPT TRYING TO SLUG BUT WE ALREADY TOOK OUT HIS NOED, HE EVENTUALLY JUST DCED RIGHT AS JEFF GOT THE DOOR OPEN.
---
NEXT GAME WAS A BUBBA AND WE TOOK OUT HIS RUIN LIKE RIGHT AS THE GAME STARTED, HE DIDN'T DC YET, BUT AS SOON AS WE WERE ON THE LAST GEN AND SOMEONE **ACTUALLY** MANAGED TO GET SOMEONE OUT OF THE BASEMENT THE LIL SHIT DCED. I WOULDN'T BE MAD ABOUT THESE IF I ACTUALLY FUCKING GOT POINTS. I HAD OVER 13,000 POINTS ON THE TRAPPER GAME THAT I DIDN'T EVEN GET TO EARN CAUSE BITCH BOY DECIDED TO DC, AND THE BUBBA HAD A BLOODY STREAMER TOO SO I DIDN'T GET MY DOUBLE POINTS.
---
WHY THE FUCK DOES THE KILLER DCING NOT GIVE ME MY POINTS? I WASTED LIKE 30 MINUTES ON THAT ONE TRAPPER GAME.
---
Ya it blows
---
Sennheiser HD58x jubilee
---
&gt;According to killer mains on this sub
---
Not good ones.
---
Alert and OoO are better though. It's also rare but if the killer has rancor then it's useless
---
It's a one time situational heal that you might not even need.  NOED on the other hand allows a mindless zero effort instadown with haste you can use against all 4 survivors permanently as long as the totem is up.  It's just incredibly bad design man.  There was a time killers needed it because survivors were crazy unbalanced.  This changed a long time ago when devs finally started focusing on removing all their broken mechanics starting back with the pallet vacuum removal update.
---
I understand you can cleanse dulls in that scenario but you don't honestly think it's a bit absurd that it is possible to literally not play the game and then suddenly get a down or two because your crutch spawned as a reward for the hard work you did of standing in a corner?  Just a badly designed perk that rewards bad players and doesn't teach them any of the skills they WILL need to beat a coordinated swf group.
---
Did it even say you had it? Because if it did thats just a bug, if it didnt then his terror radius wasnt in range.
---
Little so they know that was their plan along.
---
A sacrifice for the greater good.
---
Billy is better against worse survivors, spirit is better against good survivors
---
I hate not having new maps
---
Anyone who just stands on the hatch before it's opened is just asking for this to happen. Hide nearby, or go to a door if the killer is near.
---
Thank you I'll take this in mind
---
Exactly. After all those nerfs to survivor in general but esp solo it's not very much fun.
---
You know what? I would like to see a less humanoid more creature based killer.

---
What the fuck happened to it's face?
---
&gt; You are welcome to explain how old power was better when not cheesing.
---
It was easier to hit more survivors with the higher speed and shorter length. You could see blood marks. etc
---
&gt; Also ofc you spend the trial injured he forces you to.
---
I meant that I, in general, always spend trials injured.
---
Anyway, you are very aggressive about a video game character, so good day
---
Many people, it's still meta.
---
It was god leading the way home, back to the campfire.
---
Please tell me you reported them. Language like that doesn't belong in public spaces.
---
or you can just play a normal game and offer the few living survivors the gens. then farm
---
Intriguing combination.
---
I'm a survivor main. Play killer sparingly and even I think its bs how hard adept is now, particularly for killers
---
Gens are their official objectives along with killing survivors.  You cannot draw a parallel between protecting gens and cleansing totems because totems are not technically an objective.  All objectives in the game are tracked totems are not which means they are not officially a survivors objective.  SWF will consistently cleanse your crutch from spawning they use each other in chat as totem counters.  But soloqueue is another animal entirely.  I take out 2-4 totems every game and still eat NOED because randoms for whatever reason simply don't touch them.    Killers will get their mindless proc every time against solo players.  Those of us that don't run NOED are so much better at the game man.  It's not bragging it's a matter of fact.  Not running it forces us to execute better.  We don't overcommit to chases and we know how to pressure gens relentlessly.  Because of this we are better suited to matching up against a swf group who is the bane of a NOED gamers existence because not only will they cleanse your dulls preventing your safety net from even spawning but they will most likely have some capable loopers which you won't know how to deal with since you rely on your NOED to activate to salvage out your games.  Honestly it just stunts the developement of ones killer play.  You can typically tell a killer is running it by watching how badly they perform with their decision making and chases in game.  There's a reason for that.
---
Spine Chill alone doesn’t effect much. But when I tried with Resilience, it did vault pretty faster while in chase tho xD
---
I just bagged at the exit gates with three survivors with pig
---
I don't disagree I'm just saying that's what I've been told.
---
this is so sad
---
like for heaven 
---

---
Gamethrowing is an abstract term. You're Gamethrowing by playing too unfocused or by being too immersive.
---
Ban-related rules can't be abstract, and if they are, those are bad rules, because they leave too much responsibility to individual decisions.
---
All said above, I believe you are just using the wrong term to describe the situation because you want it to be so opposite to operating facts.
---
That's why I asked you for solid quotes from the rulebook - wishful thinking doesn't correlate well with rules. E.g. I won't be banned because it was harder for salty survivors to believe they were outplayed than they were playing against a hacker. And I believe it's a sign of a healthy moderation.
---
good for being a gen jockey
---
I'd prefer a unique killer to a licensed, but I'm not gonna complain about a licensed killer.
---
I know you want to be funny, but it's rude as fuck to call people "it", just because they dress or act like the opposite gender.
---
Yep. Still waiting for her rugby, soccer, golf, volley ball, football, lacrose, cycling, archery, bowling, curling, equestrian, gymnastics, fencing, wrestling, and ice hockey uniforms!
---
I got to do the tours last year too, scary tales was one of them. Seeing that castle with the lights on was amazing, the amount of detail they put into those houses is nothing short of incredible. Slaughter cinema was fun and the junkyard was a blast too. If you’re thinking about going again, they have an amazing lineup this year (including killer Klowns house instead of zone this year)

New skin
---
The hardest choices require the strongest will.
---
Some people actual use the term "it" to describe themselves, so...
---
But can run into the same problem tho
---
Within the killers terror radius. Pig, Michael, wraith could screw this up when they use their ability, which eliminates their terror radius.
---
I could do the bones or git gut
---
or I could just ask the devs to remove it cuz I don't like doing bones
---
Ash has literally been requested since MK9, only brats would complain about him
---
I'm not sure if you are being sarcastic or not
---
40/50/60 seconds, it used to be 30 so it wasn't used as it wasn't a lot of time to get to a gen. The recent buff to 60 is what made it meta.
---
I’ve watched this 3 times and I’m still trying to find out what the fuck this creature is
---
For me it was 50% interesting 2Ks vs. 50% rank 15 tryhard wannabe's. Playing against the latter feels kinda depressing because I play survivor a lot and know how painful it must be to get matched with a team that do everything except for actually fucking doing gens.
---
you're missing Solidarity and OoO
---
Rank 1 with both, I do fine and this post was a joke lmfao.
---
I usually hate self promoters but this was great, good job!
---
I'd argue that he IS punished for existing. Having to walk around to collect your power is absurd. It can take much longer than a couple seconds to pick up a trap half way across the map. That being said, Legion is in a far worse boat. Punished for using his power, punished for hitting someone outside of his power. Designed to lose.
---
Probably doesn't want to stop searching and alert the killer.
---
Closing the box causes a loud noise notification
---
When everyone can always see the killer and start moving well ahead of him exhaustion perks aren't needed. Also it's common practice to tunnel OoO users since they are the scout of their SWF team. Dealing with 4x OoO with 4x DS seems like a shitty time to be killer. 
---
Not saying your toxic just takes all the fun away from the killer when everyone can see where he goes.
---
funny how you call it a nerf since it became way more "mandatory" than before
---
Later on I'll post the Perks and Power
---
Doctor here, it's sadism. But also bloodpoints.
---
Lmfao. Nice
---
Yes you’re right! We need creatures like the Thing or a Tremor!
---
I mean, nowadays we can't assume anyone's gender, sooo...
---
I agree, even without addons she's the absolute least fun killer to play against. Prayer beads just makes it worse. 
---
Your counters are pretty much running ironwill and hoping the killer is an idiot. 
---
My biggest problem is you have no idea of knowing if your "juke" is working until it's too late. I feel like i have more control over a chase against a nurse than i do a spirit.
---
Michael was my reason for getting this game rather than Friday the 13th since I loved the Halloween movies more but though I still love Michael, I'm drawn more to Plague, Spirit, and Wraith
---
Bill wants to be hit. He lives for the fight and you know it.
---
mmmmm what a tasty 12% and if you kill someone 9%, kill another, 6%. There are much better perks to use in place of thana.
---
Damn why can’t I get teammates like you in my solo games?
---
He's amazing. I grinded him when he came out and I can say that he is the best m1 killer in the game and is the 6th best killer imo. Dream projection is awesome, giving him map pressure, nobility and makes using perks like Pgtw, discordance, surveillance etc really strong. Dream snares help him with loops a lot and can get rid of pallets faster and force slow vaults. It also makes clown kinda obsolete (which is really sad because I love Clown). Dream pallets are really funny and hilariously entertaining when they work and although worse than snares imo, are still solid. Not hearing a terror radius but a lullaby instead in the dream world makes it really hard to pin point where exactly he is, and makes him unpredictable. Survivors failing skill checks, waking each other up and going to the clocks gives him a little nice map pressure and buys him some time. Overall, I think behavior really outdid themselves with freddy
---
Dwights*, learn English.
---
Same here. Dunno what to do \^\^
---
As much as people will try to tell you NOED and adrenaline are equivalent they’re not even close. You can go afk as killer all the way until the last gen and potentially still leave the game with 1-2 kills with NOED. You still have to survive 85% of the game to use adrenaline, and you can’t rely on it the whole game to get you there. People on this sub say you can camp til endgame and not contribute but if you do that you wont be injured as the last gen pops
---
Muscle Davids are very easy to spot, so it's easy to keep a chase going for BP
---
Seriously?  My fun went soft now.
---
Wraiths and clowns camp more than bubbas
---
i hope BHVR make a deal with victor miller to add Jason, he is one of the most iconic killers in history.
---
I always spam the bell when i lose
---
Meg doesn't need any more skins why are they giving her so many skins and there all sports themed like wth
---
Yeah, david is white af, can see from the other side of the map
---
The best I’ve seen in ages.
---
Only in the banner, in-game she's a stick
---
If I have to explain to you the benefit of running a perk that slows down repair speeds on a killer that can essentially keep everyone injured for the duration of the game I'd say you simply need to play that killer to understand this very basic concept.  Sloppy and Thanatophobia on Legion are an incredible combo probably his strongest duo of perks.  Combine them with gen perks like pgtw and ruin and you have some real slowdown going on.  Also your percentages are off tier 3 is higher than that.
---
We don't try to toxic tunnel but it's just so goddamn easy to make money off of them
---
If you want an epic victory, you must risk epic failure.
---
hahaha
---
Without NOED in the game there is little reason to cleansing dull totems
---
My honest opinion on noed is not that's it's overpowered or anything like that lol. I see it as a crutch perk that can be good for new killers who have a tough time finding/chasing people so at least they can get 1 kill for sure, maybe two instead of the 0 they would have got without it. But honestly at rank 1-10 if you're running noed, you're wasting a perk slot because people know how to hold down a button until skulls break. Plus, if you're a half decent killer, most of the time you can get them before all the gens are done lmfao.
---
Chris Washington would be amazing
---
Interesting. I saw the Fortnite stuff and that had a Demogorgon skin and a Chief Hopper skin. When I heard about Netflix talking with them I assumed we were getting a movie, but tbh this makes more sense. Thanks for the info :)
---
Yeah, let me cleanse all 5 totems with my team of randoms as they never do gens, get downed simultaneously and farm each other.
---
"just cleanse totems" is a good argument if we are talking about swf, but a completely shit argument if we are discussing randoms and solo queue.
---
 I for sure thought there was a Snapchat filter on the face
---
Oops
---
 JUST GRINDED LEGION TO 40 FOR IRON MAIDEN FOR MY HUNTRESS AND THEN TWO DAYS LATER IT COMES UP IN THE SHRINE! I COULD HAVE SAVED SO MANY BLOODPOINTS!
---
Sometimes I give teabaggers hope when theyre next to the hatch and then I close it, if they weren't complete douches I actually give them the hatch because they deserve it more
---
Well, tunelling don't give you as much money as switch targets
---
yea, i never said it is Op, but its pretty annoying
---
Great, now when is hatch gonna stop spawning in that one spot in the basement every single time?
---
Right, I get that, which is why I proposed Thrilling Tremors. TT temporarily blocks gens that aren't being worked on, which slows down the game. If a gen *doesn't get blocked*, then someone is currently working on it and you can teleport to them.
---
You've already got two tracking perks (Discordance and BBQ), you don't need a third one. TT is a middle ground between tracking and slowing the game down that is gen-oriented, which is what you're looking for.
---
meh, both are pretty decent but plague is kinda boring
---
Plague is more fun
---
The only way to stop this from happening would be to disable post game chat.
---
This only happens if you played with babystrats and tunneled directly off hooks or used Moris, OR if your opponents are all pussies and dc.  If you play a solid game you are never going to depip off of a 4K.
---
This man doesn't even know how to take a screen grab on his computer and you're all accusing him of somehow cheating to get steam achievements.
---
oh, I see :) I just use brown addons on her usually, so I have bunch of those good ones which I use on SWF hehe
---
It's not as much, but it's easier money. And when you only have 3 perk slots instead of all four, easy money best money
---
Agree with Jason, I think its more likely they go with that girls crazy older brother as the killer - that guy was spare parts.
---
&gt; there is little reason to cleansing dull totems
---
1000 or 15000 smackeroonies is plenty reason to me
---
Make it so for each totem up it's +15 seconds on the exit gates and hatch doesn't spawn at all until they're all gone.
---
you get a to see the killer no more than 3 times. alert
---
and swap that mori for a game offering if you want 4 disconnects
---
/r/LeaksByDaylight
---
i wasnt talking about refunding the game but if you wanna know ask ur provider
---
addon
---
I'm very calm. As you may have read, the post is flaired as salt and I said you can't change my mind. 
---
No discussion needed. My op was an observation.
---
Yeah that's what I usually do as well, but we had 1 or 2 gens left and the killer only had something like 2 hooks.
---
rank reset is really something else
---
He was running silent bell and all seeing, it was not an addon
---
Legion more fun
---
wait where i cant find that quote anywhere in-game
---
Chill
---
Main shit is just people double backing if you mess up but that’s fixable and the other one can be fixed. And on console frame drops and harder to spin and hit. But other than that it ain’t too shabby
---
Where is the screenshot of his add-ons?
---
Is there any kind of reward for rank reset? Like a pack of shards or something?
---
Sounds like a glitch to me
---
Who do you guys think is more viable against good survivors overall?
---
IF YOU GIVE LOW RANK KILLERS A LONG CHASE, THEYRE GOING TO RAGE CAMP YOU. LOW RANK PEOPLE NEVER DO THE GENS WHEN SONEONE CAMPS ANYWAYS.
---
I didn't understand shit. First, killer instinct shows survivors which are not affected by deep wound so I don't get what you want to be changed. Second, slightly decrease what? 20 to 17 what? There is no timer that long in legion...
---
Didn't get one unfortunately, he was running Coxcombed Clapper and All Seeing - Spirit
---
I had a bloodpoint offering
---
We should also give him a gun so he can shoot people as secondary action and if power bar is full he can drop a bomb on the map and anyone not in a locker dies PERMANANTLY (they can't play that survivor anymore, ever).
---
Legion is just an awful killer in every way. Even playing him isnt as fun with the snail vault speed
---
which one though?
---
Cause I’m sure you read the terms of service anyways (no one ever does lol) I highly doubt a system like this would ever exist. It’s like hey you can just rent these things.
---
Them damn trees man...
---
I really only posted this because I don’t think some people realize flaming a fair killer promotes toxic behavior, which in turn comes back to them and creates more toxicity.
---
It used to be worse for survivors when the fences didn't have guaranteed openings if short.  Was super hard to tell where you could run while running away, and made the map a maze and a half.
---
Would probably be the only character I buy in DbD honestly if he was made a thing
---
Killer instinct should have no cool down and be changed so that you hold down left trigger to activate, basically you can always break into a sprint and apply deep wounds but if you want to down someone you gotta let go of LT meaning you’ll get a small stun, then increase the stun duration as needed to balance,
---
I hope the Skin Bundle gets updated looks. Night out Nea needs the hair update now

---
Comments: wTF iS hiiS fAcE??
---
I'm part of that sub. The only leaks that may be even remotely connected to the chapter are the new effects, that at best can suggest that the killer may be stealthy if you ignore that the Devs literally talked about reworking stealth less than a month ago, and the previously mentioned sound leaks, that lean much more towards being what we'll hear in the archives than what a killer may sound like. I mean, I doubt a killer would make all those sounds and then have one single sound effect for turning a page. Sounds much better if you remember that the Devs initially described the Archives' mission sets as "tomes". Does that ring a bell?
---
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED PLAYING AN EASIER KILLER, THEN SPENDING THE POINTS ON BUBBA IF ALL YOU WANT IS BBQ
---
&gt; the Skin Bundle 
---
this makes it sound like there's only one
---
It's stronger than before now that you will use it when you actually need it.
---
People seem to believe a stranger things chapter and I kind of hope that isn’t true. It seems really out of place. Though there was that synth wave DBD posted a while back which if they do decide to do stranger things and have that as a theme I would be content
---
thank you
---
I'm actually pretty sad that the whole fun factor gets lost because of this
---
There's been a few. Not many though, unlike Huntress and Spirit.
---
Having licensed characters automatically thiccens the lore. The entity being a puppet master behind all these evil representatives is OP story telling and I like it. When the Appendix comes out, hopefully we'll see it all blended together well. Plus, odds are always that a licensed franchise game on its own for any of these iconic characters is gonna suck, and even if it doesn't, it dies like a baby Dwight in the cradle. BHVR, valid complaints or not, is doing a pretty good job so far at keeping these poor, oft out of work killers in employ and relevant.
---
Just as a suggestion.
---
Reusing the Thumbnail someone else created in this case from a german Youtuber and just adding a face is kind of lazy. Maybe try to create some own Thumnails or hire someone to do it
---
Legion DLC is still rated bad..
---
Would've been cooler if you could sorta play Julie and frank putting julie upstair on Haddonfield and chase a survivor uo there as frank, switch to julie and hit the survivor
---
Yep you can do kill your friends
---
Michael is cool. 
---
The rest are debatable.
---
Clown is a clown, which only normies avoid cosplaying as.
---
I WISH KILL YOUR FRIENDS EXISTED LOL
---
Did you clutter the web with teachables already? 
---
Avoid prestiging her if you got BBQ, the RNG here really screws you over until you got a mil BP ready to prestige
---
FIX YOUR FUCKING GAME BHVR, THESE NO NETWORK CONNECTION ERRORS ARE REALLY PISSING ME OFF. MORE PROOF THEY DONT CARE IF THE GAME IS UNPLAYABLE ON XBOX AND PS4!

Steve could have a perk where he can just hit the killer with a plank every 60 seconds

Actually this is a really gd idea that fits Amanda so well with there no one should survive her taps mentality it's a hard challenge for solos but for swf it's a time consuming challenge it's a great buff the changes are pig from one of the worst killers to mid to upper tire killer.

I did don’t worry
---
BUT BBQ ITSELF GIVES A HUGE BLOODPOINT MULTIPLIER THUS ACCELERATING THE PROCESS. CAN ONLY USE THAT ON BUBBA UNTIL IT'S TEACHABLE
---
I get both sides of the argument, as, as soon as BHVR had the money they started dropping licensed killers left and right, bringing familiar names into the mix. Problem is, it didn’t feel fresh. And on top of that, the licensed killers ended up being a super nerfed joke anyway, making the illusion of our favorite killers fall away and make them seem like they weren’t powerful at all. 
---
Freddy, a dream demon, reduced to a meme for the better part of over a year. Michael Myers at least only required a little practice. The pig was great until they took away the usefulness of the traps. “They’re not meant to kill, just slow the game down -a little bit-“ they’re a useless waste of killer and survivor time is what they are. Bubba was amazing until we realized that all you had to do was hug the wall and run around a corner or a tree and he’d pretty much be doomed to hit tantrum mode, buying you a quarter map’s worth of distance. Ghost face has his spot at decent, just like Michael. Even if he is still basically a meme with the way his detection works. Then we have Ash as a licensed survivor. Which works for him because when playing survivor you’re bound to survive just fine, long as you and your team aren’t too terribly brain dead. 
---
Licensed killers are cool, but stop putting them out like candy to lure people in with a familiar name, then giving them the cosmic joke of DBD. At least Freddy’s got a fix. I guess.
---
Put a timer on it like Hope...
---
Nice but honestly I prefer the chrome mask. Looks clean as fuck
---
I always give the last player the hatch, unless the game was REALLY difficult and they teabagged me all over the place.

An obsession is a survivor with the special status from perks like dying light, PWYF, DS, OOO, furtive chase and many more.  Depending on what happens to an obsession depends on if the perk comes into effect

Let's keep the 115.

---
Dark Sense should be like Poised... activating on every gen

Perks such as decisive strime save the best for last and play with your food will have a survivor be an obsession i believe

Well obviously you disliked it enough to comment so yeah my point stands: don’t be a dick.

"hello, i am P3 claudette who urban evaded around the map all game and got out with 8000 points. I would like you to know that Adrenaline was my reward for completing the objective"
---
5 blink nurse is more a meme than actually strong, with omega blink you are in for a real treat
---
Quality shot post good sir.
---
THATS A FAIR POINT, IT SUCKS THE BEST KILLER BP PERK IS ON THE WORST KILLER
---
Not scared anymore I guess
---
They need to just let you upgrade a perk all the way if you get it to level one.
---
Would make SWF absolutely bulldoze her, and would make a good solo team nigh unbeatable
---
yeah luckily I’m on console so I don’t see many nurses but I’ve had my fair share going against good nurses at red ranks
---
I got this game for The Pig. Now I love playing The Pig and Legion, mainly. Might try out Gostface eventually
---
My thought was, omg did they went to the same school at some point, But who has a picture of themselves in their locker, when they are nothing like an egotistic asshole (no offense to any egotistic assholes out there)
---
IT'S NOT LIKE IT WILL EVER SHOW UP IN BLOODWEBS EVEN IF YOU UNLOCK THE TEACHABLE, SO IT DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER ANYWAY
---
It isn’t stronger, but I do think it has more utility
---
Seems decent
---
I can't wait for this either!
---
Just googled dead by daylight pictures and took this one, it's literally the coverart of the game with the name written beside it, if a German youtuber added the name of the game to the picture then that's lazier than what I did. No offence meant, I can change for future
---
There's still collision. Once they find where you are you can 360 and hope they are bad. I guess that's what you reference with ''turning at angles unexpectedly''? 
---
She doesn't need to use power after phasing cause she doesn't need to. You've already been hit or shes close enough to hit you. 
---
And how do windows and pallets work against good spirits?
---
what?
---
maybe in their world kids put their own pictures in their own locker cos idk
---
Shit posts for cheap karma
---
Nothing else to riot about at the moment, I guess.
---
Who r u?
---
I'm but more toxic.
---
I mean it's no where near top tier, but once a teammate dies the killer cant see your aura from half the distance of Nurses, Deerstalker, and gives a slight advantage to Bitter Murmur (despite it never being used).
---
When two of your teammates are dead, Nurses and Deerstalker can no longer reveal your aura and gives you a slight advantage in BBQ
---
And finally, during a hatch game the killer is permanently unable to see your aura completely. If paired with Iron Will and Spine Chill you could make a quick escape out during the EGC since the killer cant see you.
---
(plus it destroys Scratched Mirror Myers, Amanda's Letter Pig, and All Seeing Wraith)
---
Perks in general need a buff, there's so many on each side that are completely useless.
---
You spelled shirtless myers wrong. Twice.
---
WGLF id rather get 4 stacks and double bloodpoints than the extra 5000 escape points
---
Is it me or is she spitting straight fax
---
WHATS YOURE GAMERTAG, ILL RUN TOMBSTONE IF I SEE YOU
---
Implying i ever win with wraith
---
He just looks too thicc. I'll stick with my P3 head with Devil Cape.
---
Said Noone ever
---
I max out deviousness and hunting every game
---
only Myers, cause of his Tiers you genius.
---
IT’S FLAYFUL, THANK YOU GOOD PERSON &lt;3
---
THANKS GIGANTICSACKOFBALLS! NOW I KNOW THE TERM!
---
Oh! Youre approaching me? Instead of chainsaw sprinting away, youre coming right to me?
---
I cant beat the shit out of you without coming closer
---
I dont think anybody just inherently hates licensed characters, just the restrictions is cosmetics and such that come with the territory.
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
Don't get me wrong, I understand the benefit of avoiding killer detection. But I feel like you need to be willing to let your teammates die for it to benefit you, and if they die to early--- you're chances of escaping are still going to be low.
---
It's like the reverse-altruism perk.
---
You can test out almost everything on Kill Your Friends though
---
But then u have adrenaline and run away!
---
Implying you always ring the bell, regardless of any reason to do so.
---
save the best for last gains stacks off of hits, plague's whole kit is revolved around only needing to land one hit. So theres so issues with using that perk on her since you get half the amount of stacks with every successful chase.
---
&gt;both have pretty meh perks overall.
---
Discordance is quite strong because not only it gives you a destination (like straight after the match just started), it also feeds you information. Say there is 3 survivors left and you hook one of them, if Discordance triggers you immediately know where all the remaining survivors are. As the game progress and the gens are done, the chances of survivors doubling up on generators is higher. 
---
Infectious Fright is also strong on Nurse, Billy and any other killer you can down survivors quickly. Personally I have never used but good killer streamers make great use of this perk.
---
Information on DBD is very strong, more than stacking up perks that pseudo-slow the game like Ruin, Thanatophobia, Sloppy or whatever else. Constant chases and hooking survivor is the ultimate tool to prolong a game.
---
t i think gens gain progress A LOT faster in mobile. i watch dbd PC gameplays and i definitely notice some kind of difference.
---
1: That's not a leak, it's a teaser. A leak is something that wasn't intended to be released or seen, yet someone manages to do it. Examples are the previously mentioned sounds or how literally everyone could play Ghostface before he was even released in the PTB.
---
2: You talk about "leakS". Other than what I previously discussed, which doesn't even WEAKLY hint towards Stranger Things, there's just the non-leak statement that Netflix has projects with BHVR. From what we know, it could just be an event. If you are so certain that the next killer will be from ST, it means that you've probably convinced yourself through the excitement and hopes of the community that there's some undeniable proof out there that confirms that the next killer will be the Demogorgon. Or whatever.
---
Use spirit she's better in every way
---
Shoot I didn't mean save the best for last, I meant play with your food.
---
I like playing against high ranks because it teaches me how to be a better player. Even if I do get my ass handed to me lol.
---
ikr right, shes ugly as hell too. (sorry for all the meg mains out there)
---
people are still calling the DS rework a nerf lmao
---
I haven't seen this kind of meme for a while
---
you cant test killers, and what if people dont have friends to kill
---
It is a feature, but a lot of killers don't want to deal a group of SWFs. The difference between four players on comms and four randoms is huge, so I can see why Killers want to ditch. The problem with comparing this to others games that do have a timer for leaving is they are not asymmetrical multiplayer games. I can't really think of any asymmetrical multiplayer games that have a timer for leaving, really. The only way this would be fixed is if they added a queue for specifically Killers to go against SWF, which would probably just increase your timers more. 
---
Just too punishing to force players to go against such dynamically harder matches without some sort of option to opt out or something. It is like they throw in ranked games randomly in casual queues for other games :P.  People would leave those too if they happened.
---
So, unless you want them to make a mode with even bigger queue times, which I doubt the Devs would want anyways, then our best option is to just deal with leavers. A penalty will not go down well without an option to opt out of SWF. It just won't XD.
---
Survivor main BTW.
---
Its is from dbd
---
Only streamers I ever see are ones my kids watch. None of them even look 17. And a grown man following a child in any way is just creepy to me. Hate me I don't care I was molested as a child myself.
---
I'm stating the truth. The game has so many balancing issues, bugs, the matchmaking is total ass. Whatever plus sides this game has, the game doubles in negatives. I come back to this place every now and then to see how it is even though I stopped playing a while ago, there was no fun to be had in it, just frustration. If OP wants genuine advice, I'd say watch someone like Ardetha, or start playing Nurse/Huntress, since they are free. If you are going to pay, go for Spirit 100% if you want a high tier killer, Myers if you want to try to have fun.
---
Ahhh, about a year ago. On another note remember when the game was actually GOOD and didn't make you want to scream and/or cry in a corner? Y'know, before huntress hitboxes
---
Like what doctor said, wraiths power helps find survivors.  Its the same reason the old Freddy was 'op' vs newbies.  You are inexperienced in approaching and finding survivors at gens when you have a terror radius so the wraith fixes that issue.  Additionally you are likely playing against noob survivors who dont know how to hammer out gens, dont have many perks unlocked, and dont know how to loop.
---
With a power that doesnt help you end chases faster or prolong the game experienced survivors will just bully you left and right.
---
I really like when streamers have an URL somewhere in their profiles, even if they aren't using that as a name. It is rare I end up following and becoming a regular viewer in that stream but I sure love watching the game we just played from their POV, whether they were on my team or playing against me. 
---
Over a year playing DBD and hundreds of TTVs that I encountered throughout, only 2 streamers I ended up actually being part of their community mostly because I loved to play as their killer in public lobbies and they loved playing against me (nothing premeditated between both parts). They were both fairly new to the game and I always made sure to give them a serious (no farming) yet fun match (no sweaty perks or sweaty strategies).
---
This is my personal experience but from what I gather this is somewhat rare because people usually like to be disrespectful in every way they can when they see someone streaming.
---
random, comma
---
It is, indeed, the only prescription.
---
I mean this happens every chapter like people hating Ghostface when he released he got some nerfs or Freddy for example also because "Dream pallets and teleportation too op pls nerf BHVR" same with survivor perks although mettle of man deserved a nerf.
---
all of the survivors are ugly tbh she just the 3rd worse
---
Maybe it was Franklin's Demise?
---
No the killer only had overcharge
---
you do realize that's a slow vault, right? especially with Myers T3's lunge and how close he was, that should've hit 100%
---
I AM LIVID, I WAS CLOWN AND THE MATCH STARTED... I GOT ONE HOOK AND 3 GENS WERE DONE AT THE SAME TIME... THIS IS RIDICULOUS BECAUSE THE GAME LASTED LIKE 3 MINUTES

Well I can safely say DBD has a far older streaming community than what you're watching. If your kids are watching Fortnite or something that makes way more sense but its not super relevant to the discussion here in the DBD subreddit. I don't think I've ever seen a DBD streamer that isn't an adult.
---
Must be

That's the trick to kill this reddit.

Sometimes I will check them out if I had a bad game or noticed something odd. Seeing the game from their side does help some in learning how to improve
---
exactly. like,, at least man up that you don't like them. that's the least you can do-
---
Yea I can imagine some of them will just jump on you about sniping, the few I watch can be paranoid and I try to not watch the shouting angry ones lol. 
---
That's the thing right now I get it because it's rank re-set and looking at some of the guys videos he is rank 11 survivor and he had a killer video at rank 15, I did find it funny that he didn't show ranks of survivors or killers and talks a bit of smack in his videos even though his opposition are understandably bad lol. Usually though I am either red rank or purple, just before this re-set I was rank 3, so I would expect these people to be really good but I just haven't seen it.
---
ps:never was called a camper when i was camping as wraith for 2 games to test
---
Anybody to look into that does not promotes toxicity? I will see if there is some entertainment in it to try getting some friends and family in the game.
---
If u got the dub who cares.
---
no u
---
Not really.  If there is the option of self-caring next to a gen while someone else works on the gen, this is actually the max efficiency choice assuming there is 0 risk of the killer showing up at all.
---
1 person healing another takes 16 seconds for both of them while waiting on the heal.   2 people on the same gen have a .9x charge rate gain modifier for the 2 of them, meaning they do the gen in 44 seconds IIRC the rate correctly, vs the solo 80.
---
This is a total of 60 seconds.  Solo self-care is 32 seconds, and solo time on gen for 32 seconds means there is 48 charges left on the gen. 2 people on the gen means it will take them 26.66 repeating seconds to finish the gen from that 48 charges left.  For a total of 58.66 repeating seconds.
---
I can respect that it isn't for everyone. Personally I love to have it on when I study as it doesn't distract me or draw me in, also I have learnt a lot from seeing people who are very good play.
---
Dude I would really not be mad if we got Nancy and Steve as survivors to make up for Ghostface not having a survivor with him. 
---
Hell just as long as we have Steve, really
---
I hate that WGLF gets the stigma of a farming perk. I use it but I don’t make it a priority. I basically run it for those matches where things aren’t going great and if I get a hook save it salvages my points a little bit. I don’t go out of my way to get hook saves and always try and be cautious. So it sucks that WGLF has that stigma over it. I’ve been given shit a couple times being accused of farming when I was always careful with my hook saves just because I run that perk. One dude even said “it’s literally not meant for anything but farming” to which, I disagree. #respectforWGLF
---
he reported me for being anti sportive
---
I thought only kids were streaming lol I am a troglodyte
---
Yeah I'm sorry but that is not creepy. I don't care what kind of outlook it is, it's ridiculous to think that older people can't have anything to do with younger people for any reason.
---
Since he is part of Ghostface’s story, I expect him to be free.
---
Love it
---
You might like Tru3ta1ent he promotes playing none toxically, plays both sides and talks through stuff he does. He can complain a bit so he isn't everyone's cup of tea. He is over 30 I believe   
---
Puppers is great as he is more trying to be an entertainer than just a great player. He is 29 I think.   
---
Monto has just started streaming and has a YT channel. He plays both sides and is quite good. Again I believe he is 29.   
---
I love Geef who is an Australian streamer. Again he tries to entertain not just be a great gamer. He is 30   
---
Their are a lot of others like Angrypug, Jendenise, Scottjund, Zubatlel, Fungoose, Streamdad, VincentVega and Cahlaflour. I don't really watch these but they are popular, some of them are accused of being toxic I will warn you but other than potentially Monto at times the 4 I recommend are pretty good IMO.
---
No, YOU’RE breathtaking
---
YEAH I'LL LET YOUR SWF GET AWAY WITH 3 INSTAHEALS AND A BADASS FLASHLIGHT THAT'S FINE
---
So true xd
---
I've never been one to watch a stream however I will give it a shot. I appreciate your responses. Unlock the trolls also replying.
---
The narrator of the video said, that although he is small the curse he used to trap himself in the doll, grants him the strength of a fully grown man.
---
so that's it. it is probably a good killer right now because I am probably playing with people in like low-mid ranks.
---
Definitely, because those people are on the same level as me. I’ve literally just started playing as killer so have no experience. Also don’t really know how trolling obviously new players helps anyone.  Saying that’s not how getting better works is naive imo 🤷🏽‍♀️  not everyone gets better that way. Matchmaking defo needs improving
---
Woooow. A shit green dress.
---
Your mom is so cute! This is hilarious. The COPD part had me dying
---
That's what I thought cause the few streamers I watch it's more for them than the gameplay but some of these channels I check out they either aren't talking at all or it's some crappy mic and them chatting shiz. Again maybe it's just the few I have checked out.
---
&gt;Been suggested a billion times and I'm not sure why it isn't in the game.

I was so damn offended . U got me god dammit

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cqfwid/found_3_funnyannoying_glitches/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Balance change 1: Make it so a killer can't run noed And ruin at the same time.
---
Balance change 2: Adrenaline makes you permantly exhausted once it is activated.
---
Balance change 3: When pop goes the weasel is active you are allowed to kick regressing generators.
---
Addition 1: rewards for ranking up and getting devotion.
---
Addition 2: multiple map gamemode with more killers and survivors. Where like the coldwind farm is an entire map.

It sure does

that’s a nice alt f4 from me
---
That pull back😭
---
Im a fan of the cross country hiker leggings.
---
No I didn't actually. Good thing she has 10 athletic skins to remind me!
---
I like to get one hit, then cloak and stalk the survivor from far away when running, then wait for them to be calm again and uncloak while not moving then get the last hit with the speed bonus. it's a nice way to play I guess but I understand it probably only works because I'm playing with other new players.
---
Dedicated servers are coming in the next chapter. Approx 3 - 4 weeks
---
Come on guys no need for that. I can understand both your point of views. I can get why it may seem creepy if someone is following a young kids channel and yes probably some of those people are creeps. At the same time their are a lot of people who check out streams because of the gameplay and some of these kids are ninjas compared to your average Joe and if you have no bad intentions then their isn't anything wrong with watching them.
---
It's ridiculously good solo. It let's your team know their role. Where they'd normally have everyone stop gens to go for save, or nobody does because they're all super far and assume someone is closer for save. With kindred you give them the information they need to play effectively.
---
Gotta start somewhere I guess. I think a lot of people might just post videos and stuff just for small stuff, like say you got a really funny play, you might just upload it to YouTube and then share it to reddit. But that's just my guess. I got literally no idea why some people post or stream.
---
DS is not a problem if you don't tunnel. I do think all active DS's should become inactive when you hook someone else.
---
I've played 20 minute games where only a few gens get done. Plenty of time to get all the gens done. There's always 1 person getting chased for minutes. Nothing gets done. I'm over here injured doing generators, while everyone is healing in corners. (Empathy)
---
5minutes go by, no generator gets done. Just constant rehealing. I've seen players who mainly focus on the objective, and don't care about healing. That's usually when shit gets done. Plus with some builds, you can come prepared to not get hit whatsoever. With self care, it's like you come prepared to exit via hatch. With selfcare, it's like your sole objective is to outlive the team, with constant healing. Let's say you're not the only 1 using self care, but you do it 3-5 per match x2 people
---
Or x3
---
The minutes add up. Nothing gets done. The guy getting chased for minutes gets pissed off on all the deadweight players who don't get anything done. Sometimes it's that last generator. Someone has him distracted for over a minute, instead of using that time wisely, it's wasted on healing, by that time the window of opportunity is gone.
---
why are you so irritable about this lmao
---
Sure this games got some issues, but it sounds to me like you got shit-stomped a few too many times and the salt fused with your DNA, forming a disease known as “shit taste”
---
And when you complain about the idiots in chat, they don't believe you when you tell them you're actually rank 3 or just call you boosted. It's almost like in this **teamwork**-based game, we need proper **teamwork** in order to win together. One red rank with 3 potatoes won't get you too far.
---
The fact that it cost you 3 dollars upsets me.
---
Why would it be capped? You have a source on this?
---
I don't care about the post itself, which was already lazy for not putting the text into the image, I care for halfway decent grammar.
---
I love licensed characters a lot, but in my opinion a lot of the original characters are way more interesting. They get way more skins, and in general the devs have much more control over them, which leads to generally some more interesting killers. Licensed killers limit the devs in what they are allowed to do with the character
---
Safe unhook? Big difference.
---
It's the last cosmetic to release. Next week, Ace and Nurse cosmetics release, then the next week the Nea and Hag, then Jeff and Kate finally come up... on September 4th. The cosmetic is very rare and costs 1,080 cells, HOWEVER, it also can be bought with 21,800 shards.
---
Exactly, dying as survivor with 40K+ blood points and being a bitch to the killer even tho they brought in a 103% BP offering for all is just shitty. Hopefully that guy gets Morid every single game after his first hook.
---
Lmfao I was not expecting that
---
Not really racist. You can say something about let's say their French accent, it's the context that matters. Since you didn't really use it in a harmful context, if anything a sympathetic one, it's cool. 
---
I feel bad for McCote a lot, he's a cool guy and nice. He seems pretty fun and like happy about the game, sometimes he's a bit naive, that's all. He's only rank 18-20 on DBD if you check his streams
---
Are you justifying them getting pulled backwards after they are already in the running animation?
---
 If you're looking for perks. Freddy is a mix of gen defender and you're not escaping set. Clown has Pop goes the Weasle which makes a gen break by 25% after a hook.
---
Ghostface also has a great perk. Which blocks gens off after a hook.
---
Legion has the most helpful due to gen teleporting. Highlighting a gen brightly when two people are working on it.
---
The exit gate blocks are Freddy only with some standard perks...
---
It does way more than just countering tunneling. It essentially gives you a 60 second borrowed time.
---
It's ok.
---
You need to finish the Gen to get it to proc, and it only works up to 5 times, if you carry like a boss.
---
Gotta get that trophy
---
Indeed

I would imagine that Wraith and Dwight would be best friends.

---
Camping huntesses is a low rank/post-gate opening thing. Huntress is one of those low mobility killers who relies on momentum..camping completely kills the momentum you have and kills what little map pressure you have
---
Any huntress worth their salt knows that she’s literally one of the worst killers to camp with and actually win (Camping in general is anti-win but it’s better on some killer than others).
---
A console Nurse. Ballsy.
---
What about sex after a joint in the middle of a work day right as you reach 1 million blood points?
---
I mean, that's how opinions work.
---
I’ve gotten 3 people in the past week because I hooked the second last guy while they were downed and I walk over to them and they’re dry humping the hatch. Like thanks, I didn’t know it was there lol.
---
yes but did you know that the last 3 shrines have been shit and i have 8k shards
---
I will gladly play Steve as he is the only mom I care about besides my own
---
He can use the same power as nurse. Nurse use telequinesis to hook/destroy pallets and gens
---
The post above is about how some people say that a killer is op when they first come out rather than admit they do not like the killer
---
This depend how strong the killer is. I am a rank 2 survivor last season and if the Killer is actually a weak Killer (rank 10 or worse), then i will easily win regardless of my allies. But if he is also some dude that got resetted that used to be a red rank, or even purple rank, i will get destroyed with idiot allies.
---
They probably bought the entire outfit, not just the body piece. Only the outfits are on sale, not the individual pieces.

Frick Kate we want epic Ace skin
---
i changed my skill check button to the touchpad and i actually helps get great skill checks a lot better, some people also just suggest changing it to one of the face buttons, if you play killer just don't bother playing huntress or nurse unless you wanna put in the extra effort to play those two
---
But he has the strength of a full-sized man. watch the video

HOW DID YOU TAKE SO LONG TO FIGURE OUT THAT YOU DON"T LIKE HILLBILLY? A SIMIAR THING HAPPENED TO ME WITH CLOWN, BUT I FIGURED IT OUT AT P1 LEVEL 21.

I PLAYED HIM AT LVL 40 A BIT AND DECIDED TO MAX HIM THEN I HAVE NOT PLAYED HIM FROM P0 40 TO P3 50 MAX AND TRIED HIM OUT WITH PROPER PERKS. FUCK ME RIGHT?

The artwork is a banner for the new cosmetic. It shows up in the cosmetics store.
---
I'm relatively new to the game (\~2 weeks) and have been having a blast with this game! Was really excited to make some content and here's my first Dead by Daylight video
---
And then they stop struggling and die on hook right in front of you
---
I have a thing for accuracy, misinformation and overexaggerating in the comments.
---
My issue with Deliverance is that it incentivises bad plays in solo survivor games (Unhooking self when other survivors are usually going to stop what they are doing to come and save you), but is exceptionally good in SWF games (where your team mates generally know if you got the perk ready or not thanks to coms, and won't come and save you and instead try and distract the killer elsewhere).
---
yes!! how many times have you gotten there only to see the killer face camping with noed?
---
And what system do you play on?
---
Nah run botony SC spine chill and try to find a perk called we’ll make it, it is overpower and underrated, u are able to heal 100% faster for 90 seconds after unhooking someone, insane for healing, even if your teammate insists on running the complete opposite side of the map it’ll still be active that long GL cya man
---
A heartless soul for a pure soul
---
Good tip
---
Are you trying to flex? Lmao
---
Not at all. I thought it was funny.
---
Can confirm.
---
If they added Strahm instead of Tapp I think I would main survivor because I absolutely loved him in the movies
---
Facebook &amp; instagram steal their memes from reddit who tends to steal it from elsewhere
---
As if survivors can't just AFK in a corner, get carried by their team, and have Adrenaline proc on them at the end. You can't cherrypick a situation on one side without discussing the equivallent situation on the other side.
---
Yeah that person and their friends weren’t fun to play against. Unfortunately I got matched with them because of the reset. 
---
In my opinion, I don’t think he was able to get as much satisfaction from our conversation because he had no response to what I had to say. They could have chosen to not respond, but oh well 🤷‍♂️ I do understand your point and will do my best to refrain from doing so in the future. Usually I can brush it off, but this was a special occasion considering he messaged me afterwards lol. 
---
I wish the community wasn’t so toxic. Call me crazy, but I think a part of it stems from content creators that have montages of bullying killers and promoting it in a sense. I was watching a video today of a youtuber bullying a baby trapper and I didn’t enjoy the video after putting myself in that trapper’s shoes.

Quentin when he knows theres nude feet somewhere in a 30ft radius
---
but rank reset means these survivors were at least 5 ranks lower than this yesterday, maybe 7 ranks better. killer could have been just as terrible then as now since he can't go any higher in rank.
---
Take my upvote, you don't deserve to get downvoted for speaking the truth.
---
Freddy is the reason I got to purple ranks in just a few games for the first time. And I just got him like a week or so ago.
---
Lmao well if so then I hope virtual reality enhances so much that you get to experience what you cannot in a safe environment.
---
I just want Death Garden mask on console.
---
The game isn't over until every survivor is dead or escaped. The devs' game is balanced around 2 dead and 2 escaped, not around x number of gens getting done. This argument is old, tired, and void.
---
Doesnt fit dbd really imo.
---
Nah I'm secretly a chad
---
I would prefer it.
---
Seeing all the swf teams beat up on baby killers, and hardcore red ranks smash baby Dwight is disgusting.
---
I was rank 3 survivor, and I was finally getting good matches. Now I have to struggle for pips from rank 10. Again.
---
And as soon as I string together enough good matches to get good teammates, it will repeat.
---
live to die another day
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
Call me Karen
---
I HATE Q TIMES THAT IS ALL
---
Im pretty sure it's stated the entity tortures the crap outta killers till they are basically mindless puppets.
---
Haha i was thinking the same xd
---
Well changes to the blood web are coming, maybe you should just save up your BP, and she what the changes are first
---
is there a video comparing botany without botany, i really don't see the difference
---
“If you camp til endgame you wont be injured when the last gen pops”. If a survivor AFKs in a corner all game theyll be full health and then adrenaline is literally just sprint burst with 2 extra seconds. Even if adrenaline heals you in a chase you still have to run the killer around long enough for your team to open an exit door and for you to get to it. I really don’t have a problem with noed but people gotta stop equating the two perks. Noed by FAR bails you out more then any other perk in the game on either side
---
It is... in the endgame. 
---
Aside from that,  the only time it's a good idea is if you hook somebody on the bottom of a ledge,  look up, and see a Nea crouched at the top of the ledge waiting for you to leave.
---
Also reduces heals from 16 seconds to 12.
---
Self care heals from 32 seconds to 28 (not sure on this one it might be 24 or 26 but i don't wanna do the math rn)
---
Which is incredibly good.  But bringing self care AND botany is not worth it, botany is actually better than self care if you just bring a medkit or loot a chest even.. lol
---
When I haven't played the game in a while and I'm going against bad or new players... Especially baby Dwight's I feel too bad about killing them. I'll most likely get them to death hook and let them Escape so that way I don't derank and stay in the low ranks.
---
I'll chase them and make it fun for them as well as myself. I just tried to hurry out of the low ranks and teach them something if I can. I would feel too guilty to kill them
---
Can do
---
Buzzing for this chapter (if it even happens)
---
Or maybe the upside down could have no pallets and  windows that slow down the survivor, and the way to get out of the upside down would be like freddy have a friend get you out and there would also be a stationary item.
---
Reminds me of the anti-altruistic [theme song.](https://youtu.be/5FjWe31S_0g)
---
Just wait until the A R C H I V E S are out
---
I MEAN, IF IT'S USED THE WAY IT'S INTENDED, AND SHE CAN ONLY CARRY ONE, IT'S NOT THAT BAD. LIKE, SHE ACTUALLY NEEDS TO AIM IT VERY WELL, AND GETS PUNISHED HARD FOR MISSING IT. DEFINITELY NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE AMOUNT OF BS YOU SEE WITH SHITBILLIES/SPIRITS/NURSES. IT'S WHEN YOU SLAP ON THE INFANTRY BELT THAT IT STARTS GETTING REALLY BROKEN REALLY FAST.
---
i love wow such gaming but i really dont want chucky in the game at all
---
If it gets too bad, just play survivor for a few weeks and spend the bloodpoints on your killer. The new/bad players will stay in the high ranks but the rest will move down out of your matchmaking. And for the swf that party up with high ranks to face easier killers, at least you will have a leveled up killer with solid perks to counter a bit.
---
That's why I wait a few days after Rank Reset before booting up the game again
---
I've gotten Ataxic and Fragile Wheeze Nurses.  I want to die to those.
---
It’s not a bad thing but it is always good to have original content
---
If only the bags were optional
---
I think it means decisive strike which is a perk which if after you get unhooked it will activate. When you get picked up by the killer with ds active a skill check will pop up and if you hit it the killer will drop you and get stunned.
---
Apparently yes. They have their dirty hands in,like, 3 complaints at a time
---
Highlander, Aramusha, Gladiator
---
Well dwight is obsessed with being a leader.
---
U wot m8
---
Oh sh$t she likes himmmm
---
dwight is gay and megs a lesbian, clearly she wants to kill him cos hes bad at sports or maybe they are just friends
---
I can understand it when there is a survivor in close proximity and you are leaving your kill on the ground to chase or stop a gen. My issue is intentionally prolonging the game in such a frustrating way. It feels bad in a way that losing otherwise doesnt.
---
Damn it was ruin too
---
Shadowborn and Bloodhound are two perks I think are pretty underrated. Reason for shadowborn is because the larger FOV makes seeing sneaky survivors and 360s are kind less useful and for bloodhound it basically makes being a  sneaky player impossible because the blood is pretty bright(Coulrophobia also with a anti healing build is just  good especially on clown because he has a mangled add-on meaning he can run nurses unnerving and distressing to increase Coulrophobias potency instead of using sloppy to slow healing)
---
It is unnecessary killer toxicity. Either immediately give them the hatch or hook them and then look for the hatch to close after you hooked the survivor. The 400 points are not worth wasting two people's time as it would be much more efficient to just queue up for the next game.
---
I hate opening 2 chests in the same match to only have a green key in both of them
---
To be fair to iron maiden, it’s *really* good to put on huntress because of the locker opening speed, plus the occasional screaming survivor as a bonus
---
Who are you?
---
Im you from the future
---
Who are all these people?
---
The survivors.
---
So this means?
---
We made it.
---
LMAO im just glad nothing good game because i haven't been grinding for weeks and my IS are low af :D expected nothing got nothing actually coming in clutch lmao
---
This is basically 90% of ruin spawns. The games I get where it spawns somewhere really hidden are great but those games are rare because it always wants to pop up in the most obvious place.

The Face of Patrick always kills me

Object of obsession is super underrated. It gives you so much information for a small drawback. You can see stealth killers, they’ll when the Spirit is phasing, and know where the killer is. As long as your good at looping you will be fine. It can also turn bad gens good because you have an extra heads up.
---
Good idea but they need to cool it if they’re actually going to release some stranger things nonsense. Doesn’t even fit in the genre
---
Glad to hear that you agree with me. Sadly some people still do not believe me and the Urban Dictionary, ofcourse i totally understand why. I forgot to write the most important thing.
---
\#TrueStory #100%Legit\_Info
---
He is honestly overrated, he can get looped really easily and the only strong part of his kit is his small TR in T2
---
Sounds like some kind of glitch to me, I use the ghost addon on wraith which makes your stain and heartbeat disappear for 3 seconds after you uncloak, so maybe he used some glitch with that?
---
Yeah no reason why ppl even get triggered over this as it attracts new players. i was almost forced to buy this when i saw Myres lol
---
Jeff tho...
---
He is better then all the other stealth killers in my opinion because 1.he negates all detection perks in tier 1, 2.cant get kicked out of stalking like some other stealthy boy(Ghostface). 3. He has a one down that works on everyone and you can decide when to pop it plus his terror radius is always small until tier 3. 4. He just has more variety compared to Ghostface,Pig, and wraith meaning more powerful and fun add-on combinations.
---
You lose add-ons and your offering.
---
And at the same time you're wasting the survivor's time. Feels wrong if the person played good, so I don't want to be a dick there. Because that might also lead the survivor to bm killers if he's met with situations like these.
---
4 bills join instantly **bill nye the science guy theme intensifies**
---
Wrong, survs are notified when the first person gets hit with noed
---
I only do it if the person was super toxic and T-bagged me the whole game
---
LAST TIME I PLAYED, I HIT SOMEONE UNHOOKING A SURVIVOR AFTER THE ANIMATION WAS DONE AND IT DIDN'T DO SHIT... TWICE!! THOSE I-FRAMES CAN FUCK RIGHT OFF.
---
I mean I always low key shipped them but now...
---
shitpost lvl 99 lmao i got caught oof
---
Me want souce too
---
Why does being on console matter? I'm on console and I've always wondered why I don't see Nurse very often.
---
I always thought iron maiden looked like a hot dog
---
Yeah, that's not the case.
---
Take your rainbow bullshit back to the RWBY and Steven Universe fandoms. People like you are a disgrace to the Pride Flag.
---
(I'm not against gay characters. But this "everyone is gay because reasons" thing gets on my nerves)
---
I think it was rock or metal mostly usually talks about slamming beats or pounding drums
---
He definitely is but compared to all the other stealth killers he  the best  plus literally every killer gets looped easily besides nurse and Spirit so yeah that's something.
---
lol complaining about mettle now
---
I got my rank 1 achievement pips mean nothing to me anymore. I'm gonna save them unless they were rude to me
---
i am not complaining i like the perk but i think is unfair to criticize a way of play if you have something op like mettle
---
FUCK MONSTERS WHO CAMP AND BLAME IT ON A RANK RESET. FUCK YOU. EVERY FUCKING MATCH. THOSE PEEPS WHO D/Cd, D/C BECAUSE YOU ARE A [SHITTY CAMPING MONSTER](/intensifies) AND WOULD RATHER NOT WASTE THEIR TIME AND SADLY WHEN ITS TWO D/Cs AND TWO PEOPLE AND 5 GENS THE GAME ISN'T FUN ANYMORE.
---
No, he has no power to loop easier apart from his T3 lunge and vault. Billy has chainsaw, huntress has hatchets, hag has traps.
---
mettle is hilariously not op anymore. maybe you could argue it before but it's not at all anymore lmao
---
Have you played her
---
I’m a godette
---
I can just hear Tarantino saying it too.
---
"Where the hell is it? God damn it!"
---
Purple and Pink open the hatch. Green with an add on can show you the killer's aura or other survivors I believe. I try to avoid them in bloodwebs lmao
---
Yea I do also but Myers is just more well equipped for stuff unlike Ghostface in my opinion
---
WHY AM I ALWAYS THE FIRST ONE TO DIE. I TRY LOOPING AND ESCAPING BUT EVERY SINGLE TIME, THE KILLER JUST KNOWS AND MY TEAMMATES LET ME DIE ON HOOK. BUT WHEN I PLAY KILLER, EVERYONE IS A PROFESSIONAL AT LOOPING AND ESCAPING CHASES. AND THEY ALWAYS SAVE THEIR TEAMMATES. AND MY FRIENDS REFUSE TO PLAY THIS GAME SO I AM ALWAYS PLAYING ALONE. AND WHY IS IT THAT EVERY TIME I BRING IN A GOOD ITEM OR OFFERING I DIE RIGHT AWAY. CAN ANYONE ON PS4 PLAY WITH ME. IM TIRED OF THIS. I JUST WANT TO SURVIVE.

Its not, it should be similar to devour hope.

---
Mettle is now one of the worst perks in the game man.  Borderline unusable.  Camping isn't a playstyle by the way it's the absence of a playstyle.  It's just standing there staring at a defenseless player.  Not engaging or skillful in the least can we stop attempting to legitimize it?
---
Well gotta stay accurate to the movies though
---
I mean, 2 kills with only one Gen done... it's working for him.
---
This needs to be fixed I think. I've been in Survivor matches where all the Survivors spawn right on top of a hex totem that's also right out in the open to boot. Most of the time when I'm the Killer my hexes are gone within seconds of a match starting. You're supposed to actually look for them not have them spawn on top of a Survivor's head.
---
Pretty sure it’s been said in the trailer of DotF that the Plague sacrifices people mindlessly to please her gods
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Anyone who assumes anything about a character who hasn't had anything officially stated is wasting their time, to be honest.
---
Draw the straight fan-art. Draw the gay fan-art. Draw whatever you want; the internet is for porn after all (Avenue Q taught me that). 
---
But I don't think you understand how toxic and shitty the Steven Universe and RWBY fandoms became after the whole "Yang and Blake have to be together, Ruby and Weiss are totally a thing, Sun can die in a fire and Neo is actually a boy" people moved in.
---
You can't honestly be arguing in the favor of someone who legitimately said they wanted a character to be **raped** so they could have their pairing, are you?
---
Is it too much to ask for both?
---
me saying ‘go away megs a lesbian’ isn’t me thinking im right, i said that as a joke obviously it isnt canon and i know that. Also that claudette scissoring and trapper thing was also surprisingly a joke, also its not a real character, it’s literally a game centered around murder and torture also idgaf about your personal RWBY issues, take ur edgy anime and throw it in a bin, it is irrelevant. also i never said it was a ‘perfect pairing’ people cant make jokes anymore cos ppl will just fully anal-yze it (tee hee) i don’t understand why you are getting so frustrated over a single person saying megs a lesbian.
---
yes, dwight has a vagina
---
Yeah, but for viability it just isn’t good, either way, Mike is good, but overrated, however still probably the best stealth killer
---
You're shit. If you run Thana WITh Swing Chains + Red Paint Brush or Jump Rope it's very good.
---
little did he/she know im a huntress main with 900+ hours an got max hatchets
---
yea but there are better add-ons
---
Give us Pennywise
---
He didn’t show the ez camp lol
---
I'd like a refund every time they fuck with killer/survivor perks we already paid for.
---
recently ran this and got three brown toolkits in a row all with at most yellow add ons
---
omg yea ikr
---
Hey wait a minute!
---
Sounds like tons of counterplay is available to that.
---
This image disturbs me a great deal. Please tell me it's fake lmao
---
Lmao tf are you talking about. He's saying that it is a bad strat and killers won't succeed facecamping good survivors. But if the killer is succeeding because of facecamping and getting 3ks and 4ks and shit, then you can't complain about it if you let the killer win
---
It's Summer. I don't want any damn flies going in
---
He is if ur on PC
---
If this isn't toxic then spam blinding isn't either.
---
yeah if the doors are far, timing the killer's patrol is much more fun and if the killer decides to camp the wrong gate at close to the end then its over lol
---
So much so that I completely despise him now.
---
Nope.
---
That isn't the full meta, you gotta put deja vu and unbreakable
---
Figures
---
Freddy
---
"Why doesn't killer just give me free hatch it's not fair :("
---
Cannibal so you can get BBQ and chili. Once you have that just pick your favorite killer
---
Darn.
---
that's suuuuuuper lame dude
---
one the few cool things he gots going for him is his raw kill power and i don't mean balance wise, it's just cool that a revved up leather really is something to fear all grouped up
---
also to two hit the survivor has to fuck up baaaaaadddd to do it like running into the killer/wall bad
---
"unless" and "no matter what" in the same sentence. awesome
---
Who's complaining about it? No one on this sub, that's for sure, and this is reddit, one of the most unreasonable places on Earth.
---
Besides, anyone who complains about Ruin needs to get past rank 10 as killer before they get to have an opinion on Ruin.
---
The crybabies are crying about Freddy but they're not as loud this time. So I hope you're wrong.
---
YESTERDAY I HAD TWO GAMES IN A ROW WHERE THE KILLER DCD SECONDS INTO THE MATCH. I LOST MY OFFERINGS AND ITEMS. A FEW GAMES LATER I WAS AGAINST A DOCTOR, AS I WAS ABOUT TO YEET OUT THE EXIT GATE HE DCS. I LOSE MY ITEMS AGAIN, NO BP, NO PIP. WHAT THE ACTUAL SHIT
---
I fell victim to one of the classic blunders!
---
THIS GAME IS SO BAD BUT YET IT'S SO ADDICTIVE
---
are you fucking blind im not shitting in mettle i like the perk i am shitting in toxic people who cant bother to try to counter a camper and just dc and harras you fucking braindead
---
Like what? The Blocks? Dream pallets? You really think the drawings are somehow better than slowing down action speed? GTFO of here.
---
How is that a problem? That’s part of the whole issue about running with an unknown team.
---
To call the strategy as “bullshit” and “unfair” doesn’t change the fact that it’s a legitimate strategy - albeit a bad one.
---
Is it cheesy? Yes. It’s like button mashing on a fighting game. It shouldn’t work, but it does. And people love to bitch about it.
---
But any good player knows, you don’t blame the button masher. You adapt, adjust, and win past the cheesy strategy.
---
I didn't say he was responsible fun. I actively stated the OPPOSITE. I said the killer is responsible for engaging with the game and that the game is less fun when they don't. Those are two separate statements.
---
I assume because he's in his own game. That or the fact that there's still a debate over who actually owns the rights to him.
---
Ghost Face is killing it back there
---
It’s still funny
---
you complain about play time but still think ruin is op hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
what? no i never said that ugh fml i don’t wanna argue w/ someone like you
---

I imagine big chapters like this too open the door for future potential partnerships for Behaviour, too.
---
As for me, I'm also a big lore whore so as long as its adapted into the game tastefully with respect to the property at hand &amp; is all around fun and balanced, then BHVR can consider all my boxes ticked.
---
I love the Spirit! I’m a survivor main but whenever I feel like slicing people up I play with her and !! she’s amazing. There’s nothing better than succesfully phasing to a generator that is being fixed and causing a little heart attack to the survivor as you slice them out of nowhere. Highly recommend!
---
For me (also PS4), ghost face is the #1 camper.  Whenever I see him I just assume he's going to camp.
---
I played her for the first time today and went on a 6 win streak. I didn’t spent that much time setting up traps in the begging just 1 at each gen. then when I find someone hook them and put 2-3 traps run away but not too far and wait. Once someone unhooks teleport and chase 1 of them rinse and repeat. That was my Tatic seemed to work well
---
Hell yeah
---
that was actually sick
---
I agree with most of the stuff you said but I still think hag can be good if the person playing knows how to play hag
---
GOTTA LEARN TO HIT THOSE
---
I just started playing nurse about a week ago,  played a few of those games. It's fun but definitely strong
---
I agree with the commenters here that you did not fail, you are asking for ways to improve however and so I'll share the one thing that sticks out to me; that being the transition from the torso to the legs. You made the hips just a tad to narrow which in turn makes the legs look much smaller and inconsistent with the rest of the drawing. You got something going on to be sure, I just suggest getting a bit more familiar with proportions which will help you tremendously in moving forward.

It's girls' locker room.

Ikr? The hitbox should go no further than the tip of his tiny little knife, while the devs are at it vacuums should be brought back as well.

It’s a panic reaction. People see the prompt and just don’t think. QTE muscle memory.

Darling Susie! You definitely did not fail at all. She’s adorable. &lt;3

...i may have forgotten thats how we divide locker rooms :')

I play mostly in red ranks and tbh i rarely see **Good** Nurses even on pc. Most nurses i play against are above average at best.
---
I guess lol
---
LMAO
---
It's not cheating. M1 them or be sure that you can get to a hook.
---
The devs seem to think standing in one place and camping is engaging enough.
---
&gt; Insidious
---
Exactly! In the end he’s not *that* much shorter than the Hag. Yeah, you might not see him coming but thenagain you can’t see the Wraith either so 🤷🏽‍♀️ seems legit.
---
i dont know because i dont care about paid killers perks and you didnt answer my question
---
Just make him half the size of the survivors. Use your imagination. If wraith can be the size of a skyscraper we can have a killer the size of a child!
---
I love legacy in general and I'd say Dwight has the best legacy hands down(wish Ace could have legacy)
---
This is the tryhard perk build. Sometimes I like to run Ruin, Haunted Ground, Devour and Thrill of the Hunt. And sometimes is nice to change Enduring and Spirit Fury for Nurse's Calling and Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
does he realize how lucky he is
---
BHVR literally made perks devoted to helping you stop it, it's 100% intended. It's not even remotely an exploit or cheating or anything. It's a valid strategy to buy more time for their buddies to wiggle at the cost of taking hits themselves.
---
Identity V is ludicrously survivor sided, more news at 11.
---
Bbq is good tho
---
Same I love it on spirit.
---
Unless youre walking to the furthest possible hook, one hit isn't going to help the person you're carrying.  I can't even tell you the last time body blocking actually worked against me.
---
Finally, someone using their imagination! Other people on here are saying he'd have to be in his human form. Why would people think that? Just because something hasn't been done, doesn't mean it can't!
---
Its to attract new players and let people have fun as characters they're already familiar with
---
I thought Silent approach was the hardest. If you aren't prayer beads Spirit or t1 Myers or you farm, survivors will be off  the gen before you can grab them off.
---
Am I the only one who finds chunky to be the most uninteresting and cheesy character ever? I feel like he's just so lame. But that's my opinion. Not dissing any1 who does like him. I just really hope he never gets added.
---
I love advised perk, amazing idea
---
I just started practicing nurse and I have been BULLIED because she is very hard. I am a higher rank killer, so I’ve been going against more experienced survivors and they have been tea bagging/trolling me. While it’s very frustrating, you just have to keep going and you’ll get better! 
---
While I’ve been practicing nurse, I messaged the survivors and told them that I was a baby and asked them to not be toxic. Every time I’ve done that I got a positive response! Might be worth a shot to try that out. I’ve also made some friends from it!
---
U are a dick, but the perk is good until 3 stacks.
---
legion is the new pre buff freddy
---
Bumblebee new killer confirmed
---
Power: run over.
---
Run in straight line in car form. any survivor hit will receive 1 state of damage and a speed debuff along with loss of senses, making its controls similar to carrying a survivor, or a drunk person. Pallets hit are destroyed. Hitting a wall will result in a stun
---
Like hillbilly, needs charge to work. Charges really fast, but cant move while doing so
---
Add ons
---
Hand canon: switches your power to a hand canon that will instadown any survivor hit by it. Has a 250 second cd to shot again and deal small aoe damage. 
---
Bumper car: negates stun when hitting walls.
---
Nitro: run over becomes even faster, but adds a stun after hitting pallets, and prologns stun from hiting walls
---
Perks: 
---
"radio noises"
---
All gens have a modification that will increase its noise according to its progression.
---
Pontentially will make survivors near it think its close to being done while its at 50%
---
"All spark"
---
The gens are secretly your allies thanks to the tecnology from your planet. 1/2/3 fake generators will be spawned per trial. If a survivor tries to fix it, it'll activate and deal 1 state of damage to them. Only hits the survivor who touched it first.
---
"Michael bay"
---
When a survivor miss a gen skill check, they'll receive a debuff that prevents them hearing for X seconds.
---
I started making this as a joke, but idk why i did something a little more serious after writing for a while.
---
know your f**kin place, trash!
---
Sounds awesome, could it be the demogorgon? In which case would that mean this could be the first truly feral/monstrous killer in the game. Not sure hag counts since shes is atleast a little humanish.
---
just kidding I'm in the same situations lmao
---
BBQ, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Brutal Strength, Whispers, Shadowborn, Pop Goes The Weasel, A Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher, Save The Best For Last... take your pick.
---
You'll probably want at least 2 perks devoted to loops if you aren't extremely confident in your ability to Stalk Survivors all the way to Marked before they can get to loop. That leaves a slot for BBQ (because honestly who doesn't want extra BP?) and a tracking perk or slowdown perk depending on what you feel like you need.
---
If you can Stalk people to Marked frequently, you can bring either more slowdown perks, or utility stuff like Shadowborn, STBFL, etc instead of looping perks.
---
Damn that is a lot better!
---
Men and women don't share locker room.  It'd create lots of problem if they do. 
---
This is women's locker room.  That one being the only locker opened and Meg being the only one there does mean that it is her own locker.
---
That can only be triggered if conditions are met, which won’t be by smart killers, unlike the original, weaker.
---
How does this stuff happen? I see it all the time...
---
*Whispers* Is this a pig clone?
---
Bodyblocking is actually listed as a reportable offense not that anyone pays attention to it. It's less the fact youre able to get around it more the fsct that youre exploiting hitboxes
---
I don't know if you remember, but there's a scene in Slaughter Sinema where a woman was standing on a platform in a bikini scaring people. The group in front of me saw her and proceeded to catcall her for a solid twenty seconds before moving on. I busted a big fat tear and tried to cheer up the actress (who was obviously upset), but it completely ruined the house for me
---
I really enjoyed going my last year as it was my first time but by the end of the night everyone was drunk and being assholes
---
Hag is insane, what do you mean? Sure you get some traps erased, but you can basically camp an unhook from across the map and you can teleport to Survivors for free hits ezpz. Throw in some MYC and Mint Rag and you're an unstoppable killing machine.
---
The issue is everyone tries to play Hag like shes a normal Killer. She isn't your normal "just run the loop and mindgame it by moonwalking" jam, she's just a different playstyle of Killer. She requires a different mindset than most Killers, which is why so many people seem to think she's not any good.
---
I rewatched last last part at least 10 times. I still don't see what the hell you're aiming at. Good throw o.O
---
I have a couple of friends who play the game both on console and PC and the skill checks are different. The framerate issue impacts them on console as skill checks are client side. They're easier to hit on PC, so you are correct. Ultimately having dbd be xplat isn't viable.
---
SOMEONES never heard of equivalent exchange lol

For demonic worship, the ultimate good must be sacrificed to gain the ultimate “evil”. That’s why the ancient Chaldeans for example (who have a religion similar to the Babylonian talmud of Islam, as in kabbalism) would “put their newborns in fire”. A woman would have a ritual while pregnant and then kill the child once it is born. The “gods” love that nonsense. The gods are energy driven.

True dat,
---
I almost died for that Meg,luckily we escaped both.
---
Hmm, that's true, mechanically giving him a leap would be the same. Maybe he should be able to climb on terrain and jump off of it!
---
The game is trying to tell you something. Go start playing camping Legion! (pls don't tho)
---
He was just depressed and quiet in school bro
---
I don't think size would stop the developers from making it work. He's heavily requested, and can probably make a lot of money.
---
Try Legion Cosplay
---
Iron Will: silence not matter what.
---
Monitor: u are on top of the survivor before they noticed.
---
We’ll make it: is an alternative at borrow time.
---
Stridor(? Nurse perk): counter Iron will.
---
Spies: dude every god damn map has crows.
---
You stop getting BP after 4 shocks or so, no?
---
Doc is an M1 killer who plays screaming goat VFX constantly. 
---
Not good at all. Nobody wants to fight him tho.

A massacre
---
A doll that comes to life and starts murdering people. That's horrifying. I don't find ghostface or legion scary, they just dudes with knifes that run.
---
It's just not an exploit. Nowhere is it listed as a reportable offense on any official BHVR material, because it isn't.
---
The bodyblocking you're talking about being a bannable offense is the kind where the Killer blocks people in the basement to hold the game hostage (which they patched out a little while ago I believe)
---
I think that would be too niche and could be useless on maps such as the game
---
Having Steve in the game just doesn't make sense to me as long as he's alive in the show
---
I feel like the devs are wanting to put movable items on every few skins just for the practice even if it’s completely unnecessary. We must protest this. 
---
We need boob physics.
---
Itson the endgame scorecard where you can report players i believe
---
Really rare, and i just used it instantly to try out pig, and get a 3man swf with only one kill  
---
Hello darkness, my old friend
---
*Shh* no it’s not haha. This one’s way smaller. And no traps. Just a doll.
---
but then you have adrenaline and a key
---
Shaun is probably my most wanted DLC for DbD. Let me know if you have any criticisms! And YES! his last name is Riley
---
Oh for sure, I don't think ghost face or legion are really scary either. I just prefer something a little more realistic, yet still scary. Like Michael Myers. (Yes I know he is not completley realistic but is on the realistic side compared to a living doll.)
---
I think you're confusing "hard to play against" with "easy to play".
---
She's hard to master, but it's also very hard to outplay her.
---
That said,  it *is possible*.
---
Devs said that that refers to basement blocking, bodyblocking a survivor into a corner etc. No hook blocking
---
I know right. I would have looped him the whole time and he wouldn't have got any hook points or sacrifices for that matter lol. He may have disconnected instead.
---
As much as I'd want that, it will never happen. 
---
However I will settle for markers in the post game lobby showing who was SWF with who. I've had waaaaay to many people try to lie and weasel out of the truth.
---
Yeah lol
---
2-3 blink nurses are actually fun to verse against. I wouldn't even mind if I die because at least it's a fun match.
---
Beats getting tunnelled by Huntress/Pig/Hag.
---
Doesn’t really work against a bubba buddy. He still downs one
---
If you want to buy the DLC killer with money DON'T buy Spirit. She absolutely is one of the best killers BUT you can just play the game, farm Iridescent Shards and buy her for free. The two killers you should look at are Leatherface because of his Perk BBQ and Chilli which may be the best perk in the game and Myers because you get a fun killer, descent killer perks and Decisive Strike for survivors which is a must for tunneling killers.
---
Not if you’re quick enough
---
When you hook 2-3 people within 60 seconds of eachother and you down one of the people who got off the hook first and they still have DS despite hooking 2 others has nothing to do with being a "smart killer" it has to do with the fact that its duration is too long for a "tunneling" punishment since no one tunnels for 60 seconds
---
That's for killer bodyblocking to hold the game hostage. Bodyblocking to prevent a hook or hit is an intended mechanic.
---
It’s fun cause a few days ago, someone post bout how bad design Game was for killers, while this map is one of the most killer friendly maps(totem spawns was one of the reasons I gave)but if u didn’t win is cause u played bad, the map still have enough pallets to run a killer around while 3 guys do gens.
