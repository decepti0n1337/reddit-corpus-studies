So you want it where the killer is forced to take 4 DS if they want to hook a survivor more than once?
---
Because the only thing that distinguished Dart is the yellow line on his back I think. Not too much of a 'modification' to constitute it being a paid cosmetic. Maybe it can be a cosmetic for buying the Stranger Things bundle?
---
You can bet it was said in post game chat by the killer who needs NOED on Billy.
---
I'm not sure why, but the evil incarnate achievement graphic makes me laugh.
---
Actually, it‚Äôs more connection-based than hitbox-based. In fact, the only true ‚Äúhit box‚Äù issues I remember are survivors getting hit by hatchets way above them while healing, and old pallet slams having a radius well beyond the pallet model. Most issues players blame on hitboxes are actually caused by lag.
---

---
Like a survivor sliding across a pallet and getting hit after they‚Äôve landed on the other side. The survivor‚Äôs hitbox isn‚Äôt still on the killer‚Äôs side of the pallet or on top of the pallet, *to the survivor*. To the killer, however, latency causes the survivor to start their pallet slide later, and thus land on the opposite side later. If that delay is large enough, the killer can easily hit what they see as a survivor just starting to vault the pallet, while the survivor sees that they‚Äôve already finished the vault and are clearly on the ground.
---
The issue isn‚Äôt the survivor‚Äôs *hitbox* trailing behind them; it‚Äôs that the killer sees the *entire survivor* (hitbox, player model, actions) a fraction of a second in the past, and the larger that fraction is (i.e. the laggier either side is), the more bullshit the hit looks.
---
Yeah they're pussy.
---
Lol nah.
---
Amen my dude!
---
Lol yea.
---
This pic makes me tingly
---
I'm just dcing when I play on a fucking corn map cuz there is nothing more unfair then that shit
---
You say that, but I'm tempted to start running Haunted Ground as my only totem in my build.
---
Yea, the only "meta" things it works against is BBQ and Nurse's. And Nurse's eats up the tokens nearly instantly
---
well, every perk should have a counter, right?
---
+ if the killer camps your body then you give your teammates the opportunity to do gens for one minute which can cost the killer the whole match
---
Right....
---
Thats a lot of exposed perks you got their chief
---
Dude, you need to practice your grammar.
---
&gt;I think the DS timer is BS becuase the killer could literally just leave you on the ground and slug you until the timer runs out. Why Does it have a timer anyway wtf
---
A solo generator takes 80s to complete. DS timer lasts 60s. If the killer is camping your body, the amount of generator progress he hopefully lost, can't be recovered. It is not the best outcome for the DS user but the damage is done either way.
---
Personally I think DS is in a perfect spot but I wouldn't mind if the timer was slowed by half while slugged, to punish the killer even more for tunneling while not removing the counter to the perk. It would also help when killers hard camp and tunnel you near an exit gate.
---
Petition to make people actually play a new character before they start bitching about nerfs/buffs
---
I‚Äôd rather go against a Nurse or Spirit than Billy. Even though Nurse is stronger, Billy still feels like the cheapest cunt in the game.
---
Oh, i wasnt saying I'm against the idea of it letting you attempt escape, I was just pointing out how the outcome could be different with those perks
---
Dont call him that. wraith is a cutie
---
No, its already strong as fuck
---
That's the risk of running the perk bighead.
---
whatever floats ur boat
---
I'd  be more happy for the upside down world petition
---
Perks should not be thought of as the factor in ranking up. I play perkless for the most part because the game has become too perk dependant and second chance dependant and I miss the purity of the pre-DS days. You do not need perks to rank up or play well. So don‚Äôt think of it as: how do I improve my perk build so I rank up, rethink your approach. Respectully, The problem probably lies in your play.
---
So that said the way you rank up is twofold: game sense and chases. Game sense meaning, knowing escape routes, understanding time efficiency, such as when you should be going for a save vs. When you should be doing a gen. Also the ability to go on reasonably extended chases without burning pallets too often or too quickly, even if you inevitably go down or the killer switches to another target.
---
Other tips: don‚Äôt be afraid to run everywhere. I can‚Äôt stand Sprint Burst users who walk to preserve it. Imagine how much more time efficient they could be running between objectives etc. 
---
I party with a variety of friends of varying ranks and they are always surprised when I run no perks and put up 24k and survive etc. It‚Äôs not hard to do, it‚Äôs difficult to master though. Learn how to run jungle gyms, the killer shack, and L-T wall combos.
---
Try to determine the killers perks as quickly as possible. If someone gets hooked and the killer comes right to you, suspect BBQ and adjust. If you‚Äôre healing and they change course on you, assume Nurse‚Äôs. Etc.
---
Always be doing SOMETHING. Be doing a gen, be running for a save, be cleansing a totem, be actively looking for what pallets are available, note where the exits are, determine the basement‚Äôs location. Try to always have a purpose. Never be the guy crouched behind a rock for 40 seconds because you heard the heartbeat for a few seconds. Do not fear the killer. You should want to be chased because it‚Äôs fun, but also because you need to possess the skill necessary to run him or her around for at least two gens worth of progress early in the game.
---
It‚Äôs called a lunge slash from killer. Different killers have difference reaches
---
Notice how I said *bought* and not *earned*? Guess not.
---
Unpopular opinion, I prefer leather face
---
So you got punched in the face four times back then. We are still getting punched in the face today, but just only once or twice. We are still getting punched in the face and have a just reason to complain. 
---
Just because it sucked more back then doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt still suck now.
---
I mean if im on the other side completely and still get hit
---
Who said there wouldn't be a Halloween event?
---
Then why even have a rank?
---
Not confirmed but im pretty sure its gonna be some time this week
---
This is funny.
---
But as a hag player, gtfo if unhooked.  When I teleport back I try to go after the savior, but if you're still around or your savior just zooped out...well then...I'm sorry little one.
---
&gt;Whats the point of jumping windows etc if the killer can hit me when im on the other side already
---
You just need to jump through the window of more distance, otherwise the killer can just hit you over it. Same thing for small walls or fences. 
---
&gt;*Being hit through the window is by design. A window is an opened element and killers should be able to reach through it. Players suffering from desynchronization issues will have the feeling that they are getting hit through the window when they are much further away.*

Dude I‚Äôd weep.
---
I did not. Am tired after work tho.
---
Eh. I find that most people don't cleanse it then. At least at my rank. However, some do on the off chance its Devour so I could see it working
---
He's a pretty weak killer, especially if he doesn't have great perks yet. Maybe he just wants that one kill?
---
Damn, you gave that Freddy that smoke. Desperation is the worse spot to be in if you're killer. lol
---
O ok i see now
---
Make the game fun? A killer job is to kill survivors, dont make the game fun, i y already have fun killing them, wtf is making the game fun?
---
Oh yeah, I might be toxic for doing so, but these perks are a lot of fun for me to run
---
This still comes down to telling people not to play a character just because you dont want them to. Keep giving balance feedback, dont tell people "please dont" when they talk about wanting to play a killer.
---
I meant that for when Inner Strength and the other new perks come out.
---
THE DING DONGS
---
I said in my original comment that we shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to struggle after the attempt..
---
And I‚Äôm sure they could code it to force the attempts if you‚Äôre the last survivor alive to avoid people wasting a minute of the killer‚Äôs time without doing anything.
---
A compromise could even been it only happens if you have an active deliverance. My point is I played smart for the entire game and had a failsafe for that very reason, but because I was trying to get injured people out I went down right as everyone left making my failsafe perk useless.
---
I fucking KNEW it was gonna be a GTA edit xD. I‚Äôm crying dude help ;)
---
Eh good killers should and would still the slug, it creates pressure and forces another survivor to get the guy off the ground.
---
The spaghetti code of the game included ridiculously long patch times for even small patches. It's gotten better but it was reeaaaallly bad for some time.

Aww lucky! And eüÖ±Ô∏èic pebble!ü§©

Have a great chapter and day my guy

No fucking way
---
OMG the Wraith bots. It really has been so long... One time I was cued with a Wraith bot. We finished the Gen and were farming hits/heals at the end. Then all of a sudden he started playing and downed us all. It scared the piss out of me but man was it a funny/fun play by the Wraith.
---
I really should've. Especially if I had my axe.
---
Well then they could just stay in the hurt mode and wipe out all of the survivors. If they did help they would be getting gen rushed even harder.
---
YES FINALLY 
---
**P E B B L E**
---
can we get an F
---
You should watch the third season. Easily my favorite season of the show so far.
---
I love this
---
That's pretty nice!
---
The only thing I would've changed are the shoes (not sure, but looks kinda off) and make the clothes slightly look more consumed
---
Except those little things, looks awesome
---
*P E B B L E  T I M E*
---
Flip-Flop and Tenacity are situational and Boil Over is just useless.
---
All I see are 600.000 Bloodpoints to get when the PTB starts (maybe next Tuesday?). Better than the last week's shrine because I don't have Quentin's perk (Wake Up).
---
At low ranks I get it, because you''ll have 3 claudettes crouching around you doing absolutely nothing while he camps you until the timer's gone.  
---
But at higher ranks your teammates will know to do gens and 3 people getting a free 60 seconds worth of gen progress is devastating to the killers game.
---
We've been getting good killer perks, hope there's some good survivor ones next week.
---
went ahead and removed this one as someone has posted about the shrine update with the name of each perk on the shrine and was posted before you
---
*muffled scream*
---
what? SWF?
---
In my experience I don‚Äôt use NOED as I want to prove I have the skill to kill them without it
---
No, but if the killer is connecting to other players with a 5mbps WiFi connection, they‚Äôll also be connecting to any dedicated servers with a 5mbps WiFi connection. So the connection between players will be that *plus* the survivor‚Äôs individual latencies. Whereas in a direct connection, the two can overlap and equal only the worse of the two, not the sum (like two North Dakota players connecting to Chicago dedicated servers, for example).
---
** P E B B L E **
---
Maybe next time, I'll weather the outfit more.
---
Ty for the words and critique.
---
What do the tokens do?
---
Spirit takes awhile to get good with while Billy is pretty easy. In my mind Billy is better because of his one shot ability and with the Spirit being harder to use.
---
went ahead and removed this one as someone has posted about the shrine update
---
When you are a rank 11 killer and you have to face 2x tier 2. I got bullied as hell XD
---
As a Billy main my heart sank reading your reply. Do people really feel that way about Billy? I thought people enjoyed going against him as he's definitely got a decent bit of counter-play. 
---
I can fully understand if the Billy is using insta-saw, that sucks. Even Spirit Fury is no-go for me and is incredibly unfun to play against. Maybe i might change main. I really don't like people not having fun.
---
I use Spine chill to vault faster in a chase
---
This was a thing for a while after launch. Not just in beta.  It lead to a LOT of dodging to the point where high rank survivors could almost never play the game.  Trust me, not being able to see ranks beforehand is for the best
---
No its 8 meters on Tier 1, thats why M&amp;A gives you 0 meters
---
I miss ultra rare perks
---
Ah! they are all a bit like that thb!
---
You could get a little jump scared but if you play the game long enough you'll get use to it. I used to get jumpscared but I'm fine now.
---
Or maybe see them till rank 17 or so, so we can go easy on newbies.
---
No one can fix Toxic Meg
---
Understandable :)
---
YOU WHAT?!?
---
&gt;Eh good killers should and would still the slug, it creates pressure and forces another survivor to get the guy off the ground.
---
I know, which is the good part about the new DS. There are two direct counters. Dont tunnel and if you tunnel, slug. 
---
The change I suggested is just to punish killers that not only tunnel, but also camp your body. The outcome is pretty much the same as the 60s DS but it would be punish them even harder while not affecting "good killers" so much because they usually don't play like this. It would work exactly like EGC when someone is downed, the timer is immediately slowed. You still would have the option to chase that person for 60s while not actually hitting them, to avoid having the DS timer slowed. 
---
Just some ideas. Like I said, DS is a very good spot currently.
---
Pebble
---
Of course now ruin is here right when I buy bbq and chili last week
---
When Flip Flip first came out, I used it with Boil Over to get the achievement where you have to wiggle out in the first day or two. Since then, slugging doesn't seem as prevalent, despite the changes to DS (which I'm guessing is why some of Ash's perks may have been introduced).
---
lol at thinking looping takes no skill.
---
thank you for understanding :)
---
Bought Michael a few days ago for Play With Your Food since I managed to get Save The Best For Last a few weeks ago now it's here. Smh.
---
But at least I can get the Pebble now!! Time to actually have fun with the game.
---
Every match the killer messages me on how dumb I am for using blue hair feng, because it gives away my location. I‚Äôm just trying to look cool üò©
---
how is standing still a mindgame?
---

---
OMG Y ES PEBBLE

---
oh and ruin too
---
1st 1 to post this. Now an influx of 2nd rate news commence RIP sub reddit- for the next 2 days...
---
&gt;This is why we need to be able to at least attempt an escape when everyone else is dead/out. 
---
And then the hunters start camping you at the ens until you reach struggle phase
---
being able to try wouldnt do much for you anyway
---
The hatch will also be visible but closed and locked when more generators are completed compared to survivors still alive.
---
For example.
---
Hatch will spawn closed and locked but visible when
---
4 gens done with 3 survivors alive.
---
3 or more gens done when 2 survivors are alive.
---
Ohhh, yeah that makes sense, I was just assuming you meant it‚Äôd be an easy win and thus shouldn‚Äôt be possible.
---
Wards shouldn't be in the game for Survivor or killer. The only people who use them are people with thousands of hours logged and have hundreds of wards.
---
It's always used for overpowered shit like ridiculously Decked Out tool boxes or sniper Billy and instadown Huntress.
---
I just think it's ridiculous that people can have hundreds of black or white Wards and never get punished for how they play. Considering how common items are anyway at least.
---
Furtive Chase is a wonky little perk and it has a really funny effect and a really useless one. The useless one is lowering your TR in a chase. The good one is swapping obsession. This is good because of Make Your Choice and Devour Hope. You kinda have to finesse it a bit but MYC and Devour Hope means the survivors are constantly on an exposed threat. If Devour Hope gets cleansed keep rotating your obsession with MYC.
---
Yeah that makes some sense, but  the community can be pretty toxic and I feel like some killers would mori/tunnel them on purpose
---
Kinda looks like spirits passive phase
---
Confirmed. You are salty.
---
Judging from the dozen+ downvotes your comments this thread has, and your post history.... I'm going to guess you're either a Troll or just socially retarded and someone one likes talking to.

---
Which one is pebble and why is everyone so gassed?
---
I'm not sure if it's just because survivor is so much more popular than killer or if the game just doesn't matchmaking killers to the survivors. It sucks to be put up against rank 5+ killers at only rank 15. I understand that not as many people play the game but they need to fix matchmaking.
---
Nea looking like shes about to try and sue the AC for being sexist because it's too cold.

If you look good, you feel good. If you feel good, you do good. You do good, you win.

Like many streamers and content creators, they just ain't as honest. That's the difference
---
After screaming from a shock survivors can't drop pallets for a few seconds. Could run brutal strength to kick the early pallets faster in conjunction with this tip.
---
How would he reach the hooks
---
They always run to the corner of the map just to get healed - _-
---
I was so excited when he launched!! Thank you for the heads up :)
---
This is how I play Myers. It's very effective at mid ranks. I don't remember the last time I got less than 3k with this method. After the first few jumpscares, the survivors start doing nothing, and just slowly walking around because they have no idea where you're coming from.
---
The ding sound plays when the skill check appears, not for hitting the skill check, you probably just missed it.

apolgy for poor english

where were u when demogorgon outfit release

i was sat at work when reddit 
---
‚Äòdemogorgon have outfit‚Äô
---
‚Äòyes‚Äô
---
I don't run kindered anymore because even with it my teammates don't work on gens together even if there is only one left.  And the rare times the killer decides to facecamp I guess it does save your team some time but it's overall not worth it if you ask me. It really only makes sure that your teammates can't say "I thought someone else was going to you, I wanted to work on a gen." or stuff like that.
---
I win about half the time the killer closes the hatch
---
I wouldn't call this week's perks for survivor BAD. Both perks are okay this week. The only perk I would say is a bad perk this week is PWYF.
---
Yeah during this upcoming blood hunt I plan on leveling him up a bit because he gives me jump scares as a survivor, so I just want to return the favor.
---
Why would you ever leave the suit

It‚Äôs his alternate outfit when he comes out. Probably a reference to the end of season 3, could be the demogorgon they had caged up, maybe in season 4 we‚Äôll see it in chains or something, after all the Russians had that 7 foot Demogorgon cage.
---
For me, it's kinda like the straw on the camels back, she is already good, and then she gets these additions to her kit; like she doesn't actually climb through windows, she has passive phasing, you can't hear the phasing on her terror radius, her phasing isn't directional, prayer beads exist, and all of her other add-ons are very strong.
---
I‚Äôm so happy with the games current state right now.
---
It‚Äôs still not PERFECT, but even just comparing to maybe 5-6 months ago, I feel like the game has been a lot healthier. I love seeing our community coming together for the Stranger Things promo and being excited for the Roadmap ahead for us.
---
I think it could make for an interesting killer (everyone's perspective on the FNAF series notwithstanding), but I don't think this power is powerful enough to consider them viable. I'd throw in some kind of stalking mechanic (similar to The Ghost Face or The Shape), and maybe have some kind of marionette or Pirate's Cove that survivors have to constantly come back to to interact with, or risk suffering from the Broken status effect/their auras exposed for X time.
---
It's generally a good idea to come up with unique perks for your killer as well when throwing an idea in like this, even if you can't draw symbols for them or anything
---
Honestly thought about it, but I'm gonna have to level up adam for deliverance either way. Didn't seem worth it to me
---
Lol nah, I just don't know how to write out the sound, but I can definitely tell the difference of the sounds when the skill check pop ups and when you press space inside the great skill check "zone." If only I had been recording when this happened.
---
I never use pallets because I always forget lol What happens if you use a dream pallet?
---
BBQ, Ruin, Diversion... what's going on? Good perks?
---
Removed someone already posted this thank you for understanding
---
**UUUUURRRRRRHHHHHHHHH.** *-whack-*
---
Well its basically a free escape even if it has been changed you still get a free escape no matter what
---
Lol I can totally relate to this. I kept point at him to let me heal &amp; heal me, he just self fucking care himself for the entire time.
---
And how are survivors meant to close a ceiling portal?
---
It's just confused me how they've given us so much info and now we gotta wait another week or more.
---
But that's okay.
---
Literally getting carried in the match
---
And the devs said that it ‚Äútakes so much skill‚Äù to loop.
---
Yeah this game is really great when it's not super glitchy/buggy. I doubt they're going to do anything about this though.
---
The ‚Äúreal‚Äù Pallet will adjust the camera since it has collision, whereas the fake one will just clip through the Camera and obscure your vision.
---
Not very useful mid-chase, but if you‚Äôre hiding and want to check, that‚Äôs pretty useful.
---
From what I see he always changes his name to random things the same as tru3.
---
But she isn‚Äôt scary. Intimidating, yes. Scary? No. She‚Äôs just a big Russian girl with a big Russian axe. They mean creepy in performance and/or looks.
---
That flashlight is trash
---
Most of the reccomendations are good for beginners, so I will just tell you to not play spirit, nurse, or trapper until you get pretty good and know the layout of each map and survivor spawns, etc. Leatherface is really simple and fun to play, but not fun to play against. He is great for a starting killer, especially BBQ and chilli and  franklins demise are solid perks to start with and unlock as a teachable. Good luck in the Fog!
---
PS: dont question survivor hitboxes
---
So now Claudette is stealthing inside killers clothes now
---
I play wraith and doctor pretty equally, and I find both to be fun to play. I like doctor a bit more, but it is fun to use the muffled/silent bell and the silent warrior add-ons to do a jumpscare/surprise attack build.
---
Personally it should be merged since if your a good killer that can end chases within 60 seconds you'll still get hit with ds
---
Can you tell I never use em? XD
---
Pretty good. Instantly recognizable.
---
Even if PS4 is moderated by snowflakes what does it matter? If you're getting toxic messages then just block the person or turn off messages. If you're referring to the in-game report feature I can assure you that it won't work much better on PC. You'll just have a better chance of finding new players. Just seems like a waste of money.
---
I dont understand why NoeD is feared. Doesnt expose activate once exit doors are open? Why not just leave and survive?
---
Glad to hear it.
---
Except when they hit you anyway
---
When do you think dedicated servers will be tested?
---
Agreed.
---
That's been known for a while and last I checked its intentional
---

Just get it so you won't later

lol survivor mains that keep crying for killers to be nerfed when the game is easily survivor favored in a SWF setting (assuming competency) crack me up.. must be because most other killers can be looped on half infinites and pallets at every loop for 5 Gens and you hate that you can't get a free escape.

But I'm shit so i feel like my paid nea shirt labels me as a target bc they dont have to chase me long to find out that this is me.

What is a good technique for, first, notifying survivors that I want to farm bloodpoints on console, then what to actually do to farm the most bloodpoints?

Why did you smack him after hooking him?

Yeah. I try not to tunnel vision but sometimes they make it personal by teabagging and pointing lol

Why cant billy and bubba use thier chainsaws to cut it? Then no other killer has to deal with that bs

Welcome! I still remember how much fun it was to play the game for the first time. Countless hours later, I still love this game. Always nice to see new people in the fog!

Oh and the people who complain about matchmaking lengths nowadays never struggled through the time when just loading into the game could take an upward of 10 mins without any indication of how far along it was. That loading bar was really great
---
All hit detection in games is client side and ALL networking has to be ran to a server..... jesus. A dedicated server is the same exact thing as what BHVR is running right now, just privately.

1) you have to hit a skill check so it‚Äôs not free
---
2) the killer has to be tunneling you on order for you to use it.
---
Paulie Esther is pretty good.
---
He's really good for his unlockable perk Barbeque and Chilli, it gives you 25% extra blood points for each different survivor you hook and stacks up to 4 so you basically get double points to spend if you hook all 4 survivors. It's a great perk to unlock first so then once you play other killers you can gain points faster! Wish you the best of luck and welcome to the fog
---
Puppers is my go to! OhTofu is also great!
---
I don‚Äôt care about bp or ranking up. I just want to kill as fast as possible, it‚Äôs fun for me
---
The reason I bought the game and played it was to have fun, and I can have it by killing as fast as possible and maybe toying with people I know I‚Äôve won against from time to time. Doing it for competition and ranking up? Not fun for me. Not at all. Makes me angry whenever I don‚Äôt win in fact, almost making me toxic! I don‚Äôt wanna be toxic, I wanna be happy and have fun! So I do as I please long as it ain‚Äôt against the rules.
---
ds next week? :/
---
Oh, you poor, poor thing...
---
Prepare yourself for the toxicity and camping which is about to ensue...
---
Another one has fallen in the trap, boys
---
*Magic*
---
&gt; The other option isn‚Äôt any prettier, though. If hit detection is registered server-side, that means killers would need to lead survivors with their melee attacks based on their own latency.
---
You never heard of lag compensation? You haven't had to lead shots based on latency with server-side hit detection since Quake.
---
you talk about the eye on the bottle ?
---
Wait there's a roadmap coming?
---
I used to run we'll make it with borrowed time and be the ultimate unhooker guy but most fuckin people cant read the damn thing and dont see me chasing them at mach 5 like the damn killer themselves so fuck this perk and fuck these people
---
I was there, at the beginning
---
One is normal. Two, I understand. More than that is just out of hand
---
I'm on PC, don't even own a console, so nope.
---
First BBQ NOW RUIN! 
---
Survivors mains on suicide watch
---
It has begun.
---
Who cares if we live if we look GOOD.
---
They had a better keyboard, sorry bud
---
Yikes. Someone‚Äôs overly defensive. It‚Äôs a joke m8.
---
Yo bro thanks for the info, but if the swings and survivor movement were server-sided, wouldn't there be lag compensation?
---

To be fair tunneling and hook camping is pretty similar to looping in its goals and what it does. They both waste time for the opposing team forcing them to focus their attention and multiple resources on saving/killing a survivor. While camping is less interactive obviously I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs even more essential in some cases as of a survivor finds a good looping spot and can loop you for 3-4 minutes it‚Äôs better to just take the L and pay close attention to their hook for 2 minutes rather than go through another 6-8 minutes of looping. 
---
Both strategies are pretty unfun for the opposing team and make the game less fun in my opinion, also in a lot of scenarios there‚Äôs not much a killer can do to avoid ‚Äúhook camping‚Äù if you see 2-3 survivors running to unhook someone, the survivors sandbag their teammate, or just leave their teammate in the dust, just like there‚Äôs not much as a survivor you can do to avoid looping unless you want to just get hooked.
---
Umbra is great. She mainly plays Huntress(and she's fucking good), and some Billy and Spirit. Recently, shes been playing some Survivor as well
---
Hi rank 1 LF main here, and I would just like to tell all yoh other lf mains... get gud scrubs. No but he is very strong you just have to be careful rather than go hard with the saw.
---
I mean.... You're not wrong
---
Both killers and survivors should use teachables because they can provide leverage and help abilities and playstyles.
---
Maybe he can have his Decoy's hide in Lockers and he can teleport to them from across the map
---
So far its been a year for me but to be fair, i play survivor once a month
---
Can confirm, am browsing Reddit while waiting for a match as killer
---
For real. The reddit has all the best of the best members of said community though.
---
*Love you guys*
---
No... It's random I thought?
---
EGC is perfect as is, even a little killer sided depending on exit gates location RNG. 
---
The point of EGC is simply force a match to end. Is not to give killers free kills or give survivors a free escape. 
---
Having the timer starts when the exit gates are powered is too strong if someone is being chased. Even if they choose to implement this feature, the only outcome would be the other 3 survivors leaving ASAP without thinking twice in saving the 4th one. As a killer you would want the remaining survivors to be altruistic and try to go for a save so you can maybe snowball from there, even with zero gens left.
---
I think Your biggest sin was running deerstalker
---
Slap the killer
---
This is the buff to The Nightmare that BHVR has been telling us about for forever. We all thought it was the rework, but the \*real\* nightmare has been OP this entire time
---
I mean, I take it as learning how to get chased better and have seen great improvement each match I get focused to the point of consistently juking killers now.
---
If I notice someone being tunneled as another survivor (oh yeah, I main survivors btw at like a 10-1 ratio) I try to be annoying  or distract the killer.
---
Idk man, I'm still new but being tunneled makes me feel like I'm "The Main Character in This Movie" and I sorta enjoy it in a way so I guess I'm wierd like that.
---
Dont see why I was downvoted doe  :&lt;.

*trapper looks down at a Claudette, Claudette slaps him with it, trapper is now A N G E R Y*

I play survivor on the weekends mainly, but today had some friends on so I gave it ago
---
Community is terrible. I played spirit against a swf where 2 of them DC‚Äôd soon as I caught them. Which was like first 2-3 mins. Then I destroyed the other 2. I didn‚Äôt give last person hatch and I had a survivor pudding. As they wasted my offering I didn‚Äôt give hatch. But after the game I got told to kill my self and that I was a pay2win. Also that I was a noob killer because I have to play with ruin. Makes sense right .
---
They have 28 and 81 on them, second row
---
Cool you healed me and now I'm being tunneled by the killer who returned to the hook and found me being healed by you right there. Just run BT.
---
Fr
---
1: Playing Nurse is not a solution.
---
2: You claim the survivors on separate generators is "common" and then act like I'm inventing some sort of "perfect" situation in the same breath. All the survivors on separate generators does nothing.
---
3: Ruin only slows down a generator if you can't hit Greats, otherwise the generator still only takes 64 (purple toolboxes) to 80 (no toolboxes) seconds, and it only takes 69.56 seconds with your common/uncommon toolboxes (which survivors have pretty much an infinite supply of).
---
4: Everything else you listed either requires hooking/downing a survivor, or requires that you not be chasing a survivor.
---
Your average situation against solos used to working through Ruin with your weakest toolbox still sees three generators popping in 70 seconds.
---
Map design, exhaustion perks, and large buildings simply are not designed to catch a survivor through safe pallets within 70 seconds.
---
*This is the AVERAGE.*
---
It is no "perfect game"; a perfect situation would be the survivors running Leader+Resilience+No Mither and slamming out the first four generators in under fifty seconds with a purple toolbox and a BNP and then popping the last generator (together) in 25\~ seconds.
---
I still don't know how it's possible for survivors to find a match in 00000.01 seconds and killers an entire hour
---
Its when the last gen is done.
---
#MINDGAME 100
---
The only time I do this is when the person misses several skill checks in a row and runs when they do. I just move away and self care so I can get it done
---
Do you think barbeque and distortion would be in the same same shrine?
---
No I do, I'm saying I'm fine with that. It only counters Myers mories anyway
---
Well I got it, so nbd
---
The whole point of the End Game Collapse is to put pressure on Survivors during end game, but high rank Survivors have effectively gotten around it by just 99% the Exit Gates then opening them when it's safe.
---
It would not only be good change consistency wise, but decent change balance wise.
---
And to be clear, this *doesn't* change 1v1 situations, only the dynamic of the Exit Gates being powered by Survivors repairing 5 generators.
---

But are the Stranger Things fans playing it right now? I assume they wouldn't get the game until the DLC comes out (as I did with the Ash vs Evil Dead DLC).
---
Fog used to be thicc asf
---
It takes forever for me on PS4, either as survivor or killer, SWF isn't even worth trying lmao
---
On PC, it takes a while as killer but it's fast af as survivor. Too bad i'm a killer main tho :(
---
Replace self care with unbreakable!
---
At the very beginning of the video you can see him lag back a bit
---

---
&gt; (like most games that run on dedicated servers) hit detection is client-side. This means that the killer‚Äôs computer determines whether the attack hits, and the server determines when the attack hits.
---
This compound hit-detection system, where the server controls when damage is distributed based on client-side aim, is what's known as "lag compensation." This is the system the works great in Quake, CS GO, CoD, or any symmetrical multiplayer game.
---
Take another look at the paragraph starting with "In DBD however," to see why the lag compensation that most other games utilize won't work here.

Well now I‚Äôm conflicted. I was planning on buying the hag for ruin and devour hope to use with a five hex totem spirit for the new chapter. But now I wonder if it‚Äôs better to just buy ruin and forget about devour hope or save my shards and just buy the hag.
---
As people have pointed out. Hex:Ruin is the most meta defining perk for killers. If you're playing serious and want to get up ni ranks, you basically have only 3 perk slots as a killer, Ruin is a must.
---
Here the dead by daylight forum with the Nea outfit I used for reference. [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/58939/neon-nea](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/58939/neon-nea)
---
Ahh they shouldve called it thinskin or something....exposed made me feel like i can be seen from anywhere
---
He really is one of the best DbD streamers. It sucks to see him struggle with his mental and physical health recently
---
I agree that seems odd. I run tenacity + unbreakable, it pays off at least 1 in every 3 games. 
---
If two survivors are dead and it's just me and one other, it pays off 90% of the time.
---
Lots of slugging, which works great for my build
---
You're gonna have to explain because I'm lost. The 1 balance change I made didn't effect 1v1's.
---
Ash had two outfits and Ghostface had three (if you include the two recolours) - I'd be really surprised if Netflix only gave BHVR one cosmetic for each character. Expecting at *least* two; preferably more. (Maybe one skin of every rarity. Maybe even some brown tier recolours if we're lucky!)
---
To escape and also have fun while doing it
---
I'm gonna run PGTW, Ruin, Surge and Franklin's Demise on Pig after chapter release, because gen rush is op √† red ranks
---
Stop trying to play her like she's a normal killer, the amount of people I see trying to pallet loop a fucking spirit is ridiculous
---
doing gens, you?
---
Thanks for the feedback. I have to keep working on getting better with facial features.
---
Oh, wow. Didn‚Äôt know this was a thing.
---
This is the top post of all time? This?
---
Wtf?
---
I've never faced a Meyers like that, I wish people did that more
---
Yes. I‚Äôm one of his mods and he‚Äôs awesome to work with. So hard to see him get stressed!
---
WHAT THE FUCK?
---
&gt;I agree that something should be changed to give survivors a fairer chance to escape if the hatch is closed by the killer. Otherwise, I dislike your suggestions because they either compromise the functionality of the EGC or are functionally useless.
---
They just need to find a way to prevent exit gates from spawning extremely close to each other. Like when you are playing on [Azarov's Resting Place](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Azarov%27s_Resting_Place) or [Suffocation Pit](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Suffocation_Pit) and both gates spawn on the same side.
---
As a survivor when the hatch is closed and the gates are right next to each other I just accept my fate and urban evade around the map cleansing totems (gives lightbringer poitns) and earning some time alive (silver unbroken).
---
When: you  
---
Don't know:  
---
How to ....Format
---
If the killer has no way to trigger the EGC timer, there's nothing to stop survivors from taking the game hostage.
---
All the perks while many of them probaly wont be the whole meta anytime soon (maybe Inner Strength), nearly all of them will be useful and helpful, and stuff the fanbase have been requesting for a while. Compared to more recent perks such as Dark Devotion, Buckle Up, Autodidact etc, most of the perks that were shown do have more of a use and would be a lot more fun to play as/ against. 
---
I feel inner strength may change some of the meta as well, with more locker builds with head on, inner strength and quick and quiet being used more often, meaning killer perks would probaly more likely use Stridor and Iron Maiden, or just change a lot of the gameplay in general for now.
---
I had that happen to me a few times. 
---
I always blamed myself.
---
Just D.C
---
Well with the hitboxes the killer can be 5 feet away from the pallet and still be stunned even if you‚Äôre downed.
---
It depends on what you mean by "play for fun".  
---
I like to try niche perks sometime instead of the meta simply because they're not always expected. I love doing a plunderer's build often for fun because while it doesn't guarantee a win, I feel like Santa running around and passing out items.
---
*laughs* "A Hillbilly only roars when he's angry."
---
I do a bit of both. But I prefer matches were I dont have the extra stress of needing to win.like for rituals that you need to escape to get it.
---
Ok thanks, how long will it take to get used to it?
---
Sexy time has begun
---
I use non meta perks because I don‚Äôt like to copy others second I like to experiment with other perks. I play for fun and escaping the more epic the escape the more o have.
---
I‚Äôm a killer main, barely ever play survivor, so i went into one of my first survivor matches the other day as a rank 20 baby dweet hoping the killer would take pity on me and i went against the coolest spirit i‚Äôve ever seen. They let us all think we were going to die, even hooked one of us and kept downing us and then at the end my teammates opened the exit gate, killer dropped me by hatch but they didn‚Äôt leave, so killer carried me to the other gate which was closer, let me wriggle out and open it and let us ALL escape, which was really cool of them. Most wholesome moment i‚Äôve had playing this game so far: they gave us the win but they made us feel under pressure the whole time, so it didn‚Äôt feel like a free win. I doubt i‚Äôll ever find a match like that again haha.
---
I feel like secret offerings attract more DCs because people are afraid of ebony moris. I run Shroud of Separation sometimes even though it's objectively bad and I hit a loading screen DC over 50% of the time because people fear the mori.
---
When you find a SNES the Basement
---
That‚Äôd honestly would be hilarious I don‚Äôt know how well it would work but I could imagine going to hide in a locker and having a pennywise pop out
---
He scares me everytime I turn the game on cause its loud as fuck
---
I use perks to practice Chase and sabo hook safe. I love to be the guy that did everything he could to get everyone else out. Even if it means im dead.
---
You just have to learn to shake it off, water off a duck's back. This game is far from competitive, and you just have to find a way to play this game to have fun, not to win all the time.
---
When I get upset, my favourite thing to do is play my own game. Can I get all four survivors T3 madness at once with doctor? Can I get all 4 survivors injured at once with Wraith? Even just running a killer without a single perk can be fun. Same goes with survivor - playing with randomized perks, or simply running No Mither loadouts, can be a heck of a lot of fun
---
&gt;You are convinced that the End Game Collapse is fine (Which I mostly agree with) but you're completely avoiding the main reason I came up with this idea (The 99% issue) and at the same time completely dismissing my other (Non-balance) ideas for no reason.
---
&gt;I get what you are saying, but I don't agree with you, and instead of trying to strengthen you argument, you just "give up". Sound like you're just saying I'm right TBH.
---
I am convinced EGC serves its only and main purpose, allows the killer to force an match to end instead of being held hostage because someone is urban evading around and refusing to leave. Anything past this point is just killers wanting more easier ways to get undeserved kills.
---
So you're saying that using meta perks isn't "fun" ? 
---
I have a lot of fun DS'ing killers that try to tunnel me, or getting use out of adrenaline while getting chased.
---
But I guess running meta perks means you're not having fun ! Thanks for clearing that up for me, next time I'll start using deja vu and dark sense :)
---
It‚Äôs top tier ASMR
---
I found the triple blink+grab for the nurse the hardest one. 
---
But I did that one when I played with 3friends.
---
Newish player here, I love stealth games and would love to play as a stealthy killer. But I feel like Wraith is really underwhelming and have been told Pig has had huge nerfs in the past couple months. Is Ghostface a good stealthy killer? I would love to throw a new killer into rotation. I currently main Spirit, LF, and am practicing with Huntress.
---
This community is one or the worst I've been part of. Had to turn off my messages because I never got so many mean-spirited messages in gaming career before this game.
---
However, I think the game is also partially to blame. Between bugs, long lobby times, no dedicated servers yet so on console the lag works in conjunction with the shitty frames. OP killers and annoying add-ons on both sides and teammates having about 100 ways to throw in this game if they don't DC.
---
I have been playing for only a few months but this game is already taking its toll on me. Dead by Daylight is the only game where ranking up exponentially decreases the enjoyment you get out of the game and honestly it's not even that hard to do. I could be probably be in the red ranks if I ran meta perks all the time and glued myself to gens. Killer is even easier since you just need a killer like Freddy who can spam points and get a bunch of hits and pip regardless of actual kills.
---
So yeah, the community isn't that great but this game isn't exactly doing its best to encourage people to be wholesome.
---
Jump up and punch it duh lol
---
Oh you're talking about the "remove Kills opening Exit Gate part". 
---
I change it  because if the End Game Collapse triggered upon the 5th generator being powered and The Hatch being closed by the Killer, than the Killer opening Exit Gate mechanic would be useless.
---
Why would you open an Exit Gate during the End Game Collapse?
---
This is wrong.
---
The only original survivors who died before taken were Adam and Jane.  The rest were still alive when they got taken away by the entity.
---
It replaces the addon slots with slots where you can add additional offerings. \*Farming intensifies\*
---
This one survivor was playing really bad and had no idea how to loop and was dropping pallets like crazy. I killed her team and gave her hatch and i found out it was her first game and felt pretty happy giving her hatch. Her swf were happy too lol
---
It would be hard to remove one from a ceiling, but it sounds hella fun, i want it
---
uh
---
I play for the BP my dude
---
Yeah, I would have named it something like marked cause of the saying ‚Äúmarked for death‚Äù.
---
Well if you're wasting time saboing instead of doing gens then you're definitely not doing everything you can to help your team escape.
---
I'm a survivor main and I'm here to say you bring justice to our ppl.

You know the rules, this is going to be deleted.

---
1. I said play stronger killers, your twisting my words. 
---
2. You clearly did not read my reply at all. I said that survivors on separate gens **isnt** common. You also say that survivors being on different gens does nothing, when it does. When survivors are on the same gen it makes it easier for the killer to snowball and is slower and less efficient than working on 3 separate gens. I‚Äôm saying that your making a near perfect situation favored towards survivor because you are. Again I‚Äôll say it, survivors more often than not don‚Äôt work on 3 separate gens.
---
3. If you see any DBD content/videos you will notice that ruin does indeed slow generator progression. The majority of survivors hit regular skill checks more often than great skill checks. Almost the whole dead by daylight community agrees that ruin is one of the best perks in the game (for killers obviously), and it‚Äôs for a reason. Because it slow gen progression. I say this again too, not all survivors bring a toolbox or even any item.
---
4. Hooking, downing and looking for survivors (not in a chase) is literally half the job of a killer I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. But if you really insist on having perks that help stop gen progression while your chasing a survivor... Discordance, Surveillance, Corrupt Intervention, Huntress Lullaby and thrilling tremors are a few I can think of.
---
You clearly haven‚Äôt played survivor. You are making this argument so heavily biased. Ruin will slow the game down until the survivors finally find it. Ruin is arguably one of the strongest perks in the game for a reason. Survivors all don‚Äôt have toolboxes and can‚Äôt all hit great skill checks every time. You make your argument as if killers don‚Äôt have any perks or powers. Also I just want to know what type of killers you‚Äôre playing because stronger killers can be played on most maps.
---
So the other possible date is the 29th yeh?
---
Why not?
---
nice
---
Well, no. The Clown doesn‚Äôt eat human flesh. He just collects the fingers.
---
Holy shit, I think I've seen some of your youtube videos! Thank you for responding. Yeah, I don't mind killers with steep learning curves, I spent weeks being a truly awful Spirit lol. Are there any particularly good builds or should I run the usual Hex: Run, BBQ, ect.? I like "Scream" a lot too so I just kinda wanted to make sure I wasn't wasting my money. Thanks again!
---
That's true. It's a tough call, I fell in rank because I've been hard-lining survivors lately, so I don't want to go too hard on new players, but I also don't want to make them think it's will always be that easy.
---
Oh my...

THE BING BONG BOI
---
Wow and you had 350 upvotes.. that‚Äôs sucks man
---
Some people says that it might be your resolution not being 100% of the screen, i never experienced this bug so i can't confirm
---
Iron Maiden‚Äôs exposed effect is so short that even if you are close by when they scream you wont catch up to them in time before it wears off.
---
I agree. The block addons and the common kid drawing addon are so useless and not worth using.

May I introduce you to Calm Spirit :P

Do you have a link or something so I can at least drop an upvote?
---
-It takes 1 million blood points to get a character from 1 to about 37 depending on how you spend, the cost of things you buy, and how much you let the entity take. So a small jump after that to get to 40, maybe 1 million 100 thousand. 
---
-You won't give the killer a noise notification if you walk or crouch threw a window, the only way is if you do a running vault. You can also negate the running vault noise notification if you have the perk *quick and quiet*
---
-- Side note on running vaults. There's a medium running vault and a fast running vault, the medium one is significantly slower than the fast one and you can tell if you do the fast one cuz both of your survivors' legs will go through the window at the same time, while the medium one they'll step through it. 
---
-Yes, if you lose the chase intentionally or accidentally you gain a token. Not a wonderful perk though, fair warning, as almost anything you do depletes a stack and ONLY losing your OBSESSION gains a stack!
---
Hope it helps!
---
*click click*
---
Yea. Thanks for this explanation fellow redditor!
---
Sorry but this is 2019 not 2017 for DBD.
---
Looping has been made harder by removing the vacuum and reducing the number of pallets on maps. While some loops have been closed off!(Only open when the RNG sees fit) Making some places like the groaning storehouse death traps for survivors. You can act like it is still equal when its only a survivors tools being nerfed in chases.
---
Never mind the "loop rework" the devs are thinking about implementing.
---
*Please try again*
---
Hell yeah. I for one am trying to get better at Nurse, and I can‚Äôt do that if I‚Äôm not being challenged. I don‚Äôt want your petty quitters‚Äô bonuses, people. I want to win fair.
---
I always use Deerstalker because I normally play while extremely drunk and sometimes I forget to people up

I bought the Owl skin for the Huntress after playing one game as her. IDGAF if I'm not a good killer, I look cool and that's all I care about.

Vulnerable or Marked would've been better names yeah.

Most people think she‚Äôs like 14 or so because of the school girl cosmetics, but her lore points to her being far older than that. Her cosmetics are just weird in general because her base is mostly naked with bandages then she‚Äôs got school girl uniforms and elegant kimonos? But I‚Äôm also pretty sure the devs wouldn‚Äôt put a half naked 14 year old who murders people in game.
---
True, but people who DC tend not to listen either way. At least this way, we get some sort of reaction.
---
I'm still waiting for my new nea outfit....
---
They always release DLC after a bloodhunt
---
See, that‚Äôs a fair reason to DC. Corn blindness is real.
---
Killers, this is why you should attack the t-baggers instead of waiting in some remote corner for them to leave. There‚Äôs a lot of these morons that you can steal a kill off of.
---
Anyone else remember when this perk actually increased the odds of escaping from the hook?
---
Pepperridge Farm remembers
---
StreamDad is my favorite
---
I think end game needs some tweaking but not this much. They just need better door rng and in my opinion better hatch mechanics as it should be who sees it first wins but that‚Äôs not the case right now
---
fun above all else, escaping is an after thought
---
Not everyone... More then 70% of the playerbase has to wait :(

I like BoxGhost. She's a bit of a smaller streamer but it's comfy viewing.

Just because you aren‚Äôt having fun, doesn‚Äôt mean you get to screw your teammates over like that. The best course of action from a logistical point is to fight back harder than normal. That way, you can force them to understand that their toxic builds won‚Äôt work. DCing is exactly what they want. You‚Äôre feeding them.

Smoochie time!

BHVR isn't better. Far from it. They are mostly incompetent really
---
Hey how did you get your thing to say Borrowed Time?
---
Same here. But instead of taking my lumps, I would end up getting a miraculous turnaround and end up getting all 4. Let failure motivate you, friend.
---
You can only juke killers for so long.  You might have seen way too many 360¬∞ montages on youtube.
---
Also I am glad you are positive about being tunneled but many others dont see it that way. We all have had far too many games where as a survivor have gotten less than 5k of bloodpoints. Or even open a single chest or cleanse a totem.! Survivors should be able to have fun too.
---
Just run iron will 4head
---
Its not the worst perk lol
---
Good job. They look phenomenal!
---
I have a BLAST versing Nurse, it's so much fun. 
---
I have no fun playing against spirit...
---
LIES.
---
get better and draw the Games out to get more pips
---
Context: Rank 15 Level 1 Myers is the blue one, after getting 0 kills and 1 DC.
---
Shhh, don't disturb the people who think they've found the new hot OP counter.
---
Got it.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure memento mori are wooden carvings of severed heads, Hesse why they‚Äôre titled with different types of wood.
---
I barely play killer and I don't think I'll need ruin so i think  I might skip over it and go for prove thyself or diversion
---
You need to pay attention to your emblems and improve your performance accordingly.
---
Archives is just a battle pass thing. Halloween event probably coming back
---
Yeah the game is so immersive that the entity has corrupted even the community
---
She was extremely bullyable when you could hear phasing at pallets and the directional phasing noise made her Wraith tier.
---
sure, if you have Prove Thyself
---
Rolf
---
IMO If you dont plan on playing killer EVER, dont bother getting killer perks
---
That sounds like a good way. Thanks.
---
Best guess is it's one of the skins. Past licensed characters had more than one set, and they can really milk this.
---
Leave billy boy alone :(
---
Relatable
---
When you get Evil within lll and catch 2 people in the basement
---
Thank you so much!
---
From a killer main to you, thank you for the brilliant idea.
---
I agree that spirit is stronger, since shutting down loops entirely is just so valuable but I disagree about spirit having a higher skill ceiling than billy.  I think billy has a pretty low floor, where anyone can chainsaw around the map for mobility and then play like a m1 killer(maybe landing some really easy chainsaws in the open), but also I think he has one of the highest skill ceilings in the game.  The hardest curve saws to land are already more mechanically challenging than perhaps any other killer, but also knowing exactly when and where to use it takes a lot of practice and patience.  Billy as a killer could theoretically be landing way more saws than most players get, even on many loops (particularly the short loops like on the middle of blood lodge), unless the survivors flip the pallets really early.  To get the best value possible out of billy is very difficult.
---
Spirit is harder to pick up and play at first than billy, but it's not exactly a skillful outplay/mindgame when the survivor doesn't have options to avoid getting hit.  The spirit very rarely has to actually guess where the survivor is, but the survivor almost exclusively has to guess.  It makes her more effective, and she's not particularly easy to use but I think a lot of being good at spirit is general game knowledge that's not unique to playing spirit.
---
Imagine thinking that waiting at a jungle gym is a mindgame lmao
---
The way survivors fall in general makes me say "ouch" lmao
---
Face first on the concrete with broken ankles? Sorry Ms. Denson
---
Pro tip. Survivors can't escape if there's no generators
---
this wouldn‚Äôt have worked on most killers unless they had noed
---
Right! I know it‚Äôs public, I know it‚Äôs a test.. just call it a beta!!!
---
It works sometimes but when there aren't enough players on, it's gonna pair up pretty much everyone. And it seems to see 3 level 5s and 1 level 20 survivors as a fair match to a level 12 killer because of the average which is crap.
---
‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ summon the ptb ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§
---
I think both perks have its value. Urban Evasion can be better if you consider the crouched aspect of it, which makes it easier to hide from killers using short objects. 
---
Fixated will be better to escape killers mid chase by walking around high walls that are featured on Jungle Gyms, for example.
---
I agree completely. Urban Evasion is nice in that you can hide behind things, but it only makes you move as fast as a regular walk. Fixated makes that regular walk even faster, meaning you can even use it during a chase to throw off killer (coupled with the ability to see scratch marks). Also given the fact that a lot of scenery is tall enough that you can hide behind it while standing, I see Fixated as ABSOLUTELY being a better UE
---
What horror game won't have a Halloween event. Better give us something
---
Agreed, it sounds like a good counter for the Spirit
---
Survivors t-bag while injured too
---
In the current meta if the game this perk is useless, deliverance is a significantly better escape hook method. Slippery meat is another game of luck which most survivors won‚Äôt take. In other words get good if you can‚Äôt catch someone again after being unhooked
---
Have fun an take it easy. The community is more toxic than a nuclear power plant melt down, so you're gonna have a lot of games with bastards, but be aware, keep out of chases, and you'll hit rank 1 before you know it and then promptly want to be rank 10 again.
---
Gates powered but not enough objective points? Do one of the other two gens.
---
Well, I never used UE because I have an aggressive playstyle, but fixated seems like something I could work with.
---
I recommend you go for ruin. Basically a limited time only item, unless of course you have hag and have her leveled up. Spirit could always be bought, and if you like playing killer, ruin is an essential perk regardless of your ability. Also its only 2000, you could definitely get back up to 9000 in no time.
---
what cunts
---
Tbh I dont think they're hard to survive as much as annoying to survive against.
---
Just walk, Jesus Christ...
---
Given how meta spirit is I imagine it will be used more. It will also encourage staying healed, which is something survivors take for granted (hag, nurse, spirit, freddy should always be healed)
---
Ranking up in some ways makes the game less fun. I think once I get to rank 1 with killer and maybe with survivor, I'm gonna just focus on niche builds and prestiging.
---
Hold b for like 2 sec
---
I honestly think it‚Äôs mostly Freddy. I have hit a lot of people threw pallets. And with the others I use (Michael and Amanda) I don‚Äôt get those kinds of hits
---
Killers can hide their red stain and make survivors hesitate. They either make the read, or take a hit. That‚Äôs the mindgame.
---
Matchmaking Saw your self care so thought you were a rank 20
---
Oh no! I‚Äôm sorry that bullying carries over to this game as well :c
---
Try using ruin and bbq ruins in the shrine right now
---
Dammit, i wish i was this creative! Great job OP.
---
No. Exposed means that if you're hit, down you go, even if you weren't injured.
---
Double pallets in jungle gyms...
---
Thank you so much for this info!! I will definitely take note of this!
---
hows that gay? lol
---
No fire?
---
Too bad it gets cleansed within 20 seconds.
---
I don‚Äôt trust baby Clauds.
---
I want this.
---
Well, thanks to your heads up I can perhaps prepare myself better haha xD
---
Nancy's outfit: 8/10, really solid choice and a very nice ensemble
---
Demogorgon: 6/10 a bit underwhelming and basic but fits a good niche, I wouldn't bag you at all for thinking a shackled beast from another dimension looks cool
---
Steve: 999999999999999/10 ITS A MASTERPIECE
---
The bing bong boy as it were.
---
It's just lewd lol
---
Same I have never seen anybody use that I even  forgot that was a thing
---
I have a friend who will sit at the gate and teabag until the EGC almost gets him and he has gotten his karma a couple times and it‚Äôs always so funny and well-deserved when it happens. But I‚Äôll never forget the P3 Claudette that my bf risked his life to save, after she did nothing all game, and she sat in the middle of the damn gate to teabag and he got her ass. Me and my bf died laughing at her.
---
That's the thing.
---
If I'm playing a bad killer, like Wraith, I'm gonna take whatever is meta and best on him because I need all the help I can get.
---
If I'm playing something like Nurse, Spirit, or Hillbilly, I'll take fuckin Deerstalker for all i care
---
I want a picture of just pixel wraith please
---
Did you read my flair? I grew up. Being toxic is rude. I‚Äôd rather use diversion and throw it at my teammates
---
Honestly I'd expect this PTB to come out a lot later than the other ones. Not only are we getting 2 Survivors with very unique perks (Second Wind, Fixated, and Inner Strength all have new mechanics that don't already exist. It's not like Jane who only had Head On as a new mechanic) but we're also getting 2 new debuffs ("Unaware" and "Undetectable") and a new bloodweb system. Basically when compared to the Ghostface PTB there's a ton of content so I wouldn't be surprised if we had to wait a bit.
---
r/DBDgonewild
---
Wraith, Trapper, Clown, Legion, Ghostface in that order
---
I play for both. I'm usually red ranks, so some meta perks are required for me as a solo survivor. My favorite non meta perk build is quick &amp; quiet, head on, dance with me, and iron will. This build is so fun to me, but I find that when I don't use meta perks like DS or Adrenaline, I'm so fucked because I'll get tunneled (DS would have helped) or I'll be chased when all the gens are completed and not fully recover with adrenaline. Etc.
---
Once it is down to one survivor, they should be able to parry killer attacks, and have melee attacks, and fatalities, and a fucking gun.
---
actually I prefer this honest toxicity over the annoying Community of r/warframe 
---
Thats by far the worst/dev sucking Community I've ever seen.
---
semantics and you know it lol
---
Is that more suited ?
---
dO bOnEs 1!1!1!1!1

Made for a friend.
---
Any cosmetic that isn't on this chart is one that no one wears. :)
---
I don‚Äôt get it when people say they have to buy the hag, I got her for free when I got the game
---
Tru3 brought me back after quitting the game when i was starting out. His explanation and attitude towards the game is great
---
that makes no sense
---
except that new players dont have 2-4k shards. checkmate, dingus
---
You feel a draft?
---
Billy is about as strong as I ever want a killer to be in this game. I'm not denying he has some nutty add-ons, but he still follows the rule of chases like other killers. 
---
It can be a hard match, sometimes a quick one. But hearing Billy doesn't suck the hope out me like hearing Spirit or Nurse (which is rare on PS4). Those killers need to be deleted or nerfed to the ground and no killer should be stronger than Billy imo.
---
Thank you so much for all of this info!! I am considering starting out with one of the killers you‚Äôve suggested, like Wraith! And yes I will also try out the survivors too! Any recommendations on who‚Äôs the best option to start off with?? Thank you again!
---
Come on wheres the doctor?
---
Its 3 meters in tier one
---
I don't like self cleaning totems üòÇ
---
For real

Haha now I have a feeling I‚Äôll grow a thicker skin thanks to this game, too!! Thanks for the heads up :)

Nice perk that does nothing xD

Unless it's haunted grounds, then it never doss
---
Awesome shrine with solid perks across the board. PwYF is awesome on Wraith. Get it.
---
The worst is 2 useless teachables spawning that you don't want poisoning the other bloodwebs.
---
Fucking sick
---
ruin and Prove Thyself are easily Top Perks for Survivor and killers
---
I'd hate to argue with someone obviously talking with their head in their ass. But why are you complaining? Do you understand that they make these dlc's to make money? They make money and improve the game? Dedicated servers/ bug fixes/ balancing/ map tile changes. You literally have a dev team that supports this game monthly fixing and improving the game. So uh.... please stop being an ass clown and just be happy for the new content coming out?
---
I figured with a massive community like this that there‚Äôll be a huge toxic bunch, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll have a blast nonetheless :) thank you for the tidbit I really appreciate it!!
---
First BBQ and Distortion, now Ruin and Prove Thyself. I See what you did there
---
tbh I just want an offline mode, bots would be fine. Something so I can play when my internet goes out.

The original Brand New Part.
---
*shudders*
---
Oh make your choice would go well with BBQ. I think that is what I‚Äôll run. Haunted devour make your choice and BBQ sounds like it would work well. I feel like most people see a spirt and no ruin and just forget about hex totems all together until they get instant clapped by devour lol
---
Yea I‚Äôm on ps4, in fact I never bought dead by daylight it was free on ps plus games of the month. I do main her at the moment and play her a lot so I‚Äôm not sure if I should just grind for the hex ruin (and possibly devour hope) cuz getting 2500 shards is going to take a while and I‚Äôve been trying to get spirit for a while now
---
Imo Monto, Hybridpanda and Noob3
---
Not at the corner of a jungle gym lol, that's why they're so good. You can see the killer from either angle
---
And how about maps that have half the loops where you can easily see the killer? Waist high loops are only good for one killer, and you can still duck her.
---
Then there's Lampkin Lane, with actually zero mindgame loops.
---
A killer mindgaming a loop is a luxury not a given, and good survivors route away from unsafe loops. Killer counters typically bs loops when survivors change nothing about their gameplay.
---
Don't hug walls to avoid collision, dont wait at at pallets, drop pallets behind you, double vault windows, etc.
---
If there's any doubt that the Shrine is random then this disproves that theory. I mean come on, BBQ and Corrupt Intervention (a great and slightly underrated gen slowdown perk) and then Ruin the week after?
---
You want to kill one of the three killers that are viable and next you go to ask why everibody play nurse and hillbilly
---
Of the the top 3 tier killers. He and Spirit annoy me more than Nurse. I kinda respect people who can get get seriously good at Nurse. Spirit is mostly just having ears and Billy is extremely easy to pick up with the only difficult thing being using the chainsaw to turn in a loop, etc.
---
I also have a problem with Billy, because a character concept he's kinda of stupid. A chainsaw that causes someone to jetson across the map at top speeds?  Not exactly logically compared to all other killer concepts that sort of make sense.
---
Hillbilly is definitely on my top list!! Thank you for the advice :D
---
Thank you for doing God‚Äôs work here
---
its still a really good perk
---
As a new killer (just started yesterday) the teabagging learned from other games is usually a taunt. I can‚Äôt really differentiate between what‚Äôs a ‚Äúhayyy gg squat squat‚Äù between a ‚Äúlmao succ ittt squat squat‚Äù. Mind always goes to the latter though sometimes it is funny.
---
I‚Äôll keep that in mind though
---
Fixated will be useful during the beginning and moddle of a chase, but once you‚Äôre injured it doesn‚Äôt work, and while an injured UE user would still leave blood pools, cries are substantially quieter while crouched and blood can be difficult to track in tall grass or on swampy surfaces, making UE a much better tool (when combined with something like Dance With Me or Lithe) for breaking away from a chase after the halfway point.  I think it‚Äôll still have a purpose.
---
Nah 2 weeks is way too late, as then the live will go out another 2 weeks later. They cant release the chapter like a month and a half after release. Itll be in the next few days
---
1. Probably can‚Äôt get the right to it due to money or licensing issues
---
2. It doesn‚Äôt share the same intensity as a regular chase theme. The Shape Stalks is an excellent example of a licensed chase theme since it shares the same tension of being chased by, say, a cannibal with a chainsaw or a nurse who teleports through time and space.
---
If you've been playing her for a while might as well go for spirit then, you'll probably get to the teachable level quicker.
---
No matter how fast you scroll
---
You can never get away from this repost
---
Many thanks! Ever been to space mountain?
---
They'd never add an offline mode or a bot practice mode because it would create a convenient environment for cheat makers
---
Once again, that is steam's fault for their patching method. Games have to work around it to speed up patch times
---
Oo good points! I always thought Nurse looked tough to play! Thank you for the advice, I will definitely consider all of this! Especially Leatherface :D
---
Attacks have a CD
---
A man is not truly No one until he cares about the bloodweb of others.
---
Im newer and second on my list of killers to buy is MM, love his character and really want to play him in game
---
so fitting
---
Thank you so much for the welcome! :) I‚Äôm so excited to finally play! I‚Äôll make sure to post about my first experiences :D
---
Right?! **P E B B L E !**
---
Ooof you are arguing with everyone about this, second comment on this bullshit. If you have played this game for a while you'd know that cosmetics has been something the community wanted for the longest time. It supports their game. You're clearly a spoiled child kicking and screaming about COSMETICS, they have a complete different team to design cosmetics and a complete different team to code and fix bugs.
---
Did this earlier, hatchet went through Meg, got bm'd after the game.
---
My pleasure
---
To me, it seems like she goes for what you're going for. Either way, mind gaming the entity is underrated üòé
---
No hook respawn...
---
Yeah, fuck Legion!
---
Perk is the first thing you buy. Always.
---
Seriously, prepare yourself. 
---
What are you planning on maiming btw? Killer or survivor?
---
you husband now
---
"Man I love when people dedicate themselves to the character. Wait, why is the halloween theme playing?"
---
how come there's no ambient music on console? I've noticed it in a few clips. it's dead silent (music wise) until you pick up the survivor
---
Fengs looking fat today
---
Hag is definitely worth it. Fun to play. Good perks too.

I‚Äôd suggest keeping an eye out for the hatch from the start of the game. The hatch also loves to spawn in the killer shack so I‚Äôd suggest looking there first. The hatch also likes to spawn near generators and within the central building of the map. 
---
To help yourself remember potential hatch spawns, maybe you could equip a map with a special add on to track the hatch?
---
Praised be! The entity has blessed up with P E B B L E
---
Sometimes I just stop what I'm doing and just slowly look at them as they're going up to the entity and think "enjoy the meal, entity"
---
If you have Hag as you say, then if you're not too far off from unlocking Ruin with BP then of course just save up for spirit.
---
Ty! :)
---
Thanks! :D
---
It‚Äôs like Noed on billy with speed limiter. They think you‚Äôre farming then BLAMO party in the basement
---
I‚Äôll definitely remember this!! And oof I‚Äôll have to get the map tool first it hasn‚Äôt been offered in a bloodweb yet :/ But thank you for letting me know that‚Äôs a thing!
---
I played her a lot on console before clown and spirit came out after I went to pc I only bought spirit as she was my favorite. But hags perks are really strong for sure.
---
This along with "every good survivor perk is OP"
---
Thanks for going out there and showing people DBD. We need more people on the bandwagon.
---
Agree.  I don't think there's any reason to expect that won't be there, too.  Pretty sure that's the outfit in the Inner Strength icon.  I assume they just wanted to show off their Season 3 looks, which are new and very different.
---
I actually heard this, spooked me a bit
---
You're very right, it is fun to go up against killers you can't mindlessly loop.
---
Hag, Freddy, Huntress, Billy (even ghostface on some loops).
---
It isn't fun to go up against a killer you have to play a guessing game against.
---
People do not hate spirit and nurse because they cannot be looped, they hate them because:
---
Nurse fundamentally breaks the game.
---
Spirit is a weighted guessing game.
---
I'd say the PTB has to start this week sometime to avoid the DLC postponing
---
Make sure youre hooking everyone 3 times, stay away from the hooked survivor, and keep as many gens incomplete as possible.
---
Survivor lag would be dependent on your connection directly to BhVR's servers instead of your connection to the killer who potentially has bad internet for one. On killer side things would probably feel a lot more consistent, less survivors suddenly jumping if they have a bad connection. It would also let the devs keep better track of people who frequently dc.
---
Correction: the hatch DOES NOT SPAWN AT BEGINNING OF MATCH. There is a rule that it only appears when the number of gens completed is lower than number of current survivors +1 ..
---
wut
---
It's the exact opposite for me.
---
As an australian huntress main, I dread dedicated servers.
---
The shirt says ‚ÄúF U Crew‚Äù what did you expect?
---
you are entering the entity's realm now
---
A*
---
It looks to me like it's the letter 'K'
---
Wear headphones and really listen. You don‚Äôt have to check every corner of the map just the general areas using your eyes and ears.
---
And this year, people recognized the character. Happy to see the game getting more popular. Especially with the stranger things dlc on the way.
---
Yeah, they need to add safe unhooks to MoM. It's fricken horrible right now, you should be able to get ticks like WGLF.
---
How long have you been playing?  I initially thought I wouldn't play survivor, but I do quite a bit now.  If you have enough iri shards, Id 100% get it, assuming the others dont interest you
---
LITERALLY STARTED PLAYING DETROIT TODAY AND OH MY GURDDDD IM SHOOK
---
There's three things I consider my mood if you deserve it and if someone DC'd immediately
---
She‚Äôs letting everyone bled out, why would I waste 3 minutes so she finish her power trip
---
I really hope so, But archives is likely late October mid season when i was watching the anniversary event they said you unlock things like the bloodweb but need to also play in order to unlock certain items.
---
Removed someone already posted this
---
Kinda hard to hook every survivor 3 times when so many of them kill themselves.
---
What happens if you vault a window against trapper and get trapped? What happens if freddy chases you into a blood pallet? What happens if clown catches you at a loop where you can't complete due to the gas? What happens when a wraith uncloaks ans you're out in the open? What happens if Meyers T3s in a chase right behind you?
---
Sometimes you'll be in a bad position and the killer is guaranteed a hit/down. That's true with all killers.
---
Half of the "counters" in this game is poor map design in favor of survivors, hello palletwrecker haven and Thompsons house. I know this guide is useful because I play against survivors that do it. Just like you don't run to hooks against hags you don't hug walls against spirit. If a hag places a trap next to a pallet do you loop that pallet? Hag op pls nerf
---
Ye I meant in this example
---
also I assume most aren‚Äôt idiots and stand on the edge so they get knocked into the escape zone lol
---
There‚Äôs always been hits on head on survivors. It‚Äôs just a risk that comes with the perk.
---
Ah icic, thank you! That's a fun fact I learned today.
---
Say it again for the people in the back. Even Michael can't be mindlessly looped. Plague can cut chases so short with her power, especially with add-ons. No capable survivor is asking for killers to be eat pallets all day like a 20 Leatheface but the amount of rules Nurse and Spirit break is crazy.
---
Solid.
---
I feel there is a psychological factor, and some ignore it. Half of the game is mind games.
---
This game is the sole reason I had to finally shift my Steam profile to private. More than a decade of playing various games and this one is the biggest hive of salty mother fuckers.
---
People even started commenting on random screenshots when I first turned off comments. So now I just keep changing my name regularly and hope for the best.
---
I didn‚Äôt read the whole thing but I REALLY like the Pig and Plague ideas. Also the phonecall thing with ghostface is really cool.
---
Removed we ask you take part of the sub first thank you
---
Probably because I reminded them that the PTB wasn't today *cries*
---
&lt;3
---
Don‚Äôt forget to bm after stuns
---
Yikes
---
I mainly play Freddy, and have limited Huntress Experience, but Freddy is easily more consistent than the Huntress because he doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúshit map‚Äù due to his teleport. He has addons that slow the game down on their own, and with BBQ and Pop Goes the Weasel it can make all the difference.
---
It‚Äôs a known bug as long as you don‚Äôt keep doing it your fine
---
That‚Äôs Awesome!
---
So just because we get 2 meta perks in a row, it's not random?  We were just as likely to get ruin this week as any other perk.
---
Baby assassin, ez
---
For my experience on PS4, this is me with survivor. As killer, I find one as soon as I hit search.
---
My guess is one with dangling vines and/or one with Christmas lights, a couple recolors maybe  based on cold, or nature or rot or burned.
---
Or The Trapper/Billy/Doc. All of them are fucking JACKED
---
there's no way to purposefully do it, and the bug has already been documented. youre most likely fine
---
Bing bong your opinion is wrong
---
Basement chest is the most dangerous chest in the game, would not suggest. Run plunderer's, and just grab an item and play the game like normal. That shroud is basically useless, especially against Billy who has some of the highest map mobility in the game
---
Jules is also presumably 17. I don‚Äôt think huntress is illegal. But her psychology renders her maturity levels at under 12 years old. Which is probably why people have a problem with it.
---
You deserve more upvotes.
---
Also Mr. MooseGoose, unless they burned a shroud, they're likely more to the side of you rather than directly across at the start.
---
Same here. I have 10 or 15 that I wish to get rid of or hold on for Ultra sweaty matches. Like if I know I'm going against 4 survive with friends buddies who are using instead heal or something. Or if I need an achievement.
---
I've legit seen survivors and Killers who have hundreds of them and honestly I'm either assuming inventory hacks or only playing a single character. Either way it's incredibly frustrating to go against. I don't think they belong in the game at all. Wards ruin the point of items and add-ons being rare. They completely eliminate any risk
---
That‚Äôs fair enough! I just usually do pretty good in 5 min., so that‚Äôs just my base #!
---
I do pretty bad with facing Spirit too. Much luck to you in your future matches! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Believe it or not people still bitch about SB, ignore the people chasing you worse case slug them that‚Äôs their fault in that point idc,balanced landing is currently the best in the game second is most likely lithe.But the issue with Dead hard is inconsistent and can be baited out easily look at monto.Again ignore the person on BT and go after the healthy one or just tunnel the injured down them and leave them.Again adrenaline isn‚Äôt that good of a reward especially with trading still being prevalent and it being a common thing to lose a health state especially against people like huntress

No that‚Äôs completely on me. I‚Äôm currently a wreck rn and I took it out on you so I apologize for that. I know you meant well just wasn‚Äôt smart enough to see. I am sorry.
---
Thank you soo much, all of this info is super helpful!! I‚Äôm definitely taking notes of this lol I‚Äôm very much considering playing either the Wraith or Hillbilly in my very first game, so I‚Äôll get to see how my skills turn out!! I‚Äôm also fairly interested in the Pig actually! How is she to play if I may ask?? But thank you so much again I really appreciate it! :D
---
Yeah this always bugged me too. They‚Äôre not mind games they‚Äôre 50/50s. Those don‚Äôt take skill they take luck. Either she‚Äôs phasing or she‚Äôs not and you have to make the right call off pure instinct.
---
It wasn't even the basement chest. And he passed by two of my teammates by mere pixels, *and* diverted course from the teammate working on gen just to hit my dumb ass.
---
I‚Äôm happy because I don‚Äôt level killers I go for survivor so now I have BBQ and now Ruin
---
It‚Äôs not the rules that make this very difficult. How will he take you to a hook? How will you flashlight blind him? How about certain things like Decisive Strike? What about damaging gens and breaking pallets? Grabs? So many things they have to work around because of his height.
---
From a console point of view, if a killer DC‚Äôs through the game, you keep BP. If they DC through closing application, you don‚Äôt keep it. On PC, I would imagine you don‚Äôt keep it if they disconnect from the internet entirely.
---
This is so sad. Alexa, play the Dead By Daylight Stranger Things theme.
---
Were you near a pallet or window? Did you get off the chest when you saw him coming?

Couldn't see him through the fog.

Holy shit, it‚Äôs fookin pebble.

but more importantly, did that hero of a david get out
---
Chainsaw is loud, terror radius is still a good warning unless he has Monitor and Abuse. Just gotta be more alert
---
Your Deliverance was already worthless in that scenario because you had nothing to protect yourself with after unhooking. She would have just smacked you and put you back on the hook again immediately.
---
I would love to practice killer without getting my ass handed to me in public matches.
---
Nea is the exception- If you‚Äôre Nea, you die.
---
It's funny how bad Iron Maiden actually is. You can have it go off a million times in a single match and it will still be a shit perk you almost will never actually capitalize on. It's only feasible use is just faster reloading for Huntress.
---
See these examples don't work because they pretty much rely on mistakes or powerful add-ons.
---
Unless you're really distracted or he's using good add-ons, Wraith isn't catching you in the open. Michael being 99 is part of his game plan and not only can be expected but can be countered either by denying sight or looping. If he gets off, it means he probably played well or survivors made too many mistakes.
---
Small Game can spot Hag and Trapper traps or half the time you can just see them plant them. Also, traps have the most power at loops and hooks so most survivors can expect. There's a consistency in those that Nurse and Spirit lacks, especially when add-ons come into play. 
---
Tell me exactly why Spirit has the vault "animation" she does? Nurse ignores loops and the worse the Nurse is the more you can work around her power by playing with LoS. But the better she gets, the counter play is basically non existent besides being totally immersed and dragging the game out to a standstill.
---
I would have just closed it personally lmao
---
Just ran into legion with dying light, thanotaphobia, franklins, and bbq. Never have I ever seen such a slow game
---
Im pretty crafty, I made mine and my boyfriend's corsage/boutttenier by hand and it cost me $10 and 3 hours of work. Also made the day of prom lol
---
I'd love to know how to make one
---
The problem was you rounded the corner too wide.  Try hugging the wall a bit more
---
Not a meme
---
In the Stranger Things Season 3 AR game there was a chained up demogorgon in a vault at the last section of the game. This cosmetic could be a reference to the game, although it might be a reference to something else.

A Wraith once let me survive just for how good my Dwight looked.
---
Nah, because you cant go down low and hide behind short things
---
*Cries in console*
---
I would firstly set your profile so that only friends can message you. I did this and I imagine many toxic players were upset they couldn't send me hate messages.
---
I'm not really arguing for the nurse.
---
Most of the killers in this game are garbage against good survivors. If we want to bring Spirit in line with, let's say Clown, then you might as well delete her from the game.
---
What suggestions would you make for her that 
---
1) Still make her viable against organized red ranked survivors (this means no bully counters like GF, trapper, or hag)?
---
2) make her feel fair for red ranked survivors?
---
Because currently we have a line; underwhelming killers that are extremely disadvantaged at red ranks, and Nurse/Spirit. Spirit I believe is closest to that line (apparently a little OP), freddy and hag are close but on the other side (a little UP)
---
Mathieu is hot
---
Stay awake and if you fall asleep you better remember which pallet is real or not
---
For once I‚Äôve got all of those perks

I mean you can still crouch, but you can move around faster without scratch marks standing up.
---
All I got to do is Adept Nurse and I'll be Platinum.
---
Pull it down. If he still punches you in the face, then it was fake.
---
I know this post is supposed to be a sarcastic mock of a nerf happy killer main but I still find it unfunny.
---
I can relate on a spiritual level
---
Why do people think trying to win is unfun? They arent separate...
---
If only more people realized thats exactly what mind games are. Getting into your enemy‚Äôs head and making them second guess what your plan is. All spirit does is add another layer to that. Guess we can see who the good and bad survivors are more clearly now with all these anti-spirit posts that have been running rampant lately.
---
There was a post earlier about it. Something about if u rotate your camera near one it should react to it or something along the lines.
---
I only t bag when I‚Äôm right next to the exit gate that way even if I‚Äôm hit it just pushed me into the exit gate lmao
---
I just don't know how to effectively use them
---
Lmfao. Calling _the key_ toxic now, are we? Killers are god damn babies, I stg.
---
Your post is contradictory. Spirit games are never "fun for both sides", only the killer has fun in those games.
---
Hint: hes making what is called a "joke" making fun of your use of self care, which the community has decided is a bad perk for some reason
---
Nice
---
Oh shit, thanks for reminding me; I need to derank so I can scare new players with Myers and Ghostface (not using stuff like Ruin, or Moris- I want to scare them in an ENJOYABLE way, not scare them away from the game).
---
Speak for yourself. I love playing against her.
---
To sum this up, less lag, more reliable connection, possibly faster matchmaking.
---
I have salty messages from him lmao.
---
Imma be real with you, it's not perfect, all it did was nerf end game builds into the ground with no real buff to the killers end game power
---
Noice
---
&gt;Imma be real with you, it's not perfect, all it did was nerf end game builds into the ground with no real buff to the killers end game power
---
How is that? And don't come with the whole "*RBT traps don't work anymore*", this is just ONE scenario and it was needed anyway.
---
For a few seconds I thought there was a caveman inside the map,turned out to just be Kate in the dress,RIP
---
Was the word toxic mentioned. I'm blind over here.
---
I think asymmetrical games where you can binge one side can cause you to look at the "other" side as bots instead of people, you think you're better than them.
---
If a killer hard camps and gets a 4K they deserve it. I‚Äôve never lost vs a camping killer because I just rush gens lmao
---
Sounds like it could be fun- I‚Äôm in.
---
no man. IRL She WILL hear your breath, and she'll catch it. The tier list is in game scares only and the nurse can surprise just once if she keeps her blinks for a first strike. after that she's just overwhelming if she's good with her blinks thats all.
---
I don‚Äôt get what ‚Äútoxic‚Äù things about his videos he doesn‚Äôt tea bag or bm the killer. I don‚Äôt know about you but I don‚Äôt consider pallet looping or flashlight or 360ing a toxic thing.
---
I think i heard someone say its the weekend the new chapter drops
---
That will be a godsend. Im mainly leveling killers rn but i still enjoy survivor from time to time but i dont have laury

Hag is nothing like the demagorgon

In my opinion the games saturation used to be a lot better.

A shitty video to match the shitty connection
---
I'm telling talk, it'll be the 10th, nobody believes me but you wait
---
Agree with all points on a game overhaul.
---
I think that no collision would be the most reasonable change, if you can hear her phase at pallets she would be trash at loops, but removing collision means that now standing counter-walking would be far less risky. I think that the no scratchmarks would a bit too harsh a learning curve for her. 
---
I'll never attempt to defend prayer beads, there's like no counter lol.
---
If they removed collision I think that would open up a lot more counter play that won't make her bullyable, so that satisfies my question. I'll bring this up in the inevitable Spirit mudfights that will take up our time until Stranger Things drops
---

There is a bot practice, it‚Äôs called rank 20 lol.
---
I think Loomis‚Äô line ‚ÄúHe got hungry‚Äù when looking at a dog carcass in the Myers house is a less than subtle hint that he ate a dog (though I have an alternate theory on what that line COULD also mean, but I‚Äôm pretty sure the intention was that he literally ate a dog).
---
you ever been hit with a "BlOoD wArDeN lAsTs ToO LoNg pLz NeRf" while they running the most meta perks and just sitting in the exit gates with their auras constantly being shown?
---
no? just me?
---
I joined the subreddit. Am I allowed to post any pallet stuns I inflict upon Michael within the subreddit? :D
---
I mean, that's like comparing dying from the pleuge to dying from a car crash
---
GF has a tactical knife MADE for slashing and stabbing while legion has his tiny razor thingy (bruh you can't call that little peepee a knife honsetly), plus his knife sheath and belt clip for more hidden weapons, his suit designed for stealth and he also has a camera which is pretty cool. He's kinda low tier here for what his gears actually are. Katana IRL are cheap weapons invented during a period of great war in Japan to waste less Metals. In fatc, they usually break once they severed 3 or 4 limbs. Hag is high cuz bitchslapping people with a deformed huge hand with sharp nails infected by all sorts of unknown diseases is rather powerful. Plus bitchslapping to death is original and cool. \^\^
---
Oh thank god this is a shitpost
---
I‚Äôll be honest, wholesome Nea players are very hard to come by.
---
They would
---
I see you're a fellow intellectual
---
Holy shit, you unironically don't know how to hide in locker/behind a gen for BBQ? I get having issues with NOED, but BBQ? It's not even that useful on killers without traversal powers lol
---
You saying a key is niche; I'm saying it's not counterable. These statements are not mutually exclusive.
---
What was it before?
---
Woah hey, I‚Äôve got this mask, but... dominatrix event? What kinda kinky shit did I miss?
---
Happens to me daily
---
Just save your points until it's released then?
---
They are planning something or have changed some rules for the shrine and creating new perks
---
The buff or nothing line at the bottom is kind of stupid tbh
---
Sad part is that it took my three times to see the Claudette.  Even when she's the size of a building, she still blends in.
---
I honestly am so sad by Legion. 
---
I bought Ghostface knowing he's considered a worse Myers with some inconsistencies, but did it because I knew he looked fun as hell regardless. Crouching and peering behind the corners really captures the feel of being a calculated stalker, whereas Myers just kinda glares from afar. Fun &gt; strength.
---
But then I bought Legion, because Feral Frenzy seemed fun and I love the over the top angsty murderer teenager thing they have going on... but man they're just *so bad* that it makes playing as them feel unfun. It's one of the few times I've regretted spending money on DLC for a game I love.

Yeah I consider that the most realistic change. The no scratch marks would just make her an actual hard killer to use but like you said the learning curve would probably be way too high to a point where only the most devoted Spirit mains would stick around to play her.
---
I feel like the phase sound nerf would probably be more reasonable if the game had more fair loops or shifted away from being so chase heavy.
---
But yeah, hopefully BHVR considers the no collision. She is the Spirit after all and it would fit with her lore too. In an ideal world, no character should ever be deleted from a game, just balanced properly, but if they she and Nurse stay in their current spots, I will always voice my disdain for them. Lol.
---
True dat
---
i‚Äôm with you bro :) here‚Äôs to hoping!
---
The max 1 million is only just close to enough to getting one of them to level 40. The other two will have nothing.
---
Yeah, trowing hatchets may be deadly, but they aren't bullets, you can realistically dodge them. Sure the chainsaws need the killer to be up close to utilize them efficiently but once you got hit by a chainsaw, deadly or not, you are not getting up again for a while.
---
Did someone mention our Lord and Savior

I am currently a hag main and as you can see by my name, it won't be like that for long.
---
This has never happened to me on console
---
No thanks needed. I like to help ppl. U just enjoy the game and we can consider it even :3
---
It can spawn anywhere where‚Äôs there space for it, the best tip I know is go around the perimeter of the map first. This is theoretically the safest way to cover the most space and be safe as generally the perimeter is least traveled area by the killer. Avoid the center if it can be helped as that the area the killer will go through the most. By going around the perimeter you can also scout a good deal of ground. I hope that helps.
---
Made today, I don't use flashlights tho so it being bad is my ignorance. _.
---
Dark sence is underrated
---
I consider the Pig has limitlesss amount of arsenal, resulting in instant S tier. If the entity generated The Game, then I assume the pig hinerited all of John Kramer's traps and torture devices, plus the lil'knife can retract wich gives it Assasin Pigs : Odyssey vibe.
---
Must of been the ghost of Claudette since there are no other survivors. Also the colors seem off a bit. Wtf is going on with this video?
---
No idea what that says
---
Me with those nurse daily rituals
---
hell yea
---
I feel like Gehrman would be hard to do maybe Father Gascoigne would be cool and have something based of his beast form for his ability
---
Slow survivors down, give you map awareness- they‚Äôre a lot stronger than people give them credit for.
---
The link expired, try editing the invitation link's expiration to never
---
Ghostface does not require a learning curve he's like the easiest killer to learn
---
Would've been funnier if you just said "who killed Adam?"
---
Its also five gens so I‚Äôm more than willingly to bet that no one was hooked and she slugged and went to find other people to slug.
---
if you play against a tombstone/tuft myers and he gets to tier 3, then you kinda deserve to get tombstoned. tuft/j myers memorial is what you should be talking about.

Nope it‚Äôs the 5-9th

---
15 seconds from spotting to end is plenty of time to land a hit. If you spend 2-3 minutes to down a survivor at higher ranks you‚Äôll get absolutely shit on if there‚Äôs even 1 or god forbid 2 other competent players in the game, because they will 3-4 gen you and get the remainders before unhooking and run out the gate.

---
It‚Äôs the ‚ÄòTaking one for the Team‚Äô achievement- get smacked near a hook whilst the killer is carrying someone 250 times. He‚Äôs at 249.
---
I did not take the cultural power of the katana out of context, using a katana to hunt down survivors is less efficient than using bear traps or fucking phasing between the dimension of the living and the dead the way the wailling bell does. The spirit would be overrrated if she could not retract it into nothingness at will.

ding dong you are wrong

perks that the first tier of is green were originally pink at level 3

Wait, how can you even be rank 20 and have two perks equipped? That‚Äôs at least a dozen games, isn‚Äôt it? Unless you earned all your BP as a Killer, in which case you‚Äôre not really ‚Äúnew.‚Äù
---
This is rad

I'd like to seem some justification for why you think it would be client-side hit detection.

Darkness consumes us, closer to him each day, waiting, for his children to return to the fog.

Wait off until it comes out so you can see actual game play. I have the pleasure of playing it on pc and it is far superior to playing on ps4. I cant imagine how much worse it will be on switch or mobile.
---
It is legitimately the worst achievement. So inconsistent unless you literally kill yourself for it.
---
New mask is better but the ears look just a bit too small for me.
---
the fact that mayyyyybe in the slightest chance pig is a furry is too disturbing for me.
---
Only at certain times- to a new player, Michael Myers can be scary as fuck (especially if he‚Äôs using Scratched Mirror). Ghostface and maybe also the Spirit can also be somewhat scary to play against. But overall, it really isn‚Äôt bad at all. Most of it wears off pretty quickly (except for Myers... not only do I have hundreds of hours, I also main Michael, and yet he can still scare the shit out of me sometimes).
---
Well is zoophilia legal, I ask you ?
---
Exhaustion will recover if you just stop running for 40 seconds. So in the meantime, just walk away while the killer tries to recover.
---
.-.Huntress talking about hitboxes hmmm
---
I use a macro that came with my mouse software. Been using it for almost a year now and never have gotten banned. 
---
It's probably in the same category as certain monitors having a crosshair built into them. If you use the software associated with your device the anti-cheat won't pick it up.
---
Hell I use MLGA all the time too and never had anything happen either.
---
If they kept dying then that would explain why they are rank 20
---
made with mematic
---
The licensed characters that we have really dont fit in with the game‚Äôs story and are barely canon to their movies/TV shows. Laurie survived the 1st Halloween movie yet she‚Äôs in the entity‚Äôs realm so they probably wont he canon to the actual show
---
Nope, even Premonition. It says it trumps every stealth ability, but Tier 1 Myers is the only exception.
---
I had the same problem as survivor, but I will admit I haven‚Äôt been on in a while

Well- i dont think is a good idea playing and learning in switch. Sure the pc game isnt perfect but its WAY better performance wise. It may be an alternative if you are really really interested tho :)
---
Why is there such a small amount of people who would actually like a FNaF killer?
---
Not only that, but they‚Äôre also kinda funny too. He never really makes any noise like this (except MAYBE something similar when he gets shot in the neck in H2018), so when I first heard it, it really caught me off guard.
---
There is nothing like that, Maybe you mistook something different as survival bp?
---
I agree. Run Borrowed Time dickheads. 
---
And for any killers who have the time, please tunnel people who farm without BT to death, ESPECIALLY if they‚Äôre David with WGLF. Then tell them it‚Äôs because they farmed with no BT.

I also remember her form the movies and remembers that she was much more prettier than a disfigured tall woman with leprosis.

I think they're annoying then. Even still, that's Behaviour

I mean she was ok looking but she was such a bitch and killed some of best characters by making traps unbeatable
---
I understand your confusion, do not worry. It is the tradition of the internet.
---
Little do you know, it‚Äôs a homing missile
---
I love the boys.
---
I already have every killer perk unlocked through game play. I've only spent shards on cosmetics or during the PTB for extra bloodpoints. I guess I could add Ruin into my build.
---
Imagine being one of the people that‚Äôs pissed we AREN‚ÄôT getting another dumpster fire like old Freddy.
---
This coming from someone who‚Äôs mained Freddy since his release.
---
exactly.
---
I understand this I do but today I met the friendliest spirit ever after the game we became friends and played swf for the rest of the day
---
 and many companions along the way, at least I did it with borrowed time
---
ah the macro is on my keyboard i have like 5 macro keys and whats MLGA? is it like a hacked client?
---
I understood this meme, you peasants need IQ of 200 to get this

yep

imo i don‚Äôt see people run it that much
---
You can also see Spirit‚Äôs underwear if you spin her schoolgirl outfit around enough.
---
Not that I‚Äôd know or anything.
---
Good thing they got there before the assassins bloodlust kicked in.
---
I only recently got DBD. I read about the moon in the wiki, and how it was removed. Can you elaborate on the moon?
---
I would assume that full moon offering made the map brighter, but from your post it suggests it made it harder for the killer to see survivors.
---
Damn, that is one demonic looking Trapper.
---
is this the upside down
---
nvm it checks ping
---
He sucks them, its already too much for my poor mind. Just imagine him remembering his kills, sucking each of his rotten collected fingers one by one, entering a daze of joy and pleasure at each sucks when the memory of tortures comes back to his mind. Just. Imagine that.
---
MY DEVOUR HOPE DUUUUUUUUDE
---
has begun
---
Dwight is a free character, I recommend level him up to 40 instead of buying from Shrine. You can farm 1.000.000 bloodpoints way faster than it would take you to recover the 2.000 shards spent on Shrine.
---
I reserve my Shards to buy cosmetics and perks that belong to DLCs I don't plan on buying.
---
We know Frank is the oldest and all of them are younger than him.
---
Meaning Joey Susie and Julie cannot be older than 19 and if they are 19 they can't be older than Frank.
---
Due to cosmetics we know that Susie is a sophomore meaning that she is between the ages of 15 or 16
---
Due to cosmetics as well we know that Julie is a senior meaning she's probably around 17 or 18.
---
While we don't know much about Joey as both lore and cosmetic descriptions doesn't seem to give any hint of an age range.
---
Well we do know he has his own car and he used to have a job this doesn't really give much information as he could be driving from the age of 16 
---
This is just my conclusion but I will also put Joey as a senior so pretty much around the same age range as Julie worst case scenario a couple months younger than Frank.
---
The long and short of it is Susie is most likely not legal as for Julie it kind of just depends on where you are
---
Yup, the Halloween Chapter is only based off the first movie. Michael and Laurie‚Äôs designs, their bios, the quotes on their perks, and Michael‚Äôs addons only reference the original movie (except for Dead Rabbit- that isn‚Äôt a reference to any movie, it‚Äôs kind of out of place since every other addon has to do with Judith).
---
I've tried that combo but never found it useful in escaping a chase  :(
---
Ok I'll probably do that then, thanks for the feedback man :)

If the bloodhunt was on while they released you could get all of them to 40 in like one play session. Obviously Im holding a million + dailies but the bloodhunt would be nice.

Get Ruin, but don't use it.
---
Learn to apply map pressure without Ruin.  You'll get your ass kicked a lot, but eventually you'll start getting good.  By the time you are competent to get to higher ranks reliably, you'll find that there are other perks that you enjoy and find better use of.
---
Also -- When learning a new killer, or killer at all, DO NOT USE ADDONS.  Learn to use the base power.   Once you get feeling pretty good without addons, then go hog wild and find what you like to use and don't.  (I watch a guy called Scorpionz -  [https://www.twitch.tv/scorpionz](https://www.twitch.tv/scorpionz)   \-- He about only plays Pig, is the best Pig player you'll EVER see, and he likes the brown Combat Straps addon.   Seems simple, but once you are comfortable without addons, it'll make picking your favorites easier later.)

Here's a video on the infamous story, it's pretty interesting.
---
Patch 1.8.3 Called, It wants its Odd bulb back
---
This is indeed a disappointing day for us survivor
---
Beautiful craftsmanship
---
Well hopefully they don't listen to Killer Mains' advice from here and don't just start off running Ruin.  They'll never learn map pressure and by the time they reach the green ranks they'll constantly get crushed.
---
Then run here and cry that survivors are too strong and need a nerf.
---
Good. Let the hate flow through you.
---
I'm definitely not disagreeing
---
This is a very good perspective.

Is this what dead by daylight hell looks like?

You're literally the person in this video.

When I first heard it, I was like "hmm is that what he sounds like if he gets pleasured" .

I know I'm not the only one who legitimately has a fetish for Michael Myers. Right? Not the only one who had a wet dream about daddy Myers? RIGHT?

DCing is just short for disconnecting though, they're not really words with different meanings.
---
Kinda like Leveling and Lvling or Damaging and Dmging.

all i want is for them to either change gate spawns, or make it so if the killer closes the hatch they cant see the red lights on the top of the lever

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

There were two moon offerings, one brightened the map, the other darkened it. The darkest moon add on made it so the moon was gone and made the map really dark. The brightest one made the moon come out in full so it would be bright.

God Bless you, Phantom\_Mask for a Godly meme.

That‚Äôs how I feel. Like why do they feel the need to teabag especially at the exit gates. It makes me want to bring noed just so I can kill them before they even get to teabag idk
---
Billy is a lot better

David. DAVID. D A V I D?

As an Ace main, I'm offended. I've been called Dwight countless times, but DAVID??!!!?!

I feel like Unbreakable would have gotten you a ton more value than Boil Over, especially combined with Flip-Flop and Tenacity. It would have allowed a faster charge which meant you probably could have gotten Flip-Flop off in a few scenarios.
---
Not saying it would completely turn around the results or anything, but even just Tenacity + Unbreakable has proven useful for me in the past, even if it's a bit of a gimmick.
---
Dude just calm down. You actually a paranoid freak. If you were to get banned just buy the game again for $10.

Omg I love Jane I want her to have that school girl outfit from clueless I think it would look amazing on her

Oh lord how could I have been so blind.  My apologies to all Ace mains.  
---
~~I was wondering why he was being altruistic, makes more sense now~~
---
He has map control, can 1 hit survivor. Meanwhile LF is meant for camping the hook. Why reduce such a badass killer to shit, Id honestly rather use legion.
---
I honestly main Bubba as a M1 killer as bad as it sounds. 
---
Brutal strength 
---
Bamboozle 
---
Thrill of the hunt
---
Devour hope
---
These perks are really fun and imo he has the best kill animation in the game so the odd game i get the devour stacks and get a 2-3 man kill count makes me feel things lol
---
Good luck. People like to try to loop you alot so i took 2 perks that really help me chase someone down in alot less time.
---
Good.   There are other better perks if you are good enough to do that!
---
Lol, im glad i got barbecue and chilli on the shrine this week. I was gonna buy LF just dor that perk.
---
This made me smile thank you
---
Take it from me, An experienced sentient killer main. It gets worse, but if you train yourself you will be able to kill all good survivors.
---
Thank you ! *Drools*
---
I thought his name was Myers, how come everyone says Meyers?

whilst this would be cool it would also be a nightmare to code especially this close to release

OUAH

Go fuck yourself

Delete this or learn how to use the spoiler function please. Be considerate to others.

Yeah franklins demise is good if a lobby has items. Other than that hes only good for bbq and chili
---
Why u hate ape race man not cool
---
Wow, How come I never see these people? All I ever get is toxic hate
---
Yea vs the clown
---
Im a dwight/nurse main on ps4
---
Maybe I‚Äôm still too new and dumb, but isn‚Äôt it a good thing for the killer to chase you all match? That means you did a good job.
---
Did you end up getting enough shards for BBQ?
---
He needs a rework, not a buff
---
I have to use bbq and chili, franklins demise and knockout for adept. 1 being pretty good, franklins demise situational and knockout is pretty useless by itself.
---
Damn yo that‚Äôs actually mad dope!üíØ
---
Poor wraith, at that time he was so bad. With instablind being a thing, he was getting burned 24/7. Oh and a fun fact: When Killers would vault a window, It would take like 4-5 seconds.
---
Last time I ate at a McDs was 2005. And using their wifi is wildly unsafe, and likely slow, who needs it with decent 4G?
---
I don't care about being looped. It's the tea bagging at every pallet. I don't care if someone sabotages a hook. It's when someone sabotages all the hooks in an area to 99% and then sprints up to the hooks as I'm walking to it and finishes the sabotage. Body blocking the hook is just wrong. This is a survival horror. Nothing you can say will make me believe that creating a wall of people in front of a hook is right. The killer should be able to walk through a survivor, pushing them out of the way. Or recover from an attack fast enough to not have someone wiggle off your shoulder while you stand there in a cool down

That's true. I was just making a joke though man lol. I do completely see where you're coming from though at a serious standpoint, and by no means are you wrong.
---
Teabagging is an entire language in the R6S

This happens to me as well except that I use both unbreakable and tenacity

I like the demogorgon, but imagine how cool it would be to have wall and ceiling portals. I'm suggesting, not bitching
---
Graduate high school then post memes lol
---
It would be pretty cool.
---
Imagine it descending onto you from the ceiling
---
What are you saying? you must be smoking you daft cunt
---
Its hard but not impossible. Took loads of practice and many 0ks lol
---
And what I'm talking about is the fact it's the survivors side of "unfun tactics" is the one being nerfed. Unsafer loops and fewer pallets. The only nerf or adjustment i can think of for face camping is the fact survivors can be unhooked from either direction.(Which took about a year or so to implement) Face camping is still very powerful and annoying.
---
Also the new perks while strong and fun are not really meant to deal with face camping. Also not survivor you will face will be an untouchable demon. This mentality of scary survivors has to stop.
---
I swear the Entity guides my teammates to haunted grounds right before I start getting chased because it always pops right before I‚Äôm being smacked with a hatchet or a knife. Every. Fucking. Time.
---
Ghostface is an amazing stealth killer who really excels at taking out survivors one on one. Pig is great too. The "nerfs" that people were complaining about were because of the changes due to the end game collapse being implemented. I was maining pig at the time and the changes made sense because of the new mechanic. The change was that unless your trap was activated by a completed gen you could now leave the exit gates with an unactivated trap on your head. All this did is now most pig players put traps on more in the mid game than the end game like they did before the change. Though I will admit changing her dash attack to no longer be considered a standard attack was a bit of a nerf since it won't activate noed anymore.
---
It will depend a bit on the map, but overall the pallets are much stronger.
---
I don't see what all the LF hate is about, I love the guy. His power isn't hard to hit Survivors with at all imo, I usually 3k-4k with him, especially against overly altruistic survivors that travel so close together, free insta downs for the whole team. Plus people usually expect bubba to face camp so they almost never go for a save, meaning unless it's a swf group I just get a free sacrifice while i get to patrol the map.
---
J
---
Playing as racecar spirit is a fucking blast
---
New killer: The Penguin
---
Ability: Chill Out.  Creates a square of ice around them that reduces survivor traction and makes moving less accurate and controllable
---
Snares are great for early pallet drops and easy hits on vaults, as well as traps for clocks or hooked survivors
---
Not everyone needs to be viable for red ranks, he has his place. And if you are really good with him, he can be viable.
---
Hot
---
&gt;I think killers should start with 50k and be penalized for every survivor that escapes.
---
Then survivors should start with 50k and earn nothing for dying.
---
Okay I apologize. I've just seen a lot of people just yelling about buffing/nerfing demogorgon before he even comes out/people can adapt to then...and I know what happens... *ahem* *Freddy*
---
It's pretty rare. Sometimes you get a farming killer 2 times in a row and sometimes you go without seeing one for months. As survivor you just kinda decide for yourself if you want to take advantage of the potential free Bloodpoints or let yourself get killed/leave to get a proper match with a killer that plays the game properly. But again it's pretty rare to run into farming killers.
---
You're right, he has his place... as worst killer in the game.
---
Being good with him relies a lot on luck and not so much skill. If you just happen to get matched up against rank 15-20s, then yea, you‚Äôre gonna have an easy game. But in my experience any other ranks can easily counter him. I can‚Äôt think of a strategy to be really good with him that doesn‚Äôt rely on face camping or other frowned upon strategies
---
lmao I just bought the hag two days ago. RIP.
---
I made [portraits of Feng and Claud](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cu7be5/claudette_and_feng_fanart/) and I wanna work on doing portraits of each survivor and maybe even getting someone to mod them in for the survivor portraits in game! So here‚Äôs two more, hope you guys like it! Gonna do Quentin and Laurie next
---
I would like to just quickly mention that my commissions are open right now and if you‚Äôre interested to PM me!
---
Bruh honestly I just leveled up my bubba for bbq last week and 2 days later bbq shows on the shrine. Now i just recently leveled my deight and prove thyself came. Ffs.
---
Might snag diversion for the memes tho
---
What rank are you? Because from what I‚Äôve seen, anyone lower than rank 15 can easily counter LF (without LF having his powerful add-ons). Most low rank survivors are pretty ballsy, and will go for the unhook.
---
these look great, I think you captured them perfectly and I love Meg‚Äôs freckles!
---
Ok, this is really cool!!!!
---
Back then, it was Dark Souls difficulty for killers.
---
Don't be surprised if someone randomly comes to your house destroys it.
---
I‚Äôm mad cause I wasted my shards for bbq last week &gt;:(
---
I *just* bought Hag for my alt to get Ruin :/ 
---
Fek...
---
They are gonna nerf his snares cause they are too powerful.
---
Hopefully, the devs see this and actually get some ideas going on how to slow down the game a bit.
---
I don't think I seen anyone bitch about SB since it went up to a 40 second CD with exhaustion that doesn't charge when running which is somewhere around a year ago I think.
---
What you're describing is literally people just playing poorly. I've heard multiple times now the best use of DH is not to get a nutty super epic juke on a killer, it's to get that bit of extra distance you need to get to a pallet or window as that adds more time then making a killer wiff 1 hit. BT, DS and Adrenaline are all so highly regarded right now because the current meta people are going with is just gen rush super hard even when injured near other survivors because Adrenaline will heal you and even if you get hooked, as long as you're taken off you got  45 seconds to get DS used which can work as an extra health state and BT to work as an extra health state.
---
I'm telling you, pay attention to how people actually play and watch a bigger variety of people then monto if you watch DbD videos/streams. DS is meant to help deal with tunneling and BT is meant to help counter camping but they're both used in ways that essentially make them extra health states under certain conditions. Personally I don't feel they're really even that bad because higher tier killers really shouldn't have trouble getting a 4K when played well anyways and in my experience playing killer that's the case, but the point still stands which is just because a killer got shit stomped and is running NOED and you decided to not cleanse the usually pretty easy to cleanse totems, it doesn't mean Adrenaline, BT, DS, DH is fine or the killers fault for getting fucked by when they're used as they are.
---
Pallets are mindless and require no skill to use effectively, just place them everywhere you can. Im not calling them overpowered but theres no improving your ability to use them effectively. 
---
Snares have a much higher skill ceiling than pallets and can be used to shut down loops quickly or make people abandon them altogether. 
---
Both are usable but Snares in the right hands are far more effective than pallets will ever be.
---
Actually no. There was only 1 person (kate) in basement. I got out and came across a meg, so naturally I pursued her. She had the very bright idea to loop me around the basement (Backwater boat) and then I saw someone else's marks leading into the basement, you'll have guessed it, it was Dwight. I as you said, Vroomed into the basement but Dwight was turning around the basement hook like a stripper so it took me some time to actually have the confidence to launch the attack without hitting it. During this time, in the split second I did not have a visual on Kate I launched my attack and after a second of looping I hit the the pole and tantrum. Luckily, during that time Dwight was in range of tantrum, so was meg who decided to follow me in the basement to save kate, resulting in triple down as kate was rescued last second.
---
I didn‚Äôt say anything about Legion, I said the line at the bottom was stupid.  It ruins what was otherwise a funny meme.
---
Im hoping that's haunted grounds. Great job!
---
You. I liked you.
---
Neither have I. But i have also seen people trying to argue the counter is a waste of time
---
Fortnite players be like:
---
It was my best but also scariest tantrum, cuz I tought I hit none of the survivors during it.
---
Literally have already been 30 posts.
---
idk why people get so bothered by it
---
The Meme is surprisingly good in EGC: pebble one area around one gate, run to the other. Usually the Killer qill be searching thoroughly the area where you made noise.
---
I got 4k'd by a bubba in red ranks today and yesterday I was the sole survivor (barely escaped). They were really good with not colliding their chainsaw into walls
---
Jake Park/Trapper is my main but my all time favorite was Legion.... before the nerf.
---
Honestly, when I escape from the killer it's ridiculous how close I really still am.
---
"Wasted" and "BBQ" don't go together well.
---
Yes
---
Can't you just level up the hag? Since she is free anyways
---
Their is always going to be a worst killer. Smash Bros has lots of shitty characters and it's way more competitive of a game than DBD. But some players can do really well with them or otherwise just fun if it's more casual, same with low tier characters in smash
---
I followed the link to the original but cant seem to save my little legion to my phone!!! Haaalllppp
---
Okay 1, Rip the graphics, 2. Rip the scenery, 3. WTF
---
1-I don‚Äôt remember a single video where he was tea bagging for sake of bming
---
2-cussing isn‚Äôt necessarily bad it‚Äôs purely a preference.
---
Not to be rude but if you don‚Äôt like cussing then don‚Äôt watch his videos and criticize him with invalid reason 
---
3-i mean everyone does it every single youtuber do it it‚Äôs not a big of a deal when it‚Äôs clearly isn‚Äôt personal and for fun, I don‚Äôt see anyone shitting on usslysis when he bitch about how much his team suck and how good he is.
---
*Haunted grounds
---
this man redid his post after his other one got shit on lol
---
gotta do Steve and Nancy eventually too I guess haha
---
Funny thing is this survivors usually getting stomped
---
nah was ruin suprised I didn't see the killer DC after
---
Honestly I'm just surprised to see a door 99'd and not open. Brings a tear to my eye

I think Detective Tapp should also have the Big Black Clock perk.

That was me I just fixed the meme

I may've gotten my moon names mixed up; it's been  a while since they were removed. But basically one would make the maps darker and, for some maps, it made them *ridiculously* dark. 
---
My funniest memory is my buddy and I did the offering + mist as Blendettes. My buddy was cleansing a lit totem. The clown went to check on his totem and it was so dark the clown didn't see my friend *actively* cleansing it literally right in front of him. 
---
And it was one of those totems where the clown could've trapped him in there. He stood in front of his totem for a solid second or two, as he probably heard totem cleansing noises, but couldn't see a damn thing. 
---
I was hiding in a corner watching this unfold laughing my ass off. It's good they got rid of that offering; it was so broken lmao.
---
They've openly endorsed and accepted the use of voice chat software
---
If your ranks are vastly different, match making will take much longer
---
:(
---
Yup easily one of my and my friends biggest complaints. Actually it is my biggest complaint.
---
"Pretty good job so far..."
---
Also known as hyperbole
---
Do you think a data like that exist? Whatever..
---
The point is many content creators force them to do things to actually survive. Let's take for example Noob3, do you think he loves playing DbD? Even after he stated numerous times he find it boring and not interesting. Which means play to entertain and get a living out of it not because he loves DbD..
---
Just because TydeTime was BRUTALLY honest, doesn't mean he stated exactly what Noob3 has stated in the past and not only him. I'm taking Noob3 example since it's in the same community but there are other instances as well. The difference between these two is one were more brutal when they were honest about it, and Tyde have a pretty good reason to do what he do even putting a goal to not ""abandon"" the fans who loves his DbD videos if he reaches a certain goal
---
That's something not everyone does, I can point out people in league community or in OW and so on that do the same but they never say it so clearly to make sure not to alienate their fans/viewers. I've seen many streamers and content creators just "take the mask off" because was so stressful to do something you hate and making it look like he/she is having fun for entertainment sake
---
I don't think I need further explanations since this happens everyday and isn't surprising many feel the same after a while, especially who create content about one single thing, especially in gaming. If you're a movie reviewer or something like that you watch, analyze, or create something new Everytime while gaming content creators who play basically one game over and over get burned out of it.
---
Isn't something so weird or difficult to understand. Point out a person like TydeTime just because clearly stated his intentions, doubts and goals seems unfair, just for being honest out of all things. I won't change your mind or anything but crucifix someone just for that is silly
---
For a fun time?
---
I mean something for everyone I guess lol
---
What platform?
---
I did, my bad.
---
Mmm I'm rank 12 and I think he's 16
---
Trapper with colour bottles.... (*Happy Trapper Noice*)
---
I did it on Lery‚Äôs it‚Äôs difficult to hit a chainsaw at high ranks but you‚Äôll get more points towards medals for m1ing.
---
Bring a game or Lery‚Äôs offering, both of these maps are generally Killer favored due to their small size which makes it easy for any killer to patrol the map quickly. 
---
All you can really do is bring a map offering that favors you and hope they‚Äôre not a 4man swf that and maybe wait till rank reset.
---
Ive done Adept Huntress, Doctor, Leatherface, Hag, Ghost Face, Clown, and Billy, and i hated going for all of them.
---
As a huge switch fan and a huge DBD fan, I regrettably would have to advise you agaisnt getting the switch version
---
You might attract the attention of the actual Entity, gotta watch out fam. &gt;..&gt;
---
This is where I yell ‚Äúoh bullshit‚Äù more than anything else. I swear I am so far through the goddamn window and I noticed it playing killer too. I land so many hits that I absolutely shouldn‚Äôt have.
---
Not one time did I ever mention noob3. You can use him as an example all you want but it doesnt counter my point, and he also doesn't count as 90% of the youtube community.
---
This is a dumb question but how did you do this?
---
I mean with other killers I need some type of skill, like with clown or huntress, but with LF all i gotta do is rev up my chainsaw at the right time and it's free kills lmao. I guess my idea of a fun time is a mindless time.
---
PC
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Have some gold!
---
Damn, I need to cleanse this one, I can‚Äôt just kick it
---
Ah yes, I forgot everything is a metaphor for humanity and having some form of a change in a video game is just too much to ask for. My bad sir, I'll go to gamer school and learn these philosophical ideas that you must have learned from your many gamer years.
---
Jokes aside, you can't compare a common problem that can and should have been solved like dc punishments, and brush it off as "What you describe is a lesson in the fact that the world owes you nothing and people will enjoy the schadenfreaud of ruining things for others just for the lulz. Welcome to humanity."
---
If asking for a more entertaining gaming experience where I'm not anally dunked on by people who dc without any timeout for doing so is bad, then maybe I'm in the wrong. But I can assure you after hundreds of hours playing as a "young gamer", not only is it not healthy for the community's life span, but it also isn't good for other players to come in expecting a 3+ year old game to have a functioning multiplayer system where punishments are dished out when appropriate.
---
It truly was. I was actively scared to play Killer at high ranks back then. It still stresses me out to play Killer at high purple/red ranks these days, but I was *legit scared* to do so a few years back. Like I just stopped playing killer until rank reset at that point.
---
It was postsed on here a while ago that it was a tip that u see her start glowing that means shes teleporting and idk how a bug can make a character unintentionally glow when they are using their power, idk man I'm just sayin it makes alot more sense for this to be a part of the game then a bug.
---
This and detectives hunch is the best anti hex combo
---
Thats some fine trolling right there. Lemme get the popcorn ready
---
Yeah but the pairing of BBQ/Distortion followed by Ruin/Prove Thyself is pretty sus.
---
Killers who say adrenaline is hard to counter...
---
HOLY SHIT I FEEL THIS
---
This is such a good mask, hope you don't have any trouble seeing out of it! I made on a while ago and I made the eyeholes so small it's impossible to look to the left or right without turning your head.
---
Solvent Jug is a pretty fantastic addon to use. And it‚Äôs only yellow so it‚Äôs fairly common. But like all killers you‚Äôre going to need meta perks to do well in most games.
---
These campers ugggh.
---
Not great, not terrible
---
Dunno about Xbox but I've been playing for about three months now, climbed to killer rank 10; I've found that 18-20 are about fifty/fifty for toxicity. 14-17 was pretty solid, occasional asshole, but usually not more than one a game.
---
I hit rank 13 and good lord did that change quick. In a typical game, at least two survivors nonstop teabag and flashlight me all game, and the other two get toxic af in after chat.

---
No, this is your mom, please come back home, it's been 4 months, we just want to see you...
---
Fight back harder? Are you kidding me? The main reason these builds are as cancerous as they are is because they remove most of the (already ridiculously limited in the case of Nurse and Spirit) potential counterplay there is. All you can do is hope that whoever is playing Killer is a complete fucking idiot, cause if they have even 2 braincells to rub together, they've won. 
---
Regular 2 blink Nurse can be potentially juked, unless she is extremely good, in which case it's gg by default, but at least its gonna be a loss against someone who knows what he is doing. People who run multi-blink Nurse are those who are bad with her, but adding more blinks is a ridiculously easy and effective way to compensate for this lack of skill. When the guy has 4-5 blinks to burn, at least one is gonna hit soon enough, you can't dodge them all forever.
---
PB Spirit is essentially just gonna depend on whether or not you brought Spine Chill and Iron Will, and you NEED these 2 just to stand a chance against her. And ofc she can still find you even with these perks if she isn't a complete idiot.

Hillbilly is the only one that can be looped, but add an instasaw to the mix and many of the loops you can potentially run him around are now unsafe and will get you instakilled if the guy knows how to flick (which admittedly does take some practice and skill until you can get to that point, but still).
---
But you stand still too for the duration, groaning as if injured whilst you spray the killer.
---
She‚Äôs not free on PC.
---
Inner strength will fix that
---
It's always hilarious to see people saying slugging is holding the game hostage when it's a strategy since you don't have to waste time hooking but also risky if you perform it poorly losing momentum
---
On the other hand if somebody just crouch around the map not doing anything, sometimes for hours it's totally fine for these kind of people.. I won't ever understand why these guys think that slugging is holding the game hostage when you have literally a timer and when expired the game end, unlike urban immersion until the killer dc
---
Dude... that's actually a dope idea. I had seen someone suggest the Legion be characters you can switch between mid match with different strengths and abilities per member, but the question was raised of what they'd do when you're not playing them. Having them just chill around, waiting for the killer player to take control would be extremely unnerving and dangerous.  Plus *think of the mindgames*. Spirit has the mindgame where you just stand there, pretending to be in Phase so the survivor runs at you or slows down, imagine having something like that as Legion? Just standing in one spot as Suzie pretending you're just an AI, then popping out and scaring the shit out of survivors? Love it
---
Droog
---
I GOT YOU DONT! HAHAHAHA (okay all jokes aside, you missed an event. I respect you for playing trappy boi and wanting his cool masks)
---
Their kid...
---
It's RNG my dude. It can pop up anywhere. Only place I haven't seen it is on a second floor, or in the hook basement. I had one game where it was literally 10 steps away from the gate. Sometimes it's out in the open, middle of nothing. Other times its hidden in the little wall things where gens are.
---
If you have a killer who can't move fast, run like hell and pray. If they do move fast, try and sneak it and pray.
---
I know! Felt a little bad for the rank 19. But the other 3, no way they didn't know
---
Idk, it can be many reasons, a bug at the servers, a bug with the account of your friends, but don't worry, they always refund how many Bp you have gained or more sometimes, a YouTuber happened exactly the same, and now he still have over 500 mill points if I'm not wrong
---
Dont worry i usually turn my back to the survivor to say "Is ok. U can go"
---
The best Tip i can give you is to not just spam the bottles around. Wait until you are on a loop throw a bottle and double back. With a slow down add on you mostly be guranteed a hit. Throw them in their path where they have to go when they want to loop, dont just throw them around and with slow down add ons you will be pretty much guranteed a hit. But just keep on playing and you will figure him out
---
You don't need to deliver the fact that people are cunts no matter what. Anybody who has played multiplayer in video games knows that people will play like dicks just to fuck with you. But this isn't a conversation about dickheads fucking with people on purpose. This is a conversation about how I get fucked over for something that I had no control over, and the people doing it lose what? 2 pips? Oh god please make it 1 pip, the horror, THE HUMANITY, SOMEBODY STOP IT.
---
2 pips isn't enough to deter people from dc'ing, that's why you pretty much get a dc every game. You came into the comments with a condescending tone of "you sound like a young gamer". As if I don't already have a concept of video game communities. I hit back with a condescending tone, then laid out my actual argument after cause that's essentially what you did.
---

---
Sweet looks great wish every main was as passionate  as you are with doctor
---
*Gets hooked upside down*
---
The problem I forsee with that is it punishes players for ranking, then trying new killers. As it is, it's rough playing new killers as you climb the ranks, because you're placed against better skilled characters. If I have to start with low tier perks in a game with a bunch of rank 10 survivors, that's brutal. Similarly for survivors, it's hard to level up that new survivor when you're in rank 10, and your killer is fully perked out.
---
Should I buy the Hag or buy the Spirit? I've been tossing up between the two because Ruin is an all around good perk but Spirit looks like a more fun and better killer.
---
But it's a fake pallet
---
^^good ^^to ^^know...
---
How?
---
A stabby stab, broken ankles, faceplanting on the concrete, Oniichan landing on shoulder blades. Hope you have universal health care.
---
I have crippling depression
---
The twat part was just because he talked crap at the end of the game.
---
So you are saying the chains are the entity itself?
---
But in r6s it's easier to differentiate. If its mid game, its friendly, if it's in the ending killcam, its dickishness. Dbd it's mostly dickishness unless it's the last survivor begging for hatch after being a dick all game.
---
Exact same boat bro lol...should i stop leveling clown lol
---
It's being changed soon, a new killer status buff is being added with the next chapter and it will be rolled out to apply to older stealth killers soon.
---
How long ago was that? That might‚Äôve been me! I had that happen a while back, can‚Äôt remember if it was with Nea, but chatted about it with killer afterwards!
---
He's trolling. Ruin is on the Shrine
---
By this logic you shouldn't be able to see while playing as him.
---
I mean slugging is viable as long as they dont do this. People who say slugging isnt allowed but then use insta heals or flashlight at pallets are just expecting good things for them. Annoying goes both ways.
---
Nah i got adept pig no add ons or offerings LF is just horrible.
---
Welcome to the club *slap*
---
Spirit is best killer on console by a mile so honestly you should be hammering asshole with her.
---
It‚Äôs a possibility, the demogorgon is an animal driven by a desire to feed and kill, the other Killers are driven by a sadistic desire, so what the best way to tame the beast? Put a collar on it and pull back on the leash
---
why do people keep bringing this point up? it can be weak to heat or light and balance always is prioritised over "immersiveness"
---
Typically I see one or two squats as gg or ty, anything more is usually tea bagging, at least in my experience.
---
There is logic in OoO, even if you can reveal a killer, there is a huge draw back that the killer can see you. Plus it didn‚Äôt affect tier 1 Myers. I‚Äôm addition to all of that, it uses up a perk spot which negates space for the 4 meta perks right now, ds, deadhard, adrenaline, and bt. OoO takes a massive amount of skill to master and can be used poorly by a player who doesn‚Äôt have experience with it. Also to answer your question, if it didn‚Äôt let you see every killer, then it would not be balanced and completely useless. In the state it is in right now, I would say it is quite balanced and you just have to learn to play around it.
---
it makes an item useless, tell me one killer that makes an item useless.
---
Oof big facts.
---
I like Tru3Ta1ent personally. He explains a lot as he's going, pretty laid back, and he plays both sides. Runs a lot of different builds, so you can get a lot of info on what to play as well as how to play.
---
You can definitely be a baby with 2 perks. Either don‚Äôt pip or depip most of your games, or killer as you stated. But killer and survivor play very differently so you could still be ‚Äúnew‚Äù in that regard.
---
*wee ooh wee ooh wee ooh*
---
Tier three music pops
---
*WEE OOH WEE OOOH WEEE OOH*
---
Big facts. I wish both sides didnt ex9ect so much all the time.
---

---
Haha, fair enough! But still though, less shameful money grabbing  cosmetics and more game improvements please
---
And the demogorgons chain skin?????
---
Missing.
---
I‚Äôve been too kind with survivors before, and still got hate DM, so now i show no mercy, even if the last one is tbagging in front of me when i close  the hatch, ¬¥cause he know he‚Äôs fucked i still kill him.
---
Or not worried about meta? I play with pretty random perks especially as a survivor. I‚Äôm not particularly good but definitely not new.
---
Everytime man... "okay im just gonna go and get this totem (Mud jumpscare) AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
---
IMO spirit is the killer you should get. If you want ruin then it is in the shrine rn ( sad day for humanity) I main spirit and I can tell you 100% that it is incredibly fun but has a huge skill cap. Have fun in the fog!
---
When did I ever claim the world owed me anything? Please quote the exact area I said "GIMMIE GIMMIE I WANT THAT, PLEASE GIVE ME THAT"
---
I was rational in my argument and not once did I do anything out of line compared to you. You were condescending, I was condescending back, and that was that. You're the asshole who comes in trying to talk down to people as if you know them. I've been experiencing this problem since I first starting playing the game, 500+ hours ago. I rarely rage at people and I'm a fairly patient person. I'm not sure where you're getting this 0-100% rage switch idea from as if you look at my reddit history or even the comments between you and me, I don't lash out at people or attack people unprovoked. 
---
What would you consider a "young gamer", I'd like to know if it's relative to my total age or the amount of years I've been playing games in total. As both are fairly close to each other, so the distinction isn't that important. I'd just like to know what age a "young gamer" is.
---
Yeah I just saw the shrine and decided to go for Spirit!
---
Bbq and chili being in shrine last week was just a ruse so that we all survivor mains wouldn‚Äôt leave the game when ruin went into shrine this week ; - ;
---
Wow, corrupt intervention and bbq where in the shrine last week. Where were you my young child? ;(

Can anyone tell when and how I should use Legion's power?
---
The only trick I learned so far is wait for pallet drop, turn it on, vault and stab IF they are healthy, but... then what? You catch up to them, cancel it and they make distance while you are on cooldown. Going after other people was rather ineffective strategy for me too, as they aren't usually close enough for me to catch up in time.
---
Deliverance should be the only perk that overrides it. If you have it it‚Äôs u fair to not be able to use it
---
I‚Äôm sorry friend. Bbq hasn‚Äôt been in the shrine for 3 years... I hope you have the patience... :l

Baaaaaalls!

---
Why report
---
unexpected thanos
---
Snares are far superior anyhow.
---
I like to pretend Legion doesn't exist. I vowed to never play as or against them. The only way Legion should get a buff as if they get a total power rework like Freddy. Otherwise they're cancerous to play as and arguably the worst feature in the game. Hands down weaker than Wraith, Doc or Leatherface
---
No, I mentioned it..
---
As far as I can see you're too dumb to understand a point. I suggest to read again or.. welp idk how you can get more intelligent so, try your best I guess?
---
I see three Claudettes with a med kit, flashlight, key and their gamer tags have the word toxic in it. I simply switch to Bubba with Franklin‚Äôs, ruin, BBQ, thrill and an ebony.
---
It's not really helping OP's case when the rank 14 kills 3 out of 4 survivors who outranked them lol
---
Definitely not that much.
---
I like to play games. This is an interactive movie where your choices don't matter. Like Telltale Games. No matter what you choose it has the same outcome with the illusion of choice. There's also an absurd amount of bad writing and plot holes. The game is Just overrated because of all the Connor fanfics and YouTubers pretending to cry for views
---
Honestly, I'd say the issue with Diversion is that we can't aim it to get the notification to line up with the environmental objects.  It should "auto snap" to nearby windows/pallets/lockers/gens, highlighting the snapped object while we are crouched with Diversion ready.  If no valid objects are in range, then just free-land as it currently does.
---
It would be way more valuable, because then you could say break LoS, and Diversion a loud sound notification on a nearby window to make it look like you jumped out of it.
---
I miss those offerings, they added a unique dynamic to the game and how each map was played. I wish they'd bring them back.
---

---
You said 90% percent of all content creators hate/dislike what they do and only do it because it's their "job" then you mentioned noob3 for aome odd reason, and that was the only "point" you made. Dumbass.
---
You might want your family to know it‚Äôs from a video game and that you‚Äôre not trying to spawn anything... but great job! Would be a sweet Halloween decoration or just collectible you can say you made yourself!
---
I have been maining Hag for Ruin since I got this game a few weeks ago and am close, but I take solace in knowing that I'll never have to buy Leatherface after getting BBQ &amp; Chili last week.
---
I agree, slugging to avoid DS or to apply more pressure and chase another survivor is fine. I find that when killers slug all 4 when the game is nearly done to get that 4k frustrating to play against, but not toxic or a bad play, and in many cases it may be the right choice. But slugging like what this nurse is doing, should be bannable in my opinion. She's not hooking anyone, she's letting everyone bleed out to waste their time and assert her dominance and shes not allowing the survivors to play the game. I imagine we will see a lot more of these types of players once we get dedicated servers, because dc will be bannable and then survivors either have to wait and give the nurse that satisfaction or leave and suffer the penalty which is also something these players will also find satisfactory.

---
Idk in what region you play but I literally never get slugged. Either the killer picks me up instantly or he leaves me on the floor and I get picked up by a survivor in the end. Either way it makes pretty much the entire perk combination useless
---
Lol they pretty much do. With voice comms swf get the benefits of OoO with none of the drawbacks.
---
Also it‚Äôs still an extremely strong survivor sided perk.
---

Faber Castell fine liners, they come in a set with different tip thicknesses

If you (double) pip in other two games and lose pip in third one, you're ranking up, just a little bit slower.

Also, I feel no shame leaving lobbies with too much toolboxes.

‚ÄúOh shit, my bad guys it was just unplugged‚Äù

No.
---
Nothing wrong with him at all. But I hate when people say they identify as a gamer or play games when they're not playing anything. They're just watching. That's why I think these games shouldn't have achievements or trophies because you haven't really done anything. You just got lucky.
---
My main problem with this game is like Telltale... Your choices only affect that chapter. At the start of a new chapter all of your choices are undone essentially through characters dying anyway or choices being undone retroactively. Telltale The Walking Dead for example whoever you get to survive a certain chapter will die at the start of the next one through flashbacks or a cutscene you can't interact with. If the writing wants to go somewhere, it will go there. They give you the illusion of making choices.
---
You'll learn the game faster by facing tougher opponents, stay positive my dude.
---
8+8=16
---
I did this once before with michael. There were two guys t-bagging and I got one with evil 3. He died and then called me a noob in chat :(
---
Remove that disgusting perk of yours and stop whining. 
---
(Urban evasion)
---
oh boy if they knew what old legion was like
---
as a (OLD) Legion main i laugh at this
---
urban is just fine, thanks.
---
I'll complain all I want cause this isn't balanced. Thanks for the input tho :)
---
You should
---
Wait. I haven't played this in a while. Do you mean that survivors have only 3 minutes to escape after repairing generators? And if they don't, they die?
---
You should see the timer when the hatch closes ;)
---
Timer is necessary so survivors/killers don't take the game hostage.
---
It's just ridiculous, seeing as we had a rank 13 in the game. The Huntress was literally 10 ranks lower.
---
It isn't fun, I nearly double depipped, and it was a waste of my time :/ I could have been doing much better things
---
As a survivor main, sincerely, if that‚Äôs a NOED, f**k you.
---
Otherwise, you‚Äôre good, fam. Really nice work btw, hope you can make more of these to sell because I‚Äôll take one for sure.
---
love that gamer tag my man
---
thank you lmfao
---
Yes it‚Äôs so stupid I can‚Äôt even deal with it
---
What if you walk over to it and it's just broken
---
It starts once either a gate is already opened, or the hatch has been closed by the killer.
---
I am gonna tell you now. It was much worse without the endgame collapse. You would usually just end up sitting there waiting for either survivor or killer to break and give up. Also low ranks are not fun so just keep playing and you‚Äôll get better teammates. A lot of the time the EGC doesn‚Äôt actually pose that much of a threat.
---
if you t-bag you are, by definition, an idiot.
---
It was added because the end game was toxic and abusive otherwise. Survivors wouldn't leave if they thought they could make the killer miserable, or they'd just hide for insane amounts of time.
---
The timer starts once a gate is opened.

---
the golden rule is to only tbag if they deserved it
---
‚ÄúWait a second. This whole operation was your idea.‚Äù
---
They're misrepresenting it. After one of the exit gates gets opened (Not when all the generators are finished, when the gate is powered up and COMPLETELY open, allowing for escape) the survivors are given *I think* one and a half minutes to leave the game or they get killed by the Entity. Along with this, if the killer finds the Hatch, they can close it, which also starts the timer, and the killer can open the doors themselves, which again, starts the timer. These were put in place to prevent people from just hiding around in corners for 20 minutes not making a move.
---
You don‚Äôt have it quite right. It‚Äôs after either the killer or survivor open the exit gates or the killer closes the hatch. The best start is to open the gate to 99% then stop so the timer doesn‚Äôt start yet. But you said you were new so your teammates probably don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing.

It's not a joke. **It never was.**

How comes that the exit-gate teabaggers are always the braindead idiots that get outplayed hard. Most of the time they're the ones that play like shit aswell. Guess they have to compensate their low skill with toxicity

Yeah usually the camera has a spacial logic equation that keeps it from getting inside of the pallets, so it moves closer to your character, keeps the view clean and unblocked. However, because the fake pallets are impermanent objects, that don't have a hitbox for this equation, so you can stick your camera *inside* of fake pallets. That's how you know.
---
Sometimes I have a killer game where I put someone in the basement (firs time they were hooked) and then I just walk away knowing someone will rescue them. But then nobody comes to rescue them, for some reason
---
Back then the lobby didnt show what killer it was? Daamnnn, didnt know
---
Very Cool, except now you have to deal with trappers and witch's spamming traps below it.....
---
Each survivor has 3 exclusive perks and after level 35, 40, and 45, their perks become available in other survivors bloodwebs to be unlocked. Metal of Man is Ash‚Äôs perk and Decisive strike is Laurie Strode‚Äôs perk and these survivors are both DLC characters. You can either 1. Buy the characters with real money and then level them up with blood points until you can unlock the perk for everyone else or 2. Wait until the perks show up in the ‚ÄúShrine of Secrets‚Äù where you can buy perks with iridescent shards that you get from leveling up.
---
Do you have anything better to do?
---
DEFINITELY huntress. She‚Äôs just very hard to master
---
Pebble &gt; Ruin
---
Ruin slows down the early game a bit. It's good on killers that need a slower start and/or can defend hexes easily (Hag, Trapper, Myers, maybe Freddy, etc). It is not nearly optimal on most killers, although people who are new to whatever killer they're playing tend to run it anyways. I think it's extremely overrated.
---
Also if you're playing in ranks 15-20 it can completely stop gens altogether, because at that rank no one can handle it. So there's that, too.
---
expected thanos, for balance
---
I think your main problem is actually being concerned with how other people view games or identify themselves. If you dont like the game(s), then fine, state why and move on. People liking these types of games doesn't make them any more or less of a gamer.
---
As for Detroit itself, the choices are significant, because they evoke emotion and thought by the player. Sure the game may have basically the same ending ( +/- a character or 2) no matter the choices, but it's the journey that ultimately matters.
---
I feel so lucky, came back to the game after a year. Picked up nurse as my favourite killer, put like 60 hours in total and now managed to snag bbq and ruin for her.
---
Really loving this game again
---
yo wtf? why does it look like someone is struggling on your shoulders when you're looking behind you?
---
Op said so in the original post.
---
Oh
---
new player usually camp not because they want to be dickheads but because it seems really legit, like "i just got a survivor, i dont see anyone near me, where do i go? i wait around here for someone to show up for the save". They learn later that in this way they actually get no points, they're not having fun because they're just waiting around and they're ruining the experience for the player who died without even playing. 
---
So yes, i totally agree, be kind with new players and with players in general, we all have bad days and bad games, just get into another game and go on, no reason to be salty and toxic to another person who just played the game in a way you dont like.
---
As the killer, I get hate mail all the time on xbox. If I win they talk trash. If they win they talk trash
---
Putting thanat to shame
---
Urban is not fine, just like Noed it promotes bad gameplay
---
I know this question is kind of off topic, but do you actually get anything for completing the adept challenges? Are they worth doing?

yeah their kid what about it
---
They are usually 7.99 ¬£/‚Ç¨/$, but since this one has 2 survivors maybe it'll be 1 or 2 bucks more

Thats deep

If you‚Äôre ever having a bad day, play Doctor with impossible skillchecks build at Rank 15-20 on Game map. If you don‚Äôt mind a million loud noise notifications it‚Äôll cheer you up.

I'm not going to go watch a movie on Netflix and tell people I'm a gamer because I chose which movie to watch. These aren't games. Because video games require some form of interaction and skill level. Inherently. That's like saying you can be an athlete without doing anything athletic. Or play a sport without knowing anything about it. These are interactive movies. All you have to do is hit a button when prompted to. I would be fine with these interactive movies if they were like $20 and not labeled as games but what they actually are.
---
I'm tired so I probably could have worded that better but as somebody who relies heavily on text to communicate, writing is important. And most of these interactive movies have terrible writing. Edgy teenager levels of Storytelling and false illusions of decisions. They also pay YouTubers to pretend to cry at the ending or death scenes of characters they've been attached to for an hour or two at maximum.

I find these interactive movies to be incredibly lazy for the most part and it sucks because a lot of them could be phenomenal experiences with better writing. Detroit become human it's worse than some stuff you can find on Archive of Our Own when it comes to writing or a cohesive story. There's an absurd amount of laws and plot holes. It's not a game. It's an interactive movie. And it fails at both equally
---
Yeah. Playing actual games instead of watching something with poor writing play out exactly how it wants to well pretending I'm making choices
---
&gt;Sure the game may have basically the same ending
---
But this isn't true
---
I love survivors who have staring contests with Myers.
---
skins
---
You get bloody skinsüéâ
---
I like how even the 4 pistons/whatevers start moving  
---
Also this reminds of the glitch with *Autodidact* when it was first released/in the PTB
---
No
---
Maybe we're playing at different ranks? I'm purple (almost red), and I might get slugged once every 20 games. I play solo, so when I get downed, there often isn't anyone else nearby. Not sure if that might be one of the reasons why.
---
It is Myers just no one spells it right
---
Totem? The trendy word is ‚Äúbones‚Äù
---
It is a visual bug.
---
The killer seeing you isn't a drawback if you're not a moron
---
I shall call it:
---
Hex:POS
---
(POS-Piece of shit)
---
survivors who dont do gens for prolonged periods get cumshotted by the monitor screen as a reminder of what a total piece of shit they really are
---
It was badly designed, that's pretty much it
---
True but there simpler to the spirit except they latched onto a suit and haunted  it to kill were the entity re animated the spirits corpus there both just agngery dead people
---
I really don‚Äôt think you understand the concept of other people finding different things enjoyable. Just because you want to stroke your ego by beating every game you‚Äôve ever played on super ultra hard mode doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else does. And because they don‚Äôt want to do that doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt playing the game, they‚Äôre just playing it/a genre of games they like the way they like too. You really don‚Äôt seem like you have much else going on in your life if you have to spend your time telling people the games and the ways they choose to play those games aren‚Äôt actual games and are just glorified movies. Get off your high horse dude.
---
You learn the game and realize that there isn't "an optimal coordinates 4 man genrush squad" every game
---
What nerfs? The only change it has had is that tiers 1 and 2 were buffed a few months ago.
---
First of all those perks and item icons are horrendous, you can barely make out the add-ons. Secondly I am pretty sure that after X mins in queue you have the ability to get put into any game with any ranked players. Thirdly, there is not that big of a difference between ranks, it is all about how much you play in a lot of cases.
---
It's 2 mins btw
---
It's not a game. It's an interactive movie. Also it's full of plot in bed writing. It values cheap surprises and subverting expectations over actually making sense or logical writing in some areas. People aren't flawed for enjoying it. A game that takes no skill is no game at all.
---
But a football coach isn't a football player for telling the players what to do and having different results because of it.
---
Hello. This is a claudette main, please give up your location with your hope to get to rank 1. Thank You
---
I want this ! Make an Etsy, I‚Äôd pay good money for this.
---
Deal with it. Maybe this time you lose but there will be a time where you will escape and the killer will curse you for all the shit you pull off on him. This game is not about to always escape or kill all survivors every round. It's about to make the best out of a bad situation and ultimately make as much bloodpoints as you can. Good luck
---
Every day I miss old Freddy. Like, it actually hurts how decent of a killer he was and how over memed. Us Freddy mains began to *fight* to not have this rework. he didn't get any worse, but it's also not much better than previously.
---
I love cahlaflour so much! I‚Äôve been watching her for a couple of years now! She‚Äôs the best!
---
Lol it‚Äôs all fun and games until you hear the exposed effect üòÇüòÇ
---
I‚Äôll give them a try! Thanks!
---
I want to make one for Halloween!
---
I‚Äôve never watched them before so I‚Äôll give them a try thanks!!
---
I like true I just can‚Äôt stand that thing he says every time someone subs
---
Generally on console precision and quick reactions are harder.
---
Billy turning is not as precise because we can't use keys for left and right.
---
Huntress hatchets are harder to hit with because joysticks are a bit less precise compared to point and click.
---
Bubba cutting corners not as smooth.
---
And lets not forget nurse she is pretty much non existant on console and if you do see one its usually and easy escape. You just can't get that same blink mouse flick reaction on a console joystick.
---
Listen, survivors do the *same* thing to us sometimes, and force out gens within 4 minutes as a swf depip squad.
---
Higher prestige gives your bloodweb a small chance to replace some Brown nodes with Yellow and sometimes even Pink nodes. That's it really, aside from feeling cool and having a bloody cosmetic you can flex on people.
---
Preorder intensifies*
---
Just making a comparison tho, so he wont think the pc game is as bad optimized as the switch one
---
i suggest putting trap around it...just in case
---
When you click the arrows in the chat, it closes the chat until you open it in other endgame lobbies. Just close it and ignore them. The community is toxic anyway
---
People are salty they lost and anonymity also them to be jerks. Or they want to feel better then others.
---
I mean, you're asking them to lie about it being a good game, if it wasn't for them because NOED stopped that. Obviously you can have a good game even if you lost/died, but NOED kinda robs that feeling due to a sudden change that had no previous warning with something the survivors needed to know and counterplay before it even became a thing, sometimes with no room to do so.  
---
However, there's no reason to insult the killer for using it, it's a part of the game and will continue to be so (unless it gets changed).
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that just puke. Your laughing puke and that disturbing
---
I think it said "Survivors who say NOED has no counter" and people were like "no one thinks that"
---
You're right OoO takes a really good survivor to use properly. However you're wrong in that it's balanced. OoO against anyone but spirit or nurse is a ridiculous perk in the hands of a confident looper. it's also especially nasty against huntress that has such low TR and movement speed you can run her for minutes around large structures.
---
That and do we really need a perk that is godlike against stealth killers that already struggle, but useless against top killers. There is similar issue as with old MoM
---
Yay everyone‚Äôs gonna play killer and fuck the queue times even worse
---
Hex perk builds might not always be the strongest builds, but they have the most potential to be super fun. Devour Hope is easily on of my favorite perks in the game. If I'm really crushing a match and I have a good feeling I'm playing against Survive With Friends I'll Mori one of them right in front of the totem, just to see what happens. Third Seal is another fun one cause people will totally forget where their hooked friends are if they don't pay attention. Huntress' Lullaby is hard to get working but once it's fully stacked the number of explosions you hear is downright hilarious, and even better if paired with Distressing and Unnerving Presence. Again, not exactly viable builds or strategies, just good ways to enjoy the game.
---
Ever heard of season reset or do you play the game?
---
Oh wow that's some great salt. How did they even lose ffs
---
You guys should really fuck off.
---
I hope that felt good to do. With over 2000 hours in the game I‚Äôve only ever done this like 6 times. But damn it felt good. I hope you felt the power too
---
The scariest part about this game is when they just yeet a pallet on your head from nowhere.
---
I‚Äôll be using this for my face, thank you.
---
Dark sense is so OP vs sneaky killers. Pig, Wraith, even legion.
---
Just hear me out on this one, Meg gets the Velma skin and Min gets Daphne‚Äôs. Dwight gets Fred naturally
---
if you think diversion is actually a good perk and not something to meme with you don't play survivor.
---
Survivors triggering my hag traps when im carrying survivors to a hook.
---
So, so very good, yet again. All it needs now is a big fat D A R N
---
The devs said that they will punish disconnects.
---
I want to pet it 'til it falls apart üòç
---
I fucking love getting hit through pallets and windows üò´ this game is perfect
---
Um people will get caught even if they have full meta Perks.
---
Im playing on pc and never once had a problem revealing him.
---
Mind telling me what perks I could I could use for that?-
---
price is 11.99$ 
---

I have it and i started playing 2 months ago.
---
I was a old legion main too lol, when Legion was actually pretty alright.
---
price is actually $12

---
Survivor can destroy then and they are super huge and easy to see, the killer should hide them very well or at least have more than 1 near each gate, but yes it could work very very well
---
I'm at 1, and I get slugged every singe game.
---
Yeah well the pig is op and should be nerfed full stop she‚Äôs constantly killing everyone and it‚Äôs stupid and not at all fun to be her
---
AMAZING WORK!
---
Ceiling, maybe not, Wall, abso-fucking-lutely.
---
At 5 token all the survivors are basically fixing to die on hook anyway so
---
I like it for the exposed.
---
Huh?
---
Imo spirit, you can have some funny builds and also if you are creative you can make some mind tricks
---
More like decended
---
Not every killer can use overwhelming though :/
---
That's good to know, thanks! I bought all the DLC when they were on sale (except for Ghostface) so I suppose I should have been saving my shards for cosmetics... Buuut I'm impatient and have been spending them on perks that are good when they pop up.
---
I doesn‚Äôt change anything though. Survivors, if toxic, will just wait to leave until the timer is almost fully over. Now killers can take the game hostage for the entire timer
---
Clearly you don't know what a joke is
---
Have you ever heard of a joke or do you live a miserable life?
---
It's just TTT from Gmod but as a separate game
---
How about that orgasmic growl the Huntress does when you DS her?
---
Nope lol. There‚Äôs no skill involved in standing still waiting for your power to come back. Spirit mains literally opinions do not matter
---
removed someone already posted this
---
Yikes buddy.
---
Because its one killer completely nerfing an item. Lets just bring out a survivor that's immune to bear traps next
---
I'm pretty sure the devs said you get the effect when you touch the portal and I believe you get the killer instinct from holding down the power button.
---
Even so, depending on if there is a cool down on the teleporting, you might be able to spam if as much as want.
---
Just replying to you how you replied to me is all.
---
you can also buy only the killer or only one of the survivor for 500 auric cells, so you pay only 5 bucks
---
I hate the perk because of how my teammates always seem to use it
---
Stonks
---
If it notify as soon as you start cleaning it, it could be very op, I want to play with him now
---
Imagine getting clapped by legion with those toolboxes
---
Yeah but no ptb sadly. :(
---
Tis very sad indeed.
---
I often run shroud of separation or yellow mori just to play on peoples feelings on loading screen :)
---
Seems cool
---
15 dollars material, 15 dollars an hour, add a bit for shipping and you could sell this for 70 bucks easily ;D
---
he said git gud
---
Is Diversion legit worth picking up? Or is it really only good for the meme potential?
---
Im kate main but im still trying to find which killer main i want to beüòï
---
You know what, this makes me happy for some reason
---
Mindgames‚Ñ¢

üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I may or may not sometimes miss stabbing someone because I get too busy staring at her hands... They are very nice looking hands

What‚Äôs game pass got to do with it?

Iyou can sell it for 30
---
Pig/David main here
---
Nea been doing hardcore meth
---
  „Å§ ‚óï\_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§
---
Ruin, play with your food, prove thyself, and pebble
---
It's actually not lol it takes time to expose and at endgame you're probably not going to have time to stalk people.
---
I recommend Hag 100% she's so fun to play and it's so satisfying to play as her. Also try spirit. She's awesome too.
---
Yes is you stalk from a wall
---
yeah. it's tiring, and I feel bad for the killers when I get the 20's. they're probably new to the game cause of stranger things and I'm just doing my job and escaping. don't wanna ruin their experience, so any time it's clear they're a baby, I go easy on em and let em kill me
---
Dont apologize for having an accent my friend, your English is perfectly fine :)
---
Sometimes it really is about the hunt and giving them a fair shot.
---
It's the basement... no hook breaking but otherwise very apt
---
I was thinking of leveling up hag to get ruin.
---
No I don't have to wooo
---
I believe that it's Unnerving Presence, Huntress Lullaby, Overcharge, Distressing, with double Calm add-ons.
---
Gathering around a light source in the dark isn't really a new concept....
---
It‚Äôs effective for camping gates if it‚Äôs like the last person or they decide to fuck with the portals and give you the notification sure, but realistically a coordinated team shouldn‚Äôt have too much of an issue with it especially since his ability to actually chase seems pretty meh and there‚Äôs like a 90% chance survivors will be able to tell when he‚Äôs coming if they aren‚Äôt breaking it like with Freddy spirit and hell even the show. It‚Äôll probably fuck over survivors in brown ranks and get nerfed either way though so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Also he has a whole ass sinking into the ground and rapidly moving thing in addition to how it works lore wise I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs pretty physically moving there compared to Freddy/Hag/Nurse.
---
Both of them need practice quite a bit but when you get enough practice, they're deadly.
---
The Claudette needs a lot of work. I can see her somehow.
---
Reported
---
The Spirit looks like she going to barf lmfao
---
Endgame gives you about 30 - 60 seconds to down someone before they open up gates and leave (and I'm being generous) unless you have the iridescent add on you're not going to have enough time to sneak around
---
Like the original BNP
---
Yeah you're right, but I still don't think it's that useful, like, I use this on some late game builds but personally I don't find it useful with ghostface, I think that where he is more op is at mid-late game where there is still 1 or 2 generator lefts
---
Both consoles and pc can screenshot so why are you posting some sideways low quality shit.
---
Actually, no. Ghost Face costs 4.99 on Steam, same as Ash. The other chapters with maps and survivors cost 7.99.
---
No, run whatever you want
---
I go for totems from the start. Others will too as soon as they notice one and then you will have none soon. Try it out tho
---
Always hold down the run button. Make it embedded into the keyboard. Never. Let. Go.
---
I was talking on his first iteration
---
I'm currently experiencing the reverse-vacuum pallet. When you drop a pallet whilst on the same side as a Killer, and the Killer magically teleports to the other side.
---
I can only assume this is a bug but it's so random and triggering.
---
Yeah definitely. I totally agree with you there. At lower ranks I lean on late game builds because everyone goes through all gens really quick. Noed is like back up for me because I run noed instead of ruin
---
I like spirit and clown
---
I like the editing. Alot of effort.
---
Can i runa 2nd ruin tho?
---
I put a smiley face then disconnect. I like imagining how frustrated they get
---
Yeah that's true. I got a lot of team mates who started saying "gg ez" and saying how bad he was, when I went to their steam profile I saw that they had 1000+ hours in game and were at rank 14. That's just sad.
---
Incredible logic.
---
This feels so good to watch.
---
It's a really good anti tunnel perk. And not busted AF like before the nerf.
---
Yeah but they are handsome and cute. Dont hate my legions.
---
I have them all already, this is sad
---
I guess this is just another one of my morals and obviously some people dont care.
---
But if you know youre better than someone and clearly that teammate of yours was, dont bully someone who clearly doesn't have as much knowledge and experience as you on the game.
---
But this is the internet and unfortunately people are just dicks
---
Yeah, super cool but he is likely to have a huge cooldown on that "teleport"
---
No way to counter Moris, which is BS
---
Time to practice them their skill checks I suppose
---
Another idea for play with thyself you can make puddles of the white sticky substance which it will slow down the killer by 10% when he/she runs into it this can also be affected on other teammates
---
To be fair rank reset doesnt help. I dont play survivor enough anymore to get out of green ranks. I‚Äôd love to be red ranks again because green ranks sucks ass. Its just a race to rush gens before the killer tunnels someone out of the game.
---
However the devs insist on their shitty rank reset every month.
---
Killer isnt as bad because its much faster to double pip there and boost up the ranks
---
Ah okay, no worries :)
---
I highly recommend you try out pop goes the weasel (clown perk) instead of make your choice or nurses if you have it unlocked. It really makes Freddy OP as he can just teleport to wherever he sees someone do a gen with barbecue and regress it. Players I go against never get more than 1-2 gens done before they‚Äôre all dead because if this. 
---
Matchmaking is very shitty sometimes. Ive had stuff like this happen to me a lot, and it is feels very unfair.
---
That must mean it's due for an appearance
---
I just run with them until they feel safe.
---
I'm honestly thinking about doing this for the first time. It's not like I don't have to spare $11.99 and I've always bought full Chapters, but I don't think paying more for two survivors is worth it for me as for killer main. When I play survivor I already have my "main" one(s) already.
---
Yesssss! This is perfect.
---
Diversion this then
---
Can we stop reposting this
---
At low ranks (13-20) pallets. At middle ranks(6-12) any. And at low ranks snares. A good swf can identify which pallets are fake and which arent.
---
Borrowed and decisive where you at?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm always waiting for pop goes the weasel in the shrine (and also waiting for Jeff cosmetic)
---
Depends on your rank I'd say
---
Oh ok
---
You don't really need noed. Especially with a killer that essentially it built into his moveset. Your better off with something that's gonna help through out the entire game, not just the end game.
---
Try play with your food and learn learn how to mindgame with him. You will be unstoppable even without addons
---
QTEs don't require any gaming skill. They just require that you have good reaction time and pay attention. Most of the time they're too slow to be an actual challenge. For example Detroit become human gives you the artificial stimulation of urgency by making the choice disappear after like 20 seconds. That's not a quick Time Event. And besides... Most of the fight teams that have quick time events in them have the same outcome no matter how many you land or fail. Whoever was supposed to win the fight ends up winning and whoever was supposed to lose ends up losing. The cutscene just varies slightly with the same result. I repeat. It's not a game. It's an interactive movie. There's nothing wrong with that, just quit calling that garbage a game.
---
And yes. Please keep taking the bait.
---
Meg/Pig main
---
Nurse is slower than survivors at base. Nerfing her blinks would cause ger to never catch up. To survivors. Get rid of the blink changes and it should be fine. Problem is that nurse is the only killer right now who controls the pace of a match. All other killers get dictated by the survivors. Normally all killers should be as strong as the nurse.
---
Message me for psn
---
Blocked
---
yep. i was in a game yesterday as rank 18 killer (i'm a survivor main and don't play killer often) and got a rank 2 and rank 20 who weren't pre-made. how the hell can a rank 2 and a rank 20 survivor go into the same match. the rank 2 ended up bitching at the rank 20 in the end game chat because he did poorly. poor rank 20 had 0,1 hours in the game.
---
I get that reference!
---
Me experience with pig
---
I have the Jake yee haw hat and the 80's gym teacher clothes, I be lookin fly as frick
---
I surpassed my friend who introduced me to it, they barely play it, whilst Im addicted
---
Real shit tho Slippery Meat and Up the Ante pretty gives you the same result from my experience with it.
---
&gt;Yeah well the pig is op and should be nerfed full stop
---
Oh boy...
---
I'd say very high rank won't fall for it it's probably useable up to like rank 7 if you use it well
---
Mainly because it takes too long after the new update (especially with sloppy). Most optimal survivors will bring bond or or look for people to heal them instead of wasting valuable time healing with self care. However, i think anyone should enjoy the game no matter their play style!
---
Who is Drayton Sawyer?
---
But it is an extremely entertaining perk at times lol
---
That‚Äòs actually a murder mystery
---
Idk honestly red rank does suck and is not that fun at all in my opinion
---
I was talking about Freddy
---
Bubba's brother.
---
Stop censoring names, you tard.
---
Thank you kind sir
---
It‚Äôs zoomed in as well.
---
the most fun part is waiting 20 minutes for a killer queue
---
Fr though why do killers have to queue? WHY?! BACK IN MY DAY THE KILLERS JUST MADE THE FUCKING LOBBY AND IT FELT SO MUCH BETTER SEEING PEOPLE TRICKLE IN
---
I used to be at red ranks, it really sucks. Everyone is toxic, good at pallet looping, and you find a lot of people bring items, especially flashlights so they can pallet camp and blind you if you try to break it. Almost everyone has Dead Hard, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, and Self Care making it hard to anything. It was enraging enough that I stopped playing the game for awhile. But now with matchmaking it doesn't really matter, you'll be put up against a rank 14 killer pretty often.
---
"They just require you have good reaction time and pay attention." So, basically any soulsborne game, for honor, fighting games, etc.
---
As to your instructing me to keep taking the bait, I love your attempt to protect your ego when you realize you have no argument.
---
Anyways, my shift at work is ending and I'm not gonna spend my free time arguing with some deluded person I've never met. Have a good day.
---
This will be helpful against the grand total of 3 Freddy mains who don't just use snares
---
I always feel like, if we had the old movie Freddy..he wouldn‚Äôt have been shit on like that. He would have  come out our monitors and grab our ankles. 
---
So yeah..idk.. it‚Äôs a stunning drawing though! Love your work &lt;3
---
*playing legion

"op"

yep, it's big brain time
---
We're not certain when it's coming out but is should be soon. It might be during the blood rush event.
---
the game used to look more pretty tbh. I get the appeal of the newer look, but a big part of me really misses old dbds look.
---
My wife ran through the tutorial (she's not a video game player) and she started teabagging the npc killer that's behind that fence in the beginning. She said "This is what you're supposed to do right?" I laughed my ass off.

(No I don't teabag, she just sees that at the gates a lot when she watches me play)

The ranking system is just kind of fucked overall. Between smurf accounts, derankers and rank reset, it must be a nightmare being a new player. Then you have the fact that ranking up just takes playing enough games, and you get people at high ranks who are obviously out of their league. 
---
Then there‚Äôs queue times. I‚Äôm at red ranks on both sides and my queue times for survivor are so damn long at rank one (I‚Äôm on PS4). Deranking would probably help, but I have no interest in going against more inexperienced players. 
---
So while I don‚Äôt think deranking is healthy for the game and I don‚Äôt think people should do it, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the only or even biggest problem with the ranking system.
---
It's good if you play survivor mostly, I usually get 60k on a good game with it fully stacked. However BBQ still beats it, so i rarely ever take WGLF. I just play killer for my BP stacking and put those points into my survivors. Its basically just taking up a free slot for BP gain if you don't need that 4th slot.
---
If you eat it fast enough you basically have enduring.
---
"Play with thyself" charge time is halved when inside a locker

You were close, just slightly off and so the medium vault else you could have kept that loop going for a while. Sometimes so frustrating when you think you've lined it up eight but still get slapped with that medi-vault.
---
I think he meant to say sound effects and miss-clicked
---
Just level bill up
---
It's a counter to Borrowed Time when the hook is being crowded. It also makes defending hooks easier, since a smaller TR in chase means you can more easily "fake" a chase and just go back to the hook to down the rescuer or rescued.
---
It can also be used to cancel out the TR boost from Monitor &amp; Abuse, which can be useful on some setups. A smaller TR in chase means you can play a lot of mindgames, since it's very difficult for survivors to know if you're "really" chasing them or not.
---
For Legion it means the Deep Wound timer starts ticking down sooner, though the price you pay is that your Killer Instinct's tracking takes a big hit.
---
Aside from the TR aspect, Furtive Chase can be combined with Remember Me to very quickly build max stacks on the latter - 2 for the first Obsession, and 2 from the second Obsession when they unhook the first.
---
Probably because it was really loud.

 if you play survivor
---
- start with claudette, be prepared to get killed a lot while your learning. don't worry, things click into place the more you play.
---
If you play killer:
---
- It doesn't matter that much what your first killer is, because at high ranks survivors likely won't be that good anyways. That being said, I still recommend playing a killer that is considered 'meta'. You have the right idea with huntress, as she along with nurse and hillbilly are commonly considered the best killers in the game. Another thing, every character has three unique perks. At levels 30, 35, and 40 respecitve you can unlock them so they appear in the bloodwebs of other characters. Not all perks are created equal though, and here are the ones you should probaly get with dlc characters.

- buy hag so you can get Ruin and devour hope.
---
- buy leatherface so you can get bbq and chili. This perk will make the grind a little more bearable. 
---
-
---
I'm escaping the fact I have to make Nancy, Steve and Demadoge for you people in a few days.
---
I love random JoJo references
---
As a Dwight main I am already booking a plane ticket to cleanse it
---
in the PTB when freedy got reworked you would know if the pallet is fake or not if you get staggered from hugging it but they fixed it when it went live.
---
Save money buy making your own bones
---
Answer: it comes out when it's ready. Lets not rush the devs and force them to put out a half assed ptb
---
It was painful, I had no idea if it was a perk or something because I had just started
---
If you really want to run DH and Ruin at once, try replacing NOED with Thrill of the Hunt. 
---
DH only works if survivors aren‚Äôt prioritizing breaking totems, Ruin gives them a reason to run around breaking totems, Thrill lets you protect them.
---
He looks so pissed when he opens a locker
---
How long ago was it?
---
On what killer? 
---
And run whatever the fuck you want. I just had a match against extremely toxic survivors who called me racist shit in postgame chat and complained about me using an Ebony Mori while he had Decisive, Adrenaline, and Balanced Landing with a haddonfield offering. 
---
Fuck the survivors. The only build I see as Toxic is a "FUCK YOU" build explicitly designed to be as annoying as possible (Ruin, NOED, Rancor, Franklins)
---
Hahaha yes the animation on him is great.
---
who doesn't?
---
my two survivor mains lol
---
Those are the two characters I have all perks on. They look nice &lt;3
---
A lot of people underestimate how good dream snares are. Just spam the shit out of them all the time and close off loops. They're great and add a lot of pressure. It's saved me from getting looped on Freddy so many times.
---
this is so cursed
---
Eenope, I just have favorites. :D
---
Rancor and noed big brain
---
What if Dc's counted as mori's in addition to the disconnect bonus
---
This is probs me running around in school girl spirit and I love this. Just thought it‚Äôd be dope to kill some senpais tbh
---
//still confused myself tho
---
stop! stop! he's already dead!
---
I'd go in without thinking about it.
---
GET THEM POINTS!
---
Memorise the [scoring events](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodpoints) and act accordingly.
---
Hag is a fairly exceptional farmer due to being awarded BP for setting traps, triggering traps, and hitting survivors that triggered traps. 
---
There appears to be a common misconception that Doc is a good farmer - he only gets points for Shocking and for landing a hit after a Shock. Nothing is added for his Madness gimmick.
---
( reposted this 'cause it was too bright \^\_\^ my monitor was in game mode when i did it)
---
I support this idea
---
These icon packs are so cool. I  really wish BHVR would add some support through the steam workshop or something.
---
Yeah! Cause fuck you that's why! People hate NOED, and people HATE Rancor in particular because it's literally super-NOED that comes with a free mori! So when you hit the obsession it's as if you hit him with Quadruple NOED.
---
Great editing! I really liked it!  
---
Though I wonder why the timer didn't slow when Nea was downed or on the hook. Maybe it's something I don't know about.
---
I definitely got one. I have almost 3k hours in the game, i know Im not crazy. I believe the scoring event was called "Learned" or something similar. At first i thought they changed opening the exit gate to Survival.
---
In this particular game I opened both exit gates, and i got the event after opening the second one. When i escaped i was the last left in the game. It could have triggered because i opened *both* doors, but im thinking it could have triggered because I opened a door after being the last in the trail (teammates had just left before I finished opening second exit. 
---
But i definitely ended the game with 6500 survival points, and i didnt pull myself off hook. I dont think i got hooked at all this game.
---
You know. I feel so confused now. Because your comment made me wonder ‚Äúdid he actually go upstairs‚Äù and so I watched my own damn clip over and over and you were right. I didn‚Äôt even notice that he went upstairs. I thought he had backed up and hid by the stairs but you were right. I paid close attention to his red light and he definitely went upstairs. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Thanks for pointing that out to me üòÇ
---
I understood that reference!
---
Let's all be honest, this is one if not the best Scooby's Opening.
---
Sorry I must destroy your beautiful work. 
---
It has FREE BLOOD POINTS!!!

Lmao. Smart kid, goes for the slashers instead of going for fortnite
---
Sigh indeed.
---

... want Golden Wind...
---
Is that mobile dbd?
---
the something something is just a saying lol
---
Yep thats me baby
---
How to play an effective Legion? Just M1. That's how sad his power is.
---
Youtube? Twitch? LINK DAMNIT I WANNA SUB
---
of course, approximately 2% of survivors who tbag actually follow this rule
---
Well I'm no where near rank 7 as survivor so I might go for it :D
---
Why survivors need to purify totems ?
---
Why?
---
Dass guud
---
I'm the only thinking that animation of Demogorgon opening the locker looks a little awkward? Besides that everything else looks spot on :)
---
Well boys we didi it Gen Rush is no more
---
Isnt the stun 4 seconds?
---
Yeah I understand, it's just when I play survivor this is the games I get into, high killer then me rank 10 and rank 15-20 teammates.
---
I'd like some instructions as well!
---
I feel your pain, seriously. Our only hope is Dedicated Servers now. PS4 is in a horrible state overall.
---
I have never used decisive strike. I'm planning on taking it up now that it has been reworked. It is still a top-tier perk and very good. Now it's not just a scummy bullshit perk with no counter
---
Facecamping makes sense in exactly one context: when gate is powered and there's more than one other person alive. It makes absolutely no sense to do anything except camp the hook at this point, since good survivors will guarantee an unhook and getting a gate open.
---
All other usages of face camping are either people who don't understand why it isn't a good strategy, or people doing it intentionally to bother a specific person.
---
Don't worry about it. Play whatever perks you want
---
All killer perks can be used on all killers once you learn them from the person they're from at level 30, 35, and 40. Looking at their bio in game tells you who has what teachables if you dont want to look it up online. 
---
Not sure about where to look for metas, I guess just watch youtubers/streamers who arent doing sub builds or things like that. Generally the default meta build for like all killers is Ruin (Hag), Enduring (Hillbilly), Spirit Fury (Spirit), and BBQ (Leatherface). Each killer has their own meta but this is what most people throw on everybody if they want to do well.
---
Theres no dedicated servers right now on any platforms but theyre still planning on getting it put in before summer ends as far as im aware
---
Very nice my dude
---
I always play as if NOED and Adrenaline were in everyone's base kit. 
---
Always rushing the last gen for others who are injured or in a chase. 
---
Always doing all the bones.
---
Always trying to not over-slug with one gen left.
---
Always dropping the person I'm carrying when the last gen pops to strike them back down.
---
Play with your food is a great perk on slow killers like Hag or Mamochka. People usually underestimate Bubba and his chainsaw is incredibly deadly with PWYF. I would say it's the second-best perk in the shrine this week
---
I feel like 1&amp;3 would be used on Andy if they had a childs play dlc
---
Damn. Sorry I copied tho I didn't realize that I wasn't the first to realize the contextual power of this template.
---
Try doing that mid-chase when it's too late
---

---
I think it's because of the "zoom" you have selected. I bet you're not on 100%, you zoomed in to see better and that's what causes the issue (if i'm not wrong). Try selecting your screen resolution to 100%.

PD: Excuse my grammar.

He puts highlight games from his stream on youtube channel NotOtzdarva. Start from there, vods on twitch later, catch him live in the end.

---
Pretty much this, though Overcharge can be swapped with Ruin.
---
Then 3 out of 5 games it gets destroyed immediately anyway. 
---
So a mandatory perk basically becomes a wasted slot almost always anyway.  It's great!
---
As soon as I saw this post I loaded up DBD and bought diversion
---
Vocal percussion on a whole another level coming from my mind
---
Ceiling? Nah b
---
Walls? Heck yeah, that would be cool.
---
Until you have to factor in what is and isn't an acceptable place to put a portal on the wall, and some spots wouldn't make sense. (The killer puts a portal on the wall of the Killer Shack, how is he supposed to tunnel to another portal?)
---
Yes, it's a cool idea, but I don't think it's happening for a number of technical reasons.
---
The ceiling is a no because most of the time it's too far to do that anyways.
---
Guess we can tell what you main than.
---
Exhaustion perks like Lithe, Sprint Burst etc are good at creating distance between you and Myers- and since he can instadown at Tier 3, this is kinda what you wanna do.
---
Spine Chill doesn‚Äôt work against Tier 1 Myers, but it does against Tier 2 and 3; and since his terror radius is still fairly small in T2 (and can be made much smaller), Spine Chill can be very useful for alerting you that he‚Äôs watching.
---
Kind of. It's less effective on spirit, myers, huntress and hag yes but I actually meant Freddy, he has none while the survivor is asleep.
---

---
I wasn't using scratched mirror. You can hear me go back into tier 2 during this clip. However I was being real sneaky at the beginning of the match &amp; staying in tier 1 which is something I like to do when I get lery's &amp; am playing Myers.
---
Well, im not about to say your wrong about the shitty video
---
I don't really play killer as much anymore but I think it hypocritical that survivors hold killers to.such moral high standards yet they can tea bag at the exit gates and other toxic behaviour without the rulebook being dusted off.
---
I think I got secondhand stupid from that first one. Did they seriously imply that you shouldn't use your basic attack to damage them? And if you're someone like Billy you should only ever use your ability to? That type of mentality gets people stuck as rank 20-12 as a killer lmao.
---
Dem bones dem bones
---
Bruh. a lot of stuff has changed, and you only mentioned something that is an add-on.
---
I‚Äôm in this post and.... I‚Äôm cute
---
I'd be happy with it if we could lower our quality for more consistent fps. The amount of times a frame drop has made me miss as huntress, any melee killer and get hit as a survivor is a lot.
---
I always get the babies or the morons.
---
Damn... I didn‚Äôt know it was possible to miss a joke this bad...
---
Not groovy, didn‚Äôt Ash
---
Thanks for the Tip. But Unfortunetly i already bought the Hag with Iridescent Shards, what means i would pay 4 Euros for only Ace.
---
How tf is legion op
---
F U stands for fuck u.
---
Yeah, apparently I had to try to chainsaw them in the infinite inside Mother's Lament house, since they all ran there. The 90¬∞ angle chainsaw into a window must be something mandatory to be a "non-toxic" Killer.
---
Oh lol. I mean I can do that if I ever decide to sell this one and repaint another.
---
No but I wouldn‚Äôt put ruin and DH in the same build. Ruin encourages people to go look for it and chances are they will find yout totem firsf
---
Thanks bby &lt;3
---
I don't get the joke.
---
Idk I‚Äôve seen some questionable red rank survivors &amp; Killers
---
Dumbass that‚Äôs wraith there.

A slugger killer? That's rare, at least it's been a long while since a had a slugger killer, and I don't see people complaining about them here often.

Agreed. Thanks.

This is the peak of DbD memes.

ESPECIALLY IN LERYS!!
---
Two days ago me and my friend was playing against a wraith with those add ons in lerys and he was wearing the creapiest freaking cosmetic that I've never seen before (granted I don't buy killer cosmetics cause I'm too busy buying new characters with my Shards) but it was brown and had tree branches coming out of his face. Anyway, I was doing a gen with a Laurie and I thought everything was safe cause there wasn't even a lerys offering so I didn't think it was a stealth killer. I was looking around like normal and I looked the opposite way of the Laurie. Next thing ik I hear that loud ass gen pull sound "REEEE" and the creepy as wraith teleports behind me (I'm guessing it was just a result of the gen pull not a lag) and it scared the living hell outta me.. had to lay my controller down and put my head in my hands for a few minutes til I got unhooked to calm down lol.. got scared about 4 times after that xD.. Mikey never scares me that hard not does Pig/Ghosty
---
I'm new to Reddit plz explain

Could they be testing dedicated servers maybe? May as well get used to it since we're not getting one.

What is noed? I‚Äôm new to this game

‚ÄúBe sympathetic while I was afk for 4 minutes and ignore me completely‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs worse, the fact that you play doctor, or the fact that you have a sad try hard skin for him‚Äù

‚ÄúLol your so bad you couldn‚Äôt let one person through hatch XD nub‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you tunnel with dying light, so sad‚Äù for context on this one I was doing a Wraith ritual and hadn‚Äôt levelled him up to even level 30 yet

I take it you're a killer main then. Entitled much?

guys check it out

this guys got a huge cock
---
Wait till you get to rank 13 and higher than you can talk about killers being op
---
Can confirm, am red rank and just as good as my rank 12 friend
---
You racked your brain for over 15 hours thinking of an answer to my rhetorical question, and that's what you came up with? I gotta say; I'm not impressed.
---
You should do I tutorial video and inspire others! Because, me, myself, and I are highly inspired by this and want to make one too!
---
Literally every time in searching a chest and say, ‚ÄúPlease give me a key, PLEASE,‚Äù I get a broken key. WHY DBD GOD WHY.
---
No 80/20 survivor main. Good try though xx
---
Higher rank survivors would definitely juke the shit out of me but at lower tiers, kinda feels overpowered
---
I said she doesn‚Äôt have one, when you come out of her normal power she has a small speed boost. I will add the speed to Nurse I think that‚Äôs probably a good idea
---
Boys dont cleanse it, its haunted grounds
---
Agree, I posted this on the forums. 
---
Both killer and survivor.
---
Lol? Not saying I'm op, literally said i suck ass but sure go off
---
Also i like huge cocks up my bum, my cock's pretty average
---
Soon is trade marked?

Used to do this to my parents when I was little
---
I buffed EGC, did you even read what I wrote?
---
Have we decided on a new name for our group? No we‚Äôre still the Hookers
---
*Happy Otzdarva Noises*
---
Whats your name on the server I will ping you
---
How is it sarcastic when i annihilated a survivor team, but i suck ass at the game?
---
Don't say you wouldn't do the same if it was a survivor who kept taunting you the entire game.
---
Because this is dead by daylight... the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù game
---
That depends.  Do you plan to play them while leveling, or will you just be investing while playing other characters?
---
If you plan to play someone else, and Prestige as soon as they hit 50, then yes, stay cheap.
---
I agree but the only real balance change would be for the Exit Gates to trigger EGC. Better door RNG is also probably needed.
---
Myyyy word, ok pal, it‚Äôs clear you are either very very new to the game of very bad at survivor then. Playing survivor is brain dead easy at times. One good person on your team can carry you while as killer, it‚Äôs all on you. Killers bar top 3 (spirit, billy nurse) are so underpowered it‚Äôs laughable, hence why when you get out of your rank 16 you‚Äôll only see those 3.
---
Don‚Äôt think about what others think or say, especially not on this game.
---
Yes she‚Äôs very strong. Yes she‚Äôs annoying to play against(for me it‚Äôs mostly because of her passive phasing). But she‚Äôs definitely not impossible to play against, tbh I like playing against her, and have bullied my fair share of spirits.
---
I swear sometimes I run behind my injured teammates I would have gotten Bloodlust 2 as a a killer
---
Unlocks are at 30, 35, and 40.
---
Very recently I did actually. I sacrificed myself in End Game to save two other people. Got Mori‚Äôed by a Killer I didn‚Äôt recognize, and when I died I was in the Killer‚Äôs perspective leaving the play field after the other 3 survivors escaped. At the end of the dream the killer/me found a new group of survivors by the bonfire to chase. Then I woke up.
---
It was super vivid, really long, and also had more realistic of a look. I remember seeing a Nea, a Claudette and an Ace. The survivor I specifically sacrificed myself for was the Ace. I remember having this moment when I was on the ground in the dying state right in front of the exit gate. Claudette was helping Ace escape and had to pull Nea back from coming to save me. It was like the Walking Dead moment with Beth watching Noah escape the hospital, where she‚Äôs on the ground smiling. The Mori was brutal. Similar to Legion and Ghostface but different. And the Killer has no face or mask or distinguishing features.
---
Ds was just in there 2 months ago
---
I may be very stoopid, so thank you!
---
That actually does makes sense
---
I believe discord is one of those perks thats better at rank 1 than it is at 2 and 3. So he is actually being a huge tryhard especially by choosing to play Legion.
---
/s
---
I main huntress as killer since i‚Äôm really good as the momma
---
And for me it doesn‚Äôt get boring because long range hatchet snipes are truly satisfying
---
Before 8 AM PST and also after 12 AM I usually get more red ping killers
---
How much bigger do we need?  We have thousand and thousands of daily players.  On Steam alone we have 22k playing right now.  Console are most likely bigger
---
I'm still pretty bad at jukes and chases as survivor, but it's funny how i spent around 120 hours on survivor and barely 10 on killer and i feel a gap in playstyles. I'm not really a bad survivor because i can sort of make calls and i can sort of deal with certain situations, but I'm still average at best. I can juke nurse but I can never beat a Myers for example, he's too fast and once I'm exposed it's gg. I really need to get better because I'm sick of staying at Rank 16
---
I bought Leatherface a week before bbq got in the Shrine, and yesterday i bought the Hag for Ruin. and now there is Ruin in the Shop. wow.
---
Its a gag from the forums, as if Behaviour has Soon trademarked because its all they ever come out with whenever they get asked any question
---
*Blood warden has entered the chat.*
---
Do you still notice improvements in your gameplay or does it stop at some time.
---
Also might I ask which rank you are or you got as your highest because i get stuck at rank 10/9....
---
oh yeah you're right, I remember them saying the demogorgon would even get an alert when they start destroying the portal and the survs won't heat his heartbeat while destroying it
---
100k Minimum. Killer queues are already painful, splitting the playerbase across gamemodes will only make it harder to find games with the current playerbase that we have, mainly for Killers but Survivors too.
---
That's just my opinion anyway.
---
Lol the downvotes
---
Dbd is the only thing I run. My PC doesnt allow me to do that XD
---
Wow, very well made, so cool!! Great job dude! Clown and Myers are just perfect!
---
I improve all the time, even the smallest things I will learn to get better, like for the longest time I didn‚Äôt know hitting primary attack while winding a hatchet puts it away
---
And my highest rank is rank 9, but at that point, the game starts becoming not fun so I usually switch to survivor or take a break from the game until rank reset
---
Slippery Meat is the perk all the derankers and DC'ers should run. 
---
Seriously. If your just gonna fucking DC when you get downed anyway, let the killer hook you and just try to kobe. Also gives you a chance to use up all those awful Luck offerings collecting dust in your inventory.
---
I disapprove of this message
---
The Stranger things DLC could probably boost the player base.
---
I didn't say in this specific case.
---
The question is, would your team mate be happy or sad about you taking it?
---
Explain
---
yeah i know but i thought it meant ‚Äúcomplete a skillcheck to escape the killers grasp‚Äù then thought. i‚Äôm never going to complete the skillcheck :(
---
Oh man the irony behind this being said as an argument against killers
---
what if you wanted to avoid haunted grounds but nancy said it‚Äôs free health state
---
its really strong to fly through gens tho...And it definitley saves more than 6 seconds with 2 People working. Just stop the Time lol
---
This happened yesterday I was trying to learn Hag and this team of teabaggers almost genrushed me. I killed one of them and the other two escaped, the last one was a Meg who was close to the exit gate. I placed a trap at the far end of the gate and searched for the Meg. I found her hit her once and saw her rewch the exit gate she stood there and teabagged until I activated my trap teleported behind her and downed her.
---
It felt really good.
---
I have a feeling it would get destroyed in the mail :(
---
Yeah, I do that all the time. Was he on Xbox?
---
On Xbox you can do a NAT Test while in a match to quit without losing pips, bloodpoints and even keeping your item. I always run a Ranger medkit with charges addons and NAT test if I'm on death hook
---
It be like that sometimes
---
To hell with fake pallets... They never shoulda been added.. damn things...
---
I play both sides and as killer I don't try to pip and instead play to be unfun so that I can make survivors salty. I play Spirit with annoying addons (no prayer beads because I don't bully low ranks) and as LF I camp and slug. I always let Dwights go tho. Anything for a Dwight &lt;3
---
Shoot me a message id be more than happy too! Totems for everyone!
---
There usually is. I dunno why there isn't any in this clip
---
Uhhh
---
I hate this feeling so much
---
Of course!
---
Thank you!!
---
Little bitches, the lot of them. Everyone knows killers complain way more than survivors though (about legitimate in-game things) and have way more influence in the direction of the game. Killers act like the game needs to be built around their needs and will complain the second an exciting or useful perk comes out.
---
But anyone complaining about flashlights or 'teabagging' is being a sore loser - and the way this sub acts like that is an acceptable norm is completely laughable.
---
Tunelling, camping - all legit strategies, just bad for the killer (and maybe that 1 survivor). Mori's? I mean c'mon, we don't encounter them too frequently, and really, what is so bad about being killed by a killer.
---
I can send you the directions on how to make it if you'd like! Maybe I could do a YouTube tutorial eventually haha
---
Franklins is trash. 
---
If you really want to counter flashlights just run Lightborn and completely ignore them. Or just dont be a potato and use the endless in game counter play to them.
---
This is a perfect representation. NEA I HEARD YOU OVER HERE, WHERE DID YOU GO?
---
Trap cloud: cloudette
---
Yes please :D
---
[He's just imitating](https://imgur.com/a/L1bbFbq)
---
Forget Nurse and Spirit. Level 1 Legion is the new meta
---
Lightborn is better then Franklins at countering flashlights. Franklins is trash.
---
Steve: has perks that promote helpong others and in return have them passively help you while you're in a dire situation 
---
Nancy: will expose all of you for one health state
---
I main plague and this situation happened to me couple of times. When I caught some dumb idiot t-bagging in front of the exit and I downed them, I usually take them, hook them and I puke on them over and over and over until the game is finished. I don't give a flying fuck about the rest. They can have their escape. This one deserves puke.
---
Why are the survivors covered
---
&gt;Fuck that ur a killer. Go hard
---
Wish more of the community was like this man.
---
SoonTM isnt a behaviour joke, first time I saw it was from riot games nearly a decade ago, a lot of companies use it.
---
So? Not a problem if you arent racist.
---
I wouldn't say that makes them useless.  It's not very hard to get out of madness
---
ok what is this this show
---
not that long ago if we look at ace's jacket (these cosmetics were released a week ago)
---
I only camp hooks with an insidious basement leather face :)
---
Absolutely nothing.
---
&gt;I‚Äôd propose a time penalty of 10 (?) minutes if you‚Äôre the first player to leave a match before you may return to the queue to find another match. Still, maybe somebody has a better idea.
---
A prompt to kick a survivor in the face if he tries to unhook me with the killer 3 feet away. It just means I get immediately hooked again. 
---
Definitely didn't just get hooked, unhooked, rehooked, unhooked and knocked down then rage quit...
---
Oof indeed
---
Well, you've just admitted to being a toxic sore loser. I'm looking forward to the Dedicated Servers even more now.
---
Im Romanian and those videos are in Romanian. Just an off-topic thought
---
Doctor. Checkmate.
---
Not bad for $5 good job!
---
it seems like they don't even know when it's coming out. maybe they found out about some gamebreaking bugs they wanna fix first
---
The key is using it in an area where the killer‚Äôs line of vision is blocked and also making sure you stop running when your dance with me is in cooldown, otherwise you‚Äôll leave scratch marks.
---
In this clip the killer wouldn‚Äôt had to break the pallet or go around to descend the stairs and he would not have seen any immediate scratch marks so he probably gave up.
---
Honestly the combo is hard to use especially against high rank killers who predict survivor movements really well. Also when you are injured it‚Äôs hard too, but when it works it feels so good.
---
Anyone know if this would work on ps4? Asking for a friend lol.
---
No, but in all seriousness it's just to get some perspective on the constant disconnections that occur. Plus all those red ranks that are terrible at the game would make a lot more sense now
---
Corn blindness is a real issue

I always just follow the scratch marks and don't have an issue. Although it seems easy to lose killers in there as a survivor, especially if you can 360.

If the gates are powered and they‚Äôre on the hook, not camping is as good as just letting them go.

A good idea is to know how large your killers lunge is, timing your swings is key. Lunge around corners, mind-game a little bit, make your movements unpredictable it allows you to be more free with how you chase and manage time/objectives more easily. 180/360ing is common and there is no realistic counter to it unless your a god at 360 swings. For survivor look up ‚Äúdbd common loops‚Äù they will teach you how to run jungle gyms and to keep the killer occupied as long as possible, such as strategies, perk builds, etc. That‚Äôs all I got on my end.

Don‚Äôt ever double back when being looped. Don‚Äôt respect pallets either. Just chase and chase and force them to throw the pallet. Then break it. Run enduring and spirit fury and you never have to worry about survivors looping you. If you find survivors using t walls too much run bamboozle. I see too many low rank killers respecting pallets allowing me to just keep running around the same pallet forever. And then once I stun them they try and bloodlust but I just stay at the pallet and force them to break it anyways. Just force it down break it and move on. It wastes a lot of time but in the grand scheme of things it saves time because once all the pallets are broken chases last only a few seconds.
---
What if survivors are actively running around the hook?
---
$15?!
---
There‚Äôs no way to counter bnps and insta heals (unless you use franklins which isn‚Äôt a good perk). There‚Äôs also no way to counter keys except franklins which is a bad perk
---
I agree, I‚Äôm a console player anyways, so it doesn‚Äôt affect me too much, I just figure that the sooner the PTB lands, the sooner I can get hands on the update. 
---
The fact that a double BP weekend is landing BEFORE the bloodweb buffs hurts me just a bit
---
I would say maining one killer is effective when you start out so that you learn how the game functions as quickly as possible instead of playing new killers and worrying about how to use their powers. Then slowly branching out to new killers, getting their teachables and choosing a few killers you like the most. My few are pig, hag and spirit so I play them by far the most and occasionally play others for a break.
---
Why is it a problem they're Japanese... this is just screaming racism even if it's not intended. You shouldn't care what nationality your teammates/opponents are in a game where you don't need to speak with them.
---
That's exactly why you're camping it. Try to bait them into going for an unhook that they think is possible and kill them. Altruistic survivors will do some pretty stupid things.
---
No. You are supposed to sprint to the other side of the map for no reason. You should know this.
---
Seriously, I'll lunge at someone as Freddy while they have the blue outline that SHOULD help me see them better, but sike. I actually lunged at a bunch of corn and they're running the opposite direction of me before I ever realized it, then I lose them and curse the cornfields for existing.

Don't care.

Is that confirmed?

This should be an easy ban.

By main you only/mostly play that character.

---
A mind game is a 50/50 situation. I don't know where people keep pulling "skill" out out of their ass. All it is is a situation that forces you to think. Instead of running your 97th loop on autopilot.
---
That's me but with Legion. I bought the DLC cuz I liked Legion's concept and also Jeff's perks seemed cool. I played a few games with Legion, but the killer queues are way too long imo. I ended up becoming a survivor main and I play Meg most of the time
---
r/usernamechecksout
---
I switch between my mains, Myers, Billy, and Clown
---
it never really gets boring to me.
---
And I can't play survivor, so I main killer
---
I got it too, it‚Äôs not impossible xoxoxo
---
I disagree. Spirit just had a high skill cap in my opinion . A better player will make her same op if they play her a lot. Someone who isn‚Äôt very good with her or killer is not going to dominate.
---
To elaborate, the question the OP had is 
---
&gt;I mean is it effective to main on Killer?  
---
That's not an easy question to decipher.  Effective to what?  Win games, gather BP, have fun?  I should have been more clear in my response, though.
---
Apologies, I didn't list this specific scenario because it was the most obvious one. I thought it didn't need explaining though perhaps I was wrong.
---
The 2-year long queues would turn into 3-year long queues.
---
Nice work!
---
Great job but what really caught my interest is the fact that while on console, this achievement was completed by 0.1%, I just checked the Steam achievements and it says 9.1%. That's a huge difference.
---
"You're like Hitler, but even Hitler cared about Germany, or... Something."
---
Also never use League of legends as a good example for lore, especially their many, many, many, many rewrites. I think Jace alone has been rewritten like 7 times. The first rewrite was needed, because it looked like a fanfiction written by a 7 year old, but after that, ????
---
If you think someone is near or went into hiding check behind objects or search through the grass (whispers would also help)
---
TBH if I‚Äôm getting looped by someone who‚Äôs Good, I bail. They are both better than me and will waste my time. I‚Äôd rather find a weaker target. 
---
I‚Äôve found also if you ignore the good baiters, they will ignore gens to get bolder and bolder until they get too close and make a mistake. Or they waste their time hopping a vault to get your attention.
---
I'm PS4 too and the only messages I ever get are people actually telling me GG as the Killer. I DON'T camp and feel like I show each survivor "attention" lol I try to make it fun but there's been a few I've sent not-so-nice messages when they camp or tunnel. I get if all the Gens are popped but...not w/ 5 Gens 45 seconds into the game smh
---
Exactly why I said it ‚Äúshould‚Äù be. I never said you would get banned, only that you should be banned.

You'll get more points going after one of them chasing them and letting the unhook happen than you would just standing there with everyone going ''Oh what do we do? What I do? Oh god. What's happening here?" 
---
It might seem like a stupid decision, but letting the unhook happen and downing someone else to hook them not only grants you more points, but it applies even more pressure even if you've lost the other hook because you've gotten the pressure back instantly.
---
Good. That's what you get for (most likely) trying to loop a spirit. Next, tell me how much fun you had trying to pallet stun a blinking nurse or window meme'ing tier 3 Myers.
---
The amount of people who trash the spirit without playing her is too damn high. Prayer Beads are your **only** legit complaints. Everything else is just potato rank survivor bitching, because red ranks have no issue dealing with me when I play her. Not every killer can be fought the same way. Either adapt or lose.
---
"u got me cause you spammed stalk"
---
When you see people near completed gens, how are they moving?  Fast, or slow.  Left, or right?  Don't go to the gen, try to estimate where they are going, instead.
---
Bad day?
---
If you would, how much would you charge to make one for another person?
---
That's ridiculous...That dude should feel REALLY embarrassed! "I have one perk..." HAHAHAHA priceless!!!
---
The reason is because Bill has been out on PC for a while as have his achievements. Due to the EGC being implemented it is almost impossible to get this now but PC players have had years to be able to unlock the achievement.
---
So cheap because skulls real and not bought?
---
Fair. :)
---
I was waiting for him to hook someone else and trigger bloodwarden
---
Too bad most people don't understand what a power role is, and want survivors/killers to be equal.
---
I had a similar question to OP, but is the targeting on ranged (thinking huntress) unforgiving on controller? I seem to take corners wide with mouse/keyboard and would like to loop more efficiently.  But the killer I am preferring in limited play time is huntress.
---
Hit-detection is currently "client-side" because one of the two "clients" is actually the server host (killer). There is no reason why in a dedicated server environment, hit-detection could not be done on the remote server. There are a lot more time-sensitive and precise games that have no issues with server-side hit-detection. Besides, even with client-side detection, you are assuming if the killer sends an "I landed a hit" packet, and the survivor an "I avoided a hit" one, that the killer input takes priority over the survivor input, but there is also no reason why that would be true. For a dedicated server, the input that arrives first takes priority and is ruled valid, and both clients can run hit detection - that's just like it is currently, only that killer inputs always arrive on the server instantly because the killer's PC is the server, therefore having a flat, whole latency period advantage over survivors. In a dedicated server setting on the other hand, survivor inputs could arrive earlier than killer inputs. And then there is also lag compensation, which would roll back server time calculatively according to a data packet timestamp, and apply respective results.
---
Again, all of this is done in games that are faster and more precise than DbD, so I don't know why you think in DbD they would code in an inherent prioritization of the killer client's inputs over the survivor client's.
---
Insane as in capital I insane. As in Eldritch lovecraftian insanity.
---
Tell that to all the survivors exploiting infinite haddonfield and other structures that still exist in the game.   But I guess exploits only matter when a killer is the one exploiting.  Must have missed that page in the survivor's rulebook for killers.
---
Please don't spread misinformation.  If you have a source for this, provide it.  Otherwise, stop guessing.
---
Speaking as a PC player, stay on console. No point in buying all the DLC twice just to be subjected to cancerous end game chat messages. The frame rate might be better, but when I play with my roommate on console I require a lot less chemotherapy after a game.
---
Oh I see. I didn't know that, I'm quite a new player tho. D:
---
Shhh Hide!
---
Camping is defined as hooking someone and then standing there. Hooking someone, walking away, and walking back when you see someone try to unhook isn't camping.
---
I'm referring to facecamping.
---
It's free real estate.
---
Its four fucking dollars. They literally added the price another character.
---
I literally made a video about those perks a few days ago. Bring a Toolbox with 2 hook break addons. Go to a generator. Destroy nearby hooks. Easy escape if the Killer downs you there.
---
Flip Flop. Boil Over, Unbreakable, Decisive Strike. Unbreakable and DS have great synergie and you will have a big chance to escape the Killers grasp at least once per game. I recorded 3 matches and I could escape in every game at least once or twice, depending if the Killer respects DS or not.
---
agreed
---
They fuckin call every character toxic, I used to get bullied post game chat or in game if I was Claudette or Laurie.
---
\&gt;screams complaining about Japanese people and saying he hates Japan
---
\&gt;"This isn't a racial issue"
---
thank you! &lt;3
---
The game is fun. there is a learning curve as any game.
---
have you tried dota? The learning curve on that game is insane, but once you pass it, it is so much fun. There are toxic people in every game. If you feel like you might like this game, just push thought it a bit and learn some of the perk and mechanics. This game can be loads of fun whether you play survivor or killer. Just have a tough skin, water off a ducks back.

As a survivor main who plays a lot of swf who know what we‚Äôre doing, id say the most annoying killer perks are ruin and franklins, sloppy butcher and nurses calling works great together too
---
He should have put down some more dream snares, thats not nearly enough
---
I like it but one fix. Make the new killer the wendigo and the killer costume cosmetic upgrades for an established killer. Anyone else have any thoughts?
---
I honestly hadn't even considered it since I was just making one for fun! I had a couple people ask though I would have to think on it!
---
There's an adopt a player program going on right now to help show newbs the ropes.  Details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cw7hwo/adoptadweet/
---
Matchmaking in this game is awful, mostly because of SWF - Survive with Friends.  A high rank player can pair with a low rank player, and end up against a low rank killer, such as your Doctor game.  When you solo queue, it's luck of the draw, if you'll end up with an organized team or a bunch of potatoes.
---
As a new killer, you will suck.  You need to learn alot.  When to quick swing, when to lunge, when to keep on a chase, when to break a chase, when to rotate, where to path.
---
If you listen to the toxic asshats who tell you to quit, you'll be missing out.  If you can ignore their bullshit, we'll be glad to have you in the fog.
---
Play survivor to learn how killers mindgame

yes but it's literally every lobby. It should try to match me with people near me, but instead it directly goes to japan every time and it kills me

Well if you make a decision or come up with a price, I'll be first in line :)
---
Ive played smite, and dota and HOTS. each of those however had plenty enough low level people that starting out i wasnt going against people far higher.
---
you wouldnt expect to play your first hour of dota going against people against legend+ ranked players.
---
The Entity is kind of eh. I like it to a degree, but I also think it takes licensed killers like Freddy and Michael kinda makes them into jokes.
---
There's a guy who has a realm of his own where he can gleefully murder any kid in a number of ways that he wants, but he just is whipped into serving someone else in another realm that limits his power? Okay, sure whatever. 
---
And then there's been literally installments upon installments and comics and adaptions that show controlling him or attempting to is always a mistake.  The only good scene of Halloween 6 is just where he just straight up plays the Cult and murders them all.

thanks, ill check it out.

All racism starts with reasoning like that.
---
Teaparty republicans don't hate black people because they're black, they hate them because of 'crime rates'. Hitler didn't hate jews because they were jewish, he hated jews because he blamed them for Germanys fall.
---
What you're spouting is racism.
---
Send me a message and I'll give you the instructions!
---
Did you read that article? Lag compensation is not "a fancy way of saying" "the client decides if a shot hits, and the server decides when a shot hits." Lag compensation is the server determining where the players were when the shot was fired so that it can decide if the shot hit. The end result is that you don't have to lead targets. The downside is that if your ping is high enough you seem to get shot through walls. As a player, you can't tell the difference between client-side and server-side hit detection with lag compensation. Unless you try to lag switch, which just makes you rubberband when you turn it off.
---
I'm not aware of any FPSes with dedicated servers that use client-side hit detection. It's unnecessary and insecure.
---
Next weekend, 9/5 - 9/9.
---
lol you fucking lunatic
---
how's the basement today?
---
Send me a message so I can find you again easily!
---
all u can do is die and repeat, thats the only way to improve. and learn how to loop killers, ez wins
---
That is a good idea too!
---
I have like 600 hours and i would recommend you find your playing style (most likely doing gens and being more of a hiding person in the beginning) and main one character for the beginning
---
Additionally to what u/zadeyboy said, if you don't feel like leveling up a killer to get their teachable perks (being able to use that killer's perks on other killers) do keep an eye out for the Shrine of Secrets. The Shrine updates every week on Tuesdays, and it offers four perks: two killer perks and two survivor perks. You can buy those with iridescent shards and perks usually cost around 2,000 shards. BBQ was on the Shrine just this week and it's a rare perk to be on there, but I've found other useful perks as well.
---
Regarding endgame perks, HybridPanda (a well-known DBD Youtuber) often runs Blood Warden (Freddy perk), which blocks the exit gates if you hook a survivor after one of the gates has been opened. You could also run No One Escapes Death (I think this one's a generic one. It appeared early on the bloodweb for by Trapper, and he was the first killer I leveled up), which lets you insta-down people after the last generator has been powered. As a beginner myself, it's been really useful.
---
First, you need to have patience. You will get better the more you play, because you will always lose your first match. If you plan on playing doctor, be like him and ‚Äúlaugh it off‚Äù. His power is one of, if not the, most complicated powers in the game, even with no add ons. Learn to time the shock, how far it will reach, and the area it will effect, because it is not instant. Go on YouTube and watch tips on basic chases, and specific videos for the killer you want. The doc punishes confidence when in the right hands, as no one can hide, and no loop is never ending. A tip right now, pallets are temporary solutions, it‚Äôs the vaultable windows that keep a chase going. As for survivor, YouTube is all I can say, because I‚Äôm terrible. Good luck and have some fun!
---
That and every player with PS+ owns DBD, and not alll of them play it
---
But that is not 100% confirmed yet, at least not by BHVR.
---
Because he knows you are running a distraction build because you made it too obvious, and so he's going after targets that are working on gens?
---
&gt;A competent red rank survivor can punish you for a lot longer than 15 seconds with a D Strike. 
---
Please, take a second, and actually pay attention to the logic I'm presenting. Good survivors take awhile to catch, yes. So DS will buy them some time. If that same survivor was healthy, you would have to catch them twice anyway. I'm sorry if this really simple logic doesn't penetrate.
---
&gt; They run you for multiple gens while you tunnel vision them mindlessly chasing that 1 hp survivor while the other 3 just bang out gens uninterrupted.
---
A chase is a chase. Explain the difference between "mindlessly chasing" a 1hp survivor while the other three do gens, and chasing a healthy survivor while the other three do gens.
---
Pretty groovy üòé
---
As an Ace main, I approve, but that huntress totally already threw a hatchet into his back.
---
I'm surprised I'm not seeing "Motherfucker, I just bought hag yesterday" posts xD
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a lag switch.
---
Holy shit its perfect
---
You're a racist.
---
New Freddy has play with thyself
---
this game has a STEEP learning curve, and subpar matchmaking. Its a tough hill to get over when you first pick it up. But as someone with 400 hours, it gets real fun once you learn the language.
---
&gt; I remember Shattered Memories being... weird. Nothing made sense the first time I played it
---
To be fair, that is par for the course with pretty much every Silent Hill (with the possible exception of Downpour).
---
Nah, this guy's just making dates up. Truth is we don't know when the PTB will be yet.
---
Yeah I like that idea a lot I don‚Äôt know the killers too well
---
Dont have to worry about ds if you don't tunnel :/
---
this is superior, you should make game sprites from this!
---
you realize they are adding the archives to tell stories that they cant during normal gameplay aka survivors and (maybe) killers interacting

If the wiki is trolling us, I'm gonna be very sad.

Oh so its not my tv that is broken? Yeah... i miss the bass line that plays at the start of a match.

When it happened it gave me a message like "check your account/sign in again" while I was in the middle of a game.
---
no, i just don't like the fact that fucking japanese CUNTY WHORES are fucking taking over my goddamn APAC servers and i can't play because of it.
---
Ignore them, the fact that you killed three of them with nurse is respectable. If they were so much better they would've all escaped easily, but they didn't. You did damn good.

I use bbq on most killers and if I dont see any auras or only 1 really far away I will pretend to leave hook and come back to see them unhooking. This usually come with some salt

I once got tunneled and moried my a Clown just because I had the Ashy Slashy cosmetic.

Daphne is the first non athlete meg outfit and Velma is thicc ass jane I guess. Scrappy doo is the new killer and Scooby appears in all the Perk icons since he couldn't make it into the actual game

They kept rescuing each other so I just had to trick themtl think I had left and then immediatly chase them

Do you not see the rank difference and the problem with boosting in this game?

Maybe I'm a noob but what's a smurfing?

Sick drawing, are you gonna be doing all the killers? Because I like your style and would definitely wanna see how they'd look.

His portals don't tunnel, they lead into the upside down and he travels to the other portal through that. Similar to traveling through the nether in Minecraft
---
Awe LOL right? I stopped wearing my dark Claudette school outfit because I‚Äôd get tunnelled and the killer would shake his head at me while camping me on hook and then I‚Äôd find out why in post game chat. It‚Äôs because this game attracts young petty people I think.

I have a question about Pebble.

Does the pebble effectively go through walls, or does it "hit" the wall in confined spaces?

Nice. Know what next weeks art project is gonna be now.

Yeah Huntress with controller is going to be a lot harder unless you're really good at FPS on a controller already so you know how to flick shots around and aim really well... Might want to just get used to M+Kb if you plan on playing Huntress.
---
Ok
---
I once played like 4 games in a row where I didn't use dream pallets so I forgot about using the ability altogether. Only after the last 2 games started going pretty bad did I start to wonder why.

Maybe?

That's like saying you have a coffee machine and asking if you can use K-Cups.  If you want an answer, you have to give the specs of the equipment you are using.

Or, you could just drop the 10 bucks and take a chance.  Games on sale over on Humble Bundle for Steam.  https://www.humblebundle.com/store/search?sort=bestselling&amp;search=dead%20by%20daylight

Well it's either this or toxic survivors hold the game hostage and bully a killer they're far better than. Most people prefer this. You might be the exception but a lot of people abused not being forced to leave.

It's time

Then say welcome to a new wave of DC'ing, facecamping, tbaggers

you're one of like *maybe* 3 people in the world who found that fun

That's because the killer closed the hatch. Once the hatch closes the gates get powered

Welcome, everyone. Don't be discouraged from having fun when guys like this harass you in the end game chat. Learn the game at your own pace.

I think the limitations are mostly in place to keep Behavior's focus relatively tight and the scope of the game fairly narrow. It's not as though the lore has prevented some great fan content like the Samination parody series or tons of talented artists, comic writers, etc. on here.

I‚Äôm not kidding you. Use your head. Adapt. Find kinks in their armor and abuse them. You need to study them to see how they act, what their playstyle is, how they mindgame, how they think, etc. Quitting teaches them that what they‚Äôre doing is funny and easy. If you still fail, that‚Äôs fine. As long as you put effort in and actually try instead of leaving your teammates to die, then that‚Äôs fine.
---
yeah that would be indirect nerf to him it would be cool if he was kinda stealthy it would be cooler if it was built into his kit  make him stealthy but not at the same time since he has standard killer stats

Watch atreamers; watch how they loop and chase. That increased my rank tremendously when I realized it's more than just 'run circles'; some loops are safe and can be run infinitely unless you mess up -others are one or two times around, and bolt.

Chasing works the same way. It's not just about following the survivor; learning when to go around versus when to break the pallet/through the window, mind gaming... it's all a part of it.
---
And watching others do it, seeing their mistakes, what works for them, is at least a good starting point, rather than continual de-pipping trying to learn
---
Well, yeah, but DCing generally has a negative connotation to it, unlike disconnecting. This might just be how I think, too.
---
I just ignore those people when I play killer. I also never send hate to killers as a survivor, unless they intentionally target me every time I go against them - which is a bannable offense.
---
I've played since the Pig dropped and these are just my observations... I'm also a solo player and I consider myself fairly skilled, Spirit is my ONLY issue with the game, the way she plays is not healthy for the game. She is broken. I'm sick of these "swf" bullshit every time I post about legit issues. The game should not be tailored for killers to have a chance against SWF, but sadly... It kinda is, and that just puts players like me at a massive disadvantage.
---
Having add ons that completely remove the only way of detecting her is crazy, you already don't hear her using her ability whilst in her terror radius. At least with Wraiths 'no sound' add on you can still see him and hear his loud ass footsteps. People saying "but her footsteps are still there" are insane too, cause when you hear those it's already too late - they are not as loud as Wraiths, but maybe they should be. Prayer beads needs a negative affect. It is too strong.
---
Killers should not need to be OP to be viable.
---
OP looks more like a smurf than anyone else lmao
---
Nancy is cool too :&lt; I kinda wanted Joyce more but that's okay too &lt;3
---
Yeah well, it'a not so much being forced to leave when the doors are open as it is the killer being able to force the game to end whenever he wants when there's one person left.
---
Well, obviously. He's hot af
---
Everyone with more than like 50 h in game would be ‚Äúrank 1‚Äù and then the matchmaking system wouldn‚Äôt work at all. 
---
 Unless you made it so ‚Äúrank 1‚Äù is just something it told you to make you feel better and then matchmaking was based on things that we‚Äôre displayed to the player.
---
&gt;they absolutely can do what they want, they bought the game. But for the sake of the community everyone should *want* to avoid behavior that is just BM.
---
Which is a bit ridiculous if you ask me. That just means the killer can force-end the match whenever he wants when one guy is left.
---
Well I‚Äôm a little confused... the way your game would have played out without end game is you would of had to repair two generators before even being able to spawn the hatch that certain death at least this way you have a slim chance of survival
---
Mmmmmm mmmmmm *rubs stomach*
---
(THWACK).....‚ÄùI‚Äôm gayyyyyy‚Äù
---
You kinda have to understand if they don't close the hatch, they're gonna assume the one survivor will gun it for the hatch, you're probably one of the very few that wouldn't and they don't know that at all, all they're concerned with is getting the gates powered so they can catch you at one for a 4k.

When I play survivor: Ruin lasts for at least 3 gens, none of my teammates hit skillchecks

When I play killer: Ruin barely lasts and every survivor is suddenly a skillcheck god

r/foundthemobileuser
---
I mean the exhaustion will only last 3 seconds after you get off the gen.
---
And I'm also assuming it will last 3 seconds after the gen gets above 50%.
---
I don't think vigil will make that much of a difference
---
As a killer main, I fucking obliterate anyone who hook bombs without borrowed time. The second I catch someone trying to snatch those points, they're dead any time I see them.
---
Can we get rid of rank reset please?
---
&gt;they absolutely can do what they want, they bought the game.
---
My boyfriend is having the same problem. He also tried he Doctor for his first killer and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea at all. He requires a good bit of game knowledge to play effectively and get kills. I‚Äôm a survivor main, rarely playing killer. Just trust me when I say.. ignore the toxic people. Seriously, I know it can be extremely frustrating but look at it this way, when you do get better at the game, you can severely punish the toxic asshole survivors/killers. Let them teabag at pallets and laugh at them when you catch them off guard. Just don‚Äôt play into the toxicity and try not to let it get to you. This game is so fun once you get the hang of it. It does have a lot of bullshit that comes with it, but to me, it‚Äôs completely worth it when you make those clutch plays.
---
If you got more points than the Survivor who escaped you completely
---
Since when did you pay for the maps?
---
If you get more points than the Survivor who escaped you won completely

That's unfortunate, now I'm big sad..

Iron side has a bronze gaming laptops check them out

Thank you! And YES! Ahahahaha  
---
No but really I try to keep all my shit what you would call at least high quality. I always do my best to make it as good as it can be.
---
Definitely a bug probably caused by connection issues. I was playing with my friend on American servers (im aussie)
---
I don't actually think you are; just looking at the loadouts if I had to pick a smurf it would be you is all.
---
Nea be on crack rn xD she def the killer, legion the one who needs to be running xD
---
Him: Noob camper
---
Him pathetic
---
Me: How am I camping? All 4 of you stay next to the hook. Learn to play.
---
Me: Pathetic
---
Him: Camper your pathetic you know it your right next to the hook. Your too bad too play decent haha you sad. 
---
Me: I'm right next to the hook because all 4 of you are literally right next to it. Go cry some more. 
---
Him: you was crap end of story baby
---
Me: Baby? lol. I beat YOU
---
Him: You camped
---
Him: not cool
---
Me: Whatever kid
---
Him: Your too young too play this game go play fortnite
---
Me: You can't even use the right "your" kid. It's "YOU'RE"
---
Him: The whole team said your worse spirit they come across you go cry a river
---
Him: Not its not you idiot its your
---
Him: Aw baby killer
---
Me: I'm the worst spirit and your trash trash SWF still lost. go cry.
---
Him: Can't leave his hook.
---
Him: were good  but you cheated
---
Him: You camped i bet you camp at every game. its sad there is other ways lil kid
---
Him: im not wasting my time on you lil skool kid get back to class.
---
You scumbag killer, you broke rule #4,684 of the Survivor Rulebook for Killers: When hooking a survivor, the killer must stand in a corner on the other side of the map.
---
Love me some Hot Fuzz
---
rank doesn't mean anything in this game ;/
---
Literally camps &gt; how am I camping? 
---
How fucking braindead are you my dude.
---
There is a chance of have the music of the pig in the game? This song https://youtu.be/vhSHXGM7kgE
---
It can bee awesome have it when you have a trap or in a chase
---
Oh I already do that. I watch Hybridoanda and Monto and sometimes Truetalent.
---
In this situation, the killer already killed the other 3 people so imo the remaining survivor should be the one who has to really work for it. It looks like you think the last person should just be able to waltz out
---
Where are you getting human skulls for that cheap? My dealer charges like $50 a piece!
---
Well, with no hostile intent meant, your preferred playstyle is partially what drove BHVR to have the EGC be what it is.
---
At that point the game is already over, there's no reason for it to drag on for another 10+ minutes. Especially on some maps where if the killer doesn't have Whispers, the game could technically never end if the survivor was spiteful enough. Also there's the bonus of no more hatch stand offs.
---
I wasn't fucking camping, whenever I hooked someone, their whole SWF would sprint straight for the hook, I'd down another, repeat.
---
But he earns it by killing the other 3 survivors in a sense. The killer did their job, it's not their fault if people DC. Best to move on to the next match as quick as possible.
---
Let me see it after it's done!
---
This is not smurfing. They just wanted to play with friends. You have noed on nurse, that‚Äôs more than enough to deal with a few green ranksü§î.
---
Fiiinnaaalllyyyyy. Gonna go straight into da shop!
---
You should check out some videos on her she has so much potential that‚Äôs it‚Äôs insane. Not as much as nurse ofc but close. My favorites usually involve faking out with her husk by using its rather weird properties like the fact it can hide her phase sounds and still moves like her when she‚Äôs phasing.
---
For newer players here: please dont listen to this guy, run ruin if you want to stand a chance at red ranks.
---
Other ranks tho yea you can get away with no ruin.
---
I find it hard to believe you actually got downed right before the exit... Your video is cut to literally include no context before the pickup. So you either got sandbagged by the meg or you got served for standing at the gate. However I guess I could be wrong and maybe you did get hit right there but its very unlikely in my eyes.
---
As if you already didn't have to work for it? Before you either had to repair two generators and make it to the hatch or get all five and use a door. Now you can hide and wait for three people do die and b-line it to the hatch.
---
You should‚Äôve put spirit in the DON‚ÄôT SCARE ME tier

Haunted grounds ;)
---
&gt; all but guaranteeing him a free, no effort kill.
---
Except for the effort involved in getting the first 3 kills but okay. Look at it from this point of view, in this scenario what has occured:
---
* The survivors have failed their objective of completing 5 generators
---
* The last survivor has failed to find the hatch before the killer
---
* The last survivor has failed to open a door without being detected. 
---
It's not so much handing the killer a free kill, it's more just denying the losing team any more 2nd chances.
---
Main is plague/spirit - claudette , PSN is my reddit name add me :)
---
Getting a free kill because three of the four people were terrible or DC'ed is not a good gameplay mechanic.
---
You didn't even see the game, nor do you known if it was face or proxy you fucking stick of melted butter

I typed it exactly as he typed his messages.

but wouldn't op have smurfed himself? rank 18 with tier 3 bbq and mori on a non bubba?

To help others escape
---
Thier is a similar one with ruin that has the effect of regression the generator completely if you hit a good skill check, might have been patched tho
---
Now I want that killer
---
Most of the time by loading in the killer has already broken a few rules, the number required should be increased, by a lot.
---
No it‚Äôs not IIRC the archive and the rift are different. Every archive comes with a rift and the rift is the battle pass. Archive will be a bunch of challenges that give you bloodpoints,shards,charms,lore movies, and possibly auric cells. All archives can be done at anytime, and the rifts will be limited time only.

I know, the picture proves it, I‚Äôm just... in awe at how this man‚Äôs brain works.

Bloody party streamers give 100% more to you and everyone else, 5 of those, plus events often give more

You're also denying a decent player a chance to escape if he gets stuck with a team of DC-ers or day oners.

Now it's time to cleanse it

&gt;torrent
---
Get a load of this guy.
---
Spilling my auric cells all over the place, here.
---
Or you could've ended the game really early against crappy survivors.
---
The pip with no kills could be you being efficient in all other categories with maybe everyone on death hook.
---
My absolute favorite memory playing DBD was a few months back. We had this REALLY good Pig absolutely destroying me and my swf group. And she found me doing a puzzle box with a helmet on. I'd already been hooked twice, helmet timer was half down and I had two more boxes to check. I was so committed to finishing this box that when she ran up to hit me while doing the box, I just kept doing the box in a "fuck it" moment. She stopped to watch. Looking quickly back and forth from the box to me excitedly. When I finished, the box laughed at me. She swung her camera around, back and forth, and I could almost hear the laughter from her as she took back off into the night, and left me to my continued search. I nervously laughed the entire way to the next box.
---
not bubba
---
Not here.  Killer has 2 perks, both rank 1.  Means the character they are on is level 9, tops.  They are probably are new killer, and at the rank they should be at.
---
They shouldn't have been matched with you.  If you can make a case on how getting rid of rank reset changes this, I'd be glad to hear it, but I don't see how removing rank reset changes this matchup.
---
As soon as I'd hook one person, I'd turn around and there'd be literally 2 or 3 of them running towards the hook. Like what am I supposed to do? Just let them save him?
---
They finally buffed left behind
---
And yet again nea gets a ugly outfit. Every single time Nea gets outfit it always turns out ugly maybe it's face, hair or something but it's always ugly

&gt;  the client determines if the shot hits, the server determines when it hits.
---
That's *client-side* hit detection. You can't tell the difference between client-side hit detection and server-side hit detection because that's the whole point of lag compensation - to make the experience for the shooter to be as if the detection was client-side.  But just because it appears that way doesn't make it so.
---
As for 500ms ping, a higher ping killer can hit you after you've run through a pallet, but you can drop the pallet before they can hit you.
---
I think I got that in a game where I was working on the last generator when the last survivor was found in a locker and hooked/sacrificed just before I finished it and by dumb luck the killer went to the door on the opposite side from where I finished the gen
---
Right because that's what SWF does they don't communicate who's gonna go for the save they all just go for it at the same time and then when you hit them with what I assume is your rank 20 pig they obviously didn't run away from the hook either for you to chase them right? 
---
Fucking whiny camping bitches, they can't just be assholes in game they also have to come gloat about it on reddit, fucking cancerkid.

I hate Plague. And I love going against Billy. Plague is just boring and I don't wanna hear my survivor cough and puke the hole time.

Spirit deserves a section of her own, or can go in nurse tier, for all I care

Nyeh! I was hoping for the new Kate set today :(

As the Doctor, how many times do I have to shock someone to get them to their maximum madness? Obviously at some point shocking them is meaningless since they‚Äôre already there, but I don‚Äôt know how many shocks that is.

Ok thanks :)

How naive can you be? Seriously?

The client determines when the shot was fired, the server determines what happens when its fired, including whether it hit or not, with lag compensation.

You'd be surprised in red ranks. If you down one guy as billy see another one down them and repeat that for all 4 in the beginning of your game.

Depip.

You actually gotta let survivors go at some points.

This. It's a race.

Hopefully sometime this week because if it comes out next week I certainly ain't playing on it with a bloodhunt.

I‚Äôd fuck Laurie if I found her dead

It‚Äôs from Dwight. I‚Äôd just level him to 40 and keep him there cause Leader and Bond are also excellent perks.

New Kate and Jeff is September 5 I think
---
Well, thanks for crushing my hopes and dreams for today. :(
---
Im not complaining about NOED or anything. But genrushing is a failure as you the killer to apply map pressure.

Its in many ways better. Now everyone can use it, no dribbling, and the ability to save it for when you actually need it

Boil over
---
Tenacity
---
Unbreakable
---
Adrenaline
---
Break hooks in corner of the map (usually 99 about 2/3), when you get chased or the killer is near, break the hooks. They won't have a place to take you unless they got iron grasp/agitation maybe. That's why I have unbreakable (because once you get out the first time they'll probably leave you slugged) and adrenaline. If done correctly, you'll usually have one escape every match
---
Too relatable lol

And then how do I pay for my outfits? Real money?

For as toxic this community seems to be I have yet to run into anyone toxic I‚Äôve gotten some jerks but never toxic

Took you two and a half hours to make it and a Survivor 15 seconds to find it and destroy it.
---
EH WHERE MY FUCKING PTB AT BHVR? I WAS PROMISED A PTB.
---
Flex it brother.
---
Think of how the killers feel
---
Fair enough. It's a shame it's most likely not going to be solved by the time the next chapter comes out.
---
Can you elaborate? I don‚Äôt understand
---
Michael is in ‚Äúdontscareme‚Äù
---
There are few things as satisfying as a survivor teabagging in a fake pallet
---
It wasn't too difficult before EGC. But now, meta is check nearest door, then find hatch and close it. Once the EGC has started, it's impossible to get this achievement. You got real lucky.
---
It‚Äôs all up to you. 
---
Do you buy multiple ‚Äúoutfits‚Äù. 
---
I‚Äôve bought 1 BM Jeff outfit 
---
Kate skirt, Legion knife and that‚Äôs it lol. 
---
Rather not waste my Money on more pointless stuff. 
---
But if you‚Äôre saving shards for outfits seems like you are making a choice.
---
I mean yeah, you gotta get your hook points. I am red ranks (pig main). If you're killing everyone on their first hook, then yeah, you're gonna depip.
---
BBQ won't necessarily; Ruin will.
---
&gt;Get stuck with a team of DC-ers or day oners? Killer can close the hatch and get a free kill on you.
---
Not an issue, the game is over at that point. It may have not been a satisfying game, but the last person had their chance to find the hatch and failed.
---
&gt;EGC started? Better hope the killer doesn't have a detection perk or the gates aren't too close together, otherwise you have no chance.
---
Not an issue, although apparently some maps are getting their gate spawns looked at. However BHVR has already said that no matter how much work they do, the procedural generator will just sometimes make 2 gates easy to patrol. 
---
My question, why do you feel you deserve a decent chance of escaping at that point? Your team has utterly failed, and whether you were directly responsible for that failure or not, have to play the hand you're dealt. The old hatch system was stupidly survivor sided. Now things wrap up in a tidy 2-4 minutes and everyone can go on with their lives.
---
That's what I'm saying. If you go against crappy survivors then you end up dropping unless you try to stall the game which is stupid.
---
Is that game kidding me? I buyed bubba just 3 days before BBQ hit the shrine.. thanks for that waist of money. Then I was okay, let's play the hag, even if I don't like her, for her ruin. Yesterday I finished her on lvl 35 and now it's in the shrine. So I waisted 2x 35 levels for a bit shards.. wow, that's crazy.. I'm so pissed.
---
Could you buy legion before next week please? I would like those perks too
---
This is so cute wtf
---
But fake it a few times to test the waters. Like let them get a bit comfortable by respecting the distance and then go for a play
---
It used to be able to repair a generator instantly. Later it got nerfed so you would get a difficult skill check every 2/3 seconds and each successful skill check would give you like maybe 15% progress until the gen was finished or you missed a skill check.
---
I like it more because after I finish a gen is really the only time I feel I actually need to know where the killer is to make a better decision on where to go. Plus I'm usually a gen jockey.
---
When I run alert, it just works at less useful times. Like when I already knew the killer was no where near me.
---
I mean, no its not? Maybe its just me but I prefer to actually give survs a fighting chance. It makes the game more interesting and fun for everyone. Why would I want to just shit stomp the enemy? If there isn't a fight, it isn't fun.
---
Yeah but we have remake Freddy.
---
It's because people picked up the game because Ash is in it.  Which includes like....most of my friends who picked up the game.
---
Even if they stay for Ghost Face.
---
I play a few games before spending. I‚Äôm not really intelligent enough at the game to know what‚Äôs best to get
---
Shes the only killer i havent fully learned how to counter, as soon as i learn im matched with a spirit, i kinda curl up in a ball and cry.
---
You seem like the minority here OP, no one here seems to agree with you. Anyways EGC is a whole lot better then a hatch stand off or a little survivor creeping around. If survivors play it smartly they can win, compared to you saying its a free kill for the killers.
---
I don‚Äôt even know how to correctly apply map pressure, I generally push the survivors to do the gens the furthest away until the 3 closest together are left. (Most map have 3 gen so close together you can patrol those in a few seconds.)
---
But let‚Äôs say it doesn‚Äôt always works.
---
You get a notification if they HAVE thrill, not just when it's the one you cleanse.
---
If you google "can you run it" and then click on the the one that says system requirements lab, it will prompt you to download something to checkout your specs. Then you can search different games and see if you have either the recommended specs or the minimum specs.
---
&gt;So you go to exit gate and what do you know you see tbag tbag tbag. I don‚Äôt care for that little bp you get from a hit it‚Äôs like just fuckin escape and let me move on to another match, thank you!
---
That's precisely my point, surely you have something else better to do in-game or irl!
---
I hate it when this happens specially when the killer hits you from a mile away
---
Is this post against dcs or EGC? Because i think you're using dcs as an excuse to hate ECG

Shattered Memories might be the only one released for console that I couldn't bring myself to complete.  I can only assume it was better on the Wii.

---
Lol k
---
Normally this kinda stuff doesn't get to me but after 3 games in a row of the same, it gets tiresome.
---
Why am I getting so many downvotes?
---
The people I had played against were extremely toxic and had twice the gametime I had.
---
I just wanted to show how toxic parts of the community are.
---
They had the audacity to call me a noob after struggling to kill 3 of them and barely getting the last kill.
---
Don't think trophies count people who have never launched the game
---
Sounds like theres a perk specifically designed to counter flashlights but spiteful killers would rather run a bad perk that makes survivors salty instead. 
---
Or you could just counterplay flashlights with the ample available *in-game* options and not waste a perk slot. But that would require thinking, and given you think franklins is better at countering flashlights then Lightborn, you clearly don't think too often.
---
Disagree. Read the title.
---
What
---
Still using a slot for a useless perk after getting those 2/3 totems.
---
Oh poor baby killer doesnt want his eyes to hurt. 
---
Get fucked loser.
---
Estimates come from having actual information to estimate from.
---
You are guessing, at best.
---
IM SO BAD AT JUKING ON CONSOLE HELP ME
---
I guess I just always grab thrill when breaking a hex, I've never broken a non-thrill while on a hex totem and getting the notification. Dumb luck lmao
---
Streamer.  They are gonna probably put them on a cooldown timer since if you are smart you just spam them while being looped and eventually they you can't be looped.
---
Wow survivors are really not getting any thing are they.
---
Survivors feel the need to rub it in your face because they actually managed to escape a trial for their first time. I'm a killer main and T-bags are great for me because everyone who does it usually ends up getting slapped with a NOED in the gate, sometimes followed with a mori. It's also funny when they drop a pallet and T-bag. Apparently pressing space bar takes an incredible amount of skill. Post game chat I'll usually drop a gg and not give them what they want, which is a pissed off killer and tell them gl in their next game.
---
it's not even that hard
---
Found the guy that only learnt how to play with Ruin and now can't fathom map pressure any other way.
---
P.T. had me so fucking hype for a new one on next gen.
---
OVERPOWERED.
---
Clown was added after the moon offering was disabled....
---
Or let the killer get some hit points but besides that they should leave. It's what causes killers to run a nurse with noed ruin and mori or an anal beads spirit. Then survivors that tbag get mad with those killers when they are part of the problem
---
You showed a screenshot of rankings and loadouts and claimed they were smurfing. So that's what people are talking about because you provided nothing to back up your claim about toxicity, so people are discussing the smurfing accusation and you're getting downvoted because it is a patently absurd charge
---
I wish we could get a Pennywise killer but doofy clown will have to do! Still love these keep posting :)
---
nope
---
I DONT HAVE SELF CARE CAUSE IM NEW TO SURVIVOR AND I DONT HAVE A MEDKIT PLEASE HEAL ME AFTER I HEALED YOU PLEASEEEEE
---
You monster
---
I plan on to play someone else until they reach P3
---
Lightborn. I love seeing flashlights because I always get free hits at pallets and everyone wastes time following me for saves that will never happen.
---
Wait is the ptb for stranger things out yet?
---
Sometimes, there's a point to it.  Waiting to make sure everyone gets out, someone on hook, not everyone accounted for, etc.
---
At this point, I don't even go to the exit gate unless I think I can get someone.  I'll just look around for the hatch.  If I'm lucky, I can find and close it before the last person leaves.
---
Yeah, they are wasting my time hanging out there, but I'm wasting their time by not engaging them there.
---
Why did this take so long to come to reality?
---
What if there's no ptb cause there won't be a ptb? It's a stretch yes but considering bloodhunt is happening in september, and the dlc is confirmed to release for September, what if there simply won't be a ptb? It would be a deviation to their usual shenanigans but there was once a time where dlc didn't get ptb, so what if it's the same for this one? Only reason people even wanted a bloodhunt is cause of the amount of characters the dlc has compared to the usual, meaning more levels. What if it drops September 5th with no ptb (since that's when bloodhunt starts)
---
Obviously not saying this is the case, but it's the only thing that make sense for the time the bloodhunt starts.
---
Ash mains are bad teammates from my experience.
---
Sadly no
---
Umm wdym? Compare survivor and killer.  Killer has some bones that slow down gens. On the other hand survivor has P E B B L E. Clearly survivors have it better

You  aren't playin with the right Ashes then. True asses are fucking Chad's that take the agro at every possible moment and interrupt chases to get those MoM stacks

I completely agree, I just felt like Steve got a pretty iconic skin, while Nancy didn't.
---
Not true. I believe the moon offerings were removed from the bloodweb at that point, but if you still had some in your inventory you could use them at that time.
---
Honestly I'm still holding out they give Vigil the buff they talked about waaaay back when the Exhaustion changes first happened.
---
And that is, if you use Vigil, Exhaustion will now recover while running at a reduced rate. I don't think it would ever be the old 50% value but even 20% recovery would be a massive buff.

What sucks is that they managed to get to the gate by letting the other skilled players die,instead of working togheter and potentially have a 4 man escape

Maybe it's their biggest accomplishment in life and they need to relish in their win? No idea.

Nope, I had a couple on my claudette and I was 100% sure I couldn't use them after the update

Did I say anything about entitlements? I'm just saying don't bring items to my realm. Dude relax it's only a game.

But it hasn‚Äôt. Slightly updated but the ‚Äúoptimization‚Äù patch hasn‚Äôt even released yet it‚Äôs on the road map try again.
---
 could you make me a sandwich?
---
I know right? Its made even worse by the fact, that like a month before it was even announced, I was talking to my friend about how much I wanted a leather jacket for kate, then they reveal it, and of course, its pretty much the last skin in the batch.
---
No credit to the original creator.... *tut tut*
---
Camping when it makes no sense is the only thing that irks me. It irks me knowing the killer is going to lose out on another kill if he is camping me hard when there's only one other person left and they are circling the hatch. Do yourself a favor and go look for the hatch/other survivor, they are not going to come save me if you are around, they are going for hatch like a smart person.
---
This was great, there‚Äôs no way you could‚Äôve stayed in for another millisecond

It adds the hell up and is just shitty behavior but you don't care.

So far I'm best with pig and decent with Mikey, I'm just not good enough so everytime I go into a game, I'm lucky if I even HIT someone let alone down them. I feel like I would be better with ghost face then Myers but I don't have a job so I don't have the money for the spoopy boi
---
Dude I'm just saying you must get salty when you drop your flashlight. Why does it get you so angry? How about I use what perks I want, let me suffer or succeed what difference is it to *you*?
---
I know it might look like an overkill but trust me, each perk is equally important. With this build it is important to be able to get back up asap. If you only run no mither you might not have enough time to get yourself up. The Killer knows you're in the area so getting up faster really helps. A couple times I was in a situation where I managed to get up and I thought "okay so this build really is not an overkill and I would not have made it without all these three perks" :)

Yeah, no entitlement here.

Do you get as upset when survivors burn offerings too? Or is that vital and intentional game feature too much for you to handle as well?

She comes with 2 outfits

Probably not anytime even remotely soon. The matchmaking is already one foot in the grave. Another game mode would snap it in half.

She has two default outfits, and then the bloody clothes if you prestige her.

It's Laurie and the only additional clothes she has is her bloody prestige clothes. Do you have a screengrab of the character?

Did you make an alternative account just to comment this like a child? Seems so. Nice.

Does anyone feel he isn't as toxic as he once was like his first toxic survivor and killer videos he has no remource and will do anything but I feel now  he's no where near as bad
---
I've seen a lot of spirit and I don't think I could ever be good with her but haunted grounds looks soooooo good to use against the people obsessed with hex cleansing especially when paired with thrill of the hunt
---
Shut up nerd you can't deny that he's a camping loser so you have to go look at my account digging for something else to bitch about, I would never be part of this braindead circlejerk you got going on here.
---
Jane Romero wants to know your location.
---
The worst is when they wait at the gates and then leave before you can hit them. Like why even bother?
---
A lot of these ideas are busted. Wraiths speed increase while cloaked is on good lines but his intel in it is far too much for base. Canibal is an instadown killer so buffing his ability for chase to that extent is risky unless the insta is removed and ghostface cannot have a phone due to legal reasons. In addition the pig buffs dont adress her core issue of traps being rng and instead only makes them more frustrateing for survivors.
---
I also disagree that clown needs another chase power, he already has the ability to shut down pretty much every pallet loop and maze tile in the game; his main issue is his lack of map pressure due to being unable to play much around dropped safe pallets.
---
I do like the doctor, legion and trapper buffs though.
---
I can see you put a lot of effort into this and you win an upvote from that alone. I know how it feels to put shit tons of effort into an idea and have it thrown in the trash by people. You have some good ideas here, cannibal would be fine with this idea if you remove the insta down.
---
Why tho? There are not that many players so if there is another gamemode it will take even longer to find a lobby.

What would I swap tho?
---
EGC is not perfect, but it is waaaaay better than what we had before. Hatch standoffs were terrible. And in the case you presented, you‚Äôd have to repair 2 gens just to get the hatch to spawn! That is never going to happen (assuming the killer doesn‚Äôt go AFK) and it‚Äôs just a waste of everyone‚Äôs time. If you like stealth-only then there are lots of other games to try. But holding another player hostage in a game because you wanna sneak around accomplishing nothing... that‚Äôs just mean.
---
I hate Kate, I wish they'd stop giving her cosmetics so I don't have to read the fuckin' crying every single week it doesn't come out.

Literally every time Kate gets a cosmetic, smdh.

Yeah but that's not everyone basically you called everyone no matter who they are a moron see how that's different

this, the central loop is to 4k, but dbd does one more step with the lore to actually entertain the entity. You need to create false hope or prolong the game artificially as a part of your skillset

They should really give it a normal cool down I don‚Äôt know why you have to put your life in danger just to be able to use it.
---
The server determines whether it was a hit or not based on it‚Äôs calculation of the killer‚Äôs current gamestate when he swung, which in his screen was a hit. So the attack will register as a hit, even if the survivor‚Äôs gamestate showed a significant distance from the killer.
---
FENG, THE KILLER IS MILES AWAY CHASING SOMEONE ELSE, WE CAN SEE THE OBSESSION ICON MEANS THEY'RE IN A CHASE. I WILL HEAL YOU, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE A SAFE JUNGLE GYM FOR AN UNSAFE CORNER TO HEAL YOU! EITHER SIT THERE AND LET ME HEAL YOU, OR DO THE DAMN GEN SITTING IN FRONT OF US INSTEAD OF WAVING AT ME TO GO TO THE CORNER! I DID 75% OF A GEN BEFORE YOU GOT THE DAMN HINT, AND I HEALED YOU AND WE DID THE GEN! BUT THAT'S A WHOLE MINUTE OF YOU DOING FUCK-ALL!

WHEN tho. Yeah it used to not be hard to get. Like at all. But now it's damn near impossible to get cause of Endgame Collapse.
---
Yes exactly! I feel like too many people feel like the goal is to 4K as quickly as possible, when really, the real goal is to 4K in a way that gives hope, and then takes it away. Slowly, and meticulously. I also find that this is the most fun way to play killer.
---
Dude, relax. You made your point known. I'm still going to play how I want. Sorry buddy.
---
i started playing a month ago
---
There are 18 killers in the game buddy, you "not liking getting flashlighted" isn't the same as being completely fucking useless vs a growing number of killers, peanits has definitly taken your whine into consideration as well because he's not 12 so sorry you're wrong.
---
Yea but he doesnt want to drop any of his meta perks out of the build. Like, how dare you making him to not equip adrenaline or dh
---
After so long, I've finally put these screenshots together!
---
Holy shit that's rather OP and fair at the same time
---
He had so much time to escape lmao, I like to think he scratched his face at the wrong time.
---
If one of your friends touches it, scream "HALLOWED GROUND" and then slap them in the back of the head.
---
 Its so blurry I cant even read them, maybe post them in separate pictures?
---
Or when somone switches it out/gives it to you And you flashlight save him. It feals So good
---
Mostly just a joke perk about how when a monster chases them in the show they just run in place for a few seconds, than TAKE OFF at a ridiculous speed.
---
Who am I kidding you morons will pretend you didn't read it and keep using the same braindeadarguments anyways, that's the beauty of being a moron, you don't really care about what better and smarter people than you say.
---
Good try but im gonna be honest with you, its not very funny. Keep at it tho.
---
Uhh... I personally like the perk Iron Will.  It‚Äôs a good perk in general, might not be the meta, but I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve found someone because they were moaning, and I‚Äôve lost people because of my heavy reliance on sound.  I might just rely too much on sound, but it‚Äôs one of the best tools at a killers disposal and Iron Will makes it more difficult to find survivors.
---
But I guess I‚Äôm just a Trapper main with no brain( and yes, I run Iron Will as a survivor).
---
Ah I forgot that you needed that smell to attract LITERALLY Evey survivor to your totem. Now it makes sense why ruin is broken in the first 10 secs of the game
---
You do you man. Enjoy green ranks forever. 
---
BTW, i love baiting killers into wasting a perk slot. One of these days you'll ascend to a decent killer and youll realize items dont really impact the game very much, and you'll feel silly you thought Franklins was ever necessary or even good. Until then, keep salt mining.
---
Madness T1 is absolutely not your friend as Doctor. It's good for the initial scream, but after that you need to get people into T3 (or T2 if you're using the appropriate add-ons) as soon as possible because otherwise they're effectively invisible unless you're using Barbecue for Bloodpoints (because why else would anyone take a tracking perk on Doctor?).
---
Not sure about Overcharge - he comes with it, but to be honest I prefer the guaranteed regression of Pop Goes the Weasel, even though it demands a hook. 
---
In terms of playstyle, if you're opening with Treatment mode then be very, very careful to get into Punishment mode as soon as one person screams. M1 gameplay until they're down, then sit on them in Treatment until they're T3 (or T2 if you're confident and using related add-ons). Static Field weakens over distance, so if you're standing on them they'll build Madness very quickly. If you hear a scream, make a value decision over whether to chase the new survivor or to keep on with the downed one. Add-ons make a difference here - if you're using Electrodes and an Interview Tape then you can try blasting the other survivor to at least get them into T2, rather than chasing them, while using Static Field add-ons can cut down on the time taken to stand on a survivor. Monitor &amp; Abuse can help a little because it keeps the TR small outside of chase, so there's (a) less chance of people walking into the Static Field during this time, and (b) if they *do* enter it, they'll be close enough for Shocks or hits.
---
Once survivors are in T3 you can use Hallucinations for tracking, plus it stops them from being able to work on gens or cleanse totems. Snapping Out of It takes time, time you can spend hunting for other survivors. It's very hard for survivors to gain back momentum when they're all running around in T3, and that's also the time when you can be a bit more casual with your Treatment mode - even *if* they get down to T2, it won't take much to push them back into T3.
---
The problem I find with Doctor is that running around in Treatment mode means that you very easily put everyone into T1, making them invisible to you. Note that a large Treatment radius is a significant liablity for Doctor, because you're announcing your appearance from across the map - survivors will have plenty of time to hide. A strong Doctor knows when to broadcast themselves, and when to sneak up on people - it's all about the Terror Radius mindgaming.
---
You won't scream and give yourself away after leaving a locker. Meaning the only time the exposure matters is if the killer was nearby when you exited
---
I tell you what, indulge me. How is Iron Will useless against every other killer? I genuinely want to know this. The only one I can truly think of is Doctor since he'll find you anyway no matter what. 
---
Against everyone else Iron Will is legit the best way to lose any killer when you're bleeding. It allows you to not have to heal and keep working generators or just be near the killer in general. It's a strong perk, but because it's not flashy people don't tend to run it.
---
plague&gt;medkits
---
Unbreakable combined with no mither isn‚Äôt a waste actually, since unbreakable will still give the recover speed boost while no mither covers the being able to get up. Unbreakable never disables due to no mither so you always have the boost
---
Agreed
---
I'm sure anyone who isn't a moron in this subreddit agrees with me anyways and therefore know I'm not talking about them.
---
Ok, well if you agree that we have to see the game, then why are you so stuck on calling him a camper. And proxy camping is what your supposed to do when people are running around the hook, your not supposed to let them get unhooked, but your not supposed to make sure it impossible either. In the situation described, it wasn't impossible for the survivors to unhook
---
Let me guess. You are salty because a spirit just destroyed you??? Its not cool when you notice that you are not as good as you think xD Maybe if you stop moaning like a little girl and instead get committed to improving you will git gud some day ;)

When you buy a perk you don‚Äôt automatically get it you just enable it to be unlocked in the blood web of any killer it removes the hassle of leveling up killers you don‚Äôt like to play much.
---
no, but if you download it and install updates it does. You can compare trophies with other players as long as they have installed that game. I was able to compare Overwatch trophies with the psn account on my ps4 I made for my nephews, even though they have never played overwatch on it.
---
4ks don‚Äôt matter! 
---
I played a game as Wraith yesterday. The survivors were so altruistic that at one point, I had 2 on hooks, 1 downed, and the last survivor injured. This was before any gens were done (they hadn‚Äôt even found ruin yet). I could‚Äôve easily got a 4K right away. But it would‚Äôve got me fewer BPs, and the survivors practically none. So instead, I let them get the saves, heal up, and we kept on playing. At the end of the game, we all had lots of points and more importantly, we all had fun! 
---
Why can‚Äôt more people play for fun?
---
That would be a dream come true
---
Whats the name of this perk?
---
Yeah go say that to the peanits guy mate the devs are right there for you to argue against, I'm sure you and your 14 years of lifeexperience will win that debate.
---
That‚Äôs what makes flashlights terrible against her, all she has to do is look downwards while she stands still and blinding her to see if she‚Äôs phasing ends up getting you killed.

Well, I'm gonna have to ask for proof. Cause your not making sense. So in your 5th match just starting out you had the skill to complete an entire generator by yourself before the killer found hatch/you then powered the exit gate and escaped. Bs.
---
Tbf...Noed on Nurse is sweaty af

Np just see which one fits your style of play.

As long as their on the ground it should work

Lol. "Bold assumption". I'm not talking to the Queen, I'm talking to some jackass on Reddit; there is nothing bold about it - nor is it an assumption.

" . . . but I fucking live for it, as slowly skulking around the map, hopping between generators trying to avoid the killer and at least get the hatch to spawn is some of the most enjoyable moments of this game for me."

99% of the time its pointless but sometimes it can be helpful to secure a 4k as killer when one person is on the hook and the other is being slugged or playing lf when you have one person in the basement and insidious those are the only good opportunities

Thank you for using the right lyrics I love you

Considering the gates already spawn right next to eachother 75% of the time that isn't necessary at all lmao. I'm a killer main and even I can see how bullshit it is that I've got clear view of both gates at once.
---
DS isn‚Äôt a problem if you keep track of who you hook. If I find someone right after they‚Äôre unhooked I‚Äôll just slug until I find someone else.
---
As a killer main, I honestly think that whispers is bullshit.
---
Hey man, I‚Äôm not insulting. I‚Äôm just laughing at how he couldn‚Äôt get over you had noed, since he mentioned it twice.

u/Otzdarva has several perk guides that are worth your time:
---
[General Killer perk review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C49wygOeZ5I).
---
[Beginner Killer perks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_yixIT0p58).
---
[Advanced Killer perks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFF0iMH9oTU).
---
This should help you plan your approach to your preferred Killer.
---
I personally do not believe in a single all-singing, all-dancing Killer meta build. Ruin is probably the nearest single perk that fits the definition, but everything else is situational by Killer due to how their powers work.
---
Pick the Killer you enjoy most, build around that. If you're not gunning for Rank 1 then "meta" isn't really going to apply, so you'd have greater latitude to just have fun and enjoy yourself.
---
Then have the Entity make his own fucking Killer and do his own damn work- Myers wants blood and so do I!
---
Ahh sorry my mistake
---
I usually ignore an afk after hitting them once. I see it as 1 less person on gens and that‚Äôs fine with me. Playing a man down from the start can be devastating to a team. Plus I want the person to get a chance at a safety pip at least. Not to mention I‚Äôll get more points if the player is active in the game.
---
Why do people keep thinking it's gonna be out ? It's def next week since console releases always happen the week after the final cosmetic . We still have kate and Jeff's biker one next week.
---
I will admit. Never gotten a GG, but the thousand of times I don't get anything is a million times better than the 5-10 times they shit talk.

I also acomplished that :D High five!
---
Hi I would like to order four dulls totems I heard of your deal buy four get a hex totem free.
---
yeah its a big wtf moment when you play the hillbilly
---
They should always be polar opposites if you ask me
---
This made me laugh so hard because that is EVERY MATCH against him üòÇüòÇü§£
---
I unironically want this tbh
---
*NANCY WHEELER WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION*
---
I do it if the killer was facecamping all game.
---
I sense blink camping
---
No worries. :)
---
It's ridiculously overpowered? And I say that as a rank 1 nurse main.
---
I honestly think the new freddy is op as fuck. He is a anti looper that teleports.
---
XBOX GANG RISE UP!
---
Console nurse is pretty hard
---
Even so no matter how skillful you will have a hard time with ghostface is you are facing survivors that know how to play
---
I've never played him so I wouldn't know how it is for killers point of view but all ik is, is that it can be frustrating to reveal him at times.
---
Nurses calling is extremely good on Ghostface. Smarter survivors use the rule of thumb aka "If you can hear the terror radius, you're probably within range of nurses calling, always assume all killers are running Nurses Calling and abort the heal as soon as you hear the TR." and since ghostface completely hides his TR when stealthed, you make that "Trick" no longer work.
---
Instead of saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ridiculously overpowered,‚Äù comment on what you think is overpowered instead of calling it a shitpost.
---
He is not much of a issue overall its just that you're having a harder time against him
---
Him: were good but you cheated
---
So, camping  is cheating now?
---
Well, i think every sprintburst perk is cheating
---
you cant outrun a killer so now that is also cheating.
---
I love to see salty survivors waist there time
---
Speak for yourself ;)
---
Maybe add the Exposed effect if theres a successful hit when running
---
That was my first achievement, only learned the dificulty later
---
They can do whatever the hell you want
---
WAIT, REALLY?
---
Downvoted, not because of the content of the post, I understand what you're trying to get across, but because of the attitude and way you talked down to people. There would have been a much more civil way to explain your argument, but you took the low road and decided to sling insults at every person because you wanted to make yourself feel as though you gained validity for your argument.
---
BTW, survivor main, so the "salty killer main" argument you keep throwing at everyone else gives you no power here.
---
I just say fuck it and sit looking at the gate go do some dishes, play on phone,  then come back and see the teabagging survivors either die at the gate. Or they ran back into the map for items and died. Oddly enough I get a lot of ‚Äúlate game sacrifices‚Äù that way.
---
High five do-the-impossible buddy! 0.1% Club, baby!
---
Nurse on console is very playable since the framerate went up.
---
Same with huntress.
---
Getting stuck on trees has nothing to do with the console version, this happens in **every** version.
---
Framerate dips in corn are gone since the framerate went up.
---
Try again?
---
Mine too. At least he has an awesome prestige to offer.
---
And she would have gotten away with it , if it weren't for those meddling Blendettes
---
Cheapest laptop with a RTX2060. This game is surprisingly demanding for how bad it looks and how small the map size is.
---
So whats wronh with having fun
---
They‚Äôre not the same and you know it. Killers need their powers significantly more than survivors need their items, and powers are what gives each killer an incentive to be played. Survivors are just skins due to the fact that you can use any perk and any item on any survivor.
---
 You have to buy the chapter not the characters, so the whole $5 somethings
---
Positive outlook, I like that lol
---
That Freddy must be pissed
---
Just use whatever you want brother, you don't need an excuse to validate your usage of NOED. You can take it on billy if you feel like it, just ignore the salty people, they'll complain no matter what.

Doesn't change that I find it frustrating sadly
---
FUCK EVERY LAST ONE OF YOU SURVIVORS WHO I HOOKED AND THEN LEFT!  I JUST WANT MY FUCKING BP,  AND YOU SWF ASSHOLES MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE WITH YOUR STUPIDITY!WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU PLAYING IF YOU CANT DEAL WITH GETTING TRAPPED AND HOOKED?! GOD FUCKING DAMNIT!
---
Let's see, you want:
---
- Built in insidious
---
- A hitscan Sniper Rifle with I'm assuming a sight.
---
- a 2 second total stun with a 12 metre radius, that you can throw, over 12 metres.
---
- a better clown ability that muffles TR/Chase music, and reveals aura
---
- a lean
---
Every single one of those things is overpowered
---
I did, don't worry
---
Big sad hes still ok I'm playing him at green ranks and doing pretty well. I dont even tunnel or slug. In fact I like to injure everyone so if someone saves I can hit them instead of the unhooked person tunneling is saved for the douches that tbag pallets and body block.
---
That tracks. Good to know, though. I was fine setting aside a full $20 just in a case.
---
Killer hits me on hook I‚Äôll teabag every time. No taunting from killer no taunting from me.
---
Join the discord, the subreddit isn't for LFG
---
Quentin is my favorite though. . .
---
I think ds is so balanced but people just complain about it always working. And they say they aren't tunneling
---
Idk what that is I‚Äôm new to reddit
---
Yeah i feel you man i always have a hard time with spirit
---
It's ridiculously overpowered because of how easy it would be to hit people with the ability, all you'd need is a high vantage point and prone and you'd be able to injure everyone from a ridiculous distance that can't be dodged or even seen. Plus with the killer being able to see gens they could just scope at every one of them and just hit whoever starts to repair. The only counter play to this is rushing gens when you go to reload but with 5 shots per clip that's 2 downs and an injure, you'd have to heal or else you'd just get downed too easily to make it worth not healing, so that's a lot of time wasted on healing. Partner the ability with perks like sloppy and you can make a game take an eternity or end way too quickly. If it was something like 2 shots per clip it would be more balanced but even then it's too easy of an ability to hit with too long of range. If it were a projectile it would just be an easier huntress for new people since you'd have an actual aimbox, but if it was hitscan then it would be way too powerful of an ability. It would also make camping an almost global trait of the character since you don't need to chase to tunnel you can just watch them unhook and then pop whoever comes off the hook, plus with being so far away you can't counter it with BT since you have to be close enough for that to activate. Losing control of your character for almost 2 seconds is too strong since pathing is a major portion of this game, and there's no counter play for the survivors since only the killer has to look at the flashbang to be affected (unless that applies to survivors too in which case it would be next to impossible to hit them or impossible to miss depending on how it interacted with 3rd person vs 1st person) The smoke grenade is too strong since it has absolutely no downside to using it for the killer since it reveals them there's no stealthing out of it. Basically it's broken because he has too much range and hit potential with the rifle while also having too great of chase potential in taking control of pathing away from the survivors and revealing them in something that they can't see through. I'd say either go one way or the other, seems like this killer would be able to chase pretty well while also being able to use range when typically characters that chase well don't have range or if they have range they don't chase well
---
TL;DR that sniper is too powerful with how much range and how little counterplay it has since you can't see where it's aiming or dodge it's shots without knowing he's aiming at you
---
I just see someone who isn‚Äôt doung gens, also known as someone who isn‚Äôt causing me issues, and if you‚Äôre my obsession, STBFL and PWYF

Hey, you‚Äôre finally awake. You were trying to escape Coldwind Farm, right? Walked right into that EW3 Myers, same as us, and that Dwight over there
---
Not all the time, I‚Äôm a killer main and idk if it‚Äôs just my luck but the gates always spawn super far from each other
---
I have no idea why he thought that was a good idea
---
I WAS SUPER ANGRY (UNRELATED BUT MY NETFLIX GOT HACKED) SO I WENT ON A KILLER RAMPAGE TO VENT BUT I DID TERRIBLE AND IT ONLY MADE ME ANGRIER
---
You son of a bitch.
---
Will NOT hear a heartbeat? So no notification like Freddie's blood at a gen? Sketch
---
*pshiiiiit*
---
They camp more often than Bubba's.
---
I really don't like Meg, I have no idea why everybody plays as her. If she would look like your drawing... then yes!
---
How about some Jeff? :D
---
In my experience i just dont see anyone slugging and even when they do I rarely see myself or anyone bring anti slugging perks
---
Dont get me wrong i agree with you but Quinton's perks you can actually use all game (besides wake up)  unlike Ash's only used in certain situations
---
I used a Smoldering Splinter offering (Freddy Demo) and played as Freddy. Old Freddy. Never even saw him before then. No perks, no addons, just plain old terrible Freddy. The first Kate to dc on second hook (the first to go down) decided to follow me around and message me about how awful and weak i was while I got a quick 3k on the rest of the team. This was on PS4 so this took him EFFORT to tell me how upset he felt entitled to be. I explained to him that if I was using the worst killer with nothing on him, got a 3k in under 10 minutes, and I was weak, he should be asking himself what he is compared to me, and then listed the exact strategy to counter Freddy so he'd be quiet. People suck.
---
Mmkay well I'll make sure to lagswitch you next time we play and if you do someone manage to get away from me I'll DC so you get no points. See you in the fog.
---
Lololol
---
Okay I love everything about this mental image
---
Switch nurses calling to thathnaphobia
---
this is why every 30 games a quit would be "forgotten" since sometimes you just really have to go for legit reaosns.
---
Do the splinters flip like regular addons? I only ever saw them from the killers perspective and just wondering
---
No where near as bad as object of obsession.
---
Ok rage downvote
---
Nah. You dont waste time searching. Id argue its almost meta
---
It was never like that. The system before emblem was indeed even worst was nothing like what i suggested
---
From what i remember it was based on how much BP you generated which made pipping super easy for both sides.
---
Not to mention, imo killers are meant to be scary or creepy looking and this just sounds like captain price from call of duty is just gonna come mow people down. Just doesn't fit, itd be like putting Barney into this game.
---
Well now, look who‚Äôs shitting in the tall grass
---
I've had good luck with after doing the first hit, run ahead of them and cut them off before a strong loop before exiting your power.
---
Bringing a new meaning to cross-map snipes. Also way too OP
---
Idk pharmacy is okay but if u wanna heal just bring self-care. It's only good if you're farming medkits. Vigil is pretty ass, cause by the time you find a teammate with an exhaustion perk it won't matter.
---
That Clown is ADORABLE!!!! I hope you make stickers or something else with these. I would definitely buy them.
---
Why is this such a controversial comment? That‚Äôd be an amazing passive and I honestly thought that‚Äôs what they were planning on doing anyway.

---
Totally deserved. What a piece of shit.
---
Freddy was a Killer whose power was "Wait 7 seconds to attack".... no he was bad. Tracking isn't a power, the game has enough tracking that his power was redundant and only helped newer players tunnel
---
To be fair, survivors have always said ‚Äújust use bamboozle‚Äù when it comes to the god windows
---
You're not gonna become a pro in 2 hours lol. Id suggest watching pros on twitch or youtube to improve. TrU3Ta1ent, Otzdarva, Monto, etc
---
You still get bloodpoints for hooking the survivor, I agree it wastes the perk to camp but regardless they get the bonus.
---
You don't lose it, and if you go into the details part of the character selection screen you'll actually see which Teachables you've unlocked on that particular character.
---
I literally never bother upvoting/downvoting , get mad at others
---
lol no, that perk is garbage tier on everyone but Legion and plague
---
Im not saying Quinton's perks are good just you can get more consistent and reliable use out of them then Ash's 
---
Besides vigil can help with your own exhaustion as well

And pharmacy can be helpful for chest builds

*Insert 4th perk here (up the anti)?
---
Did you buy the Chapter or just the character
---
‚Ä¢ The terror radius removed while prone can always be removed for balancing.
---
‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs a SCOPE without a crosshair. You‚Äôre using muscle memory to know where your shot is gonna land or you‚Äôre just gonna waste time trying to line up the shot. With the charge time of 2 seconds (can always be increased to 3 or 4), the survivor can find cover or a jungle gym where he becomes an M1 killer with 105 movement speed. Unless he manages his cooldowns effectively, he‚Äôs getting looped. Not to mention that if he runs out of ammo, he either has to find an ammo box or commit to a chase without his rifle.
---
‚Ä¢ The stun can last 1 second, and the range can be 8 m. It‚Äôs just meant to make jungle gyms and loops bearable for him since he‚Äôs so slow.
---
‚Ä¢ Remove the aura reading. And I meant muffled as in the way Legion‚Äôs power messes with the chase music.
---
He‚Äôs countered by cover, debris and immersion just like huntress. He‚Äôs garbage on maps with no open spaces like Lery‚Äôs while being just as strong as huntress on more open maps. With him being a 105 m/s and having a charge time on his gun (not to mention there‚Äôs still the length of the SCOPING animation he has to go into which will take another second or two before the charging actually starts). His animation would be 2 seconds taking the rifle off his back, 2 to scope in and 2 (or more) to charge (and bear in mind that‚Äôs 2 seconds per SHOT, so he has to wait another 2 seconds before shooting another shot). That‚Äôs already 6+ seconds that the survivor has (if they‚Äôre aware of where he is) to find cover. He thrives off of survivors being unaware and falls short when he has to actually commit to a loop.
---
Ash mains are groovy
---
Right, how hard is it to make that happen?
---
SEPTEMBER 4 - 9
---
Yes, and one of the killers is Hitler, his power consist in yelling and calling soldiers
---
I‚Äôm goin out in style. Whatitdobabyyyy!
---
Nurse is hard af on console, so i really can‚Äôt blame him for NOED
---
God knows why it‚Äôs the opposite way round for me. I‚Äôve just sat 10 minutes for a match. I love playing Killer and I‚Äôm bored playing survivor but I sure as hell waiting this long
---
30 minutes?  wow, people actually waited that long?  I would of gave up and played another game.  I sincerely hope the 3-45 min wait is exaggerated
---
Wow, I usually never fall for these but you got me
---
Sometimes waits can depend on the nat type that you have. I have a strict nat type so it takes forever to find a game myself. I‚Äôm just waiting on those dedicated servers.
---
Oh yeah, I was thinking of an anti gen build that would use overcharge, surge and surveillance, but I can‚Äôt think of the 4th one...
---
Nea again? Aaaw man. D:
---
There's no audio indication or sight that you would know he's even aiming at you, how do you hide if you don't know where he's looking. Also it's a scope it's either in the center or there's no point in aiming since it'll miss regardless of where you aim, that's why the huntress can't scope down or have an aim indicator because it involves remembering where it's going to go, a scope can only go on direction or it's useless
---
Wat?!
---
Are their stereotypes for every main in this game
---
WHEN YOU CHASE ME FOR THREE+ MINUTES, MISSING MULTIPLE EASY HITS THROUGHOUT THE CHASE AS WELL AS LATER, AND I GET SAVED, HEALED, AND THEN DO SEVERAL GENS MYSELF, NO GEN RUSHING IS NOT THE PROBLEM.
---
oshit my bad, it's the legacy tree*
---
Pretty much
---
Is it balanced tho ? Yes... Perfectly balanced on top of that.
---
This reminds me of the For Honor Glowing Eyes Twitter meme that just came full circle a few weeks ago
---
Leatherface: ‚ÄúYarrrrrp.‚Äù
---
Anne Frank is a new survivor?!
---
Someone pop open a dictionary for this guy cuz he clearly doesn't know what it means to be a dumbfuck
---
It's almost the price of a single skin on this game lmao
---
Thank you!! I always wondered about Hag!
---
Yes.  Matchmaking is awful in this game.  Sometimes you get an actual match with people your rank, but mostly bad matchups like this.
---
PGTW maybe? And I wonder if Overcharge works with Surge
---
What's with all the ecg bad posts today
---
Why even bother to reply
---
NEATO
---
Me when Kates outfit comes out
---
Thank you for all of this info!! I always enjoyed watching players play as Claudette so I may start off with her :)
---
And Arin is the girl, perfect
---
Farming isn't fun.
---
Thank you so so much! I‚Äôm sure this will help me so much when I finally start the game. Hopefully I‚Äôll be a pro soon lol :) I really appreciate this thank you!
---
Yes, but her skills aren't very op
---
Exactly lol.
---
Survivors have always been nothing more than skins though, it's not like anyone will play as both.  This company is slowly getting greedy with microtransactions. Buying all the chapters is quite a huge amount now for a new player, and then you'd still have to buy or farm for cosmetics if you wanted them.
---
This has happened to me more often since last week.  Before that matchmaking was working better
---
Or there talking mad shit for someone in NOED distance
---
It depends largely on your rank and the rank of others. If you rush to red ranks at start of reset, they'll be long. If you wait too long to rank up this can be the case sometimes too. Right now I think the massive influx of new players for ST chapter is what's messing with queue times.
---
The entity is on budget
---
Consider that Netflix is advertising it on their twitter. That's a huge audience to reach. So even if they don't join because Stranger Things, there may be others who may have looked into it because they saw the tweets
---
ok
---
Definitely, the community is amazing, and it's always fun. She starts 10PM ET all nights but Monday and Friday. I started for the sick hatchet shots, and then I stayed for the community.
---
yeah it actually never did feel super fast, but i think you might be able to tap it with a bnp and have it go up by itself? i'd want to test it
---
It's not a good as it could be.
---
Personally I think it should trigger whenever you hit a survivor with Any attack and there's no cool down time.
---
Reason being is that Legion would make great use of it they way they won't be low tier garbage.
---
It would help slow the game down more without relying on that crap perk ruin damn thing gets broken too fast.
---
i stay for a few months and leave for more
---
This is what happens when you're a dickhead. Don't do it kids.
---
You‚Äôre actually out of your mind if you think a killer‚Äôs power is equal to an item. Compare the difficulty of succeeding as a killer without a power to the difficulty of succeeding as a survivor without items outside of the lowest level of play. I also never said that I want the demogorgon to be immune to flashlights, I couldn‚Äôt care less if he is or isn‚Äôt since I‚Äôm not going to play him. My point has been that it isn‚Äôt a problem.
---
I CAN'T HEAR YOU MOTHERFUCKER
---
They need to take the light off the exit panel thing
---
I only find facecamping understandable in the following scenarios. 
---
1. Facecamping an obsession so Dying Light can activate.
---
2. Exit gates are powered. The person hooked is right next to an exit gate. It‚Äôs much better to secure a kill rather than letting them get unhooked and risking getting hit by DS. 
---
3. Bubba‚Äôs basement Build. Its not authentic without the good ole facecamp.
---
4. Facecamping a toxic survivor.
---
Most face campers do it because they are bad, if they played without face camping or tunneling someone they would get 0 kills.
---
The character but it's just a cosmetic they dont give any in game advantages
---
If the TR removal is removed, simply running insidious/play with your food would make him absurdly broken. Giving a killer any type of ranged STUN is absurd, giving killers ranged weapons that aren't projectiles is ridiculous, him being slightly slower doesn't make up for that at all. Get LOS on a door or gen and you can prevent anyone escaping/completing it. As for not having a crosshair, anyone who's played more than 5 minutes of an FPS can easily hit a survivor sized target without a crosshair, lots of monitors even come with built in crosshairs
---
"Monitor and Abuse me" lol
---
This is goldenüòÇüíØ
---
And ruin is still active.
---
What does swf mean?
---
It will work in a different way, you‚Äôll have to smash a gen that‚Äôs outside the radius to be effective but it does improve the gen shutdown process.
---
I'm guessing you stopped playing for a few months before emblems. Yes it was initially based on blood points but before emblems it was changed for killers for a few months. It was based on hooks/kills. Each survivor had 4 points you could take from them. The first hook was one point, them reaching the struggle phase was a second point, and a sacrifice was the final two points. Getting 8 was a black pip, 9 was a pip, and all 18 was a double.
---
Everyone hated it because no matter how well you did it only came down to kills which was boring and lead to a lot of camping.
---
You bet!
---
you cunt
---
I got it because it turns out, it doesn't have to be the last gen. If any gen is popped and then egc is triggered, getting out through a gate will earn it for you. Still tricky, but not quite as terrible.
---
They are hypersensitive to light though.
---
meg has shorts?
---
OOH!
---
I got completely bullied early game by the 3 claudette's but somehow got them all. Still a very poor game from me
---
You're like a child making up rules at chess
---
EVERY LEGION I PLAYED THIS WEEK HAS CAMPED HOOKS AND RAN NOED. I'M NOT SURE IF I SHOULD HATE MY OVERLY ALTRUISTIC TEAM FOR NOT DOING GENS/FEEDING OR THE LEGIONS FOR PLAYING LIKE DICK HEADS.
---
how do you complete it? complete a gen THEN escape through gates or just escape through gates?
---
Was about to say they could‚Äôve been boosting her but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible with emblems :/
---
You mind if I yoink this and put it in Three Flavours Cornettoposting? I can credit you however you'd like me to
---
Im just gonna say this as a killer main;
---
Fuck noed and Fuck adrenaline
---
Yeah! finally pebble on shrine!
---
Iron Maiden isn't really useful unless you're close by though, even at the highest tier, if you're across the map someone can hide and wait out the exposed well before you can find them.
---
To be fair, this is the third time a killer was a copypasta. Hillbilly and Cannibal, Myers and Ghostface, now Hag and Demogorgon. It‚Äôs not a bad thing imo, they add variety to stuff we‚Äôve gotten used to without having to completely rework a killer.
---
Yes last night I played a game of billy and had a 4 stack of brand new players all rank 20 while I was rank 9
---
It freaking sucks for me lol. I have to pay $16.66 :( from normal dlc price $7.50....
---
Fuck
---
original.
---
i think they shouldve kept at least the main gimmick, that he has invisibility until he puts someone asleep. it was different. now he's too much of the same
---
You sly bastard, you got me! Well played friend!
---
I think the complaints are relatively valid. Times have changed though. Cosmetics aren‚Äôt a must, but they sure milk the impulsive public.
---
I really want to suck his dick
---
You really got me there, nice job not actually refuting anything I‚Äôve said once again.
---
Imagine sweating that hard to get the just unhooked person when there's 4 gens left, you know someone's in shack, and someone has DC'd. What a little bitch.
---
For one, mcdonalds is food, you know that thing humans need to live and literally have to buy. 2, survivors are nothing more than skins, literally nobody will play as both Steve and Nancy, they will get the perks and pick one (or neither). The main money is in the killer. 
---
But my main point is that this company is getting very greedy with microtransactions. There are many games that add new characters more frequently and dont charge for them. Think about new players wanting to play the game and unlock  most or even half of the chapters, that's a lot of money to actually get the full game. AND that's with zero cosmetics, if you want those you need to spend even more money.
---
I think DBD players are allowing this to happen and dont even realize, or don't care for some reason. Meanwhile other game companies get shit for way less microtransactions.
---
Bill goes into cardiac arrest after using this perk
---
I've seen some before, you'd be surprised! My favorite was the Jasmine Masters/Huntress meme.
---
Agreed, that was one foolish Freddy. I kinda feel like he did it on purpose.
---
He could do this all day.
---
You're never actually played this game, have you?
---
In the so called "mindgames" you speak of the spirit has **every** advantage. With any decent headset she'll be able to hear exactly where you are regardless if you're running or not, and with how ridiculously fast she moves in the phasing state it's impossible to outrun her to get a pallet or something if you know she'll be able to tail you.
---
It's pretty obvious that you never played survivor against a half decent spirit. Stop trying to justify something you know jack shit about.
---
I played a game against a Michael Myers with blood warden and was terrified. I opened the exit gates while someone was downed and the other two were going for the save. Michael got the hook and I watched in horror as the exit was blocked; the other two got exposed and downed, all I could do was hide in the exit gate and wait until I could run away.
---
Why unrelenting? Why?
---
I don't think you understood his joke. He was saying that the last sentence applies to him and he's unhappy about it.
---
True, I guess I‚Äôm thinking of a ‚Äúget of my gen‚Äù kind of build.
---
well not my fault i hooked her, went after another guy and hooked him within 60 seconds and then just so happened to find the unhooked guy again.
---
I have to agree with the other comments this seems incredibly over powered. Basically this guy has a ranged attack which I will assume would be basically true shot and two other powers. This guy has almost no downside. 5 shots even if that is one health stage per shot that could be easy as little as 4 seconds for a down on a survivor. Then you give him two more powers that arguably could be their own powers and each could be seen as overpowered on their own. This would be like having the huntress but she could also put snares on generators that trap survivors until rescued by another survivor and she had a built in spys from the shadows

If you wanted to make a sniper killer I would make it more like this to try and make it balanced. Can only load one bullet at a time though each shot damages one health state if a hit and dying status if it is a head shot. While aiming the killers terror radius is expanded map wide. Shots also considerably slow the survivor on hit for a certain time. The killer starts with one bullet in the chamber and can find 7 more bullets on the map. Survivors can also sabotage bullets in a process like cleansing a totem. If all the bullets on the map are used and/or cleansed  then the sniper then gets a special bullet loaded automatically into the gun that will always grant dying state on a hit and 7 more bullets will appear in random places on the map.
---
11+3+17+20=50. 50√∑4=12.5. Its fair
---
There's nothing more to refute. Making an unblindable killer is a dumb idea unless there some mechanic swap for it.
---
Its an apt comparison for you.
---
Damn it Todd Howard you got me again.
---
Exactly this sounded more like a character for a MOBA than DBD.
---
There are 4 survivors so 4x the pettyness, after a while it's all that killers can respond with.
---
Lol using noed doesn't mean a player is sweaty
---
Only way to find out is to wait.
---
Its actually really funny posting these and seeing comments that can be summed up as "WeLl AcKhTuAlLy..."
---
 
---
Well most killers have gotten good at tunneling and Iron Maiden also reveals aura
---
Idk man. Maybe im dumb but normal dlc in Singapore is $7.50 and if we follow that in USD. It's $16.66. Pretty ex for Asians lol
---
back before mettle of man was updated, i had this ash body blocking because i downed a nea at the exit gate
---
there was a hook like RIGHT THERE and this dumb motherfucker used his mettle of man to take 3 hits
---
Now I want one
---
Eahhh legt for dead brother
---
Good question
---
Also there‚Äôs no way he was still blinded at that point
---
Basically it tells you to gtfo asap. Cuz the danger us coming.
---
I get a little bit aroused every time someone tries to escape by using a straight path with walls.
---
every time the killer looks at you within 36 meters it lights up
---
Classic toxic survivor bullshit from someone who can't take his loss
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cwnsq7/on_xbox_one_anyone_wanna_play_a_few_games_while/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Killer looks at you from set distance, it lights up letting you know, good against spirit.
---
I mean yea, the ranks are a measure of skill.
---
These people are much better at the game then him which is why he died so fast
---
It doesn't show auras, it's a sound notification similar to doctor screams and infectious fright. It shows where they exited the locker, not the direction they went afterwards.
---
explains why she died then
---
see, im stuck in a loop. i stomp on people as killer until rank 7, then i get shit on all the way back to rank 9 or 10 then i get the bad players again, the cycle keeps repeating itself
---
&gt; it'd be nice to offer shards as an alternative more often because it rewards hours put into the game 
---
Yeah but hours in game isn't gonna pay the bill for them, I know people want cosmetics but cosmetics don't add something to the game except for looking good so it's kinda donating some money to the devs to support them.
---
An eye for an eye. It‚Äôs not all they can respond with. I wasn‚Äôt even doing anything in the game that warranted it but once they found me, I‚Äôd be tunnelled until death. Purely because of cosmetics. 
---
That‚Äôs pettiness haha :D
---
I got that one to Achieved on 27 of June, this year at 5:54
---
That‚Äôs what I thought
---
Glad I made the list!  
---
Picture is great quality, just zoom in.
---
You say that like it happens,  an unhook , you get get into a chase, you down the person and still find the other survivir who is now healed, get into a chase, down him and 60 seconds haven't passed. Sorry but it just doesn't happen
---
If it had no cooldown and did it on any hit then a legion could completely regress gens to 0 by just doing what they're supposed to, unless it can't explode a gen that's already been detonated but then that's a cooldown
---
The meme is not the post, the comments are the meme. Big brain time
---
I came (badum Chung) to say the exact same thing.
---
Nurse on console running Noed is like old Freddy running Noed. He was so pathetic as a killer that I'd be more disappointed if he didn't use it
---
The gays love Dead by Daylight
---
Why
---
so sad
---
like my dad
---
Put that thing back where it came from or so help me
---
You guys keep messing around and we'll see evil dead happen for real
---
God that sounds sad, Let‚Äòs play together
---
I've actually never come across a "toxic" Ash. I play on the Xbox and I guess not many people choose him.
---
Made with pure hate made me lol
---
nonce jesus is our saviour
---
Thank you so much for this, I‚Äôm getting inspired
---
I can relate to that.
---
Your pen art is just amazing!
---
Good...good
---
A couple favorites of mine are:
---
- The hell was that?? You knew exactly where I was? Bull. [RE: ... who were you again?] the guy calling you on those sick exploits (context: I HAD BBQ AND CHILI)
---
- reported you 4 going after 1 person (I didn‚Äôt, for context‚ÄîI downed him behind a wall after downing the other survivor I was chasing and he was dumb enough to heal LITERALLY TWO FEET AWAY, I could hear the SC noises)
---
Damn man. Didn't think I would get "got" this fine day. Good show sir good show
---
Thank you :)
---
NSFW tag please, just got fired
---
Do you post elsewhere?
---
Read the fucking title holy shit you're stupid "sirvivor" nothing screams 9 year old like you do, your parents must really love you if they let you play horrorgames before you even have pubes.
---
This is the best insult I have ever seen.
---
I mean 5 swings converts to a wiggle escape. Takes 1 hit injured, take hit with mom, take another hit and syring tech you, take another hit, and then dead hard away.
---
New survivor perk- slap the killers thicc abs and gain 10% extra BP
---
Holy crap this is amazing
---
I really hope with the new friends system, we'll still be able to do this instead of it using a username we can't change :c
---
Serves them right
---
I know right!?
---
What an idiot
---
EVERY SINGLE MATCH HAS A WHINEY SURVIVOR WHO CALLS RUIN OR NOED A CRUTCH PERK BUT THEY RUN ADRENALIN AND DECISIVE STRIKE THINKING ITS BOT AS BAD
---
These are all awful and remind me of CSGO lobbies on dust II back in like 2010.
---
he might‚Äôve been injured but i‚Äôm not joking when i say that the hook was _right there_
---
it was gate threshold, jungle gym pallet, and then the hook
---
the pallet of which he wasted trying to save the nea while i was carrying her
---
Tbh they rlly need to remodel most of the survivors
---
It would be nice if this works with feral frenzy, he can use any boost he can get, I'm doubting it though. Still, legion is good at corraling people to where you want to down them, so that would be a strong point with surge that you won't get with other killers.
---
Honestly
---
i feel like people disconnect beause of frustiation, or if they are fighting an OP killer with OP addons
---
Could it be because of a likeness issue? I played payday 2 a lot and I remember when they added John Wick to that game he looked nothing like Keanu Reeves because they only had the rights to use the character and not Keanu himself.
---
This is amazingly executed
---
At level three you move slightly faster than normal walking
---
 The Redditor is immunized against all dangers: one may call him a scoundrel, parasite, swindler, profiteer, it all runs off him like water off a raincoat. But call him a Redditor and you will be astonished at how he recoils, how injured he is, how he suddenly shrinks back: "Nu-uh".
---
Holy shit man! I love this :D you should put it out for halloween.. and Thanksgiving and christmas.
---
"GGEZ BABY KILLER can't win without Ruin!"
---
Seriously though, feels GOOD. Love how you stick right on the last one for a few seconds, basically T-Posing on their ass to assert dominance
---
Thats another type of mind game "Focus another Surv but in reality you are just there waiting to engage into your real objective"
---
I KNEW IT. AND I STILL FELL FOR IT!!!
---
What is safety pipping?
---
In reality most p3 claudettes are sweat demons like me. Who play fairly, by the way. Don't know what's up with these "immersed p3 claudette posts."
---
goddamnit todd...
---
Woah, this is worthless
---
I didn‚Äôt know he was any where near meüòÇ. Tbh it scared me üòÇ
---
The community manager of BHVR explains why "just run spine chill" isn't a good argument for those defending the Spirit against the masses who are complaining she is overpowered.
---
So: expect a Spirit nerc
---
Yeah good point but you have to think not everyone that browses Netflix will look at their Twitter or if they do they might not even be interested because it's a horror game they're advertising with maybe a show they don't like(like stranger things as a example.)
---
i never chase a survivor that wants to be chased lol i know i'll get looped for 50 gens if i do
---
But I mean the smart uniform in army of darkness
---
*Everytime I close my eyes...*
---
You are not supposed to be able to earn any cosmetics in game.  
---
The only reason iridescent shards exist is so players will defend the store with 'oh but you can earn some stuff for free too!' when someone brings up the fact the store is literally a carbon copy of a mobile game store.
---
The devs pretty much agreed that spirit is OP
---
I try to prevent it them lagging so I run a test before I launch the game and I‚Äôll have like a 15-20 mbps connection and still get called out. I don‚Äôt understand how the game selects regions because it does it really poorly
---
They're probably behind their pc like "NEIN"
---
You do not pip or depip from the game.
---
I usually turn it down so the double sounds don‚Äôt fuck with me
---
but yeah dual monitors rock for stuff like that
---
You really need to read the patch notes cause it was a near complete overhaul.
---
Except it's actually Torture Dance
---
I knew it but still watched it and laughed
---
As gf I use night shroud and go to the walls of the gate so they cant see me. I wait for them to get to basically the opening of the gate (they do it because they're impatient), then hit them with noed.
---
There is such a huge difference in skill at red ranks, its actually insane.
---
I actually think that once all 4 survivors are sick, all of them cleansing is a good move.
---
What's really bad is when you are the very first sick survivor and cleanse.
---
Look at it from plague's point of view. 1 heal that gives you corrupt power? WORTH IT. 4 heal gives you corrupt power? Not so worth it.
---
Man you really don‚Äôt have anything better to do than be a dick on the internet
---
Double dipping for that sweet comment karma OP?
---
Your already getting post karma, don't get greedy by jumping into the comments. It's against reddiquette and leads to downvotes from guys like me ;)
---
Eventually! Next up is Quentin and Laurie though, might pair up Kate and Jeff‚Äôs portraits afterwards
---
Billy my first love. I miss you!! I shouldn‚Äôt have prestiged with no bloodpoints pepehands
---
I havent played dbd in a while... This shit doesn't make me want to go back
---
The thing is, becoming a red rank survivor is super easy, especially if you do SWF. So you have red ranks that are truly amazing, and some bleh ones.
---
Lmfao I hate that I know exactly what game that yasmin is from
---
That is actually a pretty good idea
---
"4head killer"?
---
i mainly play hillbilly but i will switch to survivor, hag or freddy or michael from time to time i dont play many other killers than that
---
A P3 Claudette.
---
Get ruins perk
---
holy fuck the Quentin we have is terrifying
---
Yeah its disgusting
---
Most p3 clauds i face are just pretty non toxic and just solid ass players, fun to go against albeit a bit frustrating. I've run into a couple demon clauds, and honestly i usually run into over immersed megs and kates more than claudettes, but i just say judge people off their gameplay, not their character
---
I knew what this was going to be before I even started watching
---
You can buy every DLC for shards except for the Licensed ones... And no it shouldn't because DLC's give you something usefull (teachables) cosmetics don't. If you don't want to spend money on an outfit don't do it. 
---
If I buy an outfit it's mostly because I want to support the devs. 
---
Outfits don't make you a better player so it's not a big deal if you can only pay real money for it.
---
I enjoy when the OP replies to my comments, so I tend to do it too ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
But then she has 4 pools to recharge at. Best advice is to hope she doesn‚Äôt have the addon that shows auras every time you puke and just sit on a gen. She can‚Äôt kill everyone in the time it takes to finish them and she‚Äôll be struggling hard to secure the downs she does get the entire match because she‚Äôll be a basic M1 killer. Best time to cleanse is when you‚Äôre on death hook or you‚Äôre put in a forced situation where you need to save someone where she‚Äôs patrolling. If you are going to cleanse cleanse as far as possible away from any unfinished gens and try to do it when she‚Äôs mid chase so she would have to break it to get her ranged down. Wait out her timer and hide in the meantime.
---
Still gives her 4 pools to take her power from, still dont think its worth
---
Illfonic one of the teams that worked on Friday the 13th is making an asymmetrical survival game similar to DBD/Friday, but much more shooter based. They just released gameplay of it last week. Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt look all that great. :/
---
Oh I see
---
And get totem cleansed
---
I think there would be some sort of function that would force the demigorgon out.
---
the worst thing is when there are 4 sick survivors and one of them cleanses on the middle fountain and then gets back on an infected gen
---
Thank you so much!! My first gold ever!
---
Just for you :3
---
Survivor: James Sunderland
---
Killer: Pyramid head
---
Map: Brookhaven hospital
---
BHVR pls
---
The bait was real üò≠
---
Motherfucker, as soon as the screen stayed black for that fraction of a second I knew what was coming.
---
These aren't funny, just cringe.
---
Well **holy shit** are edgy fuckers like that guy SERIOUSLY being dicks about people commentjng on their own posts?
---
Sure! Just credit me in the comments :)
---
You: \*Does some boss ass shit to save two people and escape while injured\*
---
Premonition Perk: "Don't worry bro, I got this. He's THERE!"
---
Aw thanks, I love your drawings, they perfectly capture both the essence of the meme and the game. You truly are the second coming of zombiehugger
---
Don‚Äôt listen to this guy lol, no idea what his problem is.
---
If you got a 4K and still depip, then you one hooked everyone and had a really boring/fast game. I bet everyone depipped that game. 
---
If you get no kills and still pip then you had to have had a more interesting game. Many books and chases and gen halting. 
---
Getting a 4K is not a defined measurement of skill anymore. If it were, we would all just be slugging people with Infectious Fright and ending games in 3 minutes.
---
Yes, my instagram handle is on the drawings ;)
---
Yes some times it does get cleansed, but the point of it is to buy you some time to get at least the first hook, anything after that is a bonus.
---
He looks like a crack-addled Steve Buscemi
---
Tis' my friday plans
---
That is very true. 
---
Played alot with my friend last month, he got rank 1. He cant flashlight save, pallet save or any of the "hard" mechanics.
---
Started work on it after reading your comment on my last post :) Thanks for the inspiration!
---
At first I thought this was the ptb then I realised it's from the dev stream :(
---
Damn you toxic swf, killers were fine until you came along. The entity was nice and lazy. But if they hadn‚Äôt been chasing you I could‚Äôve rushed that gen and been halfway to Lery‚Äôs
---
Shhh
---
That first Pallet kick made me cringe really hard
---
Yeah that's actually the main reason I bought a second monitor. That and I wanted to watch youtube while doing school stuff or play singleplayer games. But I turn the volume down. And it did help because I could see if they were doing a gen or if they were getting chased. But now that I run bond I don't do it a lot.
---
I mostly play trapper
---
AH! No problem! Thank you for making great artwork!
---
DERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
---
Billy is the most annoying to me. Insane map pressure with full speed and an instadown.
---
Survivors get toxic when people play spirit, including me, and I‚Äôm primarily a killer main
---
I can see my first rage dc coming after being looped for 5 gens by bazinga.
---
"I m from rorikstead"
---
The lack of borrowed time when you saved the hooked guy... In front of a killer...
---
It scared me.
---
Remember kids, if you DC under any circumstances, excluding obvious blatant cheaters, you are scum, and deserve whatever you get in your coming matches
---
it will cost exactly 11.99$ its on the dead by daylight reddit front page with this [source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/stranger-things-demogorgon-coming-to-horror-game-dead-by-daylight/)
---
Maybe try the gen to gen method with Billy and see if it works better with him since he's quicker. I dont play a lot of Trapper except for dailies so I'm not sure the best strat for him besides sneaky traps
---
 i think it should be once every two months probably
---
I do this and if they face camp I ask why they do it and if they explain I still say gg
---
&gt;Imagine you can choose to have a 'story' match, and the survivors who escape are in a small cutscene where they escape for real. Replayable, obviously.
---
i liked that chapter in L4D too :)
---
that said, we probably have more than 2 years of DBD. iirc the devs have at least a couple or more years on the planning road for creation of more content
---
Most likely Survive with friends team.
---
This means I can get the scoops and the pack!
---
I was able to zoom in on my phone and read each of them, some of them were cut off the edge of the page for some reason but I zoomed back out a little and could read them.
---
She can be countered if you know how to. Most people just resort to looping and it just doesn‚Äôt work and then they complain she‚Äôs not counterable
---
YOU SON OF A BITCH...
---
As an ash main I can confirm that we use head on and DS at the same time after being hooked.
---
They were going for rescues seconds after getting them on the hook,what was I to do?
---
And flashlight would be green or yellow? Also, what would be the other combo?
---
If more survivors played as each killer at least a few times, they‚Äôd be doing themselves and their teammates a service. 
---
Unless it‚Äôs an easy counter most survivors have no idea what they are up against. I can‚Äôt count how many times players would know it was legion and still want to hop on my gen.
---
THANK YOY I REALLY NEEDED THIS MOTIVATION
---
Well if this is subjective and based on personal opinion then for me it would be Clown. As a selfconsidered good survivor, Clown is the most annoying killer for me. That's not to say he is super powerful or unbeatable, I just dont care to go against a good clown.
---
You dont, you go walking speed
---
We're all brothers and sisters in dying state now, locker-boy.
---
THE ONLY KILLER I ENJOY PLAYING IS DOCTOR AND I CAN‚ÄôT GET BBQ ON HIM
---
If you use the "hide chat" button in 'Kill Your Friends' the game will remember your preference even after shutting down.
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt help quite a bit
---
Many people underestimate trapper, but I think he is annoying. You have to watch out for both traps and the killer's movements during chases. Very stressful
---
Had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
What others have said.  Also, with Trapper, have you tried prepping half the map with traps, then chasing survivors toward the playhouse of fun?
---
Yesterday me and my 2 other friends were having a game where we just finished repairing the third generator and our random person got downed by legion and he/she disconnected.It was even his or her first down.I had a lot of similar situations like this lately.I just don't understand why.
---
Congrats, you'll regret it! :)
---
Ruin is not within the parameters of the fundamentals of being a good killer.
---
Well yes but I like to play a lot of killers so I would like to know non-specific tips
---
Vaulting is what keeps the loop goings, since the killer can only slow vault. But this can also be baited by the killer to vault a one way window and mess yourself up.
---
Dont drop the pallet straight away, learn how to run a TL wall, Jungle gym and the shack.  Literally run around the pallet and the obstacle 2 to 3 times before you drop the pallet, you can run more times if the killer doesnt try to swing through the pallet. Watch streamers and youtubers. thats how i learnt loops and how to run certain obstacles better.
---
Broski, 105 meters a second?
---
Whenever you crouch when within 8 meters of the killer during a chase, both you and the killer receive a 1% Haste status effect until the chase ends, up to a maximum of 5%/10%/15%. 
---
In addition, whenever you begin a chase with the killer, reveal your aura and the killer‚Äôs aura to all other survivors for 15 seconds.
---
Holy SHIT
---
What is Noted?
---
Me with the only possible short skirt of Meg with a croppet feeling super hot
---
Step 1: take left behind
---
Step 2: take wake up
---
Step 3: let the killer kill your teammates, if you can try to have 1 Gen left with progress on it when the 3rd person dies
---
Step 4: get lucky gates and escape with wake up (you can also fake out a door by getting it to one light then sneaking away to go to the other door while they try to find where you're hiding at the first door)
---
‚ÄúHex: Devour pussy‚Äù is literally an a username that I‚Äôve seen alot of times on this sub. Bitch is famous
---
Doctor isn't the strongest but a 3-gen Doc is annoying and can quite literally result in survivors flat out giving themselves up once they realize you're 3-genning.
---
So far I'm not, I can definitely tell the difference from these players and green rank players. Surprisingly not seeing any swf groups, also the games are definitely longer. I'm used to 10 minute games, it's easily 20 minute games now. The only downside is the longer wait time for a lobby. :']
---
Try **walking** to that wall away from the jungle gym and hide behind it so she can‚Äôt find your scratchmarks
---
Can confirm. I am rank 1 and i very rarely flashlight or pallet save. I can't 360. I am mediocre at looping by red ranks standards. I miss most great skill checks.
---
If that were true, why would reddit specifically denote the OP when they leave a comment?
---
The top picture looks better lol. Why is the background all orange now? Looks really bad compared to the top.
---
Says the dude bitching lol
---
I watch it afterwards to see from their perspective and analyze how the round played out. 
---
And clip the Mori if I Mori them.
---
Godammit i knew it was gonna be a skyrim meme xD
---
Mind games
---
I dunno, man. The last few nurses I've gone against have been PC tier. Kind of refreshing and scary.
---
this fucking image is hillarious
---
I just realized that fixated is gonna be amazing against spirit and that she won't be as awful when Nancy is out. I know you can still play against spirit with certain tricks but it doesn't change the fact that in the end it's very unfun to play against
---
They were released a couple of hours ago. Wednesday mornings, usually between 9-11am EST which is when they were this week as well.
---
fyi, that "n" looks like an "h" to dumbasses like me. :P
---
I don't know why interacting with the fake pallets doesn't give you points.
---
Say if you went asleep away from freddy and you find a pallet that you think is fake. If you throw it, you could get like 100-200 survival points with a "Faced your nightmares" score event or something like that.
---
Please give me a solid example of a mind game you did that was successful (this isn‚Äôt me being a dick, I just genuinely want examples so I can improve)
---
Because you can aim better on a mouse.
---
a lot of survivor mains tend to be really over reliant on pallets and looping, thus why phantom pallet freddy is often complained about, despite being the weaker variety of freddy.
---
You misspelled sirvivers
---
Hard to be good at.
---
So hawt
---
Heck you man... good meme tho :)
---
Gotta love insidious. It's like the killers Diversion
---
**noted**
---
For the 87th time today, yes.
---
Whispers is a great tracking perk and most definitely the all around the best killer perk in the game. If you run whispers, though _make absolutely certain you are running it in tier 3._ Tiers 1 and 2 offer little to no help and they're pretty much a waste of a perk slot
---
Relatable about the queues.
---
All hexes is usually not a good thing XD
---
r/terriblefacebookmemes
---
Or the survivor side, 
---
Ok guys I think I found his ruin, give me one sec 
---
#exposed 
---
Well gentlemen, synchronize your death watches.
---
so did you
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs better on killers that can reach the gen in time such as demogorgan, nurse, hillbilly, and sometimes hag
---
You have zero understanding of map pressure if you don't understand what I'm saying.  1 hp doesn't matter if the survivor is good enough to loop you.  A Plague tried tunneling me off hook yesterday it cost her 4 gens and a 3 man escape.  3 person escape because she tunneled me off hook and I ran her while the randoms cranked out gens.  Over committing to chases and tunneling off hook are two of the biggest flaws in a babykillers game.  It costs you games against strong survivors man.  Again what rank are you playing at where d strike buys 15 seconds.  It sounds like you play at weaker ranks where tunneling is safe to do.  Strong survivors will punish that shit man.
---
That‚Äôs the meme
---
It already is shirtless though...???
---
Are you trolling or?
---
Shhhh
---
This, same thing with Huntress
---
When I asked was only considering from a suvivor point of view which I dont really think would be abusing streams unless you were doing to it to try and lead the killer to them, but assuming you were playing properly you seeing their view would likely help everyone overall as you can better use your time efficiently.
---
From a killers side though as i said in a different reply I would def say it is getting too close to cheating to do it then
---
Here, have my damn angry upvote
---
WHAT DID YOU FUCKING SAY, I DONT KNOW HOW TO READ BELOW 140 DECIBELS
---
It‚Äôs all up to mindgames at that point. Spirit is that guy with the good hand in poker but you don‚Äôt know it yet. Do you fold or call their bluff? Folding is to find a way out of that chase while calling is to expect them to choose a specific side of a pathway and cut you off.
---
You know a meme is dead when you know the punchline the moment the video starts.
---
Billy. Huge hitbox, can cross the map in seconds to tunnel, easy to hit unlimited instadowns all with no cooldown. If you‚Äôre not in red ranks then expect even a noob bully to destroy your team. You NEED survivors that can evade him for a while.
---
Ghostface too. The reveal mechanic is straight up broken. Cant believe they left this garbage the way it is. Theres literally no point trying to break him out of his shroud because theres a 99% chance it wont work.
---
Then legion because...well its legion. He gets a free hit on you then you either hold m1 all game to mend/heal or you stay exposed the whole game.
---
These 3 are the 3 i can not cope with. Id be better off not playing the game. They just suck all the fun right out of it.
---
Also 3 of the most common to run NOED
---
I crouch ducked a hatchet last night and felt like a boss. Then immediately after I got drilled in the back of the head with a second one.
---
Yeah, I wouldn't be use to it. I mean, look at the difference between the two (the one in the actual game for example looks like he has a bigger skull than the edited)
---
And Quentin in an actual trial doesn't actually look too bad compared to quite a bit of the other survivors in game, especially with the p3 head.
---
Sooo OP's are not allowed to answer comments and questions to their own posts?
---
Wait.  I play on console.  What the fuck do I care about the PTB?
---
Just dump bps into her. Play as lets say, Trapper. You farm up and then all those points are dumped into Spirit. Thats what I did with my trapper so I could get his teachables.
---
If amount of experience counts for nothing, it's fair. I would bet (with funny munny of course) the rank 2 has more hours of play than the rest of the players combined.
---
Frame rate is trash on console
---
Do you sell these?
---
I hope this meme never dies.
---
Mirage in DbD confirmed
---
Watch your tongue! That‚Äôs a Jake with Saboteur your speaking to.
---
Lmao, found the kid that hook bombs his teammates, then cries in post game chat because the killer didn‚Äôt play along with his horrible attempt at a rescue. FeelsRank20Man.
---
I suppose
---
Me too. Been trying to find KokeHotto for 10 minutes now.
---
I'm a red rank killer who plays mostly Billy and Bing-Bong and for whatever reason I _cannot_ get the hang of Spirit
---
No your good. It‚Äôs all about knowing when to wack or rev it up. Learning how to mind game in general helps. For example I watch true talent and I try to do that. A good mind game is like billy rev up for a second before a pallet, the survivor will run through and then You chase them just like billy. Just when smacking  knowing how to walk backwards predict a surviver can do a lot. Or moonwalking while chainsawing also works. Hard to explain in a post. Honestly watching killer main streamers helps a lot. Also like trapper hearing survivors in areas without pallets helps big time.
---
This is why you got negative 95 karma on comments.
---
Watch your tongue! You're speaking to P3 Claudette, the true invisible queen.
---
It isn‚Äôt. It used to be terrible
---
r/uselessnobody
---
I think it would be neat that- just like killer can open doors, they could close them too to force every survivor there to escape. The entity comes from the escape hall and pull all the survivors there out. The door inmediately opens after that and it has a cooldown time so killers cant exploit it. Just a "get out already" from the entity
---
It's all about aiming the blinks and the sensitivity.  It's much easier on PC.  Even when the sensitivity is cranked up to 100% on console, it's impossible to flick her to get a whack on a survivor who has turned the other direction.  
---
In addition, there's lower framerates and the picture quality is sub standard, making it much easier to lose survivors or have them break line of sight.
---
Oh wow this looks great!
---
I hope this doesn't awaken something in me...
---
I rarely see legions anymore, so I do almost enjoy playing against them, until I realize none of them actually know how to use his power, and it‚Äôs all downhill from there
---
&gt;Is there a problem with matchmaking?
---
Yes. Did it really take you that long to figure out?
---
There is an imbalance of people who play survivor vs the people who play killer. There are lesser people who play survivor due to how difficult it has become to escape or gain bloodpoints. Doesn't help that the game itself demands that more people should play survivor because it's 4vs1.
---
I myself got paired against a level 9 killer on my first match.
---
To survivors, you're bad no matter what you do. Try not to take it personal. I know it's hard but in the end you took the win and they took the L that's all that matters.
---
(Laughs in Play With Your Food)
---
So did Monto steal this from Reddit, or did Reddit steal this from Monto?
---
LMAO i ended up just searching for images tagged with #theclown and scrolling back until i found this image. felt real silly.
---
Thanks for the help üëç
---
Destruction of a portal when he inters it probably resets to 0, either that or destruction doesn't save.
---
Saw this coming a mile away ;)
---
I stole this from monto
---
I absolutely miss the shit out of old Freddy.  He went from being my go to killer to simply another killer in my rotation post rework.  Most of the people hating on him back then were people that had no idea how to play him and just used him as a mindless M1 killer to tunnel the same person with.  He was so good at juggling, loads of information always available allowing to track the group, and the Spoopy plays!  Even without addons you could play him as a jump scare ambush killer simply with perks.  Really miss Frederick.
---
Nopr
---
Well played boys
---
Ah ty the spirit can be quite annoying but never overly broken unless she's using prayer beads
---
she is the prettiest survivor and my vavorite
---
YOU DO IT NY ALTERNATING BETWEEN KILLER AND SURVIVOR BETWEEN RANK RESETS, SO YOU DON'T RANK UP TOO MUCH TOO QUICKLY.
---
Act like youre being friendly then wreck them
---
Wait.... really?
---
Agreed I got a 2 kill while doing daily on Xbox yesterday  hard to play but still ok in green ranks
---
Yeah I think every two months would be better than every month I think. 
---
At least you recognize that there has to be some way to derank people built into the system.
---
I saw another post where purple ranks and a red rank got a rank 17 killer
---
I facecamp. I don‚Äôt care if the others get the generators because I know that even the best killers don‚Äôt kill all 4 survs. As long as I can guarantee a kill or two that‚Äôs a win in my book.
---
Lmfao. And that dwight over there. everyone shits on dwight :/ no wonder he has a helmet.
---
Jake the Saboteur? But you're the one that sabo-ed all the hooks around here and almost made the killer disconnect...
---
Good shit
---
Chill out, jesus. I hope you know that this tantrum is like, just as bad if not worse than what you are complaining about?

They have that.

It's called every game ever

No, seriously, BHVR do something for these lobbies.

I‚Äôve gotten her just into red ranks, but shortly after I feel I just flounder and need to switch to a more consistent killer(s).
---
WHEN THIS GAME FIRST CAME OUT ALL I WANTED WAS A COOL GRUDGE KILLER LIKE SAMARA OR KAYAKO SO WHEN THE SPIRIT AKA MISS RIN YAMAOKA WAS RELEASED I WAS SO EXCITED TO FINALLY PLAY THAT UNCANNY BONE CRACKLING SWORD WACKING HEINOUS HYSTERICAL GHOST GIRL I SAVED UP MY SHARDS I GOT THE COOL KIMONO I GOT THE FACE TATS I HAD HER DRESSED FOR THE GODS I WENT OUT THERE WITH MY MONITOR&amp;ABUSE AND UNRELENTING FURY AND TAUGHT MYSELF HOW TO PLAY A GOOD MEAN HOWLING HATE-FILLED GIRL FROM HELL, CATCH ME SPOTTING YOUR SURVIVOR ASS FROM A DISTANCE MAKING SPOOKY PLAYS BEING ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE AT ONCE BEING A WHISPER IN THE DISTANCE AND THEN A SCREAM IN THE NIGHT I DID IT I MADE MY DREAM COME TRUE AND NOW I HEAR THAT SHE'S WHAT OH SHE'S UNFUN TO PLAY AGAINST WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I'M NOT GOING TO STOP I LOVE THIS MEAN ASS GHOST GIRL AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU CAN TALK TO MY WAKIZASHA SAYA SMH I'M HURT
---
I fucking hate you in the best way
---
No learning Nurse on console is harder.  Once you do you spank survivors just like the PC ones.  I've played against top tier PS4 nurses that ran shit in their games.  And if you're attempting to learn Nurse 3 blink and NOED ain't gonna teach you anything.
---
Is that a mother.fucking.jo.jo.reference?
---
I really like the outfit! The hair is kind of scraggly, but the outfit pairs nice with her green hair and pixie hair cosmetics. Hopefully the hair gets an update in the future to add more body.
---
MU? They increased his speed but made it so you couldnt double hit people. They increased that stun thin to fucking 4 seconds. I think the deep wound is connected to terror radius not chase now so it only goes down if you leave the terror radius. Some other stuff I'm forgetting
---
And the suspence of some traps around the corner makes the game more exciting. Trapper is one of the killers that makes me feel like being pressured. Obviously playing swf ruins the character as one survivor gets the info of traps everyone can avoid them.
---
Someone woke up from his nap early
---
True it means they're bad.
---
i did the same
---
Holy shit I never realized how bad I wanted a resident evil one. They could easily have Leon and Mr. X, or more likely Jill and Nemesis if they decide to do the RE3R

---
Lmfao when people say that i just hit em with the "who died" or "hold that L"
---
Lmao
---
I assume it's like Freddy being able to teleport to a gen as long as he starts teleporting before it gets finished.
---
That's pretty much it. Just a weird dance scene. It stuck out in the anime since they took the time to creatively animate and add a song to it, since in the manga it was just 4 panels. JoJo as a series itself is also very memeable so things like that lend itself well to getting memed.
---
It really messes up the experience for your teammates, too.
---
Or, players, especially from the survivor side, are dropping the game.
---
Rip
---
the last 3 days it seems this has gotten worse. More then likely they are adjusting things on their side and testing things out.
---
That‚Äôs why I hook suicide instead, killer gets his kill, team doesn‚Äôt get to rely on my ass being bait if all they do is try to hook rescue, and I get to go into other matches.
---
Not me personally as I said havent tried it before nor could I do it unless I swapped out my RAM or run the risk of crashing at any moment.
---
Was just asking for others experience or views on it, but from your list all of those benefits would also be gained by just talking in discord with a swf group.
---
When is this shit gonna stop then I'm just highlighting the bs
---
wraith and huntress whould be cutie tier
---
If they‚Äôve captured you... oh entity, where is Bubba taking us?
---
Woah someone got a salt message or is the messenger
---
Congratulations! Enjoy your stay in hell, though you probably won't
---
What bruh. I'm highlighting the trash in this community say
---
Perk wise, something that might help and a perk that I think is underrated is Bloodhound. Just follow the blood tracks and you can find people no problem.
---
Can hag warp cross map instantly? Or isn't there a limited range?
---
no u üò≥
---
Yeah it sucks. Then I played the game and got yelled at for playing the game
---
Aren‚Äôt hex totem sounds bugged now?  I routinely never hear anything, even if I‚Äôm the one destroying the totem, and never know when ruin is gone.
---
No of course not. Survivors need to at least TRY to make safe unhooks. That being said, if I am the killer in that scenario, I will generally go for the person who did the safe unhook (because I know how shitty it feels to be a survivor farmed off the hook by your team, only to get downed and hooked again right away).
---
Sounds like someone also didn't finish his bottle
---
Constant salt messages lol. It's not just that it's just how some people could be this pathetic to say shit like this and think they're right.
---
iirc in the show one of them recoils when a bunch of light is put on them. They are also hypersensitive to heat, at least the mindflayer is.
---
My door strategy is to make it till there's still no light, but you're almost 20% done. That way the next time the killer leaves you can do the full 80% in peace.
---
This is why I try to help sometimes in messages if one of the survivors are rookies after I get a 4K.
---
I have a friend that‚Äôs an ash main just so he could say ‚Äúlook who‚Äôs shitting in the tall grass‚Äù constantly in game.
---
Na I dont drink. Never started the bottle in the first place.
---
Mikey and tum tums are the only ones I agree with
---
This meme is so overused that you can guess what happens from the title
---
Doesn‚Äôt make this anymore justifiable giving them the attention is what they want
---
Pack it up, lads, we‚Äôre done here.
---
I knew it
---
I would definitely agree with this. You have Bubba, who is utter dogshit and Freddy who is definitely A-tier now. The only one even close to Myers-level balance is Ghostface.
---
It also probably was helped in memeable status because they were dancing while torturing a severed head with sun beams
---
Oh look endgame collapse

Thats a twist

I fucking knew it was going to be this and I still fell for it god damn it OP.
---
...and then the match is over in almost immediately and ya got to wait AGAIN.
---
Hey look a pissed off killer
---
&gt;If there is a high demand for something why would they make it for free?
---
I didn't say anything like cosmetics should be free, so not sure why you're asking that?  
---
My argument is the store uses the  manipulative tactics that mobile game stores use. Iridescent shards are designed to test peoples patience so they'll open their wallet. Auric cells are designed to detach customers from a direct dollar sign which has been psychologically proven to make consumers more susceptible to spending large amounts of money on microtransactions.  
---
[https://pasteboard.co/IuP0SdW.jpg](https://pasteboard.co/IuP0SdW.jpg) &lt;- this cosmetic alone is half the cost of the entire game. But they know how important they are so they will try to charge that much. This is not ethically priced.
---
Yet this reddit defends it like they need to make a single outfit that much or the devs wont be able to afford to feed their kids which is categorically not true (as much as I'm sure devs would LOVE to have their paycheck go up based on how many MTX's sold, but that's not how it works).  
---
Just make a direct, honest store. No mobile game currencies,  more reasonable pricing. You don't need to charge $5 for a pair of virtual sunglasses to survive.
---
I don't know where are we going, but the Entity awaits...
---
Why is that literally not giving them a reaction makes it so that they have nothing to fuel the fire and an argument doesn‚Äôt happen...?
---
My internet crapped out once and made me dc from the game just as a huntress was about to find me crawling around. It would have been my third hook. I felt so shitty, and there‚Äôs literally no way she would think it *wasn‚Äôt* an intentional dc. I wish I‚Äôd known her username so I could have apologized and told her I didn‚Äôt do it to be salty, she played great and fully deserved the sacrifice bp.
---
The actual video, yes. The song? No.
---
Try out the Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher, Stridor(if you use headphones) and the Legion Pin. At a glance the Legion Pin seems pretty useless since you are not inclined to normally double hit someone in frenzy but after you hit everyone or if you know you won't reach another target, the extra 60 seconds (it's really like 30 after they mend) you get with them broken can be a great stalling tactic, essentially making it a 3 man game for a short period. Stacking a slow heal from Sloppy makes Nurse's Calling that much better. I was running Surveillance or Discordance for tracking but switching to Stidor has given me a lot better results considering how often people are injured.
---
Tuft of hair and Tombstone Myers will depip by default. If you do it the meta way (no hits, because of PWYF)
---
Oh man I'd feel so bad if I had that. Honestly I hate bullying baby survivors because they might honestly quit the game because of it and God knows this game needs more players
---
Franklin's Demise is a decent perk to use when survivors all have items.
---
Bubba himself isn't a great Killer but he is fun to play from time to time.
---
I'd grinded my LF to 40 2 days before bbq went into the shrine, guess I'll take my bloodpoints and cry
---
I assumed they diddnt have the rights. Thank you for clarifying though.
---
Yes, cause cherry picking a Streamer that has over 5000 hours in DBD is a great example of the normal player base.
---
no one cares jeremy
---
I don‚Äôt get it what‚Äôs wrong?
---
Tbh as an ash main i only got him for MoM and even when it got nerfed to high hell i still mained him for his overall character arc and because his prestige clothes are quite good.(not to mention ashy slashy).
---
Idk what you mean, the original is Devine
---
But Young Ash is a possibility. Like Evil Dead 1 &amp; 2
---
Wait wait wait, perma non totem NOED?
---
Yea exactly, but I really think discordance is really good. Even if it make the survivors work in different gens, its also good.
---
Reddiquitte is a thing
---
Reddiquette is real but this isn‚Äôt part of it
---
I just saw it posted by ChattyWindow
---
I feel bad for killers. I sent a msg once to tell one how awesome she‚Äôd played and she said ‚ÄúThanks! Usually people just tell me they fucked my mom after a match, so this was nice to get!‚Äù
---
i knew it was coming and i still fucking fell for it
---
I do it to killers that played like filth only.  The rest I just stand motionless and offer them parting points in Deviousness or Brutality if they want it.
---
i had to take a break after every match when I played him.  It was just too mentally exhausting.  While I actually enjoyed old Fredster and would actually do well with him, I could only play 2-3 matches, max, with him each sitting.  While I do miss him and all his 32k games, I agree with you totally.  Also, new Freddy is a blast.
---
Wait really... I really want that now
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Now enjoy the sweatiest of the tryhards as your reward. Purple ranks truly are peak enjoyment in dbd
---
Yea but Im not talking about the devs, Im talkimg about him. Not because I disagree, but because he is as polite as you can see in the title. I really wish they rework spirit and make her a stealth killer beacuse those are my favorite ones :p
---
I only got him for MoM but after the nerfed him i sticked to maining David .
---
so where‚Äôs the link
---
Website is https://dbd.onteh.net.au they have dbd pc lobbies and I found 2 developers searching for games on the their private ptb build. PTB might be coming soon, or theyre testing.
---
IN 15 MINUTES!
---
As others have said, Ghostface can be countered rather easily. He needs a complete revamp. I prefer the stalk killers, so he's right up my alley and don't think the quick T3 is worth it when you can end it just as fast. When Reveal is working properly he's really easy to counter.  That won't happen with Myers unless he totally loses you. 
---
Even though I don't play as her, I feel the Pig would be the next best balanced killer, but most players play as her wrong too. She was given traps for a reason and it wasn't to tunnel the same survivor over and over again until they are out of the match. She's easy to beat for that reason. A good Pig let's the traps do their thing and goes after the gens. You can only be so lucky getting them off on the first try.
---
fucking lol if you think they "confirmed they consider spirit OP"
---
also hi OP's main account
---
But u cant make ie permanent, maybe give it a 5/7.5/ 10 min duration at start? Like the plague perk?
---
Oh, I didn't actually know they tried that. I play on PS4 so I'm not familiar with the usual minor changes they add to the ptb. But still, I hope they at least make it so protection hits actually count when they say they do
---
Dont believe everything you read online.
---
As a Killer main, I find them in the following order from easiest to get a TPK to Hardest.
---
Pig
---
Mike
---
Hag
---
Trapper
---
Plague
---
Nightmare
---
Ghost Face
---
Cannibal
---
Spirit
---
Doctor
---
Huntress
---
Hillbilly
---
Clown
---
Nurse
---
Wraith
---
(not enough time with Legion to judge)
---
Please explain. Curve? Backrev?
---
I agree. MoM is terrible rn. Sometimes I end up with 0 stacks unless I let a killer smack me while holding a survivor. If it stacked the same way as WGLF I dont think itll be as broken as before for sure, but wonder if it may be too strong. Would love to see the change on the ptb for a bit
---
That happened to me as survivor
---
Thanks for the response 
---
Follow up question, for me part of the fun is the chase,  do you not particularly care about just standing still for a few minutes in game or get no thrill of chasing
---
I generally like Ash players, just like Bills they play in character and are rarely selfish. Still, douchebags creep into all the character skins.
---
They are right now lobbies just fluctuate wait until they take out the ability for higher rank killers to play with lower survivors unless it's a swf that has a high rank
---
Damn that was a good episode
---
spine chill
---
What is 3-genning?
---
I like chasing, but I like to think of standing there watching the survs struggle as a reward for the chase
---
Pretty sure the Chapter launch date is already set.  Unrelated to the PTB.
---
Thats a really potato freddy
---
By that logic dbd ripped off every hide and seek game ever
---
Thought I was on R6 subreddit for a sec and that this was God Awful bait
---
Ffff
---
Doesnt the perk only activate on hex totems, not dull ones?
---
Curve is a move that experienced Billies can do with the saw. When starting a chainsaw sprint, you have a second of higher turning sensitivity, which is known as _initial turning sense._ You can time a saw to curve around a corner and catch a survivor off guard to get an easy chainsaw. It's a difficult trick to master but I've found it can be particularly devastating for survivors who aren't experienced enough to counter. 
---
Backrevving is a lot simpler. A backrev is where a Billy gets right behind a survivor and revs his chainsaw and gets an ez chainsaw on the survivor
---
What exactly is Spirit‚Äôs ability?
---
Hahahahahha
---
With "free" I meant that you didn't have to pay for it.
---
Best comment award goes to you
---
i think his power is very inconsistent and buggy, sometimes ill be looking right at him and it wont expose him other times i expose him yet get i still get exposed myself.
---
I... we're gonna winnnnnnn
---
Everyone is using it too. Or at least it seems like it.
---
I played against a Myers who ran a Hex, BnC and A Nurse's Calling. Once we popped the totem, it was over for him. We all escaped. Hopefully more players will see that BnC is not what it's cracked up to be and start using better perks and getting better at the game. Leatherface needs that shit to win, I feel it hampers other killers ‚Ä¶ especially Myers. 
---
It's a given now that everyone who's not within range is hiding in a closet during a hook.
---
Gotcha
---
Survivor spelt wrong two different ways in one meme wowie
---
Wow, very original post! It‚Äôs not like the same exact thing was posted a few hours ago!
---
This is cute and necessary
---
Premonition is just a BTech version of Spine Chill
---
&gt;!BTech is a company that makes rip-off products incase you didn't know.!&lt;
---
Yup prob. No hooks. Tombstone Meyers problems.
---
Hex names are so fun hahahah xddddd
---
Impossible and its a bronze trophy ROFL

Wow that's sensible and necessary :( Geez why people gotta be such jerkos!
---
I'm not gonna lie, I thought the same. I was wait "Wait what".
---
If I'm doing well in ~The Game~ Reddit karma, I'm doing well in life!
---
How was that a rant?

Inconsistent as shit and him being T-bagging smol boi makes it a little bit better.
---
TUNNEL HARDER, BABY KILLER
---
sadly not the same map
---
You need 4 times as many survivors as killer in order to find a match
---
Say roughly half the community plays survivor, and the other half plays killer. If one survivor gets paired up with one killer, then three other survivors also get paired up with that same killer, leaving three other killers each waiting for their own 4 survivors. Survivors are 4 times as likely to find an open lobby as killers are
---
Think of a college sorority, with four girls all having sex with each other, plus one guy. There would be a waiting list for guys to get in on the action, while these four girls would *constantly* be having sex. Same idea
---
I generally save 2 slots for bbq and ruin. But I like using thanatiphobia and sloppy for the slow heal I actually like double hitting more than I like to admit. Because its puts pressure on them to mend and I cant tell you how many times they fell because they forgot to mend fast enough.
---
Using tm that way is a joke/meme that has been around for decades. It's basically just a funny way to ironically say "we say this so much we've trademarked it"
---
God I feel old.
---
It's like if someone on reddit says "We did it!^tm "
---
Well, yeah sometimes the hitboxes on detecting him are weird. 
---
This Youtuber explains him quite well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkDyYBg5oYw
---
anti slugging perks like flipflop are super effective if you play swf. soon as you're going down, have your teammates come annoy tf out of the killer to entice the killer to leave you and go for them instead. by the time they get to you you get a most of your wigle meter up alread and you can pair it with boil over too to make it more narly.
---
Unless you're a programmer, then you overflowed.
---
Yeah I prefer the pallets just for the fun factor of respecting a fake pallet then just swinging right though it
---
I love them, but this looks solid.
---
Haha so funny and totally unexpected, not a dead meme.
---
People can do what they want, jeez
---
My frustration is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
L
---
Damnit.
---
I fuckin knew it
---
It‚Äôs a very popular hex perk.
---
yeah stealth is counter but in terms of looping you cant out loop them
---
Without the ultra rare hag can‚Äôt teleport to her traps as she sees fit, that makes a huge difference imo cause the demogorgon basically has map pressure on the entire map if it sets its traps right, unlike hag who you can crouch her traps to make her have to run the entire length of the map to you after like discordance or bbq. 
---
It‚Äôs hardly just a copy paste because traps and teleportation.
---
Legion isn‚Äôt entirely terrible IMO. Even at green ranks from what I‚Äôve played with them, they‚Äôre still pretty solid, especially against people with sprint burst. However, they do suffer severely in the lethality department. If you‚Äôre not running Frank‚Äôs Mixtape or Legion Pin, their potential gets severely reduced. They really do just need some sort of buff, or even a full rework.
---
Dwight you ignorant slut.
---
For sure they are a ton of fun, but the more Ive played freddy, the more Ive come to appreciate the snares. They make Freddy pretty much unloopable. The survivor has to keep moving from place to place or they'll hit a snare and he'll catch up, because theres no slowdown on placing them, so you can be scattering them along the path as you chase.
---
Yeah, it's a terrible bug that needs to be patched asap
---
GODDAMMIT
---
There we go. Thirteen hours later and exactly two comments actually understand the meme lol.
---
Dead hard helps since if you make a mistake it can negate your mistake
---
I think that this is incorrect, like I can get scared shitless cause scratched mirror Myers flew round the corner in Lery's because he could see me, but I couldn't see him, and spinechill and stuff like that doesn't work with T1 Myers, alongside no red stain but with Wraith, spine chill will go off, and other aura reading/detection perks alerting me to his presence, and so while I don't hear the bell, I'll be on high alert and probably see him uncloak, and once he is uncloaked the terror radius and red stain will be there, plus mirror Myers is 32 metres if I'm correct, but for Wraith with those addons it's only 12 metres.
---
Trapping players in a 10 minute cinematic is way too op.
---
Yes, that's actually a nea exclusive strategy, which allows her to repair gens at a 3% increased speed, added in the most recent update
---
Been in the game since launch I think. At least for console launch. Only way to escape with that bug is hatch. Otherwise you just get beaned. Other bugs that pair with it sometimes are no healing or struggle bar for when you‚Äôre being carried
---
Gru from dispicable me
---
When freddy is teleporting to a gen that gets finished, he still gets to finish the teleport, so I'd imagine it works the same way here.
---
Ash main here, he‚Äôs just the most bad ass character in the game. That‚Äôs if you‚Äôre an Evil Dead series fan though but come on it‚Äôs Bruce Campbell how does it get any better?
---
This is a meme not a full on legion discussion
---
When searching for items definitely. You can get a god tier tool box/medkit/ whatever, and if you plunders somehow screws you over and gives you all garbage, the addons might be good. Brown medkit for example could come with an Insta heal
---
Wow, I will take that as an insult. I don‚Äôt ‚Äúrely‚Äù on NOED to get kills. I use it to kick the cocky survivors tea bagging (dancing) at the gate. I‚Äôm still learning the ropes. Chill.
---
Fair enough, I just saw some people in the comments talking.
---
The game is b2p, this isnt a f2p game, stop acting like skins should be only locked behind a paywall.
---
Literally what just happened without the message
---
Windows of oppertunity (Kate Teachable) helped me a ton, it shows u windows and pallets location
---
So get ace in the hole, ds, adrenaline, borrowed time?
---
I mean, credit to them for not doing the normal thing and shipping it with shitload of huge bugs. I‚Äôm willing to wait for a PTB that isn‚Äôt insanely big-ridden.
---
Keep drinking that kool-aid, bud.
---
Windows are a never ending resource. Pallets have a set number but tend to be a little stronger. Dont drop the pallet to early and if its too late you take a hit dont drop then either, instead use the boost from getting hit to make it to the next pallet/window. Even if you get downed the killer still takes time to pick u up and take you to a hook. This is kinda like a time management game more luck involved than the average TMG. Who uses the time better 4 surv or 1 killer.?
---
What? how is a rank 7 player the same rank as me?
---
This exact thing is why I always run Kindred when soloing now. Chances of that happening when I run kindred go from 50% to like, 25ish (I also barely play solo anymore though)
---
Ohh, that clears it up, i would that is a decent idea, but ifnit happens in a chase the survivor has like 90% chance of escapong
---
Okay?
---
His detection mechanic is pretty busted and incomplete but still not dc worthy.
---
I was almost able to make my entire breakfast before finding a match
---
low ranks will DC against most killers
---
Alright mate who did you kill?
---
Best thing about his power is that he can mind game certain loops and he can shut down Borrowed Time saves. That's about it. Otherwise he's a worse Myers. 
---
His Daily where you have to stalk from a lean is horseshit too and maybe the worst Daily.
---
I cant wait until this meme dies
---
Not with my gay ass.
---
It‚Äôs ok op this guy has ‚Äúfree thinker‚Äù and ‚Äúintellectual‚Äù don‚Äôt take anything he says seriously
---
It‚Äôs not like it lasts long, it‚Äôs about 1s. If there is no cover to go behind within that 1 second, you will not be able to hide. Plus after you are out of it you see scratch marks and blood that was there so you can still follow it after the 1s.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs really easy for you to break their detection and I don‚Äôt think I was running anyone of the detection add ons. Definitely needs to be sorted out.
---
gay
---
IF WE WERE TEAMMATES THEN AS LONG AS YOU DONT RUN AWAY RIGHT AFTER BEING UNHOOKED THEN I GOT YOU FAM
---
Ahh, then its.a good change, coming from a starting (rank 16) spirit main XD
---
what's that website?
---
I think a scooby doo DLC would get a lot of money
---
I'm in the purple ranks as survivor &amp; killer and i'm getting yellow and browns ranks. It's just screwed up right now.
---
shirtless david: GET ON MY LEVEL
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean I still don‚Äôt get unhooked by players thinking it‚Äôs safe but it wasn‚Äôt, or when they know the killer is coming back to proxy camp but throw me off anyway, or people who simply don‚Äôt understand.
---
He can be very frustrating because the reveal mechanic does not work properly. You stare right at him and....nothing. Then you‚Äôre exposed.
---
Not to mention I dont think I‚Äôve ever seen one yet that doesn‚Äôt rely on camp + NOED.
---
&gt;So? They are not even that bad considering we see daily posts of multiple red ranked survivors against a killer rank 10 \~ 20 and vice-versa.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Additionally, I don't have inside information or any word from devs at BHVR but in my experience with online games in general, matchmaking discrepancies can be common in order to reduce queue time depending on the population. If killers had to wait every time until there is 4 available survivors exactly the same rank, you would never play. SWF is also a thing which messes with matchmaking pretty badly.  
---
&gt;I am so tired of these screenshots and they don't add anything from each case. Wish they were considered oversaturated content and immediately removed.
---
Why that heck would you waste your time writing a flipping essay if it's not helpful to anyone?  If you want to write a long comment do it on a post that is asking for advice, not one that's just a joke.
---
Goddammit!
---
There is, sadly, no official confirmation of the Blood Hunt, so don't get too excited.
---
I really hate him. A combination of the reveal mechanic being completey busted, and the fact that GF players seem to have a higher camp rate than Hag players.
---
SOME GUY  GLITCHED ME IN A LOCKER EARLIER AND I GOT KILLED IN THE ENDGAME COLLAPSE. FUCKING PRICK.
---
not gonna lie, they had us in the first half
---
I‚ÄôM SICK OF RED RANK SURVIVORS WHO ARE INCAPABLE OF HITTING SKILL CHECKS. NOT EVEN GREAT SKILL CHECKS, JUST GOOD ONES. ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS RECENTLY I‚ÄôVE HAD SOMEONE ELSE HEALING ME, FAIL A SKILL CHECK AND DRAW THE KILLER RIGHT TO ME. PHARMACY IS GONNA BE A STAPLE IN MY BUILD FOR A WHILE. 
---
P.S. [GO HOME, MATCHMAKING, YOU‚ÄôRE DRUNK.](https://imgur.com/a/v1V5top)
---
I agree with this. They are obviously not healthy for the game
---
Tyvm for the recommendation, will watch him for sure.
---
Last time I said GG after playing as killer I got called salty by the two who escaped. Was just trying to be friendly.
---
It‚Äôs photoshop chatty window does a lot of photoshops. They‚Äôre also the one who made some other popular ones like the movie accurate Laurie for dbd and shirtless Myers that you always see.
---
When I see an Ash join my lobby I always make sure to bring a mori.
---
Looks like Coal Tower, so it's already one of the smallest maps. Similar to pallets, hooks have a "minimum # spawned". If I had to guess you hit that minimum so the map shoved in hooks where it could. 
---
It's the same way double pallets can form.
---
Necrophilia. Heard of it?
---
I honestly have never played SWF and I think it would feel wrong to do so. Like the game was meant to be played without communication outside of butt dancing in morse code and pointing and motioning.
---
Actually, it is my favourite killer to play as. I consider him a good killer as well. Being able to instadown and reduce your terror radius + red stain is very good. I actually like him over myers. Though I agree exposing him is pretty inconsistent.
---
it's from the 2018 Golden Globes
---
STEP 1: DAILY REQUIRES ME TO PLAY SURVIVOR WHERE I ONLY HAVE A SHITTY LOADOUT;   
---
BUT THAT'S FINE, W/E
---
STEP 2: GET INTO MATCH. A DOCTOR. GET SHOCKED, TRY TO VAULT AFTER CHARACTER HAS STOPPED SCREAMING, STILL CANT VAULT, GET HIT  
---
ANNOYING, BUT SUPPOSEDLY A GAME MECHANIC, SO OKAY
---
STEP 3: GET DOWNED, GET HOOKED
---
STEP 4: GET FARMED, YAY
---
STEP 5: GET DOWNED
---
STEP 6: GET FACECAMPED TO DEATH WHEN I DID LITERALLY NOTHING ALL GAME EXCEPT GET MY ASS KICKED
---
STEP 7: "UNABLE TO UPDATE YOUR RANK" LOSE EVEN THE MEAGRE BLOODPOINTS I GOT FROM MY CHASE
---
STEP 8 (TO DO): UNINSTALL
---
Killers have the ability to lunge that‚Äôs why
---
Dwight's spider legs remind me of Lord Recluse from City of Villains lol
---
WATCH OUT RANK 1
---
 One pip of difference resulted in a 20% differential. If it was even harder to pip than expected the data then that favors my argument, similarly if the data collection was flawed then we would expect to see the distribution between rank 1 and 2 to be more balanced, but that win percent wouldn't go away, if they were winning then the differential would be transferred away from 1 into 2. The same goes for survival rate. I have taken stats classes, you cant handwace this differential and say "yeah its closer to 50", you have no data to prove that whatsoever, and you implying otherwise is suspect. You also say that the rank 1 data was the issue but called rank 2 overinflated? Nonsensical based on your commentary. Finally, pip's being harder to achieve might make an argument for lower pip rate then, but what about NOW, where pipping on survival is relatively guaranteed? 
---
Sorry man, but these arguments are unsatisfactory. I agred we could use more data such as stratified killer kill rates/ pip rates, %player base by rank and so on but nothing has really changed since Marths experiment. I have seen the ~100% winrate literally replicated video by video.
---
Why does the ptb have to be this week just because double bloodpoints are next week?
---
Just cause you SWF doesn‚Äôt mean you have to communicate (for the most part I don‚Äôt honestly cause I feel the same as you), but people who SWF are more likely to save you just because you‚Äôre their friend.
---
BUT THATS A LONG WALK AND IM BUSY WITH THIS HERE FUCKING DULL TOTEM! YO ASS AINT WORTH NO 1k BP MOTHAFUCKA
---
BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE GOTTA POOP AND WHEN WERE SWF WE POOP TOGETHER!
---
I hate you.
---
NEXT TIME GO ON A KILLER RAMPAGE AND BE NICE TO DWEETS IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER THAN MURDER
---
Posting this here because wanna see how it went. Ignore this comment
---
Congratulations!
---
Its been datamined and confirmed

Devs were talking in the clip, decided to mute it

Not all skins skins are behind a paywall. And I never said they should only be behind a paywall. Only the really good looking ones because that is how marketing works. High demand, high price.
---
I still don't think I've ever beat new Freddie as a rank 6-7 survivor, but people do rate him as a very strong killer. OhTofu has him as the 5th strongest killer behind the obvious ones
---
Bronze. Lol.
---
I did feel bad but I invited to a private match and gave them tips. They told me thank you and added me.
---
Its not that hit reg is trash its rather that the connection between you and the killer is trash.
---
I knew exactly what this was before I even clicked on it. And I'm not disappointed in the slightest.
---
Both. Jk I started with Premonition, then moved on to Spine Chill.
---
I FIND HER SOMEWHAT UNFUN TO PLAY AGAINST TBH BUT I LOVE HER DESIGN, FROM THE LORE TO THE POWER TO ALL HER WAAAHS AND CRACKING GLASS. I SAY GO FORTH AND WHACK THOSE PESKY SURVIVORS WITH YOUR KATANA AND ENJOY YOURSELF.
---
No problem dude!
---
Perks are Nebula @ /r/PerkByDaylight
---
Lmao I‚Äôm a guy and bratz was that heat as a kid üî•üî•
---
I mean it works if you're not Injured. The issue is once injured you're basically Completely visible to her when she's phasing.
---
Survivors are Over-Altruistic, NOOOO, you don‚Äôt say?
---
Me with Nurse lol I still haven't played as Pig or Legion
---
I swear people steal that name
---
For sure. I was just saying that as more of a timeline, like once we see the PTB, we know it's coming sooner than later! 
---
I recognize your name from the F13 subreddit. I guess we're all migrating here now, huh? LOL!
---
It does I remade the post because of a typo.
---
Hey, what DLC are you from, locker-boy?
---
Imagine having to wait for your perk to cooldown
---
Be aware of the killer's red stain.  Just because it's pointing a certain way doesn't mean they aren't moonwalking to ambush you from another direction.
---
For a little input. Wasn‚Äôt toxic, didn‚Äôt do anything. Fixed the gens, ignored the hexes because they‚Äôre a mild annoyance at this point.
---
Saved a Meg he was face camping and once he downed me this happened. 4 gens left and he spent the entire time camping me. Why do this? In the end he lost the other three doing this as they just powered through the gens while I stuck in Struggle as long as I could so they‚Äôd escape.
---
It‚Äôs killers like this that make all other killers look bad in all honesty and people like this really need to get a grip and try playing properly &gt;_&gt;
---
Let's assume one thing. Double points (rumor) from September 5-9. The launch of the PTB is not going to be launched during a points event, so, as a maximum day the PTB would go to September 10, its duration is normally 2 weeks, 3 weeks for developers. Therefore, it would leave at the end of the month of September to September 30 even on October 1. This date does not match what the devs said: The dedicated servers will arrive before the summer that ends (September 24 last day)
---
If you‚Äôll notice, I was referencing the video that shows the gameplay in which it looks like a tunnel of dirt.
---
I hate you
---
And? Its extremely easy to 4k at rank 20. I did it with hag without using traps.
---
Survivors are braindead at those ranks. Its not until around rank 10-12 that they learn to run around pallets rather than through them
---
Can't wait for modders replacing demogorgans head by myers or any other killer and watch the model open
---
He slams it like an angry child.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cwqdbu/i_know_its_a_long_shot_but_is_it_possible_to_get/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
It seems like there was some disconnect between what the killer saw and what you saw.  He saw you as closer, swung, and hit you. 
---
I could be wrong but that's my opinion.
---
I'm rank 11 as killer and I keep deranking bc I get rank 2 swf ;-;
---
P E B B L E T I M E
---
I don‚Äôt remember what premonition does
---
Ash main here! I main him only because he talks in the lobby, making him the best survivor period.
---
Could you send me some instructions please? I would love to know how to make this
---
Yeah I realized the whole child murder thing after I wrote it...
---
For some reason the matchmaking today is *more* broken than usual (it's broken anyway but today especially... I've gone against 3 gold ranks as a rank 1 killer
---
Don't know who that is, looks creepy though so why not.
---
BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE HAS NO MITHER
---
Byres actually looks way more like Quintons in game model
---
I asked Otzdarva in one of his streams and he said it was a tier
---
Dude be quiet. They‚Äôre new to killer and they‚Äôre proud of themselves. Rather than make them feel upset for actually winning we should encourage them to play more if they actually had fun. Seriously why did you have to think so negative once you saw that a person actually liked playing the game?
---
The distribution of players to killers is irrelevant in this case, as someone like myself is arguing that the highest winrates for survivors, and the lowest, need to invert to some extent which means completely reworking Nurse for instance. It is greatly overlooked and highly tied to the emotional satisfaction survivors get from dominating games. I literally have people in these comments arguing that because the data didn't register pips properly that the  massive differentials in rank 1 and rank 2 winrates are complete hoaxes. Truly, a case study could be done on what levels cognitive dissonance some people in this game will go to to protect their ability to whoop other players.
---
Yeno what? I'm today years old when I realized we don't have to be on Discord being tools to SWF XD. Good point!
---
I‚Äôll keep this pinned on my desktop when the tough times come, I appreciate the warning.

She's from a movie called Dead Silence.

Worth checking out.
---
YOU NEED YOU SOME MOTHERFUCKING DUCT TAPE GLOVES YOUR TRAIL MIX WILL STICK TO THAT SHIT LIKE DUCT TAPE
---
Hitting through pallets is a thing to stop people teabagging and to discourage survivors relying on pallets and windows in a close chase
---
I‚Äôve also been getting a lot of green killers while my whole team would be in the red ranks.
---
just run small game lol
---
I ask myself the same thing, I have a video of me playing and I got 4 dcs very fast. It sucks tbh
---
Anyone who didnt see this coming is brainlet iq
---
I hate to be the one to say this, but it really is one of the most toxic games I‚Äôve played. But yeah, no problem.
---
I play killer and I will swing obviously miss and they will get injured or enter dying state. There are so many times it registers and I'll say that shouldn't have hit the hit reg is striaght up broken every youtuber whoplays DBD can tell you that and everyone who plays
---
hmmm yes demodaddy
---
Y u gotta be a dick?. They accomplished something that they are proud of. it's like you bragging about being at rank one and talking about you getting 4k's with Overrated perks.
---
This person was 'new' with legion, without using overrated perks. Get in the trash you rotten donut.
---
Yeah sounds about right. At my rank he does feel like the third best killer though (behind nurse/spirit) since there's not many good Billy's and huntresses
---
My gf is a killer main and she generally focuses on the flashy outfitted survivors first cuz they are the easiest to find, easiest to see/follow so they must be asking for a quick death she says.  Notvto the point of tunneling usually...but definitely focuses on them first if she can or the opportunity presents itself...Saves her mories for them.
---
WELCOME TO SURVIVOR IT FUCKING SUCKS!
---
MASTURBATE AND MAKE EYE CONTACT! ESTABLISH DOMINANCE OR YOULL NEVER GET ANYWHERE IN LIFE!
---
I agree with you LilVirn
---
Didn't think it could be done
---
IM REALLY SORRY BUT I DONT SPEAK SQUEAKY BITCH NOISES CAN SOMEONE TRANSLATE WHAT THEY BE SAYIN?
---
What's the point? We don't have that much cosmetics
---
Eh he can think what he thinks and unfortunately this is what new players when stranger things launches will experience. I was proud because I never played killer. There was a rank 13 and no on was within 4 ranks of 20 so I was somewhat impressed.
---
Could be cool. I saw this movie as a kid so I know she likes to cut out tongues and stuff but what could her ability be?
---
I agree
---
You're also comparing a perk that works only against 1 item vs a perk that mostly negates ALL items.
---
Nope, the problem's on your side
---
It‚Äôs worth a shot
---
Lol I‚Äôm a girl so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll have a problem there
---
They mention something about a tug-of-war mechanic
---
It's usually when people find out the personality behind the streamer that they make opinions
---
Nah they mentioned they had a problem in the ptb and that it will be out once they fix it. "The King" on it posted a video and addressed it
---
Thx
---
As someone who mains three characters that sounds like a nightmare.
---
Personally, I love Hopper, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to play as him in this. I really love the choice of Nancy, if I‚Äôm being honest.
---
Somewhat in his defense, he was actually originally going for the unhooker (he even managed to injure them), but I kept on pestering him to get his attention back and let the other person go free. But well, I guess it was indeed his fault for falling for the obvious bait.
---
Sure! Send me a message and I'll get you some!
---
Yeah great job! I‚Äôm a killer main, and I can only say welcome to game(assuming you‚Äôre new, if not my my apologies) I hope you have a great rest of your games and for let people make you feel down!
---
I still have no idea how are they going to explain the fact that Nansy&amp;Steve disappeared after season 3 as there's going to be season 4. They should've chose Barb as a survivor and/or Billy as second survivor.
---
Motherfucker...here‚Äôs an upvote
---
Perkless though? On arguably one of the weakest killers?
---
Ah shit I cant believe you've done this
---
No one on here said Micheal I love playing at him but verseing him sucks tombstone is op af you can get a 4k in 50 seconds with lock of hair and tombstone not including stalking time (I did it once) as a side note 99ing t2 until your right beside a full health serviver
---
It‚Äôs not camping if the survivors are over-altruistic toxic little scoundrels who wait around the corner of the hook for u to leave

THATS FUCKING ACCEPTABLE THEN CARRY ON

DBD Quentin looks like handsome Squidward on crack
---
killt?
---
My favorite was someone reported me for racism because i killed him 2nd when he was a claudette
---
You think they'll get some Stephen King monster/killers in DBD?
---
One thing you can do is to run Blood Warden for a couple of games. Sure the perk is too situational to be good, but damn does it feel good when those teabaggers realize they suddenly can't exit the gate anymore.
---
God damnit my day was pretty decent until i saw this, now i need to kms

Or bob, maybe?

i'd love Patrick

If I can spot ghost face before he begins stalking me or even if he only has a little bit of stalk on me, I will take cover so he can't stalk me but I can still see him with the 3rd person camera view then bait him into coming out of his cover to approach me to stalk me more then as soon as he is out in the open I run out of cover and look directly at him. I might get hit, sure, but it's better than getting exposed and one shotted.
---
Samination is my hero!
---
More overrated than steve?
---
Stone Ocean is chronologically the next after Vento Aureo, and you're going to be a bit confused if you jump straight into Steel Ball Run (Part 7) or JoJolion (Part 8).
---
I really like that outfit
---
&gt; what is so bad about being killed by a killer.
---
It ends the game early. Just like camping and tunneling, It isn't fun for either side, so don't do it.
---
If its end game as killer, and you don't have a kill, camp. Thats really the only time I'd consider it fair as there is no other objectives for you to defend.
---
That is called burger king meyers.
---
im going to come
---
Barley legal?!??! She‚Äôs so interesting, do you
---
OH FUCK YOUUUU
---
basically the entire point is that you move as slow as physically possible lol, its just a meme build.
---
You know you can turn off the chat, right?
---
I feel like balancing in this game is just a hard thing to do. You will have obvious and clear differences between red ranks and rank 15-20, so which do you base it off of? Competitive games would go off of red ranks because the point of the game is the rank play, but this isn't a competitive game and cant rely on hardocre ranked focused players to keep the game alive. So should it cater to the higher ranks to keep new players invested and have a higher retention rate? The answer they have given is basically attempt both, which is kinda leading to them failing both. Not to mention the devs need to decide on a "balanced" match. Is a match where all survivors die but get 15k-20k BP balanced and fair? Is a match where two survivors escape fair regardless of BP? In that sense the devs/playerbase need to decide the point of the game. Is it to get bloodpoints/high score or to escape/kill. Or is it simply to have fun? Personally I think everyone should play to have fun but also that it is a cop out answer.
---
Yo where can I look at my stats like this??
---
Yeah I realise it‚Äôs Burger King Myers now but at the time I was laughing too much to realiseüòÇüò≠
---
Lol
---
No, I think shittier killers need to be made stronger, not strong killers being made shittier
---
IM TIRED OF RISKING MY LIFE TO SAVE OTHER SURVIVORS WHO GET HOOKED AFTER THE EXIT GATE OPENES.
---
IT ALWAYS ENDS IN DEATH.
---
Discordance is so pretty!
---
its pretty funny, i myself have never actually run into it, but Ive certainly heard about it.
---
They just need to do something with the add ons for each of these killers. Billy has his insta-saw, Spirit has prayer beads and just about all her add ons that are yellow rarity and above are very strong and Nurse with her double range and multiple blink add ons. These 3 killers without add ons are balanced enough imo. It's the add ons that make them ridiculous.
---
Just in time for Spooktober
---
I personally think the gameplay is a lot more fun from a survivor point of view against the mid tier killers. Facing nurse or spirit is really unfun.
---
That being said, i do agree it would make the balance shift in the survivor's favor, so gen speed would need a nerf.
---
I prefer to face a mid tier killer with slow gens that have short gen speed against Killers i can't do shit against.
---
So I do normally, but this guy got 3 crows so I hooked him, then he remained afk got 3 crows again and then I just hooked him again and he died
---
At first glance i tought it was John Cena Broly:
---
Just for reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8oar_DVlj0
---
These are so unbalanced, and its not hard to tell you are a survivor main
---
I‚Äôve never gone against a meme build so I wasn‚Äôt really expecting it, I just thought he was being stupid but, now I know
---
Laughs in mad grit
---
They don‚Äôt show up in the bloodweb until you unlock them
---
I mean yes LF does need a buff, but i don't think its a good idea to bring all Killers at Nurse/Spirit power level. The recent rework they did of Freddy, or GF, are both greatly balanced.
---
Facing Killers you can't do shit against is no fun.
---
They remind me a bit of my Bates brand combat boots.
---

---
My first time playing killer I got 0 hooks and kept forgetting how to kick gens. You did awesome!
---
I actually agree with you. I think Billy is fine. He doesn't ignore all game mecanics and i can def beat Billy if i am more skilled than him.
---
it‚Äôs been removed now, what did it say?
---
 i personally think the gameplay is a lot more fun from a survivor point of view against the mid tier killers. Facing nurse or spirit is really unfun.
---
Didnt know scorpion  was in dead by daylight
---
At the minimum, remove extra blinks
---
Hexy lol ya let's listen to that trainwreck
---
I bought 2 perks in the bloodweb wake up and boil over yet they aren't showing up
---
Looks like a porno.
---
What? giving her 100% movement speed would be a buff. She's currently 4% slower than survivors (meaning 96% movement speed). She needs to move way slower, not faster..
---
Leatherface legion and Clown need buffs the most
---
That'a fair, yeah. Nurse is generally not a fun game.
---
It is a chance to get them when unlocked. But when they aren‚Äôt unlocked you can‚Äôt find them in the web
---
Also
---
i wonder wuat they are gonna do to multi level maps? i.e. the game, swamp..
---
Nurse and Spirit? Yes. Billy? not really. 
---
I definitely think insta saw needs to be removed and his addons that increase movement speech should NOT be stackable but other than that he's perfectly balanced.
---
He looks normal!!
---
Only with mint rag
---
Only ones that need tweaking might just be Nurse. 
---
Billy is alright but devs even said themselves they're looking at his addons, likely meaning no more instasaw. 
---
I'd rather have other killers buffed though. I think the real issue is the fact you NEED Billy, Spirit, or Nurse (or to a lesser extent Freddy or even Doctor for chase/stall/zap at pallets or whatever. Hag's also decent.) to really do well at higher ranks.
---
We just need buffs for the other killers. The "Bottom Of The Barrel" killers (Wraith, maybe Ghostface, definitely Legion and Leatherface) killers are getting destroyed easily and that needs to be fixed somehow, and not by just making band-aid perks to solve the problem.
---
If limited blinks to get around, a small speed buff would make sense so she can at least patrol somewhat.
---
Wow, you're so good using Spirit with ebony 
---
/S
---
You have fun going against easier weaker killers is what you're saying
---
Being that rank doesn‚Äôt help you this late I‚Äôm reset. Also it could be your Nat type because I don‚Äôt think other people are having this problem
---
A survivor‚Äôs last thoughts should be of the campfire
---
dont just killt one survivors, killt all survivors
---
Ehm, i saw a full stack with multiple blood covered clothes, plus they were red ranks, idk why are u even complaining lol
---
I wasn't so lucky when I reached red, and I hardly play killer anymore because of that
---
It was just Hell for me
---
Good observation
---
*&gt;mobile editing*
---
*&gt;no watermark saying "made with mematic"*
---
***&gt;NOT SCIENTIFICALLY POSSIBLE!***
---
My first killer game I stared at a dull totem for a couple of minutes trying to figure out what it was lol
---
After all these months how are people not tired of this stupid meme already
---
The issue is long chases getting pallet slammed 30 times can be unfun for the killer. Even as someone who plays Billy I find my chases are not that super short if survivors can loop decently, 360, or "Camp pallets". IDK how do counter pallet campers besides swing through every time and eat the stun. 
---
Devs said they don't wanna increase gen time anymore because survivors hate M1 simulator. They increased healing time instead and that only lead to survivors dropping Self-Care and genrushing for adrenaline. 
---
IMHO we just need more side objectives. Someone had [an idea to go find a breaker box part to direct power to the gate.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/8ssvk2/detailed_survivor_objective_idea_for_devs/?st=jzvsmh9k&amp;sh=a80fe827)
---
I see people think up stuff like having each generator require parts the survivors have to search lockers to find to get past certain thresholds of repair, etc. We just need more side objectives to "Stall for time" while still being engaging gameplay.
---
Its was a joke he was kidding hence the /s
---
Too true.
---
Right now there are not, but eventually there will be.
---
Yeah, face camping is basically a guarantee 4e in purple and red as borrowed + DS kick in and survivors will finish gens and wait for someone to stew on hook for a while.
---
Camping is such a bad strategy. Tunneling, if you're literally only chasing one survivor will get you 1 kill just in time to lose the game lol
---
This is the most idiotic idea ever, let us take the only viable killers and make them worse so no one is viable thus making everyone viable very nice idea
---
Truly one of the best names out there
---
I was confused by gen auras lol i actually remember the map: it was wretched shop and i was lost on the map the entire time
---
You wouldn't be able to buy the loot boxes and could only get them from a player level like overwatch.
---
Yes obviously. A chase against a trapper for example feels like a real chase and is exciting. Against a Nurse, it just feels like i can't do shit.
---
As a killer, it feels frustrating that whenever u spend a bit too long on a fun chase, all gens are completed.
---
I really think the game is best with mid tier Killers, but longer gen repair time.
---
Hey! I'm super new to dbdl! Would you mind explaining? In as few or many words as you want!
---
If they did an RNG daily box and you couldn‚Äôt purchase more, sure. Battlefront 2 has daily crates where you get 500 credits or whatever they‚Äôre called. Something like that with an occasional cosmetic would be okay, I think. 500 BP wouldn‚Äôt be enough to do anything with unless you actually logged in everyday and let it add up.
---
SCP 106 has breached containment
---
How in sweet fuck did I fall for that

so I'm not gonna get them regardless of going to the shrine and using shards? what kinda sh!t is that then how can you get them then?
---
The ultimate juke
---
Wear the same, don‚Äôt complain.

I noticed a full game of new players with devour hope and I‚Äôm so sorry

you'd only be able to get loot boxes from a player level and a garented gold from a devotion level.
---
No problem!
---
oh, i didnt see it, looks to be a weird but interesting concept..lets see how it turns out

When you unlock them they can appear in the bloodweb. But it‚Äôs still a chance that you get them every level. You are garunteed if you keep going through the web

wow cool post

KAIJIT KILLER CONFIRMED!
---
Yeah but the benefits of discord don‚Äôt give a complete visual and take a little longer for you to understand. At least from my experience, chatting isn‚Äôt too easy during a chase. Only people who can keep calm in those events can really do that.
---
Even power outages?
---
How about 100 auric cells a day for playing a game?
---
I saw that last night and was losing my mind at ‚Äòdeath knot‚Äô
---
That ruins the game because first of all doing gens is already the boring part of being a survivor since you sit still holding one button and second all I see is you saying you can't do shit against nurses and spirits making it no fun well bullshit you can so do something against them just cause you can't do it doesn't mean anything. How could you possibly think this will make the game better? Get better at the game and stop looking for easy wins
---
I DIDN'T BUY IT, are you telling me I gotta go buy Quentin then level his bloodweb to level his bloodweb to 30 to get his perk I bought with shards?

**DELETE SHELTER WOODS** IT'S THE WORST FUCKING MAP IN THE GAME AND 3/10 TIMES I'M PLAYING IT. WHY DOES IT APPEAR ALWAYS IF IT'S SO FUCKING BAD. AS KILLER AND AS SURVIVOR IS BORING. THE ONLY ORIGINAL THING ABOUT THE MAP IS A BIG FUCKING TREE WHERE YOU CAN'T EVEN LOOP. THERE ARE NO PLACES TO ACTIVATE BALANCED LANDING EXCEPT FROM A FUCKING BRANCH OF THAT DAMN TREE AND ITS ONLY TREES AND THE SAME TILES ALL THE MAPS HAVE. EITHER REWORK IT TO HAVE SOMETHING WORTH PLAYING IN IT OR JUST FUCKING YEET IT.

i have no idea what you mean by she got her bump through "sexual stuff" LOL

are we just gonna ignore the flexing wraith
---
You ever seen a ps4 wraith
---
Disagree, these people have jobs too ya know. Plus survivors can see you

Hopefully

Next up on the agenda is probably Jeff and Kate! I based them off their respective actors since they‚Äôre not exactly stellar in game (I mean Quentin). Hope you guys like it!

Goes into spirit realm (she breaks bones and does an animation, is basically an out of body experience and the only way to find a survivor is scratch marks or noises like when working on a gen, running and panting, wounded moans, etc. she can‚Äôt see them and they can only see where her body currently is, but not her actually spirit)

I think you can see the red stain (aka killer‚Äôs looking direction) when her spirit is close though.

When did I ever say that? Unlocking a teachable perk means it becomes available on everyones bloodwebs like a normal perk you havent bought yet. You have unlocked his teachable, you just need to level your meg up until it shows up. You aren‚Äôt getting the point so you should probably look up some diagram or something to understand how the system works

Why can't they give GF a phone?

If they‚Äôre rank 20 they aren‚Äôt gonna be good perks. Perks also don‚Äôt decide the games. There‚Äôs streamers out there who‚Äôve gotten rank 2 and rank 1 with no perks.

They were kinda a duo, and the devs didn't want us killing children. Hopper would've been fun, and honestly i don't like nancy much in the show, but i'm happy enough. Plus it's one girl one guy which is a nice selection. I'm honestly much more salty about them not having sidney prescott last chapter

The last game I had as a killer is I was carrying one survivor two others butt fucked me in a corner and one of them let off a fire cracker, Safe too say I tunnelled one of them haha

Make sure you play a game of survivor and killer every day for the bonus 300 XP. Other than that you just get it from time spent in game, so try not to be the first person that gets killed.
---
Just played a game as billy, one hooked almost all the survivors and two hooked the last guy.  All sacrificed.  Depip.  This ‚Äúranking‚Äù system is really stupid.  If you dumpster all 4 survivors, that‚Äôs when you should double pip.  Not a depip so you face worse survivors.

Its based off play time and playing a match a day on both killer/survivor. So play Killer/Survivor at least once a day, and just play.

That seems so stupidly backwards. Like, a player shouldn't be able to do something that negatively impacts their team *and* the enemy. And being punished because the other players are bad is just dumb.
---
&gt; The issue is long chases getting pallet slammed 30 times can be unfun for the killer. Even as someone who plays Billy I find my chases are not that super short if survivors can loop decently, 360, or "Camp pallets". IDK how do counter pallet campers besides swing through every time and eat the stun.
---
As billy pallet campers are simple to counter, just use your chainsaw. What's harder to counter is loopers that know when to keep looping if you are going to use your chainsaw. But then you can counter that with fake revving of your chainsaw and it becomes a mind game. A good billy isn't supposed to get looped for 30 pallets. But he also isn't supposed to easily catch everyone instantly like the nurse.
---
&gt; Devs said they don't wanna increase gen time anymore because survivors hate M1 simulator.
---
Well its been suggested before here to add additional objectives, which is a good idea imo, cuz yea gens can be boring, but i don't think short gens and impossibly hard killers is fun design.

Using a system based on length of game determining what survivors get paired with what killers, you‚Äôre in for a bad time.  This is a fundamentally flawed ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùranking‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù system.
---
Wait is this a real perk
---
Im sorry, you appear to be over 14 and thus not immature/stupid enough to appreciate this shitty content.
---
Yeah I feel like hopper and wills mom (I'm blanking on her name) would have been a good duo
---
I've heard this a lot, but I don't think they would add Clementine. Mainly because I'm pretty sure she is under 18, but if I'm wrong, then I'll vouch for it.
---
It didnt work is what and I broke the pallet lol
---
You have to find them first. Thats part of the minute.
---
It takes you the same amount of time to just use the word dumb, instead of calling someone a pansy. 
---
Have a great one!
---
I like this idea then.
---
Behavior posts it on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
---
Well one survivor isn't supposed to be stronger than the power role in a asymmetrical game anyways yknow
---
I don't fu**ing know I'm new what happens if I get her bloodweb to level 50 then what? what if it doesn't show up?
---
Why are you guys so sensitive when it comes to messages lol, stop being dense
---
If all of them were nerfed, survivors would dominate at red ranks. all of the other killers are pretty much M1, and the way the maps are layed out, you can loop for 10 minutes plus. So absolutely fucking not.
---
Disable the chat then you whiney sensitive pussy

His ability should be fear related. In the book he manifests as the victims fear.
---
No duh the ranking system is shit but it‚Äôs understandable. Fast ended games are not a clear definition of skill because you could achieve the same results against a bot or afk player. 
---
Plus, if we are being honest; Red Rank players should care the least about pips. They‚Äôre already in Red Ranks. Where else are they gonna go if they safety pip every game? What good does double pipping matter when you‚Äôre going from R3 to R2? Your game quality doesn‚Äôt change and neither does the pool of people you play against/with.

Ghostface + power regeneration addons. SWFs usually put that extra effort to break you out and tank the stalk. With the addons, your power comes back super quickly and the survivor that thought they needed to take a hit suddenly gets exposed and downed. 
---
They honestly are my favorite addons in general. They let you be a lot more liberal with his power use and use it for things like red glow mindgames and finding survivors by letting them break you out without losing a whole lot of power uptime. They kind of feel like how ghostface is supposed to be to me tbh lol
---
It's camping but it's not a bad thing. If me staying there means 3 or maybe even all 4 people are off gens that's basically always worth it and you can usually get at least one down in exchange for the unhook or at least do a lot of damage into another chase.
---
That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs always in his locker ;)
---
Mother fucker I didn‚Äôt even expect this!

Oh, there's more where that came from. But you gotta work for it, babycakes.

No. Hexy also said Dead Hard is the worst exhaustion perk. Also, have you seen how Hexy plays killer? It‚Äôs hard to respect the opinion of someone who straight camps/proxy camps as a killer main every trial. Almost as bad as Pug saying killer is easy but can only 4K with Insidious LF.

Survive With Friends, it means that they invited people they know to play with them as survivor. They often have microphones talking to each other and means that if you're facing one as killer, (especially as a stealth killer) it's basically hard mode.

Yeah she was a dlc character

I main legion but he‚Äôs in my opinion the worst killer in the game. Without survivors messing up or without the right perks. You‚Äôll lose. Guaranteed.

IMO revert it back to the way it was, but remove the stupid, useless aura reading and add a broken status effect for the rest of the trial. It would make it a situational perk (think 2 body blocks at exit) and actual usable but not ridiculously OP.

Please god no.  There is nothing more cringe than Supernatural fans.
---
It's really good for survivors tho and I feel like its opposite would be like the meat packing plant where theres really nowhere to hide, and so its refreshing to get a map where it's slightly easier to lose the killer. Idk just my thoughts, I play both sides.
---
Perfect survivors and Perfect Killers does not exist. When game is well balanced the Killer shouldn't instantly blink to survivors and down them effortlessly, but the Killer shouldn't be a Joke.

For real, had a game the other night where doors were opened and they had kept running me nearby where this Nea was hooked. I felt like I was camping after a while so I left and went to the exit gate so they could save her. They didn't get her until the last second and then the Nea teabagged me at the exit game, and called me a liar in postgame chat. I'm just like... welp... time to run an ebony mori game.
---
You just said a perfect nurse beats a perfect survivor now you say they don't exist. News flash if the the nurse isn't making any mistakes and is playing well they aren't effortlessly blinking and downing they need to be good at it to do it consistently and perfectly like you're saying so no need for a Nerf what needs changing is you and your play style

So instead of chance skins are going to be overpriced rip

Aaaah! Thanks!
---
two reason, the devs aren‚Äôt gonna take out a map just because a single bad player says so, and because I like that map
---
I seeee o:
---
For pallet campers I mean they go on the other end of the pallet and wait. AKA the most "Basic" type of pallet play. Definitely not the "Optimal" play as they don't even loop the pallet, just wait for you to come through, stun you, and simply run to the next pallet, rinse repeat. Like it's a "Amatuer" strat that ends up rapidly chewing through the pallets, but during this time all you can do is pray the pallets finally run out (At least during looping you can get a lucky chainsaw or lunge hit sometimes) meanwhile you're getting pallet slammed 8 times in a row over and over.
---
Typically when I try to chainsaw them (I go on the other side, basically in a little mexican standoff of sorts where it's down to reaction time, rev up, and chainsaw through hoping they either drop the pallet early or too late, either making me "Insta-Saw" the pallet apart or down them while being stunned.) they usually manage to drop it in such a way I get stunned without hitting them, and it's off to the next pallet.
---
I dunno if I'm supposed to feather the chainsaw throttle a few times in the standoff to try and throw off the "Pallet Camper's" timing because I'm starting to think what's actually going on is he's dropping the pallet based on the timing of my saw to fully charge. 
---
The only killer I play that can counter "Pallet Campers" is Doctor. Give 'em a zap to disable pallets and vaults for 2.5 seconds, switch to punishment mode and rush up and smack him during the 2.5 period.
---
Don‚Äôt lie to you‚Äôre self it‚Äôs Steve
---
I'd rather kill the kinds of terrible survivors that lose in 2 minutes and hope I get better ones next game than play babysitter for them.
---
Appreciate the speed up, by the way. Awesome stuff!
---
I once played with Dr. Disconnect and true enough she DCed like the moment I downed her

Most chases last about a minute in red ranks, no one goes down in under a minute

---
As a Doctor main I can confirm I used the "Grab Happy Doc" "Exploit" (Treatment mode M1 spam) to win hatch standoffs almost every time when they were a thing.
---
Doctor is a better facecamper than Leatherface. Hell I'd argue 100% of my hatch grabs were from Grab Happy Doc, and 95% of my other grabs were via Grab Happy Doc.
---
For some reason grabs in general feel EXTREMELY inconsistent. I remember MANY times when I simply tapped M1 at the hatch or at a hook, not a lunge, but a tap of M1, and my character swings their weapon. I've had MANY times where someone's unhooking in my face, and I go line up behind them, and as they're lifting the guy off the hook, my character swings, the guy gets unhooked, and the unhooker falls into Dying State from the hit. IDK why grabs feel so fucking buggy for me, might be ping but killer is currently host so I ought to be doing grabs when I should be able to, but my character almost always just hits. 
---
I remember once turning a 0K into a 3 or 4K because people kept rushing into the basement thinking they could get the unhook while I spammed M1 in treatment mode. 
---
It is not perfect though. Sometimes it'll go for a grab and suddenly swing your weapon force-changing you to punishment mode. I also have footage of me doing a hatch grab, and the survivor still escapes even though it's doing the interrupt animation and I clearly have them on my shoulder.
---
Well done on your efforts, but I've only heard bad things about red ranks. I don't go above 8, bc I already hate the optimal builds and shit around there, I'm sure I'd hate when literally everyone is doing it
---
That and once I finally hit purple the rank resets, or BC I'm bad, a mix of all 3 really
---
I'm content around green ranks, game, for the most part, is still actually fun and has variation
---

Uuuuh nah dam I love the map for both killer and survivor. It's great for sneaky killers and it's also great for immersed survivors. But not only that the bamboo and grass covers totems pretty great, I can't tell u how many games I've had as both killer and survivor where the survivors (as well as myself) couldn't find the hex totems cause the grass hid them so well.

yea fuck this i‚Äôm going back to sleep
---
The edit is amazing. Can we get **THAT** Quentin, please?
---
I was thinking his power would be something similar to hillbilly‚Äôs where he charges like a bull and breaks through pallets. But I like the shackles idea too.
---
Ikr, pls deliver
---
Sorry? I havent seen the third season
---
I don‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôs overrated but he was added to fortnite not too long ago and they probably had something contractual that kept Hopper from being used in other games (besides official), or the devs just wanted other characters since he is now in fortnite
---
You either don't play in red ranks or don't play in even the purple ones. Just watch players like tru3talent and you will see how they loop a killer for about 2 minutes every chase they get. Also, the billy thing, he is a straight running killer, vault or just turn a 90 degree angle and he misses
---
Yeah she is!
---
YES! PLEASE AND THANK YOU
---
"sips cup of tea" I only do this with ruin. Tho I did do it back when I first started cause I didn't know better lol.
---
Link me to it please
---
You're not wrong about the builds but in a way, it helps. I'm pretty much able to read what they probably have by how they play. "You were playing pretty reckless so you probably have decisi- yep, that's a shank". "You're ballsy for going for this save, you've got borrowed time/deliverance don't you? Mhm, thought so." I kinda prefer this instead of where I was in the green ranks where i had no idea at all what the Survivors might have been running, it's a mixed bag there.
---
Same thing here. Sad times indeed
---
Those sound like solid combos, thanks.
---
Are you okay? Like... I'm seriously concerned for your mental well being. you neither read anything I said correctly, nor addressed any issues with your previous arguments, not brought up and good arguments in your defense that I didn't already give a solid retort to. I suggest you take a break from reddit, and with that a break from DBD as well.
---
You may not recall at this point, but my original comment was simple, a request that 'all' wards be removed, survivor and killer alike, which was a fair statement. Someone decided to stupidly come in and proclaim "trapper only has 3 addons" which is literally a false statement, upon which the whole "useless addon" discussion came about. So do remember, if you are unhappy right now, it is an argument you picked.
---
So now... back to your "retort":
---
"If you honestly think that Trapper is balanced by losing 2 or 3 gens to set up DISARMABLE traps"
---
- If you're losing 2-3 gens because you're trying to setup some type of special play, then you just aren't playing trapper correctly.
---
"And if you think Clown and Leatherface being weakened by their POWERS, is fair, you just flat out don't know shit. "
---
- Every single killer in the game has some sort of cooldown associated with their powers. If there was no penalty to missed attacks, survivors would be too easy to catch. So yeah, that's fair. 
---
"Now, lets get back to that ignorant-ass comment you made about killers not needing addons?"
---
- All you did was say "these killers have weaknesses", you didn't demonstrate that killers literally cannot win the game without addons. Again, cooldowns make up for the fact that again, you are FASTER than the survivor. Ergo, missing your attack SHOULD come with a penalty. 
---
"This dumbass who thinks Trapper is op"
---
- Please provide the exact sentence where I said Trapper is OP. Let me save you some time, you won't find it, because I never said it. 
---
"And you want to talk about killer powers not needing to charge up in game?"
---
- Another thing I never said. It's like your making things up to argue against. It's even worse than a strawman argument. 
---
"And since you promised me there'd be free killer addons in matches if I could bring up powers that recharge"
---
- Does context mean nothing to you? Survivors can LOSE their items mid game from using them. Killers CANNOT lose their powers in the game in the same way survivors LOSE their items. You asked where killers can get free add-ons in game, then took my word 'recharge' out of context. The point being that killers don't have to search for items on the map with no guarantee of what they'll receive IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR POWERS WORK (minus myers, but given he has an instant downing ability, that's pretty balanced), and the fact that survivor items AND chest will run out, whereas killer powers can be constantly used throughout the game. Nice try, but no. 
---
"God, it's like you were born without reasoning skills "
---
- Says the guy who got spanked in the lesson on analogies in my last comment and didn't bring it up since due to embarrassment. 
---
"or long-term memory"
---
- Says the person who brought this conversations very far from where it started and needed reminding of the original comment.
---
"to realize how goddamn stupid you sound"
---
- Says the guy who doesn't know how to avoid using fallacies. 
---
"talking massive amounts of shit about stuff you don't know a damn thing about"
---
- Well, I know trapper still has 20 add ons, no matter how crappy you think they are, and that I'd still like wards to be removed from both survivors and killers. I also know that you are a waste of my time. Goodbye, kid.
---
Apparently there is a reddit for that. 
---

I will second this ye with a yeye
---
Best build for every killer.
---
No lol he didn‚Äôt do cocaine in the show- before season three his actor was busted with cocaine and it was unknown if he would even be returning to the show, so it‚Äôs probably best that he wasn‚Äôt added
---
You made me say god fucking dammit out loud
---
I don't care what people tell me I will cleanse... I really can't bear the sounds of that coughing at throwing up at all. I really wish Iron Will would work on that...
---
DBD just needs an overhaul on a ton of their models, mostly the faces though. They basically just use the same model and upscale them and slightly change the face, if you look at their concept art to how everyone looks in game it's depressing. Ming is the worst by far for their actual original characters.
---
I fuckinf knew it!
---
I usually run Small Game and focus on totems. Once those are all cleansed, I join the rest of the team on gens. On my end, NOED is no problem!
---
Pachinko for life
---
1. My computer is a bit old but the game isn't really demanding graphics wise.
---
2. The game does not lock you out if you dont have the dlc. You will have access to all the maps, and can even buy killers and survivors with one of the in game currencies.
---
3. Community varies but you cant get kicked from games. You will have a few dcs though.
---
4. These are free DLCs
---
Im rank 1. I don‚Äôt think you would change your mind even If I sent you a picture so I‚Äôm not. Also Tru isn‚Äôt god tier at the game. If hes getting looped for two minutes hes chasing people at powerful loops and should find someone else.
---
Cant wait for that perk noed will just be non-existent.
---
Daddy Steve all the way
---
Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie Strode) wouldn‚Äôt sign off on them using her Likeness, heard and read where she said no. Probably a money thing lol. Then the guy for Quentin didn‚Äôt even know they were adding him and probably did so because it was yet another money thing...
---
&gt; For pallet campers I mean they go on the other end of the pallet and wait. AKA the most "Basic" type of pallet play. Definitely not the "Optimal" play as they don't even loop the pallet, just wait for you to come through, stun you, and simply run to the next pallet, rinse repeat. Like it's a "Amatuer" strat that ends up rapidly chewing through the pallets, but during this time all you can do is pray the pallets finally run out (At least during looping you can get a lucky chainsaw or lunge hit sometimes) meanwhile you're getting pallet slammed 8 times in a row over and over.
---
Usually what i'll do is ill rev my chainsaw. If he doesnt drop down his pallet, i will like curve it and chainsaw him. But most of the time they drop it down and waste it. Really good one time it perfect and stun you, but that's not a big deal if u got enduring, and very few people can get this timing right every single times.
---
&gt; they usually manage to drop it in such a way I get stunned without hitting them, and it's off to the next pallet.
---
Yea this definitely does happen. But most people can't do it every single times, and if you have enduring its not dramatic.
---
&gt; I dunno if I'm supposed to feather the chainsaw throttle a few times in the standoff to try and throw off the "Pallet Camper's" timing because I'm starting to think what's actually going on is he's dropping the pallet based on the timing of my saw to fully charge.
---
Maybe try to throw off their timing. Like rev it half way, then slow down, then rev it all the way. Could mess with their timing maybe.
---
&gt; Is this technique "Wait for killer to come through, drop pallet, move on to next" called Pallet Camping?
---
Yes. And tbh its weaker than pallet looping.
---
Thank you for making Quentin look like Quentin ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I did not think i would sympathise with someone running No-ed, but I do.
---
It spawns on a totem thats nearly fully cleansed. Killer immediatly dc's.
---
The survivor they were chasing also had adreniline.
---
When you get Leatherface the perk comes with him automatically. But it becomes a teachable perk when you get him to Level 35
---
That's because nowadays most of the toxic trash of survivors also derank to ruin purple ranks, so red ranks is just filled with people who want to play the game and that's about it.
---
IM NOT TUNNELING IF TWO PEOPLE ARE DEAD  AND I CAN'T FIND THE FOURTH PERSON. I LITERALLY LEFT HOOK TO GO FIND SOMEONE ELSE, INTENTIONALLY GIVING YOU TIME TO LEAVE HOOK AREA, YOU \`DIDNT, NOT MY FAULT.
---
TSar Bomba?
---
I never said he was god tier, i just said he is an example of a player that can loop. Also, of you are rank 1, you should know that on the killer shack alone you can waste 40 seconds of the killer's time.
---
please credit the original poster u/chattywindow

FUCK THE FREDDY WHO DC‚ÄôD WHEN I USED DELIVERANCE IN THE BASEMENT AFTER CHASING ME ALL GAME I WAS LIKE 1 GEN OFF OF GETTING ALL IRREDESCENTS
---
&gt; Almost as bad as Pug saying killer is easy but can only 4K with Insidious LF.
---
In my opinion its easier to be red rank survivor than red rank Killer, thanks to SWF.
---
Welcome to dbd
---
Useful perk small game. If I see a totem im on it as soon as possible just incase of noed and those easy points
---
Thank you for telling me
---
I don't have a screenshot because i play console, but i escaped because the killer camped at only one exit gate, allowing me to escape. Mind you it was my 5th match, so killers wouldn't be very smart and so was i.
---
Even purple ranks have been ruined for me so I see that
---
Alright

Damn, I just started playing a few more months ago

WHAT IS THIS MATCH MAKING BULLSHIT? IM RANK 10 AND THE GAME I JUST PLAYED, MY TEAMMATES WERE RANK 18 AND 2 RANK 19 WITH A RANK 5 KILLER. SOMEONE FIX THIS
---
Who the fuck complains about Billy? People conplain about Spirit and nurse because they are busted. Spirit even more, since she requires no skill whatsoever
---
Clean ur ps4!
---
OP, can you attach a spoiler flair or something of the sort? Maybe a few people haven't watched the new season yet and may have something spoiled. Would be suck to have a scene spoiled :(
---
You can also find it in the shrine of secrets and get it with iridescent shrouds. It was in there a few days ago and I got it as a teachable
---
i think it is
---
Damnit this is gold
---
in game Quentin ain‚Äôt any Quentin of mine haha
---
It's mostly newer players that do this. It gets better. I have over 3,000 hours on my Xbox and I love the game. It can be frustrating at times though.
---
As a spirit main i can agree she requires very little skill, the only *skill* required is to have a basic knowledge of predictions and bam your a god spirit.
---
Thats why i've kinda diverted from playing her.
---
RIP Butter
---
I had vacuumed my PS4 before, I keep it pretty clean (Hadn't torn it open though)
---
In the Haunted Grounds perk description, the totem that doesn't get cleansed out of the 2 becomes a dull totem. Therefore, NOED could activate on it.
---
WHEN I UNHOOK YOU WHEN THE KILLER IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP DONT RUN TO THE EDGE OF THE MAPFOR HEALS IM NOT GOING TO THE CORNER TO HEAL YOU SIT UNDER THE HOOK AND LET ME USE MY WE‚ÄôLL MAKE IT
---
&gt; Firstly these were survival rates not pip rates, the relationship is not 2 way
---
Except it was at that time. The quality of other red ranks/rank 1s that I/anyone played with was much higher. Now you see red ranks who play like they just bought the game. Better players = higher survival rates. I mean, even the old stats show this. Rank 2 had a 60% survival rate and Rank 1 jumps all the way to 80%. 
---
The skill differential is a lot wider now.
---
&gt; they have to move down the line INCREASING subsequently lower ranked players winrates
---
Except they moved UP the line. Let's say that "April Rank 1s" are Group A and "August Rank 1s" are Group B. Toss in an artificial "April Rank 2‚â§4" and call it Group C.
---
Group A has an 80% winrate
---
Group C has now moved up to Rank 1 since the pipping conditionals have been improved in their favor
---
You now have Group B who (according to the April statistics) is at a combination of 80% survival rate players and 60~% survival rate players. The winrate is subsequently going to down. Grant you, not tremendously, but definitely not 80%. Factor in solo survivor rates (which are ~40%). You also need to factor in the solo survival rates.
---
All I play is solo, rarely do I get outscored, been rank 1 consistently for 2 years, and I can tell you for a fact that survival rates are not close to 80% in current state.
---
Noed works solely on dull totems, so if a survivor cleanses a HG totem, it breaks and isn't a Hex nor a Dull totem, essentially leaving the other haunted ground totem
---
I feel attacked .-.
---
Do you have the first edition one?
---
As a Quentin lover same. Give me Kyle Gallner all day
---
Let's talk about the lag that the game (at startup, loadout and after the match) currently has right now too and no one is talking about it
---
I noticed streamers, and streamer friends having this issue as well
---
I'm not having any frame rate problems on any maps as I can't relate, but I believe you
---
Yes, I got it in 2015, more specifically when they had the Destiny Bundle
---
&gt; I feel like balancing in this game is just a hard thing to do. You will have obvious and clear differences between red ranks and rank 15-20, so which do you base it off of? 
---
Killers with very high skill ceiling such as nurse will inevitably either be broken at high ranks or unplayable at low ranks. In my opinion its better for Nurse to be balanced around high ranks . Nurse being too weak at low ranks isn't really a big deal.
---
At the opposite, a newb friendly killer such as the doctor could be broken at low ranks if he had nurse's power level, and i think its fine for him to be too weak for high ranks. Nothing wrong with Newb friendly Killers that are easier to play but less viable at top ranks.
---
Think of it like League of legends. They have champions with very high skill caps that very few low ranks can play right, but even played really well they aren't broken at high ranks.
---
Oh hey, there Entit- I mean Nea!
---
Was it the only dull totem left? If it wasn't them that's some absolute ass luck
---
Thanks for all the feedback everyone. I will try to take what you all have said into account as I work on future projects.
