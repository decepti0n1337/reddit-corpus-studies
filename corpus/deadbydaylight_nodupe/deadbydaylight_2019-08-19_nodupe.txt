I should have worded it better. What I meant was that there is no counter play while with a mindgame if you have experience you can better counter the mind game
---
---
---
[removed]
---
Yeah as a survivor. Just imagine him destroying a totem while in that outfit
---
Just out of curiosity, what makes you claim that I‚Äôm racist?
---
Oh no, a killer can counter something I'm over reliant on? This is unnacceptable.
---
Gotta love spoilers in the titles. Do us a favor and kill yourself
---
That was a thing before, It was so stupid, as ur idea.
---
It says you can report people for bodyblocking in the report page, just doesn‚Äôt clarify what kind of bodyblocking. Were u killer or survival?
---
SAME!
---
**SPONGEBOB WHERE THE FUCK IS ME JUUL**
---
This is what I‚Äôd do if I saw this glitch as a killer. That person escaped, but a glitch made them stay in. They‚Äôve won at that point, and killing them there wouldn‚Äôt be a kill I deserve.
---
An emotional rollercoaster through and through. 10/10
---
Why not all three, that is best case scenario
---
I'm saying that if you are in the terror radius and they go invis the terror radius should disappear and be replaced by the whooshing sound effect
---
It is reportable, if youre holding the game as hostage or griefing the game.
---

No, you'd still need to level them up to unlock the teachables or unlock the teachables from the Shrine.

I mean if easier pips means I don‚Äôt safety pip on Plague or Myers when I get 4ks I‚Äôll take it

Putting unnecessary and incorrectly used hyphens into your sentence doesn't make you seem smart.
---
People seem to forget this is a salty rant and I'm not being serious. Please stop being an inbred and read the flair.
---
Usually when that happens its cause some pussy ass survivor disconnected because they had zero awareness in the first place.
---
What now?
---
Meyers tier 3 lunge is ‚Äúextended‚Äù which basically means ‚Äúfuck your hit box‚Äù. Very buggy
---
Yes, you'll still be able to get those three's teachable perks if you level them up. You don't need to prestige the others for the new teachables to appear in their bloodweb.
---
I hadn't heard of leaks, but a month or two ago one of the netflix twitter accounts annouced game developer partnerships, and included @BHVR.
---
1. What would the ability be 2. Does not fit with dbd lore 3. Would piss off horror movie fans that a rabbit is in the game that they do not know 4. Would piss off people who want new creative killers 5. Not the most popular fnaf character.
---
Unless youve bought their teachables from the shrine, you wont recieve teachables from killers you dont own in your bloodwebs.
---
For all we know the ST thing could be for something else. Just wait until they announce it before we know. For all we know we could be wrong or they won't release a ST chapter for a while. It could also be DBD in Stranger Things.  Also if they added one of the actual monsters into DBD then it would be a bad idea lore wise because they would be non-humanoid.
---
It's pretty obvious, I point out that it's yet another white chick, and you reply with the alternating caps in an attempt to make fun of the observation. A non-racist would not entertain such a joke let alone make it, therefore it reasonably follows that you're racist. It's not rocket science.
---
Thompson house I was a jeff running alert, small game, lithe and WGLF
---
How long after being hooked was he unhooked?
---
The idea was pretty good, just executed absolutely horribly.
---
Season 2 is probably the worst, they pay off on season 2 in season 3.
---
already? the chapter is estimated to be out early september.
---
Bodyblocking is only reportable if it holds the game hostage or to grief someone. If you do it to take hits it is not reportable. If you do it to trap someone or to get someone killed it is reportable.
---
I love Xbox üòç
---
I run lithe, dance with me, lightweight and I‚Äôll be running DS when it pops in bloodweb
---
Which is literally
---
&gt; Legion, but without the extra steps
---
Looks great! The only thing I think you really need to do design wise is just weather that jacket and pig mask so both look decrepit and decimated like they do Ingame!
---
Same reason I love devour hope. The 5 token moris are so satisfying.
---
Tbh what can a survivor rely on apart from looping?
---
It's decent, yeah. Even better on huntress because it ups her reload too.
---
wtf
---
Hey, both killer perks I've been looking for, nice. (For Huntress)
---
Devour hope is almost impossible to execute as a noob. You'll see streamers try to go from 3 to 5 stacks as soon as possible because once you hit 3 stacks the survivors are going to start hunting for totems.
---
Sprinting stops people from healing you. Mid heal too - Just start sprinting away while theyre healing you and itll automatically let you out of it.
---
When there are 4 p3 claudetts with flashlights
---
I really want to see a chapter that turns the naming conventions around. The Survivor, and the killer has a normal persons name.
---
Dont bring that shit to this subreddit.
---
If you're running in 4k, consider lowering your resolution to get better frames!
---
Negan piggy
---
I don't get why they always take such a long time to unhook someone. I get wanting to be careful but Claudette mains always always very slow at doing everything, especially unhooking.
---
I believe it was a tweet of theirs, but I have indeed seen it somewhere from the devs, saying that they wouldnt incorporate a clown into the game "because of real life phobias", yet here we are
---
The counterplay is spine chill. SC triggers based on what the actual spirit is looking at, not what the husk is looking at.
---
Bodyblocking to hold game hostage (killer blocking survivor, survivor blocking survivor)
---
And intentionally sandbagging survivors (working with killer)
---
Are only reportable forms of body blocking
---
Nice

Ubrh

Salty survivors are salty. People just don't want to spend a minute or two of play time to look for totems.
---
They are just that good!
---
Newbie= which means u r new to the game so u don‚Äôt have the experience yet, read pls, also yeah most of games as soon as u hit 3 stacks survivors will cleanse that totem ASAP.
---
Spirit is the new Legion. Bad killer mains found something else to use since they reworked him. Prayer Beads is the new Franks Mixtape. Legion was annoying and boring to go against because he completely removed survivor's tools to survive. Same thing is happening with Spirit. 
---
Brain dead players or simply biased trolls are celebrating her current state but anyone with minimal intelligence understands how harmful Spirit is to DBD's health. Not even the average Nurse player is as bad as Spirit since it requires a little more skill and you can actually juke it to some extent. 
---
My advice is, until devs address her, as soon as you see the killer is Spirit just DC or die on hook to prevent getting suspended (like most people are already doing).
---
The ONLY thing I dislike about the doctor is how out of place is weapon is, but it‚Äôs definitely unique
---
LOL at needing to use two meh perks just to counter one shitty killer
---
The Nea got caught because the Jeff healed her.
---
Getting meyers' achievement is literal hell since you HAVE to completely disregard 1 or 2 perks depending on your play style. It's something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy
---
Thank :)
---
Wellllll. Lag Switching is also cheating
---
Why are your perks wierd colors?
---
Claudette's teachables are all 100% useful, and so are Meg's and Dwight's, use them instead. David is worth it for WGLF and Dead Hard, and I like Boil Over on Kate
---
Jungle gyms and Windows vault are looping
---
if only you had another pink key
---
That could be true but think about the previous chapters, there was always a teaser for the next chapter. Instead of Dead by daylight teasing us, Netflix did it for Dead by daylight.
---
Spine Chill is good bro
---
Love Distortion. It's such a good perk but fairly underused, it can give you (or any SWF you might be joining in on) valuable information. Even if you're playing solo if you point at a locker when someone is about to get hooked people generally get the idea that the killer has BBQ.
---
Rank reset just happened bro
---
Im like level 235
---
Megheads
---
This is fuckin great
---
I like Botany Knowledge, Self-Care, Dead Hard, and Spine Chill/Dark Sense (I'm a noob don't hurt me) I also would run Quick and Quiet, Urban Evasion, Lithe, and Self-Care but I don't have all the teachables
---
Something similar just happened to me.  We were playing against a freddy who was very obviously a potato.  He didn't get anybody on hook through the whole match.
---
I finished the last gen, then ran to the exit gate.  I was running bond, and saw that two injured teammates were coming.  I thought I could open it in time to save them... nope.  
---
Freddy comes for me when the gate is at 99% (I was actually shocked it didn't open).  He downs me and they all go to the other gate.  
---
He's camping, but this guy is a legit potato. I watch them all heal and wake each other up, thinking, "yeah, they're all gonna come and get me.  This'll be easy."  
---
**NOPE**.  only the meg comes back, and she stands right beside freddy.  He doesn't even try to hit her.  He's just slashing at me over and over.
---
she fucking watched me bleed out without moving or even trying to save me...just standing there right beside freddy until I died.  
---
I was fucking livid man.
---
What the fuck did I just read‚ÄΩ
---
Then they r newbies idk man I am just saying that‚Äôs not a experience u‚Äôll get at high ranks.
---
Same with the Killer Handbook
---
Self care is the best perk
---
&gt;Your statement was pretty stupid, 
---
\&gt;&gt; Character concept presented  
---
\&gt;&gt; Identifies possible issue with character design  
---
\&gt;&gt; Gets criticized for pointing out issue  
---
\&gt;&gt; Point out racism when it happens  
---
\&gt;&gt; UHH UR WURDS R STUPID  
---
Imagine being so racist and stupid that you can't even tell when you bring in the racism. You made it a big deal by making fun of the critique made through a sarcastic remark. It's amazing to me how you can't even see your own racism. You're not racist because some person said so, one is racist for either exercising racism, doing apologetics, or trying to subdue anti-racist commentary to enable racism to continue; you're guilty of the third way.
---
I‚Äôm sitting at the Looper table, eating my fruit LOOPS. Then I get hit with NOED and my teammates don‚Äôt find it in time.
---
Um, thats like exactly what i said.
---
Iron Will is not to be under estimated. It works against every killer as well. Its a staple in all my kits. As a killer main I can say that you have no idea how loud you survivors really are.
---
Jane is thicker tho
---
key*
---
Where is the Blendette table???
---
I‚Äôm in love with her look and the first 2 perk ideas. Especially the first perk!
---
I‚Äôm gonna try to do it the splits on baby killer and survivor.
---
the day they nerf spirit.
---
Broken Before Breakfast
---
Tunneling isn't the killers objective
---
All I've heard is that PS4 is way worse than PC
---
For me on PC:
---
Survivor Queue: literally 3 seconds
---
Killer Queue: 3 minutes
---
It's pretty crap. It basically turns the shock into a ring in front of you and when survivors touch the rim they get zapped.
---
I only find it funny because if a survivor stands still, they don't get hit, meaning they're slowly killing themselves through stupidity which sort of funny. 
---
It does stack with interview tape meaning you get both the ring shock and the beam shock which is kind of neat because a survivor at close range trying to juke the beam hits the side of the ring and gets zapped.
---
Normally I love stats,  but this game has so much randomness to it that I think stats would be very deceiving. So while I get the appeal, personally I don‚Äôt want a stats page in DbD.
---
Bond, that's a Dwight perk? What's it do
---
Stake out, bond, deliverance, and head on are a few perks I like to use often but Dead Hard is personally my favorite perk. It‚Äôs hard to be successful as a solo survivor without perks like DS and Adrenaline which are sadly meta. They fit my play style really well as I find myself getting in 5 minute chases all too often and focused down because I unintentionally end up pissing off killers by doing so.
---
I don‚Äôt see many people complain about ps4 but it is pretty bad.
---
Thanks i didn't know that
---
I had fun until I realized it was at their expense üò≠
---
Thanks that's not at all what I thought it was but at least now I know.
---
The one who brought the firecracker dropped it in front of me as she tried to hook dive the other Nea. Didn‚Äôt even blind me she dropped it next to me and I killed her üò≠
---
Die
---
Lovely art c:
---
Spine Chill is the only perk I run 100% of the time on all my survivors.
---
Looper, for some reason all the killers chase me the most so I have to improvise;)
---
When i started playing DBD, I always thought that claudettes were delusional survivors with god complex. Now that i‚Äôm more experienced, I can fairly apologize. It was always the Megs
---
Wait until you get the Fleshlight
---
Jeez, alright dude, call me racist. I‚Äôm **not** but if it helps you sleep at night whatever. And your attempt to criticize their idea came across in a very dick-ish way. Instead of ‚ÄúPretty good idea, I do think that we could see some more diversity in the colours of the survivors though, overall a solid idea!‚Äù You had to go and be like ‚ÄúCool, another white chick, just what the game needs.‚Äù That‚Äôs barley a critique and more of you just being an asshole, then again, that‚Äôs been pretty apparent through this conversation.
---
Reveals all survivor locations within 36 meters
---
Maybe instead of tokens an low percentage just a straight 20/50/60% increase to lunge range
---
"And keep an eye on the gates. If they open, you must flee." - Benedict Baker
---
Killing is, though, and you'll get a quicker kill downing the injured person if someone unhooks in your face than downing the unhooker who might not have even been hooked so far.
---
Yeah I see this term being used a lot.
---
and the OP is talking about pallet looping specifically so i gave alternatives. they are looping but not the same kind that is running in circles around a safe pallet
---
Groovy
---
ü§û
---
Got my first pair of 4K's using The Wraith of all things and not a single tunnel, slug, or camp! Yeah I got called mean crap and yeah I got smashed by a few groups with maxed out Survivors, but as a brand spanking new killer I'm happy to at least have gotten this.
---
Dont worry dude. You'll eventually have a lot of your games going like that once you play long enough.
---
Same thing with Devour hope as well.  Won't show until after the first hit.
---
And then they have DS, endurance, dead hard. Wasting time while also being a complete cunt.
---
imagine a horror game being an actual horror game
---
A kid can't play Legion anymore tho
---
You can tell when shes phasing
---
Yeah that seems to be what people are saying, I appreciate the feedback.
---
Exit gate glitched so they couldn‚Äôt escape
---
Been maining him with the Ashy slashy cosmetic sine day one. The only thing that could make me switch would be if Steve turns out to be the new survivor in the next Stranger Things chapter.
---
I only tbag if I want to be tunneled bc other survivors are actually doing gens.  It's a death sentence if I mess it up most likely, but it's really only useful for me in that situation.  Ex playing nurse or wraith and I'm with gen whores.
---
Sadly?
---
My dream is for the chase music on meyers to start with that awesome guitar riff from when Michael first encounters Allison
---
Its because she has two different playstyles and it's up to the survivor to decide on which one they want to play, personally I think not cleansing is a bad move because I think being immersed early game can snowball into a gen rush. But the issue is that the community can't decide causing massive toxicity at post game chat. for the reason that one person cleansing while others do not. Since people never cleanse no one ever gets to practice looping with red puke, and I feel that it can be done for at least a little bit. Survivors also need to remember that the red puke is a time killer for plague and if you cleanse smart then you can hide while she is in red mode and wait it out. People bitch about NOED for being a one hit kill. Yet plague games literally are always like that and seem to usually be a quick one if the plague knows what they are doing against baby survivors.
---
Literally my life on console every match 
---
Ive depiped 2 ranks thanks to this
---
Implying spirit is difficult to play as LMFAO
---
You just have to own left 4 dead or left 4 dead 2 for them. At least that's how I got them just a few months ago
---
Ooga booga
---
Gen jocky
---
Not in her terror radius
---
No worries! I hope we get a full chapter, I just mostly want a new map over anything else... Its been sooo long since we have gotten a new map...
---
You scared them, or they see you crouching and are trying for cheap lols?  Idk I hate pig, I'm not doing shit but getting myself away from you asap.
---
My bad. Ps4 noob here
---
Charlie I swear to god i will lick your cat if you ever say some gay shit like that again
---
Kiss my grits
---
Me on my way to stalk ur bitch
---
Leave me alone Maxx
---
Everyone‚Äôs argument about this is the lore. That is unbelievably dumb. If you destroy the survivors you shouldn‚Äôt barely safety pip because that means you stay in the same tank to do it again
---
Regarding essentially porting the Hag's animations to the potential Demogorgon, UE4 is able to re-target animations as long as the skeletal structure is the same (including naming convention).  That includes "stretching" bones like in the Hag-&gt;Demogorgon situation.
---
I personally haven't done it myself, yet, so I won't be able to explain it in more details.  But that's the gist of it.
---
But essentially, it would be a pretty easy and painless process.
---
I know your relative location
---
Monka S
---
Except bar progress counts, not the last opening tick, so you still didn't get your daily?
---
You should report anyone telling you to kill yourself or using similar language, Behavior doesnt mess around when it comes to that stuff.
---
This has been posted this day, can't you wait a little more?
---
it definitely shouldn't be a double pip if you destroyed them that fast.
---
Clown is way more simple than legion, have bottle, throw bottle, slow player. Legion you gotta learn to predict, you gotta be accurate with your power (not too hard but definitely not easy someone's first few games) and also new players might not know you can vault pallets or that the power doesn't actually kill.
---
Youre in South Carolina monkey
---
No, because you're punishing the person who got unhooked who did nothing wrong by doing that.
---
YES YES YES YES YES!
---
Can heal fully if you hit the great skill checks
---
Holy shit, that is amazing!
---
If I walked in and saw that at a entrance, I would crap my pants
---
if you just throw bottles without actually knowing how to use them effectively Clown is complete trash, this is based on what understanding of the game a player needs to not be completely useless, Clown you gotta know how to stop loops, slow survivors down before a window or pallet, block paths, etc
---
Lmao move Spirit up to the middle
---
Loopers wya
---
DC'ing ~~as killer~~ is the worst
---
Fixed that for you.
---
If I see toxic then ima be toxic tunnel,facecamps the works
---
That first hit wasn‚Äôt lag he just hooked and smacked you in frozen time. You just couldn‚Äôt see it cuz you don‚Äôt have a stand. Sorry buddy.
---
That didn't answer my question.
---
I mean, most of the licenses survivors didn't die? Quentin, Laurie, and Ash were still alive before the were taken to the Entity's realm
---
you'd seriously say Spirit is in the middle ground for a new player? the one killer that turns survivors invisible when she uses her power
---
You're in texas
---
I thought this same thing when I read this post. That guitar rift is incredible and I was blown away by the music in the 2018 Halloween.
---
yes and I'm not sure if that's how you hold an axe either.
---
But then it's just a cycle of nobody having fun. I just wish toxicity wasn't such a big part of DBD as a whole. Just look at the biggest DbD YouTubers.
---
If I played on pc I'd use the hell out of this
---
I'd have to strongly disagree with this. With Michael you can at least see them and track them. Spirit requires you to understand loops, how survivors play, how to track with sound and limited information, etc.
---
Karma hits hard.
---
Don't let it bother you. Toxicity is only bad because people let it get to them.
---
I never played on this map lol.
---
Hopper and Steve are the best bet to being survivor, but I'm ok seeing Jonathan, Robin, Joyce, Nancy, even fucking Billy as a survivor
---
This is so sad. Can we nerf Za Worldu?
---
Sadly that's the reality tho the only way to fight toxic is to play toxic most time they DC after the first hook
---
stop
---
WHO EVER READS THIS THREAD I SWEAR IM A DIFFERENT PERSON
---
Orange tractor on Ormand? Never seen it
---
1 charge=1 second of healing i believe
---
Yay victim blaming!
---
ok how to fuck is the Trapper and the Hag harder than the doctor? I mean, I'm new to the game and I basically get only 3K or 4K every game with the Hag.
---
16 charges is one heal.
---
You can just throw the bottle in their direct path at any time and it messes up their flow, you can usually get a free hit if they touch your gas. He's simple, but I do see where you're getting at
---
 But how would they make Jason both unique AND good? Trapper is already a homage.
---
They neutered MoM, why would anyone play ash?
---
Thats really nice. I feel like a tier three myers would scarier though.
---
Fucking awesome.
---
Thank you. That would make sense then I think.
---
ok but you forgot the shitpost flair.
---
Holy shit. Dude you really are dead set on calling me a racist. Alright. ‚Äú
---
Prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.‚Äù 100%, me mocking someone who ignored a pretty cool DBD concept and instead just decided to make it all about race (which is something the creator just did because they may be white, and so they tried to make their character similar to them) means I‚Äôm some closeted racist in a safespace *alright.jpg*
---
"In time, you will come to understand the tragic extent of my failings." - that Nea, maybe
---
"Victim blaming?" You've gotta be joking. This is a video game. And what I said is true. It's hilarios how much the "ctrl" button is able to make people angry. People are only toxic because they want a reaction out of someone.
---
Actually now that I think of it, they could probably use the spirit's post match run animation with the demogrogon, she has kind of a derpy tip toe run that could work.
---
Jokes on you Pepper Pig, I have Dead Hard.
---
just look at brown medkit charges and that is as many charges that are needed for full heal
---
Don‚Äôt worry about being ‚Äúfair‚Äù as a killer. Your job is to kill in the most efficient manor you can, not to be their friend. They won‚Äôt think twice about curbstomping you if you let them, do what you gotta do to secure the kills
---
We should make a new flair system. Some kind of Wholesome Flair. Like Wholesome Ghost Face and Wholesome Pig.
---
So, that‚Äôs what a Herman Main Club would look like? Now I‚Äôm curious about the other Killer Main Clubs, mainly Amanda.
---
hag and trapper were one tier up, but i decided to group them down with GF and Pig because if no one steps on your traps, bring a flashlight, or just crouch, you are powerless.  
---
while not the only aspects of their kits, they do rely a bit on luck on top of the skill to play them, making them a bit more unpredictable for the newer players
---
NOED is my anti end game toxic survivor measure
---
I remember seeing it in a n00b3 video a while ago. I guess they removed it bc of how strong it was on the map.
---
Then she phases and slap you, bam.
---
When the knife just won‚Äôt do.
---
It‚Äôs not a punishment. Sometimes it is to your advantage to down and hook them again.
---
&gt;they won't think twice about curpstomping you
---
Not everyone is an asshole
---
60% for free is a bit too much tho
---
I wouldn‚Äôt go above 25% if it‚Äôs for free and up to 40% when you have to stack it up
---
I like how the results of the "doctor guides" search were piles and piles of monto perk builds and then the actually helpful bricky video.
---
Wake up, alert, iron will, and sprint burst. I used to like dead hard but it is too unreliable imo so I swapped it for sprint burst. Wake up is my favorite survivor perk in the game
---
oh it's just a joke added on plus I saw someone with the same post but they said key instead lol
---
I haven't seen those in a while. Could've been removed from the game.
---
Queue times would disagree with you
---
As a survivor you can tell when there's 20-18 ranked survivors in your game because no generators get done and when you're hooked you can see people crouching behind things while the killer is literally on the opposite side of the map.
---
No guarantee they have any of those perks, just like there isn't a guarantee that whoever unhooked in front of you doesn't have BT. Either way, you make a choice and it either leads to a positive or negative outcome. Doesn't instantly make it smarter to go for the unhooker.
---
No, he didn't? He/she never said "looping around pallets" specifically
---
Yup.
---
Not much you can do about the teabagging, emotes and flashlight clicking, but hey, just take it easy, it‚Äôs a casual game.
---
Works on my wglf bp farming build. BT, bond, wglf, and either UE, We'll make it, or an exhaustion perk.
---
Me running between the last three gens when the survivors need one gen to open the exit gates
---
I would argue huntress requires a little more skill to use well. Other than that yeah I'd say that's pretty accurate.
---
Right? Lmao there‚Äôs so many other things I totally disagree with but that one took the cake lol
---
I do this so my friends don't get chased. Im trying to get better at juking and getting away so what better way than to provoke the killer and try to waste as much time as possible. 60% of the time, it works every time.
---
probably because they know they can get away with it because pig isn't really in a great place right now
---
If a survivor farms another survivor, I will go for the survivor that farmed. Otherwise you are rewarding the farmer and punishing the person who got farmed.
---
youre new to the game and therefore mostly going against people that have no idea what the hell theyre doing. trapper and hag require lots of map knowledge to play perfectly, id assume needing the experience to acquire that knowledge is why they are where they are
---
Yeah but it allows the unhokee to actually play the game. That's why they bought it. To play.
---
Yah had a few killers today playing on their McDonald‚Äôs WiFi connection, plus these guys know it‚Äôs shit and use it anyways to get easy kills because they are trash at the game. When dedicated servers finally hit, these fools will be at the back of the bus with the rest of the rank 18-20 trash who can‚Äôt play the game while everyone else moves up...
---
This is very inaccurate.
---
Well theres plenty of ways considering the only thing Jason and Trapper have in common is being big and wearing a sorta similar mask.
---
Lmao sure why not
---
Do you live in rank 20? How would camping make games go faster if the survivors weren't autistic?
---
I see this argument all the time. "All it is, is hitting ctrl over and over! u mad brah?" yet anybody who isn't mentally deficient will recognize the intent of that action which is meant to humiliate the other player in order to illicit a specific emotional response. Since humans will react to that emotionally, they do it to bother you. yes it's just a game but you're zooming out to the bigger picture in order to escape this argument. We are all at least a little emotionally invested in this as we spend our time playing and toxicity will always be viewed as.... toxic.
---
I just don‚Äôt get why sometimes when I blind the killer it doesn‚Äôt drop the other survivor...
---
Yeah, that's her power.
---
Tbh I thought it was for the loud ass bing bong bell lmfao
---
I wouldn't mind the woods near will's house, with their hideout on it.
---
Why
---
I bought Freddy because I wanted to main him and then my friends told me to wait for the rework to come out.
---
It took 8 months since then, but it was worth it :)
---
I thought it was ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll never forget you‚Äù
---
Max is 32k but with pudding you can get 64k unless you do one or more daily rituals
---
Borrowed time, calm spirit, bond/unbrakeable, Adrenaline/exhaustion
---
Borrowed time: Amazing perk you should know why
---
Calm Spirit: counters so many perks and some killers, for example: infectious fright, doctor, spies from the shadows, clown (kinda), etc.
---
Bond: For solo queue, lead killers away from teamates(or towards them hehe) when in a chase.
---
Unbrakeable: For Swf, just a solid perk.
---
Exhaustion: Extend chases
---
Idk maybe make your own
---
*I AM UNTETHERED AND MY RAGE KNOWS NO BOUNDS*
---
Well sorry, but ST has already basically been confirmed? And has likely been in the works for months upon months.
---
You just slide it in.
---
This never seems to not happen for me. I have no real grasp on Killer yet but I‚Äôm always out against rank 10s. I need to kill baby Dwights so I can at least have a fair chance
---
What the fuck man
---
This! I‚Äôm always expecting it to be the Ruin and then I always end up missing that first red skill check afterwards when it isn‚Äôt
---
32k. Pudding gets 64k. Bbq adds another 32k, so with all 3 its 96k. Dailies can boost it higher, I think mori dailies givethe most at 60k, so with that too the max would be 156k.
---
That would be cool. But they should fix the default mode now
---
Can the man not rant? He isn‚Äôt wrong when he says there is no counterplay. Why so hostile?
---
Says a kid can play them but my trophy list disagrees
---
Cutie
---
This deserves a platinum.
---
Maybe I'm showing my age here but what the heck is a non-member build?
---
Running: No One Left Behind / Deliverance / We're Gonna Live Forever / Adrenaline
---
Oink at them and they will cower in fear, then give them a party hat
---
More shots

---
I'd rather have a Hellraiser chapter over anything.
---
I swear to god, almost every time I run an endgame build the game ends before all gens get popped. Like, if you run an endgame build, you're more likely to succeed for some reason.
---
I mean it‚Äôs not that deep (apart from the kys shit) just report and hook them so they just call you toxic instead
---
You just said survivor was about fun.
---
I just can't find a main, how do you know?
---
It works. It's an animation issue. Grabs aren't instant and survs have time to react during animation.
---
Swing chains is 3% per survivor. So off the bat it's 12%
---
What‚Äôs BMed?
---
32K+X2 w/ BBQ+103% with gruesome gateau+X5 with survivors = I‚Äôm lazy.
---
Old legion was also bugged and everyone was abusing the bugs. Spirit is just good. Almost all other killers are getting looped and playing them feels unwinnable. Omg an unloopable killer! Tragedy! Nerf her! I also dislike versing her every game just like knowing I'll probably die but I don't have to escape to pip, the solution I suggest is buff all killers. I think they're too weak overall. -A dedicated survivor main.
---
I'm surprised nobody's said Bubba yet. He's just a scared baby who does whatever his family says to do. He kills in this game because of a similar feeling given from the Entity. I feel like if his family was (somehow) there, he'd rather work for them instead of the Entity. Maybe even against it.
---
I can see Freddy turning as well.
---
They patched it a while ago. It happened when you combined both 'blade' add one
---
Nothing, I checked and did some stuff with the files and it didn't help, and then I uninstalled and reinstalled the games and nothing happened. I guess it's just a waiting game now.
---
TBH, if it weren't for my friend who taught me how to use the flashlight, I would have done the same
---
Looks a little weird with the denim, but good job on the mask.
---
Because there are too many (growing) variables like personal play style and builds.
---
because stats are pointless for a game like this.
---
The clown runs 15mph and has the bombs that confuse and disarray you. How is he not ok the highest of tiers?! He is soo easy to use
---
Not seeing many people big up the perk called spinechill, so underrated
---
Oh okay I‚Äôll check them out tomorrow! Thanks man!
---
How do you switch?
---
Hey, it works.
---
I used to listen a lot of soundcloud synth as well I still do haha it is a really good place to find new stuff. I also find user made spotify playlists and youtube playlists are good as well, spotify has the same recommendations system that usually is pretty nice
---
Gen Jockey table. I finish 1 gen and I'm off to find another
---
A Fresh Trail seems super OP. 
---
New meta perk?
---
When a survivor repeatedly clicks his flashlight at you after you lose sight of them.
---
Because they don‚Äôt give us a good representation of an actual thing
---
You can‚Äôt use global stats, as inexperienced players would affect them (they gave us some stats. Hag has the most kills per match. Do you think she‚Äôs the strongest killer in the game?)
---
You can‚Äôt use ‚Äúhigh ranks‚Äù either as the ranks aren‚Äôt an accurate skill rating
---
OP add-ons would also break a thing or two. Iri head huntresses will probably always 4k, moving the characters stats up, while not being an accurate example of a match against the huntress
---
This comment section shows the average survivor playstyle and it it's sad.
---
In order of likelyhood, Steve, Nancy, Hopper. Steve and Nancy because of another possible clue from the devs a few weeks ago, but Steve gets bonus points for being much more of a fan favorite than Nancy.
---
they already have IT in the game. oh wait clown is his cousin
---
I've never seen a killer abuse a survivor like that. 
---
Like cmon, he's been stabbed twice, now ya gonna kick him?
---
I wasn‚Äôt entitled a win, but him slashing me on hook and shaking his head no being a dickhead wasn‚Äôt needed. And the comment had a single typo but was still understandable
---
Played it. Killer only goes for you and when you start working on a gen they instantly teleport to it. Almost completely flat map with items locked behind ads. Fellow survivors don‚Äôt save you from hooks. 
---
Overall 10/10 game will continue to play it and can‚Äôt wait to see it grow
---
Yea it is so the survivor should have fun too. But in reality the killer is trying to take away(kill if you will) the fun
---
where is Satan?! why isn't Satan in this game?!
---
Getting seen with BBQ is needed to get the killer away from the hook. You should try to invite the killer to travel across the map while your team recovers the hooked survivor. If a killer sees no one with bbq, he will camp the hook until he finds one and that is more detrimental to the team. Also hiding in lockers does not progress the game. I am not defending the Nea that you described but she isn‚Äôt wrong in her complaint about you.
---
Survivors could also bring BPS
---
Also, there‚Äôs the 103% cake for a little bit more
---
I just checked again and spit out my drink
---
No love for my girl Robin üíî. I know she's new but she's iconic.
---
I ain't doin that math. Someone carry on my legacy.
---
Maaan, Robin would be great too. I'd be down for her getting added as the Survivor. Joyce too.
---
Lore wise it would never work and we already have a clown
---
Most killers have a bullshit OP build that combines two high rarity add one. This build for freddy is rather on the weaker side of strong class builds. Even with a permanent 12% debuff, survivors are still able to do gens extremely quickly. The only way to truly slow the game down is to apply pressure, and swing chains doesn't help with that.
---
You know why? Because killers are fucking oppressed
---
You must not have read thoroughly then lol Julie was the one that kinda manipulated Franks insecurities and stuff (because she wanted to leave the town) and so the gang formed and when they went on their little escapade of vandalizing a store and a janitor caught them and grabbed Julie, he attacked the guy defending her.
---
Nobody likes ruin hillbilly
---
Can I use the puppet head with the puppet glove?
---
Honestly the nurse is one of the easiest killers
---
It's a been a while.
---
They have to have the survivor completely picked up. If the blind happens during the pick up animation they just get normal blinded. Same thing for pallet saves.
---
Bond: Good perk, avoid interrupting gen progress, find teammates to heal you, maximize time efficiency.
---
Spine Chill: Counter stealth killers, good to let you know when to commit to an objective.
---
Iron Will: frick spirit &gt;:((( also it's a good perk
---
Lithe: Vault to z o o m.
---
Ah yes those clicking little asshats, just as bad as the teabaggers lol
---
God all you need for a Freddy cosplay is a stripey jumper, a hat and some knife gloves. Oh also to be greatly burned as a child and have huge scars covering your face.
---
There is no ranking system so a rank 20 could go against ranks 3 players
---
I knew what it was for, but believed it would work WAY better than it did. So here's rank 20 me flashing the light at a killer in a chase. It didn't work very well.
---
‚ÄúYou are really good so I‚Äôm going to punish you for being good‚Äù ..... this is why we need more anti tunneling perks .
---
Re-reading it, I get it now. Thought it showed boxes when the trap went on, not activated.
---
Have you put yourself in that position? You'd get angry too at the unfairness of it. Don't do things you don't want to happen to you.
---
Because you can‚Äôt determine that kind of thing in a game like this. One killer that can be called ‚Äúunderpowered‚Äù by the community can be godlike when used by certain players. It‚Äôs inconsistent. Also, the game relies heavily on RNG, so you can‚Äôt get a valid reading on skill. There are skillful things players can do to do well in a game, but RNG plays a big hand in deciding who will win or lose.
---
And you might have even been a rank 1 before the reset.
---
still, the doctor is very underrated the tier list, I think it should be the harder alongside with nurse. You REALLY have to know where to use his abilities or you're mostly unable to do anything as the killer.
---
I've probably forgotten more about this game than you've ever known about it.
---
When the moon hits your eyes like a TICC pizza pie
---
I was trying to make it fun for the low rankers, not set up shop near the hook.  I didn't intend to even use the mori, until everyone DC'd and the last guy just walked up to me and pointed at hooks..    
---
I wanted jump scares.    
---
They did not enjoy jump scares.  :(
---
for an experienced player yes, because if you play her constantly you'll know how to destroy survivors with her, but this is not about that
---
As a girl, can confirm
---
on xbox it's in the network setting so ima assume it the same for ps4 but you just have to test your nat type until say ok it's open then you should have a wider rang of people to play with since it open instead of moderate
---
Nice flex
---
Sure that's a neat theme but the result is killers talking *way* to long to rank out of ranks they are too skilled for. That's not fun for anyone.
---
oh absolutely, this has nothing to do with how strong the killers actually are, with high tier killers like Nurse, Spirit, Freddy, Hag, and Billy being all over the place
---
I was üòî
---
Low ranks actually fall for it so i understand.
---
That's right, that's me baby!
---
yeah, still when I get swf and people that know that by crouching you doesn't trigger the traps (which is, like, 95% of the matches) I still get 3 or 4k. It's not THAT hard to know where to place the traps and when to tp or not
---
I get what u say but when I was new to the game I understood how to play her immediately
---
Not my game, watching a friend via share play on PS4, I just don't understand how it went the whole game without being found, and it was like 3 feet off a gen, my friend did not get the angle I wanted but I just had to share this bs spawn
---
The eyes are probably the best part
---
I still want a killer based on crows and birds
---
It's almost like DBD is a video game for fun and there are many different ways and people who play it.
---
Once I wanted to get chased and teabagged so the killer will come after me and I ran him around the whole match, then he facecamped me the rest of the match, I dm‚Äôd him to ask why he played so toxic and he said ‚Äúu started the toxicity‚Äù and I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI had a ritual to get chased‚Äù
---
And he just answered ‚Äúshit...‚Äù
---
I tend to get to the purple ranks before reset, but right now I'm rank 9 I think.
---
His watermark is there.  So he is credited.  What do you think is the purpose for watermarks.  If anything this is free advertising for him homie
---
Thanks for the idea lmao
---
When will this sub get new memes?
---
You would be surprised how many people just stop and watch them die on hook waiting for...I have no idea what.
---
yes, but that small delay might be fixed in dedicated servers were its not based on killers to survivors connection but rather killer and survivors to the fames servers
---
yes, the watermark i can barely read LOL
---
Did your brain just produce a signal? To the wall street journal with you!
---
Actually just had a game like that. I feel like i lost a few braincells on that one. It was bubba too lol
---
Honestly it really just depends on the region imo.
---
Exactly, that about sums up my thoughts as well. Plague is a very interesting killer
---
Hello illy I think
---
Un-Nice
---
I stopped using kindred for this reason.  I'm back up to 14 so it's not always, but its 100x worse than anything else to me.  Seeing people slowly creep up for front row seats for my death isn't terrible, but seeing 1 aura disappear while two crouch walk around drives me nuts
---
What about Hop? Also, I got you to 69, an no one upvote this or downvote this anymore.
---
That is the only option survivors have since they nerfed everything else .  No stealth , no 360 , slow vaults , slower pallet slams , reduced pallets and giving us no self options to stop camping or tunneling besides a perk that got nerfed .  
---
‚ÄúSometimes I will tunnel someone if they have proven difficult to catch ‚Äú That is the definition of punishing someone who did nothing wrong besides being good at the game . The game is how you make it to be. You chose to tunnel him and saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the game‚Äù is an excuse .  I don‚Äôt know why people can‚Äôt admit to being a tunneler.  If that‚Äôs how you play , fine , just admit to it
---
Can't wait for Doppio to be added to the game, now that boy's a cutie.
---
That‚Äôs very true! This game helps me to learn emotions management. Try to have fun in each match.
---
No offense, but why do people actually like Barb
---
I wish. Since they dropped a Nuke on legion I need a new fast pace killer.
---
Ok but what about Shaq from Shazam?
---
Lol, ofcourse they both had Decisive Strike and Self Heal
---
Sandbagging pos survivors. Also a non bt hook farmers. Of course I‚Äôll down the hooked person just to ruin their emblem or their stack of wglf but I let them get picked up while I troll the troll.
---
Allow me to correct myself as you appear to misunderstand. Strange hill for *you* to die on. There we go, glad I could help üòä
---
&gt; It's a terrible strategy for the killer.  
---
To be fair, I got chewed out the other night for proxy camping two adjacent hooked survivors who the team was actively trying to rescue. Sometimes "camping" is 100% the right thing to do. Part of the issue is that no one can even define it.
---
the exit gate daily is literally "open an Exit Gate" doesn't matter how much of the gate you opened yourself, as long as you're the one who actually opens it.
---
I felt this way about the trapper when I started out. He was my first P3, but I‚Äôve fallen off the saddle with him in the past few months. :(
---
&gt; Yeah but that makes the game more annoying than scary for the survivor.  
---
What does? 
---
&gt; here‚Äôs no hope against a 5 blink nurse with a mori, 
---
I'm not sure how that's on topic.
---
I don't think I really understood your comment.
---
This is the cutest thing I've seen today. Take my upvote, please!
---
You guys forgot to add double bp into your ultimate math equations.
---
Reminder why auto-sacrifice for the last survivor needs to be removed.
---
What do you mean in the last part of this comment?
---
Did you explain yet?
---
He didn‚Äôt do anything wrong tbh it looks to me like u were being toxic and healing outside of exit and got moried
---
Yeah it makes sense lore-wise, but it's still kind of annoying in actual gameplay
---
I wish there were more killers like you.
---
I'm too impatient. Explain!
---
I once got tunneled the whole match, I always managed to escape the killer, make a gen, then back to the chase, I was with 3 baby Dwights, I got hung after opening the exit gate and making sure the Dwights survived, and they left me, I‚Äôm glad they left tho, I still got double peep so it‚Äôs fine I guess
---
Wait its going to be functional??! Yikes thats scary and cool.
---
This hillbilly is rocking bbq, hooks THIS Claudette and instantly goes and tunnels down the Meg. I unhook Claudette and she just takes off, he comes running to me, I run around a corner and she pops out of a locker and he tunnels her down. (I would've done the same.) My swf saves the Meg and she runs from her. He hooks Claudette and darts right back to Meg. She then let's her self die on the 2nd hook as my friend is about to save her. Claudette instantly goes back down and I'm done across the map starting a gen, I see he leaves her, and so I start to head that way. He then picks her up, so I get in a locker to prevent him from seeing me, and he lets her wiggle free. He then let's her break the hex totem, and ends up getting me. He hooks me in the basement and she saves me directly infront of him. So I'm like okay, maybe he's farming and I was being Jeff to do a daily. So i start running and jump in a locker to avoid his chainsaw. Then get out and start a gen. He then knocks me directly back down and hooks me, let's her hook farm me and knocks me back down just to instakill me. Then let's her hook farm my swf, until she lagged out due to losing power. So he stomps the hatch and takes this claudette to let her escape, so I message him like dude what the fuck? Because why pretend to farm to kill someone? He tells me, that we "wouldn't help her" and she's the only one who realized we were farming. UMM, I wouldn't be standing directly next to you if I didn't realize that, you just decided to hook farm us with the worse survivior on our team. So thanks, thanks for ruining our match Claudette and wonderful Hillbilly. Dbd is seriously so fucking fun lately.
---
best reply thus far:  "eat chipotle ass"    
---
\&gt;friend request declined.    
---
:(
---
Next killer is demogorgon, practically confirmed on twitter.
---
It's there now lol.
---
Oh wow hello :O
---
Ez baby survivor, no such thing as chivalry in the entity's realm
---
If you're too good at looping, I get angry.
---
That is unique i hope you remember him.
---
Um wrong,  that's not me. But if you'd like to read my explanation now instead of assuming it's there.
---
Yes.
---
I think everyone can relate. I love my big, buff Russian pastry puff, Huntress. Knew I‚Äôd enjoy playing her as soon a she joined the roster and I haven‚Äôt looked back!
---
unpopular opinion buckle up is a great perk to know if your slugged friend is actually recovering and not a dumbass
---
Mori= fake farmer
---
As long as their perks don't make crows utterly OP at detecting/interfering with the survivors, I support this idea fully.
---
Damn
---
A show that explores each survivors/killer  backstory up until the moments when they first find themselves in the fog would be kool. Each episode or maybe other episode focusing on a new survivor/killer. Could even be a mini series. Similar to that Mortal Kombat youtube miniseries that explored live action versions of each character.
---
Wiggle running gets you tunneled and camped. I instant heal also.
---
Basically, because up until the fake farm I hadn't been hooked. He was having a hard time getting me, which is sad because I was jeff.
---
yep.  the sub reflects the community.  theyve got decent memes though so I stick around
---
Ya know, I felt this one way too deep.  I entered DBD at the same time as the Doctor, and though I've wandered amongst the killers, even though I don't play Doctor as often as I once did, I still keep him leveled up.  He's my killer I use when I want to try out perk combinations, and the deadly surprise for when I need to blow off steam.  
---
I think that even though he's not the best, and in fact can be absolutely infuriating to play at times, it should speak volumes that he's managed to resonate in the community the way he has.  Doesn't help that he's got a very nice sense of fashion.
---
Nice art too!  I love your style.  Sorry for the rant up there, but what can I say, I like to think we all have a little Spark of Madness in us.
---
Hag certainly has wendigo elements woven in there.
---
Swim in their delicious tears!
---
They salty cause you did your job. Gg.
---
Omg that would be so scary. Like can you imagine a giant spider putting you on hook and chasing you through tight corridors like on Haddonfield. Omg üò±
---
lol. I also play survivor as well so I understand their frustration, I even said sorry after the game and they still went on to shit talk that is why you are rank 9 and all. The players who shit talk only play one side and they don't care about the other which is sad.
---
I take breaks from the game. Basically didn‚Äôt play at all last month except with my son which made me feel bad because he‚Äôs a rank 15 at best so I end up playing killers who just aren‚Äôt very good so unless I have a survival daily I‚Äôll usually give them the kill. I play on Xbox and when it released on game pass I got a poor killer who was playing his first match ever as killer against me at rank 4 and 3 new players at rank 20. Had to invite him to our party after the match just to apologize.
---
To elaborate: Once per person.
---
The way i prepare for the new chapters release I usually grind to 1mil bloodpoints and get some shards for when it releases so I can use all the BP then spend my shards on the perks I have, then I prestige them. I usually just take a break once I got what I need to prepare for the chapter as it gives time for other games and maybe check the sub for leaks considering Bhvr keeps leaking stuff.
---
Now I do have my toxic moments and sometimes take out a bad match on the next killer.
---
Fun fact; I run Spies from the Shadows on my Hag and Wraith.
---
For some ODD REASON, A lot of people will immediately sprint away from a hag trap, so the crows alert me with way they go. 
---
Most of it is because I place all my traps in darker denser brush so hiding from me is a lot harder. : )
---
Do what you gotta do to win guy, no apologies

Get your Bibles here
---
*Dies in a 4K* "That's why you are rank 9!" 
---
If they call you a trash killer I always reply that I indeed am a trash killer, I kill trash like the whiny survivors bitching at me in post-game chat. 
---
I can understand their frustration though but you weren't even using Insta-Saw. Insidious is a little weird but I see nothing wrong with Ruin on Billy.
---
You can always turn chat off if it bothers you that much.
---
Lot of people in here are claiming they never tea bag the killer, but I get tea bagged in probably over 80% of my matches if I'm not completely blowing out the other team.    
---
I have been trying to get my wife into the game.  She's absolutely terrible and Rank 20.  I watch her go up against teams that could easily be purple rank, maybe red rank and they tea bag her a lot, too, even completely aware that she's obviously a brand new killer.  It kills my opinion of the game and the people who play it to see that kind of thing happen so consistently and nothing is done about it from the development side.
---
r/dontputyourdickinthat
---
I bet they cry when good killers absolutely shit stomp them. Chances are they don't survive much.
---
It bases your searches off the highest ranked player so if one if you is significantly better than the other then it's basically a 3.5v1. If that's not the case probably hard luck, SWF on even skill levels is a huge advantage thanks to comms
---
I‚Äôm a gen jockey, I have a baby chair a the looper table
---
That‚Äôs why I use a blood warden/NOED combo, one shot, and they‚Äôre trapped
---
Oh, okay.
---
True, he might be like ‚Äúboringgggg, ima try and kill the entity!‚Äù
---
OR, hit the one that just got unhooked, and then chase the unhooker.  Win-win.
---
Wait is that the only thing it does? I thought it made it blind quicker. I don't see how it could make the Killer's screen any brighter/useful for the survivor.
---
I have no idea actually
---
I don't understand what's wrong?
---
One of doctors skins gives him a baseball bat.
---
Have the same problem and this solution doesn't work
---
I think it was more the moonwalking thing being unavoidable. I just remember hating playing Legion, and that holds true to this day.
---
Can't say for certain, but they're attracted to blood and they're very resilient, that's all I can really say.
---
It would be the new toxic standard outfit. Nea dethroned.
---
I would love to see that as a bonus
---
Bloodhound
---
Enduring.
---
We have stuff like that. What about his power?
---
Blendette**
---
yes, and I'm agreeing with your defend of my point
---
The level up screen is covering up the bloodweb and I couldn't buy anything it was covering up
---
woah woah woah?
---
well they kinda do have a nobody considering its reboot freddy
---
For new players yes if your joining a old players lobby. This means your queued with higher ranked killers than what you should / normally would be queued against.
---
You are strong and wise and I am very proud of yoi
---
Noed makes it hard to save, especially since it only activates after the exit gate is powered so people are reluctant to try and make saves and the killer is alittle more campy.
---
Thanks!
---
I think Jack Torrence should be a killer and either Wendy or Danny the Survivor.
---
Also, the skill difference isn't linear. Usually Rank 1 and 5 isn't too far off skill-wise, than say Rank 15 and 20.
---
LMAO
---
If you're somehow good at nurse on controller, go for it.  Otherwise, Billy and Spirit are the way to go.
---
You're seriously saying survivors arnt op?
---
I didn't discover it
---
Here's an idea.... WALK away from the pallet. If she is phase walking she won't know you are WALKING away from the pallet. If she is phase walking, she won't know, if she isn't, she will destroy the pallet or walk around it and that's when you run. If she doesn't while you are walking away, keep walking until you get some distance while she is phase walking. Don't rely on pallets like that. There are more options than a pallet standoff....
---
Swf can also end up being too altruistic keep that in mind when working together. Saving is fine be smart about it also do gens. Coordinate tell your friend when appropriate "stay on gen someone's coming for me"
---
Sometimes sacrificing yourself for your friend can be a smart play too given the right situation.
---
Also you said you're only been playing a week and your friend only a few matches. Just keep practicing as your rank goes you'll also more likely get better survivors on your team too.
---
alright mate, you see captain knuckles over there? that a survivor, he just cleansed a totem thinking it's ruin and goes to finish a gen suprised that the totem is still alive, so he goes back out searching for it and when he finds it he says the sentences in the meme, ruin says: you have a lot of nerve coming in here with the killer perks BBQ, spirit fury and enduring behind him(i know there are 5 perks in the meme, sorry about that) to signify that captain knuckles is about to demolished by the killer's routine to check on the totem every 5 seconds.
---
that it.
---
Tbh kindred should be a passive perk that everyone has, would make it easier for solo queue
---
It‚Äôs one of the many rules from the survivors made up rule book, the more you play the more rules you‚Äôll discover.
---
They get downed immediately after and DC
---
Flashlights are toxic insta heals are also toxic keys are toxic and will get you tunneled killers also have rules
---
Twitch salt is the tastiest.
---
Is she walks around the pallet, loop her again or run to another place... if you pay attention when you walk away, you should be able to evade her again...
---
His perks are useless and he‚Äôs EXTREMELY loud when he‚Äôs injured, iron will is pretty much required when playing as him.
---
absolutely beautiful and well done!
---
No no.  See, your problem was that you're rounding your corners too wide.  Just a little more practice, youll get there!
---
You seem like the toxic one tbh
---
Look at the survivor here are the requirements
---
3 perks that have to do with the survivor
---
Must be main character of the show. If not must be very very relevant and featured in almost all episodes
---
(Optional) different outfits for the survivor. The demengorgen also has these optional
---
Nurses calling does not work for mending only healing so on legion it‚Äôs not that good
---
I feel like I just watched a pilot episode of an anime series
---
I had a game this was my ruin, I got a 4k because they killed themselves trying to get it.
---
However sometimes people overlook the obvious as well. Every go mad looking for your keys or tv remote or other item for it to have just been on the table in the open the whole time?
---
Doctor main? I dont know why but that is kind of sad
---
Nice.
---
Maybe not a baby.  But he runs self care so he is automatically ass at the game.
---
Working in the Twich salt mines means that you bring a certain ... flavor... home with you.
---
This's happened to me once. Was using Huntress and I downed the last guy but I just walked with him around this exact map cause I felt bad. After the match sent home m a message asking if he liked the trip and he said yeah. I'm a good nice killer like that sometimes ( ever time tbh)
---
It has but these never fail to give me a laugh.
---
thought it was always like this...
---
As others said, once per match. It should also be noted that failing the skill check counts, so you literally get one try per match.

Dude that sucks so bad... daily's are the fcking worst!
---
My money is we get a trailer or official word during gamescon
---
If the killer is sentient, they will wait for me to get far enough from the pallet that I can't go back and get a free hit. Again it's a lose-lose situation
---
:0 really well done!
---
Fatty
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind getting face camped
---
You‚Äôre toxic because you could‚Äôve just said GG and dipped. People always wait for responses just leave and play another game
---
Play solo= 1-2 minutes. Or 2 man SWF= 2-5 minutes. 
---
4==10 -20 minutes
---
99 to 100
---
I'd play ash and I'm a fan of him however up until his release I bought all the DLC but between the constant rotating bugs and some other personal issues with the game I'm not giving them any more money as I don't feel they deserve it right now. Maybe someday.
---
Not really because the current state of the game severely punishes killers that go for the freshly unhooked survivor (see: Borrowed time, decisive strike, new emblem/ranking system)
---
*cuddles Ghostface*
---
Just got spirit and went up against an swf with four DS, two insta heals, two adrenaline, and a load of other top tier meta perks. I only had one meta perk (noed) and didn't even use it, mind gamed the crap out of them and got a 4k. They still called me toxic for having noed but hey whatever man! I didn't feel bad given their build. Just happy that I'm getting used to playing spirit!
---
I always thought it meant ‚ÄúBitch Move‚Äù
---
Then they reworked it, because when I played last, which has been quite a while to be fair, bar progress counted towards the '0/2 exit gates opened with X survivor".. Which always sucked.
---
We still exist, just not like in leave it to beaver anymore. I drag stacks of milk crates around all night and ship it to different milk distributors. I do wear the white jumpsuit though, so i guess that part has stayed the same.
---
Needing to get someone out the game fast to regain pressure. Of course i normaly just slug because DS exists and its not enjoyable to be focused. Most of the time i go after the unhooker knowing the person off the hook needs to heal.
---
If they let you get far enough away from the pallet, they are on the other side of it, you can run when you notice they start moving... you have a gap between you and them, you should have time to get to another loop. If they let you gain distance on them, its not the killer that is the problem.
---
you can let it go through without hitting it to store it for next time, assuming it gets activated next time
---
I mean if you prefer ds working with no restrictions like before, good for you.
---
I always keep spine chill in my third slot just to have it that much closer to the middle of my screen.  Good post OP :)
---
Dude whenever you‚Äôre playing a swf like that just hook camp one and eventually they‚Äôll all play super stupid trying to get the unhook. Easy 4k after they start playing for unhooks rather than to win.
---
I don't know how you've done it, but you've made a woman wearing a decapitated pig head and a greaser jacket attractive. Nice job!
---
And dont forget the asshole killers who equipped bond and empathy... yeah im not joking that was possible
---
I use ironwill, and lightweight. I don't leave scratch Mark's, and when I do. It's when I'm out of sight. I make a lot of turns, not leaving scratch Mark's. Hide my blood stains on grass. 
---
The spirit seems very easy to mind game imo with those 2 perks. They often have no clue where I went.
---
Sorry but you're adding to the toxic behavior. Next time just move on and dont encourage this behavior if you dislike it.
---
Oh! I didn't know that lol thank you!
---
I LOVE YOUR ART STYLE, IT'S GORGEOUS &lt;3
---
When you play fair:
---
The survivor get salty:
---
the killer : OK IM GONNA BE SLATY LIKE YOU GUys ugh ÿ≠.ŸÖ.ar

I'd guess they are being toxic like that cause you were running Bleach with Garnish make up kit. They were using an Insta and they were higher rank, so they were still being ass hats.
---
If someone unhooks right in front of you, there is no problem going for the injured guy other than the fact they might have ds or borrowed time. It's the farmers fault, not yours.
---
Yes
---
You realize his eyes and mouth are pried open mechanically?
---
I did say gg.. didn't even expect him to be there since he died off early. Can't expect me not to respond to a salty twitch streamer.
---
Observe the person defecating in high pasture.
---
when you have more fun playing one character over all the others. if you don't, you don't. some people like variety.
---
Quentin is my first P3 and I'll have you know it's because I'm a Nightmare on elm Street fan and I'm not a jerko when I play him either!
---
It always used to happen with old Freddy, I miss him
---
You can see the toxicity in the screenshot.
---
If you weren‚Äôt toxic, you wouldn‚Äôt have left those other messages. Whether you like it or not, you were toxic.
---
you know you can reply directly to comments right? You left like 6 directly on the video
---
Ah yes, every rank 13-20 survivor that has watched noob3, ochido, demi and the likes
---
False
---
The fact that you even got one kill against a SWF like that as leatherface is pretty incredible. I‚Äôd suggest not torturing yourself anymore and stop playing as the worst killer in the game
---
Yeah but I'm not gonna run 2 perks to counter one killer. It's a waste
---
It also doesn‚Äôt help that injured survivors are easier to find
---
I mean when right next to an open exit gate, the killer would be a fool not to camp.
---
Exactly
---
Killers don't stagger. So the less stagger you have the less ground you lose after a fall.
---
How do you know my daily schedule?
---
Making Bubba work is kind of a nightmare, especially at the higher ranks. Spirit Fury + Enduring makes it easier to get saws off, but... he's still, uh, a handful.
---
Hope his rework comes sooner than later.
---
Interesting how you block out the twitch streamers name. As if trying to hide video evidence of ‚Äúplaying fair‚Äù.
---
(Past broadcasts btw)
---
The killer doesn‚Äôt stagger and neither will you so even if you don‚Äôt get a burst of speed you‚Äôll still be running from the killer rather than staggering and they hit you
---
How is Plague going to harm the entity? Last time I checked the Entity was vaccinated.
---
anal beads, hate them dude
---
It's actually that survivors stagger so much that killers gain a lot of ground on you when you fall during a chase. Balanced Landing can make some multi-level loops infinite because of the reduced stagger.
---
Im pretty sure this was a humble brag because you're doing fine, but if you think you need help, this video can help you improve a lot.  
---
  
---
https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ
---
I managed to get the adept achievement in my first match. I think was just extremely lucky though though the matchmaking.
---
Killers do not stagger at all. They drop straight down, almost guaranteeing a hit to a survivor without balanced landing.  
---
Balanced Landing is by far my favorite exhaustion perk (besides head on) for the stagger reduction alone. Though it‚Äôs situational,  it‚Äôs helpful on The Game, Haddonfield, coal tower and other maps for the extra boost.
---
Temporary bans can‚Äôt be appealed.
---
use Iron Will
---
I‚Äôm gonna give platinum tomorrow
---
Consoles have bill now it's quite epic.
---
Is this your friend?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/csc62p/how_did_i_get_a_7_day_ban_for_unsportsmanlike
---
I don't believe I've ever come across a salty Jeff player. As for saltiest, probably Nea or Claud
---
Agreed
---
Sadly if the demogorgon is the killer then it would probably be a lot like Freddy only being able to kill you in the upside down but if the demogorgon finds a spot which is generated around the map every different game like the hatch, then maybe the demogorgon could come to the real world. Plus we already have Jonathan in the game already. His nickname is just quentin smith.
---
Or feng I‚Äôve seen a lot of salty fengs
---
Fucking zoooom
---
Claudettes are the most. Quentins and Jeffs are gentle creatures.
---
Iron Will is a great perk.  It‚Äôs not situational if you only want it against a spirit.  I use it in replace of Self Care because it makes me feel more at ease when I‚Äôm hurt and cannot heal.  
---
With iron will it‚Äôs really easy to mind game a spirit because she relies on sound during phase (easy when you learn obviously).  I like to stop in my tracks and then creep away. It‚Äôs gotten me out of a lot of chases but even when it doesn‚Äôt, it buys me more time to extend the chase rather than being two tapped
---
I thought Claudette was the toxic player's character?
---
Sorry new to reddit I thought I was but I got so many replies I got lost. My bad to everyone
---
This is literally the one thing I actually like about Doctor - instant treatment mode grabs.  So many survivors don't know about it so they think they can mindgame you into swinging when they try to unhook.
---
I haven't played Pig that much but this has happened to me a few times.  I figured I was just too late or something.
---
I'll just dc from commenting on the thread anymore lol
---
Ace is so sneaky.
---
In the hallway with the killer because I‚Äôm a friendly survivor
---
Those are some fancy perk icons.
---
Want a prize or something ? This isn‚Äôt hard to fo at all
---
It's a forum rule that you have to block out the identifying info.
---
Yeah but you just haaaaad to say ‚Äúyou got smoked by a leather face!‚Äù Like cool, congrats but gloating rather than taking the win loses all credibility when you could have just let them be salty and not stoop to their level.
---
Iron will should be good enough. And If u don't run lightweight, just hide your tracks somehow.
---
Not false actually? Lol We already knew there was a netflix related Chapter coming this year, and lately, theyve been rather heavy handed with the stranger things clues.
---
September 3
---
Big oof boy. That's what we call the anti-docs. The same people that play hoovy in TF2 and minigun people when they're not looking.
---
still better than dead by daylight
---
Make sense to me, do we know what time that is?
---
I'd be more surprised if we get no news.
---
Awesome! c: congrats dude!
---
Lagswitcher.
---
Kobe‚Äôing is just a nickname for taking yourself off the hook (it‚Äôs a 4% chance of success, so it‚Äôs kind of a long shot like in basketball where some people yell ‚Äòkobe‚Äô before trying to shoot the ball halfway across the map). Doing so normally isn‚Äôt BMs and even in this situation it‚Äôs not necessarily bad manners, but doing it at the point where it will force you to go into second hook is incredibly stupid and makes it seem like a dive move for wasting another players time.
---
I did not know that! Thanks!
---
Myers 100%. Balanced, fun to play against, offered a unique one hit down mechanic etc.
---
I always thought it was the Huntress DLC. First ranged killer, is free, and two of David‚Äôs perk are solid.
---
Spamming windows/locker/pallet vaults or whatever to get my attention and not stopping, teabagging relentlessly after every single dropped pallet, trying to get in my face and get my attention at every opportunity even when I'm focused on someone else at the moment. You want my attention? Fine. You got it, and you're not gonna like it now that you do.
---
I love your comics. The aluminum bat is my go to weapon!
---
FYI bodyblocking isn't BM, sandbagging is
---
Bodyblocking = stepping in front of the killer to stop him from chasing someone
---
Sandbagging = blocking someone's path so they get hit or stuck
---
This sums up every killers first impressions and the two way path people come across either to be frustrated and obsessed with losing or learning to just accept a lose and going to hook another survivor I like it alot
---
A Kobe is when you are hooked, and successfully remove yourself from the hook after attempting to escape.
---
The reason why attempting to escape is frowned upon is because it lowers your hook timer, often causing people to go in to struggle state prematurely.
---
It's generally acceptable to attempt escape when everyone is hooked or slugged (in the dying state/on the ground), but usually not at other times. People who attempt escape are usually new to the game, or purposely trying to kill themselves on the hook.
---
there is a lot of complaining with hatchet hitboxes though
---
Unrelated to topic:
---
Khaled is such a priiiiiick
---
I've never really listened to him
---
Iron will is a great perk but it doesn't fit my personnel playstyle and it would only be useful to me against spirit but I dont want to run a perk to counter one killer
---
It wasn‚Äôt nearly as bad when the DLC came out.
---
*LAUGHS IN BILL MAIN*
---
Follow up to my other comment, there‚Äôs no general area to know etiquette. Generally you just learn over time but in general, place yourself in the other players shoes and think if it seems respectful.
---
T bagging with a fellow survivor is good etiquette bc it‚Äôs a silly acknowledgment 
---
Doing so at a killer after a pallet stun is considered poor etiquette since it‚Äôs making fun of the killer for making a mistake. 
---
On the flip side face camping is considered bad etiquette because it forces a player to essentially sit out of the rest of the game and have no chance of playing again.
---
Hell yeah
---
LOL, I know that zombie unity asset from the games Jim Sterling play. Please tell me you downloaded and played this
---
Gen jockey lol!
---
This is a BIG problem for me on PS4 so thank you for filling me in. It‚Äôs so annoying.
---
Body blocking is fine as long as you're not blocking someone in to get them killed or hold the game hostage. Blocking the killer from getting to the hook is an acceptable strategy.
---
I don't think people do it as a way to BM by any means, but 90% of the time I've run across the map and/or left a gen to get the save.
---
I don‚Äôt stereotype survivors. I just say, ‚ÄúHey, that guys being kinda mean. Oh well. Guess i‚Äôll keep playing the same as I usually do.‚Äù I get a lot of hate for playing Nea, even though I‚Äôm far from toxic, and only started her when I got the game cause I thought her perks were cool
---
Broken by Brunch
---
are you joking or being serious? you can never tell with identity v fans
---
nea players get big mad when they lose because they run all the current meta perks
---
Clown and Myers, I really never seen anyone complain about them both when they released. I joined around when clown released and didn't really see any hates towards him and for Micheal well he's just balances well nothing to complain about and he's fun and fair(mostly)
---
She prayed to her Gods to save her, but the entity intervened and took her which is why Adiris thinks it's HER God.
---
The contagious score event is from you infecting the survivor, not the Entity's tendrils. Her power is given to her by the Entity. She was infected with the Plague even before contact with the Entity yes, but I'm 100% sure she couldn't projectile vomit like that let alone walk with her posture she has in-game. Corruption was also a gift from the Entity and had nothing to do with her when she was still alive.
---
If her real God really existed, then they should easily be able to evacuate her and destroy the Entity. As much as I love the Plague, she is in no way capable of harming the Entity.
---
Saltiest are probably the original 4 and Nea. Least saltiest is Ace or Jane, but that‚Äôs because I run into them the least
---
What are you talking about? Identity V was heavily inspired by Dead by Daylight, with its own style and feel. Even some of the DBD devs helped work on it. It's not a rip off.
---
Definitley hide your red stain, you'll see other killers do this more often by walking backwards or looking in a wall during a loop as you grow as a survivor and  you can find videos of what i mean on youtube. Once you get better and you want to start getting better, i recommend watching otzdarva (i think thats his name) he is a great killer main who displays what he is thinking really well. His active channel name is "Not Otzdarva"
---
idk what you're talking about with quentin but yeah jeff players are sweeties
---
You'll probably have a low chance of surviving if she hits you once then. I see teams get taken out by her quick.
---
She does seem difficult to dodge. I always find her easy to mind game with those 2 perks. It's kinda funny when she goes around the whole area searching for me. She thinks I'm still there. I usually go behind her as she least expects it
---
Spine chill is a great perk, so is Iron Will.
---
I get what you mean, I wanted to main her recently and I‚Äôm nothing like the ‚Äútoxic Nea‚Äôs.‚Äù I just really like her cosmetics but I‚Äôm very loyal to my Meg lol
---
Frankly I love the asylum skin with the default head. Looks spiffy to me.
---
May I ask where the basement is going?
---
Ohh okay, thanks. I'm in like the mid 80s and I was wondering what happened after 99 lol
---
As a person who plays Jeff, Quen and Bill exclusively, I feel proud. &lt;3
---
Nah, too op, I wouldn't be able to sacrifice him
---
They're two entirely different characters, they'd have to call the survivor Stranger Things Survivor and let you choose between both characters. Looks to me like it's easier for everyone just to have two characters.
---
Yea and as a bill main I'm happy there isn't alot of toxic bills. I think the reason not alot of toxic people play them are kinda because they are either loud or because they are male (ain't judging just saying) and they don't have alot or no cosmetics at all.
---
Sniper doc?
---
I feel absolutely awful when I verse such ranks as a Hillbilly. The match is over in three-five minutes and I'm thinking like damn these guys are bad before I notice the ranks.
---
Hey fellow gay person, gay person here. Your opinion sucks and it‚Äôs 100% homophobic when straight people use ‚Äúgay‚Äù as a pejorative
---
Pretty sure they opted not to go for the scream liscense due to the people its tangled up with. Same reason theyve openly stated they will never be going for jeepers creepers.
---
But wallhacks is a term referring to a person's ability to see through the walls in a game, even outside of a hacking situation.
---
In season 3 a bunch of rats die under the Mind Flayer's control, I think that's the connection.
---
I didn't die on any hill, but nice try racist.
---
Easy just play braindead. Equip no perks run into pallets like a potato lose them etc, fastest way to derank without getting a ban and everyone gets bloodpoints

1. Point still stands, bud. You can still think I'm an ass. Though I fathom to see why you'd even bother typing out a response int he case of mistaken identity? I guess just to the sake of continuing the argument.
---
2. It's reactionary. He started off with inflammatory statements. If you can't follow the coming sequence of events I suppose we have more to worry about with you, eh?
---
3. Nice job of "winning an argument" by using the middle school level " 'Nice job winning an argument by [insert deflected comment here].'" technique.
---
Fair enough
---
I honestly thought this was a 3D model. Super great positioning, lighting. Everything looks great. The kind of thing that would be scary/unnerving to see at the end of a hotel corridor.
---
I'm curious on what it's tangled up with, child diddlers,harassers,killers, can't just say that and not have my curiosity peaked.
---
Yeah, and I laugh whenever someone tries to body block because they must forget I can still slash them. As soon as I injure one, they all run away and I am clear to hook.
---
I hate clown and most clowns I vs are douchebags. But I‚Äôm scared of clowns in general so maybe that‚Äôs related. Myers is bae.
---
That's the thing, though. You try another board game and your opponent wasn't the ONLY PERSON like that. Like 60% of people at board game night are like that!
---
When you leave the gen right as you get a skillcheck, **very rarely**, you might hear the sound without the gen blowing up. If that happens with a fully stacked Lullaby, you actually SEE the skillcheck appear and fade away.
---
People that sabotage hooks to 99% and then finish them while I'm walking to them with a survivor. People that try to body block me from the hook
---
Well, I do wish we had a DbD tribunal to compare. That'd probably be fun, too.
---
Is it just me or is nea always the one who goes for a super unsafe hook/tries to bodyblock a hook?
---
Legion
---
I wish Jason could be in this game he'd be better off than he is in his own game
---
this makes me proud to be a pig main
---
correction
---
It was like this for a long time, then it got random out of nowhere and now it's back to normal
---
I'd be a bit ashamed over that. Outside of big streamers that most people know about it's a safe bet to assume anyone else you get matched with that is a ttv is garbage. No need to go out of your way for a ttv when they'll do the work for you.
---
This sounds like some scooby doo shenanigans
---
This brings a smile to my face
---
Imagine a shinning based map
---
Yeah, plenty of concepts do translate over. ID-V also has much stronger Hunters to contend with their much stronger Survivors. Though if they could get something like Wu Cheng or Dream Witch working in DbD, vs. some items like Gulliver's Travels or perks like Mind's Eye's blindness/sonar, it would add a lot of depth.
---
If hatch has spawned and you and one other person is still alive,with more than 1 gen left. Bruh just kill yourself on hook.
---
most of the time "tunnel" isn't a thing
---
you just randomly stumble upon that person, the unhooker hides (and you can hear the injured person), someone makes a poor unhook... there are many causes
---
Holy smokes. I love it
---
Best way? Let me see.... DONT.
---
The rank system is there for a reason (though it doesn't seem to work half the damn time.)
---
Whatever rank you are, you need to stay there. Don't be mean to low rank survivors.
---
Nudity isn't allowed there
---
True, but that doesn't suggest a great pip system.
---
And there isn't one. Being too good at someone like Trapper or Huntress actually gimps your chase emblem.
---
JFK as survivor confirmed.
---
That was a wild ride, but also this is true, this killer is hard to play, sometimes you want to play your favorite killer but you can't because this game said "no lmao play Nurse or Spirit" and also the red ranks sweat
---
HENDERSON!
---
I am a Claud/David main. I am a pillar of salt
---
First off, this comic is stellar.   
---
Secondly, I know this killer gets a lot of hate from most survivors, but he's the best designed killer in the game, imo. There are very few perks that can't be validly used on him with some combination, and he has the widest variety of playstyles compared to any other killer. Not to mention that his shock-power is effective loop denial that still requires skill and timing to pull off, unlike Nurse. He's what all killers should aspire to.
---
Ah, yes. The most infallable pillar of logic. "Shut up."
---
Damn, is that why most people are agreeing with the op in this thread?
---
What about Snoop Dog as Bones?
---
The only GF I need is Ghost Face &lt;3
---
And you probably will in DbD.
---
Feng is the go to character for weaboo/koreaboo white guys that have 'yellow fever'. Safe bet to assume they'll all be salty. It's a good thing I switched to playing Dwight. Nobody expects a salty Dwight üòò
---
Any tips to playing Wraith? I'm a survivor main (not very good, rank 15) and I want to start playing killer
---
Your more often look to the left and right horizontal edges of your screen rather than the bottom edge, so if anything you should put it in the fourth slot to notice it easier.
---
What's the second add-on ?
---
As someone that plays a lot of Medic/Doctor characters in games usually alongside some psychopathic tendencies and has a knack for late 20s style attire... I mean do I have to say more to know my first DLC?
---
Michael myers but with kate denson hair
---
Is Nurse still that hated? Yeahyeah, isa meme I get it. But even though Nurse is considered the best killer in the game I still think it's more fun to play against a Nurse than a Spirit.
---
Yo where my Small Game homies at???
---
2 extra hatchets
---
The only legitimate way to end up de-ranking IMO is to try to learn a new killer you're not so good with. You'll probably de-rank at first until you get better with them and then you'll settle somewhere based on you and your killer's abilities.
---
Deliberately de-ranking to stomp newer players very literally kills this game. People can and will report you if you're obviously de-ranking, because other people like this game and want to continue to have people to play it with.
---
To be fair, play this game enough and you'll start assuming unhooking another person is a worthless sacrifice. The Entity is nothing compared to the cynicism players develop.
---
I don't think Aces are that kind considering it's a 50/50 chance the Ace is a asshole or a kind player
---
Sorry I‚Äôm new to the game. What‚Äôs that mean?
---
Most? So 2 out of the three?
---
Iron Maiden looks like a hot dog with mustard
---
Did you only play against like 3 clowns ?
---
Isn‚Äôt that the same about every character?
---
I'm referencing the fact that there are very few clown mains.
---
Gameplay is more important than story in actual practice, though.
---
Especially when the story features such chestnuts as "Wraith decided to murder people because he was upset that he'd murdered people also he got a magic bell somewhere" and "Huntress is apparently developmentally disabled, incapable of registering that other humans are the same species as her and her mother."
---
Although "The Entity picks on all the Licensed Killers" is also a hard pill to swallow.
---
Lmao, thank you for the imagery
---
No, but you can make being a churl have consequences.
---
High stimulus electrode and interview tape addons‚Äîthe tape turns the shock treatment cone into a thin beam that is 20 meters long and with the electrode (adds 75% range) it is ridiculously long shock range. Hilarious to watch though.
---
Eh kinda but Ace is always a 50/50 not like Adams,Dwight's etc.
---
But does she have NOED?
---
Doctor's one of my favorites, purely because of how imposing he feels. He really has the sense of a malicious warden, and the attitude to match.
---

I play nurse with hunted and no other hex, and  people go the totems like it‚Äôs free candy, so funny
---

---
I was talking about people who play Clown in general, you don‚Äôt have to be a Clown Main to be a Douchebag.
---
Identity V has this as an absolute stompfest for the Killers, but that's because they make the mode nerf "gen" speed by 50%, so it's basically 2v4.
---
It's a smart idea to 99% someone and let them go if you happen to find a group. That way you can just down your target and pop the 99%er soon enough if they dont body block or take a hit to be bait. And if they do get hit to clear stalk buildup, same thing. They're still a one hit down.
---
Ghost isnt all that strong, but he likely has the most possible strategies, synergies, or uses in Killer powers out of anyone else.
---
People who farm their teammates or sell their teammates out . 
---
Also teabaggers and OoO toxic dumbasses
---
The guy who stacks the shelves is a DBD fan.
---
Ever think that the killer wants to have fun too? lol
---
Where's Bubba though?
---
I don‚Äôt hate her per say, but when you get matched with someone who actually *knows* how to play her, it‚Äôs brutal. Especially for the lower ranks.
---
2019 and people are still recording their screens? Damn.
---
Do you remember that bit in MGS4 when Snake CQC-ed the ever loving shit out of like 4 swole French soldiers armed with assault rifles and submachine guns and shit?  I‚Äôm not super confident about the Legion‚Äôs odds even if they all jumped him at once.
---
Johnny Sasaki as a survivor.
---
Seriously, these are some absolutely awesome ideas. It's so sad that devs and designers limit themselves like this when their game is evolving. Like how the swamp isn't completely flat. Although those maps may not be the best it changes up the flow of the gameplay, and I wish they weren't afraid to make something completely new with changes to the tiles and pallets and windows
---
grow up
---
No
---
What's a good reaction gif for "when a baby dwight fails every skill check then leads the killer to the hatch and disconnects on top of it"?
---
Fuck them and carry on. :)
---
1. Your power is useless in the chase, even with add-ons like Swift Hunt. Perk-wise, you want to use perks that help end chases quicker (Brutal Strength and Save the best for Last usually work well for me, Brutal Strength is a Trapper teachable and Save the best for Last is a Myers teachable)
---
2. Learn what you can and cannot bodyblock, and always go for a bodyblock. Wraith is the only killer in the game that can trap a survivor with ease, so make good use of that. For gens, if they are in a position with a gen on one side and a wall on another, you can trap them in the corner of the gen and wall, guaranteeing a free hit. Another thing I only discovered recently, is that if you position your self correctly, you can bodyblock a survivor working on the long side of a gen no matter what, as long as you are completely pushed against them and directly in the middle. At higher ranks you wont get these often, but it's a good habit to get into regardless.
---
3. If you found a survivor and are still cloaked, you can block certain pathways that a survivor might want to run towards while uncloaking. So if in one direction there is a really strong loop, you'll want to position yourself to cut off that area so the survivor has to either run somewhere else, or risk getting hit. This is the strongest thing you can do as a Wraith.
---
Wraith is the simplest killer besides Leatherface. To be a good Wraith player you need to be good at Dead by Daylight in general. There's very little specific to him you have to learn, so most of your time will be learning the general things you can do as any killer. For add-ons, see the list above.
---
Honestly, it won't feel like a grind. That you will have somethimg to work towards, even after 1000 hours, is what gives this game so much depth.
---
What about Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson? (Movie to the left of Texas Chainsaw Massacre)
---
I like the sound the survivors make when they disconnect.
---
[Yikes](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/738/025/db0.jpg)
---
ayeeeeee baron!
---
As a survivor, I don't like him, but that could be due to me being a stealth player.
---
As a killer, I main the trapper, but also like to play Billy, and I don't enjoy playing the doctor cause it seems to be the same all the time. Shock around --&gt; chase screaming survivors who fail to utilize windows and pallets --&gt; hook them and hear anyone in the vicinity scream --&gt; repeat.
---
I‚Äôm a doctor main(Though this season it‚Äôs mainly just playing spirit) and I love him. Everything about him. He‚Äôs good at cutting certain loops and windows off with good timing, he‚Äôs annoying, slows down the game a bit, has tracking built in, has great addons, couples really well with Brutal strength/Enduring/MYC/Sloppy butcher. I just wish his power did a bit more without addons and they gave him more addons. Fake pallets aren‚Äôt super useful and his shock therapy and madness don‚Äôt really cause much issue until Tier 3. He should also get a slight rework like Trapper and Hag IMO.
---
Take my god damm money
---
Yikes x2... Best comment ever, was waiting for someone to mention
---
You walk through pallets with Brutal Strength?
---
Try Brutal Strength, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Fire Up for the ultimate unstoppable killer experience.
---
And no I never give a fuck about pallets. I swing through them every time even if I'm not running "Pallet Perks".
---
I used him almost exclusively for 2 years on console. I‚Äôve got so many goddamn disconnects and hate messages from people who loaded in and just screamed and was like ‚ÄúNope not today‚Äù
---
Maybe the wwe gif where the white guy puts his hands on his head and his eyes are use Oppenheimer in dissapointment and shock
---
**You can't sit with us.**
---
Either dc or sit in the basement as wraith
---
Idk man, JFK is not very good at surviving...
---
Most people don‚Äôt no not usually. Same can be said true about killers not thinking about survivors fun but as far as ruin goes it‚Äôs the only thing that stops an ‚ÄúEz gen rush‚Äù if you‚Äôre against 4 coordinated good survivors and you‚Äôre not using a godly killer or in a specific situation IE trapper basement snowball.
---
You should almost never respect pallets
---
Killers also like baby Dwights.
---
so was he also entitled to hit that 4% chance to unhook himself?
---
It‚Äôs a mistake to underestimate the no mither player though and waste all 5 gens to secure the kill. I‚Äôm not the ‚Äúeasiest‚Äù target anymore and the killer would probably see that if they weren‚Äôt in my butt.
---
Adept ghost face is the only reason I can see using that.
---
It's in beta and only certain countries have it, if your on iOS just change you region to Switzerland, if your on android install taptap and you can get it from there
---
Sometimes this works out very well. 40s into a game 2 people grabbed and hooked. Within a minute and a half all three were dead. I was so confused, killer said they tried too hard to get ruin.
---
The QoL change we needed

I don't put BP into survivors so I run chest searching builds to get survivor items. So,

---
Amazing comic by the way, I love it
---
I imediatelly go *here we fucking go again* and then i procceed to kill them asap because thats not the kind of matches i want.
---
I like his design and ability it's just underwhelming. Wish he could make fake generators,exit gates,windows instead of just being Freddy but weaker because the only thing he can do is make skill checks move which does nothing basically and fake pallets that are already dropped making it like Freddy's just more obvious it's fake.
---
Also you level up faster on low levels again
---
I started off as a nurse main... I realized that I was not allowed to do that, so I started playing doc and Freddy instead.
---
Hey it goes well with french fries.
---
At the same time i know that i'm the only one working through Ruin, while others are trying to find the Ruin totem. I \*really\* didn't want to be found considering that.
---
You‚Äôre a professional cunt, congrats
---
I never saw any attention for the clown, so I decided to main him and now I just want to give him a big ol bear hug.
---
Can even gets its own name right look at the description of the game
---
it happens very often on window vaults when survivor is injured
---
Killer want to have fun
---
gen rush: NO
---
Cause people have some empathy dude? How would you enjoy being camped?
---
Jeeeez... You meant: based on a sad* true story
---
Oh don‚Äôt get me wrong I know *why* they‚Äôre doing it but when I see a no mither player I don‚Äôt treat them any differently than any other player because it‚Äôs not worth focusing on the guy who‚Äôs gonna be practically useless by end game anyways because he‚Äôs one shot and can‚Äôt save or do gens that are close by.
---
A sea lab map
---
What a.. random order
---
ikr how bad do you have to be to camp someone just trying to build a community.
---
Oh damn, I'll check it
---
How does hatch spawning work now that no matter the gens the last survivor can always use it? When does it spawn?
---
I really want to up vote but 69.... Nice.
---
This is so cute üíö
---
Are you gonna let this one be bought with bloodpoints?
---
*NO NO NO NO NO!*
---
So will I have to buy it with auric cells?
---
*YES YES YES YES YES!*
---
Will my dumb ass buy it instantly anyways?
---
It means you save up all the blood points you earn from playing to use when the new killer/ survivor release.
---
You don‚Äôt need a team chat to know that the killer is right behind you.
---
But what about my 900 struggle points?
---
What kind of edgy cringe post is this?
---
So 4 + 1 is 5 so you have to do all the gens to reveal the hatch if no one dies?
---
Thanks! I keep trying to position my Whispers/Spine Chill and missing
---
Self care, no mither, soliditary, and mettle of man.
---
Wind waker?
---
The hatch spawns when the number of generators repaired is equal to the remaining number of survivors + 1 or when there is only one survivor left
---
Insanely long as in checking generators from about 30-50 meters away, I had the exit gates spawn near each other, so I could basically just check the gates by shocking each side from time to time and standing between them
---
I've played a lot of killer matches and seen this exact situation occur plenty of times. Every single time they actually come unhook you, it ends with one of you dying because of it, usually the rescuer. 
---
The only way it would actually be a good idea to save you and continue a match with only 2 survivors is when you're on the last generator and the gens are actually spread out somewhat. On top of that you're relying on the killer being on the other side of the map, cause that's about the only way you'll actually sneak off and heal without him finding you.
---
üñ§üê∑ü§òüèª Let me just lie down and take my Mori.
---
Everything was said and done in the match it seemed and even though probably didn't do anything your teammates might have boiled his blood a tad to much so in honestly him losing the kill was bad but eh that's my single opinion
---
It ain't gay if you say no homo
---
Enjoy your reward!
---
...oh wait.
---
If that was true, it would mean that I would have quit every game I've ever played. Stupid logic for my not so stupid reason to quit.
---
Must just be my luck them. I'll keep trying it out and see if it gets any better.
---
If you haven't moved from the same spot in 2 minutes then you're camping. If you are constantly moving you're patrolling. This is the knowledge that killer mains have taught me.
---
Fellow doctor main here. He was the first killer I ever played... zap zap... fell inlove with him right away. Now he is my first P3 with all perks me and herman have so much fun doing all kinds of builds and shocking like crazy.
---
He may not be considered the best killer but he is the one that brings me the most enjoyment.
---
*laughs in doctor*
---
Unless the Killer gets massively outplayed, saving your last teammate while there are multiple generators pending is near suicide.
---
Not an argument
---
Yup
---
I mean low ranks are usually horrible plus rank reset just occurred making it worse but after awhile it gets way better so just stick through it and maybe play killer if it's that bad
---
survivore whocare trolling there team mates and leading me to them and  also if there playing to fast and I gotta play a little dirty then I gotta do what I gotta do
---
Love the look of him. Also i don‚Äôt know if anyone else heard this but I heard a streamer saying he was getting a rework but couldn‚Äôt reveal much. Anyone know anything about this?
---
Look at that gamer with anal beads spirit
---
Omega blink Bubba
---
This post only makes sense if there is 1 gen left. Otherwise, this post is just about making a risky escape so the OP can have a little chance at escaping (since he doesn't know where the hatch is)
---
Rank reset? That's a thing?
---
Lovely cosplay as always! Think you're gonna do the bloated pighead?
---
Thats just rude but as a killer I thank you for that
---
Killers: Surivors are so TOXIC REEE

This is a wholesome post and I enjoy it. Thanks for making my day better!
---
Some days you get a lot of those  frustrating games. I had one where a Meg lead the Killer right to me as I was trying to open the exit gate, despite the fact that I was running Wake Up so she damn well knew I was standing there and the door wasn‚Äôt open yet. Had another where a Claudette sandbagged me 30 seconds into the match and I was immediately hooked. I suicided on hook in that game, because fuck that noise. 
---
I‚Äôd recommend that if you‚Äôve had a game or two where your team is garbage and you‚Äôre starting to get frustrated, take a break and come back to it later.

If this was real, you'd be able to use the default ash skin and just equip this hand along with it. Pure genius.
---
First thing you gotta learn the lunge distance. If you miss because you lunged too early you're gonna lose a lot of time. Time is the most valuable thing for killers so you gotta get the most out of it. Normally traps are set on high grass in loops (a trap on the pallet may be too obvious, so when they try to loop because they see no trap on the pallet they get trapped) or to block a infinite (long loop with a fast vault window). As for when, you gotta place traps at the start of the game. Don't care about gens for this part of the game. Also, trap only a section of the map, like a half, and then go patrol gens. As you get a down, try to bring the survivor in the trapped area and force them to play there. A good strategy of trap positioning is to block escape routes. What I mean is to see if there are pallets around a generator and then go to the most obvious one. For example, if there's a gen in a corner of the map, and you patrol on one direction, they will run into the other direction. You gotta place a trap on a loop where you want them to go according to your patrol route. In few words, trap around pallets/windows near gens.
---
As for when to place traps during the game, it's game sense that tells you when. Normally, after a hook you can set more traps as one or two survivor will go for the save and potentially only one is working on gens. If you think they're rushing gens (improbable, unless swf who got on rank15 to play against new player) go for the patrol, especially when you have all the traps set.
---
Dude look behind you please.
---
Well I wouldn't think it would be underwhelming or unbalanced because 1, they could make it so he just has mini teleports he can place kinda like hag and snatch people into the upside down, causing pallet placements to be completely different also  windows to be infected causing survivors to slows down which in my opinion seems completely balanced. 2, make it so he can bounce between the realms(walls being non existent for some areas) and appearing giving a surprise attack(obviously cooldown ability). This is coming from someone with limited knowledge but a decent amount so take it with a grain of salt and if you want to discuss I'll be happy to.
---
Yes sadly. Everyone hates it and the devs plan a matchmaking rework this year which'll  make it better hopefully
---
I used to run ttv in my name when I streamed, and it actually did a pretty alright job of showing people post-game my stream. The difference between a lot of people is that they‚Äôre using it as a ‚Äúfree viewcount‚Äù advertisement spot instead of being there for people to talk about the game after an enjoyable/interesting one.
---
Not a fan of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget to check out my stream!‚Äù Copy/pastes in chat, but that‚Äôs just because of the cringe.

---
Huzzah finally someone with some taste!
---
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME DAMN IT!!
---
Windows being infected would be too similiar to Clown or plague, bouncing between realms is similiar to Freddy, but not too similiar since Freddy stays in the dream world and surprise attacks is literally what Hag does. Every idea we can come up with for the demogorgon is already used in some way. Also as i said it wouldn‚Äôt really fit the theme of the game.
---
I'm pretty sure it's a E3 type of thing in Germany I can't remember it but they're holding a stand there from my knowledge which is limited.
---
I trust this with my credit card info
---
So you ran noed?
---
How is that rude? It's rude of the other survivor for leaving him to die
---
Yea good point I mean they could give him the ability to grab and slash survivors giving them a status effect which would be interesting, also for switching between realms I meant like he can actually switch between them not being stuck in one also he would maybe be able to corrupt areas making walls disappear or even pallets?
---
did you know, the little snippet of music that plays when the shape tiers up is actually a subtle nod to a 1978 movie called "halloween" of which the main antagonist, "michael myers" bears striking resemblance to the shape from dbd?  
---
just thought that was a cool little easter egg!
---
Too bad the devs don't see great ideas like this!
---
Making walls disappear is literally what makes nurse so OP. Walls and pallets are the survivors only defense against the killer and making another killer that ignores those would make another case of Nurse. You could argue that Freddy makes fake pallets but those take time to setup and are invisible if ur awake, and he can only make broken pallets fake.
---
Overpowered
---
Interesting. I made a post suggesting this a while back as I couldn't understand why the order was random. Sure it's a minor thing, but the little things go a long way.
---
Well it really depends, if any of them is carrying a rare item and is not worth losing it, if the situation is risky for the hatch camping survivor, so is a tough decision do whatever you want to do
---
This was absolutely beautiful and gorgeous and norsk &lt;3 &lt;3  
---
Love the art style, love the story telling and I absolutely love the Doctor!
---
Three ? I hope so but three survivors? They probably won‚Äôt do that
---
Nightmare fuel
---
Muh oppression
---
True
---
This is funny but I still have fun as a Survivor even if there's a Hex: Ruin active. I'm often pretty good at doing hex skill checks and feel good when I can do a whole bunch of them in a row. It's an annoying hex but it's not devastating. The real problem that takes the fun away is when everyone and their aunt is trying to find the hex so there's zero progression on any generator. That's one way a match can end terribly for all Survivors. On the opposite side, Hex: Ruin is a good counter to SWF groups whose gen rushing combined with group stealth is god tier. It's either going to slow them down and/or cause at least one member of the group to go separate. That said, if you're me playing as the Killer the survivors almost always spawn with the ruin hex right up their arse so it's cleaned in 10 seconds of the match starting. I've even ran the perk where I'll know if they're cleansing it and can't get to them in time because while they spawned on top of it I spawned on the very opposite end of the map. I never seem to get that same luck as a Survivor because the Hex: Ruin is always in the most concealed place possible since no one ever finds it.
---
Well it was a general thing. If you look at this subreddit all you see is some edgy killers posting stuff about how mean survs are, how toxic they are, how deeply hurt they are by a T-Bag. You probably aren't the only guy who tunnels and facecamps somebody with TTV in their name. I have been tunneled and facecamped for less - it is the overall situation and double standard a lot of these people in this subreddit behave i was aiming at, sorry if it accidently happend on your post when u play mostly survivor.
---
Unfortunately these dickwads do exits, but sometimes the killer will take notice and kill them for ruining it for others. Seen it happens twice this week and one of these dickwads is a girl streamer by the name of snowbunny something.... how she expects to get followers for this behavior is beyond me. I guess cleavage helps.
---
Isn't letting me die on hook more rude?
---
lol this sub is a pro-killer circle jerk when the most toxic players I‚Äôve encountered on this game are killers.....
---
Leave them on the floor for 60 seconds if it presses you that hard
---
That explains a lot.
---
Yeah fair enough, I'm honestly just grasping at straws to give myself more hope that it will actually be two survivors this chapter.
---
I guess my point was that it is theoretically possible to have multiple different models for a character under just a single killer/survivor, but in Legion's case, it makes more sense obviously as they have the same name as you said. Guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens!
---
Next they are gonna tell me the Nightmare is Freddy Kruger
---
He needs the golden cloak cosmetic then it‚Äôs great
---
Not allowed?  If you really enjoy the Nurse then play her! Play who you want. Don't let others dictate what killers you play.
---
It's not guaranteed and I'd say chances of survival are lower than before now that the killer can close the hatch. Especially considering the added chance that gates spawn close to each other, even though this doesnt even matter when the killer has a gap closing ability or whispers equipped
---
Have you tried playing killer?
---
No one is that stupid my guy
---
Particularly difficult game and you want to knock out some survivors to ease the workload? It‚Äôs not always for a toxic reason lol.
---
Killer should have looped you around the other way so you had to drop the pallet on the other side. Rookie mistake
---
Pretty easy to be altruistic with all 4 survs alive at the end game. It seems Billy didn't do well in that match.
---
Idk what you guys are talking about, of course im being serious. I thought that because it was such an old movie people might not get the reference between the shape and Michael Myers.
---
Oh the pallet super stun. Some things kush can't help
---
Dr. Herman truly is the best
---
I don‚Äôt get it (I am new to game and sub)... i assume you mean ash moves a lot in the lobby,,,?
---
Do people message the killer when it happens? I think the killer is smart enough to realize what's going on. "He's in basement", "he's backwards from me", "he's in the bridge" I don't know.
---
9.2/10 best game ever bugs everywhere
---
Its not a reference, it‚Äôs actually Myers from the movies. They have a license
---
Just watch a bunch of videos of good survivors and try to emulate what they do. Watch for the killers light, try to learn pallet spawns and play your walls well
---
Would take xenomorph over demigorgon any day
---
Killer has more perks for bloodpoint farming
---
Go Wraith and bring Beast of Prey, Thrill of the Hunt,  and Distressing when you have all 3 and bring bloodpoint offerings. Try to level as many killers and survivors as possible for all of their teachables too.
---
If we do get the Demogorgon, which I hope we do, I'm totally on board if only to get Sigourney Weaver in the game.
---
Yesterday I played about 5 or 6 games in a row against the same guy, first he was playing spirit with mori, then switched to huntress with iri heads and mori. Either that guy had like the worst day of his life, or he's just a douche.
---
*Monitor and Abuse*
---
Kinky.

thanks
---
I need it in gif format. Plz OP.
---
Ripley is definitely one of my most wanted Survivors
---
Most of the time I just kill myself. I figure at least one of us makes it
---
Odd, you'd feel children would love to *play a game*.
---
All I see is snow??
---
Eh I don't think itd be that buggy considering it would basically be a mini nurse blink and nurses blinks aren't that buggy but a simple killer like Huntress still has bullshit hitboxes with those hatchets and clowns bottles always seems to have a mini bug making him get another patch.

I have to admit I am a fuckin huge fan of alien and have been wanting a xeno since I first got this game. However I find it hard to think of an ability that is faithful to the aliens universe, while also not being a copy of pig. üòì
---
rightio thanks man
---
if you wanna farm points the fastest you're gonna want Barbecue and Chilli
---
I mean physically removing walls is what would be buggy. Id bet 10 bucks that if something like that was implemented survivors would be able to go through the border walls with some kind of bug
---
Killer main here, and nah, fuck the killer if he was being a shithead. OP gets an updoot.
---
That's what I do
---
I always have been and always will be a bing bong boi
---
Doctor is so underrated killer. I've seen so many people putting him in "trash tier" or other very low tier with Clown (which is IMO really good killer), while putting Pig, LF, **LEGION**(!), Wraith, Trapper above him. Ridiculous. He's not top tier killer, but he's still pretty good if you learn to shock people in the right place and time. His add-ons also are really powerful, who doesn't like to have illusionary pallets everywhere? :P
---
I found evidence that The Nightmare is actually Freddy Krueger. It's big news we should all know about.
---
Right?? Like holy shit give us Jack Frost for Christ sake already, who tf want's 4 killer teenagers?? Nobody! Shoulda been Jack Frost because it was December!
---
Well you are not wrong but most of the time i ended up dying on my first hook and all my teammates crouching around doing absolutely nothing this wasn't the case with this team.
---
Definitely agree also since we would be able to get more monsterous killers if we get a demogorgon I'd like to see a windigo or some Indian type beast or hell even a cryptid like moth man.
---
There will still be at least one survivor hiding behind tree watching hooked person die, doing absolutely nothing xD
---
While they'd definitely have to be a stealth killer, I'm 100% sure they wouldnt be a pig clone
---
It's not a free win, they still need to find it, and the killer should be doing the same thing too. 
---
Them not pulling their weight is entirely subjective on your part. They could just as well done most of the generators on their team, maybe they had enough brain to recognize a unsafe hook, instead of mindlessly unhooking when the killer is baiting it. 
---
Should they just roll over and suicide to to make up for incompetent teammates when they have near no chance of finishing all generators + gate alone?
---
Who has the audacity to commit such an act
---
Oof
---
Oh do you know what time? I had heard that there was a chance they might be announcing the next chapter there.
---
I've always unironically wanted Sasquatch
---
The least I find to be Jeffs and Aces. Most salty has to be either Laurie or Ash.
---
Uh huh, and the Pig is from Saw, right? I haven't had my coffee yet
---
Had a dude rage message me yesterday for leaving him on hook.  
---
Our other two teammates were dead and there were 4 gens left.  I was the only person who had done a gen that game (there was ruin...I also cleansed the ruin).
---
I asked him what the hell he would've accomplished if i got him off.. he had no reply to that particular question, but somehow everything was my fault.
---
Please let me play a Steve Harrington in his scoops ahoy outfit. You don't want to know what I'm willing to pay for that.
---
Eh it's just be a big ol hairy human which isn't that special unlike mothman which I find absolutely badass or hell the weird bird creature that showed up during the Chernobyl disaster
---
bruh mementos
---
You'd have to walk pretty far to find a killer that primarily uses their own teachables *well*. They're definitely the minority.
---
A fresh clean Pig is far more reliant on the likes of Whispers and Make Your Choice - the instadown means one hook quickly turns into two hooks, and that forces the remaining survivors to make hard choices about staying with the gens or coming in for the save.
---
You can put Sloppy Butcher on top of that so that even if you lose/ignore the unhooked survivor, they're still in a risky position between their party hat and being Mangled.
---
&gt; has no map presence
---
She needs to be played aggressively, sure, but that's a common "issue" for several killers. The party hats mitigate the presence issue somewhat, since it enables a "catch and release" approach - when the timer is active it buys Pig time to pressure the other survivors a bit.
---
&gt; sucks in the chase
---
I'm not so sure about that - Ambush has the potential for strong mind games on most maps, and if you have two people on the hook then time is on Pig's side. At any rate, it's perhaps the flip side of having an easier time with gen grabs - Whispers gives an easy notification of whether or not someone is on the gen you're crouching up to.
---
I don't disagree that she's not one of the strongest killers, but I do feel she's definitely underrated by many.
---
Not my problem fam
---
Wow, so nice to ruin someone,s  fun time, just dont play killer if you such touchy person
---
E N T I T Y   D I S P L E A S E D
---
Your flair is ~~cursed~~ perfect.
---
You just lose your offering
---
Try playing killer. It makes you realise how predictable some survivors can be and also how killers act. This helps a lot of people improve.
---
Welll... lets see
---
Crawls
---
-pig/ghostface 
---
Ambushes 
---
-piggy 
---
Places facehugger on face 
---
-basically rvb on piggy 
---
Timer which leads to death 
---
-see above 
---
Spits acid
---
-spirit 
---
Charges at survivors 
---
-Billy 
---
Things they could work with for original ish ideas 
---
Hive spots
---
-zenomorph chooses spots to plant a growing area of the hive that could give it bonuses or whatever 
---
Tail stab 
---
-Slightly longer range insta down or deep wound effects
---
Wall Climb
---
-zenomorph could latch onto ceiling or wall and wait for an ambush pounce 
---
Mori
---
Obviously headbite.
---
If anything the Zenomorph should introduce multiple different abilities in a single killer. Like how the survivors can bring in different items, the zeno should be the first to actually be able to pick 2 of multiple abilities at a time in order to change up the game kinda like freddy with snares or pallets.
---
Some survivors do that so you only chase them once and hook them and then leave for other survivors. Not tunnel them so they might get angry sometimes.
---
Perfect replacement for Creeper from Jeepers Creepers tbh since they said that he wasn't going to be a thing
---
His walking animation when uncloaked is fucking hysterical I love it
---
if the killer leaves, you'll get bloodpoints for the match
---
you won't if they pull a plug tho
---
How are you supposed to message the killer?
---
Even on console the killer has to message you first.
---
Wow this comic is just well fantastic I love it and the doctor is a lot of fun also he's really good for getting blood points ^^ just good job on the comic love it gl hf everyone ^^
---
The hatch could't have spawned yet.
---
What does pull the plug mean?
---
Oh gos, he's in higher resolution
---
Yea, the one that got a 5.9 out of 10? Alien wouldn‚Äôt fit into the game. Neither does that gorgon thing.
---
What have I just witnessed
---
Im just trying to fill people in on this cool fact, stop  being such a killjoy and let people learn more about the shape please.
---
oof...  Recently had a game; three survivors alive, me on first hook, TWO gens to go. I see two Blendettes crouching in the corn, both pointing at me and butt-dancing. One of them  had a key. The killer was not camping, not even near the hook.  I sure as fuck took my time to die. The killer got them :) Cue salt in chat for not being a decent teammate... LOL
---
unplug their internet connection or pc. if they do this this way, the game can't give you your points as killer's client is the one hosting the game and keeping track of those things
---
Just don't stay too close to the pallet, keep moving, don't vault and you're okay, if she's faking, she's just wasting time, if she's phase walking, she'll assume you're close to the loop/pallet and miss a swing or just don't swing and you'll have the time to run to the pallet and vaul or loop her.
---
You should really be worried when it pops on 3.
---
Removed - Offtopic/Excessive self-promotion
---
Last warning.
---
Second best, Hopper is the best.
---
I did really enjoy nurse, until everyone flamed you every fucking game. I would way rather win as Freddy, and just have them be salty, and call you a tunneler for no fucking reason.
---
Very creative and thoughtful response Im sure it took you so long to type 2 letters
---
If you hit all survivors while running The Third Seal, would it counter kindred?
---
No, because it hadn't spawned, but I was in a situation where I knew for a fact I had been the only person doing objectives that game.  
---
Other than just trying to unhook him for points, I felt that the most logical thing to do was leave him on and try to save myself.
---
Wait slashing on hook is BM ?! Damn I used to do it to stop the scream from when you hook a survivor I didn't know it was considered toxic
---
I'd replace MoM with Solidarity to heal yourself more
---
How do you want to win without OoO tho?
---
&gt;also what the fuck was this comment
---
Pretty much what I thought when reading yours.
---
Look Who‚Äôs shitting in the tall grass.
---
Someone‚Äôs got a case of the Mondays. It‚Äôs ok Mr. White knight, your day will get better. As for his idea, it was trash. I figured a simple no would get the point across. Sorry that I didn‚Äôt assume I was going to have to write a thesis on why his idea was shit.
---
Thanks man, definitely will look into him
---
Maybe you can say some more so i could change my ideas?
---
Yummy
---
Good nurse = we get slugged in like 2 minhtes
---
Theres also several scenes in MGS3 where he takes on 5+ at a time. Not even to mention the Cobra Unit, which he basically single handily wipes out.
---
10/10 my money is on Snake.
---
Yeh I play killer, it's just I can't juke and I'm not strategic with my plays.
---
But when killer uses NOED, BBQ, Blood Warden and thanks you you he gets 4K, not 1K, Rancor you call him crutch perker, when killer tunnels and camps you call him snowflake with big ego, but you can't see a problem with using all the second-chance survivor crutch perks...
---
I can mindgame and I abuse BBQ, Ruin, NOED, Blood Warden in last 30 seconds of EGC, Enduring + Spirit Fury I play Spirit and Nurse. If someone loops me for to long, they already 'lost', cause I'm going to use Blood Warden in last 30 seconds or just camp and tunnel them, so in the end I already won. Get you very few BPs, black pip or depip mister tbagger!
---
My heart is beating cuz he wasn‚Äôt looking behind when running at gate, ugh, ggs
---
He Sometimes says Shit Like this
---
Maybe oh Idk get rid of a ranked based matchmaking system entirely? 
---
Rank is literally the most bs thing all it does is make you wait longer for matches. 
---
Plus whenever reset happens I always get paired up with rank 20s and I'm at a low purple rank skill levek, how is that fun for them? It's definitely not fun for me. Who ever thought a ranking system in an asymmetrical horror game would be a good idea??..
---
I say if it come down to it get rid of ranked matchmaking by having different gamemodes ranked and casual 
---
Easy 
---
Simple more accessible to a bigger demographic
---
Nah, clicking isn't as bad as tbagging, cause they waste flashlight and give out their position to you :P
---
That‚Äôs ‚Äòher man‚Äô
---
You can't do instant grabs consistently, sometimes he swings even in treatment ;)
---
Just turn off chat/DMs and enjoy the character you like. People will complain about something regardless of what you do. May as well so something you enjoy instead of catering to the toxic people.
---
They're not.  
---
None of them are doing a gen and you're starting to go to struggle phase.  I see this shit happen way too much.
---
I don't think I played on Thompson House
---
They don;t work all the time, sometimes he swings instead of grabbing, even in treatment
---
Ok thanks
---
[You can thank me later](https://youtu.be/Ermq43thCfg) 
---
Enjoy!
---
Beanos
---
This is either going to be the biggest oh hell yea moment for the game with stranger things
---
Or the biggest wtf is this garbage moment because shitty teases by Netflix.
---
Seeing how it's Netflix handling the teases? 
---
It may be the former
---
I constantly play different killers, but no matter what, I always come back to Doc. Rank be damned, Doc always will be number one for me. 
---
Plus his cosmetics are always on fucking point.
---
He sucks at higher ranks. Ez loops, his ability is super hard to use and it doesn't even work too well. Imo one of the worst killers currently and I really want him to be buffed cuz as you said he looks so scary and his overall deisgn is great.
---
Yeah.  It's really misleading for new players.
---
Damn! Snake would need to be a killer. Who would believe the Legend not QcQing the killer!
---
We see this as an absolute win brother
---
Be ready for salty killers to call you ''cry baby'' because they think their cheap ass spirit is skillbased and balanced
---
"But but, mUh mInD gAmEs"
---
This is going to be a interesting very very interesting. I really hope it's stranger things and the killer is the demogorgon but who knows although it's likely we get a stranger things chapter they could pull a surprise
---
That would be an interesting addition to the game
---
I may not main killer anymore but if this does happen can't wait to prestige my wraith fully and maybe level my other characters for their teachable
---
she fucking blind
---
Same
---
Is that what that is?! I was confused on what the little green 1 was. I kept seeing posts about rank reset so I thought it was related to that!
---
Sprint burst/Dstrike/selfcare. 4th i usually rotate through Iron will, or Kindred.
---
Iron Will to counter spirits, and in general helps jukes.
---
Kindred if i've been having rough solo games.
---
I do it with Feng sometimes, her scream is so high pitched it honestly hurts my ears ;w;
---
Dude trust me I got a genius plan.
---
Freddy with snares against little baby Stranger Things babies 
---
No kill like overkill! 
---
Maybe traumatize them with pallets since they are going to be new
---
Nothing stops you from downing them, just leave them on the floor afterwards.
---
As much as the spoiler would be more thematically appropriate, I think they'd shoot themselves in the foot with it not being a Demogorgon.
---
I've never seen the show and I still know what the Demogorgon is, and it's got a pretty easily recognizable design. When you think Stranger Things, you think Demogorgon.
---
Also, the game already forces Michael Myers and Freddy Krueger to be balanced, that's really not an excuse to not balance out the Demogorgon.
---
If you do that then you will forever be with rank 20 survivors and red rank killers it will ruin the game more than fix anything .
---
The reason for ranks so so new rank 20 players won't face red ranks and have a chance to play and learn not just watch 5 gens pop without seeking anyone or to be hooked within seconds and die with having done nothing
---
Should be harder for the killer unless they just have zero cooperation
---
Xbox does have a stat page. Shows escapes, total earned bloodpoints, kills, and like 2 other things.
---
honestly i think the aura of the killer should be revealed passively. but for survivors to see each other you would need to run kindred.

---
99% games are campers there
---
That's too mean I'd prefer to go easy on them so they dont instantly quit as queue times suck so alot of new players is good but mean atleast teach them sooner then later about how to play right?
---
I honestly hope it's not stranger things just so we can be surprised (and also because it would be entertaining to watch this sub have a heart attack)
---
Did he have hunter lullaby? Maybe the entity hid it from you?
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes
---
You're a pussy
---
Wish I could do that but I often don't know where the hatch is. Even when I do, I'm too bad at juking through the whole map. I blame it on both FPS and also my skills. Nevertheless, I save people when there's a chance we can all escape!
---
Thats why it's optional to play in a casual setting my guy  
---
And it wouldn't be constant rank 20s that the point of casual matchmaking 
---
You would get a Mix of everything like the wild west 
---
And you would still have your ranked mode if you care about it so much 
---
We need a bigger incentive to actually get to low ranks instead of just recieving longer que times
---
Yeah i mean if they make it work and not be underwhelming, then im all for it.
---
Love when people who play survivors say this. Because running around debris on Autohaven is very skillful, right?
---
When one head is not enough.
---
If Demogorgan, and thats a biiig if, happens I am pretty sure Xenomorph and Velociraptor would be next to join.
---
Yea I'm kinda hoping for the opposite and it's just a surprise but it'd attract alot of people to the game giving us new players and the demogorgon looks cool but either way gimme new characters BHVR
---
I had about 400h for all achievements :)
---
*Mad World intensifies*
---
NICE!
---
You gotta come up with your own word or it won't work
---
I think the loops aren't mind games anymore because killers just take the stun with spirit and enduring or brutal. I think we can agree that if the killers chasing you, you're not getting to lose them in a locker anymore. So you basically got to loop pallets/windows. Considering killers can miss 8 swings or just wait for entity to block window, survivors need to loop.
---
God I love a little psychosis in the morning...
---
The baby bump
---
I though the claudette was gonna get grabbed too lmao
---
Yes, it is your own risk, and that is why you sometimes have to be especially careful not to lose said item.
---
Yep I've only ever had it happen once to me and I only use it to check their hours in game if it's feeling a little shady, I have never messaged a killer through steam in a match, besides if the person has their account on private people can't message them without being friends anyway
---
I think they have a stall, not sure whether they will be speaking at a set time
---
Wait there‚Äôs a trailer?? Where can I find this
---
Damn straight it is! Follow me into the cult of crouching! We were right all along at rank 20! 360 is a thing of the past! No one escapes death, but maybe after 20 minutes of not finding anyone, the killer will leave and that's a win for me! Dev's bless you! Hope that wasn't too long to read either.
---
If the killer is camping, there's no fault in saving yourself since trying to save them will end in one of you (or both) dying anyway
---
Whether you go for them when they're not being camped depends - I personally try to go for them cause it feels wrong to sacrifice others for my own sake. Sometimes a killer is so surprised I didn't leave them to die that they let us both escape. A bit sad that not being selfish is so rare it's worth rewarding, but it's a nice bonus.
---
Jake confirmed killer. ^(flair)
---
Hol up
---
for me it depends, i sometimes just wait it out for struggle points or sometimes i just kill myself so they could escape.
---
Did he hear you or see the scratch marks?
---
Seems like he turns around on the other side of the wall.
---
The absolute madlad. I see this as an absolute win
---
I‚Äôve been trying to get them as a bit of a challenge while playing the game, I have 84 achievements in 189 hours. I find the adept survivors to be the easiest ones. 
---
You‚Äôre doing good mate, keep it up!
---
No endgame countdown starts when an exit gate is opened, or the hatch is closed.  Not when the last gen is done.
---
survivors in the head on animation should not be able to take damage
---
I run iri heads every chance I get. NOTHING feels better than one-shotting a surv as they're t-bagging after looping you once
---
Yeah. Also, I just realised that what I wrote would not work with killers like me. Like, I cannot really determine which survivor was really active and which one was not, as a killer, therefore I would definitely give the hatch to the player who got tipped off and facecamp the shit out of the guy who was trying to reveal the hatch to me. You know, for potentially being a dick.
---
That sucks, dude. I honestly hate it when that happens.
---
Yeah these are apparently their cannon faces that the team over at bEhaviour uses for molding and creating cosmetics. And yeah Susie looks like she is way too into it ahahahahaha :)
---
Playing against Hag ends up making me want to be able to scream at my teammates.  It's like nobody knows about crouching.
---
I only really do that when I'm a killer and either caught a particularly good looper (one slash on hook) or if I luck shotted someone at the start of the game (little dance). I always leave immediately after and only do it once.
---
Tbf I also don't get mad if a survivor teabags once either. It's repetition that makes it BM imo.
---
and Ghostface is... Ghostface!
---
by just playing the game normally and not trolling for some survivor achievements (taking hits at the hook) i would manage them at 700 to 800 hours, i estimate this because i still havent purchased all dlc-s
---
It was like this with nurse, survivors just got used to her or got damn good at 360,mindgame, etc. I just see her as forcing me to play immersive. So I will be immersed and bore everyone to literal death...
---
Was is Stab movie, Scary Movie, or Scream? I hear so many rumors
---
I see nothing because I'm in tall grass...
---
400-500 for me. Had all except for "Taking One for the Team" pretty fast, but that one took fucking forever.
---
Because you are never on a gen to see the speed buff
---
Yes I have, thanks for asking. 
---
Why is not getting a 4K such strong justification for you? The game isn't balanced by nor is it the average to get 4K. Sounds a bit entitled here don't you think? And how's a survivor pulling the plug a valid reason on top of that, it's a whole other issue entirely. I'm not the one to talk shit on people, but really, if it takes you over 20 seconds to go from gate to gate, that's kinda on you.
---
[Real dame da ne hours](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RIFb1aOuMTE)
---
Man, these red perks look gorgeous
---
At what time will the stream from the gamescon start ? I live in the center of the europe
---
This^
---
That wasnt blind though
---
And otzavarda second channel. He plays killer but will explain what to do in order to counter what he is doing. And if you want to get a laugh you can look at his survivor videos
---
I know, I'm sorry. It was selfish of me. If you need me, I'm here now. I'll be on that gen that definitely 3 gens us. Or in the corner.
---
I want it to be Nancy or Barbara. We have so many male survivors and not enough female ones. 
---
Nancy because we never got Nancy from Elm Street, and Barbara because she died and she actually makes the most sense to be playing the Entity‚Äôs Reindeer games.
---
Tonight it‚Äôs opening night. That‚Äôs probably where the confusion comes from
---
Cool! Thanks, I knew I was missing something. I'll watch you with empathy.
---
Entitled? 
---
So let me get this straight, a asymetrical survival horror game, keyword horror, is balanced towards killers only getting 2 or 3 kills? So while about half the players on the survivor side get to enjoy their "hard earned" win, a killer just has to live with the fact that they will almost never get to enjoy a proper win, aka a 4k? I'm sorry, but Fuck right off. That's some horseshit. If you do great as killer, punish bad plays and steamroll a survivor team and they still need 5 or 4 gens, then nobody has the fucking right to survive. Friday the 13th has some flaws of it's own, but at least in that game a counselor doesn't get to escape Jason easy if they are the last one alive. Either they have to complete objectives, or wait out a full 20 min timer.
---
It's like Michael, but with much better tracking. Bear in mind, this is just the base power. With add-ons, you could add status effects and increase the duration on Predator, for example.
---
They just need to change it so that the hatch opens as soon as the entity stabs the survivor. It should be as near instant as if they DCd.
---
Ah Rubiks Cube Eboni Mori Anyone?
---
slow the game down just a little bit
---
Claudettes for sure
---
Blind but also perfect timing, looking at the red stain she was looking in the wrong direction each time.
---
I usually do it for the off chance that it's actually Devour Hope but if I'm playing with friends I'd ask them first
---
Man those ideas would hurt the game so bad
---
Probably trying to avoid seeing all the teabags he earned himself
---
Normally I understand doing it when survivors are just bullying, but imagine being a jackass and then being unable to handle the mocking you deserve
---
What you can do is hit someone in Normal Stance, giving you one stack for Predator. Switching to Predator can be instant and so you can hit them when within striking range.
---
You sound kinda salty that you can't easily stomp the Spirit or use the same tactics on her that you do for the other killers....good. I'm glad there's a killer that breaks the meta and survivors can't easily beat and the fact that people seem to want her nerfed boggles my mind.
---
Yea but it still feels more so waste of a time when you can just play Micheal and it really only relates to one small thing  of the demogorgon while it can have other abilities like portals realm hopping etc. Just giving some criticism is all
---
The lack of a red stain is a big part of it. Just like Ghostface.
---
891?
---
Yeah, I was just throwing out ideas. Steve and Nancy would still be great. That way, you‚Äôd also have younger folk than another middle aged dude. For cosmetics though, they could have a hat/no hat option and a vine-covered suit. They could also have the shirt he wore in season 3, or the medical suit from the hospital in 2.
---
Then people are just going to slug to stop the last person from escaping cause hatch camping survivors are real.
---
Why would DS (the ‚Äúanti-tunneling‚Äù perk) activate when you unhook yourself?  Especially at the end of the game.  It‚Äôs so dumb.  You just have to slug for a minute and sit there because of a dumb survivor perk?  It‚Äôs silly
---
Opening presentation is at 7pm BST (in 6-and-a-half hours).
---
They do that anyways, though. Like, almost every game I have as survivor this happens.
---
I'm guessing you travel through the upside-down, but can't attack people, and are invisible to Survivors? Sounds like a discount Wraith, tbh.
---
Doesn‚Äôt apply here.  The exit gate is right there, and in another scenario the hatch could be nearby.
---
I only do this if the other survivor was being a dick during the match or if they were hiding/camping the hatch when we were the only two survivors left. Otherwise this is a toxic thing to do.
---
Exactly.. the cycle continues forever as all perfect symphonys of chaos go....
---
Forevermore...
---
Yea tends to happen alot as a clown main especially when you don't run ruin because you want to not run meta perks
---
Do you have hag?
---
And why shouldn't the game be balanced around all survivors dying? Right now, survivor is still the easiest side to play, even after 3 years. The only way you're getting a 4k as killer is if you bring your best meta build, and then still you have to tryhard as fuck because a survivor meta build (which they probably be bringing 4 of) counters almost anything because it's just that OP. A horror  game should be scary. Not so laid back that survivors go out of their way to troll, teabag and bully a killer.
---
I swear this little tree in the corner sees survivors run past them every 100 years
---
Spirit is the best dlc killer in the terms of power and her perks are fairly solid (especially spirit fury for your anti-pallet needs).
---
As others have mentioned, pop goes the weasel has been pretty meta lately so if you're not after a killer to play or you want the perk, clown is a good choice. Bamboozle is also good.
---
Plague is the one that I have nothing to really comment on as I don't own her or any of her perks.
---
Come on, oinkers!
---
Forevermore...I can't top that! You're toxic for using that word! (Fmbell has disconnected)
---
Well I get that, I should‚Äôve asked a full question instead of replying a single word. I was thinking, why is that sad? Who in their right mind, killer or survivor, would think grabbing off a heal would be a good idea lmao.
---
Where does he get all that data from?
---
uhhhhh hag comes free
---
I hear all these tales of face camping bubba's but 9/10 Wraiths I face facecamp and tunnel real hardcore, I don't blame them 100% because it is Wraith but it's still a dick move
---
Bastard didn't even let me hook him...
---
I think it would be so interesting because of this one simple thing; penny wise feeds off fear, and in another one of Stephen kings novels dark tower, there is a creature that resembles penny wise, thought to be the same species of inter demensional beings that feed off of emotions and it feeds off of laughter. If it makes you laugh you will laugh till you die nourishing it. So the funny thing is the entity feeds off of ‚Äòhope‚Äô so I always thought it would be super cool if they somehow write in that the entity and pennywise are almost one in the same cannon wise if they add him in. And that he found a mutual parasitic relationship with the entity and unlike the other killers was brought into the realm on his own terms and could leave on his own terms as he pleases.
---
Should've wiggled though. Js
---
10/10, Better love story than Romeo And Juliet.
---
I get instant killer queues and have to wait 3 mins to get in a shitty ping lobby as survivor
---
Yesterday I knew the killer (Ms. Piggy)  had Franklin's so I dropped off the key at a specific place. The killer had a  particularly sucky playstyle (tunneling and getting hit by every single pallet) so I knew the key was my only chance. 
---
3 gens later it's just me and a slugged Ling Ling. I go back to retrieve the key and find the hatch. I wave her to crawl to me as I am close to the hatch. Pick up the little rascal and we both escape.
---
I always tend to call meta perks boring perks lol
---
Supposedly 2pm EST.
---
Yes, in those situations the perk is more useful to the survivor than it would normally.
---
Still doesn't mean that ds shouldn't work for a kobe. It activates after getting unhooked and it has synergy with deliverence.
---
On console yeah but if he is on pc it isn't
---
If your the last two people left I don‚Äôt understand the mentality that not letting the other survivor not get the hatch. At least someone lives and gets the points
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs why the person said they open the gate
---
Outplayed
---
I don‚Äôt get why she wasn‚Äôt wiggling but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs toxic at all.
---
Joke's on you I brought my last 3rd anniversary cake
---
The last perk would make me so damn salty when I played killer, I like the other 2 though, the 2nd one seems like a more fun version of WGLF, you could even run both for a meme farming build
---
The first one ppl would just dc and would be very unhealthy and would leave to mass cool downs because once dedicated servers come out dc gets put on a timeout. Second thing would cost the game a lot of money
---
Yup. You never really know who the dick is.
---
I need to finally get kindred on one of my survivors to use it when playing solo. So useful.
---
How?
---
That‚Äôs an odd reason. I would expect most of the killers we have to already be the centerpiece of  ‚Äúreal life phobias‚Äù considering we already have deranged serial killers, ghosts, nightmare entities etc.
---
Eleven:  survivor confirmed 
---
She just slings the killer into a corn field whenever they get too close to a gen.
---
Keep going I'm almost there
---
I just lost a baby Dwight and y‚Äôall are here worried about an emoji smh smh my head my head
---
I mean, those are already a lot more common than Pig so it‚Äôs probably not an unpopular opinion.
---
Parkour
---
Don't see why you'd treat him like other survivors. It's kinda silly to not focus hitting the no mither player cuz, well, you can bypass a huge portion of chase time  considering all you need is one strike. Not to mention that strike turns into other survivors being altruistic and then you snowball the game from there.
---
Hey its called going for head on plays.
---
Nice story i have pretty same but with Myers, but you must admit that Burger King Myers is hotter than doctor.
---
I think he is something like the 6th or 7th best killer, in between the Pig and Leatherface with Leatherface being the better one. He robs survivors of their abilities and he is probably the most anti swf killer in the game and generates the most salt. However, his power is less effective at Ranks 10 and above. But he is very good for points.
---
Yes, indeed, it would be a good blood points farming! Meanwhile, thanks to many constructive comments here, I am "fixing" the third perk, so to make it more balanced and not possible to be abused in worst scenarios, so to have a fun perk for survivors that doesn't penalize the killer in a wrong way and that adds some more dynamics to the game! :D
---
If the killer is camping you and nobody is going for you to unhook you then you're banking on kobe or deliverence to get off the hook. In that situation it'd make no sense for ds not to work for you.
---
Hmm still though I recommend putting more thought into and reading a bit more into the demogorgon as either way to put it the idea just doesn't work well in my eyes or make this idea into a new killer concept. Good luck though
---
This sub is definitely not pro killer lmao
---
Spirit.  Once you get the hang of her she's really fun to play. Jump scares for days.
---
And some good perks too, I guess. But I don't really care about that.
---
For now yes, when dedicated servers roll in? No
---
Interesting. I‚Äôll write this down.
---
Thanks
---
@OP you mean "What was that hit my duude"
---
Honour our lord and savior by using his teachings
---
Thank you
---
How is this toxic
---
Go eat Bratwurst vieze kuilengraver
---
Yeah for sure.
---
Last night I watched a killer get that sweet, sweet , satisfaction of hooking a bully survivor.
---
It was a 3 man SWF and myself against a ghostface. The 3 man SWF bullied the living shit out of him. I looped him a couple of times but I got the impression he was either bad at the game or new to DBD/Killer, so I just ditched him rather than string him along. They kept at him while I just gen rushed and farmed unhooks/heals.
---
They were tea bagging on pallet stuns, flashlight blinds at pallets, the usual. At one point two of them had flashlights and were just blinding the shit out of him over and over.
---
I did all 5 gens, and opened the exit door. Joke was on them though, because he had NOED.
---
He downed one with NOED, and proceeded to face camp the living shit out of him. The other two in the SWF tried to unhook him but one got downed. Ghostface didn‚Äôt even hook the downed guy, he just stayed on the hooked guy. The downed guy crawled away, I got the heals, and the two SWF guys left. I stood there for a minute or two until the timer hit the point that I couldn‚Äôt really sit around anymore. He was just standing there slashing the shit out of the guy on the hook.
---
When we got to lobby the killer DC‚Äôd before GGs, but I didn‚Äôt really blame him. They were toxic as hell, but the worst part is that somehow a rank 20 killer got paired against me (Rank 12) and the SWF (Ranks 14-9). Perfect match making!
---
I wouldn't say this is toxic. It really didn't seem like he was going to give it to you anyway. There is a bunch of toxic shit that happens in the egc. It's not just one sided either.
---
Hahahahaha funny story, just when the DLC had come out I was having a fat ass edible a friday night and playing some DBD by myself at like 9 at night so I was in the lobby and looking around my room stoned as fuck when I heard that soft   
---
*"Groovy..."*  
---
 in my headset. I was mortified and frantically browsing my computer windows to find out if I had a youtube video playing or some shit. Was so confused for like a week ahahahahaha
---
I have a feeling you're a little angry cause someone bloodlusted you
---
There wasnt proof of him, that was people getting ahead of themselves.
---
How can a killer BM you in any way during the game?
---
Imagine thinking that hitting the person on hook, flashlighting while breaking pallets (not blinding. Just spamming the button), or dropping someone next to hatch just to close it, or Tbagging aren't disrespectful. Killers can BM just as much as survivors, but you would want to ignore that because "killur main bad"
---
It's good because it can be used for loops that a long and where you can  be ran around for a hella long time also uhh people who just got the game good for them so they don't spend the entire game on one person just trying to get a hit. But who knows I'm just a killer main so
---
Its needed, because forever loops still exist.
---
Doctor is great for points and has Monitor and Abuse. Hag has Ruin and Devour Hope. Myers had Play with your Food and Save the Best for Last. Cannibal has BBQ and chilli. These, in my opinion are the best teachables for killer.
---
Meg has Adrenaline, David King has Dead Hard, Dwight has Bond and Laurie Strode Has Object of Obsession and DS. David also has we're gonna live forever which is good for points.
---
Well because new players (or bad players) need a helping hand every once in awhile because we got to give them a chance plus if you're looping them too the point they have bloodlust 3 then alot of gens should be done.
---
There are still too many strong buildings ( Ironworks of Misery, Groaning Storehouse, Wretched Shop, Rancid Abbatoir, Fractured Cowshed, Torment Creek, Disturbed Ward, Haddonfield ) and without blood lust, these loops would become infinites, so no.

Wow, such skill to run around a pallet until you get bloodlust 3
---
I was taking it from were the person was they were at Level 30. P0 was basically complete. So it wasn‚Äôt 150+180. 
---
Also 45K is way too much for the early 1-15 levels.

I like Doctor for Points, if you use survivor pudding I typically get something like 60000 bp which is enough for about 2-3 levels at lower levels and 1-2 at higher
---
Handicapping yourself for no reason is not tunneling and not running A+ addons and Mori‚Äôs everywhere but people still do it. There‚Äôs no fun in an easy victory. At least for me and some others.
---
Get good.
---
I mean if i know that we ain't gonna get all the gens done then imma just leave your ass on the hook...
---
Only two I can think of is haddonfield with a specific perk and abattoir
---
Survivor mains üôÑ, some killers need bloodlust. If a huntress is out of hatchets she'll never catch up and will lose the survivor if she gets more. Killers need it as a punishment for survivors running around forever
---
Y'all ever realised The Krusty Krab is a real life crab trap
---
Lmfao
---
Spirit is really good butttt if you are on pc I would say hag just because ruin (I also think she is super fun to play). Devour hope is pretty good too if you can make it last.
---
Leatherface isn't the greatest killer but he has bbq &amp; chili and knockout.
---
and bloodlust is a problem how?
---
1. Decisive Strike has a 60 second window.
---
2. * Survivor Crawling is 0.7m/s basic, 1.05m/s with Tenacity.
---
* Total distance covered in 60s is 42m regular, 63m with Tenacity.
---
3. * Killer Carrying speed is 3.68m/s.
---
* Total distance covered during the default wiggle time of 16s is **58.9m**.
---
If the killer makes the most of their wiggle time ***and*** if you don't have Tenacity, you're dead.
---
The moral of the story is, don't hook people beside an open Gate unless you're using Blood Warden.
---
Sounds like a problem for future meg.
---
That's why we don't stay too close to the loop
---
After they send 2 different stats that fisp oves each other I don't care what they say about it. First they posted several graphs where they show EVERYTHING included in the survival rate by RANK that shows is 80%
---
Then they come out and say it's below 50% which is pretty contradictory. Now that you said I think something I never stated I wanna ask you a question, even if I know already pretty dishonest after what you said
---
If you put the best survivors vs the best killer who's gonna have an edge? Let's say in a tournament, let's say in the official tournaments and unofficial ones. If you answer killer it's laughable
---
Survivors don't play to win but to fuck around many times. The matchmaking put an high priority to swf since there are already 3-4 survivors ready which lead in a poor experience for killer many times. In the other hand solo survivors like myself are in a low priority that will have a poor experience due to team mates that get downed in 20s. Why all this? To explain why these rates are dumb, they don't specify what's high ranks for them, 10-1? 7-1? Which lead in a wide variety of bad data.
---
Especially after saying and showing 80% and then after a while, WITHOUT any major change drops to 50%? How? What are they counting? They count killer dc as a win, lost or ignore it?
---
It's unbelievable that without any major change except ghostface and Freddy rework the survival rate dropped to almost half don't you think?
---
People like, companies lie and I won't take these lies on face value. Even if they said the opposite, first that survival rate was 50% and now 80% I would be the same, skeptical about it. The game isn't balanced since nurse addons need a Nerf and other killers powers/speeds etc need a buff like the pig instead of nerfing her for no reason
---
As well as survivors perks that are so useless and yet ignored. Deja Vu still a joke same as Quinton perks. The datas BHVR provides are a joke for these reasons. Sounds like a way to pacify the community, first saying "dw killer we know 80% of people escape" then after a while turn to survivors "we know you suffer.. you barely live to these bad boys!"
---
It's a joke and still unbalanced game for either sides. More often than not towards killers due to gen speed and lack of choice in high ranks that makes easier for survivors learn those 3 killers after a while and do the same thing over and over
---
No...they dont? If a huntress is out of hatchets, that's her fault, shouldn't have missed.
---
Technically the killer is following YOU around that pallet, lmao. If bloodlust counters your looping,  you are the one that is braindead not planning ahead to your next loop. Lmfao, never a survivor's fault.
---
Me, but with Huntress
---
Learn some key loops for each map and strategies for each killer. For example You can try and run Leatherface around tight walls and corners and cluttered areas of the map so he doesnt oneshot you with his chainsaw. Also try to spot which perk the killer is using and formulate counters for them, like only work on gens solo if you think the killer is using Discordance or go into a locker each killer hook to avois being seen by bbq and chili. In the end, skill in this game comes from Trial and Improvement and lots of experience with each map and killer.
---
Shitty killers will use it to get a hit on you because they dont have a brain and can't break/mindgame a pallet.
---
Oh oof, I apologize. I play Mobile and it‚Äôs till 600 &amp; 1000. Thank you for the correction, I now feel like an ass
---
I can organize like that.
---
So you're saying that is a survivor is able to abuse a jungle gym and pellets long enough the killer should never be able to catch them and lose
---
This is literally how everyone acts before a chapter reveal lmao
---
You can grab survivors cleansing totems, repairing gens, unhooking, looting chests (IIRC, not 100% sure), going into or getting out of lockers. You can basically grab survivors doing any action, so it'd make sense to be also able to grab healing survivors
---
Distortion / Quick and Quiet / Balanced Landing / Aftercare, always bringing a basic medkit with me. With this I get enough information about my teammates and the killer's whereabouts, also I can know if he uses BBQ / Nurse's etc etc... And when I get chased I can use high grounds without being scared, and use jungle gyms at their proper potential when I'm hurt (use the pallet to delay killer, self heal with medkit for half a second, benefit from Distortion "no scratch marks" effect, quick vault a window with Quick and Quiet to bamboozle even more the killer and run away from him without leaving any trail). I sometimes change Quick and Quiet for Poised, to truly become a running ghost
---
A friend of mine had the bug, that he got unhooked and was running with infinite sprint burst....
---
i thought comment OP meant the kid characters like eleven and the others
---
I hate when it pops on all 8 gens
---
He couldn't keep the Evil within anymore
---
Well, 3 of them had teachables, so they can't be total baby Nea's. But yea, fuck this rank matchmaking.
---
No, fuck killers, tbag them everytime you can, if you know they arent gonna catch you.
---
Enjoy the DCs, should make her day worse. 
---
Bad day? Do a fun build! Basement chest Bubba who accepts trades is always hilarious. T1 Myers only going for grabs is fun. Just have fun and don‚Äôt stress about X number of kills.
---
Yeah, here. I die instantly in a chase so I try to avoid the killer at all times while doing something productive.
---
...but deliverance makes you broken and getting unhooked from a teammate...doesn't.
---
Rip me I can't even play old Freddy even though I was good with him before the rework
---
-me to old Freddy
---
Everytime I play as the killer I get this No Network Connection error, even tho I can play survivor no problem.
---
I rarely play but could it be for the extra points?(if there is extra points for closing it)
---
Most comments here fail to understand how statistics work. Over a large enough sample size, things that skew individual results matter less and less. Add-on and item usage gets averaged, too, and of course those have to be considered in the "balance" because they actually exist and get used.
---
Statistics time and again have shown that kill rates are around and above 50% for all killers throughout all ranks. Even most recently they've stated the worst kill rate for the worst killer on the worst map at rank 1 was above 50%, and I think that was even with excluding disconnects (which there are however reasons why they should be included, increasing the kill rate even more).
---
Killers especially on reddit still scream bloody murder about survivors being unbeatably OP, though.
---
You forgot your /s
---
I think the killer deserves it for that dedication xD
---
Counters it because they are braindead and can't break or mind game the pallet. Thanks for proving my point.
---
Ah
---
Until something's done about the way some pallets and windows can be exploited to high hell for a very long period of time let's keep bloodlust otherwise people who know those things like the back of their own hands would have a crazy advantage. Not every Killer has the luxury of blinking and traps to stop endless looping of the same pallet of building for people who'd rather just loop than actually break the chase and hide, which would cancel the bloodlust. Bloodlust could become a problem if there's a lot of open field. If bloodlust is removed or nerfed than there also needs to be less pallet loop spots, or rather if someone tries to loop the same pallet for too long the Entity blocks the loop like it does windows if the same window keeps being overused. I feel like there's a couple of balancing issues with map design. If things are to be completely balanced I'd even suggest the game discourages hard camping by giving the Survivors fast repair speeds if the Killer is close to a hooked Survivor for a certain amount of time, or something like that. Hopefully these things get resolved eventually like how the endgame timer resolved the issue of people holding matches hostage.
---
That's fair enough, the game ultimately is meant to be played for fun so I can say you're wrong, respect to you for playing your way my man
---
This is me, but Wraith.
---
I kinda have a particular love for characters with incredibly sad backstories forced to do things against their will, and big, tall people who could carry me on their shoulder, the Wraith's entire "For Whom The Bell Tolls" design and his invisibility made me want to main him really, really hard, and from that point forward, he basically became the only Killer I really wanted to play.
---
Recently, it's been kind of hard to play him since, even past all the buffs, at my rank, survivors usually end up finishing the first three gens very, very quickly, and unless I have All-Seeing + Windstorm it becomes impossible for me to keep up.
---
I had to pick up Hillbilly and Huntress to compensate, but it also made me earn a new-found respect for Wraith's position whenever I do win as him, the amount of raw work required to master all the loops and optimize the shit out of your gameplay to get kills as him is insane, and it'll make you generally a better killer as a result, I doubt I'd be as good as killer if I hadn't chosen Wraith as my main.
---
Using her powers
---
survivors who think theyre the shit and the next noob3 or DemiPlays but in actuality they cant go one game without wasting god pallet in the first 30 seconds of a game or hit 3 skill checks in a row
---
The theme is horror
---
Yes but it has a somewhat ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô theme, they‚Äôre all humans, no aliens or sci-if creatures, which is kinda why I don‚Äôt want a demogorgon but whatever.
---
What? Do you know what ''having a main'' is? Most of my friends plays survivors but have like 2 or 3 matches as killer, so no, not everyone plays both. I play what i'm feeling like atm
---
Finally i can construct a mini person with unbreakable, dance with me, diversion, and borrowed time
---
What about perks like distressing? Or does that not exceed the 32k cap?
---
Yeah. I liked season 1 of Stranger Things but DBD and Stranger things is not a good mix.
---
And I got a dashboard/ALT+F4 with your ebony on it.
---
Only on my penis, but thats my doing and not company policy.
---
As well as those two, there's the **Groaning Storehouse** if the window is open, **Coal Tower** if the window is open, **Ironworks of Misery** if the window is open, **Suffocation Pit** if the window is open, **Wretched Shop** centre building, **Fractured Cowshed** if the window is open, **Torment Creek** if the window is open, **Crotus Penn Asylum** centre building and finally **Grim Pantry** if the window is open. 
---
I'd say there's more tbh.
---
Is it on Monday or Tuesday?
---
Based on the post and how this guy is responding to comments, this guy definitely sounds like the type of dude to run pink hair nea with a purple flashlight who runs around looking for the killer, teabags at every pallet, has BT, adrenaline, DS, and dead hard (and uses Dead hard to bait hits) and then teabags endlessly at the exit gates, DCs when downed or hooked, and tells the killer that they are terrible when they die in the endgame chat.

Gotta give doctor a try tbh
---
I wouldn't say a depip is necessary, but I don't see a situation as to where you would depip from a 4k unless you facecamp like 2-3 of them to death or slug and let them bleed out. Tombstone Myers being 1 of the very very very few outliers to this.
---
It isn't exactly indicative of you being too good, but rather the team of survivors not being up to snuff for you. There is too little information in the match to say "you deserve to accelerate to Rank 1 faster" as a match ending in a couple minutes means the survivors either DCed or put up literally no resistance at all.
---
Do you or anyone even realize the whole reason why the pipping system was even made harder in the first place? It shouldn't be a walk in the park to consistently 2 pip every match which it used to be for both killer and survivors, you should've seen how effortless it was for survivors when they didn't get penalized for unsafe unhooks.  Ranking up should be difficult so that you can accurately place where you should be, or else we run into the problem of where red ranks are bloated with players who aren't really good at all and got carried there by easy to win pip system.

---
I didn't know endgame chat extended out to reddit.
---
In the loading screen. Good luck waiting the loading screen and then waiting 10 more minutes to find a match while a find one in seconds
---
I mean, a 4k that happens quickly sounds like he showed no mercy
---
Not bannable, and it will help most likely but not the way you think. DbD's VSync makes your game peak at 30/35 fps in most cases. Disabling it will make you benefit from the sweet 60fps that makes the game more fluid, so skillchecks won't be jerky anymore (or at least less)
---
Teabagging really makes a killer who did their best feel like their efforts are useless, and it's extremely counterproductive to creating a non toxic community. It's why so many people bring Ebony moris, play 5 blink Nurse, and bring Franklin
---
Because I played both roles from the start I knew what it does very fast
---
maybe try playing a game of survivor then go back to killer?
---
No u
---
Tried that, which is how I found out I can play as a survivor but not a killer.
---
Thank you. Thinking better, what I did was unnecessary. I'm no longer going to teabag. It's annoying when I play killer.
---
You got 28k, so obviously it wasn't that bad. It's not like you got curb stomped and limped out with 10k or something. You're just spoiled getting free 4ks by playing Spirit in green. Try playing other killers to put things in perspective.
---
Using noed on the one of the best add on sets and then hits the person on the hook. Now that‚Äôs what I call a pro gamer move
---
Downvoted for lack of punctuation, sorry. Honestly though, get with the times. Language is evolving and emojis are a part of that. You aren't cool for being anti-popular consensus. Most people use emojis. More will in the future. This is a terrible stand to take and is only getting in the way of language progression. A progression that is quite interesting and one I am very excited to see. You look like a pretentious asshole right now, and nobody likes that. üëé
---
i don‚Äôt know then, sorry :(
---
&gt;mean... survivors have just as many options, if not more to do the same things. Play a little of both sides and you might start to see the full picture.
---
Rank 1 on both.
---
Well it's when one suffers the effects of starvation in which the effects start when alone with another tribes member causing a great hunger to set in  making you crave the flesh of your hunter partner leading you to eat them if you can't resist the urge causing you to turn into a wendigo. you go back and hunt your family and tribe causing you to get burned or  getting a tribes member to help you release the wendigos clutches off you  wendigos look more animalistic in the stories told about them rather then lengthy humans with humanoid type features. The wendigos curse from I believe a witch from my best understanding so no it isn't caused by birth more so hunger

Thats a good attitude, if you dont like it when other players do something specific to you, try to avoid doing it to them.
---
Okay? lol, whatever you say.
---
I wish you‚Äôve seen my luck with connection if you think this is bad
---
With a good headset it doesn't even matter
---
I get your logic, I just don‚Äôt think it would play well and would just make it more tedious. Easily just stop the healing animation mid swing and it works exactly the same. Just let the survivors have their heals imo lmao
---
Yeah, I am right. Thank you, and fuck killers.
---
You owe nothing to anyone as survivor ever. Play it for fun and if being a sneaky solo style player is fun, fuck em lol
---
Oh, I'm stung. Guess I'll have to... Wait? Okay.
---
That moonwalk at the end tho
---
But if killers do it and I still escape, am I allowed to do so?
---
So gens we‚Äôre powered and noed was active, but the hatch hadn‚Äôt spawned yet? That story makes no sense
---
God I love the names.

"purples" were 8, you are 10. The differences between you and then is minimal.

So you were just matchmaked with only 2 people "out of the reasonable field". It's not that bad, actually.
---
Yea, heard a lot of people couldn't, mine ran fine though
---
Nice idea, however i would prefer seeing something like this for wraith. Demogorgon better have something linked with Upside-down, IMO
---
Honestly, I find it hard to say. I was talking about this with a streamer recently because something similar happened to them, they experienced lag switches before and they weren't to sure on the matter. It honestly could be. But it might be safer to just bet it's a rubber band. Not an expert tho, so my opinion doesnt mean much
---
I never get how people film with their phones and catch the best moments.Or is this a saved replay?
---
Considering the two DCs, I would've given her hatch. Poor girl.
---
It literally is
---
I really dont know who to play. No killer truly stands out to me in terms of playstyle or anything really
---
Fuck off with the emojis brother
---
Welcome, Noob! You're in luck. I'm going to give you the actual list of survivors you should level up to become a hardcore, toxic, gets-tunneled-and-face-camped, sweat-filled, meg/nea main you could ever hope to become! 
---
The first thing I have to tell you is that solo-queing and swf are completely different, and should be treated as such! This list is for solo queues. 
---
Iron Will- I've got over a thousand hours in this game and I will tell you that Iron Will is one of the most underrated, overpowered survivor perk there is. Necessity for when you're being chased. 
---
Adrenaline- Another overpowered survivor perk. It's a crutch perk, though, so you only have to use it sometimes (it's almost a needed at red rank, but lower ranks are a meh type-of-thing). 
---
Dead Hard- When I first started the game, sprint burst was the meta due to the fact that you could run and your exhaustion would still go down (i.e. infinite sprints), but they nerfed that moons ago, so dead hard has taken it's place. A lot of people will try to tell you that balanced landing is a sufficient replacement for dead hard, and it's not. Not even close. Only bother with balanced if someone is offering the game/haddonfield. Learn how to be a bitchass dead hard user. 
---
Your fourth perk is really up to play style. I call it the blank perk. A lot of people are nice and put borrowed time on, but I reserve that perk for swf only. If you're solo queueing, I'd suggest a self-help perk like distortion, self-care (though no one at red ranks runs it bc it's a waste and takes too long, and it's pointless during swf), *cringes* urban evasion, or decisive strike. Lightweight is a good one if you're playing on console. 
---
I would level up Jake, Meg, David, and Laurie if you buy the Halloween chapter (highly recommend, just bc MM is fun to play) or Jeff bc I think distortion is amazing. 
---
Killer-wise, the only two I would say are necessary for noobs are hag and leatherdaddy, for ruin and bbq. ruin is a general gen-stop perk (it gets less effective once you get to purple/red ranks), and bbq is nice for bloodpoints and aura reading. But playing killer is so diverse that it will all depend on how you play and what killers you prefer. I, typically, play killers with teleportation abilities/abilities that affect travel (hag, spirit, freddy, wraith, nurse, billy, legion) so my builds tend to be chase and movement heavy. A lot of them are running pop goes the weasel, bbq, make your choice, and thana.
---
Head On, Quick and Quiet, Borrowed Time, Unbreakable. Tbh Head On is so good now that theyve fixed it, personally my new favorite exhaustion perk.
---
Can i ask, is this a troll ?
---
I was gonna suggest the op play some Overwatch.  Sigma and the 2-2-2 changed things up I took a break from DBD to enjoy that now I'm ready to jump back in salt free, for like 3 games probably xD
---
Xenomorph makes zero sense in game also because he is stupidly OP. He doesn't give a fuck about light, can move on walls and ceilings, is WAY more faster then a regular killer and every his attack can literally tear survivor apart. None of any other killers' weapons can inflict such horrible damage as Alien's claws, tail or teeth. If they ever add him into game he would be nerfed to the ground, which would make him a fucking joke.
---
‚ÄúOne of the best add on sets‚Äù... lol
---
ü§£üóúüéáüå†
---
Everyone will say Resurrection is overpowered because it's another second chance perk. I think it should be changed that you stay alive for a period of time and you will die after the time expires, instead of needing another hook.
---
I'd honestly play killer (Wraith for lower ranks, Hillbilly/Huntress once you get to green ranks) in order to gain blood points. Get BBQ (Cannibal) from the Shrine, if it ever makes it there again. Gain more blood points.
---
Also play survivors. 
---
If you're a scared person like me who plays stealthy at the beginning to gain confidence in juking over time, I'd recommend:
---
- Dwight (Perks are alright but he's great for playing along with other players and knowing where they are.. helped me a lot)
---
- Invisidette (Self Care// the plant perk)
---
- Nea (Urban Evasion)
---
... once you're more into chases and know how to juke, get into:
---
- Meg (Adrenaline)
---
- David (Dead Hard)
---
- Bill (Borrowed Time)
---
Too expensive
---
baby you spin me right round
---
But by the time he gets to DbD we find its not the Matt Damon Bourne but the Jeremy Renner one üò•üò•üò•
---
Is there any benefit to this knowledge, though? Or is it purely a cosmetic fyi?
---
Yeah I meant ultra rare.
---
Nurse: Shadowborn, Nurse's calling, Whispers, Deerstalker, no add-ons. Zero DLC needed.
---
I personally don‚Äôt have a problem unless you get a black pip/depip when no one escaped the match. You shouldn‚Äôt have release pressure to let people pick themselves up just to get a pip. Especially when you have to ‚Äúget a feel‚Äù of how much emblem score you have and gamble to get what you want (‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure... Should I hook them or let them go and hit them one more time to ensure I get my emblems?)
---
When it comes to personal stuff. I haven‚Äôt played the game as a killer for a few months I got rank-reset all the way to rank 20. I practically can‚Äôt play the game now. You wait 40 minutes for a 5 minutes match, in which you crush people that are way under your skill level to maybe get a pip and have no fun at all. I can either smash them (no pips, destroyed gameplay experience for them) or farm with them (pip, destroyed gameplay experience for them, negative fun for both sides). I don‚Äôt have enough time and will to sit through this boredom and get to a reasonable rank where I can actually have some fun. It‚Äôs been 2 days of me trying to get somewhere and I moved up from 20 to 18...
---
Looks great and all, but how difficult is it to see in that Pig mask? It can‚Äôt be too easy normally, but the hair over the eyes must make it so much more difficult, surely?
---
Imagine if it is just skins rather then a full chapter
---
Because there is no game chat for survivors
---
HEY I KNOW THIS GUY!
---
Upside down question marks...
---
If it turns out to be an actual stranger thing chapter im gonna be happy and surprised, because all this time i tought it was just the comunity going crazy with this
---
Either you are trolling, or you have never left brown ranks
---
Yeah, but idk what they mean
---
No its ¬ø
---
Welp I'm rock solid.. full of hype get your mind of the gutter folks. (Please be a demogorgon BHVR don't fuck us because we already got fucked enough with the bugs.
---
The question marks are also upside down. Maybe we could get a map of Hawkins but in the upside down
---
Tbh same.
---
[Twitch link for those who prefer there](https://www.twitch.tv/deadbydaylight). Hype train is rolling out my dudes.
---
O LORD I HATE THIS IMAGE
---
Facts
---
Inb4 the question marks are upside down because we are getting a spanish chapter.
---
I'm personally hoping Billy is the killer, I agree that demogorgan wouldn't really fit
---
Its likely a reference to the Upside Down from stranger things (which is what the dlc will probably be about)
---
Still will make me happy as i love their design team
---
Imagine if the killer would be The Entity itself, in spiderman form, that would be scary!
---
I feel it‚Äôs more likely that whatever the killer is will have an ability that transports survivors into the upside down
---
I confess I have a rucking crush on Lisa, Anna and Susie
---
If this comic is anything to go by, then it means I‚Äôm cheating on Myers with Ghostface and Freddy.
---
Fuck.
---
U're right lol
---
I'd buy it
---
I love this! Great job. Now, who would be the killer? Angelus? The Master?
---
¬ø
---
If your on xbox you can go on recent players just so u know :)
---
That is GENIOUS
---
I think it is! We expected the Stranger Things chapter to be chapter 14 or 15 because thet wouldn't put two big chapters like ghost face and stranger things together, but seeing the recent tweet by Netflix that said "... *Dead" "by* 5-1-5" "... some *Daylight"*
---
What's this??
---
Did you spend real money on the game?
---
How is there no game chat for survivors?
---
Dead By Daylight updated to 1.70 on PS4 or 3.1.3 on the home screen. Added languages.
---
Kiryu as a survivor pls
---
I'm always surprised when I see a clown.  He definitely seems to be the least popular killer.
---
I feel this love story. 
---
I brought Doctor to level 50 and got a decent build with him because I love the concept of his character so much... Yet, I just can't get behind his play style. I really tried but I'm just garbage with him and I dropped him.
---
Trapper daddy is still my favourite.
---
Ash is the only character to talk during the lobby
---
They put Cannibal, Freddy and Pig one after each other, even if all of them are licnesed killers.
---
I‚Äôll hook you baby ; 0)
---
I do my fair share during a match, trust me dude. Not all people who run spine chill are sitting in bushes there meta Mikey, chill out.
---
frick
---
Yeah! Also, the upside down question marks may be a reference to Upside Down (something of Stranger Things) as someone commented
---
Damn it almost like people thought I was serious on this sub, this sub is majority soft people so I thought if I didn't post an actual statement it'd be fine but nop
---
I'm hoping for a new character cause I don't find many killers fun
---
It‚Äôs probably tied to the Gamescom or whatever that‚Äôs going on today that big game event for indie titles and I think Xbox.
---
That would be amazing
---
Seems like it was just to support 4 new languages
---
I have to disagree on the all seeing gens addon. You can instantly find survivors doing the one thing they need to do most of the time. It either put it at the same rank as all seeing blood, or even higher.
---
I'm pretty bad at predicting his chainsaw reaction.  At that time all I could think about was how long can I elongated the chase safely and the only thing I could think of was throwing the pallet quickly before he revvs the chainsaw to make sure I was not making any mistake.
---
Yea I‚Äôve been hearing a lot of Claudette so I think imma go with her after I‚Äôm done with David
---
Changed it sorry, it‚Äôs suspiciouscorvid
---
Some people prefer having their spine chill in a certain slot that‚Äôs the most visible, for example, but personally I don‚Äôt see any value
---
Why would they leak it if it did have stuff?
---
Definitely new characters but we have no clue if it will contain a killer or not
---
If you have time to chat you're doing it wrong, hold that M1, or M2 if you can.
---
Update I had account problems so my @ is now suspiciouscorvid
---
I know the satisfaction of killing an annoying survivor that keeps clicking a flashlight to grab your attention and or runs around in circles, makes me feel in like manner.
---
I can't wait to murder people while pooping
---
please have skins for Jake, Dwight, Meg and Claudette as four of the kids
---
I have BLOODWARDEN
---
I just saw the flair next to your name and I like
---
If no one does I will
---
Do you hear that sound....
---
I think it's a.....
---
r/whoosh
---
I mean if it was an update for bug fixes or adjustments they‚Äôd be displayed at the home page. If there‚Äôs a ghost patch to tie in with an event or something who knows  but as for now it‚Äôs just that.
---
We already know all chapters this year have a killer.
---
I think either The Gentlemen or The First Evil would make awesome killers.
---
Why do you think so? I pretty much main him, but I wouldn't say he's best. He's definitely most fun imo, though.
---
Yeah sure! Feel free to DM if you want details
---
it's a big h. M mm m  to me but I mean legit they've hinted so much at stranger things, maybe not tho.
---
Hi am bing bong and bzzt bzzt main
---
I play on console, was just a curiosity question
---
ITS STRANGER THINGS HOLY SHITITITIT
---
Baby Surv (:
---
yeah that's a meg job and run away using sprint burst
---
Your very presence cause people to lose their fucking mind, increased chance of ree battalion while nearby, massively increased chance of downvotes for anything that can't be detected as bait
---
I was joking. I have screenshots of my account if you want..
---
Are you spending real money or working off shards?
---
Game was a gift I only payed for 2 chapter in sale was like 10‚Ç¨
---
Yep. Confirmed.
---
Well they disconnected when they were about to die...
---
I wouldn't say this normally, as a Huntress Main, but, that... 
---
...That tugged on my heartstrings.
---
*Sniff.*
---
FUCK YES
---
DEMOGORGON CONFIRMED. AOUIHAJGF I'M SO FUCKING STOKED.
---
Rank 1 on both sides. Try harder.
---
TWO SURVIVORS?
---
BRUH YOU WRONG
---
2 survivors in 1 chapter... wtf
---
WOK WOK WOK WOK WOK
---
Ok so it is the demogorgon, but two survivors? That's really cool
---
Tell me I wasn‚Äôt the only one that just saw the new reveal of Stranger things chapter???
---
First none human killer so they can make anything a killer now which is interesting to me
---
I dont even know what that series is about. So not hyped at all.
---
IM HAPPY I AM
---
Yes!!! No Quentin treatment!
---
WHAT
---
Meh they should have made Billy the killer

I thout it was going to be one survivor

OMGGGGG STRANGER THINGS DID YOU GUYS SEE THE CLIP
---
Those are the good days
---
I am fucking hyped
---
I guess it was reavelded before why am I just hearing this now?
---
Wait so just to clarify, there isn‚Äôt one?
---
I'm so fucking hyped
---
There goes my wallet
---
probs like spirit moves faster when in the upside down or something like that. hawkins lab is gonna be crazy scary tho.
---
Fuck the lore, they'll make anything a killer if it's for a good license.
---
So. Fucking. STOKEDDDDD. ASDOIAHDG ALL OF MY DREAMS ARE COMING TRUE
---
Tell me Steve is the survivor
---
Yes. And no Quentin treatment!
---
Yes it does? Being in the same genre doesn't make it a rip off. That's like saying every fps was a rip off of cod or Halo because of similar gameplay.
---
IM SO DAMN HAPPY ITS THE DEMOGORGON. IM MAINING HIM SO BAD AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT SAID HE WASNT COMING TO DBD YOU WERE WRONG BUT THATS OK AS ITS OK TO BE WRONG IM SO HAPPY .
---
BRUH
---
I was really hoping someone would post this picture immediatly.
---
It is a killer üòÇ
---
I'm going to wind up my good hand
---
they really did make us wait half an hour just to reveal the stranger things chapter and end the livestream LMFAOOO
---
Fuck people who do this. Had an Adam the other day hide in lockers the entire game and the two remaining people got hooked for the first time with one gen left. He just stayed there and let us die before diving into the hatch.
---
RIP my wallet
---
LMAOO
---
60% upvoted after 1 min, complains about downvotes Pepega.
---
When is it coming out?
---
and Robin the Survivor :(
---
Holy moly chapter 13 will be a meaty one. 2 survivors, 1 killer, 1 map, bloodweb changes and most likely dedicated servers
---
Imagine being mad at the killer for trying to kill people instead of the genius unhooking right in front of him.

Thank you, I'm glad I caught this between all the Stranger Things promotional trailer images being spammed
---
On The last frame it can be seen a house looking mid 89s like the Joice‚Äôs Byers house of stranger things (the frame looks like it‚Äôs in a walkway)
---
Everyone's favorite mom, Steve "The Hair" Harrington.
---
Hyped for new killer and survivors! 
---
But another indoor map is sad
---
I think he's going to be like old Freddy but he snatches the survivor through his portals transporting them into his realm making pallets spawns in different places and windows are covered in the black goo making them slower.
---
I'm gonna fucking nut I AM SO EXCITED
---
Our first double survivor chapter, cool!
---
Two survivors who actually look like the actors, BHVR is out here spending coin!!!
---
You're getting a new killer and you're not hyped at all?
---
Wraith:
---
Brutal Strength, Hex: No One Escapes Death, Whispers, Enduring
---
A Nurse's Calling, Thanatophobia, Whispers, Sloppy Butcher
---
Wraith has quite a few worthwhile add-ons to use. A quick run-through:
---
"The Serpent" - Soot is nice in chases, saving you time uncloaking. It pairs well with "Blink" and "Shadow Dance" add-ons, since you will regularly want to be cloaking mid-chase, only then breaking pallets. It also has some synergy with "The Ghost" - Soot.
---
"The Ghost" - Soot is a great add-on to get surprise hits on survivors, though it does need to be paired up with Bone Clapper or Coxcombed Clapper to be really effective.
---
"The Hound" - Soot can be paired up with "Blind Warrior" - White to get a Sloppy Butcher + Bloodhound combo without spending perk slots.
---
"Windstorm" add-ons are great for map mobility but also have in-chase utility, cloaking mid-chase and catching up to a survivor after having hit them or kicked a pallet, or otherwise having lost proximity to them. Or yet, overtaking them and body-blocking off windows, pallets and pathways.
---
"Swift Hunt" is a solid go-to add-on since it decreases the distance survivors make on you while you are uncloaking, making early hits much more likely.
---
"Shadow Dance" can be used to free up a perk slot otherwise occupied by Brutal Strength. Cloaking at pallets and breaking them is often possible while maneuvering so that the survivor stays at the pallet for a moment, and so it's a time-saver.
---
"Blink" add-ons don't really have much use outside of combining them with "The Serpent" or "Shadow Dance". But it is of note that cloaking to 99% makes your model and red stain disappear for a brief moment, upon which you can let go of the cloaking interaction. This can be used in chases to some effect, and I guess "Blink" can kind of help with that.
---
"All Seeing" - Blood is great. It can be used for more general tracking and surprise hits, depending on the map, but also has strong in-chase value by being able to see how your opponent behaves while you uncloak, making post-cloak lunges a lot more effective. This is especially strong when paired with Coxcombed Clapper, as that way you can observe a survivor's behaviour without them even being able to react to you, resulting in a lot of easy hits.
---
"All Seeing" - Spirit is a great tracking add-on to save perk slots, leading you to gens that have survivors on them, which allows you to try and go for surprise hits and even grabs. It's particularly well-paired with Pop Goes The Weasel.
---
Holy fuck I'm so hyped
---
I mean, does it really matter if they are all human? They're only known as "killers".
---
This opens the door (hopefully) for the Xenomorph and Ripley in the future. A boy can dream.
---
Slap me too because I thought the same thing
---
Yeah that's what OP is saying...
---
Most people DC if you slug them.
---
I'm a killer main. The amount of times 2 people are left and only 3 gens are done and they escape cause a key is bs while most games it doesn't work it's bs when it does cause it is a free escape, it basically punishes the killer for getting kills
---
I call first slap!
---
Bubba: enters game
---
Survivors: Disconnect
---
Yes, it‚Äôs confirmed. Two survivors (six perks I guess), Demogorgon as the killer and a new map
---
I was thinking the same thing. She looks made for it lmao
---
I mean, we haven‚Äôt seen the ingame models yet.
---
In so happy they added him. Even though I dislike some of stranger things I love the demogorgon so having him in the game is awesome but I feel he's gonna get a nerf on release
---
No because there are currently more survivors then killers.
---
Sorry only realised after I commented üòÇ
---
yesSSSSSSSSSS OH I AM SO GONNA SHOW THIS TO MY 1 FRIEND WHO ACTUALLY BUT DOESNT PLAY DEAD BY DAYLIGHT HELL YEAH
---
I wonder if it means 6 new perks for Survivors... I'm so excited
---
HOLY FUCK IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.
---
literally
---
u/botanicangel
---
Did you not see the image that said new killer the demogorgon and 2 new survivors?
---
It's a great show, worth the watch
---
‚úã‚úã‚úã‚úã‚úã‚úã
---
This did't age well.
---
im a killer main...BUT WHENEVER I PLAY SURVIVOR IT WILL ONLY BE STEVE
---
I thought Chapter 12 didn't get a Survivor because Ash...
---
I mean if it's always standing up I assume it won't be too difficult since it's still got a humanoid figure.. but these does mean potential new killers that are aliens etc that still have like 2 arms and 2 legs
---
Stranger Things is too big of a deal to allow Nancy and Steve to just be skins. I would be really surprised if that were the case
---
And there are so many obvious differences that make identity V not a rip off. I don't care to argue this with you dude. Go learn what makes something a rip off.
---
Kind of hoping he does some cacooning shit where he can stick a player to something so survivors have to free them. Like what he does to Barbra?  But then again, that'd be really strong if you could spam it... Maybe a maximum of 2 players can be stuck?
---
Otherwise the only thing I can think of is similar to freddy pulling survivors into the ~~dream world~~ the upside down.
---
I wouldnt mind some interesting hex or obsession perks tbh
---
Thank god they finally broke that dumb rule, now we can actually have more variety on the design of future killers
---
I hate Stranger Things, but give me a new indoor map with no shack and I'll be happy.
---
Who knows lol,
---
I think so! This feels a lot more satisfying anyway, I k know its about licensing etc but I always feel a bit cheated if they only release one killer or one survivor and nothing else.
---
The spam is annoying af
---
I could see this as them deciding to put the effort in now to get a stranger body build in the game so that later they can branch out to adding less human creatures if they'd like to. (Looking at you, xenomorph).
---
every game I've been in as a survivor lately is macmillan. I've been using offerings just to get a different map D&lt;
---
Ehhh...the Demigorgon doesnt really fit in the killers for me. Ill wait and see if the perks are worth it.
---
?? It's literally the characters, the mapand the demogorgon
---
What was that?
---
Goodbye Nea, my love. Nancy my new main
---
Stands still at a pallet as the survivor jumps into you. GeT MiNdGaMeD!
---
it's always been like that. dbd started out with just trapper and the original four survivors
---
Cringe comps are cringe incarnate. Just by the way.
---
It is
---
Fs in the chat boys/girls
---
Indoor map though...
---
I think he's gonna snatch survivors and bring them to the upside down changing everything about the map,pallets spawn where they shouldn't,windows covered in the goo slowing down the survivors to make hunting them easier. Definitely feel he will get a nerf in my opinion or he'll be mid tier as the way the demogorgon is he can probably be really strong and survivors wouldn't want that. I'm hyped though and I'm maining the fuck out of it and wonder how his Prestige will look.
---
Hoo boi do I have good news for ya
---
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that it was easier to get the likeness of Steve and Nancy because Netflix still has them on contract for another season whereas Laurie and Quentin etc are long gone from the license holders of the movies.
---
*EVERYONE GET IN HERE*
---
I just hope the killer and survivors are good to play as/against
---
YYYOOOOOOOO!!!
---
You are welcome. I made sure to make it clear for all that cannot see pictures. Now i shall dissapear from existance since I do not watch Stranger Things
---
Stonks
---
Hopefully anyway werewolf would be awesome if we are getting demigorgon that means they can literally make anything a killer
---
New Survivor: Gerald ‚ÄúGarry‚Äù "Jerry" "Larry" "Terry" ‚ÄúGengurch‚Äù Gergich
---
Oh
---
hmmm I wouldn't be so sure about that
---
this is the best thing i can't with this game üò≠üò≠
---
How did you change your region? Without a credit card at least
---
Hi everyone. So the live stream is no more it was only about 30 minutes long. It‚Äôs still up I think. The only thing they showed was what I have recorded.
---
Had a match like this yesterday, 2 survivors, 2 gens
---
 Find meg near closed hatch, she looped me around for like 3+ minutes. Put her on  her first hook, BBQ doesn't activate, check the only gen we never ran by, zero progress, bee line for the hatch and found Meg2 in the locker beside the hatch. Turns out this other meg stayed in the locker only leaving to prevent crows for over 3 minutes.
---
&gt;vagina face
---
My precious baby Demogorgon looking damn good.
---
i would buy them no matter what honestly
---
VAGINA FACE! That‚Äôs so great üòÇ
---
I never watched Stranger Things, but this may be the push to get me to watch it. Still pumped up for it and glad for all the fans though.
---
good thing you hoped
---
soooooooo pumped
---
Not getting Nancy Thompson, the og badass, with the NOES chapter was a huge disappointment but getting Nancy Wheeler who is an homage to her makes up for it!!! NEW MAIN.
---
Also **first creature killer hype**!!!
---
This exact thing happened to me with Ash. I mained Ace for quite a while, but... when Ashy calls, I gotta answer.
---
I didn't, I'm on android so I used taptap
---
What Nagi means is; the trailer models are pre-rendered and made by different people than the ingame models, so the in-game models will look worse. Look at Freddy in his trailer vs. the in-game.
---
For the 2 survivors, i'm thinking it's going to be like the legion thing where you can switch from joey to sussie. Thoughts?
---
I'm lol'ing at Demigorgon hooking people
---
Still incredibly hyped though. If there's 9 new perks at least one or two of them has to be good.
---

i don't play survivor much...but when i do...its mother fucking steve harrington
---
an interesting thing to notice is that this is basically the first stranger things "game" which means we could be getting A LOT of new players
---
Yep. Bill has treated me well, but its time for a new era. 
---
\#BELIEVEINSTEVE
---
Anything you say? Time for the carnivorous plant killer!
---
Unpopular opinion: Kinda wanted Joyce as survivor, but im really hyped of having 2 survivors and dermogordon as a killer!And a new indoors map!
---
&gt;Nobody liked that.
---
Holy Jesus that mashup theme I think I just nuttid

Annoying af, because of the spam

Best part about this- now that they‚Äôve done the Demogorgon, the Xenomorph is no longer in the realms of impossibility.
---
Yes, but I wa stalking about the rights. In the case of Laurie and Quentin they got the rights to the character, but not the likeness of the actor. That‚Äôs why they look quite different from their film versions.
---
That does not seem to be the case with Steve and Nancy

Demogorgon easily. I feel he will fit the playstyle I've always wanted which is aggressive play just overwhelming the survivors. I've always hated every other killers playstyle besides clowns so seeing a giant beast that is known for being agile is making me hyped. I'm more so impartial to the others as I haven't watched the show but Steve looks cool. Wonder what the demogorgons prestige will look like though.

Wish I was this good at art to fake it but it is real
---
Extremely high latency can look the exact same thing as a lag switch. I was playing killer once and forgot I had a download running. I walked up to a Gen with all 4 people on it and one by one chainsawed them and they didn't run away which was confusing at first.
---
Yes i were, and he couldn't break a gen/pallet or check lockers while invis.  
---
(atleast the bone clapper makes his bell global)
---
It's called the demogorgon in the trailer though
---
We could get the piano from super Mario 64
---
Two survivors to make up for the fact gf had none. Maybe this was their plan all along
---
What? Plenty of characters survived past the point they were taken, let alone many sequels. Look at Laurie and Quentin for instance.
---
Hawkins lab is definitely an indoor map
---
It's the demogorgon
---
Ye it opens new possibilities for potential killers. However the Hag is already based on a wendigo sooo maybe not exactly that one. But I'm deffo hyped for the new chapter and everything after that.
---
Holy god, this is gorgeous! Amazing job!
---
From teaser we saw the he can stand or crawl.
---
Yea but this is their very first creature and I feel they will accidentally make him into a spot where he is either like old Legion and BS or nerfed legion which is just bad
---
Freddy's going to be ticked they got a different Nancy...
---
I was kinda hoping for Starcourt Mall, but the Lab makes sense as well.
---
Alright how many slaps you want?
---
I never bought that logic. Hag‚Äôs movement is already so close to a reverse jointed leg movement.
---
*I'm all ears*
---
Its very good. Season 2 is probably its low point (especially *that* episode) and even then its very entertaining
---
I was going to do this too, yet my friend also hasn't watched the show. So he won't understand the hype. =(
---
I hope they have voice lines I think it adds to the game
---
Let people spend their money as they want, it's not like they will be stronger than you. It's BAD when money make you strong in a way that a free player wouldn't be (Imagine that you could buy a tier 4 perks only with money). It's NOT BAD that money make people strong faster, but you still can be as strong by playing free.
---
I mean, chapter 14 is already confirmed to just be a killer and nothing else.
---
lmao lore in 2019

OH. Didn‚Äôt think about this one.

When that season came out, I did hear from fans that it wasn‚Äôt like the first season. But season 3 apparently blew the pants off everyone, so I have that to look forward to as well
---
Survivors are still just skins TBH
---
¬ø¬ø
---
Yeahhhh, I think all we can really do is give strong feedback (without crying or being hyperbolic) and get him adjusted accordingly
---
Still leaves us with a 4 perk disparity :/

What did you say?

Just imagine Ash pretty much. Won't be worse, probably won't be much better.

might be like legion where its one survivor with a reskin cosmetic (idk stranger things too well so idk if thats plausible)
---
Also additional exp

ü§ûPlease, custom menu music. ü§û
---
Having 60 or 64 perks doesn't really matter when everyone use like 10% of them, does it?
---
Same here. I guess I'll have to watch it all next week before classes start again...
---
It's far too early for these types of threads.
---
Skip 2x7
---
As a Stranger Things fan I couldn‚Äôt be more happier!
---
As a horror fan I‚Äôm ecstatic. The Demogorgon opens the door for other non-human killer.
---
Give us Chucky an a Xenomorph devs!
---
It doesn‚Äôt really matter that there is a difference in numbers since for both  sides have  a decent chunk of the perks might as well not exist with how bad they are compared to the other  options.
---
I'm so excited holy crap
---
this aged very well
---
Let's have mass slapping against this user.
---
Yea I just feel it'll happen. I don't know why, I also felt it with Ghostface and he got nerfed but not as badly but still nerfed. You feel the same way or optimistic?
---
Oh that is SO good!I know some people are complaining about it being licenced DLC, but as long as the content is good I'm down for it!
---
That's what I've been thinking! This is so hype!
---
I am not joking when I say I would buy this. I love your style. The Huntress has never looked so good!
---
To all my Dead by Daylight killer mains, it's Demogorgon time.
---
There's actually an entire Stranger Things game for season 3 on Steam.
---
Is it bad that I‚Äôm equally excited to see what Sam Animations is going to animate to this and I‚Äôm almost more on the edge of my seat waiting for that than the actual release?
---
There's alot of good survivor options they had, tough to choose one. Thankfully we got two. Hopper would of been another fantastic one. Bob, good ol' Bob.
---
I wouldn't mind tbh. Survivors are just meat suits, while you ideally would want to have every perks on every killer. If you get all 70 perks on a single survivor you're set, however unlocking 63 perks on all 18 killers is tough.
---
So kinda like the pig?
---
"Excuse me, I'll have you know that my teacher said it's not nice to say you hate something, especially something I like, like Stranger Things!!!"
---
Yes the xenomorph would be fun but now we would have to be extra careful cause he might be s tier as he can climb walls
---
Kind of does as the 4 perks might be useable?
---
STEVE STEVE STEVE STEVE STEVE STEVE STEEEEEEEEEEVE
---
We'll probably find out when the PTB is released as with the most recent chapters.
---
Me too, the talk about "ruining the lore" is nonsense. I would rather have interesting killers with unique powers then to keep getting generic "humans who killed few people" to get to entity's realm.
---
And Ash.
---
It makes sense now that we didn't get a survivor for Ghostface!
---
Don‚Äôt forget the ingame friend/lobby system!
---
I know but I mean I just feel like it'll happen. Of course I hope it doesn't and he's a strong killer but it just seems likely as this is their very first monster killer
---
Infantry belt. Let's you carry 2 extra hatchets. 
---
So you get 3 one shotting hatchets. If you run this and don't get 4 DCs immediately ur like...the second coming of jesus
---
Next killer should definetly be another creature, they are way more unnerving than -let's say- Bubba.
---
I aint even gonna lie, carter‚Äôs a cutie
---
I don't think so. The trailer said 2 survivors so I would be very surprised if they were just skins.
---
Plus weird vines up the walls
---

---
There isn't a vsync checkbox, but anyway what was happening was your system couldn't maintain a solid 60 FPS so it drops you down to 30FPS and if your system can maintain that it keeps you there until it can maintain 60 FPS then it would go back to 60, that's how double buffered vsync works. This game, by default, enables vsync and is capped at 60 FPS regardless of your chosen refresh rate.
---
So disabling Vsync (by changing opening GameUserSettings.ini and changing the line "bUseVSync" from true to false) will stop it from dropping the limit down to 30 but will still use the 60 FPS cap regardless of your chosen refresh rate unless you change the line "FrameRateLimit" which is also in GameUserSettings.ini from =0 to whatever you want your frame rate cap to be.
---
As for refresh rate you can use whatever you like. 
---
Your system wasn't able to maintain 60FPS so that's why you can't hit 144 FPS
---
Remember that both Leatherface and Ghostface were released without survivors.
---
Plus, if you think about it Legion is technically several killers, so Steve and Nancy might just be a skin swap like Frank/Julie/Susie
---
"New survivor" appears twice, for Nancy and for Steve. 2 new survivors
---
most Ace‚Äôs I find aren‚Äôt salty but some are just a little dumb lol, I think he‚Äôs a cool dude though.
---
Why advertise it then as "new survivor x" and "new survivor x"? Dont know the names as I dont watch stranger things. They are advertised as 2 seperate survivors.
---
Scoops cosmetic or we riot
---
It's going to be pre-rework Freddy with some new flavor.  100%
---
It was expected still hyped tho
---
Talking about the 8 bit looking one?
---
Sounds just like the mashup someone made before
---
The best thing about this is that this puts DBD out there to more people, making it more popular hopefully !
---
Well, I guess I gotta watch stranger things now
---
Was having a shitty morning. This hyped me right tf up!
---
Kate, I know I have the most goodies and perks on you, but...I may have to leave you for Steve.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cshs9d/so_since_the_trailer_of_the_new_chapter_is_out/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
That's what makes this deal profitable for BHVR. They are going to get a massive rise in players, and A LOT of DLC purchases.
---
Steve is going to be OP. How is anyone going to be able to bring themselves put best boy on a hook?
---
I‚Äôm a bit optimistic, but really only because I love stranger things. He may get nerfed if enough people complain. We‚Äôll have to see, he isn‚Äôt even out yet.
---
Season 2 did a lot of the same stuff season 1 did so it kinda lost its luster with fans along with having 1 episode dedicated to a storyline that completely changed the mood and genre of the show entirely and is almost unwatchable by my standards, so S2 gets a lot of flak although outside of that one episode (i think its episode 7 iirc) its pretty good but season 3 stepped it up quite a bit and was by no means a rehash which could be argued for S2
---
Yea I'm praying he is just straight down in the middle with his ability. He seems like he'll be fun but weak I just feel worry some as I really like his design and Bhvr has a history of kicking the nerf cannon into overdrive with Licensed characters
---
Right, sorry for not being clear, I was talking specifically about the perks issue
---
We are going to beat you to death
---
For real
---
Might be != will be. Just wait. Perhaps all 3 killer perks will be S tier while 6 new survivor perks will be terrible. Perhaps all of them will be good. But most likely all of them will be average at best, like most new perks :/
---
It's too early to say.
---
Self care isn‚Äôt even that good lol
---
HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT...
---
My guess would be that it‚Äôs similar to Freddy‚Äôs but with just a Stranger Things spin where instead of a dream you are in the Upside Down, the place where the monster thrives in the show. It will probably be a state or something that you want to get out of ASAP as the killer will probably be powerful in it, or maybe it will be another situation where being in it isn‚Äôt so bad (kind of like Freddy).
---
Yea would be interesting. Feel he'll be Freddy 2.0 but a tier better
---
that‚Äôs the point
---
I guess that they for he licence for "Stranger Things^TM" from Netflix and not fot the characters separately, so to make it better on us they added another character, instead of just giving the normal 2 but more expensive
---
They've always said their not going to do unhuman-like killers, so things like the Demogorgan, Xenomorph, and others still have a good chance at getting in

Oh man that'd be a great way of doing the Demogorgon! A mechanic that's already part of the game being mixed with a power is always my favorite, like the Freddy pallets.
---
OH SHIT YOU MEANT YOURE NOT RESCUING THEM
---
either way it‚Äôs a dick move
---
typically that they are making YouTube videos about DBD. same as "ttv" indicating a Twitch streamer.

Hellraiser chapter please :-) Pinhead and Kristy cotton with a labyrinth map

PHAT slaps
---
No problem man. I once came with the brilliant idea of having survivor enter the injured state after stepping on a trapper's traps... Something which has been in the game since day one üòÇ been playing since launch so I guess it happens to everyone
---
To be fair, the demogorgon is quite humanoid. Bipedal, has fingers... uuhh... Yeah it still counts
---
id be willing to bet that even tho there's 2 survivors and therefore 6 new perks not a single one of them will be good
---
Each killer has their own unique power, while survivors are just skins. 
---
If you're trying to make a comparison with perks, I think you should way in the fact that survivors don't have unique powers like killers
---
A creature slightly humanoid how hunts between dimensions from a dark could dimension wich is like a mirror from our world and its controlled by a superior god like mind. I think it works better than any other killer.
---
np! I feel the same way, it's a little odd having the canon diverge so heavily.
---
They said we couldn't have a clown killer at one point? Weird, what was the reasoning behind that?
---
Goodbye wraith you have been my main for a long time but now it's demigorgon time
---
The game (map) has similar monitors in a little room near the drop down to the bathroom gen and don‚Äôt function as real cameras. Whilst it would be cool I think it‚Äôs just a funny way to introduce the survivors in the teaser.
---
Moooooom puh leeeeeeese
---
Damn I haven‚Äôt been following dead by daylight and haven‚Äôt been playing it in a while but holy shit this is wild!

Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!

Also a new map in a new realm. We haven't had a new realm since legion.

I just hope this map won't be the new lerys or gideon meat plant

All i see is that you also watch dead meat.

That's a fantastic meme. I'm saving this post

its humanoid, that prior statement was refering to things that would cause them to make a whole new skeleton.
---
*hookers
---
I hope they're not as "useful" as ghostface's perks or power lol.
---
Me with Ace when it comes to Steve
---
So can the demogorgon be blinded by a flashlight?
---
Holy shit, this is everything I could have wanted and more. Demogorgon and Steve main, baby!
---
and a new uss butterscotch as an offering to get to hawkins lab
---
Well. We have The Demogorgon so all bets are off
---
I'm guessing the demogorgon will be able to create portals that everyone can travel through, however if a survivor goes through it they become exposed, or something similar.
---
We did it Reddit!
---
u/botanicangle where are you?~
---
No they don't lol. There are meta perks that's true but that doesn't mean other perks don't see any use.
---
I feel like they could still add that map with Hopper/Joyce honestly, no rules against having 2 maps from one type of content!
---
only if theyre stupid about it. but sure pretend that touching self care at all is a bad thing, regardless of the situation. have fun getting found instantly by the killer when youre the last one because they hear "UGH OHH OOF" anytime theyre within a 50 meter radius of you
---
but if they had a key why would they want you dead? I'm confused
---
You are in fact a zoomer yes
---
Okay so just to be clear if the Demigorgon who is blatantly an alien monster is now okay and lore friendly...

Spurred on by the loss of your closest friends and the will to survive insurmountable odds you gain a second wind at the most unexpected of times.
---
Starts with 3/4/5 tokens 
---
Whenever you are saved from a hook or dying mode by a survivor you spend a token and will stun the killer for 1/1.15/seconds wherever they are on the map. The healing speed and action speed of yourself and the other survivor will be increased by 5/10/15% for 10 seconds.
---
At any point during the match you may utilise a special activated version of the ability. During this period you will be able to expend all remaining tokens to save a survivor who is in the midst of the Mori animation, cancelling it out and granting the survivor immunity to any further Mori attempts. This activation will down you 15 seconds after use. If out of the Killer‚Äôs Terror Radius
---
I‚Äôm just surprised it was the chapter 13 release, I was expecting it to be the chapter 14 release. I suppose I was just hoping for an original killer lol
---
Bloodweb changes? Is this confirmed?
---
Saw this post yesterday, then had it happen to me today. All I could picture was Sully‚Äôs face while it was happening.
---
It‚Äôs unfortunately only one map (The Underground Complex) is a region Hawkins National Laboratory
---
They literally just announced demigorgon so we can get anything at this point
---
But Steve is a hard working mother, what could be more badass than that?
---
I mean the demogorgons legs seem pretty animalistic, kinda like a cats legs
---
Gee Chapter 13! How come BHVR let you have TWO survivors?
---
Can we get a shirtless Steve? if no shirtless Myers we needs it

Most likely it will be since it is an underground map. I have mixed feelings about it. As long as they put new assets in the map.
---
Is it really that big of deal since we can only use 4 perks at once ? Also who said that any of these 6 new perks will be useful? We will be lucky if we get two.
---
This.
---
Untrue, demogorgon is still humanoid, and can still be made with the normal skeleton. Their prior comment was refering to killers that would require a whole new frame.
---
Swamp thing.
---
Gotta get that achievement!
---
Ah yes, excuse my lack of knowledge sir.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm posting this???
---
No, the lab is the realm, the underground complex is the map.
---
Its possible they‚Äôll give us more maps in the future like they did with Badham Preschool but it‚Äôs unlikely.
---
there was a mobile game for s2 as well. Pretty short but I think it counts. And then there is the cancelled telltale one.
---
Tbh, i never have my hype for unconfirmed things, after some personal deceptions
---
But good god, does it hypes me when its a official announce
---
Survivors have items and addons aswell. Don't forget that either. I feel like they should add more items aswell. We always get different kind of "fireworks" but I feel after 3 years a new item should be introduced aswell.
---
Me is excited
---
PHAT SLAP
---
Like, medkits too? If that's the case, have fun losing every game lol
---
It's a saved replay.
---
Ah, easily confused :‚Äô) still super excited. Hopefully it‚Äôs a nice sized map with some nice new interaction. Maybe automatic doors you can open using keypads and the like.
---
yes. Blogpost about the changes should go up any day now
---
but they have been avoiding exposed powers lately, havent they?
---
Stop.
---
even if it is similar to the two previous ones, I just hope they'll make it bigger
---
Pog pog pog champ
---
And dont forget that it's a 4 against 1 scenario so thats why killers have powers.
---
Well, how the tables have turned
---
Wait, what'd I miss?
---
I prefer ass slaps but wherever is fine
---
Who tf is this
---
As an Ace main, you are correct. Especially if they reduce perk grind.
---
Hey i‚Äôm gonna need you to shut your damn piehole
---
Seriously, I cannot get over this. I fucking love the devs, I love Stranger Things, but most of all, I love everyone on this sub. Holy shit
---
Fucking HYPE
---
Dont forget the switch release!
---
*slap*
---
I saw the livestream and was like hell yeah
---
The demo is the new killer, along with Nancy AND Steve!! :‚Äô)
---
Why does everyone seem to forget that the Hag is pretty much BHVR's take on a wendigo?
---
Killers will be lucky if they have atleast 1 üòÇ and even then it would probably get nerfed during ptb. Having 6 chances of getting a good perk is better than having 3 I'd say.
---
That was my first thought. I love Steve so much, there is no way that I can hook him :(
---
Thank you!
---
Monsters Inc.
---
Patience my friend
---
Too op, wouldn't be able to kill him
---
If they removed the tier system for perks it would help IMO.
---
Yeah 2 years ago when the game was first getting into gears they needed a way to fill out the Blood webs, but at this point we don't need to get 3 of the same perk.
---
Which is my point exactly, Curtis and whoever played Quentin didn't even know they had a character in the game.
---
add flag zombie as a killer please
---
Hopefully BHVR won't go Legion on Steve and Nancy where it's "one survivor" with different characters being skins. That would be super disappointing, but at the same time, I'm not getting my hopes up either.
---
So, there's a chance we could get just 1 set of survivor perks. But who knows?
---
Alt-title: "The Killer when you run them through pallet town and the balanced-landing-building-loop for two minutes and a half minutes, never once having to use an unsafe pallet, allowing a toolbox-squad to pop all five generators and open the exit gates because the game's pace is too fast."
---
Unfortunately the game really do be like that if you have three survivors on generators, tick-tock goes the clock.
---
You're welcome!
---
The ice cream scooper is his replacement for the pebble &amp; he just tosses it
---
FFFFFF
---
FFF
---
Billy would want to kill himself
---
Looks-wise Bubba is really unnerving, but his animations are just silly (They fit the character perfectly though.)
---
So much HYPE for this one! It actually makes up for the Scream ‚Äúchapter‚Äù in my mind.
---
Except in Alien isolation if it detected you, you were usually dead before you acquire the flamethrower. This wouldn‚Äôt make any sense in DBD because I just can‚Äôt see the xenomorph having to hit twice and putting people on a hook. That just contradicts what xenomorphs are. The perfect killer..
---
It's probably just another corridor. In the show, the hallways near The Gate were growing vines. There also isnt any of the Upside Down Spores and grayish filter so I dont believe it is.
---
Where's Barb?
---
): Too soon
---
flair checks out
---
Last 2. It took 2ish years I think for the rework and Ghostface is pretty low tier in my experience. I'm just saying I don't want him to get the legion treatment I want him good
---
You're right! My bad I mixed it up with some other games, I indeed changed the file you talking about after searching it online. Though: I now run it 60 fps, everytime. How could my system not be able to maintain 60FPS then, but maintains it now? I am truly asking it, not trying to be petty or anything, I just don't really understand as I could also run some games like Anthem at a nice 40/45fps with High settings...
---
They'll have to add him as the next killer I suppose :(
---
Im so coming back to this game!üòç
---
I think they‚Äôre both well aware now as Curtis‚Äô son is a big gamer and if I remember reading right Gallner himself actually plays DbD. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd willingly give their likenesses to the game but eh. Probably won‚Äôt happen now unless they release a new chapter to coincide with Halloween Kills.
---
Its great. The First episode of the first series is pretty boring as they are just setting everything up, but watch through it, it‚Äôs worth it.
---
That's just how it is in the show. The further down you go into the lab, the more "gross" the place gets with vines and such.
---
I'll bet he'll have to bust through into the real world sort of like how he came through the walls and the ceiling in the Byers house.
---
ThEy WoNt AdD dEmIgOrGoN bEcAuSe EsTeTiCs Of ThE gAmE omegalul
---
So you see people using left behind? More people use the meta perks than other ones tbh.
---
Makes sense, but he's too pure
---
since there are 2 survs = 6 perks, i hope the demo gets 6 perks as well
---
Sup
---
Yeah I run Kindred solely to try preventing this. Few things make me want to just kill myself on the hook more than seeing more than one person crouched and staring at the hook as killer camps me fully in visible aura range. Fucking idiots.
---
Heat
---
Literally who?
---
This seems like manufactured outrage
---
God, I have to play survivor now?
---
.............
---
More so curious on the people saying that  the demogorgon wouldn't be a killer and what they think now rather then people raging about a "kids shows" being in dbd
---
So what, we talkin' about a slap on the ass or?
---
It's not, the picture on the right is completely different from the picture on the left. In the show the upper levels of the lab look like the left, and the lower levels look like the right. So we're probably getting another multi-level indoor map
---
bruh what no
---
So happy to have watched the show and couldn‚Äôt be happier to have it added in-game. Might be the first DLC I buy
---
With the past disappointments of chapters you should expect people to be doubtful
---
Probably on the 20th or the 27th.
---
If there's a scoops ahoy for steve.
---
This is a game changer.
---
there are two types of players. normal people. and Scoopys Ahoy Steve.
---
Friendship with Laurie ended.
---
Friendship with Steve started.
---
My only complaint is that Steve might be SO popular, everyone is going to run him. Can everyone else promise me to use Nancy instead so I can be special with Steve?
---
Laurie and Ash are still alive
---
A Transformation like Pig, but instead of stealth it can get on all fours and move faster at the cost of not being able to attack right away, maybe some wall climbing or something as a utility.
---
Its not, there has been a ton of this over the last few days.
---
kinda teared up looking at this. so stoked brahh
---
It was for a bit with the unintended shadow over the hook, was a decent way to see if killer was circling around. Then they fixed it.
---
She dies in Halloween Resurrection.
---
&gt; Will they both get 3 unique perks and if so will killer side also get 6 perks to even it out?
---
Killers overall have more viable perks right now than survivors, so this is a non-issue
---
Someone didnt read the youtube's video description
---
There's a good portion of the population that actually suffer from Coulrophobia (fear of clowns) and while they wanted it to be a horror game they didn't want to *ACTUALLY* scare people so they wanted to stay away from clowns
---
But then...
---
I don‚Äôt watch Stranger Things. Does the Demogorgon always walk on all fours like in the trailer or is it like the hag?
---
Lmaoooo the one time I played clown I fucking loaded into ormond, spent a whole minute looking for somebody and when I finally did 3 gens popped. Great killer.
---
Says the furry?
---
Never understood people calling bubba hard to play. He is easiest killer out there.
---
Twitter. It‚Äôs a *mess* over there. Between this and not being Friday the 13th, anyway.
---
leaks when
---
Uh.. so we are getting the Demogorgon?
---
How disappointing.
---
you should play before they add dedicated servers, because it'll be unplayable for a while after they release that shit. Especially if you're in Australia or something similar, 150ms ping ahoy!
---
Well I remember some horror podcast kinda thing on YouTube (don't remember what it was called) had Curtis on for a bit and they played dead by daylight, in addition I remember someone posted a tweet of gllner saying he had no idea he had a character in a game.
---
The king is still alive and looking fine.
---
Nice!
---
Extra slap for using the meme incorrectly
---
Eh does both I haven't seen much of it either but most likely will be walking on it's back legs in game
---
...no? Ghost Face exposes people
---
Humanoid but non human, or at least I‚Äôd bet as much since I don‚Äôt watch Stranger Things. I don‚Äôt think anyone should really blame the devs for saving work from themselves by keeping the skeletons mostly similar since their work is already cut out for them - no need to add to the pile.
---
&gt;Two survivors who actually look like the actors, BHVR is out here spending coin!!!
---
Meanwhile some people on reddit still complaining about skins. Go figure.
---
please have good perks and a fun power
---
im happy we got the demogorgon instead of billy
---
So I'm guessing this opens the door for nonhuman killers like werewolves, aliens, and other monsters?
---
Please check the Reddit before posting that it is confirmed ffs it's been basically a hour everyone knows I'm not trying to be rude but fff
---
Just because the killers were human at one point, doesn't mean they always have to be  
---
That was a dumb argument from the start. Glad they were proven wrong
---
They've literally gone against their own rule of ''only killers that are human no monsters'' just because Stranger Things is handing out licences lmfao
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nLahrUTxuQ
---
I would assume due o how killer models are created it would be two legs sine most killers use the trappers skeleton to be built around while smaller killers use the Hag's. and since the Demigorgon is T H I C C he might end up using 2 legged skeleton for modelling
---
Im too scared to
---
Didn‚Äôt we just get ghostface? A killer that exposes people.
---
It is literally the biggest non-issue on planet earth
---
*wink wonk*
---
I've played this game maybe a handful of times over the last year but i'm ready to play steve every day. Thanks for bringing me back DBD
---
The realm is the theme of the map. For example the plague's temple map and mother's dwelling are in the same realm (red forest).
---
So... Doctor?
---
You gotta be from the South with a name like Wheeler, lol.
---
And everyone has already forgotten Carl the cashier.
---
Shame, shame on you!
---
If your gonna talk shit at least spell out everything
---
I‚Äôm the one who posted it LMAO
---
Doctor with range
---
I just wrote the same shit xD fuck all the nonbelievers!
---
totally forgot about him!!
---
Yep the perfect organism sorry lol. This game has me saying killer a lot more these days
---
Oh I wasn't trying to sound rude, I was just saying playing low tiers is fun for other people...
---
I meant 6 as in 6 potential ***Survivor*** perks, should have phrased that differently.
---
Demogorgon. We have no clue on the ability but we think it's like old Freddy but more interactive and good. Basically other dimension with alot of black stuff in it consuming the other earth is where it lives.
---
Yipeee
---
I refuse to believe this because I swear to god I only get the same 2 maps total.
---
‚úã‚úã‚úã
---
Excatly and if they can nail the vagina face of the demigorogon xenomorph skull shouldn't be terribly hard
---
I will spend any amount of money to have that as one of his outfits in game
---
Friendship ended with Feng. 
---
Now Nancy is my best friend.
---
someone's sad they don't know how to use spine chill :(
---
I'm just joking man, it's all good  
---
I didn't think we'd get it either, honestly
---
If they actually nerfed the xenomorph to be able to be a DBD killer it probably wouldn‚Äôt even be a xenomorph at that point
---
People are wrong when they say dbd isn't art
---
Give me a second my post got deleted
---
I mean... That's why they are called meta perks. You see many people use "overwhelming presence" or "coulrophobia"? Each side has perks that aren't used as much as others. But in my honest opinion I feel like killers are forced to use certain perks more than survivors are. My Ash has all perks right now and I can pick many more combinations in order to win while as a killer hex:Ruin is a must and many others come close to being that sort of perk.
---
you fucking dumbass
---
(verbal slap no hard feelings)
---
This didn't age well...
---
You sound like a hypocrite
---
This is your teammates folks. If he personally decides there's no chance of winning, he's just gonna let you die on the hook! I mean, fuck you right? /s. This community is ass
---
Lol nah I was born and raised in the Midwest, Chicago to be specific. 
---
I‚Äôm 25 and this is the first time anyone has acknowledged my name as being southern. That was a good one lol
---
Here's hoping they don't fuck it up, this could really solidify myself and I know others into playing DBD more regularly
---
Same here. I watched a few episodes of season 1 and quickly lost interest. May have to give it another shot.
---
Thats an F for u my dude.
---
doesn't really matter though since survivors are basically skins once you get the teachables. Killers are tied to unique powers that take a lot more time/effort/budget to create and are higher quality than survivors.
---
*Hag slap*
---
Hello other fellow gay person. I respect your opinion but I disagree with it.
---
Stop Jojos cringe
---
He didn‚Äôt make that... it was just anounced in an official dbd stream
---
Ight you win the argument, have a nice day mate.
---
Completely forgot those exist. We got new status effects added recently called Undetectable which is basically any stealth killer ability and Oblivious which  is no terror radius sound and not being considered in their terror radius for any perks that activate around that
---
But not his art
---
People are really struggling to get what you have spelled out for like 3 comments in a row lol.
---
And ashy bits in the air
---
Will i be the only one who is a little bit disappointed that this DLC wasn't a classic horror film content update?
---
I have faith in the devs. Sure they‚Äôve fucked up in the past, but they‚Äôve also been doing really good work as of recent, and I‚Äôm sure this‚Äôll carry over into Archives.
---
Baby? That thing is full grown up mate D:
---
***Watch the show***
---
Exactly how most people looked thinking we were gonna get the slit mouth girl as a killer.
---
https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/The_Demogorgon
---
^ That might help.
---
I‚Äôm not happy about the Demogorgon being killer (how is it a slasher? How does it fit the theme?) but stoked about Steve.
---
I am conflicted.
---
You have excellent points, however, (and this is just a suggestion) perhaps the devs could ‚Äúdisguise‚Äù or ‚Äúdress up‚Äù the hooks to make it look like a nesting site or cocoon. This would add realism. I would further suggest they actually do use a ‚Äútail strike‚Äù ability which lets you hit from a bit further from the survivor. Maybe if they tiered it, upon reaching tier 3 it would be an instant down similar to MM.
---
As far as Alien lore goes, the one in Isolation was a drone that relied on stealth. I would suggest they use a ‚Äúdumber‚Äù variant such as the warrior. That way they could explain away why it‚Äôs not automatic death if it finds you? Just a thought. And yes I‚Äôm obsessed with the Alien mythos haha.
---
Hey man, "The Perfect Killer" is probably true too.
---
God I hope so. I'm so excited for the archives if the single player challenges rumour is true, that'll be amazing
---
CHILLS!!!!! FUCKING CHILLS!!!!! YES!!!!!!
---
I never thought I'd see the day I put Jake away. Bring on the hair!
---
Personally as someone who plays Overwatch consistently, imo that's not even fun anymore. The game is no longer casual (if not losing its casual appeal and feeling) due to the Overwatch League and increased competitiveness that bleeds into quick play.
---
That makes total sense though.
---
very weak ability
---
I think another game tried that with this concept and It didn't do so well, I believe it was called, "Evolve"
---
On a global scale yes. But we are on this game's reddit. Discussing (see the flare?) something that could (or maybe already is) be a great problem in the future of this game.
---
Can Dwight get a skin for the science teacher? Please?
---
Name checks out!
---
ill slap your pecks ;)
---
these 2 are different corridors
---
Have you listened to it with audio or has the joke just gone over your head?
---
I hope they have a different hook mechanic for the demigorgon. It's gonna look wierd having an alien monster carry someone to hooks.
---
I understand why it would be difficult to get JLC but Kyle Gallner is not a big name, I don‚Äôt think it would be difficult to negotiate that with him/his agent.
---
Wait its confirmed?
---
why would they share perks though?
---
Alexei deserved his cherry slurpee
---
Hell, the [leaked soundtrack for it ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/comments/ci2q5u/sound_file_leaked_upcoming_archive_soundtrack/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) has got me pumped already.
---
It was basically confirmed by the leaks but somehow the demogorgon wasn't which was surprising considering what they did with ghostface. The survivors got leaked because uh Matheiu may have followed some of the actors
---
I think he is much more than a asshole.
---
Ghostface is mid tier at least. I want him good too but my train of thought was last 2 killers have been good so this one probably will be. Just don't start crying until PTB. THEN you can start. Like I said the chapter just got announced.
---
[Everyone acting surprised about the reveal like](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/023/180/notsurprisedkirk.jpg)
---
OOF
---
Ah, makes sense. To be fair, I'm sure a majority of the population is also freaked out about being chased by inhuman things with giant knives, so I can see why they eventually changed their mind on that.
---
seems like theyre going off season 1 so ill fill u in a little bit.
---
* name of killer: Demogorgon. in the show hes not like a "killer" like how the other killers are in the game hes kind of like a wild animal but an alien from another dimension. he hunts and kills for survival no real pleasure nut for sure a foe to be reckoned with as he was basically bulletproof in s1.  
---
* abilities - so he can teleport between dimensions; our world and the upside down. the upsode down is a copy of our world but its all dark, cold, twisted, evil and home to other creatures not of our dimension. hes super strong and hunts like a wolf. he can sense when blood has been shed.
---
thats all off the top of my head hopes that helps!
---
**BHVR, holding the demogorgon:** Behold! I've brought you a man
---
where was this then i needed it
---
I should clarify: By non human killer, I mean a killer that is or used to be human in the past eg. Hag, Freddy, Nurse, even plague is rotten but still considered human... Non human killer means killers like Alien, you know a "beast".
---
There is a lot of potential for xenomorphs in dbd. Facehuggers and cocooning aside, it still would be pretty silly seeing a xenomorph having to hit some nerds twice and put them into the cocoon whereas in movies and games it just does it straight away. But a man can dream amirite? Maybe the xenomorph could force a whole new game play style
---
It's not trying to be very scary, it's basically horror for people who are normally too scared to watch proper horrors, it's done pretty well to be inclusive to most audiences.
---
And you have an unhealthy amount of intelligence within you. Perhaps you should get that looked at. Because unless you're underage, which tbh i wouldn't even be slightly surprised by your attitude and pure idiocy that you were, i haven't spoken of children at all.
---
You do realise, that one hit addond are considered subjective fun, too? Because what you suggested doesn't mean you can't have fun as overpowered douche.
---
Well xenomorphs keep some prey alive for their face hugging brethren. So I could see it working!
---
This gave me a mental picture of the entity setting up an ICU with medical equipment to keep Rin alive in some twisted Source Code kind of way
---
Now I‚Äôm curious what the Demogorgons bio will look like.. considering we don‚Äôt know much about it except it‚Äôs from the upside down
---
I haven't played in a year. 
---
I'm coming back for Steve.
---
BABYSITTER CRITTER HITTER!!
---
look at the picture ( if you go to the top of this subreddit you get a link to the trailer)
---
Pretty sure GF was a make up for Ash
---
Oh I'm not crying just a little worried as they seem to have a period of doing good then drop kicking the next thing in the nuts with a fat nerf. I'm hopeful though
---
if you please
---
I think the killer is going to have a freddy dreamworld power along with a stance change from four legged to bipedal. So he‚Äôs just a fast boi.
---
With Vsync if it is even 1 FPS below 60 it drops you to 30 so I'd guess that on whatever settings/resolution you're using that you were very close to 60 FPS so that's why you are seeing 60 now. 
---
You could open task manager while the game is running and see what your GPU and CPU usages are at with your current settings, and if you're trying to play on Ultra or High my guess is the GPU is maxed out. So you could try medium or low. I prefer using Low, I really dislike the higher settings even medium though I'm able to use them if I want, and I've tried but I just hate them and love low. 
---
If you really want to use the higher settings then the easiest solution is to lower your resolution but don't use the in-game resolution scale or auto-adjust settings to do this they don't look or work very well. By far the best and easiest way is just change your desktop to a lower resolution before starting the game and pick one that uses the same aspect ratio as you're using now so it doesn't look weird or stretched out.
---
oh yeah? please tell me what makes you say that
---
Predator... visions of all sorts, plasma caster, mines, spears, claws, insane strength, cloaking tech, much more.... Either he or his add-ons would be OP. He has to be insanely nerfed...
---
I too desire attention
---
This wasn't a bone splinter bubba was it?
---
You are a remarkably dramatic person. A difference in number of perks
---
**does not fucking matter and never will**
---
Gonna have to be a Steve main after this, this looks awesome
---
The things we do for love
---
It's cool man
---
Who knows, we might get flayed billy in another update like that as well
---
Oh wow, i thought it was fanmade
---
But credit to this sub their have been some really convincing fanarts around
---
Yeah, never would've gotten the Pig if that was true
---
just saying, the devs never once said "human only" they said "humanoid only" heck, the hag and the spirit both also exist, that are somewhat more monsterous with inhuman movements.
---
Billy and Huntress mains in shambles
---
This one wasn't leaked though? This was genuinely a very welcome surprise for once
---
It's ok we forgive you. Now let's go to Vegas and party like it's the 80's and giant monsters are trying to eat us.
---
accurate lmfao
---
im talking about the people who still thought it wasnt coming to the game despite all the clues
---
This looks amazing, congrats to BHVR for this monumental partnership.
---
I don‚Äôt like stranger things, how and why did the trailer make me shout in excitement?
---
Micheal Myers was known for his bad manners, wasnt he
---
Sunflower as survivor, then Wall-Nut as a Thicc survivor.
---
Ok, what do we do when he kills only flashlight wielding survivors? Remember they don't seem to kill unarmed+cowards. No pride abd not a good trophy to collect...
---
My ranting aside it'd be really cool if he was added ^^
---
Heres hoping for Scoops Ahoy costumes..
---
Dont worry, this whole community is cunts.
---
Lol this is where im stuck too. Oh well, leveling both then
---
nice
---
I'm just a nuclear powerplant in games apparently
---
What if they say the leviatan is the entity??
---
The demogorgen is not human.
---
Well ur job is put me there so...
---
Makes us wait 30 mins for it
---
Just for a 46 second trailer
---
Then the stream ends and they upload the trailer (46 second version) anyway
---
&gt; What?! More viable perks?!
---
Yes, killers have a greater number of viable perks than survivor. This is a fact. 
---
I can say the same thing about survivor.
---
Just because almost all killers **and** survivors use the same 6 perks does not mean that in the overall pool that killers have more perks that are viable
---
both of those rules are already broken by the demogorgon?
---
I've been screaming "OH SHIT OH SHIT OHH SHITTT" FOR THE LAST 10 MINS OH YM FUVKIJGNFHSHHS
---
&gt;I think it would be great if we could have some in-game stats for both survivor and killer. These could be split into categories for example:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Survivor:  
---
&gt;\-Total Games and games as each individual survivor  
---
&gt;\-Lightbringer: avg emblem, total no of gens repaired, avg no of gens repaired per game - same for doors unlocked and (hex) totems  
---
&gt;\-Unbroken: avg emblem, total number of times escaped, % escaped  
---
&gt;\-Benevolent: avg emblem, total no of heals, avg number of heals per game - same for unhooks, escaping killer's grasp, bodyblocking  
---
&gt;\-Evader: avg emblem, total no of chases, % of which you have won, avg chase time, total no of pallet stuns, pallet stuns per game  
---
&gt;Killer:  
---
&gt;\-Total Games and games as each individual killer  
---
&gt;\-Gatekeeper: avg emblem, avg no of gens remaining at the end of a game (you can have detailed stats like how many games you completed with 5,4,3,2,1 or none)  
---
&gt;\-Devout: avg emblem, total no of sacrifices, no of sacrifices per game - same for kills, disconnects and bleedouts (here we can also have more detail like with the previous one by including the number of games with 4K, 3K, 2K, 1K or none)  
---
&gt;\-Malicious: avg emblem, no of hits, avg per game - same for hooks  
---
&gt;\-Chaser: avg emblem, total no of chases, % of which you have won, avg chase time  
---
&gt;All these could be separated into maps and so there would be an indication of which maps favor survs/killers which would be interesting to know and so that the devs can work on certain maps if there's evidence that one side is doing considerably better than the other  
---
&gt;Also for average emblem we could have something like Silver I,II,III which would also show how close to the next emblem you are.  
---
&gt;This is just an idea that would be really cool in my opinion because I always wanted to see just how good I'm doing at the game and since I don't play that often to get to the top ranks I don't really have a clear indication of my skill level. I honestly think rank resets should happen less often because you do need a lot of hours to get to a decent rank and when you do the rank reset brings you back down a lot. There could be a system where you lose your rank if you are inactive for some time but you get some "placement matches" at a rank similar to that where you left off, maybe a bit lower, to get you back into the game.  
---
&gt;Now, along with this system we could have a general ranking for survivors and killers where you can compare your performance to the current player base by looking at average stats or your ranking overall.  
---
&gt;I hope you upvote this if you would like to see it in the game :)
---
I enter my steamid64 and it doesn't let me see my own stats wth
---
I know. There are a lot of reasons why it is questionable to go outside the sentient human groups for more monstrous and animalistic characters. A lot of people would like to see it more but I can see why it‚Äôs limited.
---
I'm really curious what the power for the Demogorgon might be...  Maybe disabling active gens or something?
---
I guess it would be the Demagorgan from season 1 if they were going to do one. My guess on abilities would have something to do with portals on the map for the "upside down" or some sort of possession ability. Since possession ability seems like it wouldn't really fit, I'd say it's ability would be to set portals that both the killer and survivors can go through, but there has to be some downside to survivors using the portal. Like they are revealed or they are damaged or something. Either that or they have to close the portals to stop the killer from using them. I'd prefer the killer can place portals and then survivors can cleanse them like totems. This will help deal with gen rush because if the survivors leave the portals up the killer can have some crazy map pressure forcing them off gens to do portals. 
---
As far as perks I'd say something like 
---
Parasitic Insight: You become obsessed with one survivor, hitting this survivor reveals them to you whenever they perform actions such as healing gens totems etc. all other survivors within a 5/10/15 meter radius are also revealed. Effect goes away upon healing
---
Add ons would be something like
---
Portal Keeper: Your portals take 1.75x, 2.0x, 2.25x longer to close
---
I could think up more later but I should probably get back to work...
---
No? Why the hell would they?
---
It's already implemented by the engine, so no code necessary, just some map design setup.
---
they literally just released the trailer
---
1 seems accurate
---
2 not so much..plague is a thing
---
POGGERS
---
Insane. I want the perks and I want them now.
---
I posted a meme just like this a couple days ago
---
Yee I remember you guys. We had some fun :)
---
Cause most of the characters in DBD have either died or gone mysteriously missing.
---
It‚Äôs in like every Bio..
---
Because fnaf
---
I mean having kids in a game and them getting brutally murdered might be bad for PR...
---
give me scoops ahoy steve or give me death.
---
also toxic learn to play noob one trick killer
---
I imagined something like having portals around the map where he can swap between the normal world and the UD. It‚Äôd be cool if he could somehow pull people into the UD, and was stronger there, although they could escape back through portals.
---
Mettle of man took a month or two to be nerfed. Not before it even came out. And no, killers are not the only ones to be nerfed. But they do get nerfed the fastest. DS took over a year and a hakf to be nerfed for example even though the killer community exclaimed their problems with the perk. Legion was a problem (mechanically) and they fixed it 2 months later and even started banning people for using the infinite emnd build yet no one was banned for using the sprint burst on command bug.
---
I want a killer that drags people to hooks, it would be brutal
---
Is there anything that won‚Äôt be leaked ? Lol
---
Right?! I hope that‚Äôs the sound that plays when you queue as Demogorgon
---
I don‚Äôt understand, how does the doc do this? I understand bubba or myers, but doc?
---
This didnt age well
---
Im not gonna lie, them trying to get someone‚Äôs attention on the camera makes me pretty sad.
---
It'll just be the morph
---
Literally my story in DBD
---
So de finaly get to kill children in dbd?
---
[AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhHhH](/intensifies)   
---
(I had no idea this was happening, I'm beyond excited).
---
I think Nancy/Steve is going to be the way of Legion. You get the default (probably Nancy)  and you buy the second one like its a cosmetic.
---
Xenomorph would be hard considering part of their shtick is crawling on ceilings but there's so many outdoors maps. I definitely love that this opens the game up to new possibilities of killers though, the theory crafting is going to be through the roof
---
Ohh, so that's what you meant! Then it was my bad, sorry. Thought you were talking about the ingame models not looking as bad as Quentin's when you said "Quentin's treatment". Hopefully they'll look nice now that they have the licenses for them. I mean, Ash looks fairly decent tbh. It won't be a graphic miracle, but if they at least look better than Quentin's model then it's a win for them lol.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/csiewz/remember_when_everybody_cried_that_there_wont_be/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I mean the Demogorgan is technically humanoid, meaning looks like a human being.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôll fuck up the lore! I personally decide what is compliant with the game‚Äôs cannon and while the supernatural is fine, it aliens are just too far of a stretch. It‚Äôs my decision that in a horror genre, aliens do not make sense in any capacity!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúOmg these asshole survivors just let me die on hook!!!!1‚Äù  
---
‚ÄúFFS, JUST LET ME DIE ON HOOK AND SAVE YOURSELF, IDIOT‚Äù
---
I am happy that the survivors are Nancy and Steve, but come on, where is my man Dustin???
---
I‚Äôm not a fan of stranger things but I‚Äôm still interested to see the new chapter.
---
You were probably being toxic yourself.
---
(Bitchslaps you into next week.) Just announced for september sorry.
---
Yep, because there totally isn't a clown or religious killer in the game, this is the first time behaviour has done that, so triggered, REEEE
---
i think they meant for survivors but yeah this isn't very clear
---
In no movies other than TCM do any of the killers put anyone on hooks though. Most of the killers kill the victims right away anyhow.
---
Lol why would they use fucking Barb. There are literally 25 chars who are more marketable and have bigger followins than her.
---
Yea I don't think we'll get alot of new players considering well this community is very new player unfriendly. Especially since alot of people derank and are toxic.
---
This was me too, I'm glad I was wrong though, this opens up so many doors now!
---
Wow... The Blood splatters look amazing
---
I wonder how they'll handle hooks. Seems odd for the Demogorgon to put survivors on hooks. Perhaps it'll be like the Demogorgon puts them in a weird cocoon thing. I wonder just how much extra effort the devs are gonna put in to make this really make sense. I mean I don't care either way really but it'd be cool.
---
I knew there was a good chance that Stranger Things would be the new chapter but up until then I kinda preferred to have an original chapter, but after seeing the trailer, the map and the killer, I'm excited for the map, how the devs will handle the killer and the new perks that will come
---
The fact that there is a new map doesn't change the cost since they are available to everybody.
---
The fact that there is 3 character on the other hand... maybe.
---
It is a little frustrating that they spent a lot of money on licensing but there‚Äôs still a ton of bugs to fix lol
---
I'm just worried because of battle pass's in other games.
---
Pretty sure Nea was our first non-human killer.
---
Hmm... What about Freddy? He isn't exactly human anymore, and he has already been touched by the supernatural.
---
HOLY SHITTTTT, I NEVER WATCHED Stranger Things tho, but this looked Dope!!
---
*laughs in devour hope*
---
I mean for meme builds yeah you could use other perks and combinations. And some killers don‚Äôt need hex ruin I think, like nurse ie killers with map pressure, but that has nothing to do with survivors having more perks than killers.i think you should look at who has better perks rather than how many each have.
---
Edit: I forgot to mention; Most Xenomorphs exist for the sole purpose of procreating and expanding the species. 
---
This ‚Äúkiller‚Äù actually would make sense since xenomorphs avoid humans with weapons. Seeing as how all survivors are unarmed it would make decent-enough sense that the xeno could run around hitting twice before hooking/hiving at its leisure because it knew there was no imminent danger and it wouldn‚Äôt have to insta-kill on discovery. Just another thought to keep the conversation rolling. I‚Äôm loving all your guys ideas and counter-points too!
---
they were probably just playing the game??? killers do shit like this unprovoked
---
What may be cool is there be 3 entrances on the map that enter and exit the upside down. Survivors in the upside down can't interact with survivors outside of the upside down. Survivors who are downed and hooked are placed in the upside down. To save a survivor one must enter the upside down to do so. The killer can switch between the upside down and the real world at will after a short channeling process. While in the upside down the killer is invisible but survivors are to the killer as well. You can still hear the survivors while in the upside down. When the killer attempts to switch between realms the survivors can hear screeching sounds within proximity. While in the upside down the killer can not interact with generators besides with a special ability either. While in the upside down the killer's terror radius is dramatically reduced and survivors outside the upside down will not be able to be alerted to the killer at all until it crosses over. In the upside down the killer has increased movement speed. 110% up to 115%. In the upside down the killer can coat a generator. Causing it to malfunction until a survivor enters the upside down to cleanse the corruption from there. Malfunctioning generators will cause every skill check to become a Considerably Difficult skill check and cause 5% regression if missed. No benefit to hitting thre skill check. The killer can contaminate up to 3 generators with a 40 second cool down between uses. 
---
Just the ideas I've had....lol
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt disconnect. I was pretty sure he was going to get annoyed just by waiting. I went and did some stuff around the house
---
Just play as Sexy Torb assuming you have this years summer skin hes also a pain for Sigma who's in every game now so torb won't be out of place :D
---
Believe it or not, we pretty regularly get new players, especially on release of liscensed content.
---
Well, behaviour said before they all were human, which is why people said that. Looks like behaviour sold out again lol
---
The first scenario I was more mad about being sandbagged so the duo could save themselves. The second scenario, I wanted them to stop giving the killer a free 4k.
---
Op sounds like they should find the hatch before getting clapped
---
I don't think Demogorgon or even a Werewolf or Vampire or anything kind of like that ruins the lore at all, but an alien is too much dude
---
what does BM mean
---
I‚Äôm hoping they bring a lovers type perk. I‚Äôll elaborate on what I mean. I came up with a concept a while ago for a type of perk that would sit aside obsession perks and hex perks. They would partner two survivors and if it was a survivor perk, it would give benefits for working together, and if it were a killers perk, it would give negatives for working together.
---
Yo isn't that the fortnite guy
---
Now that would be an exciting killer
---
I‚Äôm so sad that you‚Äôre wrong.
---
We'll find him cocooned in the Upside Down, he's a secret 3rd survivor. Carry him to the end of the game like a lantern or the gnome in Left 4 Dead to unlock him lmao
---
Now this looks interesting
---
Or very very excited.
---
Demogorgon was human, the upside down is an alt universe where the mindflayer took over and they tried to nuke it but everything went to shit and humans were corrupted and turned into demogorgons.
---
No better reason to return exists.
---
well the Hag is like 5ft tall and the Demogorgon is kinda like 8 if this is in the matter.
---
Just harder to find gens.
---
Some lads forgot about "humanoid" being a word
---
Move aside Meggy, Nancy is my new main now
---
#JusticeForBarb
---
Damn whatttt. Its really gonna happen?!
---
And predator and Arnold Schwarzenegger Lol üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
yikes man, try harder next time, maybe you'll succeed
---
&gt; Since there are 3 new character, does this mean we‚Äôre getting 9 new perks or will Steve and Nancy share the same perks?
---
I'm going to go out on a limb and say I think they're going to be skins like Legion. It's not going to be two different options in the menu (so they'll share the same perks.)
---
Or a werewolf.
---
The right play is to unhook him well enough to get a safe unhook, then when they get hooked again, farm the muthafucker and *then* get hatch
---
lol i cannot believe they took your words out of context when its so obvious what you're saying
---
I do need to get back into the game, I unintentionally went on hiatus so that I could play Splatoon 2‚Äôs final splatfest and try out the new stuff on Overwatch
---
Like Legion
---
The Archives was announced in the Anniversary livestream. Essentially, it‚Äôs a way of expanding the lore of the game and its characters whilst also providing more things for players to do between chapter releases. It‚Äôs basically a battlepass (which may not sound too good- initially, that was my reaction too, but I‚Äôve kinda warmed to the idea).
---
I‚Äôm buying Nancy the moment this comes out, love her so much. Same with Steve, ESPECIALLY if we get the scoops ahoy costume.
---
Well. Time to finally bite the bullet and watch this damn show.
---
This has been the worst trade deal in the history of trade deals, maybe ever.
---
[Steve, staring at the poster for The Evil Dead in the Byers' house, looking at Ashley J. Williams]: what
---
Someone said they confirmed it's two seperate survivors with seperate perks on twitter.
---
Amazing. You need to watch it. It's such a good series
---
This opens new opportunities for alien, predator, ripley and.... Arnold, just kidding but alien would be bad ass
---
he's probably a fucking normie
---
It says 2 new survivors a new map and a new killer it is the biggest dlc pack for the biggest crossover üòé
---
60 continuous seconds of chase, or 60 seconds total (like pebble)? Because if it's like pebble, nope. And if it isn't, killers will counter by simply losing chase before 60 seconds is up.
---
Resurrection isn't like Mettle, Mettle blocks a hit of any type, it doesn't bring someone back from the dead. Now, if Resurrection doesn't allow you to escape, just allows you to help teammates for 60 seconds, that's fine (but a worthless perk imo).
---
Gang seems like it needs to be tied to Exhaustion perks to be balanced.
---
Think of it this way, it opens the door for classic horror monsters to be killers like Pumpkinhead or Fluffy from Creepshow.
---
they didnt say there was a roof!! /s
---
That's true... Not to praise myself or anything but I really liked the idea of a Anti-flashlight perk that does more than just increase how long it takes to be blinded and how long you're blinded for.
---
Maybe it could work like a Token system like some kind of Hex perk?
---
Something like "Each time you're stunned or blinded by a flashlight you get a token."?
---
Meh, Probably sounds too familiar to "Devour hope"
---
Dont they go missing because the entity takes them though?
---
Nancy and Steve are both post High School aka at least 18 as of Season 3. So they're adults.
---
lmao. it's handheld dbd tho!
---
I'd be down with a Killer that can climb walls, so long as doing so forces the Killer to commit to the command (they can't cancel or reverse it). Having said that, the Xenomorph would need a unique way to sacrifice its catches to the Entity, as I believe the Demogorgon will have as well. Having unique ways to sacrifice survivors is going to be required in order to branch out to more feral Killers.
---
Would Steve and Nancy share perks? Or will they be like legion and share skins one slot but you could be Steve or Nancy type deal? Or will we get 6 new survivor perks?
---
Imagine what a trip it'd be moving through the fog and coming across an old Bruce Campbell claiming to be Ash Williams yet not acting like the Ash Williams you know (Evil dead 2 came out in 87 and army of darkness was 92) Wild.

Or bill lol.
---
I know it‚Äôs small, but I really hope the music from ST makes its way into DbD. I absolutely love the intro soundtrack from the series.
---
I dont care. Stranger things is for fucking chuds like yourself,
---
Asking the real questions.
---
I love horror movies and games, but having watched Alien at the ripe old age of 5 the xenomorph has a special place in the dark recesses of my mind. I sometimes forget how much it horrified me. During those bouts of forgetfulness I'll reinstall Isolation. 
---
I'll make it past to tutorial, watch that first xenomorph unfurl from the ceiling vent, hear it's breathing as it creeps around and promptly uninstall the game after the first time it kills me.
---
I know but the fact it‚Äôs a bitch to get and I feel like a chump for not using it don‚Äôt know if you noticed I‚Äôm not that good at this game
---
It could be like the older lores in the game where it's really short like two paragraphs.
---
Or it could be like Freddy's where it doesn't really delve into the lore at all and instead has like two sentences giving a brief overview before going into *how* they were taken by the Entity
---
Wow, who could've guessed this? \^/\^s
---
This happened to me on console I'm pretty sure it's just another DBD bug
---
Yes exactly, the one player in the game who actualy relies heavily on latency, will now have to deal with that shit. And on top of that now you get not 1/6th of the playerbase who can potentially cheat and/or lagswitch, but instead it's possible that EVERYONE on this game cheats :) a.k.a you will have 6x as many cheaters/lagswitchers. Also because EAC is pure trash and can be circumvented by a 10 year old that knows how to google MPGH
---
Pretty sure they said they wont do decapitations, sadly
---
Okay I see. They said no to werewolves too but they were human and classed as monsters to them unless I was told wrong.
---
I do that to whoever sees my hex totem.
---
Well chunky is a toy and people want it badly
---
LOL
---
When was this confirmed?
---
IMO Freddy's teleport should have been saved for the Demogorgon (unless the Demogorgon has some teleport of his own), but I feel like that power/animation would be perfect for it
---
Because they only had three gens done and the hatch wouldn't have appeared until one of them (specifically OP) died.
---
Step aside citizen, this is official police work.
---
I'm wondering how it's going to work since the speed of them is way faster tha  115%
---
I‚Äôm so looking forward to getting ‚Äúplant‚Äù camped üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Hell yeah BVHR this is all solid progress ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
"be a great problem in the future" is absolutely dramatic lmfao foh
---
&gt; And I do not agree with your opinion that killers have more viable perks than survivors.
---
I have a job, but I will prove it to you later
---
I'm so happy the devs aren't sticking with sick humans, we need creatures too that would freak the fuck out of us just looking at them, i'm so happy
---
i hope in the future we get more creatures to terrify us rather than just basic killing humans
---
same. i was really hoping it would be Alexei or Hopper ;-;
---
Interesting. I‚Äôm always down for more lore. I used to read all the wiki pages for the characters before I got the game
---
Welp so far for fixing the game and not releasing more broken fucking killers. I'm actually done, it's also licensed again so the money can keep rolling, fucking pay2win trashgame with shitty developers who only focus on money and not on fixing their game.
---
I'm wondering how it'll work lore wise. All the killers are chosen for passion and other strong emotions. This boi, for all, we know it's no smarter than a dog
---
Again, I will prove it to you later. Get ready
---
Its the Golden Ace cosmetic iirc, not a Tru3 myself but I think thats what he calls it
---
you believe a test server's ping to be representative? also: *pRopEr NeTcoDe*
---
You can get arrested for that.
---
Does anyone know typically how long it takes for the dlc to come out after the announcment trailer like this is released?
---
Tru3 viewer**
---
Why only to mains tho?
---
All really good questions tbh
---
Dee bee dee. lol
---
a car horn. dee bee dee dee dee bee
---
Same, time for Nea to go. Urban Evasion Steve (or Nancy?) rise up!
---
Oh I see. Sorry, I misunderstood. Yeah they could do a vine one BUT for ages the hooks aren't specific to the killer anymore
---
I don't know if you've watched the show, but in their early stage they look a little like dogs and walk exclusively on four legs
---
Happy as heck knew the second we got that obvious tweet from DBD with Stranger things fan art. When I watched the trailer / whatever prior to this picture I was even happier when I saw  NANCY AND STEVEN BOTH OF EM BITHCES. I thought we'd only get Steve or Hopper but nahhh fam they outdid themselves good af NANCY in the house too god I'm gasming too hard
---
So we're getting Another Indoor map?
---
Awesome
---
I don't want to be the first to say it but RIP to Huntress mains again
---
"I went to public highschool" holy shit the cringe, just shut the fuck up lmfao
---
Great now I have to find a new pair of pants to wear after I just creamed these ones.
---
it can be but once you play a lot you realize they're in the same few places
---
I think ‚Äúsecond chance‚Äù perks are fine. Since when you‚Äôre dead.. you‚Äôre dead and out the game, and most of them have counter play. Unbreakable don‚Äôt slug. DS don‚Äôt tunnel. Deliverance makes you broken. Adrenaline is only activated once the gates are open so. I would say you only need ruin on killers with no map pressure, bbq isn‚Äôt required but it does give you information. Killers have quite a few decent perks too.
---
Oh Jesus christ
---
Don't know if he counts as a "creature", but I'd love to see Pennywise in the game
---
Rip my Acey Boi
---
Might have the power to do all 4 legs tho. Might be too much like legion tho to balance it. I hope the demogorgan comes out the gate like Freddy's rework; upside down timer, and a power that's player controlled.
---
I really wish they would've  used the mall instead of the underground  lair.
---
I heard somewhere that sloppy butcher breaks through borrowed time and mettle of man is that true?
---
I feel like DS is different because of how long ago it came out. Back then when they came out with stuff they stuck to it no matter how much people hated it. Also legion took a while before he got nerfed. It felt like a month anyone saw legion people just DC.
---
Never said that. We both have our opinions which can neither be wrong nor right. There is just no way to prove the viability of certain perks as some perks are very situational "unbreakable" for example so some people won't see the power of that perk and write it off while others may have very good experiences with it. Or "Hex:devour hope" for example that might be a reaaally powerful perk but will most likely be destroyed before it ever sees use.
---
As cool as it is, the demogorgon is a being from an alternate dimension so if anything the entity from dbd would probably consider it an invader and try to kill it
---
They could get around it with powers plus he's like 7ft xD
---
You‚Äôre such a Meg
---
I never seen the tv show. Guess. I gotta watch it now
---
I‚Äôm all jack up boys! Let‚Äôs go Steve!
---
Way to not fuck up the lore too bad: entity wants more humans so he grabs Nancy and Steve and the demegorgon just follows them
---
Eh I'd prefer a bikini but a one piece is fine
---
It's good, and it's fun to use. You don't need meta perks every game
---
It seems like a missed opportunity if they don‚Äôt
---
No, they said they would be improving the base game before implementing anymore events.
---
IIRC they never said they would cut back on DLC. 
---
Licensed DLC appeals to respective audiences. Someone who loves the NOES franchise would probably love to play as Freddy. It‚Äôs little things like that, that would help a community grow. Think about it, it‚Äôs really not that deep.
---
Goes the other way too. P3 spirit against baby megs and Dweets :(
---
...so we get to perform child murder?
---
Thank you so much!! I'm actually going to sell it once it's done so I hope she'll find a loving home!
---
I would say Pig
---
Cool drill weapon
---
adorable
---
h a t s
---
survivors usually enjoy playing against her if you don't play scummy
---
Surveillance is a great perk and Make Your Choice is an okay perk that can be fun
---
leather mommy outfit
---
tiny roars
---
Damn. ü§£
---
I appreciate that
---
If you like the doc it would be better if you buy it with iridescent shards
---
Can‚Äôt tell if this is sarcastic or not. But yes it‚Äôs evolve and it was pretty trash but I played it quite a bit
---
Yeah, I always feel like Legion is the most realistic (the character, not feral frenzy as a power ;D)
---
It's not worth it replying to that person. It's a relatively young account whose whole purpose is to throw random insults around like an edgy teenager. Just look at the history like ... yikes
---
I'm really trying to put in a lot of details so this means a lot thank you!!
---
If I had to guess, it will most likely be (season 2 spoiler) !&lt;the way the demodog kills Bob. The survivor will be looking around similar to idle animation and it will run from off screen, knocking them down, and chewing on them a bit.
---
I've never seen stranger things but I have to say that new killer in my instant fav looks-wise. Any fans of the show here know what his power might revolve aound?
---
Um... uh... Er... you might wanna check the DbD YouTube channel
---
no u
---
The Saw movies are not slashers, and saying that the villian being a human makes it one is silly. That would make Get Out or The Wicker Man slashers.
---
You're totally right in saying that there have been no inhuman killers yet though.
---
Thank you so much!!
---
*slaps*
---
Season 4 or 5 will be the final season of ST according to the creators. I think it's 4.
---
Anyway, lore wise, this could take place after the show ends.
---
Or it could be an alternate timeline/universe.
---
We won't know for sure until we see their bios.
---
I feel like I'm gonna see a bunch of stevey bois
---
That's such a good idea :O
---
Nancy best girl! (Pre S3 anyway)
---
Had the pleasure of meeting her actress at a convention after season 1 dropped a few years ago
---
I agree with this. If it‚Äôs more because there is more content, I‚Äôm game. Maps don‚Äôt count, obviously. But if ghostface was cheaper because there was NO survivor (but... ‚Äúchapter‚Äù?) then I‚Äôm down for paying a bit more for more actual content.
---
The official DBD discord has a Looking For Group section where you can do SWF with people
---
They‚Äôre promoted as two separate characters unlike the Legion so I‚Äôd guess two survivors with 3 separate perks.
---
honestly you just gotta get lucky
---
Thanks for the answer. Looking forward to it as long as it doesn't create a P2W aspect and is mainly cosmetic.
---
Would hate for "free to play" players to not be able to access Battlepass-only perks and items/addons ect.
---
Nancy mains unite. Sorry meg
---
(Between you and me I‚Äôm doing it because it‚Äôs fun watching them throw a tantrum at such a small thing)
---
We upside down now!
---
+ cells for cosmetics too maybe
---
Too true! I'm still excited to play as them and I 100% understand that Nancy and Steve are a bigger draw for potential new players than the other character I suggested.
---
9 perk chapter hype.
---
Are there now actually some kids in DbD? Though the devs wanted everyone to be 21 or older
---
Kinda wish it was Billy instead, I like the human killers theme they‚Äôve had so far
---
HONESTLY, I‚Äôm so happy too because Steve Harrington is a new survivor. god this is amazing
---
It's been confirmed lol
---
maybe one of the demogorgons abilities will be like when it shrieks all survivors heart beats will be disabled for a certain amount of time
---
H E N D E R S O N
---
Yes and no. Not much coding for the cameras on the game that show a still image rather than a live feed, take a bit of coding to add a live feed
---
Like all animals, humans can be bribed to obey, or forced into submission. The Entity's realm has no concept of time, it will wait an eternity for something to give in. The Demogorgon is no different... it can obey and follow orders, when broken into submission.
---
Y‚Äôall think their gonna have a set of perks each or just the same perks?
---
Depends on what time it takes to channel the spell. Still I think that it would too op. Resurrected survivor should have more restrictions, like "unnable to use any perks" or "has 50% debuff on any action" or "dies 120 seconds after Resurrection"
---
Padded jaws are great. "Hey, I'm willing to lose a lot of pressure and possibly get no kills just for a couple extra bloodpoints. I really respect Trappers running it
---
9 total
---
Well a prominent idea from that season is the "upside down," a sort of dark mirror realm.
---
So I'm thinking something like OG Freddy.
---
It‚Äôs been out for an hour?
---
Nice,thank you
---
You're one of those people that think "mainstream" stuff is bad, aren't you?
---
Hmm, so possibly phase walking somewhere between the wraith and spirit, or maybe they'll finally adapt the Boogeyman idea and have it be able to teleport between lockers. Neat concept from the stranger things team!
---
This made me moister than an oyster.
---
Laurie survived in H20 but died in H:Res.
---
I mean... once all their teachables are unlocked, you‚Äôre not wrong.
---
The only REAL differences are grunt volume, size and breathing volume.
---
And a Predator too maybe? Might be tough to do given the amount of weaponry they have.
---
I would assume its been that way for you guys for a couple of weeks now
---
I too love doctor! But i'm survivor main... because i'm too soft and as a killer, i always end up letting everyone go. So i main Feng xD
---
Dude, chill. People said Freddy would be a stupid killer, people said Ghostface wouldn‚Äôt come because Legion exists; yet they are both in the game and functioning perfectly fine.
---
Yikes, just stop
---
New survivor: Nancy
---
New survivor : Steve
---
New killer: The Demogorgon
---
They are all different characters, legion wasn't advertised as 4 different characters. Maybe they just had a lot of ideas for survivor perks and decided "Why not? We already have  spoiled them with another character in this dlc dlc to helps us pay for the licence since Netflix wanted a fuckton of money, let's just spoil them *EVEN MORE*  with 6 perks"
---
Oh did they verbally say it when talking about the roadmap? Cause the image of the roadmap itself doesn‚Äôt state whether there are 0, 1, or 2+ characters coming per chapter.
---
Why not just team up with Ace mains and be Awesome together?
---
The JoJo fanbase alone makes me never want to watch the show.
---
Whispers, maybe?
---
Sure but what is the retention rate
---
well, being a student in eastern europe it actually is RIP wallet, already spent enough for GF and that devil skin so :D
---
good bot
---
This is so good.
---
Sneaking somewhere on the corner of the map doing anything but gens ...
---
Sorry guys, we have to throw away the whole chapter. One random reddit used dislikes it.
---
It might be vaguely similar to Freddy Krueger‚Äôs? The show involves an alternate universe called the Upside Down, though you travel to it only through specific portals/cracks between worlds. The demogorgon can come out of it, though, so it wouldn‚Äôt be as bad as Freddy‚Äôs? I don‚Äôt know what else they could do.
---
Well, it makes sense if they do so. After all, Xenomorphs are able to transport humans into their hives for you know what (in Cameron's kanon, not in Ridley's) so why won't they obey Entity's commands and transport them to the hook.
---
That‚Äôs fair but I think the Demogorgon is just more iconic
---
Gonna equip Deja Vu for the very first time after new map release.
---
they've already broken the rule of no clowns and no non-humans/aliens, why not go all the way?
---
Freddy is human but got his powers after he died. He got his powers when being burned alive, when he was turned into a spirit of rage and revenge.
---
Rofl this is beyond accurate
---
Interesting idea. It may need a bit more to help it but it‚Äôd be another way to do stealth
---
Season 1 is great! Season 2 is kind of slow, but push through it because season 3 is also great!!
---
I want a 'Game over.' voiceline from the pig when someone dies to a bear trap.
---
Are we ever going to get any unique running animation for different survivors or any sort of graphics update/ different animations in general?
---
My appreciation transcends time
---
exactly, the mall is such a missed opportunity
---
It's in now but the meme is still correct, it doesn't really fit IMO
---
i didn‚Äôt assume everyone played on a console I just didn‚Äôt know hag wasn‚Äôt free. Plus console isn‚Äôt that shitty
---
Thank you, my friend!
---
Never forget Carl.
---
is this for real?
---
Cutie*
---
I‚Äôm so glad you liked it &lt;3
---
This, love this idea!
---
so much for that
---
Also, ghostface doesn‚Äôt have a tragic backstory either lol
---
The definitely go further.  I feel like they also travel slightly faster, which translates into a straighter flight path and less of an arc.
---
Why not just make the post title what you said at the top of the image lol
---
It's the same as huntresses hatchets. Longer holding it in longer it goes
---
P3-50 is like 4-5 million. 1m BP will probably only get you to level 35-40 so good luck trying to max a character in one day. 
---
Even if you had enough shards to buy the perks in the shrine, getting a maxed character in one day would be impossible unless you no life it.
---
YES‚ö°Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüî•
---
I'm thrilled and all but am I the only one who doesn't like indoor maps? They're just kind of annoying to play on
---
FNAF future release?
---
tell me the ability NOWWWWW
---
They said they wanted to stick to humanoid killers, which the Demigorgon still qualifies as.
---
OH YESüî•
---
"Yeah, it's me, don't cream your pants."
---
*spoiler* According to season three the mind flayer might be human and the big monster was gooped up humans so technically it's still human maybe.
---
Also possibly Freddy, since NOES came out in '84 and season 3 of stranger things takes place in '85
---
It‚Äôs not really an error though? Lol being burned alive isn‚Äôt being dead yet. It‚Äôs merely being a case of you being picky about how I phrased it, which is fine, but the information is still the same.
---
I think it was around the time of the murder clown ‚Äúpranks‚Äù that idiots were pulling. Would‚Äôve been in poor taste if they released a clown during that time
---
Pour out some Hazy Reagent for those who wanted Barb as the survivor.
---
Honestly I have mixed feelings. I would be incredibly happy to see Nemesis and any survivor from the franchise added but at the same time, I would be sad to see such an iconic character like Nemesis dumbed down to fit DBDs *Merry-go-round* universe. In RE universe pretty much every "hit" of him was a "mori".
---
Yeah I would‚Äôve preferred a billy killer but we‚Äôll see how this goes.
---
YES‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Seriously! Like I don't care for stranger things and think the show sucks, but i'm still excited for new characters and a new killer.
---
QUICK ACT SURPRISED.
---
Great show. S1 is the best. Absolutely incredible feat of stunning cinematography and writing. Other seasons have been pretty good as well, entertaining stuff.
---
Thank you, my dear!
---
Licensed DLC is real money only.
---
Wow seeing your comments 
---
Who hurt you?
---
I mean she technically does during the Mori as her mouth opens.
---
I wonder if one of the perks will reference his hair... I wonder if the perks will reference DnD
---
I kinda hoped robin would be a survivor
---
Try and make the game last 6-10 minutes and you should rank up.
---
Me with Bing Bong Boi
---
They said that they aren't creating the monsters, so technically they are right they didn't they are just using someone elses
---
New Content is new content, and new content is rarely a bad thing.
---
*slaps your asscheeks*
---
By Max I just meant 40
---
Thank you‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Not sure if that's just them quickly throwing a name out or a "HAHA" at the fans TBH xD
---
I'm bout to slap those hams real nice like
---
I remember before everyone saying demogorgon would just be a rehash of old freddy, so I‚Äôm hoping that won‚Äôt be the case and it will have a fun and useful power
---
Too bad they cancelled the show. I was really hyped for season 4,unless they changed their minds or something?
---
YES‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏èüî•üî•üî•‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Along with a 'Game Over' font over your screen in the style of Dark Souls xD
---
Who?? üòé
---
Yep. Then they all leave because this community is too noob unfriendly.
---
This is true
---
This is definitely my headcanon now.
---
A wendigo would have technically been a human once but yeah
---
OwO
---
If you look closely, you'll see that they made the post 3 days ago. This post is to let everyone know that the they are ready for the ham slappin.
---
I know I'm a sinner for saying it, but I'm not excited.
---
To me, the Demigorgon doesn't fit the lore and that's honestly what I'm most disappointed about. I think there could have been a lot of potential for a different killer that would fit better.
---
But, thank you to the devs for bringing more content and keeping the game fresh.
---
I see your point. There are some scenarios where it's understandable to leave.
---
Why does Tapp sing opera when he gets hooked?
---
Unlike the demogorgon, the xenomorph can't be controlled for it is a simple thinking creature.
---
\*SLAP\*
---
Sometimes I can, but its random on a lot of maps and even on maps with common spawns, its random which one. The killer is faster so they have the advantage. I'm not guaranteed to find hatch
---
I see through that disguise you can't fool me well you can but still can't fool me currently
---
Ah shit, I forgot about her. It's a shame it instantly disappears as soon as mori ends though.
---
...doesn't that mean something ? :D
---
Aged like milk
---
What if the demogorgon can go invisible ie the upside down, but instead of an audio cue or shimmering in the air, it's tell its that lights flicker when it's nearby. There's already lights on generators and in houses.
---
makes sense
---
My friendship with Kate ended as well
---
There‚Äôs no point it‚Äôs pretty shit compared to most shonen
---
We must protect the babies.
---
This is why you don‚Äôt main survivor or killer, you start thinking things like this is a good idea.
---
We got plenty of baby killers. Go against them all the time. Would have liked Chucky though. 
---
Not sure it would work well with accurate sizes. Corn blindness is already a thing. Don‚Äôt want to add small grass blindness to that. Only way around it would be some sort of Changes to the vision, like a predator mode.
---
Would that be something Disney would go for?
---
Why do you think I‚Äôm posting this, knowing it‚Äôs confirmed ???
---
Did you read the titles at all??
---
People STILL do that in ever chase at rank 6. I don‚Äôt understand it, they seem to think I‚Äôll be scared of it
---
HENDERSON!!
---
They are subjective because it‚Äôs ONLY fun for the killer. No one enjoys that on survivor side. 
---
My suggestion is that the one shot huntress is awful to play against. Might as well have legion one hit down with frenzy. Just dumb. 
---
Doctor, Wraith, Plague etc all have fun ultra rare add ons. Huntress and Clown aren‚Äôt fun. Rather quit the game and play the next one. Mind you, I‚Äôve played huntress to rank 1 and have about 30-35ish iri heads and will NEVER use them unless I‚Äôm going to meme and farm. Not fun.
---
Can we just take a moment and appreciate the soundtrack?
---
I agree but only on this "because the others doesn't really exist" level. If they ALL would *actually* stand right in front of you Legion is a cat next to lions, tigers and panthers
---
Like how you make shitty office/stranger things memes to satisfy the emptiness in your life? Ohhhh man you're so interesting bro, man you like the office AND STRANGER THINGS? What a chad. I wonder how many of your "friends" pretend to like you because they are too nice to tell you to fuck off. Fucking commie
---
Your misspelling of "xenomorph" hurts my soul.
---
Dame well I hope it doesn‚Äôt break lore
---
For actually terrifying killer I think you mean " oh God please don't nerf him he isn't that strong please Bhvr ffs he's just a new killer that's mediorce at worse and good at best please God no" killer. Jokes aside rip my bank account alsk
---
Can't wait to get violently teabagged and flashlight spammed by Steve and Nancy.
---
may I use this for my steam profile?
---
It's remake Freddy so he looks a little off, sort of like a dude that attempted a Freddy costume.
---
I just thought of it being a nice refreshing change to see some different animations.
---
You realize that the poster of this post and the poster of the original post are the same person... Right?
---
DBD was just an elaborate PinHead game all along! It makes so much sense!
---
I believe they asked one time for the license and were politely declined. But never say never. Getting Stranger Things is a huge step and could incentivise more companies to want their properties in game.
---
I was implying OP knew what I‚Äôm All Ears did.
---
I asked for a mall map and they said it‚Äôs not in the plans..... YET. So that means there‚Äôs hope üòé, deadrising dlc when
---
Yeah it‚Äôs so scummy of those survivors to survive. Wish there was a way for killers to break chases.
---
spirit for sure. her power is better than the others and her perks are really good. rancor is alright, haunted grounds is really good if ur running other hex perks, and spirit fury is really helpful for low tier killers.
---
TURN ON THE AUDIO DUM DUM
---
I had a game literally end in the first minute thanks to Haunted Grounds. 
---
Was playing Hag on The Game when my Totem got cleansed, and all 4 Survivors managed to trip a Totem in perfect timing, downed them all in the first 60 seconds.
---
I ended up farming with them just because I thought it was hilarious
---
i was pretty skeptical at first but that trailer hyped me enough to go rewatch stranger things (mostly for steve)
---
Its either tommorow or the 27th, but somehow I kind of doubt its tommorow seeing as they've said nothing yet.
---
Lmao
---
Do you really want an answer?
---
I'd also be happy with Claire + Leon and Mr X.
---
I‚Äôm using Nancy cause she kicks ass.
---
Only if Arnold comes with an action command ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you?‚Äù So I can follow Nea around.
---
I was playing with one of my friends and he was like "I found the hex totem!" Right before he finished I noticed Ruin wasn't active and right after warning him everyone got exposed.
---
I think you should give it a try. In my opinion there is only one "bad" episode, and that's In season 2, and while i think it's bad i think it's good for character development. The series really brings together nerd culture with popular culture to cast a wide net for its fans. It also has a large cast of female leads who aren't useless if that's important to you like it is to me
---
Look at bottom of pic. Legion didn't say "New killer: Susie. New Killer: Frank." Etc, just "New Killer: The Legion"
---
Idk who you're VSing to constantly black pip at low ranks and simultaneously slaughter. Unless you're using something along the lines of Omega Blink, Iri Heads, Mori's, etc. to slaughter them instantly I don't think you should consistently not be pipping from matches.
---
Unless you feel the need to facecamp, proxy camp, slug, and use high end builds against survivors who barely know how to play, and even then you will most likely still black pip, but on average gain 1 pip.
---
If not him then who else?
---
#BUNNY FENG FIRST!
---
I can‚Äôt wait to be caught crouching because my hair stuck over the environment.
---
its more fun with friends. i started with some buddies and recently were getting back into it so im having more fun now.
---
Yeah it does. I think its comical I sat here and argued for months that despite what the devs say the can literally do whatever they want as far as a new killer. They literally say they wont do something then do it
---
Bubba is best
---
The mystery stream?
---
Had to roast that bitch for ruining my school life. She can suck a dick
---
You haven't watched it? d:
---
Just from guessing they may make something similar to The Dream State in relation to The Upside Down. Thats all I can predict so far. Excited though!
---
YOU STOP THIS RIGHT NOW
---
Ouch ow you hurt my soul
---
Exactly the game is very toxic. And with new players they will watch streamers who act toxic and think its fine and we flood th base with more toxic players.
---
gee stranger things how come netflix lets you have TWO survivors?
---
STEVE MAIN TIME
---
Yeah. I think for the most part on most characters the learning curve isn‚Äôt bad, but actually getting enough bloodpoints to have a good perk build is super hard now for a new player
---
We have multiple stealth killers, and we have multiple teleporting killers, multiple charging chainsaw killers even. So, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it was similar to Freddy. Especially now that they‚Äôve learned some hard lessons about making it work properly. Because game mechanic wise, research and development wise, and stranger things lore wise, I think it would make perfect sense to get pulled into the upside down at times throughout the trial.
---
Is it? It's like having a flower run after you..
---
Don't get me wrong I'm hyped, I just don't think it's a scary monster..
---
I play huntress and Meyers... But.... That demogorgon looking mighty thicc üëÄ
---
Real shit right here ^^^
---
I mean, they *don't* show up in a random order? But yeah knowing where each one goes is nice.
---
Sounds like something Ash would say
---
bleh another big screen killer thats going to be underpowered. I'd rather have original killer that are loosely based on famous killers.. like trapper = Jason (atleast imo)
---
What about Ash who came out only a month before him?
---
Huge Stranger Things fan here. I‚Äôm without a doubt one of those new players.
---
I‚Äôm excited for the new potential Playerbase this could attract, honestly.
---
*sacrificed*
---
Which scooby doo character would be a survivor if that ever happened?
---
The mindflayer, which is almost an identical being to the entity.
---
We both are.
---
OHM Y FJUCKING GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
That or they deal with the toxicity leaving the game that or be a complainer.
---
&gt;Interestingly, they disregarded their own lore and added characters that are still alive in the show as of the latest season. 
---
What are you talking about? There is Laurie and Quentin, plus almost all the other survivors were totally alive and healthy when they were taken. The only two that I remember is Tapp bleeding out, and Adam sacrificing himself.
---
And while the demogorgon is not human, it is still humanoid (1 head, 2 arms, 2 legs, no tail.)
---
as in Bob Newby Superhero?
---
Holy shit I thought this was just a meme
---
you had me at the first half, not gonna lie
---
finally, some joey love &lt;3
---
\*Slaps\*
---
Should have waited until after the announcement.
---
He got his powers when he died, why are you defending an error? This is the equivalent of arguing over ‚Äúlet‚Äôs eat grandpa vs let‚Äôs eat, grandpa‚Äù. One is wrong but it doesn‚Äôt need to be a fight or defended, how is this still going on?
---
They could share some perks.
---
How much of the show have you watched?
---
I honestly thought it was lame as hell for the longest time, but after my roommate made me watch like 4 Episodes I fell in love with it pretty quickly.
---
Same here, like it‚Äôll go into a blood hound sniffer stance and go onto all fours
---
Scoops Ahoy Cosmetic or we Riot
---
I mean, they did the whole thing on the map (that I forget) and they just didn‚Äôt release him for a while
---
I mean it kinda looks like a flower but just teethy?
---
That‚Äôs what I want Chucky to do, then he YEETS the survivor onto the hook.
---
Fuck yes. Deglove mori
---
Hopefully that just slighting, he‚Äôs a very dark green/black in the show.
---
That does not stop the hate on Xbox. Lobby or not, them toxic message are a-comin!
---
Wait for them to actually give lore, maybe?
---
In the show, it shows that at the very least, juveline demogorgons can form attachments, for example D'artagnan. 
---
Point is, Demogorgons can have some level of awareness and ability to form attachments. The Entity can manipulate that. My theory is that The Entity essentially adopted a stray Demodog during the chaos of season 2.
---
Won't matter too much if you mostly look at the back of their head.
---
What do you mean? Every dlc that has been a paragraph, with the exception of Ghostface that as a whole chapter with the price of a paragraph, has been charged less. Unless you can only play on certain maps if you have the dlc for them, I dont see the problem here.
---
It's always been 2 characters and a map for a chapter and just 1 character for a paragraph, except Ghostface. Chapters are more expensive then paragraphs, this one should be more expensive then a normal chapter since there are 3 characters in it.
---
A dlc I might actually buy? mmmmmmmmm
---
First month it will be nothing but that killer on all matches, then to the trashcan with a m1 with mediocre power that slows down gens/end chases and back to nursebilly
---
I understood that reference
---
Sure if they wanted to do it they find a way
---
I want Trager but hes kinda like doctor
---
\*Into the upside down\*
---
*a c q u i r e*
---
scoops ahoy cosmetic or death
---
Give me Predator, Xenomorph, Chucky and The Thing!
---
I really wish this game actually had more intense animations. Like Billy's mori should literally chainsaw someone in half but all it is is some blood spurts out while it happens and that's it. Like this is a horror game show some carnage.
---
No, if you demolish them pretty much instantly and none of them are altruistic then you safety at best. That‚Äôs 4 hooks, 8 hits if you have no instadown and no gens kicked/few pallet breaks. If you slaughter a team in 2 minutes then you safety.
---
Kinda explains each chapter doesn't it?
---
Noice
---
Right, and I DO hope its indoors, just hope it's a indoor map the community takes well.
---
Except, it‚Äôs not like that argument at all lol he was in the process of dying when he got his powers. You don‚Äôt have to agree with me, that‚Äôs fine, but you also don‚Äôt have to go out of your way to tell me I‚Äôm wrong when I‚Äôm not. You believe what you want to believe, I‚Äôll believe what I want to believe. We aren‚Äôt believing radically different things, they‚Äôre basically the same exact thing. Chill out lol
---
Can I just say how relieved I am that they didn‚Äôt go with &gt;!Billy!&lt; as killer?
---
If you see susie wearing the frosted eyes mask with Joey‚Äôs knife know i mean fucking *business* and i will drop your sorry ass to rank 15 in a heartbeat once i start actually using the power instead of ‚Äúooo shiny knife‚Äù and forgetting about it.
---
Repost...
---
THERE IT IS WE CALLED IT
---
Do you have a link to the SH story? I‚Äôve seen the movies and watched some of the games but have no idea what actually happened
---
Honestly, played my first games of killer today with Myers and Clown cause I wanted to get rid of some dailies. I can see why you all use ruin so frequently.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what you mean. I‚Äôm sorry.
---
The realm will be Hawkins National Laboratory. The map will be The Underground Complex
---
Fully depends on Scoops Ahoy cosmetic.
---
They already confirmed that each survivor was separate and had their own perks.
---
Even if it wasnt signed after the likeness is from like 40 years ago?
---
Laughs in Bill
---
yes, they act just like The Huntress's hatches
---
You'll notice a white sheen go across the bottle when it's fully charged for a throw
---
Eh I mean Ghostface was pretty accurate in the game compared to his trailer plus I mean maybe it's a different type of demogorgon which is why it's more paleish maybe even humanoid?
---
So the question is; are both survivors getting unique perks?
---
Pausing to prevent a skill check is correct. You can't repair it any more until it stops sparking
---
That map lools like lery's
---
*Cries in Billy main*
---
It should have two killers  as well
---
I don‚Äôt see a problem with my title
---
Am I the only one to count demogorgam as a sub species of human?
---
Yeah I'm not listening to them anymore I don't know if they're doing it because they're being sloppy or if it's intentional to throw us off guessing lol
---
The learning curve or "skill floor"
---
Olden Blur came from the golden Ace costume he has
---
Originally named Golden Blur but it's devolved to Olden Blur over time. 
---
Ace has the lightest foot step sound so he's hard to hear but Tru3 cancels that out with the obvious gold suit
---
Yes they add new code with every update but they have a habit of only doing the minimum. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs impossible, merely that it was also possible when they coded The Game and I don‚Äôt see them coding nearly identical things differently for different maps. It‚Äôs just not their thing.
---
Used adrenaline for awhile, but found it to be fairly useless most games since I do most of my running for the first gen or two and then work on gens and do saves the rest of the games
---
Give me a source. No one has ever been able to before tho. That's because they never said that.
---
um????
---
I‚Äôm less thinking about abilities and more about possible moris. I‚Äôm gonna need to rewatch Stranger Things for more ideas of what it could be.
---
 **F in the chat for the first hit on the air. pro player spotted.**
---
*-slaps Doctor-* **AAAAAaAAaAAAAaaaAaaaA!**
---
Yeah, they could still claim she'd dead in-canon though. I don't think they'd need the rights to H20 to say that.
---
The hatch will spawn when there is at least one more gen completed than survivors alive. If all 4 survivors are alive, all 5 gens need to be completed. 3 survivors alive means 4 gens needed to be popped.
---
They could have actually let me hang on the hook and go complete a generator, then come for me and we all get hatch, or first get me and do the gen together, but it was easier to blend in the corn and do nothing I guess.
---
It‚Äôs better to stop working because even though the progress bar is on pause, you can still trigger more skill checks that would only further regress the generator.
---
I'm stoked about this but I'm still waiting for a Hellraiser dlc. Give me Pinhead! Cenobytes ftw
---
Lerys 2.0 is here!
---
Everyone was reluctant to Freddy‚Äôs concept because they didn‚Äôt think BHVR would put resources into making a dream world.
---
DBD killers don‚Äôt all have to be slasher material to be killers, they just have to simply enjoy killing.
---
DBD expanding their killers outside of the human range is a good thing. The Demogorgon would work under the Entity for the same reason the others do, it‚Äôs under it‚Äôs control.
---
This did not age well.
---
Is this a reference to DomiNations?
---
And never touch religious themes, yet we got plague now
---
Its been known for a while :X
---
Ohh okay that makes sense, thanks
---
What, they are characters not real ai. They will move with your command.
---
It‚Äôs... not a different opinion on the word though? What you were saying simply wasn‚Äôt what a tragic backstory means. And, again, ghostface is not a psychopath, he‚Äôs a sociopath. you should know what these words mean if you‚Äôre going to use them.
---
Bubba's Basement IQ200
---
chapter should've been scooby doo imo
---
That's not the point. The point is that, regardless of rank, if you absolutely curbstomp survivors you don't pip at any rank and can depip at high ranks.
---
I‚Äôm curious whether being in the Upside Down is going to benefit the Killer or not.
---
Probably shaggy as I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs the most iconic of the gang.
---
I have the weirdest boner.
---
Time to get slapped
---
They are!
---
Most likely it will be like Myers where it will play a bit of the theme and then go back to menu music
---
So u/breadpear how excited are you with today‚Äôs trailer?
---
I‚Äôm talking about the lack of maps. Not every killer gets its own map, and yet they still charge the same. Like I said, I can understand charging more for more content, though it would be annoying that they don‚Äôt charge less for less content too.
---
So does this mean 6 survivor perks or will they both share teachables?
---
Our guy needs some luv
---
Entity better be replaced by the mind flayer
---
Does it really?
---
*googles*
---
I want barb. lol
---
Makes sense
---
Spirit is great and very fun, some good perks. Legion is very fun but pretty bad, he has good perks also, iron maiden is a must have if you like Huntress. Plague is an average killer, i don‚Äôt find her too fun but thats all opinion, her perks are ok.
---
Happened to me before too. I restarted my xbox and that worked once other times not. If restarting doesn‚Äôt work uninstall game and reinstall. All progress will be saved. Sad I knew the bug before even clicking the link xD . Hope this helps!
---
They did even fog whispers have quoted it but it's because realistically no one can be arsed to sit digging through hours of many streams just to find 1 sentence.
---
Neat
---
WHO DO YOU WORK FOR
---
Still will reach top tier
---
*sighs, equips enduring*
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea to base them off other killers. That just leads to things being too unoriginal
---
Kind of sounds similar to that one scp from scp containment breach
---
weird that they declined. would be a good way of continuing the franchise as after part 2 i cant see it going anywhere
---
Who the flying fuck wants to be Barb
---
I meant Carl the who*! 
---
Ye its panda i'm not hiding :) I post on here quite regularly! This might be the first DBD meme I have made thats actually not shit though lol
---
Bad drawing of Quentin: not enough wrinkles.
---
Jokes aside, amazing artwork and the devs should look to you if they ever want to do pins or something collectable for people who want them.
---
why didn't you use quick and quiet?
---
https://www.bleedingcool.com/2019/08/19/stranger-things-is-officially-coming-to-dead-by-daylight/
---
You can still use her as a mini nurse to cancel pallet loops.
---
An alien is indeed humanoid in terms of animation as confirmed by a DBD dev/community manager.
---
&gt; Deathgarden
---
Not really my type. I want an evolution of being a bad ass as a killer, killing people like in horror movies.
---
A ton of posts were asking after the trailer came out  if they were actually separate characters or if they would act like legion
---
I think it's more referring to them having different perks rather than the other just being a skin. That and/or they level seperately whereas legion doesn't
---
When the game actually does : '' A pretty good job''
---
Totally agree. Stranger things is a huge win for dead by daylight. I‚Äôve seen a good amount of people say they‚Äôre going to try it just because of this upcoming dlc. I‚Äôm so excited for the chapter and the future of this game! :D
---
Ah so every game almost.
---
Yeah but I‚Äôm still looking out for streams or announcements around release dates
---
I was thinking more of "Get to the Generator!"
---
agreed. the success of this DLC will really change the future of this game. hope the numbers are really good.
---
Listen here dumb-tard, obviously you don't know anything about game development and design... The fucking chapter needs to be reworked into the best video game of all time, hulgans Castle on the Nintendo 64!
---
What about the Coldwind map with no buildings? Or the MacMillan ones?
---
I almost want to pick up a controller for this reason. It‚Äôs really hard to swap from holding A to S and 180 the camera on pc
---
Julie sucks.
---
I posted this last night then deleted it. So... I guess technically?
---
That jacket tho
---
The only thing Im sad about is that now we have 3 Licensed Expansions in a Row... With a total of 5 Licensed Characters in a row...  
---
Why is that Bad? Well, I'm broke, and Licensed Characters are only obtainable by Real Currency, no Play-Time :'3
---
\*Sighs and opens wallet\* ... Well, 10 Pesos. Shit.
---
I don't think they'll have a problem with that
---
Incredibly. I never thought I'd get to see the day where Steve The Hair Harrington could loop a Demogorgon around a pallet. Very hyped! They better have his Scoops Ahoy outfit as a shop cosmetic though.
---
Those increase bp in trial not post trial, so it gets you the cap faster
---
Oh, I never really picked up on a Pet and Master relationship between them! Makes sense, though. Well I'll ~~just use that as an excuse to~~ rewatch the entire series again, just to be safe.
---
Big thing that makes survivors good is looping. Just learn how to Loop a pallet, or window, or even looping long objects that have no pallets for Windows can still be a good way to stall out how long the killer takes to hit you. When you Loop you don't want to run it wide, be sticking close to the loop without bumping into it.
---
Possible Robin scoops skin for Nancy?/s
---
Honestly i would like some of the other characters to come in as skins like how L4D had their survivors as skins except Bill.
---
**LOOK AT THAT, IT LOOKS LIKE TWO BALLS AND A BONG**
---
Oh hi Panda! Ur cool
---
Yeah it is in my opinion being born with a psychopathy or whatever not that it matters (again petty) is tragic and dark. Well I'm sorry I triggered your brain that has to have specific terms in order to stay calm.
---
YALLLLLLL
---
Adam was on a crashed train, it's possible he died or was near death.
---
There was a dream that was scoops ahoy...
---
This is a joke post right?
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt see how they couldn‚Äôt it‚Äôs such a no brainer.
---
Oof then just switch off of them no reason to limit yourself.
---
Because they gonna get coin from this chapter
---
Why do you think this is a wouldn't work ?
---
Barbecue and chili shows survivors auras a short amount of time after a survivor is hooked. (Only shows auras if 30 something meters away from the hook). Also maybe killer hears your character groaning if injured or breathing if not.
---
They look really good.
---
That's fair. We all have shows someone else thinks is lame. Like I loved the old mighty ducks cartoon, and boy did not a lot of other people.
---
Used to think this until I played killer and two gens pop by the time I down my first survivor. Without ruin, noed would be my only saving grace.
---
This is a bit of a tricky question to answer, because there isn‚Äôt enough information on what kind of play style or perks you use in the game. To answer your question, it depends on what perks the killer has attached on them in the match. If the killer usually walks directly towards you after hooking someone, it‚Äôs more likely he has BBQ and Chili (as you‚Äôre more than 40 m away from where the hooked survivor is). There are other tracking perks the killer could be using, such as for generators, but that is beside the point. 
---
 I think as for the survivor perks goes, the only one that gives direct information of your location is Object of Obsession.
---
Making up for ghost face dropping w/o a survivor.
---
Now that you mention it... huh... I wonder if they‚Äôll do anything about this or allow the lapse in logic
---
This got me thinking about an alien isolation chapter (probably wont happen)
---
"*"insert name"* is coming to DBD!"
---
Someone already called it simply because people have been asking since forever for Pennywise, Chucky, Jason, Xenomorph, Jeeper Creepers, whatever other character you can think of.
---
Ready as baby killer
---
Has there ever been a double bloodpoints event?
---
*raises hand* 
---
I know of Dead by Daylight only in passing.  You best believe I'm installing when I get home and watching beginning tutorial guides as we speak.
---
Finished the first season. I heard it gets better but for me if a show can't "convince me" within the season I usually just let it go. Same happened with the new Sabrina show.
---
To only watch the games is a poor experience. Your connection to the series is ideal when it's greatly shaped by your experiences in-game, mainly the endings you get [because of/and] your reactions to some events and details.
---
The experience of achieving one ending in SH2 without being previously spoiled about them or the mechanics necessary to achieve them is one of the highest moments of gaming in general, imho.
---
Good thing I only care about the demogorgon cus hell no am I gonna spend 3 mil when I can prestige the Demogorgon like 2 times with that many bloodpoints
---
Nurse has asylum, Doc has lery's, Hag has the swamp maps, Huntress has mother's dwelling, Myers has Lampkin Lane, Pig has The Game, Freddy has 5 Badham Preschools, Clown has Chapel, Spirit has Family Residence, Legion has Ormond and Plague has Temple of Purgation.
---
Leatherface and Ghostface don't have any maps but are stand-alone characters and cost less
---
If it's right after they hooked someone, it's BBQ and Chili. If it's after you completed a gen, it's probably Bitter Murmur or Rancor.
---
The only way you can 100% confirm is with the perk Distortion (Jeff Johansen teachable), but the more you play, the more onvious it will get that the killer is coming straight to you because of a perk.
---
To avoid BBQ, you can hide in a locker just before the hook, and wait 5 seconds, you position yourself behind a gen (as the aura of the gen obscures the aura of the survivor), or you could run Distortion. You could also be close to the hook, as BBQ doesn't show people who are close to the killer.
---
Haven‚Äôt seen stranger thing‚Äôs but played the mobile game. It seem‚Äôs interesting. Anyone wanna explain the show.
---
Kind of looks like Steve's actor was all like "oh you wanna put me in a video game? Awesome." And then Nancy's actress was like "Ew you want me in a video game, no thanks."
---
More then 2 perks per bloodweb so you have a higher chance of getting that perk you want instead of something useless. I myself just got back into dead by daylight around a month ago so I‚Äôm not completely sure of big changes between then and now.
---
Oooooh yesssss
---
Pizzagorgon
---
*slam*
---
Hehheehehehhehehe
---
ME (but Steve, not Nancy üòú)
---
n
---
no
---
Dave Richards Creative Director basically confirmed 3 new perks each for Steve &amp; Nancy.
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/DeviusQC/status/1163452352239681536
---
Racist!
---
Xenomorph would be like. What would its power be? I was thinking chestburster would be cool. Put a face hugger on the survivor. It would add a killer similar to Amanda
---
Render lighting is often white as opposed to the dark and colored lighting in game.
---
Tell me about it, I wish healing magic was real so I could have my husband literally fucking stab me rather than just choke me.
---
Well I guess I wont buy the spirit
---
This does not constitute random, but I get the point.
---
Yeah!  Maybe not during a new content drop but they like to do double bloodpoint events periodically!
---
Just a theory but maybe this collab was in the works before Season 3 dropped? Maybe BHVR didn't know about the mall at the time? Who knows.
---
Personally, I'll save you if I happen by you, but if I'm the only one left standing, I'm looking for the hatch.
---
WHAT THIS IS FUCKNG REAL
---
Don't be a dick. Let people be hype
---
What do you play on?
---
Like it or not we got the demogorgon so whatever lol, I‚Äôm ok with it just thought it‚Äôs a bit strange
---
No, Alien Resurrection did that first.
---
I mean the game literally deals with ‚Äúthe entity‚Äù which is very much not human. And creepy mutants with super powers and ghosts. A creature from another dimension isn‚Äôt any less weird.
---
DOE about Will to his mom
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure this isn‚Äôt an official thing. Like this is just experience players answering questions for new players
---
Yea but you have to think he literally comes with a bright map well at least from what we've seen so if we do see him in bright light it's gonna be weird
---
Haha!  Holy shit a p3 Demogorgon that‚Äôs going to be so badass looking!
---
This is me... for now. Until dragon slayer Min is released üî•
---
YESSSSSSS
---
The Light of the flashlight will dry out it's mouth and that's how it becomes stunned because it has to make it's mouth wet again to chew properly
---
Your title is "we are doomed." The toxicity you are referring to is *you*
---
Given there are characters that are extra vulnerable to flashlights (wraith, nurse), I could see it having a passive ability that makes it immune to flashlights
---
I‚Äôm stilling waiting for the r/Woosh this game be real
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs hard for me to pay attention to shows like that, but I took a class on screenwriting where we watched the first 2 episodes and it seems okay (I just get into it myself beyond this I watched because I was basically forced) but the content looks cool and it‚Äôs always exciting to get new stuff.
---
"Adds an"
---
They're not hookers. *sniff* They're massacre therapists.
---
I enjoy simulaton game
---
I want to play Steve but I dont wanna leave my baby Dwight and his big boi pants
---
Deliverance breaks you for a while, though.
---
I haven‚Äôt played DBD in a few months, I haven‚Äôt bought a single DLC, but this, THIS is getting my money!
---
You realize regardless of op, I‚Äôm still mocking the opinion originally posted... right?
---
Lmao Minecraft actually
---
We have Billy and Bubba, we could 100% have hag and wendigo.
---
-wet lip smacking noises-
---
Not being a dick and it wasn't meant to be taken that way. I just don't understand why people don't look and take part in discussions on posts about the topic they were gonna bring up
---
*every killer main immediately picks up the Demogorgon*
---
So now if I want to kill children I just need to play this game? Nice.
---
Dave Richards Creative Director BHVR basically confirmed 3 new perks each for Steve &amp; Nancy.
---
I personally like to think that the Entity actually dragged Carl and his store in with Ghostface, but he's ruthlessly defending it so not even the Entity can drag him or the store into matches with the other survivors.
---
Now make a third panel just showing the DC symbol where that guy is.
---
Uuuuuh... what?
---
Trueeee...  Freddy's dream world was shit before the update...  But my idea is you can get to the upside-down with and without your will... Portals around the map to get in ( that dissappear when you use them and appear somewhere else) or get out...  Also somehow the Demogorgon has to be able to get you in maybe traps that get u in and then he is super buffed in there... I love theories xD
---
Indeed it will which is why I'm just gonna powered level His ass. If I can P3 Ghostface in 1 week I can do demogorgon in 1 week also. Rip sleep though
---
Is this console or Steam?
---
On the other hand, there *is* a logical reason for it to rough you up a bit and leave you be: If it wants to bring you back to it's nest to repopulate, it probably won't kill you so it'd make sense for it to not kill you. All it'd take it a slight reskinning of the hook, with the explanation being 'Hey, it'll take about 2 hookings for the egg there to wake up and murder the shit out of who's there'.
---
I could see an interesting mechanic where if a hook is used enough, you get egg'd instead even if this is your first time, and as a result you have maybe 120 seconds before you die via burst ~~but only if someone rescues you, if nobody rescues you, you just die~~. Then, you can spend those 120 seconds essentially fucking around and doing what you can to help your teammates before you go, since now the killer has less reason to bother with you since you're already dead. It'd certainly need balancing ~~maybe you need to have been hooked once before to get egg'd~~ but still it could be fun
---
I'm gonna need some proof there.
---
I want it to be able to tear through into the regular world to attack survivor. Sorta like old Freddy, but instead of bringing people into the upside down he escapes out of it into the same world as the survivors. Or an even more crazy thought could be that when he downs people, instead of hooking them, he puts them in the upside down and to free the person the other survivors have to enter the tears left in the walls to find them and be able to help.
---
doubt it, but would be cool
---
I‚Äôm leaning towards Nancy. But it honestly depends on their perks. Steve will probs be a Bully build and Nancy will be a Detective/Objectives build
---
That actually makes a lot of sense I hope not and hope so at the same time if it is I guess I won‚Äôt have to pay extra for another survivor
---
On this week's episode: BHVR discovers how to print money.
---
Doesn‚Äôt leather face have the grim pantry?
---
Spooky face goblin
---
I'm a Myers/Piggy main and this looks amazing. I love it.
---
Legion got reworked somewhat since his release so he can‚Äôt do exploit related things (i.e. moonwalking). In competition with wraith for one of the worst killers currently. 2 new killers and 2 new survivors added. The Plague and Jane Romero got added as DbD originals. Ash from Evil Dead and Ghostface from Scream have been added as licensed characters.
---
Freddy got his rework and general consensus is positive. He is now an upper mid tier killer, I would suggest reading his new stuff as it would take too long (They changes every aspect of him). They also added 4 new variations of his map with the tiles being moved around.
---
Bloodweb change details have not been revealed, but they did confirm they are not removing perk levels.
---
They also just announced the Stranger Things DLC today! New killer and 2 new survivors.
---
Okay.
---
Best guides are made by PainReliever and Otzdarva
---
PainReliever for more serious commentary, and Otz for the friendly neighborhood grampa.
---
Dbd doesnt deserve to touch Alien but I cant help but love the idea of it as killer with eggs that can open and infect survivors, eventually bursting out of them like the pigs traps.
---
The big one is Endgame Collapse. Simply put, it's just a timer that starts once the gates are opened to prevent survivors from just hanging out or hiding somewhere to keep the game going. It last 2 minutes, and if you don't exit in that 2 minutes, the entity kills you. If someone is in the dying state or hooked, the timer slows down to give you more time to save them.
---
The other big thing is that the hatch rules have changed slightly. Hatch is always available to the last survivor, even with 5 gens remaining. The killer can now close the hatch, triggering the Endgame Collapse. This forces the last survivor to try to open an exit gate.
---
You probably want to youtube a video explanation, but it's not too complicated.
---
Also, about a month ago now, the dev team launched a reworked Freddy (and some new Badham Preschool maps). Also worth a youtubing or googling.
---
3-4 million
---
The thing about ‚Äúknown‚Äù killers like Freddy, Meyers, etc. is that yea I enjoy original killers, but I fucking love the inclusion of movie killers. It also makes the game seem way more Interesting when I tell people about the game, especially with them adding stranger things.
---
Now I can tell my buds ‚Äúyea the fucking demogorgan and Steve are both in the game too.‚Äù
---
i love this concept, i really hope they implement the upside-down dimension.(just cuz its cool)
---
Demogorgon is gonna be old Freddy basically for those people that love old Freddy but he'll be better I imagine and for perks probably tracking or slowing the game down.
---
Please don‚Äôt tell me this is real I fucking despise this show
---
I got the 9000 shards and bought the clown. To say I regret it is an understatement
---
Nah, he wasn't even that bad of a guy. He had a redemption story and I've loved him more than Jonathan since the start.
---
I having a crisis on who I should prestige first. I like both Nancy and Steve but Demogorgon looks amazing.
---
Sell PC to Buy Game
---
God speed. I won‚Äôt be sleeping with you.
---
Predator would be great too. He could have his thermal vision to spot survivors and could cloak. That's another invisible/stalking/stealth killer. Or he could even have traps
---
Well we saw the Demigorgon crawling on the floor so that may be an aspect of it. From looking at the Demigorgons wikia page (haven‚Äôt seen the show) it can teleport, has telekinesis, and can smell blood through dimensions, so maybe it‚Äôll have decent tracking against injured survivors while being able to teleport in a similar manner to Freddy? But that‚Äôs just a guess, it could be something completely different. Hopefully the ptb will be out soon, I‚Äôm guessing either next Tuesday or the week after
---
The first sound the demogorgon makes sounds like a monster from terraria
---
I don‚Äôt give two shits about Stranger Things and I am excited for this new chapter.
---
Let's fucking go
---
That‚Äôs not PTB release date
---
Exactly.
---
BRO IMMA BE A DEMOGORGAN MAIN AND A STEVE MAIN IDC
---
Who's ready for the most expensive DLC?
---
Hey, if the show isn‚Äôt for you then that‚Äôs all good. So long as you aren‚Äôt bashing people for their interest in it.
---
Nice!!!!! Gotta ask, where did you get the mask? Or if you made it, what material did you use for the skin? Working on my own Amanda cosplay and the pig head is killing me.
---
No shit
---
Huntress is literally one of the best killers there is. Her worst maps are farm maps because you can't hit over the loops. Other ones you can
---
Guys, we took a poll the Demogorgon is failing. Pack it up boys, we tried...
---
Probably 14 bucks considering Full chapters with 2 characters are 8 so splitting it in half would make them both 4 so if we add another one it'd be well 14$
---
They should add voice lines to all the characters...
---
Oh shit the map is the Hawkins lab? I wonder if we're gonna be restricted to 1/2 floors in the building or if we'll be getting an indoors map that's 3+ layers. Idk how they'd pull it off balanced but I've hoped for a big several floor building for awhile (though in my mind I always imagine it being an apartment building)
---
Broken key does last longer than a dull key, for what it's worth...
---
Imagine a Josh killer instead
---
But why is Ace friends with Steve?...
---
‚ÄúA dimensional killer‚Äù maybe? It‚Äôll depend on the Demigorgons power
---
Yeah that's what I figured. I appreciate what it's doing though. Kind of setting a new avenue sort of for horror/sci-fi.
---
I mean they have the actors faces so what‚Äôs stopping them from putting in voice lines like Ash
---
Yeeeeeeep!
---
Nah one of the McPoyles would definitely be the killer
---
Upvotes are for posts/comments you found helpful/relevant to the discussion.
---
Downvotes are for irrelevant discussion, spam or outright incorrect information. Unfortunately that's not how they're used, it's especially bad for opinion threads where downvotes should have no place, but still it happens.
---
What happens is that memes get to the top, and any attempts at discussion go down because "I disagree" with that post and don't want to see it and downvote it. But that's not how that was designed to be used, so it makes the site just a little bit shittier each time it happens.
---
Well fingers crossed for a dbl bloodpoint event haha. I say save a million beforehand, throw it in killer, play with your favorite with bbq then level Steve/Nancy as you go.  **fingers crossed you get bbq and chili with the Demagorgon early so you can play and get those points**
---
Maybe I‚Äôll play both
---
I shall rush it to show everyone how it looks so they don't have to if they don't like it.
---
Wait the demogorgon isn‚Äôt an alien tho?
---
I've got a question about the incoming doctor "rework", will the moldy electrode be a part of his base kit? Or in general, what are going to be the changes made to his kit?
---
Did you catch the final scene of s3, in the Russian prison?
---
The predator would be so much of a better choice
---
I upvoted because it‚Äôs controversial...
---
I mean, I'm pretty sure getting smacked with a big ass matchette would also kill you, yet somehow Trapper needs to smack you twice AND hook you to kill you.
---
Same here, I enjoy reading the lore so I love Wraith and Hillbilly. I really wish I could learn more about Joey but there's not much on him.
---
Tbf the show itself uses the term ‚Äúhorror‚Äù loose as hell.
---
As someone who got the game a couple weeks ago, let me tell ya about my struggles and legitimate thot process playing against spirit 
---
\- *why the wind so loud*
---
*- oh*
---
*- alright she can tp to me, im gonna deop her on the pallet*
---
\- *oh shes standing there, alright if she wants to waste time so be it*
---
*- oh.2*
---
\- *aight welp last hook, my teams unsafe hooking me*
---
\-*theres a jungle gym over here so maybe I can loop her*
---
\- *wait where is the red stain*
---
*-* ***oh.3***
---
I just... the movies terrified me when I was younger, but they always had this sort of 'black humor' to them - y'know, they were movies about people being hunted and killed like cattle, but the bad guys were kinda funny about it. I understand that Bubba is supposed to be scary, but...
---
He walks like he has poop in his pants. When he uses his saw he's not terrifying he's cute, all grunty and desperate. When he gets stunned he squeals like a lil piggy, and he throws adorable temper tantrums when he hits a wall. 
---
He's just an adorable lil murder babby.
---
When the chapter drops there should be a change to the bloodweb to make it less grindy to unlock new stuff iirc, but double bloodpoints would be awesome
---
Sounds familiar...
---
Maybe Xenomorph would add vents in the map that he could travel through?
---
Who doesn't like stranger things?
---
you should probably watch the show instead of asking someone to explain it to you. it would be a better experience.
---
... is that what this means? I just thought it was something to pass the time
---
I have no problem with other people liking the show I jus think it‚Äôs weird how all the killers are old horror movie themed (I‚Äôm a GIANT fan of classic horror movies) and then adding some teenager show just seems kinda eh.
---
I was excited for a new original killer. I‚Äôd have been fine with just the ST kids as survivors but Demogorgon killer is so unbelievably stupid. Why not throw in a random Xenomorph? And a Clicker from TLOU too? What‚Äôs an aesthetic?
---
Big shmacc hours
---
I second that!!1! That could be the next chapter but the stupid idiots at BHVR do not understand what the fans are gonna actually want *angry face*
---
I‚Äôd say watch it anyway. I felt that way about various shows and then enjoyed them when I watched years later
---
It depends how you look at it I'd still say they all have messed up tragic lives.
---
I doubt they ever do a non-humanoid, like they've said.
---
That's actually a pretty good idea. Definitely unique. Would the upside just be it's own default map thats the same for all maps or would each map have their upside down version
---
That‚Äôs fair. Some people are more into the classics because new aged things have their own style and rhythm that others aren‚Äôt quite into.
---
Yeah, opening up to more characters like the Demogorgon opens up so many more avenues for the game.    
---
Alien, for example.
---
How are feeling right now?
---
My currency is not dollars, then in USA for example, a normal dlc costs 8, but how much costs the leatherface or ash dlc? if they costs 4 it's okay, it's just as you said (I ask because in my country the LF and Ash DLC don't cost half as much as the others DLC's, costs more than half)
---
You know, thats a good answer. I still think it would be really cool to be qble to defeat the killer. Although I cqb see why you would think that.
---
The PTB is likely to be next Tuesday.
---
Same but for me it was Ash
---
Played this game for a while on PS4, when it was free for Plus members.    
---
Buying it on PC to play regularly, because of this DLC. I must be Steve.
---
The theme was used in the reveal trailer and it sounded really close to this, but without all the really deep notes
---
That‚Äôs not what prompted the confusion... lol this is just.... what?
---
Demigorgon is still a humanoid, xenomorph will prob never happen
---
I agree
---
Yes but the grind is still important to the game which leads me to believe we may still need it for those who are impatient and want everyone leveled as quick as possible!
---
Makes me think it'll be another licensed killer like Jason or Pinhead. Wouldn't make much sense that they'd do a one killer chapter for an original killer.
---
Maybe I missed something, but I don't believe the demogorgons have any specific revealed connection to the mind flayer. They're just two separate hostile species that live in the never-never
---
Yea exactly, the upside is just the normal map. The upside down could be easily made as a set map with pieces and every match it gets procedurally changed just like the normal maps.
---
What do you mean? As in they escaped the entity realm and went back to their "movies" or?
---
If anything, alien would probably be allowed to climb on top of objects and scenery, at a very reduced movement rate, and be able to pounce. 
---
I‚Äôm thinking more along the lines of OG Alien capabilities, where there is just one. Allows it to be smaller, more agile. Facehuggers would be more of a Queen Xenomorphs thing.
---
Already saving the bp for that purple flashlight
---
There was once a triple bloodpoints event. It's probably never coming back though
---
Oh I thought he was doing a mori on meg for a second lol
---
I really like this theory 
---
It gives a method to the madness of chapter drops lol
---
Let's be real, Claudette is still gonna be one of the most picked survivors because of her stealth factor.
---
Man, I must be the only one who knowingly does this, knowing that the more I BM, the longer I'm being chased, and therefore, the more time the others have doing gens, and the less I complain when camped. (I rarely do complain when camped. I have my limits, however, but basementfaces have a pass.)
---
If summoning demodogs is the ability, Feng Min gonna be OP
---
The mall would‚Äôve been a better map tbh
---
Exactly, and I think if they continued to add old movie stuff (Jason vorhees, for example) it‚Äôs quite obvious they just did season 13 for the money but if they continue to add newer stuff I‚Äôd honestly have no problem with it. Like if they‚Äôre going to break the chain they might as well stick with the plan yk
---
Not really into it but yea sure. Dont have much free time spent
---
Can‚Äôt see predators fitting very well. They have a huge arsenal of futuristic weapons, and would feel awful if you couldn‚Äôt use them /were super weak. 
---
Imagine using a homing missile on a survivor and they just lose one health state? Madness. 
---
Only thing predators have going for them in this game would be cloaking, but we already have wraith.
---
Steve is my name so I feel obligated.
---
Same!! I love Joey‚Äôs design and I wish they would give us more about him. Hillbilly is actually my favorite character and his backstory makes me so sad... there‚Äôs so many good characters in this game and I wish they‚Äôd do more with lore.
---
Are we talking like Myers music (where it will play a little and go away) or like the clown music (where it will constantly play)
---
Mission failed, we‚Äôll get em next time.
---
Thankfully the devs are also changing Bloodweb soon.

It‚Äôs almost like we were made for this
---
Are you seriously complaining about new ds you fucking rank 21
---
I think it‚Äôs worse when it pops on all 9 gens and your hex totem
---
If a Scoops Ahoy skin comes for Steve me and shirtless David will be done
---
Its probably the lighting but to me her forehead is too big but either way they're pretty spot on
---
Well I wouldnt know I'm not knowledgeable with money from different countries but they are around 5$ dollars
---
It‚Äôs not Baby Dwight, it‚Äôs being a Dwight Supremacist.
---
Also - become one with the locker.
---
It is a nice selling point of the game that there are famous movie killers (and tv killers now lol) in the game
---
ok yeah nice joke post
---
The clown is a really cool killer especially with that creepy laugh lol
---
PTB should be next week, two weeks of testing time, then released on the following Tuesday.
---
It has horror elements, but I wouldn't call it horror. The different characters have plots in different genres. Nancy gets horror, Hop gets conspiracy, and the kids get Sci-fi.
---
Again, they were specific about "non humanoid" and they were specific on why. Demogorgon changes nothing.
---
Well I agree on most parts except for the money thing. People have been asking for Stranger Things for quite a bit and there‚Äôs a large fan base for it so it can attract more players and give pre-existing players in the fandom what they want... while also making money. It‚Äôs a win-win
---
Fair point actually
---
Y'know, we could also get Walter Sullivan as a killer. From SH4?
---
He should carry people in his mouth and walk on all 4s.
---
He would‚Äôve made more sense than the Demogorgon. Both are stupid options though.
---
Dedicated servers is all I care about with them Rollin out more dlc. So sick of 3/4 games playing against some shit head killer with 500+ ping.
---
He means the meme pic
---
Fingers crossed they add it in the shop
---
WELLLLLL THATS OUR NEW KILLER!
---
Why not instead of hooking people, it wraps them in goo like in the second film?
---
Usually, I run bond to avoid this. Only as a VERY desperate measure, like tombstone Myers desperate, will I do this.
---
Oh OK. I've never played that game. DomiNations was this old base builder  where you moved through different time periods. So you started in the Stone Age with weak walls, then the whatever age when your base was upgraded enough, and so on
---
Thanks for answering anyway
---
Inb4 new chase music
---
But xenomorphs are humanoid
---
His special killer power, if you try to blind him he just pulls out a gun and shoots you.
---
I want Nancyyyyyyy
---
That doesn't sound too good or useful at all. That and I don't think the game would run that pretty well
---
Shit never thought about that. Magic?
---
Even if one Survivor perk is actually usable it will get nerfed into irrelevancy after 1 month at the latest.
---
Nostromo would be cool, or even the hive from Aliens.
---
Love him or hate him he be spitting straight fax doe
---
The devs had explicitly stated in old streams that all killers have to have been human at one point.
---
But they‚Äôre changing everything now, like chapters &amp; paragraphs contradicting what they said before, so it doesn‚Äôt mean anything anymore.
---
I'm aware, just saying, nothing has actually changed.
---
Okay firstly you need to watch stranger things. It‚Äôs amazing. Secondly If you look at concept art and some pictures from the show you can't see any eyes on it. It must navigate and hunt using sound and smell, or some kind of sixth sense.
---
I personally don‚Äôt terribly mind the grind, but with each release it does make it harder and harder so some change would be nice. Also if they extended the bloodpoints cap by just a little bit, i wouldn‚Äôt be complaining lol
---
I don't get this point, you can apply it with every killer. Why would spirit need to hit twice the survivors? She has a fucking katana. Why would ghostface/myers have to hit twice the survivors? They have a fricking knife !  
---
Also try to take an axe thrown at full speed in your head, pretty sure it would kill you one shot.
---
You'd look like that if you were sleep deprived as hell!
---
I‚Äôm not buying a chapter JUST for skins. 
---
For that, I hope they nerf the Demogorgan power and perks right after the chapter comes out so you can feel like you wasted your money.
---
Found a Dresden fan!
---
It just mean if the devs consider the demogorgan humanoid than anything around that level of humanity can get added
---
Demogorgon next pls
---
Yeah he would scare me when he'd chase me because it was silent and 3rd person then he was just there in the distance, something creepy about it.
---
So does that mean a werewolf killer is a possibility, then?
---
I used to struggle mainly for the blood points and when I did that the other person would usually die.
---
Lol
---
I must be in a minority. Love the show, happy to see Steve as a survivor, but incredibly disappointed we don‚Äôt get an OC killer. Demogorgon is a dumb choice to me and I always love seeing BHVR‚Äôs original ideas.
---
This is the most excited I‚Äôve been for a new chapter in a while
---
RT Cameras are really expensive to do, there's no way you'd set a wall of them up like this. Every monitor has to render the game individually, and even if that's at a reduced resolution and graphical fidelity, that's a ***ton*** of parallel rendering and processing.
---
Our the nurse being able to teleport. That's certainly not a human characteristic
---
I thought it was human shape, not human origin. Just due to the animations. 
---
Demogorgon when walking upright is basically human. 
---
Even if they make a four legged running animation, it would be like crouching as an alternate stance.
---
*Slaps You*
---
Laurie, Ash, Myers (at the time), Quentin. We can't really tell with the DBD only characters because usually it says they weren't missing, but the only dead characters outside of that are killers, Bill, and Tapp.
---
Holy shit that looks so good, you should post a video when you get the drill to work, that would be awesome.
---
Mad props, keep up the good work!
---
Who knows what you are talking about lmao.... all Demogorgon merch is this color.
---
Steve is the reincarnation of Carl. He tricked us
---
*hears Walter in the distance*
---
Me: *straight up abandons Eileen*
---
His power is to maybe get an m1. Pretty bland.
---
But the description of the YouTube trailer matches them in season 3 not season 1
---
Hag isn‚Äôt based on a wendigo she‚Äôs entirely Southern hoodoo culture
---
That‚Äôs actually hilarious.
---
How would pinhead work as killer
---
Ok I may get back into it
---
Because she isn‚Äôt
---
Good lord I hope Nancy has other hair options than the one on the main image. I‚Äôve never seen her look that in the show and it‚Äôs horrendous lol.
---
Two really lackluster perks that solve a niche problem no one asked for and a third perk that‚Äôs busted when run as a coordinated 4man squad.
---
I'm getting hyped more and more.
---
They better be handing out some cash to GentleBruce with that mashup
---
Omfg thank you for this!!!$ so excited for this chapter Steve needs a hair perk lol
---
You can't use it if downed. Learned that the hard way.
---
It's a popular show that has been referenced many times in the past. You need to leave this mindset of "popular = bad". I've never watched the show so it feels like an original killer to me.
---
You want even more 10 year olds playing this game?
---
Bright pink ?
---
Oh shit lol been rereading to be ready for the next book and the upside-down has always made me think of the never-never
---
Welp looks like we‚Äôre getting another Leary‚Äôs/the game god awful map to play
---
I mean I never liked the shows but you're kinda in denial if you think stranger things didn't deserve a place in DBD
---
I saw it earlier! Very exciting :)
---
Can we please get a Nicki Minaj chapter
---
We have 2 chainsaw killers, multiple ranged killers, I don't think adding another cloaking one would hurt. Predator has futuristic weapons makes it even better because he had traps that could wrap survivors which would add another element of having to free survivors. He has his own thermal vision which would help with hunting and tracking injured survivors. If you want a projectile, he could toss the knife things he had or even darts for that matter. Predator could mimic people's voices which could have a use. Theres a perk that makes survivors have terror radius, why not allow predator to mimic a injured survivors grunts while hes cloaked. Traps, stealth, projectiles, hunting are all options for that one character
---
*F*
---
My friend there is one really nice thing on Reddit called Flairs which tells you what kind of post it is. And if u had eyeballs üëÄüëÄüëÄ u would see that this is salt/ rage smh.
---
Christ seeing that thing come at you in a foggy map would be horrible.
---
Myers just chillin in the back
---
Stop making killers I must main please.
---
First ghostface, who has one of the most unique abilities and playstyles.
---
Then Reworked freddy, since I was already a Freddy main, and I love his new abilities
---
Now the Demogorgon, which I must main because I adore stranger things, and have been waiting for this chapter for over a year.
---
Yeah, in all honesty I got bored with it. 
---
It felt more like an imitation of 80‚Äôs horror.
---
A lot of atmosphere and music that was trying too hard.
---
Lmfao yes! Goes in dimension tunnel* 'Lol bye bitch have fun with Walter.'
---
What do you mean by "wouldn‚Äôt have been referenced in 5 years"?  The show is still pretty relevant
---
So THAT‚ÄôS how you spell that. Thank you
---
Nothing better than getting outskilled by someone using ds after you had hooked their teammate.
---
Spirit
---
&gt;Is the demigorgon event "intelligent"?
---
Well the Demogorgon is literally only capable of functioning when the mindflayer is controlling it and that's pretty intelligent. As for in lore without a mindflayer around, we do have another spider like creature to do things with.
---
So because you don't target the key holder in any way, the key is bad? And it's not really a free escape if they still did stuff to make it happen. Those gens didn't do themselves.
---
Seanohmorf_uk
---
Well, so much for this...
---
Considering that the licensed killers are not canon to each other (Freddy and Jason are but we have discount Jason in the form of Trapper), I don‚Äôt think that characters being alive in their respective universes matters lore wise.
---
Seriously? Already starting with this? Right in front of my reveal trailer?
---
Could you open it up a bit
---
Season 1 would make more sense since it's the Demigorgon
---
Hadn't thought about that but it'll probably work the same as it does on the current killers
---
Hahahahahaha
---
https://youtu.be/Qmb9cnx__hA
---
Would've rather had this and pyramidhead tbh
---
oh dang thats true. i guessed they used they're season 1 designs cause most people are more familar with it
---
*comes out of tunnel to see Eileen as a human tomato*
---
Me to Eileen: "okay I know you probably been mauled and gun down but, I brought candles!"
---
*Ghost or Walter returns and the cycle continues*
---
It would be more badass if i didn‚Äôt spend half of the match losing people because i got distracted by the knife.
---
I‚Äôm not tryna advertise but a YouTuber named int3r4ct lists all the numbers for the killer addons in his videos
---
Because it would look fucking stupid! And what about kicking generators? And being blinded by a flashlight? It would just look ridiculous.
---
I kinda forgot Barbara‚Äôs existence because she was taken from us too soon
---
nope, it says shitpost smart one. Makes me believe this is a joke post even more
---
What sort of ability/abilities will the demogorgon killer have?
---
It was probably data for stranger things added
---
Killer: Camps entrances. Still good ideas though.
---
Xenomorphs go around sticking people to walls. That's not that different from hooking people.
---
It would be harder to explain why Myers hooks people.
---
No problem. I just say things how they are. Must take a ton of effort and skill to make something that good and it would do good on keychains or some other type of merch.
---
Lol I didnt really care to land the first hit or not because that player was dead either way, but yes F in the chat for that first hit ;)
---
Maybe in the achrive rift thingys they add something voice related
---
I would absolutely lose my mind if they had a Silent Hill chapter!
---
#SLAP
---
It‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Demogorgon‚Äù
---
Dont see why it wouldnt?
---
xD! With her little handbag as protection. When I first played I didn't know what the candles were for so I'd just put them around Eileen..
---
NO WAY!! this is so sick. However I‚Äôm not too sure how I feel about bringing in actual monsters into the game rather than actual people that are killers.
---
I don't know why this was deleted...he's right
---
Fuck even more terrifying
---
No one but the devs knows the answer to this.
---
Ah okay, thanks for the clarification
---
We do not know officially yet.
---
I can already envision you guys just sitting in your chairs using every ounce of will to stop from typing "well actually-" when seeing those
---
Demogorgon is just controlled by the mindflayer, that's why they all "died" when the fate was closed they didn't have a brain to control them. As far as I'm concerned our friendly local spider creature is the source of its intelligence.
---
I don't want Pyrhamid Head, he's James' personal demon from silent hill 2, and doesn't belong to others.
---
There's been so many spirits lately, like I'll get 4 in a row, which is rare for me, I'm not complaining but it was just weird
---
I'm with you on that!
---
I could say something worse. I like Swamp as killer and survivor. I hate ironworks as killer and i hate Myer‚Äôs map as survivor cause i never run Balanced Landing when it pops up.
---
Y3ah I remember that one guy just "boo ho, it's not stranger thing, bhvr could never afford that..." Some other bs thing, but it's ok, i forgive them
---
# slap
---
popular = bad hasn't failed in the past years tho but I agree with you on the new chapter, if you don't know the show just pretend its an original killer.
---
For real...actual horror icon not some teen show
---
Once him and dustin have their scene he becomed the best
---
Why did you show me this? Now am depressed.
---
I think it will be but I still don‚Äôt know which one to pick lol.
---
Honestly once you grind out all of the teachables all survivors are just skins... but yeah like someone already said it‚Äôs confirmed 2 survivors. I guess the devs felt bad not giving us a survivor last chapter
---
Well for one, it seems to require a host (human?) to exist in the first place. and also lmao the trailer I'm dying
---
nancy looks awful, and nothing like the teaser trailer (which made both their faces look far more accurate). 
---
whats with DBD making survivors have funky faces?
---
(Tier 1) Burger King Myers says otherwise üòé
---
From the trailer i would assume some sort of crouch stance is likely.
---
I doubt. I want to believe but it's just tuu hard to believe BHVR would have had the time to balance and code perks for all of them. Having said that i actually hope they didn't...
---
Wow even the stranger things directors were putting in hints it would appear in DBD.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cskomb/time_to_watch_stranger_things_i_guess/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I mean the whole movie felt like some fan attempt for NOES remake.
---
God yes! And the nurse can get a silent Hill cosmetic
---
iT sAyS sHiTpOsT sMaRt OnE. Wowza u are a smart one u figured it out gold star! I am proud of u! Good job good sir you figured out that it is in fact a shitpost good fuckin job!!
---
I mean I see him more as an entity of punishment for many people and prefer the later look as the later silent hills adapted but that's fair enough.
---
Did you see the recent Predator movie? Different factions have different codes. Not all of them have respect for unarmed prey. Just because it's not worthy of being a trophy doesn't mean they can't kill it.
---
Okay this slaps. Been away from DBD for minute but this is bringing me the MINUTE it drops
---
More Mental gameplay like Doctor where he could have a REAL terror radius and not just a heartbeat. Closing the FOV of Survivors as they fall further under his influence. He could have a slowly walk through walls ability for mobility as some demons do. 
---
For weapon they could simply let him bash survivors over the head with the cube. 
---
Also there's the entity... maybe the entity could let him use his influence to make fake generators to injure those who touch them.
---
Literally me playing Demogorgon when it releases
---
I just spent my time cackling "NEW MAP!" in my car during lunch. I'm pretty stoked
---
and robbie the rabbit mascot suit for the clown!
---
Well well well
---
this is like ST:S1 Steve
---
This. The basement is meant to be dangerous and a death sentence if caught down there.
---
lmao right üòÇ
---
Thank You!!!
---
I don't know anything about Stranger Things, but I just want to say, I love the effort they put into trailers. They really pique my interests into the lore of the characters.
---
All single character DLC is $4.99 in the U.S store.
---
Here‚Äôs something to consider,  using DS on a xenomorph is either ineffective due to tough skin or a giant hazard for survs due to acid blood squirting out
---
Sidney was never an option, due to the rights to the scream franchise being tangled up with a child diddler currently.
---
I don't even care about the perks or the killer power. This is gonna be an instant purchase.
---
Just another map for jumpscare myers! The people who should be crying are billy mains
---
His running animation is right from the movie.
---
https://youtu.be/DsK2wKns61Y
---
Im excited for this one!
---
Spirit is one of the best killer in the game and probably THE best one on console. Doctor is just okay. But spirit is harder to learn
---
If you played the tutorial, you'd already know that...
---
The tutorials need to be updated and more in depth now imo
---
I take back everything I said lmao
---
Yeah, I'm just stuck on the original creator's opinions on his creature.
---
The killer-Max's brother Billy, Russian survivor-the one hopper killed in the last episode, Alexei
---
And? More players mean lower queue times (I hope) and probably a longer lifetime for the game. I see no downsides to more players.
---
Alright okay cool. Everyone got their TV show killer. Now sCoOBy dOo WhEN?
---
Dude, I'm almost positive it'll be a store item.
---
Yep.  Took the words outta my mouth.  The game can't be gorey because of the amount of work it would take to do so.  It's not like the devs are just sitting on it, refusing to put it in the game.
---
Hunk: "My extraction point!"
---
Chopper guy: "Front exit gate opening in eta 5 mins."
---
Basically a SWF squad.
---
Like they actually care about new players. If they did I think the matchmaking would be fixed
---
‚ÄúNon-human killer‚Äù
---
I‚Äôd pay big bucks for an Alien collab. Xenomorph killer, and Ripley survivor.
---
That fucks me over so many times because I did it a split second beforehand.
---
Spirit is
---
Stronger 
---
More fun 
---
Mind game 
---
Doctor is 
---
Loop-able 
---
One trick pony 
---
Kind of boring 
---
Bland ability
---
Laurie for that DS. Ash has no redeeming perks whatsoever after they butchered Mettle of Man.
---
The actress usually has soft expressions. Her model has more of a determined face.
---
‚ÄúPutting in licensed work that ultimately takes more time and effort to make is lazy.‚Äù
---
-Literally you.
---
Feng... I‚Äôm sorry little one
---
Lol I‚Äôm gonna feel bad killing scoops ahoy Steve now.
---
The biggest clue I saw was the light turning off down the hall to show the killer was coming. Might be a new mechanic. Might be just trailer fluff.
---
lol no, they surely started making the chapter at the start of season 2
---
Isn‚Äôt that the reason why she didn‚Äôt come. I‚Äôve read that the devs didn‚Äôt want remake Nancy. Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true though
---
Scratched mirror: you're not just wrong, you're stupid
---
Bye meg, the king is coming
---
I hate this show. But I love this game and potentially 6 new perks and a new map has me so excited that I plan on dropping the 10+ bucks this Dlc is gonna cost
---
2 survivors in 1 DLC, this might be a 10$ DLC and also non purchasable with iridescent shards. Rip wallet.
---
He's so clunky to use. I did a little inside everytime I'm slowdown when I'm about to throw a bottle.
---
Flip Flop is quite good when paired with Boil Over. But I admit that it's only useful in certain scenarios. Laurie's perks are better.
---
Bahahhahahahahah
---
lmao ok kiddo. Why don‚Äôt you just say ‚Äúyes it‚Äôs a joke post‚Äù next time?
---
I fucking knew it!!!
---
Tasty air snacks*
---
I‚Äôve met more adults that like Stranger Things than teens lmao
---
I guess she also has OoO
---
I feel like this just means you've been out of the game for a while? Freddy is far from F tier after his rework.
---
I never saw the show, so I'm personally more excited for a nonhuman killer to be in the game and what it could mean down the line. Here's hoping for The Thing and The Xenomorph to be killers down the line!
---
El goblino
---
Sony has Spider-Man rights but that didn‚Äôt prevent a collab allowing him to enter the MCU. Never say never.
---
You memeing with putting rework Freddy at F right? Please say yes
---
I guess that ruins the whole Amanda's stealth ability
---
i‚Äôm just gonna go ahead and say i completely disagree with you there no one can just diss my girl julie like that. julie did not manipulate frank at all. it‚Äôs the complete opposite from that. when you read their story, julie was just a gal that wanted something better in her life and frank saw that. Frank had manipulated each one of those kids for his own power and shaped them into the kids they are now. and when he stabbed that janitor it wasn‚Äôt a rush of panic, it was a a violent urge that came over him. it‚Äôs actually sad a lot of people don‚Äôt see Frank a horrible people and think his actions are okay because he‚Äôs just some kid with some sad life, but really he‚Äôs just toxic person..
---
I'm hyped for more perks, a new killer, and a new map. I haven't seen an episode of Stranger Things in my life(despite having netflix for years) so those perks better be worth it.
---
So, I haven‚Äôt played this in probably 8 months. I‚Äôm genuinely not trying to complain, I‚Äôm just curious if the matchmaking time has sped up at all. It used to take quite a while to get into a game, but I want to come back to the game
---
Did they actually say they are doing the scoops ahoy outfit because if so I‚Äôm fucking excited, I mean I‚Äôm already excited but that‚Äôs the icing on the cake!!!
---
Ok yeah you may be right I shouldn't say teen but you get what I mean
---
I hope this paves the way for a Xenomorph killer.
---
Thanks dude I appreciate u
---
2 sprays when it's DAMP not wet.
---
Bad maps for huntress:
---
 all the farm maps - too big can't pressure the map
---
All the red forest maps - too big can't pressure the map
---
Lery's - too many line of sight blockers
---
The game - too many LOS blockers  also like 20 safe pallets
---
Asylum - asyLUL
---
Mount Ormomd - mount ormond (FUCK THIS MAP) 
---
Haddonfield - OMEGALUL {Fuck this map even more} 
---
Good huntress maps
---
Mcmillans - pretty well balanced although iron works window is still fun
---
Autohavens - killer sided maps all around. blood lodge is pretty rough due to it's size but the loops in the middle are really unsafe against huntress
---
doctor is shit sadly
---
Fnaf has fan of all ages and more players is more players, more money, more for development, Seeing a Freddy fazzbear chase after me or hearing music would creep me out and fit perfectly in this game type in my opinion
---
Except, that‚Äôs not ow the backstory went at all? Lol
---
Naysayers about demogorgon not being human so it wouldn't be in-game can suck it
---
Go educated yourself because Freddy aint F Tier and Hag is better then Ghost Face
---
Pretty sure it has a tail
---
This is art
---
I hope they give skins for different seasons outfits for Steve and Nancy
---
well thats a damn lot of a grind
---
LMAOOOO
---
Me with Jane
---
We need Halloween Redux DLC now!!! Michael costumes and grandma Laurie!!! I‚Äôll be at peace, I‚Äôll never ask for shit again
---
Bruh, if theres no Faberge Organics head cosmetic,I'm gonna hit a demo dog with a fucking bat.
---
Try me, butthead
---
Laurie, she has 2 godly perks
---
It‚Äôd be nice. I want my Scoops Ahoy Steve
---
Thank guy for telling me my friend
---
I bet you feel silly now
---
Flair checks out
---
Yeah, but I mean it makes more sense as Stranger Things is a lot more mainstream than Hellraiser and probably much easier to get the rights to
---
Several of those perks are outright lousy as shit at least mine were meta or meta on specific killers.
---
Autodidact is trash, urban is for immersed useless players, self care probably kills more red rank teamates than Nurse with how much time it wastes, Saboteur literally does nothing at this point read the description post update, detectives hunch is insanely niche, you running a tracking map every game?  Both Poised and Solidarity are quite meh...my list was much stronger man.  Killers do have more quality perks to play with and still be quite strong against good survivors.
---
I get how people say OoO is really good but I don‚Äôt understood it‚Äôs purpose to be honest
---
Ohhh
---
Did she had enduring ?
---
You guys I‚Äôm literally screaming of excitement. I‚Äôm about to play the hell out of Steve and Nancy. Now I need to hardcore farm blood points
---
891 or 893 here. never 892
---
bro where‚Äôd you get those renders
---
I wasn't really trying to blend in I just liked the outfit. Killer ended up coming back and I tried to do the same thing but they found me haha
---

Sadly, it won't be jason. Jason has his own game. It would be cool to see pinhead, chucky, or even jeepers creepers!

And word of God says that Laurie's eyes were adjusting to the dark. HE WAS ALREADY THERE. Enjoy your nightmares.

So defensive over nothing.

First non-human killer opens a lot of doors... they could add urban legend cryptids now too. Very exciting.
---
Sorry but there is no way as konami holds the rights to SH :(

yes!

BUT I'M NOT JUST GOING TO CALL YOU OUT ON YOUR OWN POST,

*if nancy doesn't have any of her dresses from season 3 and just gets to wear a random striped shirt and jeans imma be real slightly perturbed and buy the dlc anyway*
---
Dude the strongest Nerf to killers would be Super Bob.
---
Still tearing up after that one
---
F tier Freddy is because I don‚Äôt usually play him so from experience I‚Äôm just bias and also I haven‚Äôt played him after re work
---
This is literally just noob3‚Äôs tire list with the pig moved down one and ghost face added
---
Nancy need a bit of work but Steve is cool.
---
It should of, but it just slide her backwards, nurse is just broken, literally.
---
You can see the Killers location when your outside the terror radius
---
Hooray.  Now I can continue to sit on this mountain of shards and massive bloodpoint stockpile while waiting until Halloween to buy this shit and Ghostface when it goes on sale.  Yay.
---
Purple guy killer and mike is survivor. It'd be cool to have the animatronics move but not kill you. Or maybe the animatronics would be the killer. Who knows?
---
It's likely they're gonna stay ambiguous regarding exactly *when* they were taken, since we're likely getting cosmetics for them. It's just that these outfits look basic enough to be default outfits.
---
They aren‚Äôt in any particular order other then their so where they are placed within the tier doesn‚Äôt really matter
---
Spirit. If you wanna make it in red ranks, get good with her and get good with her now
---
Well they also see your location
---
~~Friendship ended with Freddy, now Ghostface is my new main.~~

~~Friendship ended with Ghostface, now Freddy is my new main.~~

Friendship ended with Freddy, now Demogorgon is my new main.

I agree with this other then Freddy, he is A
---
Annoying but easy to loop
---
Probably bad connection, do you know her ping?
---
except it kinda is.. sure i can see how Julie ‚Äòmanipulated‚Äô Frank, But frank isn‚Äôt an awesome person either. ‚ÄòTheir time together was the perfect break from the boring conformity of their small, insignificant everyday lives. Frank saw it as an opportunity to shape their lack of experience into something powerful.He lined up nights of debauchery and rampage, testing their limits.‚Äôif you don‚Äôt see this as some form of manipulation then idk what is.

---
Believe it or not this happens to me all the time, even in her bright pink outfit. I'll hide around the wall, crouch in some tall grass, or go past the killer as they turn around. Not much lately tho
---
steve harrington isn't jean ralphio...in case you didn't know. But i see the similarity lmao
---
This would be an incredible crossover but just remember how trash Konami is. They dragged Silent hill down into the mud almost out of spite. For real though they should just do a Jacobs ladder crossover that would be the closest to a James Sunderland survivor we could get lol
---
So it‚Äôs not the same....
---
The real reason the Entity took Doctor.
---
Nope because Demogorgon isn‚Äôt human and has no human affect. Just throw in a random Xenomorph, same thing.
---
Not steve
---
The Predator definitely kills unarmed people. Like in the first movie. When Arnie was unarmed, the pred just took off all his stuff and challenged him to a fist fight instead.
---
Bad idea  
---
He's too huge to be in the game  
---
If you want a monster from Silent Hill, it should be someone like Valtiel
---
F13:TG is dead. It's concurrent player base is &lt;800,even during peak hours.  
---
The best bet for him to be a profitable license is to plug him into a game like DBD, or whatever big Survival Horror type game comes after DBD.  
---
I honestly believe we'll see a Jason chapter this year, and in my opinion it'll be the next chapter.
---
I swear if we dont get a cute little maid outfit for demogorgon. Its a requirement even if it wasnt ever in the show
---
I feel like there's just no way they disrespect Steve like that
---
I mean technically legion,Spirit,clown and plague are free since they aren't licensed
---
buy them all when theyre on sale. halloween is coming up soon
---
If that was it that would be one hell of a mori
---
???
---
Plague, Legion, Spirit and Clown are basically free.
---
Jason is so necessary in this game. Don't think it will happen because he has his own game tho :(
---
I mean, that would be pretty damn cool. 
---
Look, I understand that you really like slasher movies, it's in your username for Pete's sake, but Dead by Daylight isnt a slasher movie. You have plenty of other killers to pick from, having 2 that aren't slashers isn't going to kill you.
---
God damn it!
---
I mean, they are DLC, dont expect fully free DLC unless they state otherwise.
---
first time i saw art i already knew that is gonna be snfw
---
I usually enter panic mode if spirit fury procs.
---
As much as I love this it won't happen due to licencing. Konami are big assholes when it comes to silenthill
---
You can buy some of them ( even survivors too ) with in-game currency that you naturally acquire over play time. It‚Äôs just like a play-reward system.
---
I think he'd be fine but Valtiel is scary too
---
I have a feeling that the demogorgon is likely going to have some sort of sensing power . Maybe it stops moving and senses it surroundings giving notifications of movement and actions in a certain range. Though there was something on leaks by daylight sub the other week that talked about an unseen and oblivious mechanic in the files. A lot of people think it would be for the next chapter's killer
---
Perks I'm not really sure. Typically they are themed on the character. Demogorgon I have no idea but I would assume there will be an obsession perk that like dying light might encourage going after the same survivor. Maybe something regarding bonuses for attacking alone survivors. 
---
Steve is likely going to have altruistic perks or gives bonuses for taking protective hits based on his character in the series . Nancy will likely have something like tapp's detective hunch. Maybe a version of pharmacy but for a map that always gives the ability to show the marked things to all survivors.
---
Will i main two survivors from now on?
---
Yes, i think i will.
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying but you‚Äôre acting like the devs are never gonna put Hellraiser in the game when we frankly don‚Äôt know yet if they will or not.
---
There aren't a lot of lights in the game, but the lights that are there already flicker to indicate an unfinished generator, so that would probably be a pretty unclear signal.
---
Meant to be an antisocial multiplayer game. Not having proper communication is intentional
---
Heh its been like a 4 months break, I can wait a little more
---
They‚Äôre already planning to fix it this next big update.
---
¬ø¬ø¬ø¬ø
---
Eehh he‚Äôs more of a creature
---
Listen you tell anyone I just told you that, your ads is grass, you're dead
---
As a former Doctor main I'd recommend Doc. Great for farming BP, mines salt like crazy, and is absolutely simple to pick up and play. Just make sure to unlock Unnerving Presence teachable from trapper as it synergizes very well with Doctor's ability to put skill checks randomly on the screen, massive TR builds, and with overcharge.
---
I always seem to get a rotation of Macmillan and coldwind farm maps so the Game is always nice to get. And at least you can find gens on that map unlike Lery's.
---
I know they cancelled what could have been a major success out of pettiness .-.
---
Considering every single chapter has had one surv and one killer, and considering the fact that steve and Nancy aren't exactly too much of a pair anymore (john and nancy would've made much more sense), it would've been a shot in the dark to have said there would be two survs prior to the trailer, especially if you guessed it would've been steve and nancy
---
Scoops Troop, deploy!
---
Love it
---
I feel we'll get pinhead eventually.
---
He knew it was there and let you have it.
---
I would prefer keeping the furry community far away from the things I love
---
Well good, I was thinking it was spoilers lol I haven't watched S3 yet
---
i kinda just thought you did since you said everyone shits on him when usually i see people horny for him so i just thought so lol. They were so willing because they had nothing else in their lives, nothing else to do. It wasn‚Äôt because they were willing or anything, it‚Äôs just Frank was the one that brought it up and they just rolled with it. I think susie of all people were extremely against the concept, but since Julie was by his side, she just couldn‚Äôt say no. The last sentence , testing their limits, isn‚Äôt really.. friendly. not something a friend would exactly do to their friends. Another thing is the fact he ordered them to stab that man without an argument or protest his words makes me believe he has manipulated these kids. They just sucked it up and did it.
---
No, thats whats its like for all Australians. My friends and their friends and everyone in the Australian dbd community has green ping around 60-90 even when playing with people nearby. yellow is 150 and red is 200. 
---
And even in other games, Australians have higher ping than Americans. I know Americans get ping at 15ms or something small like that but 60 is standard for good ping in the west.
---
Pretty sure they‚Äôre just gonna be skins and share the same perks, like legion
---
I‚Äôm happy, might go out to eat, how are you feeling?
---
I just hope he‚Äôs not another stealth killer
---
I'm sorry, new here, who's Bubba?
---
Have they stated anything regarding a release date?
---
I Think I Got Eye Cancer From Your Writing Style.
---
Why Are You Typing Like This, Its Really Hard To Read
---
Things like Pumpkinhead, the Xenomorph or even a Werewolf (albeit in their own version) would be a fun addition imo.
---
Yeah I mean it isn't true horror. But I love stranger things and I think it'll work. Still more scary than chavy legion.
---
You have a different interpretation than me and that‚Äôs fine. We don‚Äôt have to agree with each other.
---
Huntress herself is great, the newer maps are not good for her. The only maps she's good on are Autohaven and (less so lately because they added a lot of trees) Macmillian. 
---
Most of the realms are massive, Spirits map, Ormond, Red forest, Swamp. She's 110% with no movement speed ability, this really hurts her map pressure because she has to slowly walk everywhere.
---
 All of the DLC maps are bad for her because there are hardly any loops she can throw over.
---
She hereself is a good killer, but the maps are awful for her.
---
The game isn't F2P so why would there be?
---
Stop being cheap.
---
Jigsaw himself
---
Why didn‚Äôt he just let me go out the regular way then?
---
bruh the first scenario i mentioned was hypothetical. the second one (where the hatch hadn‚Äôt spawned) actually happened.
---
‚ÄúHoly shit, are you *Ash Williams?‚Äù*
---
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. That‚Äôs me baby.‚Äù
---
I watched a video about how it was a possibility and I thought it was just a fever dream
---
Most messed up, Freddy. Pedophilia is fucked up. Michael never did any of that.
---
Lmao üòÇ I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt write rants often
---
I‚Äôm keeping my bing bong bitchass 5 miles away from there.
---
Sorry lol üòÇ
---
Oh dude I woke up, opened my phone, saw a notification from the YouTube channel with the trailer, and immediately jumped out of my bed freaking out.
---
Play the game the way you like to play it. If someone enjoys killing the 4 survivors asap, then let them.
---
Autodidact is not weak whatsoever lmao! literal heals people in no time. Urban is handy as fuck to lose killers, detective's hunch has netted me the hex totems more than I can count. Some of the perks on your list weren't all that powerful either tbh. You underestimate some survivor perks while overestimating killer ones.
---
Damn I feel sorry for you
---
Yeah lol
---
i guess they could always give 3 perks per web instead of 2, and then it takes the 2 you didn't choose as the first step. but yes sometimes i'm doing like 50 levels of level 50+ just to get the final perk i want
---
I fucking remember that holy shit, I chose the French on accident and lost every battle
---
Booo
---
u/VredditDownloader
---
For all the other DLCs, probably. Stranger Things DLC, very unlikely.
---
Sounds like a roundabout way of trying to shame killers for doing their objective.  
---
&gt;You're supposed to be an interesting horror movie bad guy doing... Horror movie bad guy things.
---
Like putting them on hooks and letting a spider-god-thing eat them.
---
Hell, this is me with the Endgame collapse.
---
r/TIHI
---
They've never made an original chapter with only one killer before. If there's only one character in the chapter it's usually because of licensing issues or because the killer just doesn't have an iconic related survivor (or killer, like with Ash). The devs don't put in less content just for the fun of it. I don't see them not adding an original survivor just because they're lazy, but them not adding a survivor with Pinhead or Jason would make sense

Well then Dream On, brother
---
he just wants to play favorite characters and some of the best perks are for bought-only characters. What‚Äôs wrong with wanting a free one?
---
As someone who‚Äôs never seen an episode of stranger things can someone give me a quick rundown on who these people are and what to expect from them
---
Nancy looks pissed
---
I have no idea if they will or won't. In no way do I think they don't know about Hellraiser. Maybe they already tried and hit a wall. \[or got trapped in a maze o.O\]
---
I was just posting this to let out my "I wanna see Hellraiser added" in a less toxic and more jovial spirit kind of way. Also wanted to see the response, curious of those who do and don't support the new addition preview.
---
maybe it lights up and stays lit? idk that'd be pretty cool if they could pull something like that off.
---
The game isn‚Äôt really built for amazing graphics
---
Lol nice. I found out from some discord friends and I watched it immediately
---
100% Accurate
---
The DLC is already dirt cheap ????
---
I think the problem with Plague is her skill curve vs the curve to play against her. By the time you get good enough with her vomit that getting her special vomit is a threat, you're probably going against survivors that know to never cleanse and you become a pretty useless M1 killer.
---
&gt; Asylum - asyLUL
---
This speaks to my very soul and makes it cry.
---
I watched it when I still had crust in my eyes lol, was blurry the first time haha
---
Babysitters best advice
---
It‚Äôs in the swamp
---
Honestly thought those red bits were tits for a seconds considering that how alot of people draw um tits with a bit of red at the end
---
They could‚Äôve done something like Wrong Turn or Hellpriest or The Ring or something.
---
What are the Archives?
---
Take aggro from the killer and loop them for as long as you can.
---
Sometimes I have to chase the killer and he just ignores me.
---
**they better not**
---
Lol I'm so excited
---
Then he should buy the characters?  
---
Games.  Are. Not.  Free.
---
But this one is totally sfwüòâ
---
Clearly, the game has gotten bigger ever since so it‚Äôs obviously going to be lower
---
I'm kinda sad as I want an original killer
---
*An Interdimensional Killer...*
---
What is true horror?
---
PLease please let us get the scoops ahoy costume. I haven't bought a auric cell yet but will for sure if we get the scoops ahoy cosmetic.
---
To be honest, I thought they looked like play-do faces in the teaser, these renders are much better. But in both cases I think she suffers from Meg face.
---
Same lol I'll probably go for Steve first, but so will most others so maybe do Nancy then Steve to flex on the people that aren't gonna play as her
---
Steve ‚Äúthe hair‚Äù Harrington main already.
---
I am going to buy all of them dude.I need a discount
---
Ah the wording made it come off as one story
---
Peanits stated on Twitter that they each have 3 unique perks
---
It always was like that for me :/
---
*Laughs in Pig*
---
Ouchie.
---
it's adorable!
---
friendship ended with all survivors
---
Steve and Nancy only
---
I for one, am very excited. I agree completely. Humans are cool but monsters invoke a special kind of fear in people. We all have the fear of waking up to a window breaking down stairs. But the bigger fear is what in gods name broke the window?
---
thanks for hopeful words my dude
---
***d e m o g o r o g a n***
---
The Demogorgon isn‚Äôt even an alien, it‚Äôs an inter dimensional being like Slenderman. It‚Äôs not even from space

This Particular Comment Didn't Age Too Well
---
yeah it‚Äôs all good. my fault for bad wording. literally typed that at 2 AM about 2 minutes after i turned my PC off so i was just hella salty and bitching about it lol
---
Yea just like Ghost face he took a while huh lul
---
Don't give me that bullshit these guys have lost their drive a while ago they get a headstart with "Stranger things" now they can come up with shitty low effort perks and powers.
---
So much work and effort btw -Literally you.
---
&gt;he just wants to play favorite characters and some of the best perks are for bought-only characters. What‚Äôs wrong with wanting a free one?
---
Which "best perks" are you talking about exactly?
---
**Myers**: **Save The Best for Last**, **Play with Your Food** and **Dying Light**.
---
**Freddy**: **Fire Up**, **Remember Me** and **Blood Warden**.
---
**Pig**: **Hangman's Trick**, **Surveillance** and **Make Your Choice**.
---
**Ghost Face**: **I'm All Ears**, **Thrilling Tremors** and **Furtive Chase**.
---
**Leatherface**: **Knock Out**, **Barbecue &amp; Chilli** and **Franklin's Demise**. 
---
The only perk I can see here that can be considered the "best" is BBQ but even this, his DLC is not even a full priced one. At a discounted price its a cheap buy. So much for "some of the best perks", like realistic 1.
---
I checked and apparently it's ghostface with 67k  
---
wonder if this will eventually pass it
---
and you've been given an option to get originals by playing the game
---
They better
---
Anyone know if the servers are coming with the new chapter? Or after. Kind of looked like with in the the road map
---
As if they‚Äôre not fixing bugs?
---
What are you looking for in a killer? New perks, memes, try harding for the 4k?
---
But more often than not, you can say that's a mori~
---
Ive been up for 14 hours just because of the tweet about games on and someone said the trailer will happen tomorrow and by God it was worth it
---
YES, EXACTLY! THE DEMOGORGON IS A MONSTER AND NO ONE IS AFRAID OF THESE HUMAN KILLERS, BUT THIS NEW CHAPTER COULD BE EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED TO GET A LITTLE FEAR FACTOR. IM SORRY FOR ALL CAPS I'M JUST REALLY EXCITED!!
---
I think it‚Äôs going to be a cosmetic part of the map, like the red heat in Freddy‚Äôs furnace. I don‚Äôt know how much upsidedown will play in mechanics, simply due to the work to make it accurate, simple frame-wise AND distinct from dreamworld.
---
I want to go in high ranks (red will be extreme so let‚Äôs say purple) and have fun at the same time
---
Exactly how we all end our DbD sessions lol in pure frustration
---
Note: not a real screenshot but my good ole computer can barely handle dbd so I rather take pics with my phone.
---
Well now i gotta watch stranger things
---
New emotes maybe?
---
Za WARUDO
---
I know that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre meant to do but I‚Äôve seen that happen once or twice, where waving arms is a warning. I see it used more as a ‚Äúno one is coming‚Äù or ‚Äúhurry up and unhook‚Äù
---
I AM TOO. I LOVE NANCY AND AM EXCITED FOR WHAT NEW ADDITIONS MIGHT COME AFTER OUR FIRST MONSTER KILLER!
---
SCOOP TROOP REPRESENT
---
It is not. 
---
You can get banned for disconnecting multiple times in a row, occasional disconnects are not bannable.
---
Oh wow. I am actually impressed. Im kust afraid we'll get another MoM or three useless perks
---
What's the point in arguing if you're just going to give up?
---
the demogorgon makes me uncomfortable, which is perfect
---
Oh stop this. Sidney was never possible because Behaviour does not have the rights to the scream franchise, they have the rights to the ghostface mask.
---
Woops deleted the comment you replied to here, my bad. Also yes I addressed that the middle building is an issue but thats not where the majority of the gens are so you can play around it. Also the thing about big maps is that you either play around your Ruin or you play around your 3 gen setup.
---
I have been away from the game for a couple of months ( ages to connect only to end up in a game with an ahole camper), but i am coming back for my Steve for sure.
---
shut up you fucking idiot
---
I‚Äôve done this countless amounts of times and it always makes me laugh
---
time to farm for blood points
---
How about you stop complaining and enjoy the game
---
Dead meme
---
I'm not arguing that's that the point..
---
'
---
Your an idiot
---
Does this mean 6 new survivor perks?
---
I‚Äôd give both of you awards if I wasn‚Äôt poor
---
I may die, but damn, you're working for it.
---
Steve‚Äôs probably my favorite character
---
So nobody gonna talk about how dope that theme sounded?
---
Thought so, thanks fam
---
We'll know when they release the price.
---
I‚Äôm getting dragged for everything wrong with this post And I can‚Äôt stop laughing
---
I hope the Mori is the dema biting their head off
---
There are people who still don‚Äôt have Netflix? O.o

I love that I got this news for this sub hehe

Yea i meant the crotus prenn asylum, i just forgot to add the chappel to the good maps. Asylum is still the strongest single structure in the game though
---
But what if it's real? *stranger things new season intro starts playing*
---
I had a credit on my account that I recently used for leather face. I bought him to get bbq and chili,  and I didn't regret it. I'm getting close to 50k blood points a match. Also, I'm really enjoying leather face. He was awful until I got some useable perks on him. Now he's fun
---
Maybe Army of Darkness but Evil Dead 1 and 2 were definitely horror movies.
---
Also I watched all the Saw movies just because of the DbD chapter. Dunno why, I didn't really like any apart from the first one.
---
I expected ‚Äúyour finally awake‚Äù
---
he died that Steve may live to die repeatedly.
---
Wow, thank you very much! This guide is sooo useful :3
---
yeah, but usually it's worth nothing if you've found it in the chest
---
I‚Äôm maining both at the same time
---
I don‚Äôt like the show but I‚Äôm still super hyped for this
---
How about stop complaining and support the dev's for a good game it dosen't hurt to give back if you enjoy the game
---
I agree, but to be fair, that is what it looks like in real life.

They are, it‚Äôs true. But they haven‚Äôt fixed a lot of stuff that have been problems for a long time. There‚Äôs a lot of game breaking bugs that have existed for months (and even years) now that they still haven‚Äôt fixed. And a lot of the bugs they have fixed are bugs that they caused when they update things because of the spaghetti code.

Why not? I feel like it would be an interesting mechanic to force the survivors to go in and out of the Upside Down, potentially breaking up strategies of massive Gen rushing or camping a hook.
---
This man knows my train of thought. Excuse me while I read every ounce of detail I can find on the ST update.
---
1) thank you for your very insightful response 
---
2) I think I was mainly looking for a comparison to characters in the past, like how much did ghostface cost when he first came out, or the plague, is it more than the usual 500?
---
Does anyone else feel like the stranger things setting actually correlates pretty well to the dbd setting? Like I can picture all the maps as the upside down counterpart to the real world locations and the survivors and killers being people who got pulled in and trapped like Will Byers
---
Idk how I didn‚Äôt immediately think of Steve‚Äôs scoops ahoy cosmetic. If it‚Äôs not in the game I‚Äôm gonna be a lil sad, but we get Steve anyways so.
---
I‚Äôm not going to cast any doubts or preemptive praise quite yet. I‚Äôll be waiting until the PTB to cast my stone.
---
yeah that's up to us to trust or not trust to OP about this
---
Honestly imagine that Asylum hasn't had a single change in what, three years? Even a bad looper can hold the killer there for 2-4mins
---
EXCITEDNESS!!! I LOVE BOTH STEVE AND NANCY AND JUST HAJSHWUZSVZUVDHX EXCITED FOR THE DEMOGORGON KILLER! I WISH I COULD PLAY THE PTB BUT I PLAY ON CONSOLE EHHHHHHH I AM HAVING STRANGER THINGS WITHDRAWAL!
---
I mean, to my credit, it would of worked if she WAS phasing.
---
*tips fedora* thank ya
---
Empathy is also good for finding other survivors. They have to be injured for empathy to work, but injured survivors need more help than healthy ones
---
At least a xenomorph would actually be cool and scary instead of this plant head we're getting. I can only assume they got the license for ST because it was cheaper than any other licenced killer/creature. 
---
It probably cost them much more to get just the GF mask than this whole new chapter. But since people love anything that's trending, BHVR had to go with the flow. Maybe next time we get the Night King from GoT.
---
I mean... one possible reason, of many, is that the next chapter has no survivor, because this one has two.
---
This was an intention disconnect to give an unfair advantage to the survivor. That is against the ToS of the game..... Read the rest of the thread people have stated more then this. Its reportable and even bannable
---
The Demodog is just a younger Demogorgon
---
Come to think of it that‚Äôs a good question...
---
Steve and Nancy are two high schoolers/recent graduates (depending on what season you watch). Nancy has kind of an investigative vibe, as she drives around tracking down clues and works for the town newspaper in s3. She‚Äôs also lost someone to the demogorgon, so there‚Äôs that. Steve is a little bit goofier in character. He‚Äôs been the bad boy, the de facto babysitter, and slightly aimless-but-figuring-life-out person across seasons. I could see Nancy having perks that relate to knowledge and Steve having perks that relate to helping the group, but that‚Äôs just conjecture on my part
---
Yeah I totally agree
---
Yeah. I have a hard time playing Claudette because she screeches like a banshee when she gets hooked. As killer i walk away even if there are survivors nearby just because i can‚Äôt stand it.
---
It can bite gen and pallet or smash them with the tail why not. Flashlight makes zero sense though, so yeah, ridiculous and stupid
---
So u think knowing on which generator is being worked on is weak ?
---
Nancy, Steve, and the Demogorgon.
---
He's not broken.
---
Dream Snares are easily seen and avoided sometimes, if there's something you absolutely need to vault you'll probably get caught, but that doesn't mean the ability is broken
---
Dream Pallets are easily avoided if you take note of which ones are there while you're awake
---
His teleport takes a long time without addons so as long as you don't give him line gens, you'll have enough time to work while he's walking to your gen
---
I've played both as Freddy and against him and this is just my viewpoint
---
It's not impossible for the devs to animate a single tail. And it's not like the Alien needs air vents to charge at you (ex. Alien Isolation) The Xenomorph is entirely possible to come to the game.
---
Well the reason they make mediorce perks is well there's only so much you can do without people getting mad and keeping a balanced so they're in a hard place right now but I more so care about the characters then some perks
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt think so. They have never said anything like that and why do you think they have separate names?
---
He hit your toe
---
Lots of juicy baby‚Äôs to feed me
---
should have cropped the unnecesary beginning tho
---
Don't steal my 2 minutes of work you monster
---
Those are some pretty nifty changes, I assume the game became a little healthier since I stopped playing, thanks for the answer dude :D
---
If you're just going to use legion as a bp machine then don't bother, save your shards. While they are great bp generation with stuff like distressing and beast of prey they might be weaker on consoles where 360 juking actually works as it will take you out of power and stun you if you miss.
---
The hag was previously human though.
---
I prefer Aftercare because if the information given to you. It helps knowing where your people are so you can meet up. Also helps when someone is in a chase so you know where to avoid or when to go tag out and take aggro
---
PTB is estimated to possibly be next week since the chapter officially comes out early September
---
Basically a mirror world called the upside down l has been discovered by people, in this world otherworldly creatures live, they are able to enter our world through a door way.
---
Thats not really guaranteed, when you are a killer you dictate the flow of a chase, sure the survivor will run in a loop, but the way you follow them is how their exit route is chosen, you can push them either away from it, or perpendicular. The issue for huntress is having to stop to refill if you miss a lot gives them the opportunity to cover the open ground between loops and the main building.
---
If you combine Stephen King Lite (especially something like Firestarter I think) and the 80s vibe from E.T., it‚Äôs kind of like that.
---
Nah just storing it in the wank bank
---
Yea Carl was a big craze during the trailer reveal and the map. Feels bad
---
Thrilling tremors is used by a number of high rank players, its a borderline meta perk. I'm all ears isnt fantastic, but it actually works dang well for certain builds.
---
you're really living up to the name here
---
Yeah that‚Äôs, Rob :)
---
They LITERALLY said that they were younger demogorgons in the show idiot
---
Literally all dlcs (non licensed) can be free now if you get enough shards to earn them
---
Apparently Demogorgon is even taller than the trapper. Am i wrong?
---
I do dlc reviews on YouTube if you have the time here‚Äôs a playlist covering leatherface, Myers, Pig, Spirit, And Ghostface. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOVWgcA4q6FKRqOwRvU_N-5gpi92mXjdI
---
Oh wow. Thanks!
---
Autodidact and botany stack? How's the speed?
---
idiot rekt
---
No.
---
Not just them, hag and doctor too
---
I personally don‚Äôt mind her but she isn‚Äôt one of my favorites
---
This is what will bring me back to play this game again... Super stoked.
---
Oh!! I kept reading about Carl the cashier and almost asked about it. Now everything is connecting :)
---
Show me where does it say that singular instance of disconnecting on purpose is bannable.
---
The rest of the thread isn't providing any proof either, they are saying it's bannable where there is no proof that disconnecting in singular instances is bannable/reportable. You can see streamers disconnecting intentionally live on stream WITH DEVELOPERS IN THE CHAT and they do not get banned for those singular instances of disconnecting.
---
As it is currently you can only get banned if you disconnect a ton of times in a row.
---
I love them both but each to their own lol
---
I fucking need this
---
Oh how the table turns have tabled!
---
They‚Äôre changing the bloodweb
---
Soooo what? theyve never once stated that killers had to be human, just that they had to be humanoid, which the demogorgon is. And the reason for that isnt even a lore thing, its that making an entire new skeleton frame for just one killer is too much work.
---
So I should tunnel the key holder? Cause I never said I don't go after people with keys, but that doesn't change how bs they are, and with that thought Morris sent free kills cause the killer has to hook them which is having to do stuff to get it to work
---
Yea still sad he wasn't used. He was mighty thicx
---
Every character did, in fact, take a while to make.
---
&gt;Don't give me that bullshit these guys have lost their drive a while ago they get a headstart with "Stranger things" now they can come up with shitty low effort perks and powers.
---
Where is any of this coming from, exactly?
---
But not adding Demogorgon would fuck up earnings of behaviour. So money&gt;lore
---
Depends on gameplay preferences. I love Legion but I use Huntress, Ghost Face or Michael to get bp
---
The others you need to play the game a lot or buy the dlc
---
yeah it got much healthier, and i almost forgot, if someone disconnected in the loading or first minute of the match, it stops the match and gives all your addons/items back like the match never happened
---
There‚Äôs no excuse for bugs to exist for so long. If fortnite can fix bugs within a couple days, behaviour can do it.
---
Kinda forgot as I'm a console gamer
---
What about the lanky boy Slender Man ?
---
I forgot about that, but that still wouldn‚Äôt work because it‚Äôs a full grown demogorgon not a dog
---
Its not dumb its more like a thing of having no morale
---
ok, "equal power" was a wrong phase to use. My problem isn't the power level tho. Entity taking Pennywise would be strange because they are the same kind of power. It just doesn't really feel right
---
I was pretty adamant that the Ghost Face chapter should not be counted as a real chapter, but this adds enough content to make up for it.
---
Thrilling Tremors actually rocks
---
I think you can still get to the asylum from anywhere in the map if you don't mind getting hit on the way. I know how zoning works but this map is just awful in design and practice
---
And what exceeds an asshole? Because there are people who are far worse than me.
---
Oh ok.
---
It's just that all previous killers have been human or previously human, now they're adding in some sort of weird alien thing and it just ruins the consistency and makes it feel more fake.
---
Demogorgon is kind of different from Xenomorph though. The background lore for the demogorgon kind of parallels with the background lore in dbd, whereas the xenomorph is just an alien in space (?). And clickers more an effect of an apocalyptic event
---
I usually run botany knowledge to counter the regression penalty of an autodidact when stacks 1-3, and make heals 33% faster so that I don't end up making a heal last longer than it should and risking my teammate getting spotted and killed.
---
So?? They can just make a new animation. It‚Äôs not like this is gonna be canon to the show.
---
Try reading their TOS xD maybe you'll learn a thing or two.
---
Well, given that bhvr's gotten cosmetics for Saw and Ash, it's not unreasonable to assume that Stranger Things is getting them too.
---
Okay, you don't have to play it then. 
---
Also Why Do You Capitalize Every Single Word You Write It Is Annoying As Hell
---
Yeah especially the fact that there is two survivors
---
Well, the demagorgon didn't, the pups and meat monsters did
---
But then he pulls out unnerving making you miss.
---
But then again, the previous chapter also didn't have a survivor. The chapters followed the same formula for 3 years, the only exception being this new ST chapter. It possible that they change that formula but you can probably see why I think it's likely the next chapter is licensed, right? You don't have to agree with me but you at this point you understand why I personally think it will be a licensed chapter
---
I play on the Xbox. The queue isn't bad. I don't notice any frame rate problems. It gets laggy sometimes. Hopefully that will be better when they release dedicated servers. Dead by Daylight is on game pass
---
How fast is autodidact with 5 stacks? 8sec?
---
The survivor perks are definitely going to suck. That's pretty much a given at this point.
---
I would like to see how a tall demogorgon massively larger than the survivors does that for a mori
---
it actually is a pretty cool and fair system to but characters with shards if compared to most games
---
I haven't played this game I. A while and I'm coming
---
I‚Äôm sad S3 billy isn‚Äôt the killer
---
Yeah
---
You earn these by leveling up your account in game; this lets you buy non-licensed characters and outfits. 
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Iridescent_Shards
---
For licensed characters you need to pay for them.
---
I hate the game both as killer and survivor. As killer, it's annoying because I never know if that generator I hear is on the same floor as me, so I waste a bunch of time if I'm anybody but the Nurse, and as survivor, I feel like I'm just constantly hearing the terror radius.
---
The gang gets strange
---
A perk difference of 7 is offset by a power difference of about 12. killers have powers on top of perks, survivors rely on a small pool of viable perks. this isnt a problem.
---
You can buy a bunch of characters with shards. The devs need to make money. Stop being a cheapass and wanting everything for free.
---
Thank you for both of the answers. 
---
Both if them make sense, and I really like the food and seasoning analogy. Thank you very much for the help my friend!
---
Are you happy with his rework?
---
I honestly thought it would happen for that reason. I actually figured either BHVR was being contracted to make a Stranger Things mobile game, or they got the rights to someone from that show Slasher. 
---
If the Demogorgon is weak, I'll riot.
---
If you got a skillcheck immediately at 5 stacks it would fill the progression bar by 50% for healing, and since healing takes around 20 seconds, with botany would probally take around 8-6 seconds
---
The per pee poo poo man
---
Although I'm definitely bummed out that the survivor wasn't Hopper (&gt;!considering that he'd be a reasonable fit due to his death in S3)!&lt;), I'm just glad that we got TWO survivors who I believe will have their own unique set of perks. And who wouldn't love to play Steve in DBD?
---
Thats the one thing I can't STAND about Jane. I play with my volume really high when i dont have my headphones on and it sounds sooooo bad when she's hit or hooked.
---
You have to admit they didn't test legion or Ghostfaces abilities at all considering how broken they were
---
U do realise that reaching a ping like 30 is impossible for this game duo the way its getting hosted
---
Making people salty is fun for me so yea I facecamp
---
I can't wait to be a Nancy main
---
This is so good for the health and growth of this game. Not only does it give us already playimg the game more to work for.
---
But you can pretty much guarantee that this is going to attract fans of the show to try this game out. Im so happy the devs pulled this off.
---
Didn't mean to be condescending with zoning but Huntress more than most other killers has good means at keeping them away imo. I agree though that the map is shit, I just personally don't think its an unbeatable map.
---
If you could choose between having the Legion or Jekyll and Hyde, as a killer, who would you choose?
---
Or just Xenu.
---
Scientology killer confirmed.
---
It's not gonna be tomorrow. On the website they said they're going to do an in-depth stream this coming Thursday where they reveal the power/perks.
---
Lego and pepto bismol kill more people per annum than the Legion.
---
I dont, at all. The fact is, we are now even more survivor heavy than we were previously, skipping a survivor next chapter pushes us a bit back towards even. Maybe its liscensed, but again, there is nothing indicating that yet.
---
me boutta smash that demogorgon be like
---
No worries, accidents happen.
---
&gt; Also the thing about big maps is that you either play around your Ruin or you play around your 3 gen setup.
---
Thing is that those two are entirely based on the survivors. If they are good, they will do the gens through ruin &amp; they will have enough map awareness not to 3 gen themselves. You can't sit around 3 gens all game either, as that will burn too much time and let the survivors do gens for free.
---
Monsieur knows what perversion is
---
Wow your so funny
---
Won't know till he goes up on the PTB or we see in on an old map
---
Imagine being that bootlicker guy that sucks up to the devs for no reason, I‚Äôd hate to be you lol
---
Now we wait for a salty killer main to say *‚ÄúWHY DID THEY GET 2 SURVIVORS, THIS GAME CATER SURVIVORS OMG‚Äù*
---
I don't really consider Michael Myres , Bubba , Amanda (pig) or ghost face horror films myself they strike me as more thriller/slasher and in my opinion stranger things fits in the thriller category quite nicely and the Demogorgon I find much more scary than a tall man with a kitchen knife or a small woman wearing a pig head . 
---
I think that stranger things fits in more with DBD than any of those as it already has established otherworldly realms much like the entity has its own realm .
---
nobody knows, wait until the ptb drops and you'll know, not sure where you got told they would be taller than trapper
---
My head canon is that it's a bit like the TV show once upon a time.
---
In which the licenced characters all exist in their own parallel universes or realms.
---
But in the main world, where the OC DBD characters come from, the stories of the licensed characters are immortalised in fiction, hence people can know about them.
---
Yeah, was pretty sure it wasnt going to be tommorow, as I said, but those are the timing options.
---
Legion, lost count how many times I got 32000 using them.
---
Here is an animated 3 minute video about seasons 1 and 2, but it looks like the chapter is centered around season 1.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M6qfBtnvR4
---
I read that on PC you can stop prolonged looping with Doctor if you time your stuns right to stop them from pallet vaulting and switch quickly to treatment mode to get a hit but I think it takes longer switching on console
---
Whos gonna tell him?
---
Stranger things is probably the biggest tv show in the world right now. I doubt the demogorgan was much cheaper than predator or pennywise would be also The demogorgan was also a heavily requested character
---
I know you are just joking around but it needs to be said (as others have) that the devs care a lot about this game and are always working very hard to improve it. DBD has improved vastly since 2016 and I‚Äôm confident it will continue to do so. The bugs are just meme fodder as this point. We all know they come with the territory.
---
They... do? They work on the game. Are you that ignorant? Do you not at least skim the patch notes? Ever? Just a few patches ago they fixed like 40+ bugs. &gt;_&gt;
---
Spirit can easily play in red ranks, and comes with a few decent perks. Shes also pretty fun to play, although she does take practice. You basically have to rely on hearing/scratch marks.
---
Doctor is one of my favorite killers, tho he struggles in higher ranks. Lots of different ways to play him, and has a built in tracking ability with the constant screaming. Probably the one i have the most fun with. Also has 2 decent perks.
---
The Plague is another really fun killer to player. At high ranks its hit or miss. Survivors will either cleanse, turning you into huntress with a mini-gun and making it an easy win. Or they stay broken all game, turning you into a simple m1 killer. Has mediocre niche perks, but still some value.
---
Clown, i honestly don't play him. He is considered one of the weaker killers, he does have a few decent perks. 
---
Legion, I also dont play, and is considered to be the weakest killer in game. His perks are all niche use, other than discordance.
---
Susie-pa-tootie.
---
I remember being 12
---
Comparing him with the doors on the trailer he seems gigantic
---
Pinhead wasn't even the villain in the first movie though
---
which platform do you use if I may ask? And have you ever tried BP farming with Doctor?
---
Am I the only one who doesn't particularly want an Eleven character? Idk. I love the idea, but I feel like the fans favourite the guy chosen for dead by daylight. And Nancy's.. Well, Nancy. (sorry about "the guy chosen". Not a huge Stranger Things junkie and genuinely forgotten his name even though I literally just read it in this post).
---
Elevena great, but just not what I invision. I wouldn't mind an offering or something relating to her, such as Judith Myers having an offering (again, can't remember what it was but I think it was a book or a diary or something?). I think those kind of things are really nice, and especially would be nice for avid fans of the series.
---
I did read it when this same discussion happened months ago. 
---
Nowhere does it say that a separate instance of intentional disconnection will get you banned. Again, you are not showing me any proof that it is bannable besides "because I've said so".
---
You are the same path
---
It's is absolutely another stealth killer,  The Demogorgon in the show lurks around in a shadow dark dimension and jumps into ours t6o pounce on wounded prey.
---
BHVR said that remember summer doesn't end till September 21st so most people have taken that as confirmation that they will be out by then. Though I feel it is most likely going live with the next patch going live.
---
can't wait to flex that glorious hair
---
Thrilling tremors is pretty situational. If survivors are on a gen, it doesn't proc. So it doesn't stop gen progress. If they aren't on a gen they are probably do totems or going for a hook safe. Just a wasted slot IMO.
---
I like it, I like that the devs keep supporting this game. I like you. There some positivity for the day
---
What does that have to do with anything? They've been fixing their game for a long time, and they've had big licenses before.
---
And if they dont suck they'll get nerfed within a month
---
r/chrissimpsonsartist
---
Dude just carrying a fucking baby dwight like a fooken bone.
---
I thought part of the whole mystery with the entity is how it further corrupted these "already corrupted humans" and turning them into monster/human hybrid servants.
---
Not full blown demonic monster like. I mean, yeah, i'm personally upset the devs keep going "We're not gonna do x and y EVER!!! It doesn't fit the lore!" and then just going and dubbing this fine because of the money it brings it.
---
But I love stranger things and Overwatch has been in a great state so I just don't give a fuck what the devs do anymore. It's their game not mine.
---
Go to 30 seconds
---
I personally like Meg and Kate‚Äôs voice acting but Jake also has good voice acting. I feel like all of them felt it but felt it differently because of their backgrounds. Meg was into sports so she would have a higher pain tolerance and someone like Laurie has been chased her whole life and attacked so she would be quieter and have a super high pain tolerance. Obviously, i haven‚Äôt played every character so i wouldn‚Äôt know everything but those seem like the would be the quietest.
---
I for one do not enjoy stranger things, I find it cheeses. But it has a huge following so it‚Äôs cool a lot of people will be stoked about this and hopefully expanse the DbD fan base
---
Cry about it üòÇ
---
Fun Fact: The three largest salt deposits in the world are Overwatch, Dead by Daylight, and the Ocean.
---
The biggest issue with The Game is how absurdly large and empty it is on both floors which makes slow M1 killers even worse. 
---
On the flipside I love the set pieces like the garbage chute or planning room and how you can slink around between floors, but honestly it needed to be just one floor with a couple of lower passages to make an alternative to simply staying on the one floor that has most of the gems.
---
if you want the lore of the characters that will be added in the game:
---
* The Demogorgon is a monster of an other dimension called The Upsidedown, humans opens a portal to that world and now it lurks in the "normal" world.
---
* Steve starts as a douchebag but quickly becomes one the most beloved character because he spends 90% of the show with the kids and kicks Demogorgon's ass with a bat.
---
* Nancy is kinda forgettable, she gets her best friend killed cuz she wants to fuck steve, tries to avenge her friend she indirectly killed, kinds secedes, loses her job cuz of crazy rats.
---
* Hawkins lab. is where the portal to the Upsidedown was opened
---
Yeah but another stealth killer after ghostface seems a bit annoying
---
I mean doesn't the raise a question of how 40+ bugs had to be fixed? Obviously I'm grateful they fixed them but alot of the time they break so much stuff each chapter.
---
It's how it's supposed to be, unfortunately the system can't tell an intentional DC to a forced, as the killer is the host, he is technically forcing a DC on everyone. Maybe it will be addressed with dedicated servers who knows
---
I don't even want know what demogorgons mori is
---
Hey, if people didn't feel the need to latch onto copy/paste humor like their lives depends on it  *shrugs*
---
how much for a Feng one üëÄ
---
Stranger Things follows a group of kids in the 1980‚Äôs in which one of them dissapears, without spoiling too much, they find a new dimension and must search for him. Hard to not give spoilers without watching it.
---
SCOOPS OR NOTHING !! üòÇ
---
My thoughts on the demogorgon exactly
---
Cool and the flower thing?
---
Nah
---
Yeah. Next time you play it, notice that the two pallets at the main entrance won't spawn if there are already pallets in other places downstairs. Before you could have all 4 spawn downstairs, while still having those 2 pallets upstairs.
---
Slapped to death
---
Oh man this would be terrifying
---
I will agree to that. It's not unbeatable if there is even one weak link among the survivors but it's still a bad map thougj
---
On their plan for this year they show that they're constantly working on bug fixes, hopefully we'll get some along with  the new chapter and probably some smaller updates along the way/afterwards
---
I'm for it, but damn an Alien putting someone on a hook seems dumb as hell.
---
I haven't played the game in a year and I'm already a Steve main
---
They just announced Stranger Things coming to dbd with a new map, the Demogorgen and two survivors, Steve and Nancy.
---
Imagine it's a stealthy killer, able to get down on all fours and crawl on the ground? Horrific
---
Nice b8 m8
---
It could be reworked if it‚Äôs truly an issue but i like the large size and little to no cover. It makes it feel like the unfair games the SAW franchise based itself on where you have to be extremely careful or smart to escape, with usually a lost of something or other, whether that be a piece of yourself(being injured) or a friend(another survivor dying).
---
The problem with the Xenomorph and Predator is that they don't give a shit.  
---
You drop a pallet, the Xenomorph leaps over it or simply tears it up in a millisecond and proceeds to eat the survivor's face.  The Predator shoulder cannons them into gaming afterlife.
---
Xbox. And yeah, Doctor used to be my main killer for farming before I got legion. However, doctor is only good at getting deviousness points. Legion is not AS good as doctor getting deviousness, but it's super easy to get hunting and brutality with him, since you'll be hitting and finding people multiple times
---
Hey man do you, that's the point of this game
---
AND Ghostface
---
I am so fucking hype for this. I actually got light goosebumps watching the trailer. This is the best thing to happen to DBD ever and I have been playing since launch. I love ST so much. 
---
Amazing.
---
and she participated in a charity thing were she played dead by daylight as laurie
---
I would like him to be able to go through walls when using ability
---
It's confirmed they're separate characters
---
Players on both sides have been complaining for ages how stealth no longer is a good strategy, I think BHVR are just over correcting a bit, watch Steve and Nancy both be loaded down with stealth perks too.
---
I think he's bringing up the point that this license is way more massive then the others considering it's modern and a bunch of people have watched it rather then old licenses like Leatherface,Pig,Micheal,etc
---
Ez 6 safe pallets and 2 god windows... God i miss old dbd
---
You just were a moment ago! Do it again I won‚Äôt judge :)

---
This is the absolute dumbest post I have EVER seen on this sub. Congrats. What do you want the survivors to do, run in a straight line and just let you kill them? You have the absolute worst mentality out of anyone I've ever seen play this game.
---
Very true, but then again - this is the Entity‚Äôs realm, and the Entity doesn‚Äôt give a fuck either when it comes to how overpowered a character ‚Äúshould‚Äù be.
---
And Quentin Smith had nothing to do with the first 5 Nightmare on elm Street. But Pinhead Rose to icon status by shifting his ways and becoming more than he started as. Kinda like Q in Star Trek. He did what he was feeling at the time. Also was a judge. :P
---
Lol. Konami has their head in they butthole, this wont ever happen unfortunately
---
I feel the same way man...

Then you have not read anything at all

Exploits: Abusing bugs or errors in design to gain a competitive advantage

Not exactly an alien, if I recall correctly, it was just a... thing, found within the black abyss by someone who was in a sense deprivation chamber, not really an outer space alien, where it comes from is a lot more mysterious. Its origin we dont fully understand.
---
The PTB could also be during or after the stream.
---
It‚Äôs a game. I want to have fun. Insta hatchets aren‚Äôt fun.
---
I died like a pig
---
You seem realllly confused with the English language at the moment. I said them being the same character doesn't matter if it's the same amount of perks as survivors are all interchangeable. I mean you seem very very lost.
---
Oh uh yes?
---
+1 for your list :D
---
&gt;Don't bother with this troll trust me, you'll get no satisfaction.
---
Noted. Adding him to my block list. Thanks for the heads up.
---
There are many people that didn't even see ST, even among DBD players (just recently saw posts about people never seeing the show). It is known yes, but not the biggest show, let's not exaggerate. I wager it was cheaper than any other license, but each to their own. This was clearly chosen due to its popularity among certain demographics and pinned their hopes on bringing new players, which will definitely happen.
---
They'll probably release the mall as a map.
---
No problem. Let me know if it helps. I wouldn't have been able to play for the last 2 weeks if not for that.
---
Nothing wrong with it, its easily countered, and quite frankly, most deaths to it are caused by survivors playing cocky, and not considering that it might be in play.
---
I want a Ships Ahoy outfit! If I don‚Äôt get it I‚Äôm gonna rage!!!!
---
Fr
---
Oh she does gens.
---
Until someone screams, then she stops everything and slinks away, until that person stops screaming (dead on first hook).
---
Shit shit shit. My friend made a bet. I‚Äôm so stupid
---
I got stun points for this but she wasn‚Äôt stunned
---
All maps are available to all players and you can play against any killer or survivor regardless of what DLC you have. DLC only limits what characters you can play as and limits what perks you can learn for your characters, unless they appear on the Shrine of Secrets. Also you can earn all of the original survivors and killers through playing the game. So if you are interested in the game because of the Stranger Things announcement you'll be fine with just getting the main game and that. Personally I was drawn in by the Saw chapter. Also should note that the DLC goes on sale a ton through out the year with everything except the the most recent DLC not being on sale
---
&gt;makes it feel more fake.
---
Do we really need to go down the real/fake road lol.
---
You're drawing a hard line in the sand at a multi-dimensional creature?... because of lore reasons... 
---
All this lore revolves around a Tentacle god, that creates its own dimensions. Then it kidnaps whoever it deems worthy, makes them immortal, and proceeds to feed off their emotions while they try to kill, or survive.
---
Personally the only thing that needs to stay human is the the survivor.
---
I partied up with a guy last night who only joined the game because of Ash and honestly he wasn't that bad at the game
---
Not for you. But for some others are - both survivor and killer side. And they are not wrong, just like you are not wrong. There is no wrong side on that subject.
---
Chucky
---
Why on earth would white wards do anything about franklins?
---
The predator is getting his own game for this
---
The only problem is he uncloaks so slowly it‚Äôs really easy to get away
---
Trump: Wrong
---
three huge floppy tits drip milk onto the survivor and they die
---
You cannot get banned for that, no.
---
Predator is getting his own game
---
So your saying it's a bad thing that the devs gave people what they wanted?
---
Riddle me this Batman why add a camping perk and make it bannable. You have 24 hours before Gotham blows up but if you answer correctly then  it wont
---
Didn't knew they were giving us hints in the first season...
---
Well it's not quite Scream but it's close enough, hoping one day we get a killer from Evil Dead and a survivor from TCM.
---
Actually very cool
---
With perks I agree without them though michael is not bad but not incredible
---
There can be multiple entrances
---
Why would they ban you for using a perk that is included in the game for you to use? Just ignore the salty poor sport.
---
Nope, devs have repeatedly confirmed that camping and tunneling are not bannable offenses.
---
I really wanted Bob from season 2 because I haven't had the time to watch s3 yet
---
Every time. By Thursday, when the power gets revealed, we're gonna have more of these posts than the "what is this random beam of light" posts
---
The lighting in these renders is never great, also the expressions. They will look 100% different ingame.
---
But I kinda like how they look so far, they look like their actors but their features have been tweaked to meet the games aesthetic. I like it.

Gotta love your dad when you see someone far older then you using a chainsaw wrong
---
r/Piracy
---
You are the gas station attendent.
---
you can only get banned is you use hacks
---
....what do you mean by "I have turned to insidious/basement bubba for my bloodpoint farming purposes" you get a grand total 0 points if you do that
---
It became free on PlayStation fuck you mean? It‚Äôs almost as if the playerbase is on 3 other(soon to be 4) platforms.
---
Nah, plague has more uses than clown, if I see all 4 survivors have medkits sometimes I just switch to plague to dab on them
---
No changes necessary, just do bones. I think survivor perks that would help you do totems/ keep track of totems could be worth it to be added
---
I shall if it‚Äôll work! Thank you!
---
I mean freddy is a literal demon and he gets stopped by a piece of wood
---
Hey dude, what's up?
---
I get it but mainstream doesn't always mean it's good or better. Regardless, I'm still hyped for a new chapter and I know there's a huge following for ST and I'm excited for those people but I'm personally kinda meh on it. Who knows it may end up being awesome and a fun chapter so will have to wait and see!
---
I am so fucking hype
---
Bruh just calm down... your ranting about my rant lol
---
I hope you know you wrote what's pronounced  shaunoumorf
---
The Demogorgon was most likely previously human as well
---
Oh God Elmo and nightmares are not the best combination for me. It's enough to trigger a Vietnam flashback
---
Ok look if theres a world where a spider god stabs people and sucks them into the sky then im sure a 5 flapped face monster is f i n e
---
Yeah it‚Äôs been broken for a long time
---
Let's not question the mind flayers choice! ,
---
Could be, but PTB's always get released on Tuesday, so we have no reason to think this is any different.
---
Ehh, it's the remake Freddy.
---
 ^(he a bytch)
---
I think she's the killer Peppa Pig
---
this is the post that matters
---
Ash was pretty good...
---
If you read The Legions backstory it says that Frank was from a foster home,plus the other three members of the gang didn't have a perfect backstory either.Also they were forced to kill a janitor by Frank,so i consider it a tragic backstort.
---
Btw being born into a family of cannibals,and killing a bunch of people seems pretty tragic to me.
---
I‚Äôm not too surprised that a player would say that. There‚Äôs an influx of new players and its a steep learning curve due to the sheer amount of variables coming into play due too perk and killers/survivor options.
---
It‚Äôs no where near the level of Jason or Freddy. He‚Äôs lesser known and that‚Äôs just how it is.
---
It‚Äôs probably really hard cause they have to fix characters too. At least they are actually working on the game. I can‚Äôt believe you can‚Äôt just be happy they are trying to fix the game. &gt;_&gt;
---
yea ur stating ur complaint
---
I love it on Ghostface because you can use it to punish cocky survivors who venture past the exit gates after they've already opened the gates and could have escaped.  Just hang out stealthed near the gates and wait.
---
I made it. I don‚Äôt wanna run around with a latex mask haha. 
---
I made mine out of plaster strips! There‚Äôs a brief tutorial on my Instagram highlight if you‚Äôre having problems. You can also private message me there if you need any further help :D
---
My Instagram name is cookiehchar
---
Steve getting a scoops ahoy outfit is almost definite. If Tapp and Pig can get cosmetics in the store, so can Steve and Nancy as a weekly release.
---
Sorry, I just don't want people to get their hopes up for tomorrow.
---
hahaha i dont blame you for that one
---
I don‚Äôt watch the show, but I am stoked for the demagorgon.
---
I hope not, it could expand upon what we know, but i hope it does it tastefully if so
---
To be fair the description just says something like, "light your way in the dark" or something
---
Thanks, so am I! :D
---
Had the same thought, able to shift between demodog and walking on two feet.
---
Nah Infectious Fright on Tier III Myers beats ass, you will destroy with that combo. Toss a dead rabbit on, toss any add-on that extends Tier III, oneshot downs and extreme map awareness. Very juicy.
---
I know. Was just some humour.
---
You can chuck those bottles far if held in...if not, sometimes they just blow up in your face
---
Sure, but that‚Äôs all subjective anyways. I love Hellraiser but in my personal opinion I like Stranger Things more in general, which I know you feel the opposite about.
---
# **TOO SOON**
---
That‚Äôs... kinda making me uncomfortable lmao
---
mY iMmErSiOn
---
Honestly it doesn't really matter because it seems like all killers except me camp on Xbox. Or maybe because I'm such a shit survivor that I'm still in a rank where killers think it's viable to proxy camp idk
---
So that's why they're in dbd now
---
Because steam is the only platform that exists...
---
I have never watched this show and am always so confused by these memes
---
I never watched the show so I‚Äôve got no bias towards it or against it. I‚Äôm just exited for a new killer and a new map. The idea of some new perks  as well but to a lower extent because they may be crap lol.
---
Good. I only play Legion and Ghost Face and I suck at them.
---
I don't know quite what they called it, but I know it's not a chapter... I can maybe word it better? Could they add Jason in as a standalone character, like they did with Leatherface, by not making it a full debut chapter?
---
The Demagorgon is technically a dimensional being, which happens to be on a different plain of Earth, so he or she aint an alien.
---
But Scream is not in game
---
thats means its completely useless in all situations then doesnt it
---
Yeah and then they DC. which is so triggering
---
If I recall they said something about killers exploring types of fears and phobias so someone asked about a giant spider killer. They said that they were not planning on doing any killers that were not humanoid because they'd have to re-do a new wireframe and completely start from scratch. That was probably two years ago so of course people still bring it up constantly as if it was set in stone. haha
---
We already have a wendigo. The hag.
---
Yeah you should definitely use Bill, Jane, or Laurie then.
---
Jeff's teachables are mediocre at best
---
Yeah I mean I figured but it‚Äôs still kinda... meh for me xD
---
ye its "Fun World"
---
Those two are already worth the 9K
---
What're you gonna stab, its eyeballs? *Hah!*
---
Plaster strips :D
---
Legion gave us 3 total killer perks.  Assuming everything stays fair, a 2 survivors patch should also leave us with 3 new survivor perks.
---
I'm really offended
---
Oh no, now we have THREE Bill(ies)?
---
Sadly.
---
Come on man you‚Äôre reaching
---
*ahem*
---
&gt;‚ÄùGhostface is a fictional identity adopted by several characters of the **Scream series.**‚Äù
---
Or add a number to small game. The perk made to find totems and trappers traps
---
I thought the Entity and the Mind Flayer are similar as well, both being these bizarre shadowy figures that appear to be deities of their own strange dark dimensions that reflect places in the human world, and both get others to do their dirty work. I'm interested to see how Dead By Daylight will incorporate Stranger Things own lore into its own considering the similar supernatural concepts and the fact that the Entity will have access to something created by a thing similar to itself, and that came from yet another weird dimension only to end up in the Entity's dimension.
---
I could care less, it‚Äôs a new killer from a GREAT franchise, devs are gonna get BANK none the less
---
I'm a red rank killer so t-bagging doesn't really faze me lol. I guess I should've realized that when I t-bag a rank 15 he's gonna get pissy about it lmao
---
Yes, that is the reason for the post
---
I've always seen the scary ones as Franks or Julies with the prestige maks and their uncommon outfits.
---
I actually love this idea. Even if we got a nerfed killer ability, i would love this so much! Maybe in the upside down instead of having a killer power the demo is buffed? Like a higher movement speed or maybe has the ability to give survivors inflictions?
---
Not really. Freddy is more of a hag with waterclogged shoe that can teleport to gens and has clocks in his map.
---
And it‚Äôs a strategy. I suck at killer, so I can understand why people do it. It‚Äôs an easy 1 or 2 kill game. I guess I‚Äôd rather get no kills then just stare at a random Dwight for 2-3 minutes.
---
I think that would make it too hard to cleanse them though. I think you need to be very careful with aura reading on totems because they are supposed to be hard to find. If you put in a perk like this, it definitely takes a lot of power away from existing hex perks that I think are in a good spot as they are.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hooks
---
Hook Gymnastics
---
Early on in the Game's life, hooked Survivors established a way to communicate a Killer's proximity to the other Survivors:
---
Hanging still from the Hook means something along the lines of:¬†"The Killer is far enough away or preoccupied with something else, you can come and rescue me!"
---
Spamming the self-unhook animation means something along the lines of:¬†"The Killer is near-by and patrolling the Hook. It is not safe to attempt a rescue, stay away and let me hang!"
---
Amen.
---
*Puts on bitch slapping glove*
---
I will happily slap everyone whose been saying this. Ive been asking for Xenomorph forever now and this was always the stupid response
---
that is the actual skincolour of a demogorgon tho.  
---
if you have seen a darker version in pictures its probably due to it beeing covered in blood. prestige 3 hypeee
---
I'm not saying it doesn't. I'm saying it shouldn't.
---
Yeah same. Camping is a strategy but a bullshit 1 that ruins the fun of the game.
---
Bruh... Fuck this shit. I didn't want to get back into DbD... Now I have to... 
---
Oh boy dis gon be gud.
---
It's gonna be a painful 8 days, but well worth the wait.
---
yea that's suxx man...  my name is Trapper so i 've to main him since 2 years now...
---
Nah don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll do that one. I honestly don‚Äôt like that one a lot haha. I do like the red outfit‚Äôs head a lot more though and I do kinda think my current mask looks like that one in a way :D
---
Nah, enduring, brutal strength, spirit fury
---
Oh ok
---
it is a full side to side joker esk smile.......... sad thing is i convinced my eldest that i actually know elmo because seb dose such a good job XD
---
I'm just saying, I wouldn't be surprised if there are only 5 new perks instead of 6.
---
You mean generic edgy emo bad guy number 47?  He looks like the guy from Hatred, Postal dude from Postal, a Psychopath from Dead Rising and a couple more, dude is super generic when you actually meet him. He's terrifying in the other form/s though. 
---
Unless you mean his weird demon form which is awesome, but at that point we might as well grab the Asylum Twins from that game as having a two headed, 8 foot tall fat baby with weird legs sprinting at you with a knife would be terrifying.
---
Honestly I haven't seen the show, but if it brings more people who are less toxic I am down for anything
---
No idea what you are trying to say here?
---
Can we appreciate this chapter before we makes memes on what the next chapter is gonna be?
---
Ash is obviously one of the Wayans brothers
---
Thanatophobia with Sloppy is A tier on Legion.  I said before the perks I list will be meta on either all killers or a specific killer...
---
Franklin's is literally the only counterplay to keys so yes it has it's use against those swf lobbies that spam them.  
---
NOED is still among the strongest and badly designed perks in the game.  It creates kills for players not skilled enough to get them without the instadown and haste after losing their objectives.  It's not as good vs swf but against soloqueue it's generally good for 1 added kill per game.
---
Stridor is meta on both Nurse and Spirit the two strongest killers in game.
---
Brutal I'm not in love with but on Myers and fake pallet Freddy can be quite useful.  
---
Again Overcharge meta on Doc but can be used on a variety of killers I've used it on Billy and Trapper with great success in the past.  
---
Objectively the perks on my list all 20+ of them are stronger than your survivor response.  As pointed out some of your perks are flat out detrimental to use and cause team losses due to wasting time not completing objectives and encouraging immersive time wasting playstyles.
---
Amen
---
I‚Äôve actually been playing a ton of Claudette but those also sound like good options. Isn‚Äôt Bill or Laurie the loudest character in the game or something like that? Just imagine Nurse using Stridor listening to you injured as one of them. You would not be able to hide.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs one of the worst perks in the game :(
---
The Lullaby for the Dark chapter is free and it includes David King &amp; The Huntress.
---
Original characters can be bought with iridescent shards, earned by levelling up.
---
Licensed characters have to be bought with money
---
They literally never said non human, they said only humanoid ones because they‚Äôre easier to make
---
Holding it wrong and may of revved too fast
---
Really? Beat him with the Lament configuration? The thing that banished and seals them away? 
---
They should use hooks. 
---
Also would anyone else find it weird if they add a killer who already has an ‚Äúentity‚Äù that has nothing to do with The Entity.
---
It's stolen, but it's funny, but it's still stolen
---
Is this a jojo reference?
---
Oh or chopping a survivor in two using a portal
---
I dont even know what else id want in dbd besides a wolf man. I got my dream killer ghost face
---
Gonna go ahead and guess that the Demogorgon‚Äôs power is gonna be something to do with the upside-down. Maybe he can open a fixed number portals and teleport between them across the map?
---
Evolve was so much fun. I was sad to see it go
---
ofc it was buggy, but the current game is on a completly different level and way more polished
---
Zombieland survivors, please.
---
I was about to comment "go watch that shiz then" but then I read the actual post and felt bad. People will give you a synopsis on it but I'm honestly bad at them. All I can say is, it's a good show. A really good show in my honest opinion, and I'm like 79% sure it's going to make a really awesome DBD chapter
---
My precious baby Demo's model is so damn good looking. Gonna be horrifying seeing that pop out of nowhere without a terror radius from Tinkerer or Dark Devotion.
---
If any jojo would be a survivor it would he Joseph Joseph joestar because of his signature move "running away"
---
A totem counter, be it next to the gen counter or added to small game, has been suggested multiple times. This is really the only change that I'd like to see since I actually think NoEd is okay for the most part. Yes, I hate getting it used against me, but I do think the hard punishment is fair simply because it is so easy to take out and doesn't activate until end game. Even as a solo survivor I can usually pop out those totems fairly easily as long as I know the map well. If not then I take my chance or play more immersed after last gen is popped.
---
That is the wiki, wiki's are ran by volunteers not by the devs directly. Doesn't make the information less true though.
---
Haven't seen the show, the new chapter looks cool though. I would like more original characters though soon, I hope the next few chapters are just original characters since I like seeing new characters than ones that already exist.
---
Let me put it simply for you then. 
---
Before, getting the hatch was almost a guaranteed win state for the survivor. If the killer got three survivors and the hatch spawned, the last survivor was very likely to escape. Hatch stand offs were extremely survivor favoured.
---
Now if the hatch spawns, it‚Äôs a killer sided situation. If the survivor doesn‚Äôt find the hatch (which they‚Äôre less likely to, since the killer both moves faster and doesn‚Äôt have to worry about stealth), they‚Äôre unlikely to get out. 
---
This skews the survival rate slightly. Not by half, because 80% was never a valid statistic and it‚Äôs been explained multiple times by the devs why. But if 4ks were not likely before because of the hatch, they‚Äôre much more common now. If you think that would have NO effect whatsoever on the stats then you don‚Äôt understand how statistics work.
---
who said it‚Äôs not canon?
---
Scoops Ahoy Steve &gt; Shirtless Myers
---
Fight me.
---
I love their outfits and prestige masks
---
Especially franks
---
I've been debating on whether or not i want to prestige my legion, but I think I'm going to to do it for the mask and knife.
---
Or bugged as hell
---
/s here you go dummy
---
Meh.
---
I‚Äôm more just mildly dissapointed but i‚Äôll get over it, and it‚Äôs not even just because it‚Äôs stranger things
---
But rather I was hoping we‚Äôd have some more original killer/survivor instead of another licensed dlc.
---
But again, i‚Äôll very quickly get over it, because its new content nonetheless
---
I don't understand why people can't comment instead of making a whole thread.  Your one sentence half thought isn't going to blow up, just put in slightly more effort, and scroll down 1/4 a page max.
---
Urban is for garbage players who hide instead of contribute towards objectives.  Learn how to loop and you'll never need to run it again.  I've tried countless times to get Didact to work.  It simply is way too unreliable getting skill checks and takes a fair amount of the game to build stacks.  You need to equip a medkit too because otherwise you can literally kill your teamates getting those first two stacks if the killer heads back.  If you play both sides heavily which I do I don't understand how with a straight face you could compare our two lists on even footing.
---
:o two survivors?
---
Cute story.
---
It is human based, everyone knew Freddy was gonna get reworked they just took forever and servers still aren‚Äôt out.
---
_cries in Zoroastrian_
---
Having the Xenomorph in DBD would be amazing. Very little in the history of cinema has been as terrifying as the Alien! Also, because they seem permanently linked at this point, Predator would be great too!
---
I agree since I can take the net out and show my real eyes ;3
---
I think chapter 14 needs to be original 100%
---
Maybe because Stranger things is super up to date? Imagine a Serie about Myers... Im getting sweaty just by thinking...
---
youre able to log on? the game just crashes my  ps4 currently
---
Heckers yas
---
What is pyramid head? I never played the game and thought he was a cultist or undead or something
---
There is 2 main issue with the game's balance:
---
* SWF vs Solo (SWF is massively stronger for many reasons).
---
* Strong Killers vs Average Killers.
---
If a killer tries to play an average Killer like the trapper, and face a good SWF, he is massively underpowered.
---
At the opposite, if a killer plays an OP Killer like Spirit or nurse, and face a solo team, he is Overpowered.
---
I don't think anybody has said this, but killing people on first hook gets you like 12k BP camping isn't a good strategy for BP
---
Well shit what if I play both sides would you still hate me?
---
Too be honest during the SAW chapter teaser, I swear I thought the killer was going to be Jigsaw on a tricycle chasing survivors down.
---
I would use solidarity and swap empathy with aftercare.
---
It‚Äôs my first time posting here I didn‚Äôt want to make a  comment that nobody would see
---
Oh hey its my comment
---
Thank you! :3 I‚Äôll make a new one in the future with better ears and dark brown wig :3

If you tip it the scale in either direction it throws off balance in one way or the other.
---
üêΩüñ§
---
for the last time, who do you work for?
---
Fair point , if 2-3 survives are on the other side of the map and they see the killer next to the person he just hooked(via kindred) and the killer is just M1 smacking him over and over.. again or just waiting for someone to unhook him then the killer is "camping". The point I've made is if he's just standing their waiting for the unhook then that isn't patrolling and as a "killer" in my opinion you should move onto your next target and not wait for your target. I would like to know what your opinion is because this is just my thoughts and I'm not saying I'm 100% correct etc.
---
Dude I felt the same way in r/gtaonline about the casino, I got downvoted to hell for saying that a casino would come to the game lol

Is is NOW. But we've been having a bunch of ST posts for weeks, and it was getting really tiring to see post after post with speculation after speculation with no real basis. At least now that its been confirmed, there will be a bunch of posts about it for a few more weeks and then they'll die down.
---
If this was added I would gladly mori myself to this.
---
Thanks :D
---
Heck yeah brother! Welcome back! Stay in the fog a while and have fun killing and escaping.
---
Honestly I prefer the FvJ design for Jason. Might be because the bigger budget makes him look more undead and wet.
---
Is this some kind of European joke I‚Äôm too American to understand?
---
Okay? Just about every game is the survivors being toxic and obnoxious for no reason hoping to bully the killer because they watched too many YouTube videos, so BS lol. Toxic survivors wailing in tears to defend their toxicity isn't uncommon.
---
Only if you smack a piece of wood on my snoot ;}
---
Hey man. Thats just like your opinion
---
I think this is a meme based on this chapter though, main thing is making fun of the demogorgon flower face.
---
*happiness in scratched mirror*
---
I personally think Walker would fit equally as well. But as you said, Walker would be better from a profit/business standpoint due to his popularity. And another killer who doesn't need a tool is pretty nice imo
---
remindme! 5 hours
---
It's not 50% as you need 1killer per 4 survivors so more like 20%
---
no, thats the price most Chapters cost lol
---
I agree! That‚Äôs why I call my discord members little cute piglets :‚Äô3
---
doing your mom doing doing your mom
---
your new dad is called joe mama
---
Well the legion issue was because of a design choice with them so I'm not too off track but Ghostfaces was just bad design can't even say it was a bug.
---
Ive never watched stranger things. What exactly is the ‚Äúupside down‚Äù
---
It's literally going to either cost 5 bucks like always or 10 because of an extra survivor maybe? If thats enough to make your bank account drain i have no words.
---
Right where does this person live?
---
He‚Äôs totally becoming my main
---
I hope Netflix and bhvr will try to do more with each other in the future. I would kill for a dbd series on Netflix based on the killers‚Äôs backstories and I‚Äôm always welcome to new content in the game
---
"Bugged-as-Hell" is DBD's middle name.
---
True, tbf I hate most of the games you mentioned like Hatred, Postal.
---
I think the Walter we need is something like this.
---
new killer:
---
The Cultist
---
DLC:
---
THE ROOM (oh hi Mark)
---
Survivor:
---
(If this is a SH DLC any protagonist from the first 4, I'd want Heather Mason imo. But for now Henry Townshend)
---
Bio:
---
SH4, backstory,
---
As Walter nearly completed the Sacraments lying on the floor dying, he was so close to his reunion, but Henry had other plans.
---
He woke up in a fog, this isn't Silent Hill, something different. Maybe this was a second chance. No one would stop him now.
---
(It's not good ik)
---
Power:
---
The Holy Ritual.
---
(And I can't finish the rest, enjoy I guess?)
---

I don't think the Doc needs a rework, dev resources are much better spent elsewhere especially since there is like one guy apparently who codes the reworks(judging from the Freddy dev stream)
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a really really long shank. No acid on ur hand
---
Thanks :‚Äô3
---
Probably wont happen since it'd be a copyright nightmare.
---
You're right I forgot about others tribes, and there were expelled Predators as well...
---
Same my dude, but I'm gonna level up Nancy first to get her teachables for Steve lol
---
If your high ranks(1-8) it's doesnt matter cause people break totems but low ranks(20-10) people cry about it
---
Doctor mains rise up! (Although I kind of hope the map is very large and not like The Game or Lery's.)
---
üòàüñ§
---
I look forward to seeing it!
---
I am
---
This is why I add blood warden on all my killers not because of teabag but sometimes survivors just never leave the gate at all waiting to see the killer just lunge at them at the last second to have some laughs.
---
They call me "Dead by Bugged-as-Hell Daylight, the first"
---
Thank you :‚Äô3
---
I really hope he‚Äôs gonna be in the game, even if the animations (especially the tail) are going to be messy
---
Oh you want wet. Look at Jason takes Manhattan
---
Underrated reply
---
√ñinksüêΩüñ§
---
i don‚Äôt even watch the show and i‚Äôm happy
---
&gt;maybe he will have a crotch ability like Amanda.
---
I am not familiar with this ability.. is it from one of her add ons? :)
---
Nea*
---
Most liscened killers are very original creations anyway lol
---
Thank you :D
---
If something happens a certain way 12 times in a row, it's safe to assume the next time will follow that same pattern. I'm not saying it's confirmed or true, I'm just saying why I personally think it is that way. I don't get what's so hard to comprehend about this
---
I play console lol i dont get steam deals
---
You can get banned outside of hacks, although what OP is doing is not bannable..
---
He likes to show old footage. I assume you're talking about the video yesterday.
---
Too baaaby. Also that costume misses the badass green jacket.
---
Those graphics look very good, could this mean graphics update?
---
I was kidding considering I don‚Äôt use ‚Ç¨, Bit I also don‚Äôt want to sound ignorant considering I know next to nothing about any other currency other than $.
---
Old Freddy could still feel pain. He literally got kungfued once
---
I think canonically Bill was pulled into the fog as he was dying.
---
Both of them are terrible.
---
Steam Playstation Xbox, it's all the same there's always an external dlc.
---
Guys that's the joke. There's a whole bit about those 2 actors getting mistaken for one a other
---
So this is why Billies father was so tough on Billy.
---
Good. But i don't like killers without any chasing tool
---
sccops ahoy!
---
BM‚Äôed?
---
Technically youre right.  Its not a scream chapter but just the mask
---
Thankies! üêΩ
---
No, they released the PTB after the info stream.
---
Ah, ye thats hard to tell on the Internet, sometimes :D
---
Hag is some weird wendigo/voodoo hybrid thing. We might see a more "pure" wendigo, but who knows.
---
Eugh...
---
Haha yea, you don't know about the iridescent beartrap crotch addon of hers?üòÇüòÇ
---
But a beast like the demogorgon has no emotion. It only has instinct. Even with killers with absolutely no empathy they derive something more than a base instinctual pleasure from the activity. They get mirth from it. 
---
Also Stranger Things shows the demogorgons die when no link to the mindflayer is established so it being alive in the entity's dimension doesn't make sense.
---
Aesthetic means very little as well, since the game isn‚Äôt truly ‚Äúhorror‚Äù, it‚Äôs just horror themed. The Demogorgon fits the horror niche of the game, and the crowds demands, so I think it‚Äôs great.
---
I was really hoping for a mall map. I dont want another lerys.
---
Was the entire stream really just the trailer?
---
All they did was show the trailer.
---
It says you lose one, but you don't
---
Supernatural powers don't make you not a human or formerly a human. A ghost is still human, just no longer mortal. A beast is a beast.
---
Maybe the map will have some cameras, and you'll be able to see different rooms from those screens
---
Fun fact when I was looking up Walter Sullivan someone ALREADY had a concept of him floating around as a killer, but honestly?  He's too plain to be a good "Killer" in DBD.  Legion BARELY skates by because of the cool, punk outfits and masks.
---
I would much prefer they chose a more iconic monster than Walter if they had to do a Silent Hill chapter given that there is even monsters in 4 that are more iconic than him, such as the Twin Asylum Baby.  
---
https://i.pinimg.com/originals/01/31/4a/01314a77b92520580519910da44f0d5e.jpg
---
Or Walter's House Form.
---
https://wallpaperstock.net/wallpapers/thumbs1/20145.jpg
---
Still a neat thought.  4 just had a somewhat weak cast of villains in it.
---
What information is it missing?
---
I enjoy a round or two as Scratched Mirror Myers so this is going to be very fun.
---
We‚Äôre all unoriginal, I just thought it was funny that his post showed up right next to a post that I could perfectly screenshot to shitpost about how wrong he/she was.
---
Actually find the highest tree in the forest and go have a ropeparty in it my dude.
---
I never said that, don't put words in my mouth.
---
The Hag has heavy influences from Wendigo mythology, but she also has some voodoo stuff thrown in. I'm not saying it's impossible to get a more "pure" wendigo, it's just unlikely.
---
It would probably be cheaper to just buy the dlc tbh üòä
---
Did someone say...

Don't be salty dude. Everyone here has been given a free out. You didn't get a one off of oh dude I beat him it'll happen just not now.
---
The clown is a little bit of a different case because that was a very specific rather than broad design choice. Going back on that is surprising but not setting a major precedent.
---
I live in the greater Boston area :‚Äô)
---
Did you mean overrated? I thought it was too but I gave it a go after the netflix X bhvr tease a couple months ago and seasons 1 and 3 were good, not the "best series on the internet" but it was still enjoyable and deserves the praise/hype.
---
Cool, ty.
---
Pro Tip, don't do that. Good killers will know what you are doing and Wait untill it ends
---
Enemy of r/AceBase
---
Because it sucks and has nothing to do with the rest of the series
---
Dude I‚Äôm not being salty I‚Äôm saying if you think that then ok you think that but I think he was looking for a hook
---
A lot of people are opting to slap my ass; unsure what‚Äôs going to happen next 
---
maybe you‚Äôre predicament will be correct *;)*
---
Those ST theories regarding new chapter of DBD game... do count as dbd content, you know. Because speculations and theories rise around possible character for DBD and signs Bhvr gave us to actually speculate. Doesn't matter, that the main topic is another franchise. What matters - is it's connection to a new chapter and this is still dbd content.
---
An Until Dawn chapter would be cool, but unless they make an "Until Dawn 2" I doubt we'll see that crossover. Crazier things have happened though.
---
6hs late but F.
---
I've barely played this game really. I'm super new and just focusing on leveling up a couple of the killers (between being told how bad I am every few games by toxic survivors). I don't have DLC cos money gets tight but damn this is a must buy for me. How exciting!
---
I agree with you on that
---
You're right T_T
---
It has no heart or soul though. The entity's entire realm is about fueling itself with emotion. It doesn't make much sense either since it's the footsoldier of a hivemind.
---
Not everyone is either a "killer main" or "survivor main", plenty of people play both
---
Thats what I thought
---
No, you got outplayed. Just break LOS
---
/s
---
Yeah, I agree
---
Im soooo hyped for this dude
---
Heresy!
---
Thats hot
---
Wdym, the wiki for dbd is great, it doesnt only put down information about stuff but also brings up raw numbers or how much time x would take with y. If anything they need more love, you shouldn't look at it as a tutorial.
---
However, if you want to give someone a video to watch and get good, I easily recommend tofu videos
---
Im a killer main, but started off with survivor. I feel like theres a little bit more toxicity when youre playing killer (probably because theres 4 of them so theres a higher chance you'll meet asshole per game), but you do also deal with shitty killers when you play survivor albeit a little less.
---
Thats why whenever I get a good match, where no ones being a dick, i go out of my way to do something nice for atleast one of the survivors, to try and stop any future toxicity. But if i have a couple toxic games in a row you better believe im going to try and murder all of them.
---
Doctor, distressing is really good on him
---
Yeah, I was oversimplifying it, really. Not everybody is as familiar with the complicated SH lore
---
Except the entity drags people into her dimension for the purpose of sowing both hope and despair. Part of that emotional fuel she gets is from the emotions of the killer and the glee they get out of killing survivors.
---
Yeah, is the upsidedown being put in for this killer like Freddy?
---
Licnsed or not, we get two survivors, a REALLY cool looking monster killer, and another indoor map. I'm happy.
---
Unless this Killer comes with a perk better than Ruin, I probably won't buy it.
---
Lol ok, you hate all killer mains. Nice.
---
Something opens an inter-dimension doorway and connects the upside down to our world, then a monster (the demogorgon) starts grabbing people. Here is a quick 3 minute animation since you don't have much free time. ;-P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M6qfBtnvR4
---
Oh be prepared üòà
---
Yes. Also, you can't do hatch grabs anymore - it's the price paid for the ability to shut the hatch.
---
Rip Laurie and Bill
---
oh no. it's scary movie 2... burn it, destroy it
---
With the rework to stealth killer coming soon, I would assume he is gonna be a stealth killer
---
Get an app called coto movies. You download it online. It has stranger things and many movies+TV shows for free
---
Who said they could rest? The entity sure didn‚Äôt.
---
My initial plan was to play Doctor + BBQ + Distressing + Thrill of the Hunt + Beast of Pray to maximise BP
---
I like the second Idea more. That would be nice. I just hope hes not OP
---
I never said it was guaranteed. I said perks that show the hatch aura would pretty much make it guaranteed. The killer has to find it as well and survivors have things such as maps that can track black locks. I've gone against countless survive with friends groups that make it through the hatch together or I've had the last Survivor have the hatch spawn right by them. I've had people can't the hatch and their team-mate will disconnect so they can get it.
---
However when I play Survivor I never go for the hatch. Aren't you working on generators until the hatch is closed or the gates are powered. Escaping doesn't matter if you only get like 10,000 points, you can escape and still lose and die but still win.
---
As I have said before the hatch is a reward for failure and your team failing to do the objective. One last effort or bit of Hope for a survivor.
---
I hate that you're almost 98% right &gt;:(
---
Fking got 'em, you savage beast.
---
It's probably the best part is how open ended and fun it is to talk about though.  So much to dig into.
---
They're also OLD
---
No I mean survivor, chapter 14 is a killer and nothing else.
---
definitely but they really need to come out with something original soon
---
the last original that came out was faithful of the demise and that was back in january
---
then following evil dead, scream and now stranger things
---
but whatever they come up with next is something to look forward to
---
&gt;The entity doesn't need the killer to be anything other than thirsty for the kill.
---
No, she feeds off the emotions of the killer as well. It's why she keeps a mental link with them. If it was just them being thirsty for the kill, she wouldn't need to drag in people or make deals with them to turn them to her side. She could literally grab any monster from any dimension she wants.
---
Especially since the consoles are already incredibly starved for cpu perf, I don't they'd want to do more draws at this point.
---
Yeah, as long as its not OP like legion original release
---
This is true.
---
Yeah my eyes are open for that one perk and make a decision between the two of em
---
Thanks.
---
More likely because the guy who owns the copyright (or is fighting for it) is overzealous as hell
---
Deliverance is always a 100% guaranteed unhook.
---
I mean... what? lol anyways have a nice day with... whatever is happening in there.
---
But it literally did. You're discussing a hypothetical when were looking at a chapter that dismisses that.
---
I Genuinely Hate People That Type Like This
---
You already know it's happening and soon. Why even debate that?
---
Apparently this was something that the devs wanted because there are actually add-ons that reduce the slowdown of the throw.
---
Yeah, I feel like dbd really shines in creating their own characters but that‚Äôs not to say their adaptations are any worse
---
*chuckles* you fool
---
Now don‚Äôt you feel silly
---
I would love to see this, but we never will. #FucKonami
---
Sorry you cant win ever game, champ.
---
Free killers are a reward. The nurse was to keep the game alive and the huntress was a reward for completing all the community challenges during the first anniversary event.
---
We're kinda stretching the definition of human characters here, aren't we? Ones a Wendigo, two are ghosts, another a dream demon and the plague is something between an undead and a mummy. A lot of these are not humans anymore.
---
He's a pretty generic monster.
---
Unprotected contact with the killer causes the status effect Castration.
---
I feel like they're all iconic though. I'd hate to see the backlash if they announced a Scooby Doo chapter and only had 1 of the main cast as a Survivor, instead of all of them.
---
Idk between 7 and 8 those are my favorites
---
The Upside Down is basically a parallel world that sits adjacent to ours. It's comprised of all the dark thoughts and energies from our world and they manifest into nightmarish creatures, like the Demogorgan. It touches our world in a few places, and where it touches, "gates" form that are zones where the fabric between realities is thinner. If you've ever played Dnd or other rpgs, think of the Shadowfell
---
Will post the results in 24 hours. Thanks!
---
Didn't know I need this until I saw it.
---
Honestly before it was announced I didn't want there to be a Stranger Things chapter, but the more memes I see the more excited I get to have a killer that's outlier and different compared to everything else there. Idk who Nancy and Steve are, but I'm gonna play the heck out of em
---
He protec. He attac. But most importantly. He is a cool dad.
---
Everyone thinks the demogorgon is the next killer, but really, hes just running from "The Hair" like everyone else
---
But if you're no someone who can end chases quickly so you can keep Pop active, then it's a worthless perk for that game. You can lose 1-2 gens on a good day without Ruin on your first chase, unless you're Ghost or Billy.
---
That‚Äôs not speculation that‚Äôs the actual on the book lore. Go read the spirit‚Äôs bio
---
Best chapter incoming.
---
Go look at the literal visual trailer.
---
Best Chapter incoming.
---
I don‚Äôt really know what you mean. I get 40k+ each game. People would rather save their friends before doing gens.
---
It‚Äôs around 30 bucks I think
---
As a map or just for a survivor(s) I could see it, but I don't think integrating the house/red room as a killer would be feasible.
---
honestly i dont mind it. Even playing against it isnt that bad once you get used to it. Adds some spice to the endgame
---
Yeah I suppose. Now that I think of it, they did work on 6 survivor perks at once for Jane and Ash and Ghost didn't have a survivor so its definitely not a question about work.
---
. Ripley as a survivor would be awesome but I don't think it will ever happen. Just now we'll never get Jason.
---
What did i lie about exactly?
---
Are you such a smoothbrain that you don‚Äôt understand the contradiction? I‚Äôm not denying that the DLC is coming out I‚Äôm saying it makes little sense when you reflect on previously established lore
---
still a guaranteed unhook.
---
stranger things is set in the 80s. nancy wheeler is kind of a homage to nancy thompson in a few ways and is overall a pretty great character for the shows first season
---
the problem is that stranger things had a firm idea of what her story in season 1 was gonna be and it was amazing. she was my favorite character in season 1
---
but then when it came time to do season 2 they didnt seem to have as firm an idea of what they wanted nancy to do in the plot so she is just kind of there. 
---
the same problem with her is in season 3 as well. they want to keep her around but just dont seem to have any idea of what to do with her anymore so she is more of a background character now when who gets to help fight a monster like once a season but not as important to the plot as she once was
---
They buffed duration on pop to be like 1 min i think you should be able to use it pretty easily but ruin is a good option im not saying that. I just think more of a pro active gameplay for it rather then just passive buff
---
Same man I‚Äôm clueless i just watched one of those (stranger things in 3mins) videos and i didn‚Äôt rly learn anything lol. 
---
Im really curious however to see how bhvr handles the killer‚Äôs ability and the ‚Äúupside down‚Äù aka dream world? Sorta 
---
Idk man I‚Äôm hyped and i don‚Äôt even with stranger things lol. Very creative company
---
Is there any date (estimated or not) for the chapter 13 ptb?
---
People always find something to complain about smh
---
I don't know anything about Stranger Things but that "Thing" looks creepy as Hell.
---
Still got to make a pizza delivery.
---
Please protect.
---
 Locker Gods.
---
I can see where you're coming from the Baby Face but at the same time that's basically what Legion is and I'm not too sure what else they could do to make Baby Face unique without giving them some sort of power they didn't have in the movie.
---
We have to send the message
---
buy the dlc then buy audric cells for the cosmetic
---
Darn but one killers description of their past doesn't account for your drool running down your neck from being wrong based off literal paid content.
---
Welp rip your meme haha
---
Thank god someone said it
---
I don‚Äôt know why I just love the clown, it feels so good to actually do well on such a shitlord
---
The flashlight is lore wise on the game to give survivors hope. Even though the demogorgon has no eyes it will still 'blind' it so that it's still a source of hope for survivors. Logic doesn't make sense in the entity's realm.
---
No, the joke is **bubba with insidious** took me a while to get it.
---
the powe of the derme gorgeous wil be the upside  down it very wit hit and perks aswell
---
Yeah but between killers of the same size there are differences is height, thus the Demogorgon could be taller than trapper
---
It will either be the upside down or I feel something to do with it being like a creature
---
Wow, might have to come back for this!
---
And nurse. And hag.
---
Three times the entity has made deal with a devil type agreements with killers to get them to work for her. That seems needlessly complicated if apparently she can just grab a random monster.
---
I disagree, even lower tier killers can easily spiral a game if the survivors are uncoordinated/solo playing.
---
I FUCKING KNEW IT
---
Silent Hill chapter would be so great!
---
The first one was awesome, I saw it in theater knowing nothing going in. My head exploded. I saw 2 or 3 of the others and watched a synopsis of the rest, they never really could match the style of the first, though I wasn't bored with what I saw.
---
SSSTTTAAAARRRRSSSS
---
.
---
yes mine just seems like it's going to become a supernova everytime I start the game.
---
You're such a fucking mental invalid you say the word "apparently" in a post with definitive proof.
---
Idk. Every Bill I encounter is more incompetent than any Meg I've seen.
---
for a giggle, looks at Clown's perks. they dont really synergize with his power at all; instead, they're designed to compensate for the fact he can't slow the gens or survivors in any way, nor apply map pressure.
---
Billy Willy was based on leatherface and we got leatherface.
---
did you see a high rank Freddy lose to a solo survivor team yet ?
---
Oh most certainly!  
---
Glad you liked it :)
---
I play For Honor, and.. yeah, you're probably right.
---
Do a flip!
---
If Nintendo dropped a DLC that made Link a 7 foot tall chain smoking bodybuilder would you ignore all the previously established characterization because now that depiction is canon?
---
they may have wanted to hold off because of the state of the game, depending on when the license was sought. Not hard to imagine them not wanting to associate with a game and developers that are mired in controversy from their fanbase (i.e. if they asked for the license shortly after legion's initial release, I wouldn't blame any company for saying "no thanks" and not wanting to be involved in that mess).
---
well, if you are facecamped it's a pretty good opportunity for your mates to fix all the gens and the killer mostly get 1k on the match
---
I'm more disappointed about this being the second time we had a string of Licensed dlc instead of breaking it up between original chapters.
---
First we had Leatherface, Elm Street, and Saw
---
Now we have Ash, Ghostface, and now Stranger Things.
---
I don't like how it's a back and forth between original stuff and licensed and hopefully this doesn't become the pattern.
---
Its whatever to me. Really wouldnt do it if there still gens up but if its gens done and only gates left the. I'm camping.
---
Both Nancy and Steve already finish high school. They are at least around the ages of 18 and 19
---
Pop, brutal strenth, ruin, and whatever you want for the last one
---
An idea I had for the theme of Stranger Things is to have the map feature a 'day/night' cycle-esque mechanic where at a timed interval the map switches from normal to upside down and vice versa. Maybe like a minute and a half timer for each.
---
https://media.giphy.com/media/pYo7z7HQxZFeg/giphy.gif
---
the only two killers that did not come out with a map are ghost face and leather boy and we got them for 5 bucks although there were no survivors as well.
---
demoman
---
Unfortunately there isnt much to do about it. Imagine if you chased a surv over to a hooked surv and then you were penalized for it, it would be pretty lame.
---
Sure if none of the past canon conflicts. You're so upset your fan canon isnt real anymore you just argue about hypotheticals after a trailer proving you wrong.
---
2 survivors? guess this is a chapter and a half
---
The O in OP stands for omnipotent
---
Who's bitching about it? I got a wrist rocket and left over quarter sticks from the 4th.
---
He looked like that in one of the sequels I think.
---
Must be something about that name.

When people see kids in a videogame being murdered they wont care about the game‚Äôs story lmao

Seanomorph - whenever a face hugger specimen attaches himself to a surfer or skater, a Seanomorph is spawned from the implanted alien specimen. The Seanomorph is noted as distinct from it's Xenomorph counterpart, as it hunts out drugs and alcohol almost as if it has dropped out of highschool, while making ear-piercing screeches that one could sum up to it trying to say 'Wassup'.  The Seanomorph will have a natural talent for skateboarding, and surfing on it's own spit.
---
Can the hit boxes be fixed and can we can new maps instead of reworked versions?
---
Long hallways tho
---
So?
---
Passive aggressive arent we
---
It is when a SwF storms the basement for the unhook
---
When is the question
---
Get pranked idiot
---
As did the rest of the sub
---
can you think please ? it's to counter looping.  So you don't care if you 're being slowed while throwing the bottle since the survivor is waiting at the loop point.
---
I kinda wanted Barb, but it just wouldn't work.
---
Thats how I feel when I play trapper and actually get a 4K
---
We‚Äôll see I guess.
---
Man I'm honestly glad they did the demogorgon itself over Billy though with 2 survivors there is room to put him in at any point
---
&gt; Where did u get those stats?
---
Literally from BHVR
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/
---
Grabs them by their neck, takes them into the upside down, camera stays in the Normal dimension and some body parts fly out then demogorgon comes out
---
Stranger Things chapter might cost more considering we get 2 new and different survivors and a killer. So it'll probably be around $10 for the whole dlc
---
I think having a xenomorph that gets stopped by a pallet it pretty lame tbh.  The Zeno would just crawl around the pallet on the debris surrounding it.
---
Lmao that that's real
---
When is it coming out? When is it coming out? When is it coming out? When is it coming out? When is it coming out? When is it coming out? When is it coming out? When is it coming out?

It‚Äôs not ‚Äúpopular=bad‚Äù. That‚Äôs not the words I said that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre assuming. Again it‚Äôs an objectively bad show with not so good acting.
---
I fondly remember the first time I booted up the game. 
---
I wanted to do things *right* so I played the survivor tutorial, as you do. Then went into a game and *died* on the hook within the first thirty seconds. Literally. Because the *helpful* tutorial tells you which button to smash to get off the hook, even let's you practice doing it, but it *doesn't* tell you about the failure rate of trying to unhook yourself. 
---
I'm in favor of a practice killer AI segment. Or *something*.
---
it‚Äôs confirmed dude
---
Hype doesn‚Äôt equate that Stranger Things needs to be in dbd
---
How does that explain the massive like to view ratio difference between the two videos?
---
I personally think the  ~~ghostface~~ demogorgan could be the coolest killer yet
---
Models are here apparently: https://www.bleedingcool.com/2019/08/19/stranger-things-is-officially-coming-to-dead-by-daylight/
---
It really won‚Äôt
---
Yeah same here, I‚Äôm not particularly the greatest at this game. However I‚Äôve been rank 1 both on killer and survivor, I play both regularly and I rarely don‚Äôt kill at least 3 survivors per game.
---
On the flip side, I play solo survivor quite a lot in addition to killer and games can/will go sideways on me pretty often just because some of the other survivors are being less than optimal.
---
Aren‚Äôt we getting a map too? I thought so.
---
no shit
---
LEATHERFACE WATCH OUT JASON BOURNES GONNA SHOOT YOU!!!!
---
BOI WHOS WRONG NOW?!
---
Honestly this might be an exception to the no monsters ru, is guess all monsters that do come to the game would be licensed, if any more. Also no way with konami.
---
You think so I was thinking more like 12
---
We're getting a map but when you buy the dlc you don't really pay for the map
---
Scroll down. Steve looks great.
---
would be cool if it was 2 survivors on 1 body
---
I play both roles equally
---
I was trying to be a little optimistic about it but it could be more than $10
---
oh my god I really hope those are the models they look goooood
---
That's some grade A comedy.
---
He is super easy to play and super easy to win as unless I'm just special.
---
Former EMS student says good luck. Even if you don't become a para-medic the knowledge in advanced first aid can save a life if disaster strikes.

---
Waitwaitwaitwait, you can lightburn nurse? Does it have to be while she is blinking? Over 600 hours in game and I never knew that...
---
If 5-10 dollars is too much to pay for DLC then maybe you need a better job and a better purse management system.
---
They might still have the same perks
---
Then why Hag is the deadliest killer and Nurse isn't? The answer is because those stats aren't ranked.
---
So wait what other Stranger things are there, I know they announced that there ere 4 companies that they were gonna cross over and so far we got fortnite and dbd, what are the other 2?
---
That'd be the most boring power ever.
---
you mean all 4 escaping? no. but I've seen 2 or 3 escape. just because he rarely gets a 100% loss doesnt mean he's OP, it just means he's good. survivors being the winners is not the yardstick by which killers are judged OP or not. If anything, survivors should lose most of the time to fit the theme of a slasher simulator.
---
When tinkerer pops on 4 gens
---
What's bait about it? It's my honest feelings.
---
This post we're under is only the start to the karmawhoring present here on the DbD subreddit since Stranger Things is coming to DbD.
---
Im so sick of seeing this stupid show everywhere. Now it's invading one of my favorite games and I won't hear the end of it. It's the largest special DLC I've ever seen for one of the stupidest things under the sun.
---
RIP MY DUDE üëÄüëÄ
---
Lol I was gonna say this as well we technically get Nancy it's not the Nancy we wanted but a better one.
---
It's confidential information.  It'll vary by killer and they won't release that information.
---
I'm guessing the entity will appear in stranger things merch and act like he isnt a mega fan and he isnt sure why it's there now lol
---
I meant that as the secondary power like Freddy's teleport.
---
It‚Äôs a pretty bad show. I really hope the people who play dbd that decide to watch the show give their honest opinion here. A lot of people are afraid of the downvotes but I encourage people to voice their opinion because isn‚Äôt that what the internet is for? There‚Äôs ‚Äúlet people enjoy things‚Äù and then there‚Äôs ‚Äúsaturating everything with a shitty tv show‚Äù.
---
Watch out everyone we stopped being toxic and got exited for a game. Fun police are here.
---
Don‚Äôt stop sprinting and juke right before you think the killer is gonna swing.
---
FFFFFFFFFFFF
---
FFFFFFFFFFFf
---
FFFF
---
FFFFFFFFFFFFF
---
Addons ? Caould have it like freddy's new addons so where every survivor in the upside down causes a debuff on all other survivors.
---
A camera-room that both survivor and killer can look at would be sick
---
Predator won't ever get added because of Hunting Grounds.
---
This is almost certainly not information either side of the deal is going to want to share. The agreement probably has some kind of NDA regarding the details.
---
This is irrelevant because Hag is a really strong and underrated killer
---
Thanks to you too man
---
Eh Clown slices a finger off. Hag rips out a ton of organs.
---
It shouldn't be too hard from a cosmetics/per survivor standpoint. Just something like *NOM* and the head is replaced with a bloody stump.
---
Can't wait to see what the offering for the map is. Also jumpscare Myers got a indirect buff which is nice.
---
I hope hes actually immune to flashlights
---
I'm blue for spirit
---
Yo this is #3 on trending!!!!! I‚Äôm so happy
---
No I'm saying be excited but don't hype it up so much that when you find out it isn't what you expected it ruins the chapter.
---
I feel the same way about the people responding to my posts saying it'd be too expensive for bvhr. Like they act as if these devs are poor and like they know what it costs for these licensing deals.
---
Xenomorph is very unlikely given the existence of Predator Hunting Grounds.  I imagine that Fox/Disney would be more interested in keeping those two licenses near each other and not parsed out.
---
Entity is mindflayer confirmed /s
---
This is dumb, the game is so much more popular now
---
Game is good in concept but terrible in execution.
---
They need to fix pallet spawns. On that map, the winner is rarely decided by who played better. It's decided by whether map generation favors "competely empty rooms" or "safe pallets in every room".
---
There is no in between.
---
I know what you're saying, and best scenario is they create a new character model for it -- but I seriously doubt that because it would probably break the game. Again, it's a creepy lurking monster, so seeing it walk around upright constantly just isn't going to work, we've all seen the Demogorgan from the show, so yeah, sorry to disappoint you dude. 
---
Maybe, maybe they figured a way to make the Human model viable and keep its monster factor, but for me, it's Hag or its jank.
---
New Perk, Hex: Teleportation. Don't mess with those totems.
---
I mean yeah but some hype is still okay, and I‚Äôd rather be speculating than complaining
---
Even if the devs at one point said they'd only make human killers or killers that were human before, they also said they'd never make a clown killer. So.
---
Same. ST survivors are fine but a random Demogorgon killer is so lame.
---
Ok i saw your stats.
---
One thing to keep in mind is that when i (a red rank) queue up with some low ranks, those low ranks definetly have a much lower survival rate than me.
---
What your stats don't tell you is if there is a difference of survival rate between the better ranked players in a SWF, and the lower ranked players of the SWF. 
---
We have a guy in our SWF group that literally dies almost every games lol
---
If only
---
I think it'll have to do more with its inhuman anatomy. Possibly climbing over jungle gyms or as someone else suggested, speed. Hopefully I'm wrong as that would be boring.
---
Could have that as a passive ability and for downing someone make it so he could charge up and pounce while charging he goes on all fours and has now terror raduous but make it so it has to be done while moving so you cant just ambush like the pig.
---
Maybe devs should make strong killer perks which are activated when they are at a certain diatance from hooked survivors like make you choice or perk which gives bp when killer hits/chase/down survivors away from hooked one. Or maybe make survivor perks which are activated if killer is idel near hooked survivors for a certain amount of time. Like crows come near survivors who do nothing. Maybe revealing killer aura if they are near hooked survivor doing nothing.
---
It's probably the most avoidable perk in the game if Survivors spent an extra 20 seconds each to break a totem. Like holy shit, if the people complaining about NOED spent the same amount of effort to breaking totems, not a single killer would run NOED. Granted, it will still get the new players at rank 20, but those people will learn totem placements/what a totem even is and then it will never be a problem for them again.
---
I personally play only solo Survivor and break at least three myself every game and it's literally free points. I believe they even buffed how many points you get from break the totems as well so I am not sure why NOED is a problem anymore...
---
And to all the people saying "it's too hard to keep track of how many are broken" "We need to a audible/visual notification when all totems are broken". No, you don't need those things. Just take a lap when there are 1 to 2 gens left and see if there are any totems left, and count in your head how many broken totems you see. If you see 5 broken totems, NOED is gone, if you see anything less, you'll probably find the last totem(s) and can break them.
---
It's so simple to counter NOED, but people just don't want to put in the slightest bit of effort into breaking the 5 totems, even tho most of them can be found within twenty feet of a gen. Get off your butts, and break the damn totems.
---
Exit camping I don‚Äôt have a problem with because the survivor shouldn‚Äôt have hung around in the first place even though I wait for the last person to escape or be killed before I leave but then I understand that if I go down and get camped its entirely on me but it‚Äôs just shitty to try to play the game and have fun then somebody come ruin it before gens are even finished in a game I‚Äôm doing especially well in
---
I totally thought that post yesterday about Netflix teasing it on Twitter was a joke but here I am a fool but happy nonetheless
---
More like the killer would be konami and the survivors would be Silent Hill and all their other franchises üò≠ Spoiler: they all die in a Pachinko hall.
---
Everyone's here!
---
I must not have gotten it often enough to properly decide then. Especially since i usually ignore pallets in favor of windows when i can. Especially at a double T-wall or something, makes the chase go from hard to easy.
---
They are so high quality wtf!
---
Yea I know but people are really hyping this up as the best thing ever created. I don't mind speculation but we got to keep our hype levels a decent amount because I did it with Ghostface and I was completely underwhelmed
---
You put the wrong logo for Freddy
---
I think the original idea was that the killers were all at some point human, and weren't always the fucked up being they currently are. Maybe this opens up the idea that demogorgons were human at some point, that could be interesting, although somewhat of a spoiler potentially.
---
Either way I'm down with the new chapter.
---
whatever. as long as you admit SWF isn't some fucking kryptonite like you were acting before
---
so thanks for playing
---
Fair point, I pretty much copied the Walter Sullivan concept.
---
I'm just a SH4, fan girl
---
The lawsuit is over. Sean Cunningham originally filed an appeal but then dropped it before filing it again but he is strongly expected to drop it again.
---
&gt; (and there are pretty good reasons why she has a higher kill rate than Nurse)
---
The reason is super simple. Nurse is a difficult to play Killer, and in the wrong hands she does Awfull.
---
Hag is much easier to play.
---
If we looked only at stats of top tier red ranks, Nurse is clearly better.
---
You gotta be carefull when looking at stats.
---
You have to blind her whilst she's charging the blink in her hand, not while shes in the blink or in fatigue. Its basically impossible.
---
Well. You refered to dataminers. So, no. Datminers knew it.
---
Nobody fucking cares.  Go whine to your therapist ffs.
---
I never said anyone was *wrong* for thinking it was the demo, I was just stating my opinion uwu
---
Out of interest how much of the show have you seen? Just most people rave for it so it's interesting to see someone crap on it so hard. I can agree some of the characters are weak but some are fantastic and I have enjoyed the plot, all of this is IMO of course.
---
I kind of see what you're saying. Right now everyone is flooding us with posts about it and getting all hyped up which, cool you're excited we get it.. But if it doesnt meet expectations we'll again have millions of posts about whats wrong with him. Did this happen with Ghostface too? I didn't have reddit at the time when he was released.
---
Unless you are expecting 6 perks just like Mettle of Man (super broken meta), I am quite confident the new perks will be incredibly useful and fun in their own way. 
---
I am rarely hyped about new chapters and maps are always my favorite thing about every DLC but this one is getting my interest purely because it will add 9 perks and finally a new indoor map.
---
I didn't even mention the killer and his power, which could be a positive or negative surprise but since I always end up going back to billy and nurse, I don't really care but that doesn't stop me from being hyped about the DLC package.
---
I really like the official theme, but I unsurprisingly still really like yours more! :)))
---
This could be SO GREAT !
---
I bought DBD because I heard about ghostface coming to the game. Wasn‚Äôt underwhelmed but it seemed like people were just mad there was no map or survivor and that his power could be hard countered very easily.
---
Oh I don't mind it walking up right I just don't want them to reuse hags just original animations would be nice
---
Doesn't Legion already have an add on that does that?
---
Very true. In this game you dont naturally feel a connection to the killers like you feel a connection to survivors, because the killers are not human looking and dont really speak.
---
Why do you think I‚Äôm posting this
---
I wasnt whining. I‚Äôm just curious lol
---
Please don‚Äôt bait a reaction
---
I'm really hoping for The Thing and MacReady.
---
The fact that you're dropping Ace for some young punk is just sad
---
You believe that a Hag at red ranks is deadlier than a Nurse? and you believe that a SWF at red ranks is equally optimal as a rank 18 SWF?
---
I wasn‚Äôt complaining ?
---
What was the price for licensed and non-licensed chapters before this?
---
I didn't care for either just Ghostface but God I got disappointed fast
---
Dude, regardless, they said it. Why would you expect people to not believe it if the devs said it? What is your problem?
---
In the words of thanos ‚ÄúEverything‚Äù
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Lol, so I'm guessing you're new around these parts...
---
Is Pinhead ever going to actually happen, or did the Clive Barker website lie?
---
Yeah, back when 13 generators and 8 survivors could spawn &lt;3
---
It sounds more like you need to check your own hype, it‚Äôs not up to other people to not get exited so that you‚Äôre not disappointed.
---
STEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVE
---
This is me. When this game first came out, I really didn‚Äôt give it any mind. But now it‚Äôs basically the Super Smash Bros of horror games and I‚Äôm seriously considering picking it up to rep some of my favourite horror franchises.
---
&lt;3
---
They modeled a basic hardware store for Ghostface and nothing came out of it, so if anything it might just be something in a room that has no real bearing on the map.
---
1) Nurse is not that tough. It only takes a few matches to learn the muscle memory 
---
2) Hag is not easier to play than Nurse. And because of that most players who try her suck with her and don't try with her after that, so generally it's people who are good at Hag who are playing her (evidenced by the popularity vs. kill rate numbers)
---
&gt; You gotta be carefull when looking at stats.
---
Take your own advice, Captain Anecdote
---
i won't listen to it. i want to hear it ingame when it releases there ( as if me replaying the trailer isn't enough. seriously i cant stop )
---
Yeah this has existed since day one, your frame rate becomes uncapped. Either you can not play the game, or buy a new PS4. Devs haven‚Äôt fixed it
---
Doctor is easier to learn but that's about the only advantage. Spirit is much stronger once you are good at her.
---
As of now, we can only speculate until Behavior releases an official statement on this.
---
You can‚Äôt compare these? Lmao the Halloween chapter came out like 3 years ago. The game barely had a following then. Plus, it was when Halloween had no additional hype. This is an incredibly unstable comparison.
---
Oh no I'm sayings it's ok to be hyped but don't overhype it to the point it'll make you disappointed that it isn't what you want. And I agree I hope they're fun but I'm looking at this from what they did in the past
---
well Spirit is stronger and as long as you use Headphones, its easy to track.
---
Doctor isnt Bad either, but a totally different playstyle
---
stranger thing is horror?
---
This is amazing... And i'm so happy we get Nancy and Steve!
---
(was also hoping for 11 for a telekinetic perk...)
---
Most importantly, this is our first creature killer!
---
The only triggered one here is you, and you're very clearly wrong too. Learn to accept being wrong instead of throwing a fit.
---
And then turned it into a gaudy looking pachinko slot machine -_-
---
We should now by tomorrow morning.
---
# Its real gorgon hours
---
But they were right? I mean its not like people are discussing ST story, making threads on a favorite character or theorizing what will happen in Season 4. They are discussing future licensed content for DBD and basing it off rumors and hints they saw, which many people assumed was just conspiracy but now all those people are proven right.
---
Laugh it up, funnyman! Laugh it up!
---
STEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVE
---
Well it doesn't exactly sound like you're happy abt dbd adding the demogorgon
---
Who?
---
Omg I forgot about that xD
---
I had someone who facecamped me once say that they liked watching streams and camping because that was what was  fun for them, and that, I should stop being an entitled survivor. 
---
...
---
Why would you play the game if you want to just stand still, ruining someone's else's fun, and watch a livestream?
---
It kinda did. He got leaked and everyone got excited and just got completely let down by it, ability too weak, doesn't look like Scream Ghostface etc.
---
Just looked at the steam page, there's no difference in price between licensed and non-licensed chapters. So far it's been 6.99 USD for survivor and killer, and 4.99 USD for just a killer or just a survivor. Since there's an added survivor to this chapter it might be 3-4 dollars more than a full chapter
---
It‚Äôll probably have to be either tomorrow or the 27th of this month, as the release of the chapter will go live in the late summer.
---
what twisted narritive lol im saying the killer would not have teabagged in your context of she is innocent cause why would he unless she was toxic during the game but the only people that know ae the people who played so like chill
---
"Blood Spatter*" - Dexter
---
I was hoping for Hopper as a surv but there's a lot of survivors already similar to him in look/demeanor, and I can't complain about Nancy and The Hair
---
Oh shit nm I just noticed this is from three days ago my bad
---
the killer
---
Yea that's what I'm doing and I'm telling others to do it also so it doesn't happen to them. I want everyone to enjoy the new chapter and not be disappointed
---
inb4 his power has nothing to do with old freddy and you called absolutely nothing.
---
Fair
---
&gt; You believe that a Hag at red ranks is deadlier than a Nurse?
---
Literally all I said is that she's a high tier killer, not that she's deadlier. But she has a higher skill ceiling than Nurse and is generally played by better players who know her mechanics well and that is the determining factor. Nurse gets her numbers dragged down by a bunch of low rank players being boosted
---
&gt;  and you believe that a SWF at red ranks is equally optimal as a rank 18 SWF?
---
I know that SWF means jack shit as far as survival goes and neither of you people have done anything to indicate otherwise in literally any way whatsoever
---
Thank you both!
---
If they do we riot
---
He‚Äôs actually one of the developers of the game haha.
---
f
---
Mr T Lexify back
---
It's the hair, killers love the hair... its easy to spot.
---
He's a community manager from Behaviour, the game developer.
---
I mean as long as we get Steve with a scoops ahoy cosmetic what could go wrong
---
I forgot to mention that so I want to get into high ranks,(red is too extreme for me so say purple) have fun and not No1 priority but have some cool perks for my other killers
---
Ah I see. This game has a massive emotional hold on the community sometimes hahah.
---
Fair enough, but I don't think it will have the exact build and animations as the Hag, just her character model physics and attack animations. Remember, this thing doesn't have a weapon -- which just got me thinking, maybe it has a lunging bite as it's basic attack instead of a claw strike...hmm, that would work. The walking and perhaps crouching can all be tweaked to make it unique like how Legion, Ghostface and Pig are different, but the same, you know what I mean? Either way, the PTB will be next week I hear, so we'll know soon enough.
---
What part of the game is Pay to Win?
---
bruh it's lkk 8 bucks
---
But nobody said that. Everyone loves licensed killers/survivors
---
Let people have fun you crusty boy
---
The grind is ridiculous though
---
Please I'm desperate, i need the blood points.
---
This guy gets it
---
Ivy from RE2 and two survivors. Nice. Btw I have Netflix and haven't watched Stranger Things.
---
Alot actually. Demogorgon being OP, being bad,Steve having bad perks or OP perks, Nancy having bad perks and Good perks, Abilities being messed up. I want people to have fun but I don't want people overhyping it.
---
Thanks! I tried to get creative with it and figured this would be a cool new mechanic :)
---
I am just don't want people ruining it for themselves with them overhyping the dlc like I did previously.
---
"cant be arsed to source my information, just take it as truth and stop talking"
---
never change reddit...
---
When I know where the killer is but a teammate doesn't I sometimes use the point emote of the direction of the killer if they're approaching with the intent of saying "ay they're coming from that way watch out"  
---
Sometimes my teammate instead runs in the direction I point which is obviously the exact OPPOSITE of what I was trying to say. They have a different understanding every time so I wanted to know if the "point" emote is a universal "killer is coming from that way" or if it's a "please run that way" emote?
---
Oh man, looks like I‚Äôm gonna have to retire ole Ash. Ya done good you groovy bastard!
---
NOW THIS! This is beautiful!
---
Art.
---
I hope it doesn't have teleport. I like playing Freddy and Hag but f playing against them. We don't need more of that mechanic.
---
That would be cool, but doubt they will do it. Too gory
---
NOW THIS! This is beautiful
---
This theory is going around a lot, but its straight up wrong.
---
Resident Evil pls
---
rip to this guy lmao
---
Oh, you're just like milk.
---
bro what the fuck, they haven't released the chapter yet and they already decapitated him
---
That's not it at all I am not going through hours of videos to find one sentence I don't care if you believe me or not it's not my problem.
---
I'm not trying to be negative Im excited for it but I don't want overhype as I've seen in the past overhype can make a loud fuss in the community and I want everyone to keep their expectations reasonable so they get their max enjoyment out of it.

fuck man, now my hatred towards ST has reached maximum 
---
fuck that show
---
It is not recognized as a bannable exploit. People do not get banned for doing it. Streamers (even fog whisperers) do it frequently and it doesn't cause any reprimentive action from developers who often are present in the chat.
---
You can sling ad hominems as much as you want, it won't change the fact that this is not a bannable offense and reporting it won't do anything.
---
Wrong
---
If you aren't hooked beforehand.
---
Nemesis!
---
lmao this is hilarious
---
You just have me an idea... Leatherface has his masks for survivors, so maybe Predator could get an outfit with skull/spine trophies after getting a certain amount of 4K or merciless games.
---
Or its just a splinter, and everyone disconnects making me lose my splinter...yeah I'm sad about it ;_;
---
Okay, then this comunity must be crazy, Nurse isn't the deadliest and they want her nerfed. And it seems like SWF and Solo have the same survival rate, so Solo is perfectly balanced and doesn't need a single buff, thanks for enlightening me.
---
Look at my other comments. In trying to look out for those easily disappointed and want them to have the most enjoyment out of the characters they love and if I got to be a honest ass then I will
---
Of all of the perks, Monitor and Abuse is the best one, but I wouldn't buy the killer just for the one perk.
---
I would go for Spirit if you want to have a viable killer at purple ranks. She's easily one of the better killers in the game, and if you already have some decent experience playing killer you should pick up on her fairly easily.
---
WRONG. At least on XBOX, when I did so, it didn't work.
---
The community when all of it becomes cringe
---
Someone doesnt know how to play Hag right. Just sayin
---
Jesus fuck you're paranoid.
---
When you've been on the hook and they give you that look,
---
That'sa Mooori
---
When you're hoping for a save but you end in the grave,
---
That'sa Moooori
---
As someone who has never watched Stranger Things, the Demogorgon looks so badass I have no choice but to put it in my main repertoire. Looks like Wraith, Legion, and Ghostface will have to make room for one more.
---
Wait is this real or fan made
---
&gt;DS, an uncounter-able survivor perk that activates whenever the survivor is unhooked, is ludicrous. I say DS is uncounterable because it lasts for a full minute in which a lot of gens can get done if you slug and wait or wait for the survivor to jump out of the locker.
---
That's not true. If you weren't Tunnelling the Survivior then the full 60 seconds is never the time you have to wait to get them back on the hook. And if you were Tunnelling them, then you shouldn't expect sympathy. The perk discourages Tunnelling by design, but that's not everything it does. It helps if someone saves you and they didn't have BT as well. You can counter decisive by not picking them up a minute after unhooking them. 
---
If you down them, you have a hook worth of map pressure right there. leave them and go pressure gens. This is why I have no sympathy for killers, y'all are victim complex ridden crybabies who can't stand the idea of Surviviors actually trying to survive.
---
I love builds with perks that compliment each other, it‚Äôs so much more fun to play like that.
---
yeah and i see bamboozle used alot, and coulraphobia can be good for my doctor build
---
Yes, but No
---
This is the most excessively complicated fanmade killer power I've ever seen.
---
im losing, i had 4 before DC, after 3. restarted game, still 3, after next game (safety) still 3
---
Nice meme, may I have the pic without the writing to use some ideas?
---
I got Spirit Fury in the shrine.
---
Good to know from both sides. Thank you
---
.. I don't like stranger Things and yet any characters from this are going to be x100 more used than Ash was on release day. Stranger by Daylight here I come..
---
Thats a no from me chief.
---
What map is coming with it? Hoping it‚Äôs will Byers house
---
Definitely the worst Scary Movie imo
---
Probs going to cost $10 :/
---
They could just do a second ST chapter ;). They have a lot of potential Killers, [ALL SERIES SPOILERS] &gt;Demodog, Flayed Billy, Russian Terminator, plus anyone else for the next seasons&lt;
---
So be it. That's your opinion, I used to have this mindset as well and I passed on many great things bexause of it.
---
Currently I can only buy with iridescent shards ( meaning I cant get myer freddy leatherface pig ghostface or the upcoming demogorgon)
---
Lol you say ‚Äúget rid of these constant fan panders‚Äù and then recommend very popular fan panders. It just seems you have something against stranger things, which I guess I can‚Äôt argue with.
---
They fixed Freddy, just a little later than I hoped. Also the viability of pig is debatable, short answer is just practice and learn how to use her dash and she immediately becomes decent. And Myers op?? This is what made me think bait post!
---
Would the survivors see it too like a husk?
---
That doesn‚Äôt change the chance that it‚Äôs free. Every DLC is very cheap the only difference is that there are many of them. So buy them in available portions. Spend 6 dollars on a DLC you want and then later spend another 6 when you can. Not that hard.
---
I GET DIS SHET SO MUCH TOO DUUDE
---
Gotta admit, I wasn't expecting two survivors. That actually shocked me.
---
**OI, JOSUKE!**
---
1. No.
---
2. Fuck whatever survivors say. They're all salty as fuck. (Survivor main)
---
Imagine this fucking reject of a person getting most upvotes, I need to relief some anger on a boxing bag or something, you're literal cancer, watch out with telling people u play dbd because you might actually get smacked once you open your mouth to me.
---
My comment remains true unless they have changed something in the 2 months I've been playing on xbox.
---
Nah, they said 2 survivors and they showed them at the same time. It‚Äôd be real ballsy for it to be a skin
---
He'd better fuckin get a scoops ahoy cosmetic set sometime soon.
---
Excellence in shitpostingüëç
---
I don't really think stealth is much fun for many players on either side.
---
Most of survivors don't play this game to hold m1 for 5 minutes and hide in a corner, the kilers don't play it to look into dark corners to see if someone is squatting there. This game greatly benefits from focusing on the chase aspect.
---
XD adding it
---
I've only played this game for like 2 or 3 hours but this looks awesome. Definitely gotta try it again.
---
SCREEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
---
Because of the clown thing? Because its a dumb, arbitrary, limiting thing to say?
---
I see your art all the time and it's all awesome, gotta hit that follow at this point! Keep up the good work! üëçüëçüëç
---
Haven't watched the show yet, but I did want Barb as a survivor
---
I'd say no but might require testing because i am not sure how strong/weak that power really is.
---
And the rest of idiots defending the "its impossible because of the lore".
---
GG
---
You escape the killers grasp every time a killer picks you up
---
Its only fair after a skinny ghost face chapter
---
As a Dwight main I feel this. I still don't feel good about betraying my pizza boy.
---
Not blind, just shine the flashlight anywhere on her body, similar to Wraith.
---
Thanks dude! Glad you like it.
---
Neg Run demogoedriogion (purposfuly spelled wrong) It get pallet mouth syndrome
---
i miss the old decisive strike haha
---
Actually i feel like its very straight forward power. Let me summarize it in an easier way.
---
You have an husk following you around with a 10 seconds delay, and you can teleport to it using your power.
---
Well she got way more screen time in parts 1 and 2, so it‚Äôs not really a fair comparison
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to the idea
---
Quinten and Laurie also need Face Reworks
---
There are posts saying Shrek will be a killer.
---
What will be impressive is of someone gets their power/perks right
---
I love this whole conversation right here
---
If that's the case then they can see it too, but there's an add-on that doesn't let you see it
---
I'm guessing they will work with each other.
---
Damn that beat goes hard!
---
it would take a looooong time to figure out, but that sounds actually pretty nice
---
Shhhh don‚Äôt ruin it for me
---
It‚Äôs called the demogorgon
---
Bamboozle is totally unneeded on Clown since he can force medium vaults with his ability
---
Optimization never stopped being worked on and we are getting new maps over time by fixing the messed up ones. Just like Freddy got 5 new variants, we can expect to see each realm get reworked versions and even new ones too.
---
#1 now
---
One of the devs confirmed that Steve and Nancy are different survivors with different perks
---
Haha thanks buddy. I'm really excited for the next chapter :) it's awesome that it has 2 survivors too.
---
I'd love a fnaf chapter
---
They don‚Äôt but Franklins nullifies White Wards which is what OP is asking if anyone else finds annoying
---
Related - doesn‚Äôt discordance get worse each tier?
---
If you look at her, she turns you to stone. Pretty simple Gorgon mythology.
---
Its also worth noting, the "Humans only" rule, isnt even a lore thing. Its actually "humanoids only" and it has nothing to do with lore, it has to do with the devs not wanting to have to make a new skeleton frame for new killers.
---
I know right? The Demogorgon looks pretty scary too and Steve looks cool.
---
But then we wouldn't have pig leading to the end of the world
---
Because there more icon characters than anything else in the game currently
---
fucking humanoid killers only my ass
---
Cause this community is fucking toxic and act like 12 year olds when they dont get what they want
---
I know the closest one was broken already
---
You talking about me man? I put hag in top 4 of all killers for console. Fucking love the hag.  Honestly I think the 4 killers I listed are pretty equal and I pretty much listed them by how fun they are to play lol.
---
Dude I can‚Äôt even get it cause my acc is from Spain
---
They are the worst for gameplay, but the best ones for the appearance.
---
Japan what the fuck?
---
I mean it‚Äôs just the case of iconic characters make more money really ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
&gt;Crazier things have happened
---
Did you go out of your way to not say *Stranger Things* have happened?
---
Why do they act like they cant dismantle traps maybe look its common sense
---
No one is mad about it. Genrushing is just a term to describe survivors being efficient on the objective and denoting the fact that gens get done too quickly
---
Either that \[which would be cool, but I see it being unlikely\], or it'd be like the houses in Badham and Haddonfield, where the lights flicker if a gen is nearby.
---
Even looking for the totem can be risky though as if you get found, there‚Äôs a high chance you are dead. I can see why people often decide to stick around the exit gates or just straight up leave, especially in lower ranks where the survivors aren‚Äôt as confident and don‚Äôt know the ins/outs of every perk.
---
The finger remains on their corpse after the clown mori, Theres no hole in their body for the hag mori.
---
That would be great. I would also love second chapters for some of the other licensed chapters like SAW, Nightmare, and Halloween.
---
Ah, I see you are a man of sensibility as well
---
Ye but the time it takes to shine the light is longer than the actual stun so not really worth it
---
I wonder how the Demogorgon's prestige will go. Will it be like Hag and make one arm a cosmetic, the body, and then the head?
---
Nah, I think I'm gonna stay.
---
WELL I GOT NEWS FOR YOU PAL
---
I like the reveal trailer one better than this
---
That article was written April 2018 and says ‚Äúexpect it this fall‚Äù so after an entire year passing by I think it‚Äôs safe to assume the website is lying.
---
You posted this just before the trailer came out. F
---
In a world of masked cereal killers and massive factories and cornfields, its kinda weird to have an actual monster and a laboratory, but I like it.
---
Because almost no survivor runs calm spirit so you pretty much always know where they are. It's been a really long time since anyones escaped me as the doctor and I only put myself as an "average" killer. Not even remotely good.
---
Thrilling Tremors, Make your Choice, Blood Warden, Save the Best for Last, and Surveillance. And BBQ, as you pointed out. Those are all top tier perks.
---
Okay then we can come up with a solution. Replace Pigs Beartrap power with the ability to send out a medium speed Billy doll on a Tricycle that tracks survivors and leads you to them. As soon as it gets within a certain distance of a survivor it stops moving and starts laughing. To use it again just pick it up.
---
I mean, there‚Äôs nothing left for us to talk about, is there?
---
Whenever I've run into people mentioning it they're disparaging survivors by calling them gen rushers and complaining about toolboxes
---
Yea I tried to mention that in my post but I couldn't remember the technical details just that the devs said it was difficult to do anything other than a human.
---
It‚Äôs fine. That whole movie series was the weakest of the slasher movies anyways
---
it's the Hawkins Lab
---
Plague talks, ash talks, nurse literally avoids the game mechanics, but why complain for this?
---
&gt;chunky
---
Bruh, do you know the implications of having children, you either gotta make THEM the killers by making them proportional, or have a must pick survivor. Believe it or not, kids are small.
---
That article was published on April Fools day. Likely was a joke unless something else was posted about it since then.
---
That's a new one...
---
bro u better stay tf calm or ima come over there n slap u boi
---
Anyone else download this
---
I've been running Kindred a lot recently, since i play 99% solo, it helps guarantee you get unhooked. Its rough trading a perk for it though.
---
And somehow the Bill mains will find a way to still be the worst players in the game.
---
Something I‚Äôm hoping with the new servers coming with the dlc hopefully i wonder if their is a cam room and you can see survivors on it
---
If a kid has deliverance when the doors are open that means it was his first hook, so yea, thats how it works. Its the killers fault for not doing his job and getting that survivor on a hook atleast once earlier in the match, not the perks fault‚Äôs for doing their job.
---
Unless everyone pops something to space out hooks killer will arrive at any hook anywhere on map with 5-10 seconds to spare so he had time to take you to another one.
---
And Ripley! Both shirtless of course.
---
Dont get me wrong i love the game, thats why ive been playing it for over 2 years but i would assume before new content comes out they could fix the main issues like the hit boxes. People have been complaining for years about this one item.
---
That sounds absolutely terrifying
---
Ahhhhhhhh
---
Because people.
---
Freddy first
---
He needs a Robert england outfit And a New Nightmare Freddy Outfit
---
I was more stating it to highlight even further how ridiculous these claims of the lore being ruined are.
---
Honestly I think that you could probably get away with just the totem counter/incentives to cleanse. Most of the time, I can tell if a killer has it before they hit me anyway so I don‚Äôt think this change would actually make that much of a difference to anyone except these ‚Äúcocky survivors‚Äù I‚Äôve heard so much about in this thread.
---
Can't disagree there, i've been running Kindred for that reason. Solo play is rough sometimes, and it helps.
---
If you enjoy it I honestly would just pay no attention if other people dont. They arent gping to make the devs change their mind so just look forward to it in your own way :) you gotta remember everybody is different and theres a lot of platforms to voice opinions on.
---
Original gameplay looks very DBD-ish:
---
[https://youtu.be/HKlNISxYfdU?t=37](https://youtu.be/HKlNISxYfdU?t=37)
---
Am I the only person who doesn‚Äôt want this and thinks there are many better other options?
---
Kindred is great but survivors in low ranks really don't pay attention to that kind of stuff because they're inexperienced
---
Yea I know but j want people to get the most out of the chapter and if you think I'm wrong that's  fine im just looking out for people and for them to get the most out of their buck it doesn't come from hate but from kindness atleast from what I tell myself
---
All we know is that it's coming out in September. People are guessing that it's going to be on the PTB next week but we still don't know for sure.
---
Legit?
---
Probably never if we are being totally honest.
---
Cannae fuckin wait to take a selfie with Steve while playing as Ghostface when he comes out. Add that to the celeb pics along with Ash and Bill.
---
I wonder if it will attack with it's mouth or hand
---
Content always releases on a Tuesday. Don‚Äôt know why, it just does.
---
I hope you‚Äôll be able to see the room with the gate
---
I watched the whole 3 seasons in a span of 5 days. You could just get their 7 day trial and watch the whole thing.
---
Okay, now I'm hyped
---
Anyone care to speculate about perks?
---
Like, on one hand, you're right. But, as far as their audience is concerned, dbd players is a small subset of their fans. They're not really pranking many people. Seems like a pretty lame prank if it is one.
---
Well I accept that I won't downvoted you for your opinion it's better we have a reasonable discussion. Why do you feel he'll be this way?
---
Have you had the item for a lot of matches? Idk how many for sure but I swear the item eventually disappears if you live with it for a certain amount of matches.
---
Oh sure, but not by too much. I'm hoping we get a huge Killer some time,  but honestly given how some Killers almost touch the tops of doorways on current maps, I doubt we ever will.
---
Whenever the licensers agree to it.
---
Holy holy bills... always screwaing up the team.
---
I love for honor but sweet Jesus it‚Äôs the most frustrating game I‚Äôve ever played
---
SWF groups only survived 5% more than solo queues. 
---
Also this is mostly hilarious rhetoric because of how ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù Mettle or Man was before it got its kneecaps blown out.
---
But the chapter before that we only got a survivor.
---
Just give me the Sinister Chapter already...
---
Just dont look at the exit gate
---
That's because you were raised in a different environment where that's frowned upon. You are looking from the outside my guy
---
Yessss ! They did so good. Steve is baby, I‚Äôm so glad he isn‚Äôt melted like Quinton. Fingers crossed for Scoops Ahoy! cosmetics lol
---
The most important thing is that you have fun. I think Legion is fun. A fast paced killer with really great ways to change up the play style. Takes a moment to get used to the flow of things, but definitely a fun killer. Even more fun, I think, is the Plague. Her style is so unique. Even if nobody cleanses and she becomes an M1 killer, I still think she is the funnest to play.
---
Ghost face's shtick was that he wanted to be infamous, he had a strong drive and meticulously stalked and planned for it. I think to do all that you have to have a strong drive. And the feelings don't have to be malevolent either, just look at plague, she just wanted to save her people, so much so that she cut off her toe to try to gain favor of her god and then banished herself from her city and people to save them. They all seem to have intense purposes or strong feelings (like spirit), and i think the lore even mentions how that gains the entity's attention
---
Shirtless Steve
---
True, I'm right, you're wrong, its very cleared up.
---
What dumbass made this?
---
read the post dumbass
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Then somebody made the sacrifice, why is this such a big deal dude it‚Äôs just a post geez
---
They could do a Legion style thing, where you buy the Scooby Doo DLC, and then they're all just skins on the same Survivor. It would be a bit weird, but they could probably sell a decent amount of cosmetics :P
---
Wuts Goin on in dis pic?
---
I mean, you were talking about a completely different subject than I was? You literally are brain dead.
---
Doctor with Make your Choice and Haunted Ground is good if you wait until one procs to do the initial screams. Those first tier ups are the most important to the build but the snowball effect it has is amazing.
---
yeah, he's essentially mind controlled by the main baddie throughout the series and gets super strength and fucked up black veins and crap, even carries a character on his shoulder. I think he would have made a great killer
---
I believe the devs released 3 licensed killers in a row last year, with Leatherface , Freddy, and Pig. So not unbelievable they would release two in a row lol
---
‚Äú$$$$‚Äù
---
Didn't even think about that... I should have gone with that joke though, damnit.
---
You have to be actually fucking insane to think Spirit takes less skill than Nurse
---
Omg sorry for being excited about new content mr know it all
---
Steve looks accurate, Nancys face looks a bit off
---
If it kills a survivor it's not allowed.
---
The entity feeds off of emotion. That‚Äôs why the pip system is the way it is. In the lore, it wants killers to draw as much emotion out of survivors, which then is sacrificed to the entity. The entity is also only able to drag people out of places involving great pain or violence

You can, but could you actually do it before she just blinks or actually get use out of the short stun it is another question. :)

It's not mine. Its Samination's. He just got a dwight in an exit gate trap and this was the result.

Not sure if it's relevant but Freddy vs Jason was planned to end with a cameo of Pinhead implying a sequel tying in the Hellraiser lore but it was axed due to licensing issues.

Daaaaaaamn! List them all!!!!!!!!
---
take a second look at the post
---
"If it causes a survivor to die, it isnt allowed". That's the lesson for today I'm guessing.
---
Indoor maps are my absolute favorite, except when I'm trapper
---
Dragging would be cool. I saw a concept a while back of Chucky hypnotising the survivor when downed to get up and walk themselves to the hook
---
Now all three of my absolute favorite things are united. Dbd, Texas Chainsaw, and Stranger Things
---
What you do is make a pie chart ok. Then fill in, let‚Äôs say.....95% red and the other 5% blue. The red section represents the 95% of all people on the internet who are assholes. The small blue section represents the 5% of all people who aren‚Äôt assholes. I‚Äôve learned a long time ago that for some reason the most vocal people on the internet are negative. If your positive you get attacked by the negative so it keeps the positive folks away from saying anything. So always take mass complaints and brush them aside, cause they are probably just people seeking attention. If your a fan and like it, you stand true and don‚Äôt let the naysayers spoil your fun. Enjoy the shit out of whatever it is and the negative folk can suck it.
---
Well thanks for enlightening us all. You‚Äôre clearly aware of what‚Äôs going on, being the legal counsel involved in the case.

Im still alive and well &lt;3

\- most of the noobies will buy the game but not realize stranger things is dlc
---
\- some people will notice its dlc and refund
---
\- most of the noobies will buy the game on ps4 or xbox
---
\- most morons will think its a stranger things game
---
I wonder if they got their voice actors on this too
---
TIME FOR A FUCKING CRUSADE!
---
My point was if you want to pander, do some ACTUAL panders and not something stupid like Stranger Things.
---
I constantly see that PoS show everywhere and I'm tired of hearing and seeing things about it. It's a plague of a show and I wish it'd disappear off the face of this Earth along with Game of Thrones and Walking Dead.
---
They're all mediocre shows that get WAY too much attention.
---
I can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!
---
HYPE
---
It‚Äôs almost as good as Breakig Bad and The Wire so I definitely think so
---
None of the killers talked until The Plague so...
---
You still need it for certain windows like Ironworks, Grim Pantry, etc. Clown doesn't cut those loops off and those loops will absolutely lose a game when every survivor runs to them.
---
Happened to me twice yesterday, and left me very confused!
---
I'm a killer main and I gotta say this excites the hell out of me. Hopefully they get something that breaks up the meta a bit
---
(My being a major tcm fan) Just imagine Leatherface's 2003 design and his pretty woman design being in game
---
Does the formula include the possibility that each slot can be null?
---
I slept through my statistics class...
---
Survivors ALSO like to run similar sets that new killers don‚Äôt know how the counter.
---
I DID want an original killer. BUT I'm super happy about the Demogorgon, maybe even more than I would actually be with an original one.
---
What does that have to do with anything
---
Imagine human freddy with his sweater under a trench coat, kinda like New Nightmare but not burned
---
I like that
---
How about the demagorgon actually invades the Entity's realm? It is able to travel interdenominational before.  It could be that Nancy and Steve were taken by the Entity from fleeing from the demagorgon. It then ripped a gate open and followed.
---
Even with Kindred 3 they still don‚Äôt save me üò¢
---
Terrible characters? You have the depth of a small pothole evidently
---
Pig does that. Not sure they would give a second killer the same ability. I have a feeling it'll be able to teleport through lockers.
---
And imagine Leatherface's Pretty Woman and 2003 remake outfits
---
Imagine not having decent reading comprehension. I never said it was a bad show. It is one of the only shows I both to watch because unlike almost every other show at the moment, it is actually a good watch.
---
I legit thought a huntress was hacking the first time I got downed by just one hatchet. I had no idea she had anything to one shot people with
---
A lot of times green ranks is where people start getting bold and experimenting with teasing the killer, thing is they suck at teasing the killer and get down. If you're getting chased most likely they're following to get a pallet stun save or a flashlight save to further pester the killer. That is my theory
---
Well I don't mean to come off that way honestly. Not the best typing my thoughts into words so it sounds a little dickish I guess?  Yea I guess you're right
---
I play both about equally, a little more killer.
---
That has nothing to do with anything, though
---
It should be Billy
---
Well this aged poorly
---
I want to see the mori!!! Plx.
---
The original halloween chapter video actually has 850k views, you‚Äôre looking at the wrong version.

Like I said, you don't possess the intelligence to understand what's being said to you. It's really not your fault.
---
I haven't played it, how does it match up League? Because League is really up there when running ARAM or a Summoner Rift PUG.
---
It‚Äôs just going to be a hook
---
The internal optimization team is different from the team who produces any kind of content like skins or characters. It‚Äôs much more time consuming to normalize every hitbox in every situation plausible than it is to model and code cosmetics. But dedicated servers will have more fixes for hit boxes and detection.
---
I'll probably do Sawrunner as a Killer concept next, then a rough drawing of several possible maps
---
Yeah, I was thinking of something similar ish if the entity didn't actually bring the demogorgon in, there could be some elucidating lore that comes from this
---
Whats a gen jockey?

I'm not a fan of any of those maps either but I do have to agree with the post that Haddonfield being the worst. Especially for killer. Its good for survivors with balanced landing but that's about it.

Probably as hard as it was to not giggle at the 700th "It's Ghostface" "No it will never be shut up".

Oh right everyone gets the map.

I'm re-watching all the NMOES movies because of it.

Probably because they‚Äôre all the same general thing and the first one is the only one before they made the story overly convoluted. 
---
Idk why people liked them so much, the sequels are horrible movies.
---
Yeah we  need more kids sure
---
Patterns are made to be broken.
---
It's fantastic for all survivors, even without BL
---
Yeah the only issue with that is you can‚Äôt very well have children getting maimed and killed
---
could be apart of that lore thing they planned on adding like "look they ran into portal"
---
Alexei and Murray. UGH
---
idk how i feel about that lol
---
Fun fact. Behavior helped them reach America.
---
G4 just bursts through the walls like a mutated Kool Aid-Man
---
Next season starts with Steve and Nancy missing.
---
You know, sometimes when you go to hit a Kate, you hit a Meg instead.
---
We get a new map too? Hnng.
---
It's definitely a survivor friendly map but especially for BL
---
I want the nurses.
---
Gamers in general are the Karen's of the digital world
---
I‚Äôm even ok with them getting doors. It‚Äôs when they just run around attempting really stupid saves that I roll my eyes.
---
Glow sticks are too
---
Although I believe we're getting so much licensed content and would like to see what BHVR can create that is original, I am still glad that this exists.
---
Why?
---
It‚Äôs at 545k as of this moment... it‚Äôll keep growing
---
*Freddy has a sadface. Still no respect, even after rework.*
---
I mean it sucks for the people who played the game since there will never be new content added due to copyright laws
---
I wouldn't be happy to see it all over the place still. This subreddit's memes are now going to be all ST memes.
---
Take it over to the ST subreddit and leave DbD alone. Share your hype there where others give a shit
---
I guess you can say the whole idea of the killers we can have has gotten flipped "upside down"?

It's applicable to both. If the entity only needed killing machines she could just grab 20 bears and hook them up on roids or something.

Fuck every other survivor, it‚Äôs steve time

Number 2 now!!
---
Missed opportunity.  F13's rights are all over the place and Chapter 13 is coming up so we get.. Stranger things.
---
what?
---
HNNNNNNNNNNG.
---
Who is the girl? Is that El? Barb? NANCY? 
---
Will the map be the institute? I was expecting the Upside Down (well, a lot of the maps are kinda like the Upside Down actaully, hm).
---
I'm bummed there's no Hopper but I really do like Steve and Nancy so it evens out especially because there's both of them. I'm also guessing because there's Detective Tapp they don't want another cop. I'll still happily pay whatever the price though because this looks sweet.
---
Personally I'm not a fan of the show, but the Demogorgon is actually an interesting killer. It's the first true non human killer in the game and I wanna see how it goes. Who knows, maybe it'll become my new main or bring a perk that completely changes the meta of the game.
---
We were trying to tell you its not what you think it is and trying to educate you as a fellow player no one's mad at you. Cool you got a free hatch good for you.
---
By real, I meant IRL indeed, not real as in "classifiable as a religion". There's literally the birth of God, this could never a question.
---
I also do appreciate talking about SH but there isn't really a discussion to be made here lol, that's a good WOT tho, although I'd format almost all of it as a spoiler.
---
See you in r/silenthill
---
I have a thousand hours and I still only have one survivor with all available perks, no killers with all perks, and a couple p3. Anything to reduce the grind for everyone is just a good thing in every way
---
Yeah haven't played since 12+ months, after 2k hrs and so many disappointments I just did what felt most appropriate, Uninstalle the game and play something that's actually fun.
---
They probably won‚Äôt since they‚Äôre 2 seperate characters
---
wow -101 downvotes.
---
Says the one triggered over a fucking opinion about a character x'D
---
YESH
---
Not really
---
hey bud, use your eyes
---
The mind flayer is probably happy about anyone that can‚Äôt trouble it anymore :D
---
If they did have a Scoops Ahoy costume there's absolutely no way they'd put it in the exclusive bundle, it's costing $10 in the shop 100%
---
You remember the rules!
---
I've never watched Stranger Things, but i am Excited af, finally 2 children as survivors. A new Map and a damn scary looking hag with a flower head
---
looking at ur comment history i‚Äôm guessing ur 13 at the most. and i‚Äôm 16 so ur not far off mate ;)
---
I just wanna know how they are going to fit the lore into It. Like how the entity is controlling it
---
That was incredibly similar to the first time my ex-MIL stayed visited. I had just woken up and hadn't remembered yet until I turned the corner and BAM! there she was. Scared the hell out of me and I spilled my coffee
---
Would work better as a terror radius with the BPM. Would still be dope.
---
I personally love the legion and their playstyle works well for me. Discordance is a great perk for dealing with swf
---
clock mode?
---
They wouldn‚Äôt make a child survivor (Nancy is 18 and Steve probably is too) but I feel ya
---
Apparently a lot of people don‚Äôt because Disney is gonna kill it in the next year or so.
---
People are raised in environments where they are consistently sexual abused. Familiarity and tragity are not mutually exclusive
---
Fair doos! Defo two sets of perks then
---
If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, why now? Freddy, Michael Myers, Leatherface, Ghostface, &amp; The Pig from Saw weren‚Äôt enough before?
---
I think theres something wrong with you
---
Wait you're running Insdious Bubba to farm bloodpoints?  That's literally the worst build in the entire game for bloodpoints.
---
Ah, ye happens alot on low ranks, or when they wait for you to die to get the hatch
---
The Entity pulls the killers/survivors memories to create the different realms(maps). So I think it is possible lore wise for Pyramid Head to be brought in.
---
Not sure it would work. The Xenomorph uses echolocation
---
PTBs are always Tuesdays so it will be on the 27th
---
That‚Äôs a massive question. Do you anticipate playing killer or survivor initially? That might help narrow down some answers. The gameplay is night and day for playing one or the other
---
Imagine having positive karma
---
Isnt hag a monster?
---
*Hag has entered the chat*
---
Its also the season 1 demogorgan so i mean
---
What kind of Mojo videos are u watching
---
I do, in fact, believe that the rest of the killers for this year's roadmap are licensed, as last year's roadmaps were all original. 
---
Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. So we had, Clown, Spirit, Legion and then Plague. Which means Ghostface, Demogorgon and two ?? others. 
---
Then I believe next year's roadmap will either return back to original storytelling or perhaps mixed as our original killers and survivors will be receiving more and more storytelling with the archives.
---
hag is a human
---
What will be wrong with Demogorgon chewing the survivor's face off? They could probably make one or two faceless textures to fit all survivors.
---
Oof guess it‚Äôs just ps4 then
---
Decisive strike is good insurance for shitty teammates, but if someone is gonna tunnel they‚Äôll just keep chasing you
---
I‚Äôm thinking a combo of both, but if I were to choose only one it‚Äôd be survivor
---
You could try acting like an adult for once instead of like an insolent little child. Maybe try being constructive towards yourself and learning from your mistakes instead of repeatedly hitting your head on the wall... but that probably won't happen, which is exactly why you're in the situation you're in right now, being told you're objectively wrong by multiple people while flailing like a small child who didn't get their toy in the supermarket. 
---
Not sure why I'm bothering with you, it's actually much funnier to see you act like this. Good luck in the real world. I have a feeling you don't do too well out there.
---
Idk how. I get 40k+ bloodpoints a game. What is better?
---
No she's just an old woman with no skin cos she got cannibalised on.
---
They fucked that up. In a good way lol.
---
Yeah thats a typo lol
---
Chucky could do that tho so it fits his caricature
---
A decayed, disgusting, almost fleshless one.
---
You gotta buy the cannibal DLC. Level him up to get BBQ and chili on all killers (ends up being double bloodpoints). 
---
Unfortunately playing survivor is not optimal for farming blood points. You're much better off playing killer (with BBQ and chilli), and then dumping those bloodpoints into your survivor. 
---
If you want to be as efficient as possible farming. You want to use the doctor and shock people like crazy. 
---
If you want an efficient EASY way, use cannibal and insidious. Hook 1 person and wait close by. Down the rescuer and hook them. The games go by very fast this way. Either everyone dies or they do gens while you camp. It's toxic and you'll get hate messages but I've managed to farm 10 characters to level 40+ in just over a week having the game.
---
300iQ
---
Thanks i didn't understand it
---
Killer mains be like: *non human noise*
---
Nancy is sooo cute
---
Yes, but why have the likes relative to the views gone up?
---
They probably had one intern whose sole task it was to stop the devs from spilling the beans in one of the speculation threads :D
---
it is still a human and it walks on two legs
---
[best dlcs to get](https://youtu.be/C49wygOeZ5I) 
---
And probably tomorow will be the public beta test build for the stranger things chapter, so tomorow you may wanna check it out...
---
PTB will be the 27th and actual release will be Sept 10th
---
Breaking Bad is my all time favorite show and honestly, Stranger things is definitely top 10 for me, so that‚Äôs close enough
---
So is a demogorgan
---
Yeah but they only added one new map so we're still at a 1 mall deficit /s
---
ok so people have fucking mouths that open wider than their face?
---
General Reposti!
---
Watch a bunch of videos on perk tier lists, most people have a good basis on which perks are really good to run and which ones to basically avoid. There are base survivor/killer perks that are automatically in the bloodweb regardless who you play. After every match after playing as survivor/killer you are awarded BP (varying amounts depend how many objectives you did in game), you can put your blood points into the web for add-ons, items and perks. If you‚Äôre going to play killer, I recommend getting cannibal first and getting BBQ &amp; Chili first, excellent for extra bloodpoint farming, although I hate hag, getting her next to unlock ruin is always nice. Don‚Äôt get too many teachable perks as it‚Äôll make navigating the bloodweb a pain in the ass. All in all have fun with the game
---
Sorry what? I couldn't read past the triggered child writing paragraphs to make them feel more grown up.
---
Now we need a Bald Steve cosmetic just to piss everyone off
---
The ranking puts players players against others of similar levels. Every couple of months ranks get reset but nobody goes back to the base rank of 20, they go back to like 18 or 17. So right now, you‚Äôre almost restricted to playing against other brand new players until you rank up a couple levels, then you‚Äôll find new matches pretty quick.
---
Edited comment to better represent what I'm saying
---
No use on my lil 480p screen but ill take it... fry my display
---
Will it retract? Because if I had to choose between spinning and retracting I'd go for retracting.
---
I'm interested in the demegorgon's power, it should have to do with the upside down which now means every map will have an upside down variant (same world different textures) but I'm excited to find out what it does and if survivors can access it too. A possible ability I can see is the demegorgon can take a survivor to the upside down and use like a secondary "hook" to string them up with tentacles or whatever and take them out of the game for a bit prompting a rescue in the upside-down, obviously death wrapped up would be slower than a hook sacrifice
---
I liked his aura reading capabilities. You lose someone and you can get back on them.
---
Honestly same, I talk crap about the devs but they have been doing pretty good lately.
---
I need hypodermic gloves and a no hat option too.
---
But that‚Äôs still a lot of time wasted, plus if you have head on you can wait until it runs and and stun em.
---
Either that or they realize what you‚Äôre doing, but don‚Äôt have the time to wait and grab you since they still have 3 other survivors to account for so they leave you.
---
Basically new dimension found creature awakens and wants some flesh also some weird girl with ability breaks free from the lab interacts with it(before escape) meets other kids go on wacky adventure and the creature the demogorgon busts out fucks shit up and the dimension he's from his earth but more blackish and edgy.
---
If they were able to get Jason he would have been the killer for Chapter 13.
---
Everytime I have a perk build, I never have a situation where it would help.
---
Now we wait for Jason Voorhees. But knowing what happened to f13 the game I doubt it will ever happen
---
because it seems like a weird thing to get mad about
---
Carl is defending that store in the entity‚Äôs realm don‚Äôt you dare try to drag that man from his store
---
Haha fuck you
---
The demogorgan is humanoid and walks on 2 legs. We aren't having killers that are aliens that full on walk on all 4 legs
---
Hey remember that behavior don't have the license of the scream films, just the mask. That's  why we don't have sidney in the game.
---
The main thing is are you alright with a steep learning curve?
---
If you‚Äôre not, be careful about buying DLC.
---
I‚Äôm just getting back into it because it got too boring on one side, and aggravating on the other.
---
Everyone has their own columns for likes and dislikes, but the main thing is just to be willing to put hours into the game. If you want a game to play while your food cooks, you‚Äôre probably not going to have much fun being either gen rushed, or tunneled, mixed with too much salt for the human body.
---
If you don‚Äôt mind learning the safe and unsafe difference, or how to mindgame someone until they run themselves down, then I think you‚Äôll have fun.
---
I started out with Doctor, then went to Michael and now I‚Äôm trying out Amanda. I enjoy it, so I hope you do too.
---
It won't. They are having a live stream for the Stranger Things chapter on thursday. Would be weird if they had that stream after the PTB. Next tuesday is more likely
---
Some sythwave hell yeah
---
and peoples faces dont open so goddamn wide they can eat an entire chicken in one bite
---
That's how I feel minus the excitement.
---
Derp face was a no brainer too üôÅ
---
FYI the only things you have to pay for is licensed content (Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Stranger Things, etc), because BHVR (the developer) had to pay to get those licenses, it wasn't just development time.
---
All original content can be unlocked organically
---
Have they said anything about when the dedicated servers will come?
---
üñêüèºüñêüèºüñêüèº
---
Carl the cashier killer when?
---
&gt;zenomorph
---
Ahhh now that makes sense
---
When I say "humanoid" I mean the structure of it is similar to a human
---
I thought it was gonna hint at the demogorgan not actually being the killer but more of a roaming teammate type thing while the killer would be the person watching
---
i said the same thing in my comment history !! the upside down theme ( the one showed in the ending of s3 ) should be his terror radius or something
---
I just find him boring to play against. Get hit with frenzy, he leaves to find someone else, mend, repeat.
---
Keep your purple Shadow Dance add-ons ready.
---
Yea I was at rank7 then stopped playing for a long while
---
Nah Bill was way after Michael. Bill came out in 2017 while Michael came out in 2016
---
Demi-oregan

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/csonof/would_it_bug_anyone_if_the_mian_cast_got_in/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
You don't need to be good with a M&amp;K for this game IMO, although I'm curious if others would agree
---
Do you think the they will have the upside down similar to Freddie's dream state?
---
That what I'm hoping for since we didn't get a survivor with ghostface so in theory they could have 3 perks 'saved up'
---
I havent been able to stop thinking about this since the announcement lol
---
As someone who didn't think demogorgon would ever happen, I'm happy.
---
You said bone left on map but you mistyped I'm assuming you meant none. Lol
---
Sort by Q&amp;A 
---
Thank me later
---
i've been been in that position when survoirs be toxic even tho there uter boloxs
---
There‚Äôs no reason to be mad. More content than usual as well as a huge opportunity for BHVR to grow even further with a collab this big
---
Honestly there's absolutely nothing you can do as you can't stop them from unhooking you. The only things that can help you is decisive strike, dead hard, sometimes adrenaline, and pretty good looping
---
I think this is de sync, not hit reg or lag switch. Used to be a huge problem on rancid abbitoir
---
This is soooo hype
---
I'd be down for a werewolf killer or a killer based off of The Thing
---
Pretty much this.  It's how "Pyramid head" copies exist. They are manifestations of strong emotions / trauma that either help the person deal with it or they die trying. 
---
* The original Pyramid head is a manifestation of Jame's guilt, sexual desire, and wanting to be punished for what he has done. It's shape was given to it by a picture James saw.
---
* The Butcher represents Travis' anger issues. As well if you interpret photos you find in a motel in the game, how he takes out his anger by killing people. If I remember right Travis also visited a butcher's shop often when younger so that explains this creature's shape.
---
* The Bogeyman(v1) is a manifestation of Alex's anger towards his dad. Given shape from stories the parents told about him coming to get children to hide the disappearing children. The parents used the same reference that the creature of the picture james used. (the sect of executioners). 
---
   * This version also has a duel purpose. The town sent four demons to kill the head of each family.  PH here is Adam's monster.
---
* The Bogeyman(v2) is a manifestation of Revenge that Murphy and Anne wanted. I forgot exactly how he took shape. 
---
If they do get to use Pyramid head, I can't see him being a solo killer. He pretty much represents a thing of a person and thus would need a survivor to be attached.
---
Add another one: this is the first time Behaviour gets their hands on a legit massive, popular and most importantly RECENT IP. Everyone and their moms know Stranger Things. We had massive icons before with the various oldschool movie icons though none of them are overly relevant to our current pop cultural topics and we even had a "recent" IP with Old Ash being a tribute to the show (which was quite good, but super niche in terms of fanbase). None of them were big, popular as fuck and recent all at once.
---
DbD is now sorta officially "Stranger Things: The Game" for a decent chunk of the public. Means who knows what other big IPs will think about being represented in DbD now.
---
Legion is great for BP because he is an absolute beast at hunting, brutality and deviousness without even getting a kill. You rack it up like it‚Äôs going out of style. Even the worst games I still get 15k.
---
I thought the other characters looked butchered because bhvr didn‚Äòt have the rights for their likeness. Maybe they have them this time
---
Not really, you basically reuse camera code. The problem is rendering from multiple cameras at once can be a  little intensive (Switch and Console users may have some problems)
---
Oh geez I can't earn Bloodpoints fast enough for all these killers and new survivor perks. I'm hyped, but I wish that buying the characters also came with a "starter pack" of Bloodpoints to get them going. (Note: Not selling Bloodpoints separately, but when you buy Demogorgon like normal, he comes with like 300k BP automatically.) There's soooo much grinding you have to do now that you barely have a killer ready to play for real and the next one is coming out.
---
I have never used m&amp;k before this game. It's kinda difficult to learn coming from a controller but you could always use your controller. I would definitely go PC version. The game runs so much smoother.
---
Literally everyone is gonna main Steve. I feel left out as I haven't watched alot of stranger thins
---
Hes like Jaime from Game of Thrones, but with the bonus that he hasnt had his arc annihilated by shitty writing
---
Hag is s for me
---
Disagree completely. You're going to have a much better time overall with mouse and keyboard, especially when playing killers like Huntress and Nurse.
---
Which is so silly, because it's already a lot like characters that exist in game, it's clearly not outside the realm of possibilities.
---
Well at high rank it makes sense since a good team of optimal survivors is impossible to beat unless you're nurse or spirit
---
To add on to this, Nancy is one of the kids' sister and Steve Harrington is her boyfriend in Season 1, they're both great characters!!! The Demogorgon hails from a dimension that comes to be known as 'The Upside Down' which is sometimes linked to our world through portals and other ways, and it's basically a cold and horrific empty version of the real world that people can sometimes slip into and have no way of getting out of. Heck, it's pretty similar to The Entity's Realm in DBD...
---
!remindme 2 days
---
I 100% agree about Plague! Can‚Äôt concur about Legion, as I haven‚Äôt played them yet, but in playing against them numerous times I can see how they would be fun!
---
What loadout would you recommend besides BBQ and survivor pudding
---
Probably just did a match that couldn't fit into the video
---
How?  That flies in the face of every insidious Bubba game I've ever seen with their 12K bp 4k's lol.
---
I hope they have unique TR/chase music and will be a bit disappointed if they don't. IDK why Myers has unique chase music straight from one of the movies but Reboot Freddy, Leatherface, Amanda Young, etc. don't.
---
Hag is basically a wendigo
---
honestly was thinking about getting the game cuz i liked the style and now i really want to because i love stranger things
---
Personally I'd just want the Demogorgon to grab the survivor and dunk him/her in his mouth hole, close the "flowers", munchy crunchy, then throw away the body.
---
RIP
---
They have a mori where you get chainsawed in half, another where the killer rips your liver out and eats it, and another where the killer takes a selfie with you while blood spills out of your mouth. I think itll be fine lol
---
So by that logic we could get shirtless or bikini Clown? Anyways yes we shall get a xenomorph
---
Short story is coma but I‚Äôm super excited about this. So much potential for the killer, and a Stranger Things map sounds sick
---
The demodogs are more stout in appearance
---
That's not entirely the killers fault, no way for them to know they have kindred until end game. Now when they decide to camp with somebody running object, that's a different story.
---
Steve The Hair Harrington
---
We don‚Äôt hate because he‚Äôs op, he isn‚Äôt. He just really annoying to play against
---
?
---
So he would kind of be like old Freddy is what you‚Äôre saying
---
Yea I know this but I just wanted to give a quick summary on the story as he requested but thanks for adding on.
---
YES!
---
Why Steve and not jonathon? I have not watched season  3 yet so maybe he becomes a bad ass finally. But still :(
---
Facts:That's not how licensing works.
---
He does have one, purples are set above the greens and it didn‚Äôt show above green
---
They didn‚Äôt say no non-humans. They said they aren‚Äôt doing non humanoids. That‚Äôs why we have hag, who is a play on the wendigo I‚Äôm fairly sure.
---
I haven't been disappointed by the past chapters. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Ah OK. Just thought it was the thing that Dustin had? OK ow it's the rendition from the end of season 3 but thought they were demodogs
---
I'm betting now. There's going to be one good perk. One alright perk. The rest all situational at best and horrid at worst.
---
That's how it's pretty much always been at the end of the day.
---
With more money coming their way they could overhaul the rigging and add body parts and in turn rework the various Moris to be a little more vicious.
---
Or at the very least just touch up some of the less exciting Moris. It's a damn shame that Trapper doesn't use a bear trap to maul someone for example.
---
The only reason I bought this game is because im an all time saw fan and when I saw they had tapp and amanda young (even though she was a bitch in the movies). I cant speak for everyone who plays this game but if it didn‚Äôt have any of the licensed characters it has today (and a ST chapter is coming out so it will bring a bunch of new players), the amount of players it has now would‚Äôve probably taken years to get
---
I genuinely wish the game was scarier (Jump Scare Mikey is my favorite thing to play against). I had fun with the environmental scares Hide Or Die had. I want more of that heart racing fun

Barbs death was crucial to the series, emphasizing the true danger of the Upside Down and that no one was or is safe. I personally don‚Äôt want her back just to prove the point.
---
Yeah probably, then again I just made this out of excitement, for all we know his perks might suck and only some people will keep playing him after release
---
I understand that the game is more popular now, but seriously it shows very well that its more popular 372k views and 7k likes on Michael Myers. 230k views and 31k likes for stranger things IS way more than "the game is more popular now". Myers wasn't really in a crazy spotlight at all when the chapter came out in my memory. However Stranger Things is a absolute hit on Netflix and is an actually CURRENT thing in process within the past few years. Of course it's the biggest property even if you were to compare averages this is huge.
---
You no your series a joke doesn‚Äôt begin to describe how bad that is
---
Michael Myers in...‚ÄùWhere‚Äôd my shirt go?‚Äù
---
Oh yeah, no doubt about that.
---
Dude Starcourt could be such a fun variation to add at some point though
---
what we learn...
---
I saw this after the trailer so you dumb
---
Stranger things is overrated
---
It is a hybrid though. The trailer shows it walking on four legs and I don't think they'd show that if it wouldn't be part of its ability for example (like dropping on all fours and being speedy as fuck, pouncing on people).
---
And I guess the whole point of "no non-humanoids" was to avoid any weird monsters like dogs, spiders or other harder to animate models.
---
No. Us asking is not going to make the licensers just give the devs the rights.
---
You're too much of a triggered child to read my words? Lol alright, at least you admit it.

Good luck with your online dating btw. Doesn't surprise me you get 0 interest from guys IRL. You seem pretty insufferable. üòÇ

You were right but I'm still not happy about an overrated series being stuffed down my throat in a game I enjoy.
---
Switch
---
What about a duo killer? Piano and Eel?
---
Uhhh... you're excused?
---
Oh he did, He was just standing there me and my friends just did gens and we threw down all the pallets so he would come but no, when the gates opened I went check and there he was still standing there.
---
Why shouldnmt we be hyped. 
---
Two survivors at once, a new monster killer which we never had, an indoor map, not to mention BHVR praobly got a fuck load of money from this since. Maybe you need to leanr how to not be a whiney bitch
---
But on a serious note, his bio says ‚Äúhe has a knack for getting into trouble‚Äù maybe a perk to do some forced tunneling or something tanky? Whatever it is, I think it will be impactful. They‚Äôve doubled down on this crossover to bring new players. The last thing I can see happing from a business decision is to make this a garbage dlc, considering they‚Äôll be selling a metric crap ton of this chapter.
---
You lost me when you said peanits.
---
He's the most useless person on the entire forum and discord channel. He's not a mod, he's not someone you can trust, he's just a memer and deliver in a copy-paste fashion information. That's it
---
They're old friends so maybe they may do something
---
The same way he controls characters like Freddy, the characters do it for fun
---
They broke up season 1! 
---
Shoulda been Steve and hopper. 
---
I really want to play as hopper
---
Don't hate on mama Steve!
---
I don‚Äôt know. I use bbq with it and I get mostly 3-4ks.
---
I think the problem mostly rises from the Demogorgon being beast/animal like in behavior so it has no consciousness or reasoning, so it begs the question of "how does an animal that doesnt think, know how to hook and not just kill the survivors". We'll have to wait until next month but Im wondering when there is gonna be more information about how they work lore wise.
---
I dont get what this post is saying
---
f.
---
tbh I'd buy demogorgan just to log onto the music.
---
Somebody slap that mother fucker!
---
No sleep til scoops!
---
Oh well I mean they could've been taken because during that time they were or because the entity feeds off of emotions they brought them both to see if it would give it a better meal I suppose?
---
"Aesthetics of the game". Similarly to TF2 the devs killed that concept long ago. I'd see no issues with having creatures and/or extraterrestrial. Some might not fit, but overall you could make a creature work. The real reason is because BHVR is a bunch of cheap frogs who can't code and rather just copy-paste animations. If you had a werewolf killer you'd need to redo the rig and animations and maybe even alter some basic gameplay mechanics. Way too much work for 7.99. Honestly I bet BHVR would rather trash DLC altogether and just sell cosmetics until the end of time. Retards will buy it.
---
I'm not. You know I'm right. No self respecting person goes for online dating unless their real life prospects are non-existent. Which yours are. Because you have low-intelligence and act like a child.
---
They can attack in the real world, yes.
---
We are gonna have to see Hag rip their intestines out :(
---
as someone who made the mistake of leveling legion and am not haunted constantly by Iron Maiden on every single bloodweb please yes.
---
A L R I G H T H E L L O
---
So as someone who‚Äôs never seen the show, any theories on what this thing can do?
---
Part of the power will 100% be some ability where the DG drops on all fours and hauls ass across the map. BHVR knows by now that most killers simply need some sort of speed boost or helpful way to get in touch with survivors (Ghostface sneak, Freddie port, Plague vomit, and so on). And they could really flex their dev muscles a bit with a 4 legged run which later could become a 4 legged normal walk if we ever get a Xenomorph (which should absolutely have some ability to crawl up walls or cling to ceilings).
---
No problem
---
Now we gotta get the Predator and Dutch (Arnold)
---
‚ÄúOver here!‚Äù You‚Äôre maybe not the smartest, but it seems like a good idea to do this, right? Mess up the killers PoV or camera angle by x/y/z when you‚Äôre in range x/y/z for x/y/z seconds. Expose yourself for x/y/z seconds.
---
‚ÄúAgain? Seriously?‚Äù
---
One time i had a thought for a killer that was entirely human and people said that a similar character that was not human would be a better candidate.
---
Honestly can't blame them.
---
Then hopper and Joyce would have been MILES better! 
---
I think they just went with the pretty ones!
---
If I were a bad demo man I wouldn‚Äôt be sitting here discussing it with you now would I
---
Im glad y'all got stranger things and all but I've never seen nor plan on seeing an episode so its a little underwhelming for me
---
YES!!! I can totally see this being a thing.
---
No demodogs were wayyy smaller and crawled on fours only. This guy literally stood up on his two hind legs and is super tall
---
God you sound like someone  that didn't get enough sleep. I'm saying we shouldn't heighten our exceptions because of hype to be let down completely because it would make the dlc feel worsen or so. We should come into it with no ultra hype and high expectations just our raw emotions to enjoy it fully
---
T-1000 killer power: just fucking liquid metal walk through pallets.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/csp00p/the_manbearpig_is_now_a_killer_what_is_his_power/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
If they‚Äôre still vaguely humanoid shaped
---
I think his walk is actually kinda intimidating lol
---
My guess would be the 21. of September. They mentioned in their AmA about their dedicated servers, that the 21. is when the summer ends, and that might be a good time to release the chapter, and maybe the servers too.
---
If that was the case they woulda done the same when bubba came out
---
Everyone wants Xeno and Ripley.
---
I just want Predator and Arnie.
---
Oh yeah lol I ment "none"
---
While I do need to agree with you because that's the official explanation, I'd prefer to side against the copying of PH without more radical changes in other SH games. That specific Red Triangle Thing design was meant for James.
---
It's very easy to make this work,  though. We just need James as a Survivor.
---
does it say "stack"?
---
As a Killer main... I too hope Steve gets brightly colored cosmetics which acts as a beacon on the map!
---
I think they had the rights to the killers likenesses and the names but when it came to their looks they might not have since the appeal was for the killers. Kinda hurt in the long run as Quentin looks like he's a 40 year old man and not a teenager like how he should be unless when you're in the entities domain you age 20+ years lol
---
Why should people do what you want them to do? You dont have to be hyped, but let others do.
---
They probably don‚Äôt want minors hanging on meat hooks
---
Yeah lol o realised afterwards that for some reason all the t‚Äôs are a weird version
---
Hate to break it to you but plenty of people who respect themselves use it because it's faster and easier to meet people who you actually want to and you generalising and assuming things like that in a desperation to continue the arguing with something irrelevant just says everything about your mentality. Lol.
---
Freddy unless I‚Äôm mistaken is not there for that. He‚Äôs there to torture Quentin but I see what you mean
---
then why did it never happen?
---
Bruh you forgot demogorgon jpeg smh my head
---
I mean idk Steve seems pretty damn cool especially his hair looks nice as well but yea I would've preferred Hopper and for the other one I haven't watched the show all the way(S1 felt too slow compared to what I wanted I'm very easily distracted) but I'm assuming daughter?
---
I'm looking at the 2 minute mark right now and it shows all his items from pink to yellow.
---
They just made a chapter with 2 survivors, who's to say they wouldnt make a chapter with 2 killers?
---
~~(also ignore what villanoinker said)~~
---
If it does I hope it can‚Äôt attack or anything since that would be
---
Glad you liked it!
---
Nancy could have something like...
---
‚ÄúBooby Trap‚Äù: You are smart when under pressure. After being in a chase for x/y/z, the next pallet/window you fast vault will be marked. When the killer interacts with a marked object, their aura reading abilities are hindered for x/y/z seconds and give you a notification of the object that was interacted with.
---
‚ÄúWait, did you hear that?‚Äù
---
So it would stack like BBQ? Sounds pretty good
---
Yoooo, that idea would be SO nice for a potential Xenomorph. Instead of hooking somebody you just plaster him onto a goopy wall and instead of the big spike coming down it'd be a Facehugger slowly trying to latch onto the survivor. Ahhhhh
---
Sorry, Dwight.
---
#sad moment
---
Also facts: Mentioning anything about a Xenomorph will get both companies‚Äô attention if we try hard enough.
---
Who says it has to be hooks. They could give him a power that make him put survivors in the parasitic goop that impregnates the victims with chest busters. As seen in the deleted scenes of alien 1
---
Chucky is technically human, or at least he started out as human.
---
I feel like some of those soft core erotica SFM dbd stuff often look better than the in game rendering.
---
I'm giving a suggestion not a command. I WANT them to experience it fully but they don't have to as it's up to them and they should do what they want but I think it'd be best too experience it with just raw emotions
---
If you go even farther back there was no survivor with Bubba.
---
Eleven is his adopted daughter, yeah. She'd be too overpowered for a survivor though. 
---
I LOVE Steve. A Steve and hopper would have been my wish, but that's purely as a  fan of the show.
---
You don't have to buy the dlc
---
Ding ding ding
---
what is dead by daylight? the one where you hide from ghosts?
---
Hopefully the denu whatever is not garbage at launch
---
Also vanity sounds really good because 15% is a lot
---
5 meters is really small for a radius effect, maybe if it applied after they leave the 5m radius for a few seconds like streetwise or vigil
---
And fan base seems super situational
---
Also which applies first ,so vain or lithe?
---
This is so messed up. 
---
1. Wraith is the single worst killer in the game. He has no abilities that helps him in chases. Pig should be higher up as her dash ability can easily end chases
---
2. Freddy is nowhere near the top tier of killers. 
---
3. B tier should not be that big. Some killers there should not be there
---
Wraith higher than pig? YIKES
---
300 or so, it's between 3 and 400 but I can't see my playtime exactly as I'm on PS4. Every time double BP has come around I've no lifed it, and with the anniversary event I got more cakes than I can count, I grind up to a million and then dunk it all on one character
---
Well it's mainly just learning when to use it the bottle also the distance, it's hard to explain also don't spam bottles as that's just a waste forcing you to refill and if you hook someone throw a bottle at them because it gives a notification for if someone saves, if you are getting looped in a building or outside throw a bottle at a tree or shack roof to watch all of the shack be covered in the toxin.
---
Let me guess cropping out the made with memeatic
---
I'm surprised with the choice of  survivors, as Steve and Nancy are both still alive and active in the show. I'm wondering what their backstory will be for being there?
---
Twitch clips on mobile is so horrible
---
I *really* want a Hellraiser chapter. Its my favorite horror franchise after Nightmare on Elm Street
---
Freddy and Huntress are definitely about Freddy, who should be B. Trapper and Plague should be in B as well.
---
Pretty solid. I'd personally move hag a spirit up a bit more. Definitely ahead of huntress.
---
I mean the entire show is pretty much a gigantic nostalgia trip, no wonder you have the "I feel like I've seen that before" symptom, haha.
---
I like this idea. I will accept this as the new lore
---
Buying DbD because it has Freddy or Myers, seriously? The game is still the game and despite some rather insignificant details like musical theme or a movie-themed map it stays very different in it's core. To me licensed Killers are more of sign that developers cannot produce unique content, so they have to recycle old ideas made by other people.
---
You havent seen a good spirit I suppose.
---
I genuinely hope that the ptb comes out tmr. Since the chapter has already been revealed and tomorrow is Tuesday it makes sense.
---
And your source of them saying that they‚Äôd never add anything that isn‚Äôt humanoid is...?
---
I've got my survivors set as builds, no repeat builds either, based on one perk from that survivor. Keeps my playstyle from being stale
---
nobody asked you to be here
---
What? No. High rank is 20, low rank is 1.
---
But I get what you mean.
---
They also said we would never get a Clown. Don't take BHVR's words to the heart. I am glad with both characters tho.
---
Check the forums, they post news and stuff there
---
awe let them have their fun lol you dont need to click on their posts
---
I just finished p3 all perks on Quentin and now I want to main Steve bhvr pls triple bp week
---
B feel more like a C+
---
big yikes
---
should be SS
---
How do you deal with killers running op builds? I'm a console player and fairly new but I find myself going down more than others because I just can't seem to get away no matter how hard I try. For context I currently main meg and I run her with adrenaline, sprint burst, quick and quiet, and I've been playing back and forth with boil over, resilience, slippery meat, and a couple other basic perks. Unfortunately I am too new to have many teachables as my meg is the only one passed 30. 
---
I've done everything from loops to really basic 360s and still end up being the first sacrifice. What can i do differently?
---
Clown somewhat fits in. Don‚Äôt expect an alien semi god to be the next killer
---
Standing still as wraith makes him completely invisible.
---
I just felt they could make it so that the upside down made her appear dead, but really she was taken by the entity. Or something like that.
---
What about Beast of Prey?
---
Demo Gordon
---
In that case insta heals don't need a change either cause they're fun to use as survivor.
---
I do like this it makes Morris take some amount of skill to use although I say boost it so it gives maybe 200 percent or lower it from pink to maybe green
---
Well I've played this game for years, not months. I don't no life every event and I don't play killer as often as survivor. Even playing as killer gives you about 3 times as many BP just at base. So I'm not really "not optimizing", you're the one doing everything they can to get BP. I'm just playing the game
---
Welp then its coming next week the ptb, cool.
---
That‚Äôs a good point, never occurred to me. I take it back, you were right all along
---
Chapter 13 shouldve been jason...smh smh
---
oh ow owchy the audio
---
Well I mean assuming the killer is halfway decent you‚Äôre gonna end up on the hook after 90% of your chases. It‚Äôs not about avoiding the hook, it‚Äôs about how much time you can waste before it happens.
---
Oooh yes! I really wanna see a new killer based off this
---
no, that wasn't what I meant, and sorry for not answering, I was on holidays. I meant that legion themselves need to be looked at, and their addons need a complete rework, cuz they literally just change numbers, and so little it almost doesnt matter, except the ultra rares.
---
Nah. The game is shit. No two ways about it champ.
---
Demogorgonzola
---
The Xenobite has 2 arms and 2 legs, so im cool with that
---
I hope the original characters get free stranger things related cosmetic items, like the L4D ones they released.
---
In that time two gens could pop so not so smart killers do that
---
They're definitely putting it in as a paid cosmetic. The two extra clothing pieces mentioned are probably just for buying it through steam or whatever - like Ash's extra blue hand thingy he gets.
---
Thats a good idea actually, honestly Its more a proof of concept thing, I think mori's need a change anyway so anything that gets people talking is good
---
That‚Äôs not the one I was referring to, but to each to their own.
---
LMAO WTF XD I should prob delete mine then lol
---
Can someone explain the relationship between Object of Obession and Sole Survivor?  How much does SS actually help with OoO?  Is this combo still a viable solution?   Tips/tricks?  Anything would be helpful!
---
true, Russians are literally too angry to die
---
Basement Wraith that‚Äôs a new one
---
Chances are they may have gone above and beyond with that killer and they worked out some filter/code to layer over any existing map to make it Upside Downish and the entire match against Demogorgon would take place in two worlds at the same time. DG can't interact and crawl into the real world, but it drags people into the Upside Down and survivors need to come down into a hazardous Upside Down to save their friends. 
---
Cuz that killer is BIG. That's a massively popular IP that BHVR managed to secure. They might wanna polish the everliving shit out of it and make the DG as flavorful as possible We should also keep in mind how many new players we will see. They need to make the DG flashy by itself given how new players don't get excited over a killer just because of the new ability or the new perks that open some more strategic elements. They come for the Demogorgon. They may stay for other killers and the game itself.
---
I really hope one of Steve's perks has something to do with the whole "Motherly Steve" thing. Basically I hope we are getting season 2 and 3 Steve. Not dickhead season 1 steve.
---
Thats ur opinion, not hes, and i play this game for a lot of hours and i agree with him most pf the time lol
---
Seems more like a you problem really
---
It triggers when missing a skill check.
---
Thought about stacking outcasted effects but there might be a time limit for each effect.
---
3 in a row. It would fill up to half of the skill check safe area. 
---
Probably within the terror radius. 
---
More than one totem would be active near generators. It could be a risk if they are running haunted grounds as well.

Can't wait for a chapter with 2 killers
---
Idk why you‚Äôre getting downvoted I totally agree
---
How is it a bannable offense? He‚Äôs not blocking any survivors and you can repair gens even with ruin up.
---
He‚Äôs slowing down the game and not getting any sacrifice or chase points, but not taking it hostage.
---
Yeah I get you, I didn't to be rude or attack you I'm sorry if it came off that way
---
"We"
---
Yeah, and people don‚Äôt like it. I‚Äôm not saying it doesn‚Äôt happen, just that it should be avoided wherever possible and adding a power with a perk built in gets a lot of (deserved?) backlash
---
Demogorgon is a monster tes but a humanoid one so its fine to add it into the game
---
Yup, plus they'll very slowly get bp. It will take them a fuck ton of times.
---
You really want to use your bottles to make survivors avoid a certain area. Think of it as herding animals and get them to go a way that‚Äôs more advantageous to you
---
Im willing to spend my entire salary for that demigorgon
---
Gotta say, it needs a little more backstory. "A guy or woman" doesnt really fit seeing as all killers have they're full name. also Predator Vision would probably end up being a bad perk seeing as everything brightness related has been removed because it wasnt very good
---
I mean it kind of depends which season this Steve is from really
---
You play on PS4. If you do add me Onedart-1kill. I'll teach you the ways and get you to higher rank before the strangers things 4 year olds join
---
That could work or if they trigger something like messing up a gen. My idea for outcast was the obsession would bring the team down if the survivors stayed near them. 
---
I guess if you run into the killer directly so vain would active first.
---
Will the stranger things chapter be included in the switch edition? The switch edition is on my horizon. 
---
Sorry for the dumb question, I'm late to the whole news of DBD for the switch.
---
It would have been a shame if you wasted those 30 seconds.
---
Just be grateful for what your given. Besides, licensed chapters are a good thing because it brings in more audience and players.
---
How‚Äôs that possible?
---
I've never seen the '09 remake, but that's the Jason who's more into trapping and setting up kills right?  See, when I think Jason my mind defaults to the superzombie that kicks boomboxes in Manhattan.  
---
The humanized Jason could be cool, but how do you differentiate him from Trapper?
---
It's a joke, grow up
---
Are you actually trying to save Cthulhu?
---
The survivor will survive longer regardless if they have DS. The difference is, if you know they have DS and leave them slugged you keep momentum and you can hook them later after you down them again. If you eat a DS and nobody else is hooked you lose all momentum and risk losing the game.
---
UNDERRATED idea
---
Personally I wish the first alien Killer would be Xenomorph.
---
Or ALF.
---
And you know this... how?
---
I didn‚Äôt even think of that. Thinking about it all of tapps perks could be passed off as hoppers if tapp wasn‚Äôt it the game considering how well they play into hoppers character.
---
Excuse me
---
&gt;What's a ptb I dont understand, are they gonna take bp away?
---
PTB stands for Public Test Beta. A separate version of DBD where PC players get to test all the new content before it goes live. The goal is to help the devs find bugs and also adjust some balance related stuff before actual release. In the end is more like a huge showcase of upcoming content and the testing part ends up being a little neglected. It still helps the dev because they can collect data and whatnot. 
---
They aren't taking BP away from your main account, they just copy everything you have at the moment of the transfer so you can use it on PTB, which means if you want to have BP to spend straight away on PTB, you must have it stored on your account beforehand.
---
So it's pretty much just for fun? Also is it on console?
---
Yeah, theres this cute demogorgon thing that is not scary at all and likes  to cuddle with the main characters while they crack jokes on living room sofa. *laugh track*
---
Freddy is literally a demon, Is that good enough?
---
LOL I attempted to escape every single time too.
---
Omg I can't be the only one who remembers them saying this. I hate how there taking back there literal lore and word on the game so they can make a quick buck on a rather bland Netflix show. I personally already hate this chapter for that reason alone
---
It's mainly for testing purposes. See what perks may need some tinkering, finding bugs, ect. Also no, PTB is only on Steam version.
---
Please PLEASE let the Demogorgan walk around on all fours. Bipedal/humanoid is so boring.
---
This is exactly why these crossovers work so well. Both franchises grow from them (DBD more so, but still).
---
It‚Äôs for testing shit and no console does not get it
---
Because they literally said it prior to ghostface?

It's an inter-dimensional being, so my guess would be a kind of teleport or something to that effect.

Oooh they are about to enter world of pain...

I'm just saying the right Hag is 10x better than a Doc.
---
And that‚Äôs the story of how I became a survivor main
---
I don't know shit about Stranger Things.  What does this Demogorgon monstrosity do/what is likely to be his power?
---
Ur an idiot
---
Sept. 11, possibly earlier, unlikely to be later.
---
It would most certainly upset me as a killer for a second, but it is a rad idea. I feel that giving survivors more active options can only make the game more fun.
---
welcome to rank reset where low rank survivors straight up bully new killers
---
Wholesome &lt;3
---
I feel like all games made solely about one licensed IP are doomed to fail, especially when they are strictly online for the most part. I don‚Äôt think Chucky is popular enough to get a big budget game but I absolutely think he deserves to be in the gaming world somehow. He doesn‚Äôt fit but I do think DBD should at least do an homage of sorts like Hillbilly is to Leatherface. I‚Äôm surprised we haven‚Äôt gotten a character based on the killer doll horror trope yet.
---
Totally agree with you. His transition was done in such a smooth way. He's one of my favorites
---
I'm assuming that it'll be about $12.00 US, as regular chapters are about $8.00.
---
Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. They could always try to take a lot of inspiration from the earlier movies maybe? I'm not sure what would be considered lawsuit-worthy
---
Didn't they announce Plagues PTB during the stream for the following Tuesday? I can't remember now.
---
that would be amazing.. if only konami had any interest in doing anything good with silent hill

Lmao, sTanDiNg sTiLL iS a BAnNaBLE oFFenSe

True but I stand by what I said. Being a rank 1 killer who doesn't ever play nurse is stressful sometimes
---
also feels good leaving the lobby when I watch them load in with their fucking toolboxes to make them have to find another game
---
all characters get their teachables at 30,35, and 40 respectively. If you dont have it, that means you missed it, and will have to wait until it randomly appears again.
---
What is this no monsters rule? Had BHVR previously stated this awhile back or something..?
---
Yeah, I do like how they gave us one of the more sought after killers (Ghostface).  I'm hoping they can one day get through all that copyright minefield concerning the Scream franchise and give us the true Ghostface shroud costume and Sidney as survivor.
---
We need some "No-Hook" Killers. I.E. instead of hooking you, there's some other objective they have to do which progresses you towards actual death. I remember reading an idea where the Xeno would take you to some facehugger eggs which implant you and after a certain length of time or criteria is met you get chestbursted and die.
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre despicable.‚Äù
---
What rank because insidious bubba is a meme it's so bad against even decent survivors.  This a rank 15 type situation?
---
Demogorilla
---
It really is kind of a fruitless endeavor. We'll know for a fact what the perks are in a week or so, no point in wildly speculating.
---
Especially since people have now reached the state where they are just piggybacking off of each other's ideas and it's a giant uncreative mess.
---
It's fine to be excited, but I'm not looking forward to another week of "WOULDN'T IT BE KEWL IF THE DEMIGERGAN'S MORI WAS TO EAT YOU?!"
---
That's what I'm afraid of- I've literally got like 8.17 in my account right now so I'm just crossing my fingers I won't have to go out and hunt down a $15 prepaid card
---
Add quick and quiet to the build to really fuck with them
---
I adore you XD
---
Because people are not fond of mending and healing 12 times in one match.
---
While it's likely to be a hook, I do recall in the past that they had coding for separate hooks for certain killers, so I wouldn't be surprised to see all hooks replaced with some exclusive Demogorgon mechanic. Some sort of slimy mucus/entity combination would be cool to see.
---
What was their specific reason?
---
The mechanics of the game doesnt allow it, kinda. It would make the game kinda ridiculous tbh and funny.
---
Who are you talking about?
---
I personally think taunts would be fun at first but will become obnoxious after a while. T bagging at the end of rounds is already super common among survivors and some specific killers that can crouch adding in taunts for either survivors or killers would lead to some infuriating situations. Imagine getting gen rushed and all the survivors were taunting and t bagging at the exit gate or being the last downed survivor while the killer taunts over and over. While taunts are a novel concept I just don't think they would be good for the game.
---
It should've appeared by now, click on the character info tab to make sure you didn't buy it absentmindedly. Otherwise try restarting your game and report the bug on the forums
---
Imagine a good bill
---
Today i shall ruin my run w bobs brain
---
Someone said Silent Hill Dlc another said they broke their own rules. Stuff like that.
---
So like Recall on tracer?
---
and that's why you just dip or 99 the gate
---
That sounds awesome tbh
---
Jesus it was hardly a transphobic statement. Stop being so sensitive. It's a fucking meme from a while back.
---
It could easily be argued as multiverse theory. Simply grab them from a world that isn't show canon, and there ya go.
---
It's just a prank, bro
---
Have you unlocked the other two teachables? Teachables will appear in every bloodweb until you spend the BP to get them. You might have also bought the Self Care teachable from the Shrine. Check the Survivor bio page to make sure you don‚Äôt already have it.
---
Rank 11-10 but I rarely pop from these matches
---
Try playing Alien the game and see how stupid a xenomorph would be. They are so insanely fast that the idea of watching one slowly walk round the map is laughable to me
---
That's not how they work. The orange version when you unlock it stays there until you unlock the thing.
---
Yeah, finding lobbies as a survivor is the worst, main reason I play killer
---
That's on a Sunday so I highly doubt it.
---
That last part is false. Teachable perks will appear in the bloodweb until they are purchased. If you don‚Äôt buy the first two, then the third will not appear.
---
seems a generic russian big guy with a gun may be able to, I mean I could be entirely wrong, but ya never know right?
---
Bring balanced landing.
---
now we just need a generic big russian killer dlc.
---
I kinda hope we stick with killers that are mostly humanoid, but if we got a more monster-ey killer I wouldn't be disappointed
---
Welcome to the end of Left 4 Dead 1.
---
I hear this in my head every time I play with a Bill main.
---
Every killer and survivor has these high poly sculpts on the wiki, the ingame meshes will be lower poly.
---
It‚Äôs a fairly poorly made and balanced (over half of the roster are unplayable at high ranks 1v1) game, even though it‚Äôs very fun with its flaws. There‚Äôs a lot of times where things just don‚Äôt work like tracking , dodges, guardbreaks or parrys , a thing called hyper armour (can continue attacking even if you get hit mid move) means that some people trade with you for more damage even if you get the hit in first which is annoying and very noob friendly, its a fast paced fighting game and yet the console versions run at only 30fps, matchmaking is awful and will rarely balance teams successfully, people with bad internet get a lot of lag compensation and so you can kill people and then it will reverse back and they‚Äôll be back alive and often get hits off on you aswell as meaning it‚Äôs harder to parry them. The game features a match rating system at the end to rate how much fun you had, the devs don‚Äôt use this data anymore but they left the rating system in purely because of the spaghetti coding meaning the game completely breaks if they remove it.
---
But yeah, even with it‚Äôs flaws it is a fun game.
---
What would Nancy‚Äôs mori be tho
---
Oh wow you have all the perks wow so cool /s
---
Yeah, I kinda jotted this down quickly as mostly a concept for a killer itself, not a actual written character XD
---
that's actually an awesome concept.
---
I would also like to know
---
It‚Äôs all good. It just opens a floodgate. What‚Äôs next? 
---
A giant spider? A dinosaur? A unicorn? 
---
The DG is I guess borderline humanoid.
---
Looks cheap to me. I don‚Äôt watch the show so im not really excited for this as much as its fans, still happy for new killer and map though
---
If they were ever to do Pyramid Head, they better connect him with James and make it the SH2 version. Any other version from the later games or from the movies completely destroys the whole point of the character, also just having that close of a connection between another killer and survivor would be cool. As far as a new map, I'm thinking another indoor map would be nice, as we do need more of those, the most obvious contender would be Lakeview Hotel as it is the penultimate location James goes to, and just splice it with both the normal and otherworld.
---
Something I think they need to bring is a type of "tanky" killer who hits hard and takes punishment and I think Pyramid Head is the perfect one. With the recent changes to Enduring having someone like Pyramid Head having reduced stun times of any other stun would be interesting, having his attacks do severe damage to where you recover much more slowly(like a much stronger version of Mangled that also affects you while down), maybe even have a multi hitting attack albeit slow to show how much damage his knife can do. Though with the current meta right now he would have to be a decently slow killer and I'm not sure how effective of a killer that makes him with how people generally play nowadays.
---
James would have to have perks centered around his split desires between Maria or Mary. Perhaps it could be a new twist on perks to where they have 2 distinct effects where 1 comes into play depending on what actions are taken to activate said perk.
---
I don't think so, sorry
---
Probably not if they don't be idiots about it and make another shitty perk that gives another health state like Decisive and Mettle did.
---
Or, they could be stationed around the map, and when a survivor walks by they get triggered and the killer gets a basic idea where you are.
---
September 11 is on a Wednesday my dude
---
I hope the in game lore for the demogorgons entrance into the entity makes sense, because I‚Äôm kinda in the same boat. But I hope the devs will be able to pull it off.
---
That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre supposed to do lol. Traps aren‚Äôt meant for killing.
---
September 10 is much more likely.
---
I wish people would loosen a grip on Jason Voorhees and let him be free to be in games
---
Baby Steves and Nancies will be plentiful and we must welcome them with open arms.
---
Is there going to be any official sales or packaged deals for all the DLC's? I play on PS4, and I stay current with everything, but if I was a new player and I saw how much everything cost, well that would be quite an investment to undertake especially if you wanted to get everything all at once. I get that it's up to player choice, and you can earn things for free if you play for long enough, but there are people who would rather buy everything all at once, and that can be really expensive.
---
Lets not speculate too much about the monster's power yet. You are already saying he's weak before he's even out. There's is nothing wrog with everyone beig hyped about it, don't ruin it for others who is excited about it.You must be fun at parties.
---
Maybe I can feel good at the game now!
---
Oh shit. You're right. What the hell calendar was I looking at? Forgive me lord KickAss
---
people.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
...Not a very good one
---
Me when I see ‚ÄúI WANT CHUCKY‚Äù
---
Two Survivors, killer, map, dedicated servers, no more having to reinvite your friends, and mid chapter will bring archives? 
---
Bhvr went above and beyond with this one.
---
Maybe combine both ideas. You have a number of dolls you can place around the map, and they act like traps. If a survivor activates the doll, that survivor and the survivors within a certain radius have their locations revealed and are (maybe) exposed for a certain amount of time
---
Pyramid head is humanoid tho...
---
*-Mori and Iridescent Head Doctor with Distressing-*
---
**YOU 'GON LEARN TODAY**
---
So many things wrong here...
---
Dwight!
---
I never thought they would add the demogorgan because all killers have a humanoid and BHVR said that they would not make a spider killer when someone asked because they said they want to keep all the killers humanoid. I expected the demogorgan to be on all 4s or something
---
Personally I‚Äôve always wanted a creature from the black lagoon/fish man sort of killer
---
Why is freddy above hag and Huntress?
---
All added! Also I can totally feel Canopee to Ghostface. It feels a little spooky with theremin in the back ground. Also ever since scary movie he has had a low key stoner vibe so that makes sense. It also fits the spirit I think.
---
It all makes sense!
---
yeah me too
---
I‚Äôm not sure on that one, sure it has arms and legs l, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a pyramid head or just a pyramid, also its way to bulky.
---
Nah, but hopefully this will be a thing in the future
---
But really guys, What in the hell means a Dee Bee Dee? ? ? ?
---
No I found the item in a chest and left with it.
---
Chapter: Awe man
---
From now on, the Demogorgon shall ONLY be called Bill.
---
never watched it, how good is it?
---
If I pay my fine, will you get your karma back?
---
ME RN LMFAO
---
I wish they would make a maps pack. For every x number of purchases they release an extra map.
---
Nice one.
---
You can hook your train car up to the Friday the Thirteenth train at disappointment junction friend.
---
I want Steve best to shit, it‚Äôs happened in every season, I honestly hope his 03 cosmetic is his face all beat up
---
Scoops ahoy outfit plus exterminator sunglasses
---
He's missing a lot still. There's five pages. He only has four.
---
Hahaahha...im dying...hahah
---
As a Head On user, I think it's worth the trade
---
Yes. It's an indoor map.
---
Thank you very much! This is my favourite pack
