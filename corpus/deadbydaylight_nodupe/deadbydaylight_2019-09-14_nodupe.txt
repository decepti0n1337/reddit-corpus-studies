I like ghostface
---
---
---
Nah but its a very small price to pay. He makes more than people with demanding jobs that require years of education.
---
Best one Yet! I love this one saw some of your previous work They are pretty good too but that Dwight and Clowns faces look a bit funked. Hope you can get better at those cause everything else seems fantastic!
---
It is a thing lol. I recently found out too.
---
As if hitboxes aren’t broken enough, we need a killer with a blade as big as three Janes
---
Yea a lot of perks are like that, great when they work but useless out of certain situations. A lot of those perks could definitely be worth running if they has some secondary effects to make up for their limited use. If they only focused on balancing existing perks and add ons (and some bug fixes) for one chapter it could breath so much life into the game.
---
No, an ex designer came out and talked about how they were allowed to finish anything already in production. Meaning the map, counselor, outfit packs, kill packs, and Jason X which were all close to being done were all allowed to be finished and released. They used it as an excuse to bail on the game because they felt it wasn’t a success and wanted to bail on it to do their Predator game. 
---

---
I’ll link the guys ama he did on r/gamingleaks is I can find it. The guy was very knowledgeable and I had no doubt he was telling the truth. 
---
More fuel to this theory is NECA had the same thing happen to them with their Jason figures but were allowed to finish the ones they already had in production. Same with the mobile game. The only one that said “no it’s different, we can’t do it.” Is illfonic with no explanation why it was different.
---
Why are you trying to depip. That's my question.
---
its a problem because survivors are then able to use that loop again. Im not stupid, i know when to break pallets lol
---
There is a reason Badham had its number of safe pallets reduced as well as future maps like Hawkins have less safe pallets.
---
I hate rank reset ao much sometimes. The people I go against are obviously babies. I feel so bad when I make a high level play and they just stand there not even able to anticipate it.
---
No, that’s children of the corn. You’re thinking of Nightmare on elm street
---
No you're misunderstanding. It's not about the flashlights ability, it's just the clicking. People who rapidly click are mocking the killer, similar to Tbagging.
---
Bruh
---
fgfgfgfgfg213. Weird name I know
---
If you don't break a dropped safe pallet, it's your own problem. And you are definitely stupid if you don't break safe pallets
---
Out of words, really good job lol
---
yeah obviously? dont know why you are telling me this.
---
9 times out of ten it's better to work on a gen for 10-30 seconds depending on distance and other stuff, it doesn't matter how far into Tier one or Two they are, you just have to get there before the next one hits.
---
So going off of your Note lets spin some foil
---
Lad A gets schwacked, you being Lad B are about a quarter of the map away, you decide you are going to run to ***save*** now, you book your little ass over there and feel the quick satisfaction of pulling your goofy mate off the hook, sadly this was also done extremely fast, assuming the killer decided to immediately start walking in the other direction and didn't patrol, or kick something, or check a locker, or do literally anything other than book it in the other direction, you have at most 4 - 8 seconds to gtfo and find a hiding spot. Too long for scratch marks to fully disappear, and generally in an area in which a killer can spot you. All while this was happening, Lad C had also decided to be altruistic and is now in the area as well, arriving a few seconds after you did. The killer has promptly decided that it is time to commit die on Lad B, and as such is booking it to your area with nothing else giving him a distraction as to where survivors might be. 3 survivors are now in the direct path of an angry thing with a massive hate boner.
---
And once again, this time with how I usually do it
---
Unit A gets schwacked, me bing unit B I am about a quarter of the map away, I decided to check some things first. What stage are they on? How much of this gen have I finished? Do I have a toolbox? If they are stage 1, I don't bother immediately, gens are more important, if I have over 75% of the gen done I can generally finish the generator before they get to danger states. If I have a toolbox and the gen is about 50% I can generally finish the gen before the person is in danger. So I continue working, I finish the gen which nets the notification, as well as the progress. The killer now has a rough idea of where survivors are ( both within two areas because of hook and gen pop ) from there I have nothing more important than saving my ally. I start to book it to my teammate and once I arrive Unit C has already unhooked them and started healing, I'm able to arrive about a quarter of the way through the hook and help finish the heal, before using whatever means I have to get out stealthily. Assuming this is a worst-case scenario where it was a ghostface who was just stalking all of us from a distance, we are now still in the direct path of a man with a kill boner, but we had finished an objective, and managed to let the killer get some distance before unhooking and healing, resulting in the unhookee having a full health state ( Yes I know I said GF, but a full healthstate is better than an injured ) and even though it might get spicy from that point, we have a generator finished as well. 
---
Also if y'all are in a group of SWF, this shouldn't be a problem, especially where I mentioned Dingus C showing up because you would have been communicating with each other to prevent the time waste.
---
You have achieved god status and will never be hooked again
---
It is a thing.
---
This is so nice!!!
---
People all just trash in general. Shrug it off.
---
Identity V was made in conjunction with Behavior.  Not a rip off. More of a little cousin.
---
good question
---
Take it easy, I know whatever game you just had was annoying but usually those games are few and far between
---
Idk why this doesnt have 30K likes. But I love this edit. ❤
---
[removed]
---
Ok so which one is the one with The Bees
---
How is Billy and Bubba on top for doing nearly the same thing will the finger fucked is in D tier?
---
Billy or nurse
---
Maybe Whispers instead of Bitter murmer? 
---
I use whispers on my wraith, so I can find someone right off and down them. BBQ will do the rest. That’s how my games go usually.
---
I just did circles on my left analog stick while a Meme face was tryna mori me, it started the animation, but then it showed my doing circles, went on for a good three minutes. He Dced
---
Did you buy BBQ in the Shrine with Iridescent Shards a few weeks back? If you did, you won't have to level Cannibal for it to show in other bloodwebs.
---
Think of it as an improvement in death:time ratio.
---
Personal opinion, but I like the way they flick their weapons, like they're trying to get some chunk of skull/hair/brains off it. It's gruesome
---
Thank you so much! Really I just love the DBD community, and comments like yours make me feel great ♡
---
Billy is one of my favorite killers and enduring is a pretty strong perk with spirit fury
---
Oh well haha. I generally take stuff like that pretty well; I know my work is good, or I wouldn’t be making money off of it. Plus, I could’ve always replied “I know, I was super busy trying to find your 1 inch peen, so I gave up and decided to draw.”
---
I think as a survivor I've gotten 2 comments. Both from other survivors.
---
It was a pretty good competitor and if the devs didn't bail and the lawsuit didn't happen, it would still be one. For a game with no new content, I can still get into games fairly regularly unlike other 4v1 games that came out recently.  
---
It's such a shame what happened.  If only the devs weren't fuckholes and this dumb lawsuit would be over with already.
---
Jakakkio’s GONE Dwight! We have to leave NOW!
---
Hillbilly for enduring.
---
This happened twice to me today. 
---
I really wanted to get a drink, but I was afraid of a skill check. It got to a point where I didn’t get any skill checks, so I thought, let’s have a sip. As I have a sip. Boom, skill check out of nowhere lol.
---
He would have had a pretty good idea if he looked at the lights on the switch
---
&gt; Let me guess: you think insta-heals are fine and insta-blinds were fine right? And that Legion, Bubba and Doctor are fine and not worthless? And that if you have a trap on your head I have to let you go away even if you run into me? Fucking survivor mains. 
---
what the fuck are you talking about? I never said any of this, again here we go with you claiming I said something when I didn't but lets break it down just because I'm bored and you're clearly severely butthurt, assuming things and trying to put words in my mouth so I'll entertain it.
---
&gt; Let me guess: you think insta-heals are fine and insta-blinds were fine right?
---
I don't care about insta-heals just as I don't care about moris. I do however think two health state heals are a little much and insta-blinds were clearly dumb. If you cry about one then the others have to go as well, it would only further imbalance the game if one side had their addons/offerings removed. Also lets keep in mind that brand new parts and healing in general was already nerfed because of killer tears which is now why people run adrenaline. something killers also complain about now.
---
&gt;And that Legion, Bubba and Doctor are fine and not worthless? 
---
Legion needed a nerf but nothing like he is now. Bubba is actually really good and underestimated because people don't run the right the correct build and instead go for the cookie cutter builds they run on every other killer which makes him terrible. Learn how Play With Your Food works and how to utilize it and Bubba instantly becomes an insane killer. Doctor needs adjustments but he's nowhere near as bad as people make him out to be. He shouldn't slow down while shocking, likewise he shouldn't be able to make games 40 minutes long and hold them hostage with his shock build.
---
&gt; And I think it was obvious I didn't say Pig or fucking SPIRIT are bad killers 
---
you implied these killers are bad by saying in your previous reply that since you main them, they're hard to play. like you were some Pig Spirit prodigy or something equally dumb as shit.
---
&gt; if you think winning a game at rank 1 with Pig is as easy as winning a game at rank 1 with Nurse, then I bet you never played even in green ranks as a killer 
---
Obviously you will have a rougher time 4K'ing on pig than Nurse, who said you wouldn't? the reason for this is because Nurse can ignore direct game mechanics other killers (like pig) can't so I don't know why you brought that up or what point you were trying to make.
---
&gt;  I said it's impossible to win against swf if all 4 are Very good/excellent survivors with the brand new parts/insta-heals/keys. 
---
Again, for the millionth time this is false. Killers who have spent time becoming good killers will shut down SWF groups who use all these addons almost flawlessly. Of course you have the occasional survivor who gets hatch, and that's on a 1/35 ratio but outside those instances, good killers will lock down specific generators with a strategy, prioritize which ones need attention, utilize proper perks/builds, track the progress of them, track the timing on what they can and can't do, constantly enforce the 15 second chase rule, rotate pressure and know what they need to do to snowball the game. If that's not something you don't want to learn or educate yourself so you can 4K on any killer, that's perfectly fine - but you don't get to bitch and complain with the ignorant opinion that you can't beat these groups because you were too lazy or didn't want to invest your time to learning how to do just that. Like I said, nothing in life works like that. The greatest basketball players didn't become the greatest because they wanted to watch some dumbass anime on netflix and eat chips instead, the greatest chefs didn't learn to perfectly prepare and cook a meal by refusing to use anything but a fucking microwave their whole life. This is irrefutable logic, if you can't pickup what I'm putting down then I can't help you my man. You want to stay a casual killer, that's fine, but expect to be bullied and lose to people who don't. Simple as that.
---
Thank you 😤
---
I uh- I was making a joke. Intentionally giving a wrong answer and a wrong answer. The “trapper” in mainstream horror movie terms was actually mostly Leatherface from Texas chainsaw. Children of the corn is a movie where children blindly follow their cultish leader and basically live a town of children. Nightmare on elm street is Where Freddy Krueger comes from
---
It’s a chance to run fun meme builds tho at least
---
daylight by dead
---
I think he’s moving his character around with him holding on to the character. When he moves his mouse/controller stick, the character starts moving with it, without holding to any buttons.
---
#*JO-JO*
---
If you are just looking for fun, i really enjoy Ghostface. But if you lookin to level up, pop goes the weasel from clown is pretty good IMO.
---
I know I was trying to continue said joke I just poorly wrote it
---
Agreed
---
&gt;literally the only option for a survivor in chase.
---
A bit dramatic and untrue.  Good survivors can lead killers to different areas of the map.  Looping requires less skill to do, so you see more survivors doing it.  It's definitely easier, I'll give you that.
---
Oh okay- usually these jokes are written where everyone just says “no that’s x, you’re thinking of y” and then you leave it
---
What about my uncle? Did you give him a chance? Did you?
---
How is Hag on A? She just looks at her hand.
---
My personal favorites are Legion, Ghostface, and Pig.
---
I guess DLC, party system and improved Bloodweb will have to do for now. I hope that they will be ready until November at least and not get pushed back even more.
---
Come on now give us a Bloodhunt week as consolation!
---
Doc for monitor and abuse, Nurse for nurses calling and Billy for enduring. In whichever order you prefer.
---
She drips the blood into her mouth, it's a lot more than just looking at it.
---
I have only ever noticed it while it is actively fucking me.
---
I never see it that way. Especially since I'm looking down at the player on the ground.
---
Literally no one is surprised about this. Should have been dedicated servers on release. Y'know, like basically all other games are...
---
Behaviour is already setting up for next year's summer event?

Hag might be good because devour hope can be fun. Especially on nurse if you combine it with thrill.
---
I'm not saying you have to pull them down, but you can use them to fake the killer out and make him wary of getting stunned.
---
This is definitely my favorite so far, I really love their iteration of Ghost Face and I think you did an amazing job representing him here.
---
Frenzy and vault speed are ok I think, extended duration would be nice and change the mend pause to half the terror radius. The pallet breaking and terror radius dummies I like.
---
I was looking for it when I posted that comment. Off work now so ill look more
---
YES! YES! YES! YES!
---
Still happening. Happened to myself and two friends last week.
---
LMFAOO why do you feel the need to post this shit to Reddit. How can you be this annoyed
---
I think I love you. ITS FUCKING AMAZING
---
I'd take pop goes the weasel or maybe monitor and abuse over bitter murmur any day. But youd have to unlock them obviously, worth it tho if you do.
---
If you can go for it then... Play. With. Your. Food. It is bubba's best perk. Many high level survivors can just juke your chainsaw, making your power useless. But with just a small, 5% speed boost you can catch these survivors in places they simply don't expect. If you have 15% then you become a train with no brakes. I recommend otzdarva's video on play with your food (on his second channel, Not Otzdarva)
---
Play runecape.

Are you on Xbox by any chance?

Blood Points are Meta,

Breakdown can help in escaping a camper during endgame.

Wake up is great in EGC but if you need to get to EGC that means you lost so it's not that good in all,

Solidarity can work with Adrenaline and serve as an endgame escape if you're getting tunneled,
---
Mettle Of Man is fun for me but it's very inefficient as one person taking a hit for somebody isn't gonna do much for that other teammate, getting to work is fun imo
---
Buckle Up is an anti-slug perk with a built in Killer Detection tool, it may not be the best perk but it works when it works, and when it works, it's fun.
---
Botany Knowledge is a perk I almost always use but I know it's not helping with anything major unless combined with self care or a med kit
---
Small Game's detection range is too small

Nice to see the emote at the pallet since you owned the fuck out of that baby killer

I hate Self Care and never use it unless I use Botany With it, but I know it conforms with the meta of "only one person not doing gens is better than 2 people not doing gens" I personally feel Self Care is useless but it's one of those perks alot of people utilize.
---
My friend uses deliverance all the time and it usually ends up with him dying cuz he's stuck injured for a while.

I use Botany knowledge all the time, I just know it's not the best perk in the game and counters very minor things.

Spirit for that toxic Rancor
---
Ok, let me just ask you one thing since this is getting nowhere (because you are a survuvor main who thinks everyone only has 1 game to play and should dedicated his life to it even if that person isn't a streamer/youtuber):
---
What would be a reason to normal people put many hours in this game? If PS4 had a hours system like Steam I would have many hours too, but thats because I have the game pratically since it launched in console. There is no reason to get rank 1, you literally get nothing, just stressful games, toxic survivors and hate messages. Every fucking competitive game I know rewards the player with something, it can be fucking useless, but at least it gives something, but DBD? Nope, you just get to rank 1 because why not. And this is a serious question btw. Why would a normal people get to rank 1 and get to levels of a very good killers? And saying "Because that person likes the game" isn't a answer.
---
Ashburn Virginia, which is in the northern part of the state is a tech hub. Many tech companies, including Steam, I believe have east coast servers located in Ashburn.
---
That would be Home Alone with John “The Candyman” Candy.
---
This is my fucking man on GOD
---
Alert is very good for stealth gameplay, but stealth gameplay does not benefit your team so it's not that high on the list. Stealth is only top priority if you're on death hook, I know people like to play stealthily but whenever I get a stealth teammate they end up not doing gens and crouching half the game while everyone dies and then they escape via hatch or exit gate in EGC.
---
You're right, I don't know why I'm arguing about it.  My gf and I have probably been playing too much lately and need a break :P.  Thanks for explaining.
---
I think I chose the wrong add on for Myers. Scratched Mirror is only a pain on maps like Lerys and The Game. My bad.
---
Nothing flew over my head, I was just trying to give you the benefit of the doubt, trying to avoid assuming you were just a self righteous twat trying to play the misunderstood true gamer, but it’s become inherently obvious that you are, as your name states, entitled. 
---
I may not be good by your standards, but conversely, you’re not good by my standards. See how subjective that is? Subjectivity doesn’t make for good support when trying to prove a point, but it’s clear that supporting our statements doesn’t mean much here anyways, once someone as arrogant as you decides they’re right, there’s no changing it. Enjoy being hook fodder propping up the ranks of weak killers because valuing your life is too low skill for an ascended gamer such as yourself, I’ll get back to winning my matches now
---
Enduring or brutal strength
---
Pig is love, Pig is life.
---
When did they say this?
---
I have to edit my post. Scratched mirror isn't what add on I thought. But point was Tombstone once activated isnt fun either.  If they got rid of Prayer beads then I would be ok with that.
---
I don’t know how to link posts, but there a post on this sub from 11 hours ago about it, or you could check the forum directly
---
I feel like they’re gonna end up reworking most killers. Because I just can’t see some killers abilities working in a balanced way if they just do buffs to them
---
I started playing a bit after the last reset, and yesterday I finally was able to touch purple ranks after playing almost everyday for the past two weeks. While I’ve heard people complain, I thought it wouldn’t be nearly as bad considering that even if I had a rank reset down to 15, then I’d be playing with mostly people from green ranks and up as well! So I queued up thinking I should just go about my games as normal. 
---
What a fool I am. A naive fool.
---
See my above reply 🔼
---
#NURSE GUN
---
So lucky to have survived that. Rarely do I ever live egc being the last survivor. Especially when the doors spawn super close. So needs to be adressed
---
Every time this happens to me, and other videos I see here, whoever jumps always ends up near the hatch
---
I’ve always like the way Spirits sword is animated, guess that’s just me tho
---
Prestiging unlocks one piece of apparel each time you do it (up to three times). And cause a higher likelihood of higher quality stuff in bloodwebs
---
Even when you lose. In one game as clown three survivors escaped using a key, and the one who had the gal to send me a message was the only one who died.
---
Good survivors will not start running towards you if you just stand there pretending to phase. Maybe with Prayer Beads on sure and maybe inexperienced survivors will.
---
Survivor didnt run in a straight line when I spotted them? Thats a yikes from me sweaty.
---
That's very specific but I like that you know what you want from life
---
I need to understand what is happening with this guy. Is he an Ochido or a Tru3talent?
---
if u dont loop you cannot rank up after a while, like over rank8 or something, because you don't get pips
---
Ever heard of sportsmanship?
---
Being honorable among your opponent?
---
This isn't a killer trying to kill. Or survivors trying to escape.
---
This is people on opposing sides in a competition. And we should all treat each other fairly
---
I think it needs work.

You used to be able to click the flashlight so much it would cause the killer to disconnect, though I dont think it was possible without an auto clicking software or something along those lines. I used to play with a guy who would do it any time we had a camping killer, which was a lot.
---
Same, I'll run through the building and leave, give me a little bit more in a chase, but not anything that prevents me from being fairly downed.
---
&gt;There's one that temporarily freezes the ability to look around while working on a generator.
---
I want this for Mirror Myers.
---
Why? So he can do jack all too? And not fight? weee so fun bringing in names of people who can actually fight but in game just run around and slide their hands over generators to magically fix them
---
Savage
---
Dude rip
---
Yeah I understand that, I know Franklin's better if they all have random items
---
Because 90% of the time killers win without it. Hell almost every player I've played with is a brain dead moron, and if the killer stood still for 20 minutes they could still 4K.
---
And I'm at rank NINE
---
Then they panic and step in their own trap the way he trips over the chair
---
I personally hate how easy it is to pip as survivor. I just want to play with my new friends and have fun, not bully any killers or anything. But just by playing I get to around rank 10 pretty much by default and then I need to do my best to keep my friends alive who just arent that great at the game. There really should be an unranked queue.
---
You can fix the regrouping thing without dedicated servers tho
---
I cherish every message.

---
Bubba is fun to play, but I'll admit insidious bubba and basement bubba are just no skill toxic playstyles
---
The shrine is random, but I am skeptical about believing that. 
---
For David, I suggest using dead hard, We'll make it, we're gonna live forever, and spine chill. These are all perks that David has or that everyone has. We're gonna live forever is great at getting bloodpoints! 
---
For Jane, you can use her three teachables, and We'll make it. For now since you only have 2 teachables use Poised and her healing perk.
---
Not true, I've escaped a Doc by opening and hiding as he returned. If the gates are far enough apart, it can be done.
---
Yes I agree. Maybe get rid of the add on would be fine. SWF unfortunately is a different beast I don't think will ever get fixed or balanced. The game isn't built for SWF and could never be balanced properly without affecting solo survivors dramatically. Killers would have to be too strong. Hopefully I'm wrong and they have a few ideas for the future.
---
Yo dawg, we heard you like playing Myer so we gave you a Myers offering you can burn so you can play as Myers when you’re playing Myers. 
---
I’m sorry.
---
I like
---
Wow they’re not putting one in central North America like Texas?? Waduhek
---
Things like this make it so hard to be a bubba main :(
---
&gt;It doesn't hurt to politely ask people to do a quick search.
---
I've tried that, people get offended for some reason. I am just having fun, keeping tracks of how many threads we get until the event actually starts.
---
i dont it needs to be that way. if you do not know where hatch is just sit at an exit gate and get ready to open that door as soon as hatch closes.its a big brain iq play
---
1. You and your team failed to complete all the generators, that was your first chance to escape, 
---
2. Moving on to your second chance to escape, you have a race to find the hatch first, you failed to find the hatch first, second chance to escape failed,
---
3. You get yet another attempt to escape by opening the gate, you have chance to open it but a slim chance at that, you failed to escape again, 
---
How many damn second chances do you want the game to give you, you lost get over it.
---
Yeah makes me wonder how my internet will be handling it if I’m in Nebraska and playing with my friends along the west coast.
---
Maybe you’re just bad
---
No ( from a survivor main )
---
First of all I didn't complain about anything, not once. Secondly, I'm not whining either. You commented, I told you why I commented the way I did. Like I said you never had to reply to me. I could say that you're complaining/whining about me and my comments, bit you obviously wouldn't think so.
---
depends the rng my dood
---
Why does everyone always say 'straight line' when someone dislikes looping?
---
Thanks bro
---
Will do. Thanks!
---
Oh yea I forgot to talk stratagey. 
---
The number one tip I can give you is always be doing something beneficial to your team, wether it's doing a gen, getting a save etc. Never just hide in a corner for 10 minutes when the killer isn't near. I suggest the YouTuber/TTV Usslyis for gameplay tips. Demi is great too!
---
What is rng?
---
Yeah if you do The Pig, I’m down for some shit on RedBubble!
---
This was already posted a few days ago.
---
Play the game however you like
---
I love Otz but he looks much better with his longer hair
---
Crispy_Butters add me
---
One time I versed an incredibly toxic streamer whilst playing as clown. He destroyed me, and was super toxic in end chat. A few months later I bumped into him in a survivor game. He got caught in a bear trap. But instead of freeing him, I just kept starting but not finishing the action. Essentially trapping him forever until he eventually DCed. Not gonna lie. It felt pretty good.
---
Thanks. Didn’t see it. I’ll remove
---
I wish they put me with players near me
---
How dare you yield your knife so close to your dog! That's a deadly weapon lol. In all seriousness, it's looking cool.
---
Me when my nose itches while im on a gen lol 😂
---
oh i read this as internet porn
---
Damn I might have to steal that its pretty good lmao
---
I'll admit I know that when you get the good team its hard, and only the best of the best killers can win.
---
But it just sucks when you have these killers try harding at lower ranks and there's nothing you can do because the other 3 dumb assess don't even know what a generator is
---
"Toxic chat" is not bannable. Could you please specify?
---
Thanks man, I have been thinking of these passively over many hours playing and playing against huntress, and I just now decided to put it up somewhere. In my opinion, iri head alone is already way too strong. With the belt it’s complete overkill, but I feel that when every player is playing almost optimally, the game balance is on such thin ice that literally doubling damage of a character’s ranged ability is insane, even for a UR addon.
---
He literally just got reworked and is super weak, why don't you like him?
---
100 points if you kill the dog
---
I sent you a friend request
---
Asthma's quote annoys me. The "Why do I hear heartbeats?" doesn't make sense, the heartbeat the Survivors hear is their own as a result of being in the Terror Radius, not the heartbeat of the Killer. They'd feel it more than they'd hear it.
---
Thanks, I made at school with shit cardboard boxes
---
The reason we probably wont be seeing jason anytime soon isnt because hes supposed to be trapper, its because F13 is caught up in a shitstorm of copyright issues right now
---
This exactly, once Jason found you it was pretty much guaranteed over, even with the fastest/highest stamina characters
---
What is there to specify? Fucked your mom in the mouth, cheating nigger, etc. U ever been popular multiplayer games?
---
Because if you're not a complete idiot you wouldn't have to deal with a safe loop more than once, which was your whole argument?
---
My rule is to not tunnel unless i have no other option
---
They could just release an outfit for the Trapper that turns him into Jason. IDK what other abilities they could give Jason if they added him as a separate killer.
---
same but for the pants i use her newest skins legs, makes it look weird
---
Not gonna lie, only instance I’ve ever seen that Wake Up would’ve been useful.
---
Yeah I think it’s just a console thing, hasn’t happened to me on pc. Sorry this shit happens to y’all on console.
---
I set literally everything to private now because of past experiences, not even just with this game. Completely private profile on steam, etc.
---
Write your own flavor text then nerd
---
These are basically tattoo worthy. Or at the least Stickers for a car.
---
still won't be that good,if you're not doing a gen you should be healing if you're not doing a gen or healing you should be doing totems if you aren't healing doing a gen or doing totems then you should be in a chase. Seeing the killer's aura while he's chasing you is mediocre. Seeing the killer's aura while healing is mediocre seeing the killer's aura while doing gens is useless, seeing the killers aura while doing totems is useless.
---
The acting sucked, but that was more an issue of direction than anything.
---
But that *atmosphere*? They hit the nail on the head: visuals, (droning) music, sound FX... It should have won an award for that.
---
Yeah I never tunnel anyone who is picked up even if they are right in front of me I leave them makes the game unfair and unfun
---
I literally have 0 messages, guess I'm a little bit too "nice" while playing killer.
---
Dedicated servers will fix literally none of the problems you listed.
---
And why is anyone surprised BHVR didnt stick to their date? Remember optimization? They have a track record on not fulfilling their promises.
---
just not my thing, I like detectives hunch for totems much better.
---
Also: Pyramid Head moved *sloooow*.  How would they improvise that?
---
I let people wiggle out if their teammates don’t pick them up fast enough just so they don’t bleed out
---
If someone uses the perk then i would need to deal with safe pallets more than once. How am I the idiot? The whole conversation was about the perk?
---
#FuckKonami
---
Every time.
---
1. Bc people use it as a place to vent about one bad game they had just so they can have someone agree that their game was bad.  A fair amount of players (who post on here) would rather immediately complain on reddit instead of walking away from the game and calming down.
---
(Back in 2017 I acted the same way;I have regrets)
---
2. Also a lot of people making balancing suggestions arent very reasonable about what they’re proposing and people will almost always start arguing over it. 
---
3. People in general are more likely to talk about negative experiences than positive experiences, because they feel more strongly about them, so the majority of what people see is the negative.
---
 (I do see a fair amount of “positive” posts though) 
---
Overall, some people on here take the game too seriously—which is nice, because they are passionate about the game, but..
---
I got 3 no mither swf friends. 2 were chill, last one was less so. Essentially told me to die in postgame.
---
My mood rn
---
If you look it up on google, you'll see why they ditched that name.
---
That Freddy had many opportunities to get you
---
And the Hillbilly is quite like Leatherface. They literally have the same weapons, as he was obviously inspired by Leatherface. Likeness means nothing, where the license does.
---
You know this game launched with like 6 devs right?
---
oTz wEnT wAy tOo hArD Jesus christ shut the fuck up. literally can't say anything without a bunch of pussies getting offended.
---
Especially since it takes two people to perform the action
---
The game tends to spawn survivors fairly far away from the killer—far enough away that It’s rare to hear the killer’s heartbeat within the few seconds of the match. Usually, the game spawns survivors in at a decent distance from the killer, which cause survivors to spawn closer together. So if a killer spawns on one side of the map 3-4 survivors typically spawn on the opposite side (in my experience)
---
👏 Actually 👏 when 👏 the 👏 good 👏 holy 👏 fuck 👏 are 👏 they 👏 going 👏 to 👏 fix 👏 this 👏 shit? 👏
---
If that happened to me and I were to lose it I'd legit cry
---
Honestly, these are ideas for fun ultra rare addons, they’re just ideas I had that I felt would be really fun to use, not necessarily to replace iri head. I had an idea of ultra rare addons being fun and game changing, not just buffs to the base power.
---
I’ve been saving my shards for a couple weeks so I can buy all 4 perks in the shrine the morning the DLC drops and then 4 more when it resets at night (: Still need about 3000 to do so but I should be able to manager by Tuesday night.  I should also have 3 dailies saved up as well so I’ll have close to 2.3 million or so BP saved if you include the shrine reset later in the day.  I’ll be leveling both survivors right away !
---
What a loser
---
My rule is to play the game like a normal person
---
Doesn't the Demo just scream?
---
Yeah dude. Kinda wish that the dweard was checked like legacy is but you gotta take my word I have one ;).
---
Yeah they’re decent ideas, just wanted to insert my 2 cents on the “iri head OP” part lmao
---
always both to level 15, get the trophies, then killer to III,50 then humans to I,0 to get the abilities, then all 4 perks i like for the killer, done
---
I absolutely love this, can't wait the see the others! These are absolutely amazing, well done!
---
You did so complain, and now your comments deleted wow. You literally went on about how you hated people for always complaining and how you didn't ask for opinions even though you're bitching about someone else's
---
Then it will be genuinely bad soon.
---
Lmao, thanks.
---
Speaking of Friday the 13th, did Samination predict that Friday the 13th would line up with Scooby Doo's anniversary?
---
https://youtu.be/nUeI4RnT1KU?t=33
---
I tend not to rehook people when they are being hook farmed by their team but other than that - nothing really.
---
I almost always suicide if there is gens up and we are only 2 survs left.
---
But then where is the struggle in that?
---
Buy Freddy since you can unlock the Spirit via playtime.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers
---
you can just leave the lobby and search for a killer with better connection, its not like the game hides connectivity
---
Honestly... Like I don't spam the key fast enough or I slow it down like 1% I end up killing myself. Holding space would be amazing
---
I'm pretty new to the game but I love playing a survivor even though rarely I win without a helpful killer, basically it's thrilling to escape and I'm trying to learn methods do actually get away from the killer. I find the map and the flashlight useless but my favorite guilty pleasure is destroying hooks
---
They're both worth buying. Spirit has haunted grounds which is a funky little perk. And uhhh from a person who used to main spirit and now mains freddy, spirit can be harder to play than crispy boy. Just buy whatever one you think you will enjoy (spirit is very mind-game focused, freddwerd is idk pretty spicy)
---
My bad I mean to say what :(
---
You do sound like a survivor in the end game chat tho. Tragic.
---
What’s that ?
---
It's always been a bottom tier perk but the new rework will provide some counter play to insidious and no terror radius killers, but only for 5 seconds, so not much in it's usage will change
---
Except it factually is a killer trying to kill, and survivors trying to escape. You don't get to say "it's up to us to make our own rules" when the so called "unsportmanship" behavior is literally added into the game by developers. If it wasn't intended buy the developers, it wouldn't be there, or will be removed shortly if it is. There is no rule book anyone has to follow. You don't need to respect hooks. You don't need to farm with killers. You can play however you want as long as you don't break terms of service.
---
Poor leatherface can't handle not having a crutch :(
---
Steve, can't wait
---
And to add onto that: learn when to stop opening the door before the first light turns on. It is about %15-%20 through that it turns on. If you stop opening it and hide nearby, when the Killer comes by to check he won't know you're there and you should be able to open it by the time they patrol back
---
This one is right. Always buy the licensed killers with real money if you have to choose. You'll eventually get the others with shards, but there is no way to get licensed ones eventually.
---
The mod deleted my comment for one. I don't think you understand what complaining is, and I never bitched about his. I am trying to make you understand that I'm explaining why I made the comment *after* you replied. You won't get that when I keep saying YOU decided to reply I backed up my comment with reasoning. I never initially complained or in fact complained at all. You just said that I did because I was disagreeing with you.
---
So I can use the Leave option every match then?
---
Good to know
---
DS or Rancor?
---
Prestiging is pointless. The only tactical reason to prestige is to re build your characters perks. Dont do it the moment your character hits lvl 50
---
Rancor
---
oh yeah, ill probably get freddy then. Thanks
---
...or you won't, because as much as people keep saying that, me and others have googled it only to find some stuff from the splc and articles talking about solitary confinement/farm animals..
---
Im going to use this as a phone background if thats fine
---
Ima buy freddy then
---
 Clown looks sick as fuck, Billy would be dope
---
oh.
---
Rancor has the falling effects, when using this perk you become obsessed with one survivor. Every time a generator is complete the obsession can see the killers aura. However when a Generator is completed the killer can see the location of all survivors and at the end of the match the obsession becomes an Insta down and can be mori’d on the spot.
---
Yeah, I think your nurse is broken
---
DBD has never and will never have a competitive community, it will never grow a competitive community because it's not a competitive game. I'm not sure why you're even using the word "competitive" and "DBD" in the same sentence.
---
Is ur friend ZombieRampage56?
---
I always try to get people a free win while playing me everyone likes winning so I thought it would be fun :)
---
It already has a largely competitive community, this isn’t news, it’s been like this for quite some time now
---
if you dont know what you want then what do you work towards
---
When did we get a third Virginia?!
---
Got jukes
---
My nurse is 41
---
Ok thanks
---
Maybe as a compromise, since I saw u/MorgCityShadows did a mock-up of Sebastian Castellanos as a Survivor, that in lieu of Pyramid Head and Konami's general asshattery about their IPs that we look for The Evil Within's The Keeper as a similar Killer.  
---
We've yet to have an iconic representative from another horror game and I think the Keeper would resonate with enough people to fill that niche while also being not too challenging to get the rights for.  
---
(for people who aren't aware, the Keeper is the big figure with the safe on his head who is the Pyramid Head analogue in The Evil Within).
---
Already have spirit at 41
---
she even shows off some nipple.
---
I think you need to define your use of the word "competitive" for me.
---
No he used dead hard
---
I got Michael Myers so my favorite thing to do is bang when a generator hopefully people understand what I'm doing then when they all gather round I can stalk them lead them to all the generators, when it's time to exit I'll stab one let them heal each other stabbed another let them heal each other then let them go, if someone is about to fall in the endgame trap I'll pick them up and stand by the exit until they wiggle out
---
I mean, a lot of us just play this game to have fun, and winning/losing is secondary.
---
If you're really determined to win as killer, try levelling the Nurse. Nurse with a couple Hex totems to serve as time-wasting secondary objectives (Ruin, Devour Hope, even Haunted Grounds works nicely) is pretty powerful. If you can mix that with perks that blend well with her ability to cross the map quickly (BBQ, Make Your Choice, the one that makes survivors scream when you down someone) you can be a scary force of nature when facing most survivors, even SWF.
---
This game is pretty hard as most killers, but not all killers are created equal. If you REALLY want to win every match, you have to run the meta killers with the meta perks
---
Is that dudes refit name PuisicsYT?
---
First surv concept that I really really like, good job lol
---
I mean 4 flash lights makes slugging easy.
---
Wait I'm confusion n dumbass, how close do u have to be for the servers?
---
Is redit is yeah he’s my buddy
---
Getting hit trough a pallet after a perfect loop.
---
As killer I rarely land BS hits.
---
Yes but it also has a special effect: You hear the scream across the map. 
---
So every time Demo screams survivors will hear it as a distant ambient sound.
---
No it’s Reddit
---
Ben swolo
---
Players who’s primary reason for playing is to satisfy a games win condition, for the purpose of attaining a higher rank/status/etc, and usually gain satisfaction from the act of winning instead of the gameplay loop itself
---
this glitch is so bad. one time a P3 Tapp risked skin and teeth to save me in Endgame, was such a beautiful champ of a teamplayer, and as he takes a hit so that I can successfully get out, the last thing I see as I’m escaping with him by my side is that it’s not doing the escape running animation for him. he was locked outside the map and died to the Collapse
---
we weren’t even facing The Pig, but I have a feeling she’s getting punished for making another inescapable trap
---
Congrats! Be sure to spend some before each match though so you dont waste any bloodpoints
---
Love the spirits face lmao
---
Sitting on the ground bleeding is imo less fun, since you spend about the same amount of time *and* you don't get as many bloodpoints. I'd suggest hooking instead, personally.
---
I’m so glad someone else saw it this way
---
In the first list of announced servers they actually did have one listed for Seoul. It seems they traded that one out for one in Sydney Australia, which as an Aussie I gotta say I don't feel too bad about lol.
---
Gens can literally be done in 3 minutes lol
---
It was a swf, just lucky I also had a key
---
no
---
I mean he kinda did, he provided resources that op can use for research
---
It sounds like you enjoy the idea of punishing survivors from across the map
---
Killers with high mobility powers (Hillbilly, Nurse, Spirit) are considered the strongest in the game, largely because they do just that. 
---
One of my personal favourites is Freddy, who can not only teleport across the map (to generators) but also has pallet/snare traps which can really slow survivors, especially in chases
---
Ah okay, well carry on then
---
The commissioner requested a half body instead of a full.  In my sketches with legs, they looked more like tree trunks, so I omitted them.
---
I’m planning on getting it as soon as I can!
---
definitely buying it immediately.
---
I try really hard not to farm them I even just chase them without hitting them I let them go after their first down usually
---
My precious traps! Noooooooooooo!
---
Of course not you have to be in the $25 Patreon for that to work
---
Go for it
---
This is badass
---
Finally, A killer that I wouldn't call bs when hit by "sharpened air"
---
 8 years on Reddit wtf
---
I love when they invite you to party just to yell at you and call you a camper. It's not my fault you 3 gen'd yourself. What do you want me to do? Go to the other side of the map and let you do the last gen?
---
Hm beats me then
---
This looks truly amazing
---
Validated 100% your art is incredible.
---
I love playing against skilled killers. I've made sure to let them know when they legit gave me jump scares. Trash talk is a part of any game but these kids need to chill the heck out.
---
My current killer main is actually Ghostface, maybe ima have to take this picture lmao
---
I joined 8 years ago
---
Yes that is a while ago
---
Doesn't Spine Chill also speed up the exit gate opening time?
---
I have been on hook and watched the last 2 guys, clearly SWF, run around working on gens and looking for hatch and leaving me to die. No additional points (and they get negatives as well but they were concerned with making sure the other escapes).
---
That was in Purple ranks. 
---
I hit rank 4 and held it for a whole day so I can lose it today lol
---
Also when the killer gets fed up with lag and toxic behavior that he dc's
---
honestly not sure. ive been playing survivor more recently but the demogorgon seems so interesting to play around with and i really want to add surge to some of my killers so i might go for him first.
---
But then all of a sudden bloodwarden
---
I'm sure Ghostface has a selfie with Diavolo.
---
Nurses calling
---
Your reasoning is weak, your evidence anecdotal at best and blatantly biased at worst, you seem to not understand what I’m saying, so I’ll say it as plainly as I can. You can try all you want to “add more fun to the game”, but without a large enough community to uphold the development of the game, there will be no game to add fun to. Casual gamers won’t keep a game going for years and years, and casual gamers won’t try to elevate the game to achieve a higher status within the mainstream market, further increasing the exposure and player base of the game. This isn’t opinion, and it isn’t conjecture, any amount of knowledge about how the industry works will tell you that competitive communities make mainstream games, with very few exceptions. This is my final reply, as I simply don’t have the mental fortitude to keep dumbing down my points to the level that even a self absorbed crusader like you could understand. As a final message, I hope that someday you can come to view us filthy tryhards as more than “rivals”, I’m here to benefit the game in the long run, not in the same manner as you, but in the grand scheme, we want the same things, a better game
---
That was basically my reaction to hitting the cap
---
Jesus christ this is what it looks like when you only have 2 brain cells.
---
You must be fun at parties
---
This is fantastic! Make another one next year so we can see the progress you've made as an artist.
---
Jeff players are usually more polite than that.
---
Daily, maybe?
---
Ikr it makes me wanna die, servers actually increase latency
---
Not as much as WGLF, which can double the max BP.
---
Are you kidding me? The finger-knife animation is the best one in the game.
---
Not just a survivor main, a garbage one as well
---
But they dont have flashlights and I put on lightborne
---
Konami killing Silent Hills was a blessing in disguise, Kojima would have undeniably screwed the pooch, not to say Silent Hill hasn't already been screwed but Kojima just happened to hit lightning in a bottle with MGS
---
Someone photoshop this
---
Prayer beans 😂😂😂 
---
I can't even with reddit sometimes
---
But depending on the amount of times we chase and I hit them they get some for max chase most likely max co op with leader or something and they get wiggle max and they get the leaving bonus and I try to run Bps so survivors get a lot of bp
---
What games have you been in? In my experience as a solo survivor, at least two of my fellows are slow crouched walking or hiding most of the match. The amount of times I see a survivor go into a locker while the killer chases someone else entirely and leaves me to die on my first hook is in the 10% range.
---
When I get board with the game I just screw around, do the most toxic shit, and do stupid challenges like no blink nurse.
---
I’m so glad Australia got one. Was so sure we’d be left behind for years like almost every other game
---
I've seen videos of it before, so it's not just you. I don't own Laurie or have DS, so I can't be of much more help.
---
It’s obvious to me that, throughout this entire exchange, you haven’t considered my words once, nor have you reflected on your own words. My initial worry was correct, my words have fallen on deaf ears, good luck in your future games, soon the community will decide which of us is right i suppose.
---
Yes but once they have maxed their points and reached 32k, Wiggling won't get them more but unhooks with WGLF will.
---
And the last time I tried to get people to unhook some people leave their teammates on hook I’m low ranks because I’m trying to De pip to help new players so people will just ignore people on hook sometimes so I usually never hook so I can let them wiggle and live
---
Dwight teabagging?
---
I sleep. 
---
Quentin dealing drugs?
---
*Real Shit?*
---
Very true which is why I also let them pallet stun me a lot
---
Protip, if you have a mouse with the side buttons, use those.  
---
Now you can fap to Jane's thiccness and do a gen.  
---
If you don't, do it anyways.
---
Can you send the url or tell me the name of the videos? It is really frustating to simply get denied the perk
---
Even though I think most people want to actually play the game and get the BP to improve their game, a lot of them, especially bottom rank people stuck at 16 just want to ruin someone's day.
---
Thank you so much idk how the hell I missed this
---
Demo
---
You might have to actually run Wake Up like I do. I escape almost *exclusively* out the gate now or I die. If I didn’t have Tier 3 Wake Up, I would never escape because even then it’s close. That 15% makes the difference so for the first time Wake Up is now one of the most important survivor perks. If you’re not running it you have no room to complain about the time it takes to open the gate sns. I run Self Care, Calm Spirit, Bond, and Wake Up and I’ve never had a higher escape rate.
---
100 extra if you mori it
---
turn off safe search and go to images
---
You're just an actual idiot.
---
I love using aultrism builds aka perks like autodidact and we'll make it borrowed time
---
Yeah I thought about the idea of having a totem marked. I did not however, think of you being able to swap marks to trick survivors. That is actually a good idea. That with the totems only getting lit when they are activated could honestly make all totem perks better!
---
By "videos" I mean clips from this subreddit. I use mobile, so that's not really a thing I could do, so I'm sorry for being useless
---
Could you do a P3 Dwight??
---
Scooby wanted to many Scooby snacks, BHVR couldn't afford him.
---
In case you haven't noticed,  DBD is just a tad edgy. 
---
If there are real horrors behind the names of a perk, all the better.
---
as soon as i read your first argument i believe i responded directly with "your opinion is invalid".
---
please go back to where it all started and read again. in dead by daylight, we call this "looping".
---
here, i call it "what the f was your glitch"
---
I'm buying the Chapter and any cosmetics that come with it. Ahoy.
---
And and the survivors at 3 am looking for praying beans
---
I’m a survivor main, and my rule is to spare the last one who don’t know how to play the game. But, most of them tend to kill themselves on first hook so yea..smh
---
in other words, cheap ass crappy servers with 0,1 bandwidth didn't work as we expected, please wait while we do more tests until people don't complain about our crappy servers
---
I. Want. Billy boi.
---
Or maybe do skill checks that give you a percentage of the bar. At least that way it’s far less button mashing
---
I’d argue just the opposite, I know far more people for play not because they grinding the gameplay loop, but because they enjoy grinding the rank, I know anecdotal evidence is weak, but it’s not like I can survey the player base on why they play, so anecdotal is as good as it gets
---
Kill your friends is my favorite online co op thing to do with friends. The only thing I've been doing on dbd as of late
---
TBF, it still wouldn't have killed DbD without the lawsuits.
---
Ok I LOVE “Jeepers!” I would 100% use that perk
---
You should go for licensed dlc's, as the other characters can be bought with iridescent shards.
---
However, this la advice, do what you wanna do.
---
Wait is ruin in shrine or am I a rusty doorknob?
---
You stab people but don't hook them, you let them struggle off.
---
Should’ve stayed on top of it. If he hit you he would’ve been put in the animation and you would’ve been able to escape. Other than that i run adrenaline and stay close to an exit gate so when killer closes hatch i just open up a gate
---
Survivors would almost always escape lol
---
These look great even the clowns looks nice great job!
---
Personally I wouldn’t buy character like plague with money as they can be bought with in game currency.
---
I will now accept every survivor is a killer and that I have to kill those killers
---
I don't understand the anger from people in this game man...I play Killer/Survivor equally, there are aspects to both sides that are great/not so fun. 
---
Unless someone is legitimately breaking the game to out perform you, just do better. People are just way too stubborn to alter how they play.
---
Killers, you don't have to kill all 4 survivors for it to be a great game.
---
Survivors, you don't have to make it out alive for it to be a great game. Chances are if you're playing great as a survivor and you don't make it out, it's because your teammates were shitty not because the killer was 'cheating'
---
Bill mains rise up.
---
For PC, it’s not as bad (as far as I know) because of dedicated servers. On Console, if we have a killer with DooDoo internet, just forget about phase 2, you’re dead. It’s frustrating at times when killer has the advantage because of their bad internet. (Coming from a killer main with doodoo internet btw)
---
I’d hope if you like doing gens you wouldn’t need technician. I guess the reduced audio is ok.
---
Everybody gangster till the beans start prayin
---
Yeah but think of it this way. If there are no dull totems then the perk can not activate. So then there’s more of an insensitive to break dull totems, which will make noed a less overpowered perk. I get what you mean by there’s not much risk but if you’re against a good team they should already be destroying dull totems. If it does get in the game (which I don’t think it will) they might nerf it but I think it’s fine they way it is
---
Oh... oh my.
---
poor guy :(
---
If this was in, most of the time the Killer would stick around the hook for a bit.  If you were to unhook yourself as the last survivor, they would just knock you down again.
---
Nea looking fine as hell now
---
Ghosty boy really fucked up Kate huh?
---
personally i had already put the thought into it. i do apologize tho if i wasn't specific enough to help you see past a very strong hint that you might be mistaken. this hint was also followed up with a very legitimate reason, scientifically proving you as wrong. the fact that i survive many games where a camper gets no kills. 
---
it only takes 1 instance of your theory or opinion being wrong to cause it to be scientifically untrue. it does not take a majority vote or tally. i say this because you are so interested in showing everyone how educated and intelligent you are insisting on getting the last word leaving me with my delusions of grandeur.
---
Yes
---
You guys are spoiling me too much :')
---
I got a hate comment on console because i downed him then brought him to the exit gate. He said "lmao trash killer couldnt find a hook". Buddy, if you reading this then you smell like cheese.
---
Tinkerer. Than you'd be able to head over there before the gen pops and grab em
---
If you also have a trap setting killer (Trapper, Hag, etc) you can use the limited escape routes to force them into a trap
---
No Mother might be the perk for fuckers who wanna die and stay alive because unlike Unbreakable you can get up every time
---
Ha kill those survivors
---
Bro I only disconnect against Spirits because of Tumblr
---
Best case scenario, you have DS and Deliverance, get off the hook, get slapped, and hit your DS. But any killer who isn’t R20 will just chase you down again.
---
Nancy because of Fixated
---
Nea's be like:
---
Awesome! I have a P3 Claudette and a P3 Jeff.
---
I think I might know why your ass is clenched.
---
I seen a lot of hate on Dwight and how he’s always a “baby Dwight” lol and I like to prove wrong. Went to rank 13 just using him. Not bad considering I’m kinda new
---
I’ve been playing this game since release, I’ve got just as much experience as you, maybe more, the main difference is that I don’t rush to my death, make a single ok play against a baby killer who any decent player can tell isn’t very good, and clip it, claiming it’s proof that you should hook dive a killer that’s hard camping. A good killer will punish it, every time, but I’m guessing you just don’t have experience playing against those
---
Good luck vaulting any windows against him.
---
Otz looking fine there, what a man
---
Honestly this is why I love playing on PS4. Even the saltiest of survivors are about a 2/10 on the angry scale. Sure there’s people who call me trash or say I’m bad but my psn has the word Trash in it so I can shrug it off but people know Sony doesn’t take actual racism or homophobia so they aren’t nearly as bold as they’d be on PC so really salty PS4 survivors just keep it to themselves and stay with spicy armpits.
---
Kind of odd to not have a server in the most central area of a county.
---
Ears broken
---
No. Clearly we aren't.
---
It was a few weeks back
---
Too bad you didn’t get 420 xp 😔
---
Sad that the console providers are more likely to do anything than the devs of this game.  PC reporting is pointless.  They can literally be hitler and be free.
---
I know, F in the chat
---
So say we all
---
Fuccccck
---
I like the Friday more. But it wouldn’t say it’s popular now, but just months ago there was quite a few people. Not sure why people here like to be dicks about the whole thing
---
Survivors don't have a single perk with an effect stronger than NOED, Devour Hope, Rancor etc...Learn more about perks before making false statements born of ignorance.
---
I will
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
wow you're a super good guesser! 
---
what else can you guess about me that may be relevant to this discussion in any way?
---
i see you're also very good at making assumptions as well but i'm just too afraid to ask for anymore..
---
your arguments are really silly, now saying i'm claiming something is proof you should hook dive a killer that's hard camping.. again mr. thiccums, all i said was it's proof that someone being camped does not guarantee the killer a kill, which was your argument, period. that in itself should have allowed you the understanding that you were making a very silly argument saying the best way to deal with a camper is to just let them camp because they are going to get a kill. 
---
if the camper gets the kill, it's because you allowed them to, or because they earned it. usually it's the first one.
---
all of these things i have said are facts, not opinions, and i'm sorry to you that they are in direct conflict with your inner beliefs.
---
Oregon server!!! I did not expect that. I expected to have to play on California servers.
---
Nah it has a high learning curve but Jason was buffed a lot since the game released
---
Me when my cat started crying and jumped up on my lap right as I got a skill check.
---
You were 25 days back. You thought it was on the 10th, you were wrong.
---
I suggest keeping one main killer for getting blood points and focus level a killer one at a time. I’m doing legion for the bloody mask and honestly I’ve seen more moris and bp items not necessarily more high tier items.
---
Does it destroy the trap *woah*
---
Right.
---
Maybe they will just keep Korea on the peer-to-peer environment because they know Koreans would lose their shit if hit detection got worse with servers, being that they are used to very low latency connections, with which peer-to-peer is actually superior. And SWF is not all that popular in Korea, nor are disconnects a major problem, which are two of the actual improvements BHVR cite dedicated servers will bring with them.  So I could see that being a possibility.
---
To be fair, hit detection on the PTB seemed to be server-validated to some extent, because otherwise I wouldn't be able to explain the delayed hits and double hits. But there were also still ridiculous hits, too. The killer's host latency advantage is the one thing I expected dedicated servers would get rid of, given that the killer will then also be a client to a remote server, so I'm very disappointed that from the sound of things, it may still be a killer-sided and killer-favoured hit detection system.
---
I would like for them to elaborate on the hard facts of dedicated servers, such as hit registration (detection/validation) system, networking techniques such as lag compensation, server tickrates/framerates, packet transfer rates, server hardware...
---
I love that not a single comment in here disagrres with this man, and he hasn't said a word
---
Dont. Use it as a way to improve against good players.
---
if you're so good, why are you so scared of being identified and pointed out as my rival? 
---
a good survivor doesn't concern themselves with things like sandbagging, hiding spots, killer perks, or people trolling. a good survivor grows to understand that all of those things are part of the game and if that's the game you want, that's the game you got. i dare you in game to deny me altruism so you can rush an objective or self-care for survival points.. i actually double-dare you..
---
i'd say that's an even easier concept.
---
you should have taken my advice and thought about your answer.
---
Cooperative Strength sounds amazing!

Thanks! Definitely will try that out
---
I’ve had that happen a couple times as survivor but it was probably a year ago or more. You’d think they woulda fixed it by now.
---
F
---
-rep lagged all the time didnt respect the 4% shit killer
---
Particles from lanterns from the moonrise event, which should not be appearing
---
On the survivor side, however, we get god killers and baby meg teammates
---
It's not that he's broken, it's that he's just flat out not fun to play against. Even with his last rework, he's kinda in the same boat as Bubba. Easily one of the weakest killers, decent to good in a skilled players hands, but unfun to vs in all levels of play. Nothing is fun about getting sprinted at by a guy who hit the idiot on your team and can now find the rest of you over 30m away. Randos are a favtor in this, but he's just annoying as hell. I would have more fun getting found by a rank 1 Nurse within the first 15 secs and losing the chase than playing a 30 min game because all the Legion does is smack your team with Sloppy Butcher in his power and then wait until you heal to pop his power again
---
Spirit is easily 2nd best killer and she has better perks than freddy. But like the other comments said you can get her through playtime, though personally I'd prefer to use my shards on perks or cosmetics.
---
"Dedicated" servers. More like Crapper
---
A good survivor tries to teach others how to survive, how to win. That’s one of my goals, along side the long term goal of a united player base. And I don’t want to be identified as your rival, because that directly defeats my purpose of uniting the community
---
They asked for tips not blatant game mechanics
---
I'll never forget this poor Nea.
---
You keep coming back to this point that I’ve already addressed several times, I never once, through out this whole conversation, said you should play hide and seek all game. All I said was “don’t sprint towards an almost guaranteed death” Avoiding unnecessary risk does not equal hiding from the killer all game
---
The game isn’t fun if the killer doesn’t try to kill you. Idk why you think that’s fun for the survivors.
---
Suffering.
---
If survivors are "bad" then you're right where you need to be, my friend. Though I must say you'll find them at any rank.
---
As for the long chases, better survivors can loop any rank killer for a while at a good loop. The difference between losing and winning as killer is knowing when to leave a chase. If someone has a good loop, you leave them and pressure gens. 
---
Sounds like you are at a crossroads. Just stick around in that rank, as you wont pip up much from people dcing, and practice a bit.
---
It’s not always safe to get from one loop to the next. If a killer is chasing a survivor around the same loop for more than 45 seconds, they should move on. You can’t make a survivor play how you want them to just as we can’t make a killer play how we want them to. 
---
If you’re referring to those few infinite loops that are literally impossible for killers to do anything about, I understand that complaint. But it’s pointless for a survivor to go from L/T to jungle gym to next place vaulting and wasting pallets if they’re able to just merry go round and the killer is willing to go for the ride.
---
Try dropping pallets asap, don't relying on vaults and gen rush the f* out of him.
---
I mean, Korea isn't really *that* far from Tokyo relatively speaking. A huge number of Aussies are further from Sydney than Seoul is from Tokyo. Same with a lot of places in the US, Canada and Russia being further than Seoul to Tokyo away from their nearest server.
---
I assume they've been testing this and either found that the connection from Korea to Tokyo was fine or as you say they're keeping them peer-to-peer.
---
As long as SWF's don't get the option to opt-out nurse/spirit, and nurse/spirit doesn't get the option to opt-out SWFs, that's something I'm fine with
---
Amazing, every word of what you just said was wrong
---
Had the same thing happen to me as hag once. I dont understand spending 15 minutes sitting there waiting for the game to finish just so you can say you dont like the killer.
---
Thank you!
---
I just want people to win and get points which I give them through chases and letting them wiggle out I’m generally sorry if that isn’t fun for them but I try really hard to let people have a easy win :(.
---
You don't think being able to perfectly communicate in a game where A) Communication outside third-party programs is intentionally difficult, and B) Stealth killers rely on a lack of communication, isn't OP?
---
You call me stubborn yet you are down here as far in this argument as I am. I said I hate the people on this game who only complain about killers and survivors, and will put down other people's content because of it. I wasn't offended, just tired of all the losers on this game complaining about shit. What it boils down to is that I want to browse this sub without wading through tons of horse shit that's basically a civil war. I will go to any lengths to get a point across even if it means debating a stranger on the internet. Call me an asshole, but guess what? I am actually never toxic in the game itself unless someone is toxic to me. I do my best to be friends with people, and I love to mess around. But when I see assholes like the one I initially replied to it just goes against all of that.
---
why you such a rotten asshole, man?
---
It's Chinese
---
The first year was worse than the BF3 launch year. I thought BF3 was bad, imagine all the people who bought F13 and found better games within the year and a half you couldn't play quick play. Only reason BF3 made it was because multi was semi playable (even if a little) and the game already had a big fan base.
---
Its a legend like the yeti
---
eh i could totally do better
---
heya
---
Rip to those in hawaii aka me
---
Yeah but the joke is that people always said Ridley would never get into Smash because he’s “too big,” but then he was revealed early on into Ultimate. It has nothing to do with Metroid aside from character origin.
---
Sure, all it takes to ruin their day is being good at looping. They are literally just an M1 killer with a power that’s only good when combined with Save The Best For Last, and compared to Wraith, Myers, Ghost Face, Bubba, Billy, Plague, Doc, and even Trapper, their power is worthless.
---
Wraith: Easier first hit and sneak attacks, or scuffed Gengrab Spirit.
---
Myers and Ghost Face: Exposed for easy oneshots.
---
Bubba: You have the option of instadowning a survivor at decent risk.
---
Billy: Insane map pressure and can oneshot survivors.
---
Plague: CLEANSE AND DIE. Plus she can apply Broken meaning no heals for them.
---
Doctor: Stealth is no longer an option, and nether are skill checks.
---
Trapper: Entire areas can become killing fields, and he can turn the basement into a deathtrap.
---
Legion has none of these benefits. He can’t break loops like Trapper, or apply a dangerous status effect like Myers, Ghost Face, Doc, or Plague. He can’t instadown with no set up like Billy or Bubba, and he can’t even effectively convert his power into a kill like Wraith since it’s fucking worthless at actually giving him pertinent information. What’s that? He can see Survivors who DON’T have Deep Wound applied? How exactly does that convert into anything besides another stab from Feral Frenzy? You can’t do any real damage to them, since Deep Wound is a fucking joke of a status effect that will be healed long before you can even reach the next survivor. What’s even worse? It needs you to find someone first, so have fun on Temple Of Purgation, Haddonfield, Crotus Prenn, Badham, or any other large map, because Stealth bodies you here as well.
---
TL;DR- Git gud at looping and Legion is an easy win, since his power is the equivalent of the prize you get out of a cereal box.
---
You are literally in the meme, do you also complain about gen rushing?
---
Live all you want in denial, sfw isnt broken
---
Polite response of gratitude with a promise to follow up later that will never be acted upon, but appreciated none the less.
---
Ok I’ll stop putting so much into getting kills and start focusing more on map and gen pressure so hopefully it’ll make winning and learning a bit easier thank you
---
Ngl, I don't play killer because all my games are high ranks vs me who is a rank 20 killer. There's no joy in not even being able to hook someone and getting tbagged at every pallet because you're new and inexperienced while they're rank 8.
---
It’s probably your connection if you lag so often that it’s the sole reason you can’t rank up.
---
Use all your good blood point offerings on the character/killer before you prestige. Survivor puddings, escape cakes and bloody party streamers, use them all up! Load up on bloodpoints before you prestige!

---
It might be in the charity case, if it’s not then it may have just been an exclusive that he gave out
---
Not even sure what the killer’s thought process was. Did he really think he could manage to hook both of you? Even if you were already downed, he still has to choose between you or feng. Instead of taking his kill, he lets you both get away...
---
Oh dam. Maybe some day in the future i will prestige then. Thank you a lot for explaining this to me i appreciate it a lot.
---
Can relate lol
---
Flicks are irrelevant in this game, and there's no hit you can get with a mouse that you can't replicate on a controller. When playing Nurse, it's easy to warp to a pallet and swing on a survivor while 180ing int he process. Pulling off a 360 is actually harder on mouse than a controller, simply because it's easier to manipulate the character and camera precisely on a controller.
---
Im surprised he didnt just grab you off the door and took the lunge swipe at the start. He had the time to walk up
---
If you play killer at all you’ll want Leatherface for his BBQ &amp; Chili perk.
---
I didn’t take a screenshot but I’ve got a video of a post-game chat from when I used to main Pig.
---
I got contacted with extreme toxicity in the post game chat and I only responded with “Okay :)” and “Thanks!”. Needless to say, they didn’t like that and escalated to saying I should, and I quote:
---
‘Die alone in [my] mother’s basement from shock-induced pain”

Literally me when I’m trying to eat no skill check for ages, soon as I get something on a fork I hear the noise

Yeah but I have good WiFi speeds it’s not every single game but it’s 1/3 games
---
This sub will never be anything than survivors: this is what killers think; isn't it TOXIC?!
---
Killers: this is what survivors think; isn't it TOXIC?!
---
It really makes me feel like more of us need to play both sides, there are small truths hidden in all of the he said she said complaining but we wont get to the bottom of them without dialogue. And making memes about it isn't helping this community in any way.
---
They can wait
---
Wow I'm not alone.
---
Evil Within 2 did a way better job with that than the first game
---
Me with tier 3 Myers getting my forehead bruised by pallets
---
Sure. Makes it easier for killers. They're adding dedicated servers anyways, so that won't be abused for long.
---
Yeah, after I played the Alpha, I felt like I already had my fill. Eventually bought it and tried to play it again, couldn't get back into it.
---
You forgot "Down someone, but throigh magical BS they manage to scrape themselves out the exit."

I’m confident that we’ll eventually get him. Once the lawsuit is solved I bet they’ll nab him.

the goodest noodle in the dbd commuity and is damn good at the game
---
literally what else could you want in a content creator
---
Me too. I already had my messages set to private but then I was getting people adding me as a friend just to send me shit because of this game. So now they’re turned off, too. Gat damn.
---
i don't know how many other ways to tell you you are wrong in every aspect of everything.
---
biggest complaint on DbD forums when i was paying attention last week, camping and tunneling.
---
people crying and begging please BHVR, please give us some kind of way to do something against these dirty campers and tunnelers.
---
in my games, killers camp and tunnel all of the time, no matter the rank. some killers do not, but a lot do. the rank is not what matters, and in games where myself or other people are getting camped and tunneled, i can easily double pip, because I know how to play and am not using some lame excuse about "punishing a camping killer". I know how to break a camp, and a tunnel for that matter, and it's not hard. I do it all the time.
---
i currently avoid red ranks for 2 reasons:
---
1) i still have a bad taste in my mouth from you lame dc'ers. in an effort not to encourage the habit i'll just say we all know the real reason you do it.. i have had to unfollow so many streamers in red ranks who disconnect to avoid moris, maps, killers, hooks, cuz their hiding spots got exposed, whatever.. it's really dumb and hard to watch, fyi.. at least they're holding on to the "competitive edge"
---
2) i don't struggle on first hook, ever, no exceptions. if my team doesn't understand that i need to come off of a hook within 60 seconds or possess the ability to make that happen, as i have stated previously, it's literally in my best interest to move on to the next game. it took me exactly 60 seconds to find out everyone on my team is a super lame stealthy (even if they were rushing objectives) and they have collectively decided that they don't need my help on their team. 
---
to elaborate on #2, i'm trying to have a good time &amp; get paid. i can do neither while acting as "bait" or whatever you'd like to call me while you either hide or rush objectives. no matter what happens at that point you have all decided that i don't get to participate any more this round for whatever reasons you tell yourself, and i'm okay with that. i'd rather lend my services to people who appreciate them and return the favor, plain and simple. 
---
i feel like most people struggle on, hoping that something cool happens later or maybe just trying to at least get the 892 struggle points before they die. both are things i don't understand. instead of spending that 60 seconds longer in a lame game for less than 900 blood points, i could load into a brand new game and easily harvest 4000+ within the first minute.
---
since so many people struggle for those points i think people feel like that's a normal aspect of the game and accept it, but i believe if you left me there to die or as bait or whatever you want to call it you don't deserve to get a single blood point profit from me from that point on, even if i could have easily been saved and run out of the door with you.
---
This was almost exactly (can barely remember, so many messages) what someone wrote on my Steam profile once. They mainly say something about camping/tunneling.
---
LMAO dude now THIS was a nice meme.
---
It's quite tiring playing a match and then later noticing that some random butthurt dude with a twisted mindset sent you a message complaining and insulting you just because he died in a game.
---
Entity rips clouds fatter and fatter for each regant added
---
The best one for me was playing Huntress. Get sent a friend request with a message of ''Hatchet hore."  Missing the w and everything. 
---
Oh no. I used the killer's power. How very dare I.
---
*currently avoid red ranks because I can’t get clips bullying baby killers if I’m higher than purple ranks. There, fixed that typo for you
---
I only the have the jacket and the screwdriver:(
---
Well you tried, that's what matters, gj
---
I mean yeah pretty much :P

i don't want to be in games with you, because you have very high rates of dc'ing.. 
---
purple rank baby killers are the best tho, i totally agree &lt;3
---
You’re the problem if you don’t think Doctor’s a problem with Ruin and his passive
---
Its amazing how easily people get mad when they dont survive even though they're not really expected to. They have a good chance but it's in the lore, it's the basis of the game, and hell, i think I remember a loading screen basically saying "you're expected to die".
---
Dummy thicc fog 👌☄️☄️

They’re just a company that’s very out of touch run by old Japanese business men.  They would never allow their ip to be used by another company.

good news, i'm already purple.. rank reset was yesterday, i'll see you coming thru i'm sure.. 
---
again, fyi, 99.9% of my hours in DbD my name is EntitledBoner, you can't miss me.. what might your actual real gamer name be? or should i assume you're gonna make something up now like a normal stealthy internet commando?
---
Who would win, a bloodthirsty killer or a tree?
---
If the killer closes the hatch, I know that when you jump off the edge you’ll land on top of the closed hatch. So if you have a key boom easy escape.

The keeper as new killer would be amazing. Helmets all over the map he can teleport to 👌🏼
---
*disconnects*
---
Remember when they said they fixed this Lmao
---
Doctor doesnt get past mid tier no matter what you do. His power is good for finding people early game and maybe once in a while if they happen to tier up. Even in loops if the survivor plays properly you can still loop for a good amount of time with him shocking you. Doc has no chase potential either. The only time people ever struggle with doc is on the occasion where the killer is genuinely good and has a good build (which doesnt happen often since nobody plays him) or if theyre low rank. Doctor with ruin isnt a problem unless hes get the rest of his build to support it.
---
Table-WB, can’t wait for you to show me how a real gamer plays, really curious on what skills I failed to pick up after playing this game since day 1, skills that only an *ascended* beings such as you possess
---
I love how you conveniently forget that it already was this way last year, before they nerfed it and added the instant death thing. Plenty of times I've seen the last survivor kobe, get lucky because the killer smacks them early, and manage to get away. That's the truth bub. Keep downvoting me killer mains.

Yep. The memes here are pretty fucking terrible. It’s also easy to get likes here

it begins with you really happy, and ends with you really sad.. 
---
if you don't know me, you haven't been around that long guy. just saying.
---
if you truly bought the game day 1, you have missed a lot of gameplay and learning opportunities, and if you have literally played stealthy since day 1 for more hours than i have then you are just a sad individual with no friends who entertains himself by becoming a digital boulder for long periods of time.
---
either way, lul.
---
Definitely not the top horror game but I'd argue the top *multiplayer* horror game
---
I too would like to know this. I've never heard a survivor breathing as killer, only steps. And with lit totems I can only hear if im right next to it.
---
Not a killer main, just pointing out that this would only work in rank 20, and would merely waste time in all the other ranks
---
I’m determined to get to rank 1 someday, but idk if it’s possible for me. My main goal while playing is getting everyone out, not pipping. I feel like it’s impossible unless you’re playing a 4 stack.
---
Spend it all on Clown
---
ALL OF IT
---
777 is usually the winning number on casino machines I think. But I'm not sure, that's just what I got from it.
---
Surv bad killer good maybe something new?
---
Technically it is supposed to give you rarer items in your bloodweb but its barely noticeable imo
---
Not running at the killer=becoming a digital boulder, lel ok, I really can’t wait for these ascended gameplay pointers
---
I only get braindead teammates against killers running Ruin. Its actually so unfun to play DbD right now as a solo player.
---
The game seems to have a hard on with turning killers into m1 heroes. His power is total garbage. It’s unfun to play with and against.
---
Why are you taking about battlefield 3?
---
Not quite the same game, but the idea carries, as I love when you get people who cry but don't understand the game at all.
---
In the game Identity V there is an ability called Wanted Order. How it works is if you chair (hook) a survivor and 3 others are still standing then one of them has their aura revealed. This remains untill the person on chair dies or like 20 seconds after the one on chair is off it. When under the effect, that survivor has a mark on their icon, so it's clear who's revealed.
---
I'll still have players try to hide while under it then cry about how I was camping when I find them.
---
Well now I’m mad for everyone!
---

---
Happened to me, but I didn't get the hatch, instead I had been devoured by The Entity because the timer ran out. Good times 👍
---
Bruh these would be so good for the adept achievements
---
Bonus points for having to leave every 2nd lobby for 4 digit pings nowadays? Ouch.
---
Thats a big no no. I would rather have dedicated servers come out with bugs that only effected 1 killer and other relatively small issues than have them delayed when this is their biggest dlc yet. Looks like its gonna be pretty hit or miss.
---
Haha yeah they were nice while they lasted on the ptb. Apparently they're delayed now.
---
Omg I cannot wait for you to do my piggy. All your designs have turned out so awesome so far. I especially like the Doctor and Ghostface!
---
I have to disagree, judging by the feedback that they received from the dedicated servers in PTB, I’m not complaining they didn’t give us the broken product. If only the few people playing in PTB were having issues, I can’t imagine with launch day of ST. They’re only delaying it a month or 2 at most, nbd. Patience is key.
---
poor hag, shes so short that she has to respect 360s, cuz that happens to me a lot xd
---
Damm. Well its good to know at least
---
Definitive is the only edition when it comes to console
---
As a comparison on why horrific launches can break a game and recover properly. F13 did not have the fan base around that Battlefield did when BF3 came out. That's the only reason BF3 survived it's first launch year. If F13 launched and actually allowed you to utilize quickplay I'm sure it would have a ton more people rather than a whole year and a half of having to look for groups in private match. That's the biggest factor of the death of F13, as players moved onto other games and didn't have the time to play more. Not to mention the countless bugs..
---
Art is better than the actual character :')
---
Literally happened to me a few games ago. But I was looping the killer all game.. killer gets me survivors literally run past me and go through the exit gate. (I had already fully recovered)
---
No joke. I wanna preface this me saying I was at rank 9 and my SWF was rank 3-2. 
---
I straight up DC'd once for this kind of thing. Had a party bring two bloody streamers. They proceeded to just bully me all game. Flashlight stuns all the time, they 99'd a bunch of hooks to tap for when I finally got a down, bagging after every pallet, head on to just make it worse, and they stopped doing gens to farm BP off me with their streamers. I only got four hits that game (two of which were on my only down that didn't matter) and one didn't matter because it came at the end and they had Adrenaline. 
---
Found them all grooving in the exit gate. I did my first and only DC at that point. I hope their offerings burned, they got minimal BP, and I wasted their time like they wasted mine. It was hell.
---
Huntress bugs where known from 3 month ago, when they first tested the servers and in 3 month they managed to fix none of the bugs. And no one tested servers internally? How hard is it to miss such an obvious bug? Well of course where is 5 million other bugs they are more worried about.
---
The biggest factor was the lack of content. Friday the 13th would never be a huge game due to the genre and not being a AAA title. The game still had a strong fanbase until the developers dipped and stop making content, using the lawsuit as a scapegoat
---
Idk maybe I'm just biased because my experience on the ptb was fantastic. Lobby dodging was a thing of the past and lag based issues were basically non existent. I never ran into any bugs or major problems either.
---
Fog like Jane.
---
Yeah, I can’t really state either way, I didn’t play PTB. Their article goes into more depth than I have for their reasons for the delay, it’s posted on all their social media along with a list of where the servers are going to be located. I understand the frustration of no dedicated servers but I am super glad they didnt delay ST as well. It’d be like the infamous Clown Console Release debacle lol.

No, he's too busy uploading. Luckily, Otzdarva has been free for 7 months

I mean it’s a shitty thing to do, but playing against doctor is just straight up not fun
---
Doing gens, you?
---
We’ve all seen a Claud like that
---
It would!
---
Me trying to catch up to the person who’s been looping me for 3 gens XD
---
Nah it should be common knowledge that whippin out ya balls is typically frowned upon
---
I believe playing smaller characters like claudette/meg/feng are better for hiding and staying immersed. Urban evasion and spine chill are really good together because you can hide before the killer gets to the generator you're on as long as you know what direction they're coming from. Premonition is a good detection perk as well but you won't get a notification if they're coming from behind your character. An exhaustion perk is always good as well to make distance so sprint burst, balanced landing, lithe, they're all good in their own ways although sprint burst doesn't require you to vault or find a ledge to drop off of to activate them. The last perk can be up to your discretion, iron will can keep you quiet if you're injured and can't heal and will aid in not being detected by the killer as easily. Otherwise you could bring a perk like prove thyself to get gens done quicker with others or another perk related to generators like technician because it reduces sounds from your generator and if you do miss a skill check, it might not explode. For items you can obviously bring toolboxes with add ons or a healthkit to heal but I personally use bond to have my teammates heal me. As long as you're pulling your weight and getting gens done, helping teammates out when you can, being immersed and adopting a stealth playstyle isn't awful. Sorry for the long comment but I hope you figure it out!
---
If both survivors have the perk, only one token is consumed. The games chooses one of the two survivors.
---
not when people really really like you.. usually they want to play with your balls..
---
Which one?
---
It should also reveal where the hatch is and give you a permanent 15% speed boost for no reason other than that you managed to RNG an 11% chance.
---
Rank reset every month is way too much they should space it out more
---
Yeah I don’t remember consenting to that
---
Imagine if it actually made it super dense u needed to play Myers or ghost face to see anyone lmao
---
Yeah, the characters that are free DLC on PC are also free on the switch version, so Huntress and Nea/Nurse. You may have to download them, but they should be free.
---
This is way too fuckin relatable
---
Once upon a time, I got glitched under the stairs in red forest. Then the teabagging, exploiting little shits farmed my ass to high hell and after that traumatic experience I avoided playing killer for months. I main Nea now
---
I’m not even at the green ranks I’m finna get clapped in this reset
---
Obviously she managed to aim you right in the center ❤
---
Played the beta of this game, it was a gigantic buggy mess. Tried it at launch and literally none of the bugs had been fixed, it was the exact same as the beta. Came back again a few months later to find everyone was exploiting onto roofs and waiting for the timer to finish instead of actually playing. Heard the devs banned anyone that streamers didn't like as well. Nice game
---
All this time, I thought he said mountain llama.
---
I laughed reading this. Why do people take OUT OF ALL GAMES DBD so seriously the have to be crybabies
---
does the lawyer in you remember the disclaimer posted above identifying the effect of keeping your mouth open with weird stuff coming out around me? i believe once notified you're making a statement by continuing your actions.. 
---
at least i'm pretty sure that's what a disclaimer means.. i myself am not actually a lawyer
---
Maybe if you post it 6 more times it’ll sink in
---
U cant diss jason vorhees on HIS day solely meant for HIM
---
Are...are we really arguing the legality of your metaphorical balls in a DbD reddit post...why? Just why?
---
This shit happened to me when I played the game. I was new and someone commented on my steam profile about how I was shit. Lol I was new.  My friends and i counter raided his profile.
---
New posting idea: don’t spam a topic.
---
I wish you didn't point that out
---
Survivors like that are why I stop letting people go free.
---
I have lived long enough to become the villain.
---
Should be flaired as a shitpost
---
because you're too dumb to shut up and i'm too entertained, for the record.
---
You had your last chance before you were hooked. How is it not entitled to want a free second chance?
---
A few weeks ago I did a daily as Clown. High ranks because I don't play a ton of DBD atm.
---
I came up against what was quite obviously a 3 man SWF. What followed was a strange concoction of failed loops, failed flashlight saves, unhooking before I got 5 meters away. The works. They proceeded to get promptly destroyed despite me just being a pretty average killer/Clown. Mind you I didn't facecamp or nod my head or anything like that.
---
The following post-game chat was a thing of beauty. Apparently I super sweaty with my perks. Ruin/BBQ and 2 brown addons are sweaty? Okay. While they themselves all had meta perks and addons like purple flashlights. Also, they wished death and cancer upon me, like my braindead mother. I was apparently also molested by my father on my birthday. They also concluded that "he's probably black". An absolutely shitshow.
---
I honestly laughed about it for 2 days straight. I understand perfectly getting upset over a video game. Moreso when I was a teenager however. But I've never understood why someone have that burning desire to lash out in such a volatile way at strangers. What are they hoping to accomplish? Is it to vent their own frustrations, to feel better? Are they hoping they'd strike a nerve with the random internet stranger they're upset with? They'd never talk that way to someone if they were standing face to face with them.
---
If video games cause you to boil over to such a degree. Seriously reconsider your gaming habits and your mental attitude towards it.
---
Suauce
---
Every time I played Hag someone left me a comment I was camping cus I managed to teleport when they unhooked.
---
Literally had to name my profile private lol.
---
Hmm it would kinda make sense at 200.
---
As survivor, If I win a battle or two against the killer but ultimately lose the war, I’m happy with that.
---

---
Horror would apply to single player games as well. And multiplayer would also include co-op story games. So All DbD has is "Top Asymmetrical Multiplayer horror game". Only because it has no competition now. All it takes is one well funded studio with competent direction and this game is a goner.
---
Thank you good sir
---
I mean, killer has to get his points too. You double hook everyone, just make sure you keep track of who has been hooked lol. Don't let anyone be on hook three times.
---
Well doesn't most of Canada's population live near the US border anyway?
---
Got called a camper for successfully teleporting as hag, got called a camper in a steam comment by someone who was just flashlight stunning me and then dying pretty fast after their flashlight broke lol.
---
Bruh first time that happened to me I was so confused why I got one hit
---
Only if you have no idea what you're doing. The same could be said for a new person in DbD saying the same thing. "one bad spawn and you'll go down in seconds against the killer".
---
Let me know if you have any criticisms!
---
I am in confusion as u are using light theme
---
Sweet babies
---
The exposed chest hair is sending me
---
Its not that I dont like them
---
Its how effortless they are
---
Also using dead memes
---
Still??
---
There were plenty of ways to loop Jason. Windows and doors being the easiest just like DbD's Pallets and windows. And avoiding his shift is a mindgame on its own unless the Jason has like 5k hours.
---
Whole lot of people complaining how easy it was to die in F13 when they never took the time to learn how to loop. Its not like DbD, it has its own mechanics.
---
Alien: Isolation was great but doesn't hold a candle to Amnesia: The Dark Descent.
---
I thought it was good when I played with it way back when?
---
You wanna fight?
---
Be patient. The game is very difficult when you start. Just keep practicing and if you can get in a SWF group. They can help you. Find some friends or people you can play with regularly. Also, play some killer so you can get an idea of what they might be thinking. As you level your characters it becomes easier.
---
Problem is DbD limits the killers too much. And Jason's staple is his versatility. It just wouldn't work. And if they tried it would be disappointing to every fan of the movies much like Freddy is.
---
Most likely a placebo effect. The perk does very minimal in terms of usefulness.
---
You repost my meme then delete comments saying it is stolen
---
That movie was just on...
---
You need to do the shape next or else I'm pissed
---
I’ve watched the kill count for the film and it would be pretty cool to get him in the game
---
I see your lack of legs and validate the fuck out of it because honestly same.
---
On a serious note, this is great art and awesome color work, makes me wanna dig out my copics and get something done too.
---
Nice to know I’m not the only one who plays this drunk
---
This is an artist mood if I've ever seen one and you are so valid.
---
God I hate keys. Why we complain about anything else besides them is a mystery. Kinda crap there's an item in the game that let's you just skip your only objective just because.
---
Wow, thank you so much for the support! I'm so glad you and your friends have found it useful :) As I mentioned above, I'm toying with the idea of creating a follow-up or two with all the info I missed the first time around, if there are indeed new people who would find such a thing helpful.
---
Why do you even play the game then?
---
Really ? Thats even better then. I heard long ago that they made the game, and then got caught my the DbD devs and ended up associating somehow ?
---
Yea, his skills are so lackluster. I'd say he is almost as lazily thought up and executed as the cannibal... even *almost* is saying alot
---
I think when you are new it helps to also play killer a little because it shows you what NOT to do as a survivor. You will be able to get an idea of how the killer’s POV is different, how to hide and stay out of sight, how to be patient etc. A lot of the time new survivors just have no idea how to keep from getting seen in the first place. You don’t have to be great at looping to be successful if you know some tricks on staying out of sight.
---
Hello mate do you take comissions? Just saying stuff like this would look SICK as an avi or as a banner art of some sort
---
The best so far imo
---
Thanks for sharing. Awesome another bug. I'm stuck in yellow ranks where everyone camps and tunnels and trucks. I finally hit green and rank reset. I need to stop solo queuing.
---
Hey I’ve seen that clip
---
Do any of your friends play the game also? Much better experience playing with your friends just don’t tell the killer mains.
---
Urban makes you a hunchback.
---
I also enjoy doing this to those bastards who use a flashlight while you are breaking papers or picking up survivors.  I don’t face camp just tunnel so they get eliminated first.
---
It was.
---
I know im late to the party but the given reason BHVR hasnt changed it is that they want this game to be "scary" to play, and the need to mash ur keyboard builds stress. Ngl tho I think that both the mechanic and reason behind it are stupid af, this game loses the fear factor as soon as you start learning how to run away efficiently and having to mash anything in anygame is annoying
---
Nope it was Death Note
---
You can download the dlc with Huntress and David King free from the store
---
Ye as much as that’s annoying I wouldn’t punish for that but t-bagging is just rude
---
I got called camper yesterday by SWF for patrolling 3 gens as a Doctor, you know one of the endgame killers where he really shines only during 3 gen situations. My ruin was destroyed in seconds, all gens were done in a few minutes except for those three. Like I could literally feel it trough screen how their madness progressed to tier IV IRL because they literally couldn't do shit after only 3 gens were left. And I was farming them on the top of that, meanwhile ignoring their teabaggs and flashlight clicks.
---
Postgame chat was very interesting as always when playing against SWF. Oh boy rank resets...
---
Thanks fam very cool, be a party pooper elswhere.
---
Lmao yeah one does but we can't get past the camping. We save eachother and we both agreed being farmed is okay with borrowed time because we can loop and distract the killer long enough for the other to heal and do gens or come and switch places. I'll get hooked after I drop one pallet and the camp and tunnel.
---
Thanks in advance :^D
---
I legit want that.
---

Do everything you can to get max BP in all categories. It's easier when everyone else is in on it, of course.
---
Lmfao these people gave you so many free bloodpoints from the BPS and you complain because you didn’t get a 4K lmfao.
---
If you don’t have it, level up Laurie for Decisive Strike. Since it’s rework it’s super effective against camping and tunnelling killers
---
To be honest, I haven't gotten many salt mail for a while. Maybe one in a great while but most I ever get now are GGs.
---
Look at the comment above m8 XD
---
What a handsome man!
---
Nurse is way harder on console than on pc. Are you good with her?
---
As a Ghostface main I wanna cry. 
---
That said, this was dope.
---
Browser? I’m using DuckDuckGo
---
It is an extreme.  
---
No, UP on Doc doesn't counter DS.  
---
Back in the day people were able to hit the hard skill check, and now it's even easier.  
---
Also, Doc on rank 1 is basically unplayable most of the time.  
---
Point still stands.  
---
It's stupid because it isn't an anti tunnel perk.  
---
It's a perk that gives you 60 seconds of immunity after getting hooked.  
---
Jump in a locker while being chased and there is 0 counter play as killer.
---
Ah, yes.
---
Step Right up
---
Usually around rank 5-10 depending on how much I play that month.  I feel like now a days the average game is a 3k.  Im not amazing, but Im not bad.
---
Did you camp and tunnel hard tho?
---
A few minor tweaks would make her more bearable, Removing the collision during phasing, removing her ability to hear survivors while phasing (making this a common add on would be good) &amp; put her vault animation back in.
---
I find that odd that in moments of absolute terror, you can hear your heartbeat. Is that a real life thing too or just a game thing? I'm asking because I've had some "oh shit I'm gonna die" moments and I've never had that happen to me. Idk dumb question but I'm not sure, everyone is different.
---
Learn to read. It says fall 2019.
---
That cosmetic costs 21600 iridescent shards tho, so there’s a big probability that he is, indeed, a Jeff main. I do not approve my fellow Jeff main’s behavior, we are usually polite and fair players.
---
Where’s the bulge
---
I remember a time when I put on Mori and I just had a bad game. Checked my steam messages and saw someone so angry that they trashed talked me because I put on Mori. Not because I had good game and they were pissed, but because they won and felt like shitting on me.
---
I don't know what it is exactly but I love getting hate messages, gives me a good laugh.
---
Still no gens done tho
---
Is we will live forever a good perk? Should I start running it?
---
Billy doesn’t spin his weapon to hit you with the other side of it, he just spins it all the way around to the same side of the weapon
---
Adrenaline, self care, unbreakable, saboteur.
---
Just don't camp &amp; don't activate Night Shroud right after hooking someone. Easy
---
Michael’s is bad though, he just looks at his weapon
---
Cool idea but kinda too OP
---
Dont heal against a legion in general, massive waste of time especially if he has Sloppy Butcher. They WILL get that first hit on you, unless they're garbage.
---
I'm just waiting on the beaten up version, from season 1. Not throwing spoilers, you'll have to watch it yourself :)
---
It's meh but it might be decent in a 3-gen doctor build (Overcharge, Distressing, Unnerving, and a fourth perk of your choice so in this case fire up) since you'll be at near-max power when you do the 3-gen. 
---
IIRC the faster survivor pickups can help throw off flashlight saves. 
---
Really it's just a mediocre perk but I imagine it is only good for very niche builds.
---
That’s his upcoming nerf, can’t upset survivors if he can’t chase them.
---
NIG-
---
Never once have I thought an instantly broken Ruin did anything useful lol
---
Thank you! That answered my question perfectly, and no, I wasn't talking about decisive strike.
---
Keys exist because of moris.  Devs wanted to give each side their premature game-ending cheese.
---
I haven’t played the game in a year. Can someone explain to me what that bar at the top is?
---
Is Korea-Japan server connectivity that bad? The distance is kind of small, comparatively, like &lt;1000km. For Australia, with only Sydney servers people in Perth need to connect from over 3000km away.
---
That's lagswitching
---
It's not hack, but it *is* cheating
---
Slightly different things
---
Tell us more.
---
If you’re on console, while healing, press the same button you use for skill checks to use the insta heal
---
I honestly feel the same way about moris tho. I usually only use them in kill your friends as jokes.
---
Fuck that, get legion and stabby stabby everyone.
---
I’d say an add-on rework would be in order. Personally I’ve never really had a BAD game with Doc per say, so I can’t exactly say I know what’s best for him.
---
I had it once, killer picked me up and I hit it and nothing happened. Next time the killer picked me up they dropped me like I'd used it. It was weird.
---
I know what decisive strike does, and no, that's not what I'm talking about. The killer drops the survivor like normal, but instead of being put into the dying state, they're put into the injured state. u/DoteyByDaylight explained that it's because you gain a small portion of the wiggle bar when the killer puts you down, and if you were close enough, it gets filled up and you are put into the injured state instead of the dying state. 
---
And thanks about the bloodweb thing. I'll just keep trying. Although I have purple adrenaline on Claudette Morel already, and I have her 10 levels lower than Meg
---
Thanks!
---
Lagswitching is usually when 1 person gets stuck and it's usually the survivor and suddenly goes down and killer just appears there. I watched the killer sort of vacuum us back into him over and over while he just stood there and take swings at us. The other survivors were like halfway across the map and suddenly all 3 of them appeared at his feet.
---
That's not what I'm complaining about. It killed the mood of the game. Not the fact I didn't get a 4k. 
---
Keys disrupt the flow of the game. I couldnt give less of a shit about a 4k game. I play for fun.
---
Well for once I know how a butt clenching scenario goes down. 
---
Good to see the other perspective. Now all we need is ghostfaces 😆😆
---
I think if the killer closes the hatch you should be able to open it again with a timer just like a gate so that there is 3 places for the killer to check because if the gates spawn together then it's just gg. Either that or a key could spawn somewhere on the map that you have to try and find quickly or something.
---
I feel you, I got a pretty similar comment for showing him the way to the hatch and letting him go... "wow loser, can't even close the hatch when right on it".
---
I think if she types it in chat and leaves when the game ends you'll see the message
---
You get more points for a hatch escape so it makes sense that they’d go for it if they all found the hatch. I usually only use a key if I absolutely have to or I have an add-on for it.
---
Um, this game isn't a farming simulator, and literally the goal of the game as the survivor is to escape. The whole point of almost everything you do in game is to eventually escape, not teabag with the friendly killer, or farm your teammates off of hooks, or loop the killer and teabag at pallets, or DC when the killer has strong perks which prevent you from making bank, or anything else that disallows "[maximizing] your BP." The game is meant to be a struggle, not handed to you, I get that. But they could find less frustrating ways to incorporate something like Legion's power. I get it, at least it's not Tombstone, or Iridescent Head, or Corrupt Purge, or insert absurdly powerful add-on/power here, but if you're deathly allergic to peanuts, and someone hands you food that was made near peanuts, when your ass starts dying from anaphylactic shock, your last words won't be, "But...it wasn't the peanut itself." That is a marginal baseline for comparison at best, and in terms of gameplay, I would also rather let an IH Huntress or a Tombstone/SM-BM Meyers run a train on my team in 5 minutes then move on to the next game, than sit in a game with a power spamming Legion who just painfully slows the game and never kills anyone. Longest game I ever had was a game against a Legion named JustALittleBit, who ran Sloppy, Thanatophobia, Ruin, and Stridor. Never hooked a single person, I was the only one doing gens all game, and I even stayed injured after the 10 minute mark. 40 fucking minutes of gens, because I was working through Ruin, but one of my teammates would just run by and blow a skill check, then leave. Granted, this specific example is mainly due to teammates who were not the smartest, but personally, since Legion is really the only killer whose power just slows the game instead of grinding it to a halt, I'd much rather it just stop and end.
---
Realistic (mostly everyone):
---
I mean, the majority of us, realistically, would be running no mither. Most of cant simply shrug off a blade puncturing our bodies at such powerful velocities.
---
Alot of us will be running hope, because you bet your ass ill be running as fast as possible from a killer hurling themselves toward me, you would too, hell, itll probably activate before endgame even starts.
---
Sprint burst for the same reason for hope, but we would be running much farther with such speed (ideally, however some people are simply too non-athletic or disabled and are unfortunately limited with physical movement speed and endurance. I have asthma, so i basically have a permanent exhaustion status effect after sprinting for a little bit lol.)
---
Deja Vu, because all you do is just remember where those loud ass important gens are, simple.
---
boil over, when struggling for your life, im sure itll be much more than you just wiggling as if youre hardly trying at all.(assuming you want to live).
---
personal:
---
Saboteur- because fuck you
---
Wake up - I want out!
---
DS- go away
---
Dead Hard- M  e  t   a  gaming.
---
Well I wonder why they tbagged?
---
All speed boosts have a pre-requisite before you get the boost(devour hope, noed,PWYF) at max level these all give a 5% speed boost (per stack with PWYF). If i were you I'd go for 3/4/5% (per perk level) but make sure to have a pre requisite for the perk to activate.
---
Well there wall of text, let me tell you something
---
Legion is getting a rework after Nurse receives her addon rework.
---
So uhh yeah when I got the peanut allergy thing I stopped I reading
---
DuckDuckGo is a completely different search engine from Google, and it is generally very eager to return porn results when you turn safe search off. In this case, it apparently finds a single video that uses those words in the title.
---
You can make some mean slugging builds with blindness afflictors
---
Would be even better if it hid jigsaw boxes
---
What is it he does with the sabotaged traps
---
Nah, Honestly , im the guy that does 0 gens, but keeps the killer enough to get the team finishing them , xd
---
Nothing, he has to wait for them to respawn
---
It looks like my mom went to his house and gave him a haircut
---
Making the hitboxes more fair would help with a lot of the dcing as well :/
---
I think it's something along the lines of Asians eat household pets
---
u can play with someone at 200 as long as their ping is stable....i for example play around 20/40 ping killers but when their ping spike to 80/100 while chase is not fun
---
If you could, you wouldn't be posting about it and you would keep your focus on the game when getting t-bagged: this is not the case. You lose ton of points because you're not doing anything, barely pip (if at all), and you get 3 other survivors that don't get to have those as well and have a boring game. Very interactive gameplay here.
---
Especially freddy that literally hits me from 10000 meters

[yep](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d3tk4g/im_working_on_a_series_of_illustrations_based_on/f050dmf/)
---
Where's the person running into a wall and another crouching in the open?
---
If this happens to me is just write there name down block them and if I come across them on my alternate account and they loose the game as killer I message them saying wow so you call be bad for being good at the game but your bad and everything gets blamed on me pathetic
---
So did I

"facecamp and then spam leave after the match because you know you did something wrong" is one of my favorites. Always when im ready to pour my salt on them
---
You played hot potato

and lost
---
\*angry spirit noises\*
---
Yes. I never use my treatment in the beginning to find players unless they are just like not doing anything for some reason and hiding, and it pays off. Hook somebody and want to find the one going for the save to stall? That's when I use it a lot.
---
Not being able to heal,dead hard,recover and not being to escape through the gates just in one bug
---
Lmfaoooo
---
When this happens the Entity awakens and it becomes The Mist
---
Because some killers r c*nts and wanna have 4k while survivors in order to get a decent amount of bp they need to actually survive...once again...killers can get an average of 28k (undeserving tbh) each game but survivors can barely get  22k...and thats a fact!
---
If I dare to reply to someone like him using the same kind of thing I get downvotes, I wonder what's the difference 😂
---
That’s why I’m rank 1 meanwhile your playing the same boring gameplay over and over again, typical survivor mains. And don’t try pull the killer bias because I play both and get rank 1 on both. But when you have your first match as killer because it clearly seems to me you haven’t yet, then come and tell me how I’m done my in my games
---
The 'hook lag' bug. Connection would be fine. Then once you got hooked, you were permanently on 1,000+ ping.
---
Yeah as others said, they probably pay a portion to the respective label owners, not sure.
---
Imagine dragons
---
I made this meme myself. I hope you like it.  
---
I don't make memes very often, and I know I'm rather inexperienced with image editing as a whole. If you have any constructive criticism to share, I'm all ears!
---
You're right
---
Yeah possibly - Not 100% how many pips I had before, so can't confirm if it went up or not.
---
I got several angry messages from a meg calling me a camper/tunneller for teleporting as hag. Best part was she was gonna escape but waited at exit gate to click her flashlight, got blood wardened and DCed.
---
All I have to say that if you see the flair it’s suggestion not whining so again idk where your brain is getting to these conclusions that I’m moaning or whining, you decided to reply to me trying to say I’m the problem when you have no idea what your talking about you just assume that I make people tbag then you move on to all this assuming I’m incompetent and all this. Come back when your more educated

I belive its 3 minutes without add ons, and 2 or 1 minute with hangmans trick

I tried to balance it so much that the perk went all the opposite way. Originally it was supposed to boost every action like Resilience, but then I thought it would have been too strong. With hindsight, one of the two downsides should be removed, but... if I remove the Exhausted Status Effect, it doesen't combo anymore with Unlucky Student, and if I remove the other one, the perk makes little sense. It's hard. Maybe I could have increased the % boost that it gives.
---
~~fog~~ flair checks out
---
If they're trying to loop you at walls, it'll help for you to follow them while sticking right on the wall as well. A lot of new killers don't realize that doing that will actually help you chase a lot better since you won't be losing distance at turns and such. Most killers have higher movement speed than survivors but you don't want to lose distance.
---
It also helps you to know the area. When you're passing by things try to get a feel for windows  and pallet placements around the map so when a survivor goes in those areas, you can watch their movement and try to predict whether or not they'll vault the next window or drop the next pallet. If you're close enough also m1 through the pallet or window. Sometimes you'll be able to hit them as they vault or drop a pallet on you if you're in range.
---
If you try to stick on them long enough, you'll get a tier of bloodlust per every 15 seconds that will increase your movement speed.
---
As for gens being done, don't forget to kick gens when you have the chance. If you feel like gens are getting done too fast, definitely look into unlocking stalling perks like Hex: Ruin (most popular one), Pop Goes the Weasel, or Thanatophobia.
---
Killer wise, remember to use their abilities to deny loops. As Trapper, place traps under windows or pallets. Huntress is also good for denying vaults and pallet drops by lobbing a hatchet. Nurse is just S tier in general and if you decide to main her you'll literally be a god if you get good with her.
---
Survivors* think he's balanced, naturally. They want garbage killers to play against
---
This is why it should be not that easy to go somone steam profile in game lmao
---
i really don't think you know enough about the game to be suggesting things.  Prayer Beads wouldn't change anything in a chase since her phase noise is muted anyways within her terror radius.
---
I know this post is nearly a month old, but there is a way around it.
---
Wear brighter clothing.
---
Im a quentin main as well, bit when I play claudette, no one talks shit to me anymore (or atleast less) when i wear something brighter.

---
I thought you F13 was a button on the keyboard at first *facepalms self*
---
All of my yes. This would be equal parts awesome and terrifying
---
I did start him at 20 as we were on his account not mine but for some reason while he was playing killer there’d be like rank 14 survivors that he didn’t know how to combat
---
I value everyone's opinions highly, because I like to find the best solution. And it's because I'm trying to have a genuine discussion at 2:30 am while I, ironically, wait for my dab to kick in so I can sleep.
---
*Goddess*
---
So for Legion we talking 1 on 1 or 4 on 1? Also which one could he beat up easiest?
---
Weapons are also a big advantage. A mistake when fighting someone with a sharp weapon could mean a lethal stab at worst.
---
And the camera work was awesome. The director had been trying to get the rights to make an SH movie for years, and you can tell by how much care was put into so much of the movie. From the monsters, to the camera work mimicking the game's fixed camera angles in key areas, to the awesome soundtrack. Too bad the story was kind of... *meh*
---
That’s What i Call instant karma
---
Beans have to be religious sometimes too you know
---
I'd go for Doctor/Feng. Kate's perks need a buff. Feng had Lithe and Alert, which aren't bad at all.
---
Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU! I love receiving long comments, because it means someone has spent time reading everything and then giving his opinion in the most complete way! 
---
I'm sadly not going to draw him since, well... I just suck at art in general. I would have already done it if that wasn't the case.
---
He's supposed to be the same size as Dwight, long curly hair wrapped up in a ponytail (like Monto lol) and, of course, glasses.
---
I’d say Feng is better but I don’t play either, Ash rules!
---
Touché my friend. Enjoy.
---
Thx
---
I main bubba and i've got 7 pages on my Steam with dozens of survivors hating my whole family tree
---
In the same vain as that, on console I let someone escape and someone messages me saying im cheating and its unfair to chose who escapes and who doesnt
---
Im like wtf im the killer I quite literally have the power to do that lol
---
Thank you, sir. Also, thank you for answering me through all this
---
The amount of monsters and the like they could use for the killer is also equally as exciting!
---
This is dope
---
If the Killers weren't on Entity Steroids sure I could see it.
---
Through all this? Sorry man I don’t take Reddit discussions seriously lmao
---
I’m on controller and I have mine set up to do it with one hand - this is fucked me over one too many times.😅
---
Fengs perks are better than Kates but the Clowns perks are better than Doctors imo. Pop goes the Weasel and Bamboozle are really nice to have but Doctors one aren't bad either.
---
I always thought about this. And not just David, even Bill. I mean Bill is an army veteran, he also fought a bunch of terrifying different types of zombies. They could both beat up any of the legion members, ghostface and Amanda
---
Kate seems really bad,so I think spark of madness it is
---
Fuck
---
My dude, about the thread is just a joke
---
It kinda bothers me when kids like the guy I replied to would make a big deal out of. Which I'm in to do the same, in fact I started with "it's a nice game, I wanna try it too" to show how silly is doing something like that
---
Yeah my replies are pretty spicy, but I'm also a spicy dude.
---
Welp if you wanna try to do that game also let's start with: SAYING "JOKE" ISNT AN EXCUSE. JOKES CARRY MEANINGS AND IDEAS, IF YOU THINK IT DOESN'T YOU ARE RUINING COMEDY.
---
Since this point is been cleared let's start.
---
&gt;Literally what this thread is about
---
Nope, the post is about rules and how silly it can be to make someone play how you like instead for any reason. Taking it to the extreme, yeah, but that's why makes it funny, it's because sometimes happens. In this very sub
---
&gt;This one is kind of jokey
---
So? Hope i cleared the fact that jokes carry meanings and ideas. Usually who have bright clothes are good at chases since they won't be able to hide as much. Since that's what usually happens, he thinks that anyone camps and tunnel such players when usually are themselves prone to be chased for the team. Sometimes even ignored by the killer if they are really good since it's a waste of time.
---
&gt;. I don’t think you understood this one? He’s talked about blocking a hook so a person wiggles out.
---
Yeah I perfectly know that so? He wiggles out but 2 of them are injured which means around 30+s out of the gens which means more time to chase them again and hook them. Idk, maybe you didn't understand what I meant
---
&gt;Another joke
---
As I said jokes carry meanings. If someone makes a joke about beating up his son if founds out he's gay, I will find that joke homophobic, as well as thinking that he carries values of that kind. If someone instead say he would destroy his son if he stole the last chocolate bar I will find it funny since in that joke it carry out an outburst of rage for a trivial matter which is a critic of violent people that get angry for nothing. My dude

If you are gonna link one comment to prove your point I can make any point in existence using the same method you know that right? I hope so
---
&gt;Youre salty about literally playing the objective
---
Talking about something that's broken is being salty about the objective of the game.. are you mental? I never pointed to Survivors for that but bhvr to give more objectives or at least expand the formula, if that's being salty idk what to tell you kid
---
&gt;Tons of posts complaining about people waiting/teabagging at exit gates to take a hit for a friend before leaving
---
Which is different than waiting for your friends. Are 2 totally different scenarios :) in one the player is waiting for a friend that might need an unhook, the other is them teasing another player since they can't be punished for it either way and not leaving even if the match is over just to waste time. Two totally different scenarios
---
&gt;This one doesn’t make a ton of sense
---
I know, he's dumb
---
&gt;“Attachments that dramatically improve an item is only allowed for killers!” See spirit beads, triple blink
---
See insta heals, keys and so on. You have to work around that (except nurse. I agree with her add-ons. They are kinda too much)
---
&gt;Joke
---
Read above
---
Bubba bbq is IMO the best killer perk.
---
Karma. Good karma
---
Yeah I know my dude. In my first comment I also said it was pretty funny, was trying to make sure you won't make a fool of yourself in the future but I liked the content you showed
---
Sure buddy, keep it up
---
It's an asymmetrical game, literally what do you expect? Or conversely, why should the killer be punished for playing intelligently and need to eat a DS/have his time wasted when he already won? 
---
If you're going to bring delusion into this you should probably take a look at your own argument first, because this suggestion is a) complete shit and b) already was in the game and was essentially just a tremendous waste of everyones time for no reason.
---
jesus
---
What is the question ?
---
Always a chance!
---
I can't really do well on pig at high ranks so I like to play her during rank resets. After my first game I got spammed with "trash killer" and "you're so bad". Needless to say some unfortunate souls got to see my nurse at rank 13 for the rest of the day.
---
P3 nurse with the gas mask
---
1 internet point from me
---
I was a baby killer and a squad went sabo and flashlight. Had hooks drop right in front of me when I finally downed someone + flashlight saves. 
---
I reacted pretty badly and ended up tunneling a Feng (the only one I could actually catch), slugging her, then standing over her until she bled out... Every time she would 95 and someone came to pick her up, I would hit her again and she'd go down.
---
At post game lobby was when I found out they weren't a full SFW like I'd assumed, and only the high ranked sabo and flashlight pair were together. I felt pretty bad after.
---
If they camp they wont pip so its cool
---
Hold on to your pips
---
Nice job there, bud!
---
Is it really so fucking hard to crop something?
---
No. Lobbies already take too long, imagine coupling that with people dodging all the time.
---
There's no law saying you can't be an asshole to strangers irl. That doesn't mean it's okay to be an asshole. Really wish people would have more empathy.
---
I personally tend to use the add on which makes the illusion's aura visible, then once I have someone in tier 2 they're sort of permanently marked with tracking, regardless of screams.
---
I also love the one which puts the red stain on them, as it makes it very difficult to lose someone who's in a red spotlight, and you often see it behind corners or around walls. It also cures my corn blindness.
---
Yes its okay. Basically if you can do the action in the game, the devs didnt see it as problem and is therefore fair.
---
Moral rules are not official rules.
---
What if they hit you with a “gg ez” after the game though?
---
&gt;be me

Just dont start the game if u have high ping vs someone

It is good news

Okay but susies weapon is a ruler and a razor
---
Trapper or billy.
---
OoO is known for being a bit of a asshole perk that toxic players use so I can see why they camped. Camping is shitty but camping for absolutely no reason is shittier.
---
For the Legion "Thanatophobia" is a very good choice. You can also try "Pop goes the weasel" or "Overcharge".
---
I find it pathetic to camp someone because of a perk
---
Thiccer than Jane
---
The only “acceptable” ways are not fully trying your best, but only as long as it doesn’t ruin the game for others, and trying to stay out or red ranks because of the queue times.
---
But them being acceptable doesn’t make them not wrong. You won’t learn much by going backwards
---
And that’s when you know it’s time to deliver a pizza ball

What are you talking about? It’s still summer and will be for over a week

Any tips for working with copics and taking photos of art? This looks wickes amazing! But I can never find the perfect way to take a photo of my art so it is clear

Nah, Jason &gt; Virtually any killer in DbD

Well, that's lame, that's so lame that if it was a dinosaur it would be called the lameasaurus rex

All his perks suck

The killer would obviously be ultra instinct shaggy using .0000000000001% of his power
---
Demogorgon :)
---
I always thank survivors for their critiques of my playstyle and it only seems to make them angrier. Last night I wished someone to "have a good night!" after a particularly hateful comment and I got my first friend request!
---
I'd imagine since David and especially Bill have experience with fights they'd know how to disarm a knife from at least legion and ghostface (amanda's is built so shit)
---
Both of you sound like you're a blast at parties.
---
“With every death, comes honor.”
---
When can I wear Quentins ugly mug tho?
---
"With Honor,Redemption"
---
Disarm a knife? Do you know how people use knife in real life? 28 stab wounds is not just a meme xD. You never bet on boxer when maniac with knife which he uses perfectly is against him
---
Wait for the Stranger Things one?
---
Perks are useless for survivors,also it will cost like 5 euros more,so hell no
---
To be honest not really, I'm just assuming David and Bill can do something against them other than you know, just run away like they're completely helpless
---
The insta ruin break and the bad Totem placements left me with never using ruin and not upgrading my hag. Ruin is pointless and I rather use Pop goes the Weasel with three perks of my choice instead of relying on Ruin, gambling that it will delay the game
---
No, I want to do other stuff while I’m on hook. Can’t look out for skill checks :D
---
Yeah, but I can not for the *life of me* find a guide on how to do that.  Only ones for Microsoft mice.
---
I personally went with Claudette first, mostly because I had difficulty finding people to heal me after I'd get injured and escape.
---
Ye, they can try to not run away and die xD. You never mess with a knife, just never.

well deserved for farming Meg off the hook

The reason I don’t use Third Seal is because it gets cleansed before I get any use out of it.

Dwight: where you are maan?
---
Ghostface: Closer than you think.

WAZZUP!

Try with Claudette or Meg

There is the possibility that they were waiting for your DS to run out

I always get an itch when I'm doing a gen and I try and hold it cause a skill check always goes off when I release the gen button

Enslaved THICC
---
Here comes the survivor's rule book.
---
People who complain about this add on are just survivors who tbagged at the exit gates thinking they were smart and then getting moried,this add on is fine.
---
I reserve the right to look for cheeky survivors who are waiting around the corner of the hook for me to leave.
---
Sometimes I'll fake reaching for it. The mind games.
---
I have asthma, and I can say without a doubt that having an asthma attack does not help me do anything.
---
Ok so here's the thing; this is a killer concept, it's not going to be in the game and isn't supposed to be. It's just something to do like testing creativity and can be fun to.
---
Did you play PT? That alone is enough to tell us that Silent Hills would have been a far better game than any of the last few SH games have been
---
When I talk about being toxic for killers usually who I am referring to the people who rage salt in chat after they lose especially when they did those toxic things like camp and tunnel.
---
I see it more with killers than I do with survivors. Not saying survivors don't do that just I see it more with killers. 
---
Just last night 90% of my matches were salty killers even if we lost just us putting GG in the chat got salt. I once had a bubby that mid-match stopped chasing and just went and stood in a corner because he was having a hard time hitting us even when we were not jumping through anything. 
---
He was a streamer so I went there to say GG and ask why he just quit chasing halfway through. When I went and checked out the stream the first thing I hear is him saying these guys are better than me so I am reporting them for unsportsmanlike behavior and reported every person in the match.
---
Your chance was the 5 gens, you failed,
---
You can never be too sure
---
It really is a shame. I would love to like the game, but I dont. Maps are cool and the buildings etc and the campy summer camp wibe, but Jason is a bit too op and the controls are too clunky...
---
HHHHHHHHHHH
---
Why is hungry spelt like the country?
---
I shit you not. I once got accused of "Distance Camping" for hooking, walking away, then coming back and downing a survivor that I caught after they unhooked the other...
---
Distance. Camping.
---
I "camped"... By leaving the area. There's literally no way not to camp anymore.
---
Honestly, this whole situation is similar to that of Animal Crossing New Horizons. When Nintendo announced that they were pushing it back to March of next year everyone lost their shit. I had a 15 minute disagreement with my friend on PlayStation over it being delayed. He said "Its been 5 years since a new installment" meanwhile titles like F-Zero haven't seen a new one in a decade.  
---
If it can be polished by Fall, I don't mind. Rather have something thats delayed and good rather than rushed and released.
---
The irony is Spirit is the best killer to counter OOO
---
I want to say the price for survivors remain the same, but that is an interesting idea for reducing the grind maybe.
---
What's a surviver?
---
Except with the way end game is now and the state of the survivors if I'm solo queue with potatoes or people who DC it can be rough getting 5 gens done. Seems a bit unfair when one person on the team does most of the work then loses by default. Like I said I like end game but it needs tweaked.
---
NOT what i ment
---
Rip people from Siberia.
---
The itch on my nose**
---
That might be it
---
Someone sent me gross nudes over PSN once when I still played console. Can't send porn in steam comments!
---
I actually would have let you down me to see if you can escape by picking up someone
---
For real, well I pray to god who ever will let him join DBD wins lol
---
😂😂😂
---
How many times did the killer see a 4 man SWF and disconnect from lobby?
---
"So you didn't win baby killer... ez go cry"
---
-Survivor anno 2019
---
But rank reset is fun
---
It is
---
It wouldn’t stack
---
I cant get Mori daily for max bp on launch FeelsBadMan.
---
Nope happened to me yesterday too. Does anyone else find when it happens you can't heal yourself, wiggle or dead hard as well? One of those three are usually a sign for me to go hatch hunting lol
---
Ping checks out
---
They stay the same sadly
---
Friday the 13th killed itself in it's confusion!
---
Moris are fine but they should be changed to if the survivor has been hooked twice instead of once since they'd be on their death hook anyway and it wouldn't matter.
---
Yeah, happened to me and a mate a few days ago, also against Ghostface.
---
one match you get gen rushed and regret not bringing ruin, next round you don’t even let them finish one gen and finding out there rank 20s
---
As killer I agree. But not as survivor. Whole different story lol
---
Same problem here. I usually have to wait 3-5 min to finally find a match
---
Use controller on PC I’ll advise you do it since you’re used to it

Usually whenever I go back to a hook as killer and the survivor gets unhooked I try my hardest to go after someone else so I don’t just kill one person straight off the bat and then get called a “Tunneler” when the one off the hook litteraly just follows me around so I down him and hook him again. I don’t understand people
---
I find these perks amazing mate. And it's good to see someone coming up with creative ideas to help the survivor beyond simple dumb aura stuff that barely serves a purpose. 
---
Good thinking outside the box mate
---
Tip: get out of Rank 20
---
Instant Karma
---
Useless? If you dont have iron maiden as a killer main i can say their META
---
This is so me! I bind the repairs key on my keyboard so I have an extra hand for beer.
---
I'd rather wait 1more month than have it now and have a shitty experience
---
When will we get Babysitter Steve tho
---
people like you, the ones who can't even admit to being a shithead
---
Nah, there’s some really nice people out there. I remember giving the hatch to this last survivor bc someone dc’ed and he invited me to his party to thank me and ask if I wanted to do swf.
---
The survivor's only objective is escape. I've gone blue in the face saying this to justify NOED, even if I don't run it, so I guess I need to say it to call out your comment as well. 
---
Key is high-risk, high-reward item. The add-ons for it that aren't "keep it if you die/use it" are mostly unused, and it's really only useful if three or four gens get used (it won't spawn closed until three are done, and at 5 you have the doors). Even at that 3-4 gen mark, I find it makes the survivor with it a LOT more selfish, which means they may get out but makes it a lot easier to kill the other three. It gets it's best use in a SWF, but that's a problem with SWF that runs deeper than keys.
---
What are you talking about,I didnt say anything about useless except for the new survivors,also can you please rephrase?
---
Survivor main with over 2000 hours here.
---
The killer would just down you again.
---
It's prolonging the game.
---
Yeah but spirit is scary to play against. But also annoying.
---
Really awesome! I love the colours.
---
Moist.
---
I mean, I was more saying that for those who neither have asthma nor understand how asthma works.
---
That is true, but Pyramid head appearing in works other than SH2 has been a thing for a while. If they were to ever decide to put Pyramid Head in the game (which will probably never happen) I think it'd be kind of ridiculous to draw a line in the sand *now* and be like, "no we don't want that killer because that's not canon".
---
Is the rope coming out of his pants, his thong?
---
I forgot to thank you! I really appreciated the advice and I've definitely used it. Honestly, it's amazing that people like you are around and take the time out of your day to help others with their questions. Thank you for helping me out! 
---
I wondered if you had any opinion on rancor? I feel like it's not a very good perk, and if anything, detrimental to the killer, since the survivor can see their aura each time a gen is done. If you don't have anything to say about it, don't worry!
---
Did your teammate happen to be a shirtless David  King? :P
---
I understand, I understand, sorry if my reply seemed rude ^^
---
Same.
---
What about the itch? Getting a wireless mouse really helped free up a hand. I can at least hold left click while going for the itch.
---
mmmmmmm
---
Yep, that shit should last a good 5 minutes, minimum.
---
Is that like a console thing or something? I have never seen a ability to disable game chat after the match.
---
I wish the survivors had a perk like bbq and chili, I completely understand why every killer has it, it’s just too hard to pass up double blood points and immediately finding your next target after a hook
---
Only 3
---
That's how my games go when I use gen rush mither
---
Heyyyyyy. r/porn
---
Yep, if you just talk about random stuff or agree with them, they'll get even more angry, since they want you to respond angrily to them aswell. It's best to just not stoop down to their level.
---
Too many times I (or even a streamer I'm watching) will be doing well, but go into second stage on first hook or, in tragic cases, die, because the jake crouch walked all the way to the hook and sat in the bush even though the killer was across the map.  
---
I've had more incompatence from other survivors than troll or tunnel/camping killers
---
is your girlfriend cherry a memer
---
Lmao
---
It's probably the worst killer rn.. why hate them when they suck so much?
---
Finally, someone acknowledges how bs Spirit is
---
Stefano maybe? Power related to his camera?
---
*latency is real
---
Hitboxes are fine
---
I wish I could stick my finger in his belly button...
---
We're Gonna Live Forever needs a fat buff. Survivors earn less bloodpoints as is.
---
Nah. You probably would still miss :) Or get me because you use unrelenting 2
---
May be a shot in the dark, but do you have G-sync or Freesync enabled? If so, try disabling them.
---
My dude, I'm sorry but get better
---
Yeah survivors are a strong role but I suggest you to watch people tutorials and videos. Especially killers gameplay, you can annihilate them since most of the time they are too greedy/fuck up
---
As killer you get punished more for your mistakes while the clock run fast but you have to learn to be a better killer. Play survivor more so you'll understand more their weakness. That's what I do, play both sides and take the good strats they use and note common mistakes
---
Dont buy characters you can get with iridescent shards.
---
i do have GSYNC How come you suggest disabling them?
---
Doctor is the most fun to play AS even tho hes dbd specific,pig is a M1 killer with rng,leatherface is worse hillbilly,legion is M1 killer that's boring,Freddy is ok,so is demogorgon
---
You can never escape the entity.
---
No, I play on PC. Click on the arrow icon &gt;&gt; next to the chatbox and it disables chat until you click it again.
---
I've got a 60k one and a 45k one, still cycling to try get another 45 or 60 though. Takes weeks
---
Lick my finger
---
Which genie? Robin Williams or Will Smith?
---
Doctor was released in first year so he is one of the older killers. 
---
Plague is one of the recent ones which is both original and don't suck ass like legion.
---
This is what I call talent!
---
Outstanding illustration!
---
I had Freesync enabled on my monitor, which caused my game (verified running at ~120 fps) to look like it was running at 30 fps with constant stutters, ruining my gameplay. Lowering the settings or disabling it fixed the problem, it might as well for you.
---
Doctor was a shining light as a killer,so was plague,legion is a mistake,and all licensed suck or are low mid tier
---
You're free to play with a controller on PC, you know.
---
But there's nothing really to say beyond "you'll get used to it." Everyone had to learn the controls eventually. It's just like playing on console for the first time. Just... on PC.
---
Ill give it a go i just disabled GSync then
---
They don't
---
Aah thank you so much ;_; I'm really not that good but I put as much effort and love into every piece as I possibly can
---
That only hides your ability to post something although I don't really think you are being totally honest unless you are getting hate for being toxic in game by DCing as survivor or doing other toxic stuff and being toxic as a killer like tunneling or face camping.
---
My problem with keys is that closing the hatch after its been opened with a key triggers the EGC.
---
I would be more lenient of keys if the hatch automatically closed after the survivor who "opened" it escaped, without triggering an EGC, forcing all four survivors to bring separate keys for "Where Did They Go?" among other things if they want to avoid opening the exit gates.
---
But if there's one generator left and three survivors and one fucker opens the hatch right in front of me, I have to close it, and now instead of sacrificing a survivor who was on death hook (two survivors with one generator remaining to pop) and getting to trigger PGTW on a generator, they can immediately split up one to each gate and start opening them, skipping 20% of their objective.
---
Mori'ing someone removes one hook state, or 8.3% of a Killer objective.
---
Skipping even a single generator because you brought a key is 20% or more, and when you keep in mind that Killers simply don't end chases fast enough to prevent generators from popping already (your "gen rush" meta usually sees 40\~ second solo generators **without** a BNP) because while a survivor spawns near a generator and pops it 40 seconds, the Killer has to patrol all seven and if they don't see someone in 40 seconds (spine chill antics) they get four generators popped immediately.
---
Keys are pretty broken, when the survivor objective is already ridiculously short they shouldn't just skip it en masse because of one key and get to avoid finishing the other generators because of a key.
---
**Imagine it like this**:
---
Survivor team does 60% of their objective and after two people are dead, they find the hatch and escape with a key.
---
Killer does 60% of their objective, rounded up to 7 hooks out of the 12 required for a 4K. They are now allowed to **bring an item** that instantly regresses all generators on the map completely and the other two survivors get instantly downed if they use said &lt;item&gt; on the hatch, guaranteeing the Killer two more kills without any further effort other than finding a closed hatch because they already got 60% of their objective done.
---
That's what a key is like, two survivors skipping the last 40%, a Killer mori doesn't compare - not in chase time vs. generator time, and not in % contribution.
---
If the Killer had an item to instantly sacrifice two random survivors for finding the hatch without any further counterplay, that would be equivalent to a key.
---
Oh alright thank you ! :)
---
I don't think a key-opened hatch should trigger EGC if closed either.
---
I've always found Trapper quite cathartic. Just walk around and put traps down and sometimes feel like a big brain when people step in a trap.
---
Freddy is also strangely calming to play, especially with fake pallets. You don't have to try that hard with Freddy which makes pallet spam and mindless chasing quite relaxing.
---
I also strangely find Huntress very calming to play. It's honestly the humming. As someone more musically inclined the humming does calm me. I'm not good at Huntress though so lol.
---
It definitely wasn't. People stuck with the craphole that was the first year of DBD. Horribly broken game balancing and 4 killers. But you could play it. Playing killer was an absolute nightmare that I'm surprised this game ever got past the first year.
---
&gt;I think I'll just leave it unclaimed just so I never get it again.
---
There is no point doing that - You mayaswell just complete it and if it comes up again you can leave it there/reroll.
---
Especially that bellybutton... and when fingered it can relese on of them soggy plucks of lint! Yay, presents!

---
Back when you could get tons of survivors in a game in the beta (I think I saw like 12 at one time) I wonder how thick the fog would be then. I imagine it would have been like, all super contrasted and glitchy for going past the 5 limit.
---
If you want to determine how the killer plays and uses their powers queue up as killer.
---
Noice
---
More like the one nobody wants.
---
Newer Hag players should be forgiven for mining the area with traps; the better method is to *cover every meaningful path away from the hook with traps*, assuming the survivor will run off in that direction
---
Yea, why did I even bother thinking of trying with you. You're almost never here in good faith. Most of the time you're just combing Reddit, the forums, or the steam forums for shit to complain about on stream or twitter.
---
Bruh I feel like this perk is me IN REAL LIFE
---
For me it’s trapper. You get a good trap layout set up and then just sit back and wait
---
Speaking of salty...
---
I know they get so salty :D
---
I want him to step on my neck and call me a disgrace.
---
What exactly does role of the nightmare do? The way it's phrased sounds like it just cancels everything I've equipped.
---
Are you seeing what I’m seeing?
---
I’ll be entirely honest, I do the same thing. Running OoO in a swf gives the killers location to the entire squad, all the time. Especially if I’m playing a trapper/hag or a stealth killer. 
---
The game gets 10x easier once OoO is out of the game s
---
I agree, it lasts way too long to be considered an “anti tunneling” perk. Like you said you can crank out a generator in that time but the killer could have also hooked another survivor or two and still ds can work. It boggles my mind how they haven’t nerfed it so that it de-activates if the killer hooks someone else or you touch a gen.
---
We always need more memes.
---
What are you seeing?
---
Well if the spark ain’t there anymore maybe move on?
---
On PS4, I set it to square from L1. Some think it’s bad, but I’ve just gotten used to it. I can still look around fine as it’s not like I’m doing skill checks every second. My thumb doesn’t have to go far from my right analog stick to look around to square.
---
Tbh Idk if I should spend my 1M on one character (preferably Nancy for her perks) or split the bloodpoints between both Nancy and Steve.
---
The only thing that kind of "stresses me out" as killer is having to search for survivors for prolonged periods of time, or let alone losing them. So I find Doc, Legion and Wraith relaxing to play, which are easy to find survivors with. Their chaseplay is also fairly barebone while still having an enjoyable amount of complexity to it, but nothing mechanically too demanding that it would get tiresome.
---
Wow you are special
---
You didn’t have to respond but yet you did
---
Why even play killer? You're pretty much just playing like a survivor with a knife.
---
Instead of just assuming a Survivor is toxic because they're using a certain perk and then turning into an ass yourself and camping and tunneling for no good reason, a smart person would just wait and see how the game turns out and play accordingly, i.e. punish shitty behaviour when it happens and not because you think it might happen.
---
Adept Laurie is the hardest Survivor achievement (in my opinion) because people will ruthlessly tunnel you down just because you use a perk they don't like, even if you did nothing wrong.
---
I love this. But where ma boi Joey from Legion?
---
Looping wasn't particularly intended though, chases last far too long compared to generators.
---
Can you really tell me with a straight face that when, without investing in ultra-rares, you can pop a generator in 40 seconds solo every single game you play in without any difficulty or skill beyond hitting Greats (works with Ruin) and expect looping to feel fun or fair?
---
You can hop on a generator and pop it before the Killer finishes a single patrol or spots anyone, and have 80% of the objective done in less than a minute, loops are far too lengthy, there shouldn't be strong window/pallets, especially not 3 or 4 windows and 3 or 4 pallets connected together into one massive multi-minute loop.
---
You honestly could just run in a straight line with an exhaustion perk and still not go down before three generators popped if the other survivors are actually independently repairing.
---
This and the lisa presentation meme/PSA are more annoying to me
---
I did this ages ago. Good times
---
Kate is my favourite character period.
---
Link isn't working :(
---
It's not balanced compared to the need for a Killer to pressure the generators, on the other hand.
---
So accurate it hurts. I can literally call it after every game.
---
I’m probably not gonna do it but I’m curious which streamer it is
---
I mean Plague was nerfed for reason so I believe it
---
She had 4.6 ms while holding her vomit and instead of pulling it back ti 4.4 ms like Doc in treatment she went to 4.2ms
---
IT would be interesting

Thank you! &lt;3 I used gradient first to make the green and black blend together on the base layer, then I used a brush tool to add some green strands going up toward the roots. I added shading and highlights with multiply and shine effects (I use SAI) and used a blend tool a lot for extra softness. \^\^ Although if that doesn't make much sense, I have this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i12rgxUyEDs) existing speedpaint that shows a (messy) version of what I do.

If I remember correctly that is the restraint add-ons, they make people's Aura visible when they pop new tier a few seconds depending on the Rarity.

If you look deep enough into his belly button you can see the next chapter.

They posted another update yesterday. The pushed dedicated servers back to Fall 2019.
---
They did recently increase bloodpoints for survivors. Nearly doubled it in some categories.
---
Daaamn it's 50 now? That's wild lmao
---
Makes sense, thanks :)

well tunneling happens cause the survivor gets spotted immediately again in 8/10 cases

This is so incredible.

---
There is no survivor perk that allows you to 30 second solo a gen. Most survivors can't even hit skill checks no less great checks every time. Takes about 2 minutes per gen per game in my experience with 700 hours in game so far
---
*^^yikes*
---
Well considering Chaos is acting as if playing on Console and playing on PC is the deciding factor of how good players are in DBD and you're acting like a 3 blink nurse ALWAYS goes bad shows me you two are just OH SO FUN in letting OP have his moment. No instead you decide to pick apart the video. Thus bringing me to my conclusion. You're both fun at parties.
---
actually Monto made a video where he didnt use WASD (unless he was carrying to hook) and only blinked to anything (including in the perfect spot in front of a gen to break it lol) and there was still a salty survivor
---
*Who hurt you?*
---
Yummy! My favorite!
---
Thanks mooooom
---
Isn't there a perk that does that exact thing?
---
ToXiC! Just pipe down lad
---
Ghost Face generally requires exploiting how hard he is to reveal, bugs to reveal survivors through walls, and 99ing survivors while camping any hooks you do get in Night Shroud even if it's for the full two minutes.
---
He's not really fun to play as or against, it's just a collection of poorly taped together BS.
---
“Beginners luck”
---
Get a wired connection or better internet is all you can do really.
---
But I just wouldn't worry about it. If you don't have a perfect connection you're going to get people accusing you of lagswitching. If you want to be polite, just focus on playing survivor so that you dont cause any problems as the host.
---
I had a Pig player mori me using Rancor. I didn't realize it was in effect the entire because I was using Object of Obsession.
---
You forgot that they tbagged the killer at the exit gate as well
---
no, your welcome
---
Wtf lmao that's great
---
he probably closed the hatch
---
what?
---
Being this bored I would read messages, I only got 1 death threat and no salty messages usually trying to turn them into positive chats if I am able to.
---
It's 11.99 USD so that's like, 10 pounds?
---
Pretty sure it will be 11.99 in UK.
---
Lol this just raises more questions.
---
Can killers do close the hatch? Is this something new ?
---
Besides why didnt it reopen after my friend escaped ? I was the only remaining survivor,
---
&gt;Survivor team does 60% of their objective
---
If you're going to ignore my post, then I don't know why you'd even reply to me. Like I said earlier, there's one objective for survivors: survive the match. Percentages of that are wonky at best, because one survivor can escape with no gens done (and I won't argue if you say you dislike this, but that's a completely different argument). 
---
To that end, I would argue that a Mori does have as big (if not bigger) an effect. It's hard to quantify percentage-wise how much only downing someone and not needing to hook them after downing them. Sometimes it's as simple as downing them, picking them up and immediately putting them on a hook, but then there's the other extreme of the survivor having DS ready to go and the other three have flashlights and are ready to blind you. What's even harder to quantify is how much impact taking one person out after one hook. I'm of the opinion that it's huge, but it's no cold hard fact. Anecdotally, going from four survivors to three is one of the easiest ways to win. There's a reason that camping and tunneling is so popular, because in terms of effectiveness, it quickly turns games into 3/4ks, even against good SWFs. This doesn't even address how often survivors will give up on first hook if the killer offering that doesn't turn over on the loading screen.
---
All in all, I don't have the stats from BHVR to make any kind of educated statement. I just have anecdotal evidence, which obviously is very biased. That personal experience says I rarely notice as a killer when someone brings a key. Yeah, there are times when more survivors get out than would have if no one had brought or found a key, but they're almost a blip in the games I've played with key gamers. To be honest, I can't say the people who brought a key wouldn't have been just as well off bringing a toolbox. Contrast that with a Mori, which you say isn't as bad, where I can only remember games where it didn't have an impact either because it was a Cypress, or because the killer went out of their way to be nice with it (i.e., only use it when someone is on death hook). I just don't get the comparison, honestly.
---
yes, its something new and triggers the Endgame collapse, a 2 Minute Timer where you can open the doors, or the hatch (only with a key)
---
Yea not dealing with this anymore . I just put the skillcheck binding on my mouse's sidebutton .Now I don't have to have my left hand on the keyboard while I'm doing something else .
---
No picking apart needed. 3 blink nurse is absolutely horrible to go against and broken.
---
Thanks. Still confused about the whole thing i wont lie.
---
Killers can close the hatch now. I guess that's what happened.
---
Rules: -The hatch spawns when the there is one more gen fixed than the survivors alive. Ex if 3 survivors are alive, 4 gens must be fixed.
---
-The hatch spawns and opens when there is one survivor left regardless of gens.
---
-Killer can close the hatch which triggers the end game collapse (EGC), gens are blocked, exit gets are powered and can be opened.
---
For survival? No. For grinding/long-term progress? Absolutely.
---
ye, there is a video on the official Channel explaining it :)
---
'STOP TUNNELING!'
---
Well...maybe stop constantly being the survivor that's the closest to me. I'm not going to stop chasing you because I've already hooked you.
---
Yes! I legit never get sad or mad about them because I know if this was in real life they would never have the balls to cone up to me and say the things they say online haha
---
to practice spend time playing fps browser game for exemple. You'll quickly get the grip
---
Ah thx it's 9.59
---
It's a death timer. If you don't escape before it runs out you die. It activates when an exit is opened, or if the killer closes the hatch.
---
lagswitching is becoming a big issue now, hopefully dedicated servers will fix it
---
But can killer close the hatch when it is opened automatically with 1 remaining survivor ? Or can he/she do that only if you opened it with a key ?
---
* Screenshots highlighting unbalanced matchmaking (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
Any game-delay perk. Thanataphobia or Sloppy Butcher are good choices for Legion specifically. If you have them, there's also Pop Goes the Weasel and Corrupt Intervention. You could try running Dying Light with a Mori, if that's what it comes to. There's also perks that just help you find people doing gens, so you can delay it yourself. There's Discordance, which is especially good for Legion (and everyone, IMO), and also Monitor, Thrilling Tremors, and Whispers.
---
Just hook until second hook and then do it, itll get everyone more BPs
---
Some survivors will never get chosen if you give them all unique abilities
---
No need to question my knowledge of the game. I have around 2k hours. I know it's very little compared to most. I mention prayer beads bc everyone talks so much shit about them. I got attacked on my post bc of prayer beads.
---
They could give more scoring events for survival categories

Nice :)

Clown. He can stop chases incredibly quickly if you have good aim.
---
I once got told to die by cancer just by using nurse’s power
---
Oh no how dare i to use killers power and without it you can literally outrun nurse
---
But in general im a nice killer I awalys give hatch to the last survivor if someone dc’s and even farm when 2 or 3 dcs at the beginning
---
Yep. But didn't you hear? They said she was a top tier killer. With such devs, what is there to expect but doing illogical shit.
---
Same shit, different chapter. Wasn't enough that they nerfed Demo's perks and buffed the survivor's perks - let's go the extra mile and nerf his lunge too. Because apparently he was such a dominating killer that no survivor stood a chance.
---
So what happened?! Did they escape?
---
When someone can actually give a good explanation as to how he could work, maybe we can get him.
---
GENIUS
---
Fucking sucks when that happens but if you managed to down somebody it's literally the best feeling in the world.
---
its why if i get downed and the killer plans to leave me there so the last survivor cant get the hatch ill just leave so the hatch will spawn ruining the killers plan to ruin the fun of everyone else playing
---
I’ve gotten bonkers hits as killer on both P2P and Dedicated Servers, and with killer being host on P2P, I can confirm hitboxes need at least some work, not always the weapons, sometimes the movements. For example, whenever a survivor medium vaults, their hitbox is left behind for about a single second. I can hit people a floor below me if they use a window because of this.
---
Also works with enduring instead of Rancor.
---
Ohh nooooo. This is very popular opinion 
---
I’m the killer main (rank 9) but play as the survivor sometimes.
---
It even helps to play killer later because you can check popular hiding spots.
---
Or just put yourself into a mind of survivor and think: “if I was the survivor where I would hide?”
---
This EGC bug needs some attention.

AHHHH! AFTER 10,000 YEARS I’M FREE! IT’S TO SACRIFICE DWIGHTS!

i won't be surprised, BHVR has an obsession with having 50%+ of their perks be unusable. One of the worst team i've seen at balancing a game.

Unique, but what's stopping another survivor from just helping them or why can't they just get slugged?
---
That was their entire point on why this shouldn’t be done.
---
How would anyone know this exactly? Only the devs would know.
---
OhTofu had the same problem. It might not be possible
---
Oh boohoo!  Shall I play a sad song on the world’s tiniest violin?  You should have defended the hooks.  Instead you chose to let them get unhooks and all get out within 60 seconds of the unhook.  It’s not the perk’s fault people use it.
---
I got once called to die by cancer.
---
I just laughed at it
---
Like seriously what are they gonna accomplish with this?
---
BHVR please hire this man. Perfect rework, +1
---
The clowns lore my dude.
---
That's what I did.
---
No need to get toxic, but oh, you're a survivor main, right? It's okay then I guess.
---
Yes, of course it's not the perks fault people use it. I use it myself.  
---
I just state it how it is: The perk is broken.
---
Eh they promised to not censor any 3rd party titles
---
Get nancy’s perks then level up steve for the hair
---
"Yuck, it's so salty"
---
Wait till you find about rainbow six siege
---
And for honor
---
LOL
---
you know what else counters flashlights, looking at a wall, and baiting the save. Why waste a perk slot to do something you could do without perks.
---
Nurse's calling sucks.
---
That's an even better reason to camp them.
---
Hell ya she’s a beaut of a meme
---
So. How’s your account? I quess untouched
---
I definitely would t say that Legions Mori makes no sense On him. They stab the survivors hand straight through which I’m sure in realistic terms would already cause an immense amount of pain and shock meaning that you’re probably not going to be on top form in a fight
---
Oh fuck that hitbox tho
---
Camping isn't toxic. The goal is to do something in game.
---
Tbagging is toxic. The goal is to communicate with your opponent in a negative manner.
---
thou weren't required to answer the original question and still, you chose to do so

He didn't say they were toxic, he said they were bastards. Flashlight saves are super OP. Good enough of a reason to make sure they go down first.
---
More scoring events in survival, rework WGLF so that it is easier to get stacks, maybe add more ways to gain tokens like e.g. completing a full generator yields a token.
---
Figures. Always seems like impotent rage whenever they whine. Never have a point to anything. It’s like that kid you played basketball with growing up who yelled foul every two seconds when he was behind
---
it's never been a good perk, it's actually terrible
---
In real life, a 22-year-old man broke into the house of a 60-something-year-old man's house with a weapon. The old man beat his ass, restrained him, and called the cops. He did this using skills that he learned while serving in the military. It isn't unrealistic to believe that Bill, a man with nothing to lose, could beat a teen with a knife.
---
Protip: assign skillchecks to middle mousebutton
---
Devour should be in fun but inefficient perks
---
I changed my skill check button to a side mouse button, now I’m able to do gens with 1 hand ;)
---
You need a mouse that has programmable buttons.  
---
Then you can use the mouse software to bind your skill check key to the mouse button.
---
Did it work? Looking to get a gysnc monitor and might hold off if it causes stuttering in my fave game
---
Make sure your mouse sensitivity is calibrated properly. Once you find a mouse setting that works for you, NEVER change it unless you start to encounter issues with how fast or slow the mouse is turning.
---
You should try to aim for a mouse sensitivity that never causes you to overshoot or undershoot what you're trying to aim at.
---
Additionally, disable mouse acceleration/ mouse smoothing in your mouse settings on your PC. Not in the game, though, in your PC's native mouse settings. This will cause your mouse to only accept the raw inputs of your mouse, and won't try to predict or smooth out your mouse movements. This helps with control a LOT and just makes using your mouse more intuitive, since you won't have a mouse sensitivity that is actively changing slightly based on how fast you're moving it. It will always stay the same.
---
In terms of moving your mouse to look at the Killer, it's good to practice moving your character in the same direction you're moving your mouse. 
---
If you need to look behind yourself: As you turn your mouse in the direction you're looking, quickly transition to holding S and either A or D based on the direction you're looking. If you're looking to the right, hold A, and to the left, hold D. This well help you stay on target for the direction you're running. Generally never keep the killer directly in the center of your screen to do this, you'll be able to keep the killer on track on the side of your screen while making it easy to transition back to looking forwards again. It also helps you keep track of what you're possibly running into. Other than that, practice makes perfect with your movement, and if you every wanna play with me to practice a bit we totally can! Just PM me! c:
---
It seems the most common power of these is a mid tier perk level, so let’s point out the outliers
---
Dwight - His is too weak, by a lot. It’s just worse Claudette. Was this supposed to be COOPERATIVE? Not altruistic?
---
Bill - This is absolutely busted.
---
Ace - This is bad. Mainly because luck is bad.
---
Feng - Terrible. Both terrible in effect, and terrible in the number. If it’s gonna be technician based, make it reduce noise, not skill check hides. After all, are prestige people gonna be blowing gens left and right?
---
Kate - Just weaker lightweight
---
Adam - Any really strong gen speed boost is hectic. Especially when this man has deliverance.
---
Ash - This is mad strong
---
Steve - Good but will almost never happen outside of SWF. Solo could also mess up a time wasting opportunity against a camper.
---
Nancy - No.
---
Hillbilly - Worse enduring
---
Wraith - Blood hound or Predator would be more useful. Sloppy is used for time, not blood
---
Nurse - Worse stridor
---
Shape - Terrible
---
Cannibal - Worse iron grasp.
---
Huntress - Bloodlusting IMO shouldn’t be encouraged, as it’s skill-less. Also this encourages long chases when she’s a ranged killer.
---
Hag - Useless to good players.
---
Doctor - Should increase FOV too.
---
Nightmare - Fire Up buff lookin nice
---
Pig - Traps are effected by luck. Bad effect.
---
Spirit - I have no clue how this would work or how strong it is. Probably strong
---
Legion - Person is already one hit down. This isn’t useful
---
Ghostface - Niche but RIP the obsession, nothing much they can do. Also, how would this trigger effectively? With how inconsistent chases are I don’t see it working.
---
Demogorgon - Not related to them in any way, and also devastating to balance and new concepts
---
How can host ha e someone else’s latency? They were, as killer, visibly away but got hit.
---
I just play with max sensitivity.  180s are much slower,  but you can still turn and get the hit sometimes.  Is there no aim assist on ps4?
---
I’ve had similar happen to me on xbox. By the way, you meant to use vein, not vain. Sorry in advance lol
---
I never get anything like this :(
---
Yea I think so
---
I mean, he was probably waiting out DS
---
It seems like a lot of those types may be the product of some killers being too nice. Like it creates an expectation of a one-way gentleman’s agreement.
---
Team Silent is dead, Silent Hill is reduced to pachinko machines. I kinda don’t want Konami to get more money for him. He had a special, awful place in SH2 and I wish people would respect that is all.
---
If survivors had abilities Claudette and Meg would actually be the only survivors anybody picked with that healing and exhaustion buff. 
---
I'm glad Survivors are only skins, atm. I at least see a variety of characters.
---
From what I understand, yes, for some reason you have to decrease it then increase it. I have no idea why. 
---
I should actually do a proper test on this and look at the comparisons because to be fair I saw this posted by someone else who was also testing the mist and found the decrease/increase way to get the true maximum amount. I've never compared side-by-side shots in game to see if it actually works though. I saw this a few months back by someone who had posted some screenshots etc so I assume with all the effort they went into checking the mist stacking that it's true.
---
i think you aren´t using this template correctly
---
You don’t need competent teammates to rank up so just play well and rank up then you don’t have to play with them anymore
---
Nice list, one thing though, noed needs to be top tier
---
1) that's not how ths tank reset works. You drop to a certain rank depending on what rank you are. Example, a Rank 1 will always drop to a rank 10 with two pips. See here for more info. https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rank
---
2) Devs have already recognized this and have plans to rework the ranking system, as can be seen on their year 4 road map, an image of which can be seen here. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vgr.com/dead-by-daylight-year-4-content-plans/amp/
---
Any rank reset in any game will never be perfect, but its kind of necessary. It condenses the population so more people can play, as queue times get longer the higher rank you are. It also creates a sense of progression. Is it perfect, no, but neither is any ranking system.
---
Personally, I like the ranking system because it rewards me for playing the game, not just winning. As a survivor, I don't have to get out of the game every match to rank up and progress. As long as I'm doing what I need to do, working on gens, healing teammates, avoiding the killer, then I will progress. As a killer, I don't need a 4k every time to progress. I hope going forward, Behavior keeps that in mind as they rework ranks and rank resets.
---
Dark Devotion is actually imo Legion’s best perk, or anything hit based really
---
I don’t know what to say
---
Holy shit that's brilliant.
---
True you right But then I thought you know what?
---
Screw the rules I have a chainsaw!
---
Tunneling is not even a real thing ffs
---
Sorry :(
---
I’d definitely put whispers up to great perks. It’s better than ‘good’. Fantastic early and late game, while being great mid game. + it’s amazing with some killers (eg ghostface)
---
One character is better. You’ll at least get to 35 for the one.
---
They just said sometime in fall.
---
This rework isn't meant to make her better, that's the point. I just think being able to blink at anytime and get free downs by ignoring every game mechanic is a little absurd, so that's why I would give the power a cooldown and give Nurse 110% movement speed like the Spirit, so that she can't blink anytime she wants but still have a faster movement speed than a survivor to have the potential to down them during the time that she can't blink. I agree that certain addons that are really strong do need some drastic changes, which is why I thought I'd list all the addons to show which ones I would change. Thx 4 the feedback :)
---
But Myers has some of the best/most OP add ons in the game...
---
&gt; could beat a teen with a knife
---
Legion not a thief teen's. Ghostface not a thief teen. Amanda was using chloroform and and other stuff to get them into The Game. For unexpected stuff she had a pistol i remember. They are professional killers, they are not drunk man with a kitchen knife who will fell out if his own breath
---
I agree, i don't remember the last time a survivor successfully flashed me. Way too situational.

Important question
---
Rip :(
---
If we're playing that card, all DbD originated killers have protection from the entity. Without it, Spirit dies, Plague dies, Hag dies, Legion starves to death, and Nurse starves to death or bleeds out. All human killers would eventually die from old age. The non-humans would've been dead.
---
With the asthma inhaler induced scream of rage!
---
I disagree a lot with Thrill of the hunt's rank. As a high mobility Killer like Billy, and combined with ruins, its a pretty solid perk imo. It helps guarantee ruins at least last time and doesn't get insta cleansed. It does lose some value vs a good SWF team tho. Some of the perks you put above it are nearless useless.
---
They've put DBD in the "Featured" Tab of the eShop before when you were able to preorder it, so they do know that the game is popular and they have advertised it in directs before. Not entirely sure how the Featured tab works, but I'm pretty sure it isn't made specifically for you but is the same to everyone, so I don't see why they would remove DBD if they've already talked about it to this extent.
---
Personally not a fan of it, but a lot of really high tier killers swear by it. Minimally at least a "great" perk.
---
I swear all i get on rank reset is god tier killers and rank 15 megs and claudettes
---
I do like seeing those posts about an additional object, because for longevity of the game holding M1 is not terribly exciting so adding an addition objective is a solid idea for addressing the same problem, the only issue there is that a while new element in the game like that may be jarring (not a legitimate complaint but something developers do consider) and of course it doesn't change the lack of perk diversity and the swingy-ness of how fast the Ruin totem is found. That being said I love the idea and I'm not sure that there is a perfect solution.
---
I'm sure this has been reported already but on PC when someone with Prove Thyself dies everyone gets the perk symbol displayed like that person is next to them, even if they're dead
---
Did you have a stroke
---
My fingers are about as graceful as a hurricane
---
Amazing
---
Leatherface isn’t good himself but his perk BBQ and chili is fantastic for getting up to 100% all bloodpoints multiplied. The way it works is you get a “stack” each time you book a new survivor for the first time, up to four stacks. Each stack is 25% multiplier for bloodpoints and its up to 100% in tier three. So if you earn a baseline 25K in the match, you get 50K + any offerings you had or by equipping distressing which adds 100% deviousness bonus too.
---
I hope they just change some her addons and then leave her alone
---
I planning to buy him just for that perk
---
Less annoying than people who use emojis.
---
Not anymore. Enduring only affects pallet stuns now.
---
“Ruins”
---
Is this some kind of cruel limits thing, wherein it was named ruins but became ruin
---
This but unironically
---
you calling franklin's ineffective? i will not take this slander
---
You can take my upvote
---
Literally all of the Legion members are teens. Frank is the oldest at 19. None of the ages of the others are stated, but Legion's bio says that Frank went to Julie's parties where everyone was younger than him. That is proof that can be found in the bio meaning you are wrong. Legion is just 4 teens with a knife each except for Susie. She has 2 sharpened rulers. Ghostface may not be a teen with a knife, but he is still just a dude with a knife. He is faster than Legion but he is also scrawnier which would make him easier to dispatch.
---
Send links.  Don’t sweat looking for Tru3’s, though.  I stopped taking him seriously after he started complaining about Dead Hard and said Windows of Opportunity was a godlike perk.  Send a clip of Otzdarva unironically complaining about DS.
---
It is a relatively common bug where the survivor can't register hit detection with the escape wall.
---
Play how you want to play. Don't let those assholes dictate how you play killer.
---
Completely agree. But I am a fan, did wonders when I Mained huntress
---
tell the story please
---
YES
---
Too bad rancor was made for a outdated perk
---
I think the issue is more that there are certain killers who have no map traversal and nothing in their kit to end a chase faster so if you aren't running Ruin it feels a little fast. I'm more interested in Perk diversity than I am in extending gen time exclusively
---
While I can't argue against that, sometimes we like to change the pace a little hide in dark corners too.
---
Enduring allows you to be aggressive with no back lash, swing through every pallet to make the survivor scared so they'll waste pallets. Brutal strength is abysmal, it's effect to too small to be useful in my opinion
---
I make the bloodpoints up by running my spirit main amulet/necklace survivor pudding, been getting perfect games with her quite a bit lately I think I’m up to 12 or 13. Banks 100k bp every time.
---
Well it force them to only start working on it while i'm in a chase, which is already a plus.
---
Depending on a few factor, i might give up my current chase or not (how soon i think i can get my down, how far ruins is, how well open the field is, etc). 
---
But overall i find it far more usefull than Iron grasp for sure.
---
Finally a skin I can get behind
---
I don’t blame him E Mori are the worst thing in the game at the moment
---
It serves no purpose but to counter "items" which the survivors could just pick back up when out of chase. I've gone against people using franklins even though only one person brought an item. It's practically useless but it counters flashlights by a very slight amount.
---
&gt;Windows of Opportunity was a godlike perk
---
Never seen him say that. Are you going to send links yourself for that?
---
&gt; complaining about Dead Hard 
---
Never saw that either. Everytime I watch him he says it's the best exhaustion perk if used correctly.
---
&gt; Send a clip of Otzdarva unironically complaining about DS. 
---
When he's done streaming, watch his VoD of todays stream, because he just said it like \~2 hrs ago. :)  
---
He said it's a perk, which is too strong because it has 0 counter play involved.  
---
I personally would define this as "broken".
---
If you got three uses off with 4 gens left sounds like it ran its course pretty well
---
Rules for killers made by survivors #3492
---
I only don’t “tunnel” cause it gives me more blood points. Plus it’s less fun then going after different people. But yeah all people should be allowed to play how they want to play. Unless they’re being actually toxic and writing hate stuff
---
Rangers, summon the lockerzord
---
&gt; it doesn't change the lack of perk diversity and the swingy-ness of how fast the Ruin totem is found. That being said I love the idea and I'm not sure that there is a perfect solution.
---
Never said i am against your ruin nerf suggestion. its a good idea too.
---
Just don’t farm nerd
---
Ruin is a pseudo counter to doing gens. I almost never go out of my way to find ruin anymore. If you just sit there and do the gen you will complete it. It might take slightly longer, but not by that much. Increasing the frequency of skill checks or gen completion time wont solve the issue. There needs to be more objectives or other things to extend the matches.
---
If I was I’m so sorry
---
Ok, let me answer a few questions
---
Dwight. Yes, I meant cooperative
---
Bill. Could be nerfed to 1.5/3/4.5/6
---
Ace. Yeah, I see your point. I have since seen another post and it could honestly be a good ace ‘stat’ (don’t know what to call them) so I changed it a little and yeah. Not taking credit for it
---
For every 5 seconds the killer is within 4/6/8/10 meters from you while on the hook in first state, gain 5% chance of getting off the hook by yourself. If it succeeds, have the endurance status effect for 15 seconds
---
Feng. Yeah, honestly looking back I thought of it as a new player stat but now that you mentioned that most prestige 3s aren’t new is probably a good reason to change
---
Kate. I just used that for Kate because I honestly don’t know what she would have. I thought how dance with me and windows of opertunity can be used to escape I thought it could be useful. If you have a suggestion let me know
---
Adam. How about 3/6/9/12%? Considering you have a negative status effect I think it’s fair but open to changes
---
Ash. Yeah, it is. In my head I thought of times when I knew it wasn’t a tunneling killer and I had BT and there was a hooked survivor next to me I would take a hit, save, then get downed. The timer could definitely be reduced to like, 10/12/14/16 maybe? As I said before open to suggestions
---
Steve. Yeah, I guess but a random could waste anything from god pallet to saving someone right before you do and they don’t have BT but you do and the killer is right there
---
Nancy. In my head it was meant to be a buff to were if you did objectives and were chased you could get rewarded but yeah I see your point
---
I will just knock out all the ‘worse than this perk’ because that was the idea, it’s a way of being able to include another perk slot. 
---
Shape. It is meant to punish a survivor who has done nothing for the team the whole game. And it also fits with the whole “leave the obsession until everyone else is dead theme he has. I guess it could also count down for chase time
---
Huntress. I guess, what other idea for huntress do you have?
---
Hag. Yeah, just didn’t know what else. Again, open to ideas
---
Doctor. Fair enough
---
Freddy. Can’t tell if your being sarcastic there
---
Pig. Honestly, the traps shouldn’t be rng. If they remove rng from trap then I think it could be good
---
Spirit. Basically, if you hit a survivor after exiting your phase walk then they are deafened. Which means they can’t hear your phase walk sfx o heartbeat.
---
Legion. I see your point again, open to suggestions
---
Ghost face. They way it works is as long as your still in a chase with them you get the buffs. So if they are with someone else, and you start a chase with both, you get the buffs until you get the chase points from them
---
DemGorgon. I feel like I have said this more than once but I didn’t have another real idea for him, I thought that because Steve and Nancy’s were about being on the hook longer the Demi should be being on it less. But I see your point. Open to suggestions
---
I hope that answered a few questions and I will make some changes to balance it out more
---
You need to level him up now.
---
But don’t mori do the same but better?
---
Sweet! In general the “best” perks that are pretty well used and work well for just about all killers are a combo of ruin, BBQ, pop goes the weasel, monitor and abuse,  nurses, enduring, spirit fury (combine with enduring if using), and sloppy butcher. Also people rely on no one escapes death if you don’t have ruin and worry about being gen rushed
---
Amen!
---
Nurse is unstoppable in the right hands. Good luck mastering her :)
---
Alright thanks
---
The game force you to end every chases really fast which isn't really fun for either sides...
---
Prayer beads spirit
---
Yup. Not all but most asym games are like that. The "power role" is oppressively strong when players aren't good - regardless of the power role player's skill - and once every is close to optimized (this can scale depending on skill on both sides) the team is way, way stronger.
---
if you do not have it unlocked on one of the characters yes you need bill
---
I just view them as trophies
---
So close yet so far
---
I understand completely, but where you raged in a situation like that I laughed my ass off. My group was similar to yours, but those kinds of things you don’t see often and will 90% of the time be unprepared for. Best to just laugh it off!
---
I think Killers should be around Freddy/Huntress/Hag/Myers strength. So yes they need a buff.
---
How did the match go?
---
Not when used for irony’s sake.
---
PS4
---
Medic and Wounded Healer trophies are bugged and are unattainable or they require many more then specified.
---
Well good news is you picked some of the best killers to get teachable from. I'll just list who has what and let you figure it out from there:
---
Wraith: Shadowborn/Bloodhound: Both solid tracking perks, but if you dont lose survivors easily not really worth a perk slot.
---
Predator: It can actually make scratch marks harder to see if they get enough distance on you, avoid this.
---
Hag:
---
Hex freakin ruin: A staple in majority of killer build for how well it slows down a game. It's not a "must have" like BBQ but it is an incredibly potent perk. Peopel swap it with pop goes the weasel deepening on killer choice.
---
Devour hope:  fun perk more than anything. It is either destroyed in the first 10 seconds or you get a 4K mori, there is no in between (never run with another hex perk)
---
Third Seal; Basically useless outside fringe meme builds
---
Myers:
---
Save the Best for last: amazing on any M1 killer, not a "must have" like ruin  or BBQ but still a very, very good perk.
---
PWYF/Dying Light: Completely useless unless you tunnel someone to death/play Myers tombstone
---
Doc: Monitor and Buse on Pig is actually amazing im told. Combine it with whispers when going up to a generator and you'll know about survivors before they hear your terror radius so you can ambush more easily.
---
Overcharge: Obliterates low rank survivors, useless higher ranks
---
Overhwleming: Ignore this
---
Huntress: Beast of prey is better for farming hunting points than TOTH since it cant be blown up. As a perk itself its not TERRIBLE, but its still meh.
---
Territorial and lullaby are outclassed/ just bad in comparison to other perks
---
Freddy
---
Blood Warden is the ultimate fuck you to survivors. Its not exactly meta, but if used right can nail a few extra kills. its a fun perk more than anything
---
Bremen me: Since the nerf I dont see anyone running this, dont recommend
---
Fire up: Its alright, not bad not great
---
Clown:
---
Bamboozle is solid if you hate long vault loops, but its not a must have
---
Pop goes the weasel: This is am awesome perk, a 25% regression doesnt sound like much. But if you down people enough you can make a gen go from 90% to 0. I liek it WAY more than ruin since its not RnG reliant, but its personal. A good perk
---
Caulrophobia: Trash
---
Legion:
---
Discordance: Fills the same role of surveilance kind of, its interchangble. Solid perk, but not needed
---
Mad grit: MEME builds are fun, not the best
---
Iron Maiden: Fun on huntress, meh on everyone else
---
Plague
---
Honestly, I dont have enough experience with her to give you an honest answer.
---
Ghostface
---
I'm all ears: Cna bea mind gaming perk in chases, but its long cooldown hurts it. Personal perk I like, but not amazing
---
Furtive chase: Absolute garbage dont touch it
---
Thrilling tremors: I've never used it, so I cant say yes or no to it
---
I don’t. It was a more... hypothetical meme.
---
Like the idea but the last perk would seem a bit overpowered. But overall creative.
---
The time saved by brutal strength is negligible compared to an enduring stun most of the time.
---
What do you mean camped 3 gens
---
Those perks are busted.
---
Your an idiot that argument gets thrown out the window when you can say the exact same thing for the other side right and second so I’m supposed to leave them on the hook to die because the hilllbilly wants to sprint across the map? And killers like you wonder why borrowed time or DS exist
---
Never, they will always be garbage
---
“You”
---
Feel like his perks are overpowered in general
---
Mine was this swf invited me to talk to them, after I had killed two. One was hiding near the hatch, the other was farming bp with me. In the end I just wanted bp and found the camping one and waited about two minutes for the last guy to find the hatch, then killed him because y not
---
[Something something DLC guide.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1547234731)
---
For Killer my absolute strongest recommendation is to fork over $5 in order to buy the "Killer expansion pass" of the Leatherface DLC. Barbeque and Chili as well as Franklin's Demise are two incredibly powerful perks, and Leatherface is a very simplistic Killer who's good to learn the game with.
---
Other than that my best recommendation for free characters to learn would be Hillbilly, as he's very straightforward and has good perk~~s (Enduring)~~
---
The unfortunate truth is that a lot of the good Killer perks are tied to harder Killers. Ruin comes with Hag and Nurse's Calling comes with Nurse, but you can honestly get by as a new player with Sloppy Butcher and NOED (if you don't mind getting flamed for using a perk.)

You kinda completely missed their point. What they're trying to say, which is completely true, is that she would be even worse to play against, even more annoying
---
I have Bill and all other survivors level 50 Prestige 3 and every perk. I wonder how that will affect Steve &amp; Nancy when they come out? I never had Bills perks turn orange as teachable on my Bloodweb.
---
You are obviously the one who farms ur mates in front of the killer.Language mate
---
If by patrolling you mean checking the nearest gen and going back over and over again then you're still camping
---
steve*
---
Yeah, I agree with you. Especially the last one, that and furtive chase would be way too good on weaker killers. I was having a hard time thinking about perks.
---
oh yeah its all coming together
---
Survivor just scales better. Their perks are stronger when used by better players, and they can be stacked (facing 4 adrenaline/ds/dead hard is SUPER fun)  
---
Survivors also scale massively because they can communicate, and will do more at higher ranks. Communication between survivors is so massive its ridiculous, play a game with a survivor in comms and its literally a different game
---
Hell yeah bro FLEX!!
---
How is whisper so low? Its one of the strongest perks in the game, I'd even argue its better than BBQ if you dont care about blood points.
---
Lmao this dude hasn't lit the bonfire yet.
---
Yeah lol, like I said in a previous comment I was having a hard time coming up with interesting perks although I think IT'S ME can be totally countered with something like spine chill and/or resilience.
---
was on a hurry ment mike but ok
---
Interesting! What made you decide on this as a tattoo?
---
thanks!
---
warning this video is really bad and outdated. waste your time at your own risk
---
and thats the point
---
You are a good man. Thank you
---
I need to clean my eyes after reading this
---
Yeah that's true, but like you said a robot killer isn't far-fetched especially now considering the Demogorgon.
---
In case of SWF always go for the person who is unhooked. They both are equally guilty of farming. If not, you just created rift between them, divided they fall!
---
Where’s Ghostface’s perks?
---
*me trying to peel and eat an orange*
---
*me trying to fix my hair*
---
*me trying hit the bong*
---
*me trying to pat my pupper*
---
Like people like you who DC just because you're an entitled fk that judge others by their nationality. You are disgusting.
---
Before judging others look at the mirror
---
The numbers could do with a bit of tweaking if implemented, but, honestly, a pretty damn solid concept. Nice job!
---
You definitely did or they’d continue to pop up at every level. Open character info page and look for the check marks beside the unique perk descriptions to confirm.
---
Sadly that pretty much sums up the community at times.You either have people who are nice and chill or people who are toxic as hell and try to ruin the game for everyone else
---
That's the point. It's a shit strategy that you rarely win with. And only makes the game boring and shit for everyone else. 
---
I don't doubt you suck.
---
I thought it was obvious but I'll explain it to you.  
---
His youtube titles are 100% clickbait.  
---
And coming to his stream ... This dude streams like 5-6 hrs every day.  
---
If you keep this up for years you'll be able to pinpoint few words and sentences and say stuff like:  
---
"See?! He's wrong here! Wtf!"   
---
It's normal. It's human.  
---
And like I said, after seeing a killer, perk or item in action he'll adjust his viewpoint.  
---
I've seen him talk to people where he good arguments would convince him.  
---
&gt; then reverting to it’s bad after others gave their opinions? 
---
Well tbh he's changing his opinions himself.  
---
If something is completely new and people ask him if it's strong or not, he'll be wrong sometimes because it's his first impression. After a day or two he's usually more confident and knows what he's talking about.  
---
I thought this was obvious, though.
---
And like I said, just watch Otz' VoD of today. I won't take 3hrs of my time to find him saying that. If it's important to you, go ahead. Should be do-able since it's just one stream, isn't it?  
---
Some guy in chat asked him how one could counter DS and Otz replied with:  
---
"Well ... there is 0 counter play to DS. You can't do anything against it."  
---
Then someone else said: "It's an anti tunnel perk."  
---
And Otz replied with something like:  
---
"Anti tunnel perk? Lets see you chase down the last survivor, down him, until DS hits you and he escapes. It's more than just that."
---
BrickyOrchid made a [video on Dead by Daylight's balance](https://youtu.be/Axy2RP_Xvd0) awhile back and it's honestly still pretty accurate. The analogy he made about quickscoping is a sentiment shared by a lot of content creators ~~(as much as I hate him this is a point that TydeTyme has brought up before that I agree with)~~ on the state of Dead by Daylight's balance.
---
In short the Killer role is based entirely on Survivors making mistakes for the Killer to capitalize on. As a result the Killer has very little agency against the Survivors, if any. As Survivors get better and better they make less and less mistakes which makes it harder and harder for Killers to get Kills. And while the Killers may be able to capitalize on mistakes better there's still far less opportunity for them to do so against experienced players.
---
How you be puttin freddy in D tier hes SSS boy
---
I would say it was just bad internet
---
Thxs, i will check again.
---
Our EMPRESS
---
Depends on what you're patrolling, coming back to the hook every 5 seconds is camping. It isn't facecamping but it is still camping.
---
Before people call me a tilted survivor main, I'm not saying it's a bad or good thing, or even arguing how valid/invalid of a strat it is, but it is camping.
---
Been posting this for weeks. Hopefully yours gets some attention.
---
I keep getting fucked, everytime I try to keep my rituals it cashes them in anyway for some reason and its pissing me off.
---
Those are also two good add ons but I only think that prayer beads needs to be nerfed. I was just saying that Myers has some of the best add ons and it doesn’t make sense to not include his with the others.
---
Any Myers skin at this point pls
---
I thought so at first.. But his ping was great at the start of the match.. But it only did that when the killer chased
---
I have the game set to play one handed.  I honestly don’t get why more people don’t do this.
---
I don’t hook dive don’t need to I’m the fucker who does the gens and you don’t see for most of the game
---
I would change the movement speed to 110% since I would give the blinks a cooldown. I didn't want to completely butcher the Nurse's ability to end chases really fast when I thought of this rework, I just find it a little dumb that the Nurse in present day can blink to a survivor anytime she wants to and get free downs which basically ignore a big game mechanic, especially if she uses Infectious Fright and slugs everyone. So I came up with the idea to add a cooldown to the blinks, it would still give her great chase potential, but it would limit her as to when to use it, kind of like the Spirit.
---
Fair enough, but it's still really annoying to play around
---
I main hag, and putting that many traps near the hook is literally the worse way to play her. You should be using your traps for loops, not for basically camping the hook. One trap is enough to force survivors to still waste time crouching for the unhook.
---
You are right, you can't win games and get out all the time. But that's the point I'm trying to make, you still rank up and get rewarded for doing what you are supposed to do. Yes having good teammates helps you win games and it is definitely impossible to win games without good teammates, but it's not necessary to rank up, which is the only point I am trying to make.
---
All you should need is 1 trap most of the time, sometimes a second for a bit farther from the hook where people will usually come from. I'd rather keep my other 8 traps on loops near gens and gens themselves just so I have that edge instead of half my traps on one survivor.
---
None of his perks are even good except the obsession one and that's entirely dependent on what build you're running with it
---
Not sure why the downvote...
---
He made the point that if you unhook your teammate right after he puts him on the hook, it’s an easy kill and he doesn’t have to let him go because that’s his job as killer. I think you misunderstood his argument.
---
Then i cant see ur problem.
---
 I am a simple DbD player
---
I see Otz, I upvote
---
Maybe when people understand what latency / ping means. Only then, people will stop bitching about hitboxes because they are fine for the most part.
---
Surviviors rank reset is the best. You get to play with cute baby trappers and frosty eye billy
---
Pls dont do that, it really unfun
---
I mean if you place more than 1 or 2, at that point you're just wasting traps, the survivors only need to trigger 1 for you to come back and spending half your traps in one area really diminishes Hag's potential map pressure if you have them all clustered in 1 spot.
---
Playing smart of strategic is a big no-no around these parts. Even if there are only 3 gens up you better not patrol them quick and efficiently, you need to go wandering off in to a random corner or else you're toxic.
---
If you already have most perks there is a big chance you will get the same perk. There is nothing wrong.
---
I've only been playing  a short while, so I've been using this sub and YouTube for tips and stuff.  I can see why other places call this sub a joke, it's like 90% memes and shitposts.  I've still managed to find some good info here, but you have to wade through so much dumb shit to find it.
---
I don’t you or him understood my argument my entire point is there are killers that will go across the map to secure a kill it doesn’t matter if it’s useful or not because people still do that also don’t you think it’s time to update perks like dying light and rancor that encourages tunneling I’m not talking about the situations that are SWF or survivors being point thirsty I’m talking about the other situation
---
So the power is just the pig?
---
Laughs in PC.
---
As long as you play the objectives you will rank up. I play solo and I'm pretty much back to red ranks. Just play your best and you should climb regardless of your teammates.
---
That's hilarious
---
The new killer from Strange Things
---
Oof.
---
I'm a dumbass for never thinking to stack up three rituals like that.
---
Just because I’m not affected doesn’t mean the rest of the community isn’t affected that’s like saying since I play trapper and ruin I’m not affected by the gens being done too fast or since I run no mother (which I don’t) I’m not affected by NOED
---
Yeah...meaning she isn't 18.
---
Well the objective of the killer is to kill, so i guess camping and tunneling is ok?
---
Can you really blame a killer for investigating a visual/audio notification?
---
Jason can down *8* counselors who have bats, machetes, shotguns, can communicate with each other, and can repair cars with ease.
---
Our killers struggle facing a piece of wood.
---
This is circumstantial. If I've hooked someone and I can see scratchmarks/blood/hear the survivor nearby, I'm not necessarily going to travel halfway across the map to go after someone else, especially if it's a toxic team/all the gens are done already and the gate's either open or on 99%. Patrolling also gives survivors a good opportunity to rescue each other safely, even without taking a hit.
---
Play station already has that, and has had it since ps2
---
It's great! I like the position of his feet, it makes him look more 3 dimensional. Nice work :)
---
what? How is it like the Pig? Because of the sort of ambush mechanic. If anything, I wanted him to play more like Ghost Face and Demogorgon.
---
Why would add his point to mine because these are two different issues that need to be addressed separately
---
What's this "maybe" stuff?
---
Lol you should have put the franklins demise icon next to the ebony since he dropped it
---
yeah. these are the games that i disconnect from. i hate farming games. not fun in the slightest
---
.foO
---
What's wrong?
---
Crosspost this to /r/StrangerThings , theyll love it!
---
Thank you very much
---
This
---
Fucking this. 
---
Hitboxes = That Huntress throwing axe that hit the still, crouched survivor even though it went way over their head. 
---
Every single one of these "lul bad hitbox plz fix" is a latency thing and is obnoxious to see everywhere I lurk.
---
I mean ruins also is luck based and that's your top tier perk (which i agree with).
---
Did you just understand me?
---
Now you misunderstood my argument
---
Well considering all your progress and stats are online I'd say that they do transfer. You can already play on multiple consoles and the stats carry over.
---
Tinkerer is useless. Same as iron madien. Has a *"okay* effect but its just a notification perk
---
Its demongorgon hun
---
They hand 0 punishment for it and many people like to derank to bully newer killers. So as soon as they're unhappy with the match for any reasons they DC.
---
Just the brain shading. (I'm a dumb critic)
---
Ohhhhh, because he's a demon ofc. Thank you!
---
Then next match you get a slugging hillbilly
---
Notice how the only killers that are truly the power role in this game are the ones people want nerfed
---
Thanks for the answers everyone, guess I'm buying an ethernet cable
---
So basically I pick a perk and that perk will continuously show up until I get it to tier 3 then I get a different perk. This has been happening for a while now. This only happens in Claudettes blood webs btw.
---
True
---
Do you have prayer beads or is anal beads a joke?
---
I don’t think that’s camping, I think that’s common sense.
---
nice, i have the same tactic
---
It pisses me off so much. Especially with Bubba just stood right in front of me revving his chainsaw until I die.
---
Stealth mode? A controllable lunge? Sounds like ambush
---
Lilith every second she see's you
---
It will get lighter as it heals. There's a load of residual ink left and within a week or two it should be pitch perfect my tattoo artist said.
---
They dont work. Basically they mean   nothing so dont stress it.
---
And while I'm at it I might as well just stand in a corner and let you win
---
Generators take 80 seconds without any items or great skill checks. Most people whoever *will* hit greats or have toolboxes at high ranks.
---
A single failed Ruin check meanwhile costs the Survivor 7 seconds of time. (5% lost + 3 seconds that the gen sparks and can't gain progress.) This means that 11 failed Ruin checks will cause a generator to take nearly *twice* as long! And 11 good skill checks is pretty easy to obtain.
---
The problem is that gens without Ruin are too short but gens without Ruin are too fast. I'd honestly be okay with them adding 20 seconds to the gen (from 80 to 100) but also nerfing Ruin to reduce the gen by 1%/2%/3% instead of 3%/4%/5%.
---
"Finally"? What about Bubba? He snacks on survivor BBQ daily
---
Don't worry about it! Survivors are always looking for something to bitch about.
---
You won't get banned.
---
Just report them if they're rude.
---
Dude u can get a 4K with any other killer, I’ve gotten 4K’s with doctor, trapper, hillbilly, huntress, Freddy, Myers, legion, etc. Stop whining saying u can’t get a 4K with other killers, u only have to be good at the game and that’s it
---
I never thought about saving dailies...
---
Even though it's a shitpost, you still learn that little bit more!
---
*Laughs in hag MYC*
---
Friday the 13th was never going to kill this game but I’d be a liar to say I didn’t like Friday the 13th both games  has the same style (run from the killer and escape) but are overall different what made Friday 13th so enjoyable for me is player interaction
---
Im not even like that. I play very altruistic, trying to take aggro when I can if my mates cant loop to save their lifes!
---
you're good. keep drawing
---
Incredible artwork!
---
what? i'm all ears can win chases although you really shouldn't depend on it, def not useless though
---
thrilling is a pretty good detection perk
---
His net probably went to shit there for some reason. If it's a lag switch your character freezes (will find an example of a lag switch)
---
HERE COMES THE TRAPPER
---
🎵Here comes the Trapperrrr🎵
---
I will. Thank you
---
Man, this is heartbreaking. I still play it time to time, actually just bought it on sale for me and a friend to play as per tradition every friday the 13th. It feels so bland and broken now, when it felt so refreshing upon release.
---
unrelenting is so god awful i'd call even monstrous shrine more useful
---
Came to say this.
---
Came to say this
---
Most of them are, but sometimes the hits are bullshit even from the killer’s perspective
---
True enough. Could have the axe as a skin option too.
---
Wait, they were added?!  Seriously?!
---
Me: circles the wall to see if anyone is there before leaving, but someone is there so I down him and pick him up to hook him. 
---
1st survivor: fucking camping queer, kill yourself. Shitty killer.
---
I like the ones who use the term patrol and just go to 1 gen that is still in hook shot and say they are not camping if you even try to say anything ppl will just yell salty survivor main and other dumb shit. Survivors do that to though by calling ppl killer mains when someone says something they do not agree with so I guess it even outs
---
Not really. Just means the clown has some kinks and there ain't nothing wrong with that
---
All the comments are so wholesome
---
I mean I know it would be so silly, but I kind of wish it stacked. The effect could get a "soft cap" where it doesn't increase much after a certain point but I would love to see how ridiculous it could get with that many purple mists.
---
your on ps4
---
this is to be expected
---
Yeah I was just busting balls. Yes,  Nurse is the consensus hands down strongest killer in game.  Not even close.  She's followed by Spirit then Billy.
---
Clown, Trapper, Demogorgon
---
It looks good dude, keep drawing and developing your skills
---
I will thank you
---
Clown. Trapper. Demogorgon.
---
I don't have kids but i honestly think MK11 is better for kids than DBD. I played MK as a kid and there is literally nothing special about it imo. But DBD can be pretty scary at the beginning as a new player.
---
It's not just a latency thing. Period. Its annoying to see this being argued every time. You can get bullshitted on a 50ping game too :)
---
True stuff.
---
Are you joking
---
The fact that your using Leatherface makes this so much better
---
What about tombstone
---
It means you already have nearly every possible perk on that character you should either learn more from other characters to unlock new ones for her blood web or start playing as a new survivor
---
happened to me also, i died to entity:)
---
3 finished + 1? replacement right away. Technically you could have 3 completed mori dailies + a new mori daily.
---
Anal beads is the joke for prayer beads cause it fucks you in the ass.
---
Really? Interesting...
---
A while back??! That video is from early 2018 LMAO. It's a completely different game now balancewise.
---
But neither are really "games for kids," and while I don't think mk11 is that bad, it's still M, and so is Dbd (which is much less violent than mk), can I also mention the diablo, resident evil, skyrim, saints row, etc. Are all on switch
---
As a possible future teamate end if the match someone wants dc cool do you. But first hit then dc. Why play?
---
Yeah that’s what lag switch’s do
---
Funny because I was around 80 ping all game. Its clearly a game problem and not a ping problem
---
Eh I still think clowns a little cannibalish but we just have to wait until the archives to find out
---
I have to time when I eat dinner and play dead by daylight because they aren't compatible.
---
Jason will never be added unless a miracle happens 
---
Yautja Won’t happen prob since it’s getting its own game I believe 
---
I hope they stay far away from the five nights at Freddy Franchise
---
\*purrs in Survivor\*
---
You’re probably right.
---
Demigorgon needs to have demi plays
---
dude this is awesome! love the linework.
---
Dad bods are in now.
---
Surprise
---
Looks awesome!
---
I get tons of free downs with Tinkerer on Leatherface, and with PWYF you actually can get there in time if they're not 2 on the gen
---
When you go patrol every Gen and no survivor is there you know where they are it's not camping to go back to the hook when you know they're going for the save.
---

Yesterday morning on ps4
---
To post pictures like this.
---
For only 11 you got alot of talent!
---
If he chainsawed across the map, then he shouldve been safe. Don't unhook infront of the killer. "Tunneling" Is just some pussy argument you survivor mains use when you do something stupid, and expect the killer to let it slide. Survivor mains are as one sided as feminists. You use the "I'm playing objectively" Excuse to say gen rushing doesn't exist, but then you turn around cry when the killer plays objectively to down and hook you.
---
Yeah never mind then, on PC and did it a few weeks ago. Hope the person shows up though!
---
2 vs 8
---
Random modifiers to standard game
---
Last survivor standing on different rules
---
New objectives
---
List goes on at this point we can take anything.
---
No I meant like is there a gameplay reason to saving your daily challenges as opposed to just turning them in once you’re done?
---
I’m more concerned about this face cam
---
No its alot of people
---
Like "Huh, I just hit them"
---
Nobody at any point mentioned that scenario where the killer checked the gens found nobody and returned.  This is you trying to create a fictitious scenario to justify patrolling the hook.  In that scenario I would agree return to the hook but again absolutely nobody here suggested that was a thing.

Are you sure the Killer didn’t seek out the hatch and close it then go back to being AFK. It 100% opens if you’re the last alive no matter what so he could have just closed it.
---
How so? I’m happy to hear constructive criticism
---
I edited my post to explain the actual reason.

Better to look down because it's less obvious than looking up so they waste a good portion of their battery, if you're carrying to the basement and they're trying to flashlight you in the stairs you need to look up tho

*Giorno is downed by noed*
---
*Killer picks up Giorno*
---
Killer: haha! Even though because of you the Dwight escaped, I get to enjoy hooking you! The one who looped me the whole game, now DIE!
---
*Music starts to play intense piano*
---
Giorno: That was the only plan I could go with since you were camping my friend, but I still plan on surviving and you forgot one detail. One detail that will allow my survival.
---
Killer: Oh Ho! And what could that possibly be? You have no chance! You're in death hook fool!
---
Giorno: I am on death hook, but that's only because you've hooked me twice. The last time you hooked me was 45 seconds ago. 
---
Killer: Enough talk, the hook is right there, DIE BABY SURVIVOR!
---
*Music cuts out*
---
Giorno: it's already useless, I have won...
---
Giorno: [DECISIVE STRIKE] MUDAAAAA!
---
*Music starts again, even more intense now*
---
killer: Wrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyy! Who would ever run DS ever since last patch!? Ever since it dropped out of the meta!? Why use an obselete perk!?
---
Giorno, already at the exit: You lost because you could not anticipate a survivor running anything else besides [DIE HARD] or other meta perks and did not even realize I was obsession, despite you not having any obsession perks!
---
Killer: Nannnnniiiiiiii!? How could I lose!? This build I got from YT is unbeatable! You're all just a cancerous SWF gen rushing group! Lowest of the low! So toxic, Baka!
---
Giorno: I play this game to have fun with my friends, there's nothing toxic about that. One more thing, I only have 2 friends in this game; I don't even know who that Dwight is!
---
Killer: I-impossible! Why would you risk so much for someone you don't know!?
---
Giorno: Because I have a dream, to have fun playing survivor! I hope one day, you have fun playing killer.
---
*Giorno exits, the music ending with one last dramatic note*
---
He probably closed it.
---
U r dumb, tunneling is when there is 3 ppl trying to take hits for the survivor getting tunneled and the killer keeps going to the survivor in the front when he could be getting easy hits on the ppl right in front of him, this happens 8/10 matches
---
Oh ok, thank you!
---
Because one side has to wait 10 minutes for every match. The other at most waits 2.
---
Imagine with the Xenomorph the survivors hear the clicking when in terror radius so you don’t know if he’s close to you or not unless chase is entered
---
When they try to kill shirtless Myers and you slap back with shirtless clown. Perfection.
---
It’s not if you know the survivors there it’s fine and going back to check is fine as well
---
I would say play Wraith because I think he's great and a blast to play. But just play Billy or Trapper they're both easy.
---
That's what a patrol is so OP did say that.
---
Big brain time
---
What the hell is on this guys face
---
What's the transformation sequence, though?
---
I'd love what i'd call a vanilla mode:
---
* No perks, no addons, no items, no offerings.
---
* No killer powers. Only M1
---
* Generator repair time 80 -&gt; 110 seconds
---
No creeper. Stop trying to promote the work of a literal child rapist for fuck's sake
---
Hag wouldn't die she's a Wendigo. In lore, Wendigos can't die of old age
---
No it isn't.  And they didn't say that.  This is you inserting your own context.  Patrolling simply means the killer is maintaining a path that returns them at regular intervals back to the hooked survivor.  It could mean I broke a nearby pallet then went right back to the hook.  I checked a single gen then went right back to the hook.  I checked my totem then went right back to the hook.  It absolutely does not mean that they checked all the objectives then returned back to the hook.  In fact the scenario I put forth is far more likely for someone that routinely patrols hooks.
---
No, you are dumb. If the killer is PRIORITIZING (that's the correct term) then your job is to loop him while the other survivors do gens. If the killer is prioritizing someone over an easy kill, then they're most likely either mad, or bad. If you go down easy while being prioritized, you're bad. Learn how to loop.
---
Typically when I see people who have profile comment sections like that they are legitimate facecampers
---
nah
---
Look at the picture. You're telling me that's green ping lol? I would love to see hit's with 150+ ping
---
Yeah I agree DC’ing because you don’t like the map or killer or offerings or are caught first or you haven’t seen anyone and 2 gens have popped are all bullshit
---
You can see individual ping though.
---
Every perk of hers is good and has its uses. For the killer herself she passively phases in and out which can throw people off unless theyre really good at tracking. She has great mobility that gets better with addons. There isnt any specific maps she is bad on and loops can be mindgamed or just phased around. Billy who commonly was considered the 2nd best killer before she came into the game, has none of that, his only qualitys are high movement and instadown. 1 of which spirit has. Nurse is obviously the best for obvious reasons so i dont think i need to go over that.
---
It is not camping. Even if you don't have BBQ you might hear bush or breathing too, and in any given condition leaving the hook and let them get a free unhook will be stupid.
---
I made it explicitly clear that I'm talking about without the enitity's interference. This means that Spirit would've stayed dead and Nurse would've bled out from potential injuries or starved. Legion ran into some random woods with no food or water. It's safe to assume they starve. If they don't kill eachother first.
---
Lisa was being eaten alive by cannibals. She absolutely would have died.
---
Just another Baby Spirit player nothing to see.  Lol OoO is one of the worst perks you could run against a Spirit too.
---
Killer: Jesus
---
It's not tunneling because the killer's objective is down and hook survivors. You're complaining because the killer is literally doing what he's supposed to, and I know you don't know what tunneling is because you're saying it happens 8/10 times. Getting chased isn't being tunneled. Are you expecting him to just not chase you and let you get the gens done? And if you're hooked nowhere near any loop spots, better hope you can make it to one. It's a game, sometimes there's just nothing you can do, but if you're good at looping and mind gaming, being prioritized is only works in your favor.

*equips ebony mori

By the time the killer takes me to hook, the animations done &amp; ive went through and seen the end screens I could have been in another game that’d I’d potentially enjoy more.
---
nice job at erasing the original text lmao
---
I'd say there's plenty of counterplay to being chased after a teammate is hit. Against any killer splitting off at the beginning is smart, so you usually will have sizable distance, and even if not, there are plenty of ways to bait a hit or near guarantee a stun to cancel the power.
---
Also, I don't understand the logic that it isn't fun to get sprinted at by Legion, it's just the proc of his power, every other killer has a power that procs at some point, so I don't know why this unfun-ness doesn't also apply to other killers. I get that certain playstyles are annoying, and someone can stall with Legion, but that largely depends on the playstyle of the team, and at that point you're not complaining about a killer, you're complaining about bad survivors, which you'll never be able to avoid entirely.

I mean you gotta savor it my guy. Down here in Texas it takes 13 hours, 18 if you nap off during it, to make really good BBQ and Chili. It's why Bubba is low tier. More time making good home cookin' rather than practicing his moves
---
It’s great way better than my drawings
---
One I did not even mention anything about who you main so don't put words in my mouth. 
---
Two if you see post of people complaining about camping apparently that means others agree that camping is a issue that needs to be addressed and singing the same backwashed tunes "GeT oUt of 20s GgZ" isn't helping the situation. 
---
Nobody likes camping except for cunts and apparently you must get carried by your teammates or you could be that one guy but go off genius.
---
Thank you
---
&gt; If a killer chooses to proxycamp a hooked survivor, all the others can just ignore him and do gens, which usually results in 3 gens popped when the hooked player is only in his second stage.
---
This is nice in theory, but in practice this never happens in random groups, and as SWF u literally have to scream at your friends for them to do gens, and some will still stupidly try to save.
---
&gt; The best way to deal with both of these problems is to actively use Barbecue and Chili, which immediately shows you the location of distant survivors and can help you with getting a chase sooner. If you don't see any auras, it means that the rest of the survivors is hiding nearby instead of doing gens
---
A lot of survivors hides in lockers to counter this.
---
I agree with your point 2 tho.
---
You guys are all talking about latency but I think it's still pretty bs that Huntress can throw a bit over a gen and someone doing the gen in the other side will get hit. 
---
Why would their hit boxes be as big as when they're standing?
---
YOU GOT DDOSED OVER DBD?
---
Moister than an oyster
---
the map is way to small
---
A killer that has a different mode of vision would be cool though. Like echolocation, heatvision (predator), trexvision like this plague!
---
Yeah, first time too. It really scarred me and made me unwilling for future party invites, the exception being start of the match and I’m survivor, you know, for communication and whatnot.
---
Mans boutta BUST
---
Isn't it actually 1 purple + brown = max?
---
That’s because ebony moris are trash to play against :/
---
I agree completely, except on the "Everyone had fun, or at least 4 people did".
---
First of all, lemme say I don't tunnel off the hook unless it's a flashlight-clicking teabagger.
---
Second, the "Well, 4 people had fun so it's fine" argument is nonsensical. Why would the killer player even care if the survivors had fun when they didn't have fun themselves? The game is enjoyable if YOU have fun, not if your opponents have fun, in my opinion. I'm not gonna put the survivor's enjoyment over my own as killer player.
---

---
You've only just started playing killer.  Ignore the toxic trash players in this game.  You'll be fucking those douchebags up in no time turning those teabags into DC's if you stick with learning the game.  You should only be worrying about learning the mechanics of playing killer and improving your game and situational knowledge right now.  Of course swf will beat a 3 hour player.  A lot goes in to playing optimal killer.  You should check out the YouTube channel "Not Otzdarva".  He's one of the best killer players in the game and has the best informative videos I've ever seen to help players improve their killer play.  He narrates every decision he makes during the whole game.  You'll learn a lot from him plus he's genuinely entertaining to watch.

How do I downvote twice?

I hope you find less anger in life, its too short. Have a good day.

*Laughs in dream world*
---
Lmao don’t even fucking talk about Last Year The Nightmare. I’m still mad.
---
I watched the trailers/teasers for *months* and when it finally released, I bought it immediately (only $20 I think.)
---
Don’t get me wrong, me and my friends had a fucking blast playing it. . . *for maybe 3-4 hours.* After that point, you pretty much did everything the game had to offer. 
---
The game is beyond dead now because they’ve just straight up given up on it. They did some balances/changes here and there, but there was literally no new content.
---
Aah, that must of felt hella good
---
Thicc angel from above
---
Never said explicitly how Hag dies. She is based off of a Wendigo. That doesn't mean that she is one. She just has some abilities. She is missing one of the key abilities. Regeneration. Without it, she can bleed out from her injuries.
---
Use decisive strike and sprint burst, its almost impossible to get tunneled
---
Trappers the opposite for me, as soon as the match starts everyone's disabling my traps and I never get anyone with them...and I only ever try playing him for dailies...
---
Ruin works immediately and Soap doesnt, and they get ample warning before it goes to its full potential.
---
Please stop
---
I play more killer than survivor and what he said is true. The 4:1 ratio doesn’t mean anything. Killers can make a single survivors experience much more worse than a survivor can make theirs.

They got scared of me flashing them lol
---
Also Freddy is in the game ? But PINHEAD WOULD BE THE BEST OPTION, should be the next licensed killer and Jason does have bear traps . Friday the 13 is actually a fun as game , you should try it ; you can escape 4 or 5 different ways I believe and one of them includes a very specific way to kill Jason . I WOULD LOVE TO SEE different ways to escape in dbd , in a game mode or something
---
A demon corgi?
---
I don’t plan to make money off this I only do i it for my own and other people’s entertainment
---
Wait, I didn’t suggest Freddy Kruger...
---
Pc actually has a larger player base and matchmaking times are a fraction of what they are on ps4
---
You know what else would explain a lot? If you're 12, not only would that explain how hard it is to read what you're saying, it would explain why you aren't listening. You're whining because the killer is prioritizing one survivor over another, and saying it's tunneling, when it isn't. The objective is to kill the survivors. He's doing his objective, but he's prioritizing one survivor. You sitting here, trying to give me examples of killers prioritizing one survivor over others isn't helping your case, because I already told you that there's already a term for that, and I just said it. You're being prioritized. Killers who prioritize are easy to loop and mind game. You're probably the kind of survivor who unhooks their teammates right in front of the killer and gets mad at him for downing the survivor for the easy kill, instead of yourself for basically killing your teammate.
---
Noed has been a crutch for killers for quite a while now. I even main killer and I'm saying this. It's a terribly designed perk and needs to be reworked to where it doesn't punish survivors for actually doing good and reward killers for failing. One idea I saw once was to no longer make it a hex perk but only work for about 2 minutes when the exits are powered. It also should only work on survivors who have been hooked, meaning if a survivor has gone all game without getting hooked they wouldn't be exposed and they would actually be rewarded for surviving and not getting hooked.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d481g7/licensed_killers_that_id_like_to_see/
---
It all depends on how fast the survivors find it... if it's in a good spot it can be quite a good use of a perk if they find it 30s. into the game it's useless and wasted perk pick. Overall it's what killers have to make the game last a little bit longer, as they are the ones on a timed system, survivors technically got as much time as they want, killers are on the clock!
---
The thing about the logic of calling a random perk a crutch is that a crutch is a medical device with a specific indication. That is, it’s supposed to be used in some circumstances. So what is the correct circumstance to use the crutch NOED? I’ve never heard a satisfactory answer to this.
---
- obvious sfw is obvious-
---
Me: I'm about to mori this man's while career
---
I heard that's a thing on console for whatever reason, but it's never happened to me on PC.
---
Nah, I don’t do unsafe unhooks
---
And I’m not 12 lol
---
So he moves from spawn once the gates are open, closes the hatch and goes back to the exact same spot after? Odd playstyle I guess. I never found his location, just his Spine Chill zone. The hatch was in the freezer room from Saw III and SC never lit up there. It only lit up in the same spots I ran back and forth through, top and bottom.
---
Although I only played DBD on PC, I don't think there is many differences. Maybe the killers and survivors you get, when you buy the game could be different. I think you get doctor, hag etc. when you buy the game. But on PC you don't get them. Only 3 OG killers, 4 OG survivors, Nurse, Huntress, Nea, David and Bill. Other than that I don't think there is any differences. I might be wrong though, don't quote me on that.
---
The bar is EGC (End Game Collapse). Basically if you complete 5 gens and open the exit door, or if you don't get 5 gens and killer closes the hatch, EGC will start and you'll have 2 minutes to leave the trial. Otherwise entity will come and eat your soul IRL lol.
---
*”please pay attention to me, I hate my minimum wage job and want to twitch stream full time”*
---
Nice, ty. Also, I am almost sure that it does have more mature audience, at PS4, there was at least one player who teabagged(I'm not sure if this is how it is written) almost every match.
---
Ya around there people usually don’t know what to do and are too scared to do anything useful. Keep playing you’ll get past em
---
Because theres 30 other perks with 3 tiers each
---
Plus, Jason can teleport, break down walls and doors by walking into them, sense exactly where the counsellors are... he’s quite a few steps up these guys.
---
Friday 13th would be kinda cool but imagine all these new players going up against experienced players because of rank reset.
---
I'm mostly coming from a "game theory"-esque way of thinking, which might explain why I'm a bit biased in this regard. While the main goal of an individual would be to get the most resources (enjoyment in this case) for themselves, the best outcome in general/for the group is to let the most people have the most resources possible. If I'm having a bad time and start doing things that negatively affect other players (sandbagging/teabagging/flashlight clicking as survivor, tunneling/camping as killer), it'll only result in other people having a bad time as well and it won't even guarantee that ***I'm*** having a good time =&gt; everyone loses.
---
If you're only playing for your own enjoyment that's fine and I don't blame you, as long as you're not going out of your way to make every other players' time worse. If you are, you might want to reconsider your actions because that kind of "step down on everyone else" attitude *will* come back to screw you over in the future.
---
However if you're *not* like that, do whatever you want.
---
I'm pretty sure PTB is separate, so you'll have to start over.
---
This is why I love this community so much!
---
&gt;But hitbox issues have been the main complain of survivors since patch 2.0.
---
Hitboxes have been the main complain of survivors because 90% of these complaints are like this one, simply wrong and have little to do with actual hitboxes. OP itself thought 80ms wasn't that significant which proves the lack of understanding when making a post showing this screenshot. 
---
Just because people in this community love the sheep mentality and have been jumping in the bandwagon of ignorant complains, doesn't mean there is an issue or the issue is that significant. Anyone seeing this thread will think OP is actually talking about hitbox so when a similar situation happens to them, they will make another thread just as wrong. 
---
&gt;Anyone who played survivor before could notice the difference. It's not just the latency.
---
I highly doubt this because 9 out of 10 threads complaining about this "hitbox issue" are latency related. People struggle to understand that they aren't playing with 0ms and not to mention possible lag spikes on either end.
---
I had someone tell me they wanted to dropkick my pregnant wife.
---
Joke's on them I'm single
---
You have to take perks you don’t want to start removing them from the pool
---
One thing people forget a lot is that early game is where survivors are at peak performance. During first minute you generally have all 4 survivors working hard on gens. After 4-5 minutes you generally have 1 survivor on hook, 1 on his way to saving, 1 doing random shit, and maybe 1 working on a gen.
---
So slowing them down during the first 2 minutes is actually really usefull. And when you are lucky and it last more than that, its broken.
---
Ruin is a gamble since it can last either the whole game or for less than 30 seconds. In low-mid ranks it's extremely good, but the higher rank you get the less effective it will be.
---
It's all up to how you want to play. Some players really need extra time to add pressure so even if it gets cleansed it can be useful. Other players don't use it because they can put on massive pressure without slowing down the game. Personally I just like having it as an option, but it's not necessary to win.
---
Letting someone go is always optional.
---
360s look way easier on PC than on PS4...can anybody confirm if this is true?
---
There’s going to be way less lag, General quality of life is waaaaaaaaaaaay better pc you’re probably going to like it way better
---
If it isn’t bug and if he only moved to closed the hatch and did nothing else, most likely he was trying to derank. Or he didn’t want to rank up quickly since it was rank reset.
---
You do what you want, you have no obligation over anyone. Everyone's game is screwed in this case.
---
&gt;Look at the picture. You're telling me that's green ping lol? I would love to see hit's with 150+ ping
---
The "ping color" doesn't matter, what matters is the value and possible spikes. 80ms is high enough to allow hits even when the killer was a small distance behind you. The only way to completely remove this is by playing with 0ms (being the host).
---
Made with memeatic
---
Even though I don't like it and never use it when I play killer, I'll give it this, it's the best perk for game slowage, especially if survivors choose to not go find the totem, which I have seen sometimes at higher ranks. Although, I did see one suggestion of a rework to it, here's how it goes: Ruin is no longer a hex perk, the 3 gens within the closest proximity of each other are affected by Ruin. You cannot get great skill checks on these 3 gens. I actually kind of liked the sound of it.
---
His objective isn't to get as much hooks as possible, it's to kill all of the survivors. If your teammates aren't doing shit while you're looping, then they're bad teammates. You'll find them in literally any multiplayer game in existence. Tunneling doesn't exist. Every example you gave is someone being the killer's priority, which usually happens when the killer is upset at that person, or is bad enough to focus one person while the rest of the survivors do gens.
---
There was killershack gen, a gen on the road RIGHT next to it and one on the house opposite. She let us do all the other ones and when it got down to them 3 she refused to chase anyone and would only rotate between the 3 going for grabs with prayer beads.
---
I spend most of my days in mid-low ranks, so I'd still leave the BBQ remark as is. It's another game mechanic a competitive killer will have to keep in mind, and doesn't change the fact that BBQ is still beneficial in the "gives you a general idea of what to do next" department.
---
*But really, you guys run Distortion? That's a perk I haven't seen in a looong time...*
---
&gt;Okay let's get one thing straight I'm not crying about camping I'm giving a straight clear cut statement about camping but you might've had something triggered because you felt the need to comment on the meme in the first place. 
---
You are. Memes, like the word itself from Latin, carry ideas. It's a thing in philosophy for so long, like jokes. Jokes, memes and almost everything carry ideas and meaning, in this case looks like you are frustrated to be camped which leads to my hypothesis you are low rank.
---
So "you are triggered because you comment to a meme" part is just a foolish try to defend your idea or the idea you are trying to show even is silly and also try to pretend that in a public space I can't state my opinions which is an attack to free speech
---
&gt;I clearly said camping doesn't make you good which is factual. Camping is just you being unsure or insecure of your ability in playing killer which is factual. You're better off playing survivor and be the teammate that just wait until everybody die which is factual. Prove me wrong
---
Since you asked for..
---
Yes, camping doesn't make you good, neither bad since it's something that people do when they are trying the game or new to it. Figuring out what's the best way to play killer, often new players don't even realize that's something that punish them as I've seen in other posts and in the community in general due to the bad tutorial system we have that shows the killer camping
---
Camping isn't "showing your insecurities and not being firm in your decision" but as said a evidence that player is newer. The only other instance I've seen that be done is when the killer get frustrated by a particular person, that act childish in the first place, making sure to piss off the killer. In that case the survivor shouldn't have any complaint since had what he/she deserved but that's not the case often.
---
&gt;You're better off playing survivor and be the teammate that just wait until everybody die which is factual. Prove me wrong
---
I'm not my dear, I play survivor as anyone. I do gens, do saves if I have BT and rarely walk since I prefer run from gen to gen trying my best when chases occurs. I play both sides since I prefer play 100% of any game I play and exclusively play one side of two sides game is just a waste
---
Please don't encourage new killers to use NOED. It's too much of a crutch and I honestly don't believe it helps new killers get better or learn how to play, since it essentially rewards them for being bad all game. 
---
I'm a purple rank survivor and the only killers I've seen who use NOED are ones that don't know how to actually play and get looped for all 5 gens. 
---
I think NOED really puts you in the wrong mindset of the game. My brother uses NOED and when I watch him play sometimes, I'll point out his mistakes. His reply is usually "it's fine, I have NOED".
---
While I do think perks are important, it's also important to learn how to run loops and use your killer skills correctly and not just rely on a crutch perk that'll probably get cleansed once you get into higher ranks anyway.
---
Seriously, it's a solid pattern. M1 Huntress? She has NOED. Billy keeps missing his chainsaws? He definitely has NOED. Nurse doesn't know how to blink? Better start cleansing totems. 
---
I would really recommend getting stalling perks first and then detection perks. Personally I run Ruin and Thanatophobia on Huntress, and that really helps slow the game down.
---
Demogorgon, survivors are just skins and perks
---
Do Nancy but only go for perks then level Steve up with her perks
---
DbD on PC has a chat in the Lobby and at the end of the game and very few exclusive cosmetics as example for Streamers/YouToubers but only a few people have them and of course Legacy. Gameplaywise it isn't much different except for performance but that depends on your PC but it should be better. PC players also have access to a public test servers if it is available to test new content and gameplay changes.
---
Can confirm. When i played alone as survivor it usually took around 3min with some luck, even when playing in low ranks.
---
I'll let them go depending on how toxic they were during the game, if they were t bagging and flashlight spamming, I'll kill them without a doubt.
---
Thats a neat idea
---
I was in the middle of a Mori when my game froze for about 8 seconds, and the. I was teleported backwards about 10ft and the Survivor was just allowed to escape.
---
The PTB wasn’t perfect, but you can definitely tell they are so close to nailing it.
---
People want them nerfed because they are broken. Even in red ranks people constantly complain about them 2.
---
You cannot loop them and you cannot escape them.
---
The only way to beat a decent player using nurse or spirit is to go undetected - since you have to pop 5 gens and they have crazy mobility (that's also silent) that's not really feasible.
---
This game didn’t use to have the kind of support/fan base/in game store as it did back then. Dead By Daylight has taken a huge turn in both quality and content, and you can tell now that McCote and the other developers are really passionate about this game now. Even just a year ago you could tell from Streams/Dev Updates that they were sick of the toxic playerbase/complaints they were constantly getting. 
---
But if you look at Dead By Daylight now, it is MUCH healthier now. We have a Support Ticket site, a Cosmetic Shop to help fund future Updates/Content, we’ve had a severe overhaul on Balance/Fixes, and we now have a popular Horror Title coming on Sept.17th. 
---
The devs have put so much effort into the game the past few months/year. Just take a look at the Roadmap and you can see they really want this game to be something great, they just don’t have the manpower of Triple-AAA Game Developers.
---
Be patient and don’t be toxic. The Devs love this game. Give it time.
---
Thanks bro :) 
---
You talking bout the self harm scars?
---
&gt;"Just did, never mentioned regeneration once."  
---
Look harder. The 2nd to last line in the Applications list says otherwise.  
---
&gt;"Did mention voice imitation, but no one talks in DbD so that would be useless."  
---
Ash would like to know your location. The Plague would also like to know your location.  
---
Also, survivors are known to talk to each other in the campfire realm.
---
So you survivors always want the killers to not tunnel, not camp, give last hatch etc but when was the last time you let a killer sacrifice you because he got not kills that game?
---
&gt; If you just sit there and do the gen you will complete it. It might take slightly longer, but not by that much.
---
This isn't true.
---
* Normal generator repair time -&gt; 80 seconds
---
* With ruins and 100% Great skill checks -&gt; approximately 88 seconds.
---
* With ruins and 80% Great skill checks -&gt; approximately 100 seconds.
---
* With ruins and 50% Great skill checks -&gt; approximately 120 seconds.
---
Ruins is a big deal
---
It's the easiest way to win end game collapse once you kick that hatch door
---
Ghostface is taking lessons from the nurse
---
The aura reading ability is taken away so you don't know exactly where I am, what gen I'm working on, and instead killer might spend more time around the hooked because he thinks survivors are close bc he didn't see auras.
---
Gens start at full and a broken exit gate. Survivors get 3 lives each and once they get hooked they lose one. Killer has to make 4 gens regress all the way before the survivors collect 10 shards to make a lever for the exit gate. If the survivors get the shards, they go to an exit and win. If the killer regresses the gens, the killer wins
---
why no white power smh
---
When you are running in a straight line or around a corner or just vaulted an window and a Trapper hits you even when there was a gap between you two, this is not a hitbox issue but just how latency works.
---
The situation you described is 100% hitbox issue, the problem is people love to mix both situations. When you say:
---
&gt;You guys are all **talking about latency** but I think it's still pretty bs that Huntress can throw a bit over a gen and someone doing the gen in the other side will get hit.
---
It leads me to believe you think people talking about latency are just bullshiting when in reality you are exemplifying a completely different situation. 
---
&gt;Why would their hit boxes be as big as when they're standing?
---
Huntress Hatchets is one of the few situations where hitboxes are actually a problem because they were made in a shape that doesn't match the object being thrown and survivors hitbox is higher than them. Additionally, when you are repairing a generator or being healed, your character is standing up. 
---
Here is how the hitboxes are clips.twitch.tv/SparklyWealthyOrcaKappaRoss (it was showing in a dev stream). If you are standing behind a generator (or repairing it), the upper part of your hitbox can be hit with a hatchet.
---
Thanks lol
---
*ya’ll mind if I...* 
---
**l o n g ?**
---
Just don't go down first
---
Congrats. That teammate is now getting tunelled.
---
Lol those are all powers from Algernon Blackwood's book "The Wendigo" which is were the deer design comes from. If you're going to link me to an article about the Wendigo, link me to to one about the original Wendigo, because it's obvious to everyone that the wendigo can't fly.
---
&gt; A single failed Ruin check meanwhile costs the Survivor 7 seconds of time. (5% lost + 3 seconds that the gen sparks and can't gain progress.)
---
Don't forget that if several survivors work on the generator, its worst because you also cut the progress of ur partner. Also each SUCCESSFULL great skill checks is 2% less because of ruin.
---
&gt; The problem is that gens without Ruin are too short but gens without Ruin are too fast. I'd honestly be okay with them adding 20 seconds to the gen (from 80 to 100) but also nerfing Ruin to reduce the gen by 1%/2%/3% instead of 3%/4%/5%.
---
Yea good idea. Or make it 80 -&gt; 110 but completly remove ruins. This might however also require a nerf to nurse and spirit since these 2 would be OP with those speeds.
---
When you dc you also drop the item
---
He should get a gun
---
Yup thats tunnel
---
Maybe if you're a child named Isaac...
---
Sadly a few killers are the same. Leatherface, doc etc. Without good addons they struggle big time too. Kinda sucks because as soon as you hit purple/red ranks as survivor all you really see are Nurses and Spirits and sometimes Billy.
---
I mean patrolling and camping are definitely different things. Still, too much patrolling makes you just as much of a dick as a facecamper.
---
P3 just means you've played the game a lot
---
true, maybe instead I could instead put fazbear attraction?
---
As a billy main i dont remember last time i lost a end game collapse once i kicked that hatch door
---
There are some seriously shitty human being behind the keyboard in this community.  Just ignore them.  Meme games are funny as shit as a refreshing unexpected change of pace as survivor.  Also you can't be reported for giving away a hatch.  That's just dead survivors being salty.
---
Your probably a low rank survivor killer main just like me :D
---
oh not pallets, like vaulting. But the exhaustion thing is broken.
---
anytime buddy, i also recommend Premonition or Spine chill to know the killer position..those are very useful if you are a new player
---
I call patrolling proxy camping if there is no reason for them to stay around the hook. I mean if they seen someone else scratch marks then fair enough. If not then yeah proxy camping.
---
Except when I have downed 2 of their teammates, hooked them, and have time to down them before their DS runs out, which happens a fair bit, considering Hag has apparently a -75 to Intelligence and strong map pressure. Hell, I use MYC and go for the 2 states of health damage first. If having time to take out 50% of the Survivors and still get DS’d is tunneling then what the fuck isn’t?
---
Nurse whitout addons &gt; Wraith with best addons
---
Nurse with extra blinks &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wraith whitout addons.
---
Object of obsession is good to good players
---
They don't get stuck moving in one direction, they freeze in place.
---
I mean, in cases where your teammates are being potatoes... it makes sense to hang out and get them as the flock around you.
---
Its shitty, but that's a killer (who may or may not be a potato themselves) capitalizing on poor decisions being made by survivors.
---
With 3 DCs it's up to you if you want to de-pip or not
---
yall so mean to my friend franklin ;-;
---
oof
---
It’s definitely an interesting concept though, I’m sure a lot of people who play killer would like something to counter exhaustion perks other than add ons, but would definitely be a feelsbad as survivor
---
Let me say I don't like camping it's rather unfair and no fun at all to the survivor getting camped... I play more killer then survivor and I play for fun patrolling is what a killer should do ... patrol gens and the map ... just don't be rude about the whole thing and have fun

How was it.

If you wanna talk about Wendigo abilities, bring me an actual source that states what they are. I've given a source. Where is yours? What about your source that the Hag is a Wendigo? When are you going to bring a source for anything you've said?
---
Thrilling Tremors is incredibly good for information and map pressure so you're not aimlessly checking generators, you can go right to the one being worked on. 
---
I'm All Ears also isn't bad against survivors who like to vault and then disappear in a chase so you don't have a hard time catching back up
---
Idk then, maybe it's a problem specific to what you play on. Mine don't get accepted on Xbox (I've been saving a 60k and it's still here)
---
Do you have a place where you post your art? Like twitter maybe or?

Yeah, but it also means

1.i know how to play nurse (probably)

2.i know how to play the game

3. Experience?

4. Rank resetting from rank 9
---
I once died struggling on the hook when my one-year-old, sitting on my lap, decided to help out by holding down the spacebar.
---
The problem I have playing Killer is that when you load in, that first 60 seconds is going to determine how the game goes.
---
There’s no reason a Gen should pop in the time it took me to reach the other side of the map from where I spawned and only hit one person. Considering a Gen can be done in 60-80 seconds, and most Survivors can Loop for longer than that easily, I just think it would add some nice balance, instead of just outright making Gens take longer to do.
---
Typically you prestige characters you like or play a-lot
---
Fair enough
---
I have an Instagram if you want, under Inastagram.com/VohelArt
---
And fyi I just saw the first pic and thought it would be funny to have Rick's thoughts 🤣🤣🤣
---
Whitout ruins, and whitout abilities, Killers definitely would need it imo.
---
Killer Gremlin from Gremlins
---
Yep LOL and I run into the worst killers I've ever seen
---
If someone dc's then they should blame the person who dc'd. Trouble is with dc's it's hard for killers to pip so they gotta to do what they gotta do. Haunted grounds seems like a waste on Billy tho because he has an insta down. Just me 2 cents lol
---
Have you tried "California Girls" at max volume?
---
one time I had a survivor get mad and said "pallets should respawn" after a game where they threw down literally every pallet they saw.
---
Friendly PSA folks: using pallets doesn't make you good at the game! You won't have any left when you need them and you'll end up dead and mad!
---
Interesting. I've never relied on it for that because it's easy to fool the killer into thinking you're going one way and double back. I run whispers, spies from the shadows and iron maiden. Feel like if they really wanted to see your aura accurately they'd run bitter murmur and tinkerer.
---
Nurse is hard :(
---
David's quotes mentioned him fighting multiple people at once. So he can probably take all of them at once, as long as Entity is away.
---
Way better than anything I could’ve done
---
And this is why I use a cup with a straw. Just stick that shit in front of your face and never take your hands off your keyboard again
---
Break her arm
---
Separating survivors at the start of the match actually puts the killer in a worse spot. If the killer does the gen patrol and finds a single survivor, chase begins and one survivor is stalled from doing objectives. If two or three survivors were sitting on a generator, they all scatter and, depending on how good the killer is at split pressure, multiple survivors can be prevented from working on objectives.
---
u/skeletal, I personally expect you to correct the game code that does not resplendent pallets!
---
Because not proxycamping equals standing in a corner and letting them win.  You could fly a passenger jet through the middle ground between those two things.
---
It definitely should’ve been left as it was. 4K makes way more sense than the merciless requirement. As you said, someone leaving (in your case, two people) robs you of the achievement. At that point, it’s completely out of your control. Very fucking dumb.
---
Not only that, but it requires you to keep chases going for a long time, while also needing to keep pressure on gens. Certain killers are hard to slow down the game with, so having to balance the long chases with gens is fucking ridiculous. It’s insane how hard Adept Killers can be compared to Adept Survivors.
---
12 dollars
---
It should be like 8 or 9 I think
---
In-game settings -&gt; Controls -&gt; Secondary Action / Skill check -&gt; Press the button you want
---
Every killer is going to get value from some component of their power at some point in a remotely balanced match.
---
Contrary to popular belief, the skill in DBD isn't looping, it's mindgaming. Legion is designed so his only advantage is being able to injure people easier, and so it should be hard to defend against a first hit (just like not letting a wraith get close for first hit should be the hardest part about facing him with his ability), and because of this, every other part of fighting legion is easy: being chased while injured is easy because you know he has to commit and can't use any kind of power to gain advantage, and same goes for unhooking safely, healing safely, and working on generators efficiently. The only other thing legion's power does is separate survivors, which shouldn't matter anyway because survivors want to stay separated.
---
Adding add-ons into the discussion should be an entirely different topic, add-ons completely change many killers, and many aren't well balanced. Though, for Legion, I haven't seen any high-rarity addons used to much effect post-nerf.
---
Ok, good players don't get gen grabbed by nurses, and good nurses don't "just check" basements. Nurses are also always running someone down, that's how the game works. Any killer who isn't constantly in chase or checking high-value generators (which the Legion also does) isn't using their time efficiently. And just because you can either fight a 5-blink, 3-blink, 4-blink, 3-blink ranged, or omega nurse doesn't mean the killer themselves has variety, those addons are just more noticeable than addons that affect a mending timer or give extra power duration, not to mention that the Legion's addons are much less feared and therefore ignored.
---
Now is there less variety in legion's playstyle? Compared to stronger killers, sure, because stronger killers have more leeway to make their own decisions, but compared to a wraith of equal skill, I think you'd find there is an equal lack in variety (or maybe less for the wraith) because of the weakness of both killers.
---
Also labeling Legion as predictable undersells the importance of mindgaming chases, which every killer has to do. Any adequate killer should not be predictable in that sense, but every killer has to be predictable in broad strokes to some degree, otherwise survivors would get bamboozled every time a nurse blinked (which, in reality, has very consistent and reliable ranges based on charge speed, even with various addons as you'll find high level survivors learn to recognize). Like I mentioned earlier, I think this part of your argument hinges on Legion being weak. If addons were made strong, he would be much less predictable and more annoying for a different reason.
---
If you don’t have the teachables, they don’t count
---
Verify the integrity of the game. That way you'll go back to the OG portraits. Although, it will revert all the icons back to the original.
---
I've gotten threats and shit after joining a party after getting a 4k on them
---
This is all true, and I concede. Thank you for opening my purple rank eyes lol
---
Well if you have been chasing me for like 10 min and your trash ass can’t hit me then I will tbag and if you get salty over it that’s just you being a fucking little baby. When I play killer and someone t bags me I don’t care bc I know that feeling it’s funny and I laugh about it and I hook the guy and play the game and get the other survivors. So your whole point is invalid bc your a pussy who’s just gets salty about a game.

Oh shit I didn't know that. Yeah that's pretty fucked
---
Just throw Small Game on and punish their reliance on that shit.  You'll get thousands of bps just from the totems you get with the perk not to mention the clutch Hex cleanses midgame the perk provides.  I got fed up with all the ps4 babies rocking noed crutch so I started using it as a staple of my loadout.  It has helped immensely.

Yes I'm on xbox

It sometimes works out like that on xbox but most of the time no. Its random af
---
Ive won games because of camping. Its a viable strategy and can work against altruistic survivors. If it works then why shouldnt you do it. Cause it hurts the survivors feelings?
---
Thank you very much for the support
---
No that’s called mindgaming. Camping is actively staying in the area so others _can’t_ rescue the hooked feller.

Hoh, you're approaching me?

I don't get Vigil's positioning at all. That perk is pretty shit in my opinion, and Object of Obsession is the strongest perk in the game in my opinion.
---
They turn into lockers.
---
See the game and its community give a lot of shit for tunnelling killers.  But it really is one of the best strats.  What good killer is going to let a survivor...  survive?
---
I think at this point survivors are actually becoming stronger than killers.
---
Everytime they break bones (which certainly happens a lot) the bones grow back stronger in the break site, and the area surrounding that site does not demineralize because of how fast the injuries heal in Entity's realm.
---
Being slashed and hit daily gives them high pain tolerance and makes them immune to shock.
---
Now combine that with lightning like reflexes, incredibly high stamina, very unstable mental health and constant desire to get back at their torturers. 
---
Entity is the only thing that prevents survivors going gorilla on everyone who isn't Myers.
---
Both need to be removed.

High risk high reward? What's high risk about an item that shows you the killers aura or your teammates aura and also can provide you with a free escape?
---
If your "patrol" doesn't reach the nearest gen at least I'm going to say yeah, definitely just camping.
---
They do have a "quitter bonus" that gives you BP if people DC, but it doesn't factor into your pipping at all. I feel like it should give you a baseline of one rank up in every category for a DC, example being if you've got silvers across the board and there was a DC, you get boosted to golds across the board
---
Frankly I don't understand why the game companies haven't figured out yet that nerfing the hell out of everything in a game loses customers. Freddy got nerfed real bad, The pig has been nerfed, most of the abilities in the game have been nerfed.  There's not to much left and it's getting annoying.
---
Holy crap, the first map is1 building. You start in the killer's terror radius lol. Love the rest though, perks are a bit busted, but overall aesthetically awesome

If you get this mad over a post on reddit, imagine how mad you must get in-game... the goal is not to be toxic, btw.
---
I don't understated why people save dailies, could u explain to me?
---
I wouldn't have a problem with it if it wasn't so easy on the survivor side. Yeah getting a double pip with just a killer's teachables is incredibly challenging, but at rank reset it's very doable. Meanwhile on the survivor side they just have to escape which is so simple and easy. I say either up the requirements for getting survivor adept or tone down the requirements for killer adept. Where it's at right now it's just unfair.
---
I think I see shirtless Micheal in the distance... oh wait it’s just Trapper

&gt;Obvious deranker. Hopefully the new players that buy the game because of Stranger Things won't meet so many of these killers.

And ur choice idrk

No idea who they are
---
Its bc your teamate was waiting on you to die  so he could get hatch, a greedy selfish move. While you were doing the objective like a good player.
---
&gt;What exactly is pathetic here? HE UsED a moRi
---
He didn't use a mori tho.
---
That looks amazing!
---
I just got a great idea!. **Find something better to do than to target the Devs when dropping an out of context quote gives us zero value**
---
Ah okay that makes sense.
---
If there's an early disconnect I always give the last guy the hatch *unless* he's one of those that's teabagging and clicking a flashlight in my face every five seconds ~~it's always a nea~~. It's usually just whoever is last, but if there's one survivor that I feel wasn't helping their team like a claudette that sat in the bushes waiting for the hatch while everyone was dying then I'd rather go and kill them so the other guy that actually played well got the hatch instead.
---
Look... In my recent match I was spirit. I only had 2 Perks. The last survivor was kate, I closed the hatch and the doors were extremely close to each other.
---
She ran in the middle of the street. Shined her flashlight to get my attention and pretty much said "Strike down now. I give up."
---
Since I have empathy for those who give up and just want the match to end I decided... to let to get the gate and leave (obviously slugged lol).
---
I just felt bad. So I just gave her the win.
---
\-shrugs- Probably made that persons day.

The killer is ivan ooze

That’s all I know about gremmy
---
I meant the tombstone. My bad, what is pathetic tho
---
I agree. Its like Self-Care, seems awesome but when your good at survivor you see how it just slows the game and start running med-kits. Inner Strength should have just been added to Small Game instead of being a stand-alone perk imo.
---
Okay so basically who ever plays fairly and isnt a toxic nightmare. Its funny you said it's always a nea. I like to think I'm the least toxic survivor on most of my teams. I'm very empathic. But I always play nea karlson. She's my main
---
I give them the hatch if i think the game was unfair for them (they were new, dc, bad teammates)
---
U get reset to rank18 if you are rank16.  
---
Believe me when I say that he was just smurfing. He obviously did not belong anywhere near that rank.
---
Many things. To start: killers have to capitalize on survivors making mistakes. If survivors don't make mistakes, killers have nothing to capitalize on, and they will lose every time. Survivors shouldn't have so much power that they can literally decide the outcome of the match.
---
It's like opening a box of cookies.

Where at..? i'll bring my toolbox.
---
Just shines from a butt
---
I think inner strenght will only make sense as SWF if ur only one running it.
---
If there's no Ruin, then people don't search usually. Until they get hit by Third Seal. But then they're more afraid of what they can't see than what they're looking for.

As you want

Are you suggesting that tea bagging is worse than tunneling/camping?

I’m confused by your comment. Not really sure what you mean here.

How do you know they just didn't take a couple months off?

---
When I was playing on PTB I found that NOED became stronger because survivors would leave totems alone if they didn't have inner strength. It's unlikely that everyone's going to have inner strength, and even if they did, it would take more time for totems to get destroyed because people are saving them for when they need them. So survivors who get generators done fast with very few injuries became more vulnerable because people were actively leaving totems alone so that other survivors could use them when they needed.
---
If anything, Inner Strength is not a response to NOED. It's trying to make totems more relevant to survivors *outside* of NOED and hexes.
---
No I'm suggesting that this guy dc every time something he don't like happens, which is worse
---
Thanks! And yeah, the map and perks were kind of a bad choice gameplay-wise.
---
Personally I stopped caring, I realized I'm trying to win and I'm not gonna lose just beause of camping some toxic kid. If they're SWF it's sometimes exactly what they want to do, nah I'm not giving those kids what they want.
---
I'm trying to do Otz's approach and just be ignore it. However sometimes, when it's full SWF stack and the whole game is full of teabaggs after every little fucking thing they do, constant flashlight clicking all the time meanwhile completely ignoring objectives... I mean what's enough is enough, but when I see they're only trying to trigger me and nothing more then yes, I camp and tunnel. I can be toxic too if they want me to. 
---
But just teabagging few times during a match because that's what the cool kids do, I ignore it. Especially when it's obvious that guy is trying to get me from others.
---
Tunneling isn't toxic. It's a tactic to remove a strong player, like one with a flashlight.
---
Looks great!  You did a good job on the face especially
---
Survivor drops pallet
---
I teabag the survivor from the other side
---
If the survivor teabags back they get to live

K I’ll do both:

At any time, slide to the left (right if left is blocked), however let out a **hee hee** audible from 20/10/5 meters

It’s such a thrill to know you. All survivors become confident to impress chu.  Survivors who work with you become 10% more efficient
---
I don’t listen to Jackson so that’s it
---
Killer I’ll do later because I’m busy
---
It combos with Save the Best for Last, Remember Me if you just give them a good smacking and then leave them alone the rest of the match, and Play With Your Food if you can find and chase them a lot.
---
No. It’s not the same one. All are just spronkled across the map
---
About 30 seconds max
---
i suggested no to take tbaggin seriously. exactly that! nothing less nothing more...
---
It's easier said than done. Every license holder is different and it's ultimately up to them how their characters are represented in this game.
---
I do expect Michael to get cosmetics before the likes of Freddy and Leatherface as he was the first license they ever obtained and they seemed to have been on really good terms with the license holder as evidenced with how high quality Michael was and still is. Especially with the 2018 movie being a big success I could easily see a 2018 Michael / Granny Laurie cosmetic set being added.
---
I'd freaking love a Granny Laurie set. I'd actually play Laurie if she had that.
---
Behavior was already on really good terms with the SAW license holders, and Ash (and Ghostface) were acquired with cosmetics already being a possibility. Every license holder is different and it's ultimately up to them how their characters are represented in this game.
---
&gt; Survivors are always looking for something to bitch about.
---
Survivors can see ping for 50 seconds and choose to lose. They like to bitch at the killer about that sometimes.

Why put Brutal at "good" if even yourself think it is abysmal, which it is.

I think you mixed Shadowborn and Lightborn. Lightborn is far better than Shadowborn since it actually does something for you.

He doesn’t eat them, but he has definitely consumed some blood considering.

But it’s a different thing for Clown entirely

"Power Rangers! Ready to strike you with their Head On!"

Cant be sure, obviously.

But these addons and the offering makes me think that he gets off on killing newbies with that setup.
---
Why it always be like that. I take off borrowed time, someone gets camped, I take off DS I get farmed etc etc. So sad.
---
I used to run it a bit, but I found myself wasting time searching one area against people who just Urban away from me. It's definitely good for finding that last person though.
---
His advice is actually very good. If you play survivor as a killer main, you learn what techniques they use that work against killers and what killer tricks work against survivors (because they worked against you). Same goes for survivors playing killer. Know your enemy
---
&gt; the entire killer playerbase to fuck off
---
They should fuck off. You shouldn't limit yourself to only one side.
---
Right, but that’s an assumption based on nothing really. There wasn’t even a mention of them D/Cing or any talk about it?
---
I’m just confused where you got the assumption and just why?
---
Also, to clarify, I don’t condone tea bagging. I’m a survivor main and I don’t care if you’re bad or good at the game. No reason for it really. Everyone starts somewhere. Not everyone can be great at everything. No reason to antagonize people and try to make them feel like shit because they’re not the best at a video game.
---
Honestly, shortly after joining DbD I thought that Nurse shouldn't have a lunge after blinking.  Without it, sure?  But a lunge ADDED TO her blink is ridiculous

You do realize if you take a couple months off your rank will most likely be 18 right?
---
Lol thank you so, so much
---
Oh, that's smart. Thank you
---
I actually had this thing happen to me once in reverse. I was playing a match as Ash I think and we had a Jake Park who was farming everyone off the hook without Borrowed Time. We were up against a Nurse and the first time Jake farmed someone she didn't realize, but after a bit she hard tunnelled him and camped him. She stood right beside the hook and would nod at us whenever we came near her, but shake her head and swing at the air if we went to unhook Jake.
---
Eventually Jake got sacrificed and the Nurse sort of just floated around and nodded at us whenever she came close. We'd run in front of her and sometimes she'd hit us but she'd never down us.
---
End game Jake said he'd report us and the Killer for working together since that was a bannable offence. The Nurse called Jake out for farming his teammates and told him that she felt bad for us (she had killed one person because of Jake's farming) so she decided to let us farm after killing Jake for being a dick.
---
Basically people who get mad at the Killer for farming are usually assholes.
---
That happen to me once and I just took of my headset and walked away from my controller.
---
That Claudette was probably confused at what happened.
---
The Operator and Slenderman are the same.
---
Marble Hornets just took their own take on his Lore.
---
In other posts he said that. I can provide you the quote if interested, isn't an assumption since I argued with this user before
---
These killer can still be stalled just not easily, I don’t see the problem with that.
---
If there is a 50/50 chance in most cases then there’s no issue here because if she guesses wrong her power goes on cd, you get distance, and can stall her or if she guesses right she gets a hit then her power goes on cd.
---
And yes I see that as a problem with the game not the killers themselves. With the way the game currently is I don’t see why they should be nerfed outside of some of nurses addons and spirit’s beads but that’s it. 
---
If people want these killers nerfed then they should complain stuff like gen times and map design because if these were improved then yes  these 2 killers would be too strong for a game in that state. This would also make more killers viable so people can stop facing the same killers over and over and over again at high rank and have more diversity
---
Lmao you complained about demogorgon basement
---
The lore goes much deeper than a dead mom. Good try though.
---
Awesome! I can barely draw a cat lol
---
Bonus points for the spoon-like addon.
---
Mori time.
---
Lol something crazy is I also find it hard to sketch cats it ends up being a mess but thank you
---
Damn you did really well for Brown addons Trapper. You really should've got the achievement; it's really stupid that people DCing will take pips away from you.
---
And on topic: yes Adept Killer achievements need to be way easier. It's ridiculous that all you have to do to get Adept Survivor is to sit in a locker all game and then take the hatch while you have to have pretty much a perfect match as Killer. Especially considering how hard it is to play Killer without Ruin or BBQ the Adept achievement should honestly just be getting 4 kills. Maybe even just 2 kills.
---
I've seen and commented on this picture once already, but idc I'll say it again
---
Hell. Yea.
---
*upvotes again*
---
Ping color = a good idea of what your ping is I don't see how it doesn't matter. I was at 80ms all pregame and did not lag once then I get hit from that far away? Yeah ok its a lag problem. Dedicated servers haven't improved it at all.
---
Someone straight up needs to post the hitbox wiremesh or whatever to end this once and for all

Ghostface used to cause me so much trouble but now I love him

Eh so do i, but when I'm at low rank after rank reset i enjoy a bit of dick slapping i don't get at higher ranks. And when it's Multiple people with prestige and flashlights i switch over to mains etc
---
Why? The Meg is much louder and easier to find.
---
They should and usually do. Especially for the Hallowed Blight I imagine you'll be able to get the petals again and get the old cosmetics as well as any new ones.
---
That being said last Chinese New Year they didn't allow you to get the Donkey David / Wolf Huntress mask so... But those weren't store cosmetics so...
---
Mid tier killer here as well. Sometimes I let the last survivor live if I've absolutely steamrolled the group (like they don't even have a single gen done) or if I can see for a fact they're a baby survivor. For baby survivors more often than not I'll slug them instead of a final hook as a "warning". Like an "I could have killed you here. Learn from this mistake". If nobody picks them up I hunt them down and pick up/drop until they can rush off again.
---
Other times it's because some of y'all do hilarious shit. Like one time I got an entire group of randoms, and it was 2 Claudettes left. One of them was about to be downed and she pointed in a direction. I went where she pointed and lo and behold, the other Claudette trying to blend in. I laughed my ass off that she totally sold out her other teammate, so after I death hooked the Claudette she pointed to, I took her to the hatch. I was amused.
---
Holy shit thank you for this
---
No worries, you're welcome!
---
I think Rancor is really fun because you get the chance to do the mori at the end, and it gives you the additional challenge of one survivor basically having a free Dark Sense so they'll be anticipating it the entire game.
---
If anything maybe it's an intermediate challenge perk once you're more confident in your ability to track survivors? You trade off a little bit of stealth for more information?
---
Idk, I use it on my Leatherface because I like that it ups the ante for everyone :D
---
And that’s the problem with calling every joke online a meme. It’s not necessarily a meme just a funny screenshot. Sure we could make it a meme but its not a meme yet.
---
Brings me back to my Amnesia: The Dark Descent days.
---
It depends, you shouldn't waste time trying to down the person who was unhooked. With perks like BT and DS it's almost always better to chase the person doing the unhooking
---
Obviously it's you who's just trying to find something to bitch about.
---
If you used your brain for just a few seconds you might have gotten to the point where you finally understand that that is exactly the problem. If I have green ping the whole time I'm waiting in lobby I should NOT be lagging once the round starts. And it's pretty easy to notice if it's just a problem on my side or if every Survivor is affected, i.e. the host is at fault.
---
I doubt OP is constantly getting frustrated messages from teams that already went in with a moon connection. And if that should be their problem, which is very unlikely, they could easily fix it by closing such lobbies.

Wraith is fine and I honestly don't know why people say he's so bad. Even with just a Brown addon and a Yellow addon (Bone Clapper + "The Ghost" Soot) he's extremely potent. And without addons he still has his core power.
---
I think you just don't know how to play Wraith I'm gonna be honest. I got to Rank 1 with Wraith using Yellow addons and was completely fine.

Essentially they're accusing you of manipulating your connection quality to gain an advantage. There are actual physical lag *switches* that will disable your connection when pressed which is where the term comes from, but there are also programs and other things to simulate the effect.

Because if she wants to be annoying, I can be too

Lol thanks

This is a list displaying the toxic perks to run into as a killer. The Perks aren't tiered within their tier and they also aren't tiered in power level. It is purely how toxic the perks can be at their maximum potential.
---
It was a rage quit. All too common. I understand the frustration but it's the first hook games not over...that's why I don't go immediately on gen till I look around the open areas first. Killers always immediately patrol especially if you're blowing gens that early.

I dropped him and let him wiggle out, and then caught him with PWYF. 
---
That wasn't the match I got the achievement on however. This guy was petrified enough the crows gave him up in the locker.

The 4th guy escaped through hatch, which I knew where it was and used Insidious to hide on, but the game gave him to exit instead of me grabbing him.

Yes.

Self Care is toxic? We're Going to Live forever?? Sole Survivor???

Nancy has better perks than Steve overall. That being said I'm personally far more interested in Second Wind than any of Nancy's perks. Chances are I'll be levelling Steve to 50, then Nancy to 40, then P3ing Steve.
---
I would play Demo but I need to get good perks on my Freddy and Trapper, and I can't really play Killer on my dorm room WiFi. :(

Nice!

It doesn't work for me that way at least

Killers are supposed to kill; it's kind of in the name. It's nice to be compassionate but you're not obliged to not do your only job due to some notion of "fair play."
---
Just shitty luck. Always try to unlock a perk on each bloodweb since it lowers the chance for a perk to show up.
---
If someone pallet stuns me and starts bagging depending on if I feel their trying to be a dick or playful I’ll just bag back then sneak away
---
Got called a "walking camper" for forcing a 3-gen situation and patrolling the same three gens for ages to make it impossible for the group to complete gens, hooking anyone who tried to sneak one and then abandoning the hook to recommence my gen patrol. In full knowledge that Overcharge and 3 dead gens would mean that I'd be able to get back to the Survivor and stop them completing the gen before I got back even if they got unhooked immediately.  
---
What do these Survivors want me to do? Just let them have the gens and 360 spiral vomit all over the floor?
---
What do you propose to change, then?

The worst part is that with the logo in the background this looks to be at some kind of event, not just him relaxing on a day off. Which means this is him dressed up and looking 'proper'?!
---
Tournaments aren’t viable in this game. It’s hugely unbalanced and would favor survivors with the killers playing only nurse unless you restrict that then it turns into a which survivor team can do better while a killer tries his or her hardest to get at least 1 kill.
---
If you're the last survivor and agree to farm you're forsure gonna get let go via exit gate.
---
I bet you get salty as fuck when you get tunnel and camped
---
Farming is nothing but beneficial as a killer, and sole survivor is basically garbage. Left Behind is so niche it'll rarely screw you over and Self care takes like 40 seconds to heal, that is very tasty time waste if you ask me.

Prove thyself the ultimate gen rushing perk isn't toxic at all?
---
Personally I’m excited about the demogorgon, but very unexcited by his perks. All of them are just too weak. Surge was iffy even before it got nerfed. Cruel punishment is bad on everyone except trapper and mind break is just bad. 
---
Fixes I would make: surge goes to 36 meters keeps the 60 sec cool down 
---
Cruel punishment changed back to cruel confinement. No other changes there
---
Mind break adds 10 seconds of exhaustion rather than 3
---
What did I say that wasn’t true? Even with the math you provided it’s not that big of a deal. At worst you’re adding 40 extra seconds. That’s nothing with 4 people sticking to the objective. You’re also forgetting the part where you’re wasting all that time not doing gens trying to find the totem. You’re wasting time not only looking for it, but also dodging the killer who will most likely try and protect the totem. Assuming 2 people are trying to look for it that’s 2-4 minutes wasted. You could have invested those 2-4 minutes into a gen.
---
Okay let’s go ahead and use your math. Let’s use the worst case scenario. 1 gen takes 120 seconds assuming 50% skill checks. Assuming everyone ignores ruin and do gens at the start, that’s 4 generators that can pop in 2 minutes. If 2 people are off looking for ruin, that’s only 2 gens that are going to pop in 2 minutes. The 2 players looking for ruin haven’t provided any value in those 2 minutes. Even if you manage to find the totem within 2 minutes, that’s 2 minutes of time that could have been put into gens. You’d be down to the last gen if you just stuck to the objective.
---
Yeah 100%...specially when you see that the guy has green ping in the lobby, I report them
---
Not right, pebble should be at DC level
---
That's what they want though. I'd rather play my game then theirs.
---
Dude, honestly, matchmaking is fucked. At rank 12 surv im constantly put with brown rank killers and survs. As rank 10 killer im constantly put with purple and red rank survs, but at least sometimes i get equal ranks. Never when i play survivor though, im always the best by a few ranks. Makes no sense.
---
You can probably notify your local cybercrime division over that. If you have a screenshot all the better, they are as good as done for. Its a crime, even if its done for something as little as games. The times when authorities considered that a joke are over. Just make sure you report it to whatever unit is responsible for cyber crime, and not the next police station, they wont give a fuck.

*sigh* Killers literally have videos of them camping and celebrating the game is losing their fanbase and this new update buffs killers anymore and you're sitting here defending camping whatever believe what you want to believe but once the game is dead that's a gg.
---
I give the hatch to characters who seem sweet and interesting, especially with unique or underused cosmetics. Usually I could tell they were immersed (in a good way, like they were having fun) and they played hard, and gave me great exciting chases. If I find that player at the end I want them to feel we made a great experience for each other and give them gratitude for playing genuinely and respectfully
---
If DS makes you DC, maybe don't tunnel so hard? Same with BT.
---
either that or throwing knives with a short blink like nurse (but way less powerful, shorter range, only one and can't go through walls).
---
his mori could freeze people in place too
---
Honestly im glad i waa able to share this frustration with a few people. Could not believe my eyes that match. Pretty sure every one was 16-18, killer included. Meanwhile im 12 like wtf
---
Its the feeling of defeat that boils inside some of the players. So they point fingers
---
Darth Maul started a twitch channel
---
There are no "toxic" perks.
---
yes ik
---
Thank you for the information, as obvious as it may seem, I had no idea of the seriousness. It’s still crazy that people would do that over a game.
---
Thank god
---
Well its a fast kill and they will get one less people so
---
And then I learned the counters so I’m not complaining about it anymore. Meanwhile you’re complain about survivor perks. MoM is op? Bodyblock is is toxic? Lol
---
&gt;\-Starting to unhook yourself and then stopping means its unsafe for a rescue, do this if you're getting camped
---
That so? I actually never even knew that and I have quite a bit of time. Thank you for this
---
Ain't no in-game chat on any version I read.
---
Need to use console party voice chat or discord.
---
I always take it as a survivor saying "do the thing"
---
For finding the start and end it’s great. But mid game when there’s still bout 3 gens everyone’s probably split up, so it’s not amazing. End game it’s great too
---
PC- I had a game glitch a couple days ago where when the killer hooked the the 2nd time, I got stuck sideways on the hook. No one was able to unhook me, I could not move, could not be healed, could not be downed, the hook timer did not go down, but I could still hear the hurt noises if the killer hit me, I didn’t DC from the game, and I could still see everyone completing the game around me. Freddie ended up killing everyone and began the end game collapse, but when it ended, we were unable to leave until someone DC’d from the game. I ended up giving in, not knowing how long it’d last, and I lost 4 pips because I had to DC from a glitch I couldn’t control.
---
Nea's one of my favorite characters so I usually give them the hatch just for that lmao. But only the lowkey chill ones
---
ok
---
It depends how the match played out.  If I notice someone truly doesn’t belong in my lobby (absolutely clueless kind of deal) I’ll give them the hatch as I figure their matches this far have been pretty rough.  Could be the entire group of survivors played like ass and one guy really carried it but couldn’t finish the match so he’ll get it.  Other times it’s just who annoyed me the least.
---
It’s like the DemoDog but more Corgi proportioned.
---
What I'm saying is that there aren't many ways you can have a stealth killer which tracks down people using their ability. We already have Wraith, Michael and Spirit - those ideas are taken, meaning that there isn't much room left for other ideas. I'm not saying "Oh you're wrong for coming up with a concept killer because we already have X killers in the game", I'm saying that it will be difficult to come up with an idea when the main conceivable abilities within your criteria set out in the post are already taken.
---
I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT BEING DDOSED MEANS IM FRIGHTENED
---
Yup, my fiancé was waiting a bit from the open hatch swinging to get last’s attention, and he ran by, went in, and messaged “Lmao that’s what you get for hatch camping loser”
---
His mori takes you to flavortown
---
Agreed completely. It should have some sort of functionality aside from BP boosting. Plus we'll make it is such a minor perk. I don't think I've seen anyone really use it
---
The concept that feral cannibal Lisa Sherwood has in fact stringent standards about food waste is endlessly funny to me, 10/10 great lisa meme
---
Whats wrong with self care?
---
Yeah, the 3 perks of demo aren't looking too good, the only decent looking one is surge and I think pgtw is better. 
---
I never watched stranger things so I'm not really as excited as everyone (demogorgon looks fun to play though), but nevertheless I'm glad that this chapter is coming. It's going to draw more players and people from both dbd to stranger things and vice versa. It's also creating a lot of hype, fun, memes and all that good stuff.
---
This is really great and the details are all spot on!
---
Lol
---
Lemme take a guess, gold is legacy?
---
Why is Stridor in great perks?
---
😭 I want that squad! Renamed killer main to Lord Zed.
---
We'll make it is pretty moderately used, I'd say. But still, both perks could benefit from being combined
---
The basement perks are good when used in conjunction. I use those with iron grasp and patrol the nearby gens , buss one down with pop, throw a tonic at stairs and move on.
---
The Entity would like to know your location.
---
Because you literally just took the word survivor and went "See, they don't care about killer", when yes, you do have an improved killer experience when you understand how survivor works and yes, you should play something else other than the same killer over and over again. You took something that can very easily mean "a broader gaming experience by trying new things" into "wow Devs don't care about killerz guyz".
---
Territorial is definitely better than Overwhelming Presence or Predator.  OVercharge is inefficient, Infectious is definitely better than good.
---
Notification perks are my bread and butter. Spies from the shadows, whispers , stridor, and iron maiden. Let em hide.
---
When you have no argument. Sounds like you play badly as killer then cry about everything they do and use being toxic
---
Seeing you’re probably a Spirit main and can’t even 4K with an Ebony Mori and addons, im probably right
---
Tell me when you can actually read
---
Plus buff killers? Welp that just put a giant cross to this discussion. You're blinded by your bias..
---
Yeah I get that but we don't always insta save. Usually we just wait until they are about to go into second hook
---
Got accused of face camping when literally the entire team would approach the hook as soon as I hooked someone. Not even joking. They didn’t wait even two seconds. Honestly, what do you expect me to do? I always immediately leave the hook after I’ve hooked someone but the survivors didn’t even wait for me to leave, they just started to swarm the hooked player. Do you expect me to just... ignore you while I’m still right there?
---
Not gonna lie, I really want to have a meme build of Second Wind, Inner Strength, Mettle of Man, and Adrenalie with an emergency med kit
---
That's one reason I made this discord group
---
I thought you all were about to jump into that locker
---
Nice
---
It's not a sure thing, but there's usually sales around US Thanksgiving.
---
It means that if a killer wants a specific survivor to have a bad time, he’s gonna have a bad time and there’s nothing to do about it. Facecamping people because you’re angry they took along time to catch isn’t an imaginary rule, it’s you being a salty dickhead. Survivors can teabag all the want but as killer you can easily just tunnel a specific guy all game and make sure he’s dead. If you can’t do that then you aren’t very good on the first place. A lot of killers mistake toxicity for outplaying. If they aren’t teabagging, emoting or hate messaging you, they aren’t being toxic.
---
As a special mori he rubs your face against his sweaty stomach until you die
---
360s are harder on pc they just look fancy with keyboard and mouse and 60fps.
---
360 on console is easy because of the analog sticks.
---
I can read unfortunately because your bullshit is giving me a headache. Also somebody doesn't pay attention.
---
Good point, I didn't think about that.
---
***D E M O C O R D O N***
---
that's why you big brain and always run the both of them
---
You knock them all down and hook them. They all Kobe at once and form a giant locker monster.
---
If the killer sucks, play more conservative and don't get seen/caught. Getting caught and then camped by a "bad" killer still means you got caught. 
---
Really good killers who will always win a chase vs you will rarely camp you. If they do, who cares.
---
No.
---
Well it's better than anything I could do.
---
I wonder if there will be a sequel or seems like they’re putting so much out for this game, I’m really happy this game has been going for years despite me just getting into it last year.
---
*\*Sigh\*, \*Unzips pants\*.*
---
 through what program did you do it?
---
There are 69 upvotes on this post and I dont want to ruin that 😳
---
It’s useful for tracking, and it counters Iron Will which is arguable one of the strongest survivor perks (I’m a bit biased because I always use it). It’s obscenely strong on Spirit because survivors will have a much harder time avoiding a phase.
---
&gt;Ping color = a good idea of what your ping is I don't see how it doesn't matter. I was at 80ms all pregame and did not lag once then I get hit from that far away? Yeah ok its a lag problem. **Dedicated servers haven't improved it at all.**
---
??????
---
Dedicated servers are not even live and even if they were, this would still be a thing.
---
Again, on DBD "Green" Ping could be from 1 to 99 and anything above 50ms is not impossible for the killer to have a little advantage.
---
Lol I know I was lucky to get it
---
Why the hell is an 11 years old kid playing dbd?
---
And why the hell is noone else questioning this?
---
So you want an easy free unhook? Yeah seems fair for the killer
---
I get what you're saying, and I agree.  However, having a camper usually means I max out lightbringer and unbroken, but I can kiss my altruism and chase points goodbye (please note:  *every fucking time I run borrowed time + decisive strike I somehow get in a match with a killer who is not a camper*.)
---
So campers me salty even when I'm not the one being camped
---
Flashlight
---
Same lol
---
30% isn’t that much and you can probably still grab the survivor, plus it only works when the exit gates are powered
---
Replace Nurses with Pop Goes. Honestly I use Pop goes on all killers because it’s so good.
---
So...tunnel the player that had a good flashlight save? Good way to let Meg reheal and the other two work gennies.
---
Juked too late. Silly lad.
---
Not my fault if you can't read or respond properly!
---
Idk why either lol
---
Are you the pink power ranger???? I literally think I played a match with you... either the person was pink power ranger or black power ranger I can’t remember haha
---
Guess I'm an Ace main now.
---
Survivor: Shaggy from Scooby Doo
---
Mu-ha-ha!
---
it counters Iron Will, which is a big deal for spirit and Nurse
---
making our country proud
---
Wraith mains exist?
---
because it still gains you some distance, which some killers cherish
---
Oh, really? What about Halloween?
---
Perks that fit perfectly with the meta, but because they don't show instant results barely anyone uses them.
---
I think this is too high brow for me
---
Yes, but the bullying did a number on them
---
wh... how is Object the best perk in the game.
---
I had a Hag match where the survivors 3 genned themselves too, and the hatch was in the middle of two of the gens. I didn’t get any hate messages, but they were surely pissed as one of them just run straight into me while injured
---
...or you can have good memory and it's a good 10 seconds not doing gens, most people dont go back for their items any way.
---
Like being afk?
---
I feel bad for the 18
---
Ok ok.. I thought so
---
Add a pinky in his left hand delicious!
---
Which is the exact reason why it needs to stay change the hatch not the key otherwise the EDC needs to change even if you removed all keys we need compensation for a item maybe a trap
---
Sloppy and Bloodhound aren't that great themselves. Shadow born counters most corner mindgames and helps Nurse a bunch.
---
It isn't run as often as it seems, and it's not a great perk. If a killer wants to play an entire match with 3 perks for a reward that survivors can pre-emptively negate, let them. I run NOED in endgame builds and it actually goes off about 50% of the time. Of those times, it's usually cleansed after the first down. NOED is as bad as survivors make it.
---
Tinkerer isnt too good tbh. When it pops the gen gets done before you even get there 99% of the time
---
As neither survivor or killer main.  I can see why people do it.  It’s not fun to go against. And it’s not exactly a fun way to play either but at the same time.  All the survivors want to do is survive. And the killers ONLY objective.   Is to stop that.
---
To be honest, I’d farm at that point. You’re both fucked as far as BP and pipping because three jackasses decided to quit, so try and make the most of it.
---
have you used tinkerer on Billy? It's godly on billy it's an easy instadown and prevents a gen from getting done.
---
yea... and that does soo much..
---
I'm doing the same thing as a newer player, but for the new bloodweb changes.  All my chars are at 39 or 40 with all but one node needed to level so I can get the perks I want more easily.
---
Getting Evil Incarnate is probably my proudest achievement in the game tbh, shits hard especially when the last survivor tries to force a down.
---
You don't even need insidious, it's that bad.
---
I was facecamped in the basment by a bubba and 2 of my team stood at the bottom of the stairs teabagging him and then tried to unhook me....
---
I always use basic build on him bc hes already godly
---
Wasn't this month's ago maybe even a year? I don't think anybody cares anymore.
---
Turn up sensitivity if looking up is too slow bcuz it should be the same unless you are slow to react?
---
I mainly play survivor, and I can perfectly agree with that. I want to ask what you think about a scenario I came across though:  
---
Killer running BBQ+C and the last survivor didn't show up on it when he hooked the second to last survivor. Killer in question already checked the area and did not see or hear last survivor nor see any scratch marks... Killer then chooses to go stand on nearby (15m away max?) hill overlooking the hook area until my struggle timer ran out.. then starts looking around again  
---
Second to last survivor called him a camper, he claims it wasn't camping because he didn't see last survivor on BBQ+C and so he "must have been nearby" (Note again: he already checked the nearby area and found no sign of that other survivor in the vicinity). He disconnected before someone could point out hiding in lockers is a thing too...  
---
So no judgement here, but I wanna hear your opinion on this
---
People def go back for their items, esp purple flashlights, instaheals, and keys
---
I try to think of it like, yeah there is no "rulebook," but my rule of thumb is EVERYONE should be having fun in the trial. If I'm playing wraith, and someone is in a corner of a gen where I could easily box them in, I uncloak, watch them realize their mistake, and give them a five second headstart. I want people to get better when they play and learn from little mistakes, not discourage them from playing against certain killers. It's more fun to be a nice killer tbh.
---
Im fairly new to digital art, any of your opinions and tips will help, Thanks.
---
Why did my comment get downvoted
---
Why would swf attempt to speak to you ingame like you can hear them?
---
"Rarely".
---
1/6 games for me it happens. 
---
It's so bad that every game I start, I try to emote. Because if you cant emote, you wont be able to see progress bars, heal yourself, activate perks, or escape via gate.
---
I don't like key resellers besides humble. (Which is "Legit") Very shady, and there's absolutely no accountability if you get a non-working key.
---
It's a really nice drawing , especially for someone so young. 
---
But, and of course there has to be a but, I can't help but wonder how you know the Clown. I assume you're playing the game, and I just gotta be the person that's asking the critical question 'why?' here. 
---
Call me old-fashioned, but I don't think a game that's rated 18+ should be played by a 11 year old. A game where people get brutally eviscerated, eaten, sawed in half, hooked until they die, crawling on the ground until they bleed out... you get the idea.
---
Yes, I know it's fictional. Yes, I know it's not really graphic because the only thing that's happening is some blood flying around, even when being sawed in half by William of the Hills. But I also know that children tend to have a -lot- of imagination and can't always see that fiction is fiction. We all had a phase in our childhood where we were scared of fictional things, no matter how unrealistic or stupid they may seem now.
---
Allowing, or even showing a 11 year old, this kind of violence and gore... I can't approve of that. Sorry. I'm not saying that 18+ rating should be strictly observed, as humans develop at different rates, but 11 years seems very, very young to me.
---
As a parent, I would enjoy a drawing of a rainbow with unicorns and flowers or something like that much more.
---
^(Truth be told, I fucking love unicorns and rainbows and flowers.)
---
I like Spine Chill because there's no cooldown and I can, 90% of the time, tell if the killer is heading towards the generator I'm working on, even better with tier 3 of course. I never used Premonition because it can go off when I don't need it to.
---
It’s not like I’m sitting there and won’t leave my patrolling area, If i see a survivor   i’m gonna chase them unless I see another trying to make a save, and If I don’t see any survivors after a bit I would leave my patrolling area
---
I'm guessing you don't use lower tier killers in high rank games. Survivors dictate the pace, not the killer. There is absolutely nothing preventing survivors from going safe pallet to safe pallet while teammates are spread out on gens.
---
We will sacrifice your newborn
---
I'm on the mid-twenties and I can only draw stick figures. Keep at it if it's your passion, you'll go a long way. But remember, there will always be people that will tell you otherwise. Gain enough experience and skill to prove them wrong, this way you'll gain more confidence.
---
it wasnt on the website
---
Seems to be a general rule that if you get hooked before you earn enough BP for it to matter just DC and go to next game.
---
I’m still confused what happened
---
It a squad of baby dwights🤣
---
Night theme hurts my eyes, personally
---
This was over a year ago
---
yes
---
Sigh *unzips*
---
That doesn’t seem right. I went from survivor rank 8 to 13
---
nicE
---
Its all part of how they keep you playing. You have to play every month to keep your rank, so you never want to stop
---
This. This is art.
---
How is it overrated?
---
Leader is a great team perk, especially when you are in a swf group.
---
Hmm. Think I’m starting to understand why the Clown collects fingers.
---
No. Not a lag switch.
---
How did it go. You win?
---
Thx, that’s just after rank reset, but coldwind farm is a hard map for myers, and i got sweaty when there was only one gen left
---
It's not as Godlike or "the best perk in the game" as some people say it is.
---
How did you do that if someone is still alive tf???
---
So... Pardon me but let me get your logic straight on this Hayden...  
---
You are wasting ***your own time and resources*** stalking this dude on every reddit comment he makes because you think he's crappy due to a comment he at some point in the past about him DCing in matches.  
---
I don't care for DCing teammates myself but damn... must be pretty worthy crap for you to dedicate so much of your life to him. :) That's all I gotta say.
---
I would LOVE to see jeepers creepers! Maybe a flying ability or something?? (Obviously with limitations and stuff) but that’d be so interesting and terrifying haha. A farm map wouldn’t be the best idea since we already have that basically but yeah! 
---
A tether would be soooo fascinating and cool! Like a tethered survivor that can disguise themselves as a regular survivor for a short moment to trick the real ones?? Iconic and so sneaky lol I love that
---
Seems to be a consistantly wanted gamemode but I don't think they'll add it.
---
Would be cool though, I mostly play with a friend and sometimes he just gets burned out of the surv games and goes to play killer &gt;.&lt;
---
Except all the cookies are poison.
---
The box too.
---
The screen was just before the last icon showed the survivor getting killed, myers just dropped him on the ground
---
Late reply I know but I play Hag quite a bit and I agree she's fucking annoying. I hate playing against her. The biggest issue is she abuses survivors stupidity against themselves. Survivor runs up to the hook and sets a trap off unhooking you? You get tunneled. You unhook someone? They run away, set a trap off you crouched over, and YOU end up getting hit. Oh and the Hag also has Make Your Choice.
---
This has been posted way too god damn much
---
No offense but I don’t see how this would do anything. Killer would just kick the gen and look for survivors as always. Would the point be so when the generator is 20% or lower it appears as not worked on?
---
Ah I see, congrats
---
But it was Freddy
---
Level up Claudette, and once you get to the level specified for self care you can unlock it to show up in other character's bloodwebs.
---
Thx, that shit was annoying asf and no fun
---
How will I know when I've reached said level?
---
We need him to look like Roadhog
---
Rank 8* stay Golden Piss boi
---
hopefullu ur mates are doing something too.
---
"doing gens, you?"
---
Check her bio, it'll have the character's specific perks and what level it's unlocked at.
---
It’s not working
---
25 FPS a average on low and 0% :(
---
Killer: Mr Hyde Survivor: Dr Jekyll
---
Okay thanks, that's really helpful to know lol
---
Both sides are entitled, I once saw a killer main write about huntress being too hard to play and not needing to reload hatchets.
---
Stick to your own depressed life kiddo. Your attitude makes your life seem hopeless. Rip.
---
Spirit fury
---
Yeah the flick is your best bet then. Worst case you can slug and go after flashlight dude, or use franklins.
---
Are you on PC?
---
Alright will do, thank you!
---
u/ZombieRanpage56
---
But the demogorgon only plays with the survivors head like a dog plays with a chewy toy O:
---
Alright, thank you in information!
---
"piss boi"
---
okay.. now I feel bad since you're not even a teenager
---
Very epic lmao moment
---
u/ZombieRampage56
---
Yeah nah chief
---
welp, I really don't like nationalists. They are the kind of people I wanna get rid of, like neetsi and fascists, they are the same to me. Garbage
---
Why did this get downvoted? Was it because he didnt say he should get a gun lmao
---
Spirit fury is garbage.
---
It saves you 5 seconds after losing you 6 seconds, in an ideal chase, unless you LOSE a chase but built up the tokens. That's with enduring.
---
Brutal strength is better, because it saves you 3 seconds per pallet, on its own.
---
Thanks.
---
Real horror movie shit
---
When the baby dweet keeps trying to 360 and it never works
---
The idea is to level each character to like 40 and you can unlock their specific perks to show up in any character's blood web. Claudette has Self Care as one of her speciality perks. When you get her up to somewhere around 30-40 an orange version of her special perks will start showing up in her blood web. When you buy them, it unlocks the ability to find those perks in another character's blood web.
---
Ive been playing since summer 2018, how many daily rituals can you stockpile? Just 3, or..? And for how long?
---
It's the Nebula Alternative pack from r/PerksByDaylight, which also hosts other custom icons
---
There goes my hopes and dreams.
---
Imagine telling an ELEVEN year old kid this, when he’s just proud of his drawing. Get out of here man.
---
Some survivors think otherwise, that was the whole point of this meme
---
Yes, it needed changed because we wouldn’t want killers to come across as evil or anything.
---
Nebula Alternative which you can find on r/PerkbyDaylight
---
Aren’t perks that show you where others are kinda useless as a swf?
---
Pretty sure they said they wouldn't do this, but they also said there would be no clowns
---
You missed the Outsiders reference ohh poop lol. This discussion is over. You got your opinion I got mine.
---
I agree with this guy, OP. Freddie is super fun to play imo, especially with dream pallets. Gets them every time.
---
game over
---
What is it in euros?
---
Wraith is actually op against 15-20 ranks and it’s hilarious but if they ended up buffing him the low Ranks would complain a lot so
---
How so? Hag actually eats people. The new killer just breaks their neck and spits them put. It's pitiful. The clown has more in common with hag than the new killer ever will.
---
same. just waiting for my last ritual :D
---
I called him out yeah. I was tilted, especially after getting that sweet sweet kobe. I just thought his reason for it was funny tbh.
---
Obviously shouldn't have sent a msg since there's really no point but I did it without thinking ngl. Salty survivor checking in.
---
When i got blinded i was like where the fuck did this jane come from. Thats me.
---
true, the only really strong addons are the paint Brush and those chains
---
Who cares? If you ask alot of people on here, if the killer is playing the game then he's being toxic and unfair.
---
nice
---
WTH
---
I love when I see a crouched survivor hiding around the hook I'm headed towards with their buddy.
---
It's so juicy when I get called camper in postgame chat under those circumstances.
---
Surprisingly I've had this happen way too many times and I can say about 5 or 6 times have been after the hatch was closed. Each time i fell off the map, i'd spawn right back on the clsoed hatch. sadly i didnt have a key any of those times :(
---
Jigsaw's Baptism
---
Press the active ability button to **jump**
---
Takes a few second after the 3rd person leaves/dies
---
It's really cool! Do you plan on colouring/rendering it in?
---
I also saw you said you were going to do more... I'd love to see a drawing of The Legion (just one character) 
---
Great work!!
---
was playing a game and had a jane farm me off immediately 2 times, without BT. I said "thanks for the farms jane" and she replies with "np, you were dead anyway" well no shit i got farmed twice and downed immediately. i had zero chance to begin with. :(
---
I’ve never been called out for that, but I always sigh when I’m walking away from a hook and another survivor sprints up to it. At least let wait until there’s a chance I might not see you.
---
consoles can't change their names sadly :(
---
She oinked herself to heaven.
---
Weirdest toxicity- 4 man swf on the swamp. Hid the whole match, didn’t go for gens. As soon as I found one they would DC. Had to find them one by one, took like a half hour. Dumb trolls.
---
Similar to you I got “reported!” Once by the worst 3 man swf ever. As soon as I would down one the other two would swarm in and try to heal the person on the ground, not even give me a chance to pick them up before they were right there. After I quickly wiped them out I let the last Dwight, who I could tell was trying and not with them, do a gen and get the hatch. I was then accused of working together with the Dwight...
---
literally no one said that
---
Shadowborn is bae on nurse wtf 😡😩
---
When doing so, every survivor in the injured or normal state will instantly get downed and hooked.
---
You still get the stun effect though. Stuns cancel abilities.
---
just disconnect
---
Idk man.
---
You’re welcome dude. I’m 12 and I can’t draw for shit, keep drawing tho cause you have a talent.
---
A bit exposed for my tastes
---
sure its definitley possible as we see with many other Games.
---
This. Precisely this. If I actually want to make BP I have to load killer, wait 5 minutes or more and then run through a 5-10 minute game to do it all again and I still make more BP (2-3 times as much) than if I play survivor in that same amount of time. I don't even really like playing killer.
---
They can't finesse with the ranks, cause this games matchmaking is so jacked up that it regularly puts a rank 16 with purple and red ranks. And if a survivor gets downed, the killer shouldn't have to always fight to get the down, then fight again to just get the hook. Wiggling out of a killers grasp shouldn't be a thing that happens almost every game. If you want hooks farther apart, use the offering that does that
---
Killer is stressful enough as is, making the distance between hooks bigger is going to add more pressure and make playing killer even more horrible.
---
to think if she didn't stay to teabag she would've gotten out (and even if the bug happened she'd be able to walk off the ledge and respawn inside the map and stand a chance)
---
Unfortunately a Jeepers Creepers chapter in DBD will never happen. The devs have stated that they don't want anything to do with Victor Salva due to him being, well, [a literal paedophile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Salva).
---
Jesus Christ it’s Billy Bourne
---
Oh, I had to convert the file to Zip before I downloaded it, I’m sorry for not being clear
---
Peanits thinks hooking a person, getting someone else in a chase, downing that person, hooking that person, coming back to that first person aaaand you get DS'ed. StOp TuNnElInG
---
The stranger things chapter bc you get the most content
---
Big maps are quite easy to know where you are exactly, and communicate that.
---
On small maps like lery's and the game you'd be better of with bond.
---
In practice it is quite unlikely that you get the aura of all three other survivors before you get hooked. And even if you could, once you get hooked it's gone.
---
I'd only take aftercare when playing solo, and feel the need to see if the others are sitting in corners self caring half the game.
---
Glad someone else my age likes the game. Great art also!
---
It’s definitely more, even if it gets cleansed within the first minute of the game every good skill check they hit in the first minute adds time, and the entire time one or more survivors spent just looking for it is wasted.
---
Hello there!
---
The noises you make were the funniest shit
---
This is just a receipe to increase slugging.
---
If there's no hooks nearby, the killer will simply drop you and watch you bleed to death or die from EGC. 
---
Choose the lesser of the evils, friend.
---
So you do that too but if someone does it for you it's creepy :D good to know even your posts are not so bright seeing these comments 😘
---
Huntress likes sloppy butcher
---
They were already further apart before and it was a pain in the ass. It's fine how it is. Playing as a killer is all about time management and adding more time for something so mundane is a bad idea.
---
I completely forgot what that addon does
---
I had a game an hour ago where everything (gens, totems, healing, exit gate) all appeared to be halfway done. Obviously they weren't, the progress bar stayed at full until whatever I was doing was actually completed.
---
Buggy ass game lmao
---
Or a furry. Well, I guess either one is still dedication to the craft.
---
What?
---
Yes!
---
Thank you for the information. I'll have to see when that is in my time. :)
---
Its fine to patrol as long as you actually go check gens
---
the new Kate skin. imo
---
Id say about 11 PST. Somewhere around there
---
It's sad to see the downvotes on this post. I fully agree.
---
Wrong, it’s Jake and hook
---
TuNeLlInG iS a (BeSt) StRaTeGy
---
Looks great. Keep it up!
---
I don’t understand how survivors are op. Sure maybe once you’ve sunk 2000 hours into the game, grind yourself up to red rank and be like, a god at it.
---
But the rest of us struggle - especially with the Hex: Ruin and BBQ &amp; Chilli builds people are running right now. It’s just one fuck you after another.
---
And to keep on track with the topic, I’ve Mainer survivor, I only have about 150 hours, but I can say the amount of times I’ve successfully wiggled free from a killers grasp? Under 5. 5 times out of however rounds that I played.
---
Hooks can entirely be slightly distanced. There are literally hooks everywhere.
---
That's not worth internet points.
---
That's worth real money!
---
Logically yes.  I’m not encouraging it though.
---
Only addons worth running is the ultra-rares, the various reduce action speed and drawings.
---
Pallets are fun every now and then but not quite as good as his base snares. 
---
You can easily play Freddy with no add-ons. Put on PGTW and Discordance and you'll be good.
---
Playing GTA as a kid was fun, while it kind of is bad parenting, it is nice to have those priveleges anyways. Nothing can go wrong in getting anger out.
---
*As a billy main* try that with the clown or a none movement/ trap killer 😂
---
WTF? On the first one, DBD Hide and Seek edition I suppose. That’s weird. 
---
I wonder if they go into the game planning on spamming report just trying to mess with people. It sounds really similar to the 2 that got me. I think they were SWF and they not played really poorly. Jane tried to flash light my back while I picked up Bill, while she was injured.
---
I got 600 hours in total over the last year, but given that the achievement was added with Ash and that I didnt have that much time due to University.....probably pretty decend
---
Oh crap I didn’t even notice! OP that was a nice touch!!
---
That's nothing special, it's like on PC
---
well you can have opinions i’m not here to yell at anyone for it. the Jane thing? i think its cause we don’t have any other character that shares or is even close to her body type, plus people like curvy or t h i c c women lol (i don’t call her fat though but thats just me)
---
Can’t wait for dedicated servers so when play like crap they can’t blame connection but they will however find something or someone else to blame
---
Oh crap I didn’t even notice, what an excellent touch—well done OP!!
---
Dont downvote me for starting a discussion hahaha damn.
---
Anyway, to a killer, hook or slug means the same thing. One survivor is busy dying and another survivor needs to go help them, resulting in two survivors not doing gens.
---
The devs most likely will not increase hook distance or decrease hook spawns. They created perks to run if you want to try to wiggle out and buffed sabotage.
---
Wiggling is not a mechanic for survivors to actually get out (as bad as that seems.) 
---
It's more of "dont end up in the basement every hook" prevention. If you want to escape killer grasp run an escape killer grasp build but even then no promises if you haven't sabo'd. The killer is meant to hook and kill you. Why would they make the killer's one objective even harder? Lol
---
Please do—I think it’s safe to say I speak for everyone else when I tell you: we would love to see a colorized/finished product :D
---
Did you happen to have a link to where they formally stated that or a video? Thanks!
---
The one true big brain of the community.
---
No one is talking about it? Are you high?
---
Billy has always gotten shafted. Behavior seems to think that Billy should only have "wacky funny" costumes. And they're all dogshit aside from the Hollowed Blight which is great (aside from the paints).
---
This is why I set my messages and profile comments on Steam to friends only. I ain't got the time or heart to be reading hate comments over a game.
---
I mean, to be fair, I was playing DOOM at 9-10 (back when it had to be booted via DOS prompt—fml I’m old)
---
I didn't downvote you, I suppose someone else disagrees with you tho.
---
I mean, they already made it harder.  For example, they created the hook mechanic and made them one distance from each other as opposed to a closer distance.  Changing a single metric in the game (average hook spawn distaince) is a modest suggestion and I've offered a number of reasons it would be more exciting for both sides.  Your response is that you like easy hooks.
---
LOL that dog face
---
dont know, I prefer the more average sized women lol. not the sick looking models, but also not thick ones
---
Tbh, I'd actually like this unironically
---
Wow really?  I get basically nothing for a bad survivor game, and a good one barely gets me as much as a bad killer game.  I'm not that good at being survivor though, my looping abilities are shit.
---
While we’re at it, make Trapper’s traps not lock me in place since it gets me killed and I don’t like it.
---
I like Agitation, Iron Grip, Mad Grit, and Thrilling Tremors (Ghost Face's fuck gens perk if it's the wrong name) as a sort of Grappler Perk set for when I play KYF.
---
Ha ha
---
If they add handicaps I’m saying bye bye to Nea
---
This is easily done with tombstone + hair + PWYF
---
I’ve seen people do that on roblox before and it looks and sounds fun
---
Literally everyone has been talking about it
---
 Just means less snacks for the Hag &gt;:(
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂R/WOOOOOOOOOOSH 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
What platform are you?
---
Nice job
---
Credit to u/enderex040 for going out of his way to send me the template.
---
\*holds R1 and tries to imagine what mundane timers reliant on risk/reward to be interesting looks like\*
---
Aw thank you!! :,)
---
For brown medkits or medkits with a insta heal on it that means they can't even get 1 heal off of it anymore, not to mention the survivor can no longer use insta heal cheese in the current chase to give themselves 3 health states mid chase. It is a decent counter to flashlight saves, it stops any toolbox that isn't commodious or a yellow toolbox from even repairing 1 full gen, you can deny hatch escapes with keys, since keys are pretty hard to just notice on the ground the survivor might lose track of it or spend extra time picking it up.
---
Not to mention survivors wasting time to go back for their items in the first place is still an extra form of stall time if they actually care about said item.
---
It isn't the best perk, and obviously is technically useless if survivors don't have items but it does have some use against survivors who bring 4 really solid items into the match.
---
It really is! You got a User?
---
He can take it all in with lungs like that...
---
Makes body blocking a lot more effective too. This is just a horrible idea all around
---
That's different given that the point of a bear trap is to trap you. I'm pretty sure the main point of hag's trap is to both notify her of your location and allow her to teleport, giving her map pressure.
---
Omg I cant spell
---
Thanks man!
---
Nice.
---
 Agreed!!! This mechanic is so annoying and sometimes I think it should happen only if you're not in a chase to keep the spooky element of it
---
Try playing killer and you won't be saying the same thing
---
What are you trying to say about David?
---
Yeah but I don’t have the game just seen videos. The next time I go on my pc I’ll message u straight back and tell you my steam account
---
Lol your negativity is hilarious glad you liked the clip mate
---
Thanks
---
if hag doesnt pull your camera towards the trap then you would just run by the trap and never get hit. hag would become trash tier. i know its stupid but id rather not ruin the killer
---
That'd honestly be a better change than what I'm proposing.
---
PC- yesterday while the counter for the end of the game was about to end, the killer (Freddy) caught me. At the same time that he threw me on the hook (or one second before) the timer ended and he threw me on the floor, but no spike came up. I was unable to move and we were unable to leave until I ended up disconnecting. If he attacked sometimes my body would float upwards
---
Sorry to assume it was you, my friend &lt;3 
---
But of course I want easy hooks. Nothing irks me more than when I down a survivor and they wiggle off (from just bad spawns not because of perks or sabo or I used the hook.) In high ranks you lose your momentum when someone gets free and it can cost you a game if your up against a good SWF.
---
I think some maps may need some work like some Macmillans when there are three hooks within 10 feet of each other but I dont think it needs to be so the killer wont reach a hook if he has already used one in the area. 
---
I think it should be changed just enough so two hooked survivors wont be proxy camped super easily. Please dont take away my one task of hooking boys though ; -( lol
---
Bad things I cannot abide.
---
ive never seen it
---
Let him rearm a trap on the ground without having to pick it back up and reset it !!11!
---
when they ask "where is ghostface" but never "how is ghostface" ;(
---
I hate when I hook a survivor and see a swarm of red marks all around.
---
Why yes i will thoroughly check the whole area because i see at least 2 of you rushing the hook before I even make it 30 steps away. then i get accused of camping when they are wasting time showing me they are around instead of hiding well and waiting for me to leave.
---
Understand, but literally watched a Hillbilly hook someone, walk a tiny bit away, and stand still staring at the hook to instantly chainsaw anyone who came by when there were still 5 gens to be done.
---
Hag traps would be severely less efficient. She benefits off of the survivor being disoriented, that’s kind of the point of the traps. 
---
If you could just run through without any effect, then you could keep running the same course you were on without being phased. Yeah, she can still teleport, but you’d be long gone and she’d have to catch up. Her traps lock your camera for a reason. 
---
It’s basically like asking for Billy’s chainsaw to be used solely for getting across the map, but sike, there’s no chain on it, lol.
---
I’m not recommending it. I’m just stating the perks most people use. Let’s not fool ourselves into saying survivors who have more experience haven’t been deranking and people who played a lot in the past with more experience are now just getting back due to ST chapter. I understand NOED is annoying. But I also don’t want to see matchmaking being abused and people who deranked to get paired with new killers and loop them for many gens. They don’t get to learn that easily when played like that. New players won’t have leveled the hag up to get her teachables on top of other good perks. So NOED yes helps them when they don’t have a lot of teachables yet. I never use it. But from a new killer perspective, I get it.
---
Wow, this is actually really amazing! You write very well!!
---
Her main power from traps is her auto aim exiting the teleport animation. It wouldn't hinder her to trash tier at all since this ONLY hurts survivors when in chase. This would technically nerf her, but I still think it's better than making basically any chase a down if she has a phantasm in the middle of a pallet. 
---
Someone recommended that it only be outside of chase, which I agree more for than my original claim.
---
Holy shit. I just unlocked a ultra rare Mori thing, and I just got done eating 3 people and sacrificing the other
---
If you play "optimally" you should get about 20k per match (not with offerings).
---
You wont get as much as killer's 32k for a perfect game but it's still quite a bit.
---
Just always bring a bloodpoint offering and you should have no problem getting points as survivor ;- )
---
Hag’s traps making you turn to them are an intended part of the power. They help her in a chase, not just by letting her teleport but by hindering the survivor if placed correctly. Removing it would weaken her high level play significantly.
---
They always release patch notes on patch day.
---
Jake is sabotaging a hook somewhere.
---
Im confused of what you mean by this
---
Xbox! My gamertag is the same as my reddit name!
---
To an extent his advice is good, people who complain are people that have done this already also I don't believe he said that with advice in mind. I think he had more of a 'take a brake from the game to refresh yourself'. Which still isn't bad advice in all fairness but telling people that to make their game more fun don't play their game doesn't look really good.
---
Thank you.
---
I never once show mercy. Never. The absolute most I will ever show is maybe not slugging when I'm in a good position. That's it. Survivors never show mercy and always act like they're the greatest players in the universe when they throw down a safe pallet so fuck them. The fucktards can do whatever they want but I have to play by their little rules? No. Fuck that.
---
Wait its an 18+ game but demogrogon dosent even eat the heads off survivors? I thought it was rated t, thats lame
---
Probably, i havent seen anyone
---
I also got accused of cheating today.
---
By a baby dwight didn't know what NOED was.
---
Servers need more work so they’re not coming. Bloodweb and Party system is looking good to launch.
---
Please be ironic
---
Learn to take criticism, this is exactly why you have to self promote on Reddit to get attention...
---
"High level play" you mean it would make it so I don't have a 100% chance of dying on a pallet with a phantasm there. Every chase with a hag is literally just hoping there isnt a hag trap as no matter what you do, you're fucked. It's different with trapper as you can still sometimes run around the trap, dead hard over the trap, or see it and avoid it. With hag the second it pops, you're just instantly down. Yes you could deadhard when the trap pops, but if hag takes the trap after your dead hard, she has a free down on you cause of her auto aim.
---
Had Huntress last me an entire match last night. Barely got 1 gen done before I got 12 hooks and ended the match
---
You guys get Dead Hard to work?
---
Nothing about david personally, just about him being shirtless
---
I mean "it's me" says EVERYTHING gets slowed so it would slow your run speed down 9% too.
---
I did this last night to a Myers that then proceeded to Tunnel and Facecamp me
---
Keep hatin :)
---
1000 ping
---
I play survivor and killer often. Survivors are very strong, no need to buff them more. Yes as a baby survivor you get killed easily, but that's something the game could change otherwise
---
Well, every killer sans Nurse, and maybe Hag and Pig, need add-ons. 
---
"Billy doesn't need good add-ons! REE!" Okay, good luck trying to get that guy as he bee-lines it to that nearby pallet or window. 
---
The Paintbrush is amazing for him because (1) it eliminates the ability for them to escape Dream State by failing skillchecks and(2) it forces them off of gens if only for a little bit. The action speed add-ons, specifically Swing Chains and the Jump Rope, are good even if they're not coupled with Thanatophobia. It's just another thing that buys you a little bit of time and encourages them to waste time getting out of dream state. Fake Pallets are garbage. The Green and Yellow Drawings are okay. It's funny; Freddy has some of the best and worst add-ons in the game. Paintbrush and Swing Chains slows them down and you didn't have to do anything. Even Swing Chains + Jump Rope still slows them down and all you need to do is just hit them. No other Killer's add-ons do this except maybe Pig but we know how amazing she is (said no one). The rest of the add-ons are crap.

Nice repost.

I think an 11 year old should be on youtube watching minecraft and roblox videos, not on reddit.
---
What did you do?
---
It’s over 9000
---
The Splinter offering let you play as “take the role of” a killer. The Nightmare is Freddy’s “name” so basically you get to play as Perkless/Addonless Freddy for a match.
---
What was the killer's name? I remember playing in this map with hillbilly recently
---
I made a clown drawing once and posted it here on a different account. Got a lot of wholesome people, but way too many were... Not the nicest. Nice that you got good feedback, and quite a good sketch, *even more* coming from someone so young!
---
Let him walk over his traps.
---
I usually give hatch to a survivor that was screwed over like this david the other day was left on the hook and almost died his first hook with no gens completed so i let him go
---
If the killer doesn't have ruin, they get walking simulator for 3 minutes.
---
Yeah, it might just be some maps where I feel like they're way too close.  I feel like if the killer wastes time while carrying a survivor, they should be taking a (slight) risk.  Go slug that poorly-hidden teammate, and maybe you don't get the hook...  or alternately, go for the hook but lose track of the other survivor briefly.  This probably wouldn't affect high rank killers at all since they are already more efficient and adaptable, but at more modest ranks we're contending with teammate mistakes as well, so sometimes we have to rely on ourselves but have few tools in these instances.
---
Nah, you got scammed mate

Until the day you realize that holding onto every slightly-negative comment and getting worked up over it (enough to warrant a response) gets you nowhere, I will.
---
I spammed an image
---
We talking ping or power level?

That’s your own fault then you deserve it for spamming
---
You didn't, but I did. And even many ...

It's not *yet*
---
Blue power ranger is not blue tho
---
Well man, I was dumb
---
I just see a long neck Wall-e
---
You. Just. Spent. 2000 IS for the 150k BP??? As killer you need 3 games to get 150k BP. For 2000 shards you need to level up 7 times and for each level you need about ~8 games. So for 2000 IS you need about 56 games!
---
Never use IS for BP, that's a crazy waist.
---
I'm skipping him not because I feel that the character is weak but he has nothing really special compared to other killers I main. I like Freddy and Billy the most. And I feel like they counter a lot of the inherit bullshit of the game. But unless Surge is just an amazing perk that they don't nerf into the ground I'm not buying Demogorgon. 
---
The pounce is good and similar to Billy's saw but can't instant down. And you need an Ultra Rare just to break pallets with it.
---
The teleport is okay but you need to set them up ahead of time, you can't read aura's until they're activated (which can waste more time) and that leaves them open to being cleansed. And you can't use them to counter loops on the fly like Hag.
---
As a killer main, I do not enjoy tunneling or slugging, they are not fun ways to play, but when the survivors call me a tunneler for hitting the unhooked survivor that ran directly into me is the reason why I don’t play this game nearly as much anymore, I have a very love hate relationship with the game, I would love dead by daylight a lot more if I could actually run the perk builds I like without other survivors blaming me for not running meta perks, or getting called toxic or made fun of as killer because I’m trying to play the game in a way I find enjoyable.
---
I love how you were closer to that entrance but somehow still didn’t make it lmfao
---
I appreciate that so much! Thank you.
---
you say so
---
Thank you I’m sure your sketch was very good
---
I stopped reading after you said NOED was a great perk.
---
If you're about to get bum rushed by 3 people coming for save, of course stay to get some easy hits. Otherwise, once you hook someone, clear the fuck out and go find some people on gens.
---
I founded the demogorgon to be a very good killer, Pounce is way different than billy's chainsaw because it works nice on loops, the teleport is a nice addition.
---
what the fuck did you just fucking say about insidious you noed piece of shit
---
Tree fiddy.
---
Aw man, im pc
---
Uh. Yeah. Second best exhaustion perk in the game only preceded by Adrenawin
---
you've also created a new marker for yourself to remember that a player will most likely pass through, stealthier killers can make good use of it
---
You can messages the one who banned you
---
3, and indefinitely
---
Then (Not trying to be rude)
---
Insidious is bad
---
Ack,   Fuck meta.   Playing video games is about having fun. As a 2 year survivor main.  I say play how you want to play. Does every single survivor have to play the same way?   No.  So neither should the killer. 
---
As for the love hate thing.  I hate that I love the game.  Almost every random I play with makes me want to snap. But the game still has the potential to be good. It’s a shame really.
---
it works, we're talking about perk efficiency not how fair it is
---
Ah no that one of the first ever made! Though 13
---
It gives her a say in chases with loops, otherwise you could run right over the trap like it never existed, and she would become the worst killer on the game in mid tier play and above.  If she takes the time to set traps, and you didn’t know it was there, she should be rewarded.  If she’s setting the trap midchase at a loop you can always counter it by running to the next loop.

And you have to accept the consequences for your actions. That’s a life lesson for you. Sorry it sucks but that’s how the world works I’m afraid.
---
I’ll find a way
---
At rank reset ruin is compl overkill. Its already not needed on pig, nurse,billy etc. A killer that has mobility/quick chases or built in game slowdown doesn’t need the extra help and is completely overkill
---
I did the same thing yesterday. I hate that fucking glitch.
---
No. That’s proxy camping.
---
I'll have you know I graduated top of red ranks with insidious
---
Did anyone else catch the god pallet being dropped at the end of this clip? I cringed hella hard ngl
---
Sounds just like something a camper would say.
---
Keep hatin’ :)
---
Stalk for a good amount of time but if you can get a hit in get the hit. A good strategy to use is to fill up your meter until it’s just about to go off and when you’re about to hit a survivor, quickly stalk so it pops and insta-down them
---
I can see where the confusion comes in, it is a fairly complex discussion. See what we mean by "just do totems" is actually don't do totems and continue to die to Noed but also don't complain because we provided a solution. Again, the confusion is completely understandable.
---
Now you gotta make a post showing Freddy's lung before and after
---
Please censor usernames in the future.
---
Billy phantom saw is the worst as a billy main
---
The feature is still in beta, but it seems like the idea didn’t stick and they abandoned it.
---
The dailies in the picture are worth a *ton* of BP.  I've never bothered with mine, since they're worth like 4,500.  So they've been sitting uncompleted since 2016.
---
All of the above
---
At the start of the game I recommend mainly stalking unless they all have a gen rush set-up.
---
If they don't have a GR set-up wait until Tier 2 then get aggressive, if you notice someone just stalk them and if you see a group try to stalk and then take them out one by one.
---
You shouldn't have to tunnel as Myers but you should hopefully be able to take them out quickly if you are strategic.
---
Kinda. I’m not nearly as excited for the 17th as everyone else. I am excited, but not so much that I can’t wait. I’m mostly just playing both games as normal.
---
I don’t think you should let your age hold back dude you can be a pro and be fucking 15 keep at it
---
You want to stalk survivors until you get to the edge of Evil Within 3 and then pop Evil Within 3 when you know you will get a guaranteed hit.Best way to learn is to watch youtube videos.

Every time. Every goddamned time I get the Crotus Prenn map, my hex totems are in the middle of plain sight!

I only patrol when I know that sneaky Claudette is around.

Tomorrow or Monday will be the day I post my drawing of the legion as requested by psypo. I’m probably going to do the clown coloured in and the legion Tomorrow if I have time
---
It was the second moth I was on rank two and now on rank 10.. That's crazy. The actual ranking system and the rank resets are bullshit
---
Wow I didn't notice when I was playing good catch, yeah it was a bit of a mess lol.
---
Around 1 million, give or take a few hundred thousand.
---
This is probably the most hyped chapter ever.
---
This is what happens when you have never tried the other end of a PvP scenario. It happens. I don't play DBD (I just watch it), but I do play Dark Souls games and there is a surprising amount of  people who don't understand how stuff works for invaders in whatever one of the games is being played to any degree, stuff that could be figured out by doing something once. Like, I get it if you don't think you'd like something, but it can't hurt to click the other option once or twice, at least make sure.
---
If Freddy has dream pallets and you throw one down it’s a free hit so should those be removed too? And Doctor’s fake pallets, and his shock if he times it right. Clown’s bottles and Freddy’s snares, too. The point of a killer power is to allow them to more easily hit you if they use their power effectively, and if the Hag managed to anticipate you running to that exact pallet out of every possible spot in the map, she’s using her power effectively. 
---
You can try to avoid Hag’s traps, if you see one at a vault or a pallet, run to a different loop. If she places a trap there while you’re looping, run away. You can destroy them with flashlights or by deliberately tripping them when she’s chasing someone else. She’s also slowed down every time she teleports and has a reduced lunge, so you can play around that.

Especially when u run devour hope

I usually find 1 mill will get you to 35-38 if you play it right. As thats the cap, thats what you need to go for

She still has pressure in terms of auto aim teleport and not teleporting. I'm pretty sure you're highly underestimating the role her other strengths play in her traps being good. Her main strength comes from placing traps on the inside of loops. Allowing for mind gaming a teleport or not. 
---
What I'm talking about is a situation where I'm running to a pallet and my camera gets thrown 75° to the right and I'm now forced to run in a complete random direction, forcing me to take a hit. This isn't a skillful placement or me making a mistake, this is literally just a mechanic killing me because reasons.

Demogorgon - I sleep

# DEMOCORCON - REAL SHIT
---
Ruin is needed on almost every killer besides nurse and billy
---
I agree. However I think OP has a point about \*some\* of the hook distances. I've actually played a few matches recently where the hooks were SO close I told my friend to come have a look. I'm talking like 10 feet apart or less. I feel like that shouldn't be normal. That's a problem with how the hooks are procedurally generated on the map and it really doesn't benefit the killer either. If there's 3-4 hooks crowded in one area there's going to be less hooks on another area. I do wish they'd fix that. I actually found it to be irritating as both survivor and killer. They should keep the same amount of hooks in the maps and make them a set distance apart. It actually benefits everyone.
---
Camping IS a viable strategy if survivors are over-altruistic. If all three other survivors just rush the hook, trying to save their friend, why should I leave?  
---
This doesn't include facecamping, however. Facecamping is not only inefficient for killers, but it's also a kick in the dick for the whole survivor team.
---
Your argument to saying that slugging will be more common place was saying how it's ok because survivors win either way. Killer is already the more stressful role, no need to make it even more stressful.
---
I mean, I like leaving wholesome messages if we've had multiple run-ins together/against each other in the vidya.
---
I don't run it often, but it's always my Ruin. :'(

I dont mean the dlc, i mean the release date, i havent seen anyone in reddit talking about that

Those are good tips but I kinda broke after *spirit furry*

 Borrowed time, perhaps?
---
Thanks for telling me
---
It's only good if you don't get hooked.
---
Aura reading perks are also kinda useless in SWF since you can communicate where you are. I do love aftercare if I'm just playing solo or in a duo though, it's a great perk.
---
"If you see one" bro you act like they're obvious like trapper's traps. They're so unnoticeable that you can't say "JUST LOOK FOR THEN 4HEAD"
---
Also the situation I'm bringing up isn't about the trap play of hag, my situation is about suddenly having my camera flung in a random direction that forces me to take a hit in 99.9% of cases.
---
Oh god
