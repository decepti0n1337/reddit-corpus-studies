We're goin' downtown.
---
---
---
I mean, you AFKing on the hatch while they do a gen to escape is still a freebie escape lol
---
Not really that sweaty considering they all could have used something usefull instead of selfcare.
---
Killer main here; I'm a rank 5 nurse main, and (at least for me) almost immediately after the blood hunt ended, I've been getting at least one DC per game after I down someone. I never really tunnel, but it seems survivor toxicity is at an all time high
---

---
I mean, you still get survs exposed, so you can't just say you play Noed for the speed buff. You also play it for the exposed effect. Like, you don't have a choice. When you use it, you are using the haste and exposed effects.
---
They're on here, however /r/deadbydaylight is not a direct line to BHVR.
---
thank you!
---
Smh bring back old NoEd 😤
---
I once hooked pre-last person and saw the other one near the exit gates. Instead of making him go out I hit him and got away, then crouched (I was Pig) to the exit gates. The second he got away I ambushed him. He was 1 meter away from the exit gates. 
---
If you like killer just keep at it. Honestly killer will become easy until rank 5, and then it will only be very hard/impossible against 4 man swf.   
---
You will nonetheless often get trolled and BM'ed so just get used to it and strive to become better.
---
I mostly play survivor since I got this game to play with my friend! I think I'm like rank 14 at the moment? However when she's not around is when I play killer. My main problem with it was I was having a hard time following scratch marks and timing/aiming my lunges. Also I think one of my problems was I was playing huntress and could never find anyone because they all heard me coming. I played against her for the first time last night and I never realized how loud her singing was! Hopefully I'll do better with a more stealthy killer
---
Dear god I would have been shitting myself.
---
Implying self care isn't useful...
---
If you start putting out map pressure properly(which is hard to do with pig being a bad killer) gen rush wouldn't be a problem unless the survivors are "tryharding" with 4 genrush toolboxes and all of them are powering through gens without being altruistic but that'll almost never happen.
---
You get better at the game and kill them
---
just get good 4Head
---
Congratz. I had a P3 Nurse dc on me yesterday, it was an honor
---
Yeah that's whe way I see it! Even if someone is being a huge asshole and has been camping the whole game I still won't be toxic towards them. Luckily I'm on PS4 so I don't have to see the chat. But thank you for the advice!
---
STOP. YOU VIOLED THE LAW. PAY THE COURT A FINE OR  SERVE YOU SENTENCE. ALL STOLEN GOODS ARE NOW FORFAIT
---
I mean, the Killer player doesn’t hear any of that so what’s the big deal
---
Why unbreakable though? Wouldn't adrenaline be more useful on the flashlighters? Or urban
---
I was spectating this poor Leatherface trying to give this Feng the hatch but she kept struggling out and it was painful!!
---
if you are the killer and you want your survivors to waste as much as time as possible yes. not everybody is noob3 that selfcared mid chase and know hot to make sense out of it. even on r1 u will see the average p3 claudette to not do anything but selfcare into sloppy butcher 24/7. easy way to not finish games btw. 
---
I know right!! I do not care about my rank in the slightest, but I would still love an unranked mode just as like a way for me to learn how to play a killer and stuff. 
---
I use Barbaque &amp; Chilli, Hex: Ruin, Save The Best For Last, and Sloppy Butcher
---
Adretha is my fav streamer and he lives in the UK so by the time he streams it's 8am for me
---
Lol I was watching YouTube bc I thought I missed his stream uggggghhhh
---
Would love to know how you see this benefitting the killer side? Genuinely intrigued.
---
For the most killers, the most optimal build is BBQ, Hex: Ruin, Enduring, and Spirit Fury. Some killers have more flexibility in really good builds. BBQ, Hex: Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, and Nurse's Calling is a good one. Some of those are DLC perks, so not sure if you're into spending money for this game right now.
---
Lol
---
Worst part is they're De-Rankers
---
Yeah I do thanks for noticing
---
The initial part of the vid triggered a PTSD for me
---
it's gotten much worse since the healing changes, especially since they're full swf so they can just heal each other real easily.
---
Cool editing.
---
On the topic though, it's easy to get kills with Spirit. When she came out my killer rank jumped from averaging a 10-13 (I really only played killer for daily missions) to averaging a 5-7 rank. And that's only playing exclusively Spirit made a few throw away games for daily missions. I'm not that great of a killer, in fact I'm a total forehead sometimes, but getting a double pip 4K with The Spirit is one of the easiest things I've ever done. 
---
My most hated killer used to be a tie between Billy and LeatherFace. But now it's The Spirit. She's absolutely ridiculously powerful, and her strongest power add ons have virtually no balancing drawbacks. 
---
Nothing personal kid
---
Didn’t think that was an actual subreddit 
---
I’m so glad that it is 
---
You don't seem that experience with killer, so I would say to just play games and see what works. You're usually going to find that just letting survivors do "toxic" things is actually in your favor, and if you just chase, down, hook, rinse and repeat, you'll 4k almost every time, even with swf. Camping and tunneling actually don't help you, so you don't have to worry about that. Unless you want to facecamp someone for fun.
---
I mean...yeah. Play more killer, get more experience, and yeah.
---
Ask yourself some questions, there is a un reason for that
---
Now do that with three blinks in a row.  I had to farm to get that achievement.  Great blink tho
---
Yeah SWF and medkits nullifies the need for selfcare but in general it is still a very useful perk. Especially for me since most of the time i play solo. I like to stay independent when it comes to healing. 
---
It doesn't make me want to throw up after getting hit by a bottle. 
---
That’s a decent idea too, I just think the hooked person should be able to do something...it doesn’t make much sense that the person just has to hang there while being able see the killer.
---
Use an Ebony Mori.
---
"Nobody gets killed. We always see to that." - The Legion
---
Once trapped caught me in one trap in got himself in another while carrying me. So I ran away while he was stunned.
---
Who cares, if it works for you and you are having fun that's all that really matters.
---
How can the fifth be off doing gens when there are only 4 survivors lol
---
It's called dodging and because it doesn't affect rank or no anything like that it will never be bannable.
---
In swf yes, it is not that useful, still decent but not necessary. In solo play though it is still one of the best perks. Finding a teammate and getting healed wastes more time than just healing yourself. Unless you just wanna rush gens and pop adrenaline(which is boring af) it is better to heal asap so you'll be safer and harder to find. 
---
Where is da queen
---
@everyone THIS killer literally camped and tunneled all of us the entire match so yeah we pretty much got out played. (Half of that is sarcasm.) You can say that to do the gens while this scumbag is camping the hatch, yeah might as well. But we didn't want our friend here to get cucked and smacked by NOED. That was our thought process. We wanted the hatch, otherwise we would've been smacked my NOED knowing how this killer is. A complete scumbag regardless.
---
Clearly, those survivors have no idea what they're talking about if they're calling Doc a "crutch killer." He is a middle of the pack killer, maybe even lower. Doc is the best for tracking, so that was a good switch on your part. He's not "hard" to play in my mind, you just shock and chase. Not necessarily harder than other killers. If you're doing good with him and you have fun, you should definitely continue. And mix in some other killers every other game or so, too.
---
And actually, as far as from the surv perspective, he really has nothing other than shocking to know where you're at. It's really easy to go against imo, and those salty survs you go against are really just upset at themselves because they don't know how to play the game.
---
Welcome to DbD. Survivors cry about everything. You shouldn't camp, shouldn't tunnel, shouldn't use mori's, shouldn't use great add-ons (I.E. 3 or more blinks for Nurse), shouldn't use top tier Killers, shouldn't use NOED, shouldn't slug, shouldn't dribble to counter DS if they're stupid enough to be downed near a hook, shouldn't use the tombstone piece with Myers, shouldn't use Iridescent Heads with Huntress, shouldn't use BBQ, etcetera. The excuses just keep going and going and going. 
---
Here's some advice: ignore their crying and play how you want. And especially ignore the crying on this sub and the other forums. 
---
Male pattern baldness wasn't gentle on Jake.
---
She ends streams in the red ranks unless she starts disconnecting during the stream, if she only goes down to purples it takes no time to get to reds which results in the Gaming_experience™ way faster.
---
I know this comment is old but I want to say something about it, the wraith somewhat does have something to do with his lore.  Obviously his weapon has Azoroth's skull and spine on it, but I think his appearance is supposed to reflect on the fact he was an immigrant and most likely poor, that's why his cloak is so old and all he had on pretty much.  His power on the other hand  while the bell itself might not reflect on his life, his addons do, being symbols that most likely are from his culture and beliefs, the bell is most likely a catalyst for the symbols to be painted on and work.
---
Kinda off-topic but does the killer hear grunts of pain when you are inside a locker and injured
---
Yeah so the last time he got a whole outfit was 5 months ago. Why do the devs hate him?
---
Then don't cry when you get hit for being greedy you goddamn anime boy. 
---
I’m thinking whether or not to open the mask from the package or not. It looks pretty nice sealed 
---
I use the excact same clothes! Very good taste indeed 😏
---
I see just that when I watch Zubat or other red-ranks play you see the same survs every 2-3 games 
---
funny, because you're the only one who thought what you did. 
---
literacy. changes lives.
---
I'm not crying mate I'm frustrated, that's completely different. Why are you being so disrespectful mate I'm not disrespecting you, you can't have a civil conversation without being a dick head eh?
---
And killers say it's hard to rank up
---
Imagine thinking this game is competitive.
---
Well I don't know about you all but that hook is looking quite seductive...
---
The "shimer" of the cloak only appears while the wraith is moving, when stationary he is completely invisible
---
Nope you don’t 
---
Reign of terror is like a dying light but better. It’s cool, but it’s literally the same as dying light, except even better. It should be reworked
---
Drop it = Lose it.
---
The White Ward keeps the item with you in case you die. It's very useful for trading event items with friends but not much else, in my opinion.
---
You got a point mate thanks
---
You’re not wrong. Don’t know why you’re being downvoted. Plenty of killers drop mid chase to go right back to the hook. And no 9 times out of 10 you can’t hide so you run. 
---
There’s only so much you can do in a situation like that. 
---
I'll never understand the people that DC when they're about to die, especially if they're the last person alive. Like you're literally benefitting the killer and gimping yourself, what is the logic there?
---
&gt;other streamers deal with it 
---
Why does she get special treatment, nobody seems to be able to answer this
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And they DC 😂😂 good work. Entity is pleased my fellow doc
---
That would have made my blood boil
---
Thats not the point, he still ruins the game for everyone
---
That dude was quite fun to play against anyway. Complete trash player that gets downed in 20sec, but has flashlight and DS. Difn't even tunnel him. He just came back and taunted me till he was dead half way in the game. Enjoyed the game, even downed a Jake who tried to stay around lil longer after exit were open and let him go for fun. "Be more careful, Jake"  
---
It was a fun match, except for the wannebe Ochido Boy who got mega salty because he had to rationalize that he isn't trash at the game by "killer is cheating", lol.
---
Even if I was the killer in this situation I would be more impressed than pissed off I think.
---
I know right like she needs it
---
Its boldness points, the longer you stay down and make it out safely the more you receive. 
---
it's lives*, big brain. 
---
I bought Halloween DLC because I liked both killer and survivor. Although, I couldn't care less about Tapp or Quentin, so I got the killers with auric cells only, as I could get their perks on shrine anyway. The downside is that you still receive the splinters, which is just ridiculous.
---
In the end, it depends on you. If you want only one character from the chapter, buy with auric.
---
But one that requires they *do* shit, instead of just Urban Evade from locker to locker for 10 minutes while everyone else puts in the work.

Nope, laugh is annoying and buzzing electricity os annoying too. 
---
Understandable. What does the packaging look like though? Was the mask damaged?
---
Lol fun police
---
Isn't there a dedicated spirit main that everyone considers to be the best spirit ? And not someone that is just pretty good with all killer
---
I can understand Nurse, but besides insta saw, Billy isnt an issue.
---
Facts
---
So there is no point in trying to be rank 1, besides getting the achivement one time.
---
I honestly thought an abattoir was a fancy word for house, whoops.
---
I guess you learn something new everyday
---
I honestly have no idea :/
---
Spirit's a bit frustrating to play as of now because sounds are bugged so not many people play her.
---
Ruin, remember me, dying light, and/or Thanatophobia imo. Just a shit-ton of stuff to slow the game down can be annoying. Plus other builds that just make the killer hella op
---
I mean being first downed is sometimes a death sentence against some killers. There are plenty out there who incessantly tunnel the first person they find no matter what. Nothing like getting an 9k reward total for looping the killer for all 5 gens and being facecamped because you made them salty, and they would rather throw the whole game just to kill you.
---
That's right.
---
Sounds are currently bugged. Deal with it or play survivor.
---
There ain't problems with them, it's just boring to see nearly the same killer over and over again, in most cases with the meta perks xD 
---
It would be funny for 5 seconds but then I would loose my mind
---
No point to rank 1 honestly, you will find both bad and good survivors and killers. Usually more experienced on both sides but not to where it's like 'damn this is a good player'. Rank has no meaning unfortunately, for now. I usually hit rank 1 on both killer and survivor because I play this game so much and I play both just about equally, so I'll go killer, survivor, killer, survivor and so forth. Sometimes I'll play only killer if a new killer comes out or if 2XBP or only survivor that day if I feel like doing swf. But yeah as long as you aren't 100% potato you will eventually hit rank 1 before the reset, even then you can be boosted.
---
Do like the idea of delaying the update the killer gets on the unhooks and such. Preying Eyes sounds interesting but sounds like Object of Obsession with no downside combined with a much stronger Open Handed, stackable if all 4 run it? 
---
;-; plz show nercy subreddit
---
Also you can Chuck a post up in r/dbdlfg
---
Sounds like something I’d do
---
"This post has been removed for irrelevancy."
---
This is wonderful. If I had the talent to make videos I would use it and credit the fuck out of you. I like this.
---
understandable
---
Learn how to look behind you while noticing where you're going, plan ahead, learn how to loop tiles properly and cut corners better, learn when you should wait and try playing pallets/window out. All of this is much tougher than it sounds but you'll get it eventually.
---
NNNNNOOOOO! Not my Dwight meme!
---
That actually sounds like an amazing concept!! Hard to play/get the hang of maybe, but I love it. The story behind her is great too! 
---
This is so accurate lmao. But I don't waste my time anymore with the farming. If I see only 3 or less load in I just back out and save both sides the time. Not gonna be an ass and kill them all for barely any points as they are at a bad disadvantage and I'm not gonna wait for them to run around doing gens and chests.
---
Momento mori for the win
---
Wait, when did sound become bugged? I'm watching vids from around September, and sound seemed fine. I only started playing again a little over a week ago.
---
What does calling some sweaty in this game mean? Seen a random in the survivors group I was in earlier call the killer that.
---
Killer: Billy, Huntress, Spirit(sounds are broken though), Pig and Nurse when I'm bored.  
---
Survivor: Dwight, Nea, Feng, Jake, Bill
---
&gt;coordinated 4-man SWF who cheat their way to a hookless escape,
---
Oh.. Are you one of those "looping is toxic, body blocking is an exploit, flashlights are op" killers?
---
Now your stance makes perfect sense. Have a nice day, I've had my fill of comedy.
---
I like Urban Evasion but lately I have been enjoying Iron Will when I found myself "escaping" but only being a few feet away. As for killer Stridor has been getting some good use. I always hear streamers say "I can hear em" but even with max settings on my headset I can't hear anything without Stridor.
---
Its not really the survivors hitboxes, I think its the killer weapon hurtboxes.
---
What happened after
---
Just let the man use his fucking Moro’s
---
Omega Blink.
---
This was today so this was the recent update lol
---
It's not nice to make fun of the disabled. 
---
You hit the nail on the head.
---
Survivors in this game are consistently the most toxic players i've ever played with in any game. They will complain about every killer action that, when it comes down to it, is the whole point of playing a killer -- which is to defeat the players by any means necessary.
---
Can you imagine Evo tournament players complaining about Ryu using fireballs to trap, or his shoryuken priority to punish jump-ins? Or higher level DOTA play where people whine about denying creep? I honestly think the majority of DBD players are of the participation-trophy generation.
---
I mean. I just want blood points.
---
Mmmmm crumchy teeth
---
Besides expecting your teammates to be as useless and toxic as ever, I can only recommend moving to pc.
---
Idk man, I feel like if high rank survivors wanna play with low rank survivors, the game should pair them up against a killer that matches the rank of the high rank survivor. Or at least much closer than that.
---
i run lightweight and iron will and that usually is enough 
---
I hate it when I carry someone somewhere and don't hook them and them wiggling out is being considered as they outplayed me. BITCH I had 2 hooks on the way. I obviously let you.
---
Hey how do you convince them as the doctor to farm? because we have a shit time with survivors running off and DC'ing when we play him (me and my s.o. both have this problem)
---
That would make sense if Tapp were trying to prolong the chase, or reengage it when the chase was finished, but he wasn’t.  He was running with the intent to escape, trying to break line of sight and crouch away, sneaking around the edges of the map when he heard my terror radius and thought I couldn’t see him, continuing to run away even after I stopped following, etc. the only thing he didn’t do was drop any pallets, he vaulted windows like mad but he seemed determined to avoid any and all pallets (maybe because he had seen I was running Brutal Strength?  Not really sure.)

---
so, netflix &amp; kill?
---
 (sorry i'm new here)
---
Oh I am by no means a veteran killer, I have at most 100 hrs into the game but probably half that. The main thing I'll see the red rank survivors do is if you respect the pallet, they won't drop it if you swing through it they'll step further away so you can't them and if you walk through it they drop it. They react better at pallets and that's the main thing, they don't look around much when on gens unless they can hear your heartbeat. They have more hours into the game so they'll use better items or have more meta perks. It isn't as daunting as it seems
---
im not seeing an upside to this
---
On PS4 it's very toxic. I would imagine it is the same over on Xbox One aswell
---
Doc is honestly my least favorite killer to face. He almost impossible to hide from and to lose him. I guess I could use calm spirit but it's so useless against the other killers. Can you give me advice on how to deal with a doctor. 
---
Even on huntress its bad. 
---
What is the point getting rank 1 in this video game?
---
Don't feel too bad man. I run 'shitty perks' every single game on all my characters- survivor AND killer- because they make the game better for ME.
---
I run deja Vu, wake up, pharmacy, and Sprint Burst on my Quentin, and I run whispers, make your choice, dying light, and NOED on my Michael. I do this because I have issues seeing certain colors when they're close in shade, so for ME This is the best build for both.
---
I have gotten shit SO MANY TIMES over it. 
---
You ain't alone, and just play the game in the way you enjoy it
---
My main is Huntress and Myers. But currently playing Legion.
---
Every rank is just full of assholes. You can't make them go away, you can't play a rank without them. It's just part of the game.
---
We need that line in a meme video. 
---
1 in 4 games crash for me since the Legion update. My rig's hardware shits on this game's min. requirements and all my drivers are up to date and working properly. How about you bitch at BHVR for fucking their game up.
---
This is actually my favorite quote. I like running Discordance just so I can point to it when a toxic survivor cries in post-game chat that I managed to kill them because they were teabagging and flashlight clicking instead of running away.
---
BBQ with a Tombstone? 
---
Fuck Claudettes that use camo clothing.
---
Heyy I'm down! Located in USA eastern time. Feel free to add me! 
---
Taree1994
---
Knock em down, drag to gen and drop. Usually they will get the idea unless you immediately charge for someone else. Stopping in the pallet and hitting it is a fair sign of "smack me". Usually does the trick for me.
---
3 map offerings tho? #BigBrain?
---
Hello everyone , happy New year's , I am a new players , have around 100 hours and I want to be a doctor main , can anyone please give me some crucial tips , I have a level 22 rank 14 doctor and I only have pig as the other dlc. Any help will be appreciated!
---
Play both sides so you can understand the issues and abuses on both sides. Aside from that you see toxicity every once in a while but that's it. The best way to avoid it is by not associating with it. If you're a survivor don't encourage a toxic killer or toxic survivor and if you're a killer experiencing toxic survivors just try your best to kill them and move on, they'll probably get destroyed before a gen gets done next game anyways. Have fun is the most important thing imo.
---
Still, he got dethroned by Legion easily. People just are slow on updating their meme databanks.
---
Toxic behaviour is rare. At least from my perspective. I’m on PS4 though. In terms of teamwork... there is none. Turns out there is an I in team after all. You are the team - you cannot rely on your teammates, 99.9% of them will be useless. Bring selfish perks because you deserve it.
---
Use Legion isntead. Easily more BP.
---
I always hook the first two people I down to use BBQ, lulls them into falls security with the Tombstone and gives me plenty of opportunity to find the other ones.
---
i understand like a crutch or two but my god.. and ther purple flashlights + insta heal medkits???
---
That joke was quite on the nose.
---
Big Oof
---
Good match recap.
---
Yeah but this would destroy the fun for the lower people and the higher killers, but think like this: if you beat the high ranks you can feel good!
---
But the rank is just a number, there are rank 1-4 survivors who plays pretty bad. So don't mind the ranks, is my point 
---
I went to the basement and she healed... 
---
Just because what he experiences isnt what you experience doesnt mean that he’s lying.
---
Billy has a massive like 160° radius for his chainsaw even BHVR admits they broke him but I don't think he's op, most people can never degree with rank 2-4 in the tier list being Huntress Spirit and Billy 
---
Cowboy jake
---
Slow the game down just a little bit
---
I'm more surprised that isn't what happened
---
I played (PC most of the time) everywhere, what I witnessed from the toxic ranks
---
Steam&gt;Xbox&gt;PlayStation
---
Steam ofc first place because the chat is the easiest way
---
I have to agree with you that Billy's chainsaw hitbox is broken atm.
---
2 things we need from totem spawns. 1 - don't spawn within 20 metres of survivor and 2 - don't spawn within 20 metres of Generator. OR give the killer ability to choose where the totem is. 
---
There's no point... That is what I'm not getting. Rank is just there to determine what type of players your being matched with.
---
It was in good shape and the mask is huge. It’s also a nice foam material so it can bend and not be damaged 
---
Yea that happens to killers who been tbagged one to many times
---
There's barely any attempt on this post
---
Engine update made it so you can't hear groans, breathing, footsteps, etc.. sometimes. Really frustrating
---
Killer: Doc and Huntress
---
Survivors: Dwight
---
For boosted SWF squads on comms to act like victims 
---
Borrowed time is still bugged. 
---
Not really. Some ppl are just dicks just like how some survivors are just dicks.

Well that's all hearsay without an actual clip of what you're talking about.
---
That's how it worked on 1 of the ptbs
---
Level Claudette for self care (heal without a medkit), meg for adrenaline (heals you up one health state when gens are done and gives a sprint burst) and quick and quiet (when you fast vault the killer doesn’t get notified once every 20 secs), feng for lithe (when you vault in a chase you get a sprint burst). Really good build imo.

I play in red ranks every season and I almost never face the same killer unless it’s when we happen to queue again after just finishing a match with each other. Not every red rank killer tunnels and camps. I would say it’s just as common at low ranks that you get tunneled than at high ranks. 
---
  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

You're trying way to hard to apply logic to a game where you can take a hook through the chest, hop off the hook and be A-OK. 
---
Or take a chainsaw to the back and be fine with a minute of being touched by another player.
---
We're talking concept here, not full on level design. And actually yeah, lots of mansions have multiple doors per room, not just one. And like I said, there can also be holes in the walls to vault through, because it's haunted and old and all that jazz. In fact, there's a lot of hospitals with only one door per patient room now that you mention it, so they took a lot of liberty with level design for the hospital we have. 
---
Don't try to logic it. Try to have some fun. 
---
No dude, you're just fucking stupid. 😂
---
Good. Fuck you 
---
Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, Self Care, Empathy is very meta (kinda crutchy but works well). Self care and Empathy can be switched out if your confident enough without them.
---
Sure thing :)
---
Actually I spent one hour doing this
---
thats really most survivors to you?
---
Yes it is still funny
---
I wish they had more moris so I could collect them all with my terrible play🙃
---
💖
---
Yes, it’s usually 10/20 seconds at most, not minutes upon minutes.
---
I had a game where a group of 3 surviors in a group tried to save their friend at the end of the match, I was playing myers and was basically 99% of the way to rank III and their friend was already in struggle. Their friend got away but the two that tried to save their friend, ended up going on the hooks instead. Best part is his friends had already been hooked twice. 
---
They started berating me after the game because, they  fell for the bait instead of just running away. Even the rando survivor told them, "Yeah, you should have just ran"
---
I know when i'm playing survivor even if i'm with my friend if he gets hooked and the gates are open, and I've been hooked twice i just leave him, and he does the same for me. At least one of us gets out that way. 
---
Found the salty survivor that may have DC'd on you lol
---
Myers and huntress
---
You don't have to mash it. You just have to press it in a rhythmic pattern. You obviously can't press it too slow but you don't have to button mash. 
---
I don't mind adding people, but I have to ask if you're over 18 first.
---
I personally think it's awkward if I make a dirty joke and someone turns out to be a minor and prefer to avoid that situation
---
Well if you move away from the hooks and check a gen or two, they can unhook. You can then go chase the unhooker or the guy off hook (if you wanna tunnel) that’s two people not on gens, potentially three if you find someone on a gen. that’s gens not being done.
---
Killers need to stop worrying about survivors getting unhooked, don’t moan they’re gen rushing if you’re guarding hooks. I hook and move away to check gens, usually get 3k as I don’t slug for the 4K. More points to hook the same guy three times than sit on him till he dies.
---
That’s totally valid and I should have specified, I’m 29.

Sweet! Add me broski, I'm GilbertnGilbird!

I don’t know what you consider good for a map, but I like my maps to make sense. As far as I remember there aren’t many (if any) single patient rooms in the hospital. If you want a mansion that has multiple bedrooms and bathrooms all connected by multiple doors, so be it. If you want a building that has holes in the walls just because it’s old, so be it. 
---
Don’t post a map suggestion and expect 0 critique, questioning if other people even have fun if you do receive criticism. 
---
I would've done the same, he seems like a fun killer to play against
---
yikes. just @ me next time bub
---
Salty surviver spotted. 
---
BHVR BE LIKE
---
(heavily deepfried img of stevie wonder)
---
IMMA ADD CONSOLE OPTIMIZATION NEXT TIME I SEE YOU
---
 all the survivors we're near the hook so I have an opportunity to get a third? 
---
Don’t post this shit looking for free karma, this isn’t a circle jerk sub
---
Am I weird for playing Billy to get to rank one for the first time then moving to doctor because I find him better
---
I recommend it. You get tunnelled as much as p3 Lauries and p3 Qurntins
---
Sabo Mets reminds me of old iron grasp,
---
You could catch a tbagging survivor then carry them near the exit gate for about 5 minutes to show them what they won’t have,go eat dinner,go to bed,then wake up and hook the survivor in the basement.
---
If they’re near the hook with you, you don’t loose points.
---
Nah bro a migraine is fuckin painful 
---
Critique? LMAO. You aren't critiquing. You're whining.  
---
He gave an idea and you're just all "uhhhh uhhhh doors!" when you should know damn well that devs can make it any way they like.  
---
You want maps that make *sense*?  
---
How does a corn field surrounded by a massive brick wall and only two garage doors powered by 5 of 7 generator make sense?  
---
How does a hospital with only two garage doors as exits make sense?  
---
How does Lampkin lane being surrounded by a complete and total wall with a short street ending at both sides make sense?  
---
The answer it simple. They *don't* always make sense, and you allow for that in order to play the game. The same way having a generator turned on while you're repairing it somehow makes *sense*.  
---
What’s the point in playing the game then? This guy is an actual idiot if he thinks they’ve lost when he does this
---
*oh my darling Amanda..*
---
Exactly, I would’ve went back to the start but changed my path up to see if he approved or not.
---
Doesn't have to be single patient. Even double patient rooms have one door (and a second that goes to closed off bathroom usually). You're kinda nit picking here, and I'm not sure why. If you don't like it, move on. Not everything in the game is completely logical, and rules can be bent if necessary. 
---
Diffrence is satisfaction feeling , I’m killer main 4 man killing feel like king 
---
You can integrate all the voice stuff in the world - DbD won‘t be able to limit voice comms like TS or Discord.
---
Ppl will just turn it off and play like they always do. 
---
Getting a 3 man with last guy getting hatch is a bit of a kick to the dick 
---
You want fun? Distortion and object, go to the basement, let distortion burn as you find it. 
---
Stand on the stairs and stare at the killer.
---
More effective with Laurie.
---
Max frighten with four Lauries.
---
DS isn’t toxic, you’re just mad
---
Well it’s better than waiting an eternity to find someone when there’s 3 gens left
---
That dead hard was amazing.
---
Yes, everyone died but I managed to escape as the killer was camping with noed.... 
---
If you want a ton of points then stop caring for kills. Let them get their stupid unhook, you got them hooked once and you can do it again, why camp? 
---
I usually DC of only 3 or less load in. Just isn't fair imo but I understand if that pudding or streamer gets used, try to farm I guess.
---
But it looks filthy. My wound won't get infected right?
---
0 BP is a bad thing, waste of time unless you really just are here for the fun, and don't care about leveling characters, oh and making things worse for your teammates and making the killer pissed when they're about to mori you.
---
The only reason I haven't actually gotten the game is because I'm kinda scared of going up against a streamer or YouTuber who will just talk absolute shit/end up being toxic, and then I ended up watching it and Hate myself despite the fact I was learning or trying something new. That's just a personal fear, though.
---
I get wanting to have fun or questioning what a killer is doing, but there's a certain point where it's just going from having fun into being a little shit. 
---
But I'm also coming from a place where one of the few times I did a random lobby on a game the people on my team chewed me out despite the fact it was clear I was still learning. So take that as you will.
---
You do look cute cutie
---
Dead hard is a life saver sometimes 
---
Doesn‘t that still count as a dc and survivors keep the points etc? 
---
I didn't camp. It was a simple all survivors are near me where esle should I go? Jack of across the map while all reset the progress I've made?
---
I was a basement Myers guarding my chest to depip, and I had an entire team of Feng min swarm me to try to take my chest.
---
They didn't get it, and I watched my t3 burn as they slug raced up the basement stairs and out the door.
---
going on reddit and saying
---
"Well as a rank 1 player..."
---
really it means nothing. No rewards and everyone you play with is at least decent, but at most god-tier.
---
as a killer it just means everyone can pallet loop
---
as a survivor it just means that you won't die first hook because noone saves you
---
Uhhhhh you know I’m right here
---
I’m a survivor main and I hate Claudettes
---
What are OP addons for her? Besides instant down hatches 
---
Then cleanse totems? The killer isn’t going to move so there isn’t any risk to running around doing totems
---
A 4 kill is usually a double pip.
---
you know that most people Talk by using Discord or teamspeak? 
---
That would Change nothing lol 
---
Pretty sure TS is team speak 
---
Literally nothing happens. We never get to know any of the characters besides 'they love their family'. At the end when x character sacrifices themselves, there was no reason for them to, the monster didn't know where they were. It's an artificially tragic manipulative tearjearker moment that is completely unnecessary. 
---
No
---
This is just my opinion. Not that they are OP. I just don't use like green and purple addons aside from instadown. 
---
I like to sing that when the killer narrowly misses finding me and I watch them leave.
---
&gt; I’m critiquing the idea of having a map that would have bedrooms/bathrooms.
---
Last I checked, the hospital had bathrooms and an office, and the Game has an infamous bathroom with only one exit, though there's a roof entrance, until you get the generator working and the garage door.
---
Again, you're still showing that your mind is limited to someone who doesn't/can't develop games. The OP already said that amny rooms can have multiple doors and wall holes, and you seem butthurt that you didn't think of it, so you're all "nuuuuurrrrr" trying to win a lost argument. 
---
"Not to mention that it would be pretty strange to have pallets in the bedrooms, kitchen, etc."
---
Strange indeed. It's almost like the killer has been doing some work since the last inhabitants moved out. There could be reasons pallets exist in a mansion filled with junk and decay. 
---
You say there are some things that need to be put in place for the game to work, but you won't suspend disbelief now because "doors, omg doors! One door per room or it's simply unbelievable!" 
---
Maybe I need to learn his weaknesses. Once I fall into dream state I can rarely escape.
---
Don‘t take this as an offense but: You must be incredibly new to the internet if you think only toxic or tryhard people are using voice coms. (TS is TeamSpeak btw, it‘s pretty much an online call which you can join/leave anytime. Same for discord). 
---
I‘m pretty much in Discord all the time, even when not playing because talking to ppl is the most standard thing there is. 
---
Ah fair enough. I am sorta like that with micheal I like practicing without relying on my instant down and I do pretty good even made it to rank 3 without it 
---
Just run to a safe loop, and loop him till he cries. 
---
I love playing with people who play with a sense of humor. 
---
Geistra is the only one I like. 
---
Exactly 
---
Not worth it IMO, red rank on Xbox is a terrible place. I try to stay in purple. But congrats
---
Yes 0 BP sucks.  Depipping is great.
---
Hahaha. No I'm not new. I was a teen with dialup once upon a time. 
---
More like not as invested. 
---
So yea you're probably more informed than me. 
---
Well I'd consider that cheating so yea I wouldn't know about it because honor is something I value and I like to play fair. 
---
[removed]
---
Who's the streamer?
---
Once he tags you with his power, you have 7 seconds (default) to get to a safe zone. A pallet loop or jungle gym or something. Once you're there he has nothing to help him with the loop, and if he hits you it just means you can Self Care to trigger a skill check and wake up.
---
You obviously didn’t outplay the whole team if you’re in a hatch stand off gg 
---
I call him no one else can have him as a favorite
---
I am starting to get fed up with the legion build that downs me in like 3 deep wound stabs. But Doc is always the worst. Cannot stand playing against him. 
---
While I admit that I am not the greatest killer, I am typically able to take down at least 2-3, usually 4 of the survivors each game, while avoiding face camping, tunneling, etc. 
---
They probably got a key from a chest 
---
Killing the game as in no one would play it if you could get locked out of the game due to using some of the world‘s most popular messengers, a solution by punishment will never work. 
---
Trust me, I know the pain of facing a squad that only wants to ruin your game and see you type smth in chat. I‘m lucky enough to never face toxic squads that often, SWF sure but most of them consist of pretty uneven players (like one good, two bad etc.) so most of the time I‘m good.
---
I got no clue about voice comms on consoles but I think that‘s a console feature as such, there is no option to talk to ppl in DbD itself, so that‘s another thing you can‘t „turn off“ 
---
I'm always breaking HG first. 
---
AFAIK if the Killer force closes the application/pulls the plug, no one gets points. I’m not 100% sure though. 
---
LOL. Funny, considering you're the one being the comedian. No. I'm not "one of those." I'm not talking about any of that. I'm talking about groups like the one I met the other night. 1 person was using OoO to keep tabs on my location and report it to their friends, while trying to keep as much map as possible between us. While all 4 had DS and the OoO was 99 percenting hooks as an added backup.
---
No go away, troll.
---
...I’m a dumbass. 
---
I’m just so sad I only got 1/4 kills :(
---
Thanks!
---
Of course I'll continue to play and gain experience as a killer, I was just incredibly frustrated with this scenario, as it legitimately made the survivors end up being the bully lol
---
Tru3Talent but he’s not reliable, people play differently in his region. But no one honestly, not many people are hardcore Spirit mains. 
---
Did you miss the part where it said daily? I don’t find a problem with it because dailies are necessary for fast BP gain.
---
I just changed mine to the scroll wheel. Easier for skill checks for me too.
---
You can't complain about having to wait 30 minutes cause you wanna hatch camp like a cunt instead of just looking for the survivor, the final kill doesn't matter if you wanna get the 4k just fucking slug the third guy and go for the fourth.
---
That is the right attitude to have! Not about winning or losing to me either i just want to have fun! BUT one day i would like to know how it feels to get a 4K as a killer, it’s more of a personal goal than winning, you know what i mean?
---
The hatch can spawn in the basement?
---
Till you get the one survivor who tries to sandbag you with it
---
I really need to record games, wish I could have the video to show what went on. It was incredibly frustrating. You are absolutely right that I need to play more and get more experience.
---
 Nope
---
I don't recall so
---
hatch camp after i've killed all other survivors and there are multiple gens left that arent being worked on? right. 
---
you make no fucking sense. every killer runs to the hatch the second it's open and the exit gates aren't. you acting like this is some new, stupid strategy is you just being... well, stupid. 
---
i shouldn't have to slug to get a 4k. period. the game is flawed and needs to be fixed. 
---
This has only started in the last 2 days for me. I usually get lobbies instantly. As if this game isn’t broken enough already on console.
---
Aaaaahh I see what you are saying. Hmm. I'm not disagreeing with you, but take fortnite for example. They really crackdown on cheating and its still going pretty strong as far as I can tell. I guess it could go either way, truthfully.
---
Maybe toxicity is more of a console thing? I had gotten down to rank 4 and maaaaaan its just nothing but toxic saltiness. 
---
The teams you described is what I get for lower ranks, but shit once you reach 9 and higher its just public restroom of radioactivity increasing with each rank. I mean I'm exaggerating a little bit but thats been the bulk of my experiences with SWF or just "good" players in general
---
Fantastic guide [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jNOB95F6Dyv5MHCep_fu3w_wGVkpNFRUEPOcX-p92JQ/edit) by u/Mimikker 
---
My dreams are crushed
---
I don't know maybe it's because you're in Germany, my games on PS4 aren't as bad as you're saying at all.  I've been playing this constantly since September.
---
The only killer I can consistently convey that message with is Bing Bong. If you run back and forth, up and down the map hitting the wailing bell people come to see what you are doing. 
---
I guess an abattoir is a type of house... A (pig) slaughter house!
---
the hilarious part is if they meet a killer who can actually fuck their shit up, they just call it "imagine being this boring" and just quadruple dc, a bunch of sore losers.
---
Buddy slugging isn’t just used to secure the 4th. I slug all the time throughout the duration of the match with just about any killer because I can force someone off a gen to come and help while I instantly go chase someone else or attend to more pressing matters. It’s not greed mate it’s the better play when time is precious. Giving one free recovery totally negates many of the tactics involving slugging that the killer has available to them. If you were to make unbreakable baseline, what would you give killers in return? Baseline sloppy butcher? Baseline deerstalker? 
---
Actually Zubat completely agrees that pretty much 1-10 has barely any difference. Not sure what you're talking about,
---
I saved one off the hook in Basement and then hid in a locker and when the killer came down, the survivor that I had unhooked pointed at the locker to rat me out!!  thankfully the killer was hella cool and downed him and re-hooked him and let me get away.  I messaged him a TY after game. 
---
&gt;Safe hook rescue
---
yeah for her
---
&gt;I honestly think the majority of DBD players are of the participation-trophy generation. 
---
It's like you read my mind. I always think of Survivor players as that one kid playing tag who keeps changing the rules so that they win.
---
Two gens completed is hardly survivors playing on par with the killer. I play survivor as well, and when I see that two gens are done and there’s one survivor left, I want the killer to get the 4K. Nobody should be rewarded with mediocrity. There’s nothing more annoying to me than playing survivor and seeing the guy on the bottom of the list have hatch standoff’s which a killer that destroyed us. And also witnessing the same thing from a killers prospective of a survivor standing next to me on the hatch tea bagging. Either way, smash bros is a fun thing to do while I wait for the survivor who is tea bagging me to finally go off and work their first gen
---
Spirit. Thrill, devour or ruin, NOED. Prayer beads. Map offering like the game or something small. Ugh. I rather vs a 4 blink nurse. No counterplay. Just an angry anime girl grabbing you off gens. 
---
must not be wearing headphones
---
This is why I leveled up spirit ASAP. Got rancor on most of my killers for this daily in particular. 
---
I don’t use it every match obviously, but when I get this daily it gets equipped. 
---
They could’ve used a dull key
---
I've come across plenty of killers doing this too. Some outright admitting it with their steam name. They immediately disconnect as soon as the game starts, fucking everyone up
---
And the killer is on his way to tunnel/camp you right after lol 
---
"Doing gens, you?" Just sounds way more catchier.
---
The Hillbilly definitely went "Well alright, I'll take it."
---
Technician can. 
---
Each time!? (1/3)^30? The chances of that happening are literally 1/205,891,132,094,649. In other words, the chances of what you experienced occurring is one out of **two hundred trillion**. Let that sink in. That is around the equivalent to finding a specific second out of 6,000,000 years. You have found a lone atom in a planetary sized object. Congratulations!

---
Cool. But why sprint burst and dead hard 
---
It drives me up a wall when I try to give a Survivor hatch but they keep wiggling/escaping and run away from it.  Eventually I get fed up with it and just hook them if they're going to keep doing that nonsense.  
---
On the opposite end I have matches where folks immediately try to bargain and start crouch-spamming or so on without running and I have fun playing along since at the end of the day I just want bloodpoints and don't give a fuck about rank.  
---
for the memes people want to be asses and bm people
---
Dude your second sentence is what gets me fucked all the time. I never even thought about it.
---
Great tips. Thank you.
---
Yes, like that doesn’t happen anyway. Trolls gonna troll.
---
M&amp;A kind of works on any killer other than ironically, doctor. Getting just that little bit closer before they hear you coming is useful. y favourite monitor and abuse killer is the silent billy or jumpscare myers.
---
You get the points that you have acquired up until the point of disconnection, I got a -1 for it lol but I’m not bothered about that as I only play for fun not for rankings. 
---
Can't tell if serious or not. Diversion is one of those quirky perks that I would like to get good with, but I just aren't.
---
I doubt if it's a problem, its more likely spoofing and older update file that resets your rank. ZubatLEL did it on stream once to derank to 15. He launched the game and it showed patch notes for the Myers release and showed his ranks getting reset. He closed the game, launched the correct version and was rank 15 on the newest patch. He was rank 1 initially and it took like 60 seconds.
---
It's scummy as hell. Granted he did it when the emblems got released and rank 1 killer meant you didnt get any games so he did it to actually just play the game. Jen's swf group doesnt use it for that reason. They BM low ranked killers.
---
Nurse.
---
Love this. 
---
The 'if I win anyway then who cares' is a bit of a fallacy. You are right that you can win early even if you have those perks, but having a perk set with more utility will increase your chance of winning early, make it less likely you would ever need that insurance policy. That said, I can't fault anyone for using Bitter Murmur or Rancor, they are both totally playable and pretty fun perks. It is just a matter of outlook I guess.
---
The guy that replied to this is probably, right as stupid as it sounds when complimenting the other side use proper punctuation and don't use GG just say "Good Game man, you're really good at wraith, I had a lot of fun." people are a lot less likely to take that sarcastically. 
---
Unfortunately, yes.   RNG is fucked on my character apparently.
---
Add another 3 times to the list now.   33 times in a row now.
---
Sounds about right...I did that the other night
---
Or a key
---
I prefer premonition to spine chill. I know that spine chill is pretty strictly better, but spine chill just raises my tension through the roof the whole game with uncertainty about whether to respond to it, while premonition feels like it is just an alarm to move and hide because the killer is getting close.
---
Personally, many people will probably disagree, don't be scared of getting hit.  If you can avoid it don't get hit, but if the nearest and or safest pallets or vault is behind you, spin around, try and do a juke, and if you get hit you have a bit more distance to loop.  Obviously not when injured, but if you get hit then turn for the loop you can loose to much distance, I catch survivors all the time, because they turn around to run behind me for a loop after getting hit.  This isn't the most viable strategy but it might help
---
Hex perks are hit or miss, they can either never bead found or cleansed at the beginning of the match, which is why I don’t like using them.
---
I love that both of you guys were in it for *fun*. 
---
It wasn't about winning, or being toxic. You were both focused on having a good time. 
---
These are the kind of players I like to play with. :D
---
-a rare sighting in Dead by Daylight- 
---
Lmao this is me af 
---
Probably. If it's spawned already the last person tends to look for it instead of rescue.
---
Exactly what I did with hag when I still cared about ruin
---
Legion messed me up for a while because the perks that are good on him aren't really what you would use on any other killer and vice versa... Besides discordance, which I'm surprised people haven't lost their minds over yet, it helps out so so much.
---
Longer queue times and a boosted ego. 
---
As spirit, or all killers?
---
Console optimization is hard to create and there's a small team even though new content and bug fixes are constantly being work on.

But they have a team in place to deal with toxic players, cheaters, etc for PC but won’t expand that to console “yet”and that’s why there is so much toxicity on console- no repercussions.

At least you knew the traps were there with Small Game.

Lol, JenDenise. Man, what a bore. I actually literally witnessed her saying "DCing doesn't make you salty." She's like the queen of toxic survivors. I feel dirty for ever having watched her stream. At least No0b3 does it ironically, Jen actually defends her position. Totally entitled millenial brat. It's weird she's with ScottJund, since he's so laid back and cool.

Platinum trophy, finally got all the achievements
---
Players have a 3 in 5 chance of a hex totem they stumble across being lit if you run both ruin and haunting grounds since 3 of the 5 totems are lit. If they find a lit one, there is a 2/3 chance it is haunting grounds. There isn't really any way to predict what a hex might be from survivor point of view, so either you aren't being truthful about this, you haven't noticed when haunting ground has popped, or you are just astronomically unlucky to have this happen.
---
4S chess build, we physically cannot understand the efficiency
---
Being coherent is fun. Have you tried it?
---
If it's their third hook, not really weak at all. They want to escape and their chance of completing the gens and escaping while being the last survivor are minimal. 
---
Thad true 👿
---
Hey this happened to me yesterday! Me and my friend managed to farm to 20k bp 
---
On PS4 btw so not sure if PC already has that but certainly not seen one on console 
---
So causing a mild annoyance and losing against swf is better than team wide mories and instadowns... don't know about that
---
Dodge them, other than that itd be abused...
---
Pig is not weak
---
I mean, the solution is just kill him. 
---
Sometimes good perks or not you just get a team that hits you with the sweet sweet genrush so imo bringing one is more worth it than not. Personally not a big fan of bitter murmur unless I’m playing Freddy but Rancor is pretty dope on literally anyone that isn’t legion.
---
JEEZZZZZzZZZ
---
Oh man, I got that one from an AFK killer. We managed to find a key and complete it! Keep in mind, it was a SWF, but we still had 2 randoms.
---
They make a good point. I get that you don't want to be petty or anything but the behavior definitely won't stop if you don't try to do anything about it. 
---
I have a pretty decent escape rate playing solo without comms already (or at least I feel like I do). I dont see what would change besides getting hate because I didnt partake in comms and didnt do what teammate 1 ordered me to do. 
---
I'm a survivor main. Although I'm tempted to write down the psn names of the worst offenders and switch to killer just to find them. 
---
bubba trying his best to replicate billy space program
---
Just make your own topics for seperate, unrelated concerns.
---
They'll just have another hatch standoff. I think if the killer chooses to close the hatch, all generators are immediately finished. This makes it so that the survivor and killer have to choose between gates or the hatch.
---
Gives both sides an opportunity to win without a boring standoff.
---
Oooh. Gotcha. I thought you were a complaining killer. Which, would also be understandable. If you're playing with someone who points out other survivors, just try to work past it. Don't unhook them, let em die, and just do your own thing. If that doesn't work, try to hit up the killer during the match and tell them that the survivors bein a lil fuckboy and fuckboys needa be dealt with. 
---
?
---
Oh, so killing.
---
Nope
---
I still consider spirit as broken😈
---
Doc is trash
---
Because of course it's a Claudette. 
---
Never thought I'd see a time where Claudette's were more toxic than Nea and Laurie combined.
---
I imagine her reasoning in the chat after was something along the lines of:
---
"Getting Gens, you?" 
---
Can't always be perfect? I don't fucking want perfect. I want the game to be godamn playable. Jesus christ, there are games that look and play better than DBD on xbox, yet DBD runs at less than 20FPS. This isn't an "UwU its only 59fps lazy devs". The game is almost unplayable. Clearly literally any other dev is better because they can atleast manage 30fps. Consistantly.
---
Yep! Anywhere from 4-15% reduced action speed 
---
Killer pipping definitely needs a slight adjustment. It is really hard to depip as killer which leads to a ton of killers who are not ready for higher ranks. 
---
Not fun for anyone except survivors who get off on bullying killers. 
---
Ohhhhh congrats dude
---
If you have time to watch someone stand beside a hatch and comment about it for hours, feel free to do it. Chances are, the controller is on the couch and the player’s just left. 
---
Found this beam in the game today. No idea what caused it to appear, but it was on a pallet spot. lol
---
Nothing. It's just a beacon. Meant to say hey something's right here.
---
*infinite tier three commencing*
---
This is the sad reality of PS4.
---
And you. Can't really report these people. I've reported so many people for doing things like this, and for using hints like lag switches. Was told in my response ticket by the developer that unfortunately there's nothing they can do because Sony doesn't work with them on things like this and doesn't allow them the ability to ban people even if just from the game. 
---
And people on PS4 know this by now too and actively abuse it literally just in the name of trolling and shits and giggles. 
---
Fingers crossed that I can get a decent PC this tax season. It's time to blow this popsicle stand. 
---
Not happy that I will have to completely restart and rebuy cosmetics and DLC but PS4 is a toxic wasteland of trash for games like DBD and Overwatch now. It's virtually impossible to have any fun without a full group to play with. And not all of us have that luxury. 
---
Map add on
---
They are trying. Just because it's not happening instantly doesn't mean it won't happen. They have to rewrite the code, edit textures, remove background processes, edit particle effects, control how much internet data the game uses, make sure the killer and survivor don't have delay, than implement all of this into the game.
---
He has some deep fried emblems.
---
As the game gets older, people tend to forget about those mechanical things called gens. Just, do, gens. The problem about camping is survivors whining about it.
---
Thanks
---
Heard people say it adds like 6 or something seconds to gens
---
Oh, that makes sense. Thanks.
---
Ford are the #1 vehicle brand.
---
Did you make the joke? 
---
Yes. 
---
What did it cost?
---
24 downvotes.
---
Boo hop the survivors won. They’re toxic
---
Other way around, maybe. 
---
That’s because playing killer on PS4 right now is impossible. 
---
Just use your key when hatch is gonna be opened anyways, ez. 
---
He's slow and he has to use his power to even hit a person, even then after finding someone he has to wait a full seven seconds to do that. that means if he finds someone that's nearly done opening an exit gate it can be opened and they can escape before you can swing once. Also the concept isn't based around him passively passing, that's just so he's still partially visible, like in the movies when they aren't quite asleep but aren't quite awake they see flashes of him. So it's like the survivors haven't slept much. I mean if you were to make him solid it wouldn't change anything, it's just slightly less interesting. The main point is for his power to be used to slow them down, not to make him useable
---
I love doing this! I’ll burn coin offerings and go through the map and open up all the boxes leaving presents for my teammates but to bad they can’t do gens so we all die and don’t get to keep the nice goodies I gave them
---
I legit almost scrolled past this thinking it was another ad after reading the start of the title. 
---
Next patch is still a ways off. PC doesn't even have PTB yet.
---
r/wellthatsucks
---
That is part of the bug but the killer does not see the blood. At least when I played the wraith I had no idea about this bug and did not see anything the survivor ended up messaging me asking me if I saw what they saw 
---
You don't understand at all and you're gonna persist with random excuses until I give up trying to explain.
---
Haha no problem
---
You were lucky to have one kill in half those clips. I would consider going back
---
Well I'm comforted that it's not just me experiencing this. 
---
I know it’s not allowed but if you expose their usernames randoms can leave if they find these teamers in their lobby. 
---
How is other games looking better, running better, and having larger maps all at the same time just random excuses? The game has garbage spaghetti code, and the devs still haven't been able to optimize this game for over a year.
---
Play nurse stick with it and when you get good you can get your revenge on the bmers. 
---
Why is it intense situation like this is always with LF? 
---
? I’m a Survivor main, I’m not complaining about anything other than players ruining other players games and game functionality. Nowhere did I say anything about Survivor/Killer stuff.
---
The game has run perfectly fine before these past  5 months so I don't know why you're still saying it's been like this for a year.
---
The longer the match the more laggy it is it’s a pain in the ass. I like the wraith and I always have used sloppy 
---
Yeah, I mean I guess I just have to practice but its hard to learn when your up against insta-heal medkits and godboxes and flashlights. Hopefully they change the way depiping works.
---
If this was so I would request to have the saw chapter removed from my account so I never have to play the game again haha
---
I've been in games where I hook a survivor in the first 30 seconds, and am chasing a second survivor, the first survivor gets unhooked, and I still somehow lose 2 gens almost immediately.
---
I play survivor, I get chased by the killer for 3 minutes, and no gens get done. This game is going to fuck with my blood pressure.
---
But they have a team in place to deal with toxic players, cheaters, etc for PC but won’t expand that to console “yet”and that’s why there is so much toxicity on console- no repercussions.
---
That’s a typical killer crying.  
---
What game are you talking about? I've been playing on console since christmas 2017 and it's been bad since then, I honestly think it's gotten worse even. Even then, even if it was only 5 months, that should be enough time for the devs to fix it, since it is such a huge problem.
---
Freddy
---
Perks: dying light, thanataphobia, ruin. 
---
Addons: class photo, black box
---
 Green or ebony mori
---
Instant dying light, then keep all survivors with insane gen slowdown between constant dream state thanataphobia and ruin. 
---
DCs guaranteed. 
---
Im going to use sloppy with doctor lol amd bring a ebony with thanathaphobia so it gets harder and dyinglight
---
You don't understand how hard it is to fix garbage code without breaking the game. Also, you can ask the entire sub and they'll say it's only been for the past couple of months so if it's been ever since you got the game then that's a you problem.
---
Same issue every time I’ve had the ritual 
---
Because he’s the king of the basement and the best killer if you wanna camp.
---
No, blocking them has no effect in the game.
---
I reworked it! Thanks again btw!
---
Also should let you know that the 5 seconds is for aura reading time, not time for hatch opening. 
---
If there were more than two survivors in the match, the hatch will automatically close after 30 seconds, regardless of what key or addons your using. 
---
No it’s not. Player working with killer to sandbag the other 3 teammates, definitely not a Killer complaint. Killer saying as soon as all 5 gens are done he is pulling his Ethernet cord/hard DCing so no one gets points, again, not a Killer complaint. Do *you* even play as Survivor on console? Or just post antagonistic comments to be annoying for no actual purpose?
---
I mean, she clearly did it on purpose....
---
??
---
Still fugly. 
---
\^What he said.
---
Just an evolved, limited survivor way of communication. 
---
When in mine masks the survivors chat is paused.
---
DBD has a bad habit of punishing people for succeding and rewarding bad play. Think about this, survivors are punished for avoiding the killer and rewarded for running into them.
---
Yes the guy with the comically high gay voice, right?  If you took everything wrong with the world, threw it all together and created a person from it, you'd get that thing.  
---
You know, I totally forgot about Dying Light when I reworked it originally. Haha
---
Would putting back in the original bit about I had where the remaining Survivors get a boost to their aura-reading range after the sacrifice been sufficient or should I think of something else?
---
I agree, sorry just assumed 
---
It was fixed in 2.4.
---
Really? A firecracker makes them the best randoms. Christ.
---
Poor Scott.  Deathly allergic to cats, has to live with 8 of them because of his doofus girlfriend.  
---
I'm gonna say this. Playing killer has always been bad for me framewise, and there has been a massive delay in hitting skillchecks. Literally since the first time I've played. Which was christmas 2017. Also for the last fucking time really read this, every other game I play runs fine, it is just dead by daylight.
---
That's a you problem, it's run perfectly fine for everyone else.
---
I mean if you think so just don't watch his content
---
Make me
---
I'm more interested in the context of the picture.  The dog is like wtf while the boy is chilling in the floor eating snack while someone who is walking in has obviously given up pulling them out so they are just feeding them and they have become a floor human. Still a great excuse to get out work though .  
---
Reminds me of the nurse glitch where when she dropped you from you struggling/flashlighting  , youd get stuck in the floor.   One time I was dropped on stairs and only my head popped out.  
---
Do you want even more people to crouch around wasting minutes of time needlessly and being more deadly than the actual killer? This is how you get that.
---
Then why does everyone want console optimization? If the game runs fine, surely there is no problem. Also, surely everyone I play with is just lying when they say they also have similar problems. God guess I'm just so silly, because console runs on 60fps for everyone just fine!
---
Yeah, [it can get pretty bad] (https://youtu.be/HChmrcZD-bg) even when you're not infinitely spurting blood.
---
Create by a map add-on so a survivor can make a beacon for his team. To mark the hatch, exit, gem to work o , etc
---
Oh look, you've been ignoring everything I've been saying. I guess me saying everything has been fine for everyone except for the past couple of months which is when everyone started asking for optimization but i guess you'll just ignore that 
---
im using
---
Halloween is cancelled cuz y’all don’t know how to act
---
-_- u taking this as a argument instead of a point of view, DUH it's for the felt "need" of balance and to that statement, u only get bullied when u allowed it -_- those survivors tea bagging u at exit gate,  did u allow 5 gems finished? Did u decide to tunnel?, were u camping one hook and they saved ur kill?  What are u expecting only killer mains reasons and act like it's not possible to main both and understand each side
---
To bad survivors. You killers think Mori makes you good, noed definitely means your trash. What rank are you 
---
And yet you still demolished them. How is the subreddit not losing their mind right now. This should be impossible!
---
Thanks for the info, I didn't even know people used maps lol
---
It wouldn't do anything. They've already added an Emblem penalty for camping. The campers didn't care. They won't care if it takes longer for the Survivor to die, they'll still wait. The only one being punished would be the camped Survivor.
---
They do on occasion, but not that often from what I’ve seen
---
Can't do nothing but deal with it. Buffing survivors or killers would ruin the game. The fact that killer and survivor mains argue over who is more op just shows how balanced it is.
---
Use frank’s mix tape and stop crying. I’m playing him at Rank 1 and managing, even without it. Your suggestion is massively OP. Maybe a little more damage to the timer when you hit again without add ons, and maybe it takes longer to mend the wound.
---
Rank 1. I’m not saying that using these makes the killer good, it just makes it more challenging for players to escape. 
---
killers already get gen-rushed to shit within the first minute, and now you want to nerf them more? having to down and hook someone 12 times with all the flashlights, pallet stuns, and DS users, and you actually want to give survs MORE time? ok sure, make gens take 20% longer, and skill checks more difficult then.
---
You actually just said it runs perfectly fine for everyone else.
---
It’s more than easy to punish a killer for camping.
---
The problem is that it’s boring.
---
As much as I love this game, the objective of doing generators is the most boring part and is the reason camper killers aren’t punished.
---
Says who? You? 
---
Same in U.S.. In the past 5 hours I've only had 5 games. I just recently got out of my 5th and the killer quit after I popped ruin after powering through a gen at the start then after I did the totem 2 more gens were done and she still hasn't hooked anyone... So 4 games and 1 DC game in 5 hours. Match making is so fucked.
---
But based on what I've said in the past 3 comments I thought you would've been smart enough to realize what I mean.
---
Sorry but honestly weirdly attracted to fictional serial killer. Not even irl ones lol 
---
The problem is the survivors “rewarding” the camper by throwing themselves at the killer trying to save the one on the hook. Especially at lower levels, so new killers get conditioned to hook and camp waiting for altruistic survivors to come to the reacue
---
There’s nothing to “fix.” Face camping only works against bad survivors who will sit there for 2 minutes until the survivor dies and the facecamping ends. Against good survivors, 2-3 gens will finish in this time, forcing the killer to stop face camping, opening an opportunity for saves. 
---
There’s not an upside
---
Are you talking about the legs sticking out of the trash bag?
---
I know, first time mori is so good
---
Neither. You aren't really a smartass for trolling the killer in exit. A smartass would be someone who for example runs towards the 90% gen right behind you while you are about to pick someone up. Then you turn around and down the smartass who though he is so clever.
---
Low rank 
---
PS4. I’m not saying I use those perks lmao idk why you’re asking my rank 
---
Fucking billy mains
---
Darth Vader has really let himself go.....
---
A firecracker, body-blocking, and trying to take hits (both in the basement and after - the Laurie made sure to run behind him to keep him from getting hit again) to save a random survivor being basement camped by Leatherface after the exit gates are opened is pretty damn impressive. Most randoms would just leave you because going into the basement where there’s a camping LF is suicide 99% of the time.
---
Because that’s a crutch build ppl on high ranks use to get 2 kills 
---
Because that’s a crutch build ppl on high ranks use to get 2 kills
---
Why is this NSFW?
---
Yep I know it is, and I think it’s pretty BS 
---
I've had this happen to me on PS4 as killer. I was the Spirit and all I could see was her running endlessly with no end of match screen and I was unable to exit.
---
I had to close application. I'm pretty sure I got my BP for the match though.
---
I literally said other games that look better, and are bigger, run better than DBD. The problem is with DBD, and DBD alone. Meaning the problem is that the devs ported it poorly.
---
I actually play killer a lot, but I don’t face camp so was unaware of them losing bp until now. The amount of times I have you can count on your hand probably. Which were for your first two reasons. I’ve been playing more survivor lately and that’s why it bothers me so much to see how often people face camp. It ruins the game for everyone I know. 
---
Most people tend to agree that (discounting nurse because she is an outlier) survivors have a greater potential power, it is just that you need to get into the higher levels of the game before that really manifests. At the early game, killers are better just because it is easier. In the middle ranks is where there is the best balance.
---
Aye bruh he’s talking about when you use said third party software to give yourself an unfair advantage, and then abuse that advantage. I don’t care if I play a swf that’s just chillin and hanging out but damn is it annoying to have one guy find my totem and suddenly that shit is gone within 10 seconds and everyone’s over there. Stuff like that is frustrating so why put up with that when I can just play survivor and chill and have a nice easy experience. Sure enough once double BP ended, and the people who were solely playing killer for BP left, people are suddenly on reddit complaining about long queue times for their swf groups. Why take the chances with an swf, and my queue times are like 5 seconds anyways bc there are so many survivors lined up tryna get a match that my lobby will just fill up instantly, so if I see 4 people load up at the same time and I’m not feeling it then I’ll just back out and make a new lobby. That’s the issue with any party chat software that people have.
---
The problem is xbox not working correctly with dbd which is an issue that should be fixed by microsoft.
---
*VROOM*
---
So then what's the point of the optimization patch?
---
Edit. I fucked up. Misread
---
I thought the title was sarcastic so I was pleasantly surprised by the end of this. I wish I had randoms like this in my games, instead I just keep getting Claudettes who sandbag me and teammates who let me die on first hook as of late. :(
---
To fix optimization on consoles for current problems. But the issue on xbox is that it never worked with xbox which should be fixed by microsoft.
---
Text back “k”. A lot of “trolls” hate it because it negates what they were expecting from you and there just isn’t anything they can text back that counters a simple k.
---
Lol she's not going to bang you, dork.
---
I don't usually condone noed, but that guy deserved it. Good for you my guy
---
All good, yea I agree that these are just crutches that bad killers need to get kills. Same with decisive strike on survivors. 
---
I actually had to google orbiter because I've never heard of it in my life but it sounds like some incel thing which makes a lot of sense tbh
---
That's just slightly feminized Frank cuz they lazy.
---
Wonder what those are?
---
Lightly salted indeed; It's only 10% less than a lethal dose!
---
Seth Rogen, whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!?!
---
Good to know you're coping being an incel. It's the first step.
---
Doesn't that just cause all survivors to auto-escape?
---
why does the doctor look like he has down syndrome
---
Learn to play the bloodweb. 4 buys then it takes one 
---
Very much so, yes.
---
It's made for 3 shirtless David's and a Bill.
---
Blood Warden is satisfying as hell, I don't run noed but the salt enough from blood Warden is hilarious. When I play survivor and I get to the gates I leave as should every other survivor if no one is hooked.
---
Oh I thought it was a way to get the animation of escaping the hook, cause I’ve seen them click and click and then they come off the hook
---
“Even the babies are one of the most dangerous in the world so I put these bear traps down and- OH MY GOD”
---
~famous vine maybe
---
Yes it is a known bug. I personally haven't had it happen to me but the fix is to close the game and when you launch it again you do get your bloodpoints, luckily.
---
Haha, yeah. I don't normally run NOED, but I was doing an end game build on Pig. Saved all my traps for the last bit too, with six jigsaw boxes to reduce their chance of escape even more. It was incredibly satisfying. 
---
I realised you said cut your PS4 off? I assume you turned it off don't do that just exit the game. And if it still didn't give you your BP then that is unfortunate.
---
Bill would be so proud!
---
You fuckin kidding me 50% to repair speed.  Is face camp city his new map too
---
It is pretty unlikely to be a game bug. A bug is unlikely to persist through that many games, or to produce a result like that.
---
But all of Legion's perks suck.
---
I run Ruin, Haunted Grounds and Thrill of the Hunt on Freddy.
---
Occasionally Ruin goes first, but usually it's HG.
---
I do Play other Killers, also it's only a small temporary speed boost. In which wrath does just as well, if not better. And if the obsession lives? When going against Freddy I always assume they have remember me and protect the obsession as much as possible. And even if i do manage to sleep everyone while using remember me one person can loop me while the exit Gates get done due to my speed, because looping Freddy is pretty damn easy.
---
It's just plain stupid that to use a basic attack I have to struggle to find someone, then wait seven seconds. Still get looped for normally a minute in which case they can have completed at least two gens possibly more, for that person to get unhooked and healed while I'm getting lead around again and before my second hook the gates are powered. Sometimes survivors make mistakes which can get me a hit. But then while using remember me I have to try and find a specific survivor which can slow me down even more. I do better playing as litteraly any other killer. I once got stuck as tier one Michael when I tried to grab a survivor and got locked in the animation, I finally got out with one gen left and still got a 3k before they got the last one. Freddy is just straight up not a good killer.
---
Ahhh, okay.
---
Didn't get it at all it would seem.
---
Sorry to have wasted your humor.
---
Bing bong boi isn’t great without some investment every round, but I appreciate you for bringing his music to this forsaken land (unless you camp like every wraith I face)
---
The trapper tantrum omg. I love him. 
---
The first bug that made me laugh was one I posted about before (damn was that a year ago holy shit...) but basically none of the player models loaded at all on the menu and it was somehow creepy and funny at the same time. First time I experienced laughter that turned nervous.
---
Good times...
---
Not every game. Frank’s makes him really strong, but he’s perfectly fine without it. 
---
I'll take them socket swivels hell ya
---
Holy shit what a paragraph - but, no, I get what you mean. I'm just tired of hearing Freddy needs reworked, because honestly there are a lot more pressing problems with the game than a Freddy rework. 
---
Best meem! I tried leaving yellow gifts on the escape pads and no one took either of them (we had a nice Doctor, which was the real shocker...) I was thinking about running this today, but Ace's skills are so....unfortunate...
---
Your character will scream too when exposed from it.
---
I’ve watched a lot of people play the game as killer. I’ve watched Squanchy70 play the game as killer. You can literally win the game without face camping whatsoever. I’ve seen a lot of great respectful killers out there, but I’ve also seen the ones that claim camping is a legit strategy. I’m also on console, and out of all the games I’ve played today, majority of them were a bunch of face campers. I see no reward in doing so, and I absolutely despise it. It’s really dumb to camp one person as the rest finish up the gens, like don’t you want bloodpoints? (Because I know I like getting a bunch!) Killers camp, and then in the end they have NOED, so what’s the point? It makes the game less entertaining.
---
Nurse is definitely S rank in a rank of her own because she ignores much of the game's mechanics. I'd put huntress at A rank because if you learn the concept of hitboxes and learn to mind game windows and pallets you can be very terrifying, just takes plenty of time and practice just like the nurse but so damn rewarding.
---
Huh, never knew an exact(ish) number. Thanks! 
---
Killers don’t dominate low rank either. Most run moris and are lucky to get 2 kills
---
I think it's in everyone's best interest to see it gone.
---
It's annoying, damages keyboards/controllers over time, can ruin YouTube vids, can get you killed via lag and allows people to prematurely kill themselves to give others the hatch.
---
Nah, no need to apologize, and especially not for asking a question. Thanks! Have a happy new year!
---
As a rank 1 killer I have to disagree pickles are great.
---
But you aren’t limited to using his perks? And I would not say discordance sucks. 
---
Happy New year :]
---
That sounds good on paper but in my experience 2-3 gens are more of a reason to camp the next survivor. That also means and player doesn’t play anymore after the first few minutes because they get camped. People spend their free time to have fun not die slowing until within the first few mins. 
---
humor is pretty subjective after all and I seem to have an overabundance of bad humor so it appears impossible to waste...
---
It's honestly scary as shit. I remember hiding nearby as a fellow survivor gets mori'd by the Hag
---
yeah but you'll have to do that before 5 gens are done
---
I can get lobbies at 3 in the morning
---
Lack of killers queuing up lately 
---
Even the ones that are unique? (As rare as they are) and don't feature the typical "Jason, hide in lockers, disguise as survivors" things we've come to expect from fan chapters
---
They should change it to a hold
---
Good luck killing more than one survivor with that add-on
---
How is cleansing dull totems a secondary objective? If there’s a HEX then I’ll agree but cleansing dull totems doesn’t help you escape or anything for that matter. A single perk shouldn’t make a killer into a lunging chainsaw. Even when cleansing all the totems it doesn’t slow the game down noticeably.  To say it’s an important role is , I would say it only empowers camping. “Do gens all you want because when you do, it’ll be even easier for me to camp you!”  That’s my evil guy monologue lol (Maybe this role you speak of was from when early day of the game, I’m not sure). 
---
Be careful, people get real butt hurt when you point out just how easy she is. Again like you nothing against op, spirit is very fun, she is however, very VERY strong and unlike nurse, she really doesn’t take any special plays to compensate. Add a mori and prayer beads and if you don’t 4k well...
---
You were sweaty too though. But you did win though...
---
Not PS4 but Infinity V for mobile is great and DBD Devs even helped the Devs with it
---
One shot hatchets man. OP af
---
Noed doesnt affect hatchets. 
---
Yeah, that was a very recent change.  Previously a single click on their name would open the psn interface with them whereas now you’d have to go manually type out their name and search it.  Since the change I haven’t gotten a single piece of direct hate mail.  Will still try to message someone if they pulled off something especially cool or whatever.
---
BING BONG i want
---
Isn’t there a way you can report his psn account though? I’m not familiar with how it works on PlayStation but on Xbox if you keep getting reported often your profile reputation eventually will go down to “avoid me” status which makes it harder to find matches in some games.
---
IDENTITY THEFT IS NOT A JOKE NEA
---
Clearly you just got out played my dude. /s
---
Agreed, but I’d like to think there’s a way to fix that. I’m positive my idea isn’t the answer but merely a way bring more view point into consideration. 
---
I guess, maybe that’s the legion fix let them have a friend play pig and crouch in the background for the kill
---
Goddess* :)
---
If this works for more people we should make it known, spread it around. Let me know if it works.
---
Also, if we were on WiFi - we NEVER find games. Always use the CABLE, all of you must be on cable, if one of you is on WiFi, it screws everybody - trust me, we tried all possible shit to play it together :))
---
last year the nightmare just came out on discord its pretty awesome if you want another game like this
---
Eager Eggs. Every single map has a golden toolbox on it.
---
Piggy just wants to be like the survivors. But to honest this was just one big ad for a Discord server
---
Was hoping to see this comment so I didn't have to post myself
---
its really good late game when you get downed near exit gates.
---
They look pretty neat.
---
*cant find you*
---
Get a team of 4 using breakdown and sabateur, then tell me it is useless. It is niche, certainly, but it isn't useless.
---
All they need to do is implement a MLGA feature and show the Killer's name.
---
Oooooh
---
Yeah

Altho LY can get boring v quick if you dont have friends to be fair. 
---
Found you bitch
---
Just be nice to the survivors in a farming game, you're bound to get it sooner or later
---
I don’t see how downing someone in 3 hits, with the ability to vault windows and pallets sucks. 
---
This is singlehandedly the best post on this sub.
---
Yes, I can’t play right now. Maybe in an hour
---
I like them especially the ones made for springtrap from fnaf since a lot of work wa spit into it
---
I'll be in bed in an hour it's 3:32 am where I live 
---
Sad. Maybe tomorrow
---
White noise
---
I actually have a few but I'll tell you my most recent one. 
---
During the event I decided I would try playing the wraith. I generally won my matches but was constantly bullied. No more than usual so I took it in stride.
---
However one survivor, adam francis, decided to make my match as much of a living hell as he could. 
---
We were playing on Haddonfield which isn't a favorite of mine but hey double XP, right?
---
Mr. Deliverance could barely keep his god tier flashlight hand from shaking the entire time and would body block, teabag and blind me at every opportunity. He even went and traded his flashlight from a chest for one of fireworks, which he used and then went and got his flashlight back. Or he traded it I'm not sure. All around me gens are being done
---
With the chips down, and this asshole's incessent tyranny, I still managed to sacrifice his teammates. 
---
Then he hid and I, literally, walked the entire map looking for him or the hatch.
---
Lo and behold(mind you I'm invisible) I find him standing on top of the hatch teabagging. He actually sees me coming, points and continues to teabag. 
---
What this POS doesn't know is that I'm a fucking super saiyan jedi badass that was sick of his shit. 
---
I approached from behind a tree breaking line of site, bing bonged, and caught his ass right as he tried to jump in. Never have I been satisfied so satisfied to hook someone. 
---
Made sure to stand in front of the camera, nod and bingbong so he could watch me and himself. 
---
I could just taste his salty tears I swear.
---
Scranton Strangler and Dwight Schrute DLC?
---
Of course but be warned I almost exclusively play dbd on pc so I'm a low rank (high rank?)

---
It is a secondary objective because NOED is a potential force in the game and you don't know if it is there or not. If the killer has NOED, not having done the dull totems puts you in a dangerous position. but it still isn't required to win. It is the very definition of a secondary objective. The important role though is making cleansing dull totems worthwhile. NOED is unquestionably above the power curve. But the reaosn it is that strong is so survivors are forced to respect NOED as a legitimate threat and take the measures to stop it coming out. NOED's role in the game isn't to give killers a free win it is to slow the game down by incentivising survivors to cleanse the dull totems so that NOED can't give the killer it's big advantage.
---
I’m very low surv rank too. I’m good at surv but I always play killer
---
Two DCed, that's hilarious.
---
Evolve ^^lul
---
I looked that word up and was confused. It said to be like a pendant, then the example said it in the same way of the essays were pedantic. So i looked at the alternative meanings to pendant and found nothing for it
---
So use a brown one with insta and extra charges
---
What rank are you that you managed to get EW3 with both red add-ons and still get 3 kills before the gens are done?
---
The ones with actual care put into them are nice. Though a lot reuse the same three concepts
---
I'm both but on pc I'm a super high rank with killer
---
I’m killer rank 10 or 11
---
Go to bed happy, I mean (hopefully). Sorry if Santa sAce didn't get you what you wanted, hope the year does or you do that thing you want!
---
Me too somewhere around there 
---
Wooo, I'm famous 😉
---
Great
---
I may be guilty of this 
---
Gotta keep that yellow toolbox though D:
---
Just a little easter egg hidden in each map (excluding the original twelve) by the map designers.
---
A little idea I had after seeing the [*rediculous amount of wasted space on the Match Details screen.*](https://imgur.com/a/h9PNh8S)
---
That’s an interesting idea, it addresses another crap part of being camped. Getting a whopping 3,000 bp...yay 
---
Even though a lot are uninspired I don’t think that makes them worthy of scorn, they’re just trying to add some stuff to the community is all.
---
None of his perks do any of those things.
---
You're comparing apples and oranges.
---
I don’t mind them as long as they fix the stupid hanging on joining a game. It’s been 50/50 for me recently. 
---
Deathgarden omegalul
---
You are definitely speaking facts, but the topic of this post was about camping and I’ll stay in my lane about that. The problem with NOED is when a killer camps someone to death, you have to punish them with gen but that plays into NOED and having to find and cleansing all the totems only makes camping more viable. To time it would take to do both objectives is way beyond the time it take for a person to die on the hook. In that situation, which sadly seem to be the majority, the killer in overpowered. (Again, I’m on console so maybe it’s different on pc)  
---
This video is glorious 
---
Wait... Are you being serious. Someone thought permanently destroying one of the limited gens there are was a good idea? 
---
The shapeshifting one i actually get really annoyed with. I feel liek that is one of the main reasons fan chapters are disliked so much. Everyone has become so used to seeing that same thing over and over again.
---
Also yea, the complexity really kills a killer sometimes. Legion being a prime example. Though it seems that seems to be the direction the devs are going with how spirit and legion are. They have so many extra details, and while spirit was turned into a really great killer. Legion will sadly be in his state for awhile, at least according from what I heard
---
Complete with an extra long dinner table in the dining room to loop around
---
the near seamless loop on this video had me SO confused for a minute. amazing chainsaw though!
---
Probably the best totem map in the game. Impossible to find all five
---
Franks mix tape, and iridescent button don’t do those things?  
---
Damn right. I just wish I could go through the exit gates with my fellow survivors
---
Let them unhook then chase the dude who unhooked. Simple 
---
well, at first I was infuriated. but thinking for a second realised swfs can already know. it won't bring disbalance, just make random teams little closer to swfs. pretty good idea, op. 
---
but for that I'd think they should make perks(endgame screen) invisible till everyone is dead/escaped so swfs haven't had the perk from heavens(where a dead brother knows and warns alive ones of killer's perks). cause it's bullshit that endgame perks are completely useless if one member of swf is dead. 
---
I don’t understand this meme
---
Then just admit you're wrong instead of persisting in arguing something you're completely ignorant about? My god, this subreddit and making people be idiots in arguing topics...
---
Same
---
Just what I thought.
---
I was actually right though. They just continued to persist with the same argument when I already proved them wrong so I just said something dumb so they can shut up already.
---
....Lol. There really is nothing else to say to you.
---
I prefer brutal strength to enduring unless you are running spirit fury alongside it. But I am more defensive and would rather bait the pallet than swing through it. Both make great moves  though for keeping the chase going.
---
I don't have a dick at all, why? I am a girl! Someone's obviously sexist to assume all gamers are men! 
---
The information has tons of counterplay and even counterperks now. All the while the information has to compare to a whole entire perk. Look at Sloppy Butcher or NOED in that regard which both have immense pure value which "those information" has to compare to.
---
Those ones always annoy me. I've made concepts in the past, but I try making them look like the chapter spotlights that dbd does. Where they go over the killer, their backstory. Then their power and perks. Quick and efficient. 
---
Though yea, making perks is definitely the hardest part to fan chapters as they aren't the killer, but they should help the killer they came with while also being viable to others and not to op on others.
---
I did enjoy when people would give their tweaks and most of the time they were really good and only benefitted the fan chapter.
---
The locker concept is so dumb, though one good take I saw was a killer using them as a way to teleport around the map. But even with that, it came it's fair sharw of issues
---
You are correct, there isn't so stop trying to drag the argument so far.
---
I get you, they're really overdone. 
---
Dang, really? This whole time I thought it meant that the killer ISN'T camping, and to come help and unhook, lol.
---
It's funny how the launch trailer showed a completely different and better power. Imagine a Freddy sized tier 1 Meyers that had M&amp;A, balanced out by a transition to attack form like Wraith. It would also get rid of future fan chapters about disguised killers
---
Yeah why does no one play him he’s bad ass
---
Then stop spreading misinformation on topics you are completely incorrect about.
---
I made 2 comments that were full of bullshit so that both of you would stop responding which worked until I responded. Everything else has been completely true.
---
Once I crouched walked into a building, only to see someone get Mori'd by a Michael at the basement entrance
---
Im serious. Because nobody is using it, killers get so easily tricked with it even on high ranks. 
---
It's just it's natural color, just like the school nurse let the kid choose the color of his bandage.
---
Well actually with the Ultra rare mori I've had a few 4k games so? Not that bad at it.
---
or during the winter event, ace in the hole was worthless if you received a winter party starter. no add-ons for those..
---
[Yeah, you're embodying this so far.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/738/025/db0.jpg)
---
No that's fine I understand what you're saying! That's probably why I've been getting 4k moris whenever I have the ultra rare offering. Another thing i noticed too with the weak mori offering (idk what it's called) it says you can only kill the last survivor, but you can actually kill the last two? Had a couple of matches where I was able to kill one, then kill the last person at the gate.
---
In all honesty though, I played the shit out of Spirit yesterday and on balance I played far far more normal games rather than an all out murder spree.
---
Have now completed all the base game adept killer perks on PS4. Main piece of advice is to stick to a killer's standard perks and don't use any add ons until you get the trophy. Once that's done start thinking about the other two trophies for that killer. Will take longer with some compared to others (Hag by level 13, Nurse about level 30), but really just keep practicing with the standard load outs.
---
Shut the fuck up it's only a game for fuck sake. 😂
---
I'm glad someone noticed 💁🏻‍♀️🔪
---
It was “doing gens, you?” Not getting
---
&gt;  Deliverance, Hope
---
Dwight, I am your father.
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
---
No, you need to share him. It's not fair.
---
The quitter mentality isn’t rational. It’s hurtful. *Spiteful.* It seeks to give nothing and take everything. If they’re going to lose, they might as well make sure you can’t win. 
---
[actually](https://prnt.sc/m3nesu)
---
If they didn't nerf survivor vaulting so badly and buff killer vaulting...
---
Scratch marks are bugged again too :) So, nerfed sound &amp; visual cues for killers, yay!
---
yeah that’s what i’ve been hearing... i’m gonna get a pc soon! won’t have to deal with it then hahaha
---
It was :)
---
An idea that was proposed in a thread I made before was to instead add a togglable state that turns your aura from red to blue/green to indicate to other survivors that you can't/can be unhooked and the killer can't see what state you've switched to.
---
You'd use red if the killer was camping you and you didn't want team mates to come get you yet(This also prevents unsafe unhooks/survivors griefing each other). Keep the M1 Struggle option for Phase 1 of being on the hook, keep the struggle animation, but get rid of the button mashing and instead have it that holding M1 while in the struggling animation means you stop struggling.
---
Deliverance is one of the best perks in the game as it can remove all killer pressure and Hope can make loops incredibly long.
---
Most of us weren’t playing bc we were waiting until the optimization patch lmao
---
Were you just in my game earlier tonight at Yamaoka (not sure how to spell it but the bamboo map) he put you in the basement and just camped the stairs? 
---
What platform?
---
I completely forgot about that ps4
---
Dam rip , I’m an Xbox nub

Yeah dw , those were just sketches , and you credited

You need to be on the Gen as it completes. Which is kind of a shame because it'd be pretty damn useful if it was whenever a Gen completed in general.

What do you need to do on it? Also if you don't find anyone here there is r/dbdlfg

Nea is no longer a dude

Uh just looking for people to play with and thank you
---
It is totally wrong in german. It clearly states WHILE REPAIRING XD
---
AFHHHHHFGH, you're fucking killing me, brother!
---
Name the survivor, you gotta convince me!!
---
Cross mapping is key
---
Most, not all. It started with Haddonfield and every map since then has one.
---
Nice find. Completely forgot to search for this myself.
---
&gt;Co's plays
---
You fucking butchered that word 
---
If a Survivor is added, make it Sebastian from The Evil Within. 😍
---
I'm looking for 115% until they pick you up, then they can frogleap 500%, and if they land at a hook, you tear in half with a fireworks display kicking off at the killer shack.
---
Let's be clear about this - girls getting views because they're a girl says more about the male demographic watching them then it does about the streamer.
---
Oh shit, awesome 
---
FEATURING DANTE from DMC!!
---
The ostrich is clearly out of place and not normally a thing they see. So they ask what he has and I guess he's dumb or whatever because he thinks they are asking about his smoothie.
---
This feels like the third time i've seen this exact one.
---
thats... true tho...do you live under a rock or something?
---
I'd say it's people that aren't Freddy mains that say he is fine.
---
Killer needs harder requirements to pip, legion needs to be disabled until rework, behavior needs to fix console fps if they give a shit about the platform.
---
Pick zero of those things to happen.
---
As I just literally responded, if a girl is getting views from horny dudes then that says more of the male viewers than the steamer.
---
What do you want girls to do? Wear a blanket on stream with eye holes?
---
Hey maybe you could do something productive instead of blaming girls and maybe write a post reflecting on why male streamers aren't sexually harassed and targeted like this but why women can't?
---
Honestly Joker/Ren for survivor and Goro/Black Mask as killer WHEN @devs???
---
GET cote ON THE fucking LINE, WE HAVE business!
---
I deleted that app just yesterday, since I finally started my Cowboy Bebop opening theme idea. I miss it dearly.
---
Hmmm interesting point 
---
Killer gets points lol
---
😢 at least it was replaced by cowboy bebop thouhh
---
Or when you watch someone get mori'd with object
---
I’m hoping it’s a licensed killer, it’s been roughly a year since we last got one. 
---
Cursed image 
---
Holy fuck it would crack me up to hear the heartbeat and shit only for it to be feng min coming around the corner

I'm gonna get back to this smoke, if this thread is still here tomorrow, I'll link a video of my old theme.

#THICCCCCCCCCCNESS
---
I meant the shit spelling. Why was that needed?
---
I used the Event to get all perks on Legion.
---
But I think they will not add more any time soon, considering how ti breaks the item economy.
---
Example: My addon collection + 57 Ebony Moris
---
https://i.imgur.com/HRmD0e9.jpg
---
... and it's working :(
---
Yes
---
New killer just a hook that slides around the map?
---
yikes.
---
Where have you been all my life? Fucking writes itself, but here we are, with you in the driver's seat.
---
It’s a matchmaking issue, games are sometimes instant others are broken
---
Clearly xjake because bois make better girls
---
That would have to be an rainbow item tho
---
Oh please give Clown the „Benny Hill Theme“ just getting louder and faster as he comes closer :D starting at medium volume and like 70% speed when you enter his TR and playing super loud and at like 150% speed when he’s right behind you
---
I'm willing to bet many money that we will not see another licensed killer until the next cycle, if ever.
---
It was the boxes that destroyed economy, not the double bp, and if thats the case make rare stuff rarer. The perk grind needs a help, more so for survivors 
---
I mean they should hide killers perks in endgame screen till everyones dead before they do that
---
The 2 on the bottom are always in my survivor matches.
---
The 2 on the top are always in my killer matches. 
---
But it's Christmas...

Could of ran around the closer side! :/

You're not a terrible Bubba. Bubba's a terrible killer.

People rank up way too fast in this game. I bet a lot of salt and balance discussions would change if you faced players who are on the same level as you.

White noise 2 for console

Oh thought they added them to the old maps in the end.
---
Exactly! I masturbated furiously to it.

---
Care I think your CG is actually trying the new "hot" trend if you see what I mean.
---
Yeah x could've just screamed and hid out of the way, i guess some ttauma was needed
---
Almost as scary as a Nea running towards you 
---
That applies to DBD though, even more too with how shitty people are in solo queue. 
---
If you want to. 
---
I'd say Deliverance is pretty meta, as of now. I could agree with Hope not being meta but it's a really nice perk to run nonetheless.
---
U get 5000 bp
---
Right now, fog's thick anyways, the offerings are there to show you they're preparing to blend.
---
Damn seeing how nea is my favorite that kinda hurt :( 
---
That's the work of my phone, won't let me change it either, no pc for another few days to change it either. 
---
Lately i have had to start running borrowed time because damn those killers b pitchin a tent lately
---
Well you get more BP with BBQ so thats another thing why I always take it.
---

-BBQ and Chili
---
-Ruin

-Enduring

-Spirit Fury

We're gonna live forever !
---
I will be the first to DC when I am playing Rank 1 and see 2 survivors without any perks.
---
if it's not 115% I'll probs not buy it at the very least. 
---
I know. it is the best perk, but with the bug/s it's useless.
---
She's my second favourite too but I always thought it's the running joke that she's basically as scary as a killer. But if a Nea was using urban evasion and she's running then it's a good guess that the killer is behind her 
---
Or an add-on that makes survivors kill themselves on the explosion when they miss a skill check. So killer will just need to sit and relax.
---
Must of

---
that's how mafia work
---
The killer is camping because HE KNOWS YOU ARE THERE! Go do Gens the guy on the hook is raging right about known think. 
---
I find that if 2 of your teammates are doing a gen its best to try and save they normally leave when a gen gets done.
---
Finally, someone posted a picture where I can say "I killed that guy"
---
Hide behind a gen
---
This happened to me as well. I wouldn't let me get into the game until the next day
---
Huh, I did not know that. 
---
Never really used the fog offerings to begin with, but hey: knowledge is power.
---
1-yes, 2- depends on the rank.. like 35 yards or something, 3- new perk "distortion" is alright against it. 
---
If the killer dashboard leaves u get nothing
---
Doesn't really work anymore
---
No joke, I love getting moried. It's such a satisfying way to die 
---
Thanks for the feedback. I made the background stuff in a wave generator in FL studio. I kinda wanted it to be grating and uncomfortable. The background ambience was inspired by the times I’ve spend in industrial confined spaces.
---
Why not? Has it been changed?
---
I always liked just running in one direction for four seconds (the duration of the BBQ aura) and then turning round to go the other way.  Doesn't often work against BBQ Billy though, because he can get to you too fast.
---
Yes, same patch as the bbq locker interaction. 
---
does hiding in lockers work? i know the hide your aura now
---
You’re pretty bad...
---
Fun fact, throwing the pallet extends your hitbox. If you didnt throw the pallet, the pig would have swung through and missed.
---
For your Freddy example, that doesn't work since after you down them, they can just get healed back up in 8-10 seconds (unless you use Coulrophobia and other healing debuff perks
---
Hahahahaha!!
---
Nono, the killer was a fresh nurse 
---
Survivors are supposed to be scared and concerned about their life (in the game),where's muh immersion?!
---
really, who cares about the reveal part, while it's strong there are better perks than that, but no other perk gives you 100% extra BP after game 
---
Hook and tunnel strategy. Nice
---
Needs an extra Brown for maximum fogness
---
If they Click leave game you get 5000 for escapeing, if they close application or turn off their net it doesn't give you anything
---
Use perks, don't get killed
---
because he was the worst part of the first saw film
---
I love this show
---
it was all i could look at
---
If he hit you he might have gotten you.
---
You're right. However, I never said to replace it, but instead has some background noise or slight modifications that come from the killer.
---
Lol you really are salty, I don't tunnel - that you'll have to take my word for. I find that spirit can just zip around like lightning and down anyone. Not my fault if survivors can't escape.
---
**The objective is to kill, not to be kind.**
---
That's why it's called Dead by Daylight, not Farm Simulator.
---
I second this. I'm all to give more info to solo survivors to close the gap with swf.
---
Hmm weird
---
Look who's talking! 😂😂 If you're this salty on Reddit over a pixel game then you must be totally shit at it.
---
Top tip, if you see a Spirit in a kimono with white face paint bearing down on you, you'd better DC quick. 😉🔪
---
Like you don’t even need to be good at looping either to juke legion. Just one pallet and most will use frenzy and you can get away/distance 
---
lol ok downvote people with different opinions. adult/10
---
Jesus resurrecting from his tomb and asserting dominance over the Romans (35 AC, colourised) 
---
One thing I like is that I almost always let the last survivor get hatch and every single time I get a message saying thanks. 
---
It's the little things :D
---
It takes 7 seconds to sleep you, and unless he's running pill bottle you can see him while you transition. Use this time to run to a window or pallet and drop it as you enter the DW. Freddy has nothing he can use to chase you now and you can loop him like any other killer.
---
Well, dont quote me on that but Im preeeety sure yea
---
Maybe stop arguing and say what literally everyone else is saying: Killer's perks in the endgame screen remain hidden for SWF until everyone else is dead or escaped.
---
its completely utterly miles deep in the grave. Game died in 3 days
---
MICHEAL!
---
Yeah i know what you were going for, your good 😀
---
&gt;I'm tired of not knowing what other survs are doing,
---
That's the point of the game, to feel alone and helpless.
---
&gt;and being practically forced to rely on perks like empathy or kindred just to be able to know what other survs are doing,
---
You... have to be joking right?
---
&gt;This is coming from a killer main
---
Funny the rest of your post dosent imply that at all.
---
It does. The aura is now a different color, so if your arm sticks out behind the gen, they are gonna see. But if youre completely behind the gen it still hides your aura.
---
It does still work. The aura is now a different color, so if your arm sticks out behind the gen, they are gonna see. But if youre completely behind the gen it still hides your aura.
---
it's a bug. you only get co-op action when healing someone with a teammate. 
---
Maybe they were too busy dying trying to gen whilst you wasted your time opening chests 😅🤣
---
Weaker than your killer game?
---
See you already know. 
---
Yes.
---
Lol are you lonely today?
---
it's a good idea, was thinking it myself. 
---
originally and even in remake, Fred was able to bend the Dream realm. it's so unfair the Doctor can but not Freddy. 
---
I've tried running that combo repeatedly; it's rare I escape with the stuff I get or I get a torch, only for the person I give it to basically commits suicide due to them trying (and failing) to pull off torch saves.  Or worse, my teammates all have items and the killer is triggered enough to bring Franklin's.  I get it, I do.  Lobby full of boxes or torches is intimidating but I had a medkit from a chest! ;w;
---
That's fucking stupid, but then again it's dbd, what did I expect
---
Plopers!
---
it is stupid. ditch this daily till they fix it.
---
Lmfao the downvotes, guess people can’t take a joke.
---
We have one hint for them, which is they’ll be a killer from the furthest point back in time we’ve had so far. 
---
We can work on it! It's never anything worth getting upset over and British players can't help but be sarcastic 24/7
---
There's been plenty of times in rocket league where another player just thinks I'm stupid while I'm giggling myself an early grave. 
---
You mean that the doctor is a direct copy of this Hellraiser action figure* 
---
Im honestly so tired of these hits, they happen so fucking often. I would ALMOST prefer pallet vacuums come back then have this shit.
---
When did the pig get a growth spurt? 
---
Jk, Love the work!
---
That hurts to watch
---
But Survivors will whine about literally everything lmao
---
thank you Rank1Killer, very cool!
---
It's strange to balance. Without SWF the game would lose players, but you need to either balance around SWF or solo queue. They need to buff solo queue a little and nerf SWF a little.
---
For example this change + hiding killer perks until an entire SWF lobby is dead.
---
Yep, this can prob be done once we move to dedicated servers. 
---
Doctor doctor give me the news
---
Dwight with Prove thyself, leader, bond and resilience. Ultimate gen jockey.
---
Add-on-less: She can see scratches so you could walk but that doesn't work too well and she has a mini-windstorm lunge at the end of phasing. You can also not hear the sound of her phasing if you're in her terror radius.  
---
Prayer Beads: Most BS add-on a spirit can use. This add-on makes it so you can't hear the passive phasing sound. Ever.  
---
Lunge + Tuning Guide: Her best combo, the *Yakuyoke Amulet* and the *Wakizashi Saya*, makes her lunge longer than (old) green windstorm and maybe even longer than purple while the Amulet acts like a Tuning Guide, enhancing all of her abilities.
---
“This technique has been passed down through generations of trappers, it’s over...”  
---
*gets past*  
---
“Impossible! I calculated his every move!”
---
The attack button?
---
Hol up
---
Why
---
I mean if you can loop the killer for a total of 5 gens, you are not the type op suggests :)
---
Your terror radius goes away for a few seconds when a gen is at 85%
---
What is Hellraiser?
---
Yo this is exciting af then!!!! Going to have some fun times trolling the killer lol.
---
You gotta be a strong Dwighty. Try not to be tempted by lockers and also try not to cry. ;-;
---
You go FULL invisible (like NO WAY survivors can spot you) or smth like Wraith's cloak with insidious?
---
I really hope we get another licensed killer. Ghostface from scream, candyman or Pennywise would be great movie killers.
---
Maybe we will eventually get some video game bad guys, that would be pretty neat. Like the fat guy from Outlast lol
---
But decisive strike though. Fuck survivors.  /s. 
---
I’ve also had this daily for the past 2 weeks LOL didn’t know it was bugged till now. Way to go DBD!!!
---
I understood that reference.
---
You are good. It is a sign to ask people to rescue you. 
---
Yeah but it’s just annoying and I could see him gaining pleasure from it so fuck him 
---
Plays hello zepp in the background
---
Hey, you can only do gens and then escape, no unhooking, right? I can't know if you will enjoy this kind of gameplay a lot, but I think most people wouldn't
---
Ok, let's talk about basement. It's most dangerous and horrific place of every map allright, you don't want to be caught and downed near it - thats why it has so much lockers and ways to escape from killer upstairs (god pallets, windows etc) and also why it always contain a chest - it's a place of risk. It's a good idea for a game about risk, only I wish that stairs would be a bit wider. 
---
Now, lets talk about facecamping. 
---
Perks that support camping. You say there are so many of them, but how many? I can recall only two (Insidious and Monstrous shrine), which are often considered crap by many people, and they were created far before perks that support active gameplay and leaving hooks as contrary to camping (Hex: Devour Hope, Make your choice, BBQ, Pop goes the weasel). Also there are more of the latter then the former. Why perks, that support camping exist? Man, the same reason as why Freddy and Legion are crap. Bad balancing happens. 
---
I've talked what I think about facecamping before, so I won't repeat myseft, only say that basement unhooking is dangerous always, killer can return while you are running up the ladder. But if the killer wasn't facecamping and isn't tunneling, it's actually only risk for unhooker and not additionally punishment for playing at all for hooked person. 
---
The thing is a good killer won't chase the same person for 3 gens if they can't catch the victim, they just waste precious time this way. And yeah, when tunneling occurs, it's just genrushing for everybody other than chased person, and yes, it's boring. But at least no one gets just removed from gameplay in a very degrading manner.
---
If you don't want to play cheesy way, just don't tunnel and don't facecamp at least, other things will come. Jeez, if you actually wanna play somewhat fair, you will figure out yourself perfectly. But why are you even asking me about what playstyle you should not be using if you don't care? I'm not a developer to enforce this on you anyway
---
I want to see more silly/fun matches tbh they always make me smile.
---
For everyone. No one should know what perks killer has till everything is over. I don't know why the devs thought it would be a good idea.
---
Tombstone Piece &gt; Tombstone
---
Nah. I come across killers who use BBQ and chilli and face camp. They must be freaking smart. 
---
At first i thought it was just a resemblance because of the face, then i saw the name... COULD YOU BE ANY MORE OBVIOUS CMON
---
Shit. I didn't know about the terror radius. 
---
Facamping is toxic. Patroling the vicinity of hooks isn't. There is a huge difference
---
I mean I can say it's annoying to go against a face camp but at least you are somewhat justified, I think it's up to you in that situation to know whether it's right or wrong, also on average expect about 1-2 hooks on average a game with legion it's more about maxing hunting, deviousness and brutality and the sacrifice is a bonus 
---
I don't get it, how did that survivor hit you?
---
1 brown toolbox is essentially half a gen worth of time with like, any speed addon 
---
idk. Maybe? I don't remember honestly
---
Mikey cosplays/costumes are always odd looking since we can see the wearers eyes tbh since of how we see him in media 
---
Dead By Daylight OwO
---
Me 2
---
According to the wiki murky is +100%, hazy +50%, faint +25% and clear -50%
---
Need to try this now. I used him as Aura reader. Empathy, bond, after care. Never needed self care. 
---
why did you type after zur Killer dc'ed xD
---
Dead hard is OP. The number of times you are very close to a vault but can't make it is annoying. 
---
I stream around rank 15 because I'm genuinely not good enough to rank up.
---
If you press it, you do a quick attack, a swipe, if you hold it down, you move forward a good meter or so, I had never held it down.
---
He dropped me out. Apparently he needed one more person for a “trap people” daily and nobody was stepping in his traps, so he was super happy
---
Lockers hide aura for everyone, killers and survivors alike. You can still see people going in or our of lockers, but as soon as they are inside, the locker will block all aura reading (BBQ, Bond, Empathy, Scratched Mirror etc.)
---
Unfortunately I would want a match history for that to be true. I wanna see how my game breakdown was right away, I could care less about killer perks but I don't wanna have to sit through the rest of the game just to see my point breakdown and stuff
---
Yeah, those solo q survivors checking the perks after they died, sending friend requests to their mates and telling them the perks is a real problem that we cant wait with... -_-
---
This doesn’t work if the survivors are decent at all because auto aim seems to prefer the awake survivors over the asleep survivors meaning it’s really hard to hit one asleep person
---
To be fair, some killers have actually said stuff like that, so it's not just survivors making up rules.
---
Thanks for the cool information
---
Or hide for everyone until the game ends.
---
Nah what you did is a pretty fair basically patrolling 3 hooks if you think about it, I’ve done it before and it’s not face camping 
---
Definitely screaming mad :|
---
I mean if you were just standing in front of 1 guy then that’s face camping and literally no one benefits from that you’d be wasting your time and wasting that survivors time, but what you did was perfectly fine 
---
Can a doctor even be sweaty? Wouldn't all sweaty players play Nurse, Spirit and Hillbilly? 
---
Whatever
---
This is probably the best video I’ve ever seen on this sub
---
Pharmacist+Ace in the Hole is fun too, just swap self care for pharmacist.
---
Yeah everyone gets the same shrine, you should also be able to use them in a private match no matter if you own them or not
---
Let the survivor live, now that’s a shitty idea, work a gen and move on 
---
What’s wrong with self-sacrifice
---
Who makes up the majority of people who make up rules? 
---
Well what you know, IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS THE SURVIVORS THAT MAKE UP THESE RULES.
---
Wait till you get even higher rank when your teammates start farming you on the hook. The real challenge is not the killer, its all the asshole survivors. 
---
I know I misspoke haha
---
 0118 999 881 999 119 725…3″
---
They do, trust me I’ve made the mistake of maiming Freddy 
---
Well, so you agree that killers do it too, then? Because that was kind of my point..
---
Well I don’t think that is much of a problem on ps4 since it takes time to write the message and send a friend request, add the fact that the person playing need to pause the game to accept the friend request, I think it’s only a problem when they are playing on voicechat 
---
There is a difference between making up rules and calling something out as a dick move. Camp, tunnel or use moris it is all a part of the game. But it is still a dick move to use certain strategies.
---
So the killer should lose their gatekeeper points so it can reward a survivor who was playing sub par. This thread is full of survivor mains not thinking about the scoring system for a killer. I’ve made arguments for both sides, yet every person who replies tells me I’m wrong and that the survivor deserves a hatch by playing mediocre. I hope it never changes, I sit on the hatch for hours just in hopes that I’m inconveniencing all of you
---
I think this post is very accurate, the game on consol is their second priorety and as the game is buggy on pc too, I think you guys will have to suffer for a long time. You guys don't have Billy, so no overtime no unbreakable(forgot his third one), many techniques are hard to perform with a controller,  I could go on and on so I'm just gonna end with "witch to pc if you can"
---
It's fast if you use the ps app. 
---
*activates dead hard emerald*
---
Enter a game, dc, wait in lobby, repeat. You are welcome.
---
Thank you man, yes i did the unbreakble video :)
---
&gt; fix console fps
---
You do realise you are playing a decent graphical game on a chunk of metal right?
---
I got the game and played a lot of ace, and I say had him at level 25 in my first night playing. The day after I logged on it was all gone, luckily I must’ve played David king in a free trial and not ace because when I installed the chapter for huntress I had a level 17 David 
---
Well but not everyone has the ps app, and also you should need to have the phone near you and always access to the app when you are playing, I think it’s too much bothersome to do that for a stranger
---
Plunderers and Ace in the hole should be an area buff like Leader  
---
Change my mind
---
They are still working on the new matchmaking process, which should come before Dedicated Servers. They were doing a backdoor test (or whatever it's called) of it on us already last month, but it still had some bugs to work out. In this new model, survivors will be matched up in cyberspace before being placed into a lobby. This means all survivors will enter at the same time regardless of whether they are together. Killers will no longer be able to tell who is together and who is solo. 
---
This is all provided that the new matchmaking model stays virtually the same as they previously discussed. 
---
That said, I play on Xbox. Queues have been fine for months, but for some reason are particularly painful this week. Probably because everyone is tired from the holidays, back at school/work, "hungover" from the bloodpoint event, etc. 
---
Well... you wanted to be chased out instead of leaving on your own...
---
*Activates unrelenting chaos emerald*
---
Survivors can now hit the killer. New buff for them
---
I do agree but I don’t think anything will change. Though killer disconnecting has became ridiculous these past few days
---
Do they explain it in the tutorial? It's been a while since I did it. Like...since it was put into the game with Curtain Call. I already knew how to play by then, but just sped through it for the free BP. 
---
I remember the first few matches I played as killer, I didn't know about the lunge, either. That was like a year ago though, before the tutorial. 
---

That’s an Iridicent Hatchet. 
---
That could mean Jeepers Creepers. 
---
Are you playing immersed?
---
They have shown interest in getting Springtrap. 
---
Like I said, I’m nooby. Please define immersed
---
Most people (in my experience) has the message setting on friends only so you need to sent a friend request if you wanna add them to a group
---
If you want the achievement/trophy for Kobe’ing, it’s almost necessary. But I don’t typically run it otherwise. 
---
It sounds like a good perk if you’re a team player 
---
It can be, but if you’re the first person hooked, it’s useless for the rest of the match. A bit situational in some ways. 
---
Making up dumb rules to make your own life easier is a dick move.
---
Immersed means staying hidden, doing everything in your power to not get spotted, etc. Basically like you’re immersed in an actual horror movie and not running around with your dick out lol
---
Awesome idea. Even just to see more perks in action.
---
Could even add to it a little by classifying perks into groups to make it easier to choose from. 
---
Survivor queues seem to be having issues on PS4 at the moment. I get a lobby almost instantly as killer but I’m solo survivor and it takes a while to find a game. 
---
I’ve started taking these and it’s amazing. Too bad your teammates take every chest
---
Is no one going to link that photo of Peyton Manning with the face mask?
---
Oh neat. I wish I could get one lol
---
PS4 Rank 4. my friends ranks are lower than me this season (10-11) but we always had long wait times even when our ranks were closer together. minus the odd 1-2 nights where we had O.K queues.  
---
It's not rare that we wait 30-50 minutes before we even get a lobby.
---
THIS
---
Dude, come on. Are you saying that as a player, you are happy if you are going against a killer who puts you on a hook and stands directly in front of you? I am not saying they shouldn't be allowed to do it, just that it is rude to do. It is a dick move. Being a dick move does not proclude it from being a legitimate strategy, but it remains a dick move.
---
Absolutely unacceptable 
---
Too situational. If you're the first hook, is useless. If you can't get the safe unhook notification it doesn't trigger. And ideally you wouldn't get hooked unless you're Jeff.
---
yeah as a killer I get almost instant pops too.
---
We still have bill perks on console. And dbd is not hard to play with a controller.
---
Gun Media lost the license, it got revoked because of how shitty their game was so it's basically just up to Warner
---
Reality is often disappointing
---
Swap Dead Hard to Sprint Burst and I’m in complete agreement.
---
I needed this lol great use of great movie 
---
Basement Leatherface camping is uncommon dude
---
Tx for sweet 1800 bp
---
Y’better watch out for his traps~
---
If I lost my progress, after 800 hours, I'd completely lose my shit.
---
isn’t*
---
To be fair, I've never really been into horror movies; the inability to do anything as opposed to horror games, along with the fact that it's the same thing over and over again (as are all movies) mean I don't usually pay attention to them.
---
That’s why I said “in some ways,” because it may not pan out the way you want. Whereas the OP’s other perks are pretty consistently useful (Spine Chill, Self Care, Botany, Dark Sense.) It’s just a matter of personal preference as to whether you want to take a chance on having use for a perk. 
---
I’m the kind of person who would rather run things that I know I can use, and can use more than once. For instance, I usually always have Iron Will on every build. Maybe I won’t get injured the whole game, but if we’re being honest, that’s pretty unlikely for me. So it’s always useful to me in every match. 
---
You mean common...?
---
My first recommendation would be to stop playing completely immersed and try to learn how to lead chases around.  
---
If you're an altruistic type, Deliverance is definitely worth running but not on this type of build. This build pretty much screams out "I'm a new player".  
---
As for perks I'd recommend for immersed players, Sprint Burst, Self Care, Decisive Strike, Urban Evasion and Iron Will are just a couple. Spine Chill and Dark Sense are kind of useless.  
---
If you'd like actually good perks to run almost always I'd recommend Balanced Landing/Dead Hard, Adrenaline, We're Gonna Live Forever(for bloodpoints) and any other fourth perk you find fun. We're Gonna Live Forever could be switched for whatever you want too.
---

---
I think it’s worth trying. You can try all perks in KYF to decide which ones you like before buying them (whether you buy the DLC with money, shards, or grab the perk from the Shrine.)
---
Dead Hard at least requires some situational awareness to make use of effectively. SB is just like "oh, I got caught out of place by a killer, let me just have no repercussions for that whatsoever."
---
The reason queus are horrendous in red ranks is because there are less players there. It isn't especially hard to rank up to red ranks, but it does take a lot of games to do it, enough that only people willing to  put substantial efort in will get there. Red ranks are also the palce where people are more likely to stick to the raw meta stuff. The perks and addons that are 'the best' so you don't see much variation. Finally, people in red ranks are more likely to be taking the game seriously, and so more likely ot be toxic if the game isn't going their way. For all these reasons, most players, including the best players prefer to be playing in the green and purple ranks. It just makes for more enjoyable games where players still know what theya re doing, but are not taking the game so seriously as to be abusive if they lose. There are more players in these ranks simply becase t takes less time to get there so you also get lower wait times. It is just all around better to play further up than red ranks.
---
How? Survivors all run pretty much the same perks anyway and most games we play against SWF who already know what perks are being used and have roles planned out 
---
Lol nightmare, thanks
---
Plunderers Instinct, Ace in the hole and Phamrcy for faster chest searching but i mostly take Self Care instead and an exhaustion perk. 
---
Maybe one of your friends has an earlier version of the game
---
Get a PC, that'll help idk about the game, but life quality over all.
---
&gt; Why downvote this?
---
+23
---
Yep!
---
It's a really popular series, the first film is based on a book. Google it if you want to know about the plot and all that
---
Probably one of the fallen legions. 
---
Like, this build has no point, you run it for no reason except to piss people off. 
---
It's okay, it took me 9 games of playing survivor before I realised there is a sound effect before the skill check goes off. Sometimes it is easy to miss obvious stuff if you aren't looking for it.
---
I had a lovely post game Dwight who I had killed a Bill right in front of him who told me how it was his first time seeing a mori and sacared the shit out of him and that's why he just hid all match. It was kinda adorable.
---
...Why do you think hiding killer perks means you can’t see your point breakdown?
---
Well then! TIL. It bugged me for weeks until I made the connection this morning. Thanks for the info!
---
Well im pretty sure its me since i cant find any games as both survivor and killer. While he can🤔
---
I have just been lucky then ;/
---
I think it would also help if the devs would balance some other killers so that people didn’t feel like they can only play Nurse or Billy at rank one. Make killers like Trapper, Pig and Wraith more viable and you’ll hopefully get fewer people deranking on both sides because it adds variety.
---
Now I see why it took so long
---
Weird. What version of the game are you running?
---
Add Freddy
---
Love how the Hag is basically a meat pillar lmao
---
If reinstalling doesn't work, feel free to send a ss.
---
It's really not hard. I've messaged someone where hatch is quite a few times.
---
Thx for the advice
---
I just didnt add s
---
K?
---
I don't know, Deah Hard seems to have like a full 2 second window to activate and dodge. It's so easy to time and ignores latency.
---
oh no two downvotes wow
---
Other people on resdit say that
---
PewDiePie fans here ?
---
So many people forget this. It's survivors' job to give the killer an incentive to leave the hook, if there's no auras shown, ofc they'll check the area.
---
Brunette Kate is best Kate &lt;3
---
Haha, that was actually brilliant. A good joke without constant unneeded sounds to drive it across! Well done. 
---
I too think survivors are a little on the strong side, but this really is a good idea. Also, if they just remove the posibility to check the killer perks before the end of the match, then that would both nerf the SWF a little and buff the solo players a little, bringing them closer together. I think this is an overall great idea. Gives more concistency in what survivors you play against know about the killer and their fellow survivors
---
Dont look
---
They have stated already that this killer will be from the oldest time period out of all current killers. I think ... Huntress is from World War 1. So. Some time period before then.
---
why is this marked as shitpost? it's a serious topic
---
Yeah, trapper is Jason and hillbilly is leather face. I  forgot what the wraith was based on.
---
Should get some bloodpoints for that one

The problem is that solo players could still send the survivors that are still in the match a message with the killer perks, but I don't thinj this would be all that big of a problem
---
You don't have to play a character for their perks? I play Quentin and I don't use any of his perks, what is that logic.
---
Nearly gave me an anuerism with that, crikey
---
Yes. This is 100% the most frustrating part about the game as a survivor. Spirit is the worst. 
---
As if :D
---
That thing he does with his mouth when he is injured looks funny not sure if its because i have iron will or not
---
But the Killer is a Legion
---
Contact support right away they'll refund the lost progress in BP.
---
Exactly, so I just take the aura reading like a man
---
CAMPER! NOOB! SCREEEE
---
Once had a game with billy and they had 2 people so I went easy. Just chased them easy like snipes from across the map one loop type chases let them unhook. Once I got 2 hooks I just zipped around the map away from them trying to launch myself off of buildings so they can do gens. And yeah.. teabagged me at exit gates and whole gg ez shit at the end. Like..... dude I could have killed yall both in under 3mins how can you not see mercy???? Lol now I make sure they know im in charge.
---
It's still not fun :c
---
Hopefully when they say "fixed Survivors spawning next to totems and totems spawning next to Gens" they actually mean it this time. Remember when the big pallet/hook patch was supposed to increase the distance between pallets and hooks and did absolutely and (IMHO) may have made the problem worse in some maps? 
---
I swear that ever since that patch, Coal Tower almost always has two pallets right next to each other in front of the tower. 
---
Overcharge and 3 gen doc so hard to beat haha
---
It was Bloodhunt my man, all the assholes come out of their caves. Also, if you find a camper just gen rush his ass. If he starts getting 1 or 0k he may rethink his shit strategy.
---
I think semicampers are worse because you never know.
---
I do love snipe doc too. Its super fun to play
---
90% of games facecamped? Lol ok you're either over exaggerating this greatly, you play at low ranks where it's common, or you're getting face camped at the end. I'm going to assume you're over exaggerating because you just stated there's no in between of either  good games or bad games because it certainly is always in between, you can have a good game or a bad game or a game where a douche killer facecamps you right at the start. There is no 90% facecamping foh with that bud. And with facecamping you always lose plenty of bp as you should and you usually depip as you should. Stop complaining about something that certainly doesn't happen "90%" of the time unless you are in low ranks which is something noob killers do.
---
Nah man, I love Dead Hard. When I only played killer it annoyed me, but now I'm genuinely impressed whenever somebody pulls off a really good Dead Hard.
---
Superb billy snipe
---
He: Haunted Grounds with Hex: Ruin. Tell me a better couple. Go on, I'll wait.
---
No no no. You are doing it wrong. Bring ace in the hole for next level plunder.

---
What Ive seen is people abuse match making. Like a swf with two rank 17 to 15 than a rank 6-1s. They end to be the most likly to be toxic when they win/lose or just dc.
---
They already have taken steps to address it. They take BP away from you and make it harder to rank off of games you stay too close to a hooked survivor. The problem with face campers is they dont care about any of that, because face camping is a bad strat to begin with. There's just no way to force a player to not make a bad decision. 
---
The fabled all-woman legion that was scrapped when they went over budget on Gucci made power armor.
---
Dead hard being included 
---
Specially Full Totem Snipe Doc. Ruin, Devour Hope, Thrill of the Hunt and Haunted Grounds. You don't even have to move if someone touches your totem, just snipe his ass through the whole map.
---
Yaaaaaaaas bich
---
I'd be so salty 
---

---
Iron Maiden won't affect the dwight because it only activates if they come out of the locker
---
Pretty much. The specific reason I don't run AiTH + PI (and just AiTH by itself) is because I've found a lot more Purple Medkits and Green Toolboxes with just Ace's over Ace's and Plunderer's. Plunderer's is only really good to find chests tbh and after running Ace in the Hole without Plunderer's for awhile I memorized most of the chest spawn locations. (And yet I refuse to do the same with Small Game and Totems lol) 
---
"Do eet" while they break my haunted ground
---
Mikey need to pull his mask down a bit I think.
---
I have noticed the grunts of pain are either barely hearable or completely gone
---
Once went against 4 insta heals, 4 ss, dh, sb. Was terrible. I managed to get 2 by the very end of it though, just started off really rocky.
---
Ive never used it myself, but the number of times someone has used it effectively against me as killer, which is maybe twice, leads me to believe its not worth the slot
---
Here is how to counter it: don't come out of the locker. Once in the locker, always in the locker untill the killer pulls you out
---
I think most killer hits through pallets are fair but the porkster oink wasn’t even halfway through her swing when she hit u through pallet here. Tuff L
---
Actually if killer camps i then try and get him to chase or i get the person off the hook and take the hit.
---
Exactly. It's difficult to use well and adds an extra element to chases.
---
Amazing work!
---
Okay, wHAT
---
Umm what lol? Yeah definite over exaggeration because you can't see if the killer ranks up or not because it doesn't show you their rank until the end of the game and it certainly doesn't show you whether they pipped or not. So please lmk how you know they are ranking up???
---
Need it.
---
&gt;You’re honor
---
You're means you are fyi :)
---
To be fair that only applies to having perks unlocked. I was stuck playing Meg Thomas for a while because I wanted her perks on other characters and I figured I'd better play her since I'm getting all these bonus bloodpoint offerings.
---
Working on Claudette right now, though I think I'd probably play as Kate when all is said and done.
---
Not even mad cuz of the party streamer
---
As long as you didn't deny that killers nowadays don't require any skill to play that's fine by me
---
Its good against Nurse, Huntress and Legion. Every other killer can easily counterplay Dead Hard and make the entire perk useless. Except for the hard to force situation where you just need a little more to reach the pallet. The only reason Dead hard is viable is bad killers exist.
---
Do you listen to this when the Killer finds you?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOQ4pkUAFbA
---
I understand What you mean. But in other game people would just make a smurf acc to do the same thing. (See league of legend , overwatch and other....).
---
People will find the way to play game with easier opponents.
---
Denied. Now what? 
---
Hag and Amanda are both bitches to play against when there is fog.
---
I'm not even mad when I get Dead Harded. I'm impressed, honestly.
---
&gt;overtime
---
I let a Claudette survive a match because I repeatedly downed/hooked her in the basement while proximity camping it with billy to get a chainsaw ritual. Still ended up getting teabagged by her and her swf at the exit anyway :)
---
I was so confused for a good minute why I couldn't pick up the toolbox when I first started :(
---
I know that. Siri is an idiot though
---
I mean, not really hard after the double BP weekend. What's the deal of these salty comments they leave you
---
On some nights yes, about 90%. Happens in both green ranks and red ranks.
---
I wouldnt complain about camping at the end, or a strategic camp. I mean killers who just sit near their first hook, then if someone rescues with BT and they get the rescuer down they camp them instead.
---
Plenty of people have mentiomed facecmaping in red ranks so.....you'd know if you were a noob yourself. Fuck off with that toxic attitude.
---
They always say that when the die to noed. Or if they die to an ebony mori, they say its dumb to use those. It always cracks me up, just reply, boohoo
---
I’d say that it’s definitely better than dark sense at least 
---
&gt; clear is brown but the equivalent to the hazy which is yellow
---
.... Yeah?
---
Doesn't change the fact that for $20 I can go watch a movie for two hours or buy something like Darkest Dungeon and get a lot more bang for my buck.
---
I think they’re UK Police constables actually, most of my friends are cops as I’m on a policing course in the UK.
---
They mist not have seen it 
---
This was my first thought when I read their post too. People who face camp clearly dont care about BP, rank, or winning because camping is a bad strat for all of those. All that would do is make the poor soul suffer longer.
---
They are UK police.
---
They’re UK police.
---
Seems like this happens every other game it's so dumb.
---
I remember my first mori, it was on the nurse and felt so good... Being able to Mori a survivor is still my favorite thing to do, getting that satisfying animation. Especially with the newer killers. The only thing I like about Legion is their mori animation
---
No need to be attentive when you have a perk like that. I love Sprint Bursting away at the last second on a gen lol. 
---
None so far. Most bugs I come across are just annoying
---
There is a perk for that
---
How do you moonwalk as Myers?
---
Yeah it's pretty rare, especially iridescent head huntress. I've seen 1 in the last month. It's usually the same boring shit... Hill billy with ruin and barbeque.
---
I like going against Michael, hate going against Freddy.
---
Michael is a stealth character done right. He's actually fun to face, because you're always looking over your shoulder and that is justified. You have to make sure he's not watching you and with good reason.
---
Freddy is a stealth character done wrong. You cannot tell if you evaded him. No observational power will reward you nor can you see him coming. 
---
Plus once you're in the dream world you're basically fucked, especially if there aren't any gens left to skillcheck with.
---
He's not fun to play as, not fun to play against
---
I hate (hate hate hate) playing against Freddy.
---
I know he's bottom tier. I know he's not good. But god damn do I hate playing against him; the fact that you can't see him until he's already right on top of you, and that your character's neck almost snaps in half when he's next to you just pisses me the fuck off.
---
It's irrational, to be honest.

---
I think Stake Out's fine.
---
Also you forgot to mention that there are perks and addons that let you kill the survivors 
---
[[Deliverance]]
---
Well, why not?
---
The thing is, if you kill them off on the hook you put yourself at another disadvantage. At least when they're pointing out other survivors the killer has another extra survivor to deal with but if you kill them it becomes a 3v1
---
His hopes too. Broken hopes of escaping.
---
Except noed and dead hard are easy to deal with
---
I don't think it is currently possible right now. The developers seem to be struggling to get the game to work at a (don't hate me for this) suitable FPS of 30 (we all know 60 is the minimum in 2019).
---
That would be cool if Behavior treated their ports better. Ps4's qeue times are way too long.
---
Sometimes they're just really pressed and can't be bothered waiting for the animation to finish so they just DC. 
---
Survivor pudding is 100% bp increase and yellow while wreaths only give a bit extra in one category but I ain’t complaining 
---
Don't run it with ruin.
---
He got out via Hatch
---
Stubbornness and retardedness can sometimes be the perfect combination 
---
I’m honestly so surprised they haven’t been sued hahaha. 
---
I derank on survivor because I don't want to face billy/nurse every game.
---
I derank on killer because I don't want to wait 25 minutes for a game.
---
This is the equivalent of LeBron James playing against 4 disabled 6 year olds,
---
Damn didn’t realize I was speaking to an author, quite the novel. First off I’m not your “bruh”, I hardly see how I’ve played myself. I’m rank one survivor every season since this game come out, I can’t say the same about killer.  It’s extremely agitating to be told the killer is wrong for trying to give an easy way out to the person they are supposed to kill. I love how a killer can be told they have to put their objective aside when a survivor who gets to escape for doing exactly that. Am I salty? Am i going to just give the hatch away? No. Am I entitled to block the hatch? Maybe I’m not, just like no survivor is entitled to the hatch. You all need to get over yourselves, and that includes me. This comity is garbage. 
---
Deadhard isnt as strong as it used to before the stupid animation that makes it a dead giveaway
---
If money vs time of enjoyment is your issue, you’ve got it wrong, man. 
---
$20 is really excessive, I only spend that on maybe a brand new remastered 4k re-release or something. In 2019, the classics are pretty much public domain online or are a few bucks at thrift stores. Indie’s are also free or ridiculously cheap. The internet is your friend. Almost everything can be found online. The narratives spun by video games can be exciting to have a hand in, but it can be equally thrilling to have no control, especially in horror - that edge-of-your-seat “oh god please don’t open that door” feeling. 
---
There’s slasher, psychological, paranormal, thriller, splatterstick, giallo, grindhouse, and so much more. There truly is something for everyone, all it takes is a little digging. If you love DBD, try starting with one of the intellectual property killers’ movies. I guarantee you they are all online for free. The first time I watched The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (‘73) was on Youtube actually, and it changed my life. Never has a piece of art made me feel so isolated and disturbed. 
---
Films and games are really two sides of the same coin - forms of storytelling. If you can appreciate art at an immersive value, one that removes you from reality and places you in a crafted world - why limit yourself? 
---
Imagine the shock on thay players face when Claudette got fucked. I'm surprised she didn't know there was a trap there considering it's the most common trap placement.
---
That’s so true 
---
Aye, that's good old "Battle Bong". When I play that build I ring my bell even when Im not chasing someone. That way when survs get used to hearing the bell all the time they let their guard down when I am actually behind them.
---
relatable
---
I'm ready for DBD on Switch.
---
More how the mask sits
---
Freddy is just annoying. even if he's not strong, he's just annoying to face.
---
They’re just talking about the reagent offerings 
---
Looks like Amanda is sharing her heroin with Wraith. 
---
They did it! They defeated the basement defender in his own realm 
---
Nah, they weren't always there. I've been playing for 2 years now. 
---
I know the feeling. But I counter that by playing stealthy and being altruistic my self. Usually they feel the need to pay back. Ad the better ranks u get, the better players you get also the more altruistic players u get
---
One of the few times the level 1 crook will beat the level 35 boss
---
Behavior better put that cosmetic in the game while of course giving credit where credit is due. Very well done! 
---
Right? But I feel like time and time again survivors panic in that situation and forget the little things, funny part is I got three bites with that exact spot lol 
---
This needs to be shouted from the rooftops. Dedicated Servers will only do so much, hitboxes need to be looked at.
---
I know and probably the reason for that is that there is only 1 killer vs 4 survivors and usually only the killer is clearing the mist, which means their version would have to have more weight than the survivors.
---
I like going against Clown the most, I usually come away feeling like it was a fun game even if I died. I like the laugh also. 
---
Least favorite would be Wraith, since he’s the king of camp on PS4
---
I was wondering why it was taking so long. I was halfway through it after days and trashed it. Trashed it a second time today. Good thing I did.
---
Send a message to the other survivors, I was lucky enough to have friends on at the time
---
On Xbox you just click their name and send the message. It's super easy. I've definitely sent messages saying "NOED" in under 10 seconds before after I've died. 
---
I feel like I'm wasting my time here, but are you a software engineer? Because I am, and if you truly have questions about why this isn't a fair comparison, I can help with those. But if it's truly a shitpost I'll save my breath
---
These guys were relying on their perks and items way too much, destroyed them while there were still 3 gens left. Got me a sweet 100k points(31k base points + bonuses) and 2 of them DCed. Just goes to show crutches can't save your ass 7/24 if you don't try to actually get better.
---
Yes the up and down of solo vs swf. Solo cues have there perks hidden. I agree. 
---
Yeah but PUBG isn't nearly as fun as DBD
---
Amazing... every word of what you just said was wrong.
---
First of all, the hit boxes on hatchets arent a rectangle they are a sphere attached to the end of the hatchet. This was explained by a dev during one of their streams.
---
Secondly, if this player really was on a "zero lag server" and the hit boxes really were as large as he is trying to make them out to be Huntress would be the easiest killer to play ever.
---
What you are seeing is a latency issue between the host (the killer) sending information and the player receiving it. On the killers side this probably looked correct. 
---
What does ss stand for?
---
Two totally different games but ok
---
Is this the DBD olympics logo ;):D
---
I think you are missing the point here. Small maps but still dogshit performance.
---
It doesn't have to be the same style, it's just that in pubg  you have a lot of objects that you can see from far away. That proves that ue4 is capable of rendering great images if done correctly. Also in pubg with some graphic mods you can drastically boost the atmosphere
---
The Phantasm that spawns will rotate in the direction in which the player who tripped it is facing
---
It brings a lot more trouble than it's worth.
---
Somewhere in the distance you can hear the words: *Fookin dead 'ard*
---
I mean...pinky finger is still an insta down. Anything that creates the exposed status certainly aren’t fun to play against as a survivor. 
---
You are like the first person I heard of doing that. Are we seriously arguing about this? When I solo q I just wanna check the perks and go on my way, I don't need this bullshit just because once in a full moon it happens to some killers.
---
That's not the point, it's about dbd having a terrible performance whilst looking not very good
---
That too 
---
Oh, I know. I'm unfortunately very aware of how poorly optimised this game is. I'd say bring on spring but... I dunno. I don't believe the devs are gonna have it done by then.
---
Again ! Why the fuck are you getting angry at me ?  I didn't even say you couldn't enjoy the meme if you didn't know that you dumbo , seriously why are you coming at me ?
---
Repost
---
I've seen parts of the show and he appeared dumb to me but it honestly could go either way.
---
I'm curious why you don't this this is a fair comparison, regarding optimisation.
---
I chose pubg cause they run on the same engine. Difference is that pubg has tremendous scales and runs fine and dbd doesn't have many players or crazy geometry and runs fairly bad
---
Yeah, it's a shame the devs haven't optimised the game better.
---
You could argue stuff doesn't render at a distance to add to the "spooky" atmosphere but I don't think that's the case.
---
Gonna take a shot in the dark and say you're her boyfriend so regardless of what you think, it's a fact that anyone who plays this game 14 hours a day is going to be a bitter and jaded person after 4000 hours.
---
Me, a trapper main: You fools.
---
Yeah playing against Freddie definitely wouldn't be good on the eyes lol 
---
I feel like the fog doesn't reduce the render distance, it just consumes a lot of render resources
---
Where did you find t-posing myres? Asking for a friend
---
Tbh, Agitation is the biggest counter to DS, the hit radius for the skillcheck is almost as small as my dick, how on earth is anyone gonna it that.
---
How often do they try to hit you with a bottle? Especially during loops and with how easy they are to dodge. Never seen Pinky Finger and if they did have it, I never knew about it.
---

Fellow Ace mains, assemble! 
---
Implying that a full comms swf group with thousands of hours in the game won't just shit stomp a wraith or freddy.
---
Ty x
---
Nope, better to let yourself get saved and it’s too situational
---
Remove dead hard, moris, syringe, and Pinki Finger, imo.
---
If a survivor dead hards a hit from me, I'm impressed, and very rarely annoyed. I also haven't seen dead hard ever actually save a survivor out of a chase, just extend it by 2 or 3 seconds.
---
Same with Syringe plays. I know it's cool to hate SWF, but if I run into SWF and they want to waste their time with flashlight blinds, body blocking, etc, it just makes my game easier because I have more time in the game. I prefer a challenge and a well used Syringe does that.
---
I have never once been annoyed by a mori, it's a cool animation most of the time (unless you're up against a wraith). It's frustrating when you clip into things and can't see what just happend to your character, but that's it.
---
Pinki Finger just requires a little more effort in the outplay, and like I said, I enjoy a good challenge, so I'm ok with it
---
Don't be stupid fujin. You watch twitch streams all day so you should know better than most people that what you're saying is incorrect.
---
Pinky Finger is easy as shit to counter speaking from the one time I played against it (and looped a Clown for about 5 minutes before he eventually gave up trying for the instadown and just downed me normally.)
---
I'd sooner put Bloody Coil, Overcharge, or Legion in general there over RPF.
---
Day 462: I have grown tumors, had multiple seizures and my left arm fell off, but hell nah, i ain't gettin' mori'd by a Nurse! Only over my grave!

Uh, I’ve seen this problem all over Reddit, but I get a stable 120 FPS and I’m on a laptop. Ultra settings, and a 1070 Ti
---
Lol foot locker or any Athletics store. Buy joggers and a black running hoodie and some black running shoes and maybe some weightlifting gloves, as for mask probably spray paint one or something. Now you have that nice edgy boi Joey cosplay you're looking for
---
Yeah I know it's not uncommon but this post went up around 15 min after my game where someone got insidious camped. Just seemed too coincidental that the meme popped up so I had to ask. 
---
Like how Zubat faces Enaria almost every stream multiple games in a row sometimes (and knows he doesn't have DS) or when other streamers know to wait for Dead Hard etc. Because they play with the same survs all the fucking time?

Also fixed capsules
---
Not every survivor runs distortion, you're always gonna be able to find a survivor with the perk. Plus loads of people wont have it unlocked yet too. Perk will always be OP and it's got the 100% extra BP to incentivize every killer to use the OP perk.
---
I actually remember mcote answering this question he said something along the lines of., maybe one day, he would like to get the game out on all platforms but first he is mostly occupied with trying to fix many of the issues in the game and make it more and more successful and fun as the game gets bigger. With that said I wouldn't hold your breath on it but if the game gets better in terms of balances and fixes and DLCs and gets more and more bigger (which it does grow every year) then you may very well see it, but as far as 2019 goes I doubt you'll have it on a switch. But a good thing for you to hold onto is that every dev would love for their game to be successful on every platform because that is more money in their pockets
---
Why does it look so smooth? are you using a controller on PC? also I recommend changing the action binding so you can self care on a pallet with ease

---
This is a very true statement 
---
I had this happen to me when I first started playing the game except I was a rank 18 Freddy and there were 4 rank 1 survivors... 
---
Yeah, I get instantly hooked by this skin when I found out about it. Thank you!
---
If you warn people in advance that you're running a loot build and intend to give them stuff they'll normally cooperate, I've done that and run across chests that are 95% open that my teammates have left for me.
---
Thank you!
---
Oh right, I forgot that killers are supposed to let survivors walk out of the gates on this sub /s
---
For real though, not getting hooked is kinda easy against most killers. You're frustrated about tunneling, not the mori, most likely, and you attribute it to the mori  because the mori ends the game for you in a big way.
---
Seeing someone get mori'd puts the game on another level of tension. You don't know if that's the only mori or if he has ebony. When you see the second mori, you know now that you have to avoid getting hooked at all, even more so than normal. Makes you think about what you're doing to avoid the killer and plan out a looping route if you do get found
---
The FPS issues most people complain about are in regards to console, and I assure you a Nintendo switch does not have the equivalent of a 1070TI. The issue here is that while the hardware of most consoles is more than enough to handle a game like Dead by Daylight, the lack of optimization and poor stability in the existing console ports makes this seem like a bad idea for the lower powered Nintendo hardware.
---
Honestly the pc version is pretty awful too, but people like you and I tend to just brute force these issues with hardware on pc.
---
Well, they need to pick one or the other, because there's absolutely 0 reason for Billy having insane mobility, 1-hit down, OP as fuck addons like Carburetor being only green - and then making garbage killers like Pig and Legion.
---
DBD: The Hereditary Chapter
---
Ever since I prestige my Doctor I don’t ever worry about DS anymore. Console FPS combined with that tiny af skillcheck, no one gets away. 
---
Wtf you on about. It literally halfs the survivors lives. I'm not frustrated about tunnelling im frustrated that killers have to do literally HALF the work to win. Ebony Moris are instant wins for a killer. You have to be a terrible killer to not always win with it. I can't use them anymore as it takes away all the fun.

Played her for the first time last night...holy hell...
---
Because if I solo q I don't want to wait 15 minutes until I can see what I was up against. Hide it for swf until all of them are dead but not from solo.
---
And wdym there is no logical reason to do that? You never check what you were up against? 
---
I felt super bad because a teammate was hooked Billy BBQ his way to the Gen me and a teammate we're working on, my teammate goes down really quick I was able to hide from the Billy, he was looking around for me the 4th survivor never unhooks our other teammate, they die in the hook...

TBH the Doctor one is especially true if you're in Europe and remember the Russians all decided at the same time to make him their new National Mascot.

No Hate though, it's still much more relaxing than playing CS:GO.

Ok? It still doesnt change anything. Girls have an “advantage” on Twitch. The hardest part is starting out and making people click on your stream in the first place. Being a girl basically bypasses that and makes it 10x easier.

I thought this might also double as a way for those wanting to create chapters to see what the community wants instead of making something redundant and getting hated for it and deciding never to make another fan chapter. This sub needs more fan made stuff, and some good well made chapters could be just that

Yup

They exist, and they seem to do really well given they're rarer than a pot of gold on a unicorn at the end of a double rainbow

Ok go watch Zubats first game yesterday on stream where he uses it actually effectively instead of basing it off one time a baby killer used it against you
---
Yeah I know I was just posting that as a joke
---
If they'd stop breaking the damn sound for just one update then I'd main her. I usually decimate everyone as her but the sounds are so busted right now.
---
Didn't know bamboozle worked on lockers
---
It actually works consistently (Unlike Lithe, and Balanced Landing is very map dependent on working), and Deadhard depends on you being injured.  Usually that isn't an issue, but if the killer has a 1 hit down, it means you can't even use it.
---
Also, Sprintburst + First hit in a chase gives you so much speed that you can easily lose a killer, or if you jump off of a cliff with that speed, potentially putting yourself in an inaccessible area on some maps. (Coal Tower, you can throw yourself onto those tank treads with that double speed boost)
---
They throw a bottle to slow you down then walk up to you and make you exposed, it literally plays like Hillybilly’s chainsaw.
---
You're going to get shamed for everything you do in this game. Turn the end game chat off, and have fun regardless of what the shitters think of you.

Michael Myers is the only Killer who's really "scary" once you're skilled. He can still catch you by surprise which is spooky in a good way.

I also know I'm in the minority but I honestly enjoy playing against high skill Killers because it's fun to test my skills against them. Nurse, Hillbilly, Huntress, Spirit; the game becomes a battle of wits when juking them and it's very satisfying when you outplay a good Killer with your own skill.
---
I've personally never liked going against Trap Killers despite being an avid Trapper player. I don't have enough practice against them and I always get jumpscared by traps.
---
Leatherface is also just boring to play against in my opinion. Default Killer with no unique gameplay to counter beyond what you do every match.
---
And of course... Freddy. Mr "you have to get in a chase", Mr "waste time mashing spacebar while praying to RNGesus", and Mr "make the game last 40 fucking years." Freddy is only fun if you enjoy going on hour long chases with the Killer.
---
Body blocking wraith is my guess
---
Omega blink Nurse with Ruin, tunnel everyone off hook.
---
Franks mixtape Legion is also very cancer if you exploit the chase mechanics and just chase people without being in a chase
---
That’s not bad if it was a swf
---
Add TOTH and you have a real game of chicken
---
Well I personally have had the game crash a stupid number of times on both PC and console, as Killer and Survivor. It might just be that.
---
I actually like playing against the doctor to be honest, they feel like one of the most fair killers to play against. However I am still a low rank survivor. The only 2 killers I hate playing against are the same killers I hate playing as: Nurse and Legion
---
Or exits
---
Looking for? Do you not memorise the totem spawns?
---
I always hold on to the swing, if there is enough time for me to test for dead hard I ALWAYS will, unless they can deadhard to the safety of a pallet or window I wait just a little longer to swing 
---
Better than standing there and staring at a killer standing still IMO
---
So you don't want to check add ons and perks and are scared of solo survivors sending info (which is fucking ridiculous) yet somehow still such a pro that you know it 100% of the time. And for this reason you want to prohibit it for others who like to check after they are out of the game. Damn you special.
---
I do get angry when they manage to get the exit because of the perk
---
Yep. I've done this, then proceeded to decloak directly behind a Survivor, right in plain view, later in the game and *still* pulled them off the gen, because hearing the bell was no longer an instant concern for them.
---
Maybe, but he should still be ranked b at best, it is okay if only one or two are ranked in a(billy, spirit, and maybe hag)
---
And how often has pinky finger been an issue for literally anyone compared to the other stuff on that board?
---
Zubat is also a professional DBD player and not many are at his level or will ever get there in their lifetimes. He is an exception to the rule.
---
I found this reddit! I was never a reddit person (it shows) but I clicked a perk loud-out link from google, started to poke around, and it's given my roommate and I a lot of laughs this week. I'm still really nervous to post but I've seen a lot of people are pretty nice, and it's cool to see a community around a game that I've fallen in love with in the last two months.
---
Don’t assume something if other people say it.

---
Can confirm, I was recently shit on by one
---
Yes, and every single one of them uses noed. Not hating on it, just a pattern I’ve seen. Tbf he’s on the border of needing it.
---
It's so rare that I play trapper anymore, but when I do, I regret it.
---
People just seem to see me set up traps everywhere, and they always break them within a minute of me setting it up. You're a brave soul.
---
who upvotes these wack memes
---
When the last gen pops and 3 survivors all go from injured to healthy, it hurts my soul. Especially when one of them was previously in the dying state.
---
When I get that I delete it, simply. 👍
---
Because he's the world's biggest Youtuber. 1% of the WORLD is subbed to him, and you can be sure that a large portion of those are gamers. I think it would be rarer to find a gaming subreddit that *doesn't* have pewdiepie fans.
---
The other day we used 4 yellow raegants on lery’s. It was foggy for sure but since the map has lights nearly everywhere, the fog doesn’t do much. I’d assume it’s the same for the game.
---
...It's definitely bad that SWF causes such drastic mismatches 
---
I know it sucks not being able to escape, but I find this glitch endlessly amusing. 
---
Fans is a strong word
---
Probably Nurse you have to play very different for her. Also if the killer is good sakes the game an extra challenge.
---
Hate playing vs Billy because so many people play him with insta chain saws. Or lately Legion when they do the exploit with deep wound.
---
I thought it meant Day of wrath
---
yikes
---
I think the issue many people have is that you just can't get away from him. I have maybe 1300 hours in the game, and haven't played lately... so I don't know if they balanced him a little more, but... even if you juked the doctor after being made crazy to stage 3, you would ALWAYS scream, then he would find you again... and on the hook you go.
---
Just the whole powerlessness of the situation - where nothing you do matters, because he will find you regardless - is what, for me, ruined playing against the doctor
---
As a killer i don't even look at what people are holding before hand , always run demise 
---
Three now! I think he's a super cool design. I rarely win against him but it's always an interesting round.
---
And also I main him as my killer so maybe I'm just biased 
---
It's the best way to learn. ~
---
This is amazing! Love it 🤗
---
And I'm over here spawning next to 2 other team mates by a hex. I break it and of course its HG lol. 3 people spawned by it, of course one of us break it
---
I assumed it was broke. Finished all 5 gens with my roommates just to get 5 seconds. I realized we team healed one of them and assumed it was broken. 
---
Embarrassing for that rank 3 who apparently did worse than both his brown-rank teammates, lol.
---
definitely not a SWF
---
If you manage to shake him off, the best thing to do is imidiately start snapping out of it. If you don't fail the skillchecks, you won't scream. Nurses calling no longer applies to snapping out of it, so it's pretty safe to do so. Only times the docter found me after I got away was when I was hiding and forgot to snap out of it.
---
I don't enjoy it as survivor or killer. As a survivor my team mates never do gens. As a killer it's boringly easy. Idk, I just don't like it.
---
Now I want David in a tux oooooooo
---
Tier 3 nurse with 5 blinks, Ebony Mori, BBQ, ruin, nurses calling, and devour hope.
---
I’m alright with that. See if it just got on your nerves at one point so you say fuck it and get them, it’s funny. My issue was this person was like “all people who do this are toxic so they go to the 9th level of hell”(exaggeration obviously) 
---
Only reason why I think dead hard is probably the best exhaustion perk. The amount of times I’ve been able to dead hard past a swing to the gates or the hatch is insane, well worth its shortcomings.
---
I did get my ass countered one time by a Michael with save the best for last, though. Dead hard past him to the hatch not realizing he had my perk, he misses his swing and almost immediately grabs me after. Wasn’t even mad.
---
I use whispers so I know if someone's nearby. Some people are bloodhounds for traps though, so I usually use coil addons so at least they waste more time disarming them.
---
Okay, then I think they changed the timers on that... because I would always scream. Really was rage inducing for me as a rank 1 survivor to be powerless like that
---
There's a stark difference in stealth and taking a game hostage. 
---
I used to feel that way but lately I'm more inclined to intentionally give them the hatch. Kind of like a, "You all got destroyed, and just to spite you I'll let you leave, knowing you lost." I may have a problem 😂
---
Hey! We do that before they get off the hook.
---
Sounds nice. I will try when I level up my Ace
---
It’s great for hatch standoffs. If a killer and I are standing on hatch, I’ll run away, baiting him to come after me. Then, you know the rest haha
---
Do you play with a headset?
---
You won’t be saying that when you get to higher ranks. I’ve had multiple Survivors in Madness 3 hit Unnerving 3+DS. 
---
What I’m saying is that DBD ripped off Hellraiser.
---
I'm confused as to what you mean
---
It really isn’t, you’re just running into Survivors who still struggle with harder skill checks. 
---
Seems like sth else is wrong with your ps4 
---
I'm not convinced they were seasoned players if they went in like that against doc and if it ended up as a total shit show.
---
When I play skillcheck Doc, which is my normal build, I usually avoid getting stabbed. 
---
But when somebody still manages to hit it, I know that's not a good sign for me. 
---
Unless you miss alot, I guess it is.But other than that, it's not a good perk to use
---
Yes very iridescent 
---
I wasn't using a Tombstone or Fragrant Tuft of Hair, but I killed them all
---
I wish you could see ranks before the match so you could be matched fairly -,-
---
Doctor mains are just the worst
---
Ah I see you are a man of culture. Thank you
---
*twists mustache*
---
r/unexpectedthanos
---
That Kate over there
---
Does that even do anything? As a killer main I've never noticed fog as a hindrance. 
---
Hag looks fab 
---
Okay I'll avoid it then thnx!
---
I enjoy playing him here and there. Nothing is more satisfying then when you're in a Chase and someone walks right into the trap you laid down 
---
Shut up freddie main
---
It’s useful at the beginning to figure out what killer it is. If it doesn’t show an aura, you now know it is a Freddy,Myers, wraith or pig. 
---
Gg ez
---
Ah of course, I'm an idiot. Thank you. And congrats! I just have that one left, and mori 4 people trophy too haha.
---
I used Judith's Tombstone and Fragrant Tuft of Hair for the first time. It took some getting used to, but was really fun once I got the hang of it.
---
Hillbilly is Tucker in Tucker and Dale Vs Evil when he saws into the bees nest.
---
Agreed, same with window hits, I feel as if the change they made to the windows allow the killer a greater chance to get a hit through one even if you fast vault it, ive had multiple times I’ve fast vaulted a window, landed and started running on the other side, and still take a hit through the window even though on my screen the hit looks complete bullshit
---
Your welcome, hopefully you can get the achievement soon
---
Outstanding move
---
You're welcome!
---
Spirit and billy every single time. Or hag since they lay a million traps by the survivor every hook
---
Yes np 👌👌🔥
---
I hit one once and felt like a god 
---
You a rank 10 killer with 1000+ hours? 
---
“Viable confusion”
---
Still don't have proof :( that's a shame really
---
It's a meme man just appreciate it, and I don't think I'm bitter about it I just think it's a bit iratating to go against 
---
Who?
---
I think overall some of the most impactful effects are the particle effects found all over the game. That and since shadows is an important aspect, more realistic lighting and ambient occlusion. If you remember when PUBG first came out it ran like a dog. The development team prioritized performance improvements over adding content to the game. This is partially due to the style of battle royalty games and their open-endedness meaning there is a lot of replayability with the same content.
---
Meanwhile DBD runs reasonably well on most computer, but the play style relies much more on the content available so the development studio has put most of their efforts into adding additional killers/ survivors / maps. Not to mention that brings in additional revenue.
---
Also, depending on what kind of monitor you are running DBD on, you may be getting 60fps because that might be the limit your monitor can output. If you had a higher end monitor, it is entirely possible your computer could push higher frames. Personally my game runs at 120fps and I don't have a crazy build [ 6600k 1070 ]
---
Try unrelenting and save the best for last
---
You stalk and walk backwards.

Good for you man have fun! 
---
But decisive strike is the character using "whatever is at hand" to stab the killer. If they get hit by Franklin's they can't desisive strike cuz they drop the item they were gonna strike with if that makes sense.
---
You can loop a doctor for 5 gens fairly easily, even if he's good. His power only really stops unsafe loops anyways and otherwise he slows and gives you another loop. 
---
I usually play hillbilly so when a survivor gets farms, I down the farmer with my chainsaw, unless the person on the hook was juking me a lot, then I would hook him/her again- doesn’t happen often though.
---
o o f 
---
This isn't going to get sued, because it could fall under parody.
---
For the mori it should be the ending scene from the first one 
---
Spirit Fury + Enduring
---
How do you get this one?
---
It's a bit iratating tbh when you forget about it and end up getting cheated out of a down 
---
I mean yeah, realistically it makes sense, but that's not how it works in the game. You have DS no matter if the killer hits you with franklins.
---
I'm a nurse player so dead hard is MUCH worse. It's almost a guaranteed stun for me. 
---
lmao
---
You’re taking this awfully serious for a shitpost. Why didn’t you label it as a discussion if you wanted that?
---
Yes always
---
I realized what they meant. It seemed like they wanted the post game screen to be invisible until game end, but I was incorrect
---
So something I've wondered for a while: when do they killers throw in their offerings. I'm guessing it's before the survivors arrive at the campfire, but I like the image of four Claudettes chucking in a bottle of cloudy goo and a bone and Max just walks over with his skull on a bit of string and a grunt to drop it into the flames.
---
Unrelenting is good against decent loopers because they know how much time they have against the average missed swing and you can surprise them by gaining ground they weren’t expecting. 
---
Don't you think survivors have it easy enough?
---
What would you switch it for? 
---
Iridescent head + Infantry belt, you mean. 
---
Yea doc is a bish
---
Ok First I think Shrine was not a bad concept just a old one and may need update. (It was efficient in the beginning due to low number of characters.)
---
The re-hook state would nerf killer to much since it would get exploited by survivors. Unsafe unhook always because there is no penalty, prolong more time for killer result in other survivors doing gen.
---
Opinions. =) 
---
Dead Hard, imo, shouldn't be there.
---
Speaking as a Huntress main it really isn't that hard or annoying to deal with.
---
And if you're in range for an M1 all you need to do is wait for like 2 seconds and then lunge to hit them with the tip of your M1 hitbox.
---
Nurse isn't really annoying, I just feel helpless. 
---
That seems like a PS4 problem my dude not a DbD one 
---
Next update- due to the survivors abuse of lockers we decided to once again nerf survivor and buff killers; lockers are now removed from the game, there is only 1 pallet in the game that you cant throw down and every killer can insta down. That’s all the updates for today, pretty good job so far mc_ote (mathieu) out
---
"Yeah that'll show that farming survivor, I'll dc.  So what if I lose all my points he won't unhook me."
---
This is the equivalent of dcing when your about to get hooked, do yourself a favor and don't, you lose bloodpoints and it makes you look bad.  Anyways you might get a killer who hates farmers aswell and they might spare you.
---
All 5 gens, popped. 
---
It sometimes cheats you out of a hit and let's them loop for longer and every second counts as Killer 
---
Watch Mama. She’s clearly based on Mama with a Japanese twist. 
---
you gotta run up to them and tbag their dying body 
---
Definitely Predator. Collects spines and can shimmer. 
---
I mean it's also giving him garbage players that are rank 20. Theres. Ot really much you can do without requiring similar ranks to play together, which would piss a lot of people off.
---
Ok my point is do you feel the urge to go into the comments of people that like him and bash him?
---
i’m a doc main and when i see a doc go against me using iridescent king i start crying
---
All the achievements in the base game, last breath, flesh and mud, and spark of madness.  Basically base game achievements, nurse, hag, and doctor achievements
---
Thank you
---
Dead hard
---
Netcode, good luck Devs trying to reproduce this bug lol. Probably have to do more checks to see if you're supposed to be hooked or not attached to the killer
---
Killer being salty, and even screenshots said saltiness for reddit. I love it. 
---
it is easier to land a bottle on a survivor than a hatchet imo
---
i hate going against both but at least i can make a better attempt at dodging hatchets
---
oh shit, i saw that movie years ago, youre right!
---
Except it is, i run DS 90% of the time, and the worst things are Unnerving Pressence and Zappy Skillchecks, if they combine it with the killer waggling and hiting arround like an autist and bringing me out of focus, i have about 5% chance to hit it overall.
---
Haha jeez that sucks. One of my friends were hyped for that game. I was wondering why they never brought it up again.
---
It knocks the glass out of their hands /s
---
I honestly think that’s one of BHVR’s jokes. 
---
So many American remakes of Japanese horror films. So take a truly unique American horror film and give it a Japanese remake lmfao. 
---
The face on the right gets me every time 
---
I hate toxic survivors.
---
this glitch once happened to claudette and her hair looked like that one rapper's hair
---
You mean like how killers say the same about survivors..? 
---
If you don't need decisive strike, then there was nothing in need of turning around in the first place
---
you're more likely to be struck by lightning that this ^ ^ ^ ^
---
Good luck, most you get by just playing but, where did they all go and from the void she kills are really hard to get.  For the latter one farm or just play nurse, but where did they all go, you need a 3 person SWF at least, maybe 2, but then you need either a great game or AFK/terrible killer.  It's actually not to hard to get this achievement but it take a very long grind.
---
That other addon that makes you always hear the bell scared the shit out of me when I was new to the game.
---
Plenty of sprint bursts wasted
---
If they can't get base Xbox One and PS4 to run smoothly, this would be a slideshow on Switch. Not to mention the lag fest it would end up being for players "on the go" until dedicated servers are in place. 
---
Dude a pro killer player can make freddy look OP. This is a terrible argument 
---
Spoole? Have you come out of hiding?
---
Omg.  Me too.  At first I thought every survivor was running dead hard.  It has to be one of the most infuriating things in the game besides DC. 
---
Go ahead and play killer then. Get to rank 5-10 and then you'll see
---
Once again thank you i will try for the normal ones next
---
They're just fan ideas I don't think it should be anything you should work yourself over with. Speaking of ideas for killers, would love the killer from my bloody Valentine. Potential to be another ranged killer with his 1 pickaxe and blinding survivors with the mininh helmet. Not an insta blind of course but a progression thing like when blinding a killer  if you look back for too long at him during your chase he'll blind you.
---
Pro tip : swap that tinkerer 1 for enduring 1 
---
“Just delay the game longer than ruin does for the chance that the killer runs noed bro lol stop crying baby survivor”
---
Omg... Me too Took me like a week tho but still stupid.
---
I’m glad you confusion is meta. He could also just rarely play anymore and be at that rank as of it 
---
That’s what I was worried about, I’m decent at chases but I couldn’t lead a chase all game, I’ve got to rank 8 without any problems really but I don’t know how long it’ll be before I notice it’s taking up a slot it shouldn’t be 
---
ONE OF THE MOST FRUSTRATING THINGS TO ME AS A SURVIVOR IS WHEN A KILLER DOESN'T READ THEIR OWN PERK DESCRIPTIONS.
---
WAS AN OBSESSION, DON'T RUN OBSESSION PERKS. HAD A HAG TUNNEL ME HARDCORE, SUPER-TRAP ME ON THE HOOK (SIX DIFFERENT TRAPS EACH TIME I WAS HOOKED,) CHASE EVERYONE OFF OF ME, TUNNEL ME OFF HOOK. FIGURED I WAS DYING LIGHT. I WAS "SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST."
---
HAD A BILLY WITH MAKE YOUR CHOICE WHO FACECAMPED AND KEPT SWINGING AT ME WHILE I WAS ON THE HOOK... AND MISSING. YOU'RE NOT GIVING ANYONE ANY REASON TO UNHOOK ME, NOR ARE YOU FAR ENOUGH AWAY FOR MYC TO PROC ANYWAY.
---
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD JUST READ WHAT YOUR PERKS DO BEFORE YOU PLAY THE GAME WITH THEM.
---
The amount of people who think Hellraiser ripped off Dead By Daylight has me SHOOK
---
Karma for using dead hard????
---
What is alert exactly? Is it a teachable? Not too up knowledgable when it comes to the perks
---
Don't mean to sound mean because the art looks great, but I gotta say she looks like Wanda from The Magic School Bus
---
Face wise at least
---
Geeze if you're seriously judging someone's entire quality of person based on actions in a video game you need to grow the fuck up
---
Where does Laurie get the glass from then....
---
The blood web is how you get perks and items and add ins so definitely be doing that. Keep in mind after a certain level, I believe 10, you will start losing things in the pbloodweb to the entity to chose your path wisely on it. Also, complete gens, cleanse totems, heal people, win chases. These all help you rank up and gain more blood points. Try out different styles of play to get better dont just stick with what you are comfortable with or you will get sort of stuck. And last but not least, dont be toxic. Getting cocky and tea bagging as a survivor is a good way to get tunneled or camped. And as a killer, face camping will actually earn you less bloobpoints against a decent team because they will just gen rush. So be aware of how friends and enemies play and adapt to it.
---
Yeah I prefer a game where I can do gens and unhook others as opposed to being chased all game
---
Sure, people can smack out those skillchecks at the higher (well, lower) ranks, but as a rank 1 killer, I've still had survivors miss DS without any perks that would affect the skill checks.
---
When you get the doctor on that map death can't come quick enough. Worst map. But I would welcome a new indoor venue. Shopping mall or a massive blockbuster video store or haunted mansion.
---
Oh man I never really thought of using whispers while settings traps. Makes sense tho haha
---
For me, to play against Nurse is way more fun than Legion. Legion is just pure garbage.
---
I've rarely had anyone use it to that effect.
---
It's as rare as a no blink bamboozle nurse.
---
You could always grind towards prestiging a character fully (prestige 3, level 50). 
---
+ Legion
---
Maybe you aren't in the right region in my region it's sorta common 
---
It’s a Feng Ming teachable. They recently buffed it and it makes you see the killer anywhere on the map when he/she performs a breaking action. This includes kicking gens and breaking pallets (usually meaning they’re in a chase). Much more useful than Dark Sense where you have to do gens before it works. 
---
Never knew survivors can kill
---
I wanna off myself when the doctor is on 
---
Whenever my brother gets moried I run as fast as possible to throw pebble and tea bag. Which usually ends up with me being moried after but hey if I get to disrespect him it is so very worth it 
---
F
---
True true. 
---
What is SWF?
---
What rank was she ? 
---
Thought it was the killer complaining lol gg
---
They both have the same broken issue of completely ignoring all of the survivors defenses, but Legion is definitely worse. It take a lot of skill to make the Nurse good, but Legion is just incredibly simple. Frenzy, slash, follow them by breaking chase, and they die. Not cool. 
---
Well the bloodweb is the only thing you can spend your bloodpoints on, so go nuts. Once a character reaches level 30 you can begin to unlock their teachable perks for other characters. At level 50 you can prestige for some cosmetics (and an ever so slightly higher chance of rarer items in your bloodwebs) or continue to put bloodpoints into your character.
---
Only 1 death? Lol thats bad
---
I’m so stupid I literally got the adept Feng min perk just before Christmas, I do now remember it thank you, when I get chance I’ll use feng and then if I prefer it pummel points into her bloodweb
---
She picks it up while shes getting picked up.
---
You got this!
---
Thanks! How do the bloodweb items work though, I unlocked a toolbox but it apparently got destroyed after only one match. Do I have to keep upgrading the web until I get another one or steal one from the basement?
---
Also, is it just me— or Freddy’s lunges are ridiculously long? 
---
it doesnt matter if it isnt used alot, its still broken
---
I agree, once you know a survivor has it you can always bait it out
---
Hate? No. But one of the reasons I liked Pewds, despite being 36, is the fact he was so infectiously positive. This started to go downhill when he started dabbling in humor that seemed way beyond his scope to handle correctly. I love controversial humor, as Daniel Tosh, Jim Norton, and Anythony Jesselnik are some of my favorite comics. PewDiePie just seemed like he was trying to garner controversy for the sake of causing a stir (not including his calling someone the N word on stream, because that just seemed like an impulsive mistake.
---
His continued support of someone who is clearly a neo-Nazi, and trying to defend it as not being the focus of why he showcases him is where he lost me.
---
Mostly due to the fact that hellraiser existed long before Dead by daylight was a thing. Decent movie series
---
Dead hard? I love it when survivors have dead hard cause it’s more often than not a wasted perk slot
---
I had a similar situation where I had a meg that was rank 12 while I'm a rank 16 killer. They kept teabagging at every pallet stun or chase, jumping in and out of lockers, etc. So they were teabagging at the exit gate with sprint burst, I hit them and they ran into the corner of the exit gate and it allowed me to hit them again and hook them after everyone left. It felt pretty good to get that annoying dick at the end
---
For context: I was trying to play Nurse, and found the Claudette with the long dreadlocks first, but I could never hit her, and I tried for several minutes. At one point I decided to just go face a wall and just shake my head because I sucked too much as a Nurse. Then this Claudette comes near and signals me and helps me practice for a while my teleporting and stuff with her (or him i dunno). We keep at it while the others just finish their gens. At one point I go to the exit and all three were there and this happened. After that we returned to the map I practiced a few more times with the Nurse they even let me hook/damage a couple times, good survivors for all the toxicity that sometimes happens in this game there are some really good moments that happen from time to time, if you were in this game thank you!
---
Actual rank 18 survivor
---
Lmao this sub is so toxic
---
Yeah. I just can’t stand a window every 2 feet and a pallet every 4 feet. It’s not fun at all
---
Nothing to do with you being on console
---
nipple clamp david
---
It is such a bitch thing to do though, let the killer prepare accordingly to what survivors are bringing. 
---
I see doctor gang over there
---

---
/*Tips Fedora*/
---
/*laughs*/
---
There is an unsafe hook rescue penalty. Rather than having to find another survivor, another one showed themselves by unhooking. As long as the killer goes for the unhooker, the killer will benefit.
---
Cake day girl
---
If you're deadharding for distance, you're better off using sprint burst, lithe, or balanced landing.
---
Who gives a shit? Survivors are boosted entitled babies who bitch about literally everything.
---
How can this be real...
---
11:59 pm
---
I feel like nowadays purple flashlights aren’t annoying anymore. And is the finger actually annoying? That’s the clown add on where if he hits you DIRECTLY you’re exposed right? I can never get a direct hit, it’s so hard. 
---
I just hop in a locker. Most doctors are so used to people running away that they usually don't see it coming
---
Holy fuck the moonwalk. That pisses me off to no end.
---
Sincerely - I'm impressed!
---
I hope he gets reworked or something honestly. He is not very fun to play against. Enjoy going up against the doctor more tbh
---
Dead hard has so much potential in the right hand it can cheat you out of a down and extend a loop really long or even let them go to another loop while sprint burst only gives them a small distance away from you 
---
Yeah, I’ve heard his methods are a little shocking.
---
They aren't they are just annoying 
---

Xbox here, do you do the spin? I always do a 2 second twirl b4 I move towards the hook!  It works maybe 50 percent of the time.
---
I was gonna put pallets but I didn't because some people would say"well what are survivors supposed to do just wait for the killer to down them" and plus people aren't happy with dead hard even tho it has good placement imo
---
How to become a grade a killer in 1 switch.
---
Ok you got a downed person when they bodyblock, now keep going and target the unhooker. Then people get off the gens to pick up the downed guy
---
Dead Hard has a lot of potential, yeah, but it's not completely game-ruining like Iri Head and so on. I find Balanced Landing and Sprint Burst more annoying, seeing as Dead Hard has a lot of counterplay outside of the use-cases where they'll get to that window that they wouldn't have made otherwise. It's the only Exhaustion perk that you can play around at least to some degree. There's no counter to someone jumping off a hill and zooming away with BL.
---
No extra Blink addons?
---
I'm pretty sure the person using DS is the one who's actually Satan
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
Killer perks on the end game screen don't show up until the match is over
---
Yeah there's nothing wrong with face-camping at a hook that is literally next to the open exit gate if you've lost that hard. When I play survivor I'm totally okay with it, as long as the killer didn't face-camp the rest of the match, I already got my points.
---
To be clear: This was in reference to the balancing. A lot of the concepts/flavour can be pretty cool and interesting but it never seems to be all that well thought through when it comes to making the perks/abilities fair so they often end up feeling like insane power creep. Nothing about the creative identities/lore that people obvsiously spend a lot of time writing.
---
I like the spirit but it depends on how you play
---
Some maps don't have many high up cliffs or places and sprint burst kinda slows you down because you avoid running in order to save it 
---
plague doctor or scarecrow please 
---
Depends on your playstyle, but I love the Hag
---
I had a ton of fun with The Clown when he first came out, and I recently started to enjoy playing The Spirit, and The Shape is always a lot of fun with certain add-ons, and The Cannibal can be a lot of fun as well. Those would be my picks for console DLC killers.
---
I'm not complaining about it, just stating
---
It helps a lot with initial detection. shadow born  and a reduce haze, and you can see so much more. Only problem is when your anyone but Billy and you and a surv make eye contact across the map itrying to close a 10+ second head start isn't that productive. 
---
I mean, it's easy to avoid when you are not the last one standing, but it does suck being at the receiving end of Rancor when you never run obsession perks to begin with. 
---
I would say spirits fury personally since aura-reading perks don't mesh with her power too well. And combined with enduring it's an instant cool down attack if you get pallet stunned.
---
That's not camping, camping isnt bannable. Just ignore them 
---
I think you're overestimating the amount of maps where there's no way to activate BL, and I think you're underestimating the strength of Sprint Burst allowing you to get from the middle of no-where to almost any pallet of your choosing upon hitting shift. You're never out of position with Sprint Burst, and that's part of the reason why it's top tier.
---
It’s been happening to me lately, I lose my offerings which sucks
---
Clean your fans
---
If you choose  A Nurse's Calling 3, there is no guarantee that Spirit Fury 3 will appear on the next bloodweb. It's all RNG. I would personally choose A Nurse's Calling 3,but that's up to you
---
Honestly, this sub is 100% either salt or memes. It's such a blessing when I see the occasional artwork or game discussion

---
Nah, I'm on PC. Since this game is so unbelievably grindy, there's no way I could get myself to play on another platform.
---
Wasn't that from months ago...
---
"But he can turn into a survivor and hide in closets. perfect!"
---
2.4 completely bugged the post game screens.
---
I heard there will be an optimization in the Spring.Not sure about the Legion and Freddy buffs maybe when balance patch comes out
---
I mean if someone says he's an "awesome streamer" than I have the right to say my opinion just like they do. Also why are you so offended? You sucked him off or something?
---
The shrine "at first" was good but  with all the different perks and new players rolling in only the vets can see the real value in it. This is why the dev's need to keep up with the constant changing game more than adding new cosmetics.
---
The re-hook state would only nerf killers that camp the hook, adding incentive for them to focus on map control.  The current exploits are killer proxy camping the first hooked survivor, then repeating the process.   
---
They're trying to say that 10 minutes is a pretty average time to get gens done. Coordinated SWF can pop them way more quickly
---
Yeah, this bugged ritual was ticking me off, I started wondering if Behaviour changed it to 180 minutes lol. Kudos to sticking it out though, I had to replace it.
---
I ain’t always burn an ivory and put on Dying Light
---
But let me tell you about MY Jason idea
---
The decisive strike skill check is the most laggy thing known to man.
---
Yah but there have been issues about swf for 2 years bc of it
---
The unsafe hook penalty is instead of 1500 points (1000 for unhook, and 500 for safe rescue) you just don't get the extra 500, and if they run WGLF the 500 is a small trade off for the extra 25% overall boost. 
---
Vampire.
---
 Touché
---
Found the Claudette main.
---
Ah, to be young and naive again.
---
Still can't figure out why the sudden rapid beeping as they try to leave doesn't alert them that that's a bad idea.
---
Unnerving Presence with Enduring while playing as Doctor for those random madness placements
---
First of all, thanks for answering and for staying serious.
---
**Particles**
---
I already assumed that the fog uses a lot of render resources, since it has some small details and looks actually way better than the one that was in pubg. To be honest besides the fog I don't see a lot of other particles (in the usual gameplay).
---
**Lightning**
---
I just looked at some footage and didn't really find what I was looking for. Shadows. Only some bright lights cast shadows, on some maps. Additionally I am not sure whether most of the objects have AO. Overall everything looks very flat and has a lack of texture.
---
If you look at my screenshot from pubg, it is definitely not overwhelming visually but there are shadows, even the bush seems to be affected by the light source/sun.
---
I know that accurate lightning is expensive, but definitely possible. Overall in dbd I am happy with the models and the effects, but it would looks a lot better if the image would have some depth.
---
**The development of the games**
---
I didn't know a lot about the development process of pubg, so thanks for the insights. This explains the current states of both games. However, in my post I wanted to kind of show what's possible visually. Since the overall atmosphere of the game is important in a horror game. 
---
The community has multiple times now requested a quality of life update and to leave out a chapter, so that the devs can focus on different aspects. Of course the game lives financially of new paid content. Still, I believe the game can survive one missing chapter over a quality of life update. That would especially help the console player base. 
---
On the good side the dedicated servers are definitely a good decision for the future of the game. 
---
**The performance**
---
My fps are capped at 60 that's true, but if I play killer or on different maps it often enough falls below 60 fps.
---
I hope I didn't miss anything. Have a nice day
---
I saw 3 today.... Just my luck I guess. One was so good, she was sniping people across the map with BBQ.... Needless to say we didn't had best time.
---
Rancor is so annoying that they should either give the obsession a bigger buff rather then seeing the killer every now and then. Or remove the obsession on it
---
"Got to get back to the hook, must tunnel already hooked survivor!"
---
id rather play against omegablink nurse than legion. At least game would end quick. 
---
Anything can be a dildo if you are ambitious enough - Nea, probably.
---
Survivors get less bloodpoints because if they survive the match they get to keep their items + add ons. Hell, they can even go into a match without an item, search a chest and then escape with a new item and their bloodpoints from the match. 
---
That's because survivors have brown-purple and can use multiple, killers only have the one.
---
No bans on ps4. Lucky for you
---
Thanks. Sickens me that these people get away with this shit. 
---
Wait for rank reset and slug
---
It's only fog downstairs on the game
---
I'd wear it
---
I don't need self care with bond my man. Just look for another survivor. Also selfcare is so fucking slow is not very worth.
---
Why the fuck arnt the perks of a killer hiden untill ALL suvivors are dead or escaped ! 
---
Did you just call the cult classic movie franchise hell raiser a Chinese knock off unsarcasticly?
---
While I agree with you, you kinda *gave* the reason. You can sit back without headphones, relax, meme around and have a good time. I still
---
Agree more than 100%.
---
Someday it'll release
---
It still does add risk to DS users and it's not a random player. It always picks the obsession which is 99.99% of the time going to be DS. But yea it does kinda suck to get rancor when no1 has DS.  
---
However, rancor is one of the easiest things to avoid. On the first gen completed you instantly know the killer has it, so it's as simple as hiding like a pansy when the last gen gets done. Let someone else open gates. Rancor literally gives you the killers location for several seconds after a gen completes too so it makes hiding from them that much easier on that last gen.
---
Prayers help haha. I can't do it myself though
---
I dunno man, bad nurses are actually free, good ones seem unstoppable. Why do you think Legion is garbage by the way? I see people say this a lot, but I really don't get why they do. What makes him garbage?
---
I meant the toy, asshole.
---
I won’t even use it anymore because my pc has a heart attack every time it shows up
---
r/suicidebywords
---
God I had that used against me once and it was the most "Confused Screaming" match I ever had.
---
&gt; people with a brain who know that both sides have issues that “mains” dont like to talk about.
---
Amen.
---
I must never play against these good survivors. What tends to happen the most is the survivor thinks I’m gonna swing cause I’m in range they use there dead hard, I don’t swing and down them 1 second afterwards. On a rare occasion someone may dead hard to a pallet they wasn’t going to make without it but that happens so little.
---
He's not supposed to be like the other killers. Otherwise why release a new killer if they're all going to be the same. 
---
Seriously. He doesn't need a buff. I don't play as all the killers because some simply don't fit into my play style or work well at higher ranks for me. Personally I don't mind that. I like the clown a lot. but he's not my style and I never play as him. 
---
Regardless, I've played against some very good Legion players as well as bad ones. You're either going to be good at him or you're not. He's listed as a hard killer. 
---
Yeah I don’t run into too many people that do that
---
Nurses calling doesn't really work well with Spirit, despite most people saying to get it. You cannot see auras when phasing. But at the same time Spirit Fury isn't that amazing unless you also have Enduring. Spirit Fury and Enduring combined are very strong IMO. 
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Hey congrats you managed to kill a full team of 3 with nurse. Didn’t even give you your measly points to give him the 7k for hatch either. Real asshole, I’d say nurse will suit you perfectly.
---
THIS is why legion is boring
---
A lot of killers have this moment, Legion doesn't. Just stab.
---
1. I wasn't sure whether this really belonged into discussions, since I just wanted to show the difference between these games and show what is possible with enough work.
---
2. I try to reply to everyone, because everybody wants to get some sort of feedback on their thoughts (the way you do). Whether it's a joke or not. Some take it serious others don't.
---
It looks like David and Jake have melt into one another. Call him Dake or Javid.
---
Were you the bill I grabbed in this clip by any chance?
---
The value of items gained from the Trial + their base Bloodpoint gains don't add up to that of the Killer's, or even close to it. However I'd be fine if base Survivor Bloodpoint gains were, say, 80% that of the Killer's.
---
On top of that, I don't believe Survivors have a Survivor equivalent to BBQ &amp; Chili where it just straight-up doubles Bloodpoint gains. I hope the next chapter fixes that.
---
I finally got over my fear of taking off the z-block and unicorn block add-ons to change to Nancy's Masterpiece and the Green Dress add-ons, and I'm so glad I did. I can sleep everybody when they're so far away from me, including when someone just unhooked another survivor. It's beautiful.
---
10 minutes is so long. And even solo queue can pop 3 gens in 3 minutes even when ruin is up.
---
An animal hybrid. Something more primal than current killers.
---
I found perks are always the hardest part to fan chapters. You have to make them good for the killer they came with, but also good for most of the other killers and none super op on killers. Aka say what if nurse came with perk that increased her movement speed by 10% really good for her and makes looping impossible given she now is faster than you aswell. But give that perk to literally any other killer and it'd be insanely op. Normal killers will be 125% speed.  
---
I know nurse is a bad example given she's the strongest in game. But her one downside is her base speed, so i was going on that 
---
Did this on the game in the bathroom without quick and quite. Wish I would have clipped it
---
&gt;  I'm not complaining about it, just stating.   
---
  My complaint is the salt in the endgame chat, like bro have some empathy, I can't just turn my back to the hook and let EVERYONE escape 
---
Yeah because fuck using the killer's time right? Why would a survivor ever want to do that?
---
We're Going to Live Forever is the Survivor BBQ&amp;C.
---
Wraith is very flexible. Find addons and perks that work for you. :)
---
Since Wraith is based on having a supressed Terror Radius perks that revolve around the Terror Radius (Unnerving/Overwhelming Presence and Down2Clown Phobia, also Monitor and Abuse) aren't that useful. (Though you can run Distressing for increased Bloodpoint gain. :)) Also as a W + M1 Killer you're going to be munching a lot of pallets, so Brutal Strength/Enduring/Spirit Fury (my favorite is Spirit Fury - it feels great to laugh and go [YOU UNDERESTIMATE MY POWER](https://youtu.be/DA9iW8iG4ps) to Survivors who think they have the high ground) are all good choices.
---
Other than that run ye ol' god perks: Ruin, BBQ, Bamboozle, Sloppy Butcher (Sloppy is kinda bugged right now so maybe not that), Make Your Choice etc. etc. etc.  
---
Should mention that Nurse's Calling in particular is really good on Wraith because Survivors won't hear your TR but you'll be able to see them, and if you're running Jumpscare you can sneak up on them without them knowing and down them thanks to Nurse's.
---
With your perks I'd recommend Ruin, Save the Best (I really love STB it really cuts down on chase time), Brutal Strength, and probably Overcharge. Maybe keep grinding the Bloodweb for more perks like Sloppy Butcher, NOED, or Whispers or possibly even run some of Wraith's teachables. All of Wraith's perks are honestly great for tracking: Predator is kinda iffy since scratch marks are in a constant state of being broken (ty Behavior) but Sloppy is amazing for tracking injured Survivors and Shadowborn is actually really nice to catch sight of Survivors trying to sneak away.
---
The number of survivors + 1 = Gens Done.
---
For example, when 2 people are left you need 3 Gens done. 
---
Saw what was going on and he just decided it wasn’t worth the wasted time.
---
So one person left and 4 gens? 
---
Calm Spirit you must mean?
---
I don't know anything about hacking, but I hope dedicated servers get rid of lag switching like this. At very least it will get rid of killers that are that laggy for real.
---
yep, and Im annoyed about it as well,  but unless you add an extra swf matchmaking-Q, that Killers can disable if they want, there is nothing anyone can do
---
Playing as a Survivor and playing as the Killer, while entirely different experiences, shouldn't have one or the other side punished simply for playing the game as intended. Yes, I could sit back without headphones and relax, but I'm still very much a part of the game as the Killer.
---
I mean take, for lack of better example, Dragon Ball FighterZ. Your three fighters dictate your entire playstyle. Match outcome aside, you shouldn't get less points if you're playing Frieza Vegeta and Nappa, in lieu of the other player's Goku Piccolo and Krillin.
---
One person left should open as long as 2 are done. 
---
Ok this just became not worth my time
---
I think it only happens with Wraith, guess we will see a fix with the mid chapter patch. 
---
yeah something isn't right, way too long queues as survivor
---
The only reason I'd want something like this is so that people know I'm running deliverance and not to waste their time unhooking me. 
---
I have yet to cry at a mori. Then again, I main killer so I understand the feeling that a kill is going to equate to so much salt
---
Its so people dont want to leave  because they wont click on the dab .
---
something ia clearly wrong wait times are ridiculous as Survivor
---
@ Freddy pulling into dream state 
---
@ wraith and sloppy butcher 
---
@ a 4 o clock DS skill check 
---
@ every time the spirt comes out of her phase 
---
@ when playing surv and doc spames you 30 times 
---
@ sometimes even nothing your game just shits it self because consoles trash right?
---
@ when the clown intoxicates you 
---
@ the start menu :(
---
That checks out.
---
Some kind of Fisherman, clad in a heavy diving suit. His power could be a harpoon launcher or something like that
---
how did one almost get 2 pips yet no points?
---
Yea cuz killers are assholes for wanting to use their rare Addams every once in a while makes sense
---
Survivor is actually easier than killer if both know how to play. Survivors just have so many ways to waste the killer's time, but they make mistakes ofc, that's where killers can profit. Only Nurse is better than survivors. On low ranks the killer is way stronger than the survivors, because they don't know what to do. The killer doesn't either, but he has his power which does a lot for him, so he doesn't need as much knowledge as the survivors. Tbh I enjoy both sides, on surv I mainly play Claudette and David, on killer it's Michael, Nurse and Freddy.

No, its a wonderful argument. No killer is bad, some are just not as good as the others. Its all about skill, and if you struggle with it... well, you suck...

What kind of killers have you been playing with? I've never seen a face camp once.
---
???? Are you being serious? What kind of comparison is that lmao. Iron Maiden isnt used because its bad. Pinky finger isnt used because no one uses clown and its an iridescent add on.
---
Who heals against the legion. Its pointless too time consuming. And self care received a nerf already 
---
Just give me Pinhead and I'll be happy.
---
Welp okay I understand 
---
You're for real?
---
You know what? I've got maybe 300 hours on survivor and have only been moried maybe... 3 times? Apparently this is much more common that it is for me 🤔
---
Intuitive answer. Very insightful. 
---
&gt;but Legion, his power without add-ons and perks is literally unplayable.
---
&gt; Loops
---
not toxic
---
&gt; Bodyblocks
---
&gt; T-bags
---
&gt; Flashlight flicks
---
&gt; Taunts emotes
---
toxic, but who cares
---
&gt; DS, sprint bursting, instaheals
---
how dare someone use features in the game
---
&gt; SWF squadding
---
not always toxic, often is, but a bigger problem is how it breaks the game
---
&gt; Gen rushes
---
Not toxic, but gen repairs go by way too quickly. that is what should have been addressed rather than healing 
---
Um we kinda have to run hex perks, especially Ruin because of how fast gens are done. 
---
If you’re gonna say it’s on the killer for running hex perks, then same should go for DS users being tunneled, because it’s their fault for bringing such an OP perk. 
---
Smack em on hag, lay a trap, survivor runs towards shiny toy, "wait she isn't dead, haggy suprise", smack that, survivor on the floor (smack that 'till you get sore), hook time baby!
---
Bonus: crouching gate guys lose their map! 
---
Worst part is that because you have to walk around the map to avoid activating it, you’re way more likely to get caught out of place and then in return need to use it.
---
You kind of answered your own question. The game is harder for killers, so they're compensated with more BP. Not to mention survivors are at least somewhat splitting any potential BP gains amongst themselves throughout the match. 
---
yes, please. fixing sounds and Trapper would be nice
---
can’t survivors have nice perks 
---
seems like every good survivor perk nowadays needs a nerf 
---
Predator is more pretiful than Wraith, Wraythe is based on the Thing because whoa ugly.
---
&gt; one of the few survivor sides memes ever posted.
---
Oh my god this is delusional 
---
 &gt;Everything is DS this or that on this sub
---
are you kidding? every other post is NOED tears
---
&gt; Then theres you standing idly by at all hours of the night to jump in with your "survivors have it so easy" etc.
---
man you weird
---
and escaping is much easier
---
 &gt;My first comment played out exactly how you were going to act. Thank you for proving it. GG.
---
aaaan you're too delusional to understand the irony 
---
My thoughts on it is that I am never owed a rescue. It is a credit to the team when they do, but I am not owed that. Not if the killer is camping anyway. If the killer leaves the hook then it is kind of a dick move by the team.
---
The most telling part of this is the mods can't take it down because there's The Doctor. Also best part is what they did to that man's nipples...
---
Was it not possible for you to find a higher quality poster to edit? 
---
Self Care not being the biggest hinderance to Freddy is not really that big of an alteration. 
---
Frank's mix tape 
---
You did the right thing there. If a killer camps, the best thing you can do is make them pay the gen tax.
---
3 gens still need to be done in the video, the exposed is probably from MYC or HG
---
Lol k, bro.
---
Valid points, but my argument is that Legion is in such a fucked position right now, and even with the healing nerfs, it doesn't seem to be enough. Something needs to change for him to be viable as a killer. I love the guy, I love his kit, and I love jumping over those fucking pallets that people camp at, expecting me not to just vault over it when they slam it down. But I don't love trying to spread Deep Wounds to 2, 3, or even all 4 survivors, just to have each of them heal it, then self care back to full health. Sure, you get some decent bloodpoints, but I've rarely gotten a single down when I've hit multiple survivors. 
---
If you have other suggestions, I'd love to hear them, though. 
---
I always find you guys in lockers lol. 
---
Looks more like a Speed Skater
---
Maps are trash tier. Why do you care about taking players' maps? 
---
I'MMA FIND YOU, LITTLE BOY! AND MAKE YOU APOLOGIZE CUZ MY PLAN TO HAVE SPAGHET MAN IN THE GAME GON' HAPPUN!
---
I think he knows people spend time on them but let’s be realistic here, the devs aren’t going to put in fan made killers or survivors in the near future or even ever bc they have bigger things to work on rn
---
Its not about taking the maps, its about sending a message. 
---
That depends. Can killers have a match where the first person to die doesn't cry about getting tunneled or camping?
---
HE TURNS PEOPLE INTO SPAGHET WITH HIS HANDS THAT ARE A FORK AND A SPONN! AND HE HAS NO WEAKNESSES+QUITE THE LOOKKER!
---
This sub is heavily killer sided. I've seen posts calling for pallets to be removed, recently another self care nerf, gen speed decreased, hatch closure. 
---
The prevailing opinion is fuck survivors and they don't have to survive anyway.
---
haha that's what I thought 
---
The music is supposed to start playing before the screen pauses. It pretty much ruins what makes it funny
---
Yes, this is Deadpool. Mmmhmmm.
---
You look like such a headass right now with this post heading towards being front paged
---
Lol we have a big boi over here. Just tip your fedora to me and give me a gg so we can be done with this convo. That gives you time to head back over to r/justneckbeardthings.
---
Legion isn't an unviable killer, you just need to change your standards for them. The way the game defines a winner and the way the playerbase defines a winner are different things. Putting deep wounds on all players and having them have to self care back up to full, that wastes a lot of time and gets you gatekeeper emblems and chase emblems. If you can find a couple of people and punish them while they are healing too, then you are also getting the third emblem that I can never remember it's name. Yeah, you aren't necessarily getting sacrifices, but killing everyone is the player defined win condition, not the game's defined win condition. Legion is a busted killer, but self care is a long way from the reason why. Legion's design is simply unintuitive at best, and if you use the chase exploit then you can guarantee survivors going down with no possibility to stop you. There is just a lot of things about legion which suck to go against.
---
That intimidation. I'm v scared of that.
---
Imo Hillbilly is a killer that only really feels busted depending on the map. 
---
Like, Coldwind Farm where he can just yeet from one side of the map to another in a matter of seconds? That feels pretty odd and it's a bit hard to counter as a survivor depending on skill and other things.
---
But the Game? You better be a damn good Billy for that one.
---
Myers is really good. Not only is he a beast with addons, he can still dominate without addons. If you wanna scare the shit outta survivors, play Myers with Dead Rabbit and Monitor and Abuse. He’s the most shit your pants terrifying killer imo 
---
4 survivors alive = 5 gens need to be done for the hatch to exist
---
3 survivors alive = 4 gens need to be done for the hatch to exist
---
2 survivors alive = 3 gens need to be done for the hatch to exist
---
1 survivor   alive = 2 gens need to be done for the hatch to exist
---
Wanhhhh it's not a fair 4 v 1.
---
&gt; recently another self care nerf,
---
That post was downvoted into the ground, unlike this one. Please
---
&gt; I've seen posts calling for pallets to be removed
---
Any upvoted ones? I've seen posts crying that bloodlust needs to be removed

&gt; gen speed decreased
---
It should be. The healing nerf should be undone and gens should be addressed
---
&gt; hatch closure.
---
lying liar lies. people just say that stand-offs need to be fixed
---
&gt; The prevailing opinion is fuck survivors
---
delusional
---
&gt; and they don't have to survive anyway.
---
This sub is flooded with people making up rules for how the killer has to kill but okay lmfao
---
Claudette:  You can’t seriously stand there and facecamp me the entire game.
---
Leatherface:  Oh I am serious.  Look, (puts on Dwight skin mask) this is my serious face.
---
Game
---
Only on console
---
Damn, thanks for your suggestion! 
---
you didn't drag the body to the campfire for meat?!?!
---
Oh my god I feel so bad for the nea  
---
RIP
---
If you have Enduring, go for Spirit Fury, but otherwise I’d go with Nurse’s. 
---
Intimidation?
---
what the fuck are you talking about you fucking dork
---
yes? it is unplayable. means their power itself cripples them. means without a game changing add-on they're trash. you could say "then just play Mixtape all the time" but for game balance it's disgusting. survivors can't counter it, there's literally no way to do it. it's always 3-4 free kills. 
---
let's look at other add-ons on other killers.
---
Trapper add-ons: all counterable. you just need to not get trapped which isn't hard. all his add-ons are for traps.
---
Wraith: literally everything is about paying attention, having a plan in chase and knowing maps.
---
Billy: doesn't really have anything too op, just some tweaks that help them turn, start chainsaw faster and all that. gets stunned and looped pretty well.
---
Nurse: doesn't even need add-ons. with or without them still always loopable and mindgameable.
---
Huntress: just Iridescent Heads only op add-on, renders max hatchets you can carry to 3 with another add-on. just dodge the damn hatchets!
---
Michael: has to work for [infinite] tier III/tombstone. Scratched Mirror only viable on Lery's.
---
Hag: you still can see her traps if she uses Shackles. with Mint Rag she's limited with amount of traps she can set in order to not mess up teleportation. 
---
Bubba: lol. I love Bubba but he doesn't really have anything. fast chainsaw? meh.
---
Doctor: his power is in his terror radius. even Iridescent King is not that good if you don't know how to end loops.
---
Fred: well, arguably his best add-on is Class Photo. yeah, he'll be busy keeping people in Dream most of the time, but to downing them he still doesn't have help in chase. 
---
Pig: nothing op. literally nothing good. the aura reading add-on not big of a help unless Lery's and Game. still has a bunch of counters. 
---
Clown: only Pinky Finger is good. you gotta have nice aim and time it right to do real damage. 
---
Rin: Beads are nasty. but still have counters: Spine Chill, Premonition. paying attention helps a bunch. 
---
Frank's Mixtape you can't get away from. you'll either get your mend timer down if Legion looking down/moonwalking or you'll get down as soon as Frenzy gets bit up and the distance enough for final hit. it's the most op thing and it has no counter. not time, not experience, no perks will help you against it. 
---
this isn't normal. everything must have counter or it's a disbalance. 
---
Real talk. Can we discuss those names your team had. 
---
How...how am I backing down? You are following suit as you normally do with your massive "intelligence". 
---
Got a big boi with a leatherface IQ over here.
---
It's ridiculous they even sent voice recordings of how they're gonna report me and they sound like they're shaking in their voice cos they didn't win. Like jesus christ grow up |:
---
I am. Rank 1. 
---
Sorry, what was that second one you said? I feel like you glazed over something quite horrifying there.
---
It is because people are more interested in a funny joke than a concept that will most likely never make it into the game.
---
Thx 
---
Well, you got 2 choices here buddy. Loosen up, or complain forever. Like I said, its not like the totems are always the easiest things to find. And every perk can be countered.
---
Im just offering solutions for the meanwhile, you dont to be a jerk about it.
---
I'm sorry but if you have to resort to facecamping a survivor, you've already lost in my eyes. It shows that the player has gotten under your skin. The best way to rub salt into a wound is to be better then them in the game. 
---
it's not hard unless full well coordinated swf or some looping God. 
---
You do realise that Legion’s power is mostly supposed to be a time waster? The idea is that you smack someone with Frenzy, stab others if they are around and chase the last person you stabbed. Survivors have to mend and the heal themselves if they want to avoid getting downed by a normal hit.
---
Wait what. XD
---
that :D came here to say that. Michael is fine, Doc gets too op on small map
---
This should be in monthly rituals
---
Yes they stack.
---
You point would be valid 11 months ago, that times almost everyone play with self-heal. But did you considered the point that healing time was nerfed to 16 sec? (12 sec was before spirit patch iirc) with this you need 32 sec to heal yourself with the perks (up from 24 sec, 8 sec diff) it may sound like notthing but it is A lot for survivor. 
---
Right now the number of survivor run self-heal had been lowed, I know it still may bug you but if you think about it , you prolong the game more if survivors run self-heal. (Also they lost one perks just for that).
---
It is not as much as powerful like before.
---
Oh, well when somebody says garbage I assume they mean they're bad, as in weak. I agree with your points though, feels like getting a Legion is just a forced annoying match for 15 mins until you lose.
---
&gt;Also, remove NOED
---
Also, remove DS
---
Y'all are some good teammates though. I love playing with the helpful type.
---
Lol, no.
---
this time he’s purple
---
The DS nerf that we needed lol
---
Do they have a support page or something I can contact? 
---
They can't hit a skill check if you turn their game into a slide show
---
The tragic part is you can see them all trying so hard to tell her to go to a box.
---
Sure, I don't use it.
---
I on't really have an issue with it because I'm not a shit killer. I just catch them again.
---
Buffing self care to maker legion more viable is an indirect buff to all killers. Putting Legion as the new standard of “balanced” by merging self care just makes the really good killers even better.
---
I brought in a purple Medkit for some super altruistic we’ll make it heals and I shit you not no one got hooked that game, we’re on the final stretch out the gate and this bastard knocks the shit out of my hands by the gate when I took a hit for a teammate on borrowed time. I look back and he’s just staring at it on the ground. I weighed my options and having brought in a white ward safe to say there was no way to procure the item.. 
---
...what
---
You're moaning about, looping, objectives, people playing with their friends and ingame perks.
---
omg lol. This can't be real
---
I understand what you mean! But, I find that the maps he struggles on are the same maps that like 90% of other killers struggle on. And from there, he’s often the best of them. I’ll admit that unlike Nurse and Legion, he *does* have to deal with bad maps, but I don’t think that changes how OP he is compared to other killers. 
---
You can’t be banned for using perks in the game. 
---
h e c c
---
Skinned David implies he has had his skin removed. That is a weirdly horrifying skin to suggest.
---
The other 4 stones should be: Left behind, Sole survivor, Object of obsession and Lightweight
---
But those solutions aren’t good. You’re suggesting Thanataphobia, a pretty trash perk, over Ruin if we don’t like totems being destroyed before we can even move 2 inches. I already suggested a fix, make totems spawn away from survivors. It isn’t rocket science and it’s not that hard to implement. 
---
Totems are pretty easy to spot. It’s a flaming skull that makes burning sounds. The only map that’s good for hiding totems in the Meat Plant and that’s about it. I’m not being a jerk, I’m telling you why Thanata isn’t a viable alternative to Ruin. 
---
I get instant survivor queues at red ranks here in the UK. At peak times my killer ques are also a few minutes at worst. It's all good. 
---
*May IIIIIIIII*
---
*Stand unshaken*
---
Ironic. Instead of disputing the fact that he's acting like a stereotypical survivor main, he continues on the offensive. Very clever.
---
Do you want matches to last 30 mins+? because I commonly get 20+min matches with gen speeds as is. This is at red ranks and quite common on PC. 
---
Killer shouldn't be told how to play but if they play in a way that is almost completely unplayable(tunnel/camp) then why should we stay in your match when we can just DC?
---
Some people are making the suggestion that you swap everything about billy’s and leatherface’s abilities except for the ability itself. The way they charge, the stun time for running into objects, etc.
---
8=====0~~~~
---
I'll take a smack after the mori just for the extra bit of BM to my teammate :)
---
Personally I don’t think it’s that big of a deal. Hit survivors, and keep following them. Don’t slug (unless it’s obvious survivors won’t get picked up). Run  sloppy butcher. Run nurses calling (helps you look for players after they get off hook). 
---
If a survivor was hit by you and managed to escape for long enough to heal, they outplayed you and probably deserve to heal. 
---
Am I supposed to care about being called a survivor main??
---
A very similar scenario happen to 2 of my friends on Yamaoka. They went to heal in a corner and both of them got stuck for basically the rest of the game.
---
Had this issue when i spawned in one time, couldn't move, emoted i couldnt move an let killer kill me
---
&gt; Intimidation?
---
&gt;what the fuck are you talking about you fucking dork
---
&gt; i'm just pointing out how poorly your delusional comment aged
---
Woah, put that edge away, you dont need decisive strike here. 
---
You honestly just sound like a trash killer with 20hours in the game that thinks your opinion actually matters
---
Because then everyone would steal your items. 
---
Oh I like this! I’d definitely say that Leatherface should keep his tantrum though. It’s kind of a big part of his character haha. 
---
I'll have what he's having
---
I think you missed the point where I said "stereotypical." Or you just didn't care because you're a survivor main and you're entitled to not have to read the entire statement. Either way, congratulations. You're making every survivor look better by comparison. 
---
That shit be funny as fuck, even when it happens to me. My sister did it to me in SWF and I cracked my fucking spine laughing. LOL
---
Jack the Ripper 
---
They do right now, but get trash too  
---
At least they will be getting good items now  
---
I am talking mostly about the "discover good items with addons" part of the perk, not the aura reading
---
Here's an idea: why not just put it on an actual head? 
---
I like how the david inspects her dead body with his flashlight 
---
No Correlation Detected 
---
Here we see the wild Claudette's in their natural habitat. These adolescents have yet to develop the bloody red facial markings characteristic of their kind. Having lost their mother, they seem to have imprinted upon the killer, like ducklings imprinting on a chicken hawk.
---
In my many hours I have met no nice Claudette.
---
I don’t know much about high rank killer que but I always get fast ques as a rank 1 survivor. And decent wait time as a level 12 killer. But I have heard the wait is bad for killers at red rank for some reason. 
---
Good one :)
---
Killers host the game. Therefore are usually in the game longer. Survivors can turn around matches quicker than killer. So for every 3/4 games a killer plays an hour a survivor can prob play 5/6 games etc. 
---
Numbers are made up. But what I'm saying is games over time (killer or survivor) the bloodpoints gains should be fairly even when you factor all this in. 
---
I wouldn't call Survivors salty.
---
We killers can be salty AF.
---
~~They're toxic af though~~
---
Wait a second... you used the word civil... CIVILian... civilians who survive wars are called... SURVIVORS. GET OUTTA HERE YOU FILTHY SURVIVOR MAIN UR SO TOXIC OMG
---
Why be so rude?
---
Thats a mix of problems.
---
The first, your ps4 dude. Its ducked go get it cleaned.
---
Secondly, dont play dead by daylight after starting up in rest mode it just tortures the system....
---
Have fun!!
---
It buys more time depending on well its used. Saying that dead hard only buys 5 seconds max is just stupid lol. If you chain it into a vault or pallet, often the only reason you needed to dead hard was to reach a new area of pallets, and that dead hard lets you use the new loops.
---
I like you. A Killer but a self-aware Killer.
---
I only got salty when I keep getting blinded by an entire team of Claudettes Everytime I pick up someone to put them on a hook
---
I got chu fam
---
The game crashes unless I put it rest mode at the start 
---
Same and I was so pissed
---
pallet stuns and looping are just survivors stuff, without that is practically impossible to survive. teabag is not a survivors stuff, and this kind of "trolling" needs to be punish. and so the other way around: if killer camp without reason (like "he looped me for 4 gens so i camp"), he need a punishment (ex. trolling at the exit) 
---
im agree with teabag and facecamp only for "defence", not for "attack" (if you know what i mean).
---
maybe im wrong, personally i teabag only if killer tunneled me for a good part of the match or facecamped me for no reason. this is how I see it
---
How do you find pallet stuns &amp; looping annoying? It's a strategy and probably the only one for survivors to escape the killer successfully.
---
Not meaning to be a dick btw, in case you read it like that.
---
Try the first thing i mentioned, 
---
if my launch ps4 can run it, be it with a clean fan, im sure the pro can run it with a clean fan no problemo
---
That’s odd seeing how the spirit is probably inspired by a concept known as “the mannequin”
---
Yeah, after posting this, I realized that it would probably be closer to Hex: Ruin than Blood Warden, but still. At the time, nerfing Self Care again was the best way I could think of to make Legion viable without an entire overhaul. I did, after reading all of the feedback, come up with what I think is a balanced change that leaves Legion's kit the same as it is at the core. If you're interested in giving feedback, the thread is here:

---
You know, plenty of killer mains downvoted you too. me being one of them. Don't assume tribalism is the result of a bad suggestion being downvoted.
---
It’s a laggy mess. The frame rate doesn’t help
---
So context, I literally spawned in the tree: https://clips.twitch.tv/RenownedBombasticSheepTBCheesePull
---
I decided I'd stay up there until a survivor found me, then OP clip happened!
---
Nice. Know you will realize that rank doesn't mean anything and you will get rank 1 every month only to slowly realize you don't enjoy the game anymore.
---
Fair. I kind of expect it with this community. They tend to have a hardon for downvoting anything. Which is why I don't let it get in the way of me continuing to post here. 
---
purple mists dont stack
---
Oh my bad didn’t even realize then yes she probably would have lived if she kept running 
---
Unless you main huntress and yeet hatchets across the map. It doesn't work often but when it does it feels sooooooo good.
---
Hilarious, coincidentally today was the first time my party actually completed that gen in a month of playing (we avoided it due to its location).
---
Needless to say we'll never repair that gen ever :))
---
That might be it.  Testing
---
The whole point of totem spawns is that they're at random points around the map, if the survivors use a offering to spawn all together and the farthest away from the killer, they'll just run to the other side and destroy them all because totem locations would be more consistent that way.
---
 You're not offering any good solutions either buddy. The only "Solution" for this is removing the hex part.
---
Plus its not like he was asking for solutions, I was just suggesting an alternative.
---
I would just add more totem locations to help with this.
---
I’m trying that one. Pretty clever to save the shocks for after some kills are secured.
---
I don't see it as a problem necessarily. All the perk negation exploits come with their own set of downsides. Juggling a survivor takes a bunch of extra time to get just a little bit of extra distance, leaves you vulnerable to getting flash stunned multiple times and will need to be done every single time you want to try and negate DS. Similarly, gen tapping is much slower than just working on it legitimately. If the survivors are gen tapping, then Ruin is doing it's job of slowing down the game as it is intended to anyway.
---
Duck move by you to intentionally alert the killer to the presence of your teammates though. That is a bannable offense to work with the killer.
---
They should really reconsider because he’s a great character. 
---
"Correct me if I am wrong"
---
Sure, his base movmentspeed is 4.4 m/s aka 110% and in Frenzy it goes up to 132 % aka 5.28 m/s.

You can’t vault a pallet if you get stunned, it kicks you out of Frenzy. 
---
It's sadly not avoidable
---
Well, then you're out of luck. Every skin of Legion has their face, because BHVR modeled them fully. They just didn't include a mask free option to see it. But data miners have already shown us what they look like, which is why everyone wants the mask free option.
---
2 posts prove it, when there are countless posts talking about how looping is “toxic”. Nice selective listening. 
---
Lmao okay my guy. Talk about toxicity 🧐
---
What makes you think you're being dodged?
---
Equasion is the following: amount of living survivors &lt; amount of generators done
---
If you started with 4 survivors:
---
5 gens left =&gt; no hatch
---
4 gens left =&gt; no hatch
---
3 gens left =&gt; hatch spawns with 1 survivor left
---
2 gens left =&gt; hatch spawns with 2 survivors left
---
1 gen left =&gt; hatch spawns with 3 survivors left
---
0 gens left =&gt; hatch spawns
---
If you started with 3 survivors:
---
3 gens left =&gt; no hatch
---
2 gens left =&gt; hatch spawns with 1 survivor left
---
1 gen left =&gt; hatch spawns with 2 survivors left
---
If you started with 2 survivors:
---
2 gens left =&gt; no hatch
---
1 gen left =&gt; hatch spawns with 1 survivor left
---
If you started alone:
---
1 gen left =&gt; no hatch
---
I realise this was probably more than you needed, but I tought since you asked, I'd just be as clear as possible and mention the requirements for every possible match. As you can probably see, a 1v1 situation is pretty much impossible to win.
---
the fucking irony lmao
---
Spies from the shadows isn’t good 
---
What a useless response lmao. I don’t have to white knight for her just because I enjoy the stream. As someone who almost only plays killer, my opinion is that y’all are fucking stupid and whine too much. 
---
Spirit Fury, because it doesn't announce itself.
---
To help separate the guys who know everything from the ones still learning. Game would die quickly if every brand new player went up against the 1,000+ hour players from the start.
---
Just because it’s the main strat doesn’t mean it’s not annoying. I don’t get mad when a pallet lands on my head, I know that’s what they’re supposed to do, but it’s still frustrating. 
---
Well thanks! Means a lot
---
oof ouch owie my offerings
---
people actually complained about that? Wow that's pathetic, I would love for even just 1 day where the sub isn't flooded with memes if just to get decent discussion going for just a little bit of time.
---
Are any of them upvoted? No? Then shut up.
---
I guess, but have you ever solo queued with one gen left and was getting tunneled by the killer?
---
At this point its clear the killers are the victims in this, the survivors are the despicable enemies. 
---
2 gens done =&gt; hatch only exists if there is one survivor left, if there are more, the hatch doesn't exist
---
3 gens done =&gt; hatch exists with 2 people left but only opens with key or when one of them dies
---
Itemless and solo helps
---
No, one person left mean only 2 gens need to be done
---
I play huntress a lot. Pallet stuns are less annoying as they don’t really happen to me when I’m playing her but looping actually sucks because she’s so slow, and whenever I bring up a hatchet they just duck and I can’t really hit them. 
---
I’m rank 2 but sure thanks for the anecdotal explanation.  
---
Just stay back a bit so you can see which way they are going. 
---
*Meat Plant against Doc with Distressing, dual Calm add-ons, and Unnerving Presence.
---
You have two different attack types, a long range lunge, and a close range auto aim attack. the auto aim attack is more difficult to dodge since it has a wider attack arc and automatically can turn your killer to some degree. If you find yourself getting regularly dodged, try using the quick attack more to see if it helps. Unfortunately, a perfectly pulled off 360 dodge will avoid the attack literally no matter what you do as a killer, so you can only play the percentage game.
---
Any tips on editing skills would be appreciated ;p
---
also ideas for episode 274
---
What’s up with all these mafia wars memes
---
Honestly I won't facecamp but I'll stick within hatchet range and only if its a swf group that wants to body block and flashlight me at every hook.... One of you is dying. Idc who and idc about BP at that point. 
---
Its already 4 against one and you all are talking, which is practically cheating.
---
Y'all wonder why you can't find killers in the lobby or we DC in the lobby.
---
Shit some people never play killer again or worse brand new players don't play the game again.
---
Lot of you swf don't have a right to bitch. You're just shooting yourselves in the foot 
---
Its not like the entity is helping killers much lol 😆
---
It's not because it's the best course of action that it isn't camping, it still is, however, this is the best course of action. It's like getting mad that in a FPS where one team needs to attack and the other team needs to defend that the attackers get angry at the defenders for defending the point. The attackers can't expect the defenders to just give up the point without a fight just like the survivors shouldn't expect the killer to give them a free unhook.
---
&gt;That's not camping
---
It is camping
---
&gt;camping isnt bannable. Just ignore them 
---
Totaly agree, camping was the best course of action on this situation and it isn't bannable
---
when you see a single killer trying to prove otherwise but he is wrong *cough* u/AnklePickbro *cough*
---
Really nitpicky here, but I don’t really think that they’re ‘iconic’ at all. 
---
To be iconic it has to be rather well-known, and it’s usually been around for a decent period of time. I’d say that Myers has an iconic mask, I’d say that Scream (is that the name? Whatever, the killer’s name from that series is) has an iconic mask. I do not think legion meets that criteria. 
---
He is very boring to play against in my opinion. No counter play at all. 
---
Somehow it only happens when someone brings a bps
---
It's still camping, but yeah, this is what he should have done in this situation, there is no point in looking for survivors elsewhere when you know that they are all right next to you. I'm not saying he is in the wrong. Camping is just commonly seen as a bad thing to do, but it's the same as defending a control point in FPS, you are also camping, doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.
---
I READ THIS AS A KILLER EQUIPPED A MORI😭
---
I personally can’t stand it, bc the players who use it are generally ones who t-bag and flicker their flashlights at you all game. It’s a crutch to rely on, just like noed. They don’t really have to worry about going down the first time bc of the perk. Still waiting on that d strike change that was announced months ago. 
---
It would be interesting to see DS have criteria similar to deliverance. Like the survivor has to land a pallet stun or last in a chase for a certain period of time. Still achievable, but offering the killer a way to counter the perk. 
---
Also I feel that only one survivor should have the perk in any trial. If you aren’t the obsession the perk should switch to a backup perk. 
---
And he has a green kazoo..
---
I don’t understand. 
---
For some reason my comment was removed by "user" when I didn't delete either of my 2 comments. 
---
Doesn't matter how you play killer but how you do it defines your own experience in terms of survivors staying to "play the game" you want it to be played.
---
Fine you win
---
Yes please.
---
Nerf this, nerf that. People will just find something new to complain about. Personally I don't use it because I can't hit it. Would rather have a perk that benefits me more than once anyways. As a killer it can be irritating but usually buys the survivor an extra 10 seconds if that.
---
Now were talking
---
I agree, I think a balanced way to nerd ds would be to make it pop at 5 seconds instead of 3, I’ve done some testing with the timing and at 5 seconds if the survivor plays right it’s still usable (utilizing dead zones jungle gyms teammates body blocking etc)
---
Nobody told the bloodweb, apparently. I got a million Murky Reagents on my Pig and counting :—)
---
*saves 2 people with flashlight* *killer camps + tunnels the whole game*
---
Episode 274 coming out later in 2032.
---
That feeling when you have Franklin's and more than 1 survivor last-second swaps to a flashlight. 
---
This sounds like a great idea imo I think if more than one person has it the wiggle should be drastically increased like 80/70/60 (around there)
---
That's unfortunate, perhaps you could find a used console for cheap in an area I presume has auric cells available? Ps4 and xbox ones are fairly cheap now.
---
That's what I was thinking as well as a survivor perk that reveals the aura of nearby totems
---
