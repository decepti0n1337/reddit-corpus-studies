Not in the current system, but the new one you should be able to. When you buy a perk the other is always consumed at the moment.

Allways good to see crossovers from r/shitpostcrusaders

---
You can’t say he balanced and that he needs a nerf in the same sentence. Those statements are completely contradictory.
---
I honestly wish that our prestige stuff could go on other cosmetics not just the default skin
---
This is going to sound like a smartass answer but it really isn’t: It’s to make sure the build hasn’t introduced any bugs that might affect BP gains or purchasing perks normally.

You can also rotate the camera by moving your mouse, in order to see the killer better. 
---

---
Please god just look behind you
---
Haha, because every jungle gym is a basic circle with no bumps or windows or other entrances. Just a pallet and giant circle. I could say killer is just holding w and pressing m1 when close to the survivor on loops. If they throw pallet, press space. Youre simplifying the actual skill it requires to loop, so please shutup you donkey licking peice of shit
---
I feel like it's quite balanced for surv and killer. Almost every loop is unsafe, but there are pallets practically everywhere
---
In my experience if you always buy the cheapest possible path on every web, I have gotten to exactly level 39 more than 10 times without fail. If you buy some of the more expensive stuff you’ll get to 35-38
---
Yes. Someone being a dick and going out of their way to taunt you *is* toxic.
---
I want a scary movie chapter that only has cindy as a survivor.
---
I don’t get why people are downvoting you. You had some extra time, so you got p3 on the test build. I’m sure you’re more than happy to do it again on live.
---
My opinion is that their should be a totem counter, as well as a couple more perks added related to dull totems, that way the totems are more of an “objective, and less of a tedious task meant to counter one perk that the killer might possibly have.
---
Yeah. I think looping is a stupid mechanic just because of how obnoxious it is, but it’s still necessary for the game to work. If I play against Survivors that aren’t looping than I can guarantee there is a very good chance that I am going to sacrifice them all because chases end so quickly. If they had something more interesting to replace looping, I would be all for it, but gave survivors a similar level of safety if they played well, I would be all for it.
---
Sadly that would get the game banned in China.
---
Some sort of Dracula character would be super neat aswell
---
You guess off of feedback. Spirit has no feedback. Huntress is a good example of a healthy mindgames. She either winds up at a pallet and you drop, you get hit. If you decide to loop again and she doesn't pull her hatchet, you get hit. However, if she winds up and you don't drop the pallet, you get another loop. If she doesn't wind up and you drop the pallet, you get the crucial stun. There are examples of healthy guessing, Spirit is not one of them.
---
I was lucky the second time but lunges like the first one consistently happen to me, am I doing something wrong or?
---
I guess you hit its sweet spot
---
Mori: exists

Survivor mains: It'S bRoKeN aNd UnFaIr
---
See how dumb your argument is when it's an OP killer offering in the same place? Face it, both Ivory/Green moris and Skeleton/Dull keys give killers/survivors wins they don't deserve whatsoever.
---
tunnel isbt toxic my Dude....
---
Mad at killers for doing the objective, rofl
---
When backed by party chat it's unbeatable though
---
Same with Sloppy Butcher. IIRC doesn't Sloppy Butcher still work on huntress hatchets?
---
Piggy can't instadown exposed survivors with her power. Her bear traps no longer stop people from leaving the map.
---
Franklin's demise doesn't work with her Dash.
---
And to top it off she growls before she even begins to Lunge.
---
Devs *"lEtS nErF tHe PiG"*
---
It's a new killer with a new power. Remember how busted nurse was back in the day? Likely a similar case.
---
Nothing is better than when you genuinely get jump scared in dbd
---
Lol I agree. Usually I'm happy to have a nurse if I'm playing with a friend that's lower rank than me because I feel I have a chance, but red ranks, nope, PS4 or otherwise, she's still a terror
---
Gotta have that alliteration, though.
---
I would think so since there hasn't been any update to fix it yet.
---
Half of the killers are 10 times worse on console unfortunately
---
Very true
---
Judging by the reddit age of OP and both of you're grammer, I'm gonna have to say that you made a second account and posted this half assed facebook meme...
---
Looks like the hatches was far and it still hit.
---
Ooooooooo noooooooo the bad man bounced up and down a lot

Both of. You're grammer. When your when your don't have good friend u can relate to on a literal level that's sad your sad haha noob.
---
Well I believe the demogorgon has a new hit registration or cone meaning it unique which means it's gonna be really buggy
---
This perk essentially turns survivors into people who don't wanna be seen at the mall.
---
"He's speaking the language of gods"
---
Yep and your peasant bad.
---
Don't think it is a bug, I think his pounce is not considered a basic attack, and just like the pigs ambush, you don't lose stacks of stbfl when hittin obsession, but you don't gain any either
---
Silly David
---
This format combined with spelling errors. Truly a shitpost to behold
---
Prediction is just guessing but with skill
---
I want to emphasize on him saying you'll meet nice people, please try not to form too heavy of opinions based off of what you see on reddit. A lot of people here complain about toxicity but honestly it's not too bad. You will meet a lot of nice people like that guy said. Most people I run into are really nice
---
I feel no one does gens because they wanna be chased by the demogorgon or want to see what the map looks like. It is killer sided for the most part besides the broken loop with 3 pallets and the really strong window.
---
What?
---
If killers need a crutch to walk... then we need to fix their legs. Nerf gen speeds somehow, then we can nerf ruin.
---
Slugging is fine, it's a valid straight, it's more when everyone is down and the killer refuses to hook when he's just being a dick
---
Yeah they'll learn to run BT and Decisive and then you'll bitch that they're OP perks
---
I have no clue, red ranks killer main here and I'll tell ya slugging is basically the only way to win a game without ruin.
---
You're just willingly choosing to be ignorant. Spirits feedback is her literally standing still. It is the equivalent of Huntress holding her hatchet, Nurse holding out her hand, Trapper bending over to put a trap down, etc. It is, and its ridiculous that we gotta argue about it. I don't know how you can lay out all the options for me regarding Huntress in a loop, but you fail to realize that you also have options in a chase with a Spirit. I hate making assumptions but I can only assume you've been having really bad luck with high rank Spirits lately, and that's why you feel the need to deny everything I've been saying, even though its actually undeniable.
---
I like the new SURVIVOR perks, killer perks? Not so much
---
Im in game rn
---
A good killer breaks chase. I honestly dgaf about ingame pride that concept is just dumb.
---
I love that somehow being able to loop the killer for 5 gens isn't a problem...  
---
  
---
That's perfect game balance right there, it's the KILLER'S fault for being looped! What was the killer wearing, they were probably asking for it.
---
By that logic if you don't wanna die then don't get hooked, it's that simple man
---
You mean stops being easy. Its still fun for me n ima 3
---
*you're... if I got a damn nickel for everytime you spelt that word wrong I'd be a millionaire by now!
---
Nice.
---
Exactly, it really is that simple. I’m glad someone else gets it.
---
Good job Luigi, do it again.
---
People like you are why I don't rank up
---
Also repost big pog
---
Maybe for the survivor, but there are killers that enjoy the hyper defensive style. Or enjoy the salt it brings, at least. That's why Insidious Basement Bubba exists despite how bad it is
---
And the devs said you would have some control over it towards the end, that's why you can't juke it properly
---
YOU DONT GET POINTS FOR BAGGING AT THE EXIT CUNTS
---
lol it's honestly not that serious to me.
---
The problem I have with the game is no matter who I'm chasing the other 3 are on a gen and know exactly when I'm coming for them because swf is overpowered
---
I was being sarcastic.
---
I think that's a very good point.  For consistency, Bubba should be changed to The Leather Face.
---
Honestly though, he's called The Ghost Face because BHVR didn't get the license for Scream, they got the license for the mask and evidently the mask is called the Ghost Face, so that's what they're forced to use.
---
when jake is the mom
---
It's almost definitely the terms of the licence. It'll be fine, no player will call him that. How often do you hear "the nightmare" or "the shape"
---
My mains have gone Tapp&gt;Quentin&gt;Ash each time I changed mains my entire play style changed too, Ash I make the most awesome plays and the dumbest, idk it's just the character
---
I was too.
---
also watermarking stolen memes pog
---
That sounds dope
---
I hate the internet so much. Can never tell who is and isn't being sarcastic.
---
Real life? It's obvious. On the internet? You don't know who's being sarcastic and who's being serious.
---
Thats what noed does.
---
But your don't because your'r'e baad.
---
I would love that
---
Huntress can do two things when she has her hatchet - throw it or put it away which she suffers a slowdown. Nurse can only blink. Trapper is... I don't even need to explain this. It really is ridiculous you're arguing, because you think that standing still is viable feedback when SHE GIVES NO INDICATION WHEN SHE GOES INTO HER PHASE. Literally every Killer has a tell when using their power. Standing still isn't a tell, because she can stand still WITHOUT USING HER POWER AND READ YOU ACCORDINGLY AND YOU CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.
---
I have to believe you are either terrible with Spirit or you haven't face a good Spirit. You can say it's undeniable all you want, doesn't make it actually undeniable. She has no viable counterplay, and all you can do is hope she's bad. If she's good, you lose. Doesn't matter your skill.
---
*Gets cleansed just before you hook someone*

My goodness that man was goofy. Good prediction though.

---
The Entity has chosen his favorite
---
It wasn't all game. I followed him for a few gens.
---
I wish the survivors would just leave instead of mocking me for being a crap killer...
---
it was really obvious he was going along with your joke heh
---
Hey I came from For honor too! I was a toe stabbing glad main
---
You shouldn’t be able to get hit if you’re behind a wall though
---
Sorry, I don't read social media. My mistake.
---
And no one saved him. I think it was pretty obvious he'd be pissed from the game.
---
I was hoping they saw this and posted theirs

The demon
---
Michael was a normal man, had a wife  kids, a good job, as native American man,  he believed in raising the dead as his culture believes. It all came crashing down when his son was KIA (Killed in Action) by his best friend as Michael took his father's only job option so he pretended to like them. This sent him into a deep depression, and a knock at the door woke him from his sleep. He awnsered it, it was the killer's father. Michael almost slammed the door til he saw some thing. It glinted in the moonlight, it was a pistol. On instinct he attempted to disarm him but was met with a bullet in his gut and fell to the floor. He screamed, waking his wife who entered  and was gunned down immediately. This filled Michael with rage, the adrenaline blocking the pain, he took his pocket knife and stabbed the man in the chest. He was stunned and fell back, yelling in pain. Michael ran to his gun room but at the doorway, he fell shots in his legs. He crawled for a gun but the shooter stepped on him, stopping him from crawling.  * bang, bang* Michael saw a white light,  a voice whispered to him promising  blood. A deal was struck.
---
Power "raise the dead"
---
What it does: when placed , it sends a scan for any survivors, if one is in a 15 meter radius it will scream, making a audio cue for the killer and it will disappear ( can be destroyed by flashlights) killer gets 3 of these.
---
Perks: never dead: a survivor that triggers a spirit will have their aura revealed for 2/4/6 seconds
---
No escape: a sprit that has been triggered will follow a survivor for 2/3/4 seconds and will have a aura
---
You can't run: a survivor that has triggered a spirit will lose the ability to vault for 2/4/5 seconds
---
Hope you like, gave a lot of thought to this  please let me know if this killer seems op and present a change for him
---
They should add the persona 4 killer to dbd 🤔
---
Lmao, where from hell did he come from?
---
WHAT ABOUT STEVE AND NANCY
---
Freddy was acaullty posted, Ghostface as buffed, Plague was nerfed. Yes i can deny it because it doesnt happen as mcuh as people like to say
---
No. Your point doesnt stand
---
That's just reddit in general tbf.  If you want to actually talk about stuff you'll need to go to a certain Indonesian wood carving board.
---
More like "let me eat that ass, Spirit"
---
she thicc
---
Ok fair points guess I was wrong. Then would saying they crack under pressure from one side be better?
---
I pride myself in being a fair killer. I don't chase those recently unhooked, I don't camp (proxy or face). I give respect to people who fairly beat me. 
---
I guess I just get bummed when I get called something I was not. But yeah, he probably was just mad about that. Thanks, shirtless David.
---
The method is surprisingly simple, but first, we need to talk about parallel universes. In order to travel to another realm and kill 4 more survivors, you have to build up speed on the Coal Tower staircase for 12 hours, and then as the last survivor is escaping or being sacrificed, you have to perform 0.5 bell rings at the large second floor window at the right angle to travel 4 QPUs north of the original Coal Tower. This new Coal Tower is different, because there are 4 survivors and 0 killers inside of it, allowing you to repeat the process indefinitely.
---
dude I haven't seen one person complaining about Demo on Reddit OR the PTB. The ONLY complaining i see is people complaining about other people complaining.
---
What I love most about this clip? If you listen closely while she’s swearing, you can hear the director yell “Michelle!” because she was blowing the mic out so hard. It means they thought they were going to throw out the take.
---
They do yes, but they dont nerf everything. I mean, rembmer how bad Ghostface was then how good he was?
---
Yeah the real strength of the lunge is the mindgame potential.  Going to take that vault?  ARE YOU SUUUUURE ABOUT THAT?
---
Think you should level up everyone else for their teachables then at the end switch to ace. Ace has like, really soft groans. It's like a built in iron will at times I swear
---
fuck me... i said to myself "this is either going to be a myers or a ghostface they get me every time" and even knowing it still got me lmao
---
Just mind game them
---
If everyone is at the gate then yes. Otherwise it's smart to not leave yet in case someone needs help getting out. There have been dozena of times where everyone except me and one other guy in the map left immediately. Then they get hooked and they'd be screwed if I had left with the other two.
---
No it ain’t
---
Demolition Medusa
---
I agree with this, its one of the first things I thought of when he came out. ( They also could call him the Ghost, the Mask and the Anonymous )
---
Posted this three times, you did.
---
It really does. I used to like the character and playing against her. Now I dread it.
---
When someone does that to me, the goal shifts to tunneling that fuck and face camping the shit out of them. Fuck the gens. I get way more enjoyment out of making a taunter dc or die than I do winning that round and watching them live to talk shit in lobby.
---
I play on pc and when you got the end game chat in front of you if you wernt the nicest killer in the fuckin world you will be told by every god damn survivor on the team
---
this is 100% correct. crazy you're not being hit by the massive down vote train of "iM the KiLLeR bRo iM sUpPosED tO kILL" mains. Ironic too because a majority killer mains who cry, bitch and moan about people using meta perks on a survivor **are the exact reason** survivors have to use meta perks in the first place is to counter shitty (and extremely rampant) killer playstyles. Borrowed time to counter face camping, Decisive Strike to counter tunneling, Dead Hard to counter blood lust because they just want to hold W, adrenaline to counter excessively slow healing time nerf. If the killers instead played smart, apply spread pressure and knew what gens to prevent from getting done and pay attention to, the game will snowball insanely fast and you'll ensure a 4K over time. Instead they just want to chase 1 person for three hooks, NOED everyone else and call it "strategy".
---
Yeah this game is definitely super toxic. I suggest either just blocking people from messaging you (if you’re on console) or leaving the lobby right after the game finishes to avoid lobby chat.
---
Quit sticking up for the salty ass loser. Seriously man, what’s wrong with you.
---
I never questioned your ability to play as killer and I know you meant well, but different perspectives, I guess. It's easy to misinterpret someone's intention in DBD because there isn't much to communicate with the opposite side.
---
Yea good point you win. I think I was trying to say they crack under pressure and that could happen to the demogorgon instead of saying they nerf alot because they actually do some good also like make Freddy and Ghostface great and the demogorgon but that can change

---
Legion is bottom tier, sadly
---
Yeah but u can't get em if u have the killer i think so..
---
And if u can why is that even a thing ?
---
Remember that next time you get face camped and cry in lobby.
---
I know you didn't. I appreciate your level-headedness.
---
I can't even read what Patrick said.
---
I wont blame a killer for tunneling me if I'm farmed. It's my teams fault and they're just playing the game, but when a killer doesnt tunnel me it feels fantastic
---
I had that happen but they were all pizza Dwight I got destroyed it was a depressing game :(
---
"Hello there."
---
my gf does this when we play and she's like I think we are gonna go against a hag this game and what do you know its a hag I get so confused when she does it so many times
---
Are we including their Abilities also? Because if so half of the killers would be hard  to fight against or run from. If we're including Abilities I'd say Ghostface as he preys on unaware victims and I'm pretty aware so I'd atleast have a chance but if we aren't including Abilities probably hag she seems weak and easy to kill
---
Yeah i thought that too, its devs fault for using the wraiths weapon as the icon 🤣
---
That's you're problem. It really isnt necessary for any killer, this is coming from someone who mained freddy before he was considered "good" by the community, and someone who has mained legion a bit too. You won't ever get good enough to handle yourself if you feel noed is necessary.
---
The problem isn't the hint, it's that it was a probably baby Claudette.
---
Yeah. I think I’ll use her default hair with this shirt and jeans.
---
Nah people have made topics in this very subreddit calling looping toxic/op/broken etc even after all the nerfs to pallets and removed infinites.

I’m glad I’m not the only one, yeah it confused the shit out of me a few weeks ago, I even checked the wiki to see if it was changed somehow lol

Ive always thought about it without abilities, just the killer vs yourself, like if you are walking down the street at night, who would you prefer to encounter
---
I always thought it was a teachable too but the devs just got lazy I guess and used Wraiths weapon for the perk icon

Uh, let's see, you don't need pallets, you don't need windows, and she can't cancel blinks.

Survivor can only leave with the trap on if it’s not activated so if they’re leaving with the trap on it’s your problem for putting it after the gens are done
---
Well, then the solution is simple, isn't it? Although I doubt you could understand simple.
---
Question: is this new perk going to make Iron Maiden meta now?
---
Happened to me on PS4 earlier today. Missed a ruin skillcheck and the gen reset to zero, stopped moving, then immediately went back to normal.
---
Since I play both killer and survivor I will say this is true.  I’ve seen survivors message me trying to get the killer reported just because they wouldn’t let their friend in their swf group live.
---
Displeased with you, Allah is.
---
Run over minorities in 2001 Honda Civic you must.
---
Needed to regain Allah’s favor, it is.
---
You're an idiot or a really shit Killer if you think stealth is viable throughout the entire game. Or both. You will be chased, and her chases are broken. Try again :)
---
They don't need a crutch to walk. Yet they still get one with Ruin, which is the problem.
---
this is incorrect if we're not including survivors being toxic to other survivors (what I assume you meant)
---
survivors:
---
* can t-bag (doesn't do anything to the killer)
---
* flashlight click (doesn't do anything to the killer)
---
* point or come here emote (doesn't do anything to the killer)
---
* disconnect (can make the killer depip but most likely win them the game and pip anyway)
---
killers:
---
* can tunnel you for three hooks (ruins your game)
---
* can slug you un-strategically (ruins your game)
---
* face camp you (ruins your game)
---
* t-bag you (with ghostface only? doesn't do anything)
---
Possibly, I wouldn’t be too surprised
---
I personally like that about Plague, survivors still have say in the match and can "counter" certain aspects of her power, but it never makes her powerless nor do you as a survivor ever feel powerless as it isn't like if you cleanse it means you guys auto lose, or if you become broken it doesn't mean you auto lose.
---
I just personally wish more people played her, and she for some reason didn't get this weird stigma on being a bad killer since she's actually fun to play as and against.
---
can you tell me the three cosmetic pieces like head, body or something
---
Wait I’m so confused
---
I love how you're not addressing some of my points.
---
I'm sorry. I should've changed the colour. xd
---
"You can't blind the Demogorgon, it can't see"
---
How is that in any way the same? A survivor loses when the killer outplays them by juggling their whole team, that’s the killers objective. To juggle killing survivors and stopping gens. To completely abandon that and just go after one person the entire game?
---
Even with spine chill Michael still scares me. What a spoopy boy.
---
It’s a cool weapon and the icon looks cool to be fair to the devs, but cmon
---
I'd rather have ruin when playing survivor than not. I like having longer, 'hearty' games where I get to switch out roles with other survivors. I want to check a chest, I want to cleanse some totems, I want to work a gen, I want to be chased, I want to be saved, I want to heal and be healed. Without ruin in red ranks as survivor against the majority of killers who don't know how to play/spread pressure without ruin we're done with all the gens by the time the first two people have been hooked and most likely depip because no one got above 15K points.
---
Love luna/ austin too, i sure hope that one day the muffin man will hack you
---
Sprint Burst with Dead Hard, BRUH
---
Looks great! Beautiful art.
---
And his quiet footsteps
---
Sorry, but I main survivor.
---
And as a survivor you take the loss the exact same way, you play until you die and see what you can take away from it. The hatch is another way out, how does your argument make any sense in terms of relating to what I just said?
---
I really want to know what your referring too
---
BBQ is great for the BP and as a high mobility killer like Billy it can be pretty great. I think it gets overhyped a lot, for me personally, I prefer whispers for my tracking perk but I run BBQ for BP if I’m trying to prestige someone
---
I mean the game isn't balanced, I look forward to the add-on buffs that Nurse, Doctor, Hillbilly, Leatherface and any future killers are getting. My only gripe was how people are saying all the other killers are trash and unusable which is a huge over-exaggeration.
---
I guess we will leave it here, at least this didn't devolve to name calling like a lot of my discussions go with people, cheers.
---
Level Up Cannibal. After unlocking BBQ, leveling Demogorgon will be easier.
---
I made a post about my killer idea! The Savant/William Marchand!!
---
That’s reserved for wraith, bubba or trapper
---
I just want more waifus spirit is my waifu well when I'm playing her
---
I think you should get BP on leatherface, that way when you equip it you'll be able to earn your BP back quickly. Kind of like an investment lol
---
it adds nothing to the meme
---
LOL this kills me all I can think about it him being like "Excuse me mam, do you need a hand?"
---
Reddit rules - never use emojis unless they are 🅱️👌👏 and some others. Only a few of them are accepted or you will be flaired as a "normie (from Instagram)".
---
It’s saying “yeah I don’t want this survivor in particular so get any points and am willing to lose the game to do so” how is that not toxic? I understand trying to take out a strong survivor as quick as you can but tunneling off hook? That is indeed toxic, playing as both survivor and killer it’s pretty obvious to see that is the case.
---
The entity likes it when they look QUITE YOUNG
---
Jesus Christ I’m a survivor main and I just thought of a more interesting way for it to work, that’s all.
---
Wow, looks awsome! I love your style &lt;3
---
I wanna do this build but it'll take a year and a half to get t3
---
Wow, you've really unlocked the key to beating Nurse. Thanks for sharing.
---
Wraith coz my phone flashlight would burn his ass.
---
Guys, please remember that implementing dedicated servers is a process and not a simple switch being turned on and then it magically works perfectly. They have been testing this for a couple of days and need to collect the data they now get from actual players and actual connections all over the world. Whoever expected that this would simply put down all issues from one day to another - I'm sorry to say -, you have been dreaming.
---
I'm sure BHVR is trying their best to adapt settings and also setups of the servers to create the stablility all players have been looking for but this might take another few months.
---
Ds should become disabled if the killer hooks another survivor after you have been unhooked. It's kinda shit when the killer can literally go down and hook another survivor and come back to still get DS on them. With that being said, I think you should get extra time if you are downed within the time DS is active. It's also kinda shit when you get u hooked and immediately hit back down and slugged for a minute. Killers like to play crappy by tunneling but dont want to handle the consequences.
---
When survivors try to finish gens as quick as possible. It’s a really stupid term that killer mains made up, usually they say it after their ruin totem breaks within the first 30 seconds of the game.
---
Are you seriously equating poor game balance to sexual assault right now
---
If I had gold, I would give it to you
---
Ah, I can just smell your sarcasm...
---
It stops
---
Had to do it to em
---
There is nothing wrong with using them objectively, it’s in the game, and is not something you see too often. But it sucks when you go against it from a survivor perspective. There is no counter play and drastically shifts the power dynamic.
---
You have to have done one of those things. They didn't just give it out.
---
Did you go to character information and check if you don't have it(just keep going to the next character until you see qunetin)
---
Good question. I usually see people try make a brutal endgame play with blood warden, noed, and make your choice (to "counter" borrowed time). Sadly after the release of the rework, the Freddy hype died down so I'd go up against a Freddy like once a week or so. 
---
Back to the real subject though, if you truly feel that noed is fine as is then hey that's cool and I respect that.
---
They assume anyone unathletic and uninformed enough to play rates going to be missing the shit out of basic attacks
---
That's what I do on a farm
---
That’s the point. .
---
Cool idea my dude, might work on my own.
---
Don't or get her add-on are still bugged too lol
---
That reminds me, I still want a Pet Sematary map
---
Puppers,monto and bricky noob3 is also good but swears a lot
---
Girls play video games ?????
---
This,This has confused and bamboozled me
---
Laurie is his sister. Just looked it up
---
I’ll happily trash NOED if you trash DS. Deal? If only it was that easy
---
Honestly, as long as like, the killer doesn't farm with one, maybe two guys in a way that ruins the game for everyone else, it's fine. At least imo
---

Killers complaining about pallet looping are usually also the killers that will basement camp you with insidious and then send hate at the end of the game
---
Learn to mind-game,learn to read the survivor movements,get gud
---
F-Mega!
---
"Do you have a minute to talk about our lord and savior, the entity?"
---
Ghostface was pretty broken, though, he was basically free instadowns all game.  Demo isn’t really, he’s like a balanced nurse.
---
What do you mean
---
Decisive is perfect against tunneling right now
---
Definately level up cannibal for barbeque and Franklin's for toxic flashlights
---
noob3 is dat boi
---
Both aren't toxic, and tombstone Myers is hard to achieve.
---
You could say that about iridescent survivor add-ons also. I still wouldn't say someone was "shit" for using them like the above poster.
---
The offering has pleased Billy
---
Of course it’s situational, but most of the times it’s a situation like this: 4 healthy survivors at the start of the game. The first surv you see is at a good pallet? Eat the pallet and rotate. You get it out the way and rotate. If they take bad pathing then you go for the injure. If they’re just flinging down every pallet then sometimes you should sacrifice gens to get pallets out the way. Good loopers will maximize the time they loop you at structures and won’t fling them down, avoid them. Find a weak link in the team, no team, SwF or not has 4 good loopers as gods. It could look that way because you’re getting salty with every pallet drop or lunge miss but it’s not true
---
Lol. Either of those are toxic. Just play the game.
---
Cause all you gave is grape flavored
---
His perks are trash I'd reccomend nea or claudette to start with
---
neither are particularly toxic IMO
---
[deleted]
---
Adam and Bill are too high up and Laurie is too low.
---
either something bugged(which is possible but unlikely) or you got it from the shrine and just forgot you did so
---
Then you gotta get boil over, and that’s my build
---
You. You are what this community hates and embodies all at the same time. A fucking whiner that whines about people whining. Hypocritical and fucking ignorant.
---
I’m rank 10 and yeah legion is definitely one of the more fun killers in my opinion. Nothing like sprinting after a survivor
---
And they can get hatch with an active trap. Like....sad pink.
---
Happens occasionally when you go for greats or ruin
---
She doesn't like scary things that much so it took me a while for me to get her to play it. but when she finally did with me she just wants to play dbd now.
---
I love using scratched mirror with it and just yoinking people off gens and totems. I usually get messages after the game with people saying how I scared the living daylights out of then.
---
If you're playing one of the killers that is LOUD AS FUCK it isn't.  #1 reason I hate Clown.  Also I wish I could get a mod to not have to hear Huntress' humming.  I like Huntress but goddamn am I tired of her humming.
---
Some survivors are actually quiet when not injured.  Ace is a flipping ninja when he's not injured where as Bill is loud even when he's healthy.
---
I was rank 12 once... then rank reset. Anyway, thanks for the legion thing. I wanna get the ST dlc, Spirit, Ghostface, and another killer but I didnt k ow who. I was debating legion and freddy
---
Wrong sub
---
Ahhhh okay that makes sense.
---
Oh I would love to experience that. On both survivor and Myers side. That’s sounds like something that would make people laugh.
---
Musty ew
---
What if they remove legion
---
Or if you’re trying to create a diversion. Which I see a lot in higher ranks.
---
Everyone gets more points if they wait there and killer wacks em anyway... Like stay in the map to make sure the other survivors are good, then wait at the gate for extra BP for all
---
I REALLY JUST GOT "FACECAMPED BY NOT BEING FACECAMPED. HERES HOW IT HAPPENED, I GOT HOOKED ALL 3 OF MY TEAMMATES ARE IN THE BATHROOM OF THE GAME LIKE IDIOTS AND THE FAT KILLER BODYBLOCKS THE ENTRANCE UNTIL I DIE ON HOOK.
---
literally the best scenario you can hope for as a survivor.
---
That's pretty **^(G A M E R)**
---
They're pretty good sports about it most of the time! I just hate how rare scratched mirrors are in the bloodweb 🙁
---
Console player here 😔

With or without a bra?

bruh

Sounds like Claudette
---
Well u know spirit doesn’t have a body, what’s she gonna do? Noises while I try to sleep.
---
There are bigger "problems" than ds if you can even consider it a problem
---
Yes, make her buff and thicc
---
Hybrid panda is my favorite. Dudes is funny and chill and you get that sweet British accent that almost hugs your ears and tucks then into bed.
---
Typically doesn't work. One person takes it for the team while everyone else pops those gens and escapes.
---
B(ill) tier bois are the real chads
---
Now go get some pussy
---
Some situations? That’s not how a tier list even works.
---
The thing us ds is so easily countered though. Just leave them on the ground for a little bit if you are worried
---
Me irl
---
well, when you’re talking about how good a killer is, yes it’s how it works.
---
He can’t be good “sometimes” is what I’m saying. That makes no sense. If he isn’t reliable then he isn’t almost top tier.
---
I am going to get hate for this, but I thought semi-tunneling was really the only viable way to play anyone that wasn't Nurse or billy. Now I didn't really hardcore tunnel or anything, but I always went for the injured person if I was by a hook and someone was unhooked. It only made sense, and survivor mistakes like that were the only reason I was able to get above 2 kills. I took a break from the game, and when I found out that they basically took it away, I don't really understand how killers can really succeed in this game anymore. I mean I guess some do, but SWF's must be having a field day or something. Before the nerf, no killer was really anti-tunnel and only survivors were against it, but now it seems everyone is against it.  Is slugging the meta now? I can't imagine killers suceeding in any other way? Or were survivors nerfed somehow in a different way? This is genuine btw I am actually curious. I guess it only made sense due to player division that the side with 4x more players would get preference. It just always seemed like Billy and Nurse were hardcore OP and the rest of the killers were weak. I don't know why they didn't just balance that out.
---
I only camp sometimes and usually only if the survivors are popping gens fast and I need to hurt a couple to slow shit down. I prefer chasing. But camping is great suspense. The waiting is intense and the jump scare is fun.
---
He can still be looped though, not well, but he still can
---
Face camping you is the win
---
He looked like he was going for the grab why didn't just let go
---
They dont
---
Best build imo, is enduring, spirit fury, bbq and ruin. Or thanat and sloppy over enduring and spirit fury. Enduring and spirit fury I’ve grown to love, especially with iridescent button and cold dirt. Loops just don’t work
---
The Conductor
---
He looks like an 1800s old-timey train conductor but he's covered in soot and mud. He carries a lantern in his left hand, and a shovel in his right.
---
**Power**
---
The Conductor has the ability to raise his lantern, which emits a bright flash of light after a 1.5-second charge. Any survivors within a 16-meter radius will be completely blinded by the flash of light for 1 second, with a recovery of 1.5 seconds to full sight. Survivors that are looking at The Conductor at the time of the flash have the duration of the blind doubled. The lantern has a cooldown duration of 8 seconds.
---
When The Conductor is the killer, the map is covered in a thick fog. The fog reduces vision to roughly 32 meters. Completing a generator will remove all fog around it for 32 meters. While in the fog and not in a chase for 10 seconds, The Conductor has a 10% increase to movement speed. 
---
**Perks**
---
Dark Exploration - 
---
At the start of the trial, two hooks will be marked with a yellow aura. Hooking a survivor on one of the marked hooks will grant you a token, remove the aura from that hook, and transform 1 other random hook into a marked hook. When you reach 6 tokens, all hooks revert back to normal and you gain a 10% haste bonus that lasts for 180 seconds.
---
On Track -
---
When you complete a break action on a generator, the auras of any survivors within an 8 meter range of the furthest generator from you are revealed to you for 6 seconds. This can only trigger once every 40 seconds.
---
Buried Secrets -
---
Hex totems cannot be cleansed until one generator has been completed. Chests take 40% longer to search.
---
It depends. Did they have toolboxes? All 4 survs having toolboxes is genrushing. There isn’t genrushing if no survs have toolboxes, that’s you playing poorly and overcommitting to failed chases. If it’s so bad, Discordance is a good option
---
and even if, I really dont think any game mechanic can be really "toxic"
---
Why does this nea face look better...
---
So you're blaming them for doing what they need to do to secure kill when they're losing pressure.
---
So you're telling me if they start to lose they need to just stare at the wall and wait until the survivors escape
---
he can be good sometimes. i don’t think you understand that tier lists aren’t just static grades that can’t get worse or better. the trapper isn’t reliable, but in some situations he is A tier (good), or however you want me to say it :)
---
At least The Shape has some significance. In the first movie Michael's actor is credited not as Michael Myers but as The Shape.
---
*Happy gen noises*
---
[removed]
---
Kill them, it's a meme at this point and you aren't  expected to, if someone complains ignore them
---
Cool. So where's the counter to him?
---
As someone wh hated the old DS with a burning hatred I think the new one is fine. if the killer doesnt tunnel its a dead perk, if they do they get punished
---
Well, if he can get ruined by the ring of what map it is, than he isn’t reliable. If he’s not reliable, than he’s not as good as his best case scenario.
---
That's actually not a bad idea. Adachi seems demented enough. Although for the supernatural part of dbd he would need magatsu izanagi.
---
Yea they don’t get that I’m running bbq so if I spin around after hooking and just see one guy across the map then I’m not running off. I know the other two are right there nearby waiting. Why the fuck would I leave the area?  That isn’t camping.
---
Look i get it that Spirit is Unique in that you can’t just loop around a pallet to deal with her like you can with almost every other killer. Thats fine. 
---
My problem lies in that you pretty much have to have Ironwill to stand any kind of chance against a decent spirit as without it there gonna hear you from a mile away and theres nothing you can do. Yeah you can vault safe windows like haddonfield or ironworks but those are fairly rare. 
---
I just don’t like having a killer where you’re fucked if you don’t have X perk, that feels very unhealthy for the game if you ask me. I can’t think of another killer where not having a certain perk is such a huge detriment.
---
Where did you see that? Can I get a link please? c:
---
didn’t say he was a good killer, i said he was good sometimes.
---
Where do you see these Tapps...?
---
As long as you dont do it at the expense of another survivor. Example: Farming 1 guy to death and letting two others escape, thats griefing. Just doing it with 2 guys is 100% harmless
---
it doesn't stall the game if every survivor gets it off first try or can just leave super easy without ever taking the time to get it off
---
This image give my flashbacks of vietnam and the time I play with a full swf with 4 old ds, horrible times
---
Actually she does if you at her slip dress
---
really isn't bad at all especially if you have a One X
---
Same thing happened to me while against a tunneling Trapper
---
Nah, we need shirtless Demogorgon first. :D
---
You said he was A tier in some situations. Yes, he can be an absolute monster on one of two maps, but a tier list IS static. I’d say trapper is low B or high C
---
Entitled survivor main here, I'm fine with the work I just dislike the speed boost
---
Oh yeah, I won't grief. If two or more kill themselves or dc I give survivor hatch and etc.
---
Franklins is trash. Delete that shit from the game.
---
Perk*
---
I love the happy endings
---
exactly. and you downvote me, yet you agree with me here? you said exactly what i said
---
I do not know. I main Myers and Trappy Pappy and I give all baby Dwights hatch
---
I'll agree with the disabled if the killer hooks another survivor but you should be able to use decisive twice a match to make it more of an anti tunneling perk.
---
Who said I downvoted you?
---
^(how ya doin lil mama lemme whisper in ya ear)
---
Doing gens won’t get u to rank up past 10 though, you really need to hit the marks, all of them
---
Here's the thing, there's literally clips of people who "tunnel" a survivor for ~40 seconds. Whatever average chase but 2 gens somehow pop. 
---
Gens are too fast, despite the meme. 80 seconds? Usually not.
---
That’s how the game is. How do you think killers feel about running Ruin every single game? It’s a boring ass perk that usually instantly gets destroyed. No one wants to run Ruin just like you don’t want to run DS. This game is not perfect, we all have to work with the shitty parts of it.
---
No one wants to run DS. It’s a “oh shit” perk neatly tucked in your back pocket you may or may not get to use. I’m not really sure what to tell you if you have your own personal philosophy on the situation. It’s just a personal problem then. Right now killers are avoiding any form of tunneling because they know DS is meta. If you have been slipping by based on other survivors running DS, then you can’t really get upset when you get tunneled since most survivors run DS for that reason.
---
Scratched mirror myers would like to speak to you
---
Damn, thought a murder device that splits your jaws apart like an angry 25 ft Gorilla was meant to kill you. That one's on me I guess, my B
---
You probably got it on the shrine but forgot that you got it.
---
Noobie here but what is tunneling?
---
How the fuck is that at all what I said? As a killer you apply pressure by juggling survivors and stopping gens. Trust me I know how to pressure I do fine at red ranks. Tunneling/camping is not pressuring, sure it’s securing a kill but that’s it. It’s also fun for neither the killer or survivor.
---
I'm sorry to hear that
---
In my experience, running empathy and were gonna live forever and just taking protection hits is a great way to up your survivor bp gains. Especially if you run prove thyself so you don't have to spend as much time on gens.
---
Ds now works when getting pulled off a hook and gives you a second chance, this gives a second chance but no skill check and can be used twice
---
So soft! It's lovely.
---
Kind of has a Billy Hargrove look to him.
---
and everyone called me weird for doing that. well who’s laughing now?
---
Next update: "We have decided that we need to be consistent with status effects, therefore Demogorgon's Shred ability will no longer down in one hit during Exposed, just as Pig's Ambush does not."
---
Oh that's pretty good
---
RISE SURVIVOR WHEN?
---
She has a face only a mysterious entity could love.
---
I complain because while yes they are losing, I also depip because of that behavior and have no option but to just “be better” by looping them for the entire game and getting out. Maybe then I’ll safety pip but I definitely won’t pip up. So I complain because I lose as well as them
---
That is so cute!
---
Good tip: ambush doesn’t count as a Save the best for last) hit
---
Don't give the devs any ideas now
---
Happened to me, just restarted my Xbox and modem and it worked.
---
Yes I am that friend
---
Yeah its hard as hell to tell people apart especially when they are wearing the same skin lol. Me and a few friends do SWF and we would go into the match all matching dwight just the regular skin. It was always fun tho.
---
Yeah its happening to me 2
---
["Face Camping you is the win"](https://twitter.com/dril/status/134787490526658561)
---
The second chance isn’t anything like DS though. Sure it gives you a health state, but DS literally stops you from getting hooked, stuns the killer, and keeps lets you get to a pallet.
---
Huzzah! A man of class!
---
whenever there is that one survivor in a group being a toxic asshole who is farming other survivors and just generally being a dick I tunnel, camp, and BM them HARD and ignore other survivors until they are dead
---
then I will continue on with the game as normal
---
To me its worse seeing ghostface do this, before i realized he had been added to the game i went into a match, started repairing a gen, turned around to see him peeking around a rock. I literally dropped my controller.
---
Oi josuke I used my ZA HANDO on myself and now I’m in the entity’s realm, isn’t that crazy?
---
✅
---
Arguable, what you said is perfectly valid, I just don’t think it encompasses all of what is considered toxic. Maybe I should describe tunneling/camping with a different term, I don’t know what to call it however. It’s an asshole way to play the game which to me is toxic. Making an atmosphere that makes playing unenjoyable, to me camping/tunneling achieves that
---
Xbox is having trouble rn
---
I love tbagging.  To me is determined as toxic or not by context. If you do it after you downed/stunned I'd say it's toxic and don't encourage it. I love tbagging with ghostfaces when they wait for their power to recharge to one shot me. Funniest thing was when I was the last survivor, hatch was open but I was being chased, I dropped a pallet but it didn't matter because we both knew I was dead so we tbagged.

He needs to just be called

“The Ghost” 
---
It’s perfect and fits with every other licensed killers name, they are all “the” something but that isn’t their actual name.
---
It seems good but not OP. I don’t really think there’s any reason to touch it. Glad survivors are getting a perk they are excited for. Is it a one time use perk like DS?

So I'm playing as Trapper on Azarov's. Getting wrecked, tried the 3 gen but man, not working out. I figure, I'm done here, and I open the gates to end this match. 
---
Bill gets chased out, but the rest? They stick around. One gets trapped in my traps, short chase later she's on a hook. There's about 45 seconds left to the end game. I had blood warden. 
---
3 kills I shouldn't have gotten because survivors didn't just gtfo.
---
And about 85% of the time that there's 1/no items: Shiny Coins all around! I keep Franklin's on most builds, along with Save the Best, and Sloppy Butcher. I want my standard attacks to *hurt their soul.*
---
Survivor mains
---
“WAAAAZUUUUUUUHHHHHHHH!?!?!”
---
teach me senpai
---
Why? Will proof be needed or something when they come out?
---
So you lied then? + I play red ranks all the time and haven't seen you :)
---
Technically speaking you're correct, but if the goal is to get ALL survivors out of the game, why are you focusing so hardcore on one survivor?
---
Plus, this justifies teabagging and flashlight spamming, it makes the killer mad, don't good survivors WANT the killer to tunnel them so their teamates can do gens?
---
dude sick smug redditor retort bro! that was so sick nasty! you sir win le internet for today xD! Happy cake day!
---
It’s also a little concerning that you’re mixing these vape juices from the random shit you’re finding in your pockets...
---
You need some unlocks from other survivors so you can run some perks on Ace to get you out of chases. I take turns leveling up each survivor to 30. Playing a different character makes you change your play approach, which can be beneficial for your overall game. Once you get some perks, switch back to your boy Ace.
---
The good old detonates servers
---
Nobody knows for sure. But according to past PTB running times the chapter should go live for everyone on the 17th (or close to that).
---
HybridPanda is the man. Monto too.
---
What do you mean not that big of a nerf?
---
It absolutely was a big nerf,it makes all your remaining traps useless after all gens are completed,and it would have been very powerful with the endgame collapse...
---
Which addons?
---
Nah, dedicated servers will give the devs more overview and information on the match so they’ll be able to see if you were actually cheating or not.
---
Memes like this, despite being funny, start up too many fights in the community, we can't talk about toxicity without one side getting mad, as someone who doesn't main a side, it makes me mad, I've seen a lot of toxicity on both sides.
---
Ok thanks
---
Yea i heard they’re the bomb
---
Now you’ve gone too far
---
Holy Crap, I have to put up with Techies in two games now.....
---
Greedy, hell I would kill for some extra bloodpoints. I usually get extremely low amounts
---
In my expeeience like 5% of players dc vs nurse, but late evenings or deep nights the % seems to skyrocket even when you bring b.p.streamers.
---
People really don't like nurse :(
---
That's good. It'll be nice to know I can't get banned for some lie a butthurt dude made up
---
JJBA chapter with Okuyasu survivor and Cream/Vanilla Ice killer when?
---
Nah they'll probably pull another Behavior and nerf demo.
---
I... I don't know if I'm getting r/whoosh'd here
---
Hatch should stay closed unless a key is used. The hatch is not an alternative exit method, it’s something to help make the last survivors endgame more fair. If the killer finds it and closes it, then that’s that. And if a survivor or a group of survivors decides to get a free escape then that should be the end of it as well.
---
Damn I really expected that one to blow you away
---
Same, but he had to have known it was Ghostface, and he knew that Ghostface has no terror radius.
---
He could have chosen to get the 7500 for Hatch Escape, instead he forced the Killer to choose between him getting 8500 or the Killer getting ~2000ish. Assuming everyone wants the bloodpoints, it's a pretty easy choice to make.
---
I wouldn’t even worry about it, I’ve been ‘reported’ countless times and nothing has been done so I’d say if you’re not cheating, just brush them off as salty comments.
---
Techies?
---
I’m calling the police
---
It doesn’t effect the killer at all and once I’m in a lobby my nat type can’t kick me out. Just keeps me from joining. Doesn’t mean I have a bad connection.
---
Im still sitting here waiting for shirtless Mcote.
---
when it gets released for all consoles
---
I’m on mobile atm so that might be it. It’s a shame that the second perk you get is essentially a coin toss. I guess in the end the grind is still a little less even if you don’t always get the perk you want.
---
DotA 2's Mine experts.
---
If you've played League of Legends, imagine Teemo, but they start with the mines at level 1 and it deals full damage upon detonation.
---
Doin gens. You?
---
I can relate.
---
That’s what I’m trying to ask smh
---
That would really suck that the last man standing could be screwed over so heavily by others with a key
---
It's the circles penis. Mcote confirmed this in the last stream they had.
---
Doug Dimmagorgon of the Hawkins Laboratory
---
You're probably right. I guess im just paranoid about it because my friend just got banned not too long ago for cheating when he didnt
---
U SCARED ME GHOSTY BOII
---
haHAA that's not what he's saying and you know it. Being purposely obtuse only hurts your argument.
---
about 2 weeks, the same time for PC and consoles...
---
Hey I'm a D-boy Peanuts out here open the door!

I can’t just say “survivors with fixated:” that makes no sense and isn’t a meme at that point.
---

---
Damn
---
Bloody Steve is literally that Patrick meme where’s he’s super Jacked.
---
I'm just hoping they actually take action against people I report for being AFK or those that DC on first down or first hook.
---
What this dude said. As long as nobody is being mistreated deliberately for other people's benefit, it's usually fair game. And in cases like that where survivors kill themselves quickly, the remaining survivors are usually grateful for you getting some points with them so their time isn't wasted
---
Darn, ah well. I had two red ping players report me for lag switching once and it was the most ignorant thing I’ve encountered in this game, say gg and move on.
---
Zubatlel if you want to watch good gameplay. 
---
Puppers if you want personality.
---
Everyone else is too egotistical or annoying in a way that builds up every video.
---
Wrong my friend got banned for no reason for false reports
---
Why is it harder to go down on a girl after about the 5th time? Do you just not smell it at first?
---
Perhaps. But I personally don't run into enough afk people to really want to occaisonally get temporarily banned for something out of my control. However I do see where you're coming from.
---
"Morbid Curiosity" suuuuure
---
The only problem is his perks are for his power. Perks don't work that way and they'd be useless on other killers. It would be really cool if you could bake those concepts for perks into addons
---
It wasn't me who had this happen, it was a streamer who happens to be quite good at the game. I dont know if toolboxes were involved but I do know that 3 gens in two minutes is fucking insane.
---
Man if he loops and I can’t get a hit I just head out on crip
---
I THOUGHT THE STRANGER THINGS DLC WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR PS4 ON SEPT. 4 TILL I FOUND OUT IT WAS ONLY FOR PTB!! 😭 THEY WEREN'T SPECIFIC ENOUGH BEFORE AND I GOT MY HOPES AND WALLET SAVING UP..
---
Looks like a dead fetus came to life.
---
BrO hE nEedS tO bE lIkE lEgIon
---
Ummm no. In red ranks, you see way more good nurses than billies.
---
Yeah my friend didn't know that at the time
---
Thank you so much! Really appreciate it.
---
Bashur admitted it was an act to drive viewers to his channel from the controversy. Also, he diddled children.
---
So basically he's another toxic twitch streamer? Typical.
---
Deadhard is better than balanced landing. You dont even need to use balanced landing because its passive reduction of stagger makes it top tier.
---
When you enjoy the toast a little too much
---
Facts
---
What is devotion?
---
I wonder if you got this idea from a comment someone made. Karma whore. Credit the other guy atleast.
---
Demdemgon
---
&gt;you just have to make the right reads
---
Which is almost entirely down to the skill of the Spirit, not mine.
---
&gt;Warden is regarded a very viable and good character.
---
Weird, because the Devs of For Honor seem to have disagreed considering they've tried to rework him to not be a vortexing scumlord. Too bad the For Honor devs are incompetent.
---
Wait this is a show? Do you know if its on Netflix?
---
But Nurse is fine :pepega:
---
I never DC lol I experience 3-2-1 mans games almost every nurse match tho unless I’m SWF
---
Personally I would stick with Nurses Calling to apply pressure, but whispers on nurse could work out in your favor if you want to blink across the map for easy picks.
---
Ok so I was playing a game and I see Michael stalking someone in the opposite direction I turn around look back and he did a teleportation jutsu or something cause he was next to me in less then I second
---
What the are you talking about? My boyfriend said this.
---
Yes sir.
---
If you t-bag and then get hooked, you forfeit your right to whine about facecamping
---
...I imagine a future where I can be with you🎵
---
The Blob!
---
Whatever you say Demolition Medusa.
---
You're supposed to take advantage of the fact that they are going through every pallet, because guess what? They just wasted all the pallets in an area. Your teammates do not know what pallets have been used. The person you have been chasing for x amount of time knows EXACTLY where to go.
---
Instead of making a good argument about pallets, you just admitted that you tunnel the same survivor for way too long lmao
---
I mean..   M1ing a surv.  Brutality points. 
---
Dashing  deviousness points.  
---
Makes sense to me that all the exposed stuff doesn’t work.      But logically it doesn’t.
---
Thats an incredibly cool idea
---
He doesn't look bloody he looks bruised. I guess the pallets were too much for him and his plant-ness
---
Im with you, my fellow Jeff.
---
Hears the thing I usually do nurses call if I see p2 or p3 or any Claudette in my game
---
Ah yes, just jitter your mouse/joystick and you shall fool the billy
---
Jimmy barnes survivor confirmed?
---
Yes it’s called Robot Chicken! The guys who did these are fucking hilarious and has a ton of episodes! All revolving around different movies and people... look them up the Star Wars episodes are the best! Senator Poppa Palpateen!
---
The swap roles button was likely taken away incase you're in a party.
---
Still, it should be there and give us a pop up saying "Switching to Killer will make ylu leave the party, do you wish to continue?"
---
Woops forgot a bout that
---
When you level to 100, instead of continuing on in levels (101,102...) you gain a devotion level and go back to level 1, and it just repeats that every time. You don’t gain anything special with devotion levels.
---
I don't know why but Claudettes one has to be the funniest out of them all.
---
I'd assume like in most other games they will track you for couple games here and there without you knowing and get their own proof. Reporting just gets their attention on who to check.
---
This is all saying if they do care about banning people.
---
Who said any of that, chief? You took a statement and ran miles with it. 
---
I’d like the bear-traps to actually have hindering effect to the survivors and not aura blindness and mangled as if they’re good addons. They’re not even good at their stall because they come off super easy, give more time than it should to be a threat and suspiciously even though the traps are numbered to a box the first box the survivors search is very likely to be the one that gets them out. Even if it’s supposed to be her stall tool. It needs to....do that.
---
If its infinite and your not trying to escape the killer it is.
---
Im guessing: His David wasn’t leveled very high (lvl 1-2 perks) so he ran 2 exhaustion perks bc he didn’t have good alternatives. Also the guy that got hit with NOED was the first one to get hit after the gates were powered. He had no way of knowing the killer had that perk.
---
R/mildlyintresting
---
#WHY HELLO THERE! FANCY SEEING YOU HERE!
---
Oink
---
i think it was because he just came out of the hook, and the hit doesn't count
---
So funny story 1 day I was in a party chat with a friend playing huntress running iridescent head and proceeded to jokingly 360 no scope and launched a hatchet across map. A second later I hear a scream and someone hit the ground. I was laughing so hard and wheezing that I pretty much gave up on the match and let that person go. I felt complete after that
---
No its not nearly that long and it's honestly quite powerful on a lot of loops, completely shuts down shack and most autohaven loops
---
They didn't. They made his vortex better, and gave him an unblockable heavy on top of it, just to give him more options. They like his vortex, that's why characters like Hitokiri are coming out. Hitokiri literally has his vortex, just slightly worse. Jorm, the newest character, is all about guessing and mindgames as well. It's the correct character design for any game that hopes to be competitively viable. You're on the wrong side of this argument bud, hate to say it. It was nice chatting with you though.
---
It still should've hit and put me in the wipe animation, but not do any damage
---
It's who's the obsession
---
The mangled status effect slows healing doesn't it?
---
/r/dbdgonegay
---
you mean constantly chased by the killer?
---
What do you mean? Nevermind teabagging, the good ol Ruin, Spirit Fury, BBQ, NOED combo will be great for the new players trying to have fun. They won’t be hitting great skillchecks so Ruin will destroy them. They won’t know how the killer can destroy a pallet and hit them. They won’t know how to killer knows exactly where they are after hooking someone. And they sure as hell won’t do all 5 totems to avoid being insta downed if they somehow last for 5 gens. Atleast baby killers can tunnel someone and eventually catch them. Baby survs just have no chance at all
---
No like there's perks that could make a survivor an "obsession"
---
 thanks, i always had the doubt what that was
---
Honestly it's just the skins and some cool perks that pertain to those characters. Looping is a term used when a player is chased by the killer without being hit or downed. It's used to 'gen rush' which just means that one or more of the other survivors not being chased complete the generators. Most survivors are toxic ie with teabagging, flashlight flickering and with after game chat. Just win however you can win and do your best to not let them get to you. It's a game best played with friends because it gives you an advantage; like knowing where the killer is most of the time.. it's also worth mentioning that it really only gets fun to play once you have good perks, offerings and add ons to improve your experience which yoibget by leveling your blood web. I get not wanting to stick around. But I hope you do! Good luck.
---
its because its a cone in front of you and in the first one they cut past you
---
Go ride a bike around town with some 12 year olds then. Get that experience you are longing for.
---
You’re definitely inexperienced if you don’t understand why those two exhaustion perks work together lol. No matter what you’ll always have the stagger reduction and if you’re not exhausted you have two options for an escape, such as a high drop for the speed boost or dead hard for the melee juke or gaining distance to a pallet / window vault
---
Or bing bong, or maybe a hatcher slicing through the air! Or perharps a terrible swooshing sound like... like someone is vacuuming with a broken vacuum!
---
We're Gonna Live Forever and Urban Evasion. They are both unlocked and my Kate is almost at level 50 and they won't drop
---
Obviously.
---
senpai is wise
---
Sounds like cope.
---
Yeah, ruin isn't really a huge deal.  I also love it when I'm the one who finds the hex and breaks it.
---
Like I said, I just wish some people wouldn't stop doing gens.
---
Yes, but mangled does not increase blood pools
---
bold of you to assume i have friends
---
You're just laggy don't attack the game
---
True, but why the hell do we have a BP bonus perk that has no other feature? BBQ is actually useful compared to WGLF. The perk needs an added feature so that it can benefit the team.
---
"You and the unhooked survivor sees the killers aura at a range of 40 meters for 20 seconds"
---
Or
---
"All healing skill checks are great and appear more frequently"
---
"Other survivors see the aura of you and the unhooked survivors for 40 seconds
---
Or 
---
"Taking a protective hit causes the killers 'blade wipe' animation to be 25% longer"
---
Some crap like this.
---
I had this same thing happen on PC! it scared me to death
---
Man.. that is a real bummer. I began reading this in hopes of a happy ending but, just like the meme, you had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
The DBD community as a whole is pretty toxic. You and your friends witnessed that first hand. People, for whatever reason, love to Teabag and just be rude in general on this game and it still complexes me to this day, and i have a lot of time played with both PC and Xbox.
---
As for the 'Looping", i can see why it makes the game stale very quickly. For killers, usually the best option is to break the pallet and move on with the chase. The Demogorgon is not a very advanced killer, meaning that there is not much potential for 'High Level Mindgaming" with his powers. However, that doesn't mean he isn't a strong killer, because he definitely has the potential to be a B tier killer. Furthermore, the verbal harassment is just part of the DBD DNA unfortunately. The Devs of the game even told the community to "Be nice since there will be many new faces on the servers since the new Stranger Things Chapter is coming out soon" and it seems like that went over REALLY well (sarcasm).
---
In conclusion, i really do hope that you and your friends reconsider and do decide to give it another try. There are a lot of jerks in the community, but there are also a lot of really nice people as well, some of which i have befriended and grew to have true friendships with. I hope you have a great rest of your night, and please let me know if you have any questions! I am always happy to help out a new comer.
---
Ace looks like the curator from man of Medan with a beard
---
Is that a watermark for a photoshopped rewrite of an existing comic?
---
&gt;It's the correct character design for any game that hopes to be competitively viable.
---
Which is why For Honor isn't competitively viable. Their competitive scene consists of ganking matches.
---
&gt;You're on the wrong side of this argument bud, hate to say it.
---
You sure know your For Honor better than I do, I'll give it to you. Guessing games aren't good for balance, that's why For Honor is and always has been a shithole that hinges on 3k players. Or are you going to act like For Honor is, in anyway, balanced competitively?
---
Poof?
---
If you play on console its because it used to be a base perk since they couldn't add Bill to console you could find but they added Bill not too long ago which made it a teachable. They didn't take it away from characters that already have it in their perks though, you just have to unlock it if you want it on others now.
---
In my hand, is a pen that will write a poem of me and you 🎵
---
Note: He stayed there until my timer was nearly out. Most of us got away, but such a boring game with little reward.
---
What the fuck lol watching his head pop out of nowhere was just so creepy.
---
Just wanna say thank you for showing me what the P3 Demo looks like! It looks pretty cool. You do you btw, I'm glad you recognize that. Much love
---
Now on the same topic (sorta), when is the double bloodpoint even supposed to happen?
---
Whispers and deerstalker are a waste of perk slots.
---
Yeah no, I don't buy it. I mean, I SUPPOSE it's not impossible that a bunch of fresh new players decided to hop into the PTB, but I find it kind of unlikely. 
---
And the way everything here is just a tad too on the nose, like this is how I would imagine writing a hypothetical "noob" complaint letter from my already exprerienced perspective.
---
And even if this isn't fake, which it probably is, no one cares. This is a pointless post that no one gets anything out of. We're not here to validate you.
---
Happens to me sometimes, too.  Worst part is not being able to struggle when the killer has me.
---
Looks like she hasn’t slept in days haha
---
I really like it though, would love to see Steve
---
What I meant to say here was if I could down vote him twice I would.
---
see that's how you play ghostface
---
DBD has the weirdest fucking community man. In no other game do people actively whine about other people playing the game by the rules and without using hacks.
---
You guys have all these unwritten rules about what a person should and shouldn't do during a match, its fucking ridiculous.
---
If you are always getting tunnelled, don't fucking play using the same strategy every. fucking. game. Mix it up, work on gens, kill totems. The killer is SUPPOSED to be able to catch 1 survivor if they tunnel, the trade off is the gens. Don't whine at the killer because you don't know how to adapt to another play style. Blame your team mates for not getting sufficient compensation / not running interference.
---
The problem between match making putting experienced survivors against lower ranked killers, experienced survivors in general, and the questionably weak balance of most of the killers is that chases simply last too long if everyone is even moderately good at looping, and odds are that all of them will be at least decent.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
When one survivor can run perks and items to solo a generator through Ruin in thirty seconds even if their only skill is hitting Greats then the game has a huge problem when chases correspondingly take ages.
---
Some complete knucklehead can throw down every pallet on the map instantly without looping beforehand as you chase them and by the time you chew through all the pallets, all five generators will still be done even if the survivors cleansed nearby totems too.
---
It's incredibly frustrating to be a rank 12 Killer and go against red ranks, full prestiges, full legacies, people with thousands of hours.
---
Chasing is harder than just M1ing on a generator, and the balance between chasing and holding M1 on a generator is ridiculous, even Killers like Ghostface have to abuse strafe bugs and how detection reset is one-sided.
---
That is big oof... I dont know how else to respond to that.
---
They should just have the plus signs
---
How is dead hard useless against good killers?
---
Not really but okay bud. You got an example of how that will happen
---
It's better than a groupthink
---
Because if it's only for survivors or killers they'd just be a circlejerk as killers and survivors agree with each other alot
---
it wasn't but yeah i should've checked
---
Yes! r/dbdLFG  
---
Good luck! Unfortunately, I'm on PC
---
"We're trying to normalise what's considered a power and what's considered a hit."
---
*immediately adds a contradiction.*
---
"We're normalising add ons so that rarity is similar across all killers."
---
*Reworks Wraith to have common add ons that work like every other killer's 'very rares.'*
---
By all means, have a direction and a goal, but just fucking stick with it.
---
The only way I can evade a decent Nurse who keeps landing close to me is to abandon traditional looping points entirely.
---
Most people head towards pallets even though you have to be very lucky to stun her mid-blink even so, and some of the pallet tiles are still good even though the pallet is worthless.
---
It's all about getting as many walls between you and the Nurse as possible. If she's about to blink onto you, '360' around the nearest tree or something and hope she hits it instead; you're not going to really escape someone who can regain line of sight on her next blink, but the idea is that if there are multiple barriers between you and her she might not know how far to blink.
---
Slow vaulting once you've broken LOS helps with this too, sometimes.
---
I will literally buy the DLC to do just that *fly comes out my wallet* as soon as I have the money
---
I think you dont understand what i mean, i mean killer sub discusses killer buffs/nerfs/reworks
---
And survivor does vice versa
---
CrossPlay has not been added, no.
---
I personally wouldn't run fixation with Lightweight unless you are trying to learn how long scratch marks last with it. Fixation with Lightweight won't allow you to make the same amount of scratch mark misleads as you could without it.
---
Instead of Sprint Burst I would run Dance with me and Lithe together, they compliment each other REALLY well, and you'll get more use out of both.
---
Dont know, i never intentionally disconnected on purpose before...
---
He does suffer a penalty for missing an attack though?
---
That's one of the best deals in history. We can throw in ebony mories and keys while we're getting rid of junk.
---
No, no it isnt. Al of you guus complain about toxicity but when anyone tries to talk about how to help stop toxicity you all just shoot each other in the foot saying "ThE cOmMuNiTy Is ToXiC, gEt OvEr It."
---
I despise kobeing personally. I hate multiplayer games with rng
---
Yeah, I never DC on purpose. I just want to explain in detail to my friend who’s a new player the whole system of depipping due to disconnect, but realised myself I barely know anything about it.
---
Yeah, the poster is just a picture of the actual guy.

Legion is fun. Honestly fuck viability just play who you want and how you want. I personally love legion. However when he flops he flops hard, but I’ve turned entire games around by just putting enormous pressure on people with frenzy and chain stabs. Super good times.
---
I'M SICK OF GETTING IMMEDIATE DC'S ONCE SURVIVORS KNOW I'M PLAYING SPIRIT. IT GET'S SO FRUSTRATING TO DEAL WITH ***17 GAMES WITH DC'S IN A ROW*** (ACTUALLY FUCKING HAPPENED TONIGHT). I UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY AGAINST A SPIRIT BUT YOU'RE RUINING THE FUN FOR YOUR FELLOW SURVIVORS AND THE KILLER. I ALMOST MADE IT TO RED RANKS FOR THE FIRST TIME BUT KEPT DE-PIPPING BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF RAGE-QUITS I GOT. :(
---
She has 2 add ons that cause mangled.

I had someone do the pointing at me after every pallet drop, I caught them because they weren't looking while they were healing up (Wraith no terror radius after uncloaking addon) and it was incredibly satisfying. They disconnected.
---
Of course I still didn't get the 4K just because generators get cranked out faster than your average chase, especially in pallet-heavy maps.
---
You cant but if you have some unused ones then you buy the killer, theyre literally just taking up space in your offering pages
---
I do remember them talking about implementing a timed temporary banning from matchmaking for intentional discos, but when that is.....who knows
---
Wait r6 goddess as in soniqs goddess? 👀
---
That's usually how I use it. Glad the message gets across.
---
These look SO great. Thank you :)
---
Much appreciated. I should honestly be playing on pc.
---
Ah I see. Well TIL!
---
When is chapter release?
---
Must get out of brown/yellow ranks quickly.
---
denotated waaaam
---
Have two days worth of not ranking up, of survivors knowing all of the loops, knowing the mind games, have all of the items and great perks, to have them repair gens while you work so hard to just down 1 person, only to have all the gens complete because you don't have ways to slow them down..... "woop the gates are powered! Bye bye" to the point where your blackens your heart enough for you to not give a shit when they have the misfortunes for once.
---
Hex: Technical Difficulties is going to be meta on Doc.
---
How long will it take for people to figure out this isnt how you use this meme format
---
the loop ends! you toucha my palette
---
Literally lmao. Dawg, it ain't that deep. Separating the community by killer vs survivor is just gonna make the toxicity worse.
---
Example:
---
Sprint burst is a terrible exhaustion perk I would go for dead hard or balanced landing
---
It looked like a dog xd
---
On their discord i asked it dunno how to send pic but if you go to mentions  and search for owooga buwuga you'll find it
---
Rank 1 survivor here.  Nurse is fun to play against when she has no add ons.  But if you've seen her range add ons, it doesnt just buff her range.
---
Let's say some guy is playing leatherface without ruin and gets into a chase with somebody.
---
"Hey this guy is pretty good and seems to know what he's doing running towards the safest part of the map, I better leave him and try my LUCK with a different survivor to slow down their gen progress." \*By now one or more gens should be done if not almost done. "Looks like these three are "good" loopers as well. HMMMM. So if I chase somebody who can't be caught because they're in an extremely safe part of the map I trade pallets for gens, but if I stay guarding gens then I can't catch people and just end up making the game boring for everybody."
---
If all survivors are competent loopers most killers just don't have the means to win the war of attrition. 
---
If left to their own devices two survivors on their own can complete all 4 generators in less than 4 minutes and that's pretty insane when you really stop and think about it. 
---
(This is assuming these TWO survivors don't have a single toolbox, don't hit a single great skill check and the half of their team doesn't touch a gen.
---
My biggest potato moment was when I had a week or so off the game and came back somehow forgetting the controls
---
Spawned in with the 3 other survivors and immediately pressed R2 to crouch (even though no game uses that as crouch), throwing down my firecracker and alerting the killer
---
Someone got hooked right after, so when I saw you were holding the firecracker I thought it was something like that

There's Begrimed Head and Smooth Stone but Sloppy Butcher absolutely works on hatchets without any issues.
---
I'm honestly scared of that combination, also Jäger on Ghostface, and if you ran Always Watching with Mindbreaker and you'd have an exhaustion build.
---
Yeah. Strange.
---
Sorry man, I'm doing a gen. Can it wait?
---
Pardon me but when will the demogorgon be out for sale or when will the PTB will end ?
---
Sometimes a game itself can be toxic though.
---
Chases aren't really balanced in the favor of the killer when compared to any possible combination of generator times, ever, unless you're playing Nurse (you can even deny a good Spirit her first hit for long enough); even then you have to be good at Nurse, it's easy to miss too many blinks if you're not incredibly practiced and familiar with the maps.
---
That doesn't mean looping itself is toxic, but that the core gameplay balance is incredibly broken, and it often ends up being a toxic frustrating experience anyway.
---
And survivors do often abuse broken mechanics and/or bullshit window spawns, like 4 L-walls with a window each in a massive pseudo-infinite that doesn't get window blocked after their third vault.
---
I have only seen *one* survivor get the entity blocker bug and not abuse it for extra vaults.
---
Good discussion requires both sides

Demohio

That's not how you use apostrophes.

Curator survivor when

This is my new favorite post on this sub
---
Can you show us what your lobby and maybe a few gameplay shots? What resolution are you using etc
---
I imagine this has to be using more than just the in-game low setting? Were there other settings or things have you changed?
---
What!? Demogorgon can NOED a survivor with his Shred, but Miss Piggy, who has seniority over that little bitch, fucking can't and he abilities are still nerfed!? That's fucking bullshit! This message was sponsored by Mister Torgue, mother fucker! (In all seriousness though, the fuck, BHVR?)

Except it nevers turns out that way, also if people who mostly never play killer try discussing killers then its a dead end
---
Billy also has the new map, sad how he goes from one of the best killers to being mediocre by the map.
---
I love grabbing unsuspecting survivors on gens
---
Its a good build
---
There's a website that shows you your stats (pc only) if you want I can link it in a few hours.

It’s because I’m from Michigan OKAY??? nO vaPiNg AlLoWed

When you get 1234 kills in one match
---
So brilliantly put!!!!
---
Switch out balanced landing for borrowed time
---
Ah cool thanks for the long reply. Also gen rush I'd assume is doing gens really fast? Don't see a problem if it is this because isn't it the point of the game.
---
Always let the person coming last drop the pallet. People who don't get this and vacuum me backwards into the Killer are frustrating as hell. x:
---
A lot of it is just drawings or animated stuff, but there's also stuff like u/twomanaland 's legion cosplay with titties
---
mom said it’s my turn on the xbox
---
It's old at this point but its moving in the right direction. With the Centurion buff and new characters, it's becoming a much better game. The devs dropped the ball that's for sure.
---
We can look at other popular fighting games with an actual competitive scene. MKX was filled with 50/50s and shit. MK11 is too, but not as much. Any popular fighting game with a competitive scene is full of guessing games. You need that, otherwise they become too defensive. Too defensive means games turn into drawn out staring matches where both are afraid of doing anything because they might be punished for it. This is the problem For Honor had in the beginning and is why the game died in the first place. I love that game a lot but yes, you're right it is almost dead. Fortunately they are improving the game constantly and hopefully that brings the player count up a bit. But we'll see I guess.
---
Which is why it would be seperated and ran by high level killers.
---
&gt;This videogame subreddit Reddit is shockingly mostly people from 7-10 years of age
---
I'm sorry, what?
---
I haven't played the game in a very long time, the last I remember was every match being Warden vortexing and Shugoki cheesing tournaments.
---
I'm not against guessing games. I like Huntress' guessing games, because if you guess right, she gets punished. If you guess wrong, you get punished. Spirit doesn't get punished. A 15 second, at most, cooldown is not a punishment. The reason I bring up Warden is because, if I'm not mistaken, he barely loses stamina for his shield bash while you lose a huge chunk of yours for dodging out the way. Not only is Spirit a one-sided mindgame, she loses nothing for fucking up, whereas you just die/get hit.
---
As she stands right now, when your volume is above 50, there is nothing that she can't hear, making mindgames basically impossible as long as she's not playing with earbuds. I know this because I abuse the shit out of it. I play survivor at 15, go play Spirit and crank it up to 65 and I'm good to go. If they nerfed her ability to track survivors in her phasing, I wouldn't care that she has guessing games, because atleast I'm not the only one guessing. You have to royally fuck up to not consistently get hits on everyone, Iron Will users included.
---
This is why I said we need to agree to disagree. Imo, the guessing games she employs are unfair. Guessing games themselves aren't always unfair, like I've said with Huntress. You think the opposite. We'll see what the devs do.
---
Just read it without the reddit part
---
Yesterday i play killer and got lagging too. Dunno why
---
Would swap Deerstalker and put both
---
Most of the Survivors are arseholes before the Entity took them.  
---
Dare Devil would be a killer.
---
That scream is what I hear in my head when a survivor I didnt tunnel says I tunnel or a killer who barely found me says I gen rushed.
---
Not true you can get iridescent shards easier
---
Stop.
---
haha, not sure how to respond to that.
---
if you have a question on the math, myself or u/lespritdelescaller11 would be happy to break it down for you
---
I'm sorry that was a typo on my part (fixed now), I just don't think there are that many kids that young in this sub
---
Hes walking like the first examiner in hxh
---
That's why you knock down a few pallets with the first guy and zone the new one into them if anything.
---
Looks awesome dude!!
---
Yeah man we're all working towards one goal here and that's a better dbd I'm just happy you like that idea. I made a post recently about a killer concept for The Operator from Marble Hornets, but I think The Alien sounds much cooler
---
You would be suprised, its also obivous by the "cross-posts" that is related to this game and others.
---
Then Daredevil can't fight because he can't see.
---
Umm what? That shouldnt have hit me even if I had not moved.

How did I get hit?
---
That's actually coming to the game soon, they said it during their 3 year anniversary earlier this year, will probably come with the actual dedicated servers launch
---
Smells like teenage angst
---
No. Idk how they got the likeness and the actors didnt just pull up.
---
&gt; Keep being shit and being hardstuck purple
---
Holy fucking shit, imagine being that dumbass and thinking rank matters
---
I mean the Killer gets more points if:
---
You bleed out on the ground, **but**:
---
They catch the survivor and hook them.
---
They get another chase in.
---
They get points for hitting the survivor.
---
They get points for breaking extra pallets.
---
They may get to close the hatch after hooking the survivor in their death animation.
---
If they hook you and you die and the other person escapes through the hatch, most of that is lost; they also get points (up to 500 I think) for you bleeding out, so they're not sacrificing every point you're worth if you die on the ground either.
---
It's not being toxic, it is literally designed and built into the game mechanics regarding Killer emblems and blood point gains, it is what you are supposed to do if you're at all interested in playing according to said mechanics.
---
Bloody scoops ahoy Steve would look incredible
---
No you can't get a character for "free" by buying a cosmetic for them.
---
Nurse is fine as long as swf is in the game
---
It's not a bad idea. I don't know why everyone is treating you like you're crazy
---
I smell pennies
---
It’s really a mix of “Everyone’s too far away” or “Everyone’s just ignoring me” and tunneling (getting hit as soon as you get off the hook)
---
I'll hook someone again *once* after they're farmed as long as there are enough generators remaining. If they get farmed again I'll slug them.
---
This means that if you're farmed for the first time on your death hook, I'll kill you to keep momentum, but if you're farmed on your first hook and I hook you again and you get farmed *again* I'll go ahead and look the other way/hit you to punish the farmer but leave you on the ground to be healed.
---
Besides if someone unhooks you right in front of me and you have Decisive Strike, that's something I have to get out of play early otherwise it'll ruin my momentum even more later.
---
If survivors took longer to do generators and couldn't pop out three in a single chase, we could be nicer without losing, but...
---
1. Yes, otherwise he'd be literal trash just like in PTB.
---
2. If you lose line of sight and he isn't revealed, you definitely did not look at him long enough. You have a 0.3 buffer against him, so even if he hides "in time" he still gets exposed more often than it cancels. Crouching does not reset it unless he leaves your sight.
---
3. I *always* run spine chill, always went off for me. You're either remembering incorrectly or the victim of a really godawful bug.
---
4. Server issue unfortunately, works both ways.
---
Well when I first started exploring and learning while slowly unlocking things was super cool. I would be happy with it rather than trying to metagame from the very beginning. You'll reach a point eventually where nothing is new.
---
The game isn't really that competitive anyway. If you're not having fun this early on I would just say cut your losses and move on.
---
What i don’t understand what ur saying lol the survivor sub would be ran by high level  killers too??? Now im just confused.
---
Well I can't think of a HUGE detriment but calm spirit basically nerfs Doc and Spine chill hard stops 1 hit downs from Ghostface, all in all though spirit is my least favorite killer to face just because she's so easy to take down survivors with
---
good for you, I really hate farming tho...
---
Killers tend to camp a lot in lower ranks because they are too afraid to leave the hook out of fear of losing a kill. Its toxic, but happens a lot in the lower ranks. As you get into higher ranks, camping happens a lot less ubless you guys are constantly hook rushing.
---
Don’t know why I’m getting downvoted I’m literally just saying that only the shitty players are complaining
---
sure! go for it
---
Dying Light needs to not shut off after the obsession dies, make it like StBFL and just have it lock in at however many stacks it is at when the obsession dies. 
---
I was having fun with on Legion with Sketch Books (longer duration Frenzy), Iridescent Button (Global Terror Radius when in Frenzy) and then Thanataphobia, Sloppy, Coulrophobia and Dying Light.
---
Thinking about modifying to make it actually better but I like the idea of Sloppy and Dying Light for the anti healing build, the coulrophobia + button was just a fun meme.
---
Unless you're literally deafening yourself to track perfectly and have perfect surround sound both to discern direction and land on top of them, then kinda.
---
Slow vaults work pretty well when she's phasing to make her hit a wall as well.
---
Nah, he'll probably loose his save and the devs won't re-add it to his account.
---
lmao he’d have to be a total noob for that to happen
---
What would the hindered status effect do? Slow down survivor's gen progress when they aren't even on gens because they're trying to get the trap off, 11/1 great add-on, make it ultra rare.
---
No, the survivor is not "very likely" to get their trap off on the first box, they have a 1/4 chance, 1/5 with Jigsaw's Annotated Plan or Jigsaw's Sketch, 1/6 with both. Where do you get this ludicrous math from!? Stop acting like RNG is something other than it is.
---
dude I’ve never experienced so many jump scares in my fucking life. Ghost face always scares the ever living shit out of me. I was just casually walking to a gen the other day, and I just slightly shifted my camera angle to reveal a ghost face just crouching behind me. I don’t know how long he was there but Jesus Christ.
---
Sharp
---
Yeah I can't believe they almost went with a clown mask, it would've hurt the presence imo
---
I like the "Pale emotionless face...with the blackest eyes,"
---
Prestige/Level Reset.   
---
Once you hit 100( (somewhere around that) you reset back to 1 and get a new number underneath.
---
Because the killer doesn't know who brought it in. Sadly, the devs didn't add it in because then the killer would  hold the game hostage by trying to gain trust with the player who brought BPS and then trap the farmee and his friend(s)(assuming he has any) in a corner so that they can't leave unless they  DC :(
---
Mucho respect 👍
---
I’m not asking them to give it up I’m asking them not to waste my time. It’s not like it’s impossible to still get the kill after hooking me. Sometimes it’s like every killer assumes the last survivor is just sitting right on hatch and god forbid take that risk.
---
Most aren't. Dwight was hated by his office enough he got left in the woods but not cause he's a dick but because they didn't respect him on any level, Jane was a well loved talk show host, Kate was a world renowned singer, Francis was a black professor who loved his students like they were his kids, Tapp was a detective who risked everything to save lives, Ash fought back literal demons to save the world and that's skipping a lot of other stories which are more tragic than they are the result of them being a dick. 
---
At most only David King and the luck man Ace are assholes, former for being a drunk who loved fighting WAAAAAAAAY too much and would incessantly start fights just so he could be in them and the latter for being behind on vague payments to the mob over his gambling debts even though he himself isn't even a bad person he really just liked spending money he didn't have.  I don't get where you think even most of the cast of survivors are assholes they really aren't.
---
Actual nightmares
---
Even better, in a case like this where you have the opportunity to get behind cover, you could move out of the way and loop the pallet once or twice while all of the other survivors run away.
---
most games I slug at the start and down most of them so it helps
---
Wait how?
---
I slug early game so its very helpful
---
Whispers, but only at level 3 makes it so you never waste time checking empty corners.
---
Corrupt Intervention buys you time to randomly bump into a survivor
---
Hex: Ruin makes it so at least one or two survivors will leave generators and start looking for it. If it is on the other side of the map you can just beeline for it since the odds are good a survivor is already working on it. 
---
Discordance lets you disrupt multiple survivors if they are working on the same gen which is great.
---
Also just walking menacingly at generators might get survivors to scatter even if you don't know if they are there.
---
hey took the post down bc you had to click on it to see the pic posted a new version
---
Depends on how often you want pallets to hit you
---
If you don't have one I'm actually more concerned
---
Hoes mad
---
Under cannibal I find hillbillies the most toxic usually
---
Your joking right?
---
Susie main for killer too, 100% walking you all out after a brief hook tour and some chili
---
Enduring is good especially on an M1 killer like Wraith. However, it can reach its max potential unless it has synergy with another perk in your build. Spirit Fury and Brutal Strength for example.
---
This is one of those cases where it's like building in fortnite. The people who know more nuance to it play the game because of their knowledge and the known additional risks/ decisions that go into looping.
---
Running around stuff around the pallet, and then dropping the pallet, yeah, that's the simplest form of looping. But what about tying pallets in with structure windows? T+L walls, or long wall jungle gyms? How do you run those?
---
If you run a lot of structures individually, they take anywhere from 7 seconds to 15 seconds to deal with on their own. But then there are some cases where good killers (genuinely good) are looped between 3 structures for a good minute or two without a *single* pallet going down.
---
Survivors who know "boring" looping will have spent all those pallets, but a good survivor knows how to read the killer's movements, call out mindgames, and tie together their resources to make them more useful. They'll take hits on top of pallets that are valuable/ in the center of the map and will be more useful when it can prevent a down or extend the loop on a strong structure next to it.
---
There genuinely is a lot more to looping than just running in circles, and a good killer knows how to not mindgame themselves into making them into a silly goofball running circles around the same truck for more than 30 seconds.
---
Keep in mind once pallets go down, they're gone for good. Any windows that come along with them or tiles they're on drop in effectiveness by like 90% once the pallet is gone. So as killer if you force survivors to drop the pallet, even if it costs you a quick stun, it creates a deadzone that can snowball into a deathfield.
---
Nice
---
Same could be said for camping with any one shot down killer, wraith or doc. It's just a part of her power. While it does take longer than waiting out the hook it still has its counters,  such as escaping via hatch with a key or actually losing the killer with the aid of your teammates
---
i...am browsing Reddit while eating shredded cheese straight from the bag at midnight. 💀

Ever since an update, the game has been unable to run on my pc. Literally the only thing that could get me to stop playing on a daily basis. Haven't played it in a month.
---
Devotion.
---
I really like how Myers is the most memed killer even tho he's DLC$$ . I got him cuz my gf was really scared of him, he's fun as hell to play
---
Survivors commonly spawn near one of the 3 farther away gens.
---
Just keep grinding really. Work on gens and try not too hide too much it’s only a game and if you die no big deal. You want to level up your people so you get perks to help you along.
---
I mean you cant possibly make a variety of usefull killers.. you may offend 1000 hour nurses

/s
---
am i..?
---
Ya true although got to say the doctor shock camp is pretty dumb in my opinion cause it really is impossible to save someone when they do that lol
---
BUt LeIGion IS OP

it spooked me, but his little face peeking out is so cute in a weird way lmao
---
I use my phone to snipe 😎 twitch app. Delay doesn't even matter cause it gives me a good idea of where they are.
---
not sure i get why, either. it's not like you can make money off of Reddit posts. 😒
---
Bad teammates = no one ranks up. If someone is going to save you while you're on 55% health on hook and then they pussy foot out cause they hear killer heartbeat, even if you're running DS+Unbreakable there is dogshit you can do.
---
how do you get that mask
---
Im pretty sure the odds of Jigsaw boxes are 50%, with the final box being 100%. Having your power neutralized by a 12s action 50% of the time is extremely fast. Nearly 75% of survivors will remove their beartrap in the time it takes to self care once. That's not much of a stall.
---
Just prestiged Ghostface the other day and got some decent perks at level 11 and ran a game with thrilling tremors, corrupt intervention and hex ruin. By the time the game ended only one generator was done. Those two definitely helped slow the game down.
---
Any tips as a killer? I'm gonna guess its the same.
---
And here we see a flock of toxic megs in their natural habitat
---
How TF did they get 4 stacks by camping? DH has a range you need to be outside of when they’re unhooked for it to work.
---
I do enjoy the game! I get mad when survivors set loops but, valid strat ig. Yeah, maybe I'll be better once this DLC is out.
---
Alright. I'll keep these in mind. Thank you very much!
---
I don’t remember there being two bear traps in that episode lmfao
---
Map pressure. Don't commit to chasing one survivor who knows how to use a strong structure or busted set up.
---
You'd be surprised, even with ruin, how often you can hard stop that initial gen rush by just moving around and hitting like 2 people and maybe downing one of them in the first minute.
---
When you are chasing the first guy, 3 survivors have *nothing* to do besides fix gens. The moment the first survivor goes down or goes on hook, suddenly gen progress grinds to a halt as long as you keep dishing out damage faster than they can work back from.
---
Well dad wouldn’t like that very much
---
I hear you man. Dad sucks.
---
Can you elaborate on how to easily play around good loopers in SWF group?
---
This is why I hate playing against him, he is just too buggy. Normal rules don't apply to him. Sometimes you reveal him, most of the time you don't, and you can try how ever the fuck you want. BHVR overcorrected him after first week of PTB being a fiasco and people revealing him to easily. Now you can watch directly at him and you won't reveal him.
---
It can get pretty frustrating as Killer, I totally agree. I stopped playing killer cause whenever I made a mistake or had a rough game against a swf, I was met with nothing but teabags :,// it seems to be a lot better lately tho
---
I never said that looping didn't have any nuance to it. I just thing it's generally rather annoying more than anything. But I also play nearly exclusively killer, so maybe it's more fun for survivor. I don't know. As a killer it can just get tedious if you aren't playing the killers that have tools to get around looping.
---
It will happen alot less, eventually but when it happens, it just happens. If you escape he'll just smack you and he'll chase any ppl tryna get you off the hook. Trust me, if someone that bought a character is face camping I'm sure their either just an ass or had a bad day/experience
---
New to the game, may l ask what a swf is?
---
You ain’t it apparently
---
Nice troll post
---
&gt; 3 gens in two minutes is fucking insane
---
Fairly common. That's not a bad thing, playing as killer. You either fucked up big time or you had 3 gens that you didn't care about (faaaar off in corners of the map, hard to guard) finished and now the survivors put themselves into a tight spot.
---
It’s survive with friends! When there’s a group of people playing together so they’re all coordinated and communicating.
---
There's no such thing as gen rushing.
---
Lol
---
Simple, kill one of them as quick as possible, momentum significantly slows when there’s only three people
---
I’ve been running a lot of killer lately and I get its frustrating but I just look at it from the perspective of that’s what they’re supposed to do.
---
How dare a group of friends have fun messing around, those pieces of shit must think that its okay to pick on a rank 13 which they must have hacks in order to check. These guys should be banned.
---
Nice blog
---
I'm fucking crying 😂
---
The way traps work is every key for every trap is pre selected. That isn't how it works at all. 
---
It is RNG, but not percentage RNG unless you are doing the math. 
---
Bear trap 1 has key number 1 to open it, key number one could be in any box. Some boxes have more than 1 key.
---
100% sound advice. People getting mad playing killer, asking for gens to take longer or for survivors to have nothing to loop, but these  are all measured things and in every match a limited resources.
---
Ditch chase from a guy good at preserving pallets on strong tiles, get their idiot teammate who will drop that pallet immediately while also taking a hit.
---
I think camping can be done strategically.  Like patrolling the general area of a hook in a clutch moment of the game.  Wraith’s stealth actually encourages campers.  We can’t forget the devs themselves say that camping was an intended way for killers to play the game.  I feel like face camping and hitting the survivor while they’re hooked is what makes camping toxic.
---
So it’s toxic to do the objective? What should they do instead, hide in lockers?
---
I can see that but it’s really annoying and it makes playing Killer both difficult and non-rewarding. Especially when the survivors are the type of people to teabag at the exit gates and call you bad at the end of the match because you don’t have the ability to instant teleport to generators.
---
I haven’t heard it lmao. L I N K?
---
The phrase is doing objectives quickly
---
I’m not saying they should just hide in lockers and stuff, I just feel like everyone in a match having little to no self-preservation and just throwing themselves at the generators because the killer can’t do anything to stop them a majority of the time is really unfun to play against.
---
Here's a guide for your masks:
---
1.Mask with Machete: watch your feet
---
2:Mask with Hatchets: zigzag, break LOS
---
3:Tall boi with Mask and Knife: break LOS as much as possible
---
4:Oinker: watch your back, she doesnt have a heartbeat when crouched
---
5:Crouchy leanyboi: staring contest, make him go poof
---
6:Floaty pillowcase:pray for mercy, stay unpredictable, break LOS
---
Seriously dude, feel free to do gens while I’m chasing someone. That I don’t care about. But doing gens right in front of a Killers face because your toolbox lets you do so is (in my opinion) really frustrating.
---
Maybe just git gud
---
Then try killing them
---
Remember kids "stay outta drugs and do school"
---
I’m ashamed that I have yet to play as Freddy 2.0
---
When I think someone has spine chill (because they're always gone by the time I get to the gen) I start walking backwards to gens. People get so confused when the terror radius gets louder and the perk never goes off.
---
I've been playing this game for a good while. I wouldn't say I'm amazing or anything, I mainly just play for fun and not to win. But I have learned that survivors are much more dependent on perks than killers. As killer, you can run one perk and destroy a bunch of survivors with level 3 decisive, sprint burst, dead hard, etc. etc. (I've done it before). It's much harder for a survivor with no perks to do well in chases. So try to get some handy perks through the bloodweb or the shrine (in the store). Another good tip I've learned is that it's never too early to run. If you're on a gen and see the killer coming or nearby (and they're not chasing someone else), just book it to somewhere safe. It's natural for new players to think the edge of the map is safe but it's actually probably the worst place you could get found. Go somewhere with a reliable pallet that you can use if something goes wrong. That's literally how top-tier players play this game. They just run from pallet to pallet to pallet to pallet to pallet. Then, once the killer is off them, they work on a gen. Something you can do as a survivor to increase your chances of surviving is learning the maps. This will come with experience as you continue playing the game. Maps like Lery's, The Game, Haddonfield, or the numerous Badham's Preschools can be frustrating to navigate and you'll find yourself dying just because you ran the wrong way.  If you can at least memorize where the windows and pallets are in and around a main building on a certain map (say, crotus prenn asylum) you will definitely have an easier time winning. This game is really fun once you start excelling at it and facing better killers. Down at rank 14-20 there's a lot of camping and bad sportsmanship... Oh yeah! And if you don't already know, you leave a trail for the killer to see when you run. So make sure to walk if you want to get away from somewhere and don't want him to find you!
---
I am trying to do that, and that’s not what I’m complaining about. I can kill survivors just fine, the only issue is that in some games the rate at which generators are completed doesn’t even let me do that. The point of killer is to kill, the point of survivor is to survive, but I feel the game should have some kind of equilibrium. The survivors have the chance to survive, but if the Killer is good, they can usually give them trouble. Sometimes the survivors end up being scarier than the Killer because they complete gens so quickly their teabagging you at the exit gates and calling you garbage at lightning speeds.
---
Thx
---
There’s needs to be the ability for each team to be “scary” (scary in the definition of able to win).
---
What you’re saying makes no sense. The survivors are doing gens right in front of you? Then kill them. The survivors are doing gens not right in front of you? Of course they’re gonna, you’re not chasing them.

Legion the killer, he is fucking fast
---
I actually think that could work. You could add Dexter as killer, and Dee Dee as survivor! I can totally see that!
---
You level up quicker at lower levels
---
Game was alive before this lol
---
that would be interesting. i will say, i was talking about dexter from the hbo show (the serial killer who kills bad people).
---
Keeping some progress is fine in my opinion, it should still slowly decay though.   If he 99%'s you at the start of the game, he sure as fuck shouldn't still have me at 99% 5 minutes later.
---
I've over the years played about equal measure killer and survivor. I played killer at the start cause the challenge of it being the "role that was too hard and no one wanted to play" made me wanna see if I could become one of those scary killers.
---
Then after the load of buffs to killers/ nerfs to survivors around spirit's release and every update after, I found killer remarkably easier and less interesting and decided to try becoming one of those "scary survivors" that killers dread.
---
I am not *amazing* at killer, and I am far from being a crazy good survivor. I think survivor has a much much much higher skill ceiling now, because during a chase it's down to your map/ game knowledge to string together a good chase all while also juggling what the killer has up their sleeve (mindgames, chase perks, proficiency in their power or ability to zone/ apply good map pressure) AS WELL AS making sure you're not running into an area where your teammates wasted the resources and make you fuck yourself. (requiring you to pay attention during the match and see where survivors get downed/ see if the killer kicks a pallet before picking them up to know that that area is probably now barren)
---
Playing as killer, unless I'm going against a team that has four good loopers (never ever happens) I do not mind looping at all. In fact I enjoy it on most maps cause it's the survivors giving me a run for my money- am I good enough to play this relatively easy role on hardmode? Do I have enough knowledge or ability to mindgame survivors who can measure up and punish me?
---
If I had to ochestrate every lobby, I'd put in 2 mediocre survivors and 2 god tier survivors in every match. 3 people who know how to run the haddonfield infinites- yeah no thanks if I'm playing my boy Wraith. But like Coal Tower against even 3 really insane survivors is a nice challenge if you're constantly applying zoning/ map control and forcing pallet drops/ catching survivors with their pants down in bad areas they thought they could safely get gens out of the way in.
---
He is locked into one direction and the pig can move freely while dashing
---
Lately I've been getting matched up with red rank survivors when I play killer. I'm rank 16. I don't want to be looped for the entire match. I'm a baby.

Legion is not very fast. Hillbilly yup, spirit ok, but legion is average (the ability really doesn’t make you that much faster).
---
Cuz they're an asshole
---
If it's supposed to stall then why does it kill? They could have just made it so you can't do any repairs or heals with a bear trap on instead of killing after the time is up.
---
And always gotta love being stalked through solid walls.
---
I mean I love the Colton boogie and all but the edit ruins it
---
We're gonna live forever.
---
I mean am I wrong smh
---
But they do need it?
---
That’s fucking hilarious lol
---
Killer is easier now than it's ever been in the history of the game.
---
You're like the one guy in the thread who convinced me you actually know how to play the game lol
---
To be fair though, that scenario *rarely* happens. You'll catch survivors with their pants down quite often. The thing about Bubba is that because he has a chainsaw, each M1 opportunity slightly stings because you wish you could get the instadown.
---
Meanwhile, if you treat him like a regular M1 killer with the ability to like near instantly clear pallets/ create deadzones (getting rid of pallets that aren't near windows will help a ton) you create these large areas that now turn into guaranteed instadowns on other survivors.
---
He's by no means a good killer but you have to employ a whole bunch of fuckery and zoning to get mileage.
---
Normally I tend to switch. Recently I’ve been playing as Hah to get Ruin available to all my Killers, but I’m hoping to play either Ghostface or the Clown. Really I just need general tips, but thank you for attempting to help me out, I really appreciate it.
---
upvoting just because persona 4
---
Calm down, I understand the mindset with running them two, i just don't agree that its optimal
---
Killers like you are my favorite kind ): getting mercy as last survivor or having a nice killer let you leave is the actual best feeling in this game especially when you get stomped for majority of the match
---
They're groovin
---
And get fewer shards.
---
That killer just has to get better.
---
Thanks, I’ll try that. Appreciate the honest words mi amigo.
---
Omg I'm crying 😂 💀
---
Ehh it’s so-so for me. Either side isn’t too difficult but you do need some skill to play them well. A decent player can probably get out of yellow ranks but you do need to know what you’re doing to get much higher. Killer is the exact same, a bad killer will get stomped but a decent one will get to the same general point and hit the same skill block. 
---
To me, survivors only need another objective because gens are getting boring.
---
Neat premise. The whole "fear" thing kinda reminds me of doctor with his insanity. And him being a priest is pretty similar to The Plague who just came out. Overall really nice work putting together the perks especially. Very cool.
---
Sprint burst is good, but the others are better. Like far better.
---
As long as you’re getting 4ks you’re playing the killer properly, they may have just been salty or you might not have been playing the killer the same way that they usually play that killer
---
Fix his whole mask man
---
RISE UP
---
Honestly, even better.
---
Literally the worst thing about the internet.
---
Well general tips can help but the most important thing is learning what your killer is good at, for example a leather face is really good at ending chases quick, but is not so good at stopping gen rushing, where as more movement based killers such as spirit nurse and billy have that potential to shit down gens, ruin is always a good perk to run, if looping is what annoys you, run spirit fury or brutal strength and just take pallets, and the best way I learned was from watching people better then me on YouTube, watch how they react and what they do and compare it to your gameplay.
---
Well, this IS just one game. It happens to everyone. Just move on.
---
Wasn't in any patch notes so I doubt it.
---
Alright, will do. Thanks again dude, hopefully these’ll make my experience as Killer more fun.
---
Maybe a Page? Sounds good for a title for just a chapter with a map.
---
Oh man! This is funny to read! haha! I need some popcorn! ah! hah! people like you crack me up! haha! you just don't understand the dbd culture! haha! thats the joke!
---
just stop.
---
I'm not really good with Nurse. I can land blinks about a little less than half the time in game, and even with that mediocre play, I still get people giving up on me all the time. 
---
Is the Nurse really that much of a chore to play against? I almost never play survivor, so I wouldn't now.
---
No, always 2
---
If that's true it's a big nerf to Demogorgon.
---
If the killer hasn’t been camping, they’re mid way across the map from the door and I’m not on death hook, then I’ll save. Otherwise I’m out

I think a large part of the hitbox being so awkward is the dedicated servers being tested at the same time.

Pig:  dash attacks the tree **hard**.  Proceeds to *run very slowly* toward the scratch marks in the distance.
---
I've only been playing for around 3 months so this is a huge achievement for me after grinding and dealing with the learning curve. And tbh as much as I hated being camped or tunneled in game, it did help me become a better player by learning how to loop better and stay more immersed and get around the killer or hide from them!!

Yeah I can see what you mean. My original plan was to have him pull the spirits out of Survivors, but I wasn't really sure how to explain them getting there in the first place. The priest idea came from the fact that I saw a couple of suggestions of a priest as a Survivor. But I liked the idea of this pious individual being so secretly sadistic.
---
When I settled on the Fear idea, I liked the idea of it being a constant push and pull between the Priest and the Survivors.
---
The perks are definitely my favorite part of the concept.
---
What good does saying that will do? Y'all can downvote all you want but I don't have the super duper perks and I have had 2 days of hard work with nothing to show for it. You're just a jerk that only knows to write that and that's it. -_-
---
This sounds like a guy who played 100 hours of dbd AND watched Samination's video about the "killer rulebook" and decided to make this post complaining.
---
Yo stupid question but how do you crouch with ghostface just like how you would with a survivor??
---
They might be because of NOED tho...
---
He doesn't even mention wich killer or if he canps/tunnel
---
But you’re being told now and you’re still talking down to them - even though the buffs are coming through in probably around a week or so. 
---
MoM was completely busted too - so i’m glad it got spanked by the nerf hammer. You should have tried playing against a 4 man all running it at high ranks, one perk completely tipping the balance of the game needed to be changed ASAP.
---
It's just fun to have the match end as soon as it starts, like the old 3- and 2-man games. 
---
^/s
---
Sounds like a neck beard
---
Scrumptious fingies

&gt;Its tragically survivor sided.

Found the guy who never played Survivior. 
---
In SWF groups. Full 4 man SWF with comms, killers look pathetic. But that's less than 10% of the games players. Almost anything less and the killer has equal/more power. The issue is killers not knowing how to leverage their power correctly.
---
Bubba and pigster both need some seriouse changes

Legion SHOULD be affected by Franklin’s/Sloppy/STBFL because if you take that from him, he would be left with practically nothing of any real value.

No it doesn't.

Isn't it Ochido?

It only stalls if there's like 4 or 5 gens left. Otherwise they can just do gens and leave. The guy with the trap can loop the killer and maintain the timer. 
---
They took most of the "stall" out of her power. Have bad to average rng on top of that? It's just dumb.

Ugh really.... so it's not just me.

Thanks for the info.

"Oi Josuke"
---
If you WANT TO be more courteous  to survivors, then when somebody is being unhooked, go for the person that’s unhooking them. Try to change targets, and not tunnel one person all game.
---
When you hook somebody, roam around the map and try to exert pressure on gens instead of walking within 20 metres of the hooked survivor/camping.
---
Again, up to you. I try to play fair/fun, a lot of people play to win. If you want to tilt people, there’s always franklin’s demise.

And remember, it’s not toxic if you burn party streamers :)

Rarely is Tunnelling not toxic tho

Is it any better on ps4 pro though?

That's why I always bring a mori for them. :)

When I’m paired with players who don’t think things through all the way, and they try to loop me, I can see where they’re trying to go (I’m all ears) and can down them easily. If I’m all ears isn’t activated, then sometimes I’ll have a survivor too eager to win, so I’ll pretend to go around to their side, they jump over, and I catch them off guard

It's too bad they couldn't come up with functional bots for this game (I know it wouldn't be easy, but by my knowledge I don't even know if it would be possible). That way, a bot would just take over in the spot of someone that DC'd. If they made functional bots in Friday the 13th, I would think they could in this game too.

When you do run into a Nurse on console, usually they're really.... *really* good at her. At that point, you don't even DC or even try. You just accept your fate. Any Nurse that's god tier on console is a DBD Killer god. You have to respect it.
---
If they died before getting to the last box, then it was in the last box, obviously. "dc'd or something" riiight... These are some very precise numbers for "like a thousand" and "dc'd or something". You don't know what a controlled test is, do you? It's your math I'm criticising here, not your English, though while we're at it your grammar is poor. Your figures are obvious bullshit, you have clearly have no understanding of what you're talking about. Get in the bin with your first grade bad math.
---
Gen rushing exists.
---
It is that feeling that gens are being done WAY too quickly. Some matches can see 2-3 gens pop in 2 minutes WITH RUIN (see Tru3's recent PTB video).
---
However, Survivors are *NOT* to blame for it. They are simply doing their objective as efficiently as possible. The blame lies with BHVR for making it possible.
---
I believe toolboxes should have a slight nerf, perhaps have their main function changed to make skillchecks easier/less likely; and the time taken for multiple people to repair a gen should be nerfed as follows:
---
2 Survivors - Up to 60 seconds, from 44.44 seconds.
---
3 Survivors - Up to 45 seconds, from 33.33 seconds.
---
4 Survivors - Up to 35 seconds, from 28.57 seconds.
---
This latter issue is the worst. Often, 45 seconds is simply not enough time to stand CHANCE at stopping a gen, especially since that's often the time take to get the first hit in a chase. Plus, without something like Surge or PGTW, you can't really undo the gen progress.
---
Yeah, 'cause Survivors NEVER complain about that!
---
Now, I'm just going home, gotta go through this *tunnel*.
---
Hey look, it's the ptb
---
Lol I’m jealous

Get some scares on Halloween

plunderer's instinct let's you see chests and gives a higher chance of rarer items. its pretty good with ace in the hole, which gives you an add-on when retrieving an item from a chest.

Got no blood points or experience, did I do something wrong?
---
I’m rank 5. She’s not hard to fight
---
Must be a glitch, you should have gotten something
---
Console?
---
On paper, yes.
---
In reality? More Survivors are going beyond the Killer skill-ceiling. Basically, they aren't making mistakes, so everything takes far too long for the Killer.
---
While many of the most powerful Survivor perks have been nerfed, this has made Survivors less cocky (so they are far sweatier and smash gens ASAP) and more likely than ever to bring items.
---
No offense but this is terrible advice. Hiding the instant you hear a heartbeat is probably whats holding you back from getting better.
---
Yeah I got both of those lmao
---
Footnote
---
Lol not what I really do but I felt like a new player would feel intimidated and, with wanting to survive, would make them feel better
---
Bruh Amanda in the movies made her traps inpossible to escape
---
If you need deerstalker then you aren't listening well enough. You should be able to find anyone crawling by proper pathing and hearing the cries. You shouldn't need whispers at all to tell you where people are at because that's what gennies are for. If anything whispers can distract you from being where you need to be because some immersed dude can make you think he is the doing something while his team is working gennies.
---
PC? Cause on PS4, the issue I'm having is that most Green/Purple rank Survivors are so awful that I can't pip reliably as a solo Survivor.
---
Like, they'll be going down so frequently that I can't do gens or totems, for example.
---
Bing-Bong with Coxcombed (or Bone Clapper) and Ghost is scary as fuck too.
---
Literally no side is more toxic than the other, we are one community and can both BE toxic. Just because YOU aren’t toxic on your side does not mean other people aren’t. Just because you see toxicity on the other end doesn’t mean that that side is toxic as a whole. If you are killer or survivor sided, you are only going to see the toxicity coming from the opposite side, unless it’s coming from yourself. Thank you for coming to my ted talk :).

Looks like a bug to me

God bless those cocky Neas!

How is waiting out ds being a dick move? Entitled as survivor I see....
---
He let her crawl to the gate to be a dick and pick her up. He deserved that DS.
---
Omfg
---
I think they'll have to execute some sort of objective rework especially with them potentially nerfing nurse in the upcoming mid chapter patch. They need to make lower tier killers viable :(
---
I think it's a rarity all 4 survivors get out. So how can you justify making it harder again for them?
---
Don’t bring an actually sharp knife to a cosplay event or Halloween though 💀
---
Hello motherf**ker
---
In about two weeks
---
The problem I have with all these extra objective ideas is that some killers just don't need this kind of help at all. Is it really balanced to add all that extra time by default (no perk or anything needed) to a Billy, Nurse, Spirit, Hag, or some of the other killers? Not really.
---
I totally understand that when you play Pig, Clown, Wraith, Doctor, or some of those other killers that the game can go too fast, but creating a base extension to the game time for all killers doesn't seem like the answer to me.
---
No shit, Sherlock.
---
The bait tho
---
So, n00b question. What do those little tendrils mean when they're around someone's icon?
---
What does this prove? Anyone can type shit out on the internet, there is no evidence of these tests. This "data" is unverifiable, but you go on believing everything that you read on the internet.
---
If English isn't your first language, maybe don't go criticising other people's usage of it eh?
---
Wait I thought they didn’t do the thing with traps. That actually happened?!?
---
Because you touch yourself at night.
---
I'm quite new to dbd. Why wouldn't you cleanse?
---
I really like this idea for another gamemode, would be sick.
---
That is actually amazing, if only I was on pc
---
I usually spam LT or m2 on PC to get small speed boosts while in treatment mode, but yeah he's not even op, just annoying to go against if you can't hit skillchecks
---
So I was a rank 17 Killer with a level 1 Nurse on back water swamp... I blink once and suddenly everyone DCs, saying I should get a life because I play Nurse.... Guess I'm not doing my daily then?
---

---
I didn't know his eyes were visible through the mask.....
---
I think the ranking system would need a rework as well if a change like this was implemented. The healthiest way I could imagine would be ranking survivors based on how the whole team performed, instead of individual performances. It would encourage players to gravitate towards certain roles (Looper, Gen jockey, Etc) and use specialized builds that help their role, which would also shake up the meta ever so slightly. Unfortunately, I think the concept is just a tad bit too radically different from the core gameplay of the base game, so a change like this is unlikely at best, but who knows, maybe someone can refine this idea and make a game of their own, maybe give DBD some actual competition for once
---
I mean, plenty of other people confirm that numbers match their experiences, so.
---
If you couldn't read the rest of my message explaining what happened to remaining 6.25%, maybe don't go critisizing my math, eh?
---
Bro, as a fellow vanilla PS4 user, I *highly* recommend going into settings&gt;display and changing it from 1080p to 720p. This is only needed for killer, but fps does improve.
---
No, he likely guessed that she had DS and was the last player, so who else was he going to go after. He was probably counting it out. He was simply waiting for the timer to expire, not being a dick.
---
Yes.
---
I am a survivor main
---
so you're saying that you counter being bad by face camping and not making yourself better at the game? okk

---
If you cleanse, Plague gets Corrupt Purge, a really, REALLY powerful ability in chases.
---
If you don't cleanse, Plague becomes an instadown Killer.
---
People prefer to not cleanse so that she doesn't get her ability and can still be looped. If your team cleanses, you should cleanse too. If they don't cleanse, stay sick
---
Shhhhh.........you didn't see anything
---
my own experience is roughly the same as presented there and many other players seem to agree. I know BHVR said that the keys are put in a random box, but, if many players claim that it's not, well..
---
It's not even MY fucking math, i said going off of my memory about a post that's more than half a year old at this point, that there's a basically 50% chance of the box giving you a correct key. what, you want to say i didn't divide 100 by 2 right?
---
what do you mean sharp?
---
if you rotate the character you can clearly see the outsides of the shoes curve inwards.. just saying..
---
thank you for your opinion without checking first friend. :)
---
As survivor you have much less input vs Nurse. I play both sides and I can tell you, when you vs 'standard' killers as survivor you are almost 100% in control of the chases. Vs Nurse though that no longer applies, and while you can outplay base Nurse for a while some of her addons make her way less fair to play against. Main thing is that survivors are just used to having the upper hand in most chases, Nurse flips the tables on that so hard that it literally feels like a different game to me, and a less fun one. 
---
Though I'm not saying that it's fair for survivors to have so much control vs most other killers, because it isn't.
---

FUCK NO, RED AND PURPLE RANKED DICKHEADS TEND TO BE TOXIC FLASHLIGHT CLICKERS. I'D RATHER LOSE A 15 MINUTE LONG GAME AGAINST SIMILAR RANKS AFTER WAITING FOR 15 MINUTES FOR A QUEUE THAN TO GET IN A MATCH IN 5 ONLY TO LOSE MY WILL TO PLAY THE GAME IN 5

The Director
---
A former producer of snuff films who lured countless victims to their demise promising their "big break" as an actor. He eventually found the biggest fan of his work in the form of the entity. He caries a video camera everywhere he goes to record his killings.
---
Power: Found Footage
---
The director can place multiple video cameras on the ground and monitor any areas they're facing by viewing their feed through the one he carries with him. He can freely pick up and reposition them after setting them up. Once set up, the director can view any of his camera's feeds through the one he carries with him. Any key objects in a camera's view such as chests, gens, lockers, vaulting points, or palletes are blocked off by the entity while the Director is viewing that specific feed. Totems, hooks, gates, and the hatch can still be interacted with if in view. Any survivors caught on camera will also have their aura revealed to him for a short time. If a survivor finds a camera, they can sabotage it, leaving it only able to display static and unable to restrict anything or reveal auras. Cameras can be fixed, but need to be retrieved and repositioned to do so.

This is where the fun begins
---
The devs beg to differ with that statement.  Trashcamp towards a 4K somehow and they'll depip you at higher levels.  How you get your kills does matter in this game.  If you get them in a skilless fashion ie Babycamps and moris and such the game punishes your rank and bloodpoint gain.  Kills alone don't mean a killer knows what they're doing.  This is particularly evident at the high ranks where camping is commonplace and the survivors don't really know what they're doing yet up there to punish it.
---
Aw man, how will Nancy ever taste anything again?..
---
You provided zero description on how or who you played.  This has the vibe of a player that's new to killer and possibly camping and tunneling survivors to deafg who in turn message salt after the fact.  How close am I?
---
you must be a camp magnet then. you see, im not a camp magnet, therefore I get less camping killers in my game. its really just simple science you see. try turning your computer on and off again and see if that fixes it. otherwise its probably genetic... you might be in some deep trouble buddy.

One week of ptb then one week til release

---
Weird but go off I guess
---
That's not how it works, an active trap has to be removed or it will pop at the gates. Any trap placed before gates are powered needs to be removed for a non-hatch escape.
---
I mean, I've heard someone saying we should but a five second charge time on demo and it should  have  a golden of 8 seconds
---
No being soft on killers that DC.  It's a problem on both sides and should be punished as harshly for both equally.
---
Just move your hand, find the way into his heart 🎵

They changed it awhile ago, that isn't simply true anymore. You can leave the trial with an active trap nowadays
---

---
So does anyone know why they keep nerfing Pig? She was weaker than pre-rework Freddy if both used Addons. She is literally D tier, way below everyone else.
---
You literally can't...
---
&gt;such as escaping via hatch with a key
---
So you have to have a rare or ultra rare item to combat it? That's pretty rare to get, especially when you are getting tunelled off hook.
---
&gt;actually losing the killer with the aid of your teammates
---
If the guy playing pig is in any way competent at what they are doing, you will not be able to get away from them.
---
It's a good thing that traps no longer activate after all gens getting powered. Considering that you can now close the hatch &amp; you have to deal with the EGC timer as well as the trap timer, it wouldn't be fair for the trapped person to deal with that.
---
Must have ran into series 1 Steve then
---
Wait is that a JoJo reference!?!?!?!
---
Thank you so much, I love your videos!!!
---
Quentin looks like Jonathan In DbD 
---
          Change my mind
---
In shack I stalk through a gap in the wall and they never know until I rush in and expose instantly :)
---
&gt; fun 
---
For the pig*, the guy getting tunneled off hook with no way to get away would like to disagree. I can see why the devs wanted to change that.
---
nah bhvr will just keep it nerfed and add it to all the other mediocre/garbage perks.
---
Makes sense. His dash is effectively a hatchet throw, same logic applies there probably.
---
I'd guess not, since stbfl doesn't affect Pig's dash.
---
Hey there
---
Amazing cosplay, l love it!
---
alright, finally got it. no addons, no offerings, even had someone dc and still got it. I am satisfied! :)
---
I have a One S. Big sad.

That reveal through walls happens because there is a &lt;&lt;lingering reveal&gt;&gt;. Basically that means that when you are revealing GF if he hides behind a wall he will still continue being revealed by a lingering effect for around 0.4s. Don't know why the did it really.
---
I have +600 games in my steam account, and Dbd has +2000 hrs. I mean, HOW TF did I manage to get 2000 hrs in this game.
---
I give big props to people or teams that can play really well swf with flashlights and everything and they all escape. But when some idiot flashes me and they see I'm not stunned it's just too funny. I down him hook him and wait for the other 3 morons to show up. I've had games when playing Meyers when I  downed all 4 and didn't hook a single person and leave em all there so they can rethink their strategies next time.
---
Just give the pig a shotgun so she can pop some survivors asses
---
I play killers and survivors. Survivors are WAAAAY more toxic.
---
I think I already changed my pants...
---
It's pretty reliable https://youtu.be/fEuf8CnrNuw?t=252
---
And if they move out of the way you can just cancel it with no movement speed penalty.
---
I got merciless like 5 times and still no achievement, I guess you have to hang 3 times all the survivors...

He's the most buggy one, at the very least.

Ohoho I never said survivors weren’t toxic too. But thanks for helping prove my point 😁

Same lol, I always buy games and then don't play them because I just spend all my time playing dbd or siege instead

That's our fragrant sweet William.

damn that meghead got outplayed

Man posting a still of a content creator's video that plays better with the music is a whole new level of low, trashy content made by someone desperate for upvotes.
---
Camping is toxic :( 
---
But so is the entire game of *Dead by Daylight* :)
---
Lots of killers to be honest.
---
Bubba
---
Pig
---
Trapper
---
Doctor
---
Wraith
---
Ghostface
---
Clown
---
Legion
---
All of those are pretty weak in my opinion.
---
I'm toxic, because I'm commenting on your post disagreeing with you? The post you made about how everyone but you is toxic? You think it might just be you projecting a little hmm?
---
Adam has only 2 skins an he is in game since many months and one of his skins has broken shoes? Seems like BHVR hates Adam.. the coolest survivor in my opinion gets not love.. and Dwight has 500 outfits..  cool
---
Part 1 in intentional.
---
Part 2 should depend on the surroundings (if he blocks vision by strafing or crouching it should stop the reveal otherwise not).
---
Part 3 might be similar to Myers tier 1 but I don't think they did that so could be bugged.
---
Part 4 is just bugged or server issues, never had it happen to me (also, he only needs to see the slightest sliver of survivors so maybe he just only barely sees you from behind a wall?)
---
Except Second Chance disappears when downed.
---
Nope. Only the main weapon for Killers get the Prestige treatment. So no bloody bear traps, hatchets and whatnot.
---
Noed on Hag bro?
---
Of course there are some toxic killers, but toxic survivors are waaaay more frequent and worse. And that’s a fact.
---
*ignorant
---
Also, never said survivors weren’t toxic
---
Killers or the players
---
This looks like a rap video still shot
---
Morons will say that it doesn't exist but it does. It's essentially the same as tunneling when you think about it. Both can suck from a fun perspective but make sense to do in most cases when playing to win.
---
Wake up was in the shrine not to long ago.
---
Tried her out yesterday using the offering and it went terrible, she can literally do nothing vs survivors, I constantly got blocked, looped and swarmed with flashlights, she is completely helpless against this.
---
Nurse is so weak I can 360 her and she's easy to juke and I'm a rank 21 with 5 hours so yeah...
---
Cause dwight is mathieu ingame. Ofc he gets a special treatment. Meg, dwight, jake and claudette modelled after some key developer
---
Most Killers have a strategy to counterplay them. Once you know what they are, the game becomes much easier!
---
Honestly 90% of the people I go against or play with are pepega and so the circumstance they were talking about.   
---
And yeah Bubba is REALLY good at abusing dead zones so on certain maps like asylum where everything out of the main building is shit 90% of the time he's good as well as like sheltered woods where there are a shit ton of unsafe pallets. Other than that Bubba just suffered from chase AND map pressure because modern and good killers tend to be pretty damn good at one of those
---
Could work like a shuffle. You turn into a different killer everytime you hook someone? Or depending on who you chase like you turn into Freddy when chasing Quentin and you can use Freddy's abilities to a certain extent.
---
Or you could have add ons that determine which killers you can turn into at will. But then there would have to be somekind of ability for survivors to turn you back into Pennywise like when  revealing Ghost Face and while just Pennywise you can only M1 and have limited speed.
---
Silly noed gamer, that wasn't very Country Roads of you.
---
If they don’t add his gear from season 2 when he’s in the tunnels I’m gonna be sad
---
thank you haha
---
LOL dude you’re actually out here attempting to claim you aren’t toxic yet you’re commenting stuff like this over and over again just to keep a pointless argument going lol gg bro top notch job proving my point for real
---
Maybe he turns into a survivor or object and tries to make the survivors seperate from each other in case one of them is IT.
---
Could’ve use a different tag but gotta respect the hustle homie tryna get some views gotta advertise where he sees fit
---
This actually lifted my mood. Thanks for not getting angry and not taking this too seriously. I just got mad because I just played against a killer that tunneled a Meg the whole game and accused us of gen rushing.
---
It's a shame you rarely get to hook them because they DC
---
I love the Doctor one. I will definitely buy this skin.
---
I agree. I dont know why these people are pitching a nerf and im a survivor main who hates going against this killer
---
Great work, as always c:
---
But you literally just... Nvm fam u rite
---
You can leave with traps..? I only started like two months ago and when I left I died thanks to the trap. Needed since then I guess?
---
I have two pet peeves.

If you don't mind me asking, where tool/website did you use to make the tierlist?
---
Dimmuborgir
---
Nah, thats the only redeeming quality he has. Change that and he's down there with bubba and legion
---
I'll usually try and find the totem, dont particularly care if I get out or not.  As long as it was a fun game.  Much more satiafying to be the martyr and get that other person out.
---
I honestly called it they'd nerf cruel limits and surge when they showed the perks. They were actually balanced perks imho but BHVR being BHVR, they gotta nerf shit.
---
Actually, Diversion should be buffed to work similar to a firecracker. You throw and blind/stun the killer if he is not fast enough to react. Nothing op, just a slight buff.
---

Wait...
---
More like she can't taste Jonathan's DICC!
---
What rank are you dude?  I rarely ever see anyone bring items, let alone actually good items lol.
---
I'm thinking maybe a passive sound effect that plays at random like Myers tiering up, Plague getting a fountain, skill checks etc to startle survivors. Maybe have add ons that play survivor injured noises when near hooks (can pair well with blindness perks He could do something involving balloons that could act like motion sensors. He could have a charge power that lets him float above the ground at faster than normal speed so he could go over short loops and have map pressure.
---
That perk where every Survivor starts on a hook isn't good enough.
---
They'd have to start with the Entity Summoned or they could just Kobe off.
---
No need to repeat, i do know this subreddit. But its always surprising me that the first thing people think of when they see a spikey or slimey hole is ''dont...''
---
I’d run sloppy butcher instead of spies from the shadows and thrilling tremors instead of I’m all ears
---
Great meme 10/10
---
Your Perks are trash.
---
Iron Grasp is just bad, hooks are everywhere. Only useful if you want to use the basement often.
---
NOED is only useful when you want that all gens are complete.
---
Spies from the shadows is also not good. It's useful for tracking as beginner, but if you are good, you don't need it.
---
I'm all ears is nice for mindgames and especially nice for the nurse. On ghost face it's "ok"
---
Thank you for honoring my main with this drawing
---
God I hope they release the ash cosmetic fast
---
I did that and turned noed into whispers as another comment suggested
---
Do bones next game, nerd.
---
Considering queue times for killer and bloodpoint generation with a killer without desirable perks, this must have been a huge time investment
---
Good thing progress carries over!
---
Nah only use Whispers if you have it at tier 3. Until then use noed instead.
---
The reason I posted, I'm terrible at DbD and looking for advice
---
THIS IS GOD NOW
---
I fucked the quote up didn't i?
---
Didn’t you read the post? I don’t want to “cleanse rush.” 
---
Thanks for the feedback though. Take an upvote
---
You know you can not to care right? Just go and chase another person. I get a lot of flashlight clickers and tbaggers in my games, it's a clear signal ' don't chase this guy and find someone else's'. It's like snake rattling her tail. Leave him last or when most pallets are gone. It's better to get 3K when to facecamp one guy and 'teach him a lesson'.
---
It's currently tier 2, I'll change it back out to noed until I get tier 3
---
Re: Confirmation bias
---
"Baby Steve is and Nancy is" lmao
---
They need to fix some things like lunging at someone downstairs tending to miss and the pallet breaking when using Red Moss but other than that we got a solid killer.
---
I used to be a pig main but after all of that bullshit..not anymore.
---
top 10 anime betrayals
---
If I see that a guy relies a lot on pallets instead of just loops I go after him to get pallets out of the way. Had a guy drop like 9 or 10 of them, really bad resource management.
---
Just get a thin black paper for the floaty bits and attach small helium balloons at the end bits :D
---
I don’t feel disgusted
---
If the killer is at high ranks it's pointless anyway since everyone has Borrowed Time and Decisive
---
Dirty foreskin
---
This is funny, and I'm a low rank killer main. I love it, made me smile within seconds.
---
Btw Gen Rush is a tactic that anyone can use, but It should at least involve brand new parts. 
---
Ignore salty killers and just do your thing. He's just upset that he doesn't have the perks he wants and doesn't have the skill to play without them.
---
Aw thanks man. Thank you for not taking it seriously. I’m just being salty. 
---
Have a great day bro
---
I went against a good nurse ONCE. Thomas had never seen such bullshit before.
---
Ah, didn't saw the pic fully, u don't have nice perks so you can't use them. You should use sloppy butcher
---
Yeah but you get props for being funny.
---
Thanks, that was my objective. If I’m going to be salty I might as well make it funny.
---
well, thanks for your very important input in this discussion and general helpfulness in proving that pigs traps are, indeed random and not a 50/50 chance, anyway.
---
Haddonfield can spawn infinites with balanced landing. That's the only TRUE infinite left though. Asylum honestly might as well be treated as an infinite as even a bad survivor can hold a killer 2mins there and a good can easily loop the place 4 mins

---
BBQ Chili let's you see Auras over 40 meters after you hook a survivor and Ruin makes it so that good skill checks on a generator stop progress for a couple seconds and greats don't provide any bonus.
---
Hah. I try to give good and fun survivors the hatch,until they loop me for days and then dstrike me.
---
Then complain about noed after a game where they had 3dstrikes.
---
Ah I see, thank you
---
Kind of looks like the Konosuba intro dance.
---
Maybe not reset but rather tick down. Would propably have to start earlier instead of 45 seconds.
---
Soon as I started getting good with her the developers gutted her kit. I don't know why they decide to just relentlessly Beatdown mid-tier killers so people have to play nurse or hillbilly and spirit
---
If the Trap hasn't been activated you can just leave through the exit gate. It used to kill you when you would try to leave. You can also go through the hatch door even while it is active and it won't kill you.
---
0:19
---
High how are ya?
---
Imagine tryna do a gen and you get time stoped and a knife yeeted into your throat
---
She used to be one of the only mid-tier killers that was viable at high ranks but now she's pretty much worthless.
---
Oh, I definitely do this on the rare occasion this person is better than me. That doesn't change that this is only a legit strat because it's actually toxic.
---
I main Ghostface and this is like 85% inaccurate.
---
It's taken from the video of "ExperimentBoy", a French Youtuber that often makes microwave ovens explode or shots on dolls with golf balls. This is from his last video where he basically destroys a doll in one shot.
---
Well because she used to be viable Beyond Rank 10. I guess the developers don't like anyone playing a killer Beyond nurse Spirit or hillbilly at the high ranks. Just be all of the mid-tier killers into the ground until they are D or F tier.
---
**Cough** Doc, Pig, Trapper, Clown, Wraith, Pig Pig and Pig**
---
And then you have moments where I’m looking at GF and he’s crouched looking at me for a solid 3 seconds and I’m still marked.
---
Yeah. The traps used to kill you no matter what if you tried to leave. Now they have to be active. Don't worry though you can still leave through the hatch with the Trap while it's active.
---
Don‘t have a link, but a BHVR member said this in the official Dead by daylight Discord server (there was a channel extra for st questions)
---
Thanks ! &lt;3
---
Yeah. Say for example if the last generator is done... Putting a trap on a survivor's head will do nothing to stop them. They can just freely leave. They can also take the trap door while the Trap is active.
---
&lt;33333
---

---
Thanatophobia and Ruin are pretty much required due to how slow her power works.
---
Dying Light seems like it will be amazing on her after its rework; You slow the game down more and more and they can't be healed anyway due to being broken.
---
Yeah. You have about a time limit of three generators to get traps on everyone otherwise they'll be useless. Also even if the Trap is active people can still leave through the trapdoor. I've seen four people with bear traps on Escape through the hatch because they found a key
---
Cleanse rushing is toxic and should be bannable.
---
Nearleh*
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
The difference is that a multiplayer like this (or Moba, FPS etc etc) require less dedication. And not in the "it's Easy to play sense" but that in a realtively short time i get more satisfying experience (in theory).
---
I'm sorry bro for ya :/
---
Posts on the internet =/= Confirmation
---
Chest rushing is bannable /s
---
Nurse and spirit are the only viable killers at rank one where you're guaranteed to get at least a Kill if you're good. The main reason why they're the only viable Killers is because developers are too afraid to make a new good killer. They are all mid-tier and getting nerfed into the ground anyway. For example the pig was viable at high rank if you are really good at the game but now she's probably D tier
---
Discordance, pop, infectious fright, ruin/corrupt intervention. Best plague build for rank 1 from a plague main. Search for fungoose on YT and see it in action.

Of course ! I didn't release the Stranger Things Chapter yet but i can't get the link of the last version i released

Thanks you a lot ! &lt;3

Thanks &lt;3333

Change Iron grasp for sloppy butcher. You dont need IG but you need something to slow down the game
---
Not an easy kill because they're still multiple survivors left at the exit gates open. They're supposed to stall the survivors. And it's one of the only things that made Pig viable. She's very easy to Loop and her Ambush is useless due to the fact that she Roars incredibly loudly before even beginning to Lunge.
---
It's not just an easy guaranteed kill. It's supposed to stall survivors. I find it incredibly stupid that they can just leave through the exit gate with a reverse bear trap on their head or even go through the trap door while the Trap is active.
---
She was a mid-tier killer. Quit acting like she's a unbeatable monster with pre Nerf reverse bear traps. Nobody was complaining about the pig and desperate for a Nerf.
---
Her endgame build was pretty fun and you missed the fact that the traps are inactive while being chased. 
---
**If she forced a Survivor out the exit gate with the reverse bear trap on their head it wouldn't go off pre patch. It was not a guaranteed or easy kill. You still had to down them and hope they didn't get it off with the first key. I repeat. It would not go off if you force them out the gate. It would stall them while you down the other survivors and hook them. Turning a match where you get a 1K into a two or three if you played smart or the survivors choked at the end**
---
How often do you actually try to unhook yourself?
---
What will allow me to import future killers and survivors into the game for one.
---
It will also allow me to show case future cosmetics for them in future DbD releases through data mining.
---
And if me and myers get the map working, future gameplay testing of unreleased content.
---
If you ask a survivor main... anything really. Camping, tunneling, moris, not giving someone the hatch... you know... being a killer.
---
The most toxic stuff is usually in post game chat. Word of advice, don't engage anyone who says abusive things. Just leave and don't respond, don't read, just go. People want to get a rise from you. Deny them that salt. It's what they want. 
---
It's what plants crave.
---
What does P3 mean?
---
Ok. This sounds amazing
---
Good luck u guys
---
Because the pig dash is bit harder to dodge the demogorgon goes straigth line while the pig can turn during the dash
---
Factorio says hi.
---
When all of the generators are powered the Trap should always be active. I agree that the Pig camping the hook was bullshit but any killer can camp the hook. Thanks to Insidious or stealth killers. The Trap didn't go off while she was chasing you and didn't do anything besides give extra points. Any smart team would leave so that person could take the hatch. Or they would take a hit or use borrowed time.
---
There are many counters to it and unfortunately people will always camp in this game. It's nothing we can do anything about it because it's a play style. Still means everyone else is probably going to get out just fine.
---
Her power is meant to stall. It should stall people from leaving. Have a trap on someone's head so you can chase another Survivor without worrying about one of them leaving. Unless they find the trap door because that's always been a guaranteed get away against the pig with a trap on your head.
---
And one more thing. I want to reiterate. If she forced you out the exit gate the Trap would not go off. She couldn't chase you out or place you on the ground while you are in the dying State and have the Trap go off. The easy fix would have just been having the reverse bear trap still being active while she is crouched and following you or near you. Easy fix without getting her power and it's endgame potential.
---
This is one of the main reasons I changed it to one of my mouse buttons.
---
Thank you and good point I should list what this means for us as a community.

You could just turn it off.

Have any tips? I've stood on the opposite side of a pallet looking straight at him, and he's exposed me. I'm struggling with figuring it out, so anything would be helpful.

I would just like a window animation for a 'nerf'

I wouldn’t mind but don’t you see the red stain teleporting from one side to the other of the window?

You disconnected dude.

I can tell because if you did 2,1/2 gens you would not have less than 2k blood points so it is obvious you disconnected.

I wish minimal effort content like this and 99% of those lazy ass macro memes wasn't allowed, but it seems like the mods on this sub prefers quantity over quality.  
---
They only go as far as to say, "If the title is the only thing relating the meme to DBD, don't post it."  
---
If the macro is the only thing relating the meme to DBD, though, then that's totally fine and you might as well go guns blazing and post like five a day.  
---
The craziest part of it is the fact that the mods are hypocritical about the "unrelated content" rule, because if your lazy meme, which is only related to DBD via title, somehow makes it to the front page of the sub, it's totally fine, despite breaking the rule.

And don’t even get me STARTED... on the corn...

Actually good point, bad Killers are used at lower ranks where new players are likely to be and BHVR listens to flood of "nerf Freddy and Pig".
---
When I started, I initially thought Freddy was top tier because he was invisible and always saw you if you were far away from him in dream world. I also thought Nurse was very bad because a new player tried her in my first encounter. I of course didn't form my initial thoughts as facts and complain to devs about what I think is too strong or not when I spent 3/4 of each match Urban Immersion-ing*
---
Yeah I main survivor. I have been playing this game for 3 months and have only played as killer like 2 times.
---
I hate it when other survivors are toxic. I’m just trying to have fun, not ruin someone else’s day.
---
If your not gonna be helpful go away. I made this post for help
---
when is stangers things dlc out for xbox?
---
That would encourage camping. People would feel a lot less comfortable leaving the hook If he knew you were about to yeet yourself off of it at any time you choose. Plus that would be a nightmare for altruism of everybody started kobe-ing all the time. It should stay at 4%
---
I even struggle with whispers and I'm a red rank killer main. It is a perk that requires a fair amount of skill, and can help even without knowing techniques on how to use it. 
---
For example, you can know whether to stay at a gen or not waste time searching for someone who's not even there.
---
🤢🤢🤢
---
On my ghostyboi I run Thrilling Tremors, Ruin, Whispers and Corrupt Intervention.
---
As far as the addons go I normally always run chewed pen, getting your NS back quicker is better than having 2 pink addons imo and the surveillance camera works best when your in NS and secure the down
---
Pigs have got to be the scummiest killers so  keep nerfing her for all I care :p
---
Because dememememgrogel is many money for BHVR and they like the many money so they make gooder killer heheheh rich. 
---
Enlish is my first lengigue.
---
I came here for help, if your gonna criticise me go, away
---
The percentile can be increased with certain offerings and perks, but even then I think the max you can get it is %12? %16? It's really not worth trying unless you're goofing around/not playing seriously or you're using Deliverance.
---
Nice 360. Wish I could do that :(
---
It was incompatible with the new end game mechanics.
---
Clearly he should hook everyone in perfect order! I had a killer earlier hook one survivor 3 times before the others were hooked twice. He must have miscounted!
---
Okay kid, think whatever you want.
---
Yeah. Most of the time it's new players who are displeased with the fact that they lose initially. It has to mean the Killer is totally overpowered and broken. And then the developers will panic and instant Nerf that killer.
---
 I mean the best of the best like nurse and spirit are the only viable ones that high rank but survivors still have an 80% Escape rate at rank one. That certainly says something about how Freddy or Pig would be treated at that rank. 
---
I mean the best advice I can give for balancing the game is make everyone at BHVR play perkless Pig against rank one survive with friends on comms. See how they feel about her balance after that. That will probably also help them solve the DC issue for the killer side lol. That most advice I can give about the survivors disconnecting though. Most Killers have a hidden power where the first person they down loses internet I guess
---
It really be like that somerimes
---
Lately it’s been all positive for me nothing but ggs with some toxic in-between it’s weird lol I’m use to 99% toxic
---
Remember Pearl Harbor and do a proper tier list, [like this](https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/killers/).
---
I bought Diablo thinking it was first-person once.
---
The only character I've played ATM is Claudette because when I first started I thought self care was a must have because at rank 20 no one would heal me, I regret it but may as well get her to 40 now because I'm only a few levels away from unlocking self care for all. Then I'm not sure who to use tbh maybe meg for her spring burst? Or Dwight for bond not sure what I personally would use more. Maybe even king for more BP. So many choices haha
---
Yea i dont think its op either but it’s definitely a good tool for loop stopping.
---
I notice the same thing; I’ll start playing about 6pm EST everyday, but past 10pm it gets progressively more toxic. I can’t even play on the weekends anymore with how bad it is
---
I really been playing this all day for a week or more. Only have 118 hours tho
---
Tru dat
---
I have a ridiculous backlog thanks to this game
---
 I have this and Rocket League. I almost never have time for any other game.
---
For me it's the opposite. When I play late at night, I can get into lobbies near instantly when I'm playing killer, and the games are usually pretty chill cuz I'll get matchmade with the same few people for like 7-8 matches in a row. But that's just my experience.
---
Just saying it was very satisfying after the way the killer played, is all
---
New creepy pasta
---
Well played, good sir.

I just downloaded Darksiders 3 and I’m really contemplating getting Catherine Full Body but I’m also like “I need to grind BP for Demogorgon”

I've been playing for 3 years but only joined this reddit a month ago. Like many of you, my mind is blown by the existence of the term "Gen Rush". Its synonymous with "playing the main objective of the game correctly". It should be the only thing every single survivor across the entire player base does, up until they're spotted/chased, or someone is hooked. I'm so glad this post exists, I thought I was crazy.
---
Did I ever say she she's a unbeatable monster? Relax man just saying my opinion on it. That at the end of the game the reverse bear trap is a guaranteed kill pretty much unless the survivor either gets super damm lucky or you as killer mess up. Not much they can do to get that trap off with you following them. But hey opinions opinions and I respect yours. Although the ambush shit is pretty dumb she should not scream before it goes off or at least make perks work with the ambush. I fully believe she needs a buff but I totally understand why the devs did what they do for the traps did they take it to far ya prob they could have just made it so the end game timer pauses or takes longer.
---
Killer dc
---
Julie is standing clamping her legs around Joey from the back and holding onto his shoulder, Susie is just kinda flopping around since Joe is only holding her behind her back and she's got her arms wrapped around him

OH I thought he was saying the higher you go the better the payout (which honestly should be true on some level)
---
Also Legion in Feral Frenzy. Or Huntress' hatchets.
---
Am i missing something?
---
I totally agree with you. Maybe they should nerf Trapper, pig, wraith, and every other killer. Oh and make it so survivors have a bulit in flashlight. And that insta gen is a thing
---
Lol I've never come across an issue on steam
---
If you're talking about ranks,it's because PTB matchmaking doesn't care much about ranks since there's not many people.

Uh repost.

One perk is powercreep survailence. The ability us trash and can be countered by swf.  The other two perks suck.
---
It's gonna be OP, calling it now
---
I only managed to get time in on release day playing with him on KYF against viewers but that is a really cool build idea. I enjoyed pallet-eater demo too.
---
Ye, it's a logical fallacy in itself. If survivors would truly 'genrush' as in, do exclusively nothing but work on gens, which includes not ever healing or unhooking other survivors, they would very obviously perform WORSE than when actually playing the game in all it's facets (since every hook would be a dead survivor). So, if survivors are indeed 'genrushing', they're helping the killer and a killer would have even less reason to complain about.
---
Imagine thinking doc is too strong.
---
OP, youew brown rank is showing.
---
Amigo the game has had consistent around 20K players the last several months lol, what you on about?
---
Only five minutes? Toxic
---
I only started playing DbD recently (last 2 months) and all interactions I’ve had after games on Xbox are positive! I’m glad I play on Xbox and not computer are all the toxicity I’ve read about!
---
You don‘t? I think you‘re missing my point. If he didn‘t want to get hit by DS then why did he pick her up 20 seconds before it was inactive? It looked like he just wanted to troll her and pick her up and hook her. My opinion.
---
Wait, that's not a wraith teachable???
---
Bully time
---
Yes because we have enslaved by entity
---
Seems necessary, unless you want survivors to troll you at every pallet. You're gonna get smacked everytime you try to decloak near one, might as well get it out of the way quickley.

No what I'm saying is that if there's a cosmetic that is only Auric Exclusive, it has to come with a bloody alternative that you can only use if you prestige that level of item. Why I said it was unpopular is because many would probaly just rather more cosmetics then bloody versions of already done cosmetics.
---
bad assumption.
---
Ah gotcha sorry
---
A majority of survivors don't give killers a free kill, so why would killers give survivors a free escape?
---
That is a non sense in that case the surv rate is of 100% because there is no deaths in red ranks

It's amazing how you completely forgot to think how it would turn out in-game. Cuz that's what almost all user-concepts seem to forget.

Bigger maps would be way too much work for the devs. And while custom game modes would be fun, they dont have the people to release a new gamemode, fix bugs and balance issues, and release a new chapter.
---
This was a super old bug, like the killer model swap one. It was a blast to play when it happened.

Doing the main objective as survivor is seen toxic? Some parts of the community hasn't grown up the past year it seems.

This used to happen with Ace's shoes as well.
---
It hurts when you eat
---
Ask those survivors were playing?
---
So I really have to explain it to you. NO not "every" game gets easier with communication. In this game communication is key. So it is totaly understandable Killers complain about it. Imagine the Entity would whisper into your lovely ear where Survivors are?! Wait
---
Yes it was, was so fun. Kind of wish they would bring an event for this to come back, with two killers and more Genies!
---
All those survivors were playing?
---
Same with me but I also play Friday the 13th
---
The demogorgon is honestly the only killer that has scared me for a long time. It's pretty damn intense when you get chased.
---
I find most of the time it gets broken while survivors look for ruin. I can get at least 3 tokens most games.
---
30-50% is a little over a second while leaning, even less than a second if you're leaning with add-ons. Revealing takes over a second. It isn't like if you reveal him your stalk or exposed goes away.
---
i remember this being a thing back in the day. would be cool to have a large mode. 2 killers vs 8 survivors. bigger map and more gens needing to be done.
---
Wow, i didn‘t even think of that but it doesn‘t matter. To me it looked like he wanted to be an asshole (especially cause he’s nodding at her) and that‘s it.

Jeff: you will have my beer 🍺

Ik I’m a nea main and that’s what I do best
---
Not that I'm a pig main but if they fixed Franklin's  with her lunge and allowed her to see her own jigsaw boxes this would fix a lot I think.
---
I'm also in support of making the trap have to come off before you can escape. It's an end game strategy for her
---
Remember back then when insta blond was wayyyy faster
---
Crouching is half the default walk speed.
---
Urban evasion doubles it.
---
If the walk speed is doubled, the urban evasion speed or the default crouch speed is NOT increased.
---
I just want to clear this up.
---
Wish this could be a mode 2v8 with 10 gens
---
Guys it is obviouss the Killer already experienced DS in this game. ONE OF THE MOST USED PERKS. Obviously he knew she will get out. Every sane person would have tried to get her at the last possible second. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. It's just sad to see the KILLER can't do anything in life about it and has to hope for her to fail this tremendously easy skillcheck.
---
is it normal to receive an steam update when you opt in and out ?
---
This happened to me and my 3 stack and our random a few weeks ago. Literally every time he random tried to open the hatch for us this happened and he was forced to just sit there and be downed. It cost all of us the game.
---
It was a kill your friends game
---
I once had a survivor message me before the game started trying to say that he'd cash app me $100 to not kill him. But yeah, toxic messages when playing killer are fairly common on PS4.
---
There are perks for the killer that specifically affect one player called the obsession. They might be perks that make it easier to find or slow the obsession down. Survivors can run perks that benefit them more than others but increase their chances of being the obsession. With those claws/pincers move that means that the obsession is being chased. Overall you don’t really want to be the obsession.
---
I got a message just a couple weeks ago where the person was so pissed that I had NOED, he sent me a very graphic and disturbing photo. I went to private after that.
---
Pig is still high mid tier if you know how to use her dash it just sucks that she keeps getting really random nerfs that no one asks for.
---
Sniper Doc: Interview tape + electrode with Thrill + Ruin/Devour hope.
---
No more are your totems in danger.
---
You have to be apart of the survivors. All 4 have to escape through hatch within a certain time period, one after another is the safest(may be required) route. It's pretty easy to get when you play swf
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABYnqp-bxvg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABYnqp-bxvg)
---
This is probably the most rewarding thing in the game. I'll take an instant NOED shutdown over escaping.
---
*Early DC'ing intensifies.*
---
same! Played since it was included with PS plus.
---
Fixated. Urban makes you crouch at the speed of normal walking, while fixated increases the speed of normal walking by 10%. So fixated will be 10% faster than urban evasion
---
I specifically tunnel survivors who farm their teammates. I played survivor a few time and seeing myself get farmed really pushed me over the edge.
---
Best killer for the Swamp map
---
Obviously your messing up by getting 4ks. Who do you think you are, killing the survivors?! They’re SURVIVORS, they’re supposed to live.
---
This why I run spine chill lol that would never happen
---
He can’t see the DS timer so he waited till the last second he could to pick her up. That’s not trolling.
---
You have my ebony mori
---
It’s the best of both worlds for me on console, no super toxic post game chat, but if someone is angry enough to Dm me then I just get satisfaction of how much of a pleb they are
---
I wasnt serious about hating you... oof.  
---
But I actually LIKE the aura link reveal. It works with my "uber bait" playstyle.
---
He could stop tunneling.
---
Honestly Trapper just having all his Traps start off as set wherever they randomly spawn would be enough to turn him into a higher tier killer, and I have no idea why it's not like that already. Sure most of the time they won't be in important places, but the randomly placed ones can often be the most effective, and the disarms can tell you where survivors are early on.
---
Was there something else to do for him? Except going in a corner and cry?
---
You said he can‘t do anything. I told you what he could do. Simple.
---
Yes, matches became pure chaos. I think the record for this bug was like 20 survivors in one match.
---
Oh ok. I'm a red survivor main and I have games all the time where the killer is losing really bad and he kills all four of us with noed
---
Still
---
That actually sounds like hysterical fun.
---
TAKE MY MONEY
---
The other day he was standing out in the open and three of us (or at least 2) were staring directly at him, and he still got me exposed. Was super bullshit.
---
My favorite kind of ghost face player. So much fun!
---
Please pardon me, I am getting fairly tired and being the lazy person I am, I can't be fucked reading it. I do believe the idea is great though, especially because it seems to go into good detail from examining the length. 
---
Making a TL;DR for more than a few paragraph length posts would be ideal for people like me. If I can summon enough brainpower I might read it. If not, tomorrow it is.
---
Take my upvote nonetheless, I hope to read it when I can.
---
I hope Claudette means the one with leaves...

If you want a regular fun killer, get Legion.
---
If you want a decent killer, get Plague.
---
If you're a fucking sadist troll, get Doctor.

Will check it out, ty!
---
I hope the vanilla gameplay thing they’ve been testing ends up being the ranked or “try hard” playlist. Sometimes I wanna buckle down and sweat but it’s no fun if no one else is doing it.
---
It's not necessarily bad, but it's a pretty likely scenario that while Corrupt is active, the survivors will look for and almost certainly find &amp; cleanse ruin. It's probably better to run Corrupt &amp; PGTW (this would be my choice, ruin is very luck based  whereas corrupt gives you the chance to build momentum before generators start popping off) or Ruin &amp; PGTW.
---
Supplies, motherfucker.
---
This is hands down the best survivor cosmetic they've added so far. It's so good!

You need to stop taking everything so damn seriously. It's a game, it's meant to be fun and there is no point in limiting so there can't be duplicate survivors in a lobby just so the lore will be perfect
---
Would have been cooler if you had lunged through through that window (yes you can do that and it's super hype)
---
I fully agree, however i feel that they could use some more stat based buffs, while i feel these two need som more significant changes to what they do, maybe legion also needs some significant changes, and i think trapper is fine hes like normal good

Where was the other guy?

Secret twins.
---
Np, happy to help!
---
Honestly with that stupid Roar it does before she even starts to Sprint... I could see that being viable. But unfortunately it's a glitch. Like Huntress getting instadown hatchets and the hatchets going through multiple survivors
---
"Oh hiya, whatcha up to? Oh, you're trying to fix a gen? Aw that's okay, I just wanna stibbity stab ya!"
---
Don't know why but that was the first thing that popped into my head.
---
Yeah how dare people rather play against people who aren't telling them to commit suicide. /s
---
Nice bait.
---
Survivors:
---
An "infinite" is defined by it's ability to render the Survivior impossible to catch. No loop does this
---
Yeah. All of the traps are normally just in the most inconvenient and out-of-the-way spots. He would honestly be a solid killer if he just started with all of them. But then the developers would have to rework his add-ons and that's too hard I guess
---
i just want it to feel like the SAW movies
---
changing the rules of the game
---
Ffs. Baso he has a ‘clouded’ effect on survivors after they leave the gas for ‘x’ seconds. With this they cough more at the start and less at the end of the effect, they maintain the blurred vision but lose it over time and have a x% slowness on all actions other than running. This eliminates stealth and slows the game down. Basically he can effect them outside a chase when he gasses them and can now leave them. The effect passively disappears. Now he’s not just chase dependent and less obsolete. :)
---
Is this only an option on ps4? I’d like to stop receiving messages after almost every game i play as killer
---
The entity
---
Doctor bc doctor is doctor
---
Slow add ons are amazing on him
---
the key to being a successful killer is being able to gain momentum quickly. Leatherface is one of the worst killers as he struggles getting that first momentum swing. This is more about leatherface being bad than survivors being "too powerful"
---
cute
---
Whoever told you that she’s the worst is wrong, if it makes you feel better.
---
&gt;note for those guys:

*sad wraith main noises*
---
Giving a game a higher skill ceiling and ensuring that at the highest level of play in that ceiling would be balanced is good for any game.
---
Because the developers have this "we don't need every killer to be strong" mindset they might as well lock out certain killers when you get into red ranks. Wraith and bubba are so laughably weak you can load up a game against good survivors and lose before the game even starts
---
If devs balanced for higher level play then the rewards for getting good with a killer would be "you're allowed to still have fun in red ranks with this killer because you've mastered them" instead of "lol it's just a game bro just play nurse or spirit gg baby killer ez"
---
I want this pleeeease. Looks like it could be so much fun!
---
Even if you win against nurse it's not because you did something right. it just means the killer fucked up
---
I play on xbox and its the complete opposite for me. Once in a while ill get a friendly gg but most of the time its just a flurry of toxic messages and being spammed with party invite while im still in the game :(
---
I tend to not got after them if I'm too far. They scatter like roaches
---
Some fries, motherfucker.
---
Unfortunately even though I am a super hacker, the system detected me as soon as I grabbed this screenshot and I wasn't able to look at any of his information
---
It absolutely exists, it's just that the name is wrong, and of course it's not toxic. 'Gen-rushing' makes it sound like it's the survivors' fault, which as you point out, they are simply doing their objective efficiently. The complaint from killers is valid though, it is possible for generators to be completed far too quickly through no fault of the killer. It is not uncommon at rank 1 to fail to even achieve a bronze gatekeeper emblem while obtaining iridescent in every other emblem. So you can perform to the highest standard as a killer, ending chases quickly, utilising your power well and hooking 9+ survivors, but generators are still completed too quickly for you to pip if the survivors are good on generators.
---
A killer shouldn’t need add ons/ certain perks (mostly ruin) to make them viable. If needed they could balance the add ons to be more reasonable. + that only changes him in a chase , I want to make him effective outside of one briefly
---
You shall never reach the ~~truth~~ hook
---
which streamer are you talking about, tru3?
---
So uncivilized
---
Don’t listen to them, it’s just the salty pig players that only liked doing endgame pig and are mad that her traps got a fair nerf to accommodate with the Endgame collapse.

That's awesome, did they all go down together or did you carry them?

Respecting D. Strike is what a Killer should do. But you are trying to tell us that Myers shouldn't tunnel Kate while both exit gates are open and she is the only person left in the game. GL HF (s)elfish-presley, hopefully more people join you in your dream world &lt;3

This is a very good post, thank you for raising awareness of hook rushing, I will try to wait about 6 hours between hooks from now on, I wasn't aware this was such an issue until you brought it up.
---
I play Nurse without using her power, any perks or addons (obviously), and I felt like I was still rushing hooks, do you happen to have any extra tips on how I should slow my game down, just a little bit?
---
they weren't complaining about tunneling lol, they were calling out killer mains that complain about genrush when they tunnel the same guy for 5 gens and can't abandon chases
---
No, that was rumor that was never confirmed by the devs.
---
I should say that I main survivor and have only played as killer like 3 times for daily challenges so that might be why I avoid the toxicity that your experience! 
---
But it’s a pity that one person can have such a positive experience with the game and another have a negative one with toxic messages sent to them!
---
My dad had a convocation with me saying "you have so many games to play that are bought but you play this more and it was free"
---
tunneling has had like multiple meanings over time. At first it meant chasing someone for unbelievable amounts of time and now it means chasing a recently unhooked survivor. This post is referring to chasing the same guy for incredible amounts of time
---
Basically how I feel
---
Jesus here I thought Tofu had night devotion
---
The entity couldn’t take shrek, he’s too powerful.
---
The only thing the spirit needs changed is
---
1) Prayer beads, because holy crap
---
2) Remove collision with survivors, this increases the skillcap for her which is fine and it also gives survivors enough of an edge to help them with mindgames and doesn't turn spirit into some boring bullyable killer
---
Removing survivor footsteps, window animations, crimping her power, making the static noise directional; all of these would be overkill on the spirit
---
Legion is underrated
---
No its possible on Xbox too. Somewhere in the settings. Can't clarify, at work right now
---
Just 360 the good killer with 1000h in the game 4Head
---
As a killer main, I DO see your point, but thats just the game. Are you pointing out in your post that you're facing survivors who know how to play? Doing gens is the survivor's main objective. A good tip is to not go back to hooks. Spread the damage. Keep as many people occupied as possible. Simple things can make a big difference - you just need to know what to do.
---
To go back to your point, yes; gen speed isn't okay right now.
---
Yo Angelo!
---
Get wrecked / RIP.
---
Thanks, baby. Hopefully you‘ll understand that DS is an anti tunneler perk. There‘s also nothing you can do about bloodwarden if some people open the exit gate. But let‘s cry about another survivor perk, right? :] Thanks for calling me selfish. I love when convos turn personal. Always good to see when people can‘t bring up arguments. Have a nice day and goodbye 😘
---
Oh, true, now "existance" loooks weird for me. I'm not native, forgive me &lt;/3
---
iOS or android
---
Can i make your pp hard?
---
Gimme ma inner strength
---
After seeing the movie yesterday, I don't think Pennywise would want to come to this game due to... &gt;!how he literally gets bullied to death. Just imagine him going up against toxic survivors that teabag him.!&lt;
---
Manipulation would probably be something with his power, I bet. My first thought would be something like a 5th survivor being thrown in to the fray, but it would be too easy to tell who is who, especially with SWF. I'm sure it would be something weird like that like fake gens, fake totems, etc.
---
You can use Addons and offerings for Adept Achievements though, I did it 2-3 days ago with plague as long as you only use her perks you fine!
---
I CAn HeAR ThE HEArt BeaT
---
It isn't. You get rewarded by your brain for it, sure, but eventually you realize that **YoUr aCtIoNs HaVe CoNsEqUeNcEs**
---
When you're on a gen and they run over just to fail a skill check and run away
---
A really funny way to mess with them without being toxic yourself is just to straight up pity them and tell them they have value outside of games and it gets better
---
They might reflect a lil bit and or give up or maybe feel better either way it's worked more often than not for me on Xbox
---
so generic e-boy voice?
---
I admit, I will sometimes jokingly do a "gg ez" as a surv when the killer has absolutely wiped the floor with myself and my teammates, but I never add that baby killer bit. To me it's just funny since the match was the exact opposite
---
What survivor is that?
---
That I’m playing?
---
Exactly.
---
Are you even a true Shrek main I will have him P3 fast while you stay at level 50
---
Yeah we should unnerf pig but we should also buff some along side pig
---
*coughs im Bubba, Ghostface and Legion*
---
Yeah it feels so good to waste 2 perks slots on an item that is easily counterable
---
Shrek came willingly because of the undisturbed swampland the entity promised
---
How incredibly helpful and deeply insightful this is
---
It’s a phrase, basically saying ‘there’s your answer’
---
Good point. Maybe he can drink a bottle for a speed boost outside of chase?
---
Seriously. Most of my games took at least a couple minutes to find
---
kate's new skin!
---
Is that spongebob? Look at how they massacred my boy
---
How?
---
that's what she said
---
The same thing happens on PC sometimes. You'll see a frame or two of the bar going up as if the repair speed was 500%. Weird client side bug, can they fix it?
---
You on console or pc? I can help with either (or at least, I’ll try to lol)
---
Noed will not work on his shred attack, as it works now as it is bugged.
---
Whispers aren't a great choice for him too, as you use your portals to track people down.
---
Except he only killed bad people. Working with the entity and the other killers makes 0 sense for him.
---
Wrong flair buddy
---
Most good ghostfaces do go for the instadowns. If you play ghostface like a wraith that can loose his power by getting looked at and has to wait 30 sec to use it again then you're playing him completely wrong.
---
Emojindetected
---
I dunno, you don’t really wanna accidentally “Fog Cleanse rush” though. That’d be a bannable offense.
---
As a console legion, I agree that we are plentiful and bad. But I just wait to confirm a sacrifice, not camping just staying in the rough area.
---
So cute :3
---
yea its some bullshit but apparently "working as intended". honestly i think we should get a pip for being denied a game or at the very least be guaranteed a safety
---
IF I WAS A BAD FLOWER HEADED MONSTER, I WOULDNT BE SITTIN ‘ERE DISCUSSING IT WITH YA WOULD I?!
---
Dude, 'ts Feng Min, dude
---
I feel like you're missing something... I know it's something important, I just can't figure it out, it's on the tip of my tongue, it feels like the answer is stabbing me in the back.
---
Big man with your "hook rushing". Some of us haven't figured out how to pick up downed survivors yet and not 4 man slug. Smh my head
---
Laughs in bubba
---
ON WHAT ?!
---
He would kill the entity
---
&gt;There is already a dbd leaderboard. People still play normal.
---
Which one are you talking about? Twitch leaderboards or what?
---
That’s the most toxic crap I’ve ever heard. I think you should just unplug your keyboard/turn off your controller for an hour every game to give the survivors a head start. Only then is it fair.
---
Darn, that sucks
---
Changed that for them.
---
You can also have a bbq with entity and then it will show you where the survivors are.
---
I wouldn't wanna receive a pip for a rage quit killer
---
If that was the case I would be in the red levels now which I am not ready for at all haha

I've probably watched this 10+ times in a row and I can't stop laughing holy shit.

Well if I was a bad Flower-Headed Monster, I wouldn’t be sittin here discussin it with you now would I!

As a killer main I get alot of hatemails on a daily basis sometimes it just seems like survivors get salty because I played well unfortunately its the community we have

I think 6M, but it might be 4M.

Okay, thanks for the tip!

Oh didn’t really look like her from what I’ve seen in game

Yeah, no problem man, gotta git gud somehow.
---
I’d rather the toxicity than to have to spam X on my controller to struggle and still die. On pc I just bind it to mouse wheel and spare my sanity.
---
Heart eyes, motherfucker.
---
What is wrong with that?
---
Its a marker made by one of the map add-ons. You press the secondary action button while using a map to create the marker if you have the add-on equipped. On xbox the secondary action button is Lb unless you’ve changed it.

He is using the key for aura reading... The green add-on shows survivors auras.
---
Bro do whatever makes you happy. That's the important part
---
Did you downvote me for having a discussion lol?
---
Perfect, I’m on Xbox so I can help a bit. Now keep in mind, 360’s only work *sometimes*, and if you’re up against a decent killer, they’ll catch on quick. It requires they lunge attack at you, which doesn’t have that quasi-“lock-on” the quick swing does. 
---
Now, that being said: the two methods are the “single stick” and the “dual stick”, the former being the more successful for me (also the easier method). Single only requires your left stick—when the killer’s stain is *almost* touching your back (remember: there’s a slight delay on YOUR screen vs the KILLERS, so you need to compensate for it), spin your stick counter-clockwise. Doing so should put you just behind the killer, leaving you a small window to leg it another direction. The second method I haven’t perfected the timing, but I’ve made it work once or twice: you spin one stick clockwise, and the other counter-clockwise—if you’ve ever watched Monto’s survivor videos, when he tries to spin the killer, it’ll look like that on your screen. 
---
If you ever have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask; remember: the only dumb question is the one never asked.
---
Looks great!
---
The only "downsides" I see is that it's a bit too similar to your Nebula pack and a bit too light for my taste
---
Keep up the good work
---
I would try meg or David next. Dont worry bc I leveled Feng first, and I have 6 perstitged people now
---
nice
---
Yea i was gonna say this
---
It punishes the unhooker and lets the farmed player get up
---
Also it pulls another guy off gens so that's nice
---
The counterplay is mostly reading the spirit and staying away from edges. Right now if a spirit get an instant hit on you it's due to collision. Never wait in doorways or at pallets (dropped or otherwise). Collision will kill you.
---
Never ever ever ever wait at a pallet. 
---
If you gain a lot of ground on the spirit then start walking left or right. Remember she has a cooldown on her power and is a 110% killer otherwise. Loop her like normal and when she stops get away from edges walk in a direction she might not pick; if you're going for a pallet start walking towards another loop, she'll usually phase in near the pallet and you'll be halfway towards another loop and she'll be on cooldown. Buys a lot of time.
---
Waiting near entrances/pallets just let her collide with you and there's not much you can do. Spirits are *used* to collision doing the work for them so when you don't give it to them they'll start making major mistakes
---
Get DS. Move on to the next game
---
Okay I've never made a 360 but I'm going to try this/PS4
---
I rarely get hit by more than one.
---
99% of the time is not the right number. it's closer to 75% right now. You're also excluding the fact that survivors with DS often run straight into you sometimes just to get a chance to use it.
---
New Ash cosmetic looks sick
---
Right now Legion, cool aesthetics and People at higher ranks get insanely salty when you 4k them.
---
In Future probably the Demogorgon, even cooler aesthetics, sick Power and Custom music
---

The Ogre
---
Power: Roar
---
Roar loudly to create fear among survivors, revealing their locations and causing them to suffer a 50% slower speed penalty to all repairing, unhooking, healing, mending, and cleansing actions for a period of time. Additionally, you can rub mud on generators, causing any survivor who attempts to repair them to suffer a slight movement speed reduction for 20 seconds after leaving the generator. 
---
Perks: 
---
Hex: What Are You Doing In My Swamp - When the hex totem is active, putting a survivor into the dying state 3/2/1 times will cause them to permanently be in the broken status effect until the totem is cleansed. 
---
Sharpest Tool in the Shed - Your basic attack now inflicts the survivor with the deep wounds status effect, and their pools of blood to appear 30/40/50% more frequently. 
---
Onions Have Layers - Once downing a survivor, all pallets within a 16/24/32m radius will be blocked by the Entity, causing them to be stuck and unable to be used by survivors.
---
Pretty sure it’s a joke/bait/ troll topic, but if you MUST know, it’s likely due to the toxicity on both sides this game has spawned. I don’t even remember which side started it, or at least made it commonplace.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fyar4wJ3-Y
---
So i play GhostFace. I downed a guy inside of that van. Then i leave the van to catch another survivor. 
---
 The downed guy is INSIDE that van, so i can't see him. I do NOT have line of sight on him! So i assume, that it's safe to enter Night Shroud mode. 
---
 But no..The guy, being INSIDE that van, reveals me using an advantage of 3d person view.
---
 How is that fair?
---
Looks like it was made in Dreams?
---
i expected a prayer beads spirit. was not disappointed either
---
I like these perks! Except the first one. Its a bad thing to be in a terror radius. Infectious, doctor etc
---
It's broken the other way too, it's honestly pretty inconsistent. It needs touching up so that when you notice him, you can expose him, and not in a way to makes him weaker since it's pretty easy for him to get exposed when people don't even notice him, or from behind walls
---
Demogorgon is a loopable killer. Which means that against a good survivors you might get long chases. 
---
It means that you need to slow the game pace as much as possible.
---
For that i advise you to pick **Pop goes the weasel** (Clown perk) which works really well with the travel ability of Demogorgon.
---
You should pick **Corrupt intervention** (Plague perk) too that way you gain a long momentum at the start of the game during which some of the survivors won't be able to work on a gen.
---
You can pick **Ruin** too (Hag perk) but keep in mind that it will either be extremely useful or almost useless since it's a Hex perk.
---
And you can pick whatever you want as a last perk like **BBQ** (Cannibal perk) to know where to go after a hook, or **Sloppy butcher** to slow down survivors healing, or even the new Demogorgon perk that "kick" near gens when you down a survivor…
---

---
Ok will have a look at them. Are their any particular perks to look out for?
---
LETS MAKE THIS REAL
---
I absolutely love when this happens.  I have had a couple of camping killers DC as soon as I pop it.
---
I really want to do these but I'm also really scared of getting banned...
---
Thank you for this answer!!
---
It definitely takes practice (and again, I wanna reiterate I’m no expert, I just happen to make it work occasionally), but if the killer you’re against is a potato, you’ll be spinning them left and right.
---
I consistently 4k with her at red ranks. I know she 
---
is definitely weak but she definitely isn’t the worst 
---
*sad oink*
---
Fair point, but the survivors just seem a bit more edgy lol. I literally just finished a game where I had 3 people hooked and I was watching the last guy literally standing above the hatch waiting for his teammates to die so he could escape... They had one generator left to do and he could've easily saved them, I was quite far away as well. Instead he teabagged on me for a few seconds before going to the hatch. Like, do survivors normally do this now?
---
You can continue to play as Dwight and still put bloodpoints into other characters
---
Honestly the strongest perk in dbd
---
What is this from, or did you create this whole beautiful image in photoshop/some 3d modeling program?
---
I love the leather jacket and pants, but I prefer to run it with Kate's brown hair.
---
You’re very welcome! I’m always happy to help :D
---
Butt
---
Glass bead
---
Eh who cares what anyone thinks. I really like playing Dwight and his perks are very good. Prove thyself is goo for Gen rushing and leader helps speed up heals. Not to mention bond is one of the best perks out there. Knowing where the survivors are and what they're doing is super helpful for your team. If someone getting chased that's when you start doing gens. Or if people are hiding that means the killer is nearby so maybe you might want to hide too. Eventually you'll want to invest in other characters to get their perks. We're going to live forever is a great way to get blood points but you might want to get borrowed time before you start unhooking otherwise you might farm someone on accident. Other than that just depends on your play style. Do you want to sneak around everywhere and try to not get caught? Urban evasion, iron will and spring burst in case you get caught. If you want to try to run the killer all 5 gens then object of obsession with decisive strike, dead hard and adrenaline might suit you better. If you just want to be a Healer then borrowed time, empathy, botany knowledge and either we'll make it or we're going to live forever might be the best build.
---
He scares me but the way he pops his head around the corner is fucking hilarious I love it hahahaha
---
Actually what are you doing in my swamp is a good perk tho
---
You can view each character perk by pressing f1
---
Read the discription of each one and see which perks best suit your playstyle
---
"improved Totem spots"
---
The title rhymes, and I shall not sleep without a knife under my pillow tonight.

yes I also think he looks a lot like but it's different.
---
thanks for the remark :)
---
FUCKING LOW SENSITIVITY EVEN IF U HAVE ON 100% ON CONSOLE AND BIG ASS JANE DEADZONE ON CONTROLER HOW TF SHOULD I PLAY NURSE OR MAKE 180 SWINGS WITH KILLERS AND POOR ASS GHETTO EVERY OPTIMIZATION DROPINNN EVERY GODDAMN 5 SECS BELOW 20 FPS!!!
---
Oh, well yeah, the finger licking thing is a point if you have some weird mental problem, but i apreciate your response (?
---
Someone brought up the idea of one killer vs like 10-15 survivors in a "survivor royale" where the last one standing wins (or a timer goes out)
---
I always loved this as an alternate game mode that let you focus on hunting/hiding and looping.
---
Some changes could really help
---
You could have alternate perks and sacrifice rules for it. Some killers would be fucking nutty, like legion or bubba. You could have much larger maps with emphasis on hidey holes and maybe some scavanger type objectives that the killer doesn't care about but it might expose you.
---
I was about to say im the 69th upvote but three people ruined my joke.
---
no. BHVR(creators of dead by daylight) won't go out of their way to ban you form using them, while EAC (easy anti-cheat) can ban you, if their anti-cheat get's triggered. That is why we recommend you only change the PNG files and nothing else. But rest assured, as of the moment there is no reports of getting banned for changing the icons.
---
Exact same here
---
Yeah. But last ptb her hatchet hit like normal, only the hatchet would have piercing, so it could hit a row of survivors, traveling through them.
---
Look who's shitting in the tall grass
---
Thanks for this I’ll try and hopefully it helps
---
no, just make sure your Totem stays up
---
The black mesh over the eyes?
---
Is it me or does this look like it's from ROBLOX?
---
Yea clown could use a buff, but other killers need it more IMO. I rarely play clown, it’s a scuffed version of Huntress to me. If I am gonna be aiming and throwing a limited amount of stuff, I might as well get a hit for it
---
I don't really see how waiting out DS and nodding is in any way toxic. I might get downvoted but I honestly can't see how this video shows toxic behavior. He didn't really do anything to warrant a toxic label since you usually have to either camp or tunnel before nodding.
---
"Hi there little fellow"
---
They drew First Blood!
---
Got any pro tips for demo? I struggled a lot with toxic SWFs who had a low rank in their group when I first played him, which in turn caused me to get matched up with them.
---
Wish they would've had another flower event where this thing rises from the flower after getting the nectar as a freaky reveal
---
Played against a lot of proxy camping and tunnelling killers with immersed teammates with no BT, which always ends well! I’m probably gonna play killer for a bit and see if that’s any more fun.
---
Im literally cumming rn
---
Sami Gordon
---
I don’t usually kill survivors.  I use NOED to guarantee some late BP and give survivors another hex to go after.
---
I love stats in any game so if they ever did this it would be so cool. :(
---
You get dms which is more personal imo lol
---
I put dead hard and sprintburst and after in chase I realised how much of a moron I was...
---
I’m hoping it’s Tuesday when the new chapter releases
---
Well i sure am after this skin ;)
---
Dude wtf
---
Why doesn't legion have a insta down? Or wraith. All killers aren't supposed to have one.
---
Bubba for BBQ, Franklin and memes
---
Big cock no shock doc is the only acceptable doc meme
---
I thought it was designed to be that way. Not that that's at all fair, I just thought the devs found that acceptable.
---
Killers when we see 4 survivors join the lobby at the same time*

teammate farms someone off hook so I slug the person that was hooked so I still gain pressure but they don't lose a life
---
I chase the unhooker and down him super easily, he get's insta healed to full health.
---
I hook the person that was unhooked, because fuck that, then get called a tunneler.
---
If you farm a survivor then PURPOSEFULLY make it hard to down you, you can't blame the killer for tunneling
---
Do you wanna get banned? Cause this is how you get banned
---
What link
---
Yeah the mask does kinda goes with the above mentioned items lol!
---
Great in theory but likely wouldn’t translate the way we would hope.  It would also split the player base in a niche game.
---
oh my I love how confused he was
---
Legion cant either with frenzy.... Theyll probably take it out. Because the killers really arent supposed to do tht. With their special attacks. Its just supposed to be basic attacks. I think every killer should have a insta down option seeing like over half of them do.
---

---
The League of Unnecessary Nerf Victims just keeps growing.
---
My fav is Wraith and Legion
---
As to why i dont have a why i just prefer them over everyone else.
---
Ill most like have Demogorgon as my favorite too since ive always wanted a monster type killer
---
I respect good killers when I play Survivior. 
---
8 times of 10 I'm usually flaming my fellow Surviviors for being dumbasses
---
It’s called personification, “dum dum”.
---
Once you use it once they start to know you'll use it and they will bait you
---
My favorite killer is probably trapper. I love him because he's super fun to play, trapping people is super fun and satisfying, knowing that you predicted your opponents movements gives me a really good feeling that no other killer does. Hag is also a killer I really like
---
See, I usually do that get upset at gens getting done quickly, I bring ruin to slow the game down enough to get good blood points, but it makes me super sad when a swf brings 4 purple tool boxes and each run for their own gen. That's my definition of gen rushing, genuine gen rushing. Yeah, you gotta play objectively, I understand, but cmon... Atleast try to get some points. You don't need to speed run me, I'm a nice leatherface, I promise. I eat my apple slices, drink my milk, and dress like a handsome young man. At least let me chase you some, I won't hurt you, promise. Drop some pallets on my head. I've been a good little cannibal mommy, I deserve some points. 😢
---
I personally think the frame is just as funny on it's own, but to each their own. And btw, I couldn't care less about upvotes, I just wanted to share it.
---
Nah man, in a game like this i can chase someone else, hook them, let you get healed, chase you again, then pick you up and get d striked. I dont think the perk is op but im tired of people refusing to admit you dont have to tunnel to get DSed
---
I believe it's because she can hide and be silent. She still needs a buff. But don't you think it would be a little over powered to have no terror radius and sneak up behind someone and 1 slap em
---
You could also set a trap beside the pick up and let hilarity ensue.
---
Iri head infantry belt ebony noed huntress. I wonder how bad she wouldve done if she didnt have those lol.
---
Each day we stray further from God
---
Better than being a toxic cunt I suppose
---
Good situation example, however in many of my cases I hadn’t been hooked once but because I got caught right around the time a couple gens popped the killer decided that he wanted at least one kill, so he went after me.
---
Either you're abusing a glitch, or the Meg isn't very good at hitting skillchecks.
---
If a survivor is using decisive strike and is about to use it, all the killer has to do to stop it is pick the survivor up and then immediately swing their weapon which makes it so the survivor misses the DS no matter what
---
In Pig culture this is considered a dick move.
---
damn id love to know what hag uses for her hair and skin
---
That’s the tier of your perk.
---
I use to do this when I 1st started out as a killer, but now I grin with delight at how much they fucked up joining my lobby.
---
People who dc upon getting downed reading this post:
---
*no*
---
I was surprised to see it, she hooked one person the entire game and facecamped him. Definitely a weird game
---
Aren’t all memes? 🤔
---
Ik this sound like im just some meta killer main or sumn, but i like the spirit a lot personally. fun play style, good power(like really good), and its satisfying to get yoinks.
---
You seem like a nice guy to be around
---
Well thats just like, your opinion man. 
---
Not saying you're wrong in general. Buuuuuuut not all of us have the vast majority of "usable" perks unlocked from killers/survivors. I only barely managed to eek out enough shards to buy ruin and bbq so I dont have to struggle bus myself as bubba or hag since I lack a lot of the BP perks and items that vets have.
---
Yes its a crutch, but its one I'll abuse untill my skill is there
---
I'm surprised more loopers don't carry toolboxes. You want to get the guy with the toolbox when you're being rushed.
---
&gt;4th
---
Ok my goal is to P3 the demo it looks sick
---
I’m not positive about this, but I think after a certain amount of time being slugged the wiggle progression will revert to 0%
---
Giving us a ton of BP would let that remain testable.

i thought there was. but i started to get more bloodpoints than 1million as you can see in this pic. im not sure if its a bug or a feature on mobile though

MOM THE FOOD IS SO HOT IT STARTED A FIRE!
---
Damn feels bad:/
---
My eyes about bled reading this before I realized
---
This the same killer that complains about DS
---
Demogorgon kinda got some thiccy thighs ngl
---
While they are both powerful mid tier killers, Michael is more consistent and a better killer overall.
---
I've been thinking of delaying my plans to get Spirit and instead just get Clown and only throw bottles and tell people to get the hell off my lawn.
---
Think now's a good time?
---
Why? Why post-game chat?
---
Yeah. I’ve been getting pretty salty comments from people that clearly didn’t read it
---
I actually am. I just don't like being called a thief, especially more from a place I never knew about. You can't steal a fucking meme the same way you can with artwork. It's literally just a generic picture of a thing with a title heading. Is this something you morons do when you spend all day reposting the exact same meme with a new heading? No? Didnt think so. You're a hypocrite.
---
I'd love to see your reaction to Scott junds clip where he got DSed 4 times without tunneling anyone
---
Trust me, you get dsed even if you don't tunnel. It happens much less often but it still does happen
---
That Donkey perk though
---
Them be the first one chased.
---
Other than leatherface and legion I don’t think any other killer deserves a rework more. Trapper just needs more traps etc, leatherface needs a full rework. Idk bout legion. Clown just needs that extra, which wouldn’t be too hard to incorporate. However I agree there are more worthy killers, just wanted to suggest a clown one
---
Michael and Ghostface have a lot in common. I'd say Ghostface is the more stealthier killer because he has a built in stealth mode that gives him 0 terror radius upon activating it, plus he can also lean around corners to make it harder for survivors to spot him. However, I think Michael is a little bit easier to learn than Ghostface, I also think Michael has better teachables than Ghostface. Save the Best for Last is a great perk to help you save time in chase and give you more utility, Play With Your Food is in my opinion one of the most underrated perks in the game as it increases your movement speed if you simply let your obsession escape you 3 times which is useful for chases (just as long as you don't use it on Nurse, Hag, Huntress, or Legion), and Dying Light will be getting reworked very soon and in my opinion will be very helpful for slowing down the game and buying you time if you simply hook people who aren't your obsession. The only great perk Ghostface has in my opinion is Thrilling Tremors, I'm All Ears and Furtive Chase can be okay on certain killers and certain perk builds I guess, but I think there's better options. So basically, Ghostface is the more stealthier one, but Michael is easier to play and has better teachable perks.
---
It would likely have a massive cooldown time. Revealing auras from across the map is REALLY good for a power
---
I can imagine. You did a good job, friendo

Set a dream snare and tele if it's triggered. Not an amazing solution but at least Freddy can try something with it

like, I had stridor 3 and he didn’t have iron will. I’m a spirit, he think I wouldn’t hear him?
---
It's not about who you were playing as though, but your connection, it seems. If you have a bad connection, you shouldn't play as killer. Plain simple.
---
Yeah it is. I'm not sure but I think it's in settings, privacy. You can set your messages to friends only and you'll never receive messages again
---
Actually that’s what I did lol l. Wasn’t the best spot but it worked out because they did the gens for one side on the map first then the side the actual totem was at so it all turned out decently ....
---
This would make achievements so much easier. Especially the skilled huntress.
---
I had a game recently, I was in 3man and this meg drops almost all the pallets, couldn’t keep a chase for half a minute. And we we still had 5 gens up. It was GG from there.
---
Twice, she goes down near a gen I was trying to repair but it went to almost nothing because Pop. 
---
Like I ain’t even the greatest survivor, but I question the people who play this game sometimes.

Desc: While in a trial you can't emote, recover from dying, wiggle out of killer grasp, or use active abilities (dead hard). You also can't escape through the exit doors, you just keep running past the gate and can run around the outside of the map but you can escape through the hatch. This seems to be random, I've had it multiple times on all different survivors and perk/item setups.
---
No video
---
Reproduce: Load into a trial as any survivor with any build.
---
Expectation: Can play normally
---
Reality: Can't escape or do most actions
---
Reproduction Rate: Its seemingly random, I can't make it happen on command but I get it two or three times a night (3-4 hours total of playing)

Edit for formatting
---
Except you DO have to tunnel to get DSd. Unless the person ur describing chasing is a bonobo, you'll get resistance long enough to let the other guys Decisive timer go down by at worst, half. Then you hook the guy so theres another let's say like 5 seconds off if the hook is close. Then you'd have to chase the unhooked guy through 2 health states, then pick him up. 
---
That's gonna last longer than one minute
---
We usually end up with someone like that at lower ranks, except they crouch walk without urban evasion.
---
I also love it when a totem spawns right next to the hook I place a survivor on.
---
The first time I ran NOED, the cocky unhooker I caught had no idea it existed. I didn't know that was possible.
---
Not dead, just low. Once you get into rank 10-1 and play a lot; you'll see a lot of the same people .

[Shrek is Love, Shrek is Life]

The killer is filled with energy while on the hunt for its prey. For every survivor hooked, the killer requires 2/3/4% less time when activating abilities.

---
After being hooked once by the killer, the survivor has uncontrollable fear towards the killer. All actions have a 5/6/7% chance to be unsuccessful. An unsuccessful skill check that would have otherwise been successful will make no indication towards the killer.

Oh baby you getting the dick.

I did not make these thinking about the greater picture but more for just having a laugh. If you feel there should be a change or a better idea please get them going!
---
You never have to worry about being chased if the Killer never finds you 4Head
---
Honestly i think balances are made with about rank 10 in mind considering everything that's done to killers, but i definitely think that balance stuff should always be made to hit red ranks differently than low ranks. I genuinely think that survivors are too strong at red ranks, but i definitely don't want to just fuck over the new player or casual player experience, those are both important for the game and i just want them to have fun too.  
---
I don't blame downvotes on killers need nerfs, because, they don't, it's really about phrasing in this case, being specific matters. it's why often mentioning "gen rushing" gets push back, but saying that gen speed is too fast gets much less push back.  
---
Also that's odd, i mentioned the same thing, survivors DO need a decent BP perk, and there were nothing but upvotes on that and the surrounding agreements. I definitely feel wayyyy less rewarded for playing survivor, and i don't see why, matches take just as long, i could understand maybe killers getting sliightly more because it's more stressful (imo), but like 12-19K average compared to 40-80K (because survivor pudding is way more common than escape cake despite the same rarity) is harsh as fuck
---
Yeah, but even if it works for freddy and maybe even hag it wouldn't for any other killer so I can see the complaint
---
Bloody biker kate 😫
---
Its not the camera, the whole character has to face him. Or at least that's what works for me. If i just turn the camera at him nothing happens
---
:) but it turns out to be haunted grounds &gt;:)
---
Getting DSd 4 times means A. You got baited 4 times or B. You actually did tunnel.
---
Discordance is kinda an exception.
---
At tier 1 u get more information but at tier 3 the notification is longer and is not that precise
---
Am  i the only one seeing a god damned condom on his head? Wth?
---
You're going to get downvoted for just how right you are
---
God I WISH I was this confident. I’m only this cocky when I play nurse, which I almost don’t anymore.
---
This is true
---
His chase music is gonna be All star for sure
---
Yo thats dope man,  i hope that you had lots of fun, and that he thought it was funny in the end
---
Or Sheogorath from SI.
---
You do realise the skill check now happens during the pickup animation right? So before you can even swing the Survivor has had the chance to hit it?
---
Yes bc who unhooks you has everything to do with whether or not the killer that downed you 10 seconds later is Tunnelling
---
There's is no counter play to a good spirit. Not even iron will. Let me paint the picture for you. We are at a pallet loop. I fake phase, you either A. Run away and I phase and hit you B. Stay there I phase and hit you or C. Vault back at me and I hit you. Spirit is an auto win most games.
---
Hag is high tier, you just need to know how to fully use her kit
---
The Trapper 2.0
---
I exclusively reserve my nurse for when a 3 or 4 stack join my lobby. Slap on a last breath add-on and a Mori and have some fun with the toxic flashlight clickers lmao
---
Ballerina feng looks horrible to me. Its just opinion though. I prefer her yellow Outfits way more.
---
Devs shouldn't consider SWF when balancing, because that would just screw solo survivors and it's already hard as it is.
---
No problem
---
Ghostface is a better "Stealth" killer solely because of the crouch, as it makes it that much harder to see him coming, though moving at normal speed even when "Stealthy" is definitely something that is amazing as well.
---
Myers, however, is a much better designed Killer overall. Myers at T1 still has a (really small) terror radius, but he's immune to detection perks (Odds are Ghostface is going to get that ability later on as well with the new status effect coming). He also has Tier 3 Evil Within, where he starts one shotting people and with certain add-ons he can instantly kill people he catches.
---
The big difference between the two of them is that Myers pretty much has to decide if he wants to be stealthy, but if things go south he can easily start playing "seriously". Ghostface is much more committed to stealth than Myers is.
---
Honestly though, I'd recommend The Pig as your first Stealth Killer. She can crouch to lose her Terror Radius and Red Stain just like Ghostface, but her Reverse Bear Traps can drastically slow the game down until you get Ruin.
---
What item is that?
---
Do they usually join the lobby at once? I’ve started going to profiles and looking at friends lists
---
Is that...
---
Dreams?
---
All of the new P3s went really light with the blood. It's not the biggest deal for me, but I can see why people are saying they're not that exciting.
---
But then it's an ez pz comm ban for them. Feels good.
---
Lol. Ass means but though. It should be 'as'
---
I stopped reading at:
---
&gt;when balancing a game you should always look at the highest possible level of play
---
DBD isn't a competitive game or an e-sport game, 80% maybe 90% of its community are casual players. 
---
DBD shouldn't be balanced around the 10%. As a killer even when you go against a team coordinately perfect, it will be 1 out of 10 matches if not more. 
---
The problem with DBD "balance" is that some killer players want to 4k at 5 gens every single game. This isn't balance.
---
It isn't tunneling. Tunneling is so ridiculously rare, but survivors use the term for any time DS is active. Which is utterly stupid. The REALITY is that this was near end game, it seems highly likely that this was an unsafe hook scenario, and she was downed right after unhook. That is NOT TUNNELING. That is survivors unhooking when the killer is close. Killers do not need to play by your made up rules and not hit someone just because you unhooked them in front of them. 
---
This entitled sense is part of why this game is so toxic. The killer has ONE job - please the entity by hooking and killing survivors. Survivors have ONE job - escape. If you as survivor CHOOSE to unhook unsafely right in front of the killer, that is YOUR fault, not the killers fault. They are well within their rights to knock that person back down.
---
I sympathize with the killer...... :[
---
You forgot C. If you down people really quickly(basically doing your job really swiftly) you can get dsed multiple times.
---
why? so for a solo survivor going against a killer thats not a nurse or spirit is making the game worse? did you read my post?
---
It's okay. Skins are subjective so you might not like what I like :)
---
Self healing gives points to survival, the skill cheks don't, tho.
---
Snapping out of it, waking up, cleansing, outlasting, mending yourself, freeing yourself from a bear trap, using jigsaw boxes (and disposing from the reverse bear traps) also give points for survival.
---
Escaping the killers grasp by wiggling and unhooking yourself also give points towards the survival category, but those cases are rare.
---
I do agree that we need more ways to get survival points, there are many cases, because the ones that currently exist depend on the killer or luck.
---
Not all SWF are toxic.
---
At least he is honest.
---
The abysmal BP rate for survivors is why I dont feel incentivised to play that role.
---
I feel way more stressed as survivor because even though I only play with my friends, tunneling and camping work entirely too well. (Ranks 1, 5, 10, and 12)
---
I get tunneled, die super quick, leave with 8k BP, and depip. It's we either smash the killer and all leave, Do Gens super quick only to have their NOED win them the game (which is fair. We didnt do totems), or they tunnel and camp us 1 by 1 until we're all dead. And as i stated earlier, we aren't terrible at the game. Its just too easy for that cheesy crap to work. And sure, at red ranks they will ignore the hookee and just gen rush a camping killer, but we aren't at red ranks.
---
The moral of this is I definitely feel survivors need more rewards somehow. A perk that coincides with gameplay the way BBQ does, or more points events. I just made a post about a few point events they could make if you want to take a quick look.
---
**Rule Nr. 367 of the Survivors Rulebook for Killers:**  
---
A killer may not lay a finger on an unhooked survivor until they have hooked all other survivors one time each. Otherwise they will be branded as a tunneler and forced to sit in the time-out corner and reconsider their actions.
---
It’s a fire cracker. You only get them during events for some reason.
---
Yes i do and I count my last  50 matchs in there the survivors  win 32 and the killers 18, the survs win the double of matches than the killers and ten of the killers victory was because my parnerts were potatos
---
The easy mode of this game is survivor if you die to much is because you are bad
---
Keep dabbing. Maybe the portal will cringe itself away
---
Bound it to a mouse button. Took some time to get used to but way better now.
---
So you're saying. Myers, ghostface, haunted grounds, iri head, rancor, devour hope, Billy and Bubba are toxic? Wow u must suck
---
Honestly, survivor trolls are worse than killer ones and I’m a survivor main. I hate seeing them taunt or troll the killer and other survivors.
---
&gt;The problem with DBD "balance" is that some killer players want to 4k at 5 gens every single game. This isn't balance.
---
no, that is not the case. so you would consider depiping because you go against competent players and playing a weak killer balanced?
---
edit: if i wanted to 4k every time id just play nurse or spirit
---
Depends on what is going on, had many players during the anniversary. Then players kinda slowed. I would expect it to pick up through stranger things release, then Halloween event. Don’t seem to wait more than 5 mins for first game most times.
---
Adreniline is amazing, same with dead hard, iron will, and Bond
---
Well I mean the clown is crazy
---
&gt;!what is that?!&lt;
---
Same I hate him so much, the number of times I have a full-on staring competition only to get the exposed signal.
---
&gt; The killer that imo really need a rework (buff) are..... doctor,
---
Honestly, I think if they just increased the range of Shock Therapy, he'd be in a great spot. He's already extremely powerful, he's just the hardest Killer to play by a long shot and that's not helped by him being entirely dependent on his range add-ons.
---
I made a thread about this a bit ago, but I feel like instead of drastically changing a bunch of Killers, they need to start "tuning more dials". Give the characters like Trapper, Clown, Myers and Leatherface a bonus 10% to destroying things (A Tier 1 Brutal Strength) and I think they'd be in a much better spot.
---
A huge issue with balancing is that all the high tier killers (Freddy, Nurse, Spirit, Billy, Hag) are extremely mobile, and Huntress is the only Killer with a ranged option (available to her all the time). You can't really give every single Killer a teleport though, as that would be kind of broken.
---
If you use Deliverance when the killer is extremely close, you shouldnt expect to live. It creates situations where you get hooked, immediately pull yourself off 2 feet in front of the killer, take a free hit with borrowed time, and then a free DS stun.
---
You know that keem uploaded a video of himself to one of his social media accounts calling himself a "master manipulator" just a couple hours after that video, right?
---
Or you have an insta down/they didn't heal. 
---
This is such a ridiculous argument. It's pretty obvious that your incessant bitching that DS is bullshit is just gray rank killer sentiment. Any good killer who knows how to prioritize which Surviviors to down and how to apply map pressure doesn't have to deal with Decisive strike. Even rank 1 Surviviors and killers like Monto have said Decisive strike is perfectly fine the way it is and that the only time you get hit by it is when you deserve it. 
---
Besides, BHVR said they were reworking Decisive strike to give it counterplay but make it more usable. Not to satiate killer mains that are pissed that Surviviors don't spawn in pre-hooked.
---
Lies and slander
---
Imagine being so insecure about yourself that you have to insult someone over saying 'yo you stole that meme' then going on about 'facts dont care about your feelings' lmfao
---
Yeah I rarely ever see trapper, doctor or pig. And I'm only rank 10. Ive maybe played against* plague 4 times in the 5 months ive had the game. And Freddy about the same.
---
The overwhelming majority of killers I see is bubba, ghost face, billy, and spirit. Thankfully xbox controls are garbage for nurse so noone plays her.
---
I also like the idea I've seen of combining We'll make it and WGLF. Give the survivors an altruistic perk with use that would match BBQ.
---
In a time of war any hole is a trench
---
Something happen to you?
---
That'll do, pig. That'll do.
---
Maybe the killer is facecamping you on ur first hook and you either use Deliverance there or you don't ever get to use it. 
---
And If you get to use BT and Decisive, then the killer was blatantly camping and Tunnelling you, which is when those perks come into play.
---
&gt;Honestly, I think if they just increased the range of Shock Therapy, he'd be in a great spot.
---
Yes, that and making his shock therapy more consistant. i know i worded it poorly but i didnt mean that every killer i mentioned should get a complete kit overhaul, with most killers tweaking the numbers would be fine
---
Im on pc. Any advice ? :c
---
Yes, beta.
---
No problem—it takes practice, so don’t get discouraged if it doesn’t work immediately
---
Its god dam annoying, starting to think im not going to help others anymore and just help myself to survive. its not the first time this has happened today, one survivor baited me in a bear trap and tbagged instead of actually helping. 
---
I’ve vented hard today over it in that post. i messaged the guy after on ps and said “Cannot believe you didnt wake me up at the door” and he replies with “didnt know you could, dont be mad bro” its funny and infuriating because i just woke him up before we repaired the last gen.  just absolute assholes, i think i should just play with friends on this game now, no solo games.
---
Pipping or depipping doesn't mean anything. You lose a game using a weak killer against competent survivors and you stomp the next survivor crew using the exact same killer because this SWF dream team isn't as common as people claim to be, specially since they made ranking up as a survivor way easier (it was necessary due to queue times). As long as you are having fun in chases, its all that matters.
---
Thanks man
---
Anything that is not not spirit nurse or hag, not a surv main, i like both roles
---
Take this with a grain of salt, (Quentin main).
---
Feng is on the same level as Meg, Nea, Quentin ugliness.
---
Poor killers :( Always victims.
---
&gt;!the sub of our people, fellow Chris!&lt;
---
I actually think the community is trending toward being more positive. Been having a lot more positive interactions in post game chat
---
It’s honestly really simple, it’s not about buffing the other killers, it’s either giving a downside to being swf  (as they make up a lot of the high ranks) or increase the amount of time to do gens or add other objectives that are equally important to gens.
---
This is the first spongebob meme in this subreddit that actually made me laugh
---
Can’t buy Bubba with shards though which is what they asked
---
Maybe it's just xbox or something lol. Xbox has always been a bit salty lol
---
?
---
i mean idk how they would even know they have ds considering they aren't the obsession, they seemed to just do this hoping that they wouldn't have ds
---
I got to rank one by accident this week. I wanna go back.
---
yes
---
wow bruh good point! Thats such good game design and balance!! Happy cake day sir!
---
Hello
---
Is it me you're looking for?
---
Most of the time you aren't gonna get away, just try and stall the killer as long as you can
---
New Freddy is great and I'd dare say yes one of the best video game reworks I've seen
---
The purpose was originally to stall survivors. Include stalling them from leaving the match or sitting at the exit gate and teabagging. And that's not true. They could always just leave through the trap door with an active trap.
---
If a pig player saves a trap until the end of the match... It shouldn't lose its use. I think they should always be active if the exit gates have been powered. I barely even play this killer but she needs all the help she can get. Her Nerf gutted her end game capability.
---
Laughes in switch version
---
Next we're going to find out that demogorgon and Leatherface get nerfed.
---
Or, they hook you and you unhook asap when they literally cant have gotten farther than 15m
---
I will agree to a certain degree with you. If you mean the face. Yeah. 100%. But quentins posture is just Bad beyond repair.
---
I disagree with you.
---
Let me give an example. Yesterday i played a KYF with 3 guys. I was a no blink nurse in a 3v1 game. We had a bunch of fun with the long intense chases. For me the killer, it wasn't stressfull where i had absolutly had to end every chases in 20 seconds. I could take my time and was allowed mistakes. For survivors, it was fun for them to run me around much longer than usual.
---
Now i don't think all Killers should be as weak as a no blink nurse, but i think the ideal Killer strenght is around mid tier. So things like pig, freddy, GF, etc.
---
I think Killers like Nurse Spirit or even Billy needs a nerf to bring every Killers around mid tier.
---
And THEN once this is done, devs can safely bring in some sort of general killer buff, such as slowing gen repair speed or add a secondary objective, because as you explained, mid tier killers are not currently viable at red ranks.
---
It’s just practice to get back to where you were. Being rusty is unfortunately a thing that happens to everyone and the only way you can get over that is to practice. There are also players on YouTube who will help you get the hang of things a lot easier. I would recommend OhTofu, Monto and Ussylis for coming back into the game. I’m sure you’ll get back to where you were in no time :D
---
I know lol but it was to late for that

"when balancing, you should always consider the highest level of play possible, in this case SWF". You want everything to be balanced around SWF and this would fix nothing and add more difficulty for solo survivors.
---
Yes, some killers should definitely get buffed. That being said, not all killers are meant to be top tier and that's fine. And they shouldn't be reworked based on a possible SWF team. 
---
- Trapper should have traps as soon as the game begins
---
- LF just needs a little tweak that doesn't slow him down while raving his chainsaw
---
- Same goes for Clown when recharging his bottles
---
- Legion cannot be fixed. He just has a very poorly made mechanic and will remain in a broken state
---
Sometimes I like playing a game of “Protect the President” where I focus on getting one specific player out of the match
---
Did borrowed time work tho? If so then rip killer
---
I play spirit the most out of my killers, and I won’t say she’s the best but she is very powerful if you know how to use her power properly and mind game other players.
---
well but thats not really balance if it relies on getting not so good players, is it?
---
Seems not that bloody like I wanted

This video does a good job explaining how it could work and why it should happen. Not a huge Pennywise/It fan but this would be super interesting.

Hi!

Sorry!

Bye!

I don’t think he needs a nerf, I think he needs a patch to make his power actually work how it’s supposed to. Every game it’s a toss up on whether he can’t expose anyone, or he can expose me through walls and other bullshit.

"Peekaboo!"

&gt; And while they are strong they require skill to play.
---
This is irrevelant. Yes they require skill, but they're still broken if used masterfully.
---
The reason nurse is broken is that even while all pallets are up, and even if the survivor makes no mistake, a master nurse will catch the survivor easily.

Babysitter and We’ll Make it cannibalize each other. Run one or the other for max efficiency.

I had mistaken it for another game I saw once, somehow.

No reason to P3 her, that's not enough blood

Well we have endgame now so tht doesnt really matter tho. So it still is fine. Also its gunna be hard to leave threw a trap door with a active head gear on. If its active that means the last gen hasnt popped. Meaning a person has to have a key or the team has to find the hatch open the door n three ppl with no traps on their head leave n the 4th go thru a hatch that they found like its not very common since endgame n closing the hatch. Like yea theres ace in the whole n they could bring one but if we based the killers powers on literally every perk n every scenerio theyd be like rediculously OP. This game is like 50 percent chance and 50 percent skill. If we based survivors on how to get away from the killer in every possible outcomebtheyd also be rediculously over powered. Like dstrike it obviously wont be useful with moris in play should we change it so it is? Do u killer mains want original dstrike back?
---
When i use noed i almost every time give the last Survivor the hatch
---
This was true with old DS ages ago. Skill check now is well before pickup animation finishes, so swinging isn't even possible before your skill check hits or misses. You're just missing your DS.
---
As much as I love Robin, I do think Nancy was the better choice as she's been there from the start and has more outfit potential.
---
And hatch spawns right next to you. The only way to get luckier is to spot hex:ruin at the very start of the match.... and even that is debatable.
---
The Cannibal: *owey, that's hot!*

Dude I play Freddy but they seem to counter me so hard! The SWF know which pallets are fake and they throw them down across the map while I’m in a chase or they run over my snares while I’m chasing someone else to help their friends. It’s so frustrating!
---
I really like this idea
---
Shrek fills the butt of survivors he caught with love. For a minute after being downed you can't walk straight and thus are 10% slower.
---
Legion was better and way more fun to play before their nerf.
---
No One Left Behind is actually a useful perk.
---
The red generator and hook auras look just fine on Ormond.
---
I'm just referring to the fact that you can't put them on the ground in any way.
---
Imagine this happening when there are only two survivors alive. you downed one, the other (that was recently hooked) got into a locker. it's time for quality gameplay of waiting a minute in front of them
---
yes and I wouldn't want to be exactly for that reason.
---
The fact that they didn't even repair a single gen tells me it was the correct choice since I was capable to keep enough pressure all game. But whatever you say buddy, whatever you say!
---
OwO
---
It'd be an interesting concept for a secondary BP objective for killers, though i couldn't think of one that would fit the role, nor just be completely pointless 
---
But Would be funny if it was killer based, trapper has a repair bench for his traps, bingbong boi has to polish his bell, huntress has to sharpen her axe at a grind stone, Michael has to... already do what he does. Clown has eat 8 pounds of fried dough.
---
Its well known huntress even with iri/belt gets destroyed by swf
---
So your basically red swf beat a barely purple huntress grats
---
I think she needs a buff just not with her traps. Literally every killers traps arent necessarily designed to get a full on kill. Its to stall the game and sum instadowns. Asking for her to be uniquely designed compared to all the killers is honestly wanting too much. No one should completely rely on their traps to get full kills if u do ur gunna lose regardless of how nerfed or op she is.
---
The biggest issue with SWF is that the match making is broken. A lot of the time, if ranks are very diverse (say 16, 12, 8, 4), the Killer they will face will not be the average of their ranks, but instead something like a rank 13 killer.
---
Well I mean I only give the hatch if it is a baby Dwight or a big booty Jane but it counts
---
This happened to me once in a shack...checking both doors and window, and like the third time around, this fucko is leaning into a doorway checking out my booty, scared the shit outta me :'D
---
That’s exactly how games are now sadly
---
I've never seen someone go "I'm gonna report you for Tunnelling". I've heard "fucking Tunnelling killers. Ur the reason DS exists" (swap Tunnelling for camping and DS for BT and you get the same thing). I have seen killers go "you deserved that facecamp for cleansing my devour" or "lmao imagine thinking prayer beads is OP".
---
Gotta switch region and then u can switch it back once u got the game
---
&gt;so i should just purposely stick around mid ranks just to be able to have fun with my main? if everybody did that that would bring another host of problems. the game would just be frustrating for the survivors at those ranks
---
Do you not know how to read or are you purposely ignoring what I say? Since you are ignoring it, I will do the same from now on. 
---
They made ranking up as survivor an effortless task. The players you used to find around ranks 10 to 5 are now constantly at rank 1 because its just that easy.
---
People get to red ranks without knowing basic looping mechanics and wasting every pallet. 
---
Anyway, I am bored of this discussion already. Have a nice day.
---
Context has to bring something to the clip.
---
Either answer the question "how did we get there?" or tell a backstory with relevance to the plot.
---
It doesn't bring much here. The clip is solid on its own and requires no context.
---
Getting fucked by hitboxes too many times causes survivors to go mad :/
---
How
---
But we were all solo que players.
---
Pig is low tier, BHRV hates Pig, so Pig trys to get attention.
---
What’s your average set up?
---
Where did you get the mask from? It looks like a good quality one.
---
So do you not want people to be rewarded for being skillful?? That sounds really dumb, your saying that a swordsman that has trained his entire life in the way of the sword should not have an advantage over a swordsman who spent the last 3 weeks training just because it’s unfair to the lesser weaker swordsman. Also it’s pretty hypocritical as your ignoring the fact that survivors can be broken when used by masters and are in swf.
---
I forget the whole process and in the hospital so it’s hard to think, I just searched a vid on YouTube and it showed me
---
I would definitely play more survivor if the BPs weren't so bad, i like playing survivor. i find it way more relaxing. and honestly, i can agree with rank 10 and 12, but from my experience when you start to get into purple ranks (especially 5 and 6) camping stops being effective at all, and tunneling is even less effective because there's no pressure on any of the gens AND you're wasting time with nobody on hook.   
---
Not to say that tunneling and camping aren't shitty practices, the 8k or less BP wit ha depip all because a killer chose an inoptimal strat to say "fuck your experience particularly" does feel bad, but i can shrug that off much easier than i can toxic survivors or when i make bad plays and get stomped because of it
---
I can hear his laughs echoing in my head
---
What? Looking at your profile I’m gonna assume English isn’t your main language, not sure you understand what I meant. I’m saying you used the wrong word. It’s not “butt”, there’s a separate word you wanted “but”.
---
I like the idea but rather than overall progress taking gas, it should be overall time taken and the current progress. Like lets say you put the gas in get the gen to 25% and have to dip the gas will slowly tick down but not as fast if you had it at say,75%. Also would this be in the off hand or something or would it replace the item?
---
I'm for that, even addon's that could lower his terror radius.
---
Timer kicked in and i fell asleep. The alarm clock was across the map tho.
---
Tbh i've had doctor games where i honnestly think i outplayed the survivors fairly well and caught all of them reasonably fast, but still lost because the gens are just done really fast.
---
Against good SWF that hit mostly great skills checks and waste no time, you need either a killer that ignores pallets (nurse/spirit) or a killer with insane pressure that 1 hit down (billy).
---
And correct me if I’m wrong but I believe it’s iOS only?
---
Omfg your heart must be beating so damn fast. These are the moments why I continue playing this game. GG
---
Ew wtf is on neas face
---
iri head, noed, ebony huntress holy shit that's really sad
---
People who farm don't usually accuse the killer of tunnelling though, its the person unhooked.

Killers: we want something to counter aura reading so Surviviors can't see us with Object of obsession. 
---
Also killers: aura blindness sucks

Neither does "nobody", if neither work, then it shouldn't have been a meme in the first place
---
It sounds like a porn when Nancy does it
---
Peanits literally stated the exact same thing about Ghost face after his first PTB rework to his decent state. Something along the lines of "We do not have any plans to adjust ghostface at the moment." They announced the "nerfs" the next day.
---
Oh well yeah I consider myself a genius... Ok dude, jokes apart I don't want her traps to be OP, but at the moment they aren't a threat at all, especially when you get it off in your first or second attempt11

It'd definitely be a start. He's got some broken add-ons (Broken as in don't work), and he could definitely use some better add-ons in general, but I feel like lowering his Terror Radius would be a shot in the arm for arguably the weakest killer in the game now that Freddy got buffed.
---
&gt;If it's supposed to stall then why does it kill?
---
...bc where's the threat if it doesn't? It gives you a reason to stay off of gens, the threat of death is enough of a reason to say "yeah let's go not do gens"
---

---
Doesn't help that the tick rate for the check seems to fluctuate between smooth 60 fps and other times looking like it's running at less than 12 fps
---
Anakin: I was just about to say that..
---
I didn't say it was her fault. It was and always is the fault of the survivor who does the unhooking. Not the killers fault, and it isn't tunneling. Going after the unhooked person in front of you being tunneling is a "survivor rule". It's simply being a good killer - hit the target of opportunity if they're literally right in front of you, THEN go after the other person. Duh.

---
Let's not throw a party until ~~we're out of the city~~ it's been officially confirmed.
---
Lol that loop made it look like it bugged out and set the timer back some
---
I might start doing this...I always rationalized it by saying it's the team's fault, but I need to be the change I want to see 🥺
---
Members of an ingroup will vastly overestimate their own performance compared to the outgroup in most situations. If the game has a sensible matchmaking system, the people you pulled should be of average skill compared to your premade party.
---
I don''t understand what the word "toxic" even means anymore. It just feels like that word gets thrown around whenever people don't like something. The objective of the survivor is to power generators and escape via hatch or exit gate. The objective of the killer is to kill the survivors. If your only objective is to power gens, how could you possibly "gen rush"? If you're trying to hook and kill survivors, how can you "hook rush"? It just reminds me of when people use tryhard as an insult. How much or how little should you try to win the match? What level of trying is acceptable and how does one measure it?
---
I understand that it sucks being hooked early and even dying very quickly. However, I don't see how it's considered toxic behavior. It's part of the game. I wouldn't even consider the post game shit talk as toxic. That's just bad sportsmanship. Unfortunately, anonymity enables that bad behavior.
---
theres a timer on blood warden. I have a p3 freddy. Trust me, theres no addon that requires you to be awake in order to leave.
---
Robin is lovely but it is def Nancy’s spot.
---
I mean EXACTLY that.
---
Play stealthy, get dark clothing for Claudette or Adam.
---
Fuck, I really hoped you'd get it in time. Feels bad
---
If this was a slot machine you would have lost? Meg meg nea :( /s
---
It's fine buddy
---
&gt; They can also take the trap door while the Trap is active
---
Theyve always been able to do that
---
Around Rank 8. I’m on console, so maybe that has something to do with it.
---
I've been kill rushing. Oh shit. I guess at this point all I can do is uninstall the game and play civilization, wouldn't want to ruin survivors' fun by playing the game.
---
That's...pretty specific
---
"gutted"
---
Nah, Dreams
---
Oh buddy, i know how blood warden works. It blocks both exits for ALL survivors for 30-60 seconds. Still doesnt explain why i couldnt leave.
---
Thanataphobias slowdown really isnt that much though. Its 16% at maximum, and thats if everyone is injured or hooked. BBQ is a much better choice even when people expect it, because they have to leave their gen or let you see them on it. 
---
 
---
According to your calculations, a survivor that cant reliably hit ruin checks takes 100 seconds to complete a gen, meaning ruin gives you +20 seconds a gen. Thanataphobia at max (meaning everyones injured, dying, or hooked) only gives you +12.8 seconds. And thats if the entire team is injured, which is rare.
---
 Its certainly not a bad build, and the +12.8 seconds isnt useless if played right, but it wont matter if your being given a tour of every pallet on the map or waste time looking for people
---
Even the 2level player is a quitter... wow.
---
But that’s how lobbies are designed now. They changed it a few patches back.
---
Spirit if you dont have her. Weak perks (fury at the a push, stridor I find to be a hindrance more than a help) but a cracking killer. Clown is also strong, Pop Goes The Weasel I run at rank 1 as a must-have as I don't run ruin. Bamboozle has a niche purpose as well making for two decent perks. Coulraphobia is mostly meh except on meme doctor builds ;P
---
*Anotha one*
---
Do bones.
---
People troll in every game.  Every single one.  If you go to any other gaming sub w a medium/large playerbase toxicity is always one of the main gripes.  The issue is so much bigger than DbD.
---
It feels good to get compliments as survivor or killer. I've played a few Freddy games (he's my new main) against...ohh....rank...15ish survivors, and despite that I decimated them all fairly quickly, endgame was like "Dang, you're actually a really good Freddy! GG!". I always appreciate when people don't take things personally on either side. I'm not flashlighting you as a survivor to be toxic, I just want extra time to run away. I'm not hooking you a 3rd time as killer because I "have it out for you", I just want to win. That sort of thing.
---
What feels the best for me though is when I farm with survivors or we all decide to dick around. I know most killers don't do this, but I have no problem with taking it really casual or farming if someone DCs or I see people lagging to shit. Every time I've done that I've been met with a lot of "Thank you soooo much! Love you!" and so forth. That feels more rewarding to me than just slaying the other 3 or whatever.
---
It's what specific tier your perk is at. If you've unlocked a perk, it stays at tier 1 until you see it again in the bloodweb. If you unlock the same perk in the bloodweb you're turning it from a tier 1 to a tier 2 perk, making it better. All perks can't go past tier 3.
---
The cycle of life and death continues..
---
Is... is this a shitpost or an actual suggestion
---
I have my skill check keybind on M5 so I don't have to hit the skill check with my elbow. I can't hit Ruin at all because my frames are trash. I've never had 6 skill checks in 10 seconds but I've had a skill check right as I get off the generator. Sometimes I get lucky and it's just the sound notification of it.
---
That’s good especially with the perks they had.
---
Oh my god that's unlucky
---
im gonna follow u bruh
---
Damn it sounds somewhat the same. NE
---
I was waiting for the "omg you wouldn't have survived on Xbox live mah d00d XD" comment. There is literally always at least one of you. Jfc you halo kids would have quit in frustration during the old Quake days.
---
See? I can do it too.
---
The problem is with the game design and maps.
---
Survivors want killers to be like Wraith or Leatherface for example. Where they can use pallets and loops to defend themselves. Killers feel this offers little counterplay
---
Killers want killers to be like Nurse or Spirit, where they can get hits without requiring survivors to make mistakes. Survivors feel this is unfair and has little counter play.
---
The devs idea of more pallets but far less safe pallets is probably the best idea going forward.
---
She might have just wanted some nasty kills and to de pip?? Sort of backfired. I would read into it too much. It’s just a game, bet it was fun to escape v that setup. 
---
gg
---
You are the scummiest of scum. You are worse than the dirt beneath my feet.
---
I think it’s the Legacy Skin
---
prestige 3 so its means he prestiged him 3 times which is the max amount
---
You're the LITERAL scum of the earth. Nobody wants you to play this game because you are the most cancerous player in the game. Why even play the game at this point if you want to be this unfun?
---
I also mainly play both of these. Overwatch is usually arcade/mystery heroes
---
Absolutely not. Stop it. Get some help lol
---
The "skillcheck right as you get off the generator" always seems to happen to me when a killer is coming towards me or very close in the immediate area. Every. Damn. Time.
---
For some reason i moved up the ranks pretty Quick, only have 3 lvl 35 killers and 2 survs, not a lot of good perks really
---
Yeah I think Gf is too funny looking to give a good scare
---
Yes
---
With Second Wind, the new meta build is here.
---
No Mither, Self-Care, Second Wind, Solidarity.
---
Medkit w/ syringe + styptic.
---
Even better is have the whole team run this build, and you will almost never be able to activate second wind or get effective use out of the insta heals.
---
killers hate this build.
---
You might be thinking Inner Strength, but that encourages you to do totems which is to strong.
---
Why does that matter ?
---
Does it count if 3 people disconnect and you hook the last guy? No
---
I have not seen one single post about someone asking or complaining that the killer should be nerfed lol the survivors however...
---
I meant you did great especially with what perks the survs used ds and borrowed time is a pain as a killer.
---
"Have you actually ever won a fight?"
---
And lose two pips as well as all the bloodpoints? Im sure thats exactly what a toxic killer wants lol.
---
Then those people are idiots. Point is still valid. And the fact that pallets had to be nerfed this fucking much and are *still* powerful should tell you something.
---
With that being said, this subreddit never has been a good example of the playerbase. Most people here are somehow simultaneously hyper toxic and overly sensitive. It's amazing to watch.
---
I reposted the meme with context
---
 survivors having less of a heads up, therefore reducing the distance in chase would help. I6 doesnt even have to me 16m ot could be like 25m and it would still be nice
---
Just when randoms start cleansing
---
You can still sabotage hooks nerd. Smh, I swear survivor mains just want to be toxic. Fucking gen rushers
---
This is dumb but for every out the open totem spot theres a ruin totem hidden in an alternate dimension visible only after completing Desert Treasure and obtaining the Ring of Visibility.
---
 Nice
---
I know, faced it before, but didn't see it used in this game tbh
---
Doctor is so perfect
---
Nope, just aint gona bother as I've read it before, reddits search function sucks moneky tits, and you are just calling me a liar at this point. You can find them if you want, I'm not going to baby you and find them for you. 
---
If your best argument is to call someone else a liar, cus anyone that disagrees with me must be, then I aint gonna talk to you. 
---
Hey, do unto others, I doubt what you said about the streamers are true, your just making it up. You are probably just a troll. bye bye
---
Yet another survivor main rant. Look here mate the game is heavily tilted towards survivors because once they get good they can bully killers with ease. Ruin is an absolute must in this game. RNG is RNG, but if you hit like... 80% of your greats ruin is gonna make you waste little time.
---
Ruin is only impactful enough if survivors can't consistently hit greats. So one of two things:  either this rant makes no sense because "you can hit skillchecks" or you're lying and you can't, which makes you a bad survivor.
---
I play both killer and survivor, but I find Ruin more frustrating on the killer perspective because they essentially have to give up a perk slot for something that can be useless if it gets found early, which happens pretty often.
---
Well I can't unhear that now lol
---
Hes good in chases he just needs more map pressure. He should have had a teleport like Freddy. When you get a large map like red forest and survivors split up on gens it leaves killers like him weak.
---
Maybe they didn’t get the chance. Didn’t they change how ds worked recently?
---
The first 30 seconds of match can feel unsatisfying and this idea would perfectly fit spooky theme
---
Yeah those are toxic besides bubba and billy and also your saying irihead isn’t toxic
---
Sounds like this entire playerbase has an issue with losing. How rare and special. Oh wait. Thats the literally every fucking multiplayer game in the history of mankind. Go figure.
---
Well done OP! Love bitchin Daddy Myers vids
---
It's an anti-tunnel perk now, if u get picked after a minute on the hook you can use it, before or after, useless
---
Practice practice practice. I've been playing for over a year now and I feel I'm JUST mediocre, try to remind yourself that it's just fun, surviving doesn't always mean you win. Focus on the amount of bloodpoints you receive each game and it might make you feel better. Keep up the hard work, you'll get there!
---
Ah that makes sense. I don’t play survs much unless it’s daily.
---
But what about your secondary objective? Stop fun-rushing
---
All of these replies are so nice!!! Thank you, I’ll definitely watch some youtube :)
---
That's not what I meant, I mean if three survivors were sacrificed and the LAST person dc's while on hook.
---
I wanted to know
---
You could always just mute voice chat. Just because you don't want it doesn't mean other's don't and it would help balance the game as a whole.
---
It’s mostly toxic survivors complaining how it’s “too op”
---
YoURe sUpPoSEd tO gIvE ThE LaSt sUrvIvoR HaTCh

thank u sm! for being so nice + good advice!

I wholeheartedly agree, I can't get enough of it so props to the design &amp; art teams.
---
Everyone is a little gay for jeff ;)
---
Where did you stick them?
---
*happy bing bongs*
---
who did you kill?
---
Playing in the middle ranks is weird getting 4k's with trapper, wraith, gf and Michael, and getting 1-2k's with Billy, huntress
---
Insidious or 8m should be an item
---
I am the troll? Are you projecting?
---
I said that one of the most "famous" non-toxic DbD streamers (Tru3talent) states that survivor's dc'ing is bad for the killers pip progress.  
---
You responded with: "Never trust streamers, because every streamer I encounter wants me to commit suicide."  
---
...Like what is that even of an argument LOL.
---
Then you responded with: "Well, what I am saying is fact, because I just know dude and everyone agrees with me, even DbD devs."  
---
I asked for a source.  
---
You responded with calling me a troll.  
---
You seem to be delusional. I'll leave it here.  
---
Have a good one :)
---
Bing bong your perks are wrong
---
thank you! good point, i hadn’t really thought about more blood points &gt; just surviving. 
---
hopefully! i still have lots of fun and love the game, just want to feel like I’m better at it lmao
---
I’m not mad I’m saying it’s a toxic perk
---
Ya I honestly switch a lot on trapper, legion and nurse. So the mid ranks are really mixed bag of people
---
ya this is fair, have to practice being able to be chased for longer than 3 seconds then lmao
---
I know, I literally just cut myself while listening to My Chemical Romance and saying all according to keikaku and pushing my glasses up. 
---
Now all I need for you to say "NANI!" in a very dramatic way so I can fully achieve my status as a man of culture.
---
Except I'm not bitching about teabagging lol why would I quit playing quake.
---
Halo is more popular and is much more well known for teabagging. Get out of here with your pedantic shit.
---
So annoying. On both sides. Sometimes I almost feel like the devs should ignore the community all together and just make the game as they intended but still tweak it themselves lol
---
Survivor main who occasionally plays killer, I personally think NOED is actually kinda fun and never really got the hate. It adds a lot of risk to everything you do in the endgame, from just making it to the exit to going for that last save, and combined with the EGC it adds a lot of tension that the game otherwise lacks imo. So I usually run it on the off times I play killer just to try and emulate that feeling for those I play against.
---
Yes I understand. Quick repetitiveness. Thstscwhats nice. Ybats also why people love FPS  hop on for 30 minutes Nd you've got at least 3 games in.
---
If you're using Overcharge, I'd swap it with Make Your Choice. At higher ranks, hitting Overcharge really isn't a problem and Make Your Choice really punishes hook rescues as long as you're not camping. 
---
If you're using NOED, Make Your Choice is a good alternative to NOED for punishing hook rescues because NOED isn't active for most of the game.
---
Even as a surv it's weird running around a rank 16 pig and being downed in the first 3 secs against a rank 20 freddy
---
Kate was the last survivor you saw that right?  That wasnt  tunneling
---
Keep your left-hand right where it is.  Use your right-hand to pick up your mouse and scratch yourself with it.
---
I've had survivors dip through gates with an active trap on multiple times. On top of the fact that she's literally trash tier, her already garbage kit is so bugged that it doesn't even trigger on times it's supposed to.
---
This is borderline arousing.
---
Her bush, eh?
---
Move over Jane ... Nancy is the locker queen now.
---
Change your region in the App Store to Denmark and use 3900for the zip code. Not sure if your still interested in playing mobile, but that’s how I was able to download the game.
---
This is appropriate, since the skillcheck needle moves as smoothly as Theresa May walks.
---
Congratulations dude! That's kinda hard to accomplish, specially with just one perk!
---
Karma farming. Stahhhhp lol
---
Pig is best killer. Sneaky sneaky. Shhhhhh
---
Omfg that's worth it im honestly laughed so hard! :p
---
This looks like lbp
---
Scoops Ahoy.. more like.. Scoops Goodbye
---
to be fair its huntress on console. its probably not as easy to aim hatchets with a controller. some people probably feel the need to use all this stuff to do well with her while on PC this is basically overkill.
---
Ya that’s a lot of fun but can be due to perks often.

Lol armor piercing hatchets?? Nice I’m down for that! It was always nice in Battlefield 3-4 to snipe someone in the head and sometimes take out 2 of them!
---
Expecting pig lunge to apply on hits like sloppy butcher or anything else LUL bottom tier killers don't get to have interactions with any perks or effects.
---
Gray Killer alert.
---
Thx, it feels pretty good after being cucked by swf over and over again on huntress and Billy
---
They should only listen to 50/50 players. "Mains" are generally twats and can't be trusted on balance.
---
Let’s all be honest here, the killers lunge is a bit too much tho. Like instant piggy lunge with no downsides to it? Ok.
---
This. If anything reveal is broken and needs to be fixed.
---
This should definitely not be the case, her trap should force survivors to find the boxes.
---
The premise there is that so much of this game is balanced around survivors not having constant communication. So many survivor perks are perks that give information, either to them about other survivors, or to other survivors about them or the killer.
---
When you have SWF groups with voice chat you tilt that balance in a way that was never intended. Matthieu Cote has gone on record saying he never intended for SWF to exist, but it had to be implemented so that friends could play together.
---
When you have survivors that can communicate information such as generator locations, what perks the killer likely has, where the killer is, etc,. you end up with teams that can prevent the killer from having any agency in the gameplay. That hurts killers desire to play, and since you need killers to have a match, it hurts the health of the game.
---
Sorry to hear about your bad experiences
---
I can't wait for all the great spirit players tell us all the creative ways on how to counter her, without Iron Will :) 
---
Also standing still is a mindgame.

c̶r̶a̶c̶k̶ h̶e̶a̶d̶ crystal meth

My brothers and I join lobbies together, but we never bring any items.  Unless we got one from the previous match and forgot to put it in our inventory.
---
I agree about what you said with BBQ, it does counter camping and tunneling... Kind of anyways.
---
But with WGLF, unhooking teammates isn't a playstyle, it's something we have to do in order to keep the game going and escape. New players will pick that up fairly quickly. I know I did.
---
Also, new players don't play David as often as they play Meg, Claudette or Dwight. By the time they end up going for Davids perk they'll likely know how to play and use the perk for farming like everyone else.
---
It needs another effect. Nothing major, but something.
---
I try to avoid putting them on that hook if I can...
---

---
Id put pig over legion, doctor, bubba, wraith, and clown tbh.
---
Nah this sub is actually filled with killer mains who agree with dumb statements.
---
Oh no, you called me a Grey killer just like the other guy! Whatever will I do?!
---
Thai is cool. You are a good artist. I hope drew gets good buffs and needs before it's completely live
---
Or the best is watching the hex go right by in plain sight as I carry them to the hook.
---
Not get better at the game, that's for sure. *dabs*

---
np. Anytime you need a 'wake up' call you just let me know.

O- oh... makes sense

This is why people should run BT in every build

Seal Team Survivor is why I don't play this game very much anymore.
---
I would let them go as the Killer

Oh no you didn't, you also called me bad! And you dabed! This is too much for me, please stop!

---
HE HE HE
---
You must be a really good killer ;)
---
Don't worry. When the new stranger dlc comes out, you'll have rank 20's left and right just wanting to play as those characters. Anyways it's not dead, I have the same problem but I learned to just wait
---
The game saves a variety of statistics but it does not save info on BP spent on a character or kills performed by an individual killer, nor average result. It does save matches played by killer though.
---
Hey man I have nothing against broken keys by themselves.  While it's a strong item, easily top-two best in game it's still possible to beat them if you're good enough.  But Prayer Beads takes all the counterplay out of the broken key.  Prayer Beads over here crutching another player up through red ranks...
---
As a Jane main I offer our head on saves for the new players, oh and the thiccness
---
It's still a win-win situation
---
*dabs at a deeper angle*
---
Wait, I know I've downed someone with NoeD using the ambush, was there a new update that nerfed the pig even MORE
---
The point was both sides are capable of making baseless and ridiculous complaints and have done so here in this very subreddit. The DBD official forums aren't much different from here tbh.
---
you cant gen rush without one finger on m1
---
In this picture is Spongebob effectively licking his own ass?
---
Which is why my concept was an effect outside of chases. Idk what else you can do
---
Those are pretty bad ideas.
---
He’s a basic attack killer. You’re not supposed to use the chainsaw to chase people or for map pressure or any kind of mobility. The chainsaw is there to take care of pallets and stopping survivors that left you gain enough bloodlust. 
---
And I don’t have to mention how lame instantadowns are especially when you can’t escape it. We really don’t need LF to have a perk literally built into him. He’s fine the way he is just whack people and you’ll be fine.
---
At least we can agree they are both queens
---
Dead by daylight will never have shrek as a killer because all the other killers were previously human. There’s no way they would have the entity take a fictional character and make it a killer in the game
---
Don't know if potato Billy or god Feng.
---
Why not both to be fair?
---
That's the tier of the perk. The more there are, the better it is
---
A pro gamer move pig
---
Poor baby hatch.
---
Jane is a goddess , but wait until the dlc drops. Nancy’s closet perk actually works.
---
Oh buddy thats desperate
---
16M terror radius is too small on anybody.  Monitor takes that down to 8M...he is basically Myers with a stalk free instadown.
---
The pig is not legion but close

Talking about purple-rank players like that is like those "5'9" vs 6'0"" memes where the 5'9" is represented by Danny Devito.

Chases Survivior 1, chases Survivior 2. Ignores Survivior 3 and chases Survivior 1 when unhooked

trust me its pretty easy

im not very good with her thats why at least shes not in the only fun with addons category its garbage category
---
If someone tells you nurse is trash on console, they're lying to keep you from unlocking her power. She's still the best killer even on console.
---
SOMEBODY
---
At that point, the objective becomes chasing and surrounding the killer to try and trap them.
---
With enough people, you could do it even if they're attacking you. You just heal each other faster than they can attack.
---
How are you running so damn fast?
---
She is a goddess! With the combined forces of head on and Inner strength we will be unstoppable, also quick and quiet lmao
---
Could you be a little more specific lol, what do you mean you ”couldn’t leave”? What stopped you from leaving?
---
I've had gens done with 0 skill checks and didn't realize there even was ruin. It's just random luck.
---
i have no idea, it randomly happened on the ptb
---
He doesn’t need any buffs he’s fine where he is
---
There's a bit of it on both sides. It comes from players being unwilling to play both sides
---
Play how you want, in the end it's just a game, there's some "unspoken rules" all to help survivors really but it doesn't matter, you kill them you kill them, personally I don't like to camp, it's not fun, I'd rather take two people out of the game for a shorter time than one person for a long time, you get more points not camping anyway. So just play how you will, and don't worry if it's "okay" because if survivors aren't at the advantage it's not okay, that's how the community works.
---
Well done.  Perfect game running 1 weak perk on a weak killer and playing more than fair as evidenced by the opponents scores.  I wish some of the babykillers on this sub were on here to see how it's done.
---
The only skin I ever bought.
---
i do not approve.
---
Don't scorn my dad jokes. And stop lying on the internet, it's making my job harder trying to convince everyone that everything they read on the internet is true.
---
Exactly how is it toxic? Because it one hits a survivor? By that logic pink addons for medkits are toxic because they fully heal a survivor with one tap. Because it makes the killer faster? Hope, Adrenaline, Sprint Burst, Balanced Landing, and Lithe. It does nothing a survivor can't counter with the right perks or play.
---
Claudettes with urban evasion
---
Damn right
---
Dude, that was absolutely glorious, had me laughing the whole way through. I mostly play killer and while yes I want a chance to actually down someone I don't understand the whole "gen rushing is toxic" argument, if you can't down someone and the other three are still doing generators stop chasing them and go for the others
---
It's rng. I've done entire gens without getting a skillcheck. It's sucks but that's probably the best way for it to be.
---
Thank you for the kind words good sir, but i do belive Im still a baby killer myself
---
Gotta do what you gotta do
---
Thank you so much 😊
---
Like i said before: someone had to unhook her unless she was lucky enough for the 4%. If that other person left after unhooking her and Myers didn‘t even see the other survivor then yes, it wasn‘t tunneling. If Myers saw the other survivor but downed Kate and made the other survivor leave then yes, it is tunneling for me.
---
Okey dokey
---
You seem to have severe confusion surrounding Freddie's power.  Being asleep does jack shit you could have escaped at anytime.  All being asleep does is let him teleport more often and makes it so his dream snares and pallets affect you.
---
Always happens to me. The one time the killer did actually have NOED and I cleansed all of the totems, however, was worth all the time it was pointless. He had an EG build. I hate to think of the mess that would’ve ensued had he been able to use it.
---
Monitor and abuse should be high tier,24 meters is usually enough to react.Overcharge is good but only one skill check and requires to quick the gen,I would say mid tier. You cannot always find the myc guy,so myc mid tier.The debuffs from tanatophobia are not that big,I would say mid tier.Haunted ground,thrill and stridor have short duration,requires to be a high mobility killer or needs to be close to an injured survivor.Pwyf is trash,you need to find the obsession and lose a chase(then rince and repeat),and you loose a stack each time you attack.Dark devotion requires to hit the obsession and the terror radius change is too short(low tier).Deerstalker and knockout should be mid tier,since they greatly help when you need to slug.Iron grasp and agitation can be extremely strong to get a basement hook,and basement hooks are a lot of pressure on the survivor team.Then,rancor can be usefull if you are chasing the obsession at the end of the game and if there is a survivor near you when a gen pops.
---
You are velcome
---
This whole paragraph is just about 3 words "buff weak killers" and there is not much of opinions on how to do that, but just a fact that they need to buff them.
---
I think his perks are fine honestly
---
I mean they did that to Freddy at first
---
I actually typically love that hairstyle too, I run it on a lot of my game characters when it's an option but it just doesn't sit right in DbD for some reason.
---
https://youtu.be/j2K8SILr3ls this might help :)
---
It’s not easy to dodge, but you definitely can, because you loose the ability to turn for the major of the Lunge
---
True, if anything the aura-reading part is still useful
---
If it was PTB you can't be banned for it
---
Had a game a week ago with a dude like this. He was immersed in a corner with the killer on the other side of the map. He let me progress into stage 2 of the hook before he unhooked me. 
---
The guy just crouched around the map constantly, not even doing gens. I messaged him, politely, to look up some survivor guides on YouTube so he could help his team better. 
---
He replied that I died first and his strategy is called 'creeping.' 
---
Of fucking course he was playing Claudette, too.
---
You need to have Thrill, Ruin, Haunted Grounds, and then Devour or Lullaby. Every totem is lit, and you can snipe them outside of your terror radius. On most maps, even if most survivors start a totem at the exact same time, you have the range to knock them off of it. It can even shock the basement of the preschool while you're on the ground level outside in the street.
---
Repost
---
I agree, but if they didn’t listen to the community we wouldn’t have some of the good things we have now
---
First time here sorry
---
If you’re bad at winning chases or prolonging then, start using stealth perks and focus on gens only.
---
Use Urban Evasion, Sprint Burst, Spine Chill, Calm Spirit, Sabo to deny hooks in certain places, Premonition, Quick And Quiet. There are other play styles than just being a looper. Dwight’s perks are also useful, and if you want you can even go with a healer play style and use Empathy, We’ll Make It,  AfterCare, Autodidact, Buckle Up, Borrowed time, Distortion, Poised, Vigil.
---
None of these perks are “meta” but they’re garbage either. The new survivors coming with the Stranger Things chapter are also heavily support focused. There’s tons of other play styles and perk combos to use.
---
Well that’s the point. There is no counter to a basic attack lunge. It’s like saying find a counter to Legion before his nerf. Like you ain’t gonna find anything lol.
---
Why did I read that to the beat of Michael Jackson's Beat It?
---
What do you think stopped you from escaping? It was those pesky, meddlesome dream demons again, wasn't it? This is literal violence.
---
The devs said the traps were not intended to prevent Surviviors from escaping. They were meant to stall generators. So you are literally wrong.
---
Me: I don't need swf to rank up as survivor.
---
My team:
---
If someone uses console as an excuse for just about anything in this game besides framerate they are full of crap. People overexaggerate how hard killers like nurse or huntress are on console, when in reality, its not too different from pc at all.
---
just imagine a gremlin hunched over a phone at max brightness in a dark kitchen and you've pretty much got the picture :P
---
The idea is that you are permanently injured, but can tank that one extra health-state of damage at least one time. 
---
This perk is made to counter “exposed status effect” and gives you that extra hit resistance in other situations.
---
However, as this perk is quite strong, it need a restriction. In this case, not working on the generators for some considerable time.
---
I had a hex totem that was hidden quite well for a long time during a match that I eventually forgot it. Ruin doesn't last that long so I just assumed the survivors popped it at some point. I only remembered it was even there because I hooked a survivor in front of it late game.  Then the totem was destroyed when the survivor got unhooked
---
I use it purely so I can max the objective asap and then focus on altruism + boldness but I could see running something like dead hard or another perk working out if you’re wanting to take it slower but have more chance or survival
---
[Version without watermark](https://i.imgur.com/kESaJLI.jpg)
---
No one said he should have a perk build into him, at all. Just lower his TR and he'd be pretty good.
---
And no, Bloodlust is there to prevent Chases from going on too long, not to activate a power. No Killer's power should prevent you from using it until you've been in a chase for 15 seconds minimum.
---
Also, unless you've got it pre-charged, it's faster to just kick a pallet than saw it. And if you've got it Pre-charged, the Survivors probably don't need to drop the pallet in the first place since you move a lot slower.
---
That's not well known at all.  Huntress is one of the killers least affected by a SWF.  They beat an insanely bad crutched out NOED gamer posing as a huntress.  You literally need to be a potato to do that shit running all that.  She ran out of armpits to keep the crutches.
---
Even faster gens is what this game needs.
---
In a perfect world with perfect internet, we could hit those greats with practice, but with lag, fuck that. And fuck any skill in which rng tells the player that they can't do shit until they go do bones.
---
They should just make mori a thing for final hooks. I’m down to get mori’d if I’m about to be sacrificed anyway.
---
Moriying tbaggers is pretty fun sometimes ngl
---
The look on their faces when it happens is priceless
---
The mori needs to go tho, thats a fact
---
I had a similar line of thinking as well. I guess I just need to get better at actually pulling off the boldness/altruism acts now. Lol. I feel utterly useless with a flashlight sometimes.
---
"SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIM"
---
I still get it
---
(Salty survivor added you to a circle)
---
Wow. Well done. I wish we could play this game with 4k graphics
---
And then blood warden and noed get him a 4k XD
---
“Lower his terror radius” 
---
Half of Monitor and Abuse. 
---
That’s the point of me saying that about bloodlust. He’s not SUPPOSED to chainsaw you instantly. He’s a BASSIC ATTACK KILLER. He doesn’t need any changes.
---
Not really, since he has to charge his chainsaw and messing up with it  stuns him.
---
(Stealth) Myers only insta-downs while people are holding onto things, and there is next to no warning he is coming. Bubba with a tiny radius would still have to charge his chainsaw, so you'd get a (very loud and sudden) warning that he was coming.
---
IT'S 
---
#PARTY TIME!!!!
---
Come get your hats on!
---
In general, just fuck skills in which rng can say "Yeah, this guy's not allowed to do anything." Right now I'm playing Tapp, use all my damned Stakeout tokens damn near instantly and am still getting fucked with Ruin. It's bullshit.
---
i guess then lf wouldnt be usless then
---
Pc
---
I knew it was going to be that before I watched.
---
I think the man died :(
---
Where do you think ;)
---
Run gen regressing perks and try to down people as fast as possible
---
His strength is catching people in the open away from loops.  He does that and the down is free af.  Such a tiny terror radius allows him to do this too reliably.  No killer has a default terror radius that small.  There's a reason for that.  It isn't balanced.  If you want to do anything to him try and make the act of using his saw a little easier by adjusting slow down values or something.
---
I'm soooooo sorry ;( I feel terrible!
---
Groovy!
---
Also known as Michael "Jordan" Myers.
---
Huh, I didn't know Hag and Spirit had a built in Monitor and Abuse. I just thought their Terror Radius was smaller. It's not like I'm saying "Increase his TR in a chase and give him a Wider Field of View" or anything. It's literally lowering his terror radius.
---
And yeah, Bubba needs help. He's the weakest killer in the game by far now that Freddy has been reworked. And no other Killer requires BL in order to use their power. Going by what you're saying, you might as well play Trapper and never set a trap.
---
Spot on with this. As a killer I'd love to run other perks for once but nope gotta run Ruin on a killer that's not Nurse or I'll get crushed.
---
the 3 people that stayed for Endgame Chat called me a tunneler, and even the people that aren't dead accuse me of tunneling when I'm not.
---
Hahahahah oh boy
---
If your cocky enough to stand in front of the hook and try to bodyblock leatherface I’m gonna drop the survivor and chainsaw you 
---
Then it becomes the game of hook and slug.
---
This is just myers at tier 3
---
It's a sad but true statement. That's why we have to come up with other things to set as goals in order to ensure we get some sort of sense of accomplishment.
---
If Surge doesn't work with it, then Exposed shouldn't.
---
I mean I’m on console and don’t seem to struggle with ruin with lag or poor frame rate, I really don’t see it as an issue. Games without it go by too quickly and you can’t pip as you are out before long.
---
Remember, you being injured will render you unable to do gens effectively, and will force you to  get healed. 
---
But you will run slightly faster, to both find other survivor quicker and run away from the killer.
---
Just remove the bitch ass stranger things dlc
---
Really? I haven’t seen anyone else crying about Leatherface. Maybe I’m looking in the wrong sub.
---
Purchased and prestiged him day 1 of release.
---
I only play killer unless friends want to play together.
---
BASIC ATTACK KILLERS, like Doc, Myers, Hag, Legion, LEATHERFACE, Plague, and wraith.
---
Well no shit killers are going to be considered garbage when you have NURSE BILLY SPIRIT and HUNTRESS in game. Comparing him to other makes him garbage. Him as a killer in general, he’s fine.
---
The difference here is pig is literally trash. Worst killer in game. Freddy got reworked entirely so you can’t even mention him. 
---
I like how you instantly jumped to the whole “who do you play??? Are you a survivor main????? You obviously don’t play x killer!!!?”
---
I played him at rank 1 back when I cared enough to go that far. He’s FINE. If you’re doing bad with him you’re just not good and should find a more easy killer to play. Perhaps Freddy since he’s the most easy mode killer in game now.
---
I normally don't fuss about this, because it's rude and pedantic. But I just need to express how impressed I am that you managed to fit 7 spelling/grammar errors into an 8-word sentence.
---
Butt = rear end of a biological creature

PTB is for testing. Why would they ban on the PTB?
---
How did me saying noed is toxic start a argument
---
 The developers say a lot of shit. They said survive with friends breaks the game balance early on. They said they had no intentions of voice communication ever being a part of the game. Yet now they are fine with third-party voice communication. They are fine with survive with friends abusing the rank system. They are fine with stream sniping.
---
The developers go back on their word more than the Reddit community troll posts.
---
The pig wasn't even overpowered. There was nothing wrong with saving the traps for the endgame. You still have multiple survivors to juggle who could easily just get a key and take the hatch or even better yet remove the reverse bear traps before escaping. You realize the pig was mid-tier and literally no one was complaining about her? Or do you just want everybody to play nurse spirit and hillbilly Beyond Rank 10 leading to no variety and boring or frustrating gameplay?
---
There are lots of killer powers and perks that are used for reasons beyond their intended purpose and often have better results that way. For example Plag. Survivors are intended to heal with the fountains but never do if they have a brain. That totally counters her and renders her power useless for the most part. Moving her from a high-tier killer to a low-tier. Or even better yet. Leatherface has a chainsaw intended to take out multiple survivors at once. It's pretty much useless in that regard and you're lucky to get one Survivor with it at all. Instead it's basically used for camping and there's a reason why Leatherface has an Infamous reputation for No One escaping his basement. It's because that yields better results than chasing people with him. Sure it's looked down upon or seen as scummy but it's just as valid as using Omega blink nurse or insta heal Survivor with Ds and adrenaline
---
Not on PC but that sounds hilarious seeing everyone bring streamers except for you.
---
Oi josuke i used za hando to erase balance from the game
---
Two of us managed to escape out the exit gate
---
I'm not saying it shouldn't be 4%, I'm saying it's not 4%, but much less
---
Switch out iron grasp for thrilling tremors
---
Switch out Spies for Sloppy Butcher
---
Switch out No one escapes death for Whispers, try to get the fully leveled version first though
---
When you pick someone up with thrilling, you can see what gens are being worked on, which is helpful.
---
With sloppy, healing takes longer, which is good as well
---
Whispers lets you know when people are nearby, which lets you know to be sneaky
---
Id recommend getting some perks from the shrine of secrets, as most of the perks you have arent great for ghostface besides thrilling tremors

I used to play with urban and it really saved my ass sometimes, but i think it‘s not really necessary. I don‘t care if people use it when the killer is near, but i don‘t get why some people crouch walk the whole time
---
Sorry. Ill just chase survivor 3 for 5 minutes so that everyone can get healed and leave. If youre healed and going for a save its not tunneling to stop you

I have 200 hours so enough to realize that 4% is a lie, it's 0.05%

I keep seeing this on the subreddit, but I always see solos joining alone, wait a while, then a a 2-man SWF joins because they spawn in together, the 4th slot will be empty for a bit, and finally then the final solo will join.

I've never had all four spawn together unless it was actual SWF.

New killer: The Ogre
---
No set date. If we do the math we can speculate that it will most likely be September 17th. However, this is just conjecture based on previous patterns and the projection of Dedicated Servers supposedly being released before the calendar end of summer, so don't take my word for it. Just the best guess at this time.
---
I resonate strongly with this statement.
---
Do you or do you not think it's 4%? That's what I'm asking
---
Try restarting your router. Plus try playing huntress, she hard but rewarding when Mastered.
---
In fact "fail a gen" is even more accurate than just "skillcheck" because there are many different types of skillchecks in the game, and the only failed skillcheck causing this animation is the failing a gen skillcheck.
---
I will try this, thank you xD
---
Also no toxic good nurse players
---
Not sure off the top of my head, but its really only useful if you know how to throw hatchets well since being bad at hatchet throwing means that your extra locker time is kinda wasted since you need to find those red boxes more if you miss and miss....... Man i need to git gud
---
I don't know why people think he is upper mid tier?
---
Her dash no longer works with any perks that expose and that's a crazy nerf.
---
If she dash, she warns the survivor much more than a Wraith it does when he gets visible. In addition to that, he has an add-on for that, she has not.
---
Her traps are okay, but you have to lose them before endgame .. sounds stupid and yes it is. There is no more tactic you can use, that sucks. In addition to that, in my last 5 games everyone lost the trap after first or second try.. That's disgusting. I wish it wouldn't be that luck based.
---
And last but not least, her stealth is like with every other killer.. If they use this cat perk, your stealth ist useless

Game over, Meg

Ghostface's comment to this: HHHHHHHHH.
---
Yeah, I didn't know about the outfit until I saw it at a distance. Legit thought it was nea in a hoody until I put them on a hook. 
---
Hooked me enough right then to but it post match
---
A wholesome meme, been for too long since I last saw one of those. Here, take my karma &lt;3
---
"No"
---
The issue is there are quite a few people who DO enjoy being excessively toxic on purpose and as the old saying goes "a few bad apples spoil the bunch" that being said, I seem to get REALLY unlucky as a killer and always seem to get the toxic survivors
---
In my region (Eastern North America) on PS4 killer is almost always faster to que than survivor. It depends on the balance of number of players trying to play either role at any given time and can fluctuate. You might find certain time at certain days of the week when it is hard to find a survivor match and it is quick getting in as killer.
---
All killers have it
---
The lunge is perfect the way it is. Fairly easy to dodge while still good. If you think it’s actually op just get fucking look behind you and not run in a straight line.
---
So, Mr Slave from South Park?
---
Scoops..haha. Scoops ahoy hahaha
---
Or you get the camping trapper with a basement build
---
FrightNite? Really..?
---
My guess is that the Entity would torture any survivors who would try that.
---
That's my point. His isn't activating the same way it activates on other killers.
---
Don’t let players who tell you not to bring certain things discourage you. It’s a competition, anything within the bounds of what the devs allow is fair game, do what you gotta do to win
---
Never bothered to play much as the trapper. There's plenty of ways to piss of survivers but I just wish they'd stop taking things so seriously.
---
Honestly, loved this, but like, to be fair, gens r pretty fast, especially with toolboxes, but thats an issue with toolboxes not gens, I'd recommend just upping gen time by a bit
---
How do accidentally Mori a baby dwight tho?
---
THEN you can start to work on the generators.  God damn that ending was perfect.  I'm not usually as amused by these shitposts but this one was pretty well done.
---
So, I was called a whore, and I replied that I was actually a man, and jokingly called him an incel. I thought it was a mild reply, but apparently not. I was banned. I asked why that was, and I get the feeling they're singling me out. The other commenter did not get banned, and his comment was not erased. They also said it didn't matter what he called me.
---
Now, I had already been previously suspended from that reddit for replying "lol" to a comment being deleted, as I thought it was not offensive. I was suspended for this, and received hundreds of messages of lols from one of the admins. I reported that and nothing happened.
---
Anyway, I can't remember the original comment or find it. But I've already had another comment deleted for making a joke. I never replied or sent them any messages, but that comment was definitely not hurling any insults at another user.

Not gonna lie for a bit I thought it was elevens sister from stranger things
---
What's p3 mean
---
it's not the killer it's the map. Hawkins is terrible for gaining stacks of bloodlust.
---
The quality of this meme is quite low Sir.
---
Personally when i play with 3 swf it doesnt go too bad. Until you get a group who doesnt appreciate the effort you put in and lets you die so they can all escape. There's been quite a few times where I've helped people off of hooks and did about 3 gens worth of repairs, only for nobody to do anything but squat to the exit gate and forget about me after i got NOED'd. Kinda sucks sometimes
---
If you miss there is a cool down. Also it’s very predictable, just go towards barrels or move out of the way.
---
The devs just need to shrink half of the maps in the game. That would be a start for all weak killers.
---
Yaaaaaaas!
---
Running in a straight line isn’t the point. When did “a bit much” turn into “actually op”?
---
Fucking looking behind you isn’t going to do anything in most situations. The only map fucking looking behind you would do anything is the massively open swamp map. Most other maps have narrow paths that will guarantee a hit.
---
It's a crutch it's not toxic.  There's a difference.  Weak players need it to get their kills.  That makes them bad not toxic.
---
Yea 3 DS is a nightmare
---
and killers get to mori you when they down you... right?
---
No, Kate just smashes a guitar over the killers head
---
I posted some tips for another person on pc in this thread as well, but if you can’t see/find it, I copied/pasted it below. 
---
It’s tricky on pc, cuz you have to utilize both the mouse AND keyboard for the proper movement (I say “tricky” cuz I don’t pc game at all, so I assume it’s much harder than on console); when running, you’ll wanna “dance” side to side to begin faking out the killer, then hit W/A/S/D in rapid succession (note: not at the same time), which should send your character spinning LEFT; at that point, you wanna flick your mouse RIGHT, which should put you behind the killer. If you wanna go the other direction, you’ll do it backwards: D/S/A/W (spinning your character RIGHT) and spin your mouse LEFT. Here’s a video that’ll give you a visual explanation on what I mean.
---
Ever since the end game update. Every time rank resets. I always find one or two survs literally just crouching around the outside of the map. Waiting for everyone to either be dead or finish all of the gens.  Sad really. How do they ever expect to get good at the game if they’re not even willing to try the objective.
---
It depends on the ratio of killers to survivors
---
Yeah like a husk gets left behind that lasts for like 2 minutes 👍🏻
---
Looooooool
---
Outplayed by NOED?  Noone in the history of NOED has outplayed anything with it.  That's the whole point of NOED it does it's thing so you don't have to.
---
I already want it buffed no matter how strong it is,  since I'm a killer main the dev's will listen to me.
---
Yeah, she’s called Jane.
---
The cooldown is irrelevant. If you’re not going to say something worthwhile you should just stop replying to my multiple different comments.
---
Majority of killers these days only seem interested in hanging around the hook
---
Just find the fucking totem, And stop crying it's good especially for you gen rushing crybabies to give us killer mains an actual chance at winning the game.
---
Yes, having better internet totally counts as skill, and having money means you know how to build skyscrapers too.
---
Prestige 3
---
No matter what the consensus is among the members of the community, you can play the game however you want as killer or survivor. I don't know of a ton of perks that are strong that people frown upon using: No One Escapes Death, Insidious (camping), and maybe something else...
---
I think certain expectations are placed on the killer because they are the "power" role in the game and can (potentially) control the pace of the match. Not always the case, but I understand the perspective.
---
As well as a buff for all the strong killers though...
---
Thanks
---
As a general rule survivor perks have less of an effect on the game then killer perks. This means that killers are criticised for it more as they have more of an impact. For example no survivor perk has as much of an effect as noed or ruin.
---
Spirits scare me too. And Trappers :(
---
Hehe. I see what you did there. Would be too OP for the killer, or too powerful for the survivor. But that is an interesting idea for some other perk.
---
I took “Momento-Mori” because of its translation (remember about Death).
---
Thank you for your service.
---
Dude posting a video of you crutching out a kill with NOED isn't a post man.  It's just the perk doing what it does.  No effort gimme 1 shots in exchange for allowing survivors to have their way with your gens.
---
That's the problem. It took me way longer than necessary to figure out what you were trying to say. I had to parse every other word, instead of the sentence flowing freely.
---
If you care about sharing your ideas and opinions, then it's important to make sure they're expressed clearly. Learning the basics of grammar, and a quick proofread before posting anything, gets most of the job done.
---
the start of billys chainsaw has good turning the pigs dash can turn anywhere except for backwards and he can be looped like billy you just have be aware of your surroundings and make sure you dont go down long corridors with no big turns
---
I don't think there's a way to make it happen and if there is it isn't easy.
---
Car accident insurance scams are the funniest things on the internet, change my mind.
---
That’s gonna be a no from me dawg
---
Just so you know cool down is a large factor in making a killers ambush strong or weak. If you miss with the Demogorgons lunge you have to wait a good amount of time. Also I’m responding to each of your comments because players like you are the reason why perfectly balanced killer are getting unnecessary nerfs.
---
SWF needs to be taken out of public matches before they do any of this. That's the biggest issue currently.
---
I can’t agree with the billy part, but yea to pig but pigs lunge kinda sucks anyway. You need an add on to break pallets with your power so he actually gets looped worse imo
---
The difference is the killer can down you, hook you and eventually kill you. 
---
The problem is the game is not properly balanced for SWF.  Regardless, The perks you mentioned mostly come at a price, even at tier 3. Exhaustion. A good killer can deal with that no problem. 
---
They aren’t OP (Hawkins Lab) but they aren’t for new killers either.  I’ve been playing daily since the PTB went live and have played against some AMAZING Demogorons and that’s without them running ruin, whispers, and BBQ.
---
I’ve also played against some really bad ones and every time they were complaining in chat that the killer needs a buff. Which is my point, some players just aren’t good at the game and simply like to complain online about it. That goes for both sides.
---
But running in a straight line is how you get hit with the lunge since it can’t turn. Also looking behind you is one of the most important things you need to do when playing survivor so you know where the killer is and what they are doing. So if you simply look behind you and move then you can easily dodge his lunge.
---
We have Jane already.
---
Wait eleven has a sister??
---
He’s not an ambush killer dummy. His lunge isn’t an ambush. Players like me? The players saying he’s fine, but the lunge is really good? Lmao you literally took me saying “bit much” and turned it into “actually op” in your first comment. Get your ass outa here.
---
You think I have four people who would want to play this game with me? It's hard enough bringing one friend and having them not refund this game from how toxic level 20 Smurf killers are.
---
That and you get survivors almost immediately, plus it doesn't take too long to get a killer as a survivor
---
Jane already exists
---
I agree the space mashing is just annoying and stupid. But tbh the main annoyance isn't so much me having to do it, its more my allies failing to do it (on purpose or not). Some people see it as a leave button.
---
This works. Well done.👍
---
Haha. Just look for people that already play the game. I met half my friends on dead by daylight
---
looks really good and creepy! I can’t imagine running into you in a darkened alley, i’d die of a heart attack. 🤣 prank video? lol.
---
Just play killer with BBQ. It's the 'only' way to farm BP's efficiently.
---
Tfw youre keeping an eye on the killer chasing you to time DH but you ram into a wall
---
Again, it doesn’t turn but the HIT BOX TURNS. You’re picking at words and turning it into your own bullshit. We’re done talking.
---
Really great perks. Good job, I think the dash perk has a balance to it as well, Miss it and you get punished. :)
---
Played a game as a rank 13 killer and ended up against a rank 4 survivor with 3k+ hours, he was the only one who escaped. In post game I said something like "oh a red rank, fuckin sick" and the guy proceeded to unironically blame me for ranking up to rank 13 lmao. Told me I probably use scummy tactics. The hypocrisy was lost on him that maybe playing against a newer player as a red rank might be a scummy tactic. Like yea it's my fault that I play the game to win and end up ranking up a bit right? maybe BHVR shouldnt be matching people with 20 hours against people with 3000 when theres a 10 rank difference.
---
GET THE F*CK OUT OF MY SWAMP!!
---
Yeah that sucks man, some killers just suck at finding people and camp because they get frustrated and don't know how to find people. If they're camping you because you outplayed them a lot it isn't fair but at least they aren't attacking your team mates? Also if your team isn't even trying to save you that really sucks too :(
---
Well it shouldn't trump adrenaline because adrenaline goes through exhaustion. And it's the way it is for a reason. Also that perk needs a counter and adrenaline is perfect for it. But otherwise, you did an okay job
---
Whoever thinks that can go OINK themselves!!
---
Peanits also said they those 'nerfs' were intended to be on the ptb with his second set of changes but they didnt get time.
---
You have been invited to chat with toxic_nea531
---
Lol someone’s a survivor main😂 what if all four survivors ran that perk ? They would pop all 5 gens before the killer could scratch his balls
---
I think it is 4%, but I feel like you have no grasp of the it, basically you will get of 4 times every 100 games.
---
well you have to time when the hillbilly is about to saw, 360s counter billys curving but i think the demogorgen has about the same hitboxes as the demogorgen.
---
Only the obsession receives the bonuses. I am the killer main, actually.
---
I have a few friends that I have met on dbd, but none of them are interested in kyf bc bloodpoints for the normal base game unfortunately. Personally I believe a rotating game mode of one other mode would be healthy, every month it could change and give new options. At some point some people would burn out and go back to the normal game but rotations would keep it both interesting, and healthy for the base game by leaving it in for such a time that both modes get played, if at least somewhat evenly I hope.
---
Thanks, dude and yeah that probably makes sense, I didn't really consider it that way. What did you think about the ability and the other perks?
---
Yea but is Billy’s chainsaw run really good in loops? I feel using it on a loop that isn’t a narrow path really hurts him more than helps. The turning just isn’t very good without add ons
---
So a perk that’s worthless if someone else runs it not knowing someone else is running it ?
---
You stopped for a split sec u probably could of made it off
---
BBQ, Ruin, NOED, Iri heads, and belt, with zero kills??? Wow they’re bad lol
---
The issue is that they already barely have enough people for the updates they do now. Adding custom game modes would disrupt balance, cause more bugs, and slow down the progress of updates
---
Demodevito is hotter
---
Shit I’ll burn my self to the inferno if it were that hot
---
4/10. I would run sloppy (to make survivors waste more time), murmur (a cheaper alternative to bbq), tremors (a cheaper alternative to ruin) &amp; deerstalker (cause you can sometimes lose people on the ground), it's a decent starter build.
---
yeah I saw it in the OP but didn't reply because I'd look like a weirdo.
---
Well you were the one comparing his lunge to the pigs ambush. Also yes players like you because the devs did a very good job on the range and cool down and he’s already a Bish tier killer so there is no need to nerf him since the lunge is easily countered, you just need to learn how to counter it.
---
Well yes I agree *sips tea* but sometimes a low quality meme can be a great way to show AGITATION hahahha oh I’m sorry chap but still you have to make jokes about perk names sometimes hahhahahahahah *cough* *cough*
---
If he was like that the hitboxes/lag might make sense
---
&gt;SWF needs to be taken out of public matches before they do any of this. That's the biggest issue currently.
---
Do this and the game probably dies the next day.
---
Did u not hear me spamming

No problem! My friends had it happen to her multiple times on PS4 when I’ve been playing with her it’s definitely a bug and not a hack.
---
You stole this from the nba 2k subreddit
---
Nah Mr. Slave would be the killer and Paris Hilton would be the survivor
---
That's great! Lmao!
---
You should be happy because ghostface is trash. Once you reach red ranks all you'll see is little timmies playing Spirit thinking they are good because they got ears.
---
I live on the east coast and I always have to wait probably triple the time I wait for a lobby when I'm playing survivor.
---
It is worth it do it pls
---
This is the crux of it, you need to get better at loop and you'll generally increase your chances of  survival.
---
If you're too pesky to catch killers will break to find a weaker target/out of position survior
---
This is my favourite of your stuff. Great job!
---
HA HA HA~!
---
Agreed, if it works for you then go ahead and use it! Thats the benefit of having so many perks, you can have so many playstyles! Great talking with you
---
It sounds like you're talking about NOED.  You're new run it if you want it was designed for you guys just know it won't teach you a thing about the game and particularly it will teach nasty game losing habits that are difficult to break.
---
Honestly at this point it's too boring to play against just him. Variety is the spice of death, and all that. I'd love to see a good spirit on Xbox, I've only ever seen one and she couldn't find anyone.
---
It's Tunnelling to ignore other Surviviors just to go after one in particular
---
I use dash attack addons more and use the traps as more pressure
---
Then idk, I can't add much to this argument. Rewards are required or no one will participate. Maybe game mode specific cosmetic rewards that can be used in the base game?
---
You too man! have a great day!
---
I’d swap bond for Self Care or head on. They’re some of the few ways to earn survival points aside from escaping and wiggling out of the killers grasp.
---
Yeah I was just wondering if there were some lesser known ways that were only slightly less efficient.
---
Would like to see more variety than pallets and windows.
---
I don't think she is low tier, she isn't the strongest but she has potential
---
Possibly, but once again that requires more work. The whole point was to stop the devs from having to put in a whole bunch of effort for the custom game modes.
---
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN IN ME SWAMP!
---
Amen. Especially when you see a couple flashlights,
---
Sorry for the not-so-great quality. Had to convert it to a MP4 format since reddit doesn't allow AVI files to be uploaded and the quality took a hit.
---
I use perks like spine chill or premonition to avoid detection by the killer and pair it with urban evasion. Iron will is also good to help you get away once you're injured but you can always look up youtube videos to help you loop the killer better or to even get away from the killer by mind gaming. An exhaustion perk is also a second chance in a chase so stuff like balanced landing, deadhard, sprint burst will help you get a head start or prolong the chase for as long as possible
---
That much hair under a pig head? Must be real tight.
---
afaik, he has a Chain wrapped skin
---
 *Platform:* PS4
---
* *Type of Bug:* Ingame? (item loss)
---
* *Description:* I brought in a a purple key with addons, didn't drop it and the killer didn't have Franklin's Demise. I escaped with it through an exit gate but somehow lost it.
---

---
I think that is contraproducent...if with Ruin people stop doing gens to look for it, with CI they will be even more focused on finding Ruin
---
Looping isn't remotely toxic it's gameplay.  Flash lighting do you mean they blinded you at pallets OR they clicked it endlessly at you to spam the noise?  The first isn't toxic it's gameplay but the second scenario is toxic.  Teabagging is toxic.  Based on that alone you have justification to camp if they bm you and show disrespect.  But I think it's important to be able to tell the difference about the other stuff mentioned.
---
god i hope they don't ever do this
---
Its mainstream to hate on mainstream streamers. They do the same to true and hexy.
---
Bruh and donkey can walk on his hind legs with lord Farquad on his shoulders
---
I'm a fan also, it may be his "toxicity" or better know as "every time I try to be a gen jock I end up getting chased the whole game". People may see him trying to survive as toxic because he uses and abuses everything he can? Honestly tho idk, just a guess
---
I am positively suprised that you do see the error in your ways and therefore \****sips tea\****  
---
I'll grant thee one upvote.
---
Ah yes is forgot
---
Goddammit BHVR, stop leaking all these great dlcs!!!
---
it’s all the killers he’s been toxic too banding together to strike back
---
Don't get mad at the killer for doing the objective silly, btw the objective is you : D
---
Thank you!
---
Wraith is a long, skinny boi
---
How about something less complicated like "Your hex totems appears as Dull totems instead".
---
Doesn't really fix any issues but its hilarious lol
---
As a console killer main who enjoys spirit and shamelessly uses prayer beads I see no problem. :)
---
 BBQ + Distressing + Hex: Ruin + Beast Of Prey for best killer perk setup for farming BPs. I don't use beast of prey but some people seem to like it. *shrugs*
---
Wow, I don’t think people hated him. His videos are entertaining to watch and he’s really good at doing 360’s and looping killers. 
---
He’s also got plenty of videos playing against lower rank killers and doing the same. They hate him because he’s good at the game and can destroy at Will apparently.
---
If you're having fun and getting kills, you're playing killer properly. Just try not to facecamp or tunnel. Facecamping is when you stay right next to the survivor that you've hooked. Tunneling is going after one person specifically until they die. Both of these strategies keep you at low ranks, and with less bloodpoints.
---
Very good. Combined with windstorm and spirit fury it can be deadly
---
it's been a common thing for awhile, the wiggle bar can show as done but it's at about 99% and when they start the hook animation that's it, lights out cowboy
---
Or they will find your ruin in first 10 sec like in 50% of the matches and then you have no map presence at all.
---
You also get that one group of friends who just dick around with diversion and head on
---
Where are you getting this from? Whenever he’s brought up here I see maybe one or two negative comments about him that are usually downvoted or not upvoted very much. 
---
I like him. He’s one of the only DbD streamers I know of who doesn’t trash talk killers (other than himself lol) just for losing and can admit when him getting downed/killed is his own fault.
---
I said I’m on console, playing with lag and bad frame rate and I do fine, maybe read next time? 
---
So yeah, I think you might just need to get better at hitting them. It’s not that hard.
---
Thank you so much! It was the hardest one ahah
---
Thank you son ❤️
---
aww, but accurate
---
Are we just gonna ignore “mcspaghetti”?
---
Franklin's demise is a godsend, they never see it coming.
---
Thank you for entertainment here's upvote for your post and comment and like for your video.
---
I've been using it on plague a few weeks ago and the screams are bubbles like doctor's shock attack
---
okay I snorted out my drink a bit
---
We dont have a date for it
---
I’m back and forth sometimes on Bond because of this. It gives you plenty of information - where to go for heals, gens to help with, who’s getting chased by the killer. But it also shows you when a teammate is hiding behind a skinny tree doing a whole lot of nothing.
---
What’s franklins demise, and who has it
---
There are a ton of you tube videos that can help you choose. Perks are player specific ... meaning they are designed to enhance your play style. What works for me, won’t work for you. 
---
Especially if you are new. Learn to play first and then start considering where your weaknesses are.

---
What do you game on? Which survivors do you have already or does it not matter?
---
Meg lookin like Tarzan
---
I've achieved some success with a pallet shredder build: Ruin, Bamboozle, SBTFL, Brutal Strength. Try playing in no more than half of the map, this means forcing pallets of that area down quick, defending gens in that area, hooking in thay area... 
---
There's no way you can stop a rush with this Killer, so make them come to you by playing defensively.
---
Yes you can just face the opposite direction duh
---
If you're in low ranks and is not comfortable with the game yet, I would say Self Care, Sprint Burst, Bond, Urban Evasion,Spine Chill
---
But if you know how to play the game go with the 4 Meta Perks of the Apocalypse:Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike
---
Other Perks that are good can be We'll make it,Balanced Landing,Iron Will,Lithe, Unbreakable
---
Because there are plenty of times when it’s ok to run. Like when the killer is nowhere near you.
---
Come on bois her archetype is based off of opera I’m talking someone freaky like. Someone so dang crazy they will orgasm on death hook
---
Dude, not touching your keyboard takes skill ok
---
Ight ima head out.
---
Nobody can be hotter then him
---
Are you calling the internet a liar?
---
I’d level up Claudette for Self Care, David/Meg for WGLF or Sprint Burst and Adrenaline whichever you prefer first but honestly the grind is so bad that I’d take David king and then I’d go for Meg or Bill. If you want more survivability and only to hook when it’s safe go for Meg if you want to be more helpful for your team and more safely earn stacks without damaging your team go for Bill. Nea has great stealth with Urban Evasion if that’s more of your tea. 
---
Honestly those are just what most people would suggest but I’d go for what would be best for you, are you a solo player? Then it might be best to aim for perks to keep yourself alive first like sprint burst and adrenaline. Are you playing with friends? Then I’d grab perks to help them alleviate the difficulty of playing while helping teach a new player the ropes like Borrowed time.
---
I just did the same thing. First one scared me and made me miss mine I'm assuming same for the third
---
Survivors: It’s free bloodpoints. 
---
Killers: It’s time of being spent on gens.
---
Just the skill check alone gets locked to a 30 tick rate? That's actually pretty silly. But even then it sometimes feels so much lower. I never understood it.
---
I play killer but i dont do survivor much.
---
I'm afraid not,the only thing you can do is to prestige your characters
---
I own every dlc and pc
---
Ghostface players on Xbox are mostly bad at playing him. At least above lvl 10. I’m 5 now and haven’t see one since. 
---
Another great killer that most can’t play and just camp with.

The average problem for killer players, lobbies take forever to find sometimes. One day it can be in seconds, the next a lobby won't be found for 10-30 minutes
---
With Donkey as surviver. Perk, doesn't shut up, drawing the killer closer...lol

I did this last night. I managed to unhook a teammate getting facecamped during endgame. I pointed to the open gate and got behind them to take a potential hit for them. We get to the open gate with the killer breathing down my neck and... They run into a bear trap. 😟
---
My survivor rank is currently 19, so most of the killers I see are pretty bad. I'm a rank 7 killer though, so I'm not the best either. I mostly play huntress, pig, and hag. I just want to see more variety in my opponents at lower levels
---
I think they meant 3 survivors had dstrike
---
This is factually incorrect. He stated that a certain element of the changes; specifically being drawn out by stuns, was a change that they intended to do but didn't. They also disingenuously said it was a bug fix, which is incorrect when it's an intended change you essentially "forgot" to include. Peanits did not off-hand state that those were intended changes, the official hotfix notes stated that of those specific changes (they didn't apply that broad, sweeping statement to the whole patchnotes). I followed this closely, believe me.
---
Yeah ok.

She is being held back by all the nerfs and bad add ons

---
Now how long did That take you
---
yeah no, the portals already drop like flies
---
To really drive the point home, this person would rather shove the hook up a place where the sun don’t shine rather than through their scapula lmfao I’m done sorry
---
Thanks for the video my dude! Not gonna lie, I learned quite a lot and didn’t realize I was usually letting loopers get maximum value from the way I was chasing. Although like you said, some maps you just can’t do much (Gas Haven, Swamp, School), but I think these tips will help me to have an easier time in the future. Appreciate it again!
---
Wait really? Shouldn’t it tell me
---
Who's hotter, demodevito or doctor?
---
It's annoying and you can't properly use the PTB the way it was intended because people keep just camping hooks, ruin, or a gen cluster before a single gen has been touched.
---
I'm hoping and praying for a buff
---
I still play Legion and manage to do well but it's way harder to acomplish than with other killers
---
As a matter of fact I'm not, but that is not the point. I'm a potato as a survivor and I can't loop, but I hit 8 out of 10 greats. It's just practice. Better getting good at it than bitchin about a perk that is totally fine.
---
Bruh i have the same photo on my phone bruh
---
Hey man, if you're rank 10 and you recognize this guy is garbage, you're probably better than you think.
---
Have the same pic on my phone
---
I stopped removing comments on my profile and just added "I like salty dead by daylight posts" in my bio. But now nobody writes them, I need to stop letting survivors escape so I can build up my wall of salt.
---
Bruh bruh bruh bruh I think I did a pretty good job so far
---
I dont understand the reasoning behind that comparision
---
Nice try, this is obviously an in game screen shot!
---
Dead Hard, Decisive Strike, Spine Chill, Unbreakable
---
Don’t cleanse, Sprint burst away from that girl while she starting to puke, loop around a small but circular place like a t wall or a thick ass tree so when she pukes you can run her back and forth so she stays on that side and can’t hit you with her puke as much, waste her time as much as possible because she likely won’t swing until you’re max sick but don’t get too close either or she will bitch slap you. 
---
Cleanse only if you’re desperately in need to, I mean death hook, I mean needing it to escape the match need it not “Oh no I’m slightly ill I think imma cleanse right now” even if you’re broken it’s fine to do gens and just stay broken until she finds you. It’s more cost effective on your part and it saves your team and you from turning an M1 killer into a power house.
---
Yup. People have been complaining about this since the games inception. It can't possibly be harder then making dedicated servers but here we are lol. Behavior fix the damn skill check already.
---
Yeah it's his icon
---
You're a son of a bitch, your father was a lemming, and your mother is a wheel of cheese.
---
Don't get puked on, don't cleanse, and don't get downed when you do get sick. Complete generators in between all of this and be a good teammate then you can open the exit doors and hopefully leave at the end if you aren't dead.
---
-d. You will have my beard.
---
*Pwong*
---
Oh shit i forgat he got a skin too lol
---
Yeah. Toxic Squadettes still use active camouflage and camping killers still camping nonstop, even with Demogorgon.
---
* This is cherry picking but Freddy/hag/huntress belongs in your mid high tier with the demo. Billy is significantly stronger than them but they're way better than GF. Your order isn't really wrong tho.
---
This is a surprisingly good list
---
I never cleanse only sometimes at endgame
---
Im getting that idea from noob3 himself, other streamers and some posts on this sub
---
That's exactly what I mean, could have just been the set banner. I think this is his best skin since the black metal one. The other ones butcher his beautiful beard.
---
I liked using Babysitter with Distortion. Always knew which direction to run when the killer was coming straight back to the hook or knew the general area a killer was patrolling.
---
I like that belt buckle
---
I liked him, but after the way he treated his cat I unsubbed.
---
I would like it more if it were on the ground ;) 
---
(I'll see myself out now.)
---
And the punchline here is?
---
I did that for a year. I loved playing killer and mained Myers, Freddy and the Spirit and took it to rank 1. 
---
But nothing can prepare you against a bad player except patience. There are signs to look out for. If you’re popping gens and the killer is bad at looping ... cleanse tokens as they are running NOED ... things like that. 
---
And when they are camping ... do gens. 
---
It takes far more skill to be a good survivor then it does to be a good killer. The odds are always favoring the killer.
---
Had this happen on my first hook, with pre-ptb dying light, as the obsession, when the killer had a "kill the obsession" mori. Needless to say, everyone died because of that guy.
---
Insult to injury to death. Screw that Dwight and Feng.
---
Because killer mains sympathize with the killers that Noob3 loops around all game because they know it could’ve been them. So they hate him, don’t know why he’s never actually toxic, just better than the killers he loops
---
&gt; LF's issue is that he has no map molbity,
---
Not every character needs map mobility. If every character is given a teleport or a dash, it's going to make for a very boring game.
---
&gt; no stall
---
He actually does have add-ons that decrease the speed in which survivors do gens. All they need to do is make it last longer after being hit via Chainsaw.
---
&gt; no map pressure,
---
Again, not every character should have to be able to dash across the map as much as they want.
---
&gt; and not the best chase poteintal either.
---
That's why he should have a tiny Terror Radius, so that you can down people before they realize he's next to you.
---
DBD on a flip phone
---
Had a game where it was clear that 3 Survivors were on a team. The rando was a Dwight. I noticed early on that he dropped pallets way too early and liked to tbag to get my attention, so I gave him my attention. The game ended with just that Dwight escaping and the 3 other Survivors all dying on hooks because Dwighty there used up all the pallets so when I found the other Survivors they would barely have any places to run to. Dwight did usual toxic stuff on exit gates and on post-game chat, I guess that he didn't noticed that even though he escaped he ended up dooming all the other Survivors.
---
Isn't hexy the same one that said demogorgon is c tier and billy is BETTER than nurse? Lmao
---
...lol what name calling? Lol. Andbwhat does grammar have to do with my opinion n also im a 3 killer so obviously i play killer. Smoke a blunt dude
---
Yep
---
Which was stolen from r/shittyrainbow6
---
And battle pass?
---
I mean... he IS easier to play. But i really doubt he said top tier nurses are better than top tier billys. If he said that i totally disagree with him.
---
This.
---
As time passes, the killer gains perks and addons at random till they have all perks, and their addons accumulate. Survivors get built in Deliverance.
---
&gt; Any other campers in this sub?
---
Noed is so scummy it is worth the time
---
I didn't actually realize people had a problem with Moris until reading the comments on this discussion. I love them, personally. It's usually fairly easy to tell if a killer has one (pay attention to offerings, if DH procs, rancor) and adjust your game play accordingly but I never get mad if I get mori'd. Hell, I usually think it's hilarious.
---
“please do not try to start a argument with me or anyone else in the comments if it’s not needed” kinda sounds like argument starter so I’m just putting that there
---
Can I borrow 50 blood points ... it’d not like you don’t have it 🤣
---
True though.
---
First I would like to introduce you to . and , please use them.  Secondly, instead of coming on the interwebs and complaining about something being imbalanced when you lose against it let's hear what you would do. It's big brain time rip-Jergen. What would you do to balance NOED?

For future reference, pathing behind that car is usually a bad call, I usually still catch people at the next window
---
It’s not I just thought it was funny for one, and for 2 there is a least a post a day about NOED. it gets really old after awhile.
---
I know that feeling
---
Not to mention that 4 people injured is more often than not a lot more valuable than 1 on hook.
---
Or maybe, there was no point in not using the same model as they were rushed to geg that dlc out.
---
Hmm. Either that's a bug, or all detection perks just got absolutely dumpstered. Detection perks aren't even meta, so I highly doubt spine chill is the reason wraith and pig aren't top tier killers.

Xbox is super toxic and salty when I comes to this game. If u win ur s tunneler/camper that is trash and if U lose ur a GG2EZ baby killer

Haha yeah I got to actually spend some now so I can keep playing.

Well I have never browsed throw this subreddit I just post and know one needs to use punctuation on Reddit
---
Wow it's almost like quentin and freddy have the same height. Let's waste time making a new model.

Oh no, you wanna know something funny, this has been a known thing for a while now, no one has even cared as guess what, it doesnt matter.
---
If you dont like the devs then dont play their game giving them money.
---
*sips tea even louder*

“please do not try to start a argument with me or anyone else in the comments if it’s not needed” and this is not needed also why so toxic all of a sudden

I’d say clown is low tier

Eh No

I’ll pay for whatever I want and I will complain about whatever I want LOL

Everyone should use some form of punctuation, this post was a little rough to read. I do understand the frustration of NOED though. I just do bones even when ruin isn’t active. You never know.

Because what is the purpose of your post? It's meaningless and we are all dumber trying to read it.
---
What a shit post lol “anyone else pick Billy because they’re bad and have to camp?”
---
I’m a Billy main. He’s not hard at all to versus SwFs, you shouldn’t be having a hard time, I say this as a red rank killer. If they play 2+ toolboxes or medkits, you play Begrimed Chains (decreases repair and healing speed for survs hit by chainsaw) and Tuning Guide for insta saw. The thing about SwFs is they’re way too altruistic. 
---
And if it’s endgame collapse and they’re trying to get someone off the hook, it won’t happen unless you’re bad. Just stand still and wait for them to start unhooking, start your insta saw and down the unhooker making them trade. Just blaming SwFs and their perks doesn’t justify a loss unless you’re playing someone like Trapper. Billy is a different case
---
More brain dead comments, i love em. Keep em coming
---
*All Star starts playing*
---
They are not even good killers, these perks made them even worse.
---
I don't think people hate him per say. It's a strong word to describe someone you don't really enjoy watching. I personally have no problem with him now, but for reasons you mentioned, I used to believe he wasn't that good for the community. I sometimes watch his videos, but it's quickly getting repetitive and it's usually the same memes which is a shame considering he's a good video editor.
---
I’m not a strong killer at all (I barely get kills or hooks even lol) and survivors are the worst. I get messages afterwards about how bad I am and should give up etc. I turn off post game chat for this reason.
---
I main survivor now and am always nice to try to counter the toxicity of the survivors I’ve been with.

Also, due to the ranking system being based off time rather than skill you can have anyone from little timmy to a literal esports player in rank 1.

No, it's something else. I'll think of it eventually.
---
*spirit: you better have iron will
---
Did one guy kill himself on hook? Fuck this Nurse, I always play gentler if someone DCs (and they’re not a SwF). Sometimes forcing struggle hook on someone is necessary but facecamping is so lame
---
Wtf is that killer?
---
Their build: p3 Claudette with urban evasion, sprint burst, iron will, and spine chill.
---
*cries in old Freddy*
---
Too easy to loop her.  Sniper huntress' are a different story like zubair, but how often do you run into huntress that are cross mapping?
---
That may be true, but all this is doing is adding one problem to try and fix another. This doesn't fix the problem of stealth killers being weak, because they were weak regardless of detection perks. It also makes the entire class of detection perks unusable. It creates a new problem without fixing the old one.
---
Considering the username of who posted that, you should have gone 
---
&gt; flOof
---
 why would I write a hole post about something I lost to in a match just a match then write about it I’m not toxic like your being write know I only wrote this post because it to easy to win as killer with it and just a game of luck as survivor
---
I want to make it clear I'm not arguing for or against it, I'm simply surprised since this doesn't seem to be the case with the rest of the smaller killers i.e Ghostface or Pig.
---
Ok. I will change it. Thanks for the feedback
---
I’m good i’ll wait for the next troll to comment under my post DD
---
Also stop being a cunt and if you do work on your anger issues with a therapist
---
Cleansing loses games. If it’s your teammates cleasing then your best bet is playing immersed and do gens staying away from the killer. Eventually your teammates will kill themselves by cleansing and making Plague a god, so you look for hatch
---
Freddy main here: yes, they stack. Use them with Thanatophobia for maximum effect.
---
He didn't get it off though?
---
Eh I feel he's effective enough in chases to deserve mid tier
---
Do you breathe out of your mouth, boy?
---
I recommend paying attention to the circle around your character unless you know they can instantdown at full health let a plague hit you shortly before you would break that way you get a speed boost they would potentially lose bloodlust and you would end up going broken shortly after anyway.
---
Survivors are stronger than killer they need good perks or else they will lose, I've played In games when all gen are done in 5 minutes with the killers ruin still up, ruin is perfectly fine where it is, killers are allowed to have strong perks.
---
I’d give you gold if I could
---
I believe fixated is faster as urban evasion is only a little bit faster then walking
---
&gt;except they crouch walk without urban evasion.
---
Fuckin Feng and Claudette
---
 Omg I hate that! At least stay with me and battling this out together you twit
---
ITS LIKE A BUURNING SUNRISE
---
Should've replaced "Out" with "On"
---
Did you assume my gender and also work on your anger issues with a therapist
---
“i am not open to criticism because my opinion is always right”
---
Seriously. Unless they're running 4x BNPs and some wacky Prove Thyself build based around generators, they're not genrushing. They're just playing the game and you're not pressuring the map enough. This is also coming from a player who plays way more Killer than Survivor unless I have my squad ready.
---
However, I can't blame newer players for thinking genrushing is a thing; if you fail to get any early game pressure 3 gens will pop before you know it. There's a reason Ruin is so popular.

Ghostface cracks me up. When I'm working on a gen and I see him fucking lean around the corner I think it's the funniest thing ever. It's just such a quick motion with a goofy mask.

Okay, I was hoping you were trolling. I knew you couldn't be this dumb.
---
Honestly I got to play the ptb on my friend's computer since I only have console, and my friend you're gonna love it
---
You just said you don’t like it and then proceeded list out an awesome reason to REALLY like it??
---
UE just makes your crouch speed as fast as your normal walk speed, fixated makes you walk 20℅ faster so yeah
---
That could work, it's pretty strong, esp with heal meta and everyone having self care. But it's not something I'm totally against, and I'm a killer main, so my opinion is basically what would be playing against your design.
---
Well, that sound obnoxious. Not sure how the interaction works. Oblivious prevents the survivor from hearing the terror radius, but they are still within it. The way borrowed time is worded it shouldn't affect the perk, but I wouldn't bet on it.
---
But still dude see a therapist

Hahaha that’s one way to look at it.

---
It's the same base body model with a different head &amp; props right? Meaning the head geometry isn't just Quentin's with the freddy head pasted on? From a production perspective it makes sense and is ultimately quicker to reuse the body if he's going to be the same height and focus on the props and skin to get the content out quicker.

OP got down voted by the usual suspects. Don't be discouraged. This sub is a hive of Survivor Mains who will shout down anyone that goes against their opinions. If you choose to stay just be aware that any kind of post complaining about survivors, suggesting nerfs to top tier survivor perks, fixing cancer maps, and etc will just get down voted and cocksuckers will appear and tell you to be quiet and use autistic meme shit to disparage (I.E. "Another sweaty try hard camper here!"). 
---
Do chainsaw killers get bullied less? Yes and no. It depends on the survivors. I've had matched at red ranks where dudes will still try to body block as I'm using Billy. They will still use their Instant Heal especially to save their butt-buddy that you just downed. 
---
Billy is better than Leatherface in every possible way except face camping. If gates are open and you got that one guy and want him to die then that guy is going to die. The only possible way that guy is escaping is if he Kobe's and has DS and a hatch/gate is close enough for them to crawl to it. Or possibly he Kobe's and Adrenaline kicks in and he's close enough to a hatch/gate. The only other possible way they will escape is if you have a very dedicated group of (autistic) survivors willing to hook rush. But even then, you'll get at least one more down and just hook the next guy (just be aware of DS). Then when you face camp the one guy to secure a kill well after they should have left they'll just rage at you in the post-game chat, rage invite you and all that. You can disable the chat by hitting the arrow next to it and it stays off the next time you launch the game.
---
It already did that.

---
Their heads are definitely different, I should've made that clear in the title. And you're right, it does make sense, although he's the only survivor sharing a body model with a killer.

Then, one week seems fair enough.
---
Bond can be painful to run sometimes. The other day I was in a Freddy match with 1 gen left and 3 of us alive - a perfectly winnable scenario, could get at least two of us out. The Freddy wasn't very experienced which meant even my deeply mediocre looping skills could run him around for a really long time, legitimately several minutes. Imagine my dismay as I run him around the Wretched Shop while seeing my other two teammates urban evade around rocks and trees nearby instead of working on any gen whatsoever!
---
Now that ugly ass face makes sense
---
If someone dies on top of where hatch would spawn, it does that. Hatch is invisible and can't be interacted with, but you can still hear it.

The fact that survivors can just leave the game with the helmet on completely destroys the saw franchise's purpose in DBD. We, The Oinkers of the DBD community, demand a rework along the lines of Freddy, such as a syringe pit to throw survivors in or we will be forced to contact daddy jigsaw with our grievances. And daddy Jigsaw does not like problems.
---
It's strange cuz when I actually do crave them and decide to eat one I immediately regret it. I'm like.... Why did I just do that to myself? 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
What bait
---
Then why are you complaining if you use it
---
Nah save the best for last nurse is like the self care no mither build for killers lol
---
Stop caring about killing, worry about having fun, take a break for the day if you're getting frustrated
---
But what the fuck did I do,I'm never toxic,except telling killers nice camping if they camped the hook
---
Lerys, the game, and hawkins map would like a word regarding this idea.
---
So how would you propose testing Killer add-ons?
---
How tf did you get an award for that? Goddamnit.
---
Because it’s to easy to win as killer and a game of luck when your survivor so it’s not balanced and that’s why I made this post
---
Now this Is epic
---
I really want to play with the nancys
---
List is shit, Clown is not useless :P Tiers aside he still remains my go-to/favorite
---
/u/peanits
---
Honestly he just needs a rework like freddy, i dont ask the devs to rush it but a rework for the legion would be welcome since he is not really enjoyable to play against and not strong to play as
---
Usually the one time you decide to play survivor ;P
---
Spine chill
---
This is a good solution right here. Not like bloodpoints in the PTB have any impact in the main game.
---
I told the Legion it was a glitch and they were such good sports
---
I use premonition. Let's me know I'm looking in his direction and that I need to peace out.
---
Yeah that’s how I am the most I saved before this was like 200k. I just like to buy things right away.
---
Looks like the hat removing animation started to play and he died.
---
Just pay attention he’s not super hard to spot sometimes because of his white face and spine chill helps
---
He's a killer. That's literally what we do is kill. It's not fun being tbagged and pointed when the whole point of being a killer is to be a scary killer.
---
I took 4 days. And then i came back. Chosen Ghostface, and survivors t-baged and jerked around whole game. Knew mal, red syringes, sprint bursts ... Hard try players. I remmebered how little chance i had and i gave up. I snapped so fast and easily. This game at least as a killer. Until some changes are made, i cant play killers only for quest and then afking. 
---
Because when survivors mock you and run around you in circles it gets on your nerves. You just want to have fun. But they mock you for being weak and i am only human, i dislike this kind of treatment. Its not fun at all.
---
That quick trap on jake was good.
---
Jane*
---
do you think i didnt try that?
---
Or give them "Wake up" animation like in Deceit. Makes more sense lore wise
---
That's what I'm saying. He didn't officially get it off.  The key for the trap is to remove it, not stop the trap from working. He didn't get it off=death.
---
And that’s a theory
---
Chest rushing...
---
Well the whole point of NOED is to force survivors to escape when the generators are completed, and be cautious and careful in their efforts to do so. At least to me, NOED prevents survivors staying at the exit gates and opening them even when the Killer is barreling down on you, since you could most likely be downed before you can get the exit gates open. Also NOED helps prevent the kind of survivors that will tea-bag you at the exit gates or try to escape through the hatch simply to piss you off from being as successful in doing so a majority of the time. With the proper jukes or perks, you can likely find ways to make NOED less scary to fight against, or maybe just escape when the opportunity presents itself.
---
Yeah so basically if you buy them with auric cells it can still happen, only buying chapters makes it so you don't get them
---
You are not complaining about spirit fury. I refuse to believe it
---
*GROOVY INTENSIFIES*
---
&gt;laughs in swf
---
M&amp;A works great on Huntress... it decreases her terror radius to 12 meters, which can significantly throw people used to running when she's at 20 meters, since her humming is normally from 45 to 20. Better odds of close quarters throws.
---
Well survivor's objective is completing gens, meanwhile killer's objective is well, kill everyone. So complaining about gen rushing is just as stupid as complaining about tunneling or camping then.
---
No, even worse *whispers* having fun
---
Nope sound was off
---
Of course I was trying to figure figure out all the lore this game has to offer for the past decade and couldn't get all the pieces to aline but this little tidbit connects all the dots
---
Yes! I want to be feared. Like in Evolve monster on Lever 3. It was SCARRY and you know you lose hard if you dont play well ...
---
... Here? What we are? Just trained animals in big arena to entertain four random assholes. 
---
Sorry for being rude. Thats how i feel when they start to T-Bag and point at me.
---
Dont downvote! spread awareness! So by the time Stranger Things Chapter comes out it can be fixed
---
You just have to learn to let it roll off, don't get mad just because they t-bag, when you get mad, you make mistakes. When you make mistakes, you get punished harshly. I know in some cases you can't apply enough pressure unless playing spirit or nurse, but that's not all the time
---
Yeah, he wasn't even mad either lol. Had the purple setting tool.
---
Can someone explain what's wrong with this?
---
Sarcastic posts like yours are the reason why the community is cancer. People like the OP specifically. I know I won't get through to this guy because this guy lives in his own reality. It's as simple as that. He'll make this shitpost and high-five fellow survivor autists that think nothing is wrong and everything is fine.
---
It doesn't matter that killers need to use Ruin or at least one other gen slow down perk like Corrupt Intervention or Pop Goes the Weasel. Or be forced to use Nurse exclusively. It doesn't matter to this guy. 
---
This cancerous and hypocritical human being has the balls to suggest "Oh, you should go outside and get a life. Get a college degree haha." When we all know that this POS is the kind who would wait at the gate, tea-bag, all the bullshit, and wait until EGC is over or the killer chases them out. Then he'll go online and cry when a killer gets him with NOED or he loses to a Nurse or gets face camped when gates are open. 
---
People like this little POS are the reason why the community is cancer and why the balance remains bad. Survivor Mains try looking in a mirror for once.
---
That's weird, because I couldn't even tell you how many times I've accidentally revealed him by moving my camera in his direction.
---
You probably tbag and typed some toxic as shit.
---
Just gotta learn to let it not bother you, some people enjoy ruining other's fun. Don't let them, accept you've lost and move on
---
As i said its super hard. And there is little to no map pressure when playing someone else.
---
I dont type on console...and i dont at-bat because that's a waste of time
---
Dude that'd be sick i love Austin Power
---
You can farm points super easy on legion if you want to play killer. He gets tons of free hits which stack towards multiple categories. If you want to play survivor Prove Thyself is pretty solid as a perk and for bloodpoints. For survivors WGLF is king for bloodpoints because it's evaluated post-game like BBQ, but it doesn't help you in during game at all.
---
Lol  well there u go, I’m spamming in he background lol and no stopping
---
He will never reach the truth
---
I think it's a legacy Leatherface. Which I don't believe exists. Didn't he come out after the deadline for getting legacy skins.
---
Gettin good at nurse is a skill that all dbd players should learn, good on you to start earlier.
---
Thank you for doing this, there is so much cringe on this sub when people go super hard.
---
Shitpost/meme tag please
---
I think this guy actually has autism and I mean that in the literal sense
---
Your mom is right.
---
Yeah fuck the hatch
---
I don't need a team i can play solo
---
-me moments before getting in a game and beeing left for dead
---
A true hooker has hooks. Many hooks.
---
***Sips tea insanely loud***
---
Look at Plunderer’s Instinct’s quote
---
***crouchgang***
---
This is pretty accurate imo
---
*sips tea at jet engine level loud*
---
I’m on Xbox so there isn’t a post game chat. I play surv and killer so I can confirm that practically everything people get upset about is BS, except face camping. People shouldn’t be as upset if they get tunneled or facecamped because they take up the killers time and if your team is genrushing then you just bought your team 3 gens.
---
Can we like ban these posts? It’s so tiring seeing the everyday “toxic SwFs bullying me with insta heals, flashlight, teabagging, every other mechanic in the game 😢” and when you offer advice they always deflect it
---
Legitimate question here, sorry if it comes of as cocky...
---
How did you get to rank 11 without ever getting a full sweep? I get them somewhat regularly down at rank 17...and I'm not even really very good. I use lvl 1 Pig with one perk and I always forget to use my head traps XD
---
Again, not trying to question your skill, just curious. Wraith is definitely a more difficult killer than Pig, and I assume it gets harder to sweep the higher your rank is...maybe I'm just getting lucky at low ranks :P
---
Also, his best add-ons are the ones that affect action speed but you have to use Thana with those add-ons. 
---
Ignore the Dream Pallets. They're crap.
---
Other good add-ons to use in conjunction would be:
---
Nancy's Masterpiece (green drawing) with the Black Box. It should technically mean that you regain your teleport power 25% faster all the time. 
---
Green + Yellow drawings.
---
Pill bottle and whatever. 
---
I wouldn't mix and match action speed add-ons except with Red Paint Brush and if I'm running that I always pair that with Swing Chains.
---
Uhm, I think the blocks are okay. I think the Green and Brown blocks that give them blindness stack but don't quote me. But making them blind doesn't do very much. The purple block is okay. Can be all right for tracking. 
---
It's funny; Red Paint Brush, Swing Chains and Jump Rope are INCREDIBLY strong add-ons especially when used with Thana like I said. But his other add-ons are not nearly on the same level.
---
I like it +1

Removed since you juat posted the same thread 27 minutes ago

Doctor's Mori on Feng

c’mon man, he should be OP, not this

new killer: The Butt

The spirit has an annoying add on called prayer bead bracelet and he was making fun of it

Cleansing is the biggest mistake you can do against Plague.

Delete?
---
Upon getting hooked survivors respawn in a random locker. On third death its over.
---
BOOM camping/tunneling fixed!
---
ur post is removed
---
PS4 dbd has a lower fanbase, however xbox 1 and PC have high amounts of people
---
I don’t like playing against Myers because of his extremely small terror radius, but he’s very cool and fun to play. I played a tombstone Myers who destroyed my rank 19 teammates, 2 people were dead. me and another dude were lying on the ground in front of him in a line to be killed
---
Nobody deflected anything, and you see the tag? You worried survivors get balanced or?
---
Thrilling Tremors, Corrupt intervention, and the new Surge all seem to be good gen protection perks.
---
And then she slugs everyone and DCs.
---
The post was removed.
---
The gay part was a joke and I agree people who run noed are planning on failing the objective but people should be able to tell which totem is noed like a faint glow and the only hex ruin really gives people a reason to do totems but that’s usually the only one they do
---
what do I do if I play m1 killers then?
---
It be nice if one of the mods could tell me why, because I didnt do it.
---
Mother of god Shrek would be so scary. All star playing while he chases you repeating “This is my swamp!”... good god.
---
Your removing the post?
---
I have a new killer idea.
---
How about a killer that can teleport to survivors in just a blink and there is no cooldown and 0 counter play.
---
Oh wait it already exist.
---
Seems like a genuine conversation to me
---
I love it when I run halfway through the map, over various obstacles and into a building, then slowly walk away thinking I lost her..
---
Only for her to appear through the goddamn floor and slash me.
---
Mostly in the comments
---
What about U you? /u/metroidman
---
Tapp &gt; Steve 
---
These new prestige characters need more blood on them.
---
I don’t even know what tunneling is
---
what's live going to change? there's people playing, already
---
I don't really, never had the chanse probably, and about my skill there is a lot to question. You need to be on your Best behavior to get a perfect game, guess i never was doing my job fully until now. Before hand i ether got a slug 4k 1-2 hooks so no full sacrifice points, or got a 1-2k witch obviously means no perfect game
---
So I used Balance earlier in the match and it worked as normal. I wonder if my Balance activating at the same time as the DC would have caused it?
---
You could have edited the original comment
---
WHY YOU STOP RUNNING NOOOO
---
It is clearly a discussion of game mechanics
---
To this day I still think Leatherdaddy has the best p3 look, and he's actually a solid mid tier killer with PWYF
---
Jane's P3 is basically SOAKED, it's ridiculous
---
Honestly I encounter far more clowns and bubbas with NOED than any other.
---
Good survivors don't run away in her lullaby and with M&amp;A she has 12m TR so it's really helpful to trick survivors.
---
Remember when you got this upset over hide and seek? Crazy
---
Brand new parts only save 6 seconds per part. Ain't even that great. I don't know but I imagine a tremendously increased repair speed is better overall
---
I legit lost hope
---
it's...a metaphor for rape. that's always a yikes.
---
Which killer? Sorry for asking.
---
I wish it was a full jacket
---
Just started using huntress regularly and some of the shots you can get on unhooking survivors are hilarious.
---
Huntress came before iron maiden
---
Who would've thought a Venus flytrap could kill people?
---
I retarded. Iron Maiden is useless if your not the huntress*
---
It looks like a child drew it. You should be a proud parent them taking your interests!
---
Killers don’t care
---
Neither do I, rather get to the next game
---
It's impossible for me to encounter a Myers without noed
---
Dud (reference XD) no I’m not that good at drawing so I try to make it look cute :(
---
This is a very good tier list maybe pig to rank and change bubba for legion and is perfect
---
yes, tall thing is very tall
---
True
---
God it drives me crazy when someone misses a skill Check and the sound of the gen explosion covers up the skill check sound so I miss my skill check. It’s a vicious cycle.
---
Is the question really killing you?
---
Well you have potential to get better so I suggest getting back into drawing!
---
K thx bud

Ghostface is not better than Trapper in my opinion and even though I'm not a fan of her, Plague would be in high mid tier if she was here.
---
.... this could be a fanfic. I love the idea of lesbian bike gang Kate.
---
my mother is trying to chemically castrate me and i dont know what to do :((
---
a disk write error could be many factors including, but not limited to, drive going bad or full
---
Yeah, it's like it's causing a sharp pain every time I think about it. It feels so blatantly obvious and I can't seem to wrap my head around it.
---
What kind of Trapper doesn't lay at least one trap near the switch?
---
Herman.
---
Wasted more like 5k bp for me double to 10k when I unhook the whole team
---
Urrr Urrr why so many Legion cosplay, low effort and it's always the same. WHAT YOU ARE BEING IRONIC ABOUT LOW EFFORT COSPLAY UNFUNNY AND STUPID &gt;:(
---
Ayy now we know what you were talking about. I was really curious about what the post was talking about
---
My favourite build is Insidious on Myers
---
You played kyf
---
Ummm this game is for 18 and older. You shouldn't be breaking the law
---
Just saying this isn't funny anymore.
---
PTB can end at any moment.
---
Yea, when I got Legion, I was excited for Iron Maiden but after a short while only use it on her since at higher levels, locker use becomes rare. It's still not op but works well for reloading and the occasional locker hermit/head on user. Inner Strength will be giving it a boost too. 
---
Huntress is definitely not top tier, I would say around par with Legion as their effectiveness aligns a lot with your own ability to be tactical with their skills and counterplay people who know their weaknesses. Her slower speed alone is tough to make up for.
---
Hey! Who put a picture of my on the internet!?!?
---
Yeah I know but still
---
They used to be very broken, now they're not, gen rush is almost a thing of the past. It's not really worth it, especially as gens can be completely regressed with one hit by killers unlike the old 25%.
---
It’s a real thing. It’s Blake griffin, an NBA power forward. He’s 6”10.
---
Biker Kate got the community like
---
lol ik I’m just addicted now I completed mgsv when I was 9 or 10 I’m official ya GaMeR
---
*Laughs in extra buttons on mouse*
---
I can scratch all the things!
---
That's actually what I was thinking, lol.
---
BABY survivor
---
Just treat it like huntresses hatchets
---
Auto mod removes it since it had cunt in the title take that out and the bot won't auto flag it
---
Not so much the face
---
Everyone will complain about everything, don’t let it get to you if you don’t do well for your fellow survivors.
---
What does it mean when a Survivor "farms" another survivor? Sorry, don't play much.
---
Yikers, dcing because there's nobody else for the killer to chase? I mean seriously, do these people just expect to be invincible and invisible for the rest of the game after being unhooked or something???
---
And also my dad is gonna start playing dbd cuz he’s a stranger things fan XD so technically I’m allowed
---
Yeah am I taking crazy pills here? People seem to be asserting it's fine to run everywhere as long as there's no terror radius. Ignoring the fact there are many stealth killers, red marks are very visible from a distance. Run only when you KNOW the killer is on the other side of the map or otherwise busy.
---
You get messaged on Xbox tho. All they have to do is click on your name post game.
---
No.
---
That's actually smart, like how many unhooks will you have in a game
---
Bruh dbd and siege is my cocktail as well. The surge as well cause it was free and minecraft.
---
**sips so loudly that it creates a blackhole**
---
I don't mind saying this as long as we agree that tunneling, camping, using iridescent heads and ebony moris are also completely legitimate because I've seen plenty of people defend "gen rushing" and then turn around and act like the killer is breaking some sort of law for doing those things
---
Jigsaw would be ashamed
---
Bruh, anything Is better than sprint burst + dead hard
---
She’s slow and slows down to throw hatchets. If she’s constantly throwing hatchets and missing, she’ll be slow as a snail and constantly be going to lockers.
---
It doesn’t look like it’s removed
---
No mither + self care as an exception
---
It must be very bloody hard to think with all that pain
---
This happened to me today with a survivor with sprint burst, luckily I was playing clown and once you hit them with your primary weapon it goes away.
---
*sips so loudly the whole universe gets destroyed*
---
The "dad who thinks you holding a flashlight means you're learning" and "no shine it there, no *THERE*, just give me that" immersion?
---
Thank you for getting me.
---
Me, a nea main, can confirm most Nea’s are toxic
---
Can I worry about my saiyan pride?
---
could you link a picture or video of janes P3? i can’t seem to find a picture of it all
---
Always
---
I think a lot of killers in this game take the victim attitude and claim survivors bully them. I really don't hear great killers throwing around this statement. That's where my previous comment came from.
---
Report that fucker. Teach her a lesson.
---
I sHoUlD aLwAyS wIn
---
I love doing this because I usually always run rainbow maps
---
What's tc
---
Literally two days ago
---
Is it good? I was thinking of coping it. Is it as toxic.
---
Hahaha if only you played on PC. Even bad nurses can do well sometimes but good nurses? I get a DC the moment they see my cosmetic most times. It’s prestiged.
---
I have you know that last time I played against the nurse I didnt even DC at the start of the game
---
Yeah I thought they were the same type of game till doom 2016 came out tbh. Never played diablo
---
welp time to delete it then
---
It is almost as if the other person was being just as obtuse with reaching claims and assumptions about other people's expectations of the game. Hmmmmm.
---
I like that skin, but i prefer the shirt to be the sweater she has.
---
Because I can who’s gonna shut me up 🌝
---
No, I existed before them. Might change my name to avoid confusion in the future.
---
Almost definitely a real McDonald's. Their menu changes according to region.
---
If feel Ebony Moris, like keys, break game-flow and are pretty much uncounterable. As such, they have ni place in the game.
---
Actually, some kind of ogre character with just brute fucking strength based off eastern European fairy tales could be a cool idea
---
This is so hilarious.
---
I think it’s real. Unless Filipino rip offs are detailed enough to make even the fries containers on the counter the brand.
---
Hook farming is the act of carelessly unhooking someone, regardless of where the killer is, for quick points. It usually ends in the killer downing them and re-hooking them.
---
SPOILER SPOILER
---
i think it’s supposed to look like the one from the end of season 3. I like the p3 render better. Looks like the original.
---
Can dream snares be deactivated or crouched over like Hag/Trapper?
---
Thx fam
---
ya but that defeats the entire purpose of the timer pausing when operating her key boxes.
---
Look who’s shittin in the tall grass
---
should've just bought an actual chainsaw. would be way better to kill people with
---
Thanks! Wasn’t sure about it so I appreciate you clearing it up.
---
Was doing a daily, lol
---
Then it’s excused
---
Well ya look silly thats why, if it saved them time and money they did it. Unless you have a background in any form of programming you cant call the devs lazy
---
Suggestion: Maybe make the explosion work like diversion, and you have to stay in the killers terror radius for 55/50/45 seconds. Also maybe Moment of courage could work like an outside DS, where if you hit it, it drops the survivor they're carrying, but make it stun for less time, and maybe give it a token limit. Let me know if that's too over/underpowered
---
I’ve come to realize this game is so fucked with toxic little shits, be it children or just fucking wannabe fucking famous twitch streamers,or whatever. I miss the days where people fucking played and didn’t fucking do malicious shit because they lost
---
Hindered status slows your movement speed. It would essentially make any survivor easy pickings so long as they have a trap on.
---
They don’t hand out bans for no reason, obviously you did something you’re not telling us about
---
People complain about you playing the game
---
Dbd on galaxy watch
---
A mod would message me saying your post has been removed “reason here” earthier your seeing stuff or a mod is to lazy to message me why it’s removed
---
Type of bug: Ingame
---
Description: When playing as a killer, if you hook a survivor and they inmediately disconnect (while the hooking animation) it will count as a DC, giving only points for the disconnection and not the complete sacrifice, the thing is that the hook breaks anyways  
---
How to reproduce: Probably if the survivor disconnects during the hook animation, but its a rare thing to happen so not sure yet
---
Are all Pig mains as arrogant as yourself?
---
Missed opportunity to make stonks into oinks
---
They’d have all the exclusives and would know how to loop the killers into the ground before any counter play or knowledge of looping was introduced
---
Played a game of trapper right after this one tho
---
ezio aint got shit on you
---
Wym trapper is the best
---
The moment they bashed my favorite pizza boy in, I was done. I have YouTube’d summaries of the seasons sense, and well...
---
My girlfriend finds urban immersion hilarious so she uses it all the time.  I tease her but it's so amusing to listen to her giggle about it.
---
I have a large background in programming and formatting the devs were lazy shits period
---
Flair checks out
---
That’s saying something
---
Why would you willingly post something that you know you’ll get hate for. That’s not a good enough reason to DC
---
Good comic but dont co.pare that glorious scene to exit door tbagging.
---
i run literally everywhere. if the killer sees me, so be it, I know I can loop him better than my idiot teammates—including SWF😅
---
I've had a toxic Meg rely on adrenaline and teammates to survive, then pretends they're good, met them twice now and everytime someone comments on my profile they come back to my profile to repeat how "trash" I am, like they won't leave me alone
---
Then u have 5k points.
---
I can do that

Oh damn, Desert Treasure. Nostalgia just hit, thanks for that.

Sounds bout right

I didn’t ask for validation don’t care if you think it’s good enough or not lol. Just wanted to say that it’s not happening

I wish there could be one of these but about adrenaline

Always makes my day when I spawn right next to ruin.

Where is your body bro holy shit
---
Its called saving time and resources, why do extra work when you have the model right there?
---
are you fine with survivors doing that when they get a killer they do not like?
---
U didnt hear him making leather sounds?
---
Hag is secco
---
Karma doesn’t matter to me. And I’m a survivor main anyway but I like the Billy flair more. Don’t play killer enough to put up with that amount of bullshit
---
It’s called buying customers that want to enjoy the game if they didn’t have the recourses then they shouldn’t have released shit

are we really complaining about brand new parts as if they havent been gutted repeatedly

Honestly I agree with you that Haddonfield is bullshit, but I can’t say that on this sub without my karma getting fucked
---
Nah, the Second Hook was after the gate opened 65 seconds ago and while he was tunneling the person they cleansed the Totem.
---
Record yourself doing the jump-stab idle animation when it’s finished lol
---
The killer shack pallet (or god pallet) is the safest pallet in the game you can only drop it when you are injured  or when the chase become longer then 1 min
---
30 percent gen progress gone
---
well then I find it pretty hypercritical for you not to do the same as killer but that is my opinion on it
---
They really need to fix Haddonfield. Hopefully that happens mid-chapter patch.
---
True. I still have a lot to get better at.
---
Graphics are looking better.
---
I've been using lot's of head and shoulders lately
---
*Butt* when they do have it, it's so satisfying.
---
FTFY
---
to be fair, its only if you trap them AFTER all the gens are powered.
---
save the best for last is pretty good, as is play with your food to help with loops. enduring i also like, as well as infectious fright or nurses for tracking
---
Except both of those perks are negated by cleansing totems.
---
You can't permanently take away exhaustion perks.
---
The killer shack is known as the god pallet because it’s one of the best loops in the game. On one side you have a window you can jump through or even just stand at if the killer decides to back peddle. On the other side you have two normal doorways but one of them has a pallet which can be used. You can loop a killer there for a very long amount of time as long as you play it right. Therefore naming the god pallet. Especially since even AFTER doing that loop there is usually at least another two loops right next to it. The god pallet is just the best way to get your furthest distance on a killer though cause they must either break it or go all the way around. Sorry this was long but there’s many reason why the pallet is so good
---
Seeing no comments is a pretty old glitch in Reddit so that’s probably why

If we can all come to an agreement that nurse is fundamentally flawed, and honestly too strong, let’s all have a discussion about how to fix this. A lot of people suggest reworking her add-ons, but that doesn’t fix that fact that it’s her base kit that’s flawed, being able to blatantly ignore game mechanics is an issue, and I think the only real way to fix her is to give her a full rework, the way they did Freddy
---
Laughs in nurse.
---
I get the point. It's on it's way, and it's the real thing.
---
They all just kinda gave up and went down together.
---
It's on it's way in the mail.
---
If anything I see the blame towards the survivor
---
*rank 17 console nurse enters chat*

Allow killer to leave via exit gate or hatch is more like it ahahah
---
True i have to agree with you
---
"You're like a little bunny, prancin about eatin your lettuce and berries"

I did the same to a Myers with a mori at rank 8 a while ago. I got two rank points in the process

Salty survivors inbound
---
A GAME Theory!
---
Establishing map pressure isn't always an option for certain killers unfortunately.
---
Aside from Nurse and Billy, the most mobile killers are somewhat situational with map presence. 
---
- Spirit sacrifices chase potential to use her power to patrol. 
---
- Hag has to set up first and hope no one preemptively triggers the traps around her area of control. 
---
- Freddy has a super long cooldown that is also tied to survivors not finishing their objectives. 
---
- Wraith , while faster cloaked, is only barely faster than tier 2 bloodlust unless he uses Windstorm addons. 
---
- Legion's power makes them faster, but not even faster than cloaked Wraith. On top of that, they also take a 4 second stun whenever they use Feral Frenzy. It also goes on a hefty cooldown once used. And, their power is used for chases, meaning using it to get around wastes their chase potential. 
---
Those are the most map dominant killers in the game, and they are mostly held back by some kind of drawback in their kit. The rest of the killers have no mobility, so they have to patrol the gens very slowly, putting all the pressure on them to end chases quickly with mediocre powers that don't help much. 
---
- Trapper has the worst of it given that on top of having no mobility, he also has to sacrifice patrol time for set-up time. 
---
- Huntress is a close second given that she's the slowest killer in the game without any mobility in her power.
---
The rest just regular suck at map pressure and have somewhat lackluster powers that take too much setup to create pressure (Myers, Pig, Ghostface, Plague) or they have a bait power that hinders them in chase (Leatherface, Clown, Doctor).
---
Calling the killer a "tunneler" for downing a survivor who is already injured, when he's getting farmed by someone not using BT.
---
But I don’t have an acc on Imgflip so you probably will not believe me but idc everyone

has people who understand and others who are always hating no matter what

He didn't just close the hatch. He straight-up killed it.

Why do you focus on the words so much? The meaning is is literally just that ' tunnel vision '. It's not an insult, it's just stating what happened

You have become the very thing you swore to destroy.

You are too kind.

Didn't they say something like they'll be experimenting with adding it to other perks and killers in future patches?

HE NEEDS TO BE NERFED SMH

WHY IS A KILLER ALLOWED TO INJURE PEOPLE SMH

Freddy has nicer skin though.

Shock dat sucker open!

As of rn only demo but they said it will most likely be coming to some perks and killers such as the wraith and pig

I can agree with omega blink but i feel spirit is more fun to play against.
---
They mentioned they got the 3d model straight from netflix, but the demo in season 1 was a suit most of the time, whereas the season 3 demo is all cgi, so it makes sense they're using the model from season 3.
---
Self-care and urban lol. Could you be anymore useless?
---
Thanks for watching!
---
Rule number one vs a Trapper is to treat him as if he was a velociraptor; don't go into the long grass.
---
you can just start running if you dont want to be healed though lmao
---
That’s how Freddy started out when he was released
---
Equally bad imo you get 1 play with said perk then you realize (why am I dumb)
---
Because words matter and typically calling someone a "tunneler killer" isn't a good thing.
---
For what
---
Maybe you should just learn to play lol
---
LMAO people wont enjoy freddy because he shares a model with Quentin? Are you serious? Freddy is a top 7 killer now, i think people enjony him
---
Sure, I'll think about it. Haven't played in years, but thought about coming back when I heard they are finally updating terrorist hunt. It actually got me to [open the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWzXzAhKI3k) lmao

Find the meaning behind those specifc words, not take them as insults
---
I know you're just being a cunt but yes :) I CAN
---
I love no0b3. Whenever I see people trash no0b3 it's usually for some silly poopoo. I saw someone on here say no0b3 was just abusing game mechanics by using all four perk slots. And they were serious.
---
I feel like, even if nurse ignores a game mechanic, it’s the same with most killers. They either add a game mechanic or remove one to give themself a benefit.
---
I like this a lot actually

Is that roblox.

Nvm you're a toll, have a good day!

Get out mah swamp!

They’ve said that in the PTB the new Undetectable and Oblivious status’ will only be applied to the Demogorgon and Freddy, with the intention of applying it to other Killers and Perks in updates leading up to the Mid Chapter Patch.
---
Just a bit of banter mate no need for the hate 😂
---
Nah thats "Escape The Facility"
---
*ASCENDED*
---
not hating I just do not understand the point you are trying to make?
---
Huntress
---
As survivor, that's an achievement. Takes killer maybe 10 games
---
If we're talking about the gorgon I definitely agree plus since people don't know how to counter the shred(lunge) consistently yet it makes him seem way better then he is. For  trapper he definitely needs a buff like c'mon he's on the front of the boxart atleast make him good
---
Fam it's a joke....theres no point... What do u want from me? 😂
---
I see quite a few David’s and Adam’s doing this as well
---
I know exactly what you mean (I use it to varying degrees—typically more successfully than a 360 for me at least), and yes I can help. 
---
The weaving they do is actually quite easy to punish, if you know what you’re doing: instead of lunging (which is what the weaving is meant to bait out), get right up on them and do a quick swing; this grants you a sort of “lock on”, that ensures your swings connect when they try to get slippery. Sometimes the “auto aim” loses its shit and aims at something stupid like a wall or pallet, but 99% of the time you’ll hit them. (Fun fact: this is also how you bait out and punish Dead Hard, by getting on top of them, wait for their lunge, then short swing them into the dirt.)
---
to understand what the joke is
---
Fear no killer in DBD. You must stare down the Hag. Assert dominance. Let that Hag know she doesn't scare you. You are the alpha. 
---
And then the killer proceeds to make you their bitch.
---
Hes terror radius sound should be the  Smash Mouth-  All Star song.

I’m not gonna complain about free bloodpoints, as far as I’m concerned, demo-dog just became my go to BP farmer

Ummm, idk. it mostly sounds like they weren't toxic. Was it really just the tbagging because looping is how they survive longer. Camping is really up to you tbh.  I think it is more fun to go after others instead of just standing there. I don't tend to get bothered with the "toxic" things in this game though. I am just there to have fun and make fun of myself for all the stupid shit that I do 😄.

How do u do it lol. I'm done playing killer for a but, too many rules and too much stress. I know 360ing on console but I dont understand why turning my camera the opposite way of turning my character makes me spin faster. When I just spin my character it's slow af. Idgi.

The worse thing i've done as Pig is this one time where I noticed this Feng's timer was ready to reach it's end and she found the last box, so instead of just hitting her, I scared her and chased her OFF the box and then quickly ran away so the timer would keep going.
---
She didn't make it in time.

Definitely is plus curvy loops counter the lunge hard and can't stop it meaning overshooting while Hillbilly can curve and stop his chainsaw

My favourite hate comments have been stuff like "Hope you and your family die in a fire" "Your dog is gone" "Your future dogs, cats, children are gone" "Gay, you suck dick" and a guy who seemed a bit insistent on calling me a "salty little cracker"
---
That’s what I was going for there, I’ll check the post again and see if I can find a way to make it clearer. I had the idea that an Obsession has a reason to fear doing the gens, as they might get injured and make themselves vulnerable to the killer. Not to mention due to it’s Hex perk status, it could be be cleansed before Hex: Fatal Contraption becomes a serious problem for the Obsession.
---
Dream snare. Only works on people asleep. Anyone who has a brain can work around that.

Did you just say the game lacked variety while flexing about the fact that you only camp?
---
Examples?
---
Why not? I love it!
---
It's been posted for like 2 hours so I mean I don't think it will plus tier lists haven't been posted alot currently
---
Thought this too
---
I think your tier list is a little bit biased because the only 2 that can’t teleport were they want are the only S tiers.
---
I was extreme tunneled and camped for no reason. At the start of the match.
---
Argument hmmmm “please do not try to start a argument with me or anyone else in the comments”

oof

You aren't alone.

The reverse can easily be asked my friend. It's an assymetrical online game. It's kind of to be expected

There is so much variety and plenty of leveling progression it's just you're bad at the game, always resort to facecamping, and are stuck

Look up Blake griffin. Assumed it was him because of how similar they look. From the back they are identical. Thought it was him.

Didn’t you know, you can’t loop a nurse so there’s no counter play. You could try adapting your playstyle to counter her but you know, she’s OP.
---
No it's called be either uneducated or ignorant.

In this context, you are equating 'gay' to dumb/stupid/unlikable.

If you're a white dude and someone was like 'wow noed is so fucking white, like honestly', you think that's being a fucking edgelord? No. It's  being an asshole. You're being an asshole, not edgy. There is a difference, as tiny as it is.

How come you're not rank 1 then? Just barely play? You should be ranking up every match
---
very mature and non toxic gamer

(insert Randy Orton saying "stupid" repeatedly here)
---
When they step into trappers trap
---
The nurse and spirit can travel and go through objects when they want. Others that teleport have to place/interact with objects around the map to teleport. I.e Freddy, demogorgon,
---
also unlike how you edited one of your last comments. Trust me I'm not the toxic one. Heard what you have been saying to people?
---
Spirit might not be able to go through walls I never play her and hardly ever face her. Haven’t played in 3 weeks until today.
---
If it's not bannable, you wouldn't be this worried, would you?  This is not strategic body blocking. This is with intention to grief a player.

It’s called a joke and that’s why I put the part at the end to show I actually care about the community I have a gay friend I don’t hate him I don’t hate the community at all

Hello my brother
---
I put a flair because it’s a discussion and something a lot of people hate so that is why I made the post
---
L
---
Doesn't sound deliberately obtuse to me? His beginning question seems obviously rhetorical although unnecessary. The guy he is responding to is specifically talking about being able to leave through hatch with an active bear trap. 
---
The dude responds by stating the traps are used for stall, which is true. Expecting the trap to kill people when trying to go through hatch (it's framed as if that is a bad function) wouldn't be okay since that would be the only counterplay to it at that point in the match. It's not a good strategy to try to do boxes at the end of the match because it's RNG and time is against you. All the dude is saying is a stalling ability shouldn't give a free kill just because it's the end of the match. That would be too strong.
---
All I am saying is your purposely obtuse statement does not address what he said and doesn't do anything for the sake of the argument. His statement isn't even wrong and yet he's mass downvoted lmao.
---
OL
---
Take this poor man‘s gold 🥇
---
I wouldn't really consider that bias it's more so they have better traveling and movement which just makes them better while Freddy is stuck to teleporting to pallets or hag having to place traps which makes them a little worse. for the demogorgon you need to stand on the traps to teleport you also can't replace traps meaning if survivors don't mess with them you could be out of a trap.
---
All I ever want to do with people like these I send a sound bite of a baby crying
---
On console the role of best killer is contested but on pc nurse is miles ahead.
---
You can always get better, there’s a reason some of us can get to rank 1 and stay there, it’s not just good luck.
---
You win some you lose some, but saying you can’t improve anymore is on you.
---
If you make a post that says discussion on it, don’t throw off any ones attempts to have a discussion with you or you might as well of not posted at all. Such as me asking you about how the perk is completely counterable before the perk even has the chance of being used.
---
Rick's perks: afk, things, stuff.
---
Also, why make rick the survivor when you could suggest Daryl.
---
Bruh have you ever played killer
---
Can confirm as a rank one Wraith. Cloaklivesmatter
---
Oof but still I wouldn't consider tier list spammed or posted about too much
---
With the release of the new chapter i expect the ps4 player base to increase 2x but probably retain about 40% of those new players after awhile
---
Okay, so what’s the nerf to NOED?
---
Cause Rick is more popular and is like the face of the whole franchise, so he'd be the most likely
---
Depends on playstyle. If you prefer movement over other abilities then yes, spirit and nurse and easy S tiers. Some people might not have spirit up there but in b tier. Every dbd tier list is somewhat based off personal experience and play style.
---
Isn’t that the site that says self-care is the best survivor perk?
---
imagine having a 2:30 minute timer on top of a 2:00 minute timer both of which mean instant death with no way of escaping and thinking that's balanced.
---
To be fair, half of the fun of this game is adrenaline to me, the amount of crazy plays that made possible, the screams over discord... golden.
---
Adrenaline is fine as-is imo
---
And yes, survivors despise NOED and they ARE similar, not only that, they are essentially the same perk for different sides. NOED is completely fair because adrenaline is and vice versa imo
---
Spirit can't but she has great mobility and chase potential making her really good and it's kinda a guessing game sometimes if she's chasing you
---
The killer's job is to impede gameplay and grief players. The killer still wastes time doing this in a similar way to facecamping near guaranteeing a kill while wasting time letting gens get done. Do you consider camping a reportable offense? What difference would it make if the killer just hooked the player in this scenario?
---
This but give a lower bonus to other survivors with the perk too, otherwise it’s a waste of a perk slot entirely. Perhaps only have the sprint burst after a gen is done and the survivor who did the gen gets the heal.
---
noed was created to balance adrenaline
---
What now?
---
Just now, I realized that people test killers too much. Like tbag on the exit. I did because I had realized where to stand if I got downed I would just escape. Me and one other person were left when I got downed and escaped. But the other person tested em too much. They got sacrificed because they didn’t have the right tbag position
---
Literally read “Wet Dream Snare” yikes.
---
Says the rank 1 survivor main who has never touched a killer before
---
Since when does the timer keep going when you're in a chase?
---
Hey hey I’m a solo player and behalf of all solo players I have to say this is true
---
Competitive game
---
Its expected that one of the sides that play the game will become toxic or be viewed as toxic by the other side, even if they're not being toxic
---
And then the retaliation comes, and the one side that was being viewed as toxic, starts to see the other as toxic too, even if they're not being toxic as well
---
And then people start being toxic for real to get revenge
---
When you realize, the toxicity has spread and grow on a rate that it becomes staple and common knowledge that the players on the game are toxic and entitled, even by outsiders
---
Its a vicious circle bound to happen, sadly
---
What a trash baby killer
---
More like Trapper and Pig
---
Exactly and that's just my opinion to be honest and coming from playing survivor alot(I play killer too but I'm using survivor knowledge more then killer knowledge) these are the results when I go against them, like nurses and spirits usually 4k and the success rate getting lower the more you go down etc etc.
---
That's actually really hot
---
yes and I don't rely on NOED to get my kills
---
rant would have fit better
---
Adrenaline is balanced lmao

Next up is those damn gates
---

---
if you google "what does drop the soap mean" every result is "a metaphor for [prison] rape" but ok i guess
---
I feel like there's a huge difference between rank 6 and rank 1. I've gotten better so can handle red ranks now but I remember a while back I'd easily get 4k's every time in purple but as soon as I'd hit red I'd get wrecked.
---
I play both Killer and survivor and i don't see an issue with adrenaline.
---
You are STILL trying to defend the fact that you said something people are CLEARLY not okay with, but justified it by 'lol but it's a joke'. Instead of saying something that pisses people off, and then saying 'lol jk', JUST DON'T SAY IT. That should not be a hard concept to grasp dude. Grab a fucking thesaurus and look up the dozens of other ways to express your dislike of something, instead of saying something that could offend an entire group of people. Expand your vocabulary. Stop being an asshole. Eat your vegetables.
---
Again - THIS IS NOT A HARD CONCEPT TO GRASP.

I have and don't need to rely on NOED, thanks for the assumption I guess? I'm flattered you think I'm red rank survivor, but I hit red rank more as killer than survivor (thank my potato teammates when playing solo survivor for that)
---
I disagree, both GF and Pig are alright when they aren't countered with detection perks, and they also can't/shouldn't use their powers 100% of the time which makes the perks still at least semi-useful.
---
Wraith on the other hand is kind of the worst of both worlds, even when he's not countered he's still pretty lackluster, and the change basically makes detection perks useless against him since he'll be undetectable 90% of the time.

Experienced the same glitch earlier today. A friend had the same thing a coupla weeks ago
---
Not even really an Ash main haha, I can play any operator aside from the new ones over the past couple of years.
---
All bout dem teachable perks boi
---
I've actually never seen the hatch spawn in
---
TIL Kate had a different voice.Tell me more?
---
Pretty good job
---
If you have a problem with what I say don’t comment just ignore it
---
We got Detective Tapp for the saw survivor. Being the most loved character really doesn't matter either.
---
HOLY HELL
---
So for those of you who don't know, this is Wild Bill from the travelchannel show called "Mountain Monsters", now he is HANDS DOWN the most insane dude, and honestly the only suitable for DbD.
---
Now I'm sure this will get overlooked and all, but I think it'd be dank to have him in.
---
It would probably give the show some more popularity too seeing as it's probably not that well known.
---
Yeah I don’t understand why some people DC late game on the hook when they are the only people left. At least get your bp
---
It doesn't. You won't catch up to them. I know at rank 20 it works out great for you but when you're not playing against potato's it doesn't work that way.
---
When the new dying light comes out, that will be an excellent perk on freddy.
---
Let me tell you bud, NOED and RUIN are literally the only thing that make playing killer worth it. Without them, it’s basically children bullying the lone kid on the playground.
---
I think it's more likely they'll cleanse a totem at the start of the match and bank the heal for later when they need it, since it stays active after a totem is cleansed until it is used to heal. Theoretically, it could be used as an Adrenaline substitute that doesn't exhaust you.
---
Get Decisive Strike one of Laurie's teachables.
---
One change that i would make is that adrenaline cant pop if you're being carried or hooked
---
As of NOED, i would maybe put a aura revealing its location to survivors if it pops, since i see a lot of people saying:
---
Me NoT wAnT tO sEaRcH tOtEnS
---
&gt;I play both Killer and survivor
---
No one believes you and you're one of those guys that believes people have to play by your made up rules. So you're trying to be a contrarian and shut down anyone you disagree with.
---
Kobe
---
you rank up an entire rank every single match?
---
Damn, there'a a crazy amount of JoJo on this sub. Not complaining though.
---
Yo, that's weird as fuck. I mean, what's with that vertical filming? Bizarre.
---
Ur “skill” won’t be at the lvl if u keep using noed, I don’t main either, but certainly play better as a killer (red ranks, any killer) and as killer u don’t really want to play for endgame, u want to make sure everyone dies to pip(also u have to hook 9 times at least) and ruin is not gonna help u to learn cause it is ur 2nd chance. U can run it, I do it when I see some specific players/warming game, but even with 4K on those games I usually safe pip only.
---
I suggested Lizzie Borden (from the Lizzie Borden Chronicles) as a survivor and Charles Siringo as the killer!
---
The next chapter won’t have a map so it might be a licensed killer, unless they are making an original killer and want to focus on making more current maps balanced rather than making new maps all the time. Both are equally likely imo
---
Just kill them before endgame and you never have to deal with it.
---
More like the new It movie lol
---
New map: Forbidden Swamp
---
Killer: The Ogre
---
Survivor: Lord Farquaad
---
yeah my mate uses DS and i’ve thought about it
---
And you're just a troll.
---
At least you get to Have some Bloodpoints
---
C'mon guys, dude's just excited, had a gg
---
Let him express his fellings huh
---
I had my phone at max volume and my headphones fell out and the music started blasting
---
Jesus calm down. U must’ve gotten tbagged one too many times. I read what he said and he said that he can’t even facecamp effectively against a coordinated team UNLESS he’s a chainsaw killer (anybody else with me!) which if not toxic is quite cheap and generally not indicative of skill.
---
You can literally click on it and see the list yourself ya know. And no, Adrenaline is listed higher. And everyone gets a vote.
---
Oof Dem Downvotes
---
So killer was really easy, wasn't toxic and you guys still stayed at exit teabagging?
---
No idea why the DC . . .
---
How about we stop trying to change perks that are fine the way they are?
---
You posted something on a public platform that bothers an entire group of people. I'll say what I damn well please about it.
---
If you don't like it, delete or edit your post. Btw good job going from the bunch of other excuses, to now saying 'well if you don't like it, leave'. Just outed yourself and showed your true colors ;)
---
I'ma bout to die laughing.
---
Wholesome
---
petition for the devs to ignore this comment and buff legion instead
---
How about learning to kill survivors before the last gen pops?
---
Nope. Nobody had time to go to the exit. As soon as the last gen was turned on, they dc. I wasn’t toxic in the slightest, I just blendette my way around it. I did one and a half gens by myself too
---
Banned for killing as killer.
---
Self caring during noed.
---
I understand Ruin, but relying on NOED does not help you improve, constantly hitting end game and needing that insta-down + speed boost to edge out an extra kill when you could've just played better earlier in the match.
---
There's a reason any notable player doesn't ever run NOED outside of the occasional end game build.
---
So you’re the potato who can’t catch up to the survivor after adrenaline pops?
---
whenever i play billy for my dailys im reminded of what winning feels like
---
OP:*Camps*
---
Also OP:"This game has no variety."
---
I remember stunning a Michael one time as he was carrying a survivor. It was probably my best moment ever as a survivor.
---
This meme.... It's perfect
---
Just put a legion mask over it
---
Thanks for congratulating me but dude still if you have a problem report me or just ignore
---
Platform: PC (PTB)
---
Type of Bug: Performance
---
Description: Severe stuttering and hitching in the PTB. Game has microfreezing. Live runs fine.
---
Screenshot / Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Bmd-IGp4S0&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
Steps to reproduce: Happens in the menu and ingame.
---
Expected result: Game should run fine like live.
---
Actual result: Stuttering and hitching.
---
Reproduction rate: 100%. Tried restarting game, restarting PC, verifying cache, updating GPU drivers, reinstalling game, etc.
---
System Specs (PC only): Intel I7 8700K @ 3.70 GHZ, 16gb DDR4 RAM, 1080ti GPU, running in windows 10 on an SSD.
---
Banned for using mechanics to aggrieve player. There's actually category for this. It's your own fault for not reading.
---
I just switch to pop or thanato if i see a map
---
I asked my sister if I was trippin balls
---
Killer is hard. And stressful. But if you're relying on noed for most of your kills, you're not any better than someone who gets a 1-0k every game without running noed.
---
Something tells me that's why the Demagorgon has a bunch of generator perks too; Feels like these are all to push Ruin out of the meta.
---
Add approximately 10 extra gens to be done and maybe this could be an idea, but honestly this would be a terrible decision to add to the game
---
Worried? I'm not worried. I'm afraid you'd waste your time, that's all.
---
And no, it is strategic. If it was griefing, he'd be doing it to waste time. Which he isn't, he was doing it to gurantee a kill. Even if it's extremely shitty, which i agree.
---
See people say this, but the toxic survivors I encounter are seriously so few and far between. Like in my past 15 hours of games i think i had ONE player talk shit in the post game lobby. Even the killer games I played I didnt have toxic players in. My friend even joked through discord about how I was going to get raged at when I told him I was punishing these kids for getting unhooked and then staying near said hook, and it was all just GGs in the post game. They could have flipped their shit at me for soft patrolling, but it didnt happen. I have only ever seen that shit at red ranks, and pretty much any game at high rank becomes a toxic sweaty shitfest.
---
And 2 of them are absolute garbage meaning they failed
---
I really hope this gets crossplay, so my GF and I can play together.
---
Survivor: Daryl Dixon
---
Perk 1: Slurpees in Hell - Grants the ability, after unhooking a Survivor, to heal one state, once per match, when cleansing a dull totem. Hex totems do not apply. 
---
Perk 2: Last One Alive - Gain a token for each generator completed. If you're the last survivor, the ability kicks in. Each token grants 5/10/20% increase in recovery, healing, and action speed. 
---
Perk 3: A Way Out - Once hatch is open, with each hit by the killer, the hatch's aura will be shown for 1/1.5/2 seconds.
---
Survivor: Morgan Jones
---
Perk 1: Clear - When hit by the killer, you are granted with Haste for 3/4/6 seconds. If healed within 30/20/10 seconds, Morgan will not clear you, the healing survivor will be dropped to injured state. 
---
Perk 2: I Don't Die - Grants the ability to recover from dying state, or get off the hook. Once per match, one only. If you rescue a survivior, before you are hit. 
---
Perk 3: Akimbo - Grants the ability to stun the killer if done correctly. When being hit, press Active Ability to roll and dodge the attack. If not timed correctly, you will take the hit. 
---
Killer: Winslow
---
Power 1: Once per match can call a herd of 4 zombies to roam the map for 60 seconds. They will chase a survivor, and if caught will grab and notify then killer. (The survivor will kick them off within 1 second and that zombie will die into the ground)
---
Power 2: Using the Power button causes Winslow to irradicatly charge, taking down whatever he hits. He will only stop when hitting a solid force. Thus, downing multiple survivors is possible. 
---
Attributes: 4.4m/s, 25m, Size: Big, Wide. 
---
Perk 1: Where do we go? -  If a survivor is hooked while the gates are open, zombies will guard the exit for 20/30/60 seconds. 
---
Perk 2: Hex: Rough Skin - When touched by a survivor, they will go into injured state. Active until totem is cleansed
---
Perk 3: Feast - Each time you hit a survivor, all other survivors see your aura for 5/3/2 seconds. Grants the ability to kill a survivor, by your hand, who has been hooked twice.
---
Ass expected :(
---
as a rank 9, i use noed and can catch up to survivors and down them. if they use adrenaline and are healed it wont matter as long as you hit them. that being said some survivors will 360 or loop or just be better at chases than you and you just have to accept that. you cant get a 4k every time, and you cant survive every time either. i think adrenaline is useless anyways, i prefer self care or a med kid and you can just heal yourself. the odds of being injured in a chase while the last gen is popped is just too slim for me to consider it to powerful. and the sprint burst it gives you only puts some distance between you, but with the increase in base speed you get with noed is enough to close the gap again
---
I dont think he can pick you up if you go in some corners they cant
---
That’s just Mea on the left
---
I meant pip
---
Well most Killers always wanted a side objective for Survivors to stop gen rushing, so if the perk becomes popular at least it’ll supposably gives Killers more time.
---
Faster than walking if level 3
---
He can, he also did... then he dropped me, picked me up again... then dropped me and left me again.
---
Watch streamers like scottjund and zubatlel.   They get 4ks constantly and don’t run run NOED unless it’s a meme stream. No ruin for nurse/billy either.
---
I love the idea of a support perk where you can pick up other Survivors and move them to a safer location. Seems like a spectacular perk for helping other Survivors counter sluggers, and it has a solid counter perk in Deerstalker. I also feel like the other two perks would be pretty solid, though I feel like Humdinger would be better balanced if the advantages only activated by stunning the Killer.
---
Can we stop perks that trump other perks/mechanics. It’s so dumb.
---
Bring diversion with you, people like that, or people that dont let me heal them, get pebbles tossed their way, all fucking game
---
DA LEGION
---
I'm not the OP and you must be lazy as fuck if you think submitting a ticket to ban filth is a waste of time. 
---
Do you want this to happen to you again OP?  Teach her a lesson also submit her name into shitty killer ban list.
---
Yes, ghost face is a small purse of beads
---
Same as walking at tier 3 (100% movement speed)
---
Wouldn’t recommend the perk though, but that’s my opinion
---
Is that the koichi pose?
---
Aggrieving the player as in wasting their time/bulling them like trapping someone in a corner till they DC. Killing them isn't bullying. The killer is blocking the box as a strategy, not grievance. A pretty shitty strategy, but still a strategy.
---
You ever heard of the NOED and Bloodwarden special? I’d suggest that, very fun.
---
Mindbreaker is like Unbreakable, when the circumstances align for you to use it, it can be strong, but it's unlikely, and definitely not worth a perk slot. I like the way they're thinking though, I love status effect perks.
---
Ok
---
Assholes like you are what make this game toxic. Green key is op enough without add ons. Fuck you
---
Hey I don't make the rules here
---
If you do SWF have the one that rescues you use borrowed time that way you stand a chance verse being tunneled as well. Not sure what other perks would be good. Dead hard? What do you game on?
---
You have a speed burst for like 5 seconds.... You also still need to open the gate. You also have 1 less perk to help you even get to end game in the first place.
---
Yes, love your work.
---
I think I got skilled huntress which took me by complete surprise since I'm on console
---
Perk name: What’re you doin in me swamp
---
Moonlight spotlight ugh
---
I got it in like a week bro🗿
---
Keep telling yourself that so when others report you for doing this at least you won't lose a sleep over it.
---
How do you have any perks if you're level 52 and have saved all this BP? Lol
---
If you let him/her go then he will probably do a gen. If you keep chasing that survivor, how is he supposed to do anything else than looping
---
The Clown and the Doctor.
---
Even when things don't go their way, they just keep on laughing.
---
*groovy*
---
Lol @ the perks.
---
Not me, i've noticed a lot of bitter disconnecting
---
Nurse has the most SIMPLIFIED counter play. It's called "Hiding and not getting spotted so she can kill you". Why the fuck do you think she has strider and nurses callin? She moves as fast as a snail, so bring streetwise and crouch around a fucking barrel instead of running away because you cant stop holding sprint.
---
I agree. 
---
And the 'grain of salt' thing holds true for all killers - If you're going against someone that plays that killer a lot, they're going to know what people do to counter them, and likely have a plan for it. Most plague mains know what to do against non-cleansers, so just make sure you're prepared for that.
---
This game really is a game of Chess when it comes to that kinda stuff, and I feel like anyone looking for advice should consider all of the above. Hope this all helped OP :D
---
Or Chicken McDo
---
Thank you so much, I wasn't aware of... Either of those things.
---
Shocker, no NOED
---
I mean..... I am not talking about someone's ass. Therefore it didn't need to be fixed. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Thanks for trying to help.... I guess.
---
Face camp then mori him.
---
I lobby Dodge swfs as a solo survivor the shittiest teammates in dbd
---
Right. Did this guy not realize that you can just do the point animation to stop someone from healing you if you don’t want it.. point and leave, dummy!
---
Actually I did all the unhookings, gens and healing. I played as good as I could and I  made 1 mistake that caused me to get hooked. At that point I undersood that they basically used me to get BP...
---
Yea that a big big dude.
---
I run DS all the time now, since ghostface came out. Since then most killers have been tunnel happy and I almost end up using it every match. Weird how this game has taken a hard shift into tunneling killers left and right. I play on PS4 and mostly solo random and when I play killer I see allot of people all having DS equipped post game. I don’t tunnel or camp as a rule unless it’s that one special toxic survivor.
---
Honestly if you only care about kills as a killer, then you should have already realised you waste more time camping and get less kills in a game because of it
---
Not even this Reddit is safe from JOJO and I love it.
---
Looks like dreams
---
i think i shat my pants for you
---
It's also Unlikely for someone to provide an actual good debate on why is he isn't besides the simple explanation "His power doesn't help in the chase." when it does with the proper add-ons! Play the killer with the build i've suggested, and come back and talk to me. Take notes on what works while your playing the build, and i'll explain something on why it didn't work or so on. I'm not here to be mean, but c'mon your not even giving me a chance, just try it then come talk to me, and we can debate.
---
Neas a killer jokes have the same comedic value as a rock.
---
Maybe survivors getting better and killers generally staying the same? Idk, been playing survivor for achievements recently, feels like a lot of my matches recently have been ending with 3 of us escaping cause gens get done so damn quickly, though I am like, a lower rank on pc for survivor since i play killer on pc so that might be why the killers are generally too bad for that to be an accurate theory, it's just a thought though.

Legion is in dire need of a *proper* rework, the last one was essentially a bandaid fix to stop moonwalking/looking down. As it stands deep wounds are a complete joke, adding no real threat or tension to the game, and Feral frenzy is little more than a first hit tool and becomes useless when survivors are injured, from there on legion is just a basic M1 killer
---
Does no one else remember the weird ass way he was released? He legit just fucking came out, i was playing and saw the notification and was just like "Lmao wha"
---
Sounds like its time to play selfish
---
I've only encountered Freddy once (and played as him once) and I had no idea what I was doing. Would you be willing to explain what to do?
---
Wtf why? What if I want to make new friends XD!
---
Thanks for the advice, I'll think about that next time I get SWF in the lobby
---
Can't tell if this is an insult but if it isn't I actually did ask all of my friends who play dbd they said don't do it often but it's fine if you got frustrated and did it once
---
that's when you lure the killer right to them
---
I saw that a lot yesterday for some reason. 
---
Had 3 killer dailies. 2 out of my 3 games someone DC'd on their first down. Doesn't happen in my survivor games though. 
---
Granted, my killer is rank 13ish so it's potato city over there :/ I didn't touch killer for 2 rank resets and had to work my way down the ranks... Felt dirty. I did use that time to play killers I'm terrible with though. But.... One of those is Legion and umm... Yeah people still don't like legion apparently.
---
I am usually a 3 man swf. We always help the random. Sometimes even if it means our death. I hope you have better luck
---
Wtf kind of question is this?
---
i mean, he just unhooked another person so i went to the other hook to get into a chase he got the person off, but the person who got off wasnt very bright, they ran into me so i smack em and put them on hook, if i see a survivor im not just gunna let them go free to work on a gen im going to chase them. unless im carring another survivor then ill try to smack them once, and keep walking towards the hook. Then again, im on xbox so, toxicity is very low, since Xbox doesnt like bad words.
---
That's Trapper
---
Key out and you'll never have to deal with NOED :^)
---
Yes, go waste time and effort, go through the terrible player report system, forced to take screenshots, video evidence, even when this isn't bannable. And no shit you're not the OP what do you think I am, a 12 year old?
---
Okay, how about this, then. Provide me evidence that this is bannable. Is it in the site rules? In-game rules?
---
I havent once told anyone what to think. I stated my opinion.
---
Thanks man, appreciate that there are actually some good players out there
---
Seriously lmao 
---
OP? we don't know her.
---
There are killer players that play red rank and almost never not kill 3-4 survivors. The statistics say the worst average kill rate of a killer character at rank 1 is more than 50%. Yet it is impossibly hard and you can never improve and always get "bullied". Weird, that. Maybe a "you" kind of thing?...
---
Do you want me to link streams of killers that barely ever lose and win most of their red rank games easily? You might learn a thing or two.
---
He's just guessing cross platform is coming, no one has confirmed that at all.
---
Though it could be a valid theory, it might be coming, which might be whykeyboard and mouse support SEEMS like it's being worked on for console considering keyboard works but mouse does not function yet. Cross play would be pretty damn good for the game though.
---
(other then clown bc he is just a fat funny boi)
---
I picture Nea having the Lisbeth Salendar (sp?) vibe more.
---
And my opinion is that calling someone a tunneler isn't bad
---
I think there was a bug where if there were luck offerings it messed up deliverance (increasing love chance above 100%). Not sure if this was your case.
---
Survivors are just skins anyway, you can always completely ignore his perks
---
On pc I have noticed a lot more campers before the ptb. On PS4 it has been the opposite,  surprisingly.  There will be a couple here and there but mostly really fair killers lately.  It has been really nice.
---
Party hard, killers
---
Just a bad run.  It's been hit or miss since launch for me.
---
I’m starting the learn that the more I go out of my way to help people (especially people hooked at end game) the more likely they are to send hateful messages afterwards if they don’t make it out. Honestly makes me want to just cut and run every chance I get if I’m playing solo now because god forbid my attempts to save them fail. What happened to being grateful that someone even cared to try?
---
Also I think Daryl Second Perk should be called  like Lonely survivor but of course it's you who decides that
---
Yeah like imagine you are repairing a Gen and TWD music starts and from far away you see a big spike metal ball charging at you hahah
---
I think this killer would be awesome to have in the game it would feel like playing Trapper and Billy at the same time and he would be similar to my main killer Piggy still too bad we won't get anymore license killers :/

Guys probably salty about getting bodied in some recent games. Most likely explanation.
