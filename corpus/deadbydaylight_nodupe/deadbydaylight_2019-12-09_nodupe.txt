Not unless you make head on 1000. Its 300 right now
---
---
---
Just wish they weren't getting so much credit for something they didn't make
---
They also updated kindred this patch and while having the perk equipped, you will see your teammates when someone else gets hooked. This is extremely useful information since you can tell whether or not another survivor is going for the hooked person.
---
If by ‚Äòlargely disliked‚Äô you mean disliked by six people, then yeah I suppose so. I‚Äôve literally had more dislikes than this by saying I‚Äôve DCed because I was tunneled once. The only people who seemed upset by what I said are people who seem to like Steven Crowder or people who live in an alternate reality. 
---

---
I ignored what you said because you‚Äôre just saying the same thing over and over again, but each time you‚Äôre trying to say it differently so it sounds like you‚Äôre making a different point when you‚Äôre actually just saying the exact same thing, that you get angry I said something you didn‚Äôt like, and that I shouldn‚Äôt have said it, and that when I told people they shouldn‚Äôt act so sensitive because I called out someone they liked, I shouldn‚Äôt have done that either, so in reality I‚Äôm the big meanie and why would I hurt everyone‚Äôs feelings. This is literally a post about Steven Crowder compared to Ash, while they were talking about appearances, I applied personalities. If you don‚Äôt like it, tough titties, get over it.
---
Just want to point out that a 2v1 SHOULD be killer sided. They worked hard to get there and get 2 kills.
---
literally reddit
---
Cool idea, but I'm personally more excited about the asymmetrical predator game coming out soon. Hunting Grounds I think?
---
Lol try hand strength exercises
---
Same, on PS4. Super annoying as it happens frequently.
---
No he just suckin in his gut
---
I once run behind a Claudette as Hag and literally 5 full body hits didn't connect. But I got that sweet auto aim animation everytime, slowing me down a little bit. Damn
---

WAZZZZZAAAAAAPPPPP
---
All I play against is Ghostface. Spine chill is a must in red ranked ps4.
---
He didn‚Äôt know you can turn it off
---
They should sell survivor ornaments in their merch shop
---
Yeh you stand up for yourself you got this
---
My two accounts have different settings but if you go to settings you look for image attribution and turn it off

My idea was to make their power a ‚Äúchase type‚Äù instead of a ‚Äúslow the game down and be gen rushed anyway‚Äù. This would make legion more enjoyable to play as and against and making them have a powerful power while also giving survivors counter play. I also tried to change their ‚Äúmix tape‚Äù add-ons. My ideas were to make them a unique gameplay style add-on, giving up sides and down sides. For their other add-ons I‚Äôm not sure. Maybe some minor buffs such as faster passive power regeneration, extra speed while vaulting windows and pallets etc. I spent a lot of time doing this so please share your opinions!
---
To clarify some stuff: 
---
Yes, you will be able to down players while in frenzy mode
---
No, atacks will not apply the deep wound status effects without the help of an add-on
---
I understand how you feel
---
i spat out my drink even though i heard the grass rustle... fml
---
St0p
---
&gt;Just want to point out that a 2v1 SHOULD be killer sided. They worked hard to get there and get 2 kills.
---
Or he camped the other two to death. This argument is not the best one.
---
You‚Äôre justifications are illogical and you are also making the same points over and over again. You‚Äôre too unintelligent to talk to anymore.
---
The killer have to do more things that the survivors
---
I would be able to live with that yeah.
---
Yea kindred is super good now for solo
---
Yes but with two skillchecks that each add 5%, making 25%.
---
I like how this relates to the legion's trailer!
---
That sounds cool tbh iv not seen anything about it üòÇ might have to see what it's about just thought predator would be a crazy killer chasing ye around the map
---
yes i did, saw that lag. i just decided to take the title literally instead of sarcastically. just want to keep driving home the point that this game is not a 1v1 like a few people would like to think.
---
Good idea, but I would like to know that exact timings. 
---
And what does the "Every bonus speed will be locked and won't disappear until the power gauge has fully depleted" part mean? So I can gain BL3 or PWYF 3 stacks and run at extremely fast speed? 
---
It sounds good actually, he can still be juked in his power and has some kind of counterplay: the power takes a lot of time to be gained. At cost of that, Legion's power becomes lethal and useful.
---
That would be extremely useless.
---
I can't even afford to dodge lobbies as survivor anyway since it takes 5-8 minutes just to find a killer. I do miss not being able to show off my prestige though.
---
From what I heard about his stream, he was DCing, missing skill checks, and even went as far as to accuse a killer of hacking. Not the type of toxicity we need in the community. There'll be a lot more "GG ez baby killer" and flashlight flickering and tea bagging if his 12 year old fans actually buy this game.
---
God, I am so excited for the wave of toxic 12 year olds that are gonna buy this game. Thanks Ninja!
---
Welp, its been an honor playing with you folks.
---
Nice!
---
Looped a killer for at least 5 minutes (got caught because of probably lag switch since he used the Force to hit me both times) and nobody ended up coming to get me.
---
Just look at your original comment. You sound like an upset person with some very strong opinions which is just kinda cringe.
---
And so we continue trying to strip away everything the killer does to win. 
---
You talk about removing it because it‚Äôs not fun for you.
---
Hatches aren‚Äôt fun for the killer, and the reason why they slug in the 2v1. So remove hatches and killers no longer have a reason to slug during a 2v1!
---
Plus, you solve the issue of unfun for both killers and yourself.
---
No more hatches! Perfect!
---
Yep. Thought something was off, this affects medkits too. Charges dont add up
---
Surmise mothafucker
---
I agree, I actually dont like badham and hate going there now bc I am on it more than any other map. They should have only made 2 variations, we dont need 5
---
Congrats, but why the self promo? There's been a lot of people self promoting on the subreddit since it apparently isn't bannable.
---
&gt; The Spirit is just a much better Nurse 
---
Just bc you think a killer is harder to learn doesn't make her worse.
---
the problem with nurse is she is just too powerful to the point people that learn her just win 90% of all matches they play which is really fucking boring at this point I am flat out all for removing nurses completely.  
---
Bc she is broken OP and nobody likes her
---
What.
---
Except he and his fan base are horrible and he was reportedly toxic on stream already
---
Outstanding move.
---
Fucking
---
We all got out. I got hooked once. I guess I'll delete since I cut that out of the photo by accident.
---
We wouldn't all have more points than the killer if we were killed, so hopefully that's enough proof for you.
---
The instant ban makes it sound like you were unfortunate enough to be playing with Angrypug, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it was someone else too.
---
Edit: my b didn‚Äôt see the other comment. RIP.
---
Put your friend list in public a lot of killers try of see that if is in private they asume you are playing swf
---
Thanks so much :3
---
&gt;what does the "Every bonus speed will be locked and won't disappear until the power gauge has fully depleted" part mean?
---
you gain a 5% speed bonus every 20%. Lets say that your power gauge is in 50% (you will have a 10% speed bonus). When you activate the power gauge will start going down. However, even if the power gauge reaches, for exemple 10%, you will keep the 10% speed bonus until the end of the frenzy mode.
---
For the exact duration number i'm not sure, but i would suggest that 50%/60% is the duration that we have now.
---
Also thank you for liking it!
---
If only I had a dick as big as yours...
---
I've never understood why adrenaline is considered S tier. It's a win more perk.
---
3 minutes into the video and it's already ruining my opinion of the game by proxy.
---
Says the person who called me a psychopath then admitted that they were defensive after they called me out. Are you sure you want to keep engaging? I encourage it, you just keep digging the hole deeper for yourself, and it‚Äôs funny to see how you think people with opinions are cringe. 
---
Seriously though, I love this. You‚Äôre really not self aware at all and every time you reply I smile wondering what you‚Äôll come up with next.
---
Bloodhound *makes blood easier to see*
---
The community "no"
---
How is DS sweaty? It's there to protect you when the killer is a tunnelling prick
---
iDubbbz: "That's quite big."
---
Thank you :) in all honesty I'm just so chuffed I wanted people to see the game that got me there. I very rarely post to reddit. I'd hate to be someone who posts every day just with links. 
---
If its frowned upon then I'll probably just remove the post, I don't want to annoy people if it's really bothers peeps
---
Yeah idk why they made this dumb update. Its increasingly getting more and more frustrating
---
I played against a Legion running Dark Devotion before the last update, he was terrifying. It was such a nasty combo to run!
---
Oh, okay, thanks for clarifying.
---
Yup and if that doesnt have a fix yet why did they even make this dumb update? Literally in the sea of rank 15-18. I can‚Äôt even pip since they can‚Äôt hold their weight in the game and I have to either loop for good 3-4 mins and die on first hook or just wait it out for hatches towards the end
---
Add-ons shouldn‚Äôt stack on any killer, that‚Äôs my thought on balancing.
---
Baby Megs run past the hatch, because they're too busy freaking out to listen for it.
---
And then they wiggle out 5 times while you try to bring them to it and run away before you get tired of trying to be nice and just hook them.
---
You're still a little bitch if you use noed
---
My experience is very different to yours, and I'm around rank 5-6... :/
---
I've been playing all day (Europe servers) and times have been anywhere from 2-10 mins. Was worse for the last 2-3 hours but then we were in a 4 stack SWF
---
Adrenaline, DS, Self Care/Fixated and Lithe/Bond for survivor
---
Hex Ruin, BBQ, STBFL and Discordance/Nurses Calling
---
I havent noticed any worse times being rank 1/2 as per when I was 5
---
How to play ghostface: hook a survivor, lean with night shroud and stare at the hook, can't get broken out cause broken boxes, get a one shot. Rinse and repeat. Atleast that's how idiots play him on xbox.
---
Also if your teammates are low life idiots who thinks it's ok to say you when the scary man with a knife is behind them, ds will say you when you can't save yourself otherwise.
---
You just need to hit Survivors that are sleeping. It‚Äôs one of the easier Daily Challenges nowadays.
---
(Sips) Full bodied pain and suffering with hints of searing acidic burns, bilious eldritch excretions that mar not just the flesh but the very souls of mortal men, aaaaand... (takes another sip, smacks lips) apple?
---
Assuming it wasn't lag and he teleported, he just came from where she wasn't looking and jumped into the animation
---
Ok, so I understand that he's new and doesn't know the game inside and out, but this is what I've noticed watching the video:
---
1) Styptic and Syringe on the same medkit.
---
2) 100% Saboing hooks  with the Killer being nowhere near him.
---
3) Took self-care (Specifically took Claudette because he wanted that perk)
---
4) Pre-threw pallets without looping a single time.
---
All of this would be completely understandable due to being new at the game, but his attitude against the Myers ("Get fucked, idiot!") is extremely concerning if his fans show up.
---
To be fair to him, other than saying the Trapper was trolling he was complimenting the Trapper on having traps all over the place ("He's a god!")
---
Thanks! Just recent got murdered by one.
---
&gt;solo
---
&gt;with a friend
---
and on pc, just alt+f4, or task manager. Or if you wish to avoid punishment for dc in future (all platform, and live alone / only you need internet), just pull the plug on your wifi.
---
Just had it happen, too.
---
So you want him to take NoED off when he queues up and he's allowed to put it back on when he finds a game?
---
Pretty sure Jess had already played Dead by Daylight prior.
---
The purpose of your comment?
---
Raise your hand if BHVR gave you carpal tunnel
---
Uh, works almost exactly the same except not as OP and easier to learn sounds like a straight upgrade to me
---
It's closer to Pig's crouch
---
It's not as simple as it sounds.  I've completed a game where the Survivors have gotten a single gen, I killed all 4 with no gens/trapdoors being touched.  Challenge did not complete.
---
I also got to rank 1 survivor for the first time today, and I‚Äôve got over 500 hours!
---
*me running straight into the killers arms*
---
I don't get how he hasn't been nerfed. He can just get a insta down by running around randomly and hoping someone walks in his path
---
Same with myers he can just straight up mori you without even hooking you but yet he is also seen as fine
---
Dream Chaser is hitting someone who is already in Dream. 
---
Survivors start awake and fall into Dream naturally (The timer on their name changes to indicate they are asleep), or when you hit them. There are also add-ons that start Survivors in Dream, or prevent them from waking up.
---
Basically, if they are affected by your Snares, hitting them gives you the Dream Chaser score event.
---
Self-care is actually pretty good between ranks 10-20 because no one bloody heals you ever.
---
DED 'ARD
---
Found it
---
Wow, the meme has been up for 2m and people are already poking holes
---
Really living up to your username there
---
Congrats!!! :D I'm glad to share my rank 1 day with you xD
---
I've seen a handful of memes with Myers in the background. Is he just photoshopped in or did I miss something?
---
Thanks for the info. As long as it's not worse.
---
He's extremely loud.
---
I don't think that would be important as it is if the most played Killer right now wasn't SPirit.
---
I need old Ochido and Ninja in the same game together now.
---
Yeah but when I was stuck on the gen and my friend walked in front of me, I hit them and it actually registered that it hit, and then I teleported across the map to where i apparently had moved too.
---

---
Couldn‚Äôt we have gotten cr1tikal or someone who doesn‚Äôt have the fan base full of 8 year olds to play dbd
---
Remember when killers didn‚Äôt de-pip getting a 4k? Yeah, neither do I.
---
Glad it ain't just me. Feels like the ghostfaces camp more than the bubbas do on xbox.
---
*he brought 2 insta heal addons and never used them* that says it all
---
Garbage Day!
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just on console. I‚Äôm on PC and it‚Äôs just as bad.
---
If you think trying to cleanse bones to stop a potential NOED play is ‚Äúwasting time‚Äù then you must not be worried about NOED.
---
Elementary.
---
Not really.  That's all OP can do until something is announced
---
Ash doesn't get enough rep around here. He's a horror hero LEGEND
---
What no?
---
You get 50% of your boldness points with that offering, thats 4.000 since you got 8k boldness.
---
You got 34k in total for that game, 30k normal ingame points +4k for your offering, you are just missing 30k for WGLF.
---
Dunno where your 45k coming from.
---
I believe they recently talked about changing the console settings, specifically sensitivity, in a way that would allow for more control all around. Hopefully it comes soon.
---
If you're running or mending the mending timer doesn't decrease now
---
I doubt you're the ONLY Nea main to use it.
---
How fucking daft is everyone on this sub, honestly?
---
If steve was t-posing this would be perfect.
---
Kindred is super helpful playing solo but I still get left on hook even when the killer isn‚Äôt there. If u have a selfish team ur fucked regardless
---
You're a poopy head ü§£
---
Seeing these memes spammed across here makes me wanna keep running NOED on every killer
---
Both Billy and Myers have very clear counterplay that you can implement and practice over time. You can juke Billy and do other things to play around his chainsaw ability, it just takes practice and a bit of reading your opponent. Getting a random instadown as Billy that you weren‚Äôt already going for is rare and is usually chalked up to a survivor not paying attention to where the chainsaw noise is coming from. If you have trouble with him I‚Äôd recommend looking up guides or videos, they‚Äôve helped me a lot.
---
And yes, while Myers does have an add-on that gives him a mori ability, there are several reasons why it‚Äôs normally excused. For one, those add-ons are Very Rare and Ultra Rare and you don‚Äôt see them often because they both come with their own tradeoffs that make it more challenging for him. Both require you to stalk multiple survivors significantly more before you can activate Tier 3, while survivors still have the exact same amount of Evil they‚Äôd have without those addons, meaning he can‚Äôt enter T3 as often (and you have to stalk even more if you have any of the hair addons, including the infinite T3 one). Tombstone Piece makes it so once he moris, he is stripped of T3 status and has to earn it again. Judith‚Äôs tombstone makes him slower overall, often forcing him to run a specific perk build around his addons.  There are also ways you can keep from getting mori‚Äôd, like hiding in lockers or forcing him to lunge, since he can only mori you if you‚Äôre within basic attack range.
---
You can actually hear him breathing a good 4 seconds before he grabs you (starting at 0:08)
---
GET OUTTA MAH SWAMP!
---
Arcus 142
---
‚ÄúFully immersed‚Äù bro this game runs like an early 2000s game there‚Äôs no immersion. Sounds like an excuse to be toxic
---
Tru3 would like a word with you.
---
Can someone ELI5
---
**no0b3 wants to know your location**
---
I know that but I mean I don‚Äôt use anything else
---
Nevermind all of my math, figured out i was putting in the wrong input of numbers and orders. üòÇ so yeah I actually should've had 68,000 BP. Still would've helped me more.
---
Nah, cause Ninja didn't like the game so therefore none of his viewers will buy it.  I'd take 12 year olds over the toxic 20 something zoomers.
---
I personally enjoy their power. If you use it right, you can distribute a lot of pain rather quickly. It wastes everyone‚Äôs time when they mend, allowing you to get further progress on killing. That‚Äôs only my thoughts though.
---
Leatherface: I‚Äôm here because i‚Äôm a wuss...
---
how are they gonna nerf hillbilly? make him do pit stops for gas? lol
---
Dude, I'm just joking. I dont actually run all that shit lol.
---
That's another problem I see nowadays. People are just too eager to unhook people. Just fucking work on a gen and unhook after sometime. Right before the survivor goes into second phase. There is so much time between getting hooked and getting into second phase. Make use of that time and it also prevents the killer from coming back to the hook because by that time they would have been chasing someone. 
---
I wish everyone played like noob3 and not like tru3. The latter just fucking goes for hook saves right after someone gets hooked. That's not a how smart  survivor should play.
---
To me it was backwater swamp the first 3 times I played
---
üòÇüòÇ that's an infant meg
---
Jane mains unite
---
Same or at least different version?
---
The whole idea of changing it to the way it was now was because killers were getting "bullied" by one high rank survivor, in a team of rank 20's when you can easily just kill their teammates that are new to the game instead of chasing the high rank. But now all new survivors are completely demolished in every game they play with their friends because they're going straight into red ranks.
---
That makes sense. Just like when it's bring your child to work day.  That 3 year old kid should have work a full 8 hour adult job right?
---
We're not daft you're just incredibly tone deaf to whine about anything that could possibly take place in that game.
---
You were curb stomping them bro.  Leave well enough alone man.  The entitlement is real.
---
Once was the not steamboat then the next was boat then not the boat
---
for survivor: usually empathy, decisive strike, borrowed time, and either small game or prove thyself
---
for killer: ruin, bbq, unrelenting, and nurse's
---
Get for a character that you play the most. 
---
I got for Huntress and Billy first. Everything else was just whatever. Ended up getting complete outfit for Wraith and Jake.
---
He was crouching the grass, if his torso and head is concealed too much you wont be able to reveal him even if he‚Äôs obviously visible like this.
---
Ideally you're slugging all the remaining survivors, opening a gate, and hooking one for Bloodwarden.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Additionally if you play a stealth killer (hello Wraith!) you actually wait just outside of LOS near the generator a survivor is working on and nail them with NOED the moment they pop it, open the nearest (hopefully adjacent if you protected the generator closest to the gate) gate, hook them (make sure they're on death hook as other people have mentioned) to proc Bloodwarden.
---
Then go find someone else using the BBQ&amp;C proc and hook them, and if they're not on death hook, have a slug fest of everyone else, or just camp them, w/e.
---
Im with you! A fellow legion main

http://www.mediafire.com/file/1ooe92b3vzj960m/DLC2_DS.rar/file
---
Download the file, if it is the black version go onto r/perkbydaylight and find the knife ds post it will have both white and black versions. Then do a perk icon swap on the game files. May youtubers have vids of it if you don‚Äôt know how. Enjoy the ds, and it hangs out a little, so perk slot three in you loadout on survivor is the best bet. Enjoy.
---
I bet it was annoying
---
i know, I started looking around at that time. half of my mind was figuring that was meg(me) breathing, but i stilled tried to look. the round had just started and i had no clue who the killer was.
---
I got the sets for Claudette and Trapper, it really just depends on who you like to play. :)
---
I agree
---
Now im on my 7th Badham since Im playing today. Im counting them
---
I read something similar to this before and I'll tell you the same thing I told the other guy. They're just being assholes. Move on and play better next game. Don't let them get to you, that's exactly what they want.
---
It varies from game to game. There have been matches where it didn‚Äôt have too much of an impact, but then I‚Äôve actually gotten kills on people who came back for their medkit/toolbox that they didn‚Äôt want to leave behind.
---
Can you explain why thatd be a bad idea?
---
Most people don't understand why they do it, that's why they don't do it. You don't need to understand why they do it to not have it get to you. Exit gate shenanigans are free BP and you can just ignore/disable chat. It really is just a game, I don't know what more you're looking for.
---
It literally is wasting time that could be going towards a genny, all to prevent a perk that rewards bad killers
---
I got Wraith and Jake
---
Nah thats his special thing non-commitment. Hes the only killer rewarded for actually playing 4v1, albeit not that much reward. Hes fun because hes always on the chase
---
You don't need DS to have an obsession and make the killer think someone has DS, Mettle of Man, Object of Obsession, or a key with the addon that lets you see the obsession while channeling will also work nicely.
---
u/DecutorR Eventually I did say fuck it and opened the exit gate but that isn't really the point I was trying to make. It's bullshit that they even tried that in the first place.
---
I'm always very back and forth on this one. If you truly wanted to bridge the gap between SWFs and Solos by as much as possible then I agree that voice chat is a must. However, I have doubts that it would actually be better for the game in the long run. I would hate to listen to someone scream over their mic throwing a temper tantrum because you're taking too long to save them.

They definitely do! Sounds like your bloodweb is glitched for some reason. Perhaps if you buy a new survivor and gain access to their perks that might help fix it? Or I'd consider submitting a support ticket to see if you can get help in any way.
---
he wants to make sure nobody hurts his hook. he loves it
---
i didnt did
---
Weird issue, but yes, every perk goes up to Tier 3.
---
David for them juicy WGLF bloodpoints
---
oh and dead hard i guess
---
u/SammySosaIsBlack I ignore the messages and don't dc but it's really REALLY disheartening and it ruins the opportunity to even do anything when somehow they ALWAYS get away from your hits and when you finally catch them you get flashed and t bagged. It's rarely ever just one survivor. I want to have a normal game.
---
You could mute them.
---
Ngl I would probably still be dead if a killer did this, because the people I q with are fucking pussies.
---
u/ninj1337 Maybe to rant and find someone who agrees with me and could rant with me instead of someone telling me it's just a game.
---
Tried f13 and refunded it an hour later
---
She's bugged right now where she doesn't get a lunge after her ability, along with Wraith. As a Spirit player, she just feels a lot worse, like the Nurse rework. She's still good and decent, it just doesn't feel good playing her.
---
It'd be interesting to see them add a "I give up" option in case of a slug or a glitch, perhaps. Like if you're laying on the floor you have the option to magically find some glass on the ground and end it, or something similar.
---
They also talked about console optimization. I'm sure they just forgot. Right guys?
---
Do you even play killer?
---
Yeah, confident and altruistic survivors are really hard to go against. I'd recommend just taking it as a learning experience. When I first played killer I got absolutely owned. Eventually you'll get better be able to better handle survivors like that.
---
What werent you a fan of?
---
Yeah, turns out it's the previous event cosmetics I had no idea about nor saw in the patch notes haha
---
Haha, fair point.
---
Actually DS lasts about the time it takes to repair a generator with a toolbox, you can get unhooked, sprint burst to the nearest generator, 5-10% to 100% it alone, get caught by the killer and downed, picked up, and then hit them with DS for "tunneling you".
---
Four of these on a team is four generators that the killer cannot meaningfully pressure without getting stunned, I rarely see survivors use DS because they're getting tunneled, but I see hop on generators and then DS a generator patrolling killer quite frequently.
---
I don't think it's healthy for the game to basically hand the survivors four free generators like that, with the only alternative being that the killer slugs them to be picked back up, and can't chase them without someone coming and popping the 95% gen right behind them.
---
Yeah I know I will.. I just think being confident and altruistic is completely different than the shit I see.. People follow me around and fast vault to try to get in a chase with me.
---
This happened 2 me awhile ago. What i did 2 solve it was sadly waiting for a long period of time till I found a game. I started with finding survivor games and eventually was able 2 find killer games .
---
Oh lord.... I T.  H A S.  R I S E N.
---
The whole point of spinechill is to prevent that. You have failed at using the perk.
---
Lmao the Hunger Games
---
I have decisive strike from the shrine and no luck getting it
---
Nah, gotta Mori the survivor next to the hatch ;)

It's honestly annoying how much you get dodged as survivor, it makes the game feel unplayable. In my own experience playing killer it takes no effort to find lobbies while survivor lobbies can take up to 20 minutes to find. Half the time killers don't even have a reason to dodge. Flashlight? Dodged. Any item at all? Dodged. Survivor they 'don't like'? Dodged. Prestige characters? Dodged. Player they sort of remember from an earlier match? Dodge. Survivors with colourful cosmetics? Dodged. You get the point. They can just return to matchmaking and find another full lobby basically instantly and keep dodging until they find the perfect lobby while survivors just get thrown back into the matchmaking void until they find a killer that's not afraid of a tiny bit of resistance from survivors. Maybe not a 10 minute penalty but something like 30 seconds that stacks every time you dodge and resets every day. Survivors are getting DC penalties, killers should get dodge penalties. Simple as that.
---
Then you're going against extremely cocky survivors. Ignore survivors who do that, more often than not they'll loop you around for a good amount of time and completely waste your time.
---
Thanks for your suggestions.
---
Looks good. Keep it up.
---
I played a game recently as legion and didn‚Äôt run CI and don‚Äôt have ruin. Found someone and downed them in like a minute. Also had 3 generators pop in that same period of times. I‚Äôm starting to hate that you have to run shit like ruin or CI to have a chance against some survivors.

Yea you'd have to add a mute function with it. The only thing I'd be worried about then is that it would ruin the general feel of DBD if you could always communicate with your teammates. That might be a stupid "i'm afraid of change!" complaint though so idk.
---
Ranks 16 to 20 are excluded from the matchmaking restriction of "within 6 ranks" in order to get them into a game faster, BHVR thinks that putting them off the game with queue times is worse than putting them off the game by potentially facing rank 1 killers.
---
Matchmaking does try to find people within 6 ranks of you first, on the other hand, before expanding to 16s to 20s.
---
Basically this kind of thing can happen outside of SWF, even though SWF does use the highest ranked player (nominally); of course 4 rank 1s in an SWF can be pitted against a rank 20 killer if matchmaking doesn't find a rank 1 to 7 killer.
---
Only about 5% of the population has hit rank 10 killer on Steam, so you can imagine that red ranks go against green ranks or above a lot.
---
I agree, thanks for more in depth thinking of the matter.
---
They aren't that hard of challenges tbh. And the lore is pretty lame any way so I wouldn't worry about it.
---
Ok. So can you MAYBE see it from my point of view instead of just thinking about how it's just a game or thinking about bloodpoints. It's the disrespect and embarrassment. People are different and it feels like I got embarrassed hardcore in a room full of fifty people when survivors do unnecessary bullshit where it's only purpose is to fuck with me because they know they can.
---
Ok thanks for the suggestion I might try a support ticket.
---
I thought so just wanted to make sure
---
INCREDIBILIS!
---
You have a great art style! Ever thought about visiting neighbouring DBD subreddits as well?
---
It‚Äôs a joke
---
Thank you for the explanation, since I‚Äôm new to DBD I always look at the wiki to understand the memes.
---
Yeah.. What do I do if it's like two, three, or all of them doing it and somehow being fucking professionals?
---
Oh yeah
---
Is this some rank 20 joke I'm too good to understand?
---
It‚Äôs a.. joke
---
A trapper got stuck in a gen and couldn‚Äôt get out. Instead of leaving me and my team teamed up to get him out. Once we succeeded he let us go and escape. But we all helped him farm to make up for the game (stepped into a trap on purpose.) let‚Äôs just say it was the highlight of the week for. (It was also cool because we were a team of Steve‚Äôs and one was very toxic to the trapper up to that point.)
---
It's basically just there as a hard mode. You could potentially do a gen speed build or even a sabo build around it, but it's not worth it imo.
---
Had a match with an afk killer. Got his totem and a gen right next to him. He came back and I hope his reaction to both his totem and a gen being done was priceless.
---
Dude you are paaaaale. 
---
Tattoo looks really nice
---
That's what you call dedication.
---
Unless you are good at loops and mindgames to the point where hitting you is impossible, the con's drown the pros, but thats my thoughts.
---
Just lokk at THAT [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr3\_2Z-g7sk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr3_2Z-g7sk) and THAT  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb30n8mpUk8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb30n8mpUk8) . 2 bugs in a row
---
 *Platform* : PC
---
F13 is fun. I played it for 8 months before getting sick of it
---
Artist is project.oxo on instagram btw. His works are amazing, almost like he's painting with a brush on your skin :D
---
Template please?
---
I doubt you'll get games like that a lot but if you get a game where all 4 survivors are being optimal and they're on a survivor sided map then there's not really much you can do to stop them. Unless you're a god tier Nurse. Just gotta take those games in stride and learn from them. You'll eventually become better.
---
&gt; people should be able to decide what matches they want to play
---
But survivors are expected to suck it up and not DC or suicide when they get put in a bad match? 
---
&gt; encountering someone(or group) that was nasty in a previous match
---
I don't get why you'd dodge that. When I encounter a team that were toxic af last match I put on an ebony mori and put on gen grab spirit or hag with MYC and that teleport addon. They gave me a bad time, I'll give them a bad time lol
---
The whole concept of legion is dumb. And bhvr knew it. They shouldn't have introduce legion tbh. Not with those powers that is. He needs a complete rework, from scratch.
---
Yeah probably only like 6 people play 40k
---
I personally enjoy the first person experience of Parkour. Also it‚Äôs kinda neat how a bunch of teens decided on paper machete masks as their signature look. Then there‚Äôs Joey with the face cloth. After all they are delinquents. When did they decide to get together for arts and crafts?!?
---
Yikes, I remember when the idea of feral frenzy was supposed to make a group of people quickly bleed out and they had choices to make on how to deal with that. Now its just a minor inconvenience that you can deal with later I guess
---
God no. Unless you try to pull a Monto-Esque gen rush, there's no reason to ever use it. I'd say it's a crutch perk, but it isn't. No Mither punches you in the gut, kicks the shit out of you, spits on your mother's grave, throws you in the dumpster, and shouts "know your fucking place, trash!"
---
This deserves hella upvotes GG on creativity.
---
I've literally had 4+ games (and probably more to come) stuck in a damn gen. Honestly super annoying glitch..
---
Alright.. Well thank you for saying something motivating/positive. I'm going to go ahead and delete this post since everyone else is saying that it's not bullying
---
Fuck off, honestly.
---
If I'm a survivor, I try to rush gens and leave and not really play the "killers way." They can kill me if they want
---
As killer, I kill them. 
---
If i wanted to play video games just to farm, I would have played Stardew Valley.
---
But... it's more efficient to maximize bloodpoints points in a short game vs always getting a sweaty 4k.
---
Nah. 
---
That would make it more obnoxious over scary. And you get desensitised once you're used to the environment such a forced change would annoy players over scaring them.
---
They do. Don‚Äôt know what console you‚Äôre using but on PS4 they move fine.
---
Thanks for the response, how long have you played dbd for?
---
It's actually just a hallucination
---
Yeah no problem. You can't influence the behavior of others. All you can control is what YOU do. So don't worry about what survivors are doing to you, just learn from your mistakes and find ways you could've played better. Good luck and try not to let toxic/cocky survivors get to you.
---
About a year. The thing about F13 is that no new content will ever arrive. You get sick of it after a while. But it‚Äôs VERY fun while the game is new
---
I know a way to counter it tho. When you start kicking the gen if it looks like you are inside or closer than usual to the gen stop kicking it and then proceed to kick it again if you have returned to the spot where you are supposed to be when kicking it you won!
---
They'll be in every new bloodweb until you get them.
---
That's a hypothetical situation though. There's no way you'll realistically be able to get unhooked, sprint to a gen, repair it from any % and still be able to get downed by the killer unless you're on a team with x4 toolboxes and prove thyself and you know EXACTLY where the killer is. Even if the killer does find you, if they're at red/purple ranks they'll most likely ignore you out of fear of DS, or slug you for the remaining seconds
---
O p e r a t i o n H e a l t h
---
I feel like it's all but guaranteed that he'll get toned down at some point. As it is, he's just a way better Billy, the need for juicies doesn't really do much when he gets it so fast. And people already thought Billy was op before this killer came out.
---
Out of curiosity how did his endgame potential diminish with the rework? (Or have worse synergy between perks and abilities.) I must be forgetting what he used to be. I just assumed now that his abilities are better early game and his perks are better late game, and that‚Äôs what they wanted.
---
They are really difficult and tedious to me. maybe i just need to chill and just ignore it but it's in my endgame screen taunting me that i haven't done them yet.
---
I thought he was awful to control too until I didnt realize using both sticks made a huge difference. I never played Billy and not sure if it's the same with him. Try using the left and right stick together to control him
---
And wearing the S2 outfit
---
I accidentally brought an Ivory mori into a game and the salt survivors game me was hilarious.
---
Thanks! And yeah, will check some of them out :)
---
Rank 20?
---
Angry?
---
The whole time that Spirit was like, "Bruh wtf you doing?" xD
---
*shivers* oh lawd not again...
---
Oof I didn't even consider that. Yeah that's probably going to be the new rage quit.
---
Not bad for a drawing done in a single queue.
---
Tomes don't have a time limit
---
Would love to have cr1tikal playing, I think he would enjoy the Clown
---
I miss the patch before when you could see Rank/Prestige. It was incredibly useful seeing I was matched with, for example, two level 1 Meg Thomas. I knew I would have to help them, take aggro ect. It seems fair to be able to see the experience of your teammates without checking individual steam profiles
---
Nah... Can't be Billy.. That chainsaw weighs more than the hammer. You can see that he slants slightly towards the left.
---
I'd say Demogorgon is the most balanced. He's the only killer not wielding a weapon (Which would add weight to the left or right side). And since he doesn't have clothes, all his weight is just based on his (most likely) symmetrical body.
---
This makes me think of the perk "fixated"
---
I thought it would be an great counter perk for spirit, moving faster while walking, making more distance without leaving scratch marks.
---
&gt;only works while uninjured
---
Sigh...
---
Tru3 is far from my favorite DBD streamer[that belongs to the wholesome king himself: Otz], but I do respect that Tru3 has valid things to bring to the table usually, certainly more than Ardetha and Tydetime. Tru3 was one of the first to cry that Nurse was gonna be neutered, but quickly turned around and acknowledged that she was still VERY strong after playing the PTB with her changes. I respect Tru3 for owning up to that.
---
I agree, BUT the change to make perks like STBFL and Sloppy not work on frenzy hits was
---
unnecessary.
---
Summarise mothafucker
---
Of course not! As a killer main, I can confirm that there's 5 sub-categories of Neas. 1.) Normal Nea. Just one of the plain, default outfits. Whether it be just the default jeans and tank top, or the black leggings and flannel, this Nea is just like any other survivor. 2.) Zebra Leggings Nea. Zebra Leggings Nea is another common Nea type. They're a Nea mainx for sure, but not a toxic Nea main. They use Balanced Landing and Urban Evasion 90% of the time because they're used to it. 3.) Green Hair Nea. Green Hair Neas are Neas who, well, use the outfit that has green hair. They're typically the most chill Nea variant. Sure, they sometimes give one or two teabags, but it's all in good fun. There's nothing toxic about them, they're just messing around. 4.) P3 Hat Only Nea. This very rare variant of Nea is upper mid tier on the toxicity scale. They're good at looping, but that's about it. They only hop on gens for like 6-14 seconds at a time. 5.) Pink Haired Fuckwits. The Pink Haired Fuckwits are the most god forsaken members of the fucking community. If you're a Pink Haired Fuckwit, please know that you're a Fuckwit. Pink Haired Fuckwits are the most toxic and obnoxious teabagging flashlight dancers in the community. Every pallet, every loop, every jump, fucking everywhere, they teabag and click their flashlights like a fucking prick. God, they're awful. This is the worst member of the community. I'd rather play against an Insidious Bubba than a Pink Haired Fuckwit. Their perks are made up entirely of crutches. Dead Hard, Adrenaline, you get the idea. So, if you even think of getting annoued and tunneling the shit out of them to teach them a fucking lesson, you're in for a really bad time.
---
I do love it when video game logos are just ambiguous enough that they look good as tats.
---
Low tier killer, no ruin, what I assume is a 4-man swf, survivor sided map.
---
This isn't a gen problem, it's a shitty map design and low tier killer problem. Gens are fine, buff low-tier killers. Nerfing gen speed is just a bandaid fix that'll make an already boring objective even worse.
---
Damocles
---
I dont know why I had such a hard time reading that lmao
---
Lol solo survivor is not that hard. You do a gen, save your team, get chased, and even if you die, you can still rank up. As killer, you have to keep up with 4 other people and hook them several times to rank up.
---
No one thinks you're cool or funny for any of this. So, again, fuck off. No one cares.
---
Yeah love getting 10fps on the new map
---
Please enlighten me of this man
---
Well ya have proof they reported you for bs reasons
---
Yes! Exactly! Or since the game is bugged and we often don‚Äôt get matched with our ranks, I can use that information to dodge lobbies. Its just so dumb that the creators of the game randomly heads towards dumb directions. This has to be one of the worst by far since today‚Äôs games hVe mostly been ruined for me. I‚Äôm down to rank 11 from 9 with the help of useless lvl 15-18s
---
I‚Äôm kindred ds dead hard and dark sense guy
---
he saw me when he was killing the last person and chased me. He didnt look for hatch or anything, but instead when the chase was over he tried taking me to a hook, but when he saw i wasnt wiggling he went to his nearest trap to get me in.
---
As a killer, I only 4k slug if the survivors literally did no gens (I don't use Ruin). I'm sorry but I prefer the old way where you had to do at least 2 gens for the hatch to spawn. 
---
If a Blendette did 0 gens and literally urban evaded the whole match that outta not equal a free escape
---
Lobbies take too long already, this made it take so much longer
---
You would think that but these ppl get slugged and or hide around the whole game. Then if anyone gets hooked, they continue to hide while I‚Äôm taking agro across the map. Then when I get caught finally, its too late to realize no gens are done and I wont be saved. 
---
Also I don‚Äôt have borrowed time sadly üòÖ. Never thought to lvl Bill but now that I need jr so much, I might level him up next to save my life.
---
Sure. Let's listen to people blasting music, screaming at each other, saying inappropriate things over chat, or screaming babies.
---
Keep the unbalanced, save the eardrums. 
---
No.
---
Thank you.
---
Well comrades it's been a good run * **throws Xbox one in a dumpster** *
---
People need to stop asking for Pennywise to be in the game tbh. Not because we already have a clown, but because lorewise, Pennywise is stronger than the entity in this game. It wouldn't make much sense to have Pennywise as just a killer in this game unless he was brought in as a being that encroaching on the entity's territory, which is honestly how most of the licensed killers should have been handled, especially Freddy who wouldn't bow to anyone.
---
The emoji makes it so perfect Lmao
---
I do and I am rank 1 playing him but it‚Äôs just annoying that survivors can fuck with you so much more than on PC. You can‚Äôt use the power that much at loops and cutting corners messes him up when you can still get downs with it on PC. We literally just need a higher sensitivity I think... they need to do something
---
Memes get lazier and lazier
---
This as in dodging lobbies? I mean man if they matched survivors with same ranks, no one would be dodging ranks. But here I am, almost 40 games in b/w today and tomorrow and I depiped enough to derank 2ice aince no gens are done and nothing is solved. 
---
I guess their ranking system is busted again like it was 2 months ago
---
Well thats exactly what i mean. I feel like if there wasnt a lawsuit and they could do the roadmap that they created then i would just play f13
---
Reddit circlejerk at it again. It's an opinion. He thinks it's funny I don't understand how you could use a perk like spinechill to fuck yourself over
---
It's not a bug it's a "Feature".
---
Sprint burst meg is back. Pretty good job so far
---
Ok boomer
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an opinion‚Äù this is a fucking meme, it‚Äôs literally tagged as a shitpost
---
Nobody cares bud
---
Like I said above, I've heard the Dev's say they want to remove instant heals, I cannot source it, but Adrenaline and curing yourself at a Pool of Devotion are the only instant heals left in the game.
---
Plus you said above that the only nerf you think Adrenaline needs is to prevent Haste while Exhausted, which this balancing also does.
---
He is correct, they won't show up again until you unlock his teachables.
---
That‚Äôs pretty much what I‚Äôve done. Try to be a distraction and then just go for the generator to at least try.
---
2 weeks
---
I like how they say "it's a bug" as if that makes it okay to do.
---
It's because Bill was only recently added to console and before that, his perks were just general survivor perks. Now if you didn't already have them on a certain survivor, you have to unlock the teachables first.
---
It's even worse if you don't want to get the bias that swamps the game, and want to play a balance between each 'side'.
---
Awesome, I‚Äôll be on winter break then so plenty of time to play her.
---
Please use this format
---
Platform: PS4
---
Killer main: Pig, Huntress, Myers 
---
Survivor main: Claudette
---
Killer rank: 1
---
Survivor rank: 1 (or 2, can't remember)
---
Your opinion: Not overpowered, but gives way too little information and lacks any counterplay, sort of like old legion. Also, this topic is getting annoying. Give spirit counterplay, not nerfs.
---
Console player here so I might not be much help if you're PC, but when going into a demon strike from the Dash just move the camera because you'll have momentum carrying you forward. If it's just a normal demonstrike, you have to do a combo of both the character and camera
---
Somewhat new player here who plays killer very rarely. I hate going against Legion, can someone explain to me why I shouldn't?
---
Yes and I simply don't find it funny, and much like redditors will say "this" or "have an upvote" I have stated I don't find it funny, no reason to get super upset.
---
As much as maps help survivors out. Playing mid to top tier killer is easy enough. - me a bottom tier legion main
---
I mean, I lose because I don‚Äôt feel like running around or camping forever. That‚Äôs not exactly good gameplay.
---
I know how to fix that: run dbd on a SSD. At least this fixed it for me. I had it on a HDD and since the latest few updates I had the same issue. Now I can play normally again
---
if you look you‚Äôll see they only have 1 survivor, none dead or DCed so it‚Äôs KYF and they used a bug to have 2 killers
---
Nice Jesus ornament right there
---
Personally, the only thing I find it good against is other survivors who aren't paying attention. As long a survivor is alert, it doesnt really help much imo.
---
I guess maybe. OP isn‚Äôt telling us the whole story, could be really toxic or something. We‚Äôll never know
---
I literally just got stuck in a generator THREE times in one game...
---
I did what you said and stopped not even a quarter of a way kicking the gen and still got stuck, twice.
---
Sigh
---
I love this game but this is beyond tilting
---
Yea, but when there is one left they will often just camp it.
---
My main problem is the game can last forever it seems when everyone starts camping when there is one generator left 2 survivors.
---
Those teammates are probably on deathhook since youre the one doing the unhooking the whole time
---
Thank you for the tip! I‚Äôm on console as well and I‚Äôm going to practice in a custom game.
---
From BHVR's AMA less than a month ago:
---
&gt; *How high is the possibility that you'll skip a chapter in order to improve the game's health?*
---
&gt; "Very low.
---
&gt; Creating new content is always going to be something we are striving for, but to answer your question, we do want to skip something to allow resources to be put on improving game health.
---
&gt; We recently announced that we will put our events on hold for the time being to concentrate on game health. Players might think events are small additions to the game but for a team of our size, events take a lot of resources to pull off and sometimes even adds more issues to fix. This is why we want to pull resources from events to put them on improving game health." - not_Queen
---
The fuck is this? A dead cockroach?
---
Yeah! Even if I stop liking dbd, the tattoo looks amazing, no regrets at all :D
---
no it was on Goose's stream so i'm sure multiple people clipped it and posted it
---
also why do i have to give the trapper a tome challenge when he should work for it? I have a challenge to escape, so should i just hate on the killer for trying to win?
---
Oh really? Nice to know
---
Yea, sucks when u have to play spirit every game to even secure a kill or 2:( im rank 7 and game after game its red rank swf. Cant even have fun anymore like i used to. Cant fuck around anymore like I used to. Seriously just considering never playing killer again and just becoming a survivor main. Yes i know this is off topic but im rlly salty as u can tell
---
Ahh, that's pretty cool. Does it work if you still have more than one survivor? Could you do 2 v 3?
---
No problem mate. Cheers
---
Oh, I didn't know that. Mobile must be heaps different then other platforms. That does sound OP
---
They should balance all of the killers
---
i‚Äôm pretty sure, never bothered to try it myself tho.
---
Although we do know that nothing really happens with these kind of reports
---
I have been maining the Doctor and made it to levelv16 and am still winning. Out of 13 games survivors escaped twice. Otherwise it was a 4k each time. I am new and have only tried 3 other killers and settled on Doc.
---
Hm, well either way that's a fun bug
---
Actually was in the same game as that person LOL
---
The hell did you do? Fuck their dads and make them pay you to do it?
---
Truth
---
There's never just 1 generator on the map to do, when you're missing 1 out of the 5 generators, there are 3 generators on the map that can be completed, so if the killer is camping one of them just go do another one
---
Mate get the fuck out of here.
---
that first hit was complete bullshit though. she was literally on the other side of the pallet halfway throwing it down
---
Not tying to be like that but I actually prefer the current timer for durations and cooldown.
---
That doctor just had war flashbacks after hearing meg's struggle.
---
In-game that's how to works. But if you real what I wrote above you'll understand why I made a difference Gauge.
---
People have been crying about how behavior needs to buff Nurse on console because of how "impossible " it is to play her due to "sensitivity", yet somehow there people that still learn how to play her well. At this point I just have an attitude that you either deal with or buy a PC because I'm tired of listening to y'all cry about it.
---
Yup
---
Yes and so far you have decided "it funny did laugh so this guy sucks."
---
My survivor rank is in the purple I don't ever want to be a purple killer just because of the pure level of toxicity I already see already making playing killer not fun.  I'll just stick to what I know and keep using killers that I have.
---
Same
---
He was bad. Just because you can get a few 4ks in a row doesnt mean anything. Yes old freddy will be missed but theres no need to bring him back he was changed for a good reason.
---
 [Proof](https://imgur.com/a/hXKN6Ly)
---
Yeahhh I don‚Äôt know about mid tier. Ghost face with the forever build is REALLLYYY plaguing my games.
---
And you can do better?
---
Agreed
---
What's  the forever build?
---
Of course the Spirit player does some dumb shit.
---
Virgin gamer vs Chad motorcyclist
---
A cluster of bloodied bubbles, perhaps?
---
I think it's their simplistic design
---
Thanataphobia, Ruin, Sloppy Boogers, and Nurses calling.
---
Edit: usually paired with killer add ons that slow the game down even more. Especially fucking Fredward
---
Consistent 4ks at red ranks? Youre gunna want spirit or ghost face. Nurse can do it also but its easier to have an off game or make a few mistakes that cause you to lose. So yea just those 2 if we‚Äôre talking about consistency.
---
It takes time and patience, teachable perks can be dumb as its luck if itll be on your blood web or not. Try getting your character to 50, it'll pop up sooner or later!
---
With the condition that 2 different survivors must be hooked before it will work, to prevent an early hook + tunnel into a mori
---
Sloppy Boogers?
---
Does it make boogers appear on survivors when you hit them?
---
Demogorgon was just hungry
---
Hahahahaha. I‚Äôve been calling it boogers since I heard Monto call it that. It‚Äôs called Sloppy Butcher if you really don‚Äôt know. Lol
---
Four percent
---
This is exactly what happened to me. 5min waiting in red ranks just to see the Killer farm.. dude.. I finished all Gens, they found me, I looped him, I got sandbagged, they farmed me, killed me, I felt kinda raped but yea life goes on. My Kate ü•∫
---
that's exactly how I feel too
---
i thought the joke was a the fov slider so you can get built-in shadowborn lol
---
I'm sure if you were playing killer and there was someone exploiting a bug that made it impossible to catch someone, you'd think differently.
---
I dont see third seal being used often! I love the perks you put it with omfg i have to try that
---
Even if he was, which he wasn't, enough people were upset that they changed him just because some people were rating him as the worst killer because they couldn't get the hang of him. He was the best stealth killer and tracking killer in the game. If you were awake: his whole terror radius played like he was right on top of you. Freddy players loved him before they changed him and they need to make another one so all Freddy players are accommodated.
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
I said balanced tho. Nurse definitely isn‚Äôt balanced. Any I meant just to 4k but not necessarily consistent
---
Lol I just did that today
---
What's this mean? I'm new to it all and leveling up the doctor
---
Reasonable nerf condition
---
The ranks tho...
---
Ive done that feels amazing
---
I could be mistaken, but I thought Undetectable just got rid of your stain and terror radius. I don't think it effects auras. Hopefully someone else can confirm or debunk!
---
Depends. Monitor and abuse is great on stealth killers. 
---
Overcharge has seen some use with pop but only really if you dont have alternatives. 
---
Overwhelming is kinda useless. Theres always better things than that unless you're specifically going for a fuck items build. But that's more memey
---
Actually it wasn't one high rank survivor. That would happen on occasion, but you would be able to tell pretty quickly and just swap targets for a little bit.
---
The reason it was changed was because 2-3 people who were Purple or Red would jump into a game with their level 15 buddy and just absolutely demolish you, especially in those games where the level 15 wasn't new to the game, he just de-ranked. Those games were happening more and more often as time went on. You could usually tell when that was because it was always a Nea or Claudette with a Flashlight who would just follow you around.
---
I could usually deal with it (I was a killer main before this change made Queue times nearly 10 minutes) when I came back from a break and deranked down that far, but without a proper build most people couldn't.
---
I usually just want to end the game quicker and move on. I know they DCd but I'm not depipping because of that and I'll get all of you into another game ASAP
---
U both could‚Äôve made it if she took the hit
---
I think nurse is balanced
---
I tried embedding my picture on the post, but I guess it didn‚Äôt work :( 
---
Not sure if this is news or not, I knew it was broken for a while so I was surprised when I got it. I tried searching here in the subreddit, but couldn‚Äôt find anything about it being fixed.
---
I don't play killer.
---
Nono... I think we‚Äôre on to something here...
---
You'll get there i got to rank 1 the first time playing only ace with unbreakable, borrowed time (before they both became bill perks) lightweight and dark sence. Gl on your road to 1 tho!!
---
You have to level the character from scratch. You lose everything when you prestige: perks, items and add ons.
---
The only benefits are getting the bloody cosmetics, and there‚Äôs supposed to be a slightly improved chance of getting better items in your bloodwebs. Emphasis on slightly, it‚Äôs not very significant and even the devs confirmed there‚Äôs not a good enough difference to prestige your character for that reason.
---
A trapper that gets a 4K yeah u must be cheating ban him now üî®üî®
---
His teleport technically gets weaker the more gens are done, if all gens are complete then he completely loses that ability. Any survivor who has Adrenaline literally turns him into an M1 killer with no power at all, since they aren't affected by his pools and don't have to worry about teleports.
---
Remember Me and Blood Warden literally only activate at end game and Fire Up doesn't start being useful until most or all gens are done, so they completely contradict Freddy if he's playing effectively.
---
VS. Old Freddy:
---
you can literally prolong the game for several minutes in the end game if you kept people asleep, sure adrenaline was still a thing but it was easier/faster to put multiple people back to sleep as old Freddy and it was harder for them to wake up unless they brought self care. Combined that with his infinite aura reading and his perks plus innate -50% slowdown and exit gates took literally forever to open allowing for Freddy to make pretty decent end game plays with the right build setup.
---
Sure we can mock how bad old Freddy was, but he did have some pretty unique and nasty builds that can get him clutch kills.

OMG NEXT KILLER
---
I literally just played a normal game as trapper on Hawkins
---
Is there such people that I could pay for that service ?
---
It always creeps me out how they look and walk around when they're in the dream state.
---
They must prepare for Unforseen Consequences.
---
This is my new favourite comment
---
tbh i love legions design and lore overrall, idk i find a group of teens with a manipulative head honcho to be too realistic and scary! same thing with ghostface (his lore is my fave ) , as for gameplay wise i found it very cool too even if its ‚Äúboring‚Äùcompared to the other killers in dbd... i love their mori too bc of how brutal it is!
---
They could be scary. Only if I could see them.
---
I  read the whole thing before I realized you were fucking around üòÇ
---
Suprise attack is just hitting a survivor after you get out of invisibility. Those are his better addons you go out of invis faster so the survivors can't get to far ahead when you go out of invis.
---
Endgame is generally where good players die/lose because they try to get everyone to escape.
---
Ghost face with the right perks is pretty good
---
He just had a good gaming chair
---
In my experience I run into more spirit's that run it  plus haunted ground, really annoying for such a strong killer
---
Every bloodhunt I hook everyone twice and slug them if I have to. But i never kill them so they can get their points as well. So it's still a normal game with interesting chases.
---
I don‚Äôt get why I laugh at such trash memes but have an upvote anyways. Anything for baby Yoda.
---
Honestly never ran into it, what does it do?
---
OMG!!!! bad word !!!!!! üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤ Im telling on u
---
You good bro?
---
Those little baby faces everywhere I go is the worst
---
He's really not a mid-tier killer, his Stealth mechanic makes him high tier and he's the only stealth killer done "right".
---
Ghostface:
---
- Creates mapwide pressure due to not having a heartbeat. Survivors don't know if you're next to them or not.
---
- If they want to reveal (or start to accidently reveal you), Ghostface gets an indicator as to general direction.
---
- One hit downs can be extremely powerful if applied correctly.
---
- Ghostface's stealth is the only one without a huge drawback. He has all of the benefits (Such as cancelling borrowed time) without being slow (Myers, Pig), having a "cooldown period" (Wraith), having a worse basic attack (Myers), or giving the survivors a stupid loud warning that he's coming out of stealth (Pig).
---
- Ghostface's small size and ability to crouch make him extremely hard to see even without being in Night Shroud.
---
- Ghostface's stealth is also the best ability to use in a chase due to eliminating Red Stain while not hurting your actual chase ability.
---
Ghostface is probably the best stealth killer we're gonna get, and he definitely holds his own in the top tier of killers and in high ranks.
---
Gonna have to test this build.
---
Also KO is a bit trolly isnt it?
---
I just DC when the killer is farming for the rift or whatever
---
edit: for people who disliked this, it‚Äôs fucking annoying to have any free time I waned playing my favorite game ruined because I waited forever for one match and I get some twat who doesn‚Äôt even want to play the game properly. It just turns Dead by Daylight into a chore just to do gens and escape while the killer gets people to get caught in traps or interrupt grab them. I just don‚Äôt get why they don‚Äôt play the killers meant for getting those challenges done. I know it forces you to play differently to do them, but if that‚Äôs your main gripe, just DON‚ÄôT DO THEM. You only get a little blood points and some cosmetic items. Seriously, those matches ruin the game for me
---
Community tab I think? I just stumble around until I find it lol
---
That keeps an ebony mori fair?? Ok. I‚Äôm not even going to start with you. That feature was literally added because a survivor could be dead 45 seconds after the match starts. Being hooked first doesn‚Äôt make it fair, ebony mori is is almost a guaranteed win with no effort.
---
I'm rank 16 and had a really hard game. They all escaped.
---
Afterwards I was like damn I got bopped wtf happened.
---
*All purple and greens*
---
no one understands Quinnten but Quinnten mains
---
I entered one in before but it always turns back into adept Legion. I'm on mobile though so maybe it effects it
---
I write my D&amp;D notes while waiting in queue
---
Queue times are ridiculous
---
A bit, but you're Ghostface. You're allowed to troll on occasion.
---
If you don't have the perks, Tru3 showcases the Sloppy, Thana, and Nurse's build quite a bit on his channel, both for Ghostface and Wraith. He kind of thinks he invented the build, but if you pay attention to how he plays it it's extremely informative as to how amazing Ghostface and Wraith can be (even if Wraith is completely add-on reliant).
---
Don't know about fair but this is intended and they can't make it stricter because of queue times.

Maybe i would've if he wasn't toxic tunneler.
---
I actually was thinking about this after i posted. Maybe make his power start depleting if he doesnt use it? His bonus speed cannot be higher than 5,2 (even with bloodlust or perks). I guess i would change to only 10% since it takes time for him to build his power
---
Wait no BBQ?
---
Miss you bby &lt;3
---
I once had the ‚Äúyou may pass through the closed exit gates‚Äù bug. I found out about it absolutely accidentally when all gens were already powered. The killer reported me because I escaped without opening the hatch or activating EGC.
---
You can throw it on in place of another slowdown perk if you want, but notta.
---
I imagine Tru3 never uses it because he's got everyone maxed already. BP kind of become a non-issue if you play this game that much.
---
Maybe if you have a terrible team. I've almost never seen a killer get a 4k with moris
---
Look at my thighs, mothafucker
---
He probably was right there the entire time, with insidious. Just got insanely lucky
---
It - at the absolute worst - effectively deprives you of one hook state and up to two opportunities to proc DS. I'd see annoying, unfun, and there's even an argument for it being a detriment to the game. It's a great many things, but "broken as fuck" ain't one of em.
---
The joke here is how easy Yhorm is.
---
One day clown will be reworked or buffed just enough to make everyone fear the funny fat man.
---
Well congrats to the killer mains in disguise, I‚Äôll be over here seeing ebony mori‚Äôs every fifth game combined with the biggest asshole tactics in existence
---
Undetectable doesn't magically disable OoO, all it does is stop it from highlighting your aura.
---
You still get to see their aura and they get a better/worse Premonition.
---
This moment was kinda made hollow when they brought him back later. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I love this character, but why make this long death/goodbye scene if you're gonna revive the guy soon after?
---
I think it would be really cool if it showed you an aura of your body where you were going to end up when you blink. That would immediately make her much more accessible to play as.
---
Apex settings LOL
---
Pft. All I‚Äôve seen all day is Oni. You‚Äôre lucky.
---
Ok but, have you tried getting good at Skillchecks tho
---
Replace ghost face with susie and it makes more sence.
---
The other team? Playing killer is miserable. Playing survivor is actually fun. 
---
Also don't know how you manage to see people use moris so much. I almost never see them. pretty much only see bloodpoint offerings.
---
Hell, I'm more scared seeing pudding than I am seeing a mori.
---
Perhaps
---
FFS, read every reply on this comment section, dipshit.
---
NONONONONO  
---
OH GOD PLEASE NO  
---
DONT BRING THIS CURSE UPON US
---
You have a few seconds after reappearing. Like 5ish or so.
---
Just fyi, I know this is unrelated, but you should never use his reappearance addons. Using his two strongest reappearance addons only reduce the amount by like half a second. Definitely not worth using
---
actually thought this was my post from yesterday lol
---
I don't like farming. I'd rather play the game. Didn't come here to get BP I came into this game to murder people and get pallets dropped on my head. As a survivor I just rush the game and leave or kill myself on hook. Its just really unfun imo
---
Playing killer is incredibly fun, don‚Äôt know where the hell you‚Äôre getting all these cold ass takes. Oni has been a blast after like 3 games of figuring things out
---
Can‚Äôt argue with that, this is a quote from the DBD wiki ‚ÄúThe stealth part about the description comes from the fact of Survivors having a hard time locating the Killer without the Terror Radius.
---
This part is badly translated into many languages, sometimes even claiming that the Killer will turn invisible, which is a source of great confusion.‚Äù
---
I feel like I say way more than 5.9% kates :o
---
T O X I C
---
1.1% adam main here 
---
Edit: both my mains nobody uses.
---
You replied that to me though lol.  But also grow up man don't stoop to petty insults.  It's childish.
---
Did he survive tho cuz it‚Äôs survivor/killer rule to let the baby dweet go
---
I ran charges on a brown medkit and it still worked for me, I tried with green and it didn't work, not sure about purple or yellow since I haven't tried them yet but it's weirdly inconsistent
---
No he tunneled the shit out of him
---
Sir this is a Wendy‚Äôs
---
What glitch was that I never experienced it before ?
---
Yikes
---
Just play a single player game with a good story instead of dbd like the Arkham games
---
I don't commit suicide on hook, yo. I'm gonna get my points worth, even if the killer needs to move to earth for a connection that makes the game fun. 
---
I hope my last killer enjoyed himself, finishing the game in 2min after slugging us due to his terrible connection.
---
PET MAURICE!
---
Remove hatches then I won't slug for my 4k. I want my pip and maybe a double pip if the game likes me which it never seems to do
---
I love doing that
---
Replace that Legion with the Trapper for me.
---
You could technically Dead Hard over them for no damage
---
Time for a ducking crusade
---
I love screwing around with my name
---
Just kill them and get it over with, don't be a cock knocker
---
Most infinite‚Äôs in the game don‚Äôt need balanced landing. Lolz.
---
I think the surprise hit is getting a hit a few seconds fter uncloaking and the disappearance add on doesn't have too much use, you could use it if a survivor is kinda far away during a chase and you want to cloak for that little extra speed
---
Sabotaged traps (with Toolbox or Saboteur) stay out of the match for 3 minutes, then respawn.
---
If you run the perk `Hangman's Trick`, they respawn after 2 minutes instead.
---
(Opinion based): If I could date one, it'd be Feng since we relate most, but I don't know if she'd want to date me.
---
I second this. Arkham games are good.
---
Hey now. She face camped the obsession after she hooked him the first time, she deserved a bit of pallet tbagging. But all in all I'm loving this new perk.
---
The lil' guy is just so meme-worthy, though.
---
This sounds like an awesome idea. It really sucks they never implement shit like this.
---
I‚Äôm pretty new to the game, who is Maurice? Also, do you main Legion? I need some tips! (Even if you don‚Äôt main him, any tips would be appreciated)
---
Mostly I just hate looping. It's annoying and ruins the feeling of the game, since it's such an unrealistic thing to do (In reality, if someone's trying to kill you, you're not going to run around in circles so they can catch you)
---
And then on the flipside, if theres no hatch. There is no way for one survivor to win on their own.
---
Well ya don't gotta be a dick man.  The question was answered.
---
Was any of them a SWF group? I've been playing SWF with my low level friends lately and it keeps pairing us up with their ranks instead of mine and I always feel bad for the killer
---
Wow, this is beautiful.
---
There it is. Guy who loves ebony mori also hates looping. Got it.
---
Yeah I was with the rank 13 and 20

Dont get caught out in the open applies to all killers. Only with billy is that you get downed instead of injured. Thats why i say his basic but faster and more punishing. Theres nothing to counter, only to play the core mechanics of the game better.

Well that sucks, I thought I couldn't really tell a difference. Hopefully that's something they change if they ever decide to rework him.

That's what I wanted to know, thanks.

That's an opinion
---
Thumbnail had me trippin
---
Because it's irrelevant to the post and anecdotal on top of that.
---
Chapter 15?
---
They won‚Äôt change it because they think it would make him op. Some of his addons could use some love though
---
I love his channel! He seems very nice and chill. I recommend him highly to anyone who enjoys DbD :)
---
if u are looking for people to play with u should go to gamerpals subreddit
---
Well it hurts those players, and also there‚Äôs people who are doing mori rituals.... because FUCKIN BHVR NERFED the ritual rewards with the cover story that they would ‚Äúget rid of mori rituals‚Äù when they in fact did not.
---
Survivor stuns legion with nemesis ‚Äî&gt; survivor becomes obsession, gains oblivious status effect (no killer terror radius for them) ‚Äî&gt; legion activates power, slides over pallet, stabs them ‚Äî&gt; survivor can‚Äôt detect killer‚Äôs terror radius, bleed out timer continues regardless of where legion is. The only way to pause the timer is to mend. If you stop to mend, legion will hit you and down you. If you keep running, your bleed out timer will keep going down until you go into dying state.
---
watching ppl play video games is overrated and never should have become a thing
---
Take a break from dbd bro. Go outside. Smile about some things. We‚Äôve all been there before. Just take time to appreciate yourself, you can do it bud
---
pallets and windows are the basics of the game and applies to all killers. You didnt counter his power, you didnt negate the chainsaw you just played the game. Splitting against legion negates his frenzy, not cleansing against Plague negates her red vomit, revealing GF negates his stealth, disarming traps negates Trapper, triggering hag traps while in chase counters her, losing LOS counters nurse' blink, etc. etc.
---
Now comes billy ..Freddy you wake up countering him for 30 secSpirit you walk to counter her phase. But she hears you and the speed boost loses any distance you might have
---
wraith best, nurse worst
---
Literally  is so good, I think it does  a good job.
---
Survivors have perks that reward them for getting picked up, getting hooked, not healing, unhooking in front of the killer, being slugged normally, and being slugged in the endgame. Killers get one consistent perk that does something other than slow gens and show auras and y'all can't stop complaining about it.
---
This is nice. How did you learn to edit like this and what program are you using? üôÇ
---
The intent was to let him go. But his time ran out unfortunately. At least I was nice enough to give him a few extra points before the game ended.
---
&gt;Wow that list is getting quite large
---
It should be bigger but I thought these posts would stop so I didn't grab the first 20 threads showing this bug.
---
Sick ass 5 hit combo

No it's a statement.

---
what's the deal with airline food?
---
Like i said i play legion at red ranks and its fine. You win some you lose some. What i mean is that it really is your gameplay that wins you. The better you get as killer the worse top-tier killers are. I dont play spirit, nurse, freddy because i think theyre busted and theres no credit in it for me.
---
BECAUSE IT‚ÄôS BEEN A JOKE FOR-
---
Y‚Äôknow what, you‚Äôre right. This is like talking to a brick wall.
---
Gotta be clown worst. Nurse best.
---
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not tunnels and they‚Äôre barely killers‚Äù
---
What‚Äôs the deal with NoED
---
I appreciate nothing about myself.  I'm a fucking loser
---
Not enough Dwight.
---
Best: Nurse
---
Nothing comes close to having the ability to ignore almost every object and Survivor's main defense against Killers...
---
Worst: Also Nurse
---
But she can also be a steaming pile of garbage if you can't use her power correctly leading to you never catching a Survivor 99% of the time as she moves slower than Survivors.
---
Aw that's not nice, those chefs work really hard.
---
well its not the time spent uncloking that is the important thing its how fucking slow you are while uncloking. so those addons are good. its sorta like why save the best for last is good
---
Soooo when did this turn into ‚Äúis nurse the best killer‚Äù because she is
---
yeah man i never use those offerings because they always feel so useless. :P it played out in my favor tho!
---
This is [my youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbJpUQiJ9sdbPPMN4lKtYlQ?) I have other stuff on there as well and am planning on making much much more!

Hey, thank you so much for answering! I am wondering if I should give Sony a try because Premiere is such a headache lately. üòÑ
---
I feel that it is not toxic aaron, only sometimes we get angry in some dead by daylight games, since there are, camperos, those who disconnect in the middle of the game, that attracts courage, I think it is not toxic you know, nor do t bag
---
You should really find a new hobby or go out and meet some new people.  Basing your happiness on what happens in videogames is not healthy. I think you need to get out of the funk that you are in so that you can really enjoy your life instead of posting suicide threads on Reddit.  You are in charge of your happiness plain and simple.  You choose how you react to others in games and around you.  If you get this worked up over a game with people that do or say mean things to you, you have the power to let it go or remove yourself from it.  
---
Hope you get better.
---
sneaky basements saves ;)
---
Who's first?
---
Should i upload the rest?
---
I can agree with what you said, but with her rework, she is nowhere near as good as she once was. Billy lilely won't get changed for awhile and his power is one of the best in the game. Being able to one shot survivors, traveling at about 204% running speed with his chainsaw, this gives him insane map pressure. Plus a lot of build work on him. He has base 115% movement speed, and a decent lunge. His only flaw is pallets and windows, but that is most killers problems.
---
BEST IN CLASS tracking, stall, and stealth. 
---
I did well with him at high ranks (I got a few 4K's with smoking splinters no less) and I found his playstyle pretty enjoyable, although it was partially because I enjoyed winning with "The worst killer in the game".
---
Damn, i want to play legion again now :(
---
It wont be fun
---
Yes it does: killer hooks survivor A. Chases survivor B. Survivor A gets unhooked, killer breakes the chase with B to mori survivor A. Happens almost every time the killer brings a mori. Now the game is ruined for survivor A and probably for the teammates as well.
---
Congratulations!
---
Congrats you wasted a bunch of pallets and are an asshole for no reason
---
[Huntress main] I guess that how they play, I rather sling hatchets until I beat Aaron rogers from 2018.
---
I think they said like 80% of the community is lower ranks, so higher ranks means significantly less people to match with so the matchmaking takes longer as a result
---
Last time I checked, survivors loop killers.  Also that's not looping, that's just dropping every pallet.
---
This sounds very petty and toxic on both ends.
---
Good for you !
---
At that rank on console that's probably their only hope of getting a Kill.
---
But Steve is 5'11
---
Im gonna be honest here, everyone toxic including me  
---
If your dumbass is gonna chase me for three gens relentlessly, you should expect some tbags  
---
And yea sure, facecamp me, ill either get saved with br and tbag relentlessly on exit gates, or happily change a 3-4k to a 1k
---
Okay then.
---
The best for just base kit I‚Äôd say Billy. Still strong overall and really fun to play. Worst is kind of tied with Trapper, Wraith and Doctor, since his base shock is so damn small.
---
Wtf, how stupid do you have to be as a developer to fuck this up..
---
I mean, almost every survivor uses adrenaline, I don't get why people hate noed but think adrenaline is okay
---
Hey man. Shit happens. Dont blame the killer tho. Nurse is really fun to fight against especially if they have actual skill. Good luck to yea
---
Just keep it within your same rank color. But something something longer queue times and all that.
---
I went back... Everyone died
---
I do main them (and Huntress)!
---
When you find a Healthy Survivor get close before activating your power. Some Survivors have Exhaustion perks to help them speed away, so make sure you'll be close enough to hit them before using Feral Frenzy.
---
When you use Feral Frenzy missed attacks end your power, so don't swing wildly. Make sure they aren't gonna 360 you. But you can't wait too long either, since Feral Frenzy only lasts 10 seconds before ending automatically; so keep on eye on the red bar around your power icon while Frenzying. If it's about to run out it might be worth it to take a risky lunge.
---
After hitting a Survivor with Feral Frenzy, if there are any Survivors not afflicted with Deep Wounds nearby you'll hear a heartbeat and see a red squiggle in their general location. You need to decide if you can reach them before your Power ends, or if you should end your power and keep chasing the 1st Survivor.
---
No heartbeat sound or red squiggle make's it easier; run up to the Survivor and end your power without swinging. Try to bodyblock them if you can; by getting between them and a window or pallet. It won't always help, but it's worth trying.
---
When picking add-ons, the Rulers, Sketchbook, Mural Sketch, and Iridescent Button are the only add-ons worth running IMO.
---
Frank's Mixtape and Stab Wounds Study aren't helpful at all, Fuming Mixtape can be hard to use and unhelpful, the cooldown add-ons don't have much of an effect, the Killer Instinct addons aren't usually helpful since they don't give you a way to actually reach the Survivor, and the knife add-ons only add 4 seconds to Mending when used together.
---
The button add-ons are alright, but you may not be able to get any use out of them depending on how the Survivors play.
---
As for perks, Thanatophobia, Bloodhound, Sloppy Butcher, Nurse's Calling, Bamboozle, Hex: Ruin, Enduring, BBQ &amp; Chili, and Blood Echoes are all good perks on Legion.
---
But run what you enjoy using and find helpful. Different perks help different people at different times. There's no "one build" that's always amazing, even if some perks are stronger than others.
---
And above all else, have fun. :)
---
Sorry for the book, hope you enjoy playing Legion!
---
Thanks, I used to be a red rank survivor before switching to killer when legion came out but this weekend was the first time i‚Äôve played survivor since. A lot has changed perk build wise.
---
When you got hooked in the basement [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6mhba/got_hooked_in_basement_and_this_happened_im/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) would happen.
---
Thaank you
---
Lmao
---
Thanks!
---
A separate position for 5th survivor makes me think whether they sometimes considered it.
---
everybody gangsta till the yui pulls out a woman yelling at cat meme during a chase
---
Fuck no. Old Freddy was boring garbage.
---
Thanks mate
---
Did... Did you really report her for that...? Lol?
---
thanks!
---
Ghostfaces, Legions, Wraiths and any killer that has played like shit (mostly from tunneling one player most of the game) always have it
---
Exactly; he is best boi.
---
You should learn how to be more resourceful with pallets, you‚Äôre just helping the killer out burning through pallets like that.
---
Farm or gtfo
---
No? Why would I report her. I was just talking about how I was a bit frustrated about this game.
---
similar happened to me 2 red and 2 purple with rank 1 demogorgon.
---
Lube up before playing next time - it‚Äôll hurt less üòò
---
This hurt to read, thank you for your sacrifice.
---
Also, how the fuck is his wife rank 4? I literally know all of this shit and yet I'm still stuck at 9-7. I know rank doesn't really matter and stuff but I've quite literally never heard of anyone being this **fucking** boosted.
---
I would message this to a camper too but then they'd report me and get my communications feature suspended for a day like someone did a few days ago on Xbox one üòÇüò°
---
Same, i still use it anyway
---
Those games are some of the worst. Especially when the killer isn‚Äôt good, just makes you lag to ez down you
---
Oh wait I thought the logo on the right was for whem you reported someone. Mb then. I rarely report so I guess I was wrong. Sorry
---
How am I pretending that Oni players aren‚Äôt doing well, I‚Äôm playing him at Rank 1. I‚Äôm not saying he isn‚Äôt good I‚Äôm just trying to bridge a gap here. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre not suffering it‚Äôs just trying to keep all killers on the same level, something called consistency? Pretty sure many companies like consistency and try to keep all people who purchased their product at the same level. I know no matter what I say the survivor main in you is going to make some argument to go against what I say... I play both sides equally and this change wouldn‚Äôt bother me.
---
Bloody hell im 29 levels away from finally buying them, i want to play them so bad but the shrine is so appealing and i just got the new survivor lmao
---
You did?! You're scum. I've never been so offended. No but seriously that seems pretty weird for them to get angry about. Sometimes you lose, you know? Sometimes you lose fucking horribly. I don't see the merit in getting mad.
---
This made me so happy
---
Why would you want to remove the cypress mori?
---
It‚Äôs okay! It happens :)
---
Pallet camping isn‚Äôt toxic lol. It‚Äôs a way to guarantee a yourself a bit of safety especially if the killer is near you 
---
Don‚Äôt fight toxic with toxic especially considering half of your argument you said ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt deserve a chance being toxic‚Äù which implies he hadn‚Äôt done much to begin with and you were making ASSUMPTIONS about where his behavior could lead
---
Imo pretty childish of you.
---
Honestly, compared to communities Leauge of Legends and Dota 2 we're actually pretty damn tame lmao
---
Some stats came out recently and Freddy has the highest kill rate.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/106566/
---
We FarmVille now, bois.
---
lowkey shut up lmao
---
Sometimes I get tunnelled, but I completely understand why. It‚Äôs to put pressure on the game with 3 people alive.
---
Getting tunnelled at 5 gens is pretty stupid and not fun. If killers do it, I really don‚Äôt have a choice, but to try and waste their time for my team.
---
Mmmmm
---
On the up side it will bring alot of people over to dbd and they are from fortnite meaning mummys credit card... increasing the funds behavior can put into the game. The influx of new players will also make it that there will be less queue times, so when ninja learns he isint the best and dosent know shit he will look towards monto, not otzdarva and learn how to play bettering the community. Hopefully, other wise there will be a massive increase in the toxicity that the game already has buckets of
---
I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you
---
I severely beg to differ.  Almost every game I run into someone toxic.  All of my posts on this sub include responses from toxic people.
---
Well I hated you first so... yeah. Take that.
---
Not to mention they're both for the best Legion members
---
*you are now exposed*
---
Damn I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt have to deal with that.
---
Usually not. There is a huge lack of high ranked killers, so most red rank survivor groups face a lower ranked killer.
---
I woulda raged that‚Äôs some smart Shit
---
Because they can be fun also because i adore their cosmetics i think they have some of the best in game also susie is really cute and thus legion main
---
exactly
---
I ran into a wraith the other day who was using it with a windstorm add on and it was disorienting af in a chase.
---
Yes
---
The best killer(s) would have to be my teammates. 
---
Worst killer(s) would have to be my teammates.
---
Demigorgon threw the first brick at Stonewall üòå
---
I enjoyed the OPERATION HEALTH joke in there, suttle
---
It‚Äôs actually quite funny how many of these you see on this subreddit of people not knowing why they got these cosmetics
---
smitty werbenjagermanjensen
---
I mostly just really like their aesthetic, teens in masks and leather jackets that run really fast with knives appeals to me as a Killer concept, and their lore, Frank is a clever and charming creep, Joey is a cold and merciless criminal, Julie is a 'popular girl' gone rogue, and Susie is a nerd and a cinnamon roll.
---
It's cool being able to vault pallets too, but mostly I just like the characters, rather their game mechanics/abilities.
---
That attitude of yours right there is exactly why you're struggling in your games man.  You have a self defeatist attitude going into the game.  You're still blaming game balance on your matches when killer has never been more balanced than it is right now.  And yes it sounds like you are failing to apply map pressure properly if that phrase sounds like a joke suggestion to you.
---
That was nice! I did the same thing with Myers, minus the teleport part.
---
Just had a billy a couple matches against and he‚Äôs my least favorite. I think it‚Äôs just because there‚Äôs not much of a cool down for his power plus he gets the super speed. He‚Äôs just always felt a little op to me.
---
Me: *laugh-crying in the corner due to not being able to loop for shit*
---
Imagine being mad about surviving the match with a ton of points
---
Farming is boring. Youll get your points anyway by playing the game in a normal way. Ill usually just do gens and leave asap as survivor.
---
It's more of a courtesy post, I hit red ranks within my first week of playing or so but I didn't know about the reset lol After that I've been on and off until i got a new router which lead to a pip or two every game for an easy rank 1
---
He‚Äôs easily the scariest killer.
---
I'm sorry :(
---
I- is this meme mirrored?
---
Has he done this yet?
---
I‚Äôd rather fucking lose to a good killer than win without effort because the killer didn‚Äôt do shit to actually play the game
---
Had mine on for the longest time but one group kept recreating a group to message salt so I turned it off.
---
You probably are lying lol
---
100% agree about the community
---
Luckily after the first 5 Hours I did
---
Red ranks ain't the promised land, for both Killer and Survivor.  Players experienced enough  to get to red ranks, even shittier que times, very coordinated SWFs, and easy to play killers with good add-ons and perks.  Honestly, past the noob guarded set of ranks, it only gets worse the better your rank is.    Yellow/Green ranks is the true promised land of the game.
---
Survivor: (1 out of 718.94 billion Claudette mains): Adrenaline, Decisive strike, Borrowed time and Dead hard/ BL  
---
Killer: (Oni): Spirit fury, Enduring, BBQ and Pop.
---
New Chapter: The Second Coming
---
Idk if she'd date me because i'm "not her kind" lmao.
---
Best would probably have to be Albert Fish. Worst? Ted Bundy. Over rated and boring.
---
They're going against a Legion, I'm gonna laugh if Deep Wounds gets someone.
---
Edit: Legion has Thrill of the Hunt.... but no Ruin. They are ignoring totems because of that. Please be Devour Hope....
---
Edit 2: Cleansed the totem, didn't cleanse Thrill. If Legion had DH, it's gone :/
---
Edit 3: They cleansed both of his totems and the Legion stopped playing, everyone escaped :/
---
To be fair, Meg‚Äôs teachables are probably most common with good builds. I personally run a frelons and sprint burst so it makes sense. But blendette? Couldn‚Äôt be me lmaooo
---
Did it come with its own terror radius?
---
I'll admit, I like the larger scale of F13. Bigger maps, more survivors, more potential win conditions. Those things make it feel more like a horror movie, which is what F13 is trying to emulate.
---
But I don't like that all killers are practically the same. I mean, duh they're all* Jason, but there's not much difference between Part 3 Jason and Part 9 Jason and Part 2 Jason, etc. Slight differences, but nothing compared to the differences in killers in DBD.
---
Only it's not a perk at all. It's an ultra rare offering. I wouldn't compare a skeleton key to a 5th perk
---
Yup.
---
This entire comment is ridiculous hyperbole.  
---
First off you're leaving out several killers who are perfectly viable throughout the ranks such as Freddy, Billy, Hag, and Huntress, with a next tier of solid killers like Meyers, Plague, Demo and Oni.  
---
Second off if you think the devs are going to nerf any of those killers to uselessness you haven't been paying any attention to the balance updates over the past year and a half.  Two of those killers you named as the "only viable" options literally just underwent reworks and emerged unscathed still top tier killers.  So that right there invalidates what you previously said right there.
---
This community can be pretty bad at times, but nowhere near as bad as other games like OW and shit
---
Right lol? Idk i‚Äôm used to nerfing for legion and I always play legion despite the nerfing so it didn‚Äôt really bother me this time. I‚Äôm just excited for whenever those sweaters come out lol.
---
Just what we need, 50,000 more survivors waiting in queue crying about every single killer. This is going to be great.
---
Wish they'd stop nerfing Legion so I could enjoy them
---
I like it OP, it has more effort put into it than most memes on here.
---
Although, maybe I'm biased because I'm a Quentin Main.
---
y'all im a rank 10 survivor, who literally started playing a month ago give me a break lmfao honestly. i think i do good once and every try hard comes up outta the woodwork telling me how shitty i actually did.
---
Fucking again? This is like the 4th time you've posted this exact clip with a similar title.
---
Yeah ideally they‚Äôd stop messing with legion however sadly they keep nerfing the hell out of em
---
ASS to going EAT I your am
---
Thank you!! :D I‚Äôm also a quentin main, oh yeah
---
I agree but it's definitely better then some other communities plus Toxicity is hated here so atleast this part of community has some kindness
---
Firstly, devotion. Secondly, it doesn't override Spine Chill or Premonition or people paying attention but you can get a jump scare or two.
---
I tried to look it up by searching the dbd reddit for dweard. Sucks I inconvienced everyone so much.
---
The first four. Maybe replace Devour for Sloppy or NOED
---
*gasp* I'm home.
---
That's actually not a bad idea.
---
i still don't get the science behind nerfing the lowest tier killer, unless they're preparing something big
---
I like to incorporate resilience into my build. I stayed injured while doing a gen with ruin (normally, no problem) those blood bubbles just kept filling the screen and made it almost impossible to see the red colored ruin skillchecks.
---
I tunneled after buddy. It was a toxic yui anyways, oh and the other guys were very supportive
---
Wait what Easter egg
---
I mean, if those survivors come into the game and help Killer queue times, I'm all for it.
---
And the survivors crying about every single killer ain't anything new, so we can't blame him for that. I got bitched at for playing Legion the other day. **Legion**.
---
I was just going to ask the same thing. This is some next level montages!!
---
People would buy them and it'd require no real art fees as they have the model!!!
---
Killers don't get rewarded for being at higher ranks, survivors do.
---
I said the fact that they get an add-on with an actual ability while survivors don't is a crutch. The perk itself is fine.
---
Looping is mostly fine on Hawkins, but the pallets will always be the most important part of the game.
---
I listed several reasons why it isnt a crutch, the most important of which is that you can play around it very easily.
---
You're what I like to call a "Fact Smacker", because whenever I give you a fact that you can't argue about or debate you just "Smack" it away by deflecting or making stuff up.
---
as someone who plays League,
---
you're correct. league's community is a shitshow every fucking game. misplayed? yo momma gets called a whore and you get called all the racial slurs that a living soul knows.
---
in dbd I was only called a sweaty killer at best lol
---
They should make it where if you get injured or downed during the time you have haste you get healed not just when it activates
---
Spirit game! Let's see how this goes.
---
Cleansed a totem with no Ruin, Haunted Grounds popped up. Ninja got hit, started complaining about being one hit. They still have no idea what Exposed does.
---
Just got Mindgamed by the Spirit, Spirit stood under pallet and he thought she was teleporting. He ran to pallet and got smacked.
---
Spirit ain't good, they've got 4 gens done with one hook.
---
Spirit opened the door for them. They're freaking out because they don't know if they can go out that door.
---
I'm broke AF, so please accept this imaginary gold medal award for your memes OP.
---
Not cool. "If you put a hook on it, " not "If you put it on a hook."
---
Ruin, Nurses, Sloppy and Deerstalker (if you want to chain asany exposed hits as possible)
---
I tried using No Mither like hey now I can run around and not drop blood for oni but that doesn‚Äôt work. I wonder if it‚Äôs working as intended.
---
That's because you're grossly over exaggerating the outlook of red rank killer games.  You're phrasing it like we're defenseless up there and completely at the mercy of survivors every game and that simply couldn't be further from the truth.
---
I'm telling you that if you personally feel this weak in your games that is a personal problem at this point in the games balance and there are things you can do and resources you can watch to help address this to improve your experiences in game. 
---
There are other builds you can run and have success with including perfectly viable alternatives to Ruin in Pop, Corrupt Intervention etc...There are some players out there that don't even like to run the perk since good survivors aren't affected by it that much anyways and it can be taken out so quickly in the game.  
---
Also you're using very strong language on that last statement there.  I'd rethink that one.  Take a look at the other side.  If they want to have a chance against good Spirit players they pretty much need Iron Will so they deal with their issues perk slot wise themselves.
---
Eh I don't thinks he's too strong by himself but yea flicking is a little unfair imo(which is what I think you're referring to with the "turn on dime with his charge". Besides that his tracking is mediorce as blood tracking can get hard if multiple people were around that area, his ability to charge it is countered by good survivor plays and he's kinda loud so he can't really sneak up and bonk your skull in.
---
hMMMMMMM no
---
Torn Christmas sweater for hag please
---
Idk, it‚Äôs pretty annoying instead of nerfing them to hell they should balance them out.
---
right! i can‚Äôt wait for them
---
Entity Displeased *in style*
---
Lmao gj
---
‚ÄúJust a little bit‚Äù
---
Some play on a controller
---
Some have generic keyboard and mouse from nobody brand that don't support macros (and the universal ones suck ass)
---
In my opinion.  Surviving isn‚Äôt the only way to get points like yeah it‚Äôs the overall goal. But most people sit and do nothing. There‚Äôs 2 options imo. Try doing a gen and either the other person will be chased or you will get found and a chase will follow. If you are good enough someone can do gens and you‚Äôll get more points for objectives or boldness depending on the situation you are in. You either die eventually or somehow survive. The only other option is to have 2 people hide and crouch everywhere and someone will be found and a gen won‚Äôt ever be done and no points will be made because evader gives almost no points and it will take like 20 more minutes then normal. It better to end a game and get into a new one quickly if this type of thing happens.
---
I guess that's one way to respond.  Have the life you deserve pal.
---
Well, you're rank 1. Your opinion MUST be important.
---
I think if there are 3 or more just try not to be caught and only try doing gens if neither of you is getting found. If there's 1 or 2 gens I think is worth it to try finishing them straight up
---
and it's gone now. What did it say?
---
You still bleed with No Mither so it is working as intended. Lucky Break is the perk you wanna use
---
Last year they came out right before xmas so i‚Äôm thinking it will be the same this year.  Hopefully earlier.
---
Few things here..
---
1. I did not state that I was dealing with these issues in my games. I may have stated that when i said im forced to play spirit, but that was cause i got outplayed in a match and was salty bout it lol. Generally speaking, I have problems myself including terrible early game, stupid decisions in chases, etc. Im speaking for all killers when I said what I said because i know im not the only one who‚Äôs frustrated w this. Yes good killers stand a chance against a sweaty swf team, but a good swf team will always beat a good killer. Lets establish that first. Lets also take into consideration the amount of second chance perks that survivors have. Im not even gonna waste my time naming them.
---
2. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with my last statement. Iron will is a good perk against any killer, why only subjective to sprint.. And ruin is a necessary perk for red rank killers, while iron will is a perk some people find necessary, while others don‚Äôt bother using it. Now u cant say the same thing about ruin. U are required to run it if u wanna succeed at red ranks. Not even debatable. Look at the top streamers, otz, fungoose, true talent, etc. you‚Äôll rarely seem the playing without ruin unless they‚Äôre doing a specific type of build.
---
3. I never said that us killers are defenseless, nor did I imply it. All i said was that gen speed at high ranks are stupid and that the requirement of 1 perk on any killer, at any given time, is bullshit. I said nothing about killers standing no chance against survivors. I was simply stating the obvious.
---
4. Pop goes the weasel is solid but survivors at red ranks know they‚Äôre loops, and will typically keep u busy. And good killers will then switch targets-thus making it useless. Thrilling is good good for tracking, thats about it. Corrupt is good I suppose, but good survivors will typically play stealthy until the gens get unlocked. Or they make work on gens which can as a result work in ur favor. Nonetheless, running corrupt w no ruin means u have to apply excessive pressure early game which depending on what killer ur playing- isn‚Äôt the easiest.
---
I kinda wish the game was less about looping honestly. I mean I know it's all the survivors can do I'm not complaining about that but, it'd be more fun if there was more focus on hiding or giving the killers better obstacles that aren't a waist high wall y'know? It'd be nice I think because anything new and different can stem potential killers that have powers to focus these elements such as the new oblivious status effect but a more physical change
---
This is pretty hot, pantsu
---
Lol I'm just kidding bro.
---
This is like the horror of being a killer. I just give the killer 2 extra hits and leave. Why are you guys tea bagging and DSing for extra points.
---
He thought the question was asking if he was monto and he replied with ‚Äúoh haha I‚Äôm not monto!!‚Äù And then everyone downvoted the heckkk out of it. It was such a pure response üò≠
---
I feel Marilyn Manson's cover fits fredboy
---
the statues look at you when you look away. Its fucking terrifying if you dont know about it but people keep posting about them
---
I stopped caring about Ninja when I saw him go on a whiny rant about how Fortnite was promoting other streamers instead of him. 
---
He‚Äôs a piece of shit
---
Nah. I can start streaming solely for you if you‚Äôre trying to see some rank 1 console Legion 4Ks brother.
---
Nemesis and rancor, eat a pallet get a mori, most fun I‚Äôve had especially if you‚Äôre on a killer who can really control those exit gates. Demogorgon becomes true pallet muncher.
---
Oh I knew that, thanks though
---
It makes his bell completely silent
---
Just read the ‚ÄúSurvivor‚Äôs Rulebook for Killers‚Äù next time and this wont happen. You literally broke rule #1. You can‚Äôt sacrifice any survivors. /s
---
GG Piece of shit. Ez baby Killer - Claudette probably
---
did i misunderstand you?  I took it as you making fun of me
---
oh I get why he deleted it. It was glorious tho
---
Rank 17 console Nurse......seriously glad she got 1 kill atleast.
---
I haven‚Äôt encountered a good Oni on console yet. 
---
That‚Äôs including myself when I was playing him, he feels ... strange.
---
-angry Feng noises-
---
Not sure how many you can get but I really want to get Claudette‚Äôs, Dwight‚Äôs (even tho there‚Äôs no glowing stuff on him), and Spirit‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt have spirit tho so I‚Äôm thinking maybe Huntress. Although I wasted 10 on Jake because I didn‚Äôt know Dwight and Claudette had Hallowed Blight outfits.
---
As a rank 1 survivor you should be used to this. As a rank 1 survivor myself and a killer player, I can attest that we are at a critical moment in the lifecycle of a killer.
---
At this stage, we know just enough about the Oni to understand what he can do but haven't found a reliable counterplay to exploit. One thing I've found that works sometimes it taking sharp turns around walls, but I haven't practiced enough yet. Eventually, survivors will catch on and exploit it and inevitably 'balance' him through game knowledge.
---
Using Ghostface as an example, people used Object of Obsession which was so strong, BHVR developed a new status effect to keep survivors from ruining stealth-based killers. Give it time. If you're frustrated, don't play for a bit or watch other people to learn that way but to call for changes before we fully understand a killer/character results in pre-rework freddy or current legion. Annoying but widely ineffective.
---
Survivors should be dying in **most** of their games. You can rank up and still die but killers have a specific medal category for hooking. If they don't get X amount of hooks, they will derank. If they don't gen guard for X amount of minutes, they derank. If they don't end a chance within X amount of seconds, they derank. Their entire ranking system depends on stomping you out whereas Survivor's is just "Be on a gen for this long" or "heal people this many times" which can be infinite and take (theoretically) hours. In otherwords, both sides can rank up if the game goes on for a little longer than usual, even if the killer wipes the survivors with a 4k.
---
TL;DR: Early changes are bad, try to find counterplays where possible, propose changes later, you can still rank-up against strong killers and the amount of fun you have is more based on the person playing, not the killer itself.
---
the 3 mentioned are the current best killers in the game hence why i mention them mostly in response to what you said.
---
&gt; Just change your loadout/killer selection. Devs show you lobbies so you can counter what you see with your loadout NOT so you can endlessly make players requeue in the Hope's of eventually being allowed to play the game. Man up or switch to survivor. 
---
so in this case if i see 4 toolboxes, several keys or if i know they are swf i sure as hell won't pick demogorgon, huntress or the pig, i will go no chill with my best killers and perks to try and get a win.
---
also about the re balancing you mentioned
---
&gt; Second off if you think the devs are going to nerf any of those killers to uselessness you haven't been paying any attention to the balance updates over the past year and a half. Two of those killers you named as the "only viable" options literally just underwent reworks and emerged unscathed still top tier killers. So that right there invalidates what you previously said right there. 
---
the unscathed part is blatant lie nurse got nurfed there is no other way to put it she got harder to play the fact that she is still top tier does not mean she was not nerfed. the spirit was also nerfed as you can't bump into survivors any more to detect and now you can see her vaulting windows witch did made a difference in how you played her since you could stop at the window and phase walk instead of vaulting and keep survivors guessing so again she got weaker in those regards and as a result weaker.
---
ghost face got "nerfed" notice the quote marks before you say "oh but it was pts" before he went live and i have not really noticed if he got any other changes since and the way he is being used now without stalking will just keep making him more popular and as the devs say "over preform" as they are aiming for the killer to only be able to kill 2 people wile 2 other escape. will they touch him? who knows but i am sure that a buff he won't be geting any time soon so most likely if they look up on him it will be another nerf.
---
and don't get me started on legion. unfun to play, unfun to go against IF you are against a good one. and his changes are mostly considered to be a nerf. after he already got nerfed.
---
in summary i was just stating how it's just going to be at the high ranks as a result to having to deal with a possible soft ban wile showing my concerns on the states of balancing on the killer's side.
---
I mean, can you blame them? Personally I don't care if you bring items, but I can see why people dodge.
---
When I accidentally get to low ranks, I end matches in 2 minutes with perkless wraith and have to farm with people/make intentional misplays to pip. What you're doing is just pain evil.
---
Unless you are making a post that fits everyone's agenda on this community, then I'd just keep it to yourself.
---
I posted a 1 minute video from a game I had, (which I survived in) and everyone I know thought it was hilarious but every trash rank 1 survivor on reddit thought otherwise and decided to belittle my gameplay and how well I did, for a rank 10 survivor.
---
This is a known bug, but I am not sure if the devs are working on fixing it.
---
I rushed my main, got him to p3 and would exhaust his BP stuff before prestiging, works pretty well because you only really need 1 build that's solid and if your teachables are limited you can get ruin/bbq very fast
---
That‚Äôs really interesting.  Do you get a good feeling when you do it?
---
I don't think that's a good idea because plague is already weak enough. Making her have to collect vomit would make her as bad or worse then the clown.
---
Can't tunnel the survivors if you don't know who's who
---
Gone
---
In terms of feeling toxic or feeling lucky? I usually just do it, nearly subconsciously, and then it just... works out. Maybe I'm just lucky, but it always let's me rest easy knowing I'm taking out ruin or third seal.
---
Lol I think when your the only one injured and the killer is right there waiting for you to get unhooked I think they can tell who is who, even against these Claudettes.
---
Thanks
---
I'm a returning player. What's looping?
---
Which is annoying because I‚Äôve do e all my killer challenges but only 4 survivor ones. :(
---
Ehh, Tbh I would be fine if there was an initial build up for players to actually get sick before moving into the "Sick to broken" effect. Plagues weakest feature is that her power lacks utility, It doesn't really slow gens meaning players can just ignore it. Because it has the broken effect tied to it I wouldn't dare buff it but i think adding "some" utility would take her a long way with how easy it is to apply her effects.
---
Because we need points
---
Would be nice for the mori rituals too
---
I had a Bubba bloodweb with BBQ 3 and 5 Award Winning Chillis yesterday and I forgot to save the screenshot. Fuck me.
---
This is awesome
---
Everyone knows meat tastes better with salt
---
Killers I play against never dodge, just bring moris or good add ons
---
Honestly i dont get why people think teabagging is always toxic. People have a hard time reading in between the lines i guess.
---
Is this Harley show out now?
---
Do you even hear yourself? Ha-ha, so if a Killer tries to help with other folks' challenges then you should disconnect? Gee, I wonder.
---
bro not cool tru3 is a good person you cant just go around trash talking innocent rational people like that i bet you are a privileged survivor main **** you man
---
The scariest part is the map being so dark.
---
I've been spooked by survivors so god damn many times
---
&gt; Survivors should be dying in most of their games.
---
And survivors are the ones who get called entitled lmao
---
Dead hard is worthless for me. I tried it for the first time last week and it lagged every time I used it so the killer hit me each time.
---
today on kek or cringe
---
Well we arent mind readers.
---
Sadly, expect lots of idling players. Because that's not a current issue yet but it can become an immediate trend.
---
**Standing still is cool kids!**
---
you're fine then :)  they were probably just mad about their games and wanted to take it out on you.  There's no shame in not being the best and similar to you, I take a lot of pride in improving so I think it's awesome you feel that way.  Good luck mate :)  Soon you'll be a rank 1 and can be the change you want to see
---
Yes, because survivors can rank up while dying while the killer cannot rank up without hooking. Pretty simple concept and I play both sides.
---
I feel like it should be a charge based thing, where every Gen after the first gives you a charge to mori someone.
---
Five gens? No Mori.
---
Four Gens? Still no mori.
---
Three Gens? Mori one Survivor.
---
Two Gens? Mori two survivors.
---
One Gen? Mori Three.
---
End of the game? Mori four.
---
This way the game gets increasingly more intense as it goes on, you can't just mori everyone out of the gate, and the Survivors are given a chance.
---
Up to BHVR to decide if you can stack charges or not.
---
That's what I like to see
---
There it is. ‚ÄúFeel bad for me or fuck off.‚Äù Get over yourself.
---
Thats not a forever build. Its just an anti heal build.
---
Ahh I see. Thank you for the clarification. I'll probably switch it out for bloodhound.
---
I really hope this is sarcasm.
---
Legit tho. Once I was hiding from Ghostface behind some tires and was looking at him. Literally no way my character had a line of sight, but it revealed him and he found me.
---
No problem!! I love Wraith. Bloodhound is a really good tracking perk. You'll never lose a survivor.
---
Step 0 - Do Bones
---
Yui has more adorable voice acting than Feng's.
---
But I don't wanna hurt both of them man.
---
I play games for fun not chores. It pisses me off when every goddamn match in a row is exactly the same, so I fucking leave and play some other game for a while, but goddamn it‚Äôs so annoying. What‚Äôs the point of even owning this game if it‚Äôs just do this and that for a bunch of worthless cosmetics? This whole rift thing has ruined the entire experience for me
---
Haha I had a similar story, I was Myers, both doors 99 with 1 on hook. Stood there while 2 others went for the save in my face. So I Tier 3 and down them. Got the last one with blood warden. Got called a camper but it was so satisfying.
---
And then there are people like me. If only there was legacy Legion.
---
At least killers get their bbq stack now I guess.
---
The problem with kindred is that everybody would like their teammates to run it, but nobody wants to run it themselves.
---
its just a bunch of kids/man babies posting dead memes over and over again every week. they arent good enough at the game to play it so they stay on reddit and watch youtubers play instead.
---
Lowkey annoying cause that was a good key too üò≠
---
Nope, I don't watch much tv lately.
---
Well, she isn't steve of that I'm sure.
---
F13 was still fun. Had they made the decision to continue working on it after the law suit, I‚Äôm sure it would have been a better game. I wouldn‚Äôt knock a game solely based on only one other title by that company.
---
Sorry for all the questions, its just that this subreddit has been amazing at answering them
---
I‚Äôd rather they give solo survivors kindred as ‚Äú5th perk‚Äù and an icon on who is being chased (like the obsession has). 
---
That way everyone has the same information, SWF or solo. 
---
I don‚Äôt want some kids screaming in my ears, the lack of communication is what gives it a horrorish vibe.
---
I think they're ok
---
I hope you don't care for karma either because they gonna downvote you for this heresy. Damn NPC's.
---
at that point all i would do is grab as many points as possible until hopefully i get hatch, but if not i try to help the other person get it. its a shame theres not much else to do
---
Have you played the game? The grind is terribles and someone needs to play survivor so you can get your BBQ stacks, let us have our points. Lol
---
leader, prove thyself, the new yui perk that increases wiggling speed if you run next to them and maybe kindred.
---
Eh, this is kind of starting to get draining.
---
They just went against a Billy that dominated two of them, one of them got out, and Ninja himself only made it out because of Hatch. DIdn't stop Ninja from going "Trash Killer" in end game chat while one of the randoms called him out on it. He dipped before anyone could say anything.
---
I find the general lack of respect for people's opinions very disturbing. I really respect Tru3's willingness to share his thinking on topics including controversial ones, and often enough he will keep an open mind to purposeful discussion and arguments. In addition, I really enjoy the effort he takes to verify his thoughts.
---
I'm sure if you were playing killer, you would be thrilled. Scratch that. You probably don't play killer. You assumed I was a killer main. Now I'm gonna assume you're a survivor main.
---
Pennywise was beat by a group of kids tho
---
I 90% killer and I'm ok with it because I'm not a lil bitch who thinks that every time a survivor tbags it means they are insulting mom or something. Grow some balls.
---
The game is literally over, it does not matter if the survivor had ds or not, in fact I probably would of picked one of them up in hopes they ds me.
---
   I love Play with your food on him since you can get stacks pretty easily. Drop chase and pick them right back up. Steal some stalking while they run off for good measure. 
---
   Monitor and abuse is also AMAZING on him especially with the dead rabbit addon, you have almost no terror radius in tier 2 so you can still sneak up on the survivors. 
---
    If you use nurses make sure you pair it with sloppy butcher otherwise the heal happens too fast and you won‚Äôt catch them. Sloppy butcher is the key to using nurses imo. 
---
   Last, ALWAYS check the shrine for good perks. BBQ and chili and ruin have been on a lot lately but there are some great information perks like discordance and surveillance that have been up there that will help you know where to creep over to. 
---
And remember, keep your tier 2 at 99% until you‚Äôre around a couple survivors or in chase.  Good luck!

loop better then yellow rank
---
The timer already stopped while mending, that's an old mechanic.
---
Pausing while running though? I really hope they plan to rework the entire mechanic, at least for Legion. Bleed Out should not be the same mechanic with Legion vs Borrowed Time (and clearly other perks that use the mechanic need their own shit)
---
I'm a person that plays a game for fun instead of whatever reason you seem to play the game for. What is even the point of playing if you're going to be a sore loser every time you don't win?
---
Why post these issues in this sub? Has nothing to do with the game and after your last comment any sympathy I had is completely gone. I mean I‚Äôm sorry you feel this poorly, but what are you expecting us, members of a game sub, to do to help you realistically? If your answer is somewhere along the lines of ‚Äúnothing‚Äù there might be a better place for this type of post. Just saying.
---
Nice! Pulling off plays as Hag like that are an amazing feeling.
---
I doubt they would implement giving old version builds. Even for starters 1.3.0 version.
---
My assumptions would be giving us the option to change builds from Steam/Properties and choose every possible version we could get. And honestly, still miss the timed hits on Freddy. They could just balance his timer from 7s to 5s to fall asleep and rest would be add-on rework. Players couldn't handle him because of not having enough patience I guess.
---
No there not lmao, also why do you care what others do with there money? I made money buying and trading codes
---
This seems like such a cherry-picky screenshot. Maybe OP was face camping or being an asshole. Who knows. Maybe the survivors were really being sore losers. Who knows.
---
Hahaha that actually got me good. Wasn‚Äôt expecting that üòÇ
---
I have a little over 800, I've played long that I really do not care if survivors want to do some extra bp farming after they destroyed my ass.
---
The bugs in that game made DBD look polished. The car in that game can be destroyed by Jason throwing a knife at it, for no specific reason, and that was a problem since launch, and instead of fixing that problem they made it worse. Your camera can get stuck interacting with things and then your stuck with a broken camera and not being able to interact with anything. Even the kills are bugged to hell, and you will force choke hold someone if you try to do certain kills in the wrong spot even though some of them are supposed to work everywhere there is space. They also left the game in it's broken state once their contract had expired, even though they promised they would actually fix the glitches and bugs before dropping out of the project, which left the publisher Gun Media to have to hire new developers, and the game was left to die because of how bad the lawsuit and the games state was. They didn't leave because of the lawsuit, they left because they knew the mess they made and didn't want to deal with it. Who's to say they won't do that if the Predator game goes to shit?  Illfonic seems like a bad developer, I wouldn't trust that they would actually make this Predator game good, especially since it seems like another survival horror game title. It takes one bad experience for your view of something to be tarnished forever, and boy, Illfonic sure spoiled their chance to look good to me. I wouldn't recommend buying that game if it comes out, or at the very least make sure you research it before you buy it because you don't want another F13 game.
---
Part of the job
---
Evil head honcho with young followers is very real and scary. Charles Manson comes to my mind.   
---
I love playing him too. I used up a whole frenzy just jumping a pallet multiple times.
---
Honestly I play survivior and idk if that was a "toxic" t bag,  looked like she was telling him to hit her out the door. They stayed and let him knock them,  so even if it is "toxic" he got more points bc of it. Lolololol.
---
Why, what is wrong with the changes
---
Nah don‚Äôt think so, the terror radius is present so that‚Äôs definitely the doctor. Hallucinations don‚Äôt have the a TR.
---
Purposefully ignoring the point, so I'll make it as blunt as possible. 
---
Having all survivors start on second hook is WAY to strong to exist, whether it's a perk, add on, or offering.
---
I love my edgy boi, but in the red ranks ppl do the gens so fast and his power can't help him with that and the mend time need just made it worse.
---
I think that after the deep wound nerf he should be able to see the killer instinct on them even out of ff.
---
I pulled a jump scare as Myers on a survivor apparently it was so bad the character started to just spin. They messaged me later saying they dropped their controller when they jumped irl. Feelsgoodman
---
Probably not, she want's a man with confidence.
---
I appreciate this
---
Exactly
---
Noed... whit myers????
---
They just keep finding a way to make it dangerously exploitable, and then take the easy and dumb aproach to the problem, f*cking killing it.
---
NoED reference. You get a small boost in move speed soon as the last gen is done. The warning pops up for everyone after the first down.
---
I mean, for someone starting out then yeah. You might not have your stalk ready or have completely drained the survivors. Plus the speed boost
---
There's a difference between being mad that you lost, and being mad that people were jerks to you for losing.
---
Nah you're not son, my 99% myers will beat the ass of anyone who comes near you during my face camp
---
They never get to noed when i play
---
This wasn‚Äôt a feature, it was a bug. My favorite bug in dbd ;-;
---
It sucks they had to fix it, it was really helpful
---
"Yeah, but *shitty* circumstances killed him"
---
If you enter the basment you have to stay for coffe, cake and death!
---
Fair enough. *angry Jake noises*
---
upvoting for the reaction, but also big brain mind game, üëè
---
No I was not.  I was being serious and genuine, but to the point.  I have a family member that describes a similar situation as your reactions to online "bullies" or toxic behaviors.  He takes them seriously like you to the point his heart rate increases, gets sweaty and ill.  He has even been hospitalized over his reactions.   I have been helping him understand and deal with his anxiety by separating his feelings from the actions and reactions of others with the philosophy of he is control of his actions and reactions to them.  It has been hard and it takes a lot of patience, but it seems to help to have someone that is there to hear him out and let him know he is in control.  
---
I am by no means trying to tell you what to do or how to act, only letting you know that you are in control of you.  And I do hope you get better.
---
he DOES seem really strong rn, i cant say if hes op or not bc he has to charge his power which can be his achilles heel if u gen rush, but if youre wanting advice i would run spine chill, aside from being a very strong perk rn, itll help you know that hes pulling up if hes using his speed power. leading him into tight corridors where it will be hard for him to maneuver is another thing u can do, but obvs that doesnt work on all maps
---
Basically, a survivor can run around a pallet a bunch of times before slamming it on you and looping around it some more until you decide to break it. Some loops are infinite if you have the know how.
---
Well you're free to walk away at any time then.
---
I just love his speed and how he can vault shit, its fun as fuck
---
I once tried to do this with a killer friend, we spent 2 hours wacking an afk Claudette across the map and she dc when we were lining her up at the exit gates. Ever since then I have hated all Claudettes
---
First time here?
---
The blind was a bit rude since you were already maxed out on boldness but I'd hardly call it toxic
---
To be fair in an organised swf group self-care only wastes time, so people don't just jump on the wagon for no reason.
---
Killers now: Haha take that BL!  
---
Killers tomorrow: Why are there more DHs and SBs?!  
---
Good job. They nerfed the third most used exhaustion perk so now the others will be even more meta than before and we all now how much people love it when someone uses meta perks.
---
They clearly weren't doing that though, y'all are way too uptight. Lol
---
Its in the patch notes you muffin
---
But he yells and stuff
---
It only happens when using the power, right?
---
If so I guess it's for consistency, if not it shouldn't happen by any means.
---
I mean when all 3 teammates die, how can one survivor power up to 5 generators against a fast killer?
---
At best you power a couple gens a little bit at a time and escape: at worst you waste the killers time
---
Doesn't reveal Insidious tho. I mean, it does show you standing there until it activates, but someone might not pay enough attention and pay for it with their life.
---
Had luck offering. Not 4%. Still great play tho
---
I know right ?
---
Don't you know that you're supposed to go sit in a corner and not move after hooking someone?
---
How dare you try to win. *You horrible bastard!*
---
Nurse on console is very ez to counter but very hard to play so i understand why tunneling. I never see a nurse with 4k on xbox. And if i see one that a miracle. But tunneling still cancer and not cool to do because this player can't enjoy the game
---
This shit is gold holy shit
---
Yeah, it's kinda sad. Something had to change for sure and I guess it's easier to mess with balanced than it is to factor it into all future map design. It kinda sucks though because the stagger reduction was the only thing I really liked about the perk. It was too strong on haddonfield but on a lot of maps all it really did was change it from "oh, multiple levels. Guess I'll die then" to "multiple levels? this'll have some interesting paths!". I would've preferred to lose the speed boost personally.
---
Yeah, no point in arguing with an ass hole. Ive seen you under so many threads. All you do is argue. Blocked.
---
Same here, put up an offering to join a game. Doesn't even load into a lobby, decide to restart my computer. Load up DBD, item missing.
---
Plot twist: you brought adrenaline
---
It reminds me of Reimi
---
I'm pretty sure that's due to the way it is controlled on console, with less control over the rotation
---
I wouldn't have even gotten into DbD if not for my girlfriend showing me the Legion in the first place
---
I gotta say you are right, I don‚Äôt mind getting new killer sand survivor but like what are we up to like 17 killers now? I would rather see a gig update on customization and a heap of other things
---
Oh shit that what happen when wraith go with spirit and 9 month later, this is the result.
---
Yeah man
---
Ok neckbear atheist  
---
No one brought religion into the game 
---
someone made a innocent joke post since its a meme that jeff looks like jesus and we are in the christmas season
---
LOVE
---
I got merciless on my second game ever as huntress (not adept tho which is fine)
---
oh look ur about to cry
---
You're only half wrong as this GF isn't from Scream
---
I like controlling him through the fury, especially over Billy's controls, but he's so easily punished... Or at least when I'm playing as him.
---
More evidence your a troll when you reply with the clichie ''your gonna cry'' reponse
---
You could not live with your own failure, and where di that bring you?
---
Im glad that people are on the same page as I am. I feel like BHVR doesnt care about game health as long as people buy the dlc when it comes out. People will stop playing because of the absolute garbage that is this game. BHVR took a step in the right direction with the DC bans
---
Had something similar but from 2 running no mither. Not my fault they picked the worst perk to run.
---
But I'm just saying why are survivors so salty to begin with. Never hear from killers with bad games.
---
Did you see the list of 10 links saying that exact same thing?
---
One possible solution is to finish a gen (with 2 gens left hatch will be visible) and then search chests for a purple or red key.. it takes a lot of luck and the stars aligning but you can force an early escape this way and maybe even get the other guy out too
---
I‚Äôve gotten salty Killers, too. Some people just can‚Äôt accept that they played badly and feel that they have to blame it on everyone else.
---
Hey, I got enough people shitting on me in this subbreddit thank you.
---
Kindred trumps all stealth abilities according to its description
---
He got beat by the kids of Stranger Things
---
I love how his power allows him to juggle quite well, something not all of the other killers are capable of doing. Like sure, you can insta-down a survivor, but that's just one survivor not doing a gen. There are still three others. Sadly his slowdown potential's been nerfed to not be as effective as it should be.
---
To be honest, I feel like it would be a lot better if they didn‚Äôt give a definite date on things. By saying ‚ÄúDedicated Servers coming ___‚Äù then everybody expects them, and they‚Äôre still having issues. 
---
I play Xbox and don‚Äôt really mind the queue times or loading times. They don‚Äôt feel completely awful. I think there should be a few balance fixes, personally, but I‚Äôm not extremely hurting for them at the moment or anything. 
---
Bugs are my biggest issue, and I wish they‚Äôd sort them out, and I think they need to. They should absolutely spend more time fixing them, but new content generates more money so you know what they‚Äôll prioritize.
---
Overall, the game definitely has problems, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs completely broken or anything. At least, not to my knowledge.
---
Yeah maybe   
---
seems like to me if it was a bug they would spawn clipping in someone
---
Ice op plz nerf
---
On console, Billy is definitely easier to curve than Oni is to control. Oni is just hard in general though, I suggest you just keep trying to make it work if you want to play Oni on console.
---
They're not legit? Oh gee, silly me, I forgot we were all made to hack them in. Oh wait, we weren't.
---
Ive yet to spend a dollar on anything but the new killers. All of the customization I use shards on. They are missing out on my money because the console runs like ass. Sure, 1 mans money is no big deal, but imagine how many other people think the same way.
---
Eh I just do it to distract the killer for as long as possible if my teammates haven‚Äôt escaped yet. It‚Äôs honestly a lose-lose situation for killers. Either they leave that survivor at the gate to try to get the other survivors, and risk that survivor then trying to help their teammates. Or you force the survivor out of the match, and waste time you could use to kill the remaining ppl. Other than that I don‚Äôt stay to teabag unless the killer was being toxic. Sometimes I‚Äôll stay just to play around with the other survivors too. Or to say goodbye to the killer and maybe to offer them a tool box :)
---
I agree with the dates. I dont think they realized how disappointing it is for us when we were promised these new changes and they are delayed. They should just say we are working on ___ instead of this is coming out ______
---
I disagree.  I think you're view is rude and antagonistic for nothing more than petty laughs at others expense.
---
Im a pc player and it takes about 10 minutes most times not exaggerating but like u should expect longer wait times on console there are less players
---
90% + 90% + 90% +90% speed = 360% more speed. Neais just speeding around the map
---
I am a her and basically a lot of ways survivors could use it to their advantage. Lots of let‚Äôs players go into depth about it and I don‚Äôt care enough to write everything out. I will say though that the updates with the timer for escaping &amp; specific newer killer perks would help balance out some of the trolling that would obviously ensue. But either way lots of younger kids play the game unfortunately and I‚Äôd hate to see a voice chat feature be abused &amp; harmful to young kids
---
Oh. I have to test that then
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
No you can‚Äôt see the timer progress as killer
---
Some people like cosmetics? It brings me joy to play with vibrant skins in a game like this. I just love the contrast. Some people also like to collect stuff. I bought every skin in the game just so that i could see the numbers in the store go yellow. Just because you dont like cosmetics doesnt mean that theyre worthless for others.
---
Tell that to my rheumatism.
---
Hah! I love a bit of fantasy, but that cfg second pannel was a touch too much for me.
---
this needs to gain more appreciation
---
There's a perk called nemesis which makes a survivor your obsession and gives them oblivious (can't see your terror radius) if they stun you. Legion's power used to be based on terror radius, so you could just keep following them until they bled out.
---
The Freddy in the game is completely based on the remake.
---
Have you not seen the remake?
---
Freddy was fucking all sorts of shit up in the real world after the characters started experiencing microsleep.
---
Do we really need a good reason to kill?
---
What?
---
Probably cause it sounds a bit racist
---
Hell yeah, dude.
---
&gt; Killers don't get rewarded for being at higher ranks, survivors do.
---
*I, and many others would rather be a high rank killer against survivors of equal skill than be a high rank survivor smurfing on people in low ranks.* Sure killers will have to play better at high ranks, and Survivors have their allies to help them but that in no way means that the survivors can play worse at high ranks.
---
&gt; I said the fact that they get an add-on with an actual ability while survivors don't is a crutch. The perk itself is fine.
---
Name one add on. One. That rewards the Killer for playing poorly. The only one I can think of that would barely even count as a crutch is the Coxcombed Clapper Ultra Rare addon for the Wraith.
---
Survivors get items which are just abilities that work at specific times but they are consumable, and the only time a survivor wont have an item is if they dont take one from the blood web or plunder any of the 3 chests on the map.
---
&gt; Looping is mostly fine on Hawkins.
---
I would kind of agree but there are very few loops that are safe and the distance between them is rough requiring to the survivors to use the unsafe hall pallets to make more distance. The distance between safe loops and the amount of safe vs unsafe loops is why that map has the highest Kill Rate, but we are getting off topic.
---
&gt; but the pallets will always be the most important part of the game.
---
Of course. Pallets make distance from the killer.
---
&gt; the most important of which is that you can play around it very easily.
---
Yeah play around it by slugging them and letting them keep their health state for later and they get picked up. Except 60 seconds is far to long. You can finish a chase hook, chase down the unhooker, hook then, and then chase and down the unhooked survivor and pick them up and still get hit with DS. You there is nothing you can do other than going 'Oh I guess I am forced to let them run around and heal, find totems, or do generators instead of punishing them for running right in front of me.' If it were an anti tunneling perk it wouldn't have worked because I wasn't tunneling. Its a crutch because it lets the survivor play like a baboon for 60 seconds and be invulnerable.
---
&gt; You're what I like to call a "Fact Smacker", because whenever I give you a fact that you can't argue about or debate you just "Smack" it away by deflecting or making stuff up.
---
What exactly have I made up? I have put facts down. You have given opinions, and don't understand that a Crutch is something that
---
Whispers is good yeah, that is why people use it.
---
It doesn't directly give the location, so it isn't considered massively meta.
---
I used to 95% of the time play solo when I did survivor with the other 5% being with one other friend. He's too busy to put serious time into this game, but he was good enough to have fun when it took the average of my purple/ red rank and his yellow. Since we can only get red/ purple ranked killers he can't compete in a chase at all anymore and it kills the fun of the game for him. 
---
Now its more fun for us to jump on Siege or CSGO when he has time to play for a few hours. It sucks, but this change took DBD out of our gaming rotation when we're choosing something to play together.
---
Ah yes using flashlights. looping, doing gens and healing yourself. All toxic actions.
---
Are you kidding me?! Open your eyes! Its show me there is a survivor! There is a red line both screens.. thats mean survivor is there
---
legion did nothing wrong

No problem!

Hope I could be of some help! &lt;3

"Okay, Bloodweb. Don't give me no lip."

Of course you are because how dare someone else have a opinion that differs from yours.  Lol

People are such snowflakes these days.
---
Dwight is a gay icon, why wasn't he the gay-boy?
---
I'm happy to see that somebody else think the same way as me.
---
He‚Äòs an ok streamer in my opinion and his thoughts don‚Äòt really interest me as much as his gameplay. What I don‚Äòt like about him is how much he‚Äòs priding himself. Recently he‚Äòs shown why Wraith is a viable Killer by creating an optimized build for him which I really liked since everyone severely underestimates Wraith. He started playing long streaks of Wraith and at the side he had this counter for how he did. Next to his one loss was ‚Äú(god loop)‚Äú and next to his two draws was ‚Äú(2 4 mans)‚Äú like he‚Äòs attributing his performance to game issues. Sometimes he clearly plays flawed and complains about issues within the game to protect his inflated ego after losing. Or when he‚Äòs playing with a submitted build he‚Äòs always complaining how bad it is.
---
The main and sole reason I hate this game is that any way to get extra points is toxic, besides got op add-ons which will always ultimately end with you earning *less* points.
---
In these cases you got to pick off the toxic players one by one just to make a statement tbh.
---
If I remember 3 mist addons coorectly they made anythiny invisible. Findint someone with old freddy on such a map was glorious, just 5 people that can stand 2 feet apart from each other without seeing anyone.
---
Please keep posting these.
---
I love it, I honestly didn't think that he would be such a asshole.
---
Hey Susie is pure and wholesome, she'd never take NOED.
---
beating them if theyre on comms is gna be rough since they have the edge, i usually just dodge 4 man swf lobbies unless im ok w getting dookied on
---
I think they're both amazing games, and Friday couldve been so much more by now if they didnt fall into that lawsuit. They're the only 2 games I play recently, and I have so much fun on them both. 4k hours on Friday and 2k on dbd, dont regret a thing :)

whoosh

&gt;The huntress poisons Quentin Smith's drink, but mistakes it for her own and dies
---
I'm getting "Luigi wins by doing absolutely nothing" vibes from that
---
My queues for killer only take about 10 seconds, survivor however takes about 10 minutes lol
---
you need to beat them to it, and yeah it's just positioning, make sure you're a bit away from the hook but in front of it and just standing still

Greens and Purps.
---
Whenever he goes against a killer who is actually good and 3-4ks, they're a trash killer. "This Trapper isn't even good, all of the kills he got were because of Traps!". He goes against a Killer he easily escapes, that killer is a trashcan.
---
Yeah, he's one of those, and it's getting worse and worse the more he's drunk.
---
Honestly, I have respect for Killers who are this cold blooded. The one time it happened to me, I was more impressed than angry.
---
The main thing is BBQ&amp;chili. It has give vision AND gives extra BP. Survivors have "we're gonna live forever but only gives BP.
---
Wish more people used Tapp. He has the camo of a Blendette and the built in iron will of Ace.
---
Reveal is broken on both sides. 
---
Whenever I face him, I watch him stalk me from 10 meters away and can't do anything about it while also revealing him across the map when not really knowing where he is. 
---
Whenever I play him, I get revealed when crouching behind a car.
---
okay. the hit still did not connect. if she didn‚Äôt throw it, he would‚Äôve missed
---
Just gotta get more blood points. Killer typically gives more especially when using BBQ and Chili perk. If you‚Äôre dead set on survivor, use David kings perk that gives bonus blood points. It‚Äôs the survivor equivalent of BBQ and chili for the most part.
---
They're kind of running together now.
---
It's just been a general string of "GG EZ Killer" when he escapes, and "This killer is horrible" when he dies. Other than calling Leatherface "The Pig Man", nothing of note has really happened anymore.
---
I have no problem with tru3 and his TydeTyme-approaching levels of silly tier list opinions, but man does he act like the biggest victim in the world when people make fun of his opinions. He says its slander when someone thinks that the fact he rates Wraith so high is funny. I don't think he actually knows what slander means.
---
Its wonderful he feels confident enough in his opinions to say stuff like Wraith is better than Billy, but he completely and utterly lacks the will to deal with people saying that opinion is extremely silly.
---
Oh no, free publicity for the game.
---
I mean, if you idle, I WILL just collect on my free kill/bait survivors into wasting time rescuing you.
---
In order to avoid confusion, maybe the legion would just have the ghostface mask as that is the most recognisable feature. It would be too hard for a full cosmetic as they are too similar size wise and weapon wise for a full cosmetic as survivor‚Äôs would get confused and the community would probably be outraged.
---
game is unbalanced until there's 1 survivor for every gen
---
Legion main, can confirm very fun killer.
---
Dude, you are talking like if it was a billy disguised as a leatherface. now that would be a big surprise to see him sprinting towards you instead of doing his chainsaw thing.
---
Legion is low tier and Ghostface is middle tier at best. a little surprise that pretty much would not work on slightly experienced players is not a reason to not doing something. they walk and even how they stand it's different, their way of playing is different.  It is a lot harder to know when Myers is about to kill and yet players notice it.
---
Nancy's got a cool beard.
---
‚ÄúI work really hard for my rank‚Äù, but then you farm.
---
I think it is the first one, but I might be wrong, never really proved that myself
---
So he tends to wait for everyone else to die to get hatch.
---
He just died, and another guy waited next to the hatch, and that guy is a useless piece of shit. He said in end chat:
---
"Dude, there's a special place n hell for useless cunts like you!"
---
"I did 3 out of the 4 gens...."
---
"LOOK AT THE POINTS!"
---
*The guy who Ninja was yelling at had 9k more points than Ninja*....
---
Jesus I've been waiting for at least 25 minutes every time I play killer
---
I don't think he would have the same similarity as Leatherface. Let alone Leatherface himself have most collectible faces he needs.
---
For Demogorgon he could have torn clothes attached to his mouth or hands. Or even human flesh parts.
---
I really don't think copying same ideas on skins would be ideal.
---
Nice
---
As if ranking is a measure of skill. It isn't.
---
Play long enough, and the game will eventually rank you up. Pipping at red (+1/+2) needs a really good game as it is since no unhooks (like stomping the killer) actually makes your only safe pip :/
---
Rank 4 is literally just above purple...so not surprised at all. play long enough with blendette and you can get there. Also don't forget after purple rank, killers you get tend to be mostly purple (hardly any red rank...but when you see one they are hard) or green.
---
Ps played casually like onece or twice most month but I took time this month. I'm not great (800hrs mostly killer for bp) but even I made it to rank 2 playing twice a week. Rank doesn't mean shit
---
Well that's you, but the fact is most don't care.
---
The killers get to see the survivors from far away in addition to the BP gain. The survivors only get the BP gain. How is this hard to understand?
---
If you agree about the pallets, then you have no reason to disagree with me about my previous statement.
---
I don't think you understand just how easy it is to avoid picking up survivors for 60 seconds.
---
Almost everything I've said. You made up that I supposedly said BBQ was a crutch when I wasnt referring to the perk itself as a crutch, but rather the face that survivors don't get a real perk ability with their BP perk. You also keep trying to argue about DS being a crutch perk but I've given so many factual reasoning why it actually isn't. If anything it's a bad perk that only punishes bad killers, and you just keep saying "60 seconds" like that's a critical amount of time when it's actually just not. Like how are you going to sit there and tell the Leatherface basement camping main that DS is a crutchperk when they say it isn't? Next are you going to tell a blind person that it's too hard to read?
---
At least you don't make the hatch open/spawn instantly.
---
No one cares about pipping anyway, the matchmaking is terrible regardless.
---
I'm convinced it was purposely put in the game to make it harder on killers. It has hurt me way more times then it helped.
---
I didn't notice he was playing with friends that explains a lot, btw how can u keep watching he's such a asshole (and even more when drunk) I can't stand the guy so I watch only the one game
---
I don't think that the killers who rely on huge mobility would enjoy outfits that ghostface wears. These clothes could really fuck them up and if the legion would fall down every time he tries to vault a window because of these stupid stripes etc it would be the lowest the legion could fall
---
Play Killer. Not only does Killer get more Bloodpoints per match on average, they also can't die in the first 2 minutes of a match. You'll go through the entire match because you have to, and you'll be getting points the whole time. No 1-hook in the basement resulting in 1.7k Bloodpoints anymore.
---
Killers also have access to the absolute best Bloodpoints farming perk in the game, BBQ &amp; Chili. It doubles (if you hook every Survivor at least once) your BP at the _end_ of a match, meaning you can go over the 32k cap from maxing out all 4 categories.
---
I am with you. Theee guys who downvoted you must be finding it really hard to survive games, I guess.
---
Organized SWF group isn't the standard, and organized SWF groups aren't the ones who make the meme about "sElFcArE wAsTeS tImE" true. It's the shmucks who replace Self Care with We're Gonna Live Forever or Plunderer's Instinct and then die 5 minutes into the match because they don't know how to hide when they hear the Terror Radius.
---
The joke is that TydeTyme ranked Clown above Spirit on his "Hag is D tier" tier list.
---
Why are you making this out like you were attacked? Lol
---
Spirit, nurse, Oni = DC. I don't want to put up with stupid unbalanced shit.
---
Game with a Black Ward.
---
REPEAT: GAME WITH A BLACK WARD.
---
Also whenever he beats someone who's shit, and people actually mention it in his chat, he'll say "that's what you always say, that they're bad".
---
Obviously he's playing against top (or "creme of the crop", as he names it) opponents all the time. But he's just better.
---
Honestly I think Amanda just craved for Kramer's attention and also was violent, but she didn't really care about all the justice stuff.
---
Thx!
---
‚ÄúMom says it‚Äôs my turn on the Ecksbawks.‚Äù
---
In all honesty yeah it does I just started playing last week and I‚Äôve gotten at least 6 messages from survivors just shitting on me.
---
For sure. Some of the ridiculous ways it twists my camera is awful.
---
You don't have collision in the dying state so when she hit him she couldn't block the hatch anymore.
---
Over generalization now is not meant to be taken literal btw
---
DH is relatively easy to play around. SB is annoying as shit at times, but it can also be played around if the survivor isn‚Äôt being smart with it. BL was broken as fuck, and on some maps had 0 counter play. I‚Äôll take DH and SB over the old BL any day of the week.
---
Advice - learn that knowing of complications before hand and using the word unforeseen to describe them is wrong.
---
Watching hooks, you?
---
What good is NOED with a power that cant use it?
---
You should always try to have all your traps set down scattered around the map when playing Hag
---
I haven't been playing a lot recently, im not exactly the highest rank, so chances are, i wont be running to gods like you
---
Shocking news: Website specifically made for downvoting unwanted comments downvotes unlikeable man posting unwarranted opinions. More at 8
---
You can‚Äôt play around dead hard if the survivor uses it for distance and not for jukes.
---
Super common to have the longest wait time in the world if you are switching from survivor to killer or vice versa
---
Who mentioned being attacked? I just find it funny how shallow people are that when they disagree with someone then they are obviously a troll whose opinion is not worth listening to. It's truly pathetic, but that is the dbd community in a nutshell, entitled basement dwellers that cry to their mommy when a survivor does anything put run in a straight line or when a killer does anything but just chase survivors.
---
It's supposed to be a delay until you can start matchmaking. So you hit ready up and have to wait a minute until it actually starts searching or whatever.
---
I am fully aware. It just looks dumb.
---
Cuz thats dumb
---
He's put three Syringes or Styptics on his medkits and I don't think he's used a single one.
---
Like he uses the medkit, without using the add-on at all.
---
That‚Äôs pretty unfortunate. So when you kick a gen you just freeze and can‚Äôt move at all?
---
Correct. Letting you know this was within the first minute or so of the game, so I didnt have time to set them up yet
---
It's those challenges man
---
I mention being attacked because twice now on this post you've said something to the affect of "sorry for stating my opinion" or something therein. Those are defensive statements.
---
The only killer I consistently use Moris on is Demogorgon because it looks cool as.
---
I‚Äôve never morid when the survivors only been hooked once, I use it over getting their final hook because it looks cool as.
---
My mistake then.
---
You could say that about any game with voice chat. Fortnite, a game that landers to a young audience, even has voice chat. Dead by daylight is rated 18 and older. Of course young kids play it, but it is the parents responsibility to determine what their child can and can't play. It's not the devs problem that some kid is playing an 18 year or older rated game.
---
This is the same with any violent/adult game. If I were a parent I wouldn't let my child play GTA V, for instance. But it's not rockstars fault that parents are allowing their kids to play. It's the parents responsibility to stay informed about what their child plays, not the devs.
---
These are great ideas
---
I don't disagree. But as with any game with voice chat, you don't have to use it.
---
If you don't feel like talking or listening to team mates, just turn it off. I feel like that too sometimes when I'm playing games with voice chat.
---
Games don't force you to use it.
---
Oh ok
---
Yea
---
That Face grab was Badass
---
Hell no that would be a disaster. I have PSN friends to do that with
---
Then don't use it. No game forces you to.

Well i checked out this guy and i have no idea who he is and i know dbd for a long time, i just keep watching "monto" and his friends..

Better question, do they answer to OSHA?

Imagine thinking a report does anything without proof as long as you got multiples :D

Of course im making it defensive, im responding to an accusation, which in this case is utterly ridiculous.

As for personal, it's not personal, fuck off with that shit. Lol
---
Ok? Uninstall and move on.
---
Goodnight.
---
Because Wraith doesn't get an insane movespeed buff (without having to come out of stealth) or insane tracking on his ability.
---
They want to encourage Legion to  swap targets. Allowing you to apply Broken on the first person you hit would just mean you could hit them, apply Broken, and then cancel their power without them being able to heal at all.
---
If they dont put a 25 dollars shipping maybe i would
---
How people on the internet still dont get that any kind of attention even negative helps out those who you want to shit on. Dont sub, dont watch and that will do the most dmg you can.
---
I‚Äôm aware what the change is, my question is why is that a nerf?
---
You still have to mend before doing anything useful, unless you plan on just running endlessly for the rest of the match?
---
I think of it like comp in other games or raids where communication is especially key to winning hence why SWF are so strong but if my games are literally almost fucked bc I don't know their language then there is no communication and the feature would be wasted. 
---
Don't get me wrong it would work for most people but I'm just talking from personal experience
---
Honestly I‚Äôm drunk and I made this on a whim. But I see nothing but praise for those guy because he somehow misses the cringe radar. I would like to shed some light on how terrible he is. What‚Äôs even worse is he says that he is the most entreating streamer in all of twitch and that would be true if he could offer different content at least 7 days a weeks. Instead its the exact same content every single day. It‚Äôs awful tbh. At least compared to what him and others consider ‚Äúthe most entertaining streamer on twitch‚Äù and no he‚Äôs not exaggerating or joking when he says this..
---
I'm guessing he is a DBD YTer?
---
He can't anymore
---
F
---
He can't anymore they nerfed his like flick ability bc it was genuinely a bit OP
---
I never said it didn't because it definitely does
---
In all these years i maybe met two or three face campers who did it without any reason. Dont think this is the case here
---
I wasnt at all commenting on whether your comment was obviously satire or not. Please reread my comment and reply specifically to me or use the reply feature on a different response because what you said to me had nothing to do with my comment on the fact that there are many people on reddit that have a difficult time telling satire for non satire.
---
If you're good enough at every Killer, then yeah, then they are all ok.There's just some Killers with powers that are really useful and good and then there's ones like Legion that you just can't use it for anything well.
---
She's a fucking video game character
---
Terrible taste...hopefully got ignored since he clearly wanted attention to the point that he‚Äôs ready to make a joke like that.
---
Nothing. Games like that happen sometimes.
---
And tbh idc if I get downvoted to oblivion because this guy hides under the guise of a Harvey Weinstein-esque vibe. Watch his videos where he‚Äôs doing the cringey side-by-side singing. Dude licks his tongue at girls and it‚Äôs extremely uncomfortable. Lol
---
If you dont like him stop watching
---
It's hard to find all of them. And even if you do you've wasted so much time away from gens for a perk that the killer may or may not actually.
---
Because it's the internet and it's really hard to discern sarcasm and stuff without a clear:'/s'
---
What‚Äôs not right exactly?
---
I am willing to spread cringe content to the masses yes.
---
Legion is super fun on small maps. But he's trash if the map is too big because he CAN'T be used like that - FF doesn't get you far enough.
---
I was gonna say i rarely see a Daddy Jake jacket but then i remembered everyone has em now :P
---
I think they mean it shows them as Rank 4 but are still 2 pips away from it.
---
as a quentin main, thank you!
---
Now, imagine if she was solo and would have to take DC penalty because no one in the match knew what to do/cared about it :/
---
 Killers depip with 2kills, survivors can fuck about for half the match and still pip. Survivor easy as fuck unless you only care about escaping and not rankings
---
Probs PC players, since Oni has 10x better control on PC than Console and Nurse is just good with 60fps and full mouse control.
---
A lot of people did when he came out.
---
- Multiple killers
---
- ran after people stabbing them as many times as possible.
---
- teenagers wearing a mask
---
- uses a knife.
---
When Legion came out, and up until the point of Ghostface's release (probably leak, now that I'm thinking about it), he was considered Ghostface's Hillbilly.
---
DH for distance only works if there is a window/pallet ahead
---
If they can dish out being an asshole they should be thick skinned enough to be called out on it.
---
I just made an edit to my previous comment, blood echo might be a pretty good game changer to pressure survivors into healing, thanatophobia has always been a staple on legion.
---
WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY
---
Kinda wanna try Dark Devotion with that new Oni perk I forgot the name of, where if you get blinded/stunned they become the obsession
---
This would be realy cool. They could also do some more basic ones for the non-licensed killers like have one for the killer that came with the survivor/s
---
No matter what there gonna give you shit after the game so play like a cunt.
---
He's a god tier huntress when he gets a few games in with her
---
The David was the only toxic one of the group. He teabagged and left. The ready of you let her hit you before escaping. That's a courteous thing to do.
---
Gg ez baby Jesus
---
I know right, I'm like 'Who...?' LOL, but regardless, venting around here about a random players mannerisms is really pointless (I tried to watch OhTofu but his voice and repetitive nature grates my ears) -- if you don't like them, don't watch and support their channels, right?
---
I'd assume they got a double pip that game then.
---
Streamer, doesn't upload afaik.
---
If talking about the rank difference between the right top corner and the leaderboard, it has always been broken
---
if about matchmaking, it's 6 rank radius so it's working correctly (though, I've got a lot of rank 14 killers when I was in rank 3)
---
You're right! My bad...but that leaves us with the initial question -- what is this post about? Lol!
---
This was my friend and that's exactly what I told her
---
I love his laugh, even while getting stunned, and other sounds so much
---
I guess OP just got confused about dbd not working properly so he decided to post it here for a possible explanation
---
Jeff and Ace: "You left us to die, asshole."
---
OP: "I don't even know who you are."
---
You are really pulling some mental gymnastics to justify objective racism
---
They should also increase rarity for prestiging. Current prestige is not worth it, unless you want bloody clothers and/or overflowing BP gains.
---
Unfortunately, BHVR "says" a lot of things, only time will tell which things actually come to be.
---
I almost never teabag but sometimes it's necessary. Had a game where a ghostface camped and tunneled a Nancy for the whole game. We all tried to take chases for her but he hard core tunneled. Then I ran him for 3 gens, he downed me, put me on a hook, camped me again of course, then I deliveranced and sprint bursted into the gate. He knew I had DS and I just stayed there furiously teabagging the whole EGC. He got a 3K. My team was proud. And I was too.
---
Personally I don't think it's that uncommon in competitive games. There is usually a lot of emotion going around after a match and some people aren't... great at handling emotions, I guess is the nicest way to put it. There's a lot of salt to go around, in another less nicer way to put it. I do love me some Dead by Daylight, but I also will admit that the community has quite a lot of people in it who are prone to being very very vitriolic when they lose, and hell even if they win. And it's not just survivors, killers can be too, and survivors can be really mean spirited to other survivors. 
---
Essentially I just ignore a lot of it, since you really can't make everyone happy and some of the bullshit people'll fling at you really isn't worth remembering. You'll probably never meet them again anyway.
---
6 levels is a huge skill difference why did they make it so large?
---
Do you have a working link because I read that they removed the ability to report via their site apparently. Only in game reports. I hope we're wrong, because as someone who's been blocked before, it boils my blood to see it happen.
---
:)
---
Do you know when exactly?
---
So what happens when you hit a survivor?
---
Did you just call yourself bad??
---
"wasting your time" is nothing for you? i could play 3 killer matches in the meantime i get dodged 3 times and play even a single survivor match 'cause you feel entitled to leave? nah. they should get penalties.

This is a summary: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6fvql/pig_changes_proposed_by_pig_mains/

My comment was LITERALLY to attest to the ‚Äúunholy amount of idiots‚Äù that can be found on Reddit. I was also attesting to the fact that said idiots take many obvious jokes as serious statements. You claiming that it wouldn‚Äôt happen is evidence of your ‚Äúnewness‚Äù. Unless you are going to refute my agreement to the idiots comment or how they take satire, then you are literally arguing with yourself. You can attempt to project your inability to follow a conversation on to me but its clear to anyone with half a brain that your are completely lost in this discussion and had to invent an argument and target in order to redeem the modicum of E-pride you were left with.
---
No date has been provided yet
---
That patch rolled out already unless those two BBQ items are late. I lost my hammer and dress from the event.
---
That's me right now. Mostly playing Huntress/Myers/Legion but I'm spending all my bp on nurse for thanataphobia.
---
I kill them before Noed ist active
---
I don't believe that the event items were rolled out alongside this patch, yeah. If I were to guess, I'd say the event items will be given to everyone soon.
---
I'm glad weak killers are getting buffed because I have the most fun playing against a variety of killers and guessing who I'm facing
---
"These hooks look a bit unsanitary"
---
I think you're just a little frayed or stressed out trying to master him. He's still new, you're still coming to grips with him. It's worth noting watching people play is always a good idea to learn like strategies and builds and stuff, but it's also detrimental if you're not really doing so hot with the character or build. Because like, they can do it, why can't I? It can really frustrate people when they reach that point, but you aren't the people you watch, every situation is different. Keep trying and I'm sure you'll get at it, take a break if you feel the need to and play someone you do have a good time with for a while. The Oni won't go anywhere.
---
And as an aside who cares if the red ranks, or anyone in the game honestly, are laughing at you? It's not worth thinking about, the dirty secret is even those guys'll fuck up eventually. Nobody is perfect at DBD, everyone has that one game every so often where you're beaten harder than Legion.
---
Your opinion is wrong when factually it's not bannable, as stated by the game developer lol.
---
Your opinion is it SHOULD be bannable, theres a difference here.
---
It's not but they lose more for camping
---
It reveals Insidious I had this last night. Doesn‚Äôt reveal Wraith in is though - so I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs everything except Undetectable?
---
Dude stop watching Tru3Sh1t
---
yikes
---
In the devs opinion its a viable strategy
---
Yes thank you. I didn't give some context but basically the killer hooked me through the end game sequence. My mate was trying to get me but I told him not to because he didn't have borrowed time or anything.
---
They said in their opinion it is ban worthy. Not bannable
---
Nice to know
---
Whoops, I'm an idiot
---
Yeah someone just told me about the medal thing for killer.
---
Insidious grants Undetectable now
---
Indeed
---
According to her, she tried to and it bugged out and deleted everything she typed.
---
Ignore me, misread the comments lol
---
The killer will derank as well and if the survivors have any brains they'll just gen rush and get a free escape
---
Which will still take you away from looking for targets to down. Some people don't need the 20 seconds Pop grants you
---
Yikes, well I now know the killer loses out on a medal if he's too close to people on the hook
---
If all they do is for distance just out position them. They either go down or they dead hard to nothing. Its outplayable no matter what, unless they already have enough distance that the only way you would have hit them is with a max range lunge.
---
Oh definitely. But at least those killers' powers actually 'work' over bigger maps, Billy and Oni especially (even if it's not ideal). If Legion can't actually cross the map and find someone before FF ends and he gets his ridiculous stun, his power is useless. I wish Legion could be buffed so that his stun is only half as long if he never hit anyone with FF since activating it - to allow him to cross maps quickly without a punishing penalty which means you might as well just be an M1 walker.
---
That said, the new Sanctum of Wrath screws over other killers more than it does Legion. Billy, Huntress and Oni are pretty worthless when it's so dark and there are bushes and rocks everywhere. 
---
Some maps that should be pretty ok for most killers on paper are crap in other ways. Ormond is an alright size IMO with lots of relatively open space, but the aura reading is janky.
---
Whatever your problem with the dude you have, it doesn't appear he said anything offensive to you personally. Going after him like this is just rude.  Grow up, if you don't like to hang out with someone then stop, it's especially easy if the other person doesn't even know of your existence.
---
Thats why people call Him Thick Jesus, Jeff best dad.
---
But all the killer has to do to rank up is get one kill. Dosent matter if hes standing infront of the survivor or not a

They ask you to do in-game reports, but if you have evidence, support should still take it. haven't reported anyone in a while tho, so it might've changed.
---
https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/requests/new
---
Nope bc I hardly play survivor I'm low rank so the killers there can't really understand when a funny just happened
---
I never noticed any map in the game being *that* dark, and I'm actually playing on a crappy 15 yr old tv that smudges dark colors together and makes things extra dark. Sounds to me like you've got some kind of unusual contrast settings on your screen/system of choice. Might be worth looking into to improve your experience of the game.
---
I didnt really apply context but I got hooked during the end game sequence.
---
I do understand the stragegy about gen rushing if the killer is camping, hence I run Kindred
---
Hmm, that's pretty shit
---
Cheers for info though, just getting alot of opinions and info from people on this post
---
This is so funny to me every time, the fact that some people think that reporting someone is any kind of threat, when in reality it literally does nothing.
---
Whenever there's a bloodhunt I take a break from the game. I didn't buy a "horror" game to play Farming Simulator 2019
---
Ye no one likes campers
---
20 seconds away from an 80% worked gen is a LOT of pressure, expecially if you get another pop to use on it again if they happen to touch it. If they don't, the gen is regressing. I see it as a double win situation.
---
Of course, pop doesn't do miracles for every killer and mostly the high-mobility ones can use it at its full potential (Nurse, Spirit, Billy, Freddy), while the others have to make a choice when running it. I wouldn't use it on the Hag or the Huntress, for example.
---
Ye no one like campers. On any game lol
---
Funny you said that, I ran into two games like this situation.
---
First being that two survivors DC after 1 minute of the game because they died to the hillbilly. The hillbilly found me and David and decided it wasn't fair that they dc'd so we just farmed.
---
Second game I was with 3 bills. All of them died and I was the last one alive, next time I was on hook, I would of died. We both saw each other and stopped. I then get a message and basically he told me to go into two traps for a challenge. I did that and he gave me hatch.
---
Shows that killers aren't scumbags all the time, sadly the first killer I couldnt message and tell him thanks
---
U know it scares me 2.8% have this achievement but 0.8% has the ghostface achievement where u down marked targets
---
Just played a shitty teammate who decided to first self care twice (before and after kobe) while i waited for him over the hatch to either heal me up or die on the hook.
---
Bitch struggled till the end and obviously Killer found me to get me killed as well.
---
This isn't even that bad. Since the start of dedicated servers I had multiple instances of killers hitting me from the other end of the map...
---
What's the achievement?
---
I mean It was a great play,but let's be real guys
---
Epstein didn't kill himself
---
After last buff it is S tier for solo ... now everytime someone is hooked you can see if they are being camped and if someone else is already saving so you can eat gens without having to guess.
---
I dont see any justification to further discourage face camping. If theres gens to be done, they should work on them instead. If its during endgame, everyone else can just leave. You already know the killer loses point for doing so. Sounds like its plenty discouraged. The next step would be prevention and that would require heavy handed action on the devs part.
---
Im a killer main and i let survivors sometimes farm and escape if they weren‚Äôt toxic assholes!
---
I have been in the shoes of that killer.
---
So wait, you tried to murder them? That's illegal!

I could link more posts but I feel like this is enough to prove my point.

I have my monitor's and Nvidia Control Panel's settings set so that the Windows 10 Task Bar is ***almost*** black with the darkest color possible, which should give a good idea about my display's brightness and contrast.
---
If I set it any higher, the colors will tint grey-ish and I'll lose the vibrance of colors. No HDR btw. In every other game and DBD map I can see everything just well, but the new map is just simply too dark.
---
I just realized how fucking big huntress is!
---
Yeah. its been a while since i have seen the saw movies but i think she rigged certain traps to be unbeatable right?

---
I should clarify as I have been going through the replies telling them this:
---
- this happened during the end game sequence, not mid or at the start of the game. I know if you get face camped at start/mid game, you gen rush. I know this as a matter of fact because I run Kindred for this sole reason.
---
- I now understand some of the replies saying that it's not bannable according to the Devs but the killer loses out on a badge. Still, it's infuriating and you lose out on BP (I was using streamers that match with my mate)
---
I hope you read this before you reply as your answer has probably been answered.
---
But that's just the correct play at that point. Is the killer supposed to leave the hook and let you get saved when they know at least one gate is already opened?
---
All the time if it's specific killers! I don't mind being hooked or being farmed/helping farm for good killers either

I do have respect for Killers who‚Äôll just mess around when two or more survivors quit/die right away. Because at that point there‚Äôs basically no chance for the remaining 1-2. It‚Äôs also kinda frustrating when you try to be chill about it, and they just sweat on you because ‚Äúwhy should I not play killer properly just because some people quit?‚Äù.
---
Thank you!
---
I did manage to get a few unhooks (I think I got 2 or 3) and I managed to survive until the end game, where I got hooked and camped.
---
If everyone bluffs is anyone bluffing?
---
Even before the last gen is done, I assume they have no Ed. I just count the number of perks they have and if they have three and I can‚Äôt figure out the third I say no Ed
---
I don't think BHVR give a shit. The fov default fov is disgusting and causes motion sickness, BHVR's solution? Make it a perk.
---
They won't even separate the graphics options, or allow you to choose the resolution. By all measures the game shouldn't have survived this long, but hey they have an addictive game loop with licensed killers.
---
Bc it's a shape without a name or description
---
They can stand by the gate and block it, requiring me to do a 360 on him or to go to the other gate...
---
Yeah. Right is had, left is cannibal.
---
He never said it‚Äôs bad. He always says that he doesn‚Äôt like it because of that.
---
&gt; 20 seconds away from an 80% worked gen is a LOT of pressure 
---
Not if survivors die before they get to finish it
---
"Am I a joke to you" - Michael Myers
---
Yes we know him as that but in the context of his name it is a good way to describe him
---
So you just go to the other gate and escape for free, that's such an obvious play. The killer did the best move for their situation. They don't have to play by your rules
---
Oh wow, thanks for that clarification! I had always thought of using it on Spirit or Hag to fake-teleport/phase and now I guess I know why that never would've worked. :D
---
Hag Splinter, Signed Ledger Paper and Cattle Tag 28. Those are some old offerings.
---
This is not true at all.
---
Wraith is just a good boi who got really mad about having his trust abused. :c
---
Not if they are rushing gens to get Adrenaline. Situations aren't black or white, and pop helps in those grey situations.
---
AHHHH okay that makes so much more sense. I feel silly now. Was only looking at Legions perks and not the power itself! That clears up a lot of confusion for me. I'll chalk up the other killers to me making too much noise but the Legion was the main one! Thank you!
---
Deerstalker shows downed survivors in a 36m radius.
---
It's not playing "by my rules", it's called common decency and faith, not alot people have it and I'm suggesting that you possibly don't have it.
---
Think about being in my shoes in that situation.
---
I mean, depending on how the game goes, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a problem. If the killer is chill and respects the survivors, then yeah it‚Äôs a douche move to t-bag. That being said, I will happily t-bag against a sweaty, facecamping, tunneling killer. Also it‚Äôs just lite trash talk. Which is present in literally every competitive scene throughout history. It‚Äôs not a big deal.
---
OP Sprite. the match lasted maybe 6 minutes tops.
---
Its either 2 things
---
1.They are lazy as shit and put 'it' instead of 'he'
---
2. In the Halloween movies they refer to michael as 'It' because he isnt 'Human'
---
Or 3. Bc they are french Canadians
---
Also that

---

---
For one minute. That is not strong at all
---
this is making me cringe dammit. How does he still dont know what exposed does, cant he put 1+1 together and figure it out himself or someone tell him. He seems to be the carnation of toxic big ego survivor who instantly blames something to be OP when someone beats him. Why has he even been playing DBD recently, it doesnt seem like he he having that good time
---
It absolutely is, you're asking the killer to put themselves at an incredible disadvantage so you can play the game you want. In serious matches you should know that unless someone has Borrowed Time, getting downed in the end game is a death sentence.
---
Its high pay off for high risk. Try playing nurse yourself, it‚Äôll take at least 20-50 hours just to be able to get a grasp of her teleport and lunge enough to be able to blink where you want to accurately. Even after this she is very easy to juke and if you break LoS she has to rely on reads to be able to score a hit. People say good nurses dont get juked but id call anyone that can accurately place there blink a good nurse, from there in order to not get juked its all reads and understanding the patterns of each specific survivor you are going against and capitalizing on that. She does ‚Äúbreak‚Äù the game in that she ignores conventional chase mechanics but in order to use this insane power you need to put in a lot of technical skill and be able to accurately and quickly identify play patterns of 4 different people every single match. She is balanced because she rewards the skill of the player using her and allows higher skilled players to actually punish lower skill survivors where as most killers it doesnt matter how skilled you are at the game, if the survivor makes it to an unmindgameable loop you have no way to deal with it. With nurse you always have a way to score a hit and everytime you dont its because you fucked up or the survivor mixed up their play patterns, outplaying you and causing you to make an incorrect read. To me thats balanced.
---
Good thing I'm rank 10 and climbing!
---
It clearly showed hatch there, if the Oni was smart, they would have bb'd you from getting the hatch.
---
&gt;Post FF fatique time: 3 seconds down from 4 seconds, addons which decrease fatique time removed.
---
This is something they *need*. No other power is punished this bad for using it.
---
&gt;I'm totally fine with FF attacks do not count as basic, it is simply in line with all other Killers, so not a big deal about it.
---
For Legion it kind of is a big deal. Half the fun of frenzy was using it to apply status effects that other killers couldn't do as easily, he was really the only killer that could make good use of third seal and dark devotion. Now there's very few perks that actually synergise with their power, excluding enduring+spirit fury to bait survivors into giving you a much shorter cool down duration after using FF. Sure you can use the pins to apply blindness, mangled and broken but aside from broken, they're not really useful but...
---
&gt;Defaced Smiley Pin - Hitting Survivor while in Feral Frenzy applies Mangled status effect until fully healed.
---
This. So. Much. This. 
---
Just give me a reduced cool down duration and this pin change and I'll be a happy stabby teen.
---
you're brave enough to not fear the day you will get face camped 10 times in a row and/or gen rushed by toxic tbaggers and say to yourself "I hate this game.".  
---
That's beautifull, BHVR should be proud to get that level of commitment !

You can certainly pip with one kill, but that doesn't mean you can just hook, camp and pip. You need to apply gen pressure, hook and chase other survivors, use your power etc. You obviously don't play killer
---
Oh balls I completely mis read that. My apologies.
---
It's a lot harder for licensed killers to get cosmetics because of said licensing. Hence why for the longest time Myers and Laurie didnt have any and why Pig/Ghost Face/Tapp dont have nearly as many as the dev made killers. On top of that, what would freddy even have? He didnt really have any alternative looks throughout the series, plus they could only get his appearance and story from the remake (hence why Quentin is the survivor that came in that DLC pack), so that kinda limits the options even more.

they literally patch shitloads of bugs every new update... 
---
But as programming is.. You fix 1 bug and 2 new come.
---
You should also know that not every developer there is a bug fixer, they have special departments for that. A Animation director cant fix bugs, neither can a Creative director.
---
She does fine when they don't cleanse, even in the red ranks for me.
---
Especially as a newer player you won't have any trouble with people not cleansing. Being broken is enough for a new killer to get a huge amount of value and she's great to counter out stealth.
---
I love her and she's lots of fun, go for it.
---
Reference to the movies
---
gotta love it :D
---
This first point is mostly for new players than veterans. A lot of people come into this game just because of killers, making low ranks a waiting fest if you want to play killer. If we give new players an inventive to play survivor, they probably will.
---
I mostly suggested this because most of the time I have a long queue as a killer (10+ minutes, depending the time of the day) and almost instant as survivor. Sometimes the other way around, but much rarer.
---
I believe we should incentivize one side to play as the other when needed, even if just once or twice each day. It wouldn't be something huge, but will help leaning things towards the right direction. I get that most killer mains would be angry about this, but having a 50/50 of getting killer/survivor isn't effective. You need to have 1 killer for every 4 survivors to keep the queues from being waiting hell. 
---
I know not everyone has this problem, but some people do. Also, I don't believe this'll hurt the game more than it'll help it in the long run.
---
Respect the 4% and the chance the shaft is directly at the hook -.- OMG
---
Its a killer doing its objective
---
Why soo mad
---
Remember if you dont like immersed ... burn jigsaw piece.
---
So annoying that survivors often confuse their 360‚Äôs with auto aim
---
For newer players okay I can agree this would be good but I still think especially the daily challenges suggestions is a bit dumb especially when I'd have a easier time doing killer ones than I do with survivor ones
---
Mental illness
---
I think they accidentally removed the feature with the spaghetti code because I saw nothing in the patch notes about removing this feature.
---
Youre kind of right tho.
---
thats not ghostface, thats a guy with his costume! (Just half of it)
---
He's probably getting downvoted because nobody understands the joke.
---
I play for fun and I couldn't care less about "meta" "winrate" "viability" and anything that has to do with winning. I just do the daily challenges, have fun, play the survivors and perks i want and that's it. v.v
---
This, of course, doesn't remove that fact that this game is heavily unbalanced under multiple points of view and that the developers seem uncapable of coming out with a reasonable solution.
---
Isn't it the same with Legion?
---
True. I've heard about that, something about using both the mouse and the keybinds. Guess it's another console nurse vs pc nurse situation then.
---
You asserted a claim without any proof to back it up then you came at me because I ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt specify what I was talking about in my og‚Äô comment. You‚Äôve been kinda aggressive in this entire exchange, so it‚Äôs kinda hard not to think you‚Äôre trying to get into some sort of argument. I didn‚Äôt say they should do one thing instead of nothing else, but this game has a lot of improvements and quality of life issues that it needs updates on that they can do instead of pumping out another chapter right after Cursed Legacy,
---
I really love legion despite being frowned upon. Killer Instinct is probably the dirtiest power, it's a free detection after a guaranteed stab. Although i really miss my Dark devotion surprise legion :( it would've been a nice combo with Nemesis.
---
Yeah she did and even accounting her obsession with Kramer she didn't listen to him scolding her
---
Or if it's a midgame with a lot of broken pallets already
---
I was half expecting I Like Boys by Todrick but this is better
---
HURR DURR NEA IS THE KILLER HUHUHU IS FUNNI
---
It‚Äôs called going in the woods
---
Is this an original? Cause this is unique
---
Climbing as Survivor is also alot easier, almost too easy in my opinion, while as a killer you need to sweat alot more
---
Where was that tattoo made?
---
Why are people up in arms about keys?
---
To be fair neither of them are as cheesy and downright BS as Spirit or Nurse can be. Sure Billy is cheap and instasaw can eat a buffet of wieners and Freddy with 3 gens and pop is just as bad a Doctor doing it but at least neither of them ignore basic game mechanics.
---
IMO if they want actual variety on all ranks the should start giving us alternatives in the rest of the cast (please don¬¥t screw up my boi Doc BHVR), and then I¬¥m open to any nerf to the top tiers.
---
I develop an extreme hatred for everyone on my team when I see noone even attempting to come and I am almost half way on the hook......
---
also another hate when I feel like my timer goes down fast AF but other ppl's timer last until the Second Coming
---
What about huntress?
---
Idk if this just a console thing, but Freddy is arguably the strongest killer. Up there with Billy
---
Yea this game is optimized like garbage, also..too many fucking times i crashed while the game was loading
---
I even posted it a month ago and it's not just me, i see it happening to streamers aswell

---
You literally just proved my point. You have to actually do shit to pip. If what you say is true and your friend is able to farm enough points off overly altruistic survivors at red ranks, then those survivors are dogshit. Don't blame the killer for doing what works
---
Why bring knife to a gunfight?

It's pretty much to give solo survivors similar info to SWF, part of the whole "bridging the gap between them" thing. Oni is the same.

Thank
---
Well, they don't need to be "grouped" together the same way, just that they're close enough for Feral Frenzy to last long enough to let them get the stab in.
---
I dont have an opinion on Tru3 whatsoever  but just reading the part where you mentioned he essentially attributes his losses to game issues and not possibly anything himself could have done is such a complex in and of itself. And that's not just a problem with him obviously but I just find it so telling if a player's reason for losing is never themself.
---
Aren't\*
---
They don't need to be "grouped" together the same way for multiple instadowns either?
---
People that don't play killer at purple ranks+, will never understand this sentence
---
I personally don't like legion but some people think he is fun and that's truly why u should play a killer not bc they are strong
---
Op we have the same pf and i was very confused for a sec
---
Butt status : clenched
---
Who you get is ultimately up to you, but I can say that personally legion isn‚Äôt the most fun to play. I‚Äôd recommend oni or plague. Those are the two DLC I‚Äôve had the most fun with.
---
If they could stop yelling "BRO" every second, would stop screaming for no reason and would even make an EFFORT to realise that his isn¬¥t just "build upwards and shoot the bad guys" I would even like to see them continue playing. I have nothing against new players that got in this game via Ninja and his friends since I wouldn¬¥t play against them right away, but holy jeebus do they have to work on their attitude.
---
Idk if this is a console thing but Freddy and Billy have been performing better than she has even a bit before the nerf
---
r/awfuleveything
---
MYC on legion eeh
---
Opposite in that I do like them as a killer, but agree- if it seems like fun, go for it, if your just playing "strength" you may miss the fun
---
Pig has been getting nerf after nerf and now she's a Wraith that can't cloak. And they're still nerfing her.
---
Path of Exile
---
You could have just LMB'd her...
---
Well, you shouldn't really heal against Legion anyway. It wastes too much time.  
---
As for Thanatophobia, nothing actually combos well with that overrated piece of garb. The difference it makes is so insignificant that the only use you'll get out of it is if survivors are actually wasting time by healing, which against a Legion they simply just shouldn't.  
---
Smart survivors, which is most red rank survivors in my experience, will just power through it and it will have barely made any difference at all.  
---
Thanatophobia needs to stop being as overrated as it is. Maybe then the devs will finally buff it like they had originally planned to do a few months ago.
---
Cant, it would need to be an stand alone killer. They need a licence for that
---
Those 2 are still good. Yuis perks are for fun builds but nothing  wxceptional
---
The reason why, and it‚Äôs a good one, killers camp during the endgame, is because there‚Äôs not much else to do. Survivors are overconfident and overaltruistic in the end game. If you chase a different survivor they‚Äôll just run you to one of the exit gates while you get hook saved by someone else and then you proceed to run to the other exit gate. The killer then has instead of +1 kill no kill.  
---
The higher rank you get, the more altruistic survivors become. In 100% of my games in purple and red ranks survivors come back to try and save someone on the hook in the end game. That‚Äôs why I stay near the hook. UNLESS I can 100% guarantee I get another down, I won‚Äôt leave hook.  
---
Facecamping is something completely different, it‚Äôs a bad tactic as you can‚Äôt see around you.  
---
I will however patrol around the hook and go back. There‚Äôs no reason other than to lose out on a kill if I do leave.
---
They're both equally Cool

---
I mean, a lot of the things you just mentioned were new to me as well when i just started playing. I had no idea that Jungle gyms and meat three were strong loops. I got to rank 6 in my first month playing. And i thought every single killer was pretty OP. When i got better at looping I started to see how you can actually waste a lot of the killers time. I also thought a lot of addons were crazy OP. 
---
Shame that he is being kinda toxic from what i understand. But if you don't frequent this Sub you might not know people look down on toxic behavior specifically in this game. So let's just hope he changes that and brings new eyes to the game.

---
His Deep Wounds nerf was greatly exaggerated and his ability to hunt folks down in Feral Frenzy was buffed.  Yeah he'll melt to a super tryhard squad but what Killer doesn't unless you bring a Mori or go full tryhard back?  
---
To me the mechanic feels fun and strategic without being too oppressive unless perked/addon'd out for heavy game delay.  He's also great at accruing bloodpoints and is my goto farmer because of it.  
---
That said Legion really could use a rework at some point IMO so multiple members are utilized in a match instead of just being cosmetic options.  But for now Legion's in a decent enough spot where those who know what they're doing can still perform quite well with 'em.
---
Especially since it allows to completely ignore DS, a very meta perk, and just tunnel everyone down one by one.
---
Ebony moris are broken. 
---
Used one on my very first Oni match just to see the mori, played like a potato at red ranks (could manage to down someone with his power like two times maybe, played it like a M1 killer otherwise), with bad perks (no ruin, pop level 1, bbq level 1, nurse calling level 2)... Ez 4K thanks mori, I know for a fact I wouldn't have gotten any kill without it. Felt bad afterwards.
---
Just add a dab that should answer everything
---
Don't worry it also shows on PC too. I get an unexpected error everytime I leave a game. It doesn't effect rank/ bloodpoints or anything, but it just shows that BHVR is more interested in putting a band-aid on the game than they are actually addressing the fundamental issues wrong with it.
---
killer totally tunneled you there
---
The fact that you¬¥re asking the community if your behaviour was okay because you care about the enjoyment for the killer makes this 0% toxic. Its the intention that makes the action.
---
Fuck ninja dude
---
He has a point, the other day I had 3 killers in a row who wanted to farm grabs or traps for the rift. It's nice to get points, but also i do sometimes want to play the game, not fuck about grinding BP
---
It happened to me yesterday. Unlucky spawn next to ruin which I didn't notice and Gen that I started working on. Killer was right on my ass, and another survivor unhooked me close to killer without BT so I got downed again and hooked back on hook. Things calmed down after that, got rescued and healed, cleared ruin and popped a Gen. My other survivors were playing with killer (I'm guessing swf), until one died. Then killer was back on my ass, hit me once, and I knew pallets around me are gone and no hope of winning for me, so I stopped and looked at killer. Killer nodded at me and left me, I was following, he refused to kill me. He killed other two and let me get the hatch. After match I asked why me, he replied that at least I tried after such a bad start, and other three did nothing other than annoy him. TLDR: Life is good.
---
I played Pig against a Team of Fengs and Yuis yesterday.
---
The entire match sounded like someone let a rat run havoc at a girls sleepover
---
Could you not bring DS for 5 minutes?
---
I saw nothing impressive here.
---
A patch dedicated to map, killer, and survivor balancing, bug fixes, QoL updates, and overall health is exactly what the game needs and has needed for months if not a year or so now. Sadly though, BHVR is never gonna give up a chapter of profits for the game's longevity. It's a fucking shame.
---
Just add text chat mid-game. Let the toxicity flow! :D /s
---
For legion switch out make your choice for bamboozle
---
You staring into my soul
---
In no way is this asshole that camps my friend but when he runs dying light, thana, plagues perk(can never remember the name, the one that covers gens for like a min) and ruin theres not much u can do to speed through gens so  at least 3 get out no at least 2 people will die to himand he gets to keep his rank and im not going to sit there on a gen the whole game while my mate bleeds to death on a hook, me and my mates have a if one can get out we all will, and it is his fault 100% because how is sitting infront of a hook all game any fun, the point of games are to have FUN (and u effectively called every survivor ever dogshit btw because they cant help hes a camper)
---
#Make_Legion_Good_Again!
---
Nemisis I believe
---
My dude, you got a youtube channel?
---
They look super different my boy
---
It was new to me too, I'm not blaming him for being new at the game. We all got to start somewhere and DBD is drastically different than Fortnite or Apex.
---
It's the t-bagging at pallets, "this dude is trash", and the toxic post game chat he engaged in that was the problem.
---
Uuhhhh
---
You guys are getting matches?
---
I had a guy insta quit on me as Freddy the second he saw me then he said "P3 freddy lol get a life"
---
I have yet to see a wild Quentin main show up in my games. I have 200 hrs on the game and tbh have maybe seen Quentin max 5 times
---
I need to make a memey rulebook album for this sub tbh. This'll be the first page.
---
I wish dbd devs will make a community ban vote only for streams so some one like ninja wont cuz even more toxicity in the game
---
Ahoy
---
I Agree 100%
---
What are some other recommended perks? I'm liking self-care still.
---
Also I tried the Oni killer today and I'm very terrible at the role. It's hard to keep track of the survivors!
---
Tbh i wish i knew how to draw good art instead of posting memes, regardless have my upvote!
---
i think one reason for all the new stuff, minus licenses because they do cost money is that the game seems to be their only source of income. fixing it just prolongs it's death but keeping it alive by adding new stuff essentially expands it more. while it's just not the best model, it feels like the model they are working off of given Deathgarden failed to regain an audience.
---
it was posted for the first time like 3 weeks ago
---
I‚Äôm just gonna say it. The first Fred movie was a cinematic masterpiece
---
Gone are the days when you DH the moment you hear the killer about to swing.
---
Billy would have been there 5 seconds earlier
---
I did the same and thought it worked really well, but now I put it on the mouse wheel instead, way better
---
GhostFace's bring noed? I don't like that...
---
Use Infectious fright, its amazing if they cleanse and if they don't if they stay grouped and all are injured they are done
---
Sounds like sweaty survivor main propaganda to me
---
But they keep theyre rank if they get one kill
---
The plays are mediocre at best but the music and SFX make it quite enjoyable!
---
*No they don't*
---
Hop on killer right now and try it dude. The rank system does not work that way.
---
The details are impeccable
---
I‚Äôve always had an idea that, rather than totems, a certain number of pallets at the start have some sort of ‚Äúobject‚Äù in the way blocking it, such as a box or crate or whatever, and Survivors have to spend say 10-15 seconds ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù it whilst hitting skill checks in order to make the pallet loop usable. It would also award bloodpoints.
---
Well you could use that to your advantage, before sneaking up to someone make some noise so they think your in chase.
---
That‚Äôs low key cool sounding
---
Same it‚Äôs just fun to play him you know
---
And as ive said theres no way im just going to leave my mate on a hook and leave without trying. Even if im solo queuing theyre still my mate so i still have to try. And no thanks im off for the night and i wouldnt ruin a survivors game because i want to prove a point
---
‚ÄúThinked‚Äù
---
Yes, look at it's nails sis üíÖ.
---
If you go frame by frame you can actually see him coming from the left side (When meg is looking at the wall)
---
Good opportunity to run mad grit
---
Stab up
---
Cool idea not so cool when RNG cucked u
---
I'm in this picture and I'm okay with it.
---
r/wooosh
---
Ok well have fun throwing the game. But please stop complaining when you refuse to get better
---
Strange tactic, but it works for me about 80%:
---
If you switch from One to the Other, restart the Game. For some reason i can¬¥t even comprehent the loading time gets super short
---
What are u on bruh just leaving as soon as u get the chance dosent make u better
---
They didn‚Äôt remove the speed burst. Maybe you‚Äôre used to the good addons?
---
can‚Äôt be banned for being toxic, unless you‚Äôre exploiting a glitch or something.
---
What makes you think that is the case?
---
https://www.twitch.tv/scottjund/clip/PowerfulBusyRadishGOWSkull
---
That flick at cowtree is both 180¬∞ and registers on a target within 180¬∞, and this is one of countless such examples.
---
I like it but saying freddy mood makes me feel like ya wanna kidnap kids
---
Just sit on the gens, unhook/heal and run a bit around killer and you easily get to red.
---
Is that deadpool ?üòÇ nah thats dope man
---
;)
---
Ah.
---
But still, you looked.
---
I feel like my mouse buttons have been degrading since I started spamming dbd a few months ago. I always end up jamming down my mouse buttons when having to hold them for long periods of time.
---
indeed
---
15 seconds, I believe?
---
If you pallet slam her when she has corrupt purge it takes it off her just so you know
---
It certainly can happen, though. I have ran the killer for good chunks of time to only see  a bunch of immersed dodos doing nothing. No totems, no gens, just pure ineptitude.
---
However, I never screech in the end game chat about it. The internet has too many pieces of shit trying to make others feel like crap as it is, so I let it go, and try to be better at losing the killer next time.
---
Excellent play
---
 Eh, I doubt it.
---
I hope it does well, since competition is always good but honestly I feel like they're going to fuck it up a second time. Considering not much has changed from the new gameplay video.
---
Yeah yeah, we heard that with friday 13 and this game before already, vevy believable
---
One of the recent posts that made the front page while stuck also said that all the survivors saw the killer idle in a completely different location, I believe just kind of attacking an exit gate? It's entirely possible that if this killer is frozen/trapped/otherwise stuck, they don't even know they're really in front of the hook.
---
K i agree there, that is feeding them points. But. Huge but as ive said..... im. Not. About. To. Leave. My. Mate. On.  The.  Hook. 
---
And     starting     to     get    it    ha         right
---
I think he‚Äôs talking about how right now item charge add ons don‚Äôt work whether it‚Äôs keys medkits or flashlights (i haven‚Äôt tested toolboxes but I think they don‚Äôt work either) I also saw a post saying it‚Äôs all survivor add ons but I haven‚Äôt confirmed this.
---
I think it's wrong to bait survivors out with an afk/idle survivor who is just going to be thrown back on the hook and die due to not being present to struggle, they're already 1v3, why do have to suffer you camping on top of it? That's a dick move even 1v4.
---
I don‚Äôt even have any green keys because why would I bother getting them from the web, ended up having to use 3 ired ones :(
---
It's a two way street. If you camp or tunnel me or another survivor on thier first hook for no reason? I will be using "cheesy infinites" because you used cheesy and scummy tactics.
---
Dead by daylight does not have aim assist, when a survivor intersects with your attacking hit box the game makes your face that survivor directly and then does a direct line check, if something is in between you and the survivor you‚Äôll thunk. That‚Äôs just how the game works, and it‚Äôs something you must be mindful of.
---
The game was already good , its more like can you really suceed when you launch your game on the discord store
---
#DONT GIVE PLAG THE WINE
---
We don't know for sure who did the killing blow so it's safe to assume none of them killed anyone until proven guilty. üëç
---
If he doe's it again, was he talking to anyone in the actual dbd commnunity? I mean it's all good if he brings a bigger audience, the more people playing and enjoying the game the better, right? I mean nobody should gatekeep, but it might be better if some of the bigger (More mature) names in the dbd streaming community, eased him into it. so to speak.
---
Garbage build, wastes too much time.
---
How immersive. A 6 inch tower of bones blocks your path.
---
Guess it's a dedicated server issue because you definitely still get a speedboost
---
Someone who acts like that shouldn't be allowed to talk to the public
---
Did she get the pallet save or not?

The upvote to downvote ratio is the same. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
I guess they can't stand losing. If they won then I probably would've gotten a message saying "gg ez get good, you're a shit killer"
---
Where's the sound?
---
Kill the Shape
---
No. He killed the first one and trapped the last three.
---
Template?
---
Can i get banned for using this?
---
I generally assume anyone bad at closing the gap after the first successful hit is a candidate for NOED, unless they have sufficient map pressure/slowdown potential to account for their longer chases.
---
**Wraith** and **Pig** tend to be prime candidates, **Huntress** also tends to be REALLY bad in the endgame (especially since with 40 meters of warning you know which gate is safe to open and get 10\~ seconds of opening it for free) and the movement speed boost helps her since she's 110%. I'm not generally upset if **Trapper** runs it, because he has no time to reposition his power in the endgame and needs something to compensate for how many counters it has.
---
**Legion/Doctor/Plague** also tend to get looped until daylight, but I'm usually only used to seeing it on Legion, Plague and Doctor have other perk/addon combinations to drag the 3-gen or 4-gen out in their favor, while Legion's power falls off akin to Trapper's power.
---
Anyone else running NOED just kind of disappoints me when I get hit by it, but I do try and cleanse every totem just in case.
---
Operation H E A L T H
---
she dropped it instantly... not even trying
---
Would you rather:
---
1. Make looking around easier, help people getting headaches from low fields of view, make adjusting sensitivity actually possible and bring options up to the standards
---
Or
---
2. Keep it as is cuz killer is meant to feel claustrophobic
---
?
---
I agree with you. All the toxic stuff is unnecessary if he actually wants to be part of this community.
---
Plot twist: killer anticipates it and smack you back to ground as soon as you get up.
---
Finally, a place where I can main Legion in peace.
---
The game before I ran calm spirit, lithe, Quick and Quiet, and bond. I ran neta that game because I was with some lower level players and I felt like I would‚Äôve needed them more
---
Some of it they probably refuse to implement because it would be used to gain an advantage. Increasing the Field-of-View for example is a clear advantage, that interferes with game mechanics that are designed around the limited FoV, such as not being able to keep visual track of a survivor while breaking a pallet, vaulting a window, in Nurse fatigue, and so on. Flashlight-blinding angles also depend on FoV. People would just crank their FoV up as much as possible, and it would change the game experience and gameplay completely. (It's already possible to gain more vertical FoV through changing aspect ratio, but it's only very few players that actually do this.)
---
While graphic settings should be limited to the individual changing of quality between the existing low, medium, high and ultra modes for the respective graphical elements, you can already individually adjust them through game files now, and it is ridiculous that the game in this day and age does not offer this via the in-game menu (which is especially unfortunate for consoles, of course). Anti-aliasing might be an exception, and people should be able to completely disable it. V-Sync is another thing that absolutely should be an in-game option, all the more so because the game runs in windowed fullscreen by default, which doesn't need V-Sync due to desktop compositing already preventing screen tearing. Being able to switch the game into true fullscreen mode and thus also to set an exact resolution rather than only having a scaler also has to be an option. It is bullshit for a game of this popularity not to have rudimentary options like this, indeed, especially because game performance is integrally important for its gameplay experience.
---
They actually had a question about more advanced graphic settings in one of their surveys, and I was optimistic a change like that would come for that reason, but alas, only the monetization bits from the surveys made it.
---
Wait for reset and then try to rank up, once I got to green ranks it went from 20 min to like 1-2 minutes
---
Yeah, their ego is like a balloon, they would explode if they would admit that someone was better than them.
---
Yeah thats the protocol, but this guy for no reason whatsoever wanted to let me escape. Even tho when it was just me and him, I took the aggro from the killer.
---
The chase lasted a good 35-40 seconds with injured me and I took the killer far enough that he could have finished last gen with the box he was carrying by the time killer find him. But no, he just crouched in a corner, no where near hatch btw, to wait for me to die.
---
Oof, that must hurt. I've only been blocked once by accident and im all the way down in rank 13, it was by a guy doing that steady landing loop in the lab who accidentally landed in front of me.
---
i only try to befriend them if more than one person dc‚Äôs and we still have gens to fix .. once someone disconnects it ruins the flow, they can‚Äôt get their 4 kills and we most likely won‚Äôt win because we still have broken gens. so i teabag or drop my item and don‚Äôt run, i‚Äôve gotten maybe 2 games where the killer is chill and we farm then i let him kill me after (or they let me escape sometimes).
---
Except when you're playing Trapper and pull off a mathematically impossible feat like a 4k.
---
Don't think we've forgotten that legit Trapper 4ks have been proven in over two million case studies of the best players to be impossible, even if the survivors are playing with their eyes closed the entire time.
---
Next time, just quit and report him then.
---
r/stabbygang
---
It's a good mori, but creative? Not really
---
i can imagine that actually XD
---
No joke I started a match, came up to a gen that had been worked on, so no scratch Mark's or anything so i decided to check the locker next to it for kicks...
---
Claud DCed as soon as my hand grabbed her throat.
---
here's [my youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbJpUQiJ9sdbPPMN4lKtYlQ?) im glad you enjoyed it :)
---
How do you do that?
---
Well I'm rank 8 and ran hex: ruin, barbecue and chili, agitation, and bamboozle. To be honest they played really bad. They unhooked each other just as soon as I hooked them, they also kept on running into my traps, and I didn't even have to find them because they kept on running into me
---
Is that Borat?
---
Kill everyone.
---
Guess that works
---
I think spit already is acid, it's just not a particularly strong acid.
---
Well spoken.
---
Well it wouldn't be a 4k if they were a 4-man SWF using a third-party-program for a competitive advantage because they'd just have the benefit of Kindred without running it, wouldn't they?
---
Hex: imminent doom
---
He could have been good for Deathgarden. RIP
---
Thanks, I'm usually not well known for my speaking skills
---
Wow it takes like a whole 20 seconds for it to open when the 2nd to last survivor gets final hooked
---
Today on: This game is gonna kill dbd Part 5
---
He's still complete trash in high rank. I mean completely useless. Unless the survivors are dumbfucks somehow.
---
ok but why is ghostface grouped in with actually good killers
---
"Ba humbug bitch."
---
When your night shroud is on cooldown
---
Ok thats just disgusting pls stop
---
I think I‚Äôll try last year will I play it more then DBD? No probably not but I remember when it was on kick starter and thought it was so cool
---
you do realize that trophy is not from dbd?
---
It was a bug as well in 2016, where anyone could exploit a glitch to do it and shenanigans ensued. Lots of extremely old bugs seem to be coming back lately.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever actually seen a Ghostface with noed. It‚Äôs always Doctors, Trappers, and Legions running it for me
---
I sand bagged my friend on accident once and the killer face camped me because of it and let them escape. Even tho it was an accident in the killers eyes it was justice so I wasnt mad.
---
I don't care what nobody says
---
That sucks. He's got a good design and has decent perks and a good backstory too. Can't go wrong with Jeff
---
That looks so perfect on skin. Awesome one, I believe it will stay great for a long time
---
Hm not that your saying it... Pig hasn't been nerfed for quite a while now (atleast two weeks!!!) we better shorten the time it takes to search for a key.
---
theres literally a post about the balanced landing nerf in top rn with survivors agreeing it was broken
---
Yeah and Evan didn‚Äôt kill hundreds in the mine until proven otherwise.
---
As soon as you stop bringing adrenaline
---
You think asking them to stop will make them stop? If only that were how humans work.
---
I never even used it much before the nerf so idrc about it
---
I play killer and survivor floating between red and purple rank. As a survivor in these ranks I rarely see legion but when I was green rank there was a legion killer constantly and your teammates would just call it quites just getting whatever points they could before getting hooked. As a killer I don‚Äôt even play legion cause even perkless I can hook all survivors with ease. He‚Äôs a bit boring imo and I prefer more of a challenge rather than mindless slashing but whatever floats your boat.
---
Repost? Um, ok
---
Taking credit? Na ah
---
OMG how dare you play a game as trapper on Hawkins!!  I‚Äôm going to make sure you get banned, oh I‚Äôm going on the dead by daylight page right now and boom just reported you enjoy your bam your so trash please die
---
What the fuck is that chin
---
I'm a pretty bad killer anyway. I have trouble seeing ppl. So doc kinda helps.
---
They probably thought he was hacking
---
Anyone else get a Quentin vibe from Yui?
---
And ? I get free Bloodpoints
---
honestly as a killer its easy to tell when this actually is happening, I try to let that guy live if I can help it. I understand their rage, and post game, if it makes em feel better, eh go for it. Doesnt change the results, but if it helps you accept them then thats great
---
2 kills, 2 escapes should be the ideal situation.
---
Exactly.
---
I will admit this much: best theme
---
I‚Äôm a Claudette main, but I‚Äôm not toxic, people always make fun of me for being a character in the game that is hated by the community, they are always like‚Äùaren‚Äôt you supposed to be hiding in bushes?!‚Äù  I got hate the other day for apparently not doing anything, I did 2 gens, saved teammates and healed them, and looped the killer around a building 4 times on haddonfield, I have video evidence
---
I don‚Äôt mind if he plays and draws more players to the game, but I cant stand that he‚Äôs encouraging toxicity.
---
I gotta OP Freddy build to help you rank up my man. PM me
---
They limited the turn rate of the flick, i. e. the turn speed, which does practically also affect the amount of rotation players can usually get, but there's no reason to assume the flick doesn't actually also register up to that amount of rotation. I think what you experience is just that the flick has a wider registry cone and/or will register if there's a target at any point during the flick.
---
Even if the initial turn here is partly dash steering, in practice it increases the effective "flick" range. Doesn't get much more close-quarter and tight-cornered than this cowtree flick example, and so whether part of what allows him to hit that is steering of the dash or not, since such flicks around such tight corners are possible, it is balance-relevant.
---
Personally I think that if the flick needs an adjustment, it's decreasing the reach of the strike attack itself, i. e. how far away from the Oni the survivor can be at the time when he starts the flick with M1, in order to still get hit. This only for strikes coming out of dashes, of course. Right now if you start flicking roughly at the shack pallet coming from inside of shack, you can still register on a survivor halfway across shack along the wall. Strikes when coming out of dash seem to have a reach similar to regular lunges, and maybe that should be decreased to make it more fair.
---
I actually got chased for 3/3.5 gens by a camping Leatherface once, they all did generators as I panicked like a dozen times avoiding the chainsaw and I was so proud of them, because I knew I was going to die eventually.
---
Of course I kobe'd off the hook, but that's just luck.
---
Hm?
---
Sauce for this image?
---
I‚Äôm calling the entity.
---
"I'm rank 1 Killer, was playing Legion since chapter release"
---
So you are telling me a killer that you have been playing since release that you can only win a little over half the games you played.
---
I love how people say stuff like "this killer is viable in the right hands" but you know what, so is nurse. if you took the time you put in legion and put it in nurse you would have lost little to no games.
---
Not to mention killer is the easiest its ever been since the SWF rank changes, we have no idea how many non red rank survivors you played against, and if its anything like my experiences you have at least one green or below rank every game or so.
---
The kill rate / popularity analysis chart by the devs, all ranks and red ranks both included as separate stats. Literally in both cases Freddy was on top, though Spirit is played more she doesn't do as good. It was conducted and released by Peanits and the King has a video on it. And this was for PC, and it showed that even on PC Spirit and Nurse don't do as good as you'd expect.
---
memasik
---
Plague main here. Not cleansing can be remedied with Play With Your Food (Vile Purge doesnt consume tokens, so you only need 1 token per down). Infectious works well wether they cleanse or not, and thanatophobia can edge them towards cleansing, or suffer a speed penalty. Pleague can get away with stacking 4 different slowdown perks as her only weakness is being genrushed.
---
I personally prefer them to not cleanse, as im shit at tracking but sick survivors are a breeze to track down.
---
Ikr, pretty genius. The detail is so precise too as if its done by machine
---
Legion is constantly ragged on as boring or bad because of their power. However, I believe that Feral Frenzy is actually quite good, you just have to not use it the way that seems obvious. 
---
I generally only Frenzy a few times per match. I usually do one at the very beginning, just to get a hit on as many people as possible. I'll do one or two to cross the map quickly if I know there are people on a gen from Disco, or I got a Thrill of the Hunt notification. After that, though, I generally only do it if I'm having trouble finding people, because what Legion does best is information. Knowing on-demand where people are within or slightly beyond your terror radius is very good. I get a lot of locker grabs with Killer Instinct, and while people bitch about the stun, it's not that bad. You can still walk slowly and turn during it, meaning you can usually track a survivor through it. Make sure you're hot on someone's trail before you end the Frenzy and you'll generally still win the chase. It's also fun to throw survivors off by frenzying over the pallet they've just dropped sometimes. 
---
What this amounts to is that Legion is a highly mobile killer that excels at locating targets, and that just gets scarier with some good information perks. I'll freely admit that they're not necessarily the best at either target location or mobility, but the hybrid of the two they create is unique in my experience with the killers. Putting that on top of their excellent aesthetic and adding in the fun of pinballing around the map to get all four survivors in one Frenzy, and you've got a pretty enjoyable killer. 
---
As an aside, Legion isn't nearly as bad as people say he is -- I trend around rank 9/10 killer and still usually get 3/4ks, depending on hatch. I know that doesn't make me top tier or anything, but I get thrown against purple rank survivors pretty often, so. *shrug*

Open sesame!
---
It's my own po set I didn't even know
---
do you realize how rare is a front grab interrupt? very rare, we only get 'em from back.
---
That was a nice play, good job.
---
Hex: We're not Gonna Live Forever
---
He, he, he, with NOED those 5 min. are up to the survivors.
---
Why did you bring up that dead meme
---
KILLER REVEALED +500
---
Now that dedicated servers are a thing, isn‚Äôt it now not possible for the killer to lag survivors out?
---
Doesn't Freddy kinda already rock an "ugly sweater"?
---
what is NOED? New to the game and Main a Doctor for killer, about to reach rank 15 and his level is 17 now.  I finally figured out what MORI was when i saw it and am not sure why people dont like it that much, doesnt seem that bad to me from either perpective.
---
Oh shit *jumps out of window*
---
If you could hold down, it wouldn't be a struggle anymore
---
And that sweet points of hooking/sacrificing.
---
 the logo still awesome though
---
why?
---
Wow ultimate bait.
---
God aweful idea in every way
---
13-14sec. Starts at 8sec, hatch opens at 22sec.
---
Legion cannot see where someone is in their deep wounds timer, just that they have it. It will read as full until they mend it or go down. This is also true of other killers when triggering borrowed time or the styptic agent.
---
Hex: No One Escapes Death. Boosts your speed a little and insta-downs a survivor on hit
---
Happy cake day
---
Resilience + spine chill for the vault speed, the exhaustion perk of your choice, and maybe iron will for safe looping even while injured maybe
---
‚ÄúBrutal killer‚Äù.
---
occasionally there will be a fence that spawns on one side of the map near one of the houses with a VERY long walk around and a window so you will lose chase every time, so the window never entity blocks.
---
Fun to play, possibly the least fun killer to play against.  Both before and after the changes.  They need to rework their whole idea.
---
then he just becomes a worse Huntress
---
did this guy just watermark a meme on reddit?
---
This is a dream come true for the devs.
---
Yeah during end game and camping killers is fine. But for example, I have kindred, and im on the hook. Killer is chasing David and meg is hiding behind a rock near me. Instead of leading the killer away so meg can get the rescue, david makes a bee line for me and rescues me and insta down for me. David is also injured fyi and he leads the hag past meg who then gets hit too. David fucks off to the other side of the map, meg gets downed and hooked then killer comes back to hook me. Im seeing this sort of thing more or less every match and its pissing me off, i wish i could refuse to be rescued!
---
incredible! 5/5 voms, would cleanse again
---
Holy shit, that's fantastic! Good job!
---
Thats not the point. Its the fact that they can continue doing the objective while being completely invurnerable.
---
ive always loved the DBD logo
---
At red ranks? I almost never see Bamboozle. Usually it's dying light, thana, and ruin. Usually a combination of those 3 on freddy. I have been seeing more infectious fright and corrupt intervention though.
---
I'd take this over lack of sense any day.
---
Yeah I don't like the dude much either so I just... Don't watch him? I don't understand OP's point
---
Yeah, I've noticed that too.
---
Yeah I can see that.
---
Yes, yes i did
---
Just no but also glass shards vs hatchet to the back of your spine or neck yea I'd say glass shards would be annoying but not deadly
---
Dbd already killed that game, its going to happen again.
---
The only game that even stood a chance was F13 and that game killed itself.
---
David should be completely unaffected by this then since he's a barroom brawler :)
---
Hex: NOED rework; Hit one Survivor, and down him along with the other 3 in the Dying State, then get the ability to Mori all 4 of them
---
It is because it counters DS, bodyblocking and sabotaging.
---
What's wrong with moris?
---
What's wrong with landmark loops?
---
Jungle gyms don't exist anymore
---
I thought last year looked neat and I‚Äôd try it out on steam. But there is absolutely no way it‚Äôs gonna kill DBD.
---
Hulking giant of a bunnygirl.
---
Well how would u know they are doing it on purpose? Maybe they think their team mate can take a hit for them to get more distance which is a smart thing
---
When Micheal is in tier 3, if you drop the shack pallet on him while he‚Äôs swinging, he‚Äôll fall down, then if you have a toolbox, you can interact with him, then you press the interact button to drag him, you‚Äôll need another survivor to lift him up on a hook tho
---
and why?
---
Dance with Me, Lithe, Spine Chill, Resilience. Vault speed plus a speed boost and your hidden makes it much harder for killers to bloodlust you and has the chance of making you more likely to win chases and escape them for a while.
---
I thought the same thing about SB until I realized I could control the burst of speed 99% of the time after the first. As long as you're sprinting, exhaustion doesn't cooldown. So I would run around with exhaustion at 1%, and then when a chase is about to start, walk for a second and then burst. I've recently been giving BL and SB a good attempt because I'm so frustrated with how DH is acting with dedicated servers. I already knew lithe was amazing.
---
No last year will not kill dead by daylight. This is coming from a fan of the game since the beginning
---
You have objectively bad taste.
---
**New Survivor:** Ninja  
---
**Teachable Perks**  
---
**THERE USING FUCKING WALL HACKS:** Your aura is never revealed to the killer. "*Man I hate those fuckin wall hackers" - Ninja*  
---
**Killers are fucking OP:** You can never get put into the dying state in one hit, even if exposed. "*HOW THE HELL DID HE ONE TAP ME" - Ninja*
---
**Dude why the hell does that Perk Exist:** All of the killers perks are disabled at the beginning of a match.  *"How does this killer know where I am across the map!" - Ninja*  
---
(P.S. In case you didn't realize, this is a joke)
---
Not quite sure how this is relevant to the post
---
As if shit like this gets this many upvotes
---
Nobody who uses DH, uses it for dodging. I use it to extend loops I'm about to lose, and to get myself to a pallet/window I normally wouldn't be able to make it to.
---
OMG those tense moments are the fucking worst, but it's so good when they pay off.
---
I'm telling you that playing without any tryharding, without Ruin at Rank 1 I managed to win 2/3 of games with 4k as "worst, nerfed to ground Killer" in game.
---
I didnt say "Killer is viable in right hands", I've never said my hands are "right ones"
---
Yep, sometimes it happens when I see green or yellow ranks in games. But most of times it is red and high-purple ranks. You can easily check it on my ttv vods.
---
Then the Clown would just become a slightly stronger Huntress
---
Have you seen the posts about colorblindness in certain maps? Cornfields are especially horrible.
---
But they are not completely invulnerable, unless they jump in a locker but then they arn‚Äôt doing an objective.
---
Hex: We‚Äôre all fucked
---
That‚Äôs what unnerving does.
---
I had that window, it's fucking bullshit, why do they make the fence so damn big?
---
I agree, they're killing at far too high a rate, they need to be brought back down to 50%.
---
I'm mostly talking about the impact itself rather than the remaining glass shards.
---
300 shards per player level.
---
Ok, let me ask you this. What is legions secret technique that makes him so good. what have you figured out about his shit ability that no one else has
---
I use NOED on Huntress because I need that stupid hatchet trophy. 
---
I don't sacrifice anyone mind you when I'm going for it but it usually lets me get a couple end game long-range shots.
---
I was thinking Serj Tankian, but go off
---
May have been an accidental sandbag from her you both were running and under these conditions can lead to actions like that. Thats what I think since the claudette didn't drop the pallet on you forcing you to be hit and letting her run.
---
It's pretty easy with the PlayStation message app, I like to say gg just to surprise people
---
If the teammate is healthy and you are hurt it's actually not that bad, especially if the chased guy is dead on hook. Be a teamplayer, take one for a bro!
---
This. Too many people think that unhooked survivors need to be ignored. When I'm playing killer, if you unhook someone in my face, I'm going to down them to deny you the "safe unhook", then I'll leave them to be picked up by a teammate while I focus your ass down.
---
Also, some people need to realize what the killer is seeing. If I hook someone, and take off to try and find someone else, and you unhook them before I've found someone else? You need to understand that ignoring that unhook is honestly the worst move. I have 0 survivors to chase, and I KNOW someone is over there now. It would be stupid not to go back.
---
you won't notice it if you just don't tunnel ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø.
---
So people won't steal my memes and get more upvotes than me
---
I don‚Äôt think that counts as them working together, just because they ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù ran towards you when getting chased by a heavy clown or a literal Japanese demon
---
And guess what? System can't ban those because struggle is a in game mechanic that you can fail, kobe is valid in game mechanic. So they can say "hey cunt, you suicided on hook 20 times in a row, be banned" and people can just say "hey, I tried to kobe and opsy daisy I missed the bar space, get fucked *reverse uno card*"
---
Bhvr needs to remove struggle asap
---
Because GhostFace is a good killer
---
What are you on about?
---
SB is annoying to deal with, yes, but it's nowhere near "broken"
---
Look at the size of that mustache. He could sweep a barbershop floor with that thing, Christ on a bike.
---
nonono oni that is called "stupid luck" or as the toxic survs call it "100% OUTPLAYED"
---
Keep in mind that in regular matches, you won't have all of those perks to help your chases if you don't actually bring all of them. So I'd suggest only using the perks that you actually use in regular matches as well. Or you could go perkless to practice raw chase skills.
---
That said, here are the most relevant chase perks when looking at a 1V1 in isolation: Exhaustion perks (Sprint Burst, Lithe, Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Head On - any 1 of these can reasonably be used, but Lithe and DH are the most reliably useful ones in isolated chases (or SB if you 99% it, and in combination with Fixated and/or Vigil; BL can be okay depending on the map; Head On pretty much needs Quick &amp; Quiet to be used in chases with any reliability)), Iron Will, Resilience + Spine Chill, Windows Of Opportunity, Quick &amp; Quiet. Alert, Dance With Me, Fixated, Vigil and Lightweight can also be mentioned, but they have more "niche" chase utility. In regular games perks such as Adrenaline, Hope, Poised, Dark Sense help you in your chases as well, of course.
---
Survivors are just skins
---
This is unfortunately a game about vision and being able to pick small colors and shades out at a distance. As someone with Deuteranopia, and a brother with MUCH worse, I get it. I really do man. Adding in some colorblind options would just create so many issues with balance that it would just radically change the game. This is unfortunately a problem we have to deal with.
---
Steve and Dwight are the best Survivors because they come with a hidden perk where you'll get pity hatch at the end of the game 75% of the time as long as you bait your team mates and suck at loops.
---
Lol last year been dead for awhile
---
Rank means nothing but playtime.
---
When they finish the last gen and everybody becomes sonic with wolverine's healing properties
---
Or Borat.
---
I hope you mean abysmal by OP, which i agree. 
---
Spirit can get genrushed ig, but in chase she has complete control, a good spirit can end a chase in under 30 secs.
---
I only DC when I get sandbagged, so I‚Äôll be taking my 5 year ban penalty now
---
I love the idea of sloppily stabbing people a million times and making them bleed out. Too bad that now it's more like stab, stab, get knocked the fuck out for like a minute, follow the blood, find them, two gens pop, then finally down the guy when they decisive strike your ass and you get teabagged.
---
Can you just scroll the wheel?
---
They decided to release a new update. Doubt it will kill DBD though
---
If you think that the team that designs the art/assets/DLC releases is the same team that bugfixes and codes then you don't understand the issue. They ALWAYS have people bugfixing, and updating code. Just because they're releasing chapters doesn't mean it isn't being done.
---
Noob here, how does one use a green key?
---
David is good for new players to farm bloodpoints
---
Bill's perks are just better overall
---
How can you miss a pallet save this hard claud
---
If they are dead on hook... Why not?
---
I usually try and take a hit.
---
Yeah... no.
---
Here are all the reasons Last Year will NEVER beat DBD:
---
Michael Myers, Leatherface, Freddy Krueger, Saw, Ghostface, Stranger Things.
---
I heard it‚Äôs on steam now
---
Scroll up. The people who make art/assets aren't the same people bugfixing. They have different teams, different schedules, and different goals.
---
This, but Clown. I will never give up the girthquake.
---
You're talking about perks, survivor has nothing to do with it.
---
You did the worm on exit.
---
Its broken. Its by far the best exhaust perk in the game. And im not scared to get downvoted for saying that, bc its true. people who disagree only use it in worst way possible.
---
Where do u find that? Like sources? I'm just wondering
---
People dont really like mori because the best offering for it "Ebony Momento Mori" which allows you to mori any survivor who has been hooked once
---
Always gotta take it into account
---
But u see they don't care where the killer goes as long as it is away from their team mate that they just want points from
---
You really don't but ok.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e8apb2/can_anyone_give_me_a_clear_answer_if_the/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
The reason most people dont like moris is because it gives a killer a free kill. I tend to see the person just tunnel someone after them getting unhooked meaning that player will get killed 3 minutes into the match. Not really fair to that player.same reason people dont really like keys, gives the players a free escape, it tends to be harder though since you need most of the gens gone. But if ones dead and you have 3-genned yourself(its when you didnt realize gen locations and the last 3 are all like 30 feet from each other) then you get to use it as a free escape since you made a mistake. What im trying to say is it doesnt matter how good you do, because if the opponent has a key or mori the match could end suddenly even though you did great
---
you can use it for its aura reading abilities but you can‚Äôt use it to unlock the hatch, unlike the other keys :)
---
*chase music starts with nobody nearby*
---
I hate game mechanics that seem to negate all the things I try to do to be a healthy gamer that does not end up screwed by carpal tunnel like disability.
---
so if the unhooked survivor runs at me and do gens in front of me i am tunneling?
---
you wouldn't mind noed if you just do totems lol
---
STBFL is amazing on Hag, but yeah it‚Äôs a bit of a stretch.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, I have 1k hours and still have barely seen any, we will strive though
---
* Having an unintentional resemblance to gameplay elements from Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; ...).
---
I‚Äôve been using Infectious Fright on Billy, it‚Äôs actually really strong on him.
---
Decent body pillows could have been a great start already.
---
Or that feeling when u hit a survivor and they just vanish into thin air
---
Now that‚Äôs a face I could sit on.
---
To be fair, why wouldn't you dc if he did that for hours? Regardless send it to the devs that's bannable
---
It was retconned with the archives and it just look's like the mine collapsed out of fuckin nowhere ruining the cool aspect of Evan's lore.
---
Ok Pig edit pls love the video kthxbye
---
I wouldnt even say it's that good imo. But yeah, Hag, Oni, Demi, and Ghostface are either better or more creative than Legions
---
Sucks you weren't looking at it when it switched.
---
People don‚Äôt really seem to care. A temporary matchmaking ban isn‚Äôt exactly the end of the world.
---
Yeah I meant to say OP on PC and abysmal om console and rushed the thought. And Spirit now isn't quite that efficient now since there is more feedback from her power, and it's much easier to disorient her than before now that there is no more cheap collision hits. Its also easier to tell when she's standing still since her recharge add-ons all got nerfed so experienced people can just gain ground on her now and won't fall for fakeouts.
---
If a loop is one I can‚Äôt win, I ditch the survivor
---
Your safe while doing the loop but you will be forced to leave eventually
---
Yes i scroll my wheel downwards to struggle, works great so far.
---
Failure.
---
Oh, I used a regular mori, I could kill the last survivor myself.
---
ok first of all, that was a joke and second, with no real info on how many totems are left on the map and how bs some of them are to find just saying "Oh just do totems" is a pretty weak excuse.
---
that and along with tunnelling, there is really no downside to doing it.  Some on here with say they wont pip or get as many BP.  But that doesnt really matter to getting a kill, sorry but its true. Most killers who facecamp usually get 2-3 kills, so why not.
---
Playing on Red Forest be like:
---
I feel like this triggers you more than it should.
---
Anyone can also just look up the original template and put the same text. Requires like 1 minute of your time.
---
When one of your illusion doctors spawn right behind you when you pick someone up and you turn around
---
Hehe
---
Just trying to be fair all around.
---
The audio sadly wasn't in this recording since I took this clip is part of my 6 hour stream. I looked at it prior to it turning into a noed totem though, lol.
---
Who the fuck invited David Blaine
---
Probably triggered about post game chat.
---
And there you have the downvoted , kinda proves the points
---
I see where you're coming from this but honestly, I don't think it has any issues besides practically removing stealth from him. I think a much better solution is to have the undetectable status out of teleporting last for much longer, as the audible sounds really help give with the immersion and experience against the demogorgon and also help solo survivors.
---
o/
---
I know others are realistic, I just hate Pig, one of the most boring killers imo and I hate playing against her. Huntress is fine, but I'm not bothering to master her with console controls.
---
Billy with Discordance? 
---
You mean Billy with Tinkerer?
---
Don't work on gens forehead he wouldn't of know she was there otherwise.
---
The more I play Oni the more i tend to think that he's better than Billy
---
if only they'd STOP FUCKING NERFING HIM
---
at this point it's just incomprehensible
---
yea it is called not trusting whatever people say on THE INTERNET if you are gonna call that no having common sense then I really wanna know what your idea of common sense is but it is whatever idrc
---
Meg didnt look behind her ;-;
---
maybe if the game lasts more than something like 20-30 min it just force quits?
---
Dc yourself and let us know if you got banned
---
I love how lex joined Tim Hansen's crew it's so awesome i love their custom zombies videos together
---
Yeah well, fuck you

Hey lex do you want pepperoni pizza?

It's called as common sense. When your teammate is not coming for the save and rotating like a clown, it means that something is up and the only thing that can happen differently in that situation is that that guy had found the hatch.
---
Ps check out please r/synthwaveheads! From now on, I‚Äôll be posting there to avoid cluttering the sub with lists!
---
Lol I said this and got called racist so fuck you guys for upvoting this.
---
Oh neat gotta give that a try
---
mhm, thank you for proving my point.
---
There are multiple ways to use SB effectively, the easiest being 99%'ing it. You can pop it whenever you need, you can use it when you are out of chase so you can lose exhaust while on a gen. 
---
SB is one of the hardest perks to utilize properly. if you only have base knowledge about it, i suggest looking into it. you will be surprised on how amazing it is.
---
_When exit gates open, survivors move 4/5/6% faster but move with 5/10/15% less grace_
---
Hell yes. Legion and Pig are my fave killers, I think. Pig is more viable but Legion is fun; though I feel pretty OP lately even though I only use Discordance and no add-ons (I mostly meme and fuck around when I play killers, or just self impose a 'no ass-ons and only one perk' rule to make it more challenging).
---
Hex: We‚Äôre boned
---
Instead of fixing the map, they nerf the perk.
---
or use the map/key reading exploit
---
Shit wheres my "complains about developers" card
---
A decent nurse will shit over the entire team on PC.
---
Spirit - no need for explanation. If you are a noob in need of 4k, play as her 
---
Oni - Billy on steroids. Will demolish you because there is no counterplay to his bullshit. 
---
I wish I just uninstalled this game because of all the balancing issues.
---
Gg ez
---
Anytime a instadown killer brings noed in just like.....
---
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
What the other person said. Most people never use the green keys becuase, well, you cant do anything with them unless ypu put on addons and at that point its just better to bring a medkit.
---
Just take detectives hunch. Seriously I've denied about 80% of the noeds I'vecome across with the other 20% being because I was the one being chased all game and couldn't cleanse them. It also pairs wonderfully with inner strength as a healing perk.
---
i swear at this point ill immediately leave lobbies as soon as i see someone even trying to use one of the blendette forms.
---
no you are not. You are physically invisible sure, but its like wearing an invisible cloak to hide from someone but you leave a trail of bread crumbs and scream "IM OVER HERE!" every few secs.
---
If you are not running iron will against her you are fucked, and even if she can hear your breathing and footsteps.
---
DONT TELL ANYONE
---
Every once in a while I'll be walking around doing killers things when I find an injured survivor. Can't really explain why but if they crouch and look at me the right way I'm like "yep that one gets the hatch". Then I go back to buisness.
---
I knew DBD was full of degenerates, I just didn't knew how bad till now.
---
I feel so bad for Wraith, he was a good boi :(
---
r/imatotalpieceofshit
---
What, you mean those free cosmetic items Piggy gives away to everybody?
---
I like the idea, but we should change it to if survivors and Killers don't move within a certain small radius, then it does indeed force quit. That way if you're running an epic match that spans longer than 30 minutes, you won't be kicked out
---
I like this very much.
---
Adrenaline is better xd
---
Why? He just told you you're a reposter or Karma whore
---
"Dont forget your hat "
---
*survivor finally takes of rbt after using all jigsaw boxes*
---
"Looks like you dropped your hat, heres another."
---
*that moment when I saved my ds for the end but then get moried*
---
They‚Äôre usually just really sweaty and will do whatever it take to get a 4k, it makes the game super boring and makes red ranks not fun
---
Very mature. Remind me to send you a cake as soon as you're 10yo :)
---
Yup always I get this
---
With how many Oni I've been seeing it gets used every game basically, and with people running infectious it gets used often enough to justify it.
---
It triggers me when it happens to me as a hooked survivor and randos are looping the killer in front of me preventing myself from getting saved.
---
I'm posting this from a killer match because i like to be helpful, and blaming killers for results that were in their hands seems to be frequent enough.
---
also, why not contribute and say what you think of this? has it never happened to you?
---
&gt; unless it‚Äôs needed 
---
1) this very likely means you‚Äôre the person OP is whining about which yiu joined in on
---
2) almost every time someone complains about camping and tunneling that‚Äôs not what happened at all
---
That would be the case if Oni were able to flick like on PC, but that is a factor holding him back a little. Notice: a little. Some people think he's bad, and that's very incorrect.
---
Cool idea, I feel like it would be really useful for newer players.
---
I want her lawyer.
---
Oni just vibing
---
Ahhh a fellow basement trapper
---
If someone is about to hit 2nd state or die, it can be worthwhile to save them even if you lack BT.
---
I think maybe 10-15-20% would be more balanced but I like the idea, especially for beginners üëçüèº
---
my flair has been true all along
---
Chill bro,no need for Insulting. Just tellin' ya' that you did a repost.
---
&gt;Wtf is this shit! I don‚Äôt think ill never reach rank 1 as a survivor. I was addicted and trying to get better. But now it‚Äôs just a dead end. Killers aren‚Äôt better and playing isn‚Äôt more challenging, it‚Äôs a plateau, sucks.
---
Reaching rank 1 isn't a demonstration of skill, specially if you are basically grinding for it and also struggling at it. Once you do get better, you'll reach read ranks even without trying. Hell, depipping will become harder than pipping up.
---
Yeah especially for begginers
---
Survivors doing objective: good
---
Killers doing objective: bad
---
This is the most important commandment in DBD
---
r/sweatypalms
---
yeah dbd PC is such a tunnel fest it's not fun anymore, esp if you are solo surv.
---
i play on xbox with max sensitivity so its a lot easier not as easy as on pc but alot easier
---
I'm absolutely terrible with a flashlight, but need the rift for binding a killer carrying a survivor. Any tips? (PS4)
---
wait until after you either stun them with a pallet, or while they're breaking said pallet. aim for the neck/upper body
---
Am I the only one who lives Fixated, Sprint Burst, and Spine Chill.
---
I though the mine  collapsing on him was his punishment from his father.
---
Didn't you know? Playing the game in general makes you toxic. Even talking about it like we are makes us toxic! /s
---
We're gonna die forever*
---
Self care, no mither, adrenaline, mettle of man, is the chad alpha male big dong gamer set up
---
DBD Killer streamers in general, other than maybe Scott Jund who has a good grasp on both sides of the debate. They all just moan about perks and abilities for survivors, but then play exactly the same way when they're survivor, just not as "optimal".Otz literally made a video about DS being OP the other day and throughout the entire video he never once got DS'd.
---
I've almost thrown my controller out of fear due to being stunned as spirit unexpectedly because her stun sound is horrifying
---
Legion is great I'm sad that he gets nerfed  most of the time

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e8b6va/bug_bloodweb_will_get_stuck_sometimes_after_you/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
That was 100 percent me
---
You're focusing too much on pipping, pipping is separate from completing objectives.  As a survivor you can help get 3 gens up, escape, and still only safety.  Killer's can 2k and depip, that shouldn't happen.
---
Pipping is broken and changes shouldn't be made to other parts of the game based on pipping until it's reworked.
---
Winning for killers getting 4k is like survivors getting 4 escapes. It doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
i mean considering its literally only an anti-ruin ability, and you can still fuck it up, i feel 10/20/30 is fine.
---
Operation Health did wonders for R6 Siege. This game is in dire need of an Operation: Medkit. If they want to continue to monetize this game, they need to make sure its as bug free as humanly possible.
---
Jungle gyms are the structures with the pallet and window. I can tell you have never played in red ranks if you call them landmark loops instead of god loops. Not all landmark loops are god loops, but the ones that are need fixing
---
try to run closer to the structure you are running. it makes you take a shorter passage then what you did in the clip where you are like 5 feet away from the wall
---
why would anyone care? at worse you get banned for idk a week? but not like rage quiters care
---
Yeah, it definitely did work on The Game with all the staircase drops which is the main reason I ran it. Most maps it's way easier to find windows than drops, so I think Lithe is better right now. Sprint Burst is also probably on par with it as long as you don't particularly save it since you can use SB to get away from unsafe gens to get to loops or pallets.
---
I meant in certain situations involving perks/items. Look man I‚Äôm not trying to argue here, I understand why other killers prefer to camp and tunnel etc, that‚Äôs just not my style and not how I like to play. I don‚Äôt enjoy playing against those killers as a survivor either
---
What about ruin and huntress lullaby? That perk would make both useless!
---
I feel like I don‚Äôt get scared nearly as often anymore, it still happens once I‚Äôm a while. When I first started playing my heartbeat would increase with my survivors because it was scary as fuck to hear the terror radius, just isn‚Äôt the same.
---
agreed
---
Hmm, true
---
Billy + NOED go together like... Meg and Dead Hard. It works I guess, but it just doesn't *feel* right.
---
i can't believe im saying this, but i feel like thats kinda low.
---
LOL.
---
I've got 900 hours of play.
---
I've literally only seen one match where someone brought a broken key on purpose, and it was two days ago.
---
If the community wasn't mostly survivors then the game would have a huge problem, since 80% of each match is made up of survivors.
---
Idk if the devs ever stated that a 2/2 is a win though, have they? They stated that it's a draw game or what they want for balance. If a killer goes beyond that, then it can be considered a win.
---
I also think people forget that from the survivor side of things, simply escaping isn't enough to pip either, same boat as for killers just getting kills isn't enough. From what I've noticed in my close games from a survivor perspective, out of the 5 players only 2, maybe 3 players are pipping, with the rest either black pipping or 1 unlucky player usually depipping if they were the survivor eliminated early in the match.
---
If a killer is exerting enough pressure, it would be really hard to have your Unbroken and Benevolent emblems high with the Lightbringer emblem being a coin toss depending on if you're the primary one he's chasing or not.
---
Yuuuuuuuuuup
---
You know what makes this game not fun or scary, game breaking glitches every update
---
As I killer main I can tell you that Freddy is not top 3
---
Touche. You understand my point, however.
---
Yeah that's pretty standard. I actually find way more Claudettes than Dwights that way.
---
Ok we can agree on that.
---
 Only one thing you forgot. Not all emblems for survivors are easy to get. You'll need to escape to get the unbroke emblem to get atleast gold and to get it iridescent you can't get downed. That's not that important though since you can pip with the other three without a problem. Just wanted to correct you on this.
---
Cool I know that. But there are still existing bugs that havent been patched yet. And instead of them dropping updates live after the ptb, they should fix bugs before dropping live. I would rather they push it back then have whole games ruined by being hooked in the basement
---
Ps4 here
---
Yeah but tunneling actually hurts the killer because it allows the other 3 survivors to do gens. There is no counterplay to a survivor that uses infinites.
---
That's why you have to plan around Lithe, just like most exhaustion perks. BL you have to find a drop, DH you can go for an extra loop due to distance gained, SB you can hop off of unsafe gens way later than normal, Lithe you can use unsafe-ish windows/pallets (since good killers usually won't break unsafe pallets) and get to much stronger loops. Lithe especially with Housii build can be OP af if you are at a loop that breaks line of sight.
---
Somebody hasn't played the game in a few years lol.
---
I would never (and dont ever) complain about survivors finding a key in a chest and escaping with it. I still think hatch should be for last survivor only.
---
All this nerf did was make me use Dead Hard more. A more reliable exhaustion perk that's useful on all maps instead of some.
---
This BL nerf is the perfect example of devs not wanting to fix the root cause of the issue, being bad map design and just destroy another perk. If they really wanted to nerf Balanced, I think simply removing the exhaustion would be good enough and having a perk solely for reduced stagger would be good enough.
---
Are you fucking kidding me just make nemesis not work with legion hes worthless now if they can just run while not in a chase anywhere. Fucking fix legion.
---
That‚Äôs the part about infinite‚Äôs that suck though, anyone can run to them and use them. How many times can you afford to drop a chase before the game is over? This generally doesn‚Äôt come into play at lower ranks, but against a more competent team, these things are very hard to fight against.
---
when your stalking a survivor in t3, the meter doesnt go down
---
If all other survivors are alive and you get hooked, attempting escape 3 times and then not struggling should be treated the same as a DC
---
Because I could have absolutely stomped them and they barely got a couple gens done, 2 survivors  left and they find a key in the chest and  now they escape. And as a killer it's frustrating for that to be taken away from you
---
I doubt a high school student could afford one.
---
‚ÄúIn one trial‚Äù
---
What platform and who is
---
How to counter Freddy? I know you can fail skill checks to wake yourself up but wouldn‚Äôt that give away my location and not be helpful? I always run spine chill too
---
No, I never get hooked. I am a god at the game. I have over 5,000 hours played and 682,988 confirmed escapes.
---
PS4 and nurse, oni, and hillbilly
---
Noah Get The Boat
---
big ooooof
---
I have no respect for you.
---
Great troll, I fell for it. Have an upvote.
---
Nurse? Dafuq? She's ass on consoles
---
Also I really think that it needs to be much harder for survivors to pip. It's just a joke when I can get 1 pip almost every round on rank 1 and only depip if the killer decides to tunnel me down in the first 4 minutes. Most of the time I don't even know why I piped. I go out of a game thinking I didn't do too good and still get a pip. This is ridiculous.
---
How about that while the skill-check ticker may be slower, your repair is ALWAYS slowed by 5%. So even after Ruin is cleansed, or there was never Ruin at all, you're at a disadvantage in speed, but less chance of explosions. Vets wouldn't use it, but beginners would like it. 
---
And it should be called 'Slow and Steady'.
---
You just have to press lb as soon as exhaustion is about to go away, it‚Äôs like a harder skill check
---
NOED is a perk that allows the killer to 1 hit down after the gates are opened.
---
It figures right as I decide to start playing him all of a sudden there's a new bug affecting him. I was wondering why he wasn't performing the way I've seen in videos.
---
This actually does happen though, like a lot. being left alive is debatable, but there are plenty of matches where it's 3 potatoes and 1 decent survivor and I can understand the frustration of that 1 person doing all they can but everyone else is either doing gens, you?, not going for saves, wasting pallets, or lasting only seconds in a chase.
---

---
üê∑ oink~&lt;3
---
Like a pigs back
---
That being said blinding at pallets is usually not worth it in low ranks because the killer can hear you if they are good
---
I'd love for them to release a chapter with a really simple killer/survivor and just *basic* perks that can help out new players. Just like a really low-effort one that doesn't require a ton of planning.
---
Killer could just be a generic ghost lady, and just have a decent tracking, slowdown, and chase perk.
---
Power could be something like a longer lunge on short cooldown, plus the ability to have 6-second burst of speed while not in a chase for 15 seconds. 
---
Survivor would be some office worker dude with a few perks that incentivize getting chased, unhooking people, and doing generators.
---
Apparently you can get credit for that challenge by blinding the killer during the hooking animation.
---
The point that OP is trying to make is that people get carried into red ranks via SWF without basic game sense, and then try to call everything overpowered. It is a problem with the game as a whole, Ninja just happens to be a high profile example.
---
"Wait, he's chasing Meg and I need to see if I can save her..."  
---
*\[Screen flashes, skull icon appears as she goes down\]*  
---
"Nope nevermind bye"
---
I can do that. I need to do it while they're carrying a survivor. Stunning them would drop the survivor.
---
Probably not for a while, if ever. It initially released on Discord, died after less than a month, and is inky just now rereleases on Steam with an overhaul. It would have to do very well for console versions to be developed.
---
What if the next chapter just had a killer and survivor so stealthy nobody could find them in the store...?
---
of course, being at low ranks wasting the killer's time while other survivors do generators is more important
---
Wow that sounds KILLER main as fuck
---
*hook suicide*
---
Yes, punishing bad people will solve stuff more than rewarding good people
---
The killer trying to get his archive done FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
---
I purely play for fun or for bloodpoints when I use Legion  lol. Susie is the reason why I play killer once ina while.
---
Nothing better than chaining those feral frenzy hits.
---
Me an Xbox user: WOW THAT KILLER LOOKS AWESOME
---
Me an Xbox user: oh..
---
is this even live? they said it would be december 5 but unless it works without telling you, they didn't change anything
---
I hope you get mori'd off the hook in every game for the rest if your life
---
Does susie have pink hair?
---
I really like this perk, could I use it in a compilation of fan made ideas, you'd be credited as the original creator
---
If they are going on death hook I understand. But at the beggining of the match? They just can't loop period.
---
I was Clown on The Game yesterday and the first surv I saw was after they jump scared me with a pallet stun. They told me after the game that I dropped into their room with my back turned and they said "I'm fucked"
---
Idk sometimes legion can be really good with the right build I 4K most of the time in red ranks but maybe red ranks are just potato rn
---
Playing against Ghostface in an indoors map is 10x worse.
---
And at the beggining of the match? I know hoe people are.
---
Because mending is a healing action. In madness 3 you can't repair, heal, sabotage, cleanse and use items with the exception to open hatch with key.
---
Ps4 really needs to step up our game and let us use these üò§
---
Exactly what had to be done back in the day with true infinites. There was no entity blocker, bloodlust, or slow vaulting so there was literally no catching up. Partly why trapper and nurse were so popular.
---
Luckily true infinites are gone but there still remains some huge bs time wasters.
---
Pretty sure he's asking in terms of teachable perks, character loudness and natural camoflage (for example, Ace is stupidly quiet but his perks are garbage)
---
Maybe I should start doing the same then.
---
I am against the bullying of legions. #stoplegionabuse
---
Sure!
---
Legitimately all console needs to feel good is sensitivity settings for stuff like acceleration and help with framerate. I don't know what's different, but my aim is pretty good in shooters but in dbd it feels so clunky.
---
You don‚Äôt always need to be awake. If he has fake pallets, keep an eye on which ones are there when you‚Äôre awake and try to remember. If he has blood snares when he starts putting them down at loops, hit the next loop ASAP. He‚Äôs a good killer but he‚Äôs definitely counterable
---
Myers with luft of hair, haunting grounds,make your choice, Noed, and Iron Maiden
---
What pallet rework are you referring to?
---
Shut up feng main your barely even a person
---
You can be paralyzed from the neck down and make it to red ranks as a solo survivor. Breaking news: the rank system in this game is a joke. I get that he's high profile, but c'mon, if we followed every idiot around that Mr. Magoos his way to rank 4, we'd waste way too much time we could be spending complaining about how the side of the game we don't main is OP
---
He was not having a good day lol
---
I don't play as much as I used to (650\~ hours) but I feel like over the years the game play has shifted from being able to play "smart" to having to play dumb to rank up.  I used to basically ignore survivors getting hooked and just work on generators until I KNEW the killer was on someone else away from the hook.  Now, if you don't get at least one unhook, there's no way you're ranking up.  You have to be super aggressive and fight for the unhooks, causing a lot of stupid shit like you're experiencing to happen sometimes.
---
I understand that. But at the beginning of the match? Some objetive was being done.
---
I had mine on until recently. I appreciate the nice messages but I‚Äôm too nervous I‚Äôll get bad ones at this point.
---
again the full context to the match isn't shown u see what I mean?
---
You ruined that man's whole career
---
Bonus points if you‚Äôre playing as Wraith.
---
After finally getting Nancy in the last sale I can‚Äôt wait to try out fixated
---
Wish I lived in his region, I would die of laughter if he played against a good huntress ‚Äúdude bro wtf I got hit from across the map is she hacking?‚Äù
---
Do barely enough to get a signle pip.  Abusing the broken camo and taking hatch.
---
Memasik
---
Where did you get that mask from? Self made or maybe trickortreatstudios? I wanna know for my future Fred cosplay, it looks amazing!
---
Just another day at the office.
---
he is a pretty decent killer and with the right build could be pretty OW! but i only really play legion and ghostface.
---
Besides, who doesnt like stabbing people like a usual killer...only *Faster*
---
Last night I was playing Huntress and taking my catch down to the basement. Throw them on the hook, and turn to grab some more hatchets from the nearest locker.
---
Fuckin Quentin's gremlin lookin ass was hiding in there, scared the shit outta me! He screams, I scream!
---
Get your ass on the hook and outta the way of my hatchets!
---
Good concept but we really don‚Äôt need more killer stuns I could see this being easily abused in low ranks
---
yea that would be cool but what would you give them next month and the month after that? I think that would be the biggest problem
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting popular and/or meme-ish number combinations, e.g. 420, 69, 666, ... (use our weekly smile sunday threads).

I‚Äôm almost at red ranks and I would still need this lmao. This sounds like a really good idea!
---
it's enlyre :) And your's?
---
If you want to stay awake, the clocks are a much better method than failing skill checks. Failing a Skill Check will set you back 10% on whatever you were working on, and tell Freddy where you are.
---
Clocks wake you up and give you a 30 buffer period where you won't go to sleep passively.
---
* Unapproved advertising - If you wish to advertise on /r/deadbydaylight, we ask that you seek approval from the mod team beforehand.

if you ever have to go afk for a couple minutes as killer, this is the way to do it.  Survivors can end up wasting a ton of time trying to decide if they will go for the unhook or not.
---
More people playing the game, which will hopefully mean more revenue and better support. So what if he talks some shit, it's not like the DBD community isn't already a cesspool.
---
unsafe loop idk and idrc there is just way too many possibilities for this to be considered working with the killer

Exactly! It‚Äôs even worse on console. The survivors there are some of the worst at all ranks
---
 Scott Jund is in the camp of "balance killers for 1v1" which is problematic. He also has a habit of calling anything above mid-tier "uncounterable". So I'm going to have to disagree with you about him grasping both sides of the argument. He may be a " god tier" huntress but he isn't god tier at balancing. I liked him bettee when he was a Dark Souls streamer. He screeched less then.
---
The only streamer I remotely respect is Zubat. He has his opinions too, but he's not nearly as emotionally driven as the others. Everything he says about balance is generally fact driven. Instead of being some knee jerk overly emotional nonsense.
---
Oh really? I thought fog whisperer was just a title. 
---
Idk why everyone‚Äôs sleeping on lithe, I used it before the BL buff and after sometimes as well. It‚Äôs just so much nicer to loop with than sprint burst. Lithe is definitely my number one exhaustion perk rn because of dead hard being awful on dedicated...
---
&gt; Ok, you can do that with any meme

---
if theres 1 more survivor isnt there 6 gens then?   
---
4 Surv = 5 gens
---
5 Surv = 6 gens?
---
just depends on what you consider camping besides face camping that is just stupid
---
Scott isnt the most reasonable person anyways - encouraging dcing, thinking spirit is uncounterable,he is one of the more toxic side of the dbd community, not a guy to listen to
---
it existed for only a day
---
It's the dank Dr Seuss
---
yeah, good point
---
And I faced many killers trying to get h Th eir basement challenge done so you can guess how many times I got hooked before I decided to just play killer for the rest of the day. And it doesnt matter because of how impactful that was on survivors and how it ruined games for them
---
:(
---
That key will go unused over 9/10 times
---
ok 16 survivor mains guess ill camp and tunnel now huh :)
---
You can also break it.
---
thx for the red circles would never find it myself.
---
Here we go with the straw man of unhooking in front of killers. That is not what im talking about.
---
Camping to me is when there are 4+ gens left and the killer has a survivor on thier first book and will not leave, if not downright face camp. Even if they have ruin and/or a mori! I even wait a good 20 seconds or so to give the killer enough time to get thier bearings to go somewhere else.
---
When the exit gates are open? Camping is a genuinely legitimate, understable and fair tactic then. Does this make more sense now?
---
Why do people still run Sprint Burst? Doesn‚Äôt it just waste more time than it should to be a good perk?
---
No it doesnt seems to be working at all! i've disconnected,for scientific purpose, at the exit gate during endgame collapse and nothing happened!
---
I played a match as Wraith yesterday to get adept and it happened to be on Haddonfield, there was this 1 Meg who kept on going to the same house with BL and after jumping she would go on the infinite fence and back to the house, managed to get my adept (3k tho) and she trash talked me for not chasing her when she tried that loop, it was funny
---
Don't worry, I suck at aiming flashlights too
---
Happened around the time of the Freddy rework. Many of the pallets on most maps were changed to be unsafe but they added additional pallets to compensate.
---
Maybe that's why the entity took them. One to make them; to have "fun" during trials, and then work on all the cosmetics for everyone. You got to look stylish if you're gonna kill, same with dyi....I mean surviving!
---
I feel like it would be cool if there‚Äôs some way to take down the killer under really specific and difficult to do guidelines. Like everyone has to be at full health, no one has been hooked, all totems cleansed, all gens done, and some other rules.
---
wow i was tired
---
I play Ghostface, and my favorite thing is night shrouding in the middle of a chase, and throwing them off completely
---
Whilst it won‚Äôt end the chase, it will throw them off just long enough that they can get hit
---
I smell a repost
---
That's why I'm a Small Game-r
---
Good to know
---
thats sad man ):
---
That's the best part of the game
---
Bamboozle, traps(bag,trapper,Freddy) moonwalking, and knowing when an infinite is open or blocked off by the RNG, ans of course knowing when to break a chase.
---
If anything its harder to save a survivor who is getting camped, because our only option is to use BT or hope that the random has DS. Nevermind if the killer has an instadown.
---
I had this happen. I was slugged so hard. I found the hatch, keep moving so i don't get crows, bill finally goes down, WIGGLES OFF, hides at a pallet 10 feet away, goes down instantly. Gets hooked. I'm in BBQ safe range, crawling in circles around a bush for no crows. Killer is looking around behind bill, i do the hatch rotate, bill doesn't care. I danced around that bush until he died on the hook, and i still got the hatch. It was freddys map, and i guess the killer couldn't believe that it would spawn anywhere other than the boiler room. He was never anywhere near me the whole time other than when he hooked bill.
---
Personally I'd use it only paired with Fixated or Urban Evasion in order to offset the fact I can't run everywhere. Otherwise I just run everywhere and use the repair time to recover from exhaustion.
---
[Ironwork of Misery be like...](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/794/899/295.jpg)
---
While I understand that fixing random map spawns is hard I don't get why it's so difficult to fix preset buildings so they are less unfair to play against. Ironworks would be so much more fun if the window was replaced with a pallet instead. It would still be a bullshit safe pallet, but at least you'd be able to break it to disable that loop.
---
They seem to have changed some of the map spawns on Haddonfield and Badham to be less safe for Survivors, but they still need to fix other maps.
---
That's a flaw with the pip system, not balance.  2K should be a pip for killers.
---
I don‚Äôt find the other killers nearly as fun as Legion. IMHO playing as normal person instead of a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù is lot more fun and realistic. The lore behind them is interesting too.
---
What point you r standing on, even if i could crawl yo their hook, how would you suppose I get myself up and unhook them?
---
And there was no miscommunication, you just read what you wanna read ignoring the other details and jumped on conclusion.

I want you to curse this guy out and the  delete your posts again, cmon u won't
---
Every trapper used no Ed change my mind.
---
It‚Äôs insanely dark and if you get blendettes then good luck. The only killer I‚Äôve had success with is Freddy since it lightens it.
---
Always remember that you can hit survivors over those bullshit fences if they are close enough to them.
---
Sounds like a survivor main that had never played a single match as killer.
---
I tell my friends that are trying to get better as survivor to go play matches as killer. You learn a lot from good survivors you play against, and you learn the killers' limits.
---
I sympathise with you. Some survs are too thick.
---
I've been getting Sprint Burst constantly on my Yui and lol it's really not good. It's honestly pretty helpful against certain Killers but if you're really that desperate for a "broken" exhaustion perk that isn't "poop garbage Balanced Landing Reddit said it was bad" then swap to Lithe for all the utility of sprinting around constantly combined with a good "reliable" escape tool.
---
me @ clown
---
Pick and choose your battles. You should also be using that time chasing to hear/see any other survivors working on other gens you run by. 
---
Use them thinking your chasing a survivor, break off with them and sneak up on another survivor for a nice and quick surprise.
---
It was pretty satisfying to watch
---
It isn't terrible, more like mid tier.
---
It is a guarenteed head start, lets you work on unsafe gens and still reach a loop, cuts down travel time if not in chase, and can be 99% for an on demand bursts. 
---
HOWEVER, you need either to walk everywhere which is time consuming without Fixated, constantly keep an eye on exhaustion, and you instantly use your exhaustion, which is bad for safe generators. 
---
The perk has a lot of good, but a lot of bad. High risk, high reward.
---
Firday the 13th rules. Everyone just beat the fuck out of them with sticks
---
But that person doesn't believe in helping teammates. Pretty sure that they person will just camp in the corner of a map for sniper kills without doing objectives.

---
I agree completely with Dead Hard. Whether it's a latency or dedicated server issue it doesn't seem very good at granting temporary invincibility from a swing. What I've seen it used to great effect is extending a loop.
---
However, it can get you the extra steps necessary to get out of range of a lunge or get to a pallet/window where you would have taken a hit without it. Or even if you make a mistake and get out mindgamed. 
---
Of course, using it in those situations sets a pretty high skill cap-- but the ability to extend a chase by another 15-30 seconds before Bloodlust kicks in and you get caught or take your first hit is incredibly strong. Dead Hard feels like the most difficult Exhaustion perk to use effectively, but if you can do it right it's by far the most rewarding.
---
just to clear things up, if you DC at the beginning u get punished allegedly....if u DC mid game or at the end then its a deranking gift

And yeah, I definitely like Lithe way more. DH has always been awful on PS4, but it can be used to extend loops and get to pallets quicker.
---
I disagree, the Legions is by far the best so far.
---
Nurse, Spirit, Hillbilly, Huntress, Freddy, and Ghostface are still far more consistent than Oni. Every time a new killer comes out people freak out and forget that there were stronger killers in the game before the new arrival. Let him settle in the meta, and everything will be just fine.
---
Look at him. He loves it!
---
I've had games where I try to let the last person go but they pallet stun me and t bag to the point where it's mind numbing. At that point it's like "you know what Steve, you don't deserve hatch."
---
so dope!!!
---
Favorite Item is a flashlight, I‚Äôd say my favorite is the sports flashlight for my fast bullshit blinds (with the yellow grip and green battery) but the purple flashlight with a bulb is very fun for looping, a lot of times I‚Äôll loop around and follow the killer for a bit.
---
Favorite add ons are vile emetic and rubbing oil on plague. It‚Äôs soooon fun, super fast super effective puke.
---
Yeah throw down that pallet meg, I‚Äôll just puke over it no problem.
---
Yes, but I use dark devotion, so I just have to hit my obsession and no one will suspect :)
---
Or your ping my be shit
---
One thing a lot of people don't discuss when it comes to camping and tunneling, is how it's not efficient, for the killer. like if you don't care about fun and just efficiency, camping is usually a bad choice, not always. tunneling seems on paper that it would make the most sense, since you can take out someone faster and it becomes a 1v3, but there are many perks and situations where it's better to switch targets, especially considering the pressure you can add.
---
you mentioned these things, and that makes me happy ( :
---
Don't fear success my friend!
---
*Feng used Cut*
---
What bhvr needs to do is just finish what they started
---
Loomis considers Michael to be the embodiment of evil rather than a human so a pronoun like he or she would humanize him too much.
---
I love puppers! That‚Äôs really cool actually, especially considering puppers has good opinions on game balancing.
---
I guess I worded it poorly. I won't do it on purpose, but if they go for the save I'm absolutely going to take advantage of that.
---
Merry Christmas,bitch !
---
Can't fix stupid I suppose.
---
I think (just a opinion) it should be like devour that after x hooks everyone is moriable and as for keys only one person is allowed to leave and it doesn‚Äôt open the doors .
---
I have a large victorian mansion filled with such words. I lit it on fire and and I am currently enjoying a leisurely life off of  insurance money
---
Yes, but actually no. The devs have said that they won't ban you, but if the anticheat detects it as a third party software or something, it can ban you. However, there have been no reports of people being banned for it. :)
---
\#finalgirl status locked
---
The original killer(s) are the scream series. I don't think the ghost face from dbd is in any movies
---
Aye it‚Äôs not a flex. You know Tyde Time has an entire cargo ship import these in every week lmao
---
Spectacular work my dear friendo.
---
obviously latency but okay
---
No One Escapes Disconnect
---
doesn't matter cuz ur on dedicated servers it has to take into account of the killers ping
---
Remember that time you asked for change so  I loaned you like $50,000 and you said you got me back?
---
Said it several times:
---
&gt;Almost every person I've spoken to about this game universally agrees that it's in desperate need of an "operation health" update. Just skip a chapter to focus on bug fixes and buffs / nerfs to perks / Killers that haven't been changed in years.
---
&gt;The stats show it too: the biggest spike in players this game has ever had was when the End Game Collapse and Emblems were added, which were fixes to two of the most complained about mechanics in the game. (The end game and the ranking system.) Some of them were better than others ~~for gods sake remove emblems~~ but the point is that BHVR listened to the community to improve the game and the numbers responded positively. But the playerbase has been on a steady decline ever since, with the introduction of the battlepass (especially Tome 3) really hurting this game's playerbase.
---
&gt;But lord only knows a bug fix chapter won't happen, because bug fixes don't make money. At least not in the short term. And businesses rarely see long-term financial goals. If Deathgarden is anything to go by it's obvious that Behaviour has no plans for the future, and only cares about immediate satisfaction.
---
I honestly think that if they had an "operation health" update and released a bunch of cosmetics along with them people would be more than happy to buy the cosmetics to show support for the game getting better.
---
But missing it with other killers don‚Äôt result in a 2 second cool down along with your screen getting dark and the killer looking down.
---
I was wondering that too. If your profile is set to private would you still have access to this
---
Could be killer ping then. But huntress hitboxes have always been winky too.
---
So apparently a not insignificant portion of blendettes right now are doing the spine chill, don't get hooked challenge. Promoting them to hide, not save teammates, hide in lockers, and dc if they get found. Great challenge.
---
Well, downed pallets are cross able by survivors, so it doesn‚Äôt really work
---
It's just a meme, why are you getting angry over a watermark in a meme?
---
Wraith: silent clock &amp; seeing the repair status of the gens
---
Hillbilly: Drift Build
---
Nurse: Walking after a hit with better speed
---
Hag: teleporting everywhere 
---
Oni: more blood and seeing survivors when In bloodorbs
---
Pig: seeing auras when crouching
---
no not even
---
People do it all the time
---
Worst: Legion or Bubba
---
Best: Freddy.
---
Best part is that also means it works on tier 1 Myers as well
---
The Huntress: Barbecue and Chili,  A Nurse's Calling, Ruin and Whispers
---
Yeah that's true. Idk I was kinda just throwing ideas around.
---
I like this. Good idea
---
Didn't remember about that. but as you can see it is a common idea that legion was DBD's ghostface.
---
Ah, thank you - I hadn't noticed. What do you think of the change?
---
I know this is sarcasm but what do you mean?
---
Bro for real. I watched his tier lists and lost my last few brain cells. He's the undisputed champion of this award. My man revolutionized the award and elevated it to a level of stupidity once thought to be impossible. He is the epitome of stupidity and I can't think of a person more worthy of this award.
---
The biggest problem I have with a new map is that it's so fucking dark
---
Because you have spend time doing nothing while hoping they dont see you and if they do see you then you have to either ignore them and go for someone else or hit them anyways. Either way, it is a lot more efficient to hit them and catch them healing later because at least then they aren't doing gens.
---
Yeah that's what I'm trying to do... Hurting my ranking a lot because I'm losing every game (short games, no deaths)
---
purposely derank is a dick move
---
Damn impressive!!
---
I sacrificed myself to allow 3 other survs at exit gate to leave.  A shitty Nea went "GG EZ SHIITY KILLER LMAO."  The killer was actually REALLY good but my friend out juked him.
---
I told Nea to be nice and Nea went "What the fuck did you even do you rank 15?"(lost a lot of ranks due to disconnecting randomly while playing swf)
---
I said "I was the one gen rushing and my friend was the one looping the killer while you were just running around half aimlessly the game unhealed, I have empathy and you were just eating totems and sabotaging hooks."
---
Killer said "Thanks SWF group."
---
Nea called us the N word and we reported her. ;_;
---
What do you mean? I dont want to be at red ranks.
---
All the cool twitch kids use balanced landing all the time, but when I have I never get a map where I can activate it.
---
Play leatherface and face camp every survivor. EZ depipsüòé Or just play LF normally, either one works.
---
I like the first one for the troubles the survivors bring em at red ranks
---
I love legion such a fun character to play and I love the lore but he/she needs some work.
---
well too bad if you got there stay there I don't wanna be in purple ranks as a survivor but I sure as hell don't belong in green ranks either
---
It's always the No0b3  Nea-wanna be with the flashlight.  CLICK CLICK CLICK... "Hey dumbass, you clicked yourself into a dead zone with no cover...."   \*Nea DCs after being downed\*   Of course.   
---
Sometimes I'll go to their profile afterwards and comment "No0b3 would be disappointed in you."
---
A good feeling, like luck or a moment of peace.  It does feel good to get those. One time I got lucky and at the beginning of the game from the swamp boat, I saw the hag run to the corner of the map. After she left, I went over there and sure enough, her ruin was tucked away in the corner. It felt good.
---
Imagine posting this racist ass meme for the 8th time in the last 2 weeks.
---
Thats dumb lmao.
---
I'm only playing :)  , was just saying it because the title of the video was "you ever stun a killer 3 times while crawling? " But he was stunned 3 times while you were injured not crawling haha
---
What are the down codes? I know when your on the hook you wave your arms to signal camping. If you can tell me the ones for when you‚Äôre down, I‚Äôd appreciate it.
---
Nah man these dudes just living in the future where 2v8 exists.
---
How are they assholes? As long as you're not bullying the killer or survivors it's fine.
---
There is an offering for Killers called a "Momento Mori." After hooking a Survivor once, the next time they down them they can kill them with a special animation. There are 3 different types, an uncommon one where you can only kill the final Survivor in the match, a rare one where you can kill a single Survivor after they've been hooked, and an Ultra Rare one where you can kill every Survivor after hooking them once.
---
The reason a lot of people don't use them varies. They aren't very fun, and you don't get a lot of points/rank for using them. They're also somewhat Rare in bloodwebs, so some people might just not have very many. They also aren't viewed as being very 'fair' for pretty obvious reasons.
---
Not only that, but when you also realize that the exit has been blocked after the rank 20 player gets hooked
---
Did the clown get nerfed since release because I remember when he first came out he was ranked solid A/B tier but now he‚Äôs bottom tier
---
I dont belong in red ranks ya dummy dumb
---
To add on to what Collinzz said, if you're gonna hide when you see spine chill, it's almost never worth it to run right to a locker, unless there's a lot of lockers around and you're willing to gamble they don't pick the right one. When you get to a generator, immediately assess your surroundings. Find the nearest window, pallet, and escape routes so you know where to go as soon as Spine Chill lights up. And if you are gonna hide, DON'T run at all. Any scratch marks will give the killer an easy route to you, whether it ends at a locker, rock, pallet, etc.
---
This meme no longer applies due to ‚Äúprayer beads nerf‚Äù please remove
---
u/RepostSleuthBot
---
well u got there in some way play for fun and you'll end up in a rank better for u
---
wait it got nerfed? i havent played the game in a month or so. sorry.
---
I know you're just a troll but in case other people are interested

No One Escapes Food
---
Cant really play for fun when i get gen rushed every 1/2 matches
---
Thanks for the answer
---
And seconds to close
---
I was playing hag and trotting around laying traps. I turned a corner and ran right into a running Dwight. Almost made me scream. We each turned around and ran in opposite directions. In my defense, I‚Äôd just been playing survivor.
---
clearly the majority ruined the fun for the killer doesn't matter what u say stay in your fucking rank why is anyone trying to dispute this? 
---
plus it is fucking bannable to derank on purpose
---
Usually you can do just one thing when you are down and that's to rotate on ur belly without moving from the place. If its early game, you might use it for telling the team that killer is near but not picking you up, i.e. camping.
---
When its just two people, with other guy is on hook, then its basically for i found the hatch. You may also use it to beg mercy from killer i.e. act cute.
---
Nah, Pale Rose is worse. If survivors wear dark clothes, you WILL lose track of them at least once. Fuck that map.
---
Nah. S/he miss, then stabs the hand, then stabs the leg/foot and then drags them to himself/herself so they can gut them. It goes perfectly together with their teenage killer aesthetic they have going on. This is why I love it. The others can‚Äôt compete with it imo.
---
I HAVEN'T NOTICED WHATTT
---
Playing as a killer :) not survivors fam
---
Poor boi :(
---
I mean as in the aura gets revealed, as a minor nerf.
---
I think the scariest moment I've ever had in this game was after hooking someone as Billy on Rotten Fields I saw someone across the map with BBQ and went to zoom to them.  About halfway to them I randomly hit a Jake.  Just out of fucking nowhere 80% of my screen became Jake's face and it got me good.
---
Oh. I thought you meant it was supposed to be found by then.
---
I refer to them as free orthodontics. Piggy is just making sure all the survivors have nice straight teeth. What a nice lady.
---
Tunnelling and camping are very effective strategies that work against survivors at any rank. It's most of what happens in tournaments too, it's not just something to use against inexperienced or uncoordinated players.
---
The impact of removing an entire survivor from the match as early as possible by tunnelling them cannot be overstated, once only 3 survivors remain in the match it is much much easier to control the game, build pressure, and outright win off of many situations. And camping is not necessarily obvious camping, but smart, well-timed and opportunistic proxi-camping, baiting survivors in and zoning and controlling survivors around the hook, wasting a ton of their time because they spend time running to the hook, positioning for a save, getting chased off, maybe sticking around looking for an opportunity, maybe taking a hit, maybe even going down. Best case scenario for them they run back to their gen and have wasted a good 30-60 seconds between running to the hook, checking out the situation, deeming it not worthwhile to save and running back again, and mostly more toward 60 seconds because if the gen is close enough for them not to have to run far to the hook, the killer can pressure their gen while proxi-ing the hook anyway, especially with high-mobility killers that can keep returning to the hook in mere seconds.
---
It is actually regularly the other way around: Against worse and less experienced players, a competent player can comfortably win without camping and tunnelling, going for a free-roaming "hook-it-and-book-it" playstyle where they even go out of their way to let survivors get free saves and alternate targets. This makes for pretty fun rounds for everyone involved. Against better and more experienced players, tunnelling and camping in smart ways are more or less a necessity to be able to win, unless you manage to establish a lot of pressure early on and to keep that pressure up, which is usually only possible with certain killers and involves slugging.
---
If a survivor is wasting so much of a killer's time in their chases that the killer cannot tunnel them to death before gens are through, it simply means the killer has lost the match by losing chases to a good player that outplayed them. If you want to still win in scenarios like these, you switch targets to a survivor that is worse, and tunnel them instead. But a good killer can end chases relatively quickly against good survivors too, on average, certainly quickly enough to tunnel them out of the match before gens are through (unless the survivor has a very strong map setup - "infinite" windows should definitely be reworked). Decisive Strike also plays into this, of course, but good survivors that can actually lead chases that well are so rare that DS cannot be removed without hurting the global playerbase too much, against which tunnelling is just pretty devastating. I do not think tunnelling is bad in itself, as long as the tunnelled survivor gets a chance to have a fair chase after being unhooked. That is why I think DS should be reduced to around 20 seconds, which is enough to secure such a fair chase. If downed within those 20 seconds however, DS should stay active indefinitely, until picked up or healed up from the ground. It should also activate two times, not only once. It should be disabled after exit gates are opened.
---
Camping as opposed to tunnelling is more unfun, especially the hard-camping that can be seen a lot, but there are means of playing against it better. Kindred should be used, especially after its recent buff. Borrowed Time should be used. And fortunately they made it possible to use the hooked survivor as a shield again, enabling more gameplay around hooks. I still think hook grabs should be removed, as they encourage nothing but face-camping and awkward dancing around the hook. At the very least, a third survivor should be able to rescue the hooked survivor while another survivor is in the process of getting grabbed off the unhook. Currently the hooked survivor is locked into that animation and cannot be rescued during that time.
---
I guess it depends on how far you go down a rank. I didn't think about that. If your in red ranks and go down to Gray or yellow then that is really fucked up.
---
Vommy mommy's spaghetti üçù
---
I also have this but it's not the biggest problem, my doc don't laugh anymore
---
Purple-green about 9-12
---
If they fixed the pip system for killers tho then it would be fine.
---
But what was the second totem? Did they show the perk screen?
---
I think some salty killers could take a look at this book too ngl
---
"They sadly said that it‚Äôs unlikely that they‚Äôd skip a chapter to fix the game."
---
Which means they don't care about long-term health of the game if it means chapters are making them more money short-term
---
Fuck BHVR.
---
Throw on Dance With Me for added confusion.
---
How does this happen?
---
If instead of bringing the killer to the hook you go away, maybe someone else will do a safe hook rescue instead of this stupid unsafe rescue.
---
I dunno, Its probably one of the worst DLC killer moris to me, but you do you.
---
They would grow old while reading it lol.
---
my point exactly
---
No clue. I just noticed the lobby was starting with 3 survivors instead of 4 then this happened.
---
He uses BBQ and chili, so it‚Äôs much easier to just find someone and chase them, and produces pretty much equal pressure, and is overall more fun than just pressing spacebar
---
New guy here. What does the 5 under the number 30 mean? Gg btw!
---
this made me laugh, 
---
but this is why i love dead hard. it feels like the ONLY skillful perk for survivors! And it feels sooo good when you time your dead hard right
---
I have been getting consistent double pip perfect 32k games with him in xbox. I went from rank 7-2 over the weekend
---
I'm surprised this hasn't happened to me as killer. I camp the last 3 gens because they're close. I camp the guy on hook because you're all trying to save the guy. Fun game.
---
anti tunnel perk btw
---
then you are gonna derank eventually but purposely going into matches just throwing bc you wanna derank is bannable
---
He was like "fuck you red rank exploiters" so idk
---
Aka the Matt Walker windows on Rancid Abattoir, Ironworks of Misery and Torment Creek.
---
I knew that you could do it in kyf but not in public match... weird... and cool at the same time
---
Not a permanent tho ;)
---
That's Devotion level. It just counts the amount of times you've hit level 100. And thanks
---
Devotion 5, means their level is 530
---
I know right? One time, I started hearing VERY close heartbeat (he wasn't in shroud for whatever reason) and I just thought "fuck, he's behind me isn't he?" He was, in fact, behind me. Scared the shit outta me when I turned round.
---
I love this
---
Clown has had no recent changes in the past few months outside of perk changes that may have affected builds used on him.
---
His feral frenzy hits do not count as normal hits, mend time decreased, no stbfl, so sloppy, but pwyf still decreases in stacks if you hit as legion even in frenzy, main legion for only 2 weeks and you might get it
---
Oh. Lol. I think that‚Äôs the phone prediction thingy. Most words i type i just click from the predictions bar. xD
---
It doesn't have to be active, but it severely diminishes your chances.
---
So cute lol
---
Yup lol
---
Clutch play.  Nicely done.
---
Don‚Äôt dc, just go afk, at least let the survivors get points
---
I get jump-scared whenever I see a goddamn blendette just run across my screen whenever I‚Äôm crouching as pig. And when I get out of phase-walk I get jumped every time I see Dwight's just appear in front of me since he has the most hideous face.
---
Sound is now global so you know when she‚Äôs phasing across the map
---
Nah.. Dwight is way more nervous than this dude. Alexei just wanted to have a good time and didn‚Äôt gaf
---
Thank you. I love them both.
---
Ah yes, casual racism.
---
/s
---
They really really aren't.  Tunneling and camping is just a recipe for a depip gen rush loss at red ranks.  You lost me with your opening statement.  I stayed for the rest but it just isn't remotely accurate man.  Borrowed Time and Decisive destroy that argument and they're both expected on red rank players.  Also often those players are competent enough in chase to punish you hard for tunneling them off hook with those perks so it's not like a yellow rank player that might d strike you then go down 8 seconds later anyways.  You tunnel my ass and it's D strike then off to the loops boiiiiiii.  Seriously camping and tunneling are only viable against weak survivors which you generally don't need to do anything special to take down anyways.  It's the good players you should be gameplanning to beat and funny enough the way to beat them you touch on for a bit with the "hook it and book it" playstyle (really like that name by the way it's saucy).  But yeah playing for intense gen pressure and constantly forcing them off gens to perform altruism is how you beat solid-good groups of survivors.  Hook em, leave em, pgtw the gen of your choice, get your next down while 1-2 of the others keep stopping gens to have to go for saves.  If you can lock into that rhythm you basically control the pace of the game.
---
How ARE you stuck in 9-7? This game ranking system is basically off how much you play, rather than how good you are at it.
---
I remember when I found someone hiding in a locker during feral frenzy twice and he said i was cheating
---
As someone else said in this thread, and fair enough if the title is a joke, but I honestly believe you can make a lot of killers work. I'm not too knowledgeable on Legion, but if I can make Pig work consistently at rank 1, I feel like anything can be viable.
---
He's a bully.
---
LET THEM PLAY
---
I feel like this would be a good buff for technician
---
No, i am a legion main and i feel like he sould not be deleted, he is kinda weak and not as overpowerd, how would you fel if your main just got deleted from the game, hundreds of hours of fun pointless, millions of bloodpoints spent with no purpose, all we want is that they stop reworking him, and just leave him like that, we are getting bullied by bhvr and other people from the game that we like a killer that they don't
---
Go scratched mirror on Myers and go be a sneaky snake on everyone, maybe even giving them a little scare :p
---
Idgaf about the money
---
its so funny too bc theres like no backing ghostface being exceptional other than that tru3 won as him with a specific build. like he doesnt even use the stalk he is just playing a basic 115 32m tr killer that removes his tr every like 15 sec and running an anti heal build.
---
Yeah I don't really see it either.. Just push them out of the gate and move on, so what if they drop a couple tbags lol
---
üòÇ i‚Äôm so sorry
---
I‚Äôve noticed dcing now only removes a single pip instead of 2
---
He has his own mouse to play with!
---
‚ÄúAsk any legion main‚Äù I‚Äôm a red rank legion main and I‚Äôm Happy with the changes for now :)
---
***Terror radius I N T E N S I F I E S***
---
I got sent from rank 3 to rank 12
---
Nice! Good job!
---
I just said it doesn‚Äôt matter anymore because DC bans have been instated, and I don‚Äôt think Haddonfield DCs are justified either.
---
My favorite thing to do is hit a killer with head on while they‚Äôre in the middle of chasing someone else.
---
I normally just play a Killer using their useless add-ons (such as the Wraith one where his terror radius isn‚Äôt suppressed whilst cloaked, or Trapper with his add-on that doesn‚Äôt injure Survivors) and just try to max out points without hooking anyone.
---
You do you but i and others are not happy
---
Why do you even need STBFL stacks when most times people don't even bother healing against Legion so everyone is always one hit away from going down, what's the need for a reduced cooldown? And he has a new add on that applies the mangled effect, so look at that, you open up a new perk slot. I don't run PWYF on Legion and I don't exactly think its meta on legion so does it really matter? Have you tried his new pins? Have you tried the one that inflicts the broken status? It's amazing. My only complaint is that they should've given him a pin that inflicts the exhaustion status effect, now that'd be fun.
---
I get scared by teammates as well. I had this Claudette get out of a locker next to my gen and screamed due to Iron Maiden
---
Sometimes..
---
Fast
---
You see, I have a few good games. But then I have several in a row where I get obliterated before I can do anything to earn my pips.
---
Good.
---
It's never ending with this one.
---
Joe‚Äôs sweater is badass
---
Is it? That's such a vague statement that I don't think it means anything. Bear in mind that adrenaline triggers immediately when the last gen pops, not during that last gasp unhook and sprint for an open gate
---
It resets you to the crest that‚Äôs before your current one. For example, if you‚Äôre currently red ranks, you‚Äôll be reset to purple ranks. If you‚Äôre purple ranks, you‚Äôll be reset to green. If you‚Äôre green ranks, you‚Äôll be reset to yellow. Etc etc
---
I think pig is underrated.
---
Maybe even get the POWER GLOVE! as a separate weapon like how Myers got the pipe and screwdriver. One can dream.
---
I'm assuming this is because there's some weirdness with Bill's licence(?)
---
Perhaps because he was a free, licensed character, he can't be monetised in any way.
---
I got downvoted for giving a guy platinum and commenting about it...
---
I still wouldn‚Äôt mark Scott as toxic for it, he just doesn‚Äôt play matches he thinks are boring. I understand if you don‚Äôt like him, that‚Äôs fine, but it certainly doesn‚Äôt make him toxic.
---
Honestly the traps are pretty useless admittedly, but it's really the stealth and ambush that shine for me
---
legion gets nerfed despite being lowest tier killer already
---
i really don't understand why
---
MEOWZERZ thats one hungry cat he sures likes eating mice for breakfast
---
It‚Äôs letirally not that hard to spell it (all joke ily)
---
Couple months late, but chainsaws aren't effective weapons at all. Say Bubba tried to cut Michael with the chainsaw, in the unlikely instance it doesn't just snag on his clothes or bounce right off, he still wouldn't kill him. Not even close.
---
XD
---
Legion will reign supreme
---
Where are you seeing them?
---
I was playing Myers in the gas station (don‚Äôt remember the exact name) and had a standoff with a nea at a pallet, faked stalking her before she dropped the pallet and managed to hit her before she made a move
---
He has his own, but no he wants mine.
---
Is it only to the first level of the colour or the last? Like derank from 12 to 15 or 12 to 13?
---
I appreciate the effort put into this lmao
---
I still have some in my inventory
---
yeah her lore is 100% autism-coded in my opinion!
---
Outplayed
---
During an AMA with the devs, it was asked if she was autistic, but they said no.
---
Was the same with doctor, ppl learned to play against him. But theres also the opposite case too, with Ghostface, Freddy or hag, wich ppl didnt consider them as good as they do today.
---
Lets see oni and demo...
---
Just downvote sarcasm 4head
---
Yeah, pretty obviously. It keeps talking about how she's "wired differently" and that she's socially and intellectually challenged. It's exciting to have insight into a character we previously knew nothing about, and I'm wondering what secrets we'll learn about the others. Unlike you though, I'm totally willing to joke about blendettes.
---
It's good to see the devs taking inspiration from the community!
---
Welp, when the match started, someone dc‚Äôed instantly... I went to the gen discordance gave me notify... I saw 2 people there, and one was waiting at a pallet and dropped it early... she crawled to me and I grabbed her
---
DC
---
Then, behind me, there was a Feng, she walked to a pallet, I was like: stun me sure... I stalked her till tier 3 for the points
---
Not DC 
---
Then the last person randomly DC‚ÄôEd and I hooked Feng... end match
---
It was like 2 minutes Xd
---
But now survivors themselves can procs it too
---
It‚Äôs a bug in this patch. Thank BHVR
---
His isn't as interesting- yours makes noise and skitters
---
Cute asshole baby, I know the feel, my sympathy
---
Lithe glitch, hackers are non-existent on PS4.
---
No it‚Äôs just how much you play the game
---
I don't either.
---
But this whine fest is annoying
---
In full tracking view while interacting.
---
Pretty sure you‚Äôre not allowed to do this.
---
Btw there‚Äôs a bug where survivors keep their speedboost from either getting hit or an exhaustion perk. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs fixed though. But it‚Äôs more likely that it was this bug as it is on console.
---
that why i put my cat outside of my room when i play.
---
Ya know dude. I would. But this guy doesnt listen to anything and it devolves into infantile insults. But thanks for your 2 cents. I'll say whatever the fuck I want though, bunch of pussies on here.
---
Am I wrong though?
---
Nope.
---
That is literally all that matters to me.
---
He had the medkit addon that essentially gives him borrowed time
---
Gorgeously terrifying
---
Who uses an exhaustion perk to avoid a FF hit? He can't down you with it lmao. You'll get a speed boost if you get hit by feral frenzy...And his add ons? No they are "new". Before you had to hit the same person twice which would stun you and give the survivor a speed boost. Now you hit one and inflict the status on others.
---
There arent any hacks on PS4 or the ability to do so. Im assuming you mean he had the exhaustion glitch where you keep running at 200% speed after your exhaustion activates due to a glitch with the activation of it being done at the same time as being hit or something similar
---
also youre breaking the rules by not censoring his name fyi
---
Probably soon cause we have 30 days for the rift left
---
the title is a joke im also looking for other peoples opinion on legion. i think he is ok but needs more buffs.
---
Love you
---
Do you have any video proof, and/or did you report it ingame? Because, besides the lack of max level perks, There is nothing that can be used against him. Hell, not even the lack of max perks is worth a damn.
---
Moro noed bw
---
Lidehrally.
---
I faked to one side of the pallet and she slow vaulted right into the grab.
---
Use a macro, can even check your phone while on the hook like in first phase
---
I swore there was a page that said the date, but I thought it said dec 7. Now I can‚Äôt find the page either
---
Clearly, it does
---
I get that, that's why I said it needs a rework rather than getting removed. As it stands the killer can just slug the last two to completely negate it, which is often necessary if he wants to rank up. I also think the killer ranking system needs a rework based around 2 escaping and 2 surviving but that's another topic.
---
Ah ok, thanks
---
I can see you've put a lot of thoughts into this, so i spent some good time reading and understanding this.
---
TL:DR: too unbalanced, no counterplay. Needs a lot of fixing, and we already have a current legion who needs a lot of fixing.
---
\-Feral frenzy gauge. 
---
Something that people in this subreddit coming up with ideas for killers and perks don't understand is: speed increasing bonuses are HARD to balance. A survivor who could move by an extra 5% forever would be almost impossible to catch for a killer like huntress or hag. And that's just 5%.  
---
A killer that moves by an extra 15% means that he moves ridiculously fast and he can end chases in a matter of seconds. Just check leatherface with Nemesis + Play With Your Food, he's very strong right now. And that's with perks that are virtually balanced.
---
Now imagine your legion. There's no downside with never activating your power, so you would be a killer that moves with a 130% speed FOREVER, which would be impossible to counter in chases. And that's with no perks or addons.
---
\-Frenzy Mode
---
I was very skeptical with the statistics, but i think you put them together very well. Cool power... imagining that the frenzy duration would be 5 seconds tops, but you reset the countdown with every hits, this would be pretty strong for a slugging killer.
---
The problem is: what can a survivor do to avoid being downed in a matter of seconds? Hope to dodge a hit with a stupid 360 movement? Turn back to the pallet the legion just vaulted and hope he misses? Otherwise, this would old legion all over again.
---
Can confirm a sneaky pallet stun can cause a heart attack. I died IRL from this.
---
Def not dec7th I‚Äôm pretty certain it‚Äôs dec 16th
---
that shit always cracks me up that reminds me of this oni game on thompson house i had yesterday where the killer couldnt stop changing directions and moonwalking at loops where i could clearly see his giant hair sticking out.
---
He just wanna save you from getting facecamped, what a gentleman.
---
ily2
---
The mask looks awesome, particularly where it sits around the eyes.
---
This is why I play Freddy. All maps are a little bit brighter AND Survivors are glowing white beacons. P3 Claudette be damned.
---
Well dont use anything that affects your terror radius. And she honestly is more versatile than people give her credit for when it comes to perk diversity. I run anything that locates people (BBQ, Thrilling Tremors are both nice) and stuff to regress gens (Pop Goes the Weasel, Surveillance).
---
Thats why I have him p3
---
The first person probably lagged out, the second dude is just a dick who can‚Äôt take losing, and third person was either of the last two.
---
can agree. I might have to switch out the most underrated perk (empathy) for deliverance on my blendette purely because i solo and im generally invisible with her
---
A shitty template deserves a shitty meme lol
---
I love all of them and 4k almost every game with all of them, but for winning billy for farming oni
---
1- That depends on how you build, assuming you cant survive the chase yet, I'd reccomend what others have said, find your way slowly towards safety, killers CAN spend time looking, but they wont spend their life on it, because they cant spare the pressure. Personally I play using the killer to speed up the gen while I look and wait for them to come into sight. I've run from too many generators just to realize I ran right towards them.
---
2. I usually prefer to walk around until ive noticed the killer has hit someone or the obsession is being chased, at that point the time matters more and saving every second helps. I just hate being found first, because killers who camp dont leave the first victim to get many points unless you can run them. 
---
So play it safe, you're new, you need the BP more than the pips. Honestly, the better you perform from the beginning the harder your game will be as you try to build your main. Also, have fun with it, losing sucks but it's always a game, so play for the likes and you'll find yourself getting better while having a good time (which is far more valuable).
---
Literally most survivors...
---
No not really her traps are pretty useless due to the RNG factor where people can get them off in one try, which seemingly happens at least once per game for me. They're more for slowing the game down, and they're meh in that regard too. The reason her stealth is good is because she isn't easy to spot like Michael Myers, and she can't get broken out of it like Ghostface.
---
Good summary
---
Depends on rank, high ranks it's fast since killer is suffering, low ranks it's slow since survivor is suffering. Even the 1:4 ratio doesn't change this.
---
I mean at that point people would either stop dc or stop playing, I'm good with either  üòÄ
---
I think, "Neez mor buffz" is a bit of an unspecific statement.
---
Her issues in the lore definitely fits the description of someone on the spectrum.
---
they don't even give a BP bonus for playing against 4 man SWF. can't see this happening any time soon
---
this isn't a racism thing...
---
I'd replace whispers with iron for quicker hatchets
---
Yeah but im new to this game, so its hard to know the perk just by looking at the icons
---
Why??????? Just...why...? Also, I'm glad to see someone else actually enjoys the new Legion. Old Legion was fun cause of his ability to cheese things like STBFL and Franklin's demise but I much prefer this Legion we have rn.
---
You monster, Im gonna save my homie and than we do together the archive challenges.
---
Hate these types of people
---
If I had the presence of mind to, I totally would have done that, but he had me shook, that's hilarious
---
Right? I looked at their profiles afterwards, and one mentioned being a Youtuber. so I search his username on Youtube and sure enough, filled with videos of him and others in SWF openly calling themselves "toxic" and "bullies." I noticed that two of them actually have the same profile name, to promote their channel. 
---
I suggested they pu this video up, but they didn't respond. So I did it for them lol
---
I'm on the autism spectrum and dated someone on the spectrum as well and honestly, I did get the feeling Claudette was autistic when reading her lore.
---
Red rank survivors btw.
---
People are only used to seeing those op killers
---
If this game is absolute garbage, then do yourself a favour, and unistall the game. Ty very much
---
Yes please so the gameplay is literally visible nowhere :D
---
He had like multiple lockers to pick from too, but had to pick the closest one to the hook; must have been in a hurry while I was on my way down.
---
But yeah never jump in a locker around  against the Huntress
---
nah ok so the one in the shop does appear in movies
---
If you‚Äôd like to go ahead
---
It‚Äôs a lot harder to hit hatchets using a controller, that‚Äôs probably why
---
From what I understand Sony almost never changes trophy conditions once they are released.
---
*\*Laughs in No0b3\**
---
Someone reported this as stolen - anyone know who the original creator is?
---
Damn, god walks among the david with no mither who cleanses
---
I wasn't even the one downvoting him lol
---
That should 100 percent happen.
---
I also wish PS4 allowed us to see our progress
---
i have yeah. The demogorgon is just a useful animal to the mind flayer. It literally stalks like a predator and keeps its prey like a spider wraps up flies and keeps them on its web. It is created to kill by the mind flayer, but it acts just like many animals that are not "evil"
---
your interpretation is just as valid as mine but you dont see me asking if you have actually seen the source material
---
Nah.  you gotta be like all the streamers who always have 9 traps available, only placing them mid chase... then bitch about hag being low tier killer.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the Treatment Theatre, oh you are chasing me? Good luck going through 30 windows!
---
He's counting DCs
---
What game achievement from?
---
I've found its almost impossible to play killer midday, especially at your rank since most people have ranked out of anything lower than 15
---
I once did this to a David three times and he never dead harded, but it did give him time to 360 me (I suck) then a fourth time, I chased him to pallet and just when I was about swing, he dead harded and then pallet stunned me.
---
&gt;	Only BHVR really knows when DC penalties are getting applied.
---
I thought they said it was going active on the 5th? Though ingame experience is telling me that‚Äôs not actually true.
---
[here's the og template](https://i.imgur.com/Pq8XE3F_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium)
---
Queues are longer on PC as killer. On PS4, queues are really short as killer (shorter than survivor usually).
---
...how does that logic make any sense?
---
Why would you have higher conditions for the more difficult hardware?
---
If this was the case then PC players would have the higher number
---
Dlc is killers and survivors, your not at a disadvantage per say but there is good dlc perks that come with survivors. I have about 5-600 hours play time and I‚Äôm still enjoying myself but at the start the game is very difficult and it can be off putting. Like trying to figure out how you got killed or how you got found and stuff and working out how to play against certain killers is a bit of a steep hill at first. I definitely recommend the game it can be a heap of fun, I recommend if you do get the game that after every game read the perks of the killer their add ons and same goes for survivors and figure out what you‚Äôd like to use. Then maybe by that stage you might like the game and want dlc or find it‚Äôs simply not for you :)
---
Slugging is leaving survivors on the ground after you down them. Tunneling is going after the same survivor over and over again. The definition for farming varies on the context for it. If a survivor unhooks a survivors in front of you without BT they're trying to farm altruism.
---
When you're in the middle of picking up a downed survivor, only to see a Blendette with a flashlight run in from your peripheral.
---
Survivor mains call literally everything tunneling and it‚Äôs not bannable so don‚Äôt worry about it
---
unless you have head-on, jump scaring the killer is so much fun.
---
Yes. I totally agree, legion is the man. I main him
---
Is there a difference between buying the new chapter with money, or buying the killer and survivor with shards?
---
I mean, if it means ebonies are out of the game...
---
Let me innnn, leemmee innnnn
---
Thanks for reading! A guy on the forums has helped me to rethink most of the power. I will be releasing it here at this night along with all of his add-ons. I hope you can gjve your opinion on that too!
---
Me too
---
This is one of the dumbest takes on dcing I‚Äôve seen on this sub
---
Oh wait I completely read your post wrong,
---
I thought you said 100 downs on PC, not PS4. I have no idea why that is considering PS4 and Xbox both use controller
---
Slugging is when you down a survivor and not pick them up, leaving them to bleed out. You leave them to crawl lije a ‚Äòslug‚Äô.
---
Tunneling is when you solely focus on repeatedly downing a single survivor whilst others could clearly be targeted too, often done to get someone out of the game fast. Having ‚Äòtunnel vision‚Äô for one survivor, basically.
---
Farming is focusing in getting as many points as possible each game, not caring about gameplay or the overall outcome of the game.
---
Hope that helps.
---
I am talking about red rank survivors LOL
---
I'm looking forward to Bill and the Killer working together to keep you alive so they can farm you.
---
Tunneling is when you go after only one survivor until they die and when they do you repeat the process. Slugging is downing everyone and then hooking them all. Both of these are uncool but I'm not going to tell you how to play the game
---
Ah, yes, another repost
---
It is because you are 20.
---
Rank 20 sucks for matchmaking which is epic level of stupid because it is where new people start.  At most you'll get matched with rank 14, which is easy to climb past for most users.  20 to 16 is impossible to depip, so new people rank past that fast.   Simply, the pool of available players sucks.
---
Don't worry about avoiding them, they're rules made by survivors, for survivors. Play how you want to play to have the most fun and just ignore end game chat. People get toxic when they lose and they have to blame someone
---
* Slugging
---
Deliberately leaving survivors lying on the ground instead of hooking them.
---
* tunneling
---
Only chasing one survivor during the trail until he/she is dead.
---
Idk what farming means, tho. 
---
Also, don't listen to what everyone else says. Play the game the way you want to because at the end of the day it is still just a game.
---
If you down a survivor, hook them, they get unhooked and you go after the same survivor over and over. They are dead after 3 hooks. If you hook the same survivor 3 times in a row so they die quickly, that's considered tunneling.
---
That's honestly why, when I had a PC,I switched to wireless. My cats wouldn't stop lol.
---
Daily rituals
---
Also when the killer is new and you want to check out the fresh fatality.
---
Devs would make bank if they added customizations for different mori animations.
---
This sounds good on paper but the thing is, not everyone at BHVR is a programmer.
---
They have artists, writers, and who knows what else who simply aren't qualified for bug fixes simply as it's not their field. They can't just move everyone to a different department and have them do something they physically do not have the knowledge to do.
---
And if they just push back content to the next patch and only uploaded bug fixes, the number of changes would be the same because they have the same number of people working on it.
---
 Could they increase the budget for the bug fix team? Maybe. We don't know what their budget is.
---
Have you ever watched the movies?  His own therapist constantly refers to him as an "it" or "thing" that's pure concentrated evil essentially.  Loomis goes out of his way to specify that Michael isn't a man.
---
As someone who mains trapper on the occasion that I want a break from playing survivor this hurt my feelings
---
as an avid poe player, SAME.
---
Same, been a big fan of him and still wouldn‚Äôt expect him on this sub
---
Legion is awesome!
---
*crying in low resolution dream world*
---
Men's are an abomination and should be removed. Quick and Quiets fun though.
---
Don't worry about it too much, play how you want. Survivors like to make up fake rules to force a handicap on the killer. Your goal is to kill everyone.
---
Wth ? Razer makes pink gear ?
---
It's good to know that :)
---
None of these are punishable, although it's frowned upon by survivors but that's it. Play however you want to, if that's how you enjoy the game then go for it.
---
The thing that annoys me about that isn't the fact that Tru3 thinks he's a top tier killer rather than a mid tier one being carried by a particularly good build, but that he thinks he's responsible for it becoming meta.
---
Like, plenty of people were already running that. Not long after his release people were discussing various ways of using only his stealth.
---
I used to watch him all the time and I even got into games with him before but now I don‚Äôt watch him as much :/
---
I feel you
---
it‚Äôs the only outfit i think looks good with him :D
---
Nah, its always spirits
---
We need "Hex:F*cking Mongolians."
---
The horde comes into your aid to tear down walls.
---
"How come everytime us ~~chinese~~ haddonfielders put up a wall  stupid mongolians have to come and  knock it down."
---
dude first time I played killed survivors almost killed me xD... I was like pls not the face.. PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
It is amazing but may i ask why the eletrik (idk how to spell it) guitar?
---
I'm not agreeing with it.
---
One of the best perk in the game, saved me coutless times!

no

#### 2. Unrelated Content
---
The main focus of all submissions must be on either Dead by Daylight, the fanbase surrounding the game or the subreddit itself (i.e. meta posts). For non-text posts (images, gifs, videos, ...), the rule of thumb is that the viewer should be able to immediately tell that the main focus of the post is Dead by Daylight without reading the title of the submission.
---
This prohibits, but is not limited to, the following kinds of submissions:
---
* **Offtopic discussions,** including submissions primarily about games similar to Dead by Daylight (e.g. Deathgarden, Identity V, Friday the 13th: The Game, ‚Ä¶).
---
* **General / non-DBD content content on the following...**
---
   * Gaming (e.g. why are horror games scary?)
---
   * Surveys / questionaires
---
   * BHVR (e.g. personal life news from BHVR employees, content primarily about other games developed and/or published by BHVR etc.)
---
   * Community members (e.g. this DBD streamer is playing *Rollercoaster Tycoon*!) **Exception:** Death or departure of a community member
---
* **Reaction posts with otherwise unrelated images or videos.**
---
* **Content that contains, references or mentions Dead by Daylight in passing** (e.g. news articles)
---
* **Unintentional resemblances/real-life depictions of elements or events happening in Dead by Daylight** (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets, the looping scene from the *Scream* movies, ‚Ä¶).
---
##### Partial exception: Outside licensed IPs
---
This exception covers the following IPs:
---
* *SAW*
---
* *A Nightmare on Elm Street*
---
* *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre*
---
* *Halloween*
---
* *Evil Dead*
---
* *Stranger Things*
---
Submissions where these IPs are the main focus are overall allowed, as these movies have an audience beyond the scope of the game. However, we do not allow trailers or general movie discussions, as we do not want to become a hub for all posts concerning these franchises.
---
##### Exception: Content that immediately affects the game
---
Events or content that *directly and immediately* affects Dead by Daylight or a portion of the playerbase on a large scale are allowed to be submitted (e.g. PS4 bricking exploit)
---
**TL;DR: click report if you see things that violate the rules and we will remove it faster.**
---
Replied to the wrong comment whoops &gt;_&gt; But yeah, I know you're talking about red rank survivors...I can't believe actual red rank survivors, the best of the best, are actually using their exhaustion perks to avoid FF hits...like...god that's so stupid...
---
it's nearly unbeatable in most cases. Lery's Memorial, which they chose, has so many walls and blocked paths, that only very few hooks are accessible at any time. by sabotaging these few hooks, then also using Boil Over, Flip Flop, AND 4 Breakout on each survivor, it would be nearly impossible to hook someone. on top of that, they have 4 unbreakable so they always recover fast, making the best use of Flip Flop for when they inevitably get sugged. then, they hid in an area where it's very hard to see them or keep track of where they are, especially with PS4's graphics and framerate.
---
Problem is, the bloody glove gives near infinite Nurse's Calling and Deerstalker so long as they stay in the same area. so they could never recover for more than a couple seconds, forcing them to bleed out, the most boring and frustrating way to lose. 
---
I'm surprised they never DC'd, given how such trolls usually do.
---
It's a shame I didn't have STBFL, I think it might be a better choice on Oni when using this add on. Maybe I'll switch out PWYF and Nemesis for that and Sloppy Butcher.
---
killer queues are almost instant at high ranks, you'll get there.
---
The loading icon in the corner makes me wish we had more of these as loading screens so we could actually see them more
---
Also i wouldn t play If there was no content, like why would i play, since the game has nothing New to bring. If they said that next time there won t be new chapter, then i wouldn t play for 3 months. I am prestige 3 50 on almost every survivor and killer. So If there is no New content, i don t see reason to play dbd anymore.
---
&gt; Otz literally made a video about DS being OP the other day and throughout the entire video he never once got DS'd.
---
Could you post it please?
---
Also, Umbra, Panda, Gibs, Edgar, Farmer and a host of others are primarily killer streamers who don't do that at all.
---
In fact almost none of them do
---
Scorpionz. Also a killer streamer who panders to survivor mains *hard*
---
They really need to find a way to make flashlights easier to use on console
---
oh sorry  
---
It's Hex: Ruin, Hex: Devour Hope, Iron Grasp, and Monstrous Shrine. The last two aren't very useful perks, he's probably only using them for the basement challenge in the archives, or is just doing a basement build for fun.
---
Honestly, there are a lot of time I basically singlehandedly win the game for my team, get first hooked right at the end, and are left to die with 0 effort to save. I don‚Äôt usually complain in the after chat, and won‚Äôt bitch about being the only one to die, but sometimes it REALLY does happen haha.
---
Santa suit clown: *Coughs uncontrollably*
---
P3 would've also worked
---
I feel like all you need for moris is to make them only usable once they're on their death hook, so it's not an actual tool that affects gameplay, it's just an optional cooler way to kill someone
---
My username is Mike Hawk. When people complain about this, I just ask them, "what's wrong, did Mike Hawk slap you too hard?"
---
when I moonwalk into a pallet and get stunned, shit spooks me every time.
---
I think most of the chapters have an exclusive cosmetic if you buy them with money rather than with shards or Auric Cells through the in game store. Not sure about the most recent one though.
---
They should just add the blood back on her p3 beanie.
---
easy fix to all of this, but i doubt it will happen
---
Tru3 refuses to respect anyone else's opinions so this is just the most hypocritical defense ever lmao
---
I wouldn t, cosmetics mean shit, New content is what brings People to play the game. At least for me since i am almost everbody p3 50
---
&gt; Unbiased data from thousands of matches across multiple ranks and platforms, and taking into account every in-game variable: trash data, means nothing.
---
Could you please explain why data not controlled for a single variable is good?
---
If you place that many traps in one spot you sadly aren't a pretty good hag player. Unless you're meming.
---
This reminds me of the time I was getting chased by the Killer on Leri's. Don't remember which killer it was, but it was end game, I was looping him around, gen just popped, Killer started moving faster.
---
Door hadn't opened yet, and he was gaining on me. I just booked it towards the door screaming into my headset "OPEN THE DOOR! OPEN THE DOOR! OPEN THE DOOR!"despite playing solo.
---
The random hero opened it right as I turned the corner and I barely made it to the edge of the map before he hit me down.
---
Tbh 90% of the time I get head-on'd, I had no idea the survivor was there and had no reason to check the lockers. They'd have been better off not doing it.
---
Nah, ain't nothing Altruistic about the average Claudette
---
Save him?! When he is in trouble he gets a timeout  for 2 seconds on the couch, I thinks he's doing ok.
---
Taking a charity hatch is a bitch move.
---
Just another game of cat and mouse üòÇ
---
Yerah people are going to need to learn to counter this one by keeping moving. It allows them to see blood orbs at all times, so they can totally do it. 
---
I strongly suggest that if you see your blood orbs floating around, DO NOT work on a generator until you're healed.
---
What? Me? No no no. G-fuel... G-fuel
---
He's usually okay, it's just bed time or dinner time when he does this to get my attention.
---
S intensifies
---
Yeah, I only got it because it was pink lol.
---
You get a different shirt for the survivor if you buy the chapter
---
Skilled players get rank 1. Not all rank 1 players are skilled. Pipping as survivor is far too easy so you're always gonna have people at ranks far higher than they belong
---
This could have ended with "salty survivor in endgame chat." and still been accurate
---
There is, you get another cosmetic for the survivor for purchasing the newest chapter as a whole
---
Killers can't win. I admit I'm a killer main but I get called names and toxic even if its wildly inaccurate. I'll hook someone and walk to the other side if the map to use Pop. But god forbid I see a survivor going for a save and I go back. Just because I dont allow you to get unhooked doesnt mean I'm camping ya know? This may not be the case for you, maybe you do get face camped and I'm sorry about that but trust me, it goes both ways, just the nature of the game.
---
I think she did that because I did a majority of the generators lol
---
It looks so good ! And I don't like pink that much.
---
Sounds like you'd be annoying to go against.
---
Stay away from me.
---
they could have tried real fan arts instead of putting flat 3D models on it.
---
tons of fan creations are way better than the store one.
---
Yea, maybe not the most creative but I do love how frantic Legion's Mori seems. Like a person with a knife panicking and going "JUST DIE" rather than the usual "I have decided you will die brutally, I could have done this any time."
---
I don't feel like I have that problem in the theater. I can usually run through the nearby door ways and still maintain a line of sight through all the open windows. I actually really enjoy chases in that level.
---
Seems like a bug to me considering how nea came with the nurse Idk how long it's been like that
---
Welcome to this sub. If people's posts don't get attention they repost it over and over
---
Who's white hair? Is that Kate?
---
I have always been a pink person I couldn't help must when I saw it.
---
The one thing I absolutely hate on Legion is how punishing it is when you miss an attack during his power. Not only do you lose your entire power gauge you also get the amazing 5 second stun. Maybe this doesn't seem like a big deal on PC but on console it's pretty easy to miss a few attacks due to the frame drops.
---
Disagree- noticed sneaky boi hiding in the tall grass at Yamaoka, very ninja- stare down while pleading with second survivor working gen to ACTUALLY LOOK AROUND, no luck and he comes in so I flee and leave them.  Forward one escape and some bp- turn a corner and camera spaz attemt to run to get away from....one of the boulders that looked like his stupid ass crouched in the grass.
---
I've heard Demogorgon stomps before I was in the terror radius
---
Demo's footsteps are really loud, you can hear him from a mile away. So probably not

This is not new information.

Yeah that's usually when they strike, little devils.

How is that annoying? It's making smart use of Demo's power.
---
Thank you :)
---
Sadly
---
You wasted half of your flashlight just to get the aim right, that's a big oof.
---
The only killer sin is taking somebody's game hostage by bodyblocking them in a corner/basement with no intention of killing them, everything else is fair game
---
Trust me if you bend to play by their rules they'll just make up something new to complain about when they die
---
Where my boi ash?
---
I dunno. Dwight's a wreck, barely capable of holding a minimum wage job.
---
Alexei was a scientist capable of making machines that would crack open dimensions and knew he was being hunted down, and then managed to have fun knowing Russian Terminator was chasing him down
---
I'm a hoe for free hatches.
---
But what if the general way of playing changes like a brand new meta caused by sone changes to core gameplay. Maybe a new objective gets added to the game along with a limited time event to offer a reward for testing the new feature. Maybe your favourite perks or killers get a significant change and you have to learn a new killer basically (Freddy wasn't a new character when he got reworked but he got a fundamental playstyle change). And maybe (please don't take this as a personal insult) a majority of the community didn't have enough time to grind the game as far as you and 3 months of break are exactly what this game needs so that new content is seen in a more fascinating light. Don't get me wrong I like the Oni and everything but he just kinda drowned for me in between all the other killers we currently have in the roster. What I do notice is a stupidly high number of bugs and issues that will keep me away from the game just as much as you if there is no new content. Sorry for that essay but that's what I feel like about the current state of DbD
---
Pretty much my experience, it‚Äôs to the point if one player gets an error we all just restart preemptively.
---
The worst is when you wait the 5 mins it takes to find a match and realize it didn‚Äôt take your teammate with you and they are still back in the lobby.
---
It is a joke ...
---
I do the same thing I run the loop a few times with no deviations, and the activate Night Shroud and take a weird path or turn and it usually allows me to get a hit.
---
Ruin is absolutely essential lmao. You cannot play at any high rank without ruin or your game is over in 5 minutes.
---
I main Legion, don't tell me I hate her!
---
Well it made no fucking sense at all.
---
Lol I'm wrong for laughing at this but fuck it.
---
Flakes
---
u/Jaiimy I'm very obviously joking and saying that it's good. '^` ??
---
Pls Do that
---
Never seen a ghosty with noed
---
MrTLexify was my guy back in the cod zombies days
---
Have you played the new map? I had a Meg hiding in the tall bamboo/bushes and I had to squint so hard to see her, if I hadn't just been in a chase with her no chance in hell I would have seen her just normally walking and searching.
---
What are Nurse's descriptions? It's quite possible they mixed them up.
---
Defult Ace or Bill in the corn is even scarier then Claud
---
It's been like that since she came out.
---
Susie in a Christmas sweater is all I've ever needed in life
---
That's not a hook camper, that's an afk.
---
Rework the whole thing
---
‚ÄúTo be fair, checking lockers could be seen as cheating‚Äù that‚Äôs basically what it boils down to right?
---
No that‚Äôs not a fair thought process and we shouldn‚Äôt be sympathizing dcing assholes for not having a fraction of understanding fundamental game mechanics.
---
Thank you for clarifying you don‚Äôt agree with it though.
---
Sorry but i have no idea
---
I get anxious when I hear footsteps because it usually means they're going to try to flashlight save, but I'm pretty good at avoiding them.
---
It‚Äôs scarier with full charge spirit fury
---
It sounded like you were mad. Glad you got it out.
---
Cant forget the feet attack when you want to sleep. Definitely the devils children.
---
It's not very obvious since people use /s or TyPe LiKe ThIs when they're joking. Text has no intonation.
---
Still waiting on Killer co op mode
---
Why is demo a gay boy? That's racist.
---
I guess man, but good effort none the less
---
noed needs a rework, not a nerf. its not OP, just poor game design.
---
I had a game where 1 person dc almost instantly a meg that hid in a basement locker all game and someone who was afk, I managed to escape by hatch but it was still annoying
---
Hoddie
---
Bhvr will never do that on the other hand I think they should add a bigger tr for noed similar to agitation
---
Yeah
---
Sounds good in concept but fairly difficult to execute in practice. Acute survivors will hear your footsteps before you get too close and will be constantly on the lookout. Survivors are also alerted whenever Demogorgon teleports so they know to be even more aware.
---
It really do be your own traps sometimes.
---
You're not doing an exploit so you're fine the reports are just salt and bhvr knows
---
It does I‚Äôve lost countless games where a killer with noed has fucked my entire team after all gens are done
---
Next killer confirmed. Awesome sneak preview. Haven't been this excited for such a purr-fectly balanced killer lol
---
That's 1 survivor not doing gens. That's why you break chase.
---
I cant actually confirm if those addons stack, it doesnt say in description that they stack and I never bothered to test it. But I have no problems with his default fatique duration, though I agree if it will be shorter - it will be better.
---
I run FF duration addons most of time, brown and yellow.
---
Don‚Äôt wanna sound stupid but what‚Äôs tr? Terror radius?
---
I learned the basics by watching Monto on youtube. I also learned a lot about the killers I don't have by watching him and other people. The only extra survivors or killers I have I purchased them with ingame currency and I have about 200 hours in. It's not much, but I have not felt a need to buy anything else, although I'd love to get Myers.
---
Jesus. At least you escaped lol.
---
But why the fuck should I have to break chase. It shouldnt be a thing I have to fucking do
---
It‚Äôs yui not kate
---
Barely luckily it was a ghost face
---
proxy chasing is dumb, don't do it. just leave the obsession and go after someone else, way easier.
---
Trust me... I was pissed lmao. Thankfully game chat isn't a thing.
---
Bro. I legit sometimes get scared when I'm playing pig or ghostface and turn a corner just to smack face first into a Quentin. I silently curse every time lol
---
Well thats not really OP, thats situational af and you could just look for the totem and scatter.
---
NOED is shit game design, simple as that. its the definition of a crutch perk and its really annoying, but its def not OP
---
Yeah i was just thinking that based on the Japanese on the sweater
---
I had to start using a macro on my mouse because this happened to me so much, it really needs a QOL update
---
Wow! It really does fit, I was thinking of using Pool Party theme from League, but it got too summer-y later on in the song. I settled with some rock biker music.
---
God this Luigi's Mansion mix is a fucking Bop, great vid too!
---
yeah but then you only get one stack, which is gone after you hit the survivor one time (assuming you don't miss). I feel like if im only ever going to have 0 or 1 stacks, PWYF isn't worth the perk slot. Maybe if there are existing survs that are already injured, so that 1 stack can be used to get them quickly?
---
Crutch and really annoying, isn‚Äôt that the definition of op
---
For the DLCs you may want to know that there is an in-game store called the Shrine of Secrets where you can use Iridescent Shards, an in-game currency obtainable by playing and leveling up so you do not spend money there. In the Shrine of Secrets you can get perks for both Killer and Survivor even if they are exclusive to characters from the DLCs so ideally you can spend zero money and still "have it the same as everyone else". This thing refreshes every Wednesday and there is a rotation of four perks, two for each side so you have to be patient in order to get some perks you'd like if you do not want to spend money. Basically you can consider on buying a DLC if the Killer interests you or the Survivor but if you are only interested in one or two of their perks you can wait for them in the Shrine. Sometimes there are also sales in the in-game store. In conclusion no, you do not have to spend money in order to enjoy the game. You can, it helps out the devs but it is not mandatory. Hope this helps bruh

*hunam enough dying online, time for... REAL!*
---
Some of us are blind ok? üòÇ
---
I'm going to sound dumb but I haven't actually seen it as a loading screen up until now... Thanks for the idea!
---
Ngl, I use it 90% of the time when I shouldn't.
---
But stunning them mid loop or in the basement when they are passing by is too much fun NOT to run it.
---
Not to be that guy, but you might want to work on curbing that behavior quickly. My friends cat died by chewing on a lamp plug cable.
---
\*wa\* \*wa\* \*wa\* \*waaaaaaaahhhhh\*
---
You must be jump scared into Oblivion
---
I was playing KYF and was playing as hag (I almost never play killer, I enjoy survivor too much). Hag always terrified me as it is when playing against her. I've played this game for a long time but that bloom trap jumpscares gets me everytime.
---
I had just hooked one of my friends and had set up traps around the hook I had turned around as someone had just set off the trap. I crapped my pants so hard, my mouse was spinning everywhere as I squealed loudly.
---
The person was hooked safely as I apparently looked like a total idiot with my characters head going everywhere at her own jumpscare.
---
Big brain plays
---
Dude ok good im not just a huge pussy
---
Oh Ninja is playing now, I hope I get a chance to slaughter him.
---
Yeah agitation increases tr when you pick someone up. Noed shouldn't be a gamble but on the other hand you can figure out what perks a killer has during a Chase for example BBQ discordance ruin sloppy butcher agitation iron grasp toth stbfl nurse's calling and some other perks are dead giveaways to the survivor. You should be actively trying to figure out what perks killers have and what perks survivors have regardless of what side you're playing.
---
Yeah I realized that now lol
---
I could tell it was a joke I can imagine him saying it but really sarcastically
---
Fair enough, lol
---
Ah mine would actually climb up the bed and dive under the blanket to get to mine.
---
I know and watch a couple of really good NA players at least on PC, so I obviously don't think the region is just worse overall, but I do find the players they face on average are worse than the players I see in the EU region, in my games and on EU-based streams (and Russians play in the EU region, which have a pretty sizeable subset of strong "competitive" players, and a lot of players that "tryhard", camping and tunnelling with a vengeance). But it's players globally that I find are really not very good at this game on average, to say the least, and the players that I watch destroy 80+% of the survivor groups they face with relative ease, with those survivors being blatantly bad at the game (stuff like dropping a pallet after having been hit when they obviously didn't have to, which is just an example of an immediate, obvious tell that the player is, bluntly put, garbage at the game at a very fundamental level, and stuff like this happens all the time in their red rank matches).
---
Take a player like Zubat, who is really good at the game and wins the vast majority of his killer games decisively, and usually does so without camping or tunnelling (though he does slug and return to hook all the time, and does get campier and tunnellier if the games get closer). He had a series of "Douchebat" streams where he'd actually camp and tunnel, and it was just nasty how games fell apart for survivors before they had even begun. It's frankly boring watching him play killer as it is, because it is awfully rare for him to get good-enough survivors to even be able to challenge him, but those streams were just miserable, for himself as well.
---
Where do I post a bug on here? The basement bug is still active in Hawkins Lab as of 11:50am today
---
Assholes!
---
I wish all of legion got themed stuff together. I want Frank in a Christmas sweater :(
---
But Noed can be countered way before it even activates, Just get all five totems its not that hard totems are easy as fuck to find, Use inner strength to get more benifit from it too, Detectives hunch annihilates Noed way before it's even used, Killers have asked me in endgame chat why their noed didnt work and I told them it's that I cleansed all the totems
---
I feeling like collection banners should be loading screens.
---
I feel Wraith has the most frightening one
---
The only changes I'd be okay seeing for NoEd is a totem counter, probably placed next to the gen counter, or warning about NoEd as soon as that last gen gets done. If you're smart you assume every killer has NoEd and therefore become the blendette of your team.
---
Ok I‚Äôll fix just for you
---
u/Jaiimy Well maybe if you grew a brain and practiced common sense then you'd assume I wasn't calling it annoying in a negative way.
---
You go around in your game looking for totems? That‚Äôs boring af I wanna do gens, be chased not totems
---
u/PrestigeMaster04 Thank you
---
Man, this boi and his wife make a bloody scary combo
---
not even close. 
---
Annoying doesnt = OP, and crutch doesnt = OP
---
If annoying was OP then most of the lower rank killers are the most OP since they seem to be the most annoying.
---
Then crutch perks dont really mean OP  by default, its a perk by perk basis, i really dont think there is any OP perks in the game at this point (i might be forgetting one i just woke up)
---
Huntress is great but yeah console controls arent the best for her skills. I love the Pig though. her abilities could be better but i always run spine chill so she could never sneak up on me. jumpscare piggy is pretty fun to play against imo
---
i almost got a heart attack when i got head on'd in the first time of my life
---
Windows get blocked though
---
He is fine. He doesn't do it very often only rarely when he wants my attention at bed or feeding time and I have 19 cats in my house so all PowerPoints not being used are unplugged. They don't touch them anyway because they know they get a time out alone in the bedroom.
---
NOED is already a horrifyingly weak perk if the survivors aren‚Äôt lazy, a nerf honestly isn‚Äôt needed
---
yea but stronk girl sweat
---
 When you finished slugging and go to pick up people and the survivor with unbreakable pops up right in front of you
---
They are called totems do them
---
If it told you where the totem was that‚Äôd be an improvement, you still have to go to it and cleanse it but it wouldn‚Äôt make noed useless
---
More like Feng is she joined Biker Kate.
---
Sounds relatable but I don‚Äôt see how someone can stop you from doing a gen to heal you. They can‚Äôt pull you off lol
---
Obviously PS4 is masterrace
---
Bad idea, I'd try to pet it and die every time.
---
But you need to do gens to activate detectives hunch, and it's fun totem hunting, you get a thousand for each and when you see Noed in the endgame screen you feel good that you helped your team, Idk man
---
Legion's secret technique is using his Power for its designed role: Injure, Track and Slowdown.
---
I almost always can find second survivor with KI after initial FF hit. I aim to injure as much survivors as possible with my FF, and keep them injured all time. If they heal, well, too bad, I'll injure them again. I use FF on injured survivors if I see healthy survivors on my HUD and use KI to find and injure them again.
---
When all ppl are injured, I capitalize on it with my Pop to protect gens and have faster hooks. If they heal, well, no repairs is done during that time, and guess what? I'll injure them again.
---
I dont commit to chases too long, so noone is feeling safe on gens.
---
You can watch in this game [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/519001176](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/519001176)
---
You can see, that after initial FF chain I was chasing Feng, others were mending and healing near gen. They could commit to repair and maybe even finish gen in 3 ppl, or at least make decent amount of repairs after Mending. But they healed and gen was barely started when I came back. You can see, that I was spreading FF hits as much as possible to keep ppl injured and even ignored 2 ppl near hook to injure Jake at some point. Using information from Discordance and KI I was trying to keep ppl on toes and feel themselves unsafe.
---
I've only bought about $20 worth of dlc, but even without it I still have a lot of fun in this game. The basic package for both survivors and killers is more than enough to compete. Also there are ways to slowly unlock the perks of characters you haven't bought yet.
---
A really strong perk that pisses people off and ruin games isn‚Äôt op? If it‚Äôs just annoying or just crutch then I suppose it‚Äôs fine
---
Nooo plz spare me, I am queen of filling the food bowl.
---
At levels 30, 35, and 40 respectively you unlocked a special "teachable" version of the perk that unlocks it for other characters. It'll have an orange background, so its pretty easy to spot. Unlocking the teachable version lets other characters find it on their bloodweb.
---
Buying the teachable perk will unlock all ranks as well, but you still have to find each rank on the character to level it up.
---
It‚Äôs not ‚Äúhorrifyingly weak‚Äù it‚Äôs a crutch perk that saves a killer from certain doom
---
No that‚Äôs boring
---
You should only be getting the stacks when possible, aka when they go into an area with alot of cover so you can quickly break chase in seconds. If you have to look down, it will take like 8~ seconds which is way too much time.
---
A missed opportunity indeed.
---
Each survivor and killer have a set of 3 perks, Those perks can be unlocked for other survivors and killers once you get to lvl 30, 35, and 40.
---
Once you get to those lvls you can unlock a "teachable perk" which just allows you to have those perks show up in other characters bloodwebs.
---
perks have 3 stages, each stage is character specific, so lets say you have Self care 3 on Claudette, you can have self care 2 on dwight. 
---
I highly suggest starting with Meg, she has 3 solid perks that will help you out when you first start.
---
Because it's easier for BHVR to do that and say it's fixed than to actually fix their shit
---
When a character is level 30,35, and 40. In their Bloodweb their perk will appear but it‚Äôs orange colored. If you get that one from the Bloodweb, it will unlock the chance for all other characters to encounter it in their own webs.
---
Even if you don‚Äôt get it in that particular Bloodweb, it will constantly reappear in the next level‚Äôs web, taking the place of a regular perk.
---
You mean has Survivor or has a killer throw myself at survivors. I would gladly go for the second one because I swear to God I should be able to dive bomb across that goddamn car and hit a cocky little Survivor
---
The true problem is both. While the perk did make it easy to exploit certain maps to make them infinitely worse, that wasn't the only aspect that was exploitable. The reduced stagger aspect of perk could also make a chase go on a bit longer, which shouldn't have been a thing. There was no reason for an exhaustion perk to half work when exhausted.
---
Is there a new penalty other than a depip?
---
But he‚Äôs young - plus I thought others were taller/looked it in game.
---
Yeah I think I fell into the void man
---
The gay icon we all need.
---
Extremely*
---
*DO THE ROAR!*
---
Characters have 3 perks that are unique to them.After leveling them up to level 35, 40, and 45 you have the ability to unlock them by using bloodpoints to buy them on the bloodweb.After unlocking them(keep in mind they should be orange)They are added to the pool of base perks for use on every survivor or killer depending on if you leveled up a killer or survivor.You can also purchase perks from the shrine of secrets which is located in the shop for ingame currency called iridescent shards.Hope this helps!üëç
---
When you sit still, a survivor can stop whatever animation you're in to heal you. Basically I'm doing a gen while injured, she comes up behind me, trys to heal me, makes me stop repairing, I go back to the gen by hitting repair, she immediately hits heal, rinse and repeat. (It doesn't stop self heal and recovery fot some reason but I now know it does when repairing)
---
Hey look I'm the Trapper and my power includes not being able to see my own traps from a certain distance and stepping in my own traps
---
Maybe you do bones next time.
---
Why on earth would I use detectives hunch and totem hunting is one of the most boring things ever
---
Nope boring
---
Copy pasta from other NOED thread:
---
NOED is balanced because not only it can be countered but survivors have multiple ways to counter it and as if it wasnt enough, multiple tools to assist with that task. Survivors have more control over NOED happening or not than the killer itself since he can't actually protect dull totems. 
---
Counters: 
---
* Cleanse 5 totems.
---
* Just locate as many totems as you can but don't waste time cleansing it just yet. If you see the killer is struggling to catch survivors, go cleanse the totems you spotted before the last gen is done.
---
* Just locate as many totems as you can but don't waste time cleansing it. After the last gen has been repaired, revisit all the totems to see if one of them lit up. 
---
* Don't waste time looking for totems the entire match, just look for that one lit totem after the last gen is done or once someone gets hit by NOED. 
---
Tools to assist with cleansing totems:
---
* [Green Map](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Map) with [Red Twine](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Red_Twine) add-on.
---
* [Small Game](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Small_Game). Just mindlessly run around the map and do a thorough search when the alert goes off, reducing the time wasted looking for totems. 
---
* [Detective's Hunch](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Detective%27s_Hunch). Doing your objective AND easily finding totems. (this perk recently got a really good buff in the last patch). 
---
Not a tool but comes with play time. Memorize most if not all props that can contain a totem attached to it. Drastically reduces the time spent looking for totems. 
---
Very rare but not impossible, you can loop a killer with NOED (just like an EW3 myers + the mov speed) to some extent and escape without getting hit. 
---
So yeah, NOED is fine. Feels very cheap because of the 1-shot but still fine. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
*"bUt HoW cAn I dO aLl ThIs If ThE KiLlEr ChAsEd Me, HiT mE wItH nOeD aNd My TeAm SaT bY tHe ExIt GaTes?"*
---
You see, the problem here is not the **perk**, is your teammates or players in general. They should be doing any of the steps above while you were being chased.
---
It also forces the killer to play with 3 perks throughout the entire match leaving him at a disadvantage right from the start for a hope that he will have NOED.
---
Weekend Bug Report threads are where to post them on here, but I would post them on the Bug Report section of BHVR's forum if you want it seen faster
---
It‚Äôs a perk that‚Äôs inactive for 95% of the match, and it‚Äôs activation can be prevented simply by survivors doing their secondary objective, something you should be doing regardless, simply because of NOED‚Äôs existence. A team that suffers from NOED‚Äôs activation has only themselves to blame
---
They do pair well since the new obsession gets oblivious and can be unaware of the terror radius they have on them. A kind of side benefit for dark devotion is that most people are rather unaware of how it works so they often run around wasting time thinking they have a killer following them.
---
No one at red ranks runs the perk because it‚Äôs just a *bad* perk. Most of the times all totems get cleared or the killer might get one free down before someone inevitably finds the totem.
---
Pretty sure repairing, cleansing, unhooking, searching chests can‚Äôt be interrupted lol. They can only heal you if you‚Äôre not running and not doing an action
---
not for the rank 17 baby nancy that im matched with
---
No
---
Then I guess you die?
---
You shouldn‚Äôt have an extra objective because of 1 perk and it can save a killer from 1 kill to maybe 3 or even 4 kills
---
Anyone know anything about the second rift? Like will there be a grace period before the second one is released or will it be straight after the first has closed?
---
Guess they can since it happened to me. Test it out for yourself. It at least interrupts repairing lol.
---
Also Ash and Bill
---
Yes, it‚Äôs makes you a camper that you are standing there to defend the hooked survivor. What you gotta do is hook and let them be, go check on generators is what I do, but it‚Äôs not really camping if you are chasing someone who is close to the hook.
---
Tunneling is confusing a bit. What I think tunneling is 2. 1) focusing your game as a killer chasing and hook one particular survivor even though you did have a chance to chase another. And 2) chasing the survivor who just got unhooked instead of doing something else, like, chasing the survivor who did the unhooking, or anything else really. It‚Äôs focusing your play on one survivor, which is not fair to them because you didn‚Äôt give them a chance, to heal and stuff. 
---
Definitely the game is not perfect and there are million ways to improve, but it‚Äôs tuff because, if something in the game changes, everything becomes out of balance. Your idea about collecting wires/oil and stuff to do gen have been around. I think it‚Äôs cool to see something more then just gens. Like Friday the 13th for example. But again, change like this is big, and will disturb the balance and all. 
---
I wish a DBD 2 comes out with something bigger, you know, bigger maps, more mods, more to the objectives.  
---
Just my 2 cents. 
---
You are very new to the games. Keep playing and you will always learn something and come up with strategies and stuff. Good luck!
---
My wife and I have to take nighty-night protocols to make sure our feet or arms aren't hanging off the bed because our tabby cat will cling to the side of it and pull himself around it like a slug going mach-1 searching for anything to attack that's hanging off.
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting multiple iridescent emblems (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
At least we don't have screaming demon monsters
---
You shouldn‚Äôt have to have perks to counter noed or even a second objective,what if enduring completely ignored pallet stuns and the only way you could prevent that is by doing 3 totems
---
Then what's your problem with Noed?, You don't even try to counter it yet you complain about it, But it can be countered and therefore it's not op.
---
Was playing Huntress once, had a Meg fall on my head. Scared the absolute shit out of me, didn‚Äôt even try to attack her.
---
oh we good then homie
---
Could be another one of the million bugs this patch, buts it's there and it's annoying.
---
I just want a tally marker that everyone can see. When a totem is destroyed, one line is removed.
---
Well, cats prey on mouses after all üòè
---
I see this as an absolute win
---
This ^
---
Sounds pretty good
---
Yes face camp is shit. I hate Bubba, most Bubbas are toxic. Like clearly toxic face camping and shit. I don‚Äôt see wrong in going back to the hook when seeing a survivor, especially when the match is a win for them. If I was a killer and I feel like I‚Äôm ahead, like, more hooks and less gens done, then I really don‚Äôt care when seeing some hook another, I just pass and try find others.
---
üòÇ I stopped that by shoving those stick-string-mouse toys between the bed and mattress but sometimes it's just not enough.
---
So I guess your a killer main and you need noed to stop you de pipping, you shouldn‚Äôt need to waste a lot of time looking and cleansing totems what if survivors had a perk that meant the couldn‚Äôt be downed until you go and break something
---
Ah, thank you. I'm still relatively new to DBD.
---
It‚Äôs not reliable enough in solo games. Once I did three totems, and there was still NOED. My teammates didn‚Äôt do bones.
---
Kate squad where you at?
---
It distracts them, better than nothing.
---
TIL why some gen repairs have been slower for me when my exhaustion status shows. Doh!
---
No please... I don't want my Ruin spawning in front of a door and making it literally impossible to miss. It's bad enough when Ruin spawns next to a gen or in tge middle of a field. Make like obstacles instead like boxes or some wood planks that take some time to move them (like 5/10 seconds) that blocks a pathway to some gens and/or loops and cause a noise bubble. Could limit this to the main building and kilker shack. Killers can break them by hitting them and gives no cooldown penalty so you don't have to worry about not reaching a hook.
---
Red rank here, never use exhaustion perks to avoid ff. Because well there is no point. Also i try to never heal against legion, unless i must
---
It's not always the ones you expect to be the hardest that are hard too. I must have went 10 matches before getting a safe hook during egc. We either dont make it to endgame or we do and no one gets hooked. Then on the killer side I have to camp someone during egc for the sacrifice then explain to them I'm not mad I just been trying to do the challenge all day.
---
I don't appreciate this discrimination.
---
Don't bully Legion. Give them hugs and hooks...and some buffs would be nice, but the hugs are a start.
---
There are worse things than this... i would want to do something like 2v8... even if its not for the ranks ( lets be honest they dont do anything at all) just for fun
---
Exhausted doesnt affect gen times,I think he meant that using your exhaustion on a gen you can safely get away from without the need for sprint burst is a downside
---
I said totem hunting is boring I wanna get chased without going down in 1 hit or save people in the endgame without them having an easy down

No problem mate.
---
The totems are there from the beginning, they‚Äôre just dull. Get  the perk inner strength and start cleansing. Also if you‚Äôre upset about free downs, why aren‚Äôt you complaining about Myers, insta-chainsaw, Haunted Grounds, Make your choice, Oni, Ghostface, etc etc. 
---
Out of all those examples, NOED is probably the worst way to practically get an insta-down. Not understanding your logic here.
---
I've gotten jumpscared so many times as Killer but never as Survivor. Devs really need to change lighting on maps and ambient audio to make the game scarier for survivors.
---
Lithe BTFO, 99ing sprint burst my new meta
---
Every game I have ruin I start by just running to the totem. 9 times out of 10 there's already somebody cleansing it.  Makes finding the first survivor really easy.
---
The cat finally got the mouse.
---
Dbd is a kind of cat and mouse game.
---
I mean why not just be nice and help them out ? And the rift is totally optional and aren‚Äôt required at all. Ive asked for help on some of the killer tomes because they were a little too complicated and very much circumstantial and I‚Äôm glad the people I‚Äôve asked for help in my matches were willing to help. And you don‚Äôt have to buy the rift because allegedly the cosmetic items are going to be in the shop 6 months later ... 
---
The rift is totally worth playing for me because it gives me incentive to actually work towards something. I go on and off of playing the game because of my toxic experiences with killers and survivors but because of the rift and feeling like I have something to work towards I can put that aside to play the game and it‚Äôs been fun . Also if you really feel like you can‚Äôt get your challenges done because you‚Äôre a solo queue just find some people to play with it‚Äôs not that hard
---
The cat is so cute but the cup of water is giving me anxiety lol.
---
I guess because of how they play when I face them. But stealth killers are boring, 9/10 times when I face a Ghostface, Pig, or Wraith they tend to just camp around the hook while in shroud/cloak/crouch and if not that, don't really use their stealth abilities that well and just chase you like a standard M1 killer without using the main draw of their power in the first place. I also just don't like Amanda, she was forgettable to me in the movies, and I much preferred Hoffman myself. I also got turned off of her by this reddit, when you had all those weirdos worshiping her like a cult and even making a sub dedicated to her
---
Once you stay in the fog long enough days blend. You could be in there for weeks and it feel like 5 minutes.

Welcome to the Hag club. She can be devastating at pallets. You'll also be able to laugh at any god loop on any map.

---
Getting hooked for maybe 20 seconds at most isn‚Äôt that boring and doesn‚Äôt give a huge edge to someone, if you get downed your likely to be hooked that‚Äôs fair
---
Yeah I understand you, I also want a 2 killer mode I was just saying that bhvr auto bans for doing this bug as it ruins the game in their eyes
---
Me personally I would like a full overhaul of the game a proper game of stratagy half hour games 7-8 survivors 10-12 gens slightly bigger map 2 killers
---
Nemesis is just too good with PWYF...
---
Legion: This is brilliant *points at nemesis* 
---
But I like this *points at nerfs*
---
That's the thing. I'm probably not going to do the next one because of this. The game is hard as it is on both sides now because of it. It's always good to do the right thing and just help them out because that's pretty much what I end up doing... survivors message me for what they want help in and I go ahead and get mine done while they get theirs. Then we just farm for the rest of the game but the developers have openly admitted that they hate that...
---
Ah... I always liked making my killers look fancily scary, so when I was chasing this survivor who tripped a Hag trap, I had a quick heart attack when I saw my own clone.
---
The glowing cosmetics are scary.
---
But it also made me remember when Demo runs the mind something perk, which I now think always seemed to slow down my gen progression. Is this not a thing?
---
Surprisingly he never knocks it over but he drinks from it even though he has 2 bowls filled 3 times a day.
---
There's still an unfixed window on haddonfield that you can loop till blocked even without balanced and with proper distance it's god damn op.

Xqc when he just started playing, so yep.
---
It's a darn shame that the day of basically forced us to apologize for playing a certain role. I've had survivors message me that they're sorry that they had the blind me so much but the sad thing is I couldn't be mad because these challenges become absolutely insane. Seriously the whole team brought flashlights.
---
Xbox has party chat but no one really uses it. I started playing with my girlfriend so we atleast have each other now. I basically been dealing with what you deal with. No communication makes it so much harder. I can still tell when players and killers are trying to do certain challenges so I'll help out with that.
---
I mean they're not wrong
---
Then don‚Äôt bring perks or items to do it and just remember what totem spawn locations.
---
FRD. With each level you increase the distance which the killer is being thrown back. (Fus Ro Da, old joke but gold).
---
1 day 5~ hours
---
They literally can‚Äôt put dc penalties in, the way the game is rn
---
Yeah, I didn‚Äôt say it was unfair though, I said it was boring, like doing totems, yet you have to accept it or it makes the game less fun.
---
That being said, No Mither is being permanently Exposed so Oni‚Äôe powers would be unnecessary on that survivor and since survivors don‚Äôt know who their killer is, no one in their right mind would run No Mither and hope to get Oni
---
Imagine if we could implement all the past artwork banners as loading screens now. Already seeing the Oni/Yui trailer changed for the opening cinematic was cool.
---
Even if the banner was only used for the week it was released, it would be cool to see it pop up as the loading screen of the week that I have to stare at for 5 minutes before getting booted back to the lobby because someone quit.
---
Yeah I get it. I had to blind a killer for a challenge and it got me tunneled and camped. Some challenges promote good things though. I actually dont have to run self care anymore because everyone is always trying to heal me now
---
If you don‚Äôt wanna get downed in one hit do totems before the last gen is done. You can‚Äôt complain about a perk when there is a counter that renders it useless
---
Haunted grounds goes away in 30 seconds I think,make your choice also goes away in a time limit oni pissed a lot of survivors off but he‚Äôs counterable Myers needs to stalk to get tier 3 all of these don‚Äôt need you to do something to counter them  I don‚Äôt having nothing for the insta chainsaw although I don‚Äôt really come up against it
---
Survivors have jump scared me more times than killers.
---
You're part of the problem. Novelty &lt; A functional product
---
It's like a minigame while you're waiting in the lobby.
---
ah gotcha thanks!
---
Last I heard the penalties were disabled.
---
Good to know thanks!
---
Didn't they say on the 5th that they implemented dc penalties?

I'd like to see a nasty looking scythe on a Reaper character.
---
realistically i'd rather be perma exposed vs m1 oni then full hp vs enraged oni. At least the m1 guy can't invalidate my distance gain by pressing m2 then 180 curve flick the corner. You go down in 1 hit both times but in a chase its way easier to loop a m1 only.
---
I play on playstation and I only come on PC for the ptb but in all honesty I get so many messages a day of people telling me to please just let them do this because they're tired. One person I've been trying to get that stupid flashlight the killer carrying a Survivor for the past 3 days. He's tired of getting others killed as well as himself
---
I don‚Äôt get your point, gen rush does exist but if the killer pressures more then it won‚Äôt happen, if 3 or 4 survivors do start by a hen then yes I get that‚Äôs unfair and the killer can‚Äôt do anything I do play a little killer aswell
---
I think they delayed it(at least the better have) due to the bugs that made the game unplayable
---
depends on the system. they were only being enabled on pc and switch from what i recall.
---
I have played all three versions, and PC/PS4 have some communication, so you can do the "help" thing even to the annnoyance of the devs or other players, but switch has no such option, if you don't have near-rank friends to lobby hop the random line up with. Your SOL and hope your working on the hard challenges if you get lucky enough to find a cooperative killer
---
All good points. 
---
But, you forgot one.
---
Noed can be removed before the last gen popped if survivors cleanse.
---
We should have a secondary objective or get 1 shot because of 1 perk?
---
Hook suicide is better than dc I can end a gen in the time the killer do the animations
---
Well sure... that ruins the game... not all the updates they do adding more bugs everytime xD man bhvr should fix the gsme and gives a bit more variety of game play
---
Legion CAN be good yeah, but he's definitely underpowered compared to most other killers.
---
Omg this happened to me yesterday. The most terrified i ever got playing. It was a dark map and i think it was a Claudette
---
My ray of hope is that I‚Äôve gotten used to staying up late at night, so I‚Äôll probably be able to get the rest of the shards before the perks rotate.
---
I like this idea, but I'd be inclined for this to be part of a perk or item, but not automatically included. Free information is tricky to add into the game, but paying for that information with build slots is fine.
---
That‚Äôs why I said it‚Äôd kill it and I said if it wasn‚Äôt a hex and activated for say 1 minute after the gens have been popped
---
How the hell are they going to punish us like that? I'm already busting my tail to hit prestige 3, now I have to grind Bill to level 40 on top of that? This really rubs me, the consumer, the wrong way.
---
Bro is that a...
---
(Inhales deeply)
---
JoJo reference?
---
tall friends day out
---
I play pig/MM and I used NOED. I have basically no abilities after the last ten is up (remaining traps are useless, need speed for patrolling exit gates so no crouch) so I just run it and say I'll take if off when her traps get a way to activate after the last gen is done.
---
Yes and this is total BS!  I'm already grinding my tail off to hit prestige 3, now I on top of that I have to grind Bill to level 40? This really rubs me, the consumer, the wrong way.
---
Ugh. I‚Äôll be pushing it, but I think I‚Äôll be able to get it as long as I can get my game updated before tomorrow. I stay up pretty late so I should be able to grind to get DS
---
Agreed 100%.. the fact that some maps don‚Äôt even have a drop makes it garbage now.. just make a perk that reduces fall stagger and thats it.
---
What rank? What console?
---
this is exactly what it feels like
---
this is good
---
Yeah maybe slightly, I originally thought of this perk without the Oblivious status but I thought it‚Äôd be a fun addition to the power. Couldn‚Äôt quite decide on how balanced it would be lol
---
You are effectively unironically using the argument from the Survivors Rulebook for Killers.
---
Rule 5872:
---
"Survivors don't have to do bones, but can still complain about noed."
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz296Izw-S8&amp;t=454s
---
Cough cough.. dying light
---
Do totems lol ez counter
---
And thanks dude!
---
Totems were literally put in by the Devs as a secondary objective. They literally used the words 'secondary objective.'
---
Yet again there shouldn‚Äôt have to be a secondary objective to counter 1 perk
---
NVM, just read it was minutes instead of seconds, just ignore my comment
---
Yes.
---
That shit is stressful.  FNAF made a bookmark in horror games
---
Its the fans that are shit
---
***‚ô´Rest in pieces, down for the count‚ô´***
---
3.) the whole game is causal play
---
All of them and check them every single game just in case someone has noed?
---
There was a post about a streamer who had a game with 2 killers 4 survs and there was 6 gens
---
It's not even a horror game. The whome franchise 9s short, the creator is shit and the fans are shit
---
Thank you for that rather pleasant exchange. I'm not trying to be snarky or anything I'm genuinely happy that not all of us veteran playerbase are entitled elitists :)
---
Argooooooooooooooooooooooooooooose
---
No?
---
A man of culture
---
Ah I got ya lol
---
There is currently not a visual one but there should be numbers somewhere
---
So you ignored my point to say that?
---
If you plan on playing killer a lot, the leatherface is a good start for your DLC collection.  
---
One of his teachable perks (something you grind for and then it's available for all your other killers/survivors) allows you to double your blood points every game which makes the grind a lot easier.
---
I rarely get scared playing DbD, even as a survivor. Tense, yes, but why should I be scared if I know there is a player just like me controlling the killer? If I'm lucky, it'll be an idiot just like me
---
Oh how original not like 5 other people have put that
---
New BHVR game? Cat by Daylight.
---
it is implied that she is somewhere on the spectrum, probably high functioning/Asperger's.
---
Holy hell, what's with the fuckin downvotes?
---
Well good luck man, worst case scenario you end up leveling laurie.
---
They'll die in 2 minutes so they're not hostages
---
Taking someone's game hostage means that their game literally can't end(through escape or death) unless they disconnect, things like EGC, 3-gen and strategic blocking to get hits in on multiple survivors or waste BT don't count as taking the game hostage
---
Really so why we ranked? Ranked is not casual play.
---
Yes man the primary objective gets done so fast noed is a bit of a punishment for ignoring totems. People keep whining about the killer getting free downs when it can be prevented by cleansing 5 totems (which takes not that much time and doesn't even have skill checks and as long as it isn't hex it doesn't even alert the killer)q
---
So do you just not cleanse Ruin/Devour/3rd seal? You just want everyone to pop all the gens in 2-3 mins while the killer needs to get 12 downs and hooks in those 2-3 mins?
---
This subreddit hates truth
---

Thanks a lot dude! Yeah, thought it‚Äôd be really interesting to play through while not being too distracting. Gives stealth killer capabilities without actually having to be a stealth killer so fits around play styles well too!
---
tunneler lol
---
AND STATS
---
I get scared playing killer more than playing survivor honestly. Having someone‚Äôs face pop up unexpectedly in your first person camera is startling.
---
That wouldn‚Äôt make it useless it‚Äôd still be strong, someone opening the exit gate instead of getting a hit then having to chase them you insta down them and then it would‚Äôve ran out so people wouldn‚Äôt be as scared to save
---
Why is it always Billy in these posts?
---
e y e s
---
&gt; When survivors decide to be toxic, it's annoying but that's it.
---
4 toolbox/flashlight squads beg to differ. These groups also have a 200% chance of teabagging/emote spamming.
---
This is the point I‚Äôve been trying to make, thanks üòá
---
What are blood points?
---
honestly, no
---
Yes the eyes.
---
don't lie, it's the e y e s
---
I‚Äôm not saying I stand right at the hook. I always leave them be. But once you hook one person. You know how the group works.  Sometimes just carrying a person will show you the type of survivors you are dealing with.  If I start seeing survivors or start getting body blocked before or after hooking a survivor their is no point in me going to far. I go looking around my victims hooked area because I know a survivor is waiting to unhook. My goal is to kill survivors, not hook you and give you a freebie get off my hook and heal so I can chase you around again. Especially if you was a challenge to catch. 
---
If I chase someone and say 3 gens  are done by the time I get that one person.  Most likely, by the time I find someone else they have the gens completed. Which then I have a 50/50 chance of picking the right gate before it‚Äôs over. Why is it fair for survivors to rush the generators to end the match without giving me a good run at getting them?  The way the generators are easily done is the cause for killers hanging around a hooked victims area, because that is what draws the survivors in to give the killer a better chance at getting more Bp. 
---
It‚Äôs a two way street generators draw the killers to the survivors, the hooks draw the survivors to the killer. 
---
Then some survivors are just toxic, after downing them by a window. They  stay right under the window moving around so I go to pick them up, I climb in and out of the window multiple times.  Wasting my time.  
---
I can‚Äôt speak for all killers, but survivors body blocking while caring or hooking  really piss me off. So naturally I do what will piss them off.  Survivors that just want you to chase them in circles around objects and pallets is another piss me off.  Cause gens are being completed  while you waste time with the joker running in circles. But it‚Äôs a tactic to help survivors wins. 
---
So using a hook victim is a tactic for a killer to use.  I just do what I think will help me keep survivors from escaping. Sometime it works sometimes they all get away. Survivors that play fair and don‚Äôt gen rush complete I‚Äôll chase all over the map. But survivors that gen rush. Once I catch one survivor I use that survivor to my advantage to get my points.
---
Thanks dickhead
---
Sounds like the blame is on you and your potato mates then, not NOED
---
Playing as Myers with Monitor and Abuse and you walk round a corner and a survivor just runs straight into you not knowing you‚Äôre there. Almost had a real heart attack.
---
And how long to find the totem? If there‚Äôs more than 1 and all the gens are done really nothing can help your either all dying or your leaving people behind
---
Nothing dumb about that save at all, good job man.
---
It's noed 100 percent. I swear I haven't seen such bullshit in this game other than noed. It literally wins matches for unskilled players.
---

Every action you do in dead by daylight awards you blood points.  Ht a survivor, that's 300 blood points, hook a survivor, that's 500 blood points.  
---
They are a metric of how well you did in the match and you use them to level up your killers and survivors after each match.

I def saw a DBD dev drop the 5th in a comment on this sub.

Well, that would be cool but rank isn‚Äôt by character so idk how‚Äôd they do it
---
Uh no thanks, the waiting sucks enough in this game and I'd rather not be returned to the lobby because of one dude being a donkey
---
I'm a survivor main, but good try. When your argument is so weak you have to strawman everyone around you to even come up with a point.
---
Everyone here is telling you that you're wrong. Everyone here is telling you that your suggestion is bad.
---
You keep insisting that everyone else is wrong and you happen to be the only correct one.
---
Get over yourself. You have the ways of countering NOED. Either do them or stop bitching.
---
Yeah, but I don‚Äôt want to buy her just for one perk. I mean I want Object too, but I don‚Äôt plan on running that a lot so she‚Äôs still not that worth it for me. I know there‚Äôs a deal going on rn, but I only have a certain amount of auric cells and I want Yui (obviously), Steve, and maybe Nancy for her locker heal perk.
---
I main killer and I don‚Äôt get scared (usually), but sometimes I‚Äôll be SO TENSE when playing matches.
---
And it‚Äôs weird, since I‚Äôm not supposed to feel like that since, y‚Äôknow, I‚Äôm the one doing the killing.
---
Yes please, still very uninteractive to go against as a survivor. Not op, just unfun
---
You never unlocked them to begin with lmao
---
honestly people who prestige like morons deserve what they get
---
I am the guy that would instead say well played for the timing

Small model, very black skintone and dark clothing in a game that is, you guessed it, dark

Claudette is the ultimate Tryhard survivor character
---
Your cat must be great at keeping the *mice* out
---
That was some of the most rank 20 gameplay I‚Äôve ever seen
---
Other people don‚Äôt want noed to be changed so I‚Äôm wrong and you don‚Äôt have any points?
---
Hence why deep wounds was changed before the release of the new chapter. This is a GOOD example of design teams communicating with pre-release testers and programmers.
---
 were you playing as Nea
---
What's the highest max speed achievable by a killer under any circumstances?
---
Ranking in this game is total bs for starters. secondly, it still has a hefty learning curve just because of the sheer amount of stuff in it and bhvr wants to separate out new players or people who don't play much adequately. doesn't always work perfectly, but that's the reason
---
The rank just exists to separate people with stupid amounts of playtime from newer players so they don't get stomped, which the game does a poor job of doing. There's no reason to rank up which is why it can be considered casual. It's not a competitively balanced game anyways.
---
Ya my friends are pretty toxic but he did spend most of the game tunneling Lori so he was pretty stoked when I got the save on his death hook.
---
Sloppy was never that good since people didnt wanna heal vs legion anyway. A lot of legion players were trying to isentivise healing through perks like thana which still works. Mending time was never effected by thana since it was never considered healing. Remember me is in general a horrible perk at the moment after the end game collapse nerfs. Save the best for last is at best decent on legion because often times the survivors you run into will either be already injured or easily injurable cuz u have your power up. He has a lot of build diversity still. He can go a lot of stuff and so can a lot of killers. They are not optimal and as a matter of fact there is most likely a single perfectly optimal build for him since thats how optimal works. But he can run a lot of stuff that are good on almost any killer. Let me count some: Agitation, Ruin, BBq, Whispers, Pop Goes, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Infectious, Thrilling Tremors, Discordance, NOED, Shadowborn, Corrupt Inteverntion, Blood Warden, Dying light, Thana. These are the ones you can run on them. Some are not the best perks thus they are not good on him. The only real perk legion lost however is save the best for last. And his slowdown was nice but never the focal point it was him being able to get multiple stabs fast which he can now get faster.
---
Add the pink add on where you see injured survs while traversing and that sounds naastyy.
---
Oh, you.
---
Thats how it be on console, aiming sucks
---
HERE HE HIS AGAIN
---
It's not a mild convenience when I'm grinding up to prestige 3. Each prestige costs about 1.5 million bp. Another 500k-750k bp to get bill to level 40 is straight up BS! Players who already had it should be able to keep it unlocked.
---
You stressed the body blocking a lot. There are three things I know make survivors want to body block you while carrying another. 1)To give them more time to wiggle, and if you hit them, that also gives them more time to wiggle. The sooner you hit them the better. 2) They get I believe ‚Äúprotection‚Äù blood points. 3) the get rank points. That‚Äôs what I learned.
---
No they were not. They were freely given to you before because Bill wasn't on console. You did not "unlock" them at all.
---
That‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs just that these things can still happen, and with the reputation that behavior has on this sub a lot of people probably expect it.
---
yea ok fair point
---
You literally can't balance a 4v1
---
It's already unbalanced from the start
---
Four survivor players versus one killer player
---
There's so many variables and this isn't like some other game where you can change one thing that balances everyone, like say league of legends where both sides have the options to pick the same champions and it's 5v5 or in rainbow 6, cs:go, literally any other game can come closer to balance but even they aren't balanced. 
---
The word balance in this game gets misused as "Tip the scale in my favor on this *Insert complaint here* " 
---
This game is great, buggy as fuck but great. It's so good you keep playing it even with all this broken shit so the best you can do is relax and either enjoy what we have or take a break while they patch some stuff, which they have and will continue doing.
---
Yes I don‚Äôt have any other points as to why NOED should not be nerfed, but others do, and their points outweigh yours. If you can‚Äôt think of explanations that counter theirs, your idea is bad. That‚Äôs how arguments work.
---
Wether they want NOED changed or not doesn‚Äôt matter, as they explain why it‚Äôs ok as it is, or shouldn‚Äôt be nerfed.
---
Bill‚Äôs perks haven‚Äôt been like that for a while. How are you now just finding that out? Also you really have no reason to be upset. Every one else was forced to grind to get those perks in one way or another. It shouldn‚Äôt be any different for console players. Especially now that we have Bill for free. The only reason you can really be mad is that you spent bp on leveling up those perks for nothing. My best advice would be to just play the character your prestiging and get a shit ton of bp then prestige your character and level up Bill with the rest. It doesn‚Äôt take as long as you think to level a character up to 40.
---
Oh no, now I ship Oni and Plague
---
I see myself in this picture (doing it) and I don‚Äôt like it
---
And bill came out
---
First he's picking your perks and now he's trying to show you how to 360, clearly you should pay attention to this purrfect survivor main.
---
okay so you get the issue you just don't give a fuck because muh narrative
---
Poor frank. ü¶É
---
Defnitiely not. his undetectable last like 2 seconds out of a portal without addons, so irrelevant that I dont know why the mechanic launched with him. 
---
And even with add ons, it's irrelevant because every time he teleports, everyone in the level hears his "I AM TELEPORTING VERY STEALTHILY" roar for some reason. and if he teleports near you, you also hear his second roar as he emerges. and then you combine that with the fact that activated portals are obnoxiously loud too.
---
what you're suggesting could work, but it's not stealthy, more like a high pressure tracking build. It could sync well with the add on that allows you to see injured survivors while teleporting.
---
If you like a Roleplaying mindset while playing this game, I find it the easiest to put myself in their shoes.... that's why I main them... plus their masks are cute as heck... k bye &lt;3
---
Well she is the entity so...
---
Hey, I‚Äôve been thinking about getting a dbd tattoo, just unsure about what from the game to get. That would be a great idea, but do you have any other dbd designs that you liked?
---
How about we just give him each respective survivor‚Äôs clothes, instead? Imagine Demodoggo wearing Dwight‚Äôs clothes.
---
But I have said my side which goes against theirs.their points were just do totems and as a solo survivor it can be very time consuming or even pointless when you need people doing gens, looping the killer or saving people
---
It's really infuriating when you're a rank 8 and get matched with rank seventeens (even the killer). The amount of times I've been left on hook to die or forced to do every gen this week is ridiculous
---
When I started the game, I didn‚Äôt know anything about teachables until I leveled Kate to 30. Which was after leveling up some other characters and just trying the game out in general. Was really annoyed because I wanted Self-care and I could‚Äôve just leveled up Claudette from the beginning. So I kinda feel your pain. I just don‚Äôt think you should be angry about it. Just mildly upset maybe.
---
I'm grinding up to prestige 3. Each prestige costs about 1.5 million bp. Another 500k-750k bp to get bill to level 40 is straight up BS! Players who already had it should be able to keep it unlocked.
---
Horde of Kates. üñ§
---
Make it skillchecks then.
---
I mean if you know the layout of theater then you can end chases extremely quickly with all the ins and outs doors connecting there only pathways to escape
---
And before he came out those perks were unlocked.
---
Then play in groups.
---
Also, their explanations all counter yours, as all you said was ‚Äúbut I don‚Äôt wanna do totems, I‚Äôm solo, it‚Äôs not visible to me‚Äù
---
They have many more reasons beyond just doing totems.
---
Bring a perk. Bring an item. Remember totem placement. Remember what kind of foliage a totem can spawn at.

20 bloodwebs really isn't all that many though? I know that I didn't get BBQ 1 on Meyers until around level 50, but maybe that's just my luck
---
Can you use firecrackers for them?
---
He‚Äôs just really loud in general. I mean, I get that he‚Äôs somewhere between 400 and 600 pounds heavy, but holy shit. It‚Äôs like someone‚Äôs banging a drum when he walks.
---
Flair most definitely does not check out
---
I legit got jumscares when i lost a survivor and started looking for blood, i somehow got near a pallet walking backwards and another survivor that was hiding there dropped it, i think it barely got my hitbox because i wasn't that close to the pallet.
---
So if they're locked now, what were they before? And they weren't "free." Those perks cost me BP!! Use your brain.
---
Run to the killer or make noise to alert them. Be hooked then suicide.
---
Play Wraith and don't move.
---
Literally me
---
O-o I actually don't know
---
Yes but you do have giant spiders so I don‚Äôt really see a difference
---
Is this supposed to be a comment that makes sense? I honestly don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre even trying to say.
---
never had that happen. sounds like your ps4 might be overheating when in the game
---
Im the killer lmao
---
Nvm my bad sorry fam thanks ;;)
---
Then play in groups, that‚Äôd lead to more gen rushing I‚Äôm guessing you play killer and you know how annoying that can be when you can‚Äôt do anything, you shouldn‚Äôt have to bring an item or perk to which you still have to spend time, detectives hunch you have to finish a gen near a totem and something like a map doesn‚Äôt last forever and I didn‚Äôt say they weren‚Äôt visible it takes a lot of time to find them when there are more important tasks to do
---
That is true but I would like a mode where it doesn't matter what rank you are you can experiment a little bit and not be curb-stomped
---
Jake looks like Miles Edgeworth from Ace Attorney.
---
How does it not work with furitive chase?
---
This window is nasty ... But its funny to abuse it so
---
I'd just take a drink while waiting out the endgame collapse timer. When they start being a dick to you through messaging reply extremely kind and tell them that they're very good at the game. This will put them off big time. At the other end of the line is someone that's so desperate for attention and confirmation of his skill, they expect you to respond like an asshole and when they get the confirmation of their skill that they crave so bad they'll probaly stop replying or proceed to apologise for their bad behaviour.
---
They did way back at release of pig. Thats when i started.
---
No, if they're locked now, what were they before? Just answer the question.
---
You're wrong. Free means it costs nothing. I paid BP for those perks!
---
Oh survive with friends can be easily beaten they said it's nothing to worry about they said. Survive with friends have become a scourge. As much as some Killers hate to admit it. It's very difficult to pull any well thought of plays when they can just talk to each other revealing where you are and everything else.
---
Then they do the most toxic shit at the end of the game
---
I don't think they mentioned they were fixing the charge addons yet.
---
thank you &lt;3 it was so much work but definitely worth it
---
You are correct
---
We thought Kate would look most Christmas-like :D
---
When leveling Demogorgon i didn't get BBQ 1 until way after P3 50. Not a single tier until 200+ levels into him.

And a instant case of PTSD
---
Yeah, this one‚Äôs the right one. If you‚Äôre 12, you‚Äôll be reset to 13. I did this a few nights ago too - won‚Äôt be able to play again until after reset most likely - so congrats to us both :)
---
That's shape
---
that would be by far the greatest achievment of my life, but i dont think we will get that :D
---
thank you &lt;3
---
if your at rank 1-4 it will set you to rank 5. if your rank 5-8 it will set you to rank 9. pretty much just the highest rank of the last colour.
---
That's rough, but at least you know you will get it eventually
---
There‚Äôs threads from days after Pig‚Äôs release that state otherwise though
---
What if the killer isn‚Äôt trapper and you brought small game? Just deal with the fact you only have a benefit when you get hooked?
---
Yes. Yes you do. You accept the fact Lady Luck has gone against you.
---
Other hexes spawn from beginning because they stay active with their effect the majority of the game if not the entirety. NOED only works during the final few moments, it‚Äôs a last chance type of perk that punishes survivors who didn‚Äôt think twice and realize the killer might have NOED.
---
Also, if it only activated when exit gates are open, then the survivors have already won. All it would do is give the killer a small itty bitty chance to punish overly cocky survivors. It‚Äôs a ‚Äútaunt to get bodied‚Äù only perk as a result of your idea.
---
what anime is this? :o
---
Just use thanataphobia, they'll cleanse most of the time. If not they'll have constant full stack thana.
---
I can understand this completely but when she gets that corrupt Purge and destroys everybody with it...
---
How do can you get it?
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but the amount of BP it took for you to unlock those perks doesn‚Äôt compare to the amount normal players spend leveling Bill up. Although I do agree they should have given you some BP to make up for the BP that you did lose.
---
Final few moments which is why I said change it to after the exit gates have been opened cause if someone‚Äôs using remember me it would take a lot longer and what are you on about trapper and small game nobody uses that
---
okay you're totally braindead
---
good luck out there you're gonna need it
---
I was the Jeff and I still have nightmares. you dont want to know what they did with me off-camera.
---
I dunno what you're getting at here
---
Some people are just cunts. I‚Äôll admit, I teabag, but it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúgg‚Äù. Only at the end or if I know I‚Äôm not getting out. It‚Äôs also not excessive. It‚Äôs literally tap tap and then I‚Äôm about my way. If there‚Äôs a face camping asshole, I will obnoxiously teabag cuz fuck that guy. But you can‚Äôt take anything personal. As a survivor main, survivors are toxic af to each other a lot of the time. Bringing the killer to you over and pointing you out. Blowing gens and body blocking you in so you get caught. Farming unsafe hook saves (when they clearly know better). It‚Äôs so bizarre. We‚Äôre supposed to be working together for a common goal! But, some people are just cunts. I think it really is just simple as that.
---
Because shapes don‚Äôt have genders. Duh.
---
Do hope and adrenaline stack?
---
By default, we now have our official cat.
---
Congrats
---
Its really not that bad
---
unless i see the killer blatantly pass up a hook, i'm struggling. because i have no idea if they're going to be friendly.
---
i just assume the killer is going to... y'know, kill me.
---
Hope it doesn't sound too rude, but how can you be so low ranked af that many games?
---
Demodoggo?
---
Well it‚Äôs her power that I think would mess with me. I‚Äôve played a few matches of base level killers (for the rituals) and I lost players while following scratch marks. I mean I have a better understanding of looping and how killers should play because I watch ppl play killer frequently. But I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be able to translate that into actual good gameplay as killer.
---
Yet you can use them. You can use small game.
---
Anyway, back to the important stuff
---
Did you read what I said? If it only activated when gates are open, that means survivors have already escaped. The only benefit to it is to take down people who haven‚Äôt already left or are taunting you from the gate.
---
Question, did you mean when the gates are POWERED or OPENED?
---
Doesn't bother me non but that's a good idea
---
These responses are killing me. Basically because you prestiged it reset the perks, you must reaquire all perks you purchased previously BUT because Bill was added AFTER you got them originally you will no longer have them all until Bill is level 40. Not so hard to understand. Prestiging = reset, reset = back to square 1.
---
Is Lithe actually good? I feel like with how many bs window hits I get on both sides thanks to dedicated servers that it'd be pointless.
---
Link to his patch notes.
---
We‚Äôre lucky we *even* had it for free. 500k bloodpoints ain‚Äôt shit and always buy the brown items. When the new rift drops just hit it hard and you‚Äôll have it in no time. If you‚Äôre *going* to be playing anyways, just do it
---
Honey, we did a pretty good job so farüíï
---
It's your rank. Took me like 15 minutes to get a match as killer when I was at that rank. You will have a better time after rank reset on the 13th.
---
It's the worst one because you waste way too much time by not running everywhere and your chases end up shorter because you miss the part where you're leading the killer before your speed activates.
---
Not necessarily if someone is hooked then your not going to leave them and if you do your a bad survivor and you can use small game but there‚Äôs no point it‚Äôs pretty much useless and I meant opened
---
You guys might just be good killers.
---
&gt; And I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúmuh narrative‚Äù is supposed to mean, no.
---
Ah, I see. I was making fun of you for discarding the poor nature of the stats because you want to frame the game as killer sided
---
&gt; I‚Äôm saying that data from thousands of games is better for statistical analysis than data from 15
---
Considering not a single person is saying otherwise, this is a strange point to make.
---
But you can collect all the numbers in the world, but if they are not properly controlled, then you cannot make any statement at all with them. They're meaningless. The data is corrupted by survivors escaping because of an AFK killer. It's corrupted by survivors going on suicide missions to save one person. It's corrupted by a ton of variables and we have no idea how substantive they are at all, so you don't know how afflicted the data is. Obviously it doesn't render the data necessarily meaningless; you can still make very basic statements like "this is how many survivors died in the time period," but that's about it. Makinf a substantive analytical analysis about game balance, like you are, requires more.
---
This is literally high school level shit
---
&gt; Nice new username btw HexOhJeezOhNo. I wonder how long before this one gets banned as well.
---
I... have no idea what this means but okay. any beef you have with another user has nothing to do with statistical analysis
---
Just came back to DbD after a really long break. I last played briefly when Legion came out. A few questions about what i've missed: 
---
1. Why can't i seem to get into a game as killer? I've waited for 20+ minutes multiple times, and have yet to get a game? 
---
2. It seems Legion is bad, evidenced by all the Legion is bad memes ive seen on here. Can someone explain why?
---
3. What exactly is the Battle Pass and how is it different from this archives thing? 
---
Thank you in advance for any answers/insight!
---
I find this game way to scary as survivor
---
i usually go there first when im killer for that very reason. also if im playing trapper i gave as many traps as possible and trap the 3 gens that are blocked.
---
Look dude, I‚Äôve explained enough, listen closely
---
Your idea
---
Is
---
Not
---
Good
---
Look at all the reasons people came up with that explain why compared to all yours. They outweigh your reasons both in quality and quantity. I don‚Äôt wanna spend any more time on this! This is nonsense!
---
Also my third Point brings up the fact that this game doesn't seem that fit for a battle pass.
---
And we will judge you for that.
---
That's how this works. You're free to do, say, and think whatever you like. We're free to judge you based on those actions.
---
Let me tell you something!
---
60% of the time, it works, everytime
---
One of the biggest issues with Legion is how unfun it is to have to constantly mend. This changes nothing in that respect.
---
Otherwise, this is basically old Legion; i.e. agonizing to play against and still weak.
---
You say this yet you can not disprove me chances are you rely on noed I‚Äôve countered everything you‚Äôve said I win you lose you‚Äôve made yourself look like a clown ü§°
---
My team earlier. Someone cleansed and she downed me in 0.4 seconds. I‚Äôm in purple ranks so they should know better by now üôÑ
---
These types of players are the biggest pricks. I swear, they have the worst superiority complexes I've ever seen. 99% of hate-mail I get is from toxic Survivors who were angry I didn't let them bully me.
---
They do stack but you're probably better off just running one of the two and the legion pin for the broken status effect (at least for my perk build).
---
Water into wine
---
You mean Hellbent speaking as if he just got beat up as a 14 year old going through puberty
---
Then yes, yes I did
---
Yeah Sanctum of Wrath is a Yamaoka mapso just using the family crest thing will do it
---
Probably the best quality ones I‚Äôve seen are the darkride studios ones. No clue if they‚Äôre selling at the moment.
---
They didn‚Äôt cost 500k BP. BP don‚Äôt cost real world money. Is that fair to PC users who had to buy bill just to unlock the perks? No. So we got the benefit of the doubt for not being able to have bill. We *were* lucky. Don‚Äôt run those perks if you don‚Äôt want to *earn* them. Cmon man
---
Probably because that‚Äôs the only person available. Would you rather just wait in queue?
---
No killer instinct? You can mend while running so you save a lot of time? Nah?
---
Oh really? I just gave you another fucking response before this one countering yours. I myself never even use NOED! I much prefer STBFL, Brutal Strength, Iron Grasp, and the good old favorite of mine, the fantastic mr agitation!
---
Now who‚Äôs the clown again? None of us. I don‚Äôt care if I win or lose, what I do care about is proving that your idea is bad.
---
Nearly fucking everyone disagrees with you. That means you ain‚Äôt thinking right.
---
we dont really need cross play. just remove the ranking system that way everyone queues with everyone it cuts out the time it takes to match people. not like it works any way
---
Peanits said: "If you already have the perks, you keep them."
---
This is not true. I already purchased these perks from the bloodweb, long before Bill was even a twinkle in the eyes of consoles, but now I lost these perks. This is so wrong man.
---
Default pooh: Killing
---
Tuxedo pooh: tunneling.
---
Feel free to! It'd actually honor me if someone used this for their content creation purposes!
---
Just make sure to give credit.
---
So what have you said that counters mine? And why so defensive you definitely use noed
---
**yes**
---
You will be judged as well.
---
It's literally a lose-lose either way with Plague, and I'd rather be a two hit kill than a one hit kill.
---
Survivors: ‚ÄúKillers are overpowered! Nerf killers! Nerf this! Nerf that! Killers trying to win is unfun! It‚Äôs toxic! Killers need to care about our fun!‚Äù
---
Also Survivors: ‚ÄúWhy does no one want to play Killer for us?‚Äù
---
-----
---
Crossplay won't help because you'll just be waiting in a queue of **all** survivors across **all** platforms. Every platform and every region is having long survivor queues brought on by a drought of killers in mid to low ranks.
---
(Except OCE, oddly... Go you guys!)
---
"You guys are just mean! Someone will write something nice about me in the comments!"
---
You realize the original issue with Legion was that he could break chase by moonwalking and the bleedout timer would go down. You've re-added this feature with no counter.
---
And now they can't even hear noise notifications? Or detect heartbeats? Or have any pressure whatsoever?
---
This is old Legion, but so, so much worse. With all due respect, you need to go back to the drawing board.
---
"Congratulation, you just played yourself" so how many traps is too many in the basement?
---
Because balance matters to me. Now I‚Äôm gonna show you the comment I made real quick that responded to yours. Check it out for Christ‚Äôs sake.
---
Ok do what you want I don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs just unreasonable for you to say all this bull shit that doesn‚Äôt make any sense like why are you mad as the consumer for the game working like how it‚Äôs supposed to and your not spending any money on leveling up characters so your barley even a consumer
---
And then you prestiged...
---
that sucks that ur experiences have been bad. i think the whole pig mask is creepy in design. but i understand wht u mean
---
I love urban evade towards the Myers and drop a pallet from behind stunning him and watching him do a 180 swing.
---
Yeah I do see what you‚Äôre saying, she‚Äôs definitely one of the most awkward to go up against
---
but if you go there first, doesn't that defeat the purpose? doesn't that mean you're not generating map pressure on the generators?
---
Look through the thread, all of it, for the comment that has
---
# this comment
---
Written at its bottom
---
 thank you &lt;3 there's also a give away on my youtube channel for a dlc of your choice or 1100 auric cells. Just count the dwights an comment how many dwight are in this video in the youtube comments. &lt;3 [Click Here](https://youtu.be/O9EhE6pA1U0)
---
&gt;  I‚Äôm not suggesting that the game is killer sided, I‚Äôm suggesting that Tru3 is being silly for thinking his 15 games is more scientific than stats from the devs 
---
I don't know anything about tru3's wraith thing. it looked like when you said "BHVR: Don‚Äôt use the data to draw too many assumptions, interpreting data can be complex" you were making a reference to the same argument survivor mains have been desperately making since bhvr put that data out and i'm unaware of tru3 referencing the data so i assumed it was just a non-sequitur because i see a lot of survivor mains doing that. sorry for that misunderstanding.
---
i still have an issue with how you perceive the data, just from a basic statistical analysis standpoint, though 
---
&gt; Don‚Äôt play dumb. ;) You could at least try to hide it but I don‚Äôt think you have the self control. I give you a month on this account, tops.
---
I'm going to be very frank:
---
you are yelling at an imaginary person. 
---
you can continue believing otherwise, it does not matter to me.
---
if this is truly something you need to believe for whatever reason, be my guest. but seeing ghosts like that is not healthy
---
why struggle anyway. they're going to make it to a hook regardless.
---
K but memes aside that's terrible for both your mouse and your cat. If they bite into the wire the wrong way they have a chance of electrocuting themselves. Thankfully it's a mouse wire (not the computer power cord which carries a far stronger current) but the point still stands that you really need to protect your wires around a curious feline.
---
Cheap and easy option is to cover it with a few lines of duct tape. Outdoor rope can be bought from various home improvement stores and while it's a little bulky and makes you look like a Freddy main it's very sturdy and will keep claws and jaws away from the wires.
---
Yeah. But I'm not the one bitching and whining about my video game on a public forum.
---
Sooooo.... Yeah, go ahead. I'm not too bothered by what you think because you don't really matter too much. You're the one that wants our attention and our approval.
---
thank you &lt;3 we also thought kate would be best for a christmas theme
---
Also if you can‚Äôt find it, I will make another exactly like it.
---
The guy that makes those ones doesn‚Äôt take orders anymore. Thank you anyways!
---
Idk why survivors have to be toxic. I'm a survivor main and avoid the t bagging and only point at toxic killers and I've seen a bunch of them, hiding in the basement while someone's on the hook. That really grinds my gears. But I also get mad at survivor teammates who are toxic for no reason. I had a friendly trapper and we all knew he was letting us do gens. I don't mind, really. The extra bp for all of us is nice every once in a while. But instead of doing gens a Steve was blinding the guy for no reason. It just felt like he was unnecessarily taking advantage of the situation. I got in front and started pointing at him to do gens üòÇ 
---
Anyway, you should play wiff me üòÇ I do my best to be a good sport. üòÅ
---
Ok like I said that wasn‚Äôt my only idea and that didn‚Äôt really prove me wrong ü§°ü§°
---
I can say I have had more jump scares playing killer than survivor. Forget to turn down your headset? Have a nice heart attack when you kick a pallet, on us!
---
&gt; Anyone else running NOED just kind of disappoints me when I get hit by it
---
I despise NOED and DS, they're pity perks to reward bad players. I guess they added them so people didn't feel like shit for not being able to get kills or loop the killer to give them a 2nd chance. The thing that sucks most about them, is that they're easily abusable by good or great players.  
---
Had a couple games last night where I straight up did work.. unhooking, looping, gens and sadly just got caught out and got hooked and died because of NOED at the end. Nothing more demoralizing. Use to be the same with DS before the re-work, was maddening to have some player loop you into the ground, when you finally downed them just to get DS'd and then have to spend another 5 mins getting looped hoping they slip up.  At least now you get 1 hook out of a player like that before getting spun
---
The fact the gates are opened makes it worse
---
A smart survivor will not open gates until a bud is unhooked. Making the perk fucking useless AGAIN.
---
Also, we already have ‚Äúhooked survivor camped by NOED killer‚Äù situations. Hell the killer doesn‚Äôt even need NOED. Just hit the rescuer as they go for rescue, then hit them again before they get away, meaning they get a free hook victim replacement.
---
Also it‚Äôs not required that you save the hook victim. It‚Äôs optional. I‚Äôll leave someone‚Äôs ass if I know the killer has NOED and the gates are OPENED because of endgame collapse. There‚Äôs no time to do totems at that point.
---
# this comment. I‚Äôve posted it before. Now read it.
---
I'm so gonna buy that. Maybe we'll do even more songs.Maybe even with a elf dwight
---
That's just Marmite. He's cool.
---
I remember when I first got ds I was also a baby survivor.
---
But why jerk these pricks off? They don't deserve any validation.
---
Oho yes it did
---
I love that vocabulary
---
How ü§°ü§°
---
&gt; I love how I keep bringing up the fact that this is a rant
---
okay? that doesn't mean you're magically not wrong
---
&gt; Usually those people are in a survive with friends group.
---
I can't even tell what this is supposed to be replying to in my comment
---
&gt; Also are you missing the point of why I made this entire thing
---
The post itself? No I didn't. I actually replied directly to it elsewhere.
---
But this issue we're discussing now about the game being casual is separate
---
How many bloodwebs did I have to go through to get all three perks up to tire 3?!?!
---
Free means it costs nothing. These perks were not free. I paid a ton of BP to purchase them from the bloodweb.
---
Yeah right. I lost them and didn't get to keep them.
---
Use directional headphones and listen for their breathing when they are injured, it's alot easier than just following the scratch marks themselves.
---
Somehow, even though this has been in the game for like half a year now, this bug still hasn't been patched.
---
...And I destroyed your point
---
Lemme re-read it. You are genuinely driving me up the wall.
---
How many killere hurt your feelings?
---
Alright fine let's try this then
---
Lmao you can‚Äôt win your trying to prove me wrong but you can‚Äôt ü§°ü§°
---
Well still in my opinion he is op
---
Do they deserve it? No of course not. But they need it so bad. Gotta show you're more grown up than them
---
I find the killer queues to be way longer than survivor queues.
---
Am I the only one?üôÉ
---
That.. actually sounds good.
---
No worries. I guess I worded myself badly if the downvotes are anything to go by. I‚Äôm just not a fan of all the black and white thinking people do in this game and Tru3 contributes to it, imo.
---
&gt; i still have an issue with how you perceive the data, just from a basic statistical analysis standpoint, though
---
You don‚Äôt know how I perceive the data. All I‚Äôve said is that throwing it all away as useless trash because it‚Äôs a generalised overview is not the right way to approach it, and neither is using it as definite proof of most things.
---
Why did he say this if it wasn't true?
---
1. i want my points
---
2. you never know if they're trying for a basement escape, so i may be able to get out and earn some precious BP
---
Read.
---
I do have every teachable in the game
---
Same here! But the cat sits on my lap and snuggles the controller during chase
---
Oddly enough I would possibly try to free him
---
Or I would leave silently feeling bad and not teabagging because that... event that happened to him is just out of everyone‚Äôs control
---
i was just giving an opinion if you dont like it thats fine
---
So now you sound like a pedophile and you don‚Äôt seem calm so you didn‚Äôt win and if we threw fisticuffs I would win I‚Äôm like aj strong and as fast as mike Tyson ü§°üòú
---
You look just like Englund! God, I want that version in the game, along with the iconic music.
---
Shut up before I break your kNeas.
---
The fucking Luigi‚Äôs mansion music killed me
---
Nope, Claudette
---
Dead by Daylight Amino
---
Sweet, well have fun waiting 30+ minutes each game.
---
honest question, has anyone ever been banned from dead by daylight? i encounter so many shitheads that i just assume no one's ever been hit by the banhammer
---
Im not about legion, about title
---
If you've been away for a while, your killer rank is probably 20, or close to. For some reason, matchmaking has a difficult time finding a match for those ranks. As you continue to rank up it gets quicker. Even by the time you get to 15, it's much quicker in my experience.
---
Legion has been nerfed several times in the past 6 months or so (and most recently just a week or so ago). I don't play Legion, so I'm not the best person to explain why they're so terrible now, but the short of it is their power can no longer down someone, so decent survivors don't really see them as a threat.
---
The battle pass, or Rift, is just a way to earn extra cosmetics for people who play the game a lot. It costs 1000 Auric cells (10 USD), and can gradually earn back the Auric cells by completing the pass.
---
The Rift exists aside from the Archives. The Archives are to expand on the game lore, and to offer XP through challenges which help to complete the Rift. That said, you can complete the Archives without buying the Rift pass, and you can complete the Rift without worrying about the Archives.
---
It's not an opinion, just stating a fact.
---
Maybe killer‚Äôs should be able to vault through those short fences at any location, while the survivors only on the given ones?
---
the entity loves you just the way you are.
---
For fucking real though
---
Fantastic!
---
Well, I got bad news for you, sport. bhvr is never going to institute a penalty for this. Ever. And it still isn't clear why there should be one.
---
Lobbies don't get dodged that frequently, for starters. Secondly, lobbies are not that long.
---
Has BHVR even mentioned Legion changes?
---
Good David good, now kill him.
---
On top of what the others mentioned, your teammates can wake you up as long as they're awake, so use the failed skill checks as a last option.
---
What was the original?
---
1 million will get you too level 38
---
I wait on average 2-3 minutes for balanced games though lol. Not sure why you're so salty
---
Good kitty
---
They have, but it's few and far between. Takes a lot and for the Devs to really notice it. Or exploit abuse...
---
Honestly, there should be more punishments. And the DC punishments will help towards that. But toxicity like in OP's situation should be punished more as well.
---
And you're hoping to have gotten bbq after 20 webs? It could be a lonnngggg while before it shows up. I also have every survivor teachable and it took me so many webs to get just one perk I wanted I someone.
---
Bruh, and you now have to do that twice LIKE WE ALWAYS SHOULD HAVE. Get over yourself bruh, they didn‚Äôt have to give it to us for free to begin with. It should‚Äôve been always behind 500k bloodpoints. You should be fucking bowing down on your hands and knees for giving them your 2 favorite crutch perks for free. And this is coming from a survivor main. You just sound spoiled at this point.
---
Played the long game and actually worked
---
All Killers except Hag and Huntress can achieve a permanent 5.2m/s (130%) speed using Play With Your Food as long as they don't hit anyone.

Me: o boi a challenge

This is amazing!! can you do one for Yui and add some synthwave track? please

Tell your kids Jeff is Jesus and we have a deal.

BHVR: ‚ÄúWorking as intended‚Äù
---
If he played normal i would have tried the same. But he was camping the basement pretty hard. 
---
He placed three traps to make sure no-one can get past him
---
The Coldwind farm with the barn, the 2 lockers that spawn opposite side of the window. I hate those so much.
---
The cat is the real killer. When you are bout to drop a pallet on the killer the cat will yoink your mouse and you won't be able to loop the killer
---
You read. Peanits was clear in what was said: "If you already have the perks, you keep them."
---
‚ÄúHolding M1 on totem is boring, holding M1 on gen is fun.‚Äù
---
I loved balanced landing, it was so useful... I don't like getting stunned when I jump bc the killer doesn't get stunned at all.
---
Now it has become an useless perk for me. It's not worth it. I'm using dead hard instead.
---
It would had been better if they just closed/moved the windows in haddonfield...
---
Man, that title make me wanna ‚úÇÔ∏èüëÄ
---
You're the exact reason that I know where it is once the game starts.
---
&gt; No worries. I guess I worded myself badly if the downvotes are anything to go by. I‚Äôm just not a fan of all the black and white thinking people do in this game and Tru3 contributes to it, imo.
---
eh, i was going off of trends which isn't always fair
---
It is useless trash. It literally tells us nothing
---
That's not a bug it's intended. Seeing rank/prestige WAS the bug ; _;
---
You said the mending can only be done up to a certain point. As long as that's true, the second that 70% is reached, the Legion can start moonwalking and instantly end the chase, negating any reason to mend at all. You may as well just have the timer begin at 30%.
---
Even with the ability to move while mending, it is still an unfun and tedious mechanic that should not be the core of a Killer's power.
---
If you can't accept criticism, then don't post suggestions.
---
&gt;Yes I had them on my survivor, until I prestiged.
---
# Nobody Forced You To Prestige
---
Please understand that, don't bring up prestige as an argument when it's entirely optional and was of your own volition to do so.
---
&gt;Why am I now forced to level up until I reach the teachable for Bill if I already purchased those perks from the bloodweb??
---
**A response from Peantis on the matter**
---
&gt;To put it simply, they are his perks.
---
&gt;When the console versions of the game came out, we did not have permission to add Bill to console. To make sure that console players weren't missing out, the perks were added with different icons as generic perks.
---
&gt;Now that he's on console, those perks became his again. Now it's the same between all platforms.
---
&gt;If you already have the perks, you keep them. If you don't have the perks, you need to unlock the teachables in order to find them. It's the same as PC now.
---
Please read it carefully and don't argue about it without bringing this point up, thank you.
---
&gt;This is so messed up. The players who purchased them from the bloodweb before Bill came to console should be able to keep those perks unlocked.
---
**You were allowed to keep them**, they didn't remove them from anyone's Survivors. The only way to remove them was to prestige **of your own volition** and you accept to lose any non-character teachable when doing so.
---
And it even warns you what happens before accepting to do so.
---
&gt;The addition of Bill onto console was handled extremely poorly.
---
This is opinion based, I found it to be  reasonable and fair on how they decided to handle it. Available to any Survivor before Bill was added, when he was added you kept any of the perks for Survivors who had them and they didn't forcibly remove them from you.
---
PC Players didn't magically get them for free and had to grind for them, so do you now and you have to just grit your teeth and accept it because they probably won't change it anytime soon if ever.
---
&gt;"If you already have the perks, you keep them."
---
&gt;This is not true. I couldn't keep them!!!
---
Because you **of your own volition** prestiged without checking to make absolutely sure his teachables were unlocked before doing so.
---
And the entire comment was
---
You'll just have to accept it and deal with it, the mistake was entirely on you for lack of precaution and i'm sorry you feel so strongly about it.
---
Building off 2.
---
Legion isnt particularly lethal. His ability doesnt allow you to down anybody, which makes him have more or less 0 pressure in the match. His tracking is only useful for hitting people with Frenzy, which isnt exactly great and you cant really use FF for map mobility very well since youre stunned right after it ends and they can just bolt off.
---
Plague and him essentially end up doing the same exact thing, but Plague is permanent unless they heal, which gives her the single most strong attack in the game that isnt an instadown, has a passive breaking effect, and spreads it to other survivors.
---
Yeah I realise what I said was stupid lemme retry  I hate doing gens and totems I wanna be chased
---
You do keep them but you prestiged so you lost them. Read that, understand that, if you can't there's no hope for you. Bill to level 40, simple.
---
That's broken af
---
Mike tython!
---
"No balls, no balls, do it pussy"
---
oh so now its not okay to put the soundtracks even if you mention who created them?
---
Link to the patch notes that says we will lose our perks!!!!
---
"baby Ash"
---
Shit that makes me feel old D:
---
In the AM I always seem to find rank 11 and above (im rank 1). No quarter, No mercy, No prisoners.
---
If I remember correctly, according to the lore, Killers chill in their own realms until they're called upon for trials. So technically, yes, she does.
---
I was walking around Lery's and I didn't know where the killer was or who they were yet so I was sneaking around and turn a corner into the office area and right there in front of me, Suddenly Piggy. Scared the shit out of me.
---
My friend made fun of me for screaming.
---
Post this on r/StabbyGang
---
Agreed to an extent however if I see a newbie survivor and hook them, only to see them getting farmed by their better teammates I'll go for the teammates as the newbie is often no threat.
---
Not sure about the Killer one, sometimes I give a killer a hook if they failed to hook people before EGC on the unspoken condition two hooks given and I then escape.
---
However I've at times been matched against Brown rank Killers when I'm a red rank survivor and I have no way of knowing that until the end game most of the time. Post Game apology and bitching at the matchmaking is all I can do.
---
You can buy another mouse, he can‚Äôt, let him have it
---
He's not, your logic is just backwards.
---
i love the set! wish i was on pc üòî
---
Those are the best Billy plays. People just running right in front of you.
---
good one
---
you mean the most unbalanced perk in the game because last i checked theres no perk for killer that instantly lets you down someone and force them onto a hook
---
I like Legion. Always have a fun game when I play as him
---
Either we all get infected, cough our lungs up making stealth impossible especially if she can aura read, infect the most important parts of the map(generators, pallets, etc) or we clease and cross fingers she misses us?
---
I'd rather just DC that play against that bitch of a bastard killer. Fuck Plague.
---
Most killers go to their totems and it‚Äôs obvious why. That‚Äôs how I find 90% of Hex totems.
---
Meg's face is killing me
---
New map should just burn in Hell. Right next to Legion.
---
NOED is the same that the hatch, both can give a win to somenone who played bad, if you nerf NOED you need to nerf the hatch
---
He slows down to 86% movement speed when he revs his chainsaw, so you can literally just runaway from him and he cant do anything but stop revving. Almost every loop and environmental object in the game counters his chainsaw, run around things like trees when he starts the chainsawing and 90% of the time hes going to get stunned. Running a pallet, a window or anything with a big hitbox is a death sentence to Bubba himself. He's more or less forced to M1 you if you can run the loop properly.
---
He's also got horrible map pressure and if you time it right, you can literally run through his chainsaw and take no damage. Additionally, hes stuck having his tantrum for like 5 seconds after missing his hit, leaving you tons of time to run
---
It's about them being locked out of the bloodweb. Read!
---
It's not backwards at all, you're literally making no sense saying that. Queues should be a little longer to find a killer within a decent range of the survivors. Steamcharts show ~25,000 online at any given time, you can't honestly believe finding a reasonable killer would take 30 minutes.
---
Can't tell if you're trolling or just stupid haha
---
Glad to hear you're having fun! I've faced the Oni a few times, the first time he facecamped me lol.
---
It's always nice to come back from a break but honestly I can't go more than a few weeks before I'm playing again.
---
The tome challenges are awesome, and a good time to play some Killer again!
---
the game needs to recognize that the survivor is being chased to block windows, but the fence is to wide that the chase can break and the blocker wont happen.
---
I'd much prefer an update that adds a ton of map reworks. It would still be a really refreshing update, and would really add to game health.
---
Yeah definitely
---
You'd rather wait 5-15 mimutes for a game than play a few rank difference. Pretty stupid tbh.
---
They were removed. Like the non-100% map and moonlight offerings, anyone who has them can keep them and use them.
---
They aren't really that useful, so most people just keep them for collecting.
---
I believe the only splinters you can get right now are for the Shape, Nightmare, Pig, and Cannibal.
---
How is your game in Dutch language though?
---
Play wraith and go AFK like what most mentioned. It‚Äôs what I do sometimes to get my Adept achievements.
---
When I started playing Hag I was carrying someone and I walked over a trap and it went off. Scared the hell out of me. I swung at it, and shook my camera the second it went off. Turns out that it was because someone was behind me. I didn't realize that traps didnt go off for carried survivors for like 20 more games. I actively avoided my own traps while carrying people out of fear.
---
I guarantee you that all killers will agree with you and all survivors wil disagree.
---
I play 50/50 and haddonfield is already one of the easiest maps so sure, but it might get really killer sided with a change like that. I'd rather prefer for them to just put more holes in the fences
---
Nice grats. It's a good feeling when you finally get the one perk you're looking for.
---
I too hate hatch when playing survivor or killer it has helped me escape when I‚Äôve had a shit team and did 3 gens on my own with 1 dc 1 meg hiding in a basement locker and someone afk I wouldn‚Äôt of even had a chance I think you should need a certain amount of bloodpoints in each category or need a key
---
Is this a mask, or makeup?  This is top tier quality; I've never seen anything this good outside the movies.
---
Yes, I'm aware that you're a dunce that doesn't understand what prestiging does. ***YOU LOSE ALL PROGRESS***. If you hadn't prestiged you would still have the perks but because you did you lost them on that character, play the game, get Bill to 40, issue solved. Not like you lost that great of perks anyway.
---
Actually meta perks are useless. (Only if we are talking about survivors though). 
---
What people use these days? SB, SC, DS, Adrenaline? First one slows you down tremendously, as well as the second one (why people don't use medkits I wonder). And the last two perks are highly situational.
---
No. 1million BP gets you in the 36-39 ballpark depending on what you buy. I wouldn't prestige until you cap your bloodpoints.
---
&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;*We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here‚Äôs how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor‚Äôs rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
&gt;# New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

[DEVELOPER UPDATE | SEPTEMBER 2019
---
](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019)
---
Just people saying that we should hold back on new players. They need to learn if they wanna get better
---
You thought your first encounter would be with a survivor, but it was me, Dio!
---
Ahh
---
Well, the thing is that killers are able to hit over the fence, if they are standing close enough. This may seem useless, but I‚Äôve won a game this way. I think vaulting over any area of the fence, as it would end a lot of other, easier loops on the map, and force it around the houses and pallets.
---
Oh did they remove the three teachable from all your Survivors when the update hit?
---
If so you have any screenshots or anything showing they just straight up deleted the three perks from your character's list?
---
Because you shouldn't take a response **out of context to make your argument look better**.
---
[Take this link](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/77137/why-do-i-have-to-unlock-bills-perks) and edit your OP with it telling people to "scroll down to Peanits's first response" if you have a problem with it.
---
# Do not take a part of it out of context to make yourself look better
---
You do not stop "mending" you stop gaining progress, but the game still would consider it as "mending". Same as you reach maximum progress in recovering, but you can keep holding the button and continue recovering with no progress
---
Doctor and Plague means ultimate noise.
---
So rank 20 surv can be sent against rank 1 survs? Nice, gj :)
---
I hate the song. Like you did good. I just hate the original version so much that by proxy i hate all parodies of it too. Good job. I hate it but good job.
---
I wish people would stop hating on Moris.  They're already garbage for pipping unless the killer hooks people twice.  
---
Killer instant moris people means they're screwing themselves out of chaser and malicious points.  It's the same problem if a match ends too quick. A black pip at best.  Moris are almost always used exclusively when a daily is in play or the killer is really, really tilted.
---
Keys are either for BMing (end of match, one gen left) or a last ditch effort to escape.  The former feels like ass when it happens and the latter means the killer won.  It'd be great if the former didn't happen anymore.  The latter is fine.
---
hatch grabs have been removed, but the killer can close hatch instead
---
Survivors can lobby dodge if they like. And this may come to a surprise to you but killers cannot see a survivors perks in the pregame lobby either.
---
You called me a dunce? Really? Alright I'm not to be insulted by you. You can have a good day.
---
Fuck hiding, lockers are gonna be infected too
---
&gt;So rank 20 surv can be sent against rank 1 survs? Nice, gj :)
---
Well, it is either this or not play at all. 
---
Half the community complains about queue time while the other half complains about unfair matchmaking. 
---
If devs make things stricter, it leads to longer queue times and people complain.  
---
If devs make things wider, there are people like you who also complain.
---
Incorrect. A staff member i talked to told me at one point it was like that, but got changed to make it easier for survivors to escape the pig if last one alive.
---
Yea they have it as an ability for a certain few killers like Billy's saw or ghost face's stare.
---
I think hes OP yea
---
Sure! Survivors always ask to buff the killers! We totally believe you! That's a really sad and desperate action, you and your friend changed name just to do this screenshot! pathetic!
---
Learn to use him!
---
Ok, good to know, though I really dont see any reason to run those addons. I prefer duration addons. I assume you use Thana for game slowdown with Legion pin? 
---
Broken status for Legion probably does more harm than benefit, ppl will focus on gens if they cant heal themselves. And if they will heal even once it will do more stall than 4 stacks Thana in the same amount of time.
---
It's so calming &lt;3
---
You too rank 21 ;)
---
Yes. The chapters are always worth buying, in my opinion, even if some of the survivor and killer perks are meh.
---
Ok
---
At 3-4AM GMT I find myself (Rank 3 Survivor) going against rank 12-15 Killers after a very long wait.
---
However in the evenings the games are quicker and the killers are my rank.
---
It depends on your region and who is available to start a game on the dedicated server.
---
Ah yes getting chased right off hook and having to rely on a perk to even play the game is very fun and fair.
---
I mean if one of the first games they ever play will be against red ranks, it will pretty surely not help them out :)
---
Both of them are badass!!!, The Oni's is so fun to play as and his perks are great, Especially Nemisis, I bought him and I've been having a blast with him, You get to run smash through pallets AND survivors...His katana makes a great noise, I love his design and everything about him, If you wanted to play as the pure embodiment of rage then get him
---
Depends on your rank. Low to mid rank killers are mostly &lt;2 minutes from what I'm hearing. Obviously this is dependent on region and when you're playing, but the trend is mostly the same across platforms.
---
I feel this in my soul LOL
---
We don't have those but he does eat all of the flies :)
---
To be fair the killers absolutely fucking himself chasing a BT person, get DS too and make him lose the game.
---
He's not a monster, just an asshole.
---
u clearly haven't seen what DS can do with 60 second immunity
---
Get lost man.
---
After the Oni update it went to the dutch language. Don't know how to change it myself
---
You clearly havent heard of slugging
---
&gt;I mean if one of the first games they ever play will be against red ranks, it will pretty surely not help them out :)
---
Not playing at all also prevents them from improving. We've all been there. 
---
When I started playing these rules didn't exist so a rank 20 survivor could open a SWF lobby, bring 3 friends rank 1 and they would go against me, a killer playing his first 10 matches. I brute forced through it. 
---
Nowadays matchmaking is miles better than before.
---
I actually 100% approve of Plague's using NOED, since Survivors like to cleanse as soon as the gens are done.
---
Have fun trying to survive Corrupt Purge and NOED, fuckers.
---
On objective stuff  and lockers you can be grabbed while healthy, On pallets and windows you HAVE to be injure to be grabbed
---
Not the dunce here...
---
The Survivor perks are nothing to write home about but she has awesome skins.
---
Oni has a couple of OK niche perks and is decent on PC. I wouldn't buy the Oni DLC if you don't like Yui and you play on Console.
---
lmao I laugh bc not a single game have I been able to get out bc my fucking team is too busy with safe unhooks nobody does gens and they suck at looping so it is a GG anyways
---
You can be grabbed from a gen/totem when healthy, during a vault you can only be grabbed whilst injured.
---
What's wrong with you man? I said go away!
---
One time had a game where ruin stuck around the whole match. But the ghostface was shit and even with ruin we got all the gens done. Match would‚Äôve ended way faster if he didn‚Äôt have ruin
---
...so it was changed during an indev build. And therefore never actually in the game proper. Making your point totally invalid
---
Unless they were swearing or threatening them, nobody is going to care and they won‚Äôt ban them. On consoles, anyways.
---
That‚Äôs what he gets for letting you crawl a little bit just to pick you up. I hate killers like that, either pick me up and hook me or let me go. Don‚Äôt stare at me crawling, I have more bps to get üôÑ
---
60 of a survivor not being dead is 60 seconds of time I can't go very far bc if that person gets picked up again then I just might be fucked no I am very fucked
---
I should elaborate a bit. For killer it was instant, then 3 min then 15 min playing 3 games in a row. Trying survivor was waiting for my switch to go to sleep and I was done :P 
---
Both ranks on the Switch are low since I primarily play on PC around 13 for both and I know that all platforms seem to have issues with queues around this rank but it doesn't mean we would be hurt by pooling them together.
---
but unlike DS you need to have skill to use their abilities, for DS all it takes is the easiest skill check ever and bam you just screwed over the killer out of his main goal.
---
Survivors must be injured to be grabbed at vaults. For hooks, lockers, and gens, it doesn‚Äôt matter what state they‚Äôre in.
---
Actually that bad yeah? What rank are you man
---
Finally a quality post that isn‚Äôt some overused meme about skill checks appearing when you touch your nose or some shit
---
Dont put words in my mouth, asshole. I know what i said, i know what ive seen. Dont get fucking sassy with me boy-o.
---
Either way just get Bill to 40 and the problem's solved
---
Thank you! First time I've ever gotten a firecracker to work :)
---
You did get them for free BP are free and you keep the perks if you unlock them not have them since bill just cane to console and I‚Äôm sorry that you don‚Äôt want to play the game and have every thing given to you
---
Cool! I‚Äôm Dutch myself and I was a little confused.
---
I might try to change it but it didn‚Äôt do that for me.
---
Are you on console or pc?
---
What are you referring to? I admit I don‚Äôt play very much Nurse however I am being honest, the game only manipulates your aim when it has already decided that you are in position, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúassisting‚Äù it‚Äôs verifying if the hit was successful or not. And if there is something between you and the survivor during the ‚Äúverification‚Äù then you‚Äôll end up hitting a wall you weren‚Äôt looking at yourself. I also admit that this seems a lot like aim assist but it‚Äôs not quite the same.
---
Best feeling in the game
---
He's a smart boy, made that mistake once and is very careful now.
---
You forgot the /s
---
Almost got a heart attack
---
Yes, they removed these perks, which I purchased from the bloodweb.
---
This was simply true.
---
Then go after someone else. No one likes being tunneled off hook and even then every body just slugs ppl. If you slug, most of the time ppl try to come and save them and even then survivors have to run a perk and sometimes 2 (unbreakable) to counter not being able to play the game.
---
I love the survivors faces in this tbh
---
I played a match yesterday where I double hooked everybody, but only actually got a single kill and that wasn‚Äôt until after the exit gates were open. I didn‚Äôt tunnel or camp, but I had NoEd equipped for the rift challenge. The survivors got all of the totems during the game so NoEd never activated. I get a party invite and they were all SWF taunting me about the match. The one who died was seriously pissed off and screaming about how trash I am. I just confirmed that they beat me, I lost, and gg. They kicked me from the party. smh
---
I dig the art style.

https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/77137/why-do-i-have-to-unlock-bills-perks

Peantis's first response (not too far down from the beginning)
---
They're taking it out of context to use.
---
You prestiged. I don't understand where the confusion is.
---
It's possible our "toxicity ratio" is different due to us being in different regions but nonetheless I'm aware of the many "good" players there are too.
---
This is not true.
---
This is 10/10 content
---
Maybe we wouldn't need DS if killers didnt decide to instantly tunnel ppl off hook. It wouldn't be fair if ppl could just instantly tunnel and get someone killed with them not having any counterplay
---
not the biggest fan of tattoos in general but this is the cleanest one I‚Äôve seen on the sub üëç
---
So um, have fun?
---
BP is free. The game isn't free neither.
---
You fool. You believed Claudette was not a corn cob to begin with, that's why you're losing her. She isn't in the corn, she IS the corn.
---
Hello there
---
I would ignore it but as a troll I tend to try and feed off the salt. I don't disagree that killers can be salty, or that survivors can be salty to each other, but the former is almost rare in my experience and the latter just adds to my op. 
---
It's my observation that survivors feel they need to survive, all of them for it to count as a win. When if you look at most horror movies that's not the case. Most survivors don't make it, and the most emotional charged scenes are the ones where a survivor self sacrifices so others can get away. I personally think a game is good if at least 1-2 survivors die and the other live. And again, I only get salty at a killer for camping first hook, and I just call them a cub scout.
---
Either way, I think it's the survivors fault that wait times are so long. Not enough people playing killer from the harassments, harder to level up in general for the killer, I mean as a survivor you just need to cleanse a totem or 2, do a work on a gen or 2, unhook someone and heal someone and your pretty much guaranteed a pip. I'm a terrible looper and I'm rank 3. In fact out of my swf group only 1 I would say is decent at looping and he even thinks he is not. He is also the other red rank. You even see the difficulty when it comes to adepted characters, merciless killer is extremely difficult relative to simply surviving a match.
---
but the counterplay is having a good team take the but for them and body blocking and anyway DS doesnt have to be used when being tunneled, it can be used anytime after being unhooked during the period of 60 seconds which means they can literally waste your time even if youre not tunneling them
---
Where‚Äôs the fun in that
---
this joke is really old
---
Their lack of understanding how prestiging works and Bill being added to console changing his perks from regular to teachable.
---
Oh and taking a response from Peantis out of context to use.
---
It looks like meg just bust a nut on while every drug imaginable
---
Thanks, i guess. :D
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Sir, this is a Wendy‚Äôs
---
And the killer still has to hook the survivor, and the hook gets used up and potentially causes a dead corner for the killer.
---
Like, I don't get how self-centered some of these survivors have to be to not realize that killing yourself on hook *is actually better* then just DCing. I'm not saying it's great, but it's progress.
---
Yeah ikr, I was Gen rushing while other two tried unhooking, and it was just back and forth, survivor coming close to it and Bubba chainsawing, but Noone really did anything. Top tier shit show.
---

Ah, I see you're a woman of culture as well.

That's fair, the game is pretty saturated, most tv's now are also over saturated, then phones like to also over saturate and we end up with this lul
---
Low rank queue is a nightmare right now, but you'll pull through
---
He doesn't usually go for cords. He likes to sit on my hand.
---
And they're survivors and survivors have to try and survive my bad you got looped for 3 gens and just finally hooked a survivor and now you decide they're your only target. A survivor should be able to counter a tunneling killer and DS is a perfect reason as to why they need it. Also if you really wanted to give up the match and focus one dude tunnel them and count a minute then you'll have your sweet kill
---
Just discipline your cat, and it won't do it anymore, not too hard. You know, proper training.
---
Yeah but the games themselves dont last very long.Oh and user reveal thing is negligible.Look at iron maiden-nobody uses that
---
slugging is the worst pressure 4 min until death is not better than 2 min max
---
Aw thankyou. Fake nails stop me chewing them but then the cats want to chew them lol
---
damn. yeah thats kinda of a sad truth in dbd, people are always quick to judge you and blame you regardless of which side you play.
---
You guys are just mean!
---
Oh...
---
Survivors will have to waste time not doing gens to heal them buddy.
---
Then the poor sap who's internet cuts out for the first time in a year gets a hour long ban? Seems unfair to me, it is a balancing act between punishing the douchebag DC's and the legit accidental DC's
---
The white on them makes me look a tiny bit less white :P
---
that would be so amazing &lt;3
---
Legion's pose seems a bit suggestive.
---
Aww, he loves you ‚ô°
---
I jump whenever I get DS'd and that pisses me off more than them getting awayüòÇ
---
Honestly at least for me on console, it‚Äôs a little hard for me to tell whose been doing what. Now if the last person alive was doing gens, out looping me or just being a better player than me, I give hatch or guide them to the exit gates.
---
However, if you‚Äôre giving away your teammates position, sabotaging the game or intentionally sandbagging, you‚Äôre first to go.
---
the killer/survivor are added into the update they arent a separate update. otherwise you wouldnt have the assets to play against oni or in a team with yui. im sure you are downloading the hotfix especially considering the update came out last week
---
Well I mean trapper,clown,bubba and pig are fine without supernatural powers so frank is just a ducking loser!
---
He has one!
---
\&gt; Resorts to personal attacks instead of addressing my point
---
Jesus christ, what the hell...
---
I‚Äôm half-convinced it makes you more likely to spawn alone and next to a gen right next to ruin. So many deliverance games where I got found and tunneled straightaway, then realize the ruin totem was 5 feet away from my original spawn/first gen.
---
They have supernatural strength given to them by the Entity that‚Äôs why pig is able to easily lift survivors over her shoulder and can get her ass kicked by Bill or David
---
Yikes. People really take DbD too seriously lmao

I just updated the post with another example, not even an hour later. This community, man.
---
I've had this happen a few times with people I have every perk for. I had to back out and go back in for them to show up.
---
No shit dumbass you don‚Äôt have to buy anything besides 15$ I think for the base game are you really that much of a broke cunt that you can‚Äôt afford a 15$ game and was even free at one point for PS4 so stfu
---
I don't know, maybe it's your internet connection? The longest update of dbd only took like 10 minutes for me, i'm on ps4, if that makes any difference
---
OOO and alert. I just like to have Good info on what the killer is up to. You will also know where to be and not be. This is also why I started to use windows of opportunity a lot more. I am a solo survivor so I dont have any friends on comms that can tell me "KS pallet gone" "killer on me do gens" "going for unhook pressure gens or distract the killer"
---
He was probably trying to wait out DS but he should have waited till the last absolute second before picking her up.
---
he looks...broken :( the tea bags finally did this to him
---
heal them for oh about 2 seconds if they know how to recover and then again Unbreakable is a perk which just counters this even more.
---
lets say this 60 seconds is a lot of time ofc u can counter it by slugging which is another time waster if u need someone dead right now but how does that stop tunneling? unless you think after 60 seconds if you didn't get away that is on u personally I like OhTofus idea when DS first got this change where he mentioned DS is flawed bc it doesnt truly stop tunneling and ofc it just makes survivors immune now I say like bc I dont fully agree on his idea which is "when you get unhooked DS stays active for about 15 seconds if you get downed during those 15 seconds the perk just stays active until you are picked up" that would stop tunneling and be less time to be fully immune just to be a blockade for the killer to deal with. I guess that would be like BT in a way which is also a good anti tunneling perk bc no killer is realistically gonna sit behind you for 15 seconds without u getting to a pallet.
---
And being annoying apparently.
---
I wouldn't say no to either one.
---
accurate after the glowing brains at bhvr went live with the changes
---
I am all for the idea of a casual 2 v8 mode. Would be hell and unbalanced but you are not gonna be playing that for the seriousness; that is a shit and giggles fest.
---
I honestly just think I need a new PS4. Mine glitches out so much. Like it ejects disks, over heats when my room gets mildly warm, and everything takes so long to download despite having only 4 games downloaded atm
---
Actually, he may have been waiting out DS and miscounted. If he let him crawl more, the DS timer may have run out. 
---
He has more of a reason To wait MORE.
---
tbh i think more people would play pig if she had this as her chase music
---
*‚ÄôIk‚Äô* fuck sake üòÇ

This is DBD. You get used to seeing old patched bugs return after updates, repeatedly. Has always been this way.

Wow I did not expect this to have so many upvotes when I woke up. Thank you so much everyone for the encouraging comments.

Me when teaching killer: You're not going to win every game, so when you lose, just shrug it off and start another one.

Me when I lose: OMG THESE FREAKING INFINITE LOOPS... BORROWED TIME... HITBOXES...!!!

Also the hook is broken afterwards.

&gt;**Shaming other players**
---
&gt;/r/deadbydaylight¬†is not a platform to shame other players. Do not shame people for their choice of perks, playstyles or the platform they plan on. Censor all usernames for posts featuring other players in a negative light. Calls to action against another player will not be tolerated.
---
There is nothing more relatable then this
---
I am 99% sure she got asperger
---
That fokin Meg looking like Levi in his killer mode ( if he smiled that is).
---
Nothing happens because it doesn‚Äôt work. It benefits the DCer right now because you don‚Äôt lose rank anymore when DC. BHVR doesn‚Äôt know how to code, if a program doesn‚Äôt generate code for them then the code they write doesn‚Äôt work. DC penalties have never ever worked right due to this.
---
Teaching: you don‚Äôt have to 4K to win, focus on building your emblems and scoring BP.
---
Playing: if I get another SWF I‚Äôm going iridescent huntress with a mori
---
If Miller and Cunningham come to a deal which is very unlikely
---
I know, it‚Äôs great because then I know where two survivors are. The one that was already at the totem and the one I led to the totem.  Generally neither survivor is smart enough to just let it be and I get to get both on hooks.  
---
And what do you think the other two survivors are doing while I run interference on the totem?  Doing gens? Hah.
---
Like how freaky would it be to go over to help someone repair a generator only to see Norman freaking Bates come at you with a knife
---
DBD logic: Sprinting for three seconds causes you to be dead tired for a full minute.
---
If they do this, I say make it a freddy v jason style thing where the killers compete to kill the most surviors, sabotaging hooks that killers are bringing their victims too, smacking another killer to stun them, pulling off hooked surviors from one hook to put them on another. It could be hilarous and be stupid fun for both sides when you have 8 flashlights in your face.
---
I vary rarely play Legion, but I love them.
---
I cannot explain why.
---
One of the things you could do, especially with Jack Torrance, is just make them a better M1 Killer than anyone else. 120% movespeed, 10% breaking and vaulting speed bonus, and then give him something else as a bonus on top of that.
---
In Jack's case, Whenever a gen is completed your next attack automatically downs the survivor you hit in the next 30 seconds or so. Then you can have perks like "Here's Johnny!" that cause Survivors in a 18m radius to scream whenever you perform a Break Action (Pallet or Generator).
---
Punishing tunneling is fine, but other things?
---
It's *not tunneling* if you run into the killer and get downed.
---
It's *not tunneling* if you get unhooked before the killer leaves.
---
It's *not tunneling* if you give any kind of noise notification (or if the person healing you gives a noise notification).
---
It's *not tunneling* if you get healed up successfully.
---
And it's *not tunneling* if you are attempting to complete your objective before healing and get caught doing so.
---
It really isn't fair that Decisive Strike is 60 seconds of absolute immunity that prevents the killer from picking up/hooking the survivor regardless of the situation, no matter how the survivor played, you should not be able to crawl out the exit because they can't pick you up, and you should not be able to DS the killer because some other survivor hook farmed you.
---
I hope this question fits the criteria:
---
For the last two days I've been playing killer and the only maps I get are Yamaoka and Coldwind Farms. Is this happening to anyone else? I can't remember the last time I saw Autohaven, Crotus, or Macmillan.
---
Hmm. That actually sounds interesting
---
Indeed. The final clip  should have been all 4 kates booping her snoot :P
---
Yeah but the Entity still gives it to him anyways how do you thinks he hasn‚Äôt been hurt or attacked by a group of the stronger survivors because he has supernatural durability
---
There should honestly be a penalty for disconnecting a bunch of times
---
I could see that. Might need some weaknesses to ensure they ain't too strong.
---
*crys in RIP aleksei*
---
New Killer. Catto
---
Play dumb shit like chest protector bubba or ruin protector trapper (place all your traps around ruin and defend it with your life)
---
bruh the shear amount of times on every map where the grass or corn or whatever is too high to see anything but the chase music starts and i do like 3 360s trying to fogure out where i coulda seen him from
---
Next time, okay? ‚ù§
---
Them working together means less points but more kills; competing with each other could earn more points perhaps. Encourage competition but not discourage full corporation
---
Me when teaching killer: Don't respect pallets, break them early so that survivors can't use them later.
---
Me playing: IF I GET HIT BY ANOTHER PALLET IM RUNNING SPIRIT FURY AND ENDURING!!
---
*confused in bill main*
---
Yeah. There should be a category for cooperation
---
Kind of sounds like an old Freddie. Also for panic and decoy. If there is one gen left and you hook someone far away from the last gens would it just effectively block the rest of gens? Also how would decoy work exactly I understand the concept but wouldn't that mean every totem is protected once that means their are a maximum of 10 totems that can be broken in the game? 
---
Cool concept idk how he would play out tho
---
I think the entity would instantly kill survivors if they try to attack and fight the killer!
---
The survivor perks are awesome
---
1. One that prevents blood once... Not that good
---
2. Lift up pallets... Yeah
---
3. Wiggle speed for 20% and a lot of haste... An SWF group saving a flip flop user will have fun.
---
Sadly,lots of people that use this survivor a probably toxic, but we're here for perks. And these are some very fun ones.
---
Oni... Is an easy A tier, if not S. If I hear he is the best in the game I won't be surprised. His power is charged by chasing and hitting people, grants huge map pressure, and a very strong one hit attack.
---
His perks aren't bad either
---
1. A perk that gives people Hemmorage effect to injured, give this to Watershoe Hag or Clown and see what happens
---
2. Nemisis, Oblivious to the obsession for 60 seconds when stunned... Situational, give this to Bubba and it's a free downing
---
3. Some other perk, I don't remember what it does... So it's probably bad.
---
I wouldn't buy it yet...
---
I'm just a guy that waits for a good sale. If you don't care about 6 bucks than buy it!
---
The devs said no in an AMA, even though I think it would‚Äôve been nice if they left it up to the player to give more depth to her character.
---
happwns whyyy to often
---
But even if he knew they had DS, there‚Äôs no way he knew they had rank 1. If they had rank 3 they would have made it out while still being safe.
---
Get them broken and then get a hook, blood echo makes everyone exhausted (if they're injured) and if I get someone who isn't the obsession it slows the game down (dying light).
---
More so: you cannot chose to be a killer or survivor. It is a vote.
---
Or at least the music that plays as the bear trap timer goes down
---
For me I can find a killer game in 10 seconds, sometimes survivor takes literally 20 minutes. Maybe because I‚Äôm on PS4?
---
He had DS tier 1. OP maybe had 4 seconds left before it expired (which you can see by the red timer on the DS perk icon in bottom right). So yes, there was enough time left for Freddy to wait out his DS, but definitely not enough had it been tier 3, maybe tier even 2 too.
---
This guy loves yellow gens
---
you could try just prestiging your character, but that takes a while, and if you‚Äôre maxed, good luck
---
My favorite is the sweat on his hoodie and mask
---
Dude you can actually see the killers name in pregame lobby. You have to go to recent players on steam and 4 most recent are your teammates and the one whos not a teammate is obviously the killer. Hope this helps.
---
I think the fastest way is DC but it‚Äôll get you banned and I think the best way is to play dumb , just chase survivor then his let the escape , don‚Äôt put ruin on and get wraith with no perk and addon and play normally
---
I only know the middle two tbh
---
IKR I realized that after drawing her :'D Great catch!
---
But again, there's just no reason to pick them up earlier, even if DS had still been active at that point, at least he would have done everything he could to give himself the best chances - and in this case it would have worked out.
---
He the one that said the iconic "you're the entire circus" line right?
---
You don't need to play both role to know that survivors would never ask to get back the old legion! Exactly like the killers never ask to buff survivors! It's pure logic!
---
You need therapy my man.
---
One time the killer was chasing me around the big house, in the Red Forest map, I was injured and he went to swing at me again, that's when my husband dropped down in front of him from the second story, taking the hit for me and scaring the piss out of the killer I'm sure. After the hit he stood there confused and unsure of who to chase lmao, we both got away.
---
"people who disagree only use it in worst way possible"
---
I fucking love when they do this and are like enjoy being banned idiot. I can PROMISE you, that will not happen lol
---
I wasn't even aware of a give away. I'll sign up right now.
---
It seems a lot harder for console players
---
I LOVE YOUR KEYBOARD AND MOUSE SET
---
Brass knuckle. Let me punch David's face in while the Claudette watches!
---
the one about why survivors use object of obsession
---
I don‚Äôt think the Entity would care if they fought back. It‚Äôs clear the survivors have ways to hurt the killer that the Entity allows. Pallets obviously hurt the killers and decisive strike is literally describing as stabbing the killer.
---
I think thematically the survivors just never really try to fight bc they are almost trained to feel weak. That‚Äôs probably why nobody ever thinks to grab the hatchets out of the lockers. I don‚Äôt think they necessitate superhuman strength to use, since they don‚Äôt appear to be any different from a normal hand hatchet. 
---
Plus none of the survivors seem to be trained in any kind of actual hand to hand combat. Only one I can imagine is David, and thematically he‚Äôs just a big softie under that rough exterior.
---
Fortunately I'm not, but ugh. That's still gonna take a while.
---
I would be ok with this being her lobby screen music, at the very least, kinda like MM.
---
‚ÄòIk‚Äô üò≠üòÇ
---
I'm more about banning DC's and if some random people got banned by it and it wasn't their fault. Well, I will remember them, but DC's douchebags come first to slain.
---
You haven‚Äôt faced a good nurse. You could also put spirit there
---
I was thinking brass knuckles as a possible alternative to bare fists since it would be hard for that to be realistic unless the killer was like Oni sized.
---
Everything you need to know is mentioned in the youtube video description ‚ù§ Good Luck ‚ù§
---
No it‚Äôs a perk from feng
---
THANKS

Its just sad why dead by daylight and gaming as a hole has become, im 18, 10 years ago, nobody thought games were cool, now gaming more and more filled with just hype beast cringe comps, and female gamer girls, and kings if the lgbt, just sad how video games have took of the worst hehe xd, cant even talk shit in games anymore. Nothing personal against u, just seeing that pink stuff just kinda set of my hate for video games now :/ ik im sexist, but I just cannot fathom non cringe infestational females playing games, im sure ur a nice girl/guy/it
---
You raise some good points but I don't 100% agree with you.
---
The point about 5:1 on all platforms still equals 5:1 on cross platform is 100% factual but I do not agree that its 5:1 on all platforms. I know people rank 14-18 on PC that have 2-3 min survivor queues while rank 13 on Switch gives me 10-15, this proves that ratios are not all the same. There are also a lot more variables to consider as well, statically speaking the Switch brings in a younger audience so 11 AM on a Monday the queues will be worse on Switch than PC because of School. I can't speak for PS4 or Xbone users age range since I would assume that it is more evenly spread.
---
What I think is a good point to make though, is that you are right on cross platform doesn't fix the issue entirely. I believe it is a big help but there is more that needs to be done and without the information only available to BVHR it is impossible to be certain what is the biggest thing that will help. Personally the cross platform and more incentive for playing killer is where I would start without looking at the data.
---
was there something wrong with my apology?
---
He was such a good boy rip
---
If you are looking to kill DBD, then yes do it. But 100% that is how you kill a game.
---
Well for one I play on console (which explains the Nurse's absence). Even if Nurse were better, she's still so rare that not enough regular data can be gathered. And Spirit is close to them, same with Ghostface. Its just these three are played more regularly and have crazy ass kill rates.
---
You want to get murdered by the Original Drag Queen? 
---
Hell Ye
---
Get your pewbs out of my life.
---
Sounds really good to me. The only thing I would change is either remove the gen pause altogether or shorten it by half, simply because gens already seem to go fast as is. Otherwise, it seems pretty balanced to me and thematic to Ash.
---
https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/ has community moderated tier lists for both sides. I don't agree with everything on it, but it's a good measure of community opinion on things.
---
Quentin is Satan!!!!
---
My guy, you need therapy. I'm not too sure when this subreddit became a diary for people, but everyday people come on here and display tendencies that makes me think 'they should seriously be in therapy'. 
---
Posting on reddit trying to get validation from strangers because of your low self-esteem isn't going to do anyone any favours. If you're suicidal, call the suicide hotline. We can't do anything for you. We can't give you therapy. We don't know what to do about this. But they do. Call them
---
Idk, i had this problem, maybe just take it and suck it up, don't mean it to sound mean but sometimes you just can't do anything about it, maybe bhvr will change it in the future if this will be a big thing and more people want it
---
I have only see four freddys ever
---
Ah, your 18 that explains it all. It's okay you'll grow up someday.

Jeff will always have the best Christmas sweater (also, why doesn't BHVR sell his sweater on their store?)

Platform and rank?
---
oh that‚Äôs funny, im sorry that happened to youüòÇ i was that way with sprint burst because most games i played had a built in sprint mechanic so i asked my friend how he was running so fast, like what button it was, and was so disappointed it was a perk and not a feature.
---
It's fine, I just don't want you to hurt yourself. Call the national suicide prevention hotline. They're there to help you. 1-800-273-8255 they're always there when you feel like you need to call.
---
Thanks! And I made an adjustment to the timer.
---
I'm literally autistic myself.
---
A large part of it is people getting used to him, but the biggest indirect nerf to Clown was the change to vaults. In short, Clown's bottles can slow a window vault, but have absolutely no impact on pallet vaults.
---
You can perk into handling pallets, but that just means you're running a killer with no real power to speak of. That's why he goes to the bottom of the bottom.
---
made with mematic
---
I am possibly the only bubba to not camp
---
you're not understanding me though.  I am aware that reddit is not the right place; that is why I am apologizing.  This post has nothing to do with my mental health.  It is me saying "I fucked up by seeking help here, I am sorry."  And I'm sorry to hear that you're facing that man, life is rough and I'll pray for you.
---
I'm absolute rubbish on Badham as both killer and survivor. As a killer something about the gen layouts hurts my soul. As a survivor I like generic jungle gyms like on Autohaven or Macmillan and feel most comfortable looping them.
---
he's about to hand him an updated autopsy report
---
1. If they see you struggling they are just going to pick a random hook to kill you on so you get no points.
---
2. If you don't struggle they may actually give you hatch or gates.
---
3. I don't even think you can get points by struggling.
---
edit: wiggling I don't think you get points for wiggling.
---
ohhh LOL, idk, i just know is annoying as hell haha
---
Premade teams already abuse OoO, this sounds like a nightmare to add on top of that.
---
Will do brother.  Thanks a ton for your help.  If you ever need help I can try my best to help or guide you in the right direction.  Take care :)
---
Relax, not everybody is the same. Stop stressing yourself out and just forget about what everyone else's doing and do your own thing in peace.
---
I'm waiting for a third stun. survivors dont realize being blinded is not a stun. I've downed people while blinded. And one time, I came out of a blind to find that I had window grabbed the person who was blinding me at the God pallet.
---
Ah. Yeah, a lot of people do it particularly online, and they really do think we're pieces of shit. Thank you for being understanding, a lot of people would just be like "QUIT CRYING LOLLLL"
---
look carefully, some of them are well hidden :D

We're gonna live forever from David King and BBQ &amp; Chilli from Leatherface are great perks on have on every character because they can potentially double your bloodpoint gain from every game you play. 
---
Self care from Claudette is a good perk to have, and you'll want an exhaustion perk as well. David King has dead hard, so you'll get two good perks to have from him. Nea has balanced landing, Meg has sprint burst etc. Just get at least one. Anither good survivor to level is Bill. Borrowed Time.and Unbreakable are both great survivor perks.
---
For killer, trapper has easy perks to use that are very good, and the Clown has bamboozle, which will help in chases, as well as pop goes the weasel, which can instantly regress generators a large distance after hooking a survivor. The Hag comes with powered Hex perks if you want to check them out.
---
Ash will be getting one! Take a look at this: https://www.google.com/amp/s/aminoapps.com/c/deadbydaylightd/amp/blog/chapter-14-cosmetics-not-dlc-included/3WEm_nQ8HBugX7kn7G755BYVQLRbBmbeYQ

I think there should be a gun item that can only kill if you are the last survivor and on third hook and you can hit him in the head after you are downed but before he picks you up or something like that. Then have some add ons that let you kill with more survivor, less hooks, or a body shot instead of just head. Not going to save you as much as the key, but still a fun and flavorful way to survive.
---
scummy and effective in DBD conflict a lot
---
Honestly as a survivor main besides alerts Memorial Institute I get so bored getting MacMillian and Autohaven. I wish Hawkins, Ormond and Mother‚Äôs Dwelling was more common.
---
Downing a person in one speed limiter chainsaw as bubba ***0***
---
Whats going on with these offerings?
---
&gt; Plus even when you get lucky and dodge him, his cool down is so small he can just smash you before you can make it through a window. 
---
This is utterly, blatantly untrue and the fact this is upvoted is a massive indictment of this subreddit
---
&gt; but injuring only one person is enough to give him his power
---
And this makes it clear you haven't played him. it is not enough *at all*. getting your initial power charged from only injuring one person takes an excruciatingly long time because they nerfed how quickly he acquires his power across the board.
---
&gt; One of my preferred mechanics is "escaping" a chase and making the killer wonder where I went and waste time this way, but getting away from Oni is just straight up impossible once injured, at most you can hope he'll go for someone else.
---
oh boo fucking hoo. one killer can in some way counter your precious little playstyle. cry me a river
---
&gt; (and before killer mains complain, I'm rank 5 killer currently, I split my time 2/3 surv 1/3 killer, I know having a strong killer for once is nice, but getting hit at a 360 angle is so Fricking frustrating and I'm v tired of it)
---
okay neat. i'm a rank 4 survivor and think Oni is fine.
---
also if they change literally anything about him on console he'll go from kind of okay to utter trash. so fuck off
---
Idk why but when you said Alert, I imagined the icon for premonition and somehow mixed the two up.
---
This was so adorable and good! It made my day! Thanks!

Looking up really fast sometimes baits them because they will react as soon as they see you move.
---
Oh ok (that was as not me btw)
---
You too!
---
I think your vision for up the ante is too OP

and? is that supposed to make it okay? i am as well and i didn't appreciate the "joke" whatsoever.

Give the good boy what he wants!

Ye
---
Azarov's and a lot of the Autohaven maps for being bland. They're just not as nice to look at compared to the colors and atmosphere of L√©ry's, Haddonfield and Hawkins
---
Sometimes I just burn Ormond just so I can not suffer the corn for the fifth game in a row.
---
Except against a insta-down killer where it can't be triggered until after the first down and before you heal.
---
Wake up seems pretty good, but idk about second wind. I feel like I would just get tunneled and the perk wouldn‚Äôt help.
---
Wait she did Why?
---
Unless it‚Äôs Red Puke, no.
---
They already nerfed how much orbs spawn. and how much of the bar it fills. and they added a cap that 99s it requiring you to find a random orb often
---
&gt; When I play oni it feels like I have my power almost all the time. 
---
most killers have their power all the time how the goddamn fucking shit is this a problem? never mind that it isn't even true. oni not having his power at any point is debilitating to the character
---
Hey man, all I saw was you saying that in the past you've posted about your suicidal thoughts, as someone who's been suicidal before and self-harmed in the past, I take that topic very seriously. You really don't have to publicly apologize to anyone, people make mistakes, it's all a part of being human. And I'm telling you now if you don't get help you'll just continue to feel worse about yourself. Just please don't kill or hurt yourself.
---
I think he should stick to single player games
---
It's very hard to escape a good Bubba, largely because they'll be running the instasaw add-on combo which means there's no outrunning him when he charges it - it just charges too fast. The situation gets even worse for the survivor if Bubba is running Play with Your Food, as each stack gives him 5% faster movement.
---
If you're facing an instasaw Play with Your Food Bubba then what happens is that he gets three stacks, books it around the map to instadown someone, maybe gets his stack back or just continues on to instadown a second survivor, then either gets his stacks back or instadowns the third survivor. Anything after that is mopping up.
---
Bubba has no Ultra Rare add-ons, so any time he *should* see one in the Bloodweb, he gets an Ebony Mori instead. This will *also* make life hard for survivors.
---
The comments about Bubba being terrible are largely about "base" Bubba. Against a base Bubba you just want to bait the saw and run off, or bait the saw and get him to run into something *then* you can run off.
---
Welp, there it is.
---
it's not. drop the pallet early and nemesis is deleted, Leaving only PWYF. there's a reason that basically no one was running PWYF before Nemesis. 
---
Frankly, I'm ecstatic that Bubba is now good, and I'm gonna be using him as much as possible before the survivors realize all they have to do is drop the pallet earlier than they did before.

##The Curator (Jack Torrance)
---
###Primary Weapon: Fire Axe
---
###Power: Redrum
---
The Curator has a **power gauge** that fills up over time. To activate the power: Redrum, **tap the Power button** once the gauge is full. While the power is active:
---
- The Killer's power gauge drains over **20 seconds**.
---
- All Survivors suffer from the **Blindness** and **Oblivious** status effects.
---
- Survivors hit while Redrum is active are afflicted with the **Hindered** status effect.
---
Once the power gauge is fully depleted, it must recharge over **30 seconds**.
---
###Perks
---
**Cabin Fever**
---
Months in isolation have taken a toll on you. You have become obsessed with one Survivor. If your obsession escapes a hook **2** times, or obtains the accumulative repair points equal to **3/2.5/2** completed generators, you may kill them by your own hand. Cabin Fever can only be used once per trial.
---
**Spark of Insanity**
---
Unlocks the potential in one's **Aura-reading ability**.
---
Your mind has been consumed by delusions and paranoia. The auras of generators occupied by Survivors turn yellow every **20 seconds**, but your terror radius is increased by **12/10/8 meters**.
---
**All Work and No Play**
---
Your presence fills those around you with anxiety. Unhooking Survivors takes **50/75/100%** longer.
---
Can we presume that offerings aren't a factor here?
---
No I haven‚Äôt I might try it though I don‚Äôt know yet
---
A tip is to always understand that he can one shot you in the open, so you need to always know where a nearby window/pallet to run to is. It's better to take a m1 hit than to risk getting one shotted.

The new map jesus christ it's not because of balancing it's because is so annoying when you're chasing someone or they are hiding

They just need to add debris...
---
It‚Äôs their play style , You can‚Äôt just start going on and complaining on people‚Äôs play style . Geez people need to learn that tunnelling is allowed and is a legit tactic to do , if I do back the hook and see that you‚Äôre he weakest target I‚Äôll down you and either hook of no obsession or slug. May sound like a cunt to you but it is what it is no need to just complain about and just play. The argument sounds like why do survivors loop so good , why can‚Äôt they just stop and let me down them. It‚Äôs like saying don‚Äôt play the game.Many perks /items exist to counter tunnelling so be resourceful
---
again, you missed the point of the post.  My post is acknowledging that I shouldn't have posted my problems on this sub, and is simply an apology to those I have wronged.

Thank you for the links though.  Maybe I can post there in the future if I need support
---
He gets everything he wants! Except cords they are a big nono but I let him do it just once.
---
So I started stabbing
---
Just restart the game. Happens a lot with all characters on console. Just something else we‚Äôre all used to now.
---
Then leave it up the eye of the beholder. If you didn't appreciate the joke then so be it. The joke itself is common around my family so I use it commonly. You can't always make everyone happy
---
If you do the math the default running speed of survivors is already above average for a persons sprinting speed. So Sprint Burst is SUPER speed.
---
God I wish I were Julie
---
How?
---
I feel like you could do the same with Norman
---
Tru3 bad now give me upvote
---
[I raise you one](https://imgur.com/gallery/Nun8G4d)
---
I can see Norman working similar Micheal Meyers. Norman starts off with undetectable but can't attack survivors but can sabotage generators my large amounts or even destroy pallets to hinder the survivors and by stalking them he gets power for 'Mother' to take over in which the Pyscho theme starts playing and he becomes a normal killer for a limit till 'Mother' mode ends and he's back to being a stealthy saboteur.
---
how did u gain access to behaviour's original blueprint plans for all the killers? this thing must be worth a fortune
---
Oh awesome!!! I‚Äôm 100% here for matching gaming gear
---
Then I dead hard over and start tormenting the killers
---
What Golden_Spider mean is that you had the perks when they were not teachables but when bill came out on console they became his teachables and you prestiged before unlocking the teachables so now they shouldn‚Äôt be in your bloodweb.
---
Trappers voice replaced my mind voice now everywhere I go I hear the crapper song
---
Ah yea thats fair having an objective. Lol what rank are u anyway?
---
So you.want to learn nurse vs bottom tier survivors? What exactly will you be learning there that you cant learn from better opponents?
---
You can check on r/leaksbydaylight, they tend to post the highest res images of wallpapers at some point before the next update comes out
---
That would completely defeat the purpose of the ranks, especially when a new chapter comes out
---
Add Oni too since he can multi hit.
---
Why bother with no ed if you aren't killing anyone?
---
I thought this was an actual thing at first
---
*bill you fucking idiot are you really smoking in this moment?!?!?  they‚Äôll hear and smell it you fool*

I am with you my Brobba! I really dont see the appeal.

I love ds until that one time I miss the skillchecks when I need it the most.
---
Cats are cute little assholes :3
---
What a tunneling bastard. Fufu
---
YES, that happened to me almost every time I went to use it that I just switched to balanced landing
---
Haha pretty much.
---
We can! I always look at the offerings and I never see anyone doing level specific offerings.
---
&gt;I'd rather sit in a long queue (it's not I get killer games in less than 15 seconds) and have a fair game. Not 3 hooks and tbagged at exit gates by survivors that know the ins and outs of the game and know how to loop when I am trying mediocre killers (Oni, Wraith, Trapper, Clown)
---
You are not wrong for wanting that but the other half of the community wants faster queues. They also spam this sub with threads  like "why can't I find a game?" "bhvr fix pls". 
---
So devs make things wider and you guys (the other half), complain.
---
I like to aim towards the top of the neck rather then the head. It works for me. 
---
Also saves with a flashlight are hard in general as its a timing thing more than a positioning thing.
---
"My dad works at microsoft. Enjoy your ban, tunneller..."

Nice have fun wanting to die after you face consistent basement bubbas
---
Rank 6 killer and I got a match where one guy kinda seemed... new to say the least. The others were clearly in red ranks and very skilled. Got lucky and got them all downed. Let the new player get hatch and killed the rest. He was a level 18. In a match with all red rank team mates and a purple killer. I feel like he had no chance and it wasn‚Äôt fair he got stuck in our match. This needs to be adjusted somehow because I KNOW I wouldn‚Äôt have had any fun in that match or any like it.
---
Lmao it's a full on cigar, too.
---
that‚Äôs actually a really good system thanks for letting me know
---
U dont get it. Winning isint always making you better ever heard of ‚Äúlearn from your losses‚Äù and this shows ur a shit survivor so. And im not complaining im saying what dise and dose not give killers pips üòÇ again stop trying to make me seem like a bitch when ive tried to be civil and u start going on about how i suck because i cant leave my mates behind i bet youve never felt the accomplishment of getting ur mate out while end game collapse is ticking down and the killer is waiting for someone to try get him off the hook
---
If your team is optimal then the gates are open by then. Even if they aren't, your sacrifice still used up 5 minutes of the killers time so that the other survivors can do stuff.
---
It happened, cos you shouldn't got her
---
It may help slightly, and while I personally don't want cross-play, it wouldn't be a horrible thing to look into or test.
---
I think we're pretty much on the same page. I think incentive for killer or making the community better would do better for solving the issue, but that's not exclusive to other possible solutions.
---
I just also realize that crossplay can be an absolute bitch to implement. Between coding issues and compatibility along with getting the big 3 to sign off on it, there may be too much to get it off the ground.
---
Not to say BHVR shouldn't be looking into it, but if there's an easier, more comprehensive fix available, that might be the more effective path to take.
---
I wouldn't be against an incentive to play when queues need a certain role, like what World of Warcraft implemented. WoW's dungeon system tracks if a Tank or Healer is needed and gives an incentive for queuing in that role. A bonus to BP when killers are needed based on queue times would be a good incentive to get more people playing killer, and would probably be easier to implement than cross play.
---
Once a quick fix is applied, then looking into the harder to implement solutions like cross play could be beneficial.
---
but like yeah they really need to add accessibility options. red dead 2 for example is great for accessibility, they have a feature where you can make the key mash sequences easier or change them to a key hold, and theres even an option for changing how sprinting works to holding instead of mashing. dbd could really do with that.
---
from my pov, I'm getting trashed by survivors with good perks and I don't have anything good yet. I'm not saying let someone get red rank with one killer and keep rank 20 on another, maybe make it so that all killer ranks go up when one goes up, but maybe at a slower pace.
---
heresy
---
Well it doesn't do that either.
---
The problem is killers who don‚Äôt tunnel still get ds‚Äôd, that should not be happen since it‚Äôs suppose to be to combat tunneling like you said.
---
Lol XD
---
I wouldn't mind the maps as much if I could just see anything. I've been spending more BP just trying to find level offerings so I dont have to see those maps anymore.
---
You gotta admit, someone like David King could absolutely body Frank. 
---
David is an underground MMA fighter who‚Äôs also been a rugby player, then you have Frank of The Legion who‚Äôs just your average 19 year old teenager dawning a mask with a dagger. And since David is like i said, a rugby player/MMA fighter..Yeah, he can easily disarm Frank and beat the shit out of him with ease.
---
Cute little playful lad)
---
My old cat would sit on my keyboard, he was long enough her covered it and would look up at me and be like give me attention
---
That trapper was probably screaming on the inside  when you hit him with that 3 stun combo
---
Because it stays lit for the full duration even if they stop working on it. Getting the refresh more often makes it more accurate.
---
Looks like someone met a basement bubba
---
it‚Äôs much better if you just rotate the stick in a chill circle. no need to slam it back and forth like the animation makes people think
---
They should honestly just have a casual playlist and a ranked playlist for survivor and killer
---
Try to keep distance and use corner pallets as very early drops to make him go around and break LOS to avoid gas. Count the number of bottles he uses and if he runs out that's good.
---
Keep calm when he's close and try your best to see where he is at in gas and attempt to pallet stun him. Don't do unnecessary loops and try to get the stun if he has bottles.
---
Yes and I sat on a hook and had the game ruined for me. It‚Äôs not always about completing the gens or escaping. Being hooked quickly and tunneled is not fun and ruins the game
---
You get a cosmetic for the survivors. Although, I would just recomend saving money and using shards. The extra shirt is usually very, very bad. I would recomend looking up the extra cosmetic and deciding if you like it or not.
---
Rather it be something else like some rubble
---
Then it turns around and it's actually a baby
---
[i use a similar strategy](https://imgur.com/a/eeTF7dz)
---
The last time I discussed DB with somebody was almost a year ago, so here I go :3
---
&gt; You can sprint right before your exhaustion meter ands and then you literally have sprint burst on demand.
---
That's not true. Every time you are healing, doing gens or some other stuff your exhaustion is going down, so there is no way to actually safe SB until you need it.
---
&gt; Self care takes time, but it‚Äôs far from useless. It‚Äôs literally the ability to heal yourself. And there are many times when your medkit runs out. 
---
Just count how many times you actually need to heal yourself. Generally it's once or twice per game. You may disagree but most often than not you can run to a near-by gen, find a survivor and save some time by letting them heal you. Especially if you have `Bond` or something similar. I usually take a yellow or green medkit with enough charges to heal me twice or thrice and the only problem I might have is when killer runs `Franklin`. 
---
&gt; Decisive Strike is highly situational? The situation that requires it is also highly likely üòÇ. On average I use it 7/10 games.
---
Even if a killer starts chasing you after you get unhooked, it usually takes more than 2 minutes (I actually forgot proper numbers, sorry) for them to catch you. And if there are no pallets to prolong chases then `DC` isn't that much of a help anyway - it would just take a little longer to catch you. It was a nice perk 3 years ago, when you could spam it whenever you wanted, now it frustrates me way more often than it actually helps. Yep.
---
&gt; Adrenaline saved my butt many times during chase. 
---
Yes, it may help, and actually change the result of a game, but it's way too situational for me. I prefer perks which just work. All the time. Even if they aren't as cool or as flashy as this one.
---
&gt; You and I must have a different definition of useless. You also have to remember that because a perk isn‚Äôt OP, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs utterly useless.
---
My favourite ones are `WWMI`, `Kindred` (But I'm not sure whether I would like the new version, I really liked to force it on other survivors instead), `Iron Will` and `Botany`. These perks work all the time, they speed-up the game and never frustrate me.
---
The amount of people that don't understand why killers not being able to pick up a person for 60 seconds is a problem is disturbing. Like I get why you hate tunneling, but at the same time there is not enough time for the killer to win of they play by your imaginary rules.
---
Killers that have very strong powers (ex. Myers, spirit, nurse, and even oni) all have cooldowns or restrictions on their power. Because if they had it all the time it would be unfair. Oni's power is very strong and to me it seems too frequent. Just my 2 cents though.
---
Surprised he didn't DC. 
---
Most games I've played, killers DC'd when their totems got cleansed. I'm genuinely curious why.
---
"Just get me off Julie" Sounds like it has more meaning to it
---
Well idk genrushing just kinda makes the game unfun for the killer because the people who gen rush will camp at the gate or camp pallets while teabagging you as fast as they can
---
David King would beat their ass really quickly if Legion had no knife
---
This is not as bad as OP's. Also, neither are that bad.
---
Haven't seen a face that smug that wasn't wearing a magicians hat
---
Bro stop the spam
---
üòÇ
---
Oni's power is remarkably more difficult to use than those and much easier for survivors to deny
---
you're being extremely reductive with your reasoning
---
I mean Spirit for instance. She has a very short cooldown, can cancel it anytime, and then it regenerates from that point immediately, and she is much better than Oni
---
Nurse barely has a cooldown at all even post nerf. honestly i find it baffling you used her to try and support your point
---
myers is simply weaker than oni overall (may not be true on console tho) so, eh, i'd rather contain the argument to killers arguably in the same tier area
---
Gen rushing is literally people doing the main objective of the game.
---
always will!
---
This is why we run no mither people it counters Myers plag legion billy oni noed devour make your choice and other things it‚Äôs literally so good
---
That's ballsy. Betchu pissed that guy off real good xD
---
True, but three perks for one situation?
---
Who relies in noed anyway
---
that data is junk. it doesn't control for any relevant variables
---
The person complaining about the matchmaking levels is the same person that will complain about queue times if they changed it tomorrow.
---
I mean not only is it a cool outfit but it genuinely helps with stealth since it's 90% black leather
---
Wasn't there some discussion that they wanted to do separate ranks for killer when they discussed longer "seasons" for rank resets?
---
(but yes, Def agree with your post, I'd personally like to try more Billy but I'm Rank 5 and why torture myself with getting my ass handed to me, when I'm supposed to be playing for fun)
---
My man went to go make some popcorn to watch the survivor die inside
---
I got scared by a survivor the other day while playing survivor. I was working on the preschool basement gen on Badham, and it had the spawn where it‚Äôs under that hole in the floor. Well, I still didn‚Äôt know who the killer was, so I‚Äôm looking out for a ghost face or Myers just in case, and a Meg drops through the floor and scares the hell out of me
---
A) that was in response to a different comment.
---
B) it's not junk, but whatever helps you sleep at night.
---
I found [this](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/29e35174-9f47-41fc-919d-6a6352d8be45/ddjobee-a2ac6d21-ecba-4eab-a62e-5d4f91417115.png?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzI5ZTM1MTc0LTlmNDctNDFmYy05MTlkLTZhNjM1MmQ4YmU0NVwvZGRqb2JlZS1hMmFjNmQyMS1lY2JhLTRlYWItYTYyZS01ZDRmOTE0MTcxMTUucG5nIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.L7eUr0YenG6rKye8ozr47usl6R1_im1lR6sKPeZgsqM) on deviantart (from user: WitchyGmod), seemed cool, and apropos-enough to drop here.
---
The power and perks you created all seem pretty interesting. Perk values would have to be tinkered with, but they seem viable. Brute Force should have a much shorter cooldown I think, to be able to reliably use the ability in chases. As long as he can't just break windows and pallets with it, survivors would still have a defense. Maybe a 30 second cooldown.
---
the items anti-hemorrhagic syringe and styptic agent used to both instantly heal you, syringe could put a down survivor back up and fully healed while styptic would only heal you one health state. they were reworked not to long ago so that styptic gives you a borrowed time effect and the syringe is now a heal over time, it starts at 16 seconds but gets lower if you use another add on that increases the healing speed.
---
+/-6 ranks. This is matchmaking working as intended.

Did they call you a camper after?

Trust me, you don‚Äôt want the new map. It‚Äôs too dark to see anything and you get stuck on random pebbles or grass all over the place. Very strange glitches all over.
---
The amout of toxic DC's are already killing the game and ruining it. So what's the point anyway ? or broken ranking system. This game almost promotes being total dick and toxic to have any sign of ''fun'' and ''fairness'' in your experience.
---
swf toy
---
Cleansing makes the game easy. You obviously aren't good at using her power. Survivors can't loop you at all and no pallet is safe. Doesn't matter if they're at full health or not.
---
The Survivor half of the community created their own long queues by being absolutely toxic and making it unfun to play Killer. There's a reason survivor queues take forever in every region on every platform (except OCE).
---
If people are gonna be assholes all the time, they shouldn't be confused when no one wants to play with them. Crying that the devs need to make queues shorter for survivors by punishing killers (As mid-rank killers playing with low-rank survivors is a bad thing) is just going to make **less** people want to play killer.
---
It's not an age thing there's obviously something else seriously wrong so be kind.
---
I honestly thought that would be a good counter...until it absolutely wasn‚Äôt.
---
I like to think she does even if the devs confirmed otherwise. I already loved her as a character and thinking she's autistic like me makes her even more relatable.
---
Use whatever you want for the 4th perk; Ruin, BBQ, whatever. I'm not the type of person who likes to use all meta perks, all the time. I prefer ones that just synergize with each other.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that he joked
---
You'd be surprised at how effective activating your power midchase is around high wall loops is. It's an insta-mindgame. Getting the expose mechanic off it cool, but honestly the stealth midchase is where it's at imo.
---
Right? I don‚Äôt get why they cleanse. Do they not realize that they will be heavily hindered and if they manage to infect all the fountains they immediately turn back to normal ones?
---
Seriously earlier today I was crouching in some shrubbery in Lery's by a pallet loop and a Claudette came up to me and crouched there as well. Didn't see me. Shat her pants when she heard the roar come from right next to her.
---
"Something something ur mum gai hurrr durrr"  /s
---
Silly question but who is this Jeff?
---
Wiggle points.
---
No killer who's read No Mither's description will leave you slugged if they see you're permanently injured from the start of the game.
---
It does do that
---
I have had the weekend off from work and have been playing quite a bit. I have seen about 7-8 total DCs with one game 3 out of a minimum of 50 games. If you remove that 1 game that is 4-5 out of 50 games and that is a high estimate. You talk as if it is every other game there is a DC, if that is the case there is something else going on that you are not telling us.
---
I hope you feel the pain of fire burning on your entire body for all eternity

---
Sorry english isn't my mother tongue.
---
Yeah you're right and my wife also said you're right :D
---
sorry that was my mistake
---
Sure. If you don‚Äôt mind being downed in one hit the entire match.
---
Its ok i understand, i didn‚Äôt mean anything negative by it was just curious.
---
One time I was crouch walking as the pig and I went to walk through a pallet only to get it dropped on my by a nea I didn't even know was there. I fucking almost dropped my controller i jumped so hard
---
I personally don‚Äôt take advantage of Pig‚Äôs special attack because I don‚Äôt like the crouching speeds (I still have her at level 11 with very few add-ons). What I do use her for is her traps. They‚Äôre absolutely fantastic to put pressure on survivors and help a lot with contrasting ‚Äúgen rushing‚Äù, if you wanna call it that
---
As someone who plays killer and surv, the dev's are catering to survivors far far too much. Old legion was fine. Oooo he has to chase you and stab you 3 times in which that entire time he needs to wait for his power to fill back up to do it again. Only thing they needed to nerf was Frank's Mixtape. He was totally fine otherwise. 
---
RIP stabby friends
---
Inner Strength is nice for the quick heals, but it‚Äôs only limited 5 per match. It‚Äôs kind of like between A/B. Good and fun to use but not necessarily a top perk, since you do rely on teammates not to cleanse totems to make the most out of it. For the most part, I agree with the rest of the perks.
---
That isn't a retaliation that's a declaration of war.
---
This is why killers tunnel and camp. Because you can get 8 hooks and play well but survivors will still wait at the exit gates until there‚Äôs seconds left. You have to stop caring what they say, once I played how I felt I needed to (not always abiding to every rule in the survivor book) I enjoyed the game a lot more. Getting a 4K on a toxic SWF is fun, not playing fair and them talking shit. They‚Äôre likely gonna talk shit anyway so play dirty.
---
Hmm. It might be worth asking u/Peanits if there's a connection between Killer and Realm *before* Offerings are taken into account (i.e. perhaps Oni and Spirit naturally have a higher chance of pulling Yamaoka rather than a "true" random Realm selection).
---
&gt;  it's not junk, but whatever helps you sleep at night.
---
yes it is. how is it not?
---
it doesn't account for things like survivors allowing a 1k to become a 4k by going on a suicide mission to save one player. it doesn't account for escapes due to AFK killers or pity sacrifices. it doesn't account for games where a survivor hook suicides or DCs at the start
---
if you want to use data to make a statement on game balance it would need those things
---
It only works on one person at a time, and myc has a 60 second cool down. And if they play stealthy it won't work anyway. Cool concept though

---
I'm really not sure if this is sarcastic or not
---
*fite meh*
---
A lot of other killers already do that by default.
---
Ghost face, plague, Oni, shape, ect.
---
That moment you bump them just to egg it on.
---
Needs to weigh "Overall Killer Rank" with "Specific Killer chosen Rank" along with "Bloodpoints invested into chosen Killer."
---
You can be brand new with Oni, but if you have 500 hours of Killer behind you then you're not brand-new Rank 20. A level 1 Oni is also different than a Level 50 Oni.
---
This sounds like what was happening to me when i played killer, it tilted the fuck out of me because i know im a better survivor than them (they like rank 15 im rank 1 currently not a flex just a statement) but yet they were tbagging and looping me for whole games untill i found the oni now im rank 7 killer and climbing. So maybe find a killer that works for you? 
---
At the end of the day people are going to be toxic no matter what,  the game itself is almost 100% toxicity theres nothing u can do exept  move on, not get angry
---
Yes, and running self care alongside it is an easy escape.
---
Console onis will remember this
---
So what? It's all in how you play. You don't have to always go for the guy who unhooks. Like I said, the 4th perk can be whatever you want. Ruin, Pop, and BBQ are powerful enough to offset anything. It all depends on whether you feel you need them to succeed.
---
&gt; The Survivor half of the community created their own long queues by being absolutely toxic and making it unfun to play Killer. 
---
zZzZzZzZzZz
---
Survivors big meanies. 
---
Every single killer out there have their own little list of things they consider toxic. As a survivor you can't even begin to contemplate what they might consider toxic during the match.
---
Also, 9 out of 10 posts complaining about matchmaking comes from killers. Survivors queues are still fine for the most part.
---
I love it when image searched photos have a transparent bait that you have to fix yourself.
---
You can't heal if you use self care with no mither, so it's useless.
---
Second wind as well
---
Yeah, it's fine. Hope you could enjoy the song nontheless
---
I have played oni and I 4ked with him my second game with 1 perk on purple ranks. Sounds like we have completely different experiences and thus different opinions.
---
Dwighty &lt;/3
---
That's it's power
---
People that decide they want to be a fucking asshole OR people the generally enjoy the perk, Idk
---
Yeah I‚Äôm aware. I‚Äôve been wondering how they thought this will play out
---
Maybe it's because of the region? I'm red ranks I find a game as a killer in max 1min and as a purple rank survivor in max 5min.
---
As a survivor I have a hard time running the killer and often find myself getting cornered or just not being able to juke like on pc since I play on Xbox. I would really enjoy some tips for running the killer more effectively if anyone would like to share some. Thanks :)
---
I'm not even sure how to respond to what you just said... but I'll try.
---
If you struggle guarantied you are going to die this will net you 200 or less points (given the example provided). If you don't struggle you may get either hatch or the exit gate either one netting you 7000 points to 6250 points. So in conclusion if you struggle you will die earning around 200 points. If you don't struggle you could potentially earn 7000 points.
---
And they know they get away with it
---
fatass uglyass clown obviously
---
i totally get where you're coming from, but a its contingent on a single factor -- that the killer is going to let me live. 
---
seeing as the killer's sole purpose is to kill me, i just assume i'm not going to survive, so i'm going to fight to the bitter end.

You cant bodyblock in the basement anymore old man
---
Jake low key looks like Levi
---
That‚Äôs what makes it even worse. My bf spoils the FUCK out of him to the point that the cat gets jealous when I get hugs.
---
It does that to me constantly even though I have pretty good internet, so I have no idea.
---
Saying it's bad because you have to check so many boxes is doing all but say word for word that it's shit.
---
Yeah it's good to use your dash, but not for both hits. I personally damage initially with a dash then down with my normal melee.
---
Saw in twitch chat today that someone said they have DCd 15 times in the last two days to ‚Äútest‚Äù the dc penalty.... alright dude
---
Yeah that killer is going to be so overpowered all killer mains will be abusing it
---
I consider Demo a THUMP THUMP THUMP killer until it takes off the lead boots. Yr build sounds interesting though, I like it; creative concept.
---
I love the shit eating grin from what i assume is feng on the far left
---
It does it is just you that don't understand it and the grammar was okay. The way you said it is actually wrong because survivors have nothing to do with the perk. You can'really say that now OTHER survivors can procs it too. It is dumb. You probably did not understand it at all or you don't know how that killer perk works. Whatever - this is waste of time!
---
Not at all it was mostly me explaining what actual lag switching is and telling her she got through hatch aka the RNG mechanic. I was demo on cold wind I was rank 1 she‚Äôs was rank 4 she hid all game and used sprint burst when I came near. I was also talking about how toxic she was and how I said gg and got ‚Äúyour a shitty killer‚Äù
---
You can sign up to be a beta tester at anytime I think
---
I think David alone would of been enough to beat the shit outta him. It's just insult to injury when the others come in.
---
so I just had one of the BEST matches ever- all of us survived. worked together on all gens, unhooked and healed the 2 that got caught... and I went from 17 to 16? How is that possible?
---
Edit: spelling
---
I have no idea. Should I switch my region?
---
Get a PC?
---
Would explain Yamaoka, to be sure, but Coldwind?
---
This alongside the swf's queueing at the highest rank in the group also make it weighted for high ranks. I have no idea how they thought it would play out either.
---
For messing with my friend? Not gonna happen haha
---
They weren't using either of those. That's what confused me lol
---
I don't know. Should I switch my region?
---
So is this not supposed to be happening?
---
it‚Äôd be a great QoL change for Devour Hope, for sure.
---
Hahaha starwars emperor "DO IT" joke hahahahha never seen that before hahahaha
---
This happened a few days ago to me, I was about to get pissed because the match started with 3 survivors, then I just heard oni music and huntress lullaby at the same time, just left lol.
---
I mean sure, but Legion‚Äôs intro video literally shows him surprising David by pretending to be a survivor (which is what Legions power should‚Äôve been based around). He‚Äôs more about speed and smarts than raw strength, but his Mad Grit perk shows that Legion isn‚Äôt weak physically either.
---
i don't even run it on purpose i just forget to switch it out
---
If you fight back the killer is guarantied going to kill you. I play mainly killer and when a survivor struggles in my grip even for a second any chance I might have let the survivor go is instantly pissed away.
---
Absolutely. Accessibility options are expected from modern games. There's literally 0 reason to not have it.
---
Except, iT'S cAlLed sTRUgglE fOr A rEaSoN
---
gg ez BABY killer
---
So you admit your grammar and wording skills are shit.
---
What's the point of censoring the curse words? Isn't the game rated M anyway?
---
The trophy‚Äôs were bugged for over a year.
---
On the last patch they should be fixed now. After games it was resetting.
---
Just remove the unhook requirement, what's the big deal.
---
Have you ever got the vault message instead of dropping a pallet.........
---
I have anger problems I think? Anyway I was just not having that.
---
I praise God that Xbox doesn't ban me for the bullshit I get reported for. Iron grasp, agitation, and fucking monstrous shrine? OP basement build better report it.
---
Hahaha. I get jealous when my bf gives the cat all of his attention üòÇ
---
That happened to me , with a Freddy lmao
---
and i get that. but when i play survivor, i have to do everything i can to survive. there's no guarantee that i'll be playing against /u/AntiPlague12898 , who will let me go if i'm the last survivor.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a human. Why does a *cat* get more attention than me??‚Äù
---
Good plagues don‚Äôt need LoS to hit you they can predict movement, spew over and cover the area.  Plague can win regardless if people cleanse or not so I think it‚Äôs better to cleanse you just have to do it smartly which most people don‚Äôt do unfortunately
