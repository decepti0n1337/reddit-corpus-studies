I‚Äôm reading this as I‚Äôm stuck on the infinite loading screen :(
---
to quote a guy on YouTube who said this once:
---

---
FINNA GET MY LORE

Battle passes is a manipulative as fuck, that's my biggest problem with them, or any cosmetics for that matter. "It's not p2w yada yada", let me explain. It hits your FOMO( fear of missing out) hard. Someone buys a cosmetic and uses it in a game, other person sees it and immediately thinks " looks nice, should buy it too". I know a lot of people have control over them, I personally don't care about cosmetics, I just use my p3 gear, but I, and other people who have control over their actions is not a target audience. Target audience is poor bastards who have no control over their spending habbits. They just have to have everything in a game, even tho they will never use it. We knew this for a long time, they are even called whales( people who spend a lot of money on a game) and dolphins ( your average spender). Most people don't care about this thing, it's harmless and not p2w, why do you care? Well, be happy you can fight back your urges to spend money, some people can't, and they are being robbed blind by this manipulative systems. Phone games started it, seeing ALL of multiplayer 'live service' games doing it is really sickening. At this point I only play dbd and rocket league, tho rocket league is predatory as fuck too these days and I play it less and less, dbd might also go down the drain, if half the screen will become buy our cosmetics, battle passes, windows cleaners, toilet fresheners etc.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox one and whenever I try loading it says initializing error. I‚Äôve restarted disconnected yes reconnected WiFi but there is no fix.
---
wow! TOSIC!
---
 WAZZZZUUUUUUUUUIUUUUUUUP
---
It's kind of like no mans sky, they could have left it alone and be terrible, but they worked on it, and it's amazing. Props to the devs!
---
I mean, he didn't touch them all game.
---
Bro, honestly, just don‚Äôt worry about what other people say. I main survivor, does it take away the fun for me if I‚Äôm hard tunnelled by a killer and/or camped? Yeah, it really does. I get frustrated and a bit salty but I don‚Äôt go messaging the killer about it. I get over it and move on to the next match. As long as you‚Äôre not breaking any rules then do whatever.
---
Good job, man. Pat yourself on the back! :)
---
This is true for players that are fairly skilled, but I assure you there are people that plateau in green for a given reset.
---
You should use NOED, Spies from the shadow is pretty bad.
---
Not out yet but ghostface teabag
---
Lolao true
---
Amazing.
---
i like
---
So you think he singled you out?
---
If you go to help and tips, and the game, it shows a list of status effects and what the icons mean. Same with Proficiency Indicators. 
---
Mangled (Broken bone icon) means injuries take longer to heal. Healing speed decreases by 25%. 
---
Blindness only removes auras and doesn't actually impair vision. While a hypothetical blindness thing that would hit the killer would be pretty powerful (Gen auras, hook auras, etc.) there's not much in terms of auras survivors can see by default (IIRC only dying survivors on the ground, which can be reduced to a certain distance with Knock Out, and auras of Survivors on the hook as well as the hook itself IIRC) unless they're running something like Bond, Empathy (See auras of survivors, and injured survivors only but at a greater distance) or niche perks like Windows of Opportunity (Pallet and Window auras) or Alert (See killer's aura when they break a pallet/kick a gen)
---
Hemorrhage causes increased bleeding (Not speed of bleedout when in dying, but the actual blood trails) and running Sloppy Butcher + BloodHound is a great way to track survivors if you're often having trouble with scratch marks which can be iffy sometimes. 
---
And yeah Exposed = one-hit downs from "most" attacks. I don't think Huntress Hatchets can one-shot you even with exposed, and Legion's frenzy definitely can't. (NOED + Feral Frenzy would be nuts)
---
I once got hit by a survivor, ran away a distance, turned around and pointed, they paused, turned away and back, I pointed again and they walked away. I also do the same with lockers and they‚Äôll open it every time, power of suggesion
---
It's not a phase, entity mom!
---
It actually looks like you're in a horror movie in this image.
---
Was it confirmed he would be 115MS after rework?
---
I'm saying that they were teaming up.
---
all hail the all seeing wraith
---
#WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!
---
I mean, it cuts down the work the killer has to do to win by like 30-50% depending on luck.  
---
  
---
It's like if survivor only needed to do 2-3 gens plus doors to escape. That's why they massively nerfed the BNP, 4 survivors with 4 bnp was way too broken.  
---
If it gave you 20% less work it would still be OP, but not broken like it is. I don't know how they can make it like that, but if you tunnel off the hook, ebony can end a game really fast unless survivors just don't rescue and do gens.
---
WHAZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!!
---
WAAAAZAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPP????
---
I love pointing or waving when a killer is running towards me. Sometimes you can have them leave you which is a solid mind game. If not then hey I was being stupid and earned the hit
---
Or maybe it has something to do with you stepping into a trap? Lol I mean, ya can‚Äôt really blame anyone else for that
---
She does, look in the shop, I‚Äôll even get a picture of you think so strongly feng doesn‚Äôt have blonde hair
---
I mean, people were crying about LF being OP and needing a nerf...  
---
People will cry if they don't know how to play against a new killer, and deem their own ignorance as proof that he's too OP.
---
It‚Äôs a risky mind game but so hilarious and satisfying when it works
---
Yo?
---
I know it's pretty obvious but it had me fucking spinning
---
Hey, a trash bin is exceptionally useful! Don't go knockin' trash bins!
---
Just play TOTH without NOED and watch everyone freak out.
---
Play Haunted Grounds and TOTH for extra excitement.
---
That's why I went from killer main to survivor. As survivor I at least have teammates. Killer feels too isolated to play it nonstop.
---
Can we get the reports to start working on console?
---
Yeah? Thats Claudette is that what your trying to say? They said that in the livestream
---
no that'll just make it harder to get perks
---
the girl in the picture is claudette, the cinemates are basically animated backstories from the ingame characters.
---
Yeah, really is a different game as you go through the ranks.
---
we're getting animated backstories from the characters, the devs said they wanted to add a real story, and this is part of how they do it.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bvkhrw/heres_the_template_i_used_when_i_made_the_meme/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I've started to learn to take my time and not rush people as a killer main. I've been playing The Shape which requires you to take it slow and loving him. What would be a good DBD Youtuber to watch in your opinion?
---
Although it IS possible to get all the non licensed characters with iridescent shards right? so not necessarily $70 in DLC for everything. even then you'd have to play for hundreds of hours to get everyone with iridescent shards. 
---
speaking of that, why do you have like 300,000 shards saved up?
---
If you haven‚Äôt seen recent developments, Sony has become a lot more open to cross-platform.  I don‚Äôt see why DBD couldn‚Äôt do it.
---
same here. when i encounter an asshole SWF for the second time i always switch to doctor with franklins, ruin, NOED and sloppy butcher with a pink mori.
---
omg I've had similar experiences introducing my friends. It's soooo fun.
---
Half the time I camp this happens
---
Survivor unhooks
---
I get one hit on rescuer
---
Both are freed
---
Playing wise, legion would be good. 
---
Entertainment wise, plague is the choice.
---
\*their
---
Get gud.
---
That sounds awesome and a lot of fun but you would have trouble against a team that is communicating 
---
David: hey is that you next to me?
---
Feng: no I'm working on a gen.
---
Claudette: no im crouching in the grass.
---
Dwight: not me, im hiding in a locker.
---
David: surprised pikachu face
---
They must be aware too that F2P means more customers. On the outside it appears this is the standard business model nowadays
---
Yeah I am not good and usually get harassed by survivors in chat lol.
---
Why though? You guys already had a survivor come out why do you all want another?
---
[removed]
---
Yep, I just tried, from what I've read I don't think it'll stick around past the free period though...
---
It isnt gamebreaking it's just aggravating
---
I see you are also a man of culture.
---
Except I usually run unnerving instead of sloppy, but sloppy is a great option too. It's funny to sometimes see those TAXIC SWFERS scream continously in my terror radius trying to get out of madness 3.
---
thank you! and it actually is. its darker than the color i chose tho. but freddy has a red &amp; green striped sweater
---
Step one to getting better: dont camp. It's a easy one kill but kills arent the goal of the game, points and emblems are.
---
So does the ingame report system not actually do anything?
---
Okay, that it. I'mma have an aneurysm from your stupidly. I'm not repeating myself.
---
Honestly, it is hard to reply to you because it's hard to even follow what the hell you even wrote man. You wrote a huge paragraph that has a tiny tiny bit about the actual battle pass. Battle pass or not, people will either like or not like the game. Battle pass or not, some players will eventually get banned. Battle pass or not, there will always be bugs just like there will always be bugs in every software ever. You wrote about DLC's which has absolutely nothing to do with the battle pass. You wrote about skins in the store which other games that have battle pass also still support, so another moot point.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It seems like you believe the same people who made battle pass is the same who are fixing the game, which is absolutely not true.
---
It seems you also believe it would deter new players because they would think its pay two win? The battle pass literally states its for cosmetics. I don't know what games you have played but cosmetics has never been pay to win.
---
Let's take a game like Paladins for instance, it has a battle pass system too. Skins you can still purchase as well as earn with battle pass. I've never ever heard of Paladins until it came out on the Switch. I open the game, see battle pass, ignore it and just play the game to see if I even like the game play. Do I like the game play? Sure, then let's explore more about the game itself. As far as I can see, that's pretty much how others play it out too. Can you name a game that has a battle pass that was ever pay to win? An actual battle pass. I've haven't seen one.
---
In terms of old players, I have played since 2016 and am a casual player now, I absolutely look forward to the battle pass.
---

---
Yeah lmao
---
Its okay
---
At least you put some into it
---
Oof. I draw in black and white cause I'm colorblind. In game it looks red and black and this looks red and green.
---
It isn‚Äôt game breaking or unfair. And that whole ‚Äúit ruins someone‚Äôs game‚Äù argument people make is dumb. If getting caught and hooked ruins their time then this is not the game for them.
---
AGain, you havent explained why its a problem . Leatherface didnt get a survivor either, and Bill and Ash dont have killers. 
---
Its just a thing that happens sometimes.
---
you don't need the whole card to get a bingo
---
Trapple is actually sick. nj
---
There is a section in the tutorial bit that goes over all of them
---
Oh so basically the bone thing is lying on the floor when I shaded the floor in I forgot to add detail to make it look like it‚Äôs lying at his feet, then there‚Äôs one of his add-on symbols drawn into the ground n like entity tentacles bursting out the ground around it üòÑ weird but I liked where my mind was taking me
---
Same. Try running bond
---
Welcome to the kill count,where we tally up the victims in all our favourite horror movies! I'm James A. Janisse and today we're looking at *movie name*
---
Ya but THOSE AREN'T CHAPTERS!
---
Myers should be tier S.
---
No, no, yes, yes. I miss the base game, in case you arent aware, the game came out on june 14th 2016. People not having perks was nice, everyone had low level perks they didn't know how to use and they didn't care, so pretty much, vanilla dead by daylight. After a while people started caring, and it was STILL fun. But now we have all these perks that in my eyes are WAY more un-fun to play against, and they keep getting dumber as they come out. There was always A meta as there is in every game but even then I at least got to see different perks get used by survivors and killers alike, unlike BBQ &amp; Chili and Self Care which you wont go without seeing now.
---
TL;DR I don't miss the shit parts, I hate infinites and pallet spam as much as anyone. I just miss the variation of perks being used and intense fun game play. The meta has been stable, stable trash.
---
Solo is rough
---
Until then, I‚Äôm James A. Janisse. And this has been the Kill Count. Thanks everybody, be good people!
---
yea i actually thought its black and red for most of the time too until i took a closer look. its much darker tho, pine green... maybe ill edit the color a bit. but not today, too annoyed by drawing this xD
---
It‚Äôs not it‚Äôs rude and toxic. Difference
---
Same. I always use my green mori on teabaggers/flashlight clickers.
---
You do know that the killer‚Äôs entire objective is to catch and kill the survivors right? Your whole argument is basically ‚Äúit‚Äôs not fun because then they lose (die)‚Äù. To say that ‚Äúthey got screwed‚Äù because they got downed, hooked and couldn‚Äôt be saved is nonsense. They lost, fair and square.
---
Fuck
---
I have not played the game for more than 1.5 hours in a straight year mate. And no one said they quit playing in the first place so??
---
What is this from?
---
WAZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
So if someone gets the unhook or heal first, is every other player fucked cause they didnt run across the entire map before someone else did?
---
Ah! The way you worded the other comment made it seem that you were mocking him for stepping in a bear trap. Good for you for clearing that up.
---
This is why I main Quentin
---
Which Killer are you using?
---
Waaaaaaaaaaaaazzzzzzzaaaaaaa
---
Opinion
---
Yep
---
Lol I would have loved to experienced that glitch. Honestly, 2v8 seems like an interesting concept, but got the lag is already bad at times.
---
you're focusing on the least important part of my example, replace this with hag, doctor, myers what ever.
---
Maybe it's just because I don't abandon teamates, but I only use it normally for auras.
---
My friend just bought dbd because i played it, i made sure to let him know hell regret it lmao
---
Ah, I see. Thank you so much for clarifying!

They did on Twitter.
---
Female survivors tend to have louder moans. It's a fair trade off.
---
Yeah the connection will be an issue for sure
---
Just 5 gens to go!
---
Doctor can end a loop instaly if he times the shock, and it depends on hag trap placement. 
---
If Myers has Tier 3 saved up and procs it then yes he ends chases instaly before they  happen.
---
No they didn't, but okay.
---
The point was there are alot of more minior status effects that dont come out often but are still an effect that can occur.
---
Thank you good sir.
---
No, I didn‚Äôt dumb it down. It was dumb to begin with. I‚Äôd say maybe I misunderstood something but you literally even said ‚Äúit ruins one person‚Äôs time‚Äù which is what your entire argument seemed to break down to so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case.
---
And how is not getting off the hook ‚Äúrude‚Äù? If your gameplay is just getting on the hook and dying maybe you need to figure put how to stay off the hook to begin with. No one is obliged to let you win.
---
I third this!
---
distressing or whispers for unrelenting
---
Speaking from personal experience, I just find Plague to be too braindead and unfun.
---
thank you so much!!!
---
Nah i agree
---
How do you do that?
---
Yamoka Estate: Am i a joke to you?
---
I'll be sure to bring this up during the next PS4 killer meeting and let them know that you're really angry at them.
---
oh wow thank you so much!
---
What's the point there's only one in the game anyway.
---
Thank the people who helped me with the others.
---
Yeah when you get a infinite loading screen, your game actually stops responding, not sure how the logo still moves.
---
Because I am a noob
---
This, I like this a lot.
---
They did acaullty. At first
---
oh nice! thank you!!
---
You can't be this stupid. They literally said that when they showed it.

Damn has no one played bingo?

Also you cant Load into 3 man games anymore
---
You really are a dayum idiot. Proof?
---
Here are some others: 
---
Broken where you cant be healed. 
---
Exhausted where you cant use perks with them. 
---
Haemorrhage makes survivors bleed more then normal. 
---
There are also postive buffs, like vision and haste
---
How is it rude? Are you saying that it is impolite to not let you win?
---
Kaguya sama love Is War anime episode 5
---
The toxic game has evolved
---
So hook survivors then run away?
---
Be good? I down someone, I hook them, I go find someone else. Keep them off gens, run tracking perks so I dont patrol where there isnt anyone, keep someone hooked at all times, know when to leave a survivor on a loop that takes too much time, stuff like that.
---
The aim of the game for the killer is to kill you. Their a good killer if they kill you. You got trapped and the killer took advantage of that.
---
Yes, that is what you are supposed to do. Hook them, find someone else.
---
Practice then. Best advice I can give you. I hate camping but for your gameplay the best you can do is practice. 
---
Try and get better watch videos try to learn and understand. If you want to camp that‚Äôs totally your choice but about 80% of people dislike it. 
---
If you practice you can climb ranks and get more kills or if you want you can still play how you do it‚Äôs really up to you.
---
After you find someone new, hook them. 3 hooks they die.
---
i wish mccote was my dad
---
They want you to believe they'll let you play before breaking your heart.
---
The thing about dbd it that the goal of the game can be whatever the person playing it *wants* it to be. Dbd attracts narcissict survivor mains who are toxic as fuck and killer mains that have superiority and power complexes often leading to camping and dc'ing if the person escapes somehow. Very few people who continue to to play this game after 2 years care about BP or ranking and play only for the "lulz". People will always be shitty to one another behind the guise of internet anonymity. I do agree though, camping will never *CONSISTENTLY* give a killer a 4k.
---
WASZZZZZZZZZZZZZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
---
Dude, that's crazy...
---
https://twitter.com/deadbybhvr/status/1113112638047780864
---
Voice chat would make playing killer infinitely more funny. Lol honestly I think it would even help reduce the toxic, endless stream of salty post-game messages.
---
alright ill check that out thank you!
---
Wow he is pretty pretty.
---
When that happens I'm quitting out
---
*nurse activates their trap card*
---
Camping can only get you so far. When you win it‚Äôs mostly because you either have NOED for the end or the team was dumb and keeps trying to save instead of doing gens or someone dcs which screws over all the other survivors. 
---
You don‚Äôt need to be good at the game to camp either you just have to get palletslammed a bunch until you find your opportunity to kill one person. Or that person makes a small mistake in the early part of the chase which you capitalize off of.
---
I have put a LOT of time in the game, and dont care about rank, its bullshit, and I dont care for BP, I have all the perks I want, I play to have fun. Camping is just at its core, unfun. I like to chase and down survivors, not find one person and afk the rest of the game.
---
this is why spine-chill is king against spirit
---
It's possible, but unless they optimize the console version so it doesn't play like a damn slideshow it won't go well at at all
---
The problem that i see is stereotypes would form (like the john wick in fortnite). Say that at rank 100 you get a glowing hat for ace, next season people who see that ace would be scared and dodge a lobby. They could have said something about this in the stream but i wasnt in town and i didnt have internet so i couldnt watch it.
---
WWWWWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPPP

WALKED RIGHT INTO MY TRAP! 
---
Haha no I hate promoting myself but I make DBD Videos and stream Killer mainly. Heres a link to the playlist I think they are pretty well received by the community as fair play. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLihxUgpxYknDHuHTWvxHoSfcZQZegE_kD
---
Apart from myself there is Monto who is doing really well and tru3ta1ent has great gamesense. The game is really about unlocking perks from each of the characters to try and build a super character. Or being able to use different interesting builds etc. 
---
I also do a weekly show where I talk about the shrine of secrets which can let you unlock perks from characters you haven't leveled. It changes every week

She's usually super immersed(not doing anything except hide in a bush since she's good at camouflage) and they'll sandbag a lot too
---
Excuse my ignorance im new to the sub and the game, what is SWF?
---
The idea is nice, but would be next to useless on 4 man SWF, wouldn't it?
---
Me whenever I see a Dwight or a David
---
Mirror myers is the reason I love this game.
---
Lmao no. Yes the aim is to kill you but killing a survivor doesnt make a good killer, im pretty sure, thats why they changed the pipping system anyway
---
 you can get a 4k and not even pip from it. Why is that? Because you can get all 4 kills and still play like shit. Youre a good killer if you can get a 4k without camping and tunneling. Tunneling is brainless and an 8 year old can do it.
---
I keep playing "fair" and getting demolished as Plague while doing it. 
---
It's depressing, but ah well. Try as I might, I just can't seem to put out any map pressure as her.
---
i would upvote but you used prayer beads
---
Do you main killer? Do you try both sides?
---
She is trying a sinead o'connor look.You know, singers stuff.
---
Most of the time, you can count on a blendette to be crouching in a bush, doing absolutely nothing all game except activating camouflage. Also, they‚Äôre known to be pretty toxic, like running flashlights and clicking it at killers and tea bagging.
---
survive with friends. when you play killer against a 4 player SWF, you have all 4 survivors on voice comms with each other making it very hard to do good. at higher ranks especially, they can be really toxic and really powerful
---
Xbox doesn‚Äôt seem this bad but i might just be too low a rank to see it. I usually just get an annoying doctor who grinded to get all the best addons and perks and wants to fuck with new survivors.
---
Dude it gets better. I messaged the killer from my previous game and the two survivors from this one. The killer and one of them messaged me back. Keep in mind these were two separate games. (I also may have been aggressively salty but seriously fuck this shit)
---

i remember when i would get scaried of a wraith popping out of nowhere... now its just o hey its my boy the wraith
---
I completely understand üò∏ I hate going against that.
---
NOES?
---
WAZZZSSSSUP
---
Yes. If you are hooked, I'll try to save you even if I die in the process, but with NOED, unless you are close to a powered exit, NOPE.
---
Honestly, his perks kinda suck. Even Ghostface as a whole sounds pretty low tier, especially since just looking at him stops his stalking.
---
It does for reviewing footage to see hacking, toxicity(racism, sexism, anti-religious behavior, etc) but not for dcing. I think they spoke about tracking player dcs during the dev stream but i can‚Äôt quite remember if they did or didn‚Äôt.
---
Man it really is. I thought PC was bad sometimes but wow it's miserable on console.
---
A perk I hate but even if I don‚Äôt say it it‚Äôs not like you won‚Äôt figure it out.
---
No one escapes death. Look it up.
---
No
---
Omg, you mean me üòÇüòÇ
---
Did anyone say it was news?
---
I mean, not entirely. If they are a SWF and they see a friend of theirs they may not question it. Especially if The Thing keeps changing. It could throw them off and slow the game down if they‚Äôre constantly asking their friends who is who and being paranoid all the time.
---
A
---
Jk idk üôà
---
Camping isn't fun for me as killer either, but I would be lying if I didnt admit to having Basement-faced a few times when i was still a young killer-main for the "lulz." Now that i am a grown-up survivor main i have a lot more empathy for camped survivors.
---
Lmaoooo
---
WAAAZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!!!!
---
So losing a hooked survivor isn't bad like j thought?
---
I have basement bubbaed before, but only when I'm feeling like being a dick, I am well aware that I shouldn't. After a bad game I used to camp cause it felt good. Now I use iri head huntress with flower babushka and watch the dcs pour in.
---
Because they are the most useless pieces of shit who are only played coz immersion and self care.
---
Nope! I usually get all 3 hooks when a surv dies. May I ask what killer you play?
---
grOOvy :D
---
Oh sorry, did I say Quentin? I should have said Gremlin Man. :D
---
I actually main Freddy atm. And barely ever get lower than 4ks. I don't see what the fuss was about him. I rarely get to endgame. And when i do... bloodwarden.

The Shape or Huntress. I prefer huntress because she is easier to use
---
But all that is defeated by one issue. He is the only killer in the game with a power that HURTS him. Its simply not worth it.
---
Ive just explained how it bennefits him 4head.
---
Lol iri head, class photo, and prayer beads are the only add-ons that make my heart sink as survivor. I would rather an ebony mori any day.
---
Mori deez nutz
---
Interesting thanks
---
Ok thanks
---
So should I hook and then pursue someone else?
---
I said he sounds low tier. I‚Äôm more than willing to accept I am wrong.
---
Mori mori mori mori mori-ocho radiooo
---
Does that work well with huntress (my main and maybe you?
---
Alright, just making sure you didn't play legion or trapper. They are kinda really bad. Huntress is great. If you can, I suggest running bbq, but whispers and nurses are both quite good. Ruin slows the game down to prevent gen rush. Bbq let's you find a new survivor to go chase after a hook, so it sounds really good for you.
---
Mathieu is hot
---
True... Sometimes just trying to identify your friends in a 2SWF game can get confusing, but like this... Time to book it
---
Camping/Proxy because of new player, sure. But I doubt a rank 10 guy who hits someone on the hook for using a flashlight deems as "strategy".
---
lmao
---
And those benefits are not worth it. Having aura reading is not worth being literally unable to attack survives.
---
You're not going too believe this but I wasn't!
---
The tag on the post, maybe
---
This is wholesome I love this
---
yamoka doesnt have a lot of annoying loops so its fine
---
well butter my biscuits
---
Ive explained how freddy can use his transition phase to mindgame himself into a position where he can hit the survivor that other killers cant do.
---
Yep! Huntress is great at getting to a new survivor fast because she is ranged. If you want to learn how to learn how to play the game a bit better as killer, I suggest you look at some YouTube videos, monto is pretty good and does pretty much everything.
---
are you seriously so salty that you go to my unrelated comments and copy-paste what ive wrote before at me? get over it dude
---
And the leatherface has 2 braincells that it uses to facecamp
---
Really class photo? For me I get DESTROYED by pink trapper addons and tombstone Myers cause I'm a filthy killer main that is boosted af as surv.
---
I swap between them regularly :)
---
saying that MoM is op gets you swarmed in downvotes so
---
Fair enough, considering others on this subreddit lol
---
Im going to block you because you're just spamming all my comments with this because you're really mad
---
thanks! :D
---
it literally isn't but ok
---
If you‚Äôd like to play that way. 
---
Top 3 youtubers i would watch if I where you is 
---
Hybridpanda
---
True talent
---
And Monto.
---
For twitch I‚Äôd Recommend fungoose. 
---
Watching people play games have always made it more easy for me so maybe it will help you. Nothing wrong with YouTube guides.
---
Also Ardetha on YouTube he has videos of his fans that he criticizes to help them become better.
---
Ruin, BBQ, Spirit Fury, Enduring.
---
The thing is if a teammate is far away it would have just been quicker to use selfcare.
---
elaborate?
---
WAAAAAAAAAAZZZZAAAAAAAAAAP!
---
[https://ibb.co/6RD5nr2](https://ibb.co/6RD5nr2)
---
Here are some still renders I did showing the clapper and a couple of angles
---
Yep. Both of those things. As I said, people dislike sitting on a hook doing nothing, but they enjoy getting chased. If you get lost of chases and downs everyone has fun, and you will probably get a ggwp from most survivors, and pip with more BP
---
interesting so he is better than the $8 version? üòÇ
---
but perks / addons usually reset every match right? it is annoying spending all my money every match on maintenance basically.
---
Yep. 8$ version is good for camping anddddd that's pretty much it.
---
r/expectedthanos
---
If more people are playing killer than usual, it will increase the average wait time. For every 1 killer it takes 4x survivors, seems pretty straightforward.
---
Not sure what you mean
---
Just out messages to private
---
I mean like if you camp at that rank then you are probaly boosted
---
I swear they're actually monitoring every loading screen and randomly freezes some to cause chaos.
---
This is exactly why I have my Xbox set to friends only messaging. The worst I have to deal with is spammed party invites.
---
Add a little color to the beautiful whites of his eyes.
---
If you hover over an item, the description pops up.
---
The second page has unrelenting.
---
Maybe if you showed the emblem screen instead of the BP tally?
---
Letting them keep getting away with monetizing an already pay to play game is a bad idea
---
I thought they did. Was that near the beginning cause they also mentioned the dedicated servers near the beginning?

The problem with this is going to lie in the execution, which nobody knows about yet. The argument is made that it is an easy way to earn cosmetics (and potentially have the next pass pay for itself over time), but the real question is how much time is it going to take? How much time is BHVR going to require you to play the game to get a level, and how much are they going to charge you to skip those levels if you don't intend to or can't spend the time?
---
Instead of a flat transaction such as paying $10 for a skin, the battle pass mechanic will gate your time and potentially leave a player to spend $100 for ten skins. Sure, you spend more (time or money) AND you get more, but the question is, are you getting what you want and is it really worth it? We still need more information on what's going to be offered here.
---
But the head tilt is Mikey‚Äôs thing
---
Pretty good drawing to me. Did you try to do a specific Freddy makeup ?
---
Haha thank you.
---
This is an odd phenomenon since I can find games at rank 10 within a few seconds.
---
I‚Äôve gotten it a couple of times thanks to nurse‚Äôs calling. I think people tend to assume you‚Äôre chasing someone else so when Bubba revs up that chainsaw they don‚Äôt even flinch.
---
This. lol. Rank is based on your emblems.
---
Never heard of vision. Which perks/killers do it affect?
---
Ruin and BBQ of course. Nurse‚Äôs calling and sloppy butcher is a great combo to find survivors that got away or you let get away. Enduring and spirt fury is a good combo as well. I‚Äôd highly recommend surveillance or discordance. They‚Äôre great for knowing when to sneak back to gens.
---
Eh...Not everyone is capable of getting Altruism each game. I can recall a few where I wanted to unhook someone or heal someone but I was denied.
---
I read the description, I just don't get it because I'm a dumbass.
---
I thought about putting Mikey too but Wraith is puppy
---
I resent that as a Claudette main. I do the gens like everybody else(except when I accidentally potato and realize I've spent 5 minutes wandering around looking for Ruin and chests)
---
Now listen here you little shit...
---
So it's a console killer thing and not a killer thing in general?
---
Understandable, since I've always said that console players are far more toxic and uncivilized than PC players. 
---
I play PS4, so I can make that comment.
---
I have started restriction it to when I think everyone else will escape and I guess the match is more fun.
---
&gt;It was that game that reminded me why I'm a Killer Main.
---
To be fair, if you're a killer main you probably don't play survivor that much. Low rank survivors are absolutely trash (I say this as a survivor main).
---
This is true. At least one DC in most of my games.
---
Can someone send a link to his changes?
---
No way he‚Äôs super great when survivors sprint burst into a tree.
---
I mean, Freddy in general makes people smile.
---
Someone in another comment said you don't hear the woosh if you're in the terror radius. Never tried it though.
---
I mean, he can raise a fully grown adult by the throat, and completely resist any attempt at fighting back. He's definitely on the beefier side
---
this is disturbing
---
FYI that woosh sound only is heard outside of her terror radius. So there wouldn‚Äôt be any sound for this Claudette to go off of.
---
WAZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
---
Judging by the little information you gave us, it looks like she gave you the hatch. You also brought a shiny coin and had two chest perks. You would‚Äôve spent most of the game in one maybe two categories considering you were searching chests and got the hatch
---
this is probably the most cursed thing I‚Äôve created
---
Holy shit I never noticed my dudes damaged forehead. Makes a lot of sense
---
Nope. If you just use Killer to farm BP, then you're being economically efficient. I do it sometimes too. I get around 50K BP in one game as Clown with BBQ, and will dump it into a Survivor I need the Adept trophy for or just want to get their perks.
---
Take off noed and replace it with balanced landing.
---
Good to see people agree. The endgame chat was a bunch off "Well It works so its a tactic" and the typical "gg ez.
---
LOL
---
I thought the reply at the bottom was gonna day dead by daylight futanari
---
It takes you to the Gideon meat packing map
---
Right, good clarification. That's what makes mind games like this possible, because the TR doesn't move but you can't now if they're phasing either.
---
This thread is beautif- I mean WAZAAAAAAAAAAP?!
---
How would they even know youre a woman?

99% your heal. Now you dont suffer the penalty.

Ladies and gentlemen i give you...the death of DBD
---
Curse of the gamertag. Last year i spent 7.99 changing it to my name + trash. I regret that decision but im broke and cant afford to change it.
---
WAAZZUUUUUUPPP!!!
---
It's fun for me too, I get better at comebacks everytime
---
I have yet to get any PMs from the Killers when I do Survivor, but I get an occasional one from some Survivor who got shafted at some point. Or they just didn't like my load out. Or are just Neanderthals in general.
---
"You can't escape now" had me dying!
---
Which means?
---
Not really you just have to get better at everything and play with good enough killers. 
---
Beta killers are Nurse, Spirit and Billy. No that order as well. 
---
But a bunch of killers are great in general like Michael Myers. 
---
A good all around perk is Hex:Ruin which almost everyone runs and some people switch out Ruin for Pop goes the weasel or they run both.
---
To get multiple hooks means to get better at the game and split pressure. 
---
You want to apply pressure on more people not just the survivor you hooked so after hooking that survivor find another one. 
---
Barbecue and Chili helps out a lot for doing that. 
---
More pressure on others means less time on generators.
---
No noed pls
---
Thank you weeb man
---
Your forgot the teammate who DC'd
---
The end is really the only real time to do camping, assuming you are in a good spot to do it.
---
The point is every killer can end it or hit somone before 7 seconds, Freddy can't.
---
there's also people doing things in his face
---
It makes aura reading better
---
That was the most direct way of explaining it. You can't simplify it any more. It takes you to that map.
---
Yes Addons go away. I typically don‚Äôt play with addons much for that reason. But that‚Äôs why you find a main and spend a bunch of bp on them. This game is a grind machine. Perks don‚Äôt disappear unless you prestige but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre interested in prestiging.
---
It‚Äôs 3 ranks difference... what do you think there‚Äôs 100020 people playing
---
Yup... 2 matches with legion usually gets me over 110k and I'd rather do that than MAYBE get 30-50k in two matches as survivor. Hell, I get less than 15k in two matches because I die first to a camping Leatherface... Which literally happened to me today - wait times being like 5 - 10 mins made this even more annoying.
---
Survivors need a small bloodpoint buff imo. I feel like if you max a category in points you should get a 5k bonus. Would make being a distracter/runner less painful.
---
I think it‚Äôs more unfair to slug honestly. You‚Äôre basically trying to give last survivor no chance just for a sweaty 4k. Unless i‚Äôm going for adept killer i never do that. Plus it‚Äôs got to be very boring for the slug. Closing the hatch is already very killer sided. Even if the 3rd survivor is on death hook i‚Äôll always hook him because 90% of the time i find hatch and it‚Äôs very easy to pick off the last. I like to give him at least some chance unless they were a very toxic group.
---
Get better at everything? That is not easy
---
Level 35? Damn
---
Ohhhhhhh... see, told you I'm a total dumbass lol
---
Yea I was on DbD with some friends and we were doing some gens and I see my friend little get sucked out of the gen by a prayer bead spirit 
---
I just shited myself their in terror
---
I mean, there is nothing wrong with going back and making sure no-one is saving the other while you were across the map. Survivors are tricky - they call things which are not camping camping. I personally don‚Äôt consider it camping, but I guess others have other definitions.
---
About that...
---
WWWWAAAAAZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Mathieu is handsome af
---
Oink
---
The perk doesn't disappear. However if a hex perk has the corresponding totem cleansed (Best example of a Hex perk people always bitch about how fast it's gone is Hex: Ruin which basically slows generators down) the perk's effect is gone for the rest of the match. You don't lose perks. 
---
Note if you're running NOED, there has to be a dull totem remaining when gens are done. If you're running NOED by itself and all 5 dull totems are gone (or you're running another Hex ontop of NOED, and every other totem but your Hex is gone) NOED won't activate. Also, since NOED turns a dull totem lit, if it's cleansed you lose the effects of NOED for that match. 
---
I actually don't really use Hex perks that much, not even Ruin because of how fast they get cleansed when I'm killer. Of course when I'm survivor I've gotten 4-man Mori'd by Devour Hope more times than I can count or had Ruin stay till the very bitter end after I spent the ENTIRE MATCH looking for it. Just too much of a gamble for me to bank a perk slot on.
---
no i really thought it was all points based, and so were emblems, based off of those, this system is actually terrible if that is the case, can be manipulated so hard. They should really give direct threshold for what rank is determined off of, like 22k=x 26k=y 30+k=z, actually terrible if thats the case, cause there is no way to really tell who is manipulating the system or not...
---
Everything is part of the game, all the op shit survivors use are part of the game the same way Nurse, Spirit, Legion and Plague are part of it, special add ons are rare and costly to use and so are offerings.
---
Everyone, survivors and killers need to get off their horse and realize no one is hot shit and sometimes games aren‚Äôt fun. As someone who plays a lot of Overwatch and DBD I can tell you we should be grateful because DBD at it‚Äôs worse is still a lot better than your average OW game, this could be much worse and the dev team is actually decent at dealing with OP shit.
---
Switch dying light for noed. Most times the obsession will go immersed since they know you have it.
---
Wait, doesn't this mean he'll be a straight upgrade to Doc then?
---
Thanks
---
No single other rank system that I have ever played off of works without a breakdown based off of points or some other factor that is easily recognizable... Pretty sketchy...
---
Let *me* suggest that you stop bitching over a perk that basically nobody ever uses.
---
Aww I remember being a new player. So wholesome, so scared.
---
But the clown has finger less gloves and looking at that shot from the trailer the clothes don't look the same
---
that's weeb sir to you
---
If the survivors bring 4 flashlights then what defense does the killer have? Yeah, Lightborn exists but even then, if 1 survivor goes down and it‚Äôs a SWF, then the other 3 can shine their light and still blind the killer. 
---
Its really just the case of you being a salty survivor main. Like, sorry to be upfront but it‚Äôs an okay perk.
---
Or if the survivors bring 4 toolboxes, then wtf are you gonna do? Either your gens will pop in 10 seconds or your hooks all get teleported to the underworld.
---
Or how about 4 medkits? Say goodbye to your hooks. No point in even downing survivors when they all have 4 instant-medkits.
---
Very cute
---
I have no idea where totems or anything is. I just play for fun whether i win or lose. Dont get mad at me, im not gonna play off a script. Imma just play.
---
I'm a killer main, admittedly, but I sometimes prefer survivor. Playing killer gives me a ton of anxiety and there's no one to ease that. When I play with friends it's fun and scary but I don't get anxious.
---
emblem screen was 2gold 1 red and 1 silver
---
Whats wrong with my boi ;c
---
My hope will never die
---
Dancing Mathieu cosplay in three two o........
---
As a survivor, you can use an item down to 1%, escape with it and reuse it over and over. And you bitch about a perk that is seldom used?
---
How about killers start bitching about survivors losing their items/addons *every* game like they do?
---
totally gave me the hatch at the end, but i was still 3k above the other highest survivor, how the fuck is that not a rank up?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt run Nurse‚Äôs on him as his strength comes from his instadowns. Spirit Fury is very popular on him though, especially with Enduring once you unlock it. Can you post a picture of your current perks on him?
---
Your the reason why I use it, it pisses you survivors off, plus I love how frantic you guys get when you realize you dropped your item.
---
Yeah we know
---
My team got franklined 3 times in a row last night... so shut up
---
Oh *thaaaat's* why she shwacks me everytime!!!
---
FUCK do I hate The Spirit!
---
I don't have Franklin's yet. (Been on the receiving end a few times. It's actually seemingly pretty rare to see it.) I'd imagine the main use is if you see shit like 4 survivors all with medkits, toolboxes, and flashlights.
---
Consider that there's not enough ways to really "counter" item usage and Overwhelming Presence IIRC is one of the least used perks in the game considering how easy it is to counter (Stop using items when in terror radius, the game even tells you when they have it) and the rather underwhelming (pun not intended) effect it has. Franklin's feels like the only way to get flashlights and insta-heals out of survivors hands.
---
You're just being ignorant if you don't think moris give an unfair advantage because that's what they're intended to do. Of course you're going to escape sometimes Mori or not. And this game has been out for 3 years. You don't think the veteran players are stocked up on Moris? Ive seen streams with people who have 60+ ebony moris  on almost all the killers. You sound like you never play survivor if you haven't felted cheated out by a Mori lol
---
Botany knowledge op
---
They made him better for *Survivors*. His core advantage was mobility and now he's so slow it's basically a direct downgrade to Nurse since you can't even down them in that case. Bleedout is literally useless considering the timer pauses inside the TR. Once you're hit with Frenzy, all chase tension goes away because he has to end his power and stun himself to even have the chance to down you, on the off chance you don't loop him to death because he can no longer apply pressure.
---
Legion is only better than Freddy. And with the rework, he will officially and unanimously be the worst Killer in the game.
---
As far as i know either the entity or the survivors can modify their body at will, david always has his lion and rose tatoo but can add more with that vest cosmetic
---
I don't give a shit about your team and I'll talk as much as I like.
---
Why not B O T H ?
---
Well it seems like that knowledge would make most of people's argument here irrelevant.
---
u/walkthroughthepicness please tell this person the song name
---
Um yes you did. Next time you think about whether or not you‚Äôre camping just think to yourself, am I on the map? If yes then you‚Äôre camping
---
I sound you sound like, not are. Learn what an assumption is dipshit.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I'm trying to practice it on PS4 xD hard asf
---
Jeff is S tier üó°
---
I get that a few times. Usually I have to do it twice.
---
Learn English. What you said literally made no sense lmao
---
You are absolute dipshit
---
Sorry you're too stupid to comprehend. Maybe repeat elementary school?
---
That‚Äôs called bad luck.
---
I‚Äôm quite new to the game, only have about 13 hours, but I‚Äôve still yet to see franklins once.
---
My point is, we shouldn‚Äôt assume that because something is the case for us, it‚Äôs the case for everybody.
---
nobody said they are the worst, it's that they are not the best and it clearly shows in their actions and communication. and to circle back: checking their past you really really think they want to only sell 1 battlepass and the others will be buyable ingame with the shards-whatever? no way they will do this. they are actually worse than pubg on the money front (i compare the 2 games because pubg is not f2p either), because bhe releases dlcs on top of the skins and battle pass.
---
Oh fuck so im toxic? I should leave the game as soon as i enter to not be considered toxic, right?
---
except for the reasons i explained, saying "point is everyone can" doesn't just make it true.
---
Oh yes because some idiot troll on the internet can't type in proper English and make cohesive sentences I should go back to elementary school lmao do you even listen to yourself? You're a literal 4head
---
Funny. That‚Äôs what y‚Äôall say about literally any perks for survivors then want to argue that noed is just fine lmao
---
Getting caught in Clowns gas puts you down one health state.
---
He just could have said "I'm a killer main"
---
By the time you expose a survivor they can be 16m away which will take you around 25 seconds to catch up with a 115% movement speed and that's not taking into account perks like sprint burst or how far away you were
---
so far he seems like Myres with less stealth but we will have to wait and see
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was. wondering. Because if I‚Äôm just paying normal tax fuck that. But if this is just because of the arrangement they had to make to this I‚Äôll buy it.
---
Definitely Bond. By far, my favorite solo perk as the map awareness is invaluable.
---
I survivor solo 99% of the time and run Bond, Balanced Landing (or some exhaustion perk), Kindred, and then something specific to how I feel like playing. Typically, that comes down to Prove Thyself, We‚Äôll Make It, or Small Game. 
---
Pharmacy is also a common choice when I‚Äôm running low on Medkits and want to stock up.
---
Holy
---
But it does. Your also ignoring the fact Freddy can't stop anything.
---
Why do you think he's considered the worst killer by most? Your arugehts are not valid because your pretending he doesn't have to wait when every other killer doesn't
---

Talks about proper English, calls someone 4head. Good logic. I spoke in clear and cohesive English. Ask literally anyone to explain it to you, because again - you are the one lacking comprehension here. Chow!

Wow you must have tons of friends

---
I was gonna write an angry comment at the first sentence, then I realized it was a joke, and found it hilarious.
---
wait until the pig skins come out then she will be s tier
---
Which character?
---
Unless another survivor does while you‚Äôre still in a chase
---
Well 4head has actual context so it makes sense to anyone who goes on twitch and if you don't oh well. You didn't speak you typed if we're getting into the semantics of it :} lmfao
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
Weren't ultra rare items/addons meant to be... you know, rare?
---
*its
---
Atleast im not camping a hook. I let them unhook eachother as often as they please lmao
---
Uh correction the crows are bae.
---
Which is honestly kinda dumb and why we need a steam workshop for this game already.
---
Also, EAC support staff is awful. They never respond.
---
Yeah... so?
---
Edit: imma stop being an asshole for no reason good job on getting an insta heal
---
I want you to look me straight in the eyes and tell me that Myers would blink either. Two reasons why:
---
1. Psychopaths are known to blink less.
---
2. You gonna look Myers in the eyes?
---
3. According to both movies he really doesn't have them anymore.
---
4. He does in the game but ignore that
---
5. oh god i can hear him right behind me oh fuck i just heard the halloween music oh fuck
---
*Mettle
---
You're working on a generator.
---
You see him out of the corner of your eye.
---
*Leatherface running at you full speed flailing the chainsaw and making horrible noises*
---
Who needs a terror radius with that
---
Did yea farm someone. That‚Äôs a insta depip
---
Ruin, NOED, bitter murmur, whispers.
---
Not ideal, but this would be my picks with what you have.
---
The last two are good for tracking which really comes in handy when you pop tier 3 and need to find people.
---
I agree! Plus they had that green mossy looking skin too.
---
I love it! üòç
---
I don't know why people enjoy this but it was frustrating to get these messages while I was playing
---
I always played against purple ranks when I was rank 14
---
I think he's ever so slightly taking the piss, OP.
---
I certainly *hope* so.
---
XD
---
People use Freddy in red ranks ü§Øü§Øü§Ø
---
You gotta catch me firstüòè... Just like all those other countless people who have done exactly that lol. If you want to stand there looking at me instead of playing smart please do. If I have any team left standing I‚Äôll even struggle as long as possible. I just hope my team is smart enough to not all rush the hook and actually make it a decent strategy üòÇ
---
If the killer doesn't have the prompt to do both in front of a locker, that's broken and needs to be fixed.
---
Did it last the whole game?
---
Ok dude.. ya lame
---
I've had one worst than this but it's been a while since I got a survivor like this
---
That's the thing tho, I wasn't really trying to slug. With three people alive, I went to go check on the missed skill check. The other guy had a RTB on his head and he didnt get it off in time, so he died while I was chasing the person who missed the skillcheck.
---
It‚Äôs been awhile since I got the Evil Incarnate trophy so maybe I‚Äôm forgetting how long it really took me.  I was in like a 3 month break from the game and I‚Äôm just catching up on some trophies I missed and I‚Äôve gotten one wiggle off from rank 14 to 8.
---
I usually get the generic "NOED CAMPER NOOB"
---
Well it's true
---
Username checks out I guess
---
The irony of complaining about a lack of counter to Franklin's Demise while completely ignoring the lack of counter to keys other than Franklin's Demise.
---
Lmao yes I have. I don‚Äôt think it would be too much like that though because of the proximity chat. If you ever played that Friday the 13th game I think it‚Äôd be more like that. And that was one of the funniest game chats out there lol
---
Yeah I hear ya, it‚Äôs been awhile since I did the trophies for Halloween Dlc, so I‚Äôm probably forgetful of the frustration on that trophy. 
---
I wish I would get a killer that gave wiggle offs, I guess it‚Äôs just a matter of time.
---
anyone know this steamers name? I can‚Äôt read for shit
---
The issue with Evil Incarnate is that you're hoping that all 4 survivors will play nice. They could easily derail a perfect game by jumping in lockers as you try to chase them, or even DC.8
---
Well... haha it‚Äôs a pretty toxic build that slows the game down... just a little bit. And allows me to grab players off my hex‚Äôs which is extremely satisfying. But I don‚Äôt run that normally.... I swear I‚Äôm a decent human being..ü•∫
---
His terror radius better be wild Latin trumpets.
---
I don't take NOED (maybe on Freddy) but I was trying to be nice and didn't take ruin either
---
Lol the match I finally got it was from a survivor standing on the hatch, he said he forgot I could insta kill him with a grab and he was going to wait for me to hit so he could crawl in.
---
I wasn't slugging for the 4k. The 3rd person was alive and when I left the guy on the ground to see the missed skill check (to deny the gen getting done), I started chasing the person who missed the skillcheck. During that time the 3rd guys RTB went off and he died. In my eyes Im just playing the game as I see it. Dont take the extra x amount of time to pick up and find a hook, but go deny the last gen getting complete.
---
Meh. Most people are probably disappointed by my stream. Haha.
---
Y'see, I rarely ever take NOED either. I also never camp unless it makes sense too. Survivors, am I right?
---
Gotta love that term "free escape". I figured after the hatch update people would stop crying over "free escapes" but it's seems now people are gonna direct that anger at keys now.
---
There are multiple parcels across all maps that generate in a way that facilitates infinite looping i.e. they can run around them FOREVER with the exception being they will eventually be caught by bloodlust 3. A good example is the double T window juketown where survivors can just loop around one T until the window is blocked by the entity and then move 5 feet to the other T and repeat. By the time the 2nd window is blocked, the 1st is unblocked and since bamboozle only blocks 1 window at a time it doesn't help.
---
Nobody minds getting run across the map through pallets and whatnot. If survivors are consuming resources (pallets, cooldowns, items) to extend their chases that is good. If survivors are capable of extending chases without using any resources then it's a problem. Much like if a killer is getting kills without expending their resources (offerings, generator progress, bloodlust) it's a problem.
---
It's not Killers vs Survivors, it's Players vs Game Mechanics

I honestly fully fail to see any resemblance at all this meme is so weak it hurts
---
You misinterpreted ‚Äúfree escape‚Äù as anger. Go be a shitter somewhere else. You‚Äôve added nothing to this.
---
I‚Äôd never heard the highest ranked nurse thing
---
I can understand that sometimes it seems like killers are camping but it's your teammates fault for trying to loop me right in front of you.
---
I think it's Ash talking
---
Ohhh which perks or addons would make the effect? I know Legion Pin(one of thm) does blindness but i don‚Äôt know what does vision.
---
Thank you. I didnt know this :)
---
It‚Äôs Ash.
---
It happens to me on PS4. Its Ash‚Äôs sometimes you‚Äôll hear him say stuffy and he won‚Äôt be in the lobby.
---
A 4 flashlight squad counters themselves. After downing someone, just look around if you suspect a flashlight save. I've seen many 4ks because people were being too altruistic with flashlights. You can also look at a wall a lot of the time. And did you forget about Infectious Fright?
---
I would argue that a nurse with 5 blinks is easily as overpowered as a squad with 4 instant heals, but that's subjective.
---
Imagine.. üòπ
---
Breaking news, Freddy surpassed Nurse. Further reports show that Myers and Pig created Ghostface, their beloved child. More reports show shirtless Myers will be added.
---
No problem!
---
&gt;Nobody uses it!!!
---
This is not an argument.
---
Eventually Twitch Chat stopped thinking
---
This is every large twitch stream to be honest. They are just impossible to follow because of how fast they are, so they spew whatever nonsense they can to get attention. Only chats that were remotely less toxic was Twitch Plays Pokemon and the Yu-gi-oh twitch chat.
---
I agree. Plus, we gotta keep in mind that once any survivor/killer has reached top level, the blood web tends to give more ultra rare items too. So it's a cool way to just collect hella items.
---
They never really started
---
I totally agree with you which why I‚Äôm so curious. That would be OP ammo for SWF.
---
kinda, yes
---
I agree
---
I've had it happen to me 3 times already. It's unplayable!
---
Makes tons of sense. Thanks again.
---
Yeah you could look at a wall, but what about open maps like Coldwind, where the only loops are Killer Shack and Meat Tree
---
With killer shack, you‚Äôre 9 times out of 10 going to get down after vaulting the window, or a failed pallet spam attempt.
---
And yes, infectious fright could work, but even then if there are 3 survivors around you, you‚Äôre gonna have to go after 1 of them, making it to where the other 2 are picking the downed player up.
---
Did you make him a killer or a survivor?
---
Nice work! 
---
I absolutely love the texture you‚Äôve made. (:
---
Survivors within range of the Wailing Bell sound are deafened for the remainder of the Trial.
---
but higher rank survivors just disconnect as soon as they are hit once because they think they are too good for that or something
---
I agree that there is a lack of counter to keys aside from Franklin's. I still think Franklin's is the worst possible solution to the problem, and I argue it creates more issues than it solves.
---
You're right, it's not an argument. It's a fact. Gold star for getting all of your brain cells together to figure that out.
---
You should put 115% into it. Legions get to do that now. ;)
---
How does Insidious work on Spirit and phasing?
---
twitch.tv/not_ryu, posted in comment above
---
WAZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUP
---
Every god damn time
---
You mean the ‚ÄúCutting Out‚Äù trophy? Meh. It was difficult. How I got it was I would sabo hooks on a certain side of a map, sprint to the corner on that side, and run object of obsession so the killer could see me. Let him down you, and just wiggle out while he carries. Just gotta hope he doesn‚Äôt have iron grasp, agitation, Mad grit. Of course you‚Äôll get a lot of shit from your teammates but no great loss
---
Why didn‚Äôt I think of that... I‚Äôll just be running away at 4.6 m/s from the realization that I could‚Äôve made that reference.
---
Prayer Beads, disgusting.
---
Lol I‚Äôll have to try that I‚Äôm getting no where.  I‚Äôve gotten 1 wiggle from  rank 14-8
---
Cry about it
---
I feel like left brained society just isn't for us.
---
Thank you so much! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
---
Yes
---
Its being rarely used is completely irrelevant to my entire argument. And I don't understand your false equivalence. Yes, there is more than one problem in this game. How does killers losing their addons (I don't know why you said items), relate to this problem? Unless you see a solution, what's the use in mentioning it? Just blatant whataboutism.
---
oh god I hate people like that
---
thanks for bein cool
---
Twitch chat rejected their intelligence a long time ago
---
I can't play Freddy as survivor though
---
This has gotta be a joke right?
---
I never use that perk lol
---
No problem. I could also tell you about madness if you don‚Äôt already know about that
---
I dont see a problem with grinding, i never played killer until 4 days ago, i didnt have any teachable perks and the highest level killer i had was clown level 10. After 4 days i managed to unlock the teachables for the hag, the cannibal, and ill unlock the teachable for the shape soon. Those perks are enough to get me started with the spirit since shes my favorite.
---
Yes, sadly Killer lacks the *thrill* of sitting in a single spot and pressing spacebar every few seconds.
---
I need to get me pharmacy so that I can get green medkits. I hoard with plunders and have over 25 smelly keys and 18 purple flashlights but I always seem lacking in green medkits
---
*Yoink*
---
Guys, stop falling for the troll
---
I dont see a problem with grinding, i never played killer until 3 days ago, i didnt have any teachable perks and the highest level killer i had was clown level 10. After 4 days i managed to unlock the teachables for the hag, the cannibal, and ill unlock the teachable for the shape soon. Those perks are enough to get me started with the spirit since shes my favorite.
---
Sarcasm is very difficult and obviously your forte.
---
I like the legion, but he is pretty much a standard M1 killer most of the time.
---
So my suggestion, wait and get Ghostface.
---
S T O P  I M M E D I A T E L Y
---
It's one of the annoying perks to me to play against but as much as I dislike it I think it's fine how it is.
---
something more original
---
I'm so excited for lore expansion man
---
Well thank god his worthless ass was here to show us all how little he cares.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm just bad at the stealth aspect of the game but I feel after rank 12 it‚Äôs all about who can loop the killer the longest and less about stealth
---
*Shitpost* my friend **SHITPOST**
---
You're not wrong. Even though Claudette guessed correctly that she wasn't phasing, you still have to completely guess *when* she starts phasing. There's no way anybody would've known the killer was standing there the whole entire time. 
---
Spirit gains so much leverage from just standing still. If any other killer vaults an L-Wall, they're kind of a dumbass. When a Spirit does it, there's not really a safe play because she could be faking it. Standing still is such a shitty mindgame.
---
I believe the two perks you listed are somewhat intended to be used together. 
---
Furtive Chase reduces your terror radius while in a chase, so, it's harder for survivors you're chasing to juke you out because their aura is revealed by I'm All Ears.
---
Wait I thought there needs to be 2 gens done for the hatch to spawn for one player? I know update means it's always open when it spawns endgame
---
Tell him to fuck himself. Or my personal favorite: "haha you died". Really shits em up.
---
Also, nah that's not camping.
---
^^dead ^^men ^^tell ^^no ^^tales
---
I literally had a survivor today tell me I was using ‚Äútraining wheels,‚Äù and honestly don‚Äôt know what he was referring to, Billy maybe? Ofc he was using DS, BL, Borrowed, Adrenaline with an insta-heal medkit, not even kidding
---
It's true there's almost no way to counter perks depending on the perk. Whispers has no counter. The only counter to Mettle Of Man is to tunnel with a Mori or facecamp if you're an M1 killer. 
---
I don't see Franklin's as an issue. Sucks you lost your item. Maybe White Ward should be changed to protect you if the item is used up or knocked out of your hands with Franklin's though.
---
Oh god, the killer securing a kill is unfair now.
---
Here's some advice for people who don't like to get slugged - stop planting your dicks in the dirt.
---
so let me break it down 8k=obj 5k=surv, how much do we need to make 25k after that... 12k is missing, right? so that means about 6k in boldness and 6k in altruism... why would i lose a rank point??? final points were roughly S=5k O=8k A=6k B=6k
---
No blink nurse?
---
You will soon know that the power of my [Twitch Mod] is to indeed mod twitch
---
I thought Fortnite already does it. I don't play Fortnite so I'm not sure. I think crossplay is generally a positive thing for games. It's annoying that friends and I have the same game and can not play together because we have different platforms.
---
The English only please was them mocking the devs because they have a English only chat rule yet had non English speaking people on during the stream
---
the detection of the system is flawed, because there is no way to evaluate from a user perspective whether there was a miscalculation...
---
You doing Road to El Dorado memes?  If so, I am all for this
---
Yes, I never said looking at a wall works every time. Actually, I explicitly said "a lot of the time", so in your first sentence you're not really disagreeing with anything I said.
---
I think I'm just stupid, but not sure how the killer shack relates to what we were talking about?
---
If there's 3 survivors around you after downing someone, I would assume you're probably going to win that game, seeing as they're busy being altruistic and not doing objectives. Additionally, it's very easy to scare off survivors and then pick up the downed survivor in a way that makes it impossible for them to reach you in time.
---
You haven't really addressed 90% of what I said in my reply, though?
---
Test it :)
---
He‚Äôs not toxic literally at all. He actually does a pretty good job at keeping his cool *despite* people being toxic towards him. 
---
A lot of people don‚Äôt like him because he has a massive ego and he gets really butthurt about losses sometimes. Personally he‚Äôs one of my favorite streamers, though
---
Absolutely. Nobody makes the correct decision 100% of the time. There are a lot of things I did in my early 20's that I absolutely regret now. However, that still doesn't negate the fact that as you get older you tend to make wiser choices.
---
No matter how much I tell myself I won‚Äôt fall for Spirits mindgames... I always end up falling for them.
---
That they can get out of within 15 seconds as soon as you stop chasing them.
---
...who‚Äôs side are you on?
---
Sure, but I still think the grind is far too large regardless. It still needs to be reduced at least somewhat. You don't have to have all of the perks and best addons, etc, of course I know that. But that doesn't take away from the ridiculous amount of time and effort it takes just to be able to use a perk on a character that you got from another character. Maybe instead of two perks per bloodweb or perk level tier reductions, they could do guaranteed perks so you could choose what to get? That might make it easier to bear.
---
You have some points, but I really feel like I'm not in the wrong here and I've read a lot of similar opinions on this subreddit and other places. The grind is just too much, it needs to be reduced by a significant amount, or at least the RNG of it so player choice is a bigger deal than how it is right now.
---
I hate playing when there is a blood hunt because every Toxic Killer decides that it's mori time when you bring out the BPS.

---
How could we forget?!
---
Pig main best main
---
Nope. With the EGC update, the Hatch was changed so that it will spawn as soon as only one Survivor remains.
---
It was done that way to prevent the last Survivor from just hiding and drawing out the game because they had no way to Escape.
---
Now either they find the Hatch first and leave, or the Killer finds it first and starts the EGC timer.
---
I hate that. I always see if they want to farm first. Even if they don't if they all or most use bps I'll only hook them twice.
---
I think its also important to specify that if the player is within your terror radius, they don't hear the woosh of the spirit while phase shifting, making it easier to mind game.
---
I mostly play solo survivor. If it‚Äôs me &amp; one other person left and the killer slugs me trying to secure his 4k, I will dc and move onto the next game. I won‚Äôt allow a killer to waste my time just because 3 kills isn‚Äôt good enough for them ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
But things can be more fun if they get changed. Everyone hated legion, and it was made known enough that the devs actually changed the game for the better.
---
Time wasted and a gen regressed.
---
I'll take all the downvotes, I'm not alone in these opinions anyways.
---
Its ok, survivors are SUPPOSED to be busted to hell. Killers using things that similarly advantage them is messed up tho, how dare you?

---
I think it would be fine if it had some sort of counter. The risk you assume when bringing an item in a trial includes the possibility of dying and losing it, but you can actively counter that depending on how well you play. This trait is not present with Franklin's.
---
You can also charge the ability to trigger the transition sound and leave when they vault
---
Oh okay. Yeah I'm a killer main and cant play survivor well because I'm too scared. That information is good to know although I dont play survivor anymore. Couldn't do that to my team.
---
Hi Ochido
---
Why are people annoyed
---
Ironically, I played against a novice Hag who ran all three of her perks, and the only one I couldn't find was Third Seal. It was awful.
---
I really think their point is that the salty trash screeching about Moris is certainly not avoiding any of the great options survivors have. Hypocrisy is really bad when its just a game in the first place, and people like this belong in memes more than reality.
---
Well yeah, every opinion has other people who agree. Doesn't mean they're good opinions.
---
All of my Freddy perks magically disappeared. Any help?
---
Agreed. Before watching him I considered Tofu/Monto to be top tier and while they‚Äôre insanely good I‚Äôd say Tru3 a little bit higher.
---
You should get Gatekeeper points when you kick a gen and for regression time.
---
BM
---
The MoM nerf can‚Äôt come soon enough lmao
---
Because 4 instaheals ontop of mettle of man is bullshit. 
---
Even certain killer addons have counters. Lockers counter tombstone Myers. Windows of Opportunity counter Doctor (and probably rework freddy) fake pallets. 
---
The only other cheesy thing I see about Franklins is if you have a firecracker or item without durability, since Franklins removes some durability, it's flat out deleted when you get hit.
---
That's literally what this perk is. It's a "fuck you" perk. I love using it when people bring Keys and Maps.
---
I'd say doctor, leigon or cannibal
---
And a nys ded‚Äôard to you too!
---
pixiv dbd art is best &lt;3

WAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZUUUUUUUPPPPP
---
What a sad child.
---
You can be across the map, and seen only with OoO and still be called a camper.
---
1. Sounds like you like a virtual item a little too much.
---
2. Remember that the Killer could be running a meta perk like Sloppy, BBQ, Nurse‚Äôs, NOED, Ruin, or Enduring+Spirit Fury. 
---
3. It counters the stupidity of keys.
---
I hate it too. Especially when they Tbag. Pisses me off. 
---
Like, I get it, you were toxic but it is really just a time waster!

Can someone tell me what they are doing to him ???
---
I want everyone to have fun, and an ebony mori is so unfun for 4/5 players that it shouldn't be in the game. Just like dealing with MoM isn't fun, and old DS wasn't fun. There are a lot of survivor and killer perks/items that are not healthy for this game and everyone playing to have fun, and Ebony moris are definitely one of them.
---
By effort I mean playing in the specific match, not the amount of hours you have in the game. Like how Mettle of Man is a bullshit perk because you just have to get by a normal attack three times. It's upsetting that they nerfed Brand New Parts, which deserved the nerf, but then didn't change other things that greatly changed how the game was played. 
---
While I dislike Moris it's fine that they are in the game, but ebony's are too strong right now.
---
wtf did I just read
---
Where the hell do you get I want things for free? I don‚Äôt want skins at all personally and don‚Äôt think it should be a priority in any way. However other people want them and that‚Äôs fine for them to be made and available for purchase. I have zero problem with other things costing money I simply won‚Äôt buy them. I have a problem with this being a focus of their investment and also it does affect the player base as new players will be less interested. If it is skins only then cool, idc, I still want them to focus on other things. Skins should never be a priority when the game is broken, maybe we would‚Äôve had all these reworks and dedicated servers faster if this battle pass wasn‚Äôt being worked on yet. Yea I‚Äôm aware it isn‚Äôt the same people, but the money and resources being spent to make it could‚Äôve gone to more people fixing the game and reworking maps, characters, and loops. I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs pay to win, however it is pay to skip the grind. How in the fuck would that make a new player who only wants to pay for the base game feel? They have to work harder and get less than others coz they can‚Äôt afford it? It‚Äôs not a free game it shouldn‚Äôt be implemented if that‚Äôs the case. This will not bring new players stop saying that. It‚Äôs already deterring veteran players.
---
I've never known anyone in this game to have that level of awareness. Instead you're far more likely to have them send you three paragraphs on how it means you (as the killer) actually don't know how to play the game.
---
*"Meta" of Man.
---
I heard this
---
Drew Ghostface's Face
---
Blackmail?
---
Protection hits are hard to get, Killers don't slug often and its also hard to get three unhooks.
---
Exactly!
---
Spirit is one of the best killers for mindgaming as spirit can ‚Äúphase‚Äù and when she does this she goes invisible, but can‚Äôt see survivors, however she leaves a copy of herself, so basically the Claudette thought the killer was actually just a clone, and was trying to juke the killer, but the player here tricked her into jumping straight into his/her arms
---
Insta Blind used to also be an Ebony add on for flashlight but devs removed it because that shit was so unfun and overpowered to go against.
---
I mean in general i want saved before the other person gets hooked cuz its only logical to go back and try to get someone on the way to the first one if we in swf and we failed to save before the other person is hooked usually try to unhook the second person first since theres a 99% chance you go check the first guy as it just makes sense
---
It makes it even worse when I‚Äôm already in a bad mood! (I have anger issues so I just kinda snap haha)
---
I know, it's just something I'd like to know
---
Got real greedy there love
---
I‚Äôm honestly surprised she turned around after running so far away
---

Your rank plays a part in it. Also, peak times are very real on PS4. I was finding matches all night without a problem until about an hour ago. If you play solo, wait times tend to be shorter too.
---
Yeah right now it's a problem cause of Brutal Strength and Bamboozle. I don't think the debs would want it to eclipse either of those... "Specialty" perks while Fire Up is a blanket efficiency.
---
However, even though it sounds kinda "OP" and *maybe* nullify BS or BB, it wouldn't hurt to try Fire Up at like 20% or around that value. Maybe even change what it affects? Like say remove its effect for Gen Breaking but keep the pallet breaking to make BS a better overall timer reducer during the whole game? Idk.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie teaching a friend how to play is one of the most stressful things ever. Teaching them how to break chase and delay downs while making sure they‚Äôre repairing gens when not stalling the killer, all while trying to actually avoid the killer to keep from getting slaughtered
---
this is like complaining about quick and quiet or stake out
---
Omg fuck. Like, dude.
---
My new mixtape about to drop its called "Fuck M. O. M."
---
Hell just make it so if you get gassed u get insta downed if hit within 15 seconds
---
Account less than an hour old: check
---
It‚Äôs not even a good attempt at satire.
---
Oh ty it‚Äôs scaring me
---
Man this actually work I've done it a lot when I first got spirit lol
---
I get it's unfair for you but every game you play is just an absolute shitty game and unfair for the rest of survivors. I cant control what you do and I know you'll keep playing killer. 
---
And how does it not ruin anything? Bad ping ruins games for survivors it takes 2 seconds to drop a pallet, they're clutching everywhere its terrible.
---
Players unite!
---
I‚Äôm always angry, it‚Äôs my default mood.
---
Hmm if someone wants me to get something it's from their checkbook.
---
**Forever Exposed Myers**
---
- Play as Michael Myers.
---
- Your perks are MYC, Iron Maiden, NOED, and Haunted Grounds, Devour Hope, or Rancor.
---
- For the maximum memeiness, run Fragrant Tuft of Hair with these perks.
---
**Obsessed Boyfriend/Girlfriend**
---
- Any Killer works.
---
- Run only Obsession perks.
---
- Find your Obsession and follow them constantly. You can't hit them or hurt them, only follow them.
---
- If another Survivor gets close too to your Obsession you have to attack them. You can down them but not hook them.
---
- You cannot let your Obsession out of your sight.
---
**Ginosaji**
---
- Play as Legion without add-ons.
---
- Run PWYF, Distressing, and Remember Me as well as one other perk of your choice.
---
- Find your Obsession and chase only them.
---
- You can only attack them in Frenzy Mode and you CANNOT pick them up, hook them, grab them, or pull them out of a locker.
---
- You also cannot attack or interact with any other Survivors unless your Obsession DCs. If they do DC you must choose a new 'Obsession' and attack only them as you did the first Obsession.
---
- Ideally this meme build will have you stabbing a Survivor in Feral Frenzy as they just go about their business pretending you aren't even there.
---
Hope you like these. &lt;3
---
just because he has a sugar daddy who pays everything for him
---
*insert pigs stun noise and the fastest heartbeat known to man kind*
---
Everything is toxic unless you let the survivors destroy you
---
Bad manners
---
Leatherface, insidious, noed, wait around the door, and profit lol
---
Ah yes I‚Äôve seen that. Sadly I don‚Äôt have insidious on Bubba yet :‚Äô(
---
Thanla for explaining and not being a dick.
---
It's very easy to get each of these during a game. Very easy. Even if no slugging. 2 unhooks are not hard, neither are protection hits.
---
I'm sure you're *very familiar* with how high ranks are as Killer but I'll tell you how it goes. You hook someone, you immediately run to find new survivors, you do not stay at the hook. A few very short moments after your TR is not on the hook, I guarantee that the survivor will probably be saved = Instead safe hook, for free. 
---
Any time that you pick up someone and a survivor is near, they typically block to try to bait hits/swings, you will be forced into hitting them, at least 2-3 per game. Many more if you're against an SWF = EZ Protection stacks.
---
People already "suicide" themselves for WGLF stacks. I am pretty sure they will for an extra free hit. 
---
This all adds up and trust me, it will.
---
I almost strictly play survivor, but I got my moments when I want to play the ultimate meme build lol
---
unf
---
Hell man that‚Äôs pretty good. Better then anything I could do.
---
No problem my dude. Knowledge is power.
---
Why so many people running STBFL. I've seen it way more than usual the past couple days.
---
Good thing I don't trust you then.
---
Idk I‚Äôve been running it since Myers dropped but I have been seeing it a lot. I especially enjoy it on Clown.
---
Inb4 killer main backlash
---
Got the  screenshots?
---
Well this turned more controversial then I thought it would
---
I turned off messages on Xbox because there are so many of these idiots floating around out there.
---
I think its because Kate's name was found in the files when the leatherface dlc was released or something like that (I might be wrong)
---
How?
---
*facepalm* maybe if you use google in more detail like "what does bm mean in gaming"
---
Most people want to "win" and you have the most difficulty doing so with Freddy. Infact, you typically always get stomped on when you play Freddy so people don't touch him. That can explain one facet of hate.
---
The second is typically done by newer survivors, including myself. When i was new, I did a post asking what to do against Freddy because I don't know what to do etc etc, and I think I called him OP, can't remember. Anyway, for newer survivors, he's infuriating to play against, he's pretty much always invisible, he always knows where you are if he has the right setup in Dream State, and honestly, it was really infuriating for me when I started. 
---
Now is a different matter entirely, but that's why he's hated, unless others have any other reason(s).
---
Selfcare and Sprint Burst are garbage.
---
But keys and moris should be removed from the game.
---
1. Cool
---
2. Losing a game =/= losing 25k bloodpoints
---
3. I know that
---
I like running it with Rancor because its really fun to just completely ignore the obsession all game then insta-kill them at the very end.
---
because it‚Äôs a stupid complaint
---
Been there. Some killers just don't leave. It's like WTH dude. Leave already...
---
This is why only my friends can message me on PSN.
---
It's showed up in a few recent Monto videos.  That's my guess anyway
---
They buffed the bejesus out of Hag's baseline trap setting speed, made her lunge better, made it easier to teleport to traps baseline.
---
You can stop and drop traps midchase without losing the chase, it's crazy. She's still really hard to play (not nearly as broken as Nurse nor as flashy so no one plays her) but she's super rewarding and very good. I'd put her up there with Spirit and Hillbilly, honestly, if the player knows what they're doing.
---
awwww legion does have a heart
---
BiTcH
---
Stealth has some use, but falls off compared to looping skill.  Mainly because while you are stealthed, nothing is making the killer continue to chase you/look for you, so he will go to the next person and knock them off a gen.  If you are good at looping and stall tactics, your 3 teammates can work on gens in peace.
---
Finally, stealth eventually fails.  You will get found.   Be it due to luck, killer detection perks/addons (Lol, GL ever hiding from a scratched mirror myers without OoO and being 2+ survivors down), or the killer just being a better finder than you hider.  And being good at loops means that you can sometimes stall/delay going down, or even escape the killer.  Being bad at them means you just got downed and hooked.
---
5 blinks on nurse is bullshit too. So are lots of killer addons. 
---
If fucking windows of opportunity counters doctor, then all one shot m2s counter insta heals, ruin, and all other Gen perks for killer counter toolboxes, lightborn and infectious counters flashlights. The difference is the counters I listed are bigger.
---
WAZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!!!!
---
You gonna explain how or just keep saying my post is stupid?
---
Scratchmere Myers on lerys is fun too. Jump scares op lol
---
This gave me a giggle thank you. I miss those days of being new this game and freaking out lol
---
What about children?
---
i‚Äôve already made my explanation
---
complaining about niche perks that are rarely run is stupid
---
hahaha cause it's true camping bubba my imminent death that is inevitable
---
That Legion cosmetic my fave love the jacket
---
Thats how they get ya.
---
he has a dream
---
Somebody has to be number 1 though so whats wrong with it being freddy?
---
I really like Lost My Voice its funny
---
"the fuck was that bro!?" Ah the innocence..
---
What?? My reason for keeping Franklin's is "you have more important problem"?? Do you realise how incredibly moronic that statement is?
---
Why do you even play dead by daylight? Don't you have more important things to do? Why do you care about commenting on my post? Don't you have more important things to do? Jesus christ if you actually thing that argument is value you really DO have more important problems to worry about.
---
I‚Äôm fairly new myself still lol. 50 hours here. Freak out every once in a while lol
---
Toxic, sure. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal especially you say you leave. Just a little trick on survivors. 
---
But my question is, why take the chance? So they end up trying to die on hook, and accomplish... that kinda hurts the killer?  I try my hardest to get 3 hooks each, 2 against a good team, only reward after playing hundreds/thousands‚Äô of hours is bloodpoints at this point.
---
he means her mori is so bland and un unique it is inferior to Freddy‚Äôs
---
you have to find another survivor and keep your eye on them, then just tippy tap gens back and forth, never leave your gen and hope they do the same over there, the killer abandones chase for a gen and the chase was pointless. if the killer never gives chase you just get on a gen and leave the second they come over, eventually, over 40 or so minutes you should be able to get a gen to 80% and they will guard that one hard, then the other gen gets done.
---
I think I love you?
---
I was saying that keys are the reason to keep Franklin‚Äôs. I also know that I‚Äôm far from being the only one who thinks keys are stupid.
---
I have Dirty mind af
---
Ash pisses me off when I'm not playing as him and I got character select before I enter a lobby and I here "someone's shittin in the tall grass" or "groovy". Like damn last I checked Kate and Jane don't sound or look like Bruce Campbell
---
Spirit‚Äôs Mori came agter Freddy, making it a copy, and also, the Nurse‚Äôs Mori was used on 50 Crotus Penn Asylum Patients in the lore; which is very repetitive.  She literally just chokes them
---
How annoying
---
Tenacity on no mither in green ranks wtf
---
it was literally a harmless joke calm down child
---
Doesn't hitting them before the locker escape animation ends nullify head on or is that only with grabs
---
Until Dawn? I've completed it.
---
Thats it
---
There was a locker and he had Decisive
---
NP! I hope you have fun if you try them.
---
Nurse too, Claudette raised her to be the most broken being of all time.
---
Uh huh. Well by this logic, flashlights should not exist, at all, pallets aren't fun, should get rid of those too. I don't particularly find running around the same area chasing a survivor fun either, so all loops should be gone. Nothing but flat, open area with generators!
---
All I can say is it's good you aren't in charge of balancing or anything to do with the game, because you have some very contradictory ideas, it seems. 
---
Just out of curiosity, what exactly do you find/consider fun?
---
bhe...?
---
battlepay...?
---
And thats all just potential. Potential means nothing. Thats my point. Yes, he has a benefit that's possible that others don't. But he has a NEGATIVE that others don't. The positive is not worth the negative. There many times you lose a kill becase of freddys power, thats clear and obvious and notable. A killer who's power COSTS THEM KILLS CLEARLY... is not a good killer or power. He can't even just ignore his power and m1 kill. Because he HAS to put people to sleep. Im sorry, but having a power that is literally a negative sometimes, is just what makes him the worst. If you can't see that, you can't be reasoned with.
---
Preemptively, I'd like to say I don't run builds like that. I run medic centric builds or just a bunch of situational exhaustion perks.
---
I always get so confused hearing people justify tunnelling when they have those perks, when half the time survivors run those perks just to avoid being tunnelled/help punish the tunnelers. It's the worst feeling when you're the first hooked and the killer just decides to keep going for you.
---
The force is strong with this one.
---
Anything survivors do to actually survive is toxic, didn't you know?
---
Honestly if this or the new nightmare trench coat and glove aren't cosmetics next imma be mad
---
What does tunneling mean
---
But is he dummy dummy swole?
---
Yes. At least you actually have a chance to do something against one (even though it is small). Keys are up to RNG.
---
Nice, altough I am interested: how did you explain this to the teacher/other students?
---
If keys are not up to RNG, winning is up to RNG.
---
The coloring is really nice and all the little details like the lines in the mood look really nice. The one thing I notice that could be improved is looking at perspective around the bottom triangle of bones. But other then that it looks fucking awesome
---
"Its optional" can easily be twisted into something else. For example, it's optional that i could buy X. It may give me an advantage over others but it doesn't stop me from playing the game.
---
This doesn't adress your response directly but i just dislike that kind of reason.
---
Just posted what a website defined then explained what the perineum is.
---
You obviously haven‚Äôt been here since the Freddy chapter cane out. From Freddy‚Äôs release to Spirit‚Äôs release survivors got heavily nerfed and a lot of the things addressed were things killers complained about. The amount of pallets, pallet vacuums, double pallet spawns, exhaustion perk nerfs, decisive strike rework, etc. and now they‚Äôre even gonna remake some maps that are survivor sided like bad ham preschool. If anything killers have been having a better time and it‚Äôs deserved if you ask me.
---
When you continuously chase one person instead of going after other people
---
Ex. A wraith sits nearby a hooked survivor and waits until he‚Äôs unhooked and just goes after him again instead of going after the person that unhooked them.
---
r/comedycemetary
---
The Thing, or...PRINCE OF DARKNESS!
---
I stay to let the killer get some free hits but only if they're already there. Otherwise I will just leave so I don't hold them hostage.
---
One of the first links is to the urban dictionary definition lol.
---
I'm only talking about the people who do it just because of pity reasons or just cause. Those guys deserve it
---
I feel you there. Earlier I played such a masterful game and got the 4K that I just knew it was going to pop‚Ä¶ It didn‚Äôt, lol.
---
Oh god it‚Äôs a long ass story
---
that was a amazing escape!
---
I'm clearly the only one that wants balance in this game. If you're not some crazy pro gamer that plays this game 24/7, you can't have fun in this game
---
I don't know why this post hasn't gotten more attention, this hand/chest design resembles no other killer in the game, chest waist trainer looking thing definitely looks like Pinhead.
---
Legion and Plague have annoying mechanics.
---
Maybe the months upon months of survivor nerfs? Also the fact that this has 3k upvotes speaks to how pro-killer this community is.
---
[yeah totally a killer main here](https://imgur.com/gallery/Bf6KjPg)
---
Helps with tunneling non obsessions, which is the only consistent way to counter Mettle of Man.
---
We have no idea how long the teleportation cooldown is.  We don‚Äôt know a lot of things, like how many traps and fake pallets he can place (or even if he can do both at base).  We don‚Äôt know a lot of things.
---
I can see both, but have to go with &gt;!killer. Give him Trapper or Pig's ability!&lt;
---
"Other than working against the tiers that Myers spends 95% of the match in, it's pretty useless against him"
---
Love me some hatch escapes
---
Lol that's literally what all you killer mains say to try and defend yourselves

Because they think it's funny.

This community is super toxic, expect shit like that on a regular basis.

This is adorable!

That looks like a close up of the nurse.

Well that sucks.

Surely seeing the massive success (phenomenon even) that the game has become you would think that the licensees would be more than willing to allow them to use the design for the old character.

Well thanks for the clarification, very cute of you to point that out to me.

---
 WAZAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP
---
Well if you heal against him it'll prevent him from just going up to you and M1ing you go down you and not use his power at all. But, at the same time it could just be a waste of time as his power injures you pretty quick
---
I've gotta say, superb job my friend, and thank you for the contribution!
---
You can explain it without being an asshole
---
First off thank you got a civil and thought out response! I fully agree with the totem counter being part of a perk like small game, that would be a very solid buff/change to the perk, I wasn't meaning to say that should be part of the base survivor perk because that would totally remove NOED from the game basically and I don't think that would be good at all. The timer was with the Endgame Collapse in mind since that would really make it hard to completely wait it out as survivors. 
---
 
---
Yes changing your gameplay is counter play, my point was should you have to counter play a perk that isn't being run, Nurses Calling in my mind would be an example of healthy counter play, if you heal and the killer starts going for you right away if you are in range then you can tell they are using it. You may get into another chase; you may get downed or you maybe will get away and then you can counter the perk, the killer makes you spend more time running from them in either case. The biggest difference is that if they didn't come for you, you would have a strong idea if they are using the perk and then can try and counter it. With NOED you have to counter it if they are running it or not, and that's where I have a problem with it. Just the perk existing means you have to play around it, furthermore there isn't even a warning that you are exposed like other perks or powers that give that effect, Myers, devour hope, haunted ground, you have time for the perks to take affect, know they are there, and try and counter them, NOED is different as there isn't a warning until someone has already been hit. Make this worse in my mind too is that if you spend a decent amount of time trying to get dull totems instead of doing gens, running the killer around, or helping other survivors you aren't getting any credit towards pips and ranking up; all of that time ends up being wasted if they aren't running NOED.
---
I wasn't in anyway meaning to defend the old DS it was an absolutely overpowered perk that really needed a nerf along time ago I was more making the comparison that just because there is technically counter play doesn't mean that it is good, dribbling, and being forced into using a perk was absolute crap. The bigger question I was getting at is should a perk be powerful enough that regardless of if it is being used in the game or not you have to counter it.
---
Lol nice
---
Not really much or a concept. It‚Äôs a basic dress form and a headband. Needs quite a bit more fleshed out to be considered a con petulant design.
---
It would be a hilarious inside joke if the movement lines indicated that Legion was walking backwards
---
I miss the moonwalk memes after the rework
---
The perks and story seem great but i don't know if DbD would actually have anyone mess with the basement, that's their big constant, might even be a lore thing.
---
what? i wasn't an asshole. it's how i talk. wasn't trying to offend anyone, just really think it's cute someone is naive about the world we live in. i actually like op is this way.
---
40 mins? if it takes more than 3 mins I re-que. If that doesnt help then i just go play another game. Also doing killer adept is way harder than survivor.
---
It‚Äôs pretty good
---
Spirit is one of the few Killers that actually plays differently during a chase. It would be a huge waste to turn her into a Wraith add on.
---
Also she has way too many differences to be a Wraith addon.
---
I wish the perk was based more on what you do than what you allow the survivors to do. For example say, every time you hook a survivor you gain one token each of which increases your action speed by 4% up to max of 6 tokens or 24%. This would make it so the effectiveness of the perk is relative to your performance and not the performance of the survivors, allowing you to better control the speed at which it scales up over the course of a match.
---
Wtf us tier 1?
---
We need more players like you
---
She doesn't have that many differences.  She's just if faster more invisible wraith.
---
But do you have English
---
Always run full speed away, you'll waste more of the killers time.
---
Standing still doesn't do shit against good survivors; they always move to the next loop
---
How many hours do you have?
---
knocking pallets on killers is a game function?
---
I love how many comments this got. Good troll.
---
Lol people like you are the reason the game isn't balanced
---
Maybe you should try Civilization or something instead ;)
---
Spirit is slower outside of cloak, faster in cloak, can fake using her power, can't see survivors, comes out of cloak instantly, doesn't make noise when cloaking and plenty more. She's fine as an original killer.
---
Lol go ahead and defend killers with your last breath. They're OP, and you're mostly likely trash at the game without the OP perks and addons
---
You know you can't post petitions on the main sub üòõ
---
*Delightful Spirit Noises*
---
Yeah some guy won an auction to be the face of Dwight.  McLean has spoken about it in his streams several times.
---
Let's be real, Julie would be up for the threesome.
---
Where did you get that information from?
---
I'm *loving* the wood grain! As someone else mentioned, the perspective is off, however. The bones should go more behind the candles. Also the skulls look kind of warped, but that might have been what you were going for. In any case, love the details! I can't draw or even write to save my life, personally, so I can't really judge lol
---
I'm a survivor main, but I love Nightmare on Elm Street and this is simply how Freddy Krueger should be.
---
I mean.  I‚Äôm a survivor main. So whenever I play killer it‚Äôs for ritual.  I think I could do the huntress adept pretty easily.  And the hag adept sounds way easier than Laurie adept. So does doctor. Hillbilly. Leatherface. Freddy. Leigon. Micheal.  It‚Äôs all on the add ons you bring in.  Where as your best chance as survivor. Is to bring a medkit or a tool box and hope the killer is good enough to realise that he needs to leave you alone in order to play the game properly üòÇ
---
Why does he have -13 if he gave the same answer as the other one
---
Works best as Doctor.
---
So many failed skill checks and hate mail accusing me of camping the gens acting like it's my fault they did the gens wrong and that I was using an Op killer
---
And I‚Äôve always had super long load times. And it‚Äôs a known issue.  They‚Äôre saying dedicated servers will fix it...   we‚Äôll see.
---
Who uses a Instaheal with emergency medkit
---
Like 10 years from now when we get new nightmare trench coat too.
---
Adept idiot, play a killer with a different killer's teachables
---
The thing is, it's not cheating. This is the phrase that's causing hostility towards you. I know you believe it is, but your turn of phrase is the problem. I know I'm onto a losing battle even saying that to you, but if you calmed down with the 'cheating' accusations you'd cut down on a hell of a lot of the arguments you end up getting in to.
---
It's not about ranks. Matchmaking seriously fucking sucks as a survivor on PS4. I'm always low ranks (below 10) and it takes forever. Then you actually find a match, and the killer dodges the lobby.
---
Why?
---
Oh wow thank you! I wanted to main the doctor but I haven‚Äôt unlocked him yet and ghost face is coming out so I think I‚Äôm going to main him instead. I do have one question, when you say random skill checks is it any time within the game or when you are doing an action like healing, gens, etc
---
Also Thank you so much, you are so helpful
---
Absolutely true.
---
I like how you circled all 4 perks. One removes the player from the game for 60 seconds (32 for the heal 28 to run to a corner and back), one forces them to walk everywhere, and the other isn't relevant unless they unsafe and you tunnel. 
---
Even with a key and mom this type of player is dam useless lol. Probably crouching without urban.
---
Where is the lie?
---
WHHHHHHAAAAAAZZZZZZUUUUUUUPPPPPPP!!!!!
---
Sometimes I like to do things to please my inner 10 year old. Did I say inner? I meant captive.
---
You're completely right. But that's just for the hardcore players. I personally enjoy playing the game, but it seems like I have to invest most of my time to become a pro at it, to even have fun
---
Ruin doesn't require any skill on the Killer's part, true, but what it does is demand more skill of Survivors. If Ruin is kicking your arse, git gud or run Small Game.
---
Though I'll agree NOED can get f*cked off a cliff.
---
Also, every Killer aura-reading perk has a counter. For example, you can counter BBQ and Chili by getting into a locker or using Distortion.
---
Freddy will bevable to teleport to gens, but there'll be a 5 second warning. With Sprint Burst, you can run 30m in that time.
---
While the Survivor being camped can do nothing about it, the Killer is punished through the fact that other Survivors cam just do gens. It takes 120 seconds for one Survivor to go from first hook to dead. Survivors can potentially repair 4.25 gens in that time.
---
Heidenen zijn het
---
My GOD!
---
The dude is agreeing with you, AND YOU'RE STILL GETTING TILTED!
---
I always sort by new, brother
---
The hell is this about XD
---
probably on your chest
---
MY GOD!
---
I guess you don't understand that he was being SARCASTIC! üòÇ
---
I don't mind being mories if I'm getting moried by killer who actually has cool mori on, lol. They really need to rework Trapper and Wraith mori...
---
You know what, I'm up-voting this. Just for the bravery on display.
---
Flashlight saves might not be broken for most, but I've had my fair share of issues recently, on both sides.
---
This is adorable I love this gj to the artist it's beautiful ^^ and wholesome
---
apparently I was misinformed by the many perk pack creators and it does work. I suppose I have more work to do along side the powers :)
---
Hi smol pp boi Cora :lenny:
---
Idk why people hate claudettes so much. Those immersed claudettes only exist in green ranks and above and most of the players who know what theyre talking about are in purple and red ranks. Its very to see a immersed claudette that high
---
Lol
---
Trash player.
---
So many people are going to Downvote because they don't watch Dead Meat
---
Not sure how that would work with 4 survivors.
---
N O STOP WAIT NO KEEP GOING
---
Spirit mindgames are so fun...i just wish Prayer Beads werent a requirement
---
Ikr... ;)
---
Stop getting my hopes up. Sometimes I think I keep my sub here just to see if we ever get our holy grail.
---
(Also DBD is still the best memes on the internet)
---
Becasue ERB rules!
---
Imagine not knowing if you are obession or not
---
But solo nerf so no
---
the game should just be survivors existing in a virtual world. wouldnt we all be happy?
---
Hi I'm average
---
To be quite honest I don‚Äôt think a ban system is very good in a game like dbd. In a game like HoTS, league and overwatch later it makes more sense. Because of the wide character choices. Dbd doesn‚Äôt have that much and also we aren‚Äôt taking killers into part of it we are taking perks into part of it. If it‚Äôs regular game mode then obviously the first 2 great perks will be gone all the time. Don‚Äôt forget about people prestiging or new players or people that don‚Äôt play that much. 
---
Also does it show you what perks the player has or does it give you all perks to chose from to deactivate. 
---
Also take into consideration most bans like that in games are in the Rank side of the game not the fun, less skillful, and casual side.
---
Which that idea kind of goes for a Rank playmode. Or just a different mode entirely.
---
This just gives more ways to activate Mettle, it makes it a bit more overpowered than it already is.
---
Good except Self Care, I run Plunderers but bond is also pretty good.
---
Yeah Xbox has so much more salt while PS is much more toxic, I'd say.
---
I'd like to be able to re-stand survivors  after downing them. One time a guy got left alone from his friends DCing. my gut kicked in and I downed him. I felt bad, he didn't struggle. So I spent two minutes trying to find the hatch with this Claudette on my shoulder.  
---
In a game I was just in I think someone accidentally dropped their flashlight right as I downed them. There's potential for funny killer/survivor interaction.
---
Was the hype for Myers as big as the current hype for ghost face? I can imagine just about everybody was Myers when he came out.
---
Looks like someone will be ready if Crossplay becomes a thing.
---
This game is full of bugs, so everything can happen, sadly i have not encountered any bugs with flashlight yet
---
I had a similar first game lol. Last one alive, hadn‚Äôt even been hooked, and I escaped through the hatch. I was so proud of myself.
---
yea it doesn't sound toxic at all the way you wrote it.
---
Same can be said about survivors at that rank tho. Everyone has MoM, self care, dead hard, adrenaline/borrowed time
---
Julie would kill him
---
Oh the downvotes poor cunt
---
It's a textureless logo with its animation
---
Ah thanks, link me to where they say it's cheating.
---
Yeah from what i gathered Asian players take this game REALLY seriously, survivors are always 4 mans who only do gens and killers only camp and tunnel. I dont know why do they even play if there is no place for fun in there games, just do gens/ camp tunnel and get out to another fun game.
---
it allows you to not give a free first hit to : spirit, wraith, Freddy (gives you time to find a safe looping place), anyone using M&amp;A
---
Haddonfield
---
*me still relatively new* Ah sweet, extra bloodpoints
---
This is all just my opinion obviously.
---
From the Survivor side...
---
Hiding/immersed survivors hate him because he can be difficult to hide from.  If you aren't running a detection perk, you might even run right into him like a dummy.   Most Freddy end up tunneling survivors off hooks, because it's the only thing the power really helps them do.  Freddy also made Self-Care even more meta than it already was, because if you weren't able to wake yourself up with SC you were having to blow gens which hurt the team's progress. Also, there are times where everyone is asleep and you can't do much about it. His Aura ability also made it to where even if you won a chase, he'd be on you again anyway.
---
From the killer side...
---
You have to wait 5-7 seconds to actually hit a survivor. During that time they can easily get to a loop or even wake themselves up.  It's difficult for him to protect totems. Survivors can wake themselves up with self-care, one of the most common perks.  You can sleep multiple survivors, but because you can only chase 1 at a time the other survivor(s) will just wake themselves up. Survivors have to wake themselves up by blowing gens, but they barely lose any progress in doing so.  Adrenaline, a meta perk, totally negates his power. 
---
From all sides...
---
The dream world is like playing while submersed in a bowl of old clam chowder.
---
I think the re-work is genius, myself.  The added mobility, and the ability to scare survivors off of gens, is going to be splendid. Survivors automatically falling asleep will help him, and survivors having the ability to wake themselves up removes the self-care dependency.
---
This will not change anything but i still i agree and support this statement.
---
*leaves game at the prayer beads spirit*
---
Wraith isn't bad at all with his rework + addons
---
*quiet sobbing in the bushes*
---
Fortnite definitely doesn‚Äôt listen to its players. 
---
Yes, I play Fortnite regularly. It‚Äôs still fun with friends but it‚Äôs rapidly becoming less so.
---
Joys of rank 12-20 &lt;3
---
This will be fixed with dedicated servers you will only play with people within your region
---
thank fuck the game might not be a lag fest 99% of the time
---
Tier 1 Myres can mori survivors.
---
Why not doge the lobbies with high ping then? You are in control of which games you play as survivor so you shouldn't  complain about high ping if you choose to play with someone that is out of your geographic area.  
---
Also you sound pretty racist for stereotyping an entire race of players based on your anecdotal evidence, but whatever floats your boat.
---
Hag
---
If survivors could optionally turn this off then yeah.
---
What rank?
---
 Perks: Party Like Porn Stars, Live and Learn and... I cant think of a name for the third.
---
the hag in general uh doctor billy and spirit
---
Turns out that on high ranks where games are harder people use op and broken staff who would have fought? If only devs did something about bullshit perks/add-ons/items for both sides.
---
I feel like the downvotes prove I am right...  oh well, they're downvotes, they don't matter. People can't tale a joke, not my problemo, lol
---
Definition please
---
Yeet on these downvotes fam
---
If they balance freddy with only coordinated teams in mind then solo survivors or even 2 friend teams will get destroyed.
---
tbh the only time ill use ebony mori is for dailys, sry not sry
---
It gets tiring searching over and over again for a new lobby. If it was a 5 minute wait for good ping i would much rather that. And I really don‚Äôt care if this is racist or not but I‚Äôm sick of Asian players on this game.
---
^^
---
Yea that‚Äôs exactly what playing with Asians is like. It‚Äôs not fun at all.
---
You pipped then.
---
I down them, insta DC. Every time
---
I don't know, maybe I'm just bad and keep thinking it's a bug, I'd actually be happier if it was me just being mistaken, that would mean the Developers have less to fix haha.
---
sometimes you just dont give a fuck about the killer and just want to fix your damn gen. And when it's done you're like "Aaaah ! very well done indeed sir."
---
You keep your rank it just shows that for some reason. Unlike killer where survivors can DC and literally deny you all hook and chaser points you would've gotten from them wich usually equals a down rank or black pip at red ranks
---
Hi average, I'm dad.
---
I love the 12 seconds heals and with the green kit on teammates the 9.5 second heal. Then I get some extra healing (:
---
Purples this season are something else. 
---
Before the tweek on survivors Pip system, purple ranks was great, now it's like green r yellow sometimes.
---
Awwwwwww
---
I don't usually spam this but this was genuinely an aww moment
---
Man I wish I could draw, even if only a little bit. Thanks for sharing.
---
Hahahahaha love it !
---
The reason the Asian killers came to North America.  In Asia, the generator is running in five minutes, and almost all of the survivors have BT, DS, and M.O.M, making it very difficult to kill.  So they came to North America.
---
Yes, do it. And don't come back
---
This is spectacular.
---
the Plague isn't design to compete against a swf team. She seems quite balanced against a good solo survivor team.
---
(as long as you don't have a 'tard who cleans himself early game)
---
do you have a blog where you officially post your thoughts because bravo, this was something else
---
If looking up doesn't work, spam the button to drop the survivor.
---
&gt;Run faster than killers but not their lunges for 3 secs every 40 secs
---
Sprint
---
If you don't DC after your first hook you're a camper and you're bad
---
What's so bad about Claudette =(
---
no.
---
Bland is an absolutely fair criticism.
---
Unique by definition means to be one of a kind, and no other Killer chokes/caresses a dead survivors face.
---
According to BHVR's data having a 4 man SWF is not much of a statistical advantage. Like it was surprisingly minor of how much it increased the average escapes.
---
Pretty new to the game, whar are ruins?
---
Would be 3x more bp
---
You dont learn from being totally destroyed.
---
You learn from things which are slightly above your skill level.
---
Let a kid repair a flat tire on his bike and he will learn. Tell a kid to repair a nucleair power plant and he will stand completely confused about what to do.
---
All you guys did was waste killers time, addons and fun
---
They wont nerf noed because "clEaNse ToTemZ"
---
I always said that noed when it activates is too strong but then stupid ass killer sided mains say their catchphrase to just do totems. They just want to keep their precious endgame wheelchair so they can get the easy 4k.
---
A noob thinking that nurse is balanced and Freddy weak????!! What
---
Dunny enough, in m6 nealr 400 hpurs of playing this game I don"t think I've ever seen 4 survivor on the same gen..
---
No not really. I find it quite easy to get away from them both. But that might be just because everyone that played them wasn't that good with them.
---
Turn that frown upside down
---
When I was noob I hated Freddy and doc, no idea how he thinks they‚Äôre weak and Nurse is balanced.
---
Sorry someone made you drop your survivor mori ;p
---
Depends on killer but Thompson house or haddonfield
---
Didn‚Äôt realize I had to explain that something is sarcasm, detective.
---
No not really. Hes quite easy to get away from if im going tbh
---
What if it's only for a few seconds and they are gonna die anyway
---
People would just lobby dodge if it‚Äôs before the game starts and if it‚Äôs after I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for people to not be able to use things they paid for because someone else said so
---
Lmao feels like half my games at least
---
I can see the Aura part but the item charges would most likely be abused still a good concept though
---
They said it isn‚Äôt intended and that they have not balanced the game around it, but that they can‚Äôt enforce rules on it since they can‚Äôt prove people are doing it. They said this on one of their live streams a few months ago. So it is cheating, but they can‚Äôt do anything about.
---
Found the rank 20
---
Dunno why you pressed R1 anyway, if you pressed R2 you could‚Äôve grabbed him
---
Its almost as if the killer wants... to kill. Also, do you leave if someone is hooked in endgame &amp; you dont want to save them?
---
I think they just meant base killer because they're free, the original 4 were trapper wraith billy and nurse. You should definitely get "a nurse's calling" from nurse and "Hex: ruin" from the hag (I don't know know if hag is free or not sorry)
---
To make bloodwarden worth it
---
I mean its bullshit but oh well you cant stop people leaving, id probably leave to rather than be slugged for 4 minutes though just so you can 4k
---
I don't want to be Frank.
---
It‚Äôs an asshole move for sure. You must be playing against terrible survivors if they get camped and their first thought is ‚Äúbetter leave‚Äù
---
Always.
---
Dunno why crossplay isn‚Äôt a thing, there‚Äôs no real difficulty slope
---
The whole point of the hatch is to end the game, i dont want to spend 20 minutes looking for an immersed claudette. Also if you get a 3k youve won
---
When you've spent 10 minutes looking for the hex totem and you still can't find it
---
What kind of noob is this? List is false af.
---
The others aren‚Äôt original but camping leatherface is???
---
You will √íw√ì
---
Forgot to carry the 6.
---
Any time I get I to a situation where there are only 2 people left, I will try to spare the one actually trying to do gens and find and kill the one hiding.
---
Lori man fucking Lori would survive lol.
---
Also tap died in the first saw movie.... so I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd survive. 
---
Of course I‚Äôm going off the movie characters that they‚Äôre inspired off of.
---
Big Brain Move
---
You have to disconnect an absurd amount to get banned, even killer wait times are not worth it for some people to play some maps so they just leave. Its why they stop leaving losing you pips so people would stop deranking
---
Totally agree
---
Wasting the best medkit by cutting charges in half
---
Also are you making a easy to kill list for frank with that ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be frank‚Äù line.
---
Yes I made a bad joke!
---
No there was no orange bar
---
Just put it down and pick it right back up so they'll notice that you have an item that they're too dumb to see in your hand
---
Stick to dick in her pussy you gonna end up with shards of glass
---
There is 2 options but it really comes down to what ur team does if ur a solo player
---
1: Noone cleanses and you just play broken which yea is a pain but if u've at least used no mither be4 its pretty much just playing with that
---
2: Everyone cleanses instantly and just deals with it
---
Mettle of Man is used even more
---
Wow, what skill. They really should make an animation so you know when the spirit is actually phasing to avoid this nonsense.
---
Yeah I can see the benefits and downsides to both, thanks for the info!
---
They do have that invulnerability though and it's there to give them a chance when they're getting farmed in front of the killer. You can counter it by either waiting a second or going after the unhooker (allthough you may end up hitting the unhooked surv anyway if you come from the wrong angle).
---
The Ship Has Sailed.
---
Easiest 4K of my life was when I chased one guy around the map who dropped every pallet as soon as he got to it and the other 3 completed 3 generators leaving the last 4 all really close together. The best bit is when the pallet dropper proudly says "EZ 3 gens" post game as if he didn't screw his team
---
What about those times when someone runs killer around most of the game and doesn't get time for altruism/objective. Or the dc's
---
The spirit even used insidius so the claudette is just stupid lmao
---
Why you gotta bully my boy
---
Haddonfield or Swamp imo
---
I have no problem with that. No problem. No problem at all.
---
I've seen a lot of crashes, you can usually tell because they keep doing their thing up until the moment of the disconnect.
---
Like a killer who crashes will usually keep walking into whatever obstacles, survivors will not even pause what they're doing (which they will if you end task or exit through menu) and generally it'll be confusing to watch, like a Nurse comes screaming in mid-teleport and then vanishes.
---
The spirit is using the prayer beads add on, so no whooshing sound happens at any distance.
---
Can I point out that you can‚Äôt do gens while in t3 madness you have to get out of it.
---
I played a recent game against a doctor and couldn‚Äôt do a gen the option wasn‚Äôt there so I got rid of madness. 
---
Could be my fault or game fault or an offering I don‚Äôt know but yeah.
---
gG Ez bABy KiLleR!
---
Of course you dont ms. Killer main. Just as much you wont have a problem with that when you get the very rare 4k DC within 1st minute.
---
It still does not justify the current prizes
---
Welcome, it‚Äôs an amazing game, very addictive, but the community is very entitled, you will get a lot of hate mail from this game sadly.
---
Or more likely an erect penis
---
:music intensifies:
---
Well you have 1 of 2 people 
---
1. People salty for real reasons.
---
2. People salty they lost.
---
I don‚Äôt mind DC‚Äôs. I take that as me having done a great job.
---
Ironworks of Misery, 
---
Groaning Storehouse,
---
Fractured Cowshed,
---
Rancid Abattoir, 
---
Thompson House,
---
Torment Creek,
---
Disturbed Ward,
---
Grim Pantry,
---
Treatment Theatre,
---
Mother's Dwelling,
---
Mount Ormond Resort,
---
Temple of Purgation.
---
Pick one, they are all garbage.
---
I wouldnt swear in any chat with a random them reporting you might get you banned
---
Well it depends on the killer. Hag is not so bad at Haddonfield and billi is op on corn, while hag is op on Lerys but billi sucks on it.
---
yeah you cant do anything in t3 madness except vault windows and drop pallets
---
As far as I‚Äôm aware they have invincibility frames just after they get unhooked.
---
"Host Disconnected"
---
Definitely not the worst game community wise though.
---
Bond, way more useful than self care because you can find someone that will heal you faster, or you can just bring a medkit and any other perk.
---
&gt;/r/deadbydaylight is not a platform to shame other players. **Censor all usernames for posts and screenshots or video featuring other players in a negative light**, [...]
---
if you do that it give her the opportunity to snowball your team with the red puke.
---
You can cleans lategame when all gens are done for exemple.
---
If thats what you think it means then congratulations üëå
---
It‚Äôs not all about skill, I watch him because he‚Äôs very pleasant and always in a good mood, he doesn‚Äôt complain about the games balance constantly like other streamers.
---
I've gotten worse messages from other games. And I play Legion, so I'm usually prepared for toxic messages
---
):
---
Naw, they can‚Äôt just ban off bans the devs need proof and they can probably go through your game history, not sure how it works. 
---
Best is videos though.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Maybe she can teach him how to be a better killer
---
Not a good idea cause then the devs have to decide which perks are too strong together. That might not end well lol
---
Probably Ash, he‚Äôs probably been in similar situations before.
---
**DBD on mobile**
---
Sorry didn't know
---
Always search the area before picking someone up if you are paranoid there‚Äôs a mr flashy around, scare them away before picking up.
---
I managed to get this by using 
---
Deliverance
---
DS, run at them make it obvious you have DS
---
And Flip flop, so they‚Äôll slug you to waste your DS, 
---
When they come back you‚Äôll have half your wiggle bar.
---
Devs: Can't come up with design for cosmetics that you would get from hitting devotion meanwhile all they would have to do is something along the lines of prestige/legacy cosmetics in sense of them being altered dedault skins.  
---
Also devs: Announce a battle pass that has even more PAID cosmetics
---
There was something wrong with him before the newest update they had which made him more fair and less brain dead to play. 
---
I don‚Äôt play legion so I can‚Äôt say whether he‚Äôs great or not. He only has 1 good perk which is discordance. But you could wait for Ghostface I‚Äôm not entirely sure if he‚Äôll be free or good. But I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll see that on the ptb.
---
Legion got changed since you came back, but before this change Legion was in general an unfun Killer to go against because of the lack of counterplay. 
---
I avoided this Killer for that reason, but I bought Legion, and I'm actually liking them a lot.
---
Doctor Mains Rejoice
---
Yeah unhooker is usually full hp and needless to say having 2 injured survivors is soooo much worse than simply getting that guy back to the hook where he came from, cuz now u have to chase and waste time etc., while the latter case it's just free hook progression
---
Yay bullying low skill gamers and promoting asshole behaviour so entertaining !
---
I would keep an eye out for it while fixing gens and trying to escape, not that I would abandon my team to hide in the corner.
---
the estate hate that map
---
Not going to lie, I bought Legion for Iron Maiden. 
---
Huntress is my favorite Killer.
---
It tells you in the descriptions of the emblems what is for what. What are you talking about
---
Is it something that will get you banned it happened me in 6 games row.
---
I can definitely identify with this.
---
The other problem is that a killer has no idea whether a match is going to be 'relaxed' either, I've said this before, but you get some "sweaty" survivors who split up and you're going to just have four survivors sprinting to four different generators immediately, you'll find one of them and the other three will pop their generators before you finish the chase, since it only takes them 80 seconds.
---
You don't know how many people are running Mettle of Man/Decisive Strike when one of them is an Obsession. You don't know whether to give up that Laurie spying on you with Object of Obsession and SWFing everyone where you are when you have no idea where everyone else is because they know when you're nearby. You don't know whether that's a Ranger's Medkit with insta-heal or whether it's an Emergency Medkit on a dedicated We'll Make It healer that is going to keep everyone healthy with minimal effort.
---
You have to try so hard to win and demolish the survivor "team" in order to prolong the game in order to have fun in the game, otherwise the game is over before you even finished a second chase - and a lot of the time it's normal to not find more than one or two of a coordinated four-man anyway.
---
Well 1) not everyone has all the meta perks and 2)  you shouldnt be forced into playing a certain way because everyone else is.
---
Yeah, mind games in predicting where she'll phase to, despite the fact she can hear you and see grass move. Getting a free mind game because there's no animation tied to your phase startup is nonsense.
---
Hope has no counter and imo I find it useless. This is my quick answer. If I am wrong let me know.
---
Hangman‚Äôs trick.
---
I got put up against two level fives. I‚Äôm just a level 16.
---
You can also see the grass move when she phases you know. Spirit mind games you to catch you and you meed to mind game her to escape her
---
No lol it‚Äôs a legit strategy
---
Ehh
---
Yeah but you pay for dbd. It was only free for a period. It's for sale at gamestop. It's not a free game like Fortnite or Smite, Paladins. Why should there be a battle pass? We already pay for dlc and cosmetics.
---
Nice counterpoint
---
You win!
---
Unrelenting. I mean, just use Save the Best for Last.
---
Survaillance is also great just like MYC.
---
I have No idea where to see his rework I tried YouTube and google but I can‚Äôt find his rework details
---
Observe...
---
Go to Monto's channel, he has a shitload
---
‚ù§Ô∏èüòò
---
Surveillance &gt; MYC 
---
neither of which are top tier perks.
---
Tbh it should really do more or at least not allow survivors to heal themselves to full. It reverses any progress you made and sometimes even heals already wounded (from m1) survivors lol.
---
I have an issue with that too, I had a game where I pipped with Iridescent objectives and benevolence, but only silver evader and silver survival.
---
Did all the three generators that popped pretty much by myself (only had help when the generator was almost done, and it was countered by them not being able to work through Ruin), managed to save and heal a few people before they started intentionally suiciding on hook or disconnecting.
---
But if your fellow survivors are too potato, you're not getting a pip; your first chase'll be your last chase and you won't have been able to heal or rescue them because they instantly give up.
---
hey neat how long did this take, i wish i could draw
---
I'm sure you weren't going for this, but you put a smile on my face at a time that wasn't happening that much, thank you
---
He doesn't ever play in a toxic or scummy way. Never camps or tunnels people on principal. He always rotates killers while playing. For me it's not fun to watch someone 'main' &amp; play the same killer over &amp; over again. This makes him a bit of a 'Jack or all trades, but master of none' He's just a nice guy &amp; fun to watch. Yes he is awful at Survivor but that's what makes it pretty funny to watch.
---
myers making dad jokes is the most unusual thing ive ever witnessed
---
Oh cool that means from now on unlocking characters and most importantly perks will be much easier, and perk levels will be gone for an easier grind. Oh wait...
---
For Hag and Spirit it's pretty good
---
Make healing unbearable, tag an many people as you can, then focus on the last one you tag whilst everyone else is mending.
---
You ever faced a sabo team, it completely counters them
---
So you camp, and you're mad that you can't down the unhooked survivor instantly before they can do anything. 
---
You're free to play that way but damn it's disappointing to hear.
---
No. Because sabo is useless.
---
It turns into a meme vs meme fight, and mine wins
---
i bet myers and bubbas conversations are captivating. *heavy breathing* **EUUGHGHH EEE REEEE UGUGGRHHH**

Because you're in a chase with someone? Dead on hook or not, usually I'll wait around to see if I can find and guide the runner to the exit gate or trade hits on the way out to make sure they make it out. Unless time is ticking down too far and I'm risking dying to EGC because of Blood Warden.
---
Of course the waiting after the other survivor is dead is pretty toxic, I see survivors teabagging me across the map because of Blood Warden too, it's pretty aggravating that they don't leave or decide to fast vault until the last 5 seconds.
---
I was aiming for that, 99% of my comments and posts is to make people laugh or be happy. Mostly by using Pig.
---
this board is basically a whinge fest.
---
Well you have done it, thank you
---
Yeah, but there's always that one Lone Ranger that goes for the chest, at least one per match.
---
Too long, didn't read.
---
P
---
If the killer wants to kill me they can kill me. If they want to leave me on the ground while they go looking for the last survivor, I‚Äôll dc and go about my day üòã I always run BT &amp; go for late saves, if it was a good game and we got to the opening of the gates I don‚Äôt mind the risk of being sacrificed if it means someone else can escape.
---
Aaand someone broke the bloodpoint economy again...
---
yeah

But if you don't expect it
---
Beat me to it

Sooo i win if i got all of them?

As a freddy main the lack of frederd offends me
---
The funni thing is that Insidious kicked in, so there were no TR and no wooshing
---
You're the type of person that got participation trophies and called yourself a champion, aren't you?
---
Hell yeah. Pig=upvote.
---
This looks a lot like the Jon Travolta dance from Pulp Fiction
---
I AM STILL CRYING.
---
Still in my opinion to much of a nerf and unneeded.
---
Pig or nothing in my world.
---
It's "good" against Freddy mostly because of the increased skillcheck chance. Though I'd say it won't give you much considering Freddy was looking your side so he will put you in dream again.
---
Totally agreed with you on Myers.
---
Pig, Pig and Pig.
---
Unless it's Mirror Myers
---
The match making is a joke.
---
Town of Salem is fucking brilliant, I really enjoy playing it
---
Nice personality wins every time.  I don't care if someone is an expert at this game to watch a stream.
---
You're not going to get pulled off a gen by a tier 2 or 3 Meyers, they have a terror radius. If you need spine chill to not get yoinked by t2/3, you aren't paying attention

Since I am a pig main I will correct the 2 things I found off. 
---
1) Amanda's letter is only good on Leries and the Game.

2)When a survivor searches a box the aura will not be shown again, thus they don't need to remember the boxes searched with rule set no2.

I didn't intend for my reply to say that, but if sub-optimal matches can turn into better matches over time, I would legit take that over the situation happening again. So, yes, I would rather have people not have good matches with ping, and have it improve over time instead of having the possibility of anyone being open to a DDOS attack. Not to say that's a situation that's going to, or should happen, but if anyone out there can basically fry your router because they're mad, would you want that to happen to you?

Wait till you get killers who tunnel a person all game even when he has a chance to go after hurt survivors throwing their selves at the killer to get him to stop tunneling a dude and they won't even try to go after anyone else.  My friend and I the other day went up against a tunneling doctor who tunneled a dude all game. Even when we were hurt he would not go after us even when we just basically would run up to his face and block him just trying to sacrifice ourselves for the poor random he would not attack us.  Once he got the guy hooked he then proceeded to face camps  so I ran in and pretended to unhook the guy so he would hit me and I could get the guy off the hook which worked and we all made it out. Dude ended up going super salty in end game chat calling us toxic for not letting him get the kill on the hooked guy.
---
I would love to know the killer's loadout if you call what the survivor was running toxic. there are plenty of load outs for killers that could be considered toxic as well.
---
I'm a survivor main. I dont have MoM , but i still think it needs adjustments. Every M1 killer is screwed. No matter,if you have noed or a t3 myers,if you stay injured with MoM you can easily counter even that...not fair just for taking hits in a chase..
---
I just got it to work now for the first time and you should have seen the angle the killer was to the locker lol didnt make any sense. Ye i hope they are aware of this because i deffo needs looking at.
---
Seconded. If you consider ANY perk "necessary" to play a role, you're not good at that role. Certain perks are extremely helpful, but to say you can't play without it makes it a crutch, and good players don't need crutches.
---
BDSM doctor cosmetic. This is what we need.
---
&gt;But I'm serious. Like it's just free cosmetics for playing.
---
Except a whole track is paid only. No-one is saying anything is pay to win. Even BHVR made that clear. What people are unhappy about is that the choice element of a cash shop is being taken away, and that people may now have to play far more than they initially wanted to to get specific items.
---
I don't get it
---
Wasn't the tomes for the archive, and not the battle pass though? They are two different things.
---
&gt; Actually, I was commenting to NYoah Who stated " The combination of both but mainly his rudeness " as toxic. Not sure if told you I repied to you but if so my reply was to Nyoah
---
It shows them normally on the ground. Not highlighted like bloodhound,but they are still there.
---
Ah, my bad then. Apologies!
---
Jojo‚Äôs reference
---
TBFH
---
Maybe that's what they meant on the livestream when they said "we have things to reveal that you didn't even know that you wanted".
---
Not a problem. I may have clicked on replay to the wrong comment.
---
Salty survivors :D :D :D
---
Killers haven‚Äôt gotten any good perks in long time. 
---
Next killer ghostface 
---
Has useless perks (having no terror radius in a chase might be good for pig but that‚Äôs where the good stops) 
---
Plague
---
Maybe corrupt intervention but it‚Äôs still overshadowed by ruin 
---
Legion 
---
Same as ghostface, discordance might be good for a gen stopping build but that‚Äôs all.
---
yEaH gUYs We nEEd oUr unCoUNterAbLe fReE hIt PerK!!
---
Reminds me of the legion rework, his cooldown is initially 4 seconds and with both the cooldown addons it's not even reduced to 3 seconds, I think it might be 3.2 or something. It's a difference but that's both your addon slots for less than a second off your cooldown.
---
Yeah, this is totaly true. Maybe they could do something that other games do: lower the price to a point where it is barely a barrier. Botters will usually pass since they don't feel like paying that price for every bot, but hackers will probably still become a bigger problem since there is a lower penalty, still, since there is a penalty, it will most likely turn down some potential hackers
---
killer mains need to STFU. PSA.
---
Reeeeally hoping one day in the future we get a way to either craft low tier items into high ones or some way to sell addons for a fraction of their BP cost on the web. I never use flashlights maps or keys.
---
Mount ormond for me personally, since the outlines of the gens are barely visable with all the white 
---
&gt;&lt;
---
As a solo survivor player I escape roughly the same amount whether I use MoM or not. Survivors managed before Ash and they will manage after it gets changed. It comes in clutch sometimes but the requirements need to change as you don‚Äôt even need to do anything in order to be rewarded with the extra free hit.
---
Moris are great, we need more stuff like tombstones!
---
Only reason this worked is because she was using prayer beads. So the spirit has no wooshing sound at all.
---
i bet theres another jacket underneath his hoodie
---
Jesus it sounds like Freddy now has the most flavour holy shit
---
Are you serious?   Well that just made it easy then!
---
But I have a programming exam tomorrow!
---
Wholesome content
---
If this game came close to dying they would just have to open source it and it's popularity would probably skyrocket.
---
Insidious should have gave it away, Claudette is just unobservant or playing without sound
---
As a killer main, i'm playing more survivor lately, just to become an overall better player for both sides. And i've encountered this already several times. And maybe it's a douchebag move, but when i'm looping (or at least try to), and i notice that my team's picking daisy's instead of doing gens, i'm forcing the first one i can find to take over the chase by leading the killer to him and then hide away. And then find a gen to do it by myself. 
---
Because if everyone is being a potato, i'll do my best to avoid being served next to a couple of fries.
---
How am I supposed to use Ace in the hole otherwise?
---
Why are you being toxic instead of seeing the problem with survivors?
---
The only fun they can have is being toxic once they get bored of the main survivor objective.
---
A short 30 minute break wouldn't hurt right!
---
I've farmed with survivors after half the team dced and they'll still complain about a "boring game." Sorry I didn't stomp you and your one teammate with 5 gens left, I guess.
---
Freddy with brutal strength, barbecue, ruin and monitor and abusw, no addons and ivory mori
---
WAAAAAAZZZZZZZUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPP

Ouch, might as well delete this since no one agrees.
---
Early morning DBD on the East Coast is causing a lot of problems. Had a match with like 150 ping going totally fine until the Myers downed me, then we started lagging and rubberbanding around the map before he disconnected. 
---
It gave me the escape cred and just enough to pip, putting me from rank 5 to rank 4. Then after about 15 sec in lobby, it displayed the killer disconnecting again and also said I disconnected, took away my escaping the trial bonus, and now I've depipped to 2 pips below rank 4, but I still have about 8k BP despite having the disconnect label. Is this an exploit from the killer or is something up with the game itself?
---
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1758877050
---
Mad Grit is alright for a basement build
---
I agree with this, it also doesn‚Äôt help that some survivors can get extremely cocky when they‚Äôre in the lead and will just piss the killer off.
---
Piping
---
Just a little bit
---
I wouldn‚Äôt expect a sale until Halloween if that‚Äôs the case. I‚Äôd still say game pass is a better rout to go anyways, 10 bucks for over 300 games sounds fair to me
---
Well, I suppose the entity just gave him the power and the features of the bull. Who the entity gave most of the killers their powers is honestly a good question
---
"Killers haven't had a good perk in a while, give me a free mori but then don't nerf that because we haven't had a good perk in a while"
---
This isn't even a good attempt at a good argument for not balancing broken garbage.
---
Do you have anything in mind on how I should change them a little bit?
---
I love doing that hahaha
---
Amen
---
Same, I cosplay as movie Leatherface where a bunch of random strangers wander into my home so I chainsaw all of them and make sure they die.
---
If a teammate is far away you just stay injured and do gens, if you hear the killer come can just go to the pallets.
---
Fuck off, the  perk is overpowered and extremely toxic in design, it punishes the killer for playing anyone besides Billy, Huntress or Nurse.
---
If you need a 3rd health-state to win, you are shit at the game.
---
This is one of the biggest reasons why The Spirit is my favourite killer to play, the mind games are ridiculous and her ability and addons are amazing
---
I know you are voicing your own opinion and I do agree I too like to play chill. However there are killers out there who dont feel the same way, they play super toxic they camp tunnel and just keep downing you so the entity can sacrafice you for EGC.
---
You're a liar. You were using an eboni mori. Show us your build.
---
Redemption for having an adorable cat for a profile pic
---
As a Hag main,I personally use Hex:Ruin,BBQ&amp;Chili,Monitor&amp;Abuse ad either Sloppy Butcher or Make Your Choice.I usually use Dried Cicada and Rusty Shackles and trap places where survivors have to travel, especially looping areas like pallets ad windows.
---
MoM is my favorite perk as of now and I know it's strong, M1 killers can't avoid it.
---
It does need a slight nerf, not sure how much i like the one Devs are proposing but eh. I got to r1 with and without it so honestly if it's nerfed into the ground it wouldn't effect me that much. 
---
I use it with DH, Adren Self-care or DS just so i can cheese killers for a long time. Killer mains probably hate me lol
---
Dude... That claudette has literally 2 iq... Or 2 hours in that game
---
Idk why this is fueling up so a sense of fear inside of me
---
WAZZUUUUUPPPPP
---
It's pretty good again now, especially for Legion (who has the easiest time building up stacks). It's good on ambush killers, like Wraith or Hag, who can get a quick first hit in, and then be able to get another hit in. It takes people off guard when you're at the max 40%, they'll run for a window or something that they don't have time to make.
---
Losing stacks on the obsession is a problem, though, as selectively engaging the obsession is a pain to do.
---
Those are not killers, they are a waste of oxigen.
---
I second this, DG is a really fun game. Currently playing it as i give DBD a little break. It's refreshing.
---
I would rip the jacket off her and then burn it infront of this monster
---
Rainbow six seige does this and its doing great for them
---
Gens you doin ?
---
Can I have the format please it's amazing
---
Didn't the Devs say they loved the reddit community and it's the first place they go to look for feedback?
---
Yeah...rip.
---
Recently I've been having an issue where the game will restart my computer without warning. No Blue Screen, just straight up shutting down and restarting my computer. Its also completely random as to when it will restart it. Most times, it will restart before I can even reach the main menu screen. The few games I've managed to play, I've had my computer be restarted in the middle of games, in the game end screen, and the worst case, when i've been killed but before I reach the sacrificed screen (basically loosing everything that I take into the game, and all the bloodpoints earned from it)
---
I've got about 40 hours logged into the game, but its only started happening for a little less than a week now. Ever since it has started, I've tried everything suggestion that I've seen. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, Verified Integrity of game files, Updated my drivers and computer, downloaded WhoCrashed and tried addressing whats caused it to crash, but none of them have worked for me.
---
The weird thing is (and the reason why im posting) is that Dead By Daylight is the only game that seems to do this. Every single other game that I have on my PC runs fine and doesn't shut down my computer, except DbD.
---
Sorry if it doesn't exactly belong here, but I need help.
---
M8 if You getting 4 escapes everytime you play killer, you definitely need to camp or tunnel or something to insure that 1k.

Ok

I never go to my totems anymore.

Not because I don't wanna give away totem location.

But because I only ever play with 2 perks anyway
---
Maybe they were SWF?
---
Sad, was hoping bunnygirl Feng would be reported as well
---
Well, just consider that these situations happen less frequently than getting M1 hit by the killer.
---
Rank 20 survivors LUL very well played my friend
---
If they were, wouldn't you expect them to average their ranks out and get a killer around that rank? If they did they it should be around rank 7.
---
Crazy world we living in.
---
I 100% agree
---
The theme of kate is more fitting for the bubba theme, she's a country musician, wich fits with the Texas theme (im from Europe, i have know idea what's it like there, don't judge), although i don't know from where the clown is.
---
An effective team leader delegates. If I see Dwight hiding in the corner not operating to his full potential, I delegate the task of distracting the killer to him so I can do what I do best - hitting those great skill checks.
---
really??? no one said Ormond???
---
This perk counters ALREADY WEAK m1 killers the most and is 100% avoidable by strong killers. I don't get it how the same kind of people can say MoM doesn't need a neft AND that they are bored of playing vs billy all the time. MAKE UP YOUR MIND. You either all run a perk that makes playing weak killers even less enjoyable OR you let people play them

---
Bloodletting cost me way more money :( 
---
(they should do a killer shirt collection in the cosmetic store tho)
---
ikr
---
What sucks is it happens to both sides. I had a killer game when I was rank 7 and all the survivors were rank 12 or higher. It was a bloodbath. I felt really bad once I saw the rank disparity in end game.
---
i fear no man but that dog .....it scares me
---
3 gens they did something at least. As of late they don't even go for saves.
---
They are swf probably. Matchmaking seems to favor the lower ranked survivor. I'm rank 7 and when I play with my rank 20 friend it pairs us with killers around rank 16 usually.
---
Got it on second anttempt... Left some survivors to die but it was worth it
---
bbq and chili and hex ruin
---
I swear some people will pull cable out of their wall just to not let you get the archievement.
---
Unrelated but as a killer main I'll never really get used to how it feels attacking Ash.
---
1 shot huntress build
---
Wtf is this
---
OMG! We won't stop untill we get that feng min outfit. I guess we need it.
---
BBQ is average on most killers and only used for bloodpoints. Nurse spirit and billy are the only killers bbq is really good for. Ruin is not essential, otherwise every game where is broken immediately would be a guaranteed 4 man escape. Not denying they're good perks, but definitely not essential.
---
It's not too bad on Spirit. Especially if your just learning her.
---
Just gotta love those urban evasion clauds hiding in bushes
---
If only low ranks be trash. I meet some awful rank 5-6 survivors all the time.
---
I would love to have a gamemode like this in the game.
---
offtopic but
---
this is the first time I ever seen somebody run beast of prey
---
Open handed does it.
---
Someone once told me, being altruistic is probably the stupidest thing you could possibly do.  The way the game is now, you're forced to be selfish because people are innately going to be selfish with their lives.
---
Honestly this game is a load of bullpatootie because you don't really get anything besides more blood points for winning.

dude its achievements. not even that big. they just asking to make it easier to achieve

Each of them have the Gen perks which are nice.
---
The aura reading ghost perk can be good on small TR killers.
---
But we don't have a rally good perk true
---
I don't think I need to. Your downvotes as well as your justification says enough.
---
Good mori what?
---
Once when I was rank 11 with some rank 13-15 team members we got matched with a rank 3 killer and got our asses handed to us. It was not fun at all.
---
Depends on if he sits there with the saw readied or not. If bubba doesnt have the saw ready at all times it'll work because the speed boost of the first hit is enough to get of range on the second unless you're in the basement.
---
Um... This is a joke right?
---
It's a perk with 0 counter play if your a M1 killer. There is literally nothing you can do to stop it from going off. How is that fair?
---
No, No I think they should. Like I said, they do it as a joke and do it because others are toxic to them. The only reason people think they're toxic is that they have the skill to do it to toxic killers and get away with it. They deserve to be Fog Whisperers because they have been players of the game since the beginning.
---
I'd argue that on the cosmetic front, its a good idea. If you start off with nothing/very little unlocked, paying $10 to earn your way to a bunch of cosmetics rather than paying for one set is a good deal
---
That‚Äôs why decisive has been a key part in my load out since they fixed it. 
---
That being said, I also play killer (on ps4) and I really do try to play fair - the only time I ‚Äúcamp‚Äù is when I‚Äôm doing daily as Leatherface or Clown and I‚Äôm struggling. Please let me hit you and you can go!!!
---
But holy shit, ps4 survivors are assholes. They‚Äôre usually the ones who go out of their way to send nasty messages even through ‚Äúfriend‚Äù requests and they abuse bugs and mechanics like killer shack window, or they purposely deny you points during party streamers or hallowed blight etc. 
---
Believe me, I know killers can be massive jerks (I‚Äôm still bitter af about this pudding Leatherface who camped, tunneled, slugged, did everything nasty during double blood points when I put in my only streamers.) But ps4 survivors are far from innocent.
---
Ah, that's sooner than I thought to be honest. Thanks for the heads up :)
---
Well i would say make the survivor achievements harder. BUT NO DOUBLE PIP cuz getting double pip as survivor is even more annoying.
---
Gotta get those bloodpoints, and I don't have anything else viable yet. Unless I wanna run NOED.
---
no
---
I thought they added them, I‚Äôve been seeing double pallets again.
---
You're welcome ^^
---
Yeah suege is a good example
---
I wanted to do that, but felt like people would insta down vote becasue of it.
---
I had often games where when I was on my first hook after a 10 min chase, all of my teammates got downed one after another. I‚Äòm supposed to have two chances on the hook but with such teammates I don‚Äòt even have one.
---
Even though survivors are a new breed of toxic special to this game only...
---
Were all in this together! We've had a meta of unscared survivors for too long being so arrogant around the killer. The fear is going to come back bit by bit.
---
The games meant to be tense and oh fuck when being chased, not oh here's baby killer plenty of safe pallets I'll tbag and run him for days!
---
It's so much more satisfying as a survivor feeling the heat and excitement that you are maybe the only one to get away from this freak of a killrr
---
but 25% or 27% are still low. If it would be +25% and +50% it would be great.
---
I'm currently running a fuck generators build. But i havent had a single tier 2 perk appear in my web
---
To me, he isn't even fun to play. People get things done in your face, having to wait to interact with others, and the game just drags on and on. I like slow down but Freddy is a bit too slow for both sides
---
You can pick and choose from a selection, but all perks are about making gen progression impossible. 
---
Distressing is a must as the extra range in treatment mode will constantly spread madness. Then you can choose 3 perks from ruin, over charge, huntress' lullaby, unnerving presence etc. Use add ons that make your terror radius even bigger in treatment mode or use pink add ons instead. 
---
Lastly, burn an offering to go to the saw map as this is the smallest map and survivors will practically always be in your terror radius. 
---
As madness increases, the skill checks will become more random on the screen. Coupled with the above perks it gets its name as skill checks become impossible to hit.
---
I already know you‚Äôre a new player because you didn‚Äôt even do your research to see that the clown has 4 bottles by default 7 with both addon slots used.
---
She was giving you a boost to rank 1 :D

How dare you don't DC when you hook. Your camping. How dare you go after the weaker person you tunneker. How dare you don't give me the hatch
---
Have you even watched the livestream? They are giving us everything we're asking for and more on year 4. I think that's looking out for the game and community. They're even bringing in dedicated servers, which costs a TON of money.they wouldn't do it if they were greedy, as the killer being host works fine enough for the most part.
---
WHAT DO THEY MEAN?

Hex: SATs are just around the corner

Me and a random did that vs a Michael. It took 20 mins. I got hate mail from him saying ‚Äúfix n hide that‚Äôs all you do, you‚Äôre pathetic.‚Äù He kept repeating that I was a ‚Äúfix in hide‚Äù and that I was worthless. But we escaped... so...
---
I also double piped at rank 6 and got 152% on gen repair. So it‚Äôs not like I was being lazy.
---
They did
---
But you didnt even bother to go to the announcement post to read
---
Matthew McGoat best dead by daylight player in all of South Korea
---
What ?
---
Its to sort of split up the playerbase, really though it just means you end up usually somehwat around your rank. The game priotizes getting you in a game over rank
---
Okay let me explain what I am trying to say a little bit better. Yes each emblem gives you a description, but how are those points determined if not by bloodpoint? That's where I say 
---
"SHENANIGANS!!!" This system is a scam in that case, because there is no breakdown with hard numbers so to say, It's all just a "guesswork" system. Programming wise  how does the game determine that you deserve these medals? If the killer looks at you and you dont activate a chase each time is that going to give you a red? Because, that is basically what the description says the programming will do. I did not pip this game, the killer let me out. Thank god, awesome killer. But that being said, HOW IN SAM HELL DID I GET A -1!!!
---
Something like that.  The sharper the angle you're facing down, the less distance you will travel.  This can be manipulated mid blink as well, so if you're looking straight down then start facing more straight forward in the middle of the blink, it can push her out a little further as you're mid travel.  I have no clue if it works the opposite way, where you start out facing forward and then start looking down mid blink.  Don't guess I've ever really tested it.
---
There's a few guides on nurse on YouTube that may be able to explain or demonstrate it better than I can.  I only know this to be the case from messing around while playing her.
---
1.  If you can get a hit on someone without using your power, you can use it to catch up them quicker and end the chase.  
---
2.  When you are using your power, you can still bump into/body block survivors.  If you bump into something that isn‚Äôt really there, immediately end your power and swing at them.  
---
3.  Scratch marks can be difficult to follow sometimes, so try paying attention to the grass moving/birds flying and any other interactions while using your power.  
---
4.  One of the biggest things for Spirit is to use your ears a lot.  If you‚Äôre chasing an injured person in your power, listening to their groans of pain is on of the best ways to tell where they went or if they tried to double back on you.  This can be countered completely by Iron Will but not a lot of people run it.
---
i'm more like the guy you invite to the party and i stand in the corner quietly just drinking the whole time
---
Holy shit, the patience.. :D
---
It has/had a very good use during events, Survivor's used to run 4 man sabo teams during events making it impossible to get any special hooks, HT really helped. Then Bhvr changed it so you couldnt sabo special hooks.
---
Mettle is stupid in its current state. Id rather they change it to deathook rather than just make it a dead perk but it cant stay as is
---
Damn dude that sucks and yeah they could probably help me out if it happens again, if I can reach them that is lol. Thanks for the help!
---
Run, Meg! RUN!
---
Lmao just dont kill survivors lmao bb killer
---
It's still so funny how Insta blinds were ignored until he did that and then suddenly they got patched.
---
Prob never had on orgy did you
---
It's a thing of beauty for the killer, not so much for the survivor. Look up Monto impossible skill check doc on YouTube to see the chaos in action.
---
Yeah unfortunately.  Truly I think it should be highlighted like Bloodhound because currently they don‚Äôt deserve to be Ultra Rare as there pretty useless.
---
Just make Moris a basic ability for killers only usable on the last survivor alive.
---
Question: is his forehead damage because he hits victim in the head with a mallet?
---
Julie is just as fucked up as he is, I could see her being fine with it / joining them
---
Haha, I can imagine. I play both pretty equally. I will give that a check!
---
Darn, I was gonna ask how the 4th person died, but I didnt bother, but I know bleeding out doesn't count, I just didnt realize
---
And of you Take insta hatchets they still complain...
---
Ghostface does that a lot
---
I concur.
---
&gt; You don't level up a killer you don't play
---
Lots of people do exactly that for Leatherface. I agree with the rest of your post though.
---
I would prefer whispers over BBQ personally. BBQ is good information but it‚Äôs not reliable at all, it has so many counters. But I still have like 100 million BPs to grind out, so BBQ it is.
---
How is he smurfing? I doubt it's a new account considering the perks. If you mean deranking, that's also impossible to do now short of intentionally throwing games over and over to derank. You can't DC to derank anymore, you'll just get the pips back whenever you relog. It's more likely that they just haven't played through a rank reset or two. It's not that hard to get those perks considering two of them you can grab on Hag. Also, how is BBQ on Hag worth complaining about? She's not exactly able to capitalize on it as much as some other killers.
---
That got fixed FYI
---
That‚Äôs the joke. I have no clue, it‚Äôs really weird
---
Dont think it‚Äôs directed at you, so much as the match itself. I agree they could‚Äôve tried being positive about it, but no matter what a 1v2 is gonna be boring.
---
If it does happen then hopefully it is only between console players.

Wow so I get called gay as an insult but get removed for using the word degenerate? Nice double standards.
---
I think the survivor ones are fine as they are. There's not really much more you can do to make it more difficult without it being extremely annoying. The killer ones simply need to be to kill all four survivors. It took me wayyy too many tries as Myers to get adept because even though I'd kill them all I wasn't double pipping. I eventually got it by farming with the remaining survivors but I don't think that's healthy gameplay wise for such an achievement.
---
not really
---
Nope. Still shit.
---
A lot of people like to play Scratched Mirror, in which case, you have 3 perk slots.
---
And when all 4 survivors see you have it they immedietely begin looking for it
---
Ya but I need those precious bloodpoints
---
This made me so *mad*
---
Lets work together as a community this time.
---
Did they change that? Always thought the Spirit emitted the woosh regardless.
---
So yes, now it's totally useless and Bill has only two perks now ahah poor Bill..
---
last one but 2 or more kills
---
So the survivors are still working on the gens which aren't blocked?
---
Different people learn at different speeds.
---
Damn I wanna try this
---
Let the downvotes commence, I swear this group is so killer sided.
---
we were all following you to get the unhook or a flashlight save !
---
Its possible, unlikely.... but possible
---
I played that game in party chat... I know if there was proximity chat I'd be talking so mad shit to the killer while they chased and hooked me lol
---
rank 8-20
---
I'm sure it will be platform dependent yeah, simply because it would probably be more effort to do it cross-platform. Who knows though.
---
Killer's perks are stronger than Survivor's
---
Isn't there a 5 second key that only opens it for 5 sec?

Thank you!! üíñüíñ
---
[rate mine plz](https://i.imgur.com/LldgcOx.png). also is there a reason to prestige? I just started playing again and I am kind of wary on losing all my items and perks
---
And killers keep wanting buffs due to SWF, not realizing solo survivors are the ones getting screwed harder than SWF.
---
So you're saying killer should get their 4 base perks, then be allowed a few hex perks on the side? That seems really unbalanced.  I've been seeing more and more people work through ruin making it almost useless. Killers keep running ruin its gonna be the norm and survivors will just fight through it and become beast at hex skill checks...
---
Bruh I've had games where 3 gens would pop at the same time not even 2 minutes in haha
---
As someone who plays survivors solo, it's pretty much a coin toss in terms of whether my teammates are potatoes or know how to click M1 and space. I once looped a killer for ~4 minutes, there wasn't even a Ruin in this game, but my teammates somehow didn't complete a single damn gen in that time.
---
I plan to colourise all my drawings when i move to my tablet when i get a pen. The dress it gonna be olive with a dark green dot pattern
---
I got called gen camper haha
---
Trapper- Iridescent Jaws - When a survivor is caught in a trap they are afflicted with the following afflictions for 5 minutes -
---
Broken
---
Blindness
---
Exhausted
---
Haemorrhage 
---
Hindered 
---
Mangled
---
Tombstone molecule
---
yeah most games they wait for you just to point and tbag before leaving haha
---
I'm starting to see more and more nurses on ps4
---
People are putting the time into learning her. I know a guy who is beast with her he can take my whole team out in like a minute.. good thing hes my friend lol.
---
The spirit could still be looking at you while using her power and make spine chill light up.
---
Gen doing you?
---
Tryhard response, heels noted.
---
Gen you?
---
You should have let nea go!
---
Running doesn't do anything either, she'll just use her power and catch up for a free hit.
---
Question 1;
---
- No you cannot break a survivor in the dying state or someone who is on the hook. you can only break survivors if they are healthy or injured. 
---
Question 2;
---
- A survivors infection only progresses if they do any action whether this is moving or doing a channel action. The infection progresses faster for survivors who run compared to survivors who walk. It takes a while for a survivor to break if they get infected and just run around. Not sure exactly the time.
---
The stock market crash of the 1990‚Äôs, Colorized.
---
How could the killers be chill when the survivors rarely are themselves lol
---
It's a 50/50 because you have 0 indicator of her ever using her power.
---
If you are running you are leaving scratches and making sound, it's entirely in her favor.
---
50% is a lot as well.  
---
You need to recover fully to get 50% of your wiggle bar. Jumping in a locker seems way too easy to do for 50% wiggle.
---
Wack
---
*whooooosh*
---
I do bully people who teabag I'd say you got really lucky and I wish I could have seen it.. fair play
---
They used a Haddonfield offering; they deserve it.
---
It's not a mind game, you have nothing to go off of and she can hear you running/breathing.
---
It's a 50/50 guess if she's phasing, and when she DOES phase the situation is entirely in her favour because she can hear you/see scratches, which you are just hoping she's bad and deaf. That's why playing against spirit is awful.
---
I wisch i could see a Video of this.
---
Yes I've been noticing a lot of dead zones on a few auto haven maps.  But basically on all the maps. Pallets are getting less and less.. I feel like they took out a bunch from the game map... also. Lerys is full of unsafe pallets. 
---
They keep nerfing survivors, they're gonna have a bunch of killers and not enough survivors to play.
---
This makes me wonder why I can't ever get a decent item and add-ons in a game.
---
I wish I would have recorded, it was a nice drink aswell.
---
And Kate
---
Majority of killers in this game let everyone escape to play newer survivors that can't loop so they had to make rank 20 impossible to get to.
---
Free grasp escape is different than a 3-second stun.  
---
That'd make Head On the same as pre-nerf DS, in my opinion.
---
That's still two add-ons to give Jigsaw boxes a 28% chance of triggering a skillcheck every second or so.
---
I'm personally struggling to think of an add-on that could be more useless to the Pig.
---
Wait, smokey is black, so he technically said the N-Word...
---
[Heres the stream clip where they breakdown everything about him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSwwCj85-oA)
---
Obession might choose maybe
---
I'm still having trouble getting the 4 kills in 1 game let alone, getting it specifically with tombstone Myers...
---
I don't put too many points into my killers so they all have like 1 Ebony each, and everytime I try to go for the trophy it ends with 3 kills 1 DC.
---
Youre the worst
---
The person I got this from apparently.
---
As satisfying as that is and as much as I love your posts on here, I would say that body blocking an objective like that is too far. They might have been flashlight clicking or teabagging, but at the end of the day they're just playing the game with what the devs gave them. They weren't doing that exploit to trap you in a pallet or anything like that. I mean, if you think about it, you're basically exploiting blocking an interaction zone to get kills (which is something the devs clearly didn't like when they removed the same scenario for hooks).
---
tl;dr I love you, man, but I do feel you went a bit too far on this one
---
So (some) fan made cosmetics will be put in the game? Quick, somebody with talent make bikini Jane.
---
Ooooh okay. I retract my whoosh.
---
This happened to me like 4 times yesterday. Funny enough. I was playing as Ash
---
yeah because this is quite literally ridiculous i don‚Äôt have to use brain cells on you if i don‚Äôt want to
---
It highly depends on numers
---
Or you can just accept that there is room for improvement and try to become better killer instead of trying to get kills with cheap tactics?
---
&gt;Any time the the devs try to make this true, survivors cry literal oceans.
---
Examples?
---
Loving the new Huntress album!
---
Good. Fuck Haddonfield, it‚Äôs a broken map and I refuse to play it.
---
I drew it without thinking too much, and it was really quick too so yeah :)
---
[Woosh redacted]
---
It‚Äôs an advertisement for Axe body spray
---
Adrenaline is useless. Every killer uses noed now
---
3. Less efficient for survivors. Each survivor working on a gen past the firdt is 10% reduced overall. 80 sec for 1 - 28.57 for 4. Negated with prove thy self*
---
What would it being ethereal mean for menchanics
---
Okay. I didn't knew that. Good to know. Until now I mainly relied on Spine Chill and never looked around carefully.
---
Imagine the survivor doesn't want to farm. He just wants to play the game. And the killer and other survivors are just farming. The killer refuses to kill him. He can't complete generators because the killer follows around and breaks them for points. His team isn't helping him at all. The survivor wants to find another game but there's no way to leave other than disconnecting.
---
This survivor is basically held hostage and I've been there multiple times, it is extremely frustrating, especially when you're the last survivor alive.
---
I like how his shirt has the hood, not the jacket! Unexpectedplottwist
---
Well I've been playing since August of last year and it wasnt bad as it is now.
---
Deni soggy, uno?
---
Influx of players perhaps. And the desire to do better so they look for builds and lo behold most videos or forums will say run ruin or get gen rushed.
---
I hope they remember you
---
Groovy.
---
As a spy main every time i go for a backstab i need to roll a bunch of dice and get a yatzee,a natural 20,get an UNO,double six twice and if god wills it,i'll connect the hit,then i need to roll twice as much to hope it is a backstab
---
Using DH to make a killer whiff is not using DH in the most efficient way.
---
When someone D/Cs it honestly makes me smile because I know that me catching them bothered them THAT much. I prefer if people don't leave, because it is unfair to their teammates... But still.
---
When I play killer and a survivor DCs, I always let the last survivor leave through hatch. Or the survivor that is clearly doing the most work if that happens. I feel like it‚Äôs only fair. Maybe you as a survivor and I (as a killer) would get alongüòÇ
---
That's what she gets!
---
That is not a doodle. That‚Äôs a fookin masterpiece
---
These are helpful. I tried playing her twice and could not get a single kill. I'm really bad at finding the survivors when I can't see them lol.
---
Tombstone myers is fun as killer, but feels overpowered as a survivor. I‚Äôve definitely hidden in locker before as the last survivor because it felt like there was no other way to play around the strategy or survive. But maybe it‚Äôs more difficult against a decent survivor team? I honestly wouldn‚Äôt know.
---
Agreed... preventing them from taking off the mask is fucked up. Imo... but whatever it takes to win..
---
Because you're bad at the game obviously..
---
Well I guess we are in agreement. Feels good, I support you as long as you support Pig.
---
Its RNJ. They literally showed on the 3rd anniversary stream that each map has like 20 different little sections that are randomly chosen.
---
I feel ya but, sometimes that's all I got because so many dead zones on the maps anymore.
---
This is beyond absurd, look at this. I'm not that great a Killer, I'm in the bottom half. I killed everyone, keeping them off the gens, I won chases, I smacked them down.
---
This shouldn't be THIS damn hard.
---
I agree with you, I had a rough day and needed a win I guess. I feel bad now. However knowing that there are people here that don't hate me made my day so thank you.
---
I'm always glad that I got my achievement against a SWF team full of Dwights that were plain high on the game.
---
Like, I even got two free stalk IN FRONT of the gens two Dwights were working at and they typed me how freaked out and stoned they were.
---
Thanks, stoned Dwights.
---
I always set a trap in one of the farthest corners of the map if I get a chance. One day it'll pay off.
---
You piped tho.
---
Also nearly impossible with Ruin. You can place 4 average survivors on a gen at 80% with Ruin and it'll be back down to 0% within 15 seconds.
---
Played a game against a SWF yesterday who all used Party Streamers and I thought it would be a fun game. Nope, two red ranks (I‚Äôm rank 11) a purple and their friend at 15 just bullying me and finishing gens in no time with 4 toolboxes.
---
So does adrenaline. And dead hard and a ton of other perks in the game in terms of rewarding failure
---
There are no words in the English dictionary capable of describing my current gratitude
---
Another dumbass reply by you. So close to putting your moronic ass on ignore. I lose brain cells by reading your post.
---

One person is saying Kate was designed for Leatherface and gets upvoted, the other is claiming Kate is bill's killer and gets downvoted.
---
Seems logical.
---
Also, can we please stop caring about Internet brownie points? Voting on posts is one of the reasons Reddit is a shitheap.
---
It's what she deserves.
---
I feel like having 2 might be a good balance, like if killer had TotH and Ruin you'd know that theres no NOED. If gens were easy to do, they might have NOED and Devour. If there's 3 lit totems they definitely have Haunted Grounds.
---
Lol haddonfield swf with balanced landing and instaheals is the most scummy survivors can possibly get

---
yup. Just kill a brother while you can
---
Me too :(
---
no way, they played the game and so did he. they probably body blocked hooks so he just stopped them from doing that again
---
Yeah I just want to have fun by playing the Nurse, She seems to be a great character
---
He broke the bloodpoint economy!
---
I feel like Killers perks are stronger but harder to use correctly (besides maybe a few) while survivors are above average but have more chance of being used.
---
I think the hardest is to pre determine where the survivors are running
---
It was fair..
---
I accept that.
---
wait a minute that's just shao khan but with doc on his face XD
---
If you say so.
---
Go play ‚Äúlast year‚Äù game u can also hit and kill killer :p
---
Well technically Reiko but he impersonates Shao Kahn üòâ well spotted
---
I did pip, but I was going for Adept Trapper.
---
which requires me to double pip; but the requirements where I'm at is absurd. I needed 2 Iridescent and 2 Gold to get 'merciless' right now.
---
That's insane.
---
Now that you say it, I agree more with you, and they did block hooks.
---
I can't understand wtf it Is with You Chinese Bunny Hentai liking people. I play Survivor and killer, Feng and Claud Are the characters I hate most because They Are Toxic Dicks.
---
Just because they're standing still in the basement doesn't mean they're not playing.
---
Not gonna lie, I think the EGC timer should be 1hour for these special people, so I can slug them and go eat dinner while he loses his points or his time.
---
EW1 Myers is so much fun. scratched mirror spooks every game if I could
---
Lifesaver.
---
His perks are no joke lol
---
You dont need hag for ruin, just use the store
---
Guys why as a killer i cant see pallets?
---
And then at the end, he Leroy Jenkins' at the killer, rather than taking the hatch
---
I love seeing people with Saw knowledge here, but don't you think 50% is to quick for him.
---
I had better luck doing tombstone with the Myers memorial. Doing perma tier 3 with it makes the survivors want to quit more often. Tombstone only means you can sometimes snag kills by getting tier 3 in a chase
---
She is so cute. Can't stop watching at her. &lt;3
---
Can't wait until they change it. MoM is just an easy escape for getting whacked a few times.
---
They don't have the same last name so no
---
Played last night as Killer, I kept seeing the same survivor over and over but didnt see any of the other 3. Had hooked her twice and literally stopped chasing her if i saw her. The only gen with progress was the one she was working on.
---
Long story short, 3k'd the other 3 and dropped her by the gate at the end. I felt bad for her.
---
Head On works fine. The issue is that the stun is based on where the killer is when you first jump out.
---
You are actually the biggest cunt in the known universe if you hide in a locker and refuse to let a Tombstone Myers get the Evil Within achievement.
---
If you want to double pip with Trapper you sort of can‚Äôt use his traps. They destroy your chaser Emblem.
---
She obviously got married
---
I am happy for the fact we have the cutest game character in gaming history, Amanda Young.
---
A majority? Citation needed. How would you even know that's what they're doing? That's a lot of work just to derank. I'm pretty sure almost no one does that because there's far easier methods to start on a "fresh" account, anyway.
---
It kinda sounds like you just have a chip on your shoulder on this subject. I feel like you're the type to say the majority of killers sweat out every game as much as possible with OP perks and add-ons, tunnelling to death and facecamping. Am I wrong? Yet the majority is also letting everyone escape to derank at the same time? 
---
If someone said the same thing to me about the majority of survivors deranking to bully new killers it'd sound equally ridiculous. And this example is probably not the tactical deranker you're describing.
---
If u kill all survivors by hooking them 3 times and do good at chases you double pip
---
Or maybe she is a super possesive psycho.
---
But then again, given the kind of guy Frank is and the kind of relationship they have, most likely he cheated on Julie a lots of times, I even bet he even banged Susie more than once.
---
Dude haddonfield is so not broken its crazy. You just suck if you think its broken
---
Or knowing Ash, It was a 1 night stand and she never met the father.
---

Against tier 2 and 3 you won't need spine chill because he has a terror radius.

Thank you for linking this, I didn't know who it was.

As a nurse main the hardest thing to master is to land right behind them in certain situations because the nurse can‚Äôt turn quick enough on console, so unless you‚Äôre behind them you wouldn‚Äôt be able to get the hit, even if your blink was on point.
---
Blink accuracy isn‚Äôt as hard as people make it out to be, it‚Äôs the easiest thing to land right on top of a moving survivor
---
The fucking roblox hex totem
---
Ok I see. Thank you
---
Because, despite being designed as a healer, solo Claudettes usually just crouch in corners, since she has some of the darkest and hardest to spot cosmetic, and ignore their teammates. 
---
That and she attracts the most toxic players to the point that more often than not Claudettes are just assumed to be toxic.
---
And If you run into a SWF of them then that's usually when the killer would stick on a toxic build too.
---
This is too relatable after playing with some friends on the free weekend. Thankfully only one sucker actually bought it to join me in miserable company.
---
Why people downvote this? This is funny as hell.
---
I got a message that I tunneled yesterday after I hooked a guy, got two more hooks, then they ran into me and DCed. Was really funny

Sooo you were camping those gens since the start and you expect them to fix those first? Like if they go for them since the start or at the end it doesnt change the outcome...the survivor just will earlier if they go for them first

Haha so Tru3

Here's the problem: I want Adept Trapper, the achievement for a 4K as Trapper.
---
But that also requires a 'merciless' killing, which you can only get if you double pip.
---
See the issue I'm having?
---
Yeah,  they do, don't you hear it every time he gets close?
---
Monto hype
---
Well, the Wailing Bell was a gift from the Entity, and his weapon is the skull and spine of his former boss, who he murdered, then ripped the skull and spine from before he was taken to the Entity's realm.
---
The typical load out is Ruin, Lullaby, Distressing, and Unnerving Presence.
---
The map offering is the jigsaw piece. 
---
Addons can be one of two choices: ‚ÄúCalm - Carter‚Äôs Notes‚Äù + ‚ÄúOrder - Carter‚Äôs Notes‚Äù or ‚ÄúCalm - Carter‚Äôs Notes‚Äù + ‚ÄúCalm II‚Äù
---
Double Calm addons plus distressing make your treatment TR approximately 53 meters. This also makes your punishment TR much smaller, allowing you to sneak up on a survivor. 
---
Calm plus Order makes survivors tier up madness faster and creates illusionary pallets where broken ones exist. This build is better for later game when survivors are trying to hide and avoid getting back into tier 3.
---
The only thing uncomfortable about it is what it does to my hands.
---
Yes you can. You can't see through the walls anymore.
---
Getting kinky I see.
---
Does Pig count aswell? I mean both have killed atleast one child.
---
Yes they nerfed the pig for some reason, traps can only be activated by generators, so if all the gems are completed already THEN a trap gets planted, it‚Äôs useless because it can‚Äôt activate anymore,
---
Yes, Do I agree with it? No. But it happend.
---
This also leads to a lot of wear and tear on controllers over time. I always try to press the button as lightly as possible but I still cringe. It adds nothing to gameplay and lag has killed me dozens of times.
---
Oh okay, is there a name for the part where she just disappears for a second every now and then?
---
Wow, gotta say, that if this is what one of your doodles looks, you really have impressive skills.

(I actually wasn‚Äôt thinking of ToS he said BM, it‚Äôs been FOREVER since I played that game.)
---
This. Also having to rotate to struggle. If they remove the mashing on hook, it removes hook suicide. So a huge positive comes from it.

Ideally you don't cleanse because if you cleanse, EVERYONE has to cleanse, because being Broken against the Corrupted Purge is far too dangerous to be a viable strategy, but everyone cleansing gives her decades worth of Corrupt Purge. I'd recommend running the perk Dead Hard (you should be running it already) to have more survivability while you're sick so you don't feel pressured to heal/cleanse right away.
---
This is called a buffer overflow / underflow. If the number is too small/big, it wraps around
---
I meant, Freddy was good?
---
Haha, right? This new emblem system has royally borked over some of the non-ranking achievements, and made them nearly impossible if you're higher up.
---
May I ask you what Rank you are as Killer?
---
I somehow feel like the tactic you described might not work in higher ranks.
---
I was thinking 5
---
Okay, no hook points but I get DC points and got you triggered enough to DC which is a heck of a lot more fun than any kind of points.
---
That's what makes it useless.
---
As you already have a slim chance of skillchecks triggering every few seconds the Survivor is using the box **without the add-on** and still have nearly the same chance (almost 3 to 1) of having relatively few skillchecks **with the add-on** there's no reason to use it.
---
You have no guarantee the add-on will do what it's supposed to do, and you could get as good or better results without it equipped.
---
If Jigsaw Boxes took far longer to search than 12-15.6 seconds (depending on add-ons) that 2% bonus might have a noticeable effect over time, but in their current state a 2% bonus isn't that significant.
---
Inno, I did rb him n3, but was attacked and healed!
---
Agreed, I assume that is with sprint burst right?
---
It's getting completely revamped as they said in the stream
---
You do you, but you wont pip much, you wont get many points, and people will hate you. It's a valid strategy but if you git even a little bit Gud, especially with Billy, there isnt a need to camp, you have a chainsaw to apply map pressure, use it.
---
If you just wait for someone to go for the save, that is kinda annoying for the survivors. If it works that great for you but in my experience all the gens will be done quickly.
---
when he was released, he was pretty good (got quickly bad tho)
---
I will ask the devs, maybe they agree.
---
He didn't play the game. He specifically says he just left his character there and went to get a drink to conpletely fuck over the survivors.
---
That said this entire post seems wayyy out of the park. Pretty much the epitome of an immensely toxic match, with every survivor being the worst a survivor can be, still somehow they all got downed and all of them got traps on their head and this was apparently such a snowball event that they ALL got downed and trapped and none of them had the time (or brains) to get their trap off, and then somehow, because I guess he was just following and watching them do boxes, the killer comes to the conclusion that ALL 4 of them need to be at the same box (I'm not even sure if that's possible but if so, they all had horrible luck since I think theres a 50% average chance to get it off at the first box you try based on an analytical post I saw here before). 
---
It just seems very "too good to be true" to me
---
y = (gengen^3)/2genx
---
Then you realise it‚Äôs because your a teammates are all Claudettes with urban evasion
---
Whats pip mean?
---
I say we get a petition ready
---
I see, sorry to hear that! But I still dislike playing with Fengs haha. I have nothing against playing AS A FENG though. She has some good perks.
---
This would be an amazing tattoo!!
---
I'm pretty sure they drop the act and have spirited debates on what is man's greatest hubris, thinking he can control nature or that he is master if his own destiny.
---
Then, of course, they get interrupted and resume their mute and unintelligible screeching to not draw attention
---
ICR
---
keep on a workin
---
What I don't get is that people seemingly don't care about his soft camping all the time.
---
Yes.  I've experienced this frustration as well, as I'm sure many of our fellow Fog Dwellers have.
---
I've said it before, &amp; it's worth repeating: commit yourself to helping the great escape, or get on the hook.  You are either a member of the team, or you're bait for the Entities hunters.
---
Which is the point
---
Lol you have one of the best map pressure abilities and instead use it to be an asshole. 
---
You're an idiot. Besides, any good survivor is going to bait you into the chainsaw for the unhook, then save the hooked survivor with Borrowed Time and then both will run away laughing.
---
Yeah unless you put it on beforehand
---
I agree it was a bad nerf. It is what made her so good for the end game
---
&gt;If u kill all survivors by hooking them 3 times and do good at chases you double pip
---
Here is the thing... Chaser emblem is not about "doing good" in chases but rather how many hits you land after the start of a chase.
---
I don't know the amount now but before the emblem tweak, killers needed to land **22 hits** within the first 15s of a chase to get Iridescent Chaser. 
---
With this being said, any killer that manages to down a survivor with less than two M1s is punished. Billy Chainsaw, Myers with EW3, Trapper catching people in his traps, etc.
---
Rebind it to something else like scroll wheel. Helped a lot for me. I agree that it's pretty bad game design to have a mechanic be purposely annoying. Not to mention the added wear &amp; tear on keyboards, controllers, etc.
---
I mean, you're not entitled to it. I do, however, help the killer get their trophies if they message me and ask nicely. Otherwise, it's fair game.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 too so I change my struggle button every now and again to triangle/square/circle to try and stop my x button from taking too much damage. It should be looked at by them though. However sometimes if i‚Äôm not paying attention I forget that i‚Äôve changed it and I die.
---
There has to be two mettle of mans for that to work though cuz mettle is an obsession perk.
---
Not really I chainsaw a lot of survivors as billy but I‚Äôve double piped about 97% of my games the past 3 months
---
I fear no man...
---
but those eyes...
---
it scares me
---
BHVR lied when they said this. Far less than 80% of cosmetics are available through shards.
---
This is awesome! Love the color scheme. I'd love to see more of these in your style, both killers and survivors. :)
---
 But I still see what you mean, can I see how you play ur games to see what you can improve to double pip? If you want to that is just want to help cause I know how hard adept is on killer sometimes
---
&gt;Not really I chainsaw a lot of survivors as billy but I‚Äôve double piped about 97% of my games the past 3 months
---
Good for you, I guess. Thankfully I don't have to argue because this is how the emblems work, no matter if you manage to pip with Billy using nothing but his chainsaw. 
---
[Emblems Explained - "The ELI5 version"](https://redd.it/8bvz68)
---
Shut the fuck up no one cares
---
Tru3 isn't even a good killer, he makes huge mistakes almost every game.
---
But all what they do is T-bag while I watch on the hook! D:
---
Woah there. I agree but still
---
I'm glad you managed to come to your senses
---
That was just fair. Love it! Please record it next time! :P
---
Honestly they might have depipped too. 
---
They grabbed two of the Survivors, one out of a locker and the other off a hook so they didn't have that many Chaser or Malicious points to start with; and those Chaser they had might have been lost because they camped the Survivors.
---
The 3k gives them a Silver Devout and the 5 gens gives them an Iridescent Gatekeeper, but that's only 6 points toward pipping and they were a Rank 6 Killer. Unless they got a Silver Malicious or higher they probably depipped.
---
That's why I usually just play KYF with them cause then we cab actually have fun and fuck around and play it like a horror game rather than the competitive game it becomes. I still play the game consistently, they don't really besides one or 2 so it's still fun to have silly killer builds.
---
Skill checks appear on certain actions, not all of them. Some of these include repairing generators, healing other people or yourself. Snapping out of it. They don‚Äôt appear on stuff like cleansing totems. And if you don‚Äôt already know during skill checks there are these little white parts. Those are called great skill checks and hitting them will increase the speed of whatever you‚Äôre doing.
---
It's ok, man, we've all been there. Just sit back, relax, and take a cathartic dive into your ebony mori stash for a bit lol
---
DCing makes for a fun and interactive experience.
---
Exactly. I could care less about the strategies he uses, but the problem is his flawed mentality. Being a popular streamer and all makes that mindset spread to other people. Then you see more killers making excuses when they are outplayed.
---
always xD
---
They‚Äôre downvoted it because they‚Äôve all been juked this hard at least once or twice :(
---
if I translate it directly from my language it's "passive disappearing", the yellow bon sai and purple flower add ons name it
---
I have like 8 seems like a lot of people will get oinked.
---
Man, I used to love watching him. Recently though the last few months it's unbearable. He is so damn cocky and acts like the best killer to ever grace the fog. It's  odd to me.
---
That's why Monto's good, he may call everybody potato but he makes good meme builds and doesn't get salty.
---
It upsets me how few downvotes you have. This should have been on the front page :(
---
i mean as rarely as it happens, everyone had has a couple times where they accidentally miss a tap or get distracted and tap too slow for a second and then end up dying on hook. i just dont think that is something that should ever happen. you shouldn't be able to die on hook because you missed some stupid spamming minigame
---
Imagine celebrating the fact that you died and lost all your bloodpoints instead of just dying.
---
I used to respond, but I found that it‚Äôs easier to just not say anything; you can‚Äôt argue with an idiot, because they will just bring you down to their level and beat you there.
---
Harder daddy
---
I don't advocate DCing on it, but a lot of the best killers in this game auto-DC on Haddonfield. So that's a bit of a moot argument and I'd focus more on how DCing is just bad for the game in general and only perpetuates more DCing on both sides.
---
something is bugging me about "probably they are swf"
---
Unfortunately hitting them whilst they are in a trap gives you nothing as well. It doesn‚Äôt count as a hit scoring event and you get no additional Bloodpoints. It‚Äôs just to make sure they either go into the dying state in case you don‚Äôt want to pick them up straight away, you want to reset the trap before picking them up or in case they struggle out and Dead Hard away or something just as you get to them. 
---
To be honest they need to change the way the Emblems work for individual killers if they want to keep pipping the way it is right now but I think in the Anniversary Stream they said that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening in the future.
---
?
---
no, how quickly you die on hook shouldn't rely on anything other than a timer. this is a worse mechanic than what we currently have
---
I had a game yesterday where I was just trying out hillbilly and somebody pallet-ed me and then flashlight-ed me so I chainsawed everyone and hooked everyone except for this rank 5 Dwight who after I downed him just laid there the entire game in sadness. I only let him go because he didn't give me any problems throughout the game and felt bad for him.
---
get your AIDS video out of here
---
Pandas the man
---
They said they'll revisit them as they rework MoM
---
You should've just played better /s
---
Yeah so many excuses, he thinks people care why he didn't 4k every match when in reality no one cares, my favorite was when he was crying about BT lmao
---
Meh, I think its all preference.   
---
They can all be toxic, which is what I hate, but they all have nice things about them too. Monto calls himself out on his own failings and is honest when he screws up, Noob is the most fun i'd say content wise and can expose his failings (sometimes), and tru is good at giving tips for killer and survivor comparatively.   
---
Winner? Pompey.
---
You get genrushed is whats up
---
You mean the task of getting him killed in 3 sec
---
It's a personal preference, but I find Spirit, Hag, Huntress, and Clown all more effective and fun than the Nurse.
---
Hah I just recently picked up a copy of the game for Xbox since it's free on game pass. Let's just say that I forgot how often that happens at rank 20. Finally get downed after a few minutes of decent looping, aaaand one guy is literally standing still in the corner
---
Not when released, it was very bad on release as it only applied a 5% penalty for a good skill check, it did not pause the generator repair.
---
He didn‚Äôt want to give them a chance to escape.
---
Survivors always spawn away from the Killer, why don‚Äôt totems spawn away from survivors?
---
Unluck.
---
I only watch monto, noob3 and panda nowadays.
---
My first game ever was against a tombstone myers who killed me in under 2 minutes since I had no fucking clue how anything worked
---
Why Nurse's? No competent survivor will heal against them.
---
The trapper has an addon that puts survivors in dying state, the clown has an addon that exposes them.
---
*But i guess we just ignore those now don't we?*
---
I had almost no help and I have a lot of trouble getting blood points for some reason
---
JoJo is the only anime that looks more and more appealing strictly based on the memes it produces
---
I‚Äôm doing very well with
---
Sloppy Butcher
---
Nurses Calling
---
Thanatophobia
---
BBQ
---
and it has been working surprisingly well.
---
I often use the add on that increases Frenzy time then try and get all 4 injured, it is very rare all the gens are completed (rank 10-5).
---
The spawns of both survivors and totems are random. Well, kind of. Survivors are completely random. Totems have one possible spawn on each individual tile.
---
You could flip that around and have survivors be the ones with static spawns, but that would present even worse balance issues. It's more balanced the way it currently is.
---
Relatable have a Nice Day.
---
I like Surveillance, it's a really good perk, especially on high mobility killers or even stealth killers. But I talked about Discordance and Corrupt Intervention here.
---
Save the best for last is very effective on Legion you can build up stacks very quickly with frenzy.
---
The same rank where toxic survivors no longer exist. Nowhere.
---
It depends what you want to do. If your goal is to apply pressure to survivors and prevent them from completing the gens, then I'd say Nurse's Calling, Discordance, Surveillance.
---
Surveillance tells you when a regressed gen has been touched by a survivor. If that gen is not near you, there's a good chance that someone is working on it. If you don't have any better options, you have a good chance of applying pressure here to slow the game down.
---
Discordance tells you where at least two survivors are. That's two people you can take off a gen at once. If you've already hooked or sacrificed someone, this is huge, but even if you haven't you can take at least half the team off gens  very quickly.
---
Nurse's applies pressure to people who are healing. It doesn't take pressure off gens, but it can show you survivors already in a vulnerable state, and possibly their teammates. People who are injured are usually a quicker down, which means you can hook faster and take someone else off a gen for the save (or remove someone from the game completely).
---
If you're looking for a tracking perk and love those sweet bloodpoints, then BBQ and Chili is your friend. You need to get hooks for BBQ to work, and you'll want to try to hook everyone at least once. BBQ has counters though, and at higher ranks, you're probably not going to see as much with it.
---
When I started, I used Whispers a lot. It was helpful in a way, but I don't think I'd ever use it again now that I understand the game a bit better. You need tier 3 Whispers for it to be of any use, and if you pay too much attention to it, it can cause you to waste too much time in an area when you should be doing other things. If I were to recommend an approach using Whispers, I would use it more to show me where people aren't.
---
I would recommend against using tracking perks that increase sounds or scratch marks. They can make it seem like survivors are closer to you than they actually are, which can be confusing.
---
Hope this has been helpful!
---
The lobby waiting time is normal. Are loading screens your problem? If they are too long a survivor may disconnect and send you to the endgame screen. Try waiting a bit before playing again , close and re open the game, restart your computer or whatever you play with or try reinstalling the game. Sorry if i can't help much, it did never happen to me.
---
Trapper becomes one of the most powerful killers if you have Iridescent stone and Bloody Coil combo... Very difficult to lose as trapper when survivors get hurt for disarming and the trap will just rearm anyway later.
---
They actually removed the ability to drop to stop a blind. There is a delay now.
---
If you don't have enough time to look up, you don't have enough time to drop them.
---
REIKO! 
---
Good to see a fellow MK fan here.
---
Yeah it definitely isn‚Äôt 1-2 hours of playtime, personally it took me like 1 week and a half to save up but every time I try I just spend it
---
I include them and that's why Trapper and Clown are B- and not C. 
---
But I put Trapper so high more because of his Iridescent Stone add-on, not Honing Stone.
---
This is when a disconnect is fine as its a waste of a match for everyone

And denied someone who was trying to force me into a corner their achievement. I play this game enough to not care about a single match would have netted me 9-15k BP...
---
10/10 pretty solid.
---
Uh oh watch out everyone, we've got a white knight. I'm literally shaking in my boots
---
Pigshould be lower.
---
I agree, but the new DS is worse. You could predict the old one, at least the obsession one. There's no counter to the new DS other than to assume everyone has it- you just smack someone doing a gen in your face, and they get a free escape.
---
I mean you are the one with negative karma. Never actually seen one one that bad at Reddit before. On a post you deleted, that was a crybaby post.
---
Trapper should be *at least* B+  
---
Wraith and Doc should be a tier higher, in my opinion.
---
Oh no! Gens take 12 seconds longer...
---
You can completely bypass Bloody Coil by 99% healing and disarm traps or if we has Iri Stone, just rush gens with Adrenaline. Also, these add-ons don't change the fact that you still can avoid his traps with Dead Hard or with their shitty hitboxes.
---
Do you think I give 2 fucks about karma?
---
Pretty good; although, I'd use Enduring + Spirit Fury instead of Haunted + Blood Warden
---
It'd suggest it gets slightly countered by prove thyself, since survivors are more likely to share gens, but you could run discordance to cross counter that.
---
A depip is a win in my book :)
---
as someone who doesn‚Äôt use noed. cleanse totems lol
---
Man this is a mess lol
---
Wow, spirit is even terrifying without prayer beads now.
---
You‚Äôve obviously never played csgo
---
Bricky's pretty good too, though he doesn't play dbd all that much.
---
Legion's add-ons succeed to be even more garbage than Pig's add-ons, so idk.
---
The more crutches you 'ave the more it 'urts when they're kicked out from unda ya.
---
Obviously not. It‚Äôs just a good general indicator of how bad you are at being a person online. And it‚Äôs accurate in your case. Something I‚Äôm very sure translates to your real life. Either way, if I see you on DBD I‚Äôll have fun sacrificing you. Cheers :)
---
I'd rather they increase the penalty for it instead of nerfing its usefulness into the ground. Example: After you're healed your position is revealed for X seconds and you're permanently Exposed until you go down. Strong in the moment, but a strong penalty after.
---
Also restrict the use of multiple obsession perks, DS + MoM is just obnoxious.
---
Bamboozle is always a good choice. It brings their vault speed back to pre rework, and blocks off the windows
---
ok
---
Truly a masterpiece
---
Imagine being scummy for using things the game gives you?  
---
Now what you did was abuse mechanics of the game and we are supposed to praise you? Naw dude...
---
My bad, didn‚Äôt want to show names and get banned, they were between 10-8
---
In case you are from another planet, toxicity exists on both sides
---
His lullaby is the same radius as the terror radius right? If so then M&amp;A could be fun.
---
When you queue solo, there is a 0% chance of getting a 4-person SWF on your team. When you queue as killer, the odds are considerably higher.
---
Wasn't this reference from Monto? I forgot the video but it was the after chat that the other guy is doing nothing while Monto was on the hook
---
The current rank system has a lot of issues, but it would work a lot better if the killers were way closer together in terms of strengths. Go to any DBD survivor stream, and they'll all tell you they derank regularly for "more fun games." Which translates to "Games where I'm not against Nurse/Billy/Spirit 100% of the time." And I totally get that, its genuinely not fun to play as surv in ranks lower than \~7 against the same 3 killers all the time, the killer variety in lower ranks makes the games way more interesting.
---
As a result you get a lot of groups that look like this, its basically just that some friends had time to derank while the others didn't, because clearly the rank differences had no affect on the outcome of the game.
---
why are you running beast of prey?!? its one of the worst perks in the game
---
use whispers or bloodhound or something, anything but beast of prey
---
The amount of hate this sub has for Tru3 (or any streamer who mostly sides with Killers) is insane lol. Never change, Reddit
---
But it wasn't a perfect game they had finished 1-2 generators
---
I remember that exact moment, it's on youtube as part of his play who you vs series, so that survivor build was a build from the last match he went up against.
---
I was confused about that too. since he only had 1 perk (borrowed time) that could be used in a "get people build" lmao.
---
Folk keep whipping that line out like it's some magic goddamn spell that instantly wins the argument and makes NOED balanced.
---
Nobody's gonna cleanse all the totems. I know it, and you know it. If you're the one solo-queue chucklefuck who does actually cleanse totems, then you're the reason why only one gen gets done in the first five minutes of the match. And then NOED activates anyway, because you got caught running around like a complete ninnyhammer after only cleansing three of them.
---
What does SWF mean lol?
---
I don‚Äôt really like it, just like I don‚Äôt like any second chance perks/perks that reward you for failing, but that‚Äôs why I run small game when queuing solo.
---
What a stupid argument. Total whataboutism.
---
Sorry
---
But you don't receive that much bp doing literally nothing. If you save your teammates you gain bp too. That's no reason to do this, unless you and a random are the only ppl alive
---
Definitive proof? I got a ruthless victory after achieving a 4K with a perfect 32K score. What else does the entity want from me
---
I giggled on the inside :)
---
Bricky is good too yes. But i rarely catch his stream since i live in europe. Which is sad. But i can always watch the vods.
---
Mate I'm new, I haven't fucking got all that good shit yet.
---
Had a very similar thing yesterday, hiding in a locker in front of the hatch which was also in front of the last guy in struggle
---
Saw one video. Him crawling up his own ass. 
---
Pass.
---
Dont use ruin then
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
It's to pay respect :'(
---
Survive with friends mode
---
Survivors are unsure if which hex totem they are cleansing. If TOTH is in play, they get notified it‚Äôs a possibility but not necessarily the one they are cleansing.
---
Indeed.
---
So what I'm understanding is you literally cannot and refuse to use logic. You are a cancer.
---
I didn‚Äôt say it was balanced, and as I said, I don‚Äôt use it, I don‚Äôt like perks that reward you for failing your objective or any second chance perks. What I do when solo queuing is run small game, and then on the way to gens I‚Äôll usually look around for a small while, if nothing procs, nothing procs and I move on. Besides, opening exit gates doesn‚Äôt take that long, and if noed does proc, then I make sure to get my ass out of the gate.
---
Yay, worth it
---
If you took a break from the game for half a year, you must be rank 15.  
---
I've been seeing the exact opposite; whenever I play killer at red ranks, I see mostly decent to good survivors; it's rare to see a team full of bad survivors at red ranks now. I'd say that survivors' skill has been improving a lot lately.
---
Took me months to get that fucking achievement. I got salt at first because ‚Äúmoris are fucking gay‚Äù but then they actually congratulated me when I said I was just hunting for that achievement lol.
---
Ohhhhhhh that makes so much sense. Thanks
---
Get the perks spirit fury and enduring
---
I am not a good survior rank 14 at the moment and I found some helpful randoms in the pre game chat who gave me some friendly tips, there are always some nice people in the community you just have to look out for them.
---
If it's short loops around stuff like cars, you run them around and break pallets. If it's loops like jungle gyms, TL walls, or the shack. Figure out what the optimal vs non optimal routes are and try and mind game them.
---
So lets say they are cleansing Ruin, they wont know that they are not cleansing say, HG? Also, what is the hint that it might be TOTH?
---
I‚Äôm guessing from the format of the quotations marks that OP is not a native English speaker, maybe German
---
But she's nothing compared to the goddess Amanda is
---
Watch damnnohtml ‚Äòs video on how to destroy loopers on basic tiles
---
Because, as has been explained for years, the game cannot tell *who* DCed.
---
The only reason I watch him any more is that he posts several full matches to youtube every day. But I had to unsubscribe after every other video was some cringingly-photoshopped thumbnail with an all-caps clickbait title.
---
He's got a lot going for him. But he's got a growing list of qualities that you need to tolerate to enjoy watching him.

You‚Äôre literally no better than the toxic swf dude...
---
You maybe right! Seems fishy that not 1 person got a hat but he knew that was the box they needed? Hmmm
---
I myself don't play him a lot but some strong perks for him are:
---
 Sloppy Butcher
---
Your goal besides murdering survivors is to make them waste a lot of time mending and healing
---
Monitor and Abuse
---
If you are able to sneak up to them then you can get your first hit a lot faster and if they are still injured then you can maybe end the chase in the first few seconds
---
A Nurses Calling
---
Good in combination with Monitor because then they won't stop healing as soon and you could maybe catch them while healing
---
Stridor
---
If they are all injured because of your frenzy then why shouldn't you make it easier for you to hear them?
---
And of course the usual perks like BBQ, Enduring, Ruin and so on are also quite good but the perks that I listed above are the ones that I think are *specifically* good with legion.
---
Personally I'm not a fan of Thanatophobia because the effect is so incredibly minimal.
---
Just my two cents. If someone disagrees then I'd like to hear why!
---
I got a 4k with the nurse and her 3 main perks and didn‚Äôt get the adept nurse trophy yesterday
---
No, but would be also be interested if anyone else has.
---
Small Game needs a totem counter.  Still doesn't yell you about one that someone else may have cleansed.  You could spend your game looking for a 5th totem that doesn't exist.
---
To do better
---
Yep, I dropped borrowed time and now bring self care instead. I was left on hook countless times, gates are open, teammates are gone, one time even the killer message me "wow, what an asshole for leaving you like this, I wasn't even camping", and he wasn't. Now unless I know the person did good in a game I will go back for him and sacrifice myself if needed, but if it's immersed Claudette, so long sucker.
---
Link? Couldn't find such video
---
Nah Noob3 basically had it in the after chat after he‚Äôs chased the killer around for literal ages and there were 2 hens left not one got popped and it destroyed his surviving streak, n he asked Claudette what she had been doing and she said ‚Äúdoing gens, you?‚Äù Which was anpiss take
---
My heart bleeds for you. I did the same with Freddy and no trophy after they released the changes.
---
"mad cuz u bad?" or just "mad?" are my personal favorites
---
The horde is coming for you fam, brace yourself
---
It‚Äôs not really a strategy tbh. It‚Äôs the only thing survivors can do to waste killer‚Äôs time. 
---
Moonwalk
---
and drops pallets way too often as a survivor.
---
He should look behind more.
---
Bragging rights
---
I got you fam one moment
---
This game will go on for another 5 years. DBD is in it‚Äôs prime right now
---
Show me the way my friend =P
---
That depends on what killer you're playing; Huntress, Hag, Billy, Spirit, and Nurse all have specific ways to deal with looping(Billy is the weakest amongst them). All the killers I just mentioned require further knowledge about their specific powers and learning how to use them properly.  
---
If you're playing an M1 killer, your way to deal with looping is Enduring + Spirit Fury, moonwalking, and learning to read survivors well.  
---
Once you learn how to run specific tiles like LT walls, Long/Short wall jungle gyms, and basic tiles, you'll have a much easier time.
---
I agree that the last totem should make some sort of notification when cleansed
---
Shhhh, just let him get it out of his system
---
Bamboozle :/
---
Loops. Make him become a basic M1 killer. Avoid open spaces. With experienced billys running around trees does nothing. Slow vaults are dangerous try and make sure each one is fast so you avoid chainsaws on the vaults.
---
[here ya go! go kill all those survivors!](https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ) 
---
This helped me a lot and I‚Äôm rank 12 only been maining killer about a week or so
---
So that's how the luck offerings work!
---
I don‚Äôt like him, not only does he have a huge ego but he copies Monto a bit. I remember the first time Monto did gen protector spirit and within the next few days Tru3 has done it as well. I commented that he‚Äôd copied him, he said back ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt watch Monto, I just have a very creative mind and thought of this.‚Äù I know a bunch of people come up with different builds but it‚Äôs a bit odd how it‚Äôs the same build with a few days difference. Then I had a bunch of sycophants defending him as if I‚Äôd accused him of being a pedophile.
---
I love tru3 he's played the Game for years, that's why he's like that sometimes, he plays solo surviors and him accepting the fact that even solos can be tough to play against is hard
---
dOn't TuNnEL AnD YoU WoN'T HaVe To DeAl WiTh DS.
---
I mean he's just venting. He's not actively going out of his way to ruin the enjoyment of someone else. Let's not confuse being a sore loser (even if having it rubbed in your face) and being toxic. If he facecamped on the next match then yes, you're right.
---
you‚Äôre literally crying about a perk that is next to useless because most people run addons that preserve charges
---
grow the fuck up, there are worse things in this game than franklin‚Äôs
---
*teammate misses skillcheck*
---
"Why did you miss that? The killer doesn't even have Ruin."
---
*Tru3 misses skillcheck*
---
"Whoops. Lookin' at chat."
---
Love the guy, sometimes he goes on a rant but hey that's steamers for you haha
---
I meant fire up*
---
I see your point, but honestly reading his post wasn‚Äôt enlightening, and just wasted a minute of my time.
---
Luck offerings are secretly the key to never getting a SWF group in your lobby.
---
It's swf , it screws up matchmaking. As long as one person in the party is your level the rest can be anywhere between 1 and 20.
---
So in other words...reddit. =P
---
I *kind of* get the reasoning, with the new EGC. With there now being a time limit on getting out traps popping at the exit becomes unbalanced. That said, I think slowing the timer (like when people are dying/hooked) would have been a better alternative to nerfing a middling Killer.
---
That's better :)  
---
Bamboozle's a bad band-aid to bad map design :/
---
They will not know. For TOTH, they just get the hex sign notification saying TOTH is one of the perks and a hex.
---
Pretty much. Not sure what I was expected to read when I opened up the app tbh :P
---
Depending on queue times, it takes about 4 hours to get 1.000.000 playing nothing but killer, burning Pudding offerings and whatnot.
---
I mean it WAS tagged rant, did you expect to see something positive?
---
I don‚Äôt have a mori, I‚Äôve never had a mori, if I wanted a mori yes I could probably go out and get one because I am WHAT, TOXIC!
---
Farming or just gave up or memeing
---
I think that forcing you to get up and go back down again(which extends the timer a huge amount) is reportable.  
---
I know that just slugging until the timer runs out isn't.  
---
Regardless, you probably need video proof.
---
Beep beep nyeoom
---
Are you familiar with queue times? Lol
---
When did this sub became an anti tru3 circlejerk?
---
You cna be sure to see them once I'm done with them!!
---
Rank 20 in a nutshell
---
Nope, that‚Äôs how Monto talks lol
---
I mean what are they looping? 
---
You need to learn how to play tiles and mindgame at pallets for the most part. Looping is the main part of chasing
---
He's the same guy who made said analytical post, funnily enough. But I agree it seems too good to be true especially going by his own stats. To have all traps activated, them not get the key until the 4th box, which happens to be the same box for all of them and have them clamoring for the box at the same time with him preemptively ready to block the box seems way too unlikely. That's some stars-aligning level luck.
---
1. Not all toxic survivors are swf 
---
2. Toxic behavior is a viscous cycle that both sides contribute to.
---
The best thing you can do is not be toxic even if people are being assholes. I‚Äôve had people straight up apologize for being dicks when I was nice and gave them the hatch even after getting bm‚Äôd. 
---
It‚Äôs just a game. Don‚Äôt take things so personally.
---
Tru3 only uploads games where survivors play messy
---
It‚Äôs probably the flashlights they‚Äôre using that‚Äôs gettin‚Äô me, but I completely didn‚Äôt even think about picking up the survivor at a different angle. Thanks for the tips!
---
Slugging isn't bannable... Or reportable
---
You should see his tweets about these posts
---
Take off the Hex perks and BBQ. Freddy already has good tracking in the Dream World which is further extended by Class Photo. Totems aren't good on Freddy and if you can effectively down and keep others asleep then you basically have Ruin built-in.
---
Some slow QTE would do well imo
---
There's a character named Jeff in the Saw franchise that had plenty of opportunities to save the loves of others but took his sweet ass time every chance he got.
---
&gt; new DS is worse
---
It is a worse perk, but more fair. Definitely not worse in the way you view it lmao
---
&gt; You could predict the old one.
---
That's because everyone was using it.
---
&gt; There's no counter to the new DS
---
Yeah there is. It is called not tunneling.
---
&gt; other than the assume everyone has it
---
Which is exactly how you could predict old DS. You are not making any sense, and DS isn't even one of the most used perks in high ranks anymore. Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, Self-Care and even Iron Will are used more often lmao
---
But tru3 only titles the video toxic swf when they either have matching names or are on each others friends lists lol... has nothing to do with people flash lighting or joining together
---
Pandas play way too much Nurse. It's boring as hell to watch even if the dude is kind of chill.
---
They're all nearby immersed and waiting to get the save.
---
&gt;He uses thing I don't like! He's a shit person!
---
I love this shit. It's always a game of "did I run away early enough to not be chased for someone else's fuck up"
---
&gt;So... You set there doing nothing while the game plays itself? No thanks.
---
What exactly are you doing during 1st hook? 
---
I suppose you want some kind of struggle mechanic for this stage as well.
---
Furtive chase does NOT flatly reduce your terror radius, it only reduces your terror radius in a chase, so no ambushes here, and I told you I'm all ears doesnt detect anyone who doesn't want to be found
---
Those are the games where survivors are crawling around in and out of lockers just not doing anything. Then you get hooked and you see their auras all crouched staring at you from the other side of the map. So infuriating
---
Her crouch speed is a bit slow :(
---
OK. let's use your logic.
---
How about we add the last perk I suggested into the game, and check if it follows your logic.
---
Next to useless? Check!
---
If people don't use it often, that's a check!
---
Worse things? Well.. I guess Hitler existed right? Check!
---
Best part: if you complain about this perk, you need to "grow the fuck up".
---
Also, have you never ever complained about anything video game related in your life? Didn't think so. Grow the fuck up, then, right? Please fuck yourself if you don't mind.
---
&gt; All of Ghostface's perks are bad.
---
&gt; The second one is?
---
Do I need to point out the irony here?
---
Yeah, its pretty simple
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be like that once you get to red ranks you have to get a perfect game to get a double pip so no it‚Äôs not broken it‚Äôs just an extra challenge
---
Lol bud did you even see the anniversary live stream?
---
I cannot remember them by "first one, second one"  
---
You could give a name or a description of the perk, at least.
---
just imagine Clown in Kate's outfit
---
Could be interesting on all killers, really. I mean, double so on stealthy ones that go for grabs and or instant downs. But if you run this perk, I think it's not too difficult to simply chase a survivor towards any gen down/pickup them there with little additional time investment.
---
And the result is big. 16 sec delay on anyone who wasn't on a gen is good, but getting a better BBQ (minus the BP) on top of that is even better.
---
Just use a macro lmao
---
Yeah the main reason I use bbq and chili is for the bloodpoints.
---
Hell I use it on killers like the hag because even though I could choose better perks for that build, I also really like bloodpoints.
---
tombstone myers is probably the most easy killer to gen rush, so if you are in a coordinated SWF you can escape no problem
---
Thrilling tremors
---
It would be tight fit, that‚Äôs for sure. They both have jiggle physics though, so hey, it still works out ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Nope we good
---
You are better of stealing other people clips without crediting as you probably will
---
It isn't meant for awake survivors. It is meant for AFTER you sleep them. 16 meter tr is nice because it either gives you their aura or gives you a super close range version of Whispers. It is good on him.
---
Nice replacement for ruin at least. I hate hex perks as i have to worry about them being destroyed.
---
Claudette for self heal perk
---
Claudette is probably the single easiest survivor in the whole game. Dwight and Meg are probably tied for second.
---
Is this in any way a Scrubs reference? Because I pictured Pig as Elliot and this one got me
---
Depip is a grace from god be glad your one step closer to enjoyable games
---
Omg I just power through it because I know my other three teammates are probably looking for it anyway.
---
The one that blocks gens, right?  
---
I can't see how that is useful as survivors will just continue to work on the gens they've already been working on. You might be able to get it to work by maintaining an insane pressure; hooking one person right after the other; but at that point, you don't really need a perk, do you?
---
for some reason, people who have played this game for a while expect you to play like a pro from the get go. I've been flamed for the stupidest shit, and I started a week ago.
---
And we care because?
---
What rank do you play? I play almost exclusively solo and my teammates aren‚Äôt usually useless. Like 1 in 7 matches I‚Äôll get a useless or dumb teammate. 
---
I play rank 7-10
---
I mean, yeah. That isn't an incorrect statement.
---
Tragic.
---
Op, some things I noticed with not so good killers,
---
They don‚Äôt hug the wall well and take corners super wide, which makes them easy to loop.
---
They double back super frequently. Just commit to the chase 
---
They respect pallets too much, which allows me to get an extra loop or whatever off. Just swing through it, it is what it is if they drop pallet on you. At least it is gone 
---
They don‚Äôt know how to counter loop jungle Jim‚Äôs, shack, etc, which ultimately comes down to practice.
---
In terms of perks, enduring and spirit furry allows you to eat pallets :)
---
Hope this helps a bit op
---
spirit is pretty good if you learn her and probably in top 3 killers
---
Aren't hillbilly and The cannibal literally the same other than perks? They both have chainsaws.
---
Hey fam I am new too and I am a huntress player, pm me anything you want to lean ahout the game, us noobs gotta stick together.
---
harder to directly save against doc, harder to unhook then get out against leatherface because saw
---
Agreed. I am only still subscribed to him on YouTube because I like that his videos only contain one match and I can easily watch it at the time and place I‚Äôm usually on YouTube. 
---
(the bathroom)
---
I started with hag, is it because I have special edition?
---
Myers is very fun. He's my main when I play killer.
---
I got mine by killing a bunch of people who were willing to type "xD" unironically in the post-game chat.  I was lucky
---
Wait hag too?
---
The thing is that ‚Äújust dodge‚Äù isn‚Äôt even completely invalid advice, and neither is cleansing dull totems. The issue is that one is way easier than the other.
---
Lol like Ruin even affects the skill checks. I always wondered why he‚Äôd say that when the skill checks are the same, it‚Äôs just the amount of progression/regression that is affected.
---
I mean, in theory, yeah that could work. Take a killer with small aura (f.e. Huntress / Hag), slap on both perks and you will have effectively 0 terror radius during chases and no stain once bloodlust kicks in...
---
Albeit it still won't change a thing as long as the survivor you're chasing can see you, requires said survivors not to drop any pallets (as breaking them cancels Beast of Prey) and takes up two perk slots for what is at best a situational gimmick...
---
But hey, it's definitely **some** kind of use.
---
EXCUSE ME, YOUR PIZZA IS HERE
---
C'mon already. I know most of you dont like him but straight up creating more memes only to comment bad stuff about him is just inappropriate. Using that to your advantage that he has seen one of the recent posts only to be even more insulting towards him because you know that hes probably gonna look at this one too? That's honestly just an as***** move
---
Okay thanks, i started playing killer 4 days ago so i dont know much about their perks.
---
One can transverse the map in a couple of seconds and back-rev without losing 4 chainsaw swings of distance.  
---
Cannibal is shit.
---
They both have chainsaws, but they‚Äôre used in completely different ways. They don‚Äôt play even remotely similarly.
---
To be fair like 40 percent of the perks in this game are very situational. Dont work most of the time but when you can pull them off it's probably one of the most satisfying things to do in the game
---
Failing to be immersed.
---
Haha you're not supposed to have fun there if you're not having fun while you're in your second stage that means the game mechanic works like it's intended to be.
---
Its a stressful environment for the survior fam, you can't expect to coffee while you're on second stage( don't do it btw, I have and it doesn't always work)
---
Are you on console? If so, yes.
---
I see your point, but it would be really hard to change it. Having to repeatedly press spacebar is something annoying, yet easy to do, but if you fail you let your self die. This is what the devs want.
---
If we make easy skillchecks that cover 99% of the circle then people would kill themselves if and when they want.
---
If just keeping the button pressed is implemented, people would die if and when they want.
---
Pressing spacebar can make you mess up and die,  and that's the intention.
---
Even though they can change it, it is a really hard task to find another thing easy to do, but "messable".
---
For most useful perks I would go with nea or meg. They have 2 really good perks.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt waste time with Claudette just try and survive without healing by getting better at looping. 
---
Healing just takes too much time away from the obj and it‚Äôs not worth it. 
---
Deadhard from David king is extremely good but his other perks are mediocre. 
---
That‚Äôs why I say Meg or Nea since they have 2 perks that are good and roughly used all the time.
---
Kono HILLBILLY DA!
---
Did you do all 5 gens? ;-;  
---
I have never seen "generator repairs" go above 150%.
---
Yup, on the xbox one.
---
I think a big difference is Monto will use it in one of his builds, their are many videos of him not using it and just being a fantastic killer. The people who will try to justify themselves by saying '-insert name- does it so I do' are childish for using that excuse anyway and also probably can only get results using that sweaty build.
---
Honestly op, loop. If you can loop him well and not give him a chance to chainsaw, you‚Äôll force him to m1 you so you can stall out chases a lot more
---
The lie sucks, but I endorse them making as much money as possible on non-gameplay affecting content.
---
But the sense of betrayal sucks.
---
I never thought I needed this
---
I believe console players got a special edition of the game including all DLCs up to Huntress.
---
Happy cake-day!
---
As you could see, I had a gold in evader too. Also had iridescent in benevolence. Had a full altruistic build on. In other words, no urban. And. I was toxic Nea with a flashlight.
---
Moral of the story is just to have fun.
---
The killer just kept kicking them and I would go back and finish. Lol. But there was one hen left
---
RNG traps are fun :)  
---
Just get out on the 1st try when the killer's on the other side of the map, but in 20 tries when he's on your ass.
---
Peak immersion.
---
Tru3 is just toxic, through and through. Don't get me wrong, he's not a terrbile player, but he's by no means the best and doesn't have a right to be talking shit and blaming his team mates for terrible plays.
---
I used to watch Tru3 on twitch, and watching him live, is something far different than watching him on youtube, because you can see his bad games (that are probably close to 60-70%). He just rages and blames everyone, though sometimes he himself is to blame.
---
He acts like the best huntress main too using all meta perks, which is fine, but as soon as he can't get 1 survivor and moves on and they heal, he instantly just says SWF idiots and that they're ruining the game, eventhough most of the time, they're not.
---
Tru3's audience is also extremely young and when he's toxic they essentially follow his lead. There's been times where he's went against a two man SWF only to have a viewer help him. Did he get angry at that? No. Did he think it was unfair? No.
---
I get it, DBD is a fustrating game sometimes, but his ego and overall attitude is what is wrong with the community.
---
Killer must be a god-tier player then.
---
Are you saying the average person browses that sub?
---
All killers I have:
---
Hillbilly
---
Wraith
---
Trapper
---
Doctor
---
Nurse
---
I can understand how it makes you less able to relax, but just have us do skillchecks then. Have them be half the circle wide, that way you‚Äôre engaged, but you don‚Äôt have to sit there  mashing and accidentally die.
---
Oh and also huntress
---
I was referring to myself.
---
Exactly
---
No Huntress? That's weird.
---
To be fair it was close. But to get a 4K and 8000 in each category is seems a pretty merciless to me.
---
Thank you!!!
---
I did get a perfect game score wise. 8000 in each category.
---
It may have been a difficult achievement for him
---
This guy is obsessed with the pig
---
So that's all you should get; Myres is a licensed killer so you need to pay for him specifically.
---
Alright now do all your quests and then don‚Äôt use them so when Ghostface comes out you have 1mil and 90k in quests.
---
Soo dificult
---
Playing the game and not spending bloodpoints
---
Dear lord no other player had done this
---
You don't have to tell me about changing it to something else because I am only in 200 hours and am worried about my keyboard , but they shoudnt change it imo, then people will be angry about skillcheck as some people can't hit them
---
I agree 100%.
---
Which is why I don't understand the purpose of making some cosmetics auric cells only. 
---
If people want to play their butts of in order to buy ONE outfit using Iridescent Shards, why can't they? People who have money and can't be bothered to grind, will just buy the cosmetics.
---
This would also be beneficial for DBD since more available cosmetics in iridescent shards = more goals for a broke ass person (like myself) to play in order to get it.
---
I'll try that
---
i wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. billy or spirit would be better
---
That or fantasizes about boning spirit in general. I mean, have you browsed THIS sub?
---
I only watch him for his builds
---
Freddy should be bumped up one tier maybe. Red Paint Brush + Monitor and Abuse = a Freddy with ZERO terror radius. Add a Z-block for a total 3 second sleep transition and a lery's offering and you got a recipe for a pulse-pounding, adrenaline filled match for the survivors when they realize Freddy has turned into Myers 2.0 and sleeps you almost instantly.
---
Agreed, head traps should just count as a hooked or downed survivor.
---
Good players have a higher chance of missing skill checks when theres ruin because theyre usually trying to hit the great skill check and end up going too early on the skill check instead of too late, like most new players do.
---
Fuck no I don't want to break my joystick twice as fast. Already had to replace them with metal ones cause of this damn game.
---
Because people are more likely to risk trying to get a Great skillcheck when Ruin is up.
---
Without Ruin, a Great is only worth a small bonus, so it's not worth the risk if you don't have good reflexes, ping, and framerate. But because Ruin both regresses the gen and pauses progression, if you keep getting normal skillchecks, you risk wasting huge amounts of time if you get several back-to-back. It's even worse if there's several people on the gen, because then you're wasting everyone's time.
---
I did try XD I even toyed with them to max out my points like everyone says you're supposed to. The Entity got their fill that day.
---
I would recommend two characters:
---
Dwight - his Bond perk allows you to see other survivors in a certain radius. It's great when you need to find someone for a heal, to to heal them. It's good for knowing when the killer is chasing someone, or to not lead the killer to people working on a gen. Basically, it helps you understand what other survivors are doing, and allows you to make decisions based on that knowledge. His perks are all teamwork based, which your team will appreciate.
---
Kate - she's a DLC character, but one of her perks is great for newer players. Windows of Opportunity lets you see pallets, windows, and other vault locations within a certain radius. It's a great perk for learning the map tiles. You can do a lot of this on your own, but when you are just starting out and the killer is chasing you, it makes things a bit more automatic when a window or pallet is highlighted on your screen. Another of her perks, Dance with me, hides her scratch marks for 3 seconds after a fast vault, so the two can kind of work in combination with each other (but there are usually better perks to run in my opinion). If you don't want to drop money on the DLC, then look for Windows of Opportunity in the weekly shrine if it interests you.
---
A lot of people might say Claudette. In my opinion, Claudette is great for blending in to the environment, and her perks are probably good for newer players, but she's not really my top choice. A lot of solo players run Self Care which allows you to heal yourself, it's good for survivability, especially when playing solo. The reason I wouldn't play Claudette is because you probably won't learn chases the same way as you would with another survivor. She blends in very well on a lot of maps, and killers can have a difficult time tracking her. But if you prefer a more stealthy play style and want to avoid the chases, she might be your top pick.
---
Good luck, and welcome to the Fog!
---
Spirit is better on console tbh. Just play her. Way easier too
---
Oh no
---
True. I do that all the time - though I don‚Äôt consider myself a good player.
---
This is really helpful thank you! 
---
I don‚Äôt really have access to many killer perks at the moment since Legion, my most levelled character, is still only at 15. I‚Äôve been running whatever perks I can on him honestly‚Äîeven managing to get adept Legion by accident because I had nothing else to run. 
---
I did get nurses calling in the shrine a couple weeks back so I‚Äôll definitely try to level up and get that in my bloodweb! 
---
I‚Äôm currently running Discordance, NOED, Thrill of the Hunt and Insidious on him. Do you think that‚Äôs an okay build or are there any perks that I should switch out for something else? I‚Äôm still a little on the fence with Insidious.
---
Quincea√±era Jane next pls
---
That app Zedge has a bunch of Dbd sounds.
---
Oh yeah, that‚Äôs it!!
---
I always assumed when there‚Äôs a ruin and someone misses a skill check they tried to hit a great and were just a little bit early.
---
See I play with a controller and sometimes my finger gets tired from clicking the button so fast. So sometimes I slow down and die, it makes me feel bad for my teammates. I don‚Äôt even try to slow down it just happens.
---
Maybe if it‚Äôs like the wiggle that would maybe be easier.
---
tru3's titles are so ass these days. one of them was TOXIC BULLY FAIL and literally all it was, was a meg vaulting a window to annoy him. he ignored her all game and then chased her at the end and got her and apparently that warrents such a title.
---
(OwO firstly love you GlenOck)
---
Okay but real talk boys 
---
Pig: 100% human and v chill. Let‚Äôs you boop the snoot. Is basically claud as far as stealth level goes but without all the bad things that claud is. Absolute chad

Terminator:  Lmao robot and still not as cute as pig despite have physical modifications to be ‚Äúperfect‚Äù. No snoot booping (immediate thumbs down cant stress this point enough) and prolly just like claud, the type to be ‚Äúdoing gens, you?‚Äù while you loop the killer for ten minutes causing the death of everyone 
---
I see a clear winner here
---
unnerving presence and distressing are musts for the doctor, other than that i recommend bbq and ruin, or enduring
---
Coming from the little bitch boy who try‚Äôs to troll online because you have a sad pathetic life get over yourself pussy
---
I can imagine it being good on freddy (until rework) to have an 8m terror radius which allows aura reading in chase. You could potentially use it to cheese deep wounds on legion as well.
---
Christ you killer mains whine about the smallest amount of counters
---
I love the retro painting style, are you asian? Cuz if thats a doodle...^IfkinSuckAtDrawingThen
---
Thanks, you are probably right about the self-healing thing, my first match with her solo I escaped. I really do need to learn how to put some distance between myself and the killer. I tend to get myself caught fairly quickly.
---
Ouch
---
I hurt your soft spot
---
Which one was it? The truth about all your subs or that your videos are shit?
---
Bruh just let the man has his achievement. If you don‚Äôt like it just go to one of the literal thousands of other posts in the sub
---
That's exactly what I did! 2 people left, didn't want number 2 getting hatch so I followed one person until u could figure out where 2 was. Eventually 1 caught on that I want downing her so she started to follow me and we found 2. I downed 2, killed 1, let 2 run off and killed him. Also ended up being "reported"
---
Huntress is paid on console?
---
Nope
---
This posts just fill the sub with useless posts
---
Same as people that post about reaching prestiege or rank 1
---
But by definition this is completely scummy and everyone knows it.. preventing survivors from taking the mask off is just low and basic pathetic pig.. I csnt stand pig players.. 90% of them. Camp or tunnel the person with the trap on their head which is counter  productive.
---
How's mettle of man working out for you?
---
She Moried all of us. (Spirit) with prayer beads, and mother daughter ring. So yeah she was. xD
---
Perfect thank you!
---
I've been only watching ScottJund, Zubat and Panda lately.
---
Everything else just falls too far into "cringe" or "salty" or both.
---
To me it seems like DCing in a sizeable portion of your games because your laundry list of a ruleset was violated is taking the game seriously. And it doesn't seem like that's the definition of having fun, but to each their own I suppose. You've been pretty civil during this discourse despite me wholly disagreeing so I can at least appreciate that. Have a good Sunday.
---
I just don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre so salty. People will fill the sub with useless posts whether you‚Äôre an ass hole or not so why not choose the latter?
---
If they made it that way wouldn't they just stay injured and have the perk deactivate by getting downed from injured?
---
Idk brother seems most fitting to put it in the single social media made for the game it self
---
if people actually do it quick i don't mind that, but if they they don't optimize their far i just dc
---
Borrowed Time, We‚Äôll Make It, Hope, Resilience. 
---
I would recommend trying to unlock a exhaustion perk that fits your playstyle (dead hard, sprint burst, balance landing or lithe) and replace one of the above with that and you have a pretty solid build then imo.
---
In my case I only say I‚Äôm dumb af if I know that the result wouldn‚Äôt have happened based on something I could‚Äôve avoided doing.
---
Haha
---
Although in my defence i main freddy and pig so i couldn‚Äôt ever ;)
---
All of his perks are stupidly useless.
---
First one: Why whould I want to rush vault outside of a chase?
---
Second one: What's the point on blocking a generator that is not being repaired?
---
Third one: Why whould I want to make my TR 16m smaller only in a chase? (it is supposed to work like M&amp;A)
---
Tru3 points out good (or bad) plays that other players make all the time. He points out when he fooks up himself as well. Many people like myself enjoy the analysis of what works and what doesn‚Äôt. 
---
I think he‚Äôs just competitive and a perfectionist.
---
Karma did you a solid and swayed the RNG gods for all four to need one blockable objective after they went out of their way to be cancer, 100% fair.
---
More like 5% of my games i DC so like twice a week. I don't mind running against certain killers every once in a while. Killers are the toxic ones that cuss at people over disagreements especially if you bring up NOED.
---
Yeah I love how everyone says META perk. Nope that perk is bad and doesn‚Äôt do anything. 
---
It seems good but it‚Äôs just has the game last longer it only works when the killer finds a survivor but only if the ever did.
---
Normal, bbq ruin spirit enduring, as a meme build, slap daddy legion, thanataphobia, franklins(or stbfl if no items), third seal, sloppy butcher
---
I have 600 hours total in Dead By Daylight. I have yet to get ANY kind of Mori/Addon based achievement for this reason.

People who D/C purposefully to make you lose the achievement are scum.

Can we really stop being a douche to Tru3? Damn, it just isn't funny anymore. If you wanna talk to him, talk to him in DM's on Twitter. Sheesh...
---
Borrowed Time, We‚Äôll Make It, Iron Will, and Resilience.

It's like Playing Freddy with Red brush. Just more limited.

We won't let him

Thank you!

Omg who gives a fuck about that? As long as it doesn‚Äôt affect gameplay
---
Yup, I don't see it happen too often these days but when it does I know in my heart my fate is sealed
---
Btw I have no problem with him, but these titles are hilarious
---
Listen, and understand. That hill billy is out there. It can‚Äôt be bargained with. It can‚Äôt be reasoned with. It doesn‚Äôt feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.

Ah, a r/shittyrainbow6 crossover!

Which comments? I post like 20 a day. Also good to see someone respect the OINK.

this strategy worked on me so
---
get the killer to chase a survivor to the other side of the map
---
if the killer is a bit too attached to the gens, you might be dead

I've managed to get the skill check sounds. I put them [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p33OEWewBll6uHw2ciep-UXoTFr25BYp/view?usp=sharing).
---
It's in a google drive, hopefully, you can download it.
---
Well they cleansed haunted and I did snowball, I did not know for sure they had the same box but I saw 4 survivors around the same box for a good 30seconds so I stood in front, also one of the devs explained on stream that when a RBT is placed a box will be chosen so 25% per box to get that key. I rolled a 25% 4 times in a row I guess or someone didn't search the other boxes in time. I left and got back to a 4K.
---
Look it up
---
Dbd player count
---
The game at one time had around 60k players and then it had around 40-50k for a very long time and recently it dropped to 20k quite quickly.
---
We need Nurse reaction to Freddy teleport.
---
That made me so mad. Neither are the rank 5 achievements
---
They are a part of the original achievements.
---
They removed them from consoles to fit in all the hag/doc/nurse dlc trophies into the basic launch list since there is a limit.
---
Not sure why they never added them as a separate trophy pack though...
---
Explain please
---
Well that sounds like things I comment on. So I am glad to have made you appriciate the comments.
---
Typical low energy, boring
---
It's almost as though graphic design is an actual job that people get paid for.
---
But, yeah, in all seriousness, don't complain about this. They could just stop making new cosmetics entirely then you wouldn't have paid cosmetics to complain about. Time goes into designing them, the people designing them deserve to get paid for their work.
---
Theres an excuse for every little thing that happens to tru3, it gets old quick. Btw all of us on reddit are liars.
---
I was talking about the 1st minute DC like legion always got. Whenever the survivors know which killer it is, leave.
---
I understand your situation with DCs but im talking about the DC 4k without even hitting a survivor.
---
Or did you think it was skill when you played legion and got a 4k dc within the 1st minute while actually just frenzy hitting only 1 survivor?
---
Instead of people not being in dream state at this current patch its pretty much a free hatch if they have a key, but after freddy rework he wont need to put them in dream state and he can just pull them out.
---
Sorry for the bad formatting its my first attempt at making a meme, wasnt a very good attempt though.
---
Ahh, gotcha.
---
Done this achievmemt. Also got loads of salt from survivors. Two perks are the must - enduring and play with your food.
---
Also, we played locker games, and I think it was pretty fun. Different game :)
---
Tbh for the amount of shit i talk about this game, yesterday i finnaly got a game where i had a stable 30 fps for about 20 seconds, safe to say this game gets vetter every day
---
Long neck holy shit.

Got'cha bitch!

It's not small fam, also I like your flair
---
I‚Äôve googled everything I can possibly think of and can‚Äôt see anything on his rework. Can someone explain?
---
You‚Äôre incredibly late, people have posted this same image like 40 times now
---
It doesn't have to be one extreme or the other. I just don't think mashing a button is a great thing especially when a lag spike happens and you die instantly.
---
What is this?
---
Oh ok thank you!
---
The main issue with the current ranking system is it can penalise you through no fault of your own. Going against a killer who can‚Äôt catch anyone, RIP an emblem automatically as you don‚Äôt have the opportunity to even save. 
---
Playing killer and dominating survivors in 5 seconds, RIP your chaser emblem. 
---
Its majorly flawed.
---
Sad ti nema bezanja xD
---
My life :)
---
They need to change it back to 4k. Adept plague was a nightmare at high ranks, even when rank reset happened and I went back to rank 10, I got a few 4ks and didn't get enough to double pip until I got extremely lucky. Also the devout emblem is just obnoxious, 4k should mean iridescent imo
---
I thought I was trippin when I saw this. Glad somebody screenshot it finally, I was too dumbfounded lol
---
I called him out for being a rage salty baby like a year ago and I got downvotes to hell for ‚Äúnot understanding when he‚Äôs joking‚Äù I‚Äôm glad people are calling him out for being such a toxic prick now
---
Still doesn't say bitch though. I will never consider him a good killer until then.
---
Ah. A true camper and tunneler making a shitpost. What‚Äôs new.
---
I'm asking where you looked it up from because I tried looking it up and the numbers I found don't match your claim at all
---
I'm glad people already know. I scrolled through and couldn't find anything so I decided to post it
---
This did... not age well.
---
You cant call this a doodle, my 3 hour art projects is basically poop against this. Great job
---
I remember the time when he wouldn't touch the nurse with a stick lol, he got better quickly!
---
Dont play swf easy
---
Can‚Äôt you not tell if the survivors are in swf? Or did they remove that feature
---
what about wraith  
---
he also lives on a diet of purely pallets
---
Well hey at least you made 2 girls happy lul.
---
Oh my
---
https://steamcharts. com/app/381210
---
You sure they dont? The game didnt have 60k players? It wasnt on around 40k for a long time? It hasnt dropped from 40k to 22k quite quickly?
---
Hiding in a locker right as someone is hooked is a decent strategy to avoid BBQ and Chilli. I do this, but I also leave the locker as soon as the four seconds are up.
---
The second one lights up all empty gens as white... Which means all normally marked gens are being worked on.  I suppose it also somewhat prevents a situation where you chased 2 Survivors off a Gen, the second one can't start working on it again immediately.  It's real purpose is to show you which gens are in danger, though.
---
Also Do quests and don‚Äôt use them so you get more bp when Ghostface comes out. I have 1m and 90k ready for Ghostface and that will get up to lvl 40. 
---
Also before Ghostface comes out there‚Äôs a Bp event 2x BP
---
A LOT of streamers are like this. They refuse to admit fault IRL and in game, and/or they can't take a loss. I know big ones whose names would be recognizable, but I don't want them or mutual streamer friends coming after me for talking about them here.
---
Was thinking more dream traps
---
Deja vu.
---
Itll reveal generators no matter what you do as a killer, but it doesn't matter that much anyway
---
Everyones reaction: Welp...
---
It shows you which ones are not being worked on, therefor, also shows you which ones ARE.
---
Shao Herman.
---
That's legit good advice. I just figured this out today.   
---
(The quest stuff)  
---
I won't be able to play arround the BP-event, so that's why I am farming early =)
---
Just use SAM and get the achievement. Who cares anyway

---
I'm kinda new I figured out this strategy yesterday :(.  I saved this guy twice when we were the only two left. Also got 2 gens online on my own.
---
I was wondering why he wasn't working on anything.  It was only when I got hooked and he was crouch walking away from me did I realize I should have never saved him.  Jerk :(
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure he can still grab someone from jumping in. I could be wrong though.
---
Happy cake day
---
Haha sadly this has happened to me even when playing solo
---
That's why I never use ruin
---
*bitch*
---
I already have 1m bp saved up as well lol. Just in case I can‚Äôt play or don‚Äôt feel like playing during 2x BP
---
wow this is pretty cool~
---
Or you can use BBQ
---
Ah well my bad, meme still applies though if he can grab before rework
---
Dat360noscope for pure gameplay
---
*Adiris casually speaking Babylonian but no one understands*
---
Too many legions and billies who will only backrev for it to truly be OP
---
Feels bad mate 
---
*laughs inside because I genuinely hate mom*
---
don't know if I'd say shitty
---
me and the boys working on the killer shack gen
---
No way you only made 10k shards in 100 levels.
---
I have 363 hours (10-20h AFK) and I'm level 167, currently sitting at 18,290 Shards: I bought Susie body (5750), Perk (2000), Nea's Biker Jacket (7200)
---
5850 + 2000 + 7200 + 18290 = 33,340 shards.
---
According to wiki (Not sure how accurate this is) you get 25,220 Shards total for reaching 100.
---
Just disable the chat my dude.
---
Well not average but yes
---
im new what does swf mean?
---
God, I love No0B3
---
Your greatest lesson comes from your last mistake. Best to just jump in and figure it out. That's what I did.
---
Nono lol
---
For survivor:
---
Don't be a douche.
---
For killer:
---
No not. Fucking. Facecamp.
---
Until they disconnect out of fear that is
---
For the record, he does post games where he loses.  Not just games where he survives and clowns on the killer.
---
Must be getting lucky. That happens a lot and I don‚Äôt even do half of that stuff
---
It‚Äôs mainly because more people play survivor than killer. They have to be stricter to survivors instead of killers because the majority of the player base prefers survivor. That‚Äôs why it hardly takes any time to find a killer game in contrast to a survivor game.
---
Plus survivors have more privilege in this game too. Some take it for granted (the toxic ones) and think they can get away with so much more.
---
Yeah I'm sure you totally did for 10 whole minutes
---
Pigs got social stays though, compared to ghost face who is a giant nerd and cannot handle being looked at for over 1 second.
---
They're salty that you're using thoses add-ons but if they don't let you Mori them you're just going to do it again... like just don't waste time and let everyone move on.
---
DBD's real nightmare is ego.
---
Man I wish I could be hyped for the Freddy rework, but honestly what they told us wasn't nearly enough to actually convince me.  We don't know how long the cooldown is on the teleport, or if it has a limited range, and the Teleport is the only part of the rework I see making an actual impact.  Hopefully it's cooldown is like, 10 seconds or something like that and you can go to any teleport regardless of whether or not it's been completed, because his chasing power is just bad.
---
60 seconds + however long it took you to prepare an area to have a power that can be boiled down to an Order addon and some (admittedly potentially decent) traps.  With how easy they made it to wake up and the fact that he no longer has a stall, I really think that he holds even less power now.
---
I want to be hype, I want to look forward to this, but I just... can't.
---
Spawning on the totem is still a thing.
---
They do need to get more consistent totem placement fixes in the game.
---
I still honestly don't know what you mean by those numbers, but looking at monthly averages of the player count over the life of DBD doesn't indicate a dying game at all
---
What makes the least sense to me about this perk is that once someone dies the debuff just weakens.
---
Definitely Jeff, he's been through some shit and keeps to himself (though, in game he's kinda loud)
---
I still don't understand why her crouching speed is so slow, even slower than Nurse. Ok, maybe it's to avoid easy ambush hits but she needs to stay crouched to ambush people out of gens, to mindgame between walls or to make pressure in the map. She is similar to Wraith but he can at least walk faster while invisibile.
---
I mean, you can't deny that he's bad but yeah, he isn't the best, and I don't see him thinking he's the best killer, sure he's cocky, but I don't see him thinking he's the best killer as he uploads matches with at least 2 survivors escaping. And also to reply to Cheshire, I just went to his channel and none of his videos have any original thumbnail, it's an autogenerated thumbnail and sure the all-caps is a little cringy and a little clickbait here and there.
---
Thats true in a lot of aspects. Thank you for going in depth, I thought most people would just shit on the post. Much love :)
---
Bro you have to be new if you think he's OP. What rank are you?
---
Don‚Äôt forget about his all caps clickbait
---
Tylers: The many speak to us! 
---
Also Tylers: Huh? U say somin?
---
I love FunGoose. His laugh is infectious üòÅ
---
As a Doctor player that's been playing MK11 recently: I'm glad I could see this.
---
Survivor: Dont be afraid of the killer, dont waste resources, always do something.
---
Killer: Learn how to play chase, don't focus on the gens too hard, dont follow survivors into OP buildings.
---
This sub has always had a giant hate circlejerk about him, it‚Äôs kinda pathetic
---
He tweets about reddit post?
---
No problem my guy. I love discussions on my favorite games. 
---
But yeah, the killer has their power, and in some cases, OP add-ons, but the survivors have so much more privilege, What with the infinite‚Äôs that I am so glad they are tweaking.
---
Really? He‚Äôs on a whole other level of enjoyable compared to the other two, especially noob.
---
Since we‚Äôre talkin about YouTubers may interest you into some Farmer John??????
---
I still struggle with the OP buildings sometimes. Especially when you've already injured the Survivor and just need that down, but you end up sacrificing all that gen pressure if you commit. Sometimes you just get those blinders on and it's tough to realize you need to disengage.
---
Why
---
I TOLD YOU, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANY NUMBERS
---
I agree Left Behind needs a complete rework. EGC completely neutralized the perk.
---
Only batteries and low amps are real add-ons. The rest are not worth using
---
/u/jaythebearded
---
His videos are amazing and he's overall just a funny guy
---
There your numbers are. You can see it being at 60k then 40k then quickly to 20k
---
He uploaded a video called "looping a anti loop build" or something like that, I got suspicious so I watched it and oh my god, he threw 6+ pallets in a single min all on the same side of the map, like buddy... That's not looping.
---
Forget prestiging. Maybe do it on survivors if you'd rather run more than one, though I currently have all perks on my P1 Nea and have no intention of dumping any more into survivor until a new one comes out. 
---
After hundreds of hours, I'm finally getting all my killers to 50, then one by one will max them out with perks. I like doing the dailies, but I hate playing a killer who is ill equipped, especially at my rank (5).
---
Yeahhhhhh, they basically said they're going to expand lore and give us cinematics through something called The Archives
---
&gt;I'm disappointed with the MOM nerf it was one of Few perks survivors had that countered tunneling killers.
---
Borrowed Time does that.
---
Decisive Strike does that.
---
Unhooking and trying to get the killer's attention away from the unhooked instead of hiding does that.
---
MoM in its current state is nothing but a free Styptic every match.
---
Please don't stop making these
---
We can complain about it as much as we want, 10 dollars is way too much for one outfit. Remember when they used to do packs of a bunch of different cosmetics for 3 bucks?
---
Platform: PC
---
Type of Bug: Gameplay
---
Description: Picking up a survivor and endgame triggering halfway through the animation will result in the survivor being dropped and the entity not killing them. The Survivor is unable to be picked up again or move.
---
Steps to Reproduce: Unsure
---
Expected result: Endgame kills all survivors
---
Actual result: Game softlocks and cannot end until someone DCs
---
Chance of Occurring: Unsure
---
Force him to M1 instead of chainsawing, also try not to get hit by mid-range chainsaws, it's very easy to dodge if you pay attention.
---
Vs. instasaw: Be really fucking careful, it removes almost all of his restrictions, but most billies cant abuse it well. Just try to loop him.
---
I'd love to see Adam in a Kimono
---
Quality
---
Such a lovely guy, especially when he goes into Rapgodgoose
---
I miss the way the game used to look lighting-wise
---
I love how Claudette has her own spot on the list
---
I never follow survivors into main-buildings, and if a surv is constantly running to one of those tiles (like ironworks, rancid, grim pantry or asulym main-house) and somehow goes down, they're coming off the hook, and never seeing anything but omegablink from me again :D
---
*curious oink*
---
Killer says gg ez when you‚Äôre the only one she killed cause she camped with egc
---
If you *need* a free third hit to make it out of the trial, I've got bad news for you.
---
I like this one, wouldn't be loud at night and would be simplistic.
---
I love how Evil Dead Content now can work as Mini Billy.
---
You know you can just hit "reply" on the comment itself, right?
---
And suddenly you get an infinite loading screen...
---
Happy cake day thoüéÇ
---
I don't get why people keep hitting prestige It literally does nothing but give you some bloody clothes which I wouldn't use anyway since cosmetics are a thing now. everytime I got all perks on one killer/survivor I just kept going thru the lv.50 bloodweb sure It costs around 50.000 bp to get thru 1 bloodweb but that seems to be a lot better than reseting everything and to get alll tiers of beast of prey again Instead they will have to throw you the new perks you unlocked into the lv 50 bloodweb since... there Isn't anything left anymore.
---
I think the grind Is okay people always want everything so fast I enjoy working for my rewards It always feels that much sweeter If I know how much work I put Into It but thats just my opinion.
---
KYF dont count for items or offerings.
---
Winning does not equal escaping.
---
I love you so much now. Keep doing what you do we all love you very much.
---
That is honestly the most amount of downvotes I've seen happen on this subreddit in under 2 hours holy shit. Don't insult the boy Monto
---
üëåüèª okey üòÄ
---
Wat
---
It‚Äôs definitely not. It takes me a few days to get that high
---
Yeah
---
they probably don't like you and want to end the game for you
---
Agree
---
At first, I saw the top one as Lin Manuel Miranda. I was like "Wait, what?" and about to make a joke about how he starts singing throughout the game. "SIT DOWN DWIGHT, YOU HIDING MOTHERFUCKSTICK!"
---
Match making doing it's best.
---
Because the gate is open and I am not letting you go. Other than that I see no point in camping.
---
You literally said that, though. You said he couldn't even be called good because he uses NOED.
---
Ahaha more salt please
---
I could understand that. But this is when there is like 1 or 2 gens left. ;)
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking. I‚Äôm only level 80 and I‚Äôve made well over 10k already
---
I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be that good LOL
---
MoM is broken as fuck
---
Go find it! Unless you're on game or lerys map then get out.
---
I could give two shits.  I loved his videos for 2 years, learned a lot of survivor tricks off him early on but I just can't deal with the NOED he spreads like an infestation to his viewers that can't tell the difference between a gimmick build and a standard loadout.  That perk teaches players the worst habits and stunts their developement as killers and lots of people run it as part of their every game build because of his videos.
---
No need for apologizes hah
---
If saying this makes you feel better then go ahead lmao.
---
Me. Except I keep requeueing.
---
Oh god, why do I keep requeueing...
---
No, you just focus on the three who aren't obsessions.
---
I guess brain damage. That is the reason they camp with gens left.
---
Because they want to get a kill.
---
This why I think killers shouldnt be able to see the survivors, just like survivors cant aee who the killer is.. way less dodging.
---
How does questioning the skill of a player using a crutch remotely like referring to them as a shitty human being or attacking them on a personal level?  You are inferring context that isn't there.
---
I agree helping others should be rewarded but that will open a new can of toxic behavior.
---
As a survivor main mostly. Taking 3 protection hits is easy but encourages me to bring Flashlights more.
---
I can take a hit and Flashlight save all day
---
It's a shitty tactic and only killers who lack any skill sit and camp mid game.
---
Then survivors shouldn't be able to break the game with voice chat it isn't designed for.
---
What else am I supposed to use the flashlight for?
---
The killer would‚Äôve a little confusing and I feel like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Save You!‚Äù would be a little OP, but other than that, it‚Äôs an interesting idea
---
This is why it‚Äôs probably better to just remember where they are. Especially the obvious ones. Don‚Äôt cleanse them. That way the NOED has a higher chance of being easy to find. And you already know the locations to look.

He briefly did original thumbnails, and most people liked them. But he stopped for whatever reason.
---
Easy DC in my eyes... i hate when killers play this way. Like dude stop and play the game

No not november

Main Claudette till u get self care as universal perk

Gotta hit them with the gg ez.. duhh

I guess so. ;)

Is the main sub banning memes or something ?

It might vary depending on your platform and region.  
---
I'm on PC in EU and I've been hearing US is fine too.
---
these games were at rank reset
---
I love Farmer John, it's great laughs and fun games all around. Even when he goes full potato.
---
Killers honestly suffer from DCs more than survivors; our games have become so boring lately.
---
Finally huntress art that isn‚Äôt ultra over sexualized
---
Because they don‚Äôt see it as a team game. They see it as a sole survivor game that‚Äôs all about fun for them. 
---
I accidentally once left a person to die on hook hoping someone would go for that person since I was close on a generator and the killer knew someone was over here. But alas no one saved him I popped gen and I felt pretty fucking bad.
---
when vaulting a pallet, you are carrying them on your shoulder and slowly getting through the window, same with the pallet.

The only viable time to kill yourself on a hook is when you're being Insidious camped in the basement, and your team is being altruistic and not doing gens.
---
I imagine the input lag that wireless controllers have has something to do with the Great Skill Checks being hard to hit consistently on console? As a PC-only player, I honestly hadn't even considered that.  
---
Indeed, totem spawn locations are surprisingly easy to learn, even after they changed them to be more erratic and random. Very rarely do I find totem spawns these days that shock me, although it certainly has happened, particularly on Crotus Prenn Asylum.
---
On the rare occasion Otzdarva makes a dbd video it‚Äôs great too
---
That's why I love campers. Because then, the dumbasses are just sitting their, jerking off while looking at you, and everyone gets a free win! Except yourself of course, but if I don't invest any items, it's cool
---
Lol.  Exactly the moronic shit I don't care about.  If noed loving pussies want to mindlessly downvote e everything I type they are happy to do so.  It's just a fake internet button.  It's the same feeling I get when someone upvotes one of my comments 3000 plus.  None of this matters.
---
That's what I wonder. But the last time I posted about survivors like that I got somewhat bashed on because I brought the killer to them for literally camping the hatch when two ppl (me and my friend) were on our first hook. They pointed at us and tbagged so we would kill ourselves but the problem was the person didn't do ANYTHING the entire match. They had less than 5k points and it was 4 gens in. I cobied and led the killer to them. Ppl said I was a dick but like you said, it's a team based game so why play if all they care about are themselves
---
No one ,absolutly no one nome sir. No one playing legion here( did they realise im a legion main oh shit oh fuck)
---
How about...
---
Do what you do, but if you stumble upon a dull totem, cleanse it?
---
coming from a pig main
---
im not always good enough
---
Oh you can use [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aa6huh/ochido_wanabees_be_like/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app). 
---
I don't know why some people just straight up downvote or are rude to people that are asking genuine questions
---
Ye lol he tweeted about the meme toxic swf meme the other day
---
We're not allowed to give our opinions now? It's not like OP is actively insulting him.
---
What about Deliverance, Decisive and Borrowed time? MOM is damn broken, if you trigger it you can just heal to 99% and heal full if the killer finds you.
---
I'm not. It's deserved. The problem with it is not necessarily the perk itself, but rather the fact that as a killer you have to face it 2-4 times every match, and once you get to the higher ranks where survivors are already really good at looping for the most part, it's just too much.
---
You realise that the goal of the game is to get as many points as possible? Hooking and camping generally does not give many points at all.
---
You can keep your rank 15 camp fun. I literally dont care because i play on much higher ranks which means that i will probably never have to meet you ingame but still lmao.
---
I mean why play a game where you just look at a survivor for 2 minutes straight? I would rather just buy a new game if i was you, but hey, everyone can do what they want and if this is your sad definition of fun. Then have fun.
---
Exactly, sometimes you just can‚Äôt find the last totem because you‚Äôre getting chased down by a murderer with a bigass knife the whole match. It‚Äôs not always possible. Gens are also overall more important than totems.
---
I usually die on hook when I see that my teammates are trash. 
---
Say I managed to hold the killer for a good one or two minutes but no gens get done without ruin. Then, when I go down, everyone is crouching around or there is that one Claudette following you the entire time with a flashlight in order to get a save (they don't get 90% of the time). 
---
There are many reasons that make me die on hook (since DCing gets you banned). Killer with annoying build and or add-ons. Shitty maps back to back (swamps). A survivor burned an offering for a shitty map. 
---
It really depends.
---
Welcome to Reddit.... :/
---
The original comment had nothing to do with skill, but rather he was just a good dude or not...
---
Its not a perfect game.
---
Depends on the senario if people are around the hook why would i leave? If during the match they constantly unhook 10 secs after hooking why would i leave? I need context.
---
What is Cake Day?
---
I remember my first 1mil..then I was sad to see it go so quickly lol
---
Easy to deny their bm'ing by just not going to the gate. Though you'd be surprised at how long those neanderthals would be willing to wait for a chance to be a toxic shithead.
---
that, or turning it off and on again

I'm a giant puppers fan. Because hes at the point where hes played so much, losing and etc is just something to laugh at, like monto, panda and etc. Pugs a good one to watch too. Farmer John has popped up on my radar like 4 or 5 months ago and I've fallen in love with his videos.  Jumpscare Myers is also cool as a Myers lover.
---
Spent 10 minutes waiting for a match as nurse last night. I blinked one time 3 survivors disconnected and the other one found the hatch. 
---
I‚Äôm not even good at playing as nurse they all would‚Äôve survived anyways lmao
---
Obviously they aren‚Äôt talking about the cocky super altruistic team. More the match to match camper.
---
Atleast make it 110% or atleast a bit faster Than surviors
---
I dont know that. I need to see his gameplay tbh.
---
cant you just drop them to basically make ds pointless?
---
You didn't question his skill, you outright said he couldn't be called good. "Good" in the original context wasn't inherently referring to his skill, it was more broadly used to define his character and behavior.
---
If i‚Äôve had a good 2/3 minute chase and no one has done a gen and I see them all running around doing nothing I consider ending my suffering that will be the rest of the match.
---
If the killer is face-camping me and I don‚Äôt fancy hanging on the hook bored for 2 minutes while my team does gens I may suicide.
---
If no one comes to save me after a while and they are all just urban evading around or searching chests i‚Äôm out.
---
Can't really blame you. 
---
After MoM got released I tried playing Pig or Wraith and every time MoM triggered, I wanted to go back to Nurse.
---
If DBD was real, Survivors and Killers could just jump or walk over some obstacles they loop and get looped around.
---
Killers would also use their free hand to protect themselves from a flashlight beam instead of using the one they're holding a Survivor with.
---
Killers would also not waste time wiping their weapons each time they get a hit in... or, since the Entity wants them to hook the Survivors most of the time, they'd probably not even bother with weapons and just ram into them and beat them up until they're too weak to resist, or something.
---
Survivors struggling out of the Killer's grasp, DStriking them, getting flashlight saved or getting unhooked would also need to be healed before being able to get up again, instead of being magically healed.
---
Only ten minutes?
---
You don‚Äôt but it‚Äôs easy to assume that because that‚Äôs the only thing people talk about when it comes to camping. 
---
The ones where as soon as someone‚Äôs downed they hook them up and just sit there looking into your soul.
---
In a chase, in which 3 or 4 gens get done by my teammates. Killer finally gets me. I get taken to a hook and stared at until I die. Literally put on hook, killer moves back two steps and stares. Not even looking around for survivors (who by the way are on gens because I‚Äôm wiggling). ;)
---
Panda is a terrible killer.
---
Go on, stand there and wait for that yellow bar to disappear, I can wait
---
That's honestly nothing so dont even sweat it.
---
It was a lighting bug that happened sometime after the Halloween DLC released, where the map's lighting was replaced with Haddonfield's while in spectator mode. This is what it looked like.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt be working if you‚Äôre at a rank where you‚Äôre getting unfairly camped. 
---
To each their own.
---
I feel like the only people that would buy them in the first days/week would be people that were already planning to buy it with auric cells. Everyone else would either already have the shards and be kept waiting or still need to grind and not be affected
---
Thanks I think most people on reddit are just genuinely terrible people but it‚Äôs good to see some people are nice
---
Been there. A killer once chased me across the entire map, I even passed a couple other players. Pallets, windows, dodges and not one gen started. It was like the killer and the survivors were working together.
---
Be on the look out for Enduring/Ruin/BBQ&amp;C/M&amp;A I‚Äôm Shrine though
---
You're right, I should have made a meme about that
---
I got really lucky with this one. Second attempt with fragrant tuft, tombstone and a Lery‚Äôs offering. I get all but one but accidentally down the last one. No clue where the hatch is but I want my achievement. I drop her enough to heal a health state and she runs for it. As I chase, I realize the hatch is not 20 meters from where we are. She books it and I catch her 2 meters away and that awful sound plays throughout the duration, reminding me how close I was to failure
---
Tru3 has some serious ego problems
---
I recommend Farmer John
---
Works at rank 9. Agree that it probably doesn‚Äôt work in reds just because people are better. ;)
---
Soo good that
---
-cant have good clips of himself playing
---
-cant come with a good comeback

-relies on giveaway videos to gain subs

---
WHASSAAAP!!!
---
Every time he gets stunned or ambushes, he yells  WHAZUUUUUUUP
---
Say yes to the pig.
---
Not you personally, the kind of people like you and the previous guy. Constantly complaining survivors, wanting to nerf everything, crying about every build, BM'ing any time you win and begging for nerfs every time you lose.
---
I think it's at 1h 43 minutes of the stream. If I remember well
---
I think they are as fair as keys, which can be found in chests.
---
Was there a buff ?
---
Exactly. Not toxic. Just takes them a while to catch. First down and the killer stares at me harder than Tuft of Hair Myers.;)
---
YES Mandy YES
---
LUL at those down here pretending "don't tunnel" is a legit game feature and not an entitled complaint from the survivor's imaginary rulebook
---
Ebony Moris are Extreme broken.
---
Are Instaheals fair?
---
Not on Xbox. 
---
Overly altruistic survivors allow camping to work in all ranks.
---
Hi, Facebook? My Nurse Gameplay is in this comment, and I don‚Äôt like it.
---
Instaheals*
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I try to do. Just walk away. Go find hatch. Close it. Etc
---
Tons of people say Claudette for her immersion and Self-Care. However that only encourages a player to hide all match and not be a team player and as you rank up, that‚Äôll be become less helpful to you. The most successful and fun (in my opinion) games are the ones where you and the team are cooperative and bold with your time. 
---
Dwight is definitely my top choice for starters. His perk, Bond, is invaluable and even as a veteran player, I run it every game I can. You‚Äôll see who just got chased off a gen that‚Äôs almost done so you can top it off. You‚Äôll be able to find friends for heals. You‚Äôll see a teammate going in for a save so you can use your time more efficiently. Heck, it‚Äôs wonderful even for Hex totems and killers are that extra protective. You can see your teammates find the totem and if they get chased off, sneak it to cleanse it. Truly invaluable to new and old players and the range is actually quite good. His other perks are good too and if you use Bond to find teammates and stick together, all actions go by much quicker for everyone. 
---
Feng is my second choice for starters. Her perks let you keep tabs on the killer‚Äôs location, work on gens confidently as you learn the game, and make a quick getaway if you are discovered so you can get some distance on the killer. She‚Äôs my main squeeze now so I am a bit biased but I really think all her perks are great for beginners... higher ranks not so much.
---
"Welcome to the Internet"  
---
FTFY
---
I would agree with real, observational, not emotion filled criticisms, but sadly that isn't the case, when ever I want to have a civil discussion with someone, they just turn it into insults and "memes" I am more then willing to have an actual conversation to get an understanding what a certain circle see me as and why.
---
I like them on either side because they can change the games flow drastically, which is nice. I do however, notice a lot of abuse once one is suspected of being abused. Abusive post-game chat and tunnelling are usually what one has to deal on either side.
---
ok thats awesome. youtube is glitching but I still saw it.
---
gen teleporting is telegraphed, but its hella good for him. as for "sleep cycles", I enjoy the way it mirrors doctor, but isn't exactly the same.  the fake pallets also make me hyped for that rework
---
I mean even if you hadn‚Äôt body blocked &amp; afk‚Äôd it‚Äôs not like the outcome would have changed much. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre blocking the basement where if you had hit them they could still run- you would have had the realization that they need that box and the rational thing to do would be to camp it and slug them, right? Nothing wrong with that
---
My bad.
---
Pretty sure most people on this sub think tru3 is more toxic than either person you stopped watching.... so thats why
---
I really don't see your point. I'm not trying to say that perks and addons are equivalent. Just venting out my hatred for that perk.
---
Yeah I just noticed her perk for locating survivors when healing is pretty good so I wanted to level her for the other killers guess I‚Äôll just have to gruel through it !
---
Why do I get the feeling the unedited version says ‚Äúyour virginity‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm on PS4. On any platform if you join a lobby with altruistic Claudettes then it doesn‚Äôt work I guess. ;)
---
My mistake, I thought a perfect game was 8000 points in each category. =P
---
You could argue that for a lot of things
---
Ik, but on the bright side he‚Äôs streaming DbD right now!
---
Thanks! I'll keep that in mind.
---
I'm fine with it. Not fine with the battlepass. Would honest to god rather have lootboxes than a battlepass.
---
Give me that "it's optional" speech all you want: so are the store items right now, and so are lootboxes. With a battlepass, you're forced to grind if you buy it to get your money's worth, and that kills my drive to play the game more than anything else. Play anything else or dick around too much and you're wasting your money. We've already got so much to grind for as is.
---
I‚Äôll have to try and get used to it whilst I get her perk that‚Äôs the only reason I wanted to play her tbh it is a shame though because her blink is really cool
---
It's clear a lot of care and passion went into it and I wanted to share it with other new players, as it seems it isn't well known. Hope it helps!
---
Disconnects
---
OMG I can confirm it doesn't though
---
I'm not salty, you can play how ever you want. I'm just disappointed that you want and choose to play in a way that is detrimental to the DBD community. I greatly enjoy this game and community and players like yourself  make it harder for others to not get fed up with it and leave the game and community.
---
You're literally coming into a community forum to complain about not being able to immediately and instantly down a survivor being unhooked and preventing them from playing the game any more at all the rest of the match after being hooked by you a single time. It's a similar level of disappointing toxicity as spawn camping in a shooter game.
---
I kinda fucked up, i played against 2 swf players and after i finished the game they called me a camper, they kept talking shit so i lost it and said some racist shit. I kinda feel bad, i even called them slaves. I need to work on my anger problems.
---
Ehh. 
---
Keeps sweaty Nurse mains out of my games so it‚Äôs welcome.
---
Thats unfortunate :( im sorry you had a tough day.
---
People take this game so goddamn serious its insane.
---
I enjoy monto mainly because he plays the game as a game. Noob3 is someone i don't really enjoy watching for personal reasons, but like monto, he just memes the shit out of the game and just plays it. Zubat has skill and knowledge but still memes the shit out of this game, he doesn't give a fuck and just deals with whatever dumb shit this game and community throws at him.
---
This guy treats the game like some competitive fighting game and starts boasting about it in the titles of his videos.
---
How anyone can take this asymmetrical game &amp; the player base serious to the point of taking it into your videos is beyond me.
---
DBD isn't THAT shitty, but holy fuck, have I realized that memeing on the game is way more fun than taking this garbage seriously. And I've been playing fighting games for over 10 years. This guy taking the game this competitive and using words like "mind-gaming" etc just makes my eyes roll to the point where i can see my last braincell die.
---
Yeah this community is toxic as hell but nobody gives a fuck. Anyone who thinks they're a pro in dead by daylight (Like, a professional.) is just shit at other games.
---
fucking OchiDO wannabe
---
Not that unfair. Mori‚Äôs make the game interesting and survivors can bring keys and instaheals to get out easier. ;)
---
Thanks. I will have to check it out here soon.
---

Everytime a new surv/killer is made, they make shitty brown cosmetics

How about keys are they fair?

You could see the recently played with i think
---
Step 1) Afraid of NOED? Equip *Small Game*. Find totems. GGEZ
---
No problem son.
---
Consider how frustrating it is to play with potato teammates who do literally nothing after you got chased for 6 minutes.
---
What i do is open task manager, close dbd and steam with tash manager then enter through steam library and click play.
---
Pug is toxic and is a bad representation of our community. I wouldn't recommend watching him.
---
You were able to dribble the survivor a few times to a hook but not anymore since the rework
---
monto gang
---
Yea but it has to be a perfect game emblem wise
---
&gt;It could potentially make mind games almost too easy to just suddenly be able to shut off your terror radius after a short time.
---
That's literally part of Ghostface's base kit and what they said it would be used for
---
*Shmashes keyboard*
---
You have to some self-awareness and see how you appear right? 
---
If someone clicks on your account and reads the comments, it comes off like they're watching Darksydephil. You need to realize that by thrashing like this you objectively prove and justify all of the criticism you get.
---
And no before you think "It's not criticism! It's insults!" maybe you need to step away from your twitch chat. Because that is a real "Hivemind".
---
obviously. moris, keys, instaheals are all imbalanced.
---
Totally agree. And he has seen it - I came here from his Twitter. The man is just how he is, I like him. Yeah he goes on a bit but hes a northerner like I am, we all go on a bit and this stuff must get to him. Hes just too proud to show it so he attacks back and it's a vicious circle. 
---
Honestly, Dbd is literally the most toxic game/community I've ever been part of. I adored this game at one point, was rank 1  soon after every reset, played hours every day for a year, but my mental health got so messed up with the actual players moaning and messaging and toxicity that I had to quit. Was pulling my hair out and becoming just as toxic and critical of other players. 
---
Anyway, sorry to "go on" but cant we all live and let live.
---
If the gates are open and im on the hook with almost 20% of escaping then ill just suicide, i would feel bad if you died because of me.
---
Is that what he says? I've been trying to figure out what he was saying all this time. This still doesn't make sense.
---
He should be jealous. Working at McD's nets you so many free fries, and you know what being a Youtuber gets you? People asking for feet pics.
---
Do you have proof?
---
Ussylis is good too
---
Yeah but wouldn't I have to message every single player and ask them it it was them?
---
All right, thanks for the tip, I might buy the Spirit.
---
All right thanks
---
I don't run Mettle of Man. I guess I'll keep eating shit on account of Mettle of Man users.
---
I think it's a shitty mentality either way, because you could easily turn it around. A new survivor is not gonna be incentivized to run non-meta builds when killers don't, and a new killer is not gonna be incentivized to run non-meta builds when survivors don't either. There's no point handicapping yourself in the name of one-sided sportsmanship.
---
Then you get hooked and face camped for looping him for 10 minutes...
---
Lol did you see his video titles for his MK11 videos? They were so hilarious.  ‚Äú HIGH MMR RANKED GAMEPLAY!‚Äù
---
I was in a match as Feng against a Doctor that took a liking to me after he chased me for three minutes. He finally switched off from me and the other survivors were going down pretty fast. So at the end of the match, Claudette is on the hook and he finds me going in to save her, I was injured and he downed me, carries me to her hook and stares at her as I try to wiggle out. She dies before I can and he turns around and drops me, then leads me to hatch. Claudette sends me a message, accusing me of sandbagging and playing with the killer, says she had a key and was looking for me to escape. She died with just under 12k, I escaped with 27k.
---
Two matches later I load in against a Doctor again, two of the survivors DC'd immediately after being downed, the other one suicides on hook, and the Doc leads me to hatch again. Look at the end screen and see it's the same Doc.
---
One of the best DBD YouTubers I‚Äôve seen, deserves more recognition
---
Panda Bear Feng??
---
Props on the downvotes
---
I'm defending myself against lies and exaggerations. Want to give me some logical criticism not based on your emotions? I'm here in the echo chamber, already -3 downvote (to be expected) but that doesn't mean anything I'm coming here as you won't come to me. I'm all ears.
---
You called it. lol He made a post on Twitter about this post. I use to like him as well but his ego is through the roof at the moment. He's a nice dude, doesn't get mad that often but he thinks he's a god among men in DBD. Which, he is pretty damn good at the game but yeah... Don't need to say it himself. And honestly, the meme is has a hint of truth behind it.
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
What is with the intentional stupidity of this community? I swear, it's the only one that fucking ignores all context and semblance of logic in order to continue complaining about the tiniest little shit. 
---
Explain to me the part of hanging on a hook with nothing happening that involves you doing something? Please, I'd *really* love to hear this insight of yours that explains how motionless inactivity is gameplay. It's got to be amazing.
---
Or is it, perhaps, not insight, but overwhelming idiocy that leads you to equate hanging from a hook with nothing happening to *struggling against an Eldritch entity that's trying to eat you.* 
---
But no, maybe you're right. Maybe it's *all* gameplay and the game should just do all actions for you. Run around for you. Fix gens for you. Loop and juke the Killer for you. And only when you decide you're done 'playing' should you have to press a button.
---
Eh he gets on his toxic rants and etc, but everything that he says about the game is pretty damn true. Being toxic to a bunch of rank 20s is shitty, being toxic to a bunch of red ranks is pretty expected. This toxicity seems to flow around rank 13-7. Either way still love watching him sometimes.
---
If you hear a ding dong make sure to stay exactly where you are and teabag for 5 seconds
---
- definitely not the Wraith
---
Is lad the new bro?
---
Fed up with what? You just have to accept the 1st hooked guy is a goner and go genrush on the gens most far away from the hooked guy. I do check gens that are close ready to chainsaw back to the survivor in case some1 decides to go save him, but I can't afford to go to distant gens. So if 3 people focus all on a gen, they can likely get to like 1 gen or even exit gates IF the 1st hook is late, like I still have to down one guy to get a hook. This is the counterplay. I won't earn any points for that game, even if I manage to kill another guy at the exit gates with chainsaw and then camp him. I could even get -1 if they play very well / I play bad. But you guys are just too greedy, always going for the saves. This same concept exists in other games. You can't beat a guy with an awp if u have shotgun, u go on the open field and then complain he shot u with awp while ur shotgun only reaches 3 meters. Well ofc. Or in LoL, you play adc and die to an assassin, then complain adcs cant 1v1 every1 at 2 items. Well ofc. Etc.
---
They're about as unfair as shit like NOED, Adrenaline, syringes, and a handful of other items and perks. I think they're all fine since it's unlikely they'll be used every single game. DBD has some strong shit in it but also a lot of mediocre things. It's balanced enough in that respect.
---
Who is spirit?

As much as i love the new Deathgarden, Glen is correct.

yeah I 10000% guarantee you that your friend is lying and probably calls people the n-word in postgame and that's why he got banned. Cunt survivors don't get banned unless they do something really fucked, they just get promoted to "Fog Whisperer"
---
Anyone that does not choose stun is lying. You passed the test.
---
Could be bad frames or something, or maybe a low rank killer
---
Oh his community is shitty, just like ochido, horrible communities. But I just turn chat off and watch. But if puppers is streaming, hes usually the one that's always on
---
I don't see any reason to excuse his toxicity.  He is supposed to teach and represent our community.  Being toxic to any rank shouldn't be expected, and he acts like a manchild when things don't go his way.
---
Yay, love you too buddy.
---
It already is
---
Oh and I forgot the classic:  
---
\-While I am hooking and turning arround I see every other survivor 10 metres in front of my, not doing any gen progress, trying to get my attention/trying to lure me away from the hooked guy using their emotes.  
---
Nope, I am standing right here, because while this guy is bleeding out on the hook you guys are doing literally nothing.  
---
(I didn't want to edit my post because it fucks up the format)
---
I've had a few like that.  Most recently 12 days ago.  Got 3.6k upvotes.  It felt the same as all the downvotes from the angry mob defending noed crutch and Montos use of it on here lol.  I just type what I think.  If people like it okay.  If people don't like it okay lol.  It's just a fake button.
---
&lt;3
---
Which can be countered in 7 ways.
---
New feature: pidgeons.
---
You can also use Whispers to let you know where survivors aren't at almost all times.
---
True
---
How can you not understand what I‚Äôm saying lol
---
They are annoying, but from the survivors side, they have flash lights, insta heal, keys, etc. It‚Äôs all annoying
---
For MoM to activate they would have to win 3 chases in a row while taking a hit. If you let that happen you deserve it.
---
just build lol
---
It's that beautiful voice
---
Thrilling Tremors is exclusively a tracking perk, not a stall perk, because it shows you what gens are blocked, so you know on what gens survivors are, so you know exactly what gens to pressure after you hook someone ( practically it's a BBQ 2.0 ). This perk will probably be great for a gen build with Surveillance, Discordance, maybe Corrupt Intervention ?
---
But the other 2 perks are straight up garbage.
---
Really nice drawing but did you just mash cosmetics from other survivors? Feng's Trapper mask, Nea's biker jacket, and Claudette's Hallowed Blight pants look basically identical.
---
Thanks, when would iridescent heads become relevant to me?
---
Thats not a thing, for me my most recently played with is TF2 even though i played DBD, so that recently played with for steam is disabled for DBD.
---
It doesn't take a lot if skill. It truly doesn't.
---
I'm not afraid and that's not my point.
---
Probably his accent, it's so beautiful dude.
---
‚ÄúOy, that‚Äôs an albeenooooorrr‚Äù
---
As killer with BBQ I average 50-60k BP a game, so without any streamers etc... thats only 20 games to hit a million.  So maybe closer to around 5-6 hours, if you have offerings that give you double BP etc.. tho it can be a lot less.
---
Who said Kobe-ing us just for unhooking yourself?
---
Bruh that's a full blown drae
---
Username checks out
---
Yeah, that could be it. I find their tracking to be pretty meh. Who knows, might have just respected you and ran away lol
---
I don't see them as unfair but they definitely provide a major advantage comparable to something like an instaheal. 
---
I'm a killer main who dabbles in survivor. 
---
I only saw Mori's as a bit unfair back in the day when they didn't require a hook and you could Mori anyone on their first down. Even then I still miss it sometimes, especially when I run Dying Light as getting the obsession dead super early can be pain. Other times a survivor is being an asshole and I miss being able to be toxic back via a first-down Mori. 
---
A majority of the time the green (ivory, aka kill 1 guy) Mori was simply used on the first survivor you downed to get one guy out of the game asap.
---
Getting camped after the last gen makes sense, so it‚Äôs hard to argue. Camping players during the game makes no sense and shouldn‚Äôt be done, since survivors can just gen rush you then (camping only works at ranks like 10+ because players would rather sit there and stare at you or look for ruin instead of just doing gens)
---
In the statistics, it says only around 20% of people used self care.
---
5. I would say situtational, if all the gens are done and the killer has NOED (one of the 1 hit down perks) i would not recommend to go for help, probably you will meet the same end
---
Ahhh well that sucks.
---
Hope you have a great day man!
---
How do killers inflict the exposed effect onto survivors and is there some indication on the HUD to show that you‚Äôre exposed? Thanks.
---
Is that a challenge?
---
im rank 6 b
---
i just have never played freddy
---
Survive with Friends. It means you're going up against a party of 4 players. At higher ranks, most likely these players will be very well coordinated, and have their own Discord or something. Has a reputation of being toxic. 
---
The game is not balanced around 4 close friends with communications, so things get ugly fast.
---
RBT, tunneled, hatchet, Nurse, escape.
---
Thank you.
---
I've been running Rancor on my Freddy alot. Usually I can one-punch-Mori the "Meta" of Man user at the end after ignoring him all game.
---
Tbh the stun noise is my notification sound
---
Yes and no. Morris's are either rare or ultra rare so the chances of getting mori'd every game are astronomical. But when they are a thing it's only one game that can be more interesting
---
It was like this for 2 games. If kept going while I was in another game. Once I finished the second game  it was around -40 billion blood points until it reached zero during some point in the third game.
---
I'm responding to comments specifically mentioning upvote or downvotes on reddit. Lol!  It's called staying on topic when responding to a reply lol.
---
What is swf
---
Survive With Friends it‚Äôs a function on DBD where you and up to 3 friends can que up for a public match together in the same lobby
---
Some perks do it. 
---
A few killer power add ons do it. 
---
And a few killer powers do it. 
---
The indication for being exposed will pop up on the right side of the screen saying ‚Äúexposed‚Äù and there will be a skull icon until the exposed effect has gone away. 
---
However, killers with exposed power add ons/powers (like Iri Head huntress, or hillbilly/cannibals chainsaw) will not show up. Meanwhile, Michael Myers‚Äôs tier 3 exposed status will show up.
---
I mean your ears are pretty big but all ears seems a bit of an exaggeration.
---
I get messages all the time on xbox, I usually don't respond unless it's neutral. If it's absolute salt like what you're getting I just laugh and pat myself on the back
---
No you're level 6 lol.  You are rank 20
---
You're welcome! Im glad it did.
---
The Irridescent Head is Ultra Rare adding for the Huntress (Killer who throws axes), they normally function as a simple ranged attack but the Iridescent head allows thrown axes to insta down
---
" You cant get mad when you tunnel and get punished for it"
---
See the "Survivor's entitled and imaginary rulebook" part of my post.
---
But i guess yolo saves without consequences and Scooby-Doo chases is whats the majority want, lul.
---
I do it as Killer and honestly expect and don't mind it as Survivor. Once the gates are powered (and ESPECIALLY if opened and the collapse started) Killer's pretty much out of options and has to camp.
---
We dont know if the teleporting has a cooldown though. So it might not have a cooldown at all. 
---
Not to mention what being in the dream world will do
---
Why the hate on Tru3. He is one of the best streamers in the community. AND he isn't toxic.
---
Omg same dude, I made a loop of it as my ringtone.
---
Who‚Äôs perk is this? Might have to haha
---
I have nothing against the single person mori, it is a great way to deal with SWF groups. But the Ebony Mori which allows you to kill all four is just kinda dumb. Killing all 4 is to much, it also offer less points if you kill all 4 so it is just for the memes or to BM. IMO anything that changes core mechanics are not healthy for any game, for example moris or insta heals.
---
105%¬†|¬†4.2m/s
---
It's fast enough so you don't lose insane amounts of map pressure however it's also slow enough that you can't effectively pull scummy Tactics like Crouch tunneling somebody with a reverse bear trap.
---
No one should be, we must protect queen Amanda.
---
Anyone who complains about camping when gates are powered hasn't been playing for very long. It's pretty much expected against most killers.
---
I would take that instead of the shitty speed we currently have rn
---
no the rank at the very top right is purple and the number is 6
---
I wonder if BHVR will redo the wraiths mori like they did redid his blade wipe animation.
---
Because sometimes camping is the best choice, if you are playing against very overly altruistic people they will often leave the gens just for to wait by the hook till you leave, or it is at the end of the game, then you will just lose the kill.
---
There's no entitlement here you ignorant ass.  They made the perk to prevent tunneling, and you're getting mad that you keep tunneling and it keeps fucking you over. If anything you're the entitled one who thinks he deserves to have every kill with no inconveniences.
---
Object of obsession ladies and gentlemen .
---
imagine being stupid enough to equate not wanting to mash spacebar during second phase to auto-looping and juking a killer lmao
---
mashing space isnt a skill check, its not challenging, its not engaging, its just annoying and pointless. removing it will have 0 negative consequences (see: phase 1 has no mashing)
---
On some maps the red ring Is harder to see, especially if it's the first skill check and you aren't prepared. Some people are color blind as well and have a harder time seeing it
---
Looks like you guys won
---
Oh shit lol.  I was looking at your devotion.  Your rank isn't even shown.  Gotcha
---
huh? i didnt mesh any cosmetics together. claudettes pants are brown and thats just a regular jacket?
---
every time
---
Emblem wise your map pressure wasnt superb. I mean gold is good but yeah. An iridescent in that emblem will require like no gens to be done or have the game take forever with little gen progress
---
Even if you tunnel as hard as possible MoM will still activate with M1 killers after being unhooked the second time. The only real counter for M1 killers was facecamping or tunneling with a Mori. 
---
Or silly "one-punch" builds involving around Insta-Mori via Rancor after ignoring the obsession all game.
---
it also counter killers who are not tunneling. I think the concept is cool, but the + outweighs the - making the perk a staple in almost all builds.
---
His face when he finds out tunneling isn't something you can be banned for.
---
Yeah. I get camping if it‚Äôs altruistic Claudettes but it‚Äôs the face camping because I wasted your time that really annoys me. ;)
---
Depends on how it happened. Some perks can do it, some powers can, chainsaw killers can all down a survivor from full health. If you are a survivor there will be a skull debuff on the side of your screen.
---
For real. Where are our quitter bonuses? Its absurd.
---
I‚Äôm okay with borrowed time but 99% of the people I see don‚Äôt run it. I‚Äôm in the green survivor ranks, too. You would think it‚Äôs common sense especially at this kind of rank.
---
can you explain what they did to bloody ace that's different?
---
Started from the bottom and going farther to the bottom
---
It's always a good feeling when you've been running the killer around and he is like "you know what, fuck this guy. I'm outta here"
---
It doesn't just counter tunnelling Killers (which it doesn't even do well), it counters all M1 attacks. This makes weak Killers weaker and strong Killers stronger.
---
That said, having MoM make you exhausted is a good change and is should also not activate when already exhausted.
---
Everybody gangsta
---
Till [Redacted] starts [Redacted]
---
Dude borrowed is a must. Im gonna get what we both want out of this exchange.
---
The both perks have different purposes. Whispers is good for finding the first and the last survivor ( even if it's not too needed anymore with EGC ) and also it can help you to waste time in empty areas in mid game. Thrilling Tremors let you know what gens you should and shouldn't pressure after you hook a survivor, like BBQ. I don't see a reason to compare these 2 perks. p
---
Its always the ones running the cheapest perks that bitch and complain üòÇ
---
I‚Äôm fine with Green and yellow moris but Ebony. Ebony seems too far.
---
*Deletes yourself from existense*
---
oH JESUS FUCKING CHRIST ASH RUN
---
WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU IDIOT METTLE ONLY EFFECTS M1 ATTACKS
---
OHFUCOHFUCKOHFUCKOHFUCKOHFUCKOHFUCK
---
OH FUCKING GREAT ASH D/C'D FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK'
---
OH FUCK THEY CLOSED THE HATCH
---
Wait, were you the person I recommended the zedge app for it? Also I remember your name, did you post the thing about changing pigs mori to a snoot boop?
---
Tbh i would wait until rank reset to get this achievement for trapper since he is one of the weaker killers
---
The first guy covered a lot of this but I want to get into more detail of Obsession Status.
---
During a match, if any player is running an Obsession perk, the Obsession‚Äôs icon has the entity symbol on it (you probably know this already).
---
Depending on the perk, this status could be a buff, or a debuff (generally a debuff).
---
All of Laurie Strode‚Äôs perks and Ash William‚Äôs Mettle of Man are the survivor Obsession perks. However only Sole Survivor and Object of Obsession change anything for being the Obsession (just makes them a bit stronger)
---
However, if you are not running any of these 4 perks and are still if the Obsession, you‚Äôre probably fucked.
---
At present, there are 6 Killer Obsession Perks. The only two where it‚Äôs good to be the Obsession is Save the Best for Last and Play With Your Food. There is no real way to tell what‚Äôs what until you get good at the game. The remaining 4 perks will probably have the killer focus you down as their perks are tied to you being hit or being dead.
---
TLDR; The niceness of Obsession status varies on who is bringing the Obsession Perks.
---
The old one is way brighter then the one we have now.
---
\#amandagang
---
spread it m8
---
(not related to ur comment. do not lewd the oink)
---
you clever fuck
---
Moris absolutely shouldn't be what they currently are. They are definitely fun, but in a highly competitive game they drastically swing the balance. In my opinion they should be changed to being able to kill a survivor that's on death hook. That way it's still a fun mechanic but it doesn't absolutely destroy the balance.
---
it might even be a work
---
I'm team Daddy Myers
---
And I eat apples every day to keep the doctor away
---
Redownloaded game recently and I went from rank 1 to rank 18. Now I get reported for ‚Äúderanking‚Äù
---
Killing yourself on hook and DCing are the exact same thing, except for when you suicide on hook, theres no punishment... that's even more of a dick move to di than DC. Instead of being punished for doing something wrong, you do the same thing in a way where you're allowed to keep doing it without any risk of being rightfully treated? That's just being a dick and a little bitch. Just think about it.
---
And so what you get trash teammates or bad maps back to back? It happens to everyone, not just you. So dont act like you're special and this stuff only happens to you, and for the love of God, PLEASE don't kys on hook! It screws what little we already have left over!
---
You can still jump through the hatch downed
---
Wraith needs to hit the survivor with his bell and Trapper needs to push them into his traps ala Kung Lao.
---
You‚Äôre new so I will inform you of the rules since this post will probably get taken down. 
---
Block out names if you put salty post game chat as a post. 
---
and just leave the match after the game is over next time. no ggs no nothing.
---
I did BOOP THAT SNOOT.
---
He says "You get the cap, emotes, and linkage. Welcome to the Tru3munity." The cap is the Sub Badge. Emotes are self explanatory. And the Linkage is a word he made up cause it fit with his line but it means they can post links in chat. And Tru3munity is like Community but with Tru3's name in-front of it so it's pretty cool. 
---
Took me a while to figure it out too. lol It's a pretty cool thing that he says to everyone imo rather than just saying "Thanks."
---
Yeah just the animation of her never going down messed with my head.
---
Holy shit report them ASAP and show this to the devs. 
---
They deserve to get banned or punished.
---
YASSSSS not many pig mains out here I guess
---
Before the mods see it and it's removed but you probably need to block their names, might cause people to witch hunt them.
---
She probably spammed that button lol
---
Did you camp the guy who died?  
---
Points show that might have been the case.  Though, calling you the N word with the hard R is completely uncalled for, people will roast you to hell and back just from being camped. 
---
What was the daily (quest as you called it)
---
Somewhat a stall perk. In a way, it's like applying a 16 second PGTW to all gens not currently being repaired.
---
Awesome!
---
Imo you didnt even do anything remotely wrong lol. Its not like you are passing some artwork/cosplay of as your own. You just used a pic for a meme template. And you even mentioned you didnt know the cosplayer. Sometimes people get a little over eager around here.
---
Mori.- i'll let the nurse choke me.
---
Tunneled- doesnt mean i'll get down and killed.
---
Hatchet.- its not based on RNG if i escaped.
---
5 blink- just cause the have five blinks doesnt make them good. Even bad 4 mans can have people escape.
---
Escape? Is there something special when stunning miss piggy.
---
&gt;How can killers incapacitate survivors with 1 hit?
---
* A Myers in [tier 3 of his power](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Powers#Evil_Within)
---
* A Huntress using the [Iridiscent Head](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Iridescent_Head) add-on
---
* Someone using the [Devour Hope](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_Devour_Hope) perk with 3 tokens
---
* Hillbilly using [his chainsaw](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Powers#Chainsaw) to hit someone
---
* Bubba using [his chainsaw](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Powers#Bubba.27s_Chainsaw) to hit someone
---
* Someone using the [No One Escapes Death](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_No_One_Escapes_Death) perk when the exit gates are powered
---
There's more, but you get the idea.
---
&gt;How can survivors jump off of hooks alone? Is it luck by using the attempt escape prompt?
---
It's pure luck, unless they are using the [Deliverance](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Deliverance) perk.
---
&gt;What is the obsession status? Is it a buff or de-buff?
---
Survivors using certain perks have a chance to become the Obsession. The killer has perks that can interact with the survivor that is the Obsession, e.g. [Save the Best for Last](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Save_the_Best_for_Last).
---
&gt;Are totems linked to the killer‚Äôs perks and if so why do they appear if the killer doesn‚Äôt have any?
---
A totem perk is a perk that is deactivated once the matching totem is destroyed. One popular example is [Hex: Ruin](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_Ruin). Totems linked to a perk have a flame effect. If the killer is running multiple totem perks, multiple totems will be aflame, and you can't tell which is which.
---
&gt;If I am one of the two final survivors and the other is hooked, should I help them or look for a hatch?
---
That's ultimately up to you, but two survivors having a chance to escape is still better than one, so I'd go for the rescue unless the killer is camping.
---
&gt;Should I invest my blood points into one survivor and one killer or spread them across multiple characters?
---
The grind is slow. I'd personally put points in characters whose teachables I need before I start investing points in a survivor I find aesthetically pleasing or a killer I enjoy. You'll have an easier time once you get a full meta build together.
---
&gt;Is it necessary to purchase DLC survivors and killers to climb the ranks?
---
You're gonna need teachables, and waiting for the right ones to appear in the Shrine of Secrets can take a long, long time. If you want to climb fast, you're better off buying the DLCs.
---
&gt;Since I don‚Äôt have any friends that play this game and I‚Äôm kind of shy (no LFG), I only play the ranked mode. What attitude should I be entering matches with? Just have fun? try as hard as possible? Etc.
---
Entirely up to you. Just know that people in this game can get very toxic, and that certain playstyles will earn you more favor with people, e.g. not camping or tunneling as a killer, or being altruistic as a survivor.
---
If you're in Europe and want someone to play with, feel free to PM me. I don't do microphones either, but I can show you the ropes. I'm not great either but I've been here since 2016.
---
having just bought myers, I can say offically
---
do it pussy
---
I will fucking kill you either way
---
Get out pls. Go and study on the Pig.
---
I've caught survivors off guard with Monitor and Abuse many times. It really helps in catching survivors.
---
Rank 1 on ps4 EU, rarely get 2 hooked
---
While Tru3 does have a pretty big ego, he's not toxic at all. He doesn't send his fans after people and he rarely types in the chat afterwards unless it's just "gg". Getting mad at a game doesn't mean he's toxic cause I know he can get a bit salty.
---
Thank you for the advice and knowledge.
---
Ok...?
---
It sucks when you actually enjoy Legion for reasons that aren't because old legion was exploity as hell.
---
I used too, and I feel it is a totally ok, but I usually hook someone then use my bbq to go find someone else, as I get more BP for chasing someone than camping anyway
---
Aww shit is that a dead meat reference!
---
Had this one. One potato kept hiding in lockers for like 10 minutes. He went in , went out , went in, went out and so on. Guess he was a kid that was frightened haha.
---
i dont want a new killer or a new map until i get my shirtless myers.
---
They just look really similar, the red jacket with a black undershirt and black gloves, the pants loose fitting tucked into tall boots. Nothing against it, still really good artwork.
---
Isn't this moot now that all survivors join at the same time?
---
I'm okay with all offerings and items in the game.
---
If you get in a chase, look for elevation to get an edge and get your burst. 
---
Balanced Landing is *really* good on Haddonfield where the sprint can help you lose line of sight quickly. 
---
Just pray you don't get Shelter Woods as a map.
---
I appreciate the compliment, the only intentional inspiration was the trapper mask, but i can see where you‚Äôre coming from
---
Killer Main, the Yellow Mori is just a fancy way of sacrificing the last survivor and has no real game changing value, the Green Mori is strong but only works once and works well with certain perks.
---
But the Ebony Mori? Fucking Overpowered with no reason to be used if not going for the achievement or just looking for some toxic fun.
---
I disagree. Whispers can be used for finding the first survivors and find survivors mid-game, like any decent tracking perk.  
---
Thrilling Tremors is more of a tracking perk than a game delay perk in my opinion, which is why I decided to compare Whispers with it; both of them are supposed to track survivors.  
---
I honestly just can't see myself ever using Thrilling Tremors unironically; it's just not as good as any other perk that's already in the meta.  
---
BBQ can be countered, yes, but it takes all 3 survivors to counter it in a way. Any killer that would be able to use Thrilling effectively(any high mobility killer) would be able to use BBQ to higher efficiency.
---
Dude, they only nerfed his slugging and they also made Adrenaline destroy him like any other killer, but Freddy was even at release the same killer without a chase power which could be looped for 5 gens, but didn't realise that.
---
You do what you think is best. Just prepare yourself for one salty end game chat. Or leave :)
---
I played against an Ash yesterday as Trapper who used MoM, Adrenaline and an instant heal medkit. Even with stbfl stacks I couldn't stop them from getting out the exit gate.
---
And even then you can use Balanced Landing by dropping from the tree or to the basement.  
---
Balanced Landing is on par with SB for the best exhaustion perk imo.
---
Hatch still appears the same as it always has. All thats changed there is that it opens no matter what if there's only 1 survivor on the map
---
God. I just got this one done the other day, this one was a BITCH. Either I had games where people DC‚Äôd, only hid in lockers, or managed to get out through hatch. When I did finally get it done, I got 2 hate messages telling me how trash I am.
---
True.
---
But the game is having a free weekend. Let's see hoe many stick with it.
---
That said, this is essentially a new game and I hope it does well.
---
Looks interesting enough that I'd like a console port.
---
Kindred is a generic perk, anyone can use it.
---
My point was to make survivors wasting their MoM before end game, because in end game, that hit would literally be a free escape.
---
That was not an answer I would have expected
---
Oh sorry I‚Äôm dumb
---
Thanks, are you on Xbox? Or is there cross-play so which platform I am on doesn‚Äôt matter?
---
The rest of the video contains me being chased for another minute and then being camped and tunneled till death.
---
Really wasn't meaning anything bad about it, definitely way better than I could draw a concept, just something I noticed. Her braids look a lot thicker and better in your drawing than in game too.
---
ahh okay ty usually when i get in a chase i just look for pallets but i guess i should get to high ground, it makes more sense now ty guys :)
---
It may be pointless, but I think the main reason is "if they can run BS perks, I can run BS builds." I think that is fine. It is up to the killer for what addons they use.
---
With what you disagree, I said the exact same things like you. Did you read my comment ?
---
See: phase 1 has nothing happening.
---
You're a moron. Goodbye.
---
Guess she still would have made it regardless with me shaking off my weapon.
---
jUsT  cLEansE tOtEmS iTS eZ
---
Ebonies and ivories are 100% op
---
Play killer to effectively farm BP. Playing Doc with a farm build can net 50k+ a match. Grinding solely as survivor is tough.
---
How did you get to rank 18? Isn't the threshold 15? I got to rank 11 and I went to 15 after reset.
---
Nah tru3 is more toxic. Noob isn't anywhere near as bad
---
I‚Äôm new what‚Äôs a mori
---
please find a good support system and some friends
---
Yeah. In that situation your only option is to close the hatch before she can jump. Since you can't grab survivors out of it anymore
---
what the fuck is this hellspawn
---
Pain Reliever is my fav dbd Youtuber.
---
Everyone forgets that otzdarva streams dead by daylight
---
Man this sub is obsessed with shitting on Tru3 recently. Why do you guys care so much?
---
Anyone remembers the old Brand-New Parts? (BNPs)  
---
You basically just had to TOUCH a gen and after a quick moment it was done.  
---
I would say 4 survivors running old bnp's &gt; Ebony memento mori.
---
But this shit has been fixed.  
---
Are these Items+Addons and Offerings still unbalanced? Hell yes, they are.  
---
Red Key breaks the balance.   
---
Insta-Heals (Especially FOUR OF THEM) breaks the balance aswell.  
---
So do green and red moris.  
---
It shakes the game up a bit and can bring in some action and chaos, but unfair and unbalanced? Yes. Since most of the time only one side got these bad boys equipped.
---
Yup. Should have done that instead of the initial chase. Oh well. Still learning.
---
Yeah, seeing a lot of the harsh comments are stupid and unnecessary. The meme is pretty funny cause you know it's not what he actually does but all the people making shitty comments are just uncalled for. 
---
Tru3 may have an ego that gets the better of him sometimes but he's honestly not a bad dude. He's not toxic either which is what this community needs. I'd rather someone with an ego like Tru3 who thinks he's a god yet "complains" when he loses (Even though he doesn't really do that often but oh well.) but isn't toxic to the community rather than someone who has an even bigger ego than Tru3 and is the most toxic cesspool of DBD, like he who shall not be named.
---
Forgot to say *Colorized*

on it
---
Sure it's still a thing, but it's an isolated thing. Survivor spawns are random, totem spawns are, kind of random, but not really. Totem spawns are random in the sense that each individual tile containing is procedurally placed when the map is generated at the beginning of the game. The placed tiles themselves though have static spawn points. Survivor spawns on the other hand are completely random, and they can spawn anywhere. Sometimes with a totem up their rectal cavity, sometimes not. It's luck, really.  It's a risk you run for running ruin. The potential non use and loss of that perk slot.   
---
As I said, you may think the solution to this is flipping it so survivor spawns are static per tile and totem spawns are completely random, but that would present an even larger balance issue where killers could memorize potential survivor spawns per tile. If you don't think that's possible - people already do it with totems. Does it suck? Yeah, but given the system we have for totems, the current solution is the best one.  Besides a periodic refresh of tile totem spawns. It's not simply a matter of "fixing it".
---
Yeah. Good luck with future matches
---
I wish disconnecting was punished already. When im killer I get atleast 1 every single match.
---
I can't really see how Whispers and Thrilling have different purposes; both of them are tracking perks to me.
---
Likewise, you‚Äôre quite invested
---
It depends on how trash my team is. Playing survivor at higher ranks, I expect a certain level of experience and skill.
---
I got this my first try. Wait until rank reset + like 3 days.
---
OK mate.
---
PC, unfortunately. There's no cross-play yet.
---
she locked the hatch and she was trying to hook him up after she closed it lol
---
The only other place you didn't mention that exists on the maps we have is "behind the exit gates". It's all chance, really.
---
Good work ! Im halfway there :p
---
Amazing except now everyone thinks you‚Äôre a serial killer.
---
Exclusive cosmetics are going to be in the rift
---
Yeah i know "Killah only want EZ 4K :'o " yada yada
---
While whining about being "tunneled".
---
Playing since 2016 told me that "tunneling" usualy just mean that the survivor lost, and he doesn't like it.
---
No prob. 
---
[Here's](https://imgur.com/pqS0CAe) an example of how BL came in clutch for me earlier. It's the only reason I got the hatch.
---
Wait you didnt get 4 idiredcants tho, not perfect game
---
As a killer main this hurts me lol. BREAK THE PALLET FFS
---
i find you quite fascinating that you‚Äôre so openly human garbage so yeah i‚Äôm entertaining myself
---
Thanks man. Wish they'd do another free to play weekend so I could show my friends how great this game is.
---
Balanced Landing could be insanely good because it makes for unintended loops.  
---
An example of an unintended loop a hill next to the shack window; you can fall from the side of the hill then vault the window without getting the stagger(no need for Balanced Landing in this case)
---
He sticks his weopon up the survivors ass
---
Poor piggy. She probably thought you had Dead Hard. 
---
I've made that same mistake a few times myself.
---
No idea. Its been like 4 months since I played though.
---
If you're getting fucked over by ds so much, then you're likely tunneling. Deliberately going after one survivor constantly is tunneling, and ds is there to have some sort of defense of that. Get over it.
---
Honestly, Tru3 should probably look for another game to pick up. I know he's really good at DBD but I'm sure his mental health isn't the best after all the shit he gets just for being good at the game. And I have a similar personality to Tru3, where we are competitive even in a game that is horribly balanced like DBD because we just like competition.
---
He also isn't a bad dude either. He could be ochido levels of toxic but he's not. He just has a big head which tbqh, he's kinda earned it with how good he is at the game and how much shit he gets from the community, I'm sure he's tired of people calling him bad so that could have been what had him develop an ego. Not his fault.
---
She did not walk to any of the hooks nearby and just walked in place IMO.
---
Mori animations could actually affect gameplay; shorter mori animations are better time-wise.
---
You mean the LORD OF PLEBS. Yeah I am also one of his followers xD it's a miracle, some ochido fan who likes watching truetalent. I actually enjoy both
---
Its an action a Killer can do to a downed survivor (either via perks or mori offerings). Upon doing it the killer will kill the survivor by their own hands and eliminate them from the trail instantly
---
Skill checks?
---
It's currently free on xbox rn though
---
If people are complaining now just wait til rifts are $20-$30 and buyers don't finish their tiers during the season...
---
dude i played hag for the first time with only some teleport range increases and i got 3 double pips, and im at rank 8
---
Just farmed with a Pig. A survivor dc'd so I went to his hook and tbagged him with Piggy. 
---
She let us farm and I sat in the basement so egc could kill me.
---
Depends on what their fix is. If gets turned into 3 protection hits they pretty much extinct the only meta survivor perk in a year :/ and before people start going of I dont even run MoM because its not needed, better perks or more useful ones to equip in those limited 4 slots. And honestly I didnt think of MoM as such a big deal. Not every killer is M1 and even if he is, just give the survivor an extra smack. ‚Äúbut zomg have you ever faced 4 mom DS adrenaline deadhard squads?‚Äù Stop comparing a perk when used in its most extreme form lol. I see it on average ran once every 3 games? Is it horrible in 4 man SWF? Sure. Is it horrible when facing random solo‚Äôs with 1 mom? Not even close. Is it as bad as DS used to be? Nope Nope Nope.
---
To me balanced landing is two perks in one because you get a sprint burst and no speed reduction from dropping. 
---
Yeah high spot and fall off and run.
---
Wut? Pls explain
---
Been coming to this sub less and less. These Tru3 posts are just ridiculous. There are so many other streamers that actually deserve to get criticized. Tru3 isn't even toxic. Don't get it.
---
\[DATA EXPUNGED\]
---
I never see hatch only when it‚Äôs endgame. Maybe I‚Äôm just blind lul.
---
It's cause people know they will get a rise out of him. He doesn't take people bad mouthing him kindly so he sticks up for himself but sadly that's what they want. He is a pretty nice dude the few interactions I've had with him. He could be ochido levels of toxic but he is honestly the opposite of it. He tries to stop toxicity.
---
Are you implying that sitting there and looking at the "attempt escape" prompt is more interesting than just sitting there?
---
Do you know how you can nerf NOED?
---
Break all 5 totems.
---
Instead of adding stuff to the store, I'd rather see bug fixes and QoL changes.
---
Self Care takes twice as long (if I recall correctly), but only takes one person off of the objective. It mostly becomes a problem when everyone is self caring and not doing gens. Sometimes it's also beneficial to get that heal from a teammate when you need to make a quick hook save. That's why I'd encourage Bond over Self Care.
---
Makes kinda sense seeing as this add-on store thing originated from phone aswell.
---
Yeah right, hes just a guy who wants to enjoy the game and entertain his community
---
I don't think FireMouse is talking about OP. The meme is funny and not really hurtful but there are so many people on here that are just shitting on Tru3's name for no reason. People are allowed to give their opinion but most of them are being extremely disrespectful and some even are saying he's toxic which he really isn't.
---
10 mins wtf? 
---
I find matches as survivor within seconds.
---
She Identify as a transgender boy
---
I completely forgot common map offerings existed!
---
True, though I do not know if all the current Mori's have the same length of time. I would hope if it does come to pass they make any newer Mori's the same time length.
---
Well...Judging by rifts and archives we will have both simultaneously
---
This is one of my favorite games ever. The community is definitely toxic but you get used to it
---
I definitely did too when I started out. It's all about awareness - looking around while doong gens to find your escape route if the killer comes by. Try to know which way you're going to go before you need to. The more you get in chases, the easier it'll get. Youtube has some great looping tutorials as well - they're worth watching.
---
That's not true at all. lol He actually uploads quite a bit of both him messing up and losing and of him winning against both shitty Survs and really really good Survs.
---
good chat mocking, appreciate it.
---
Well played my friend.
---
I play on PC. Wish it was cross-platform. I did, however, tell my console friends to grab it.
---
Unfair? Not necessarily, but they definitely aren't fun to play against.
---
Still roughly 32 seconds off a gen is very costly. If you want I‚Äôd run a medkit instead. 
---
I never heal unless I‚Äôm on last hook but I run adrenaline so if I get unhooked I spend the rest of the game running around or doing a generator and refusing heals. 
---
In dbd you want to have as much time as you can on a gen. Even a second matters.
---
Oh no doubt i completely wish for bug fixes and such. This is just an idea i think would be cool in the future.
---
Enjoyed reading this
---
You are sub normal
---
apparently itds about to get a lot better so mabye come back in a few months or get it as part of a free giveaway or something
---
I can't stand ochido. Dude is just a cesspool of toxicity that does nothing for DBD community other than ruin it.
---
Battlepass.... buy the pass and earn the skins before the season ends. When the season ends the cosmetics in the battlepass will not be purchasable and be/remain exclusive. Imo not even close to exclusive cosmetics since pretty much everyone will end up owning them. But you cant buy em ever again after the season so technically exclusive cosmetics.
---
It‚Äôs one of the things that got me to watch him more, he‚Äôs competitive but doesn‚Äôt take it to heart like some people in the game
---
thats exactly the point, nothing negative comes out of not mashing during phase 1
---
probably baiting, can't possibly be this stupid
---
I don't think their animation team works on bug fixes.
---
Ah the memories üíñ Honestly so proud of myself that I started playing this game in 2016 and not 2018 or 19
---
yes
---
Nah baby dwights still have that honour, and don‚Äôt dc
---
Oh but they were actually just 99% the crwap out of the gens
---
Why does EVERY Billy I see have NOED?
---
I see you have your clown outfit on like you always do.
---
I do not struggle on hooks simply because it had already cost me a keyboard. Fuck 'supposed to be uncomfortable'. If I didn't knew Mr "just go play Civ instead" is incompetent to begin with, I would have to assume he's being paid by keyboard/controller manufacturers.
---
just smash that shit already
---
Thanks you! I've definitely heard good things so I'll need to try it out. My second concern is if my laptop can run it well enough to justify the purchase. I have a Surface Book 2 with an 8th gen i5 processor. I'm not sure if you know anything about computer specs and requirements for this game but if you (or anyone else) does then I'd also appreciate input in this area!
---
It's obviously there so it builds tension you know? The constant threat of carpal tunnel and your keyboard fucking breaking keeps you on your toes you know? It's not like you can just sit there calmly and sip on you coffee you dum dum.
---
Damn seagulls at it again
---
Noed to lmao
---
I never would've guessed.  
---
What I'm saying is that instead of investive resources into art(art team for this game is amazing), they should invest in bug fixes and QoL changes.
---
It is one of my favorite games as well. It is rare in my experience to see toxic players. I try to always be friendly myself. The price of this game often is the price of a nice meal at McDonald's. If you think you can spare that i say it's worth it. If it is too toxic for your taste it was just a temp meal like mcdonalds.
---
Tru3 is arrogant and whines about every group that out plays him... Personally I thin Hybrid Panda puts together a much more entertaining stream,
---
yeah this photo is extremely photoshopped
---
Lol why the needless insult dude?
---
see im on ps4 and i cant block them fast enough before they get a sarcastic comment off about me bringing a mori
---
What part of "nothing happening" implies "something happening?"
---
Plot twist they were 99ing 5 gens for some reason
---
This is beautiful, I‚Äôd love to see the other killers done by you, great work.
---
Idk why but Monto always kinda bugs me, i always get like, a diet salt vibe from him where he wont go full Tyler, but just be irritated very often.
---
What resources? The programmers are working for and being payed by BHVR regardless of what the rest of the studio is working on.
---
A 4K isn‚Äôt enough nowadays. Now you have to double pip to get the adept killers, while still using only their 3 teachable perks. It kind of sucks, and makes it way worse to get Adept Killer over survivor.
---
Would suggest NOED since you are using Blood Warden, but it might become a dead perk for most of the game and when its time to shine comes, they could cleanse all the totems and basically play 3 perks freddy
---
That's not what he says.
---
Toxic??? He doesn't do anything toxic.
---
Doesn't teabag, face camp, he won't attack people in the post game chat. I'll admit sometimes he does get salty or triggered but who doesn't with this game sometimes? But he doesn't do it often in fact he usually admits when he messes up or gets beat.
---
If you think he is toxic what do you think of players like JenDenise or AngryPug who will actually rage at people and talk shit all the time?
---
He could break the pallet or use his power to vault over, yet did neither.
---
I have 1000 hours of DbD play time on Xbox and 1300 hours of play time on PC. 
---
Yes, DbD is worth buying. It's one of the most fun games I've ever played.
---
And yes, the community is incredibly toxic. You just have to not let the toxicity ruin your experience too much. For me, the fun outweighs the toxicity. Besides, there are some really cool people that play this game. So, its not all bad!
---
Finally, the game does have troubling balance issues. Generally speaking, good survivors are the most powerful thing in this game. Only the Nurse can take on any survivor group and do well. Some killers have add ons that make them overpowered, but those add ons are usually rare. You shouldn't encounter them too much throughout your play time. 
---
All in all, I recommend Dead by Daylight for you. The developers don't particularly have a great track record, but they do care about the players and are currently making SLOW changes for the better. So, this is a good time to join.
---
I'm mostly of the same belief. My Claudette is only level 6, so none of my Survivors have SC. I just carry a medkit if I need it, and trade off heals if I run across someone else who's injured. Otherwise I'm not really that worried unless I'm going for an endgame/killer camped hook save.
---
Theoretically, it's because her ambush travels at 160% movement speed.  It might have been seen as too much of a free hit?  Then again I would think she could easily crouch walk at 100% or maybe even 105% speed without breaking too much.  92% (4.25% less than Nurse) is just a bit too low for an ability they seem to want to encourage you to use as your normal movement.
---
tunneled
---
The gate's open. Leave.
---
I hope he does so that they actually fix (or at least buff) her instead of leaving her in a really bad spot.
---
Really? Where did you get this information? I‚Äôd be interested in looking into that to see if it‚Äôs worth waiting. Also, do you have any ideas on where could I get into a free giveaway?
---
This is dumb waaaaah can we get rid of this because I can't press a button for 1 minute waaah
---
RIP Ketchup Ace...
---
I kinda felt bad for the Claudette, but I was running Aftercare and I had unhooked her so she could see me. Just like I could see her urban evading around the map üëÄ
---
Nope, I just tried it and survivors are still teabagging and flashlight clicking. 0/10, guide did not work.
---
Whats the hook one
---
she was being so toxic so I don't think
---
Oh, the battle pass, that‚Äôs what he means. I get it now.
---
in the whole game I mean
---
&gt;See: phase 1 has nothing happening.
---
&gt;You're a moron. Goodbye.
---
I assumed that since you called him a moron for saying that nothing happens in phase 1, you have to think otherwise
---
The killer is also a player. If I get forced to play against cheaters when I don't want to, I won't play.
---
That‚Äôs a good way of looking at it, thank you. I think I‚Äôll bite the bullet and try it out!
---
I love when they fail, run away, get downed and hooked across the map and I finish the same gen we were working on
---
&gt;probably baiting, can't possibly be this stupid
---
Hilarious, as I was just thinking the same about you, as:
---
&gt;thats exactly the point, nothing negative comes out of not mashing during phase 1
---
**Completely** misses the entire point of what I said. That statement is the literal equivalent of saying that since not pushing buttons in phase 1 has no negatives, not having to move your character has no negatives either.
---
Again, what part of phase 1 has you doing anything? Oh, right, none of it. Except trying to escape which, le gasp, requires you to push button!  **Imagine,** needing to interact with a game to perform an action! What craziness is that!?
---
Go away, troll.
---
Someone had a bad day. 
---
Do you know this player? Because it seems to me they were trying to get revenge.
---
I swear they break the sounds every other patch
---
He's a dick, even to his own followers and subs sometimes.
---
Thank you for that input! That‚Äôs all really good to know. It‚Äôs definitely piquing my interest. Another comment mentioned that the game will be undergoing larger changes in the next few months. Do you know anything of this?
---
I still think most of what he says can be true even outside of SWF. There are plenty of solo players that know what they‚Äôre doing and can pull off the same stuff.
---
C. A. M. P. F. I. R. E. S. O. N. G SONG !
---
*SPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED*
---
well i got the game for free during the barbeque event when playstation plus was giving it out for free, and the game is gonna get better in a few months because now they're starting to work on game health and all that, because they said it in the 3 year anniversary stream a couple days back
---
wow i would have never thought of that while im getting chased i kinda dont think as much as i should ahaha ty for sharing the clip ;p
---
Nice argument, very well thought out reply that accurately articulated your stance on the issue.
---
I‚Äôm assuming it says ‚Äúyour gun‚Äù based on the context lmao
---
By resources, I mean more time, money and even more employees if necessary.  
---
Bugs have been a big part of this game like the false chainsaw bug; I think those things should be addressed before adding cosmetics.  
---
I'm not saying that adding cosmetics is a bad thing; it is what earns Behaviour a big part of their money, but their art team could just work on in-game animations(vaulting and such); to refine their in-game animations and maybe put less effort in art.
---
As a sweaty killer main, this was painful to watch.
---
I'd definitely like special mori animations to be added to the game eventually as well.
---
He's always on a rant everytime I tune in. Today I was tuned in for a few mins and he was going on about how toxic the reddit was for the other meme about him the other day.
---
Does steam stream now?
---
Is this me?
---
ahhh i have 1 question, how would you loop the killer with the high ground because once youve got exhaustion they would just be able to catch up as they dont stagger from falling either?
---
No, I was the one saying nothing happens in phase 1. He's the one insisting that phase 1, where you're not interacting or performing an action, is the same as phase 2 where you *are* interacting and performing an action. Making him the one who thinks otherwise.
---
Awesome have fun!
---
If only it were easier to not rank up. I don‚Äôt want to have 10 throw away rounds for every 2-3 normal rounds just to stop ranking. I basically play until I inevitably hit red rank then stick to survivor until reset.
---
it seems so simple but i never thought of it hahaha ty for the tip
---
Ah I see. Thank you! So maybe it‚Äôll be worth getting on a deal. Do you think the dlcs are worth purchasing? The DbD + Deathgarden bundle is on sale 40% off
---
I don‚Äôt know much about the guy but from what I hear he‚Äôs known to be wrong and rude. And apparently camp? 
---
Most of this information I received was from 2 streamers and other people.
---
They fix one thing, then break another.    
---
Why was occlusion added to this game
---
Yeah, I could see this being a Meg cosmetic.
---
From what I‚Äôve seen (luckily), it seems to only be this post. Not saying that I agree or disagree with tru3. It‚Äôs just that cirklejerks are almost always negative.
---
noed is in the game as a feature but facecamping is way worse because its a shitty playstyle you have to properly go out of your way to do
---
Besides how he can react to people disagreeing with his tier lists, I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs ok.
---
It's alright I would too if all of my talks and actions were recorded and being discussed by a bunch of people I don't know, it's just that he streams and you get to see this rants and you don't get to see the average person's.
---
We need more memes like this!
---
Hell yeah, that‚Äôs the best part of any party.
---
Just in case they aren‚Äôt good enough they need to place noed so they can be superior. 
---
Honestly though I would say most people look at noed users as noobs lul.
---
The stagger reduction you get is huge because you vault windows much faster than they do.  
---
Without the stagger reduction, Balanced Landing would be one of the worst exhaustion perks.
---
He is very knowledgeable about the game. If i were to be critical he just acts like his way his right everytime. I do trust his judfement on certain topics.
---
It worked tho
---
Thanks for the quick reply. I was asking this question because someone commented and said how it felt like a bad mobile game and then Tyde said that he was toxic and that it was his job to point out thoughts that plague the community
---
Dude, console survivors are so overpowered.
---
The hooks used to be based on what killer it is, not the map. (In the screenshot you have Wraith's hook on Coldwind Farm)
---
Why didn‚Äôt you do the gens when you realized what he was doing?

I play against him pretty often, played vs him as I was killer the other day and killed him, then he face camps me this game lul
---
theres this in game currency called iridescent shards, you can earn them from leveling up your account, then you can use those to buy the characters instead of using real life money
---
He‚Äôs big burly and while soft natured could could beat the shit outta someone
---
it's a fun game but expect a lot of ups and downs. it's either really great and youre having a blast or it's pure cancer and you consider uninstalling
---
i give it a 8/10 tho it's fun when it's not ass
---
Well obviously noed is a feature because i use it as well, like on Freddy wraith pig. But billy has map pressure and a one hit down with his chainsaw, so I'm sure you see why it's a little weird seeing noed on billy

---
Now that's a pretty big jump, nowhere in that sentence does he call him a shit human being.
---
Ahhh I see ty for clarifying
---
Because I was the one getting face camped, 1 gen left and the other two saved me but things ended quickly after that, tried to find hatch but it‚Äôs a pain to find when you actually need it
---
Because they need the end-game advantage, clearly.
---
do you know what video this was?
---
That backflip into the hatch lol
---
oh yea, they added some
---
Yeah, they're going to be adding more rewards at some point.
---
They're fleshing out the story a bit more as well. 
---
And they're reworking some of the maps to make them more fair.
---
Non-exhaustion Clown?  
---
Staged.
---
But can you make him crouch faster than he can run?
---
Excuse me? Shirtless Huntress.
---
If it's your only option... you do it.  Or die.  Fucking idiot.
---
Brother throwing 6 pallets in the span of a minute is not looping, even if the killer has a anti loop build, you wasted a min of the killers time yes, but you also created a massive dead zone on the side of the map you were "looping" on, Tru3 you need to learn to take criticism bc you honestly sound like a baby when I see anything from you.
---
Ooh maaan, I feel that in my heart
---
because while they work on the battle pass they have less ressource to work on something different.
---
Maybe... he has 3 very rare addons that give status effects to hit survivors after hitting out of being crouched (bleed, broken, mangled), and all 3 include a slightly increased crouch movement speed bonus, too. 
---
His 4th very rare addon just considerably increases his crouch movement speed. 
---
If I remember correctly, he may have an uncommon addon that moderately increases crouch movement speed, too.
---
If these stack, then he could probably crouch at the same speed as his run, yeah!
---
I‚Äôm personally running Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Bbq and StBFL. It‚Äôs working nicely.
---
I think at base Hillbilly is fine. The PROBLEM however is that he and Nurse both benefit far too much from the meta perks of killers. BBQ, etc.
---
So really the problem with them is the problem with basically any other killer. Perks are far too powerful in this game. Especially the meta ones. 
---
Perks shouldn't be game changing in my opinion and that's what needs to be changed. Not the abilities of killers/survivors. 
---
A perk should be a pick me up. Not a ''You just got more powerful than you could ever possible imagine" like the map pressure of Billy with BBQ or a survivor running Mettle of Man.
---
yes show me to all of your varg vikerness cronies on your secret discord server you don‚Äôt want your parents to know about (assuming you even have people who want to associate with you)
---
i love it when incels drool all over me
---
I don‚Äôt see how hillbilly is the problem from what you said
---
What console you on, nurse is great just not as easy to use but you can get used to it quickly, It is possible
---
Wow the hysteria, are you okay friend
---
Didn't know that. That is fucking cool. Thanks!
---
S√≠
---
Yah I like that Tru3 can respect honest good play when he comes across it
---
This is true
---
(full game) + DLC's + cosmetic + battle pass
---
Even f2p-games can learn from dbd.
---
I‚Äôd kill for Jane in the plagues outfits
---
You are the reason *those* Leatherface mains exist.
---
Hillbilly is one of the most difficult killers in the game to play optimally. 
---
And even with a high skill cap, Billy has plenty of counter play. As a survivor, you just need to be efficient with your looping. 
---
His insta saw add ons are BS, but that's about it. Punishing a killer because of lousy survivors is not the way to go.
---
Plus, his commentary when people sub is adorable. "8 months??? 1 more month and we got a baby, baby" and "Can we get some PUP LUV in the chat"
---
need some emo hair
---
u/AltruisticMacaroon

 okay buddy

Theres already the camping/tunneling factor on top of doing all gens with ruin, devour hope, thrill of the hunt mixed with lullaby that make this game unbearable sometimes. Along with all the nerfs that are coming/came to survivor perks because of the whiny bitch killer mains that complain on here all day that think they deserve 4k every match.
---
What more do you want dude?
---
You play with your friends so youre coordinated. Solo can be the biggest of nightmares.
---
It‚Äôs a skill curve that you are constantly climbing, but expect at least 20 hours to become a threat.
---
Let‚Äôs see.  I play Killer and‚Ä¶
---
This week I had several successful games but please remember for me a successful is hooking at least one person and having the game last longer than ‚ÄòSong 2‚Äô by Blur.
---
I actually managed to kill a survivor while playing the Nurse!
---
During a game as the Wraith I had a Survivor just running me ragged but somehow I managed to down them at the exit gates during the end game collapse. They DCed. I take a perverse pleasure that a 50 year old probably made someone half their age rage quit.
---
The last few episodes of the ‚ÄòScare You To Sleep Podcast‚Äô have had adaptions of my stories, ‚ÄòEthel‚Äôs Addiction;, ‚ÄòWaiting For The Miracle‚Äô and ‚ÄòIn Memory Alone‚Äô.
---
However my dog continues to not be housebroken so if occasionally in the middle of a game the Killer just stops moving that could be me cleaning poop.
---
Good ol Uncle Carl.
---
The good ol times where you could place traps under hooks and camp.
---
Quick, drag your browser window down until you can only see the top of her head. That's Shaggy's hair. Shaggy confirmed new Meg costume. Fuck yeah.
---
Wow that‚Äôs not such a bad idea
---
Sadly this is prob last comment i'm gonna put on Reddit. I would ask to go into a nice discussion and have a civil chat but I've tried to do that so much its just pointless now. Have a good one and I hope you start to see a different perspective some day, night man and night reddit.
---
Stay away from post game chat
---
Oh yeah, it is a DC worthy map lol
---
It‚Äôs cute but Spirit can do waaaayyyyyy better
---
Fun fact, he tweeted about how triggered he was about this and then went on saying it was mean spirited. What a joke.
---
Whatcha doin son ?
---
So much this. Hillbilly could be looped like any other M1 killer but with the introduction of Spirit Fury to pair with Enduring, which is now meta, he became harder to loop whilst still maintaining his insta-down.
---
This happened to me last night my friend just got the game on Xbox due to it coming to the game pass. His first game killer brings a black ward so I tell him to be ready for strong add ons, and we get a prayer bead spirit with discordance, ruin, stridor and whispers. On the bright side they were not that good so he managed to escape.
---
words cant describe how this comment makes me feel
---
And lets all at least appreciate the way the Plauge wears the outfits she got at Lady GaGa's garage sale.
---
100 percent yes. As you get a few Hundo hours into the game you‚Äôll notice more bs and what not, but you‚Äôll easily get your value out of the game
---
Good gameplay, funny commentary, and a sexy voice. The only problem with Farmer John is his love of Legion.
---
Sometimes I be sneaky.. but othertimes yeah I am 100% just running until I get resistance then smacking.
---
ü¶Ä
---
Thanks.
---
It would be so much better. Instead of mashing button like a brain dead, you'll have to stay focused to not die.
---
Chillin killin
---
He has a problem with you, check his twitter.
---
It can be decent as trapper, pig or hag but overall I don't like it that much.
---
At rank 1, roughly 3 killers are "viable", and a team of 4 survivors on voice communications still has the advantage.  The Nurse and Hillbilly have essentially been allowed to remain as strong as they are because for the longest time they have been the only killers strong enough to be playable at red ranks.  A whole lot of high rank people would just outright quit playing the game if they got nerfed and survivors didn't get massively nuked to compensate.
---
4 survivors can run MoM and when did I say that I want to be fair? lol
---
Honestly they need to take another balance pass on at least the Trapper, Cannibal, Pig, and Legion.  There are some others like the Doctor and Wraith that could use a little bit of tweaking; but those 4 need actual buffs and not just tweaking to be in a good spot.  Their powers don't currently have enough upside to warrant all the downsides.
---
I still watch his videos, I know people on this subreddit have a hateboner for him which i think mostly unwarranted. People complain about him moaning a lot "Fookin dead ard" etc but Monto seems to whine a lot in his videos as well. Other good people to watch for dbd content are ZubatLEL and more recently FarmerJohn.
---
Fuck off cunt.
---
miss 72 &lt;3
---
You're a very condescending person.
---
There should be a comma in there, might wanna edit, and make sure to add a huge, unnecessary "EDIT"
---
I hope that you don't get too upset with all this criticism on Reddit. You like to state your opinion very openly and that's just how you are. Every person says things that are critique worthy, but I think that you are getting way more critique than you deserve. It almost seems like it has become a meme. Anyway, I enjoy watching your videos/streams. Just keep doing you.
---
Compared to COD4 back in the day this isn‚Äôt that bad
---
The loop tiles with the rocks and everything is also super annoying. Random shapes and lengths
---
There is a disturbing lack of Demi in these comments
---
It will emit sparks until it stops regressing. A generator only stops regressing under two conditions: it has completed regressing the generator to 0% completion, or a Survivor begins working on the generator, even if just for a split second. If you kicked a gen and come back very soon and it's not sparking anymore, there's a Survivor nearby.
---
I like his attitude that as the killer he's like the Dungeon Master of the game. He's here to make sure that everybody has a good time and not just playing to win. He tries to hook everybody at least twice, tries not to farm the guy who just got unhooked, etc.
---
I gotta say. I get that he has a big ego sometimes and some other flaws. 
---
However I still find myself enjoying his streams and videos. He seems pretty chill, if he isnt bothered by anything. And oftentimes even reflect upon himself when he makes mistakes. 
---
And yes. He gets frustrated (or atleast it seems that way) sometimes while playing the game. But that happens to me aswell. Who doesnt have a game sometimes where nothing works the way you planned? I would like to have a little rant now and again aswell. Its completely normal.
---
Also he can get pretty educational about the game sometimes. Which is a plus for me, since I'm a really bad player. 
---
Yes, he does get salty from time to time. Yes, sometimes he has a little bit of a ego problem. But no, he doesnt deserve some of the things that are said about him.
---
I don't know, I dont watch his videos so I don't have a good gauge but his reactions on here don't scream sticking up for himself against bad mouthing. They seem like some who is lashing out because they can't take criticism and instead need to boost their ego. A calm person doesn't run straight to Twitter.
---
&gt;I shouldn‚Äôt be punished for missing a button press by .5 seconds.
---
Hex: Ruin be like hold my beer.
---
That's what I'm saying though; the instant I hit a gen, there's no sign to say that I have hit it. It doesn't shower sparks--I get no points. It's as if I've done nothing at all and seems like a waste of time more than anything.
---
I feels it.. piggy pig pig.. I wish they would give us a costume without her mask.. to mess with the survivors lol XD
---
Honestly that made me love him more its adorable.
---
Do you finish the whole action? Does the kicking animation finish?
---
Sounds silly but I've seen plenty of killers who don't hold in the button for long enough especially if they're in a hurry i.e. mid chase.
---
Sprintburst...
---
Legion isn‚Äôt toxic anymore tho
---
Not silly at all to ask honestly because I HAVE done that on accident, but I always correct myself by holding the button down and completing it after. Still nothing :/
---
you can still find it, kill noed and then get out? unless its an instadown killer
---
Fuck yes I've been trying to show him to everybody I know who plays dbd. He's amazingly hilarious
---
That does not surprise me
---
For what it is rn, I think that you should consider buying it. It's a hell of a lot more fun when playing with a friend(s), though.
---
Using too much NOED doesn't even mean a thing. How dare people use a perk that is put into a game.
---
Kinda like self-care, adrenaline and all meta surv. perks. Does that make people also not good?
---
It's hard though ya know.
---
I see players that really know their shit and are like rank 10
---
And then I see absolute potatoes and I feel pity, I let them live
---
Rank 4...
---
It's hard to tell sometimes
---
I have found it works about the same amount as Hex Devour Hope. Most of the time it is worthless. Occasionally it gets you a few downs.
---
if I'm going to turn and walk away from a hooked survivor then you're not going to do this
---
Thank you. :D
---
In plague its not worth it. Ill use it only with nurse, and even though there are better options. This perks is a lot of fun but really needs a buff
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve just decided to farm for bloodpoints to get better perks so I‚Äôd soon have some chance.
---
they had to sell the ash dlc really bad, so they put in an op perk right after they nerfed ds, what a surprise man.
---
If you can do so in 2 minutes. Yes!
---
People who don't want to cheat? What a concept.
---
I mean Reggie is a sweet dog but damn he is dumb as a box of rocks.
---
And yes he is named after Reggie from PHANTASM.
---
Now THAT was a survivor.
---
No. Your screenshot brought nothing of the value to the sub. 
---
What does your post game chat give to this sub? Not to mention you‚Äôre adding to the loads of already annoying post game chat posts. 
---
Have your problems with the mods, but they did the right thing. He‚Äôs saying grow up because it‚Äôs stupid to bitch about rules that are already in place.
---
Our King is back :)
---
Only real counter to it. Do the gens and get the fuck out. Me and my friends were able to get away last time we went up against Michael with it.
---
they're all shit just watch Az her streams
---
Must be a Hexy fan. 
---
Lol.
---
I mean people keep saying "how can I have fun" but the issue is the objective of the game is to either kill or survive.. Losing isn't fun for anyone.. but if when you do survive it makes it worth while. Like my psn used to light up every game, when I was the killer because salty survivors got mad because.. I would tunnel, them and use them as bait to kill their friends while hooked.. or because they make made up rules that I don't want to play buy..  
---
"The killer should have empathy and a kind heart and let the last person live or have the hatch." type of bs.. lol
---
Lol swing and a miss.  NOED is far and above the biggest crutch perk in the game.  A reward for terrible killers that can't protect objectives or get kills without it.  Literally the only perk close to its level is MoM which is about to be nerfed to uselessness.  Only garbage killers use NOED with how patethically easy our killer games are at this point.
---
Definitely good to have considering how often they break the audio :/
---
Finding totems on those two maps and Backwater is thee worst!
---
The caption is me when i ask for emotional support when I'm trapped in the toilet after an extremely risky meal
---
I got back to purple rank within three days and than kept deranking from dcing killers. I would loop them for 2 minutes and suddenly they dc, in the past it was a visual glitch, but I am actually deranking from this. With survivors dcing and killers dcing on me gaining rank feels like a game of luck at this point. I used to easily hit rank 1 every season and stopped playing around the time legion came out. Maybe it is better now at red ranks, but getting enjoyable matches has become extremely difficult to the point where I just feel frustrated with the matchmaking system and the community. 
---
In the three days I've played I've gotten 5 successful sabos causing the killer to either slug the downed player and chase me, or the survivor wiggling out, but somehow I haven't seen a single survivor on my team sabo save another player or me. I've had only one person flashlight save me, but this was a player I used to meet constantly at red ranks, though it was nice to see him playing still. Also I haven't had a single person pallet save me yet (a couple of fails there too...). I don't remember purple rank being this bad, but at the same time I didn't hang out in purple for long. I see shack pallet being thrown constantly without a single window vault or mind game vault, and I also constantly get sandbagged now by teammates that pallet camp around areas I'm trying to loop, when most of the time they would've been safe working on the gennie while I distract the killer.
---
...Premonition/Spine Chill
---
claudette players usually lack more than that
---
Coming soon: rose gold edition crows
---
I disagree. People I used to play with and we would always try to get as low rank as we can. Right now I'm at 7 which is decent. But also I havent gotten to play as much as I'd like. But anyways, They dont like playing anymore for the same reasons you are saying about killers. Bc we do voice communicate. With the best perks we can think of, and yet the hillbilly just doing the easiest stuff without requiring much skill can win. I feel the balance should be equal. If you're skilled you get out, if youre skilled you kill them. Not it requiring no skill to get out and vice versa. The hillbilly is just too easy to win.
---
I play on console, the frame rate and lag can be so bad that I can‚Äôt trust collisions during spirit walk.
---
I agree with the flashlights, I'm probably just a really bad Killer, I'll be sure to edit my post explaining that the flashlight section is not relevant and that I'm just not good at Killer. The matchmaking, is bad, that's just a fact, and I get screwed by it quite often, it's horrible to be a rank 12 Killer playing against red rank Survivors, and this happens more than you know. The toxicity is something that can be ignored, but the false reports are something entirely different.
---
No I didn't play in the time of infinites, I played seriously for half a year in 2018 up until Legion was released. Not sure why I stopped, I think part of it was I felt like playing against Legion was boring.
---
It‚Äôs my favourite map.. :(
---
Same can be said about surv perks as well. So many crutches in this game but it doesn't matter in the end because even decent killers use NOED. HybridPanda is a good example. He isn't garbage just because he uses a perk that is implemented.
---
Base billy is not fine. He and Nurse are way too mobile without a sufficient cooldown after use. They are the most unbalanced Killers in the game. Billy and Nurse are the only really viable killers at high ranks (with sweaty SWF) for a reason.
---
Billy can spam his power way too easily to traverse the map way too quickly. Yes, this is made worse through tracking perks, but the main problem is him and Nurse‚Äôs main ability. 
---
Playing Billy or Nurse as killer is equivalent to a killer‚Äôs SWF easy mode.
---
&gt;OP:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Okay, first of all (I can not really speak english) I made this "meme" As I said in the comments I have no problem with you. Its just funny hoe you react to swf/laggy players 
---
&gt;Tru3:  
---
&gt;[The meme (pic) is fine mate.](https://twitter.com/TrU3Ta1ent/status/1135310888175583232)
---
I would argue that killers have 5 perks (4 perks plus special power) along with their many other advantages.
---
A lot of the useful survivor perks are exhaustion/cooldown (lithe, quick&amp;quiet), are only useful when you are already extremely vulnerable (dead hard, self-care), or are very situational (unbreakable, adrenaline). 
---
Killer perks have few drawbacks. Correct me if I'm wrong (why do I even say that? I'm going to get corrected whether I am right or wrong lol!) I think only the hex perks aren't applicable for the entire match? On top of that they have their power and also good add-ons to make their power even better. In addition to faster speed, knowing where survivor objectives are, no delay when falling off heights, ability to hit through pallets and beyond windows, the killer has the upper hand. Frankly, I've never understood all the talk about survivors being OP or the killer outcry over things like Decisive Strike or MoM. The game is already balanced in favour of the killer and yet we get posts like this asking for killer buffs and survivor nerfs.
---
Basically, tldr: Killers have 5 perks, change my mind.
---
hahaha fuck off, as if every player who plays this game doesn't react when teammates fuck up a skillcheck.
---
I mean, that is perfectly fine advice. What else are you supposed to do in DS, Just tank every hit and forget your roll button exists?
---
Poor shack pallet.
---
If that map gets a second addition like the swamp it would be a clear sign bhvr doesn‚Äôt play its own games.
---
Interesting... a jump scare build could be fun. Idk it‚Äôd work on Plague per se, but that could be fun on Doc.
---
I clean every totem, or most, before the last gen is complete, if I'm facing a killer that would likely have it. Don't be an idiot, get rid of totems.
---
It‚Äôs like the Entities way of punishing us killers.
---
I love the obsession mechanic, adds a very unique element to gameplay. 
---
*‚ÄùChase this survivor always but don‚Äôt kill them... yet‚Äù*
---
Yo!
---
Look at that survivor salt
---
Buncha snowflakes
---
k
---
This is (sadly) 100% true.
---
I'm so excited. Not all of us are, but I am.
---
Could be wrong, but doesn't everything that is released cosmectics wise for auric cells eventually become buyable with shards as well? Cause I can buy some older things with shards right now that I know were only available with cells on release.
---
Swear they be spinning fast af sometimes
---
There are so many snowflake survivors. My God.
---
Thanks man. For me it was like trying to decipher an ancient lost language.
---
O√∫√≠
---
I love rank 20 killers coming on here to complain about survivors. It‚Äôs okay, you‚Äôll rank up one day.
---
True true
---
She really DCed mid swing omgüòÇ
---
Damn wait is Killing me I have over 2k cells and 500k BP ready to use Ghost.
---
I was crawling and stopped at one point when I was on the hatch
---
That looks like her internet went out instead of purposely dcing
---
I hope they implement the protection hit stack option, let me use Mad Grit more often
---
I do u understand how he feels, it's obi he hates how much people talk about him and how poorly they talk about him, the issue is he has done nothing to try and fix the faults people call him out on, I think the only time I have been on his side is when ochido happened. I do think he can be entertaining, I genuinely hope he can fix his act and understand looking for a "civil" discussion under a shit post is just dumb man.

Didn't know about t1 Myers, t2 still has a pretty low TR tho.
---
As for Freddy, huge difference between "he's around here" and "he know where I'm at"
---
It's a meme perk
---
I just run around the map with a rainbow map as to trump all of the Killer's hex perks and know where all the totems are.
---
Your processor is fine but..
---
The minimum graphics required for DBD is a DX11 Compatible GeForce GTX 460 or AMD HD 6850.
---
I compared that with your Intel HD 620 on the Surface Book 2, and it falls very short. Even on low settings your fps is probably going to be really bad.
---
Oh yea the swaggersouls soundalike
---
Nobody cares
---
*plus he has add-ons that make his crouching speed faster lol ecks dee
---
Can remove it when they actually fix sounds and KEEP THEM FIXED. Fuckers break sounds completely every fucking patch, makes the game unplayable.
---
Oh buddy she can be a very weak killer. She‚Äôs slow and can be punished if she wastes her power. LOS and scratchmakrs can really be confusing. Just like with nurse and huntress, you can really abuse the weakness the power gives them.
---
Nah I got Mori so that won't be a problem
---
well done. they played to piss you off, you played to win.
---
No bale. I spent hours brainstorming on the podcast.
---
Didn‚Äôt the PC version recently have its highest player count ever a few days ago ? It‚Äôs far from dead.
---
Um, shirtless clown is the best you uncultured swine
---
Then they should change it to -any killer-
---
Yeah but the numbers are inflated by steam
---
I was just gonna write this, doesn't matter if you smack your obsession a couple times, you'll get those stacks back *hella fast*
---
I run M&amp;A, Stbfl, Thana, and Nurse's. Keep em injured, and hopefully catch those who try to patch themselves up.

Yassss!!!üëèüëèüôåüëèüôåüëèüôåüëèüôåüëè

Is this a joke? I can‚Äôt tell
---
PS4 omegalul. I guess that means you haven't versed the sweaty PC survivors lol.
---
Eh???
---
Yea like 3 days ago had its highest ever player count, and lots of people are super excited for ghost face, I know I am! Plus ash was a great addition for me so I‚Äôm pretty happy with the game overall.
---
damn kids! get out of my forest!
---
Mom push the button! Hurry I'm almost to the hook!
---
What? Yes it totally is, thats a 25% increase of time left on your second hook, which can have an insane impact on the game if all 4 survivors have it. Even if you hit 100% great skill checks on generators you still wont be making such a massive impact on the game
---
God, I‚Äôd love a stealth killer meta...
---
big survivor nerfs are coming
---
*Wraith wants to know your location*
---
Well the summer sale or e3 sale hasn't come yet so who knows what will go on sale ?
---
Have they said anything about giver her any changes to make them more equal?
---
Mori- If I die to a RBT, it's more than likely my own fault, and that'd make me more upset than something like a mori.
---
Tunnel- Better chance for survival. When you get camped, either no one is saving you, or you'll get tunneled off hook. At least I can take the killer for a run if they come straight for me off hook.
---
Hatchet- If I get trapped 3 times, he'll probably come over to me, pick me up, and no matter what the scenario, I'm probably dead. With the hatchet, I have more than enough time to run away and before she finds me. 
---
Squadette- Nothing more satisfying than popping your T3 EW on a toxic Claudette. Couldn't pass up on the opportunity to do it to 3 others.
---
Escape- How could I bring myself to harm her?
---
Scream came out in like 1982. No one cares about scream anymore
---
From what I've seen so far, Ghost Face could very well be a garbage tier killer.
---
I love how noob3 calls himself a god whenever he makes a really stupid mistake. its so endearing
---
Sauce?
---
How is pressing the same button 100 times more interactive than doing nothing? At least on the first hook you can use the wiggle to communicate with your teammates, and you can look around to get a general idea of the game a lot easier than if you're strugging
---
Honestly it's worse when they make think purchasable with shards for a limited time, like most players casually save up 14k cells.
---
Killers with instadown- Hillbilly, Myers, ghostface, leatherface
---
Addons- Clown- red heads pinky finger, huntress- iridescent head
---
Perks- make your choice, hex: devour hope, hex: haunted grounds, hex: no one escapes death, iron maiden, rancor
---
Exposed icon is a skull
---
P3, previously rank 1 Spirit here; There‚Äôs a few people who say Stridor is meta on her (or at least, they did when she first released), but tbh it‚Äôll throw off your sense of where they are while phasing. Also, one of the best things about the Spirit is her ability to negate/shut down loops altogether. If you stand still at a loop or window when a survivor is attempting to loop, they‚Äôll do one of three things: 1) they‚Äôll take off running away from the safe area, at which point you phase after them; 2) they‚Äôll try to sneak away or go back through the window/over the pallet, at which point they‚Äôre literally jumping into your deadly arms; 3) they‚Äôll stand there waiting for you to make a move, at which point, phase to them and punish their inactivity.
---
Infectious fright is under estimated. That works really well. I've seen a few run it. Dark devotion is whatever.. it freaks me out when I'm the obsession
---
Not really.
---
They said a lot of the killers don‚Äôt get along. I wish we knew what they do when not killing.
---
I have every other achievement in the game except this one, i gave up trying for now. I'll come back after a rank reset or two... 
---
Closest i've gotten was 1 hatch escape and in another match one escaped via gates :/ I've also had multiple people just jump into lockers when they realize what i'm after. Hardest achievement to pull off at a decent rank.
---
Well, like sometimes it's not even noticeable for me, other times there are a few moments when my screen freezes, and in some rare games I go for a hit, my screen freezes right before the hit, and when it unfreezes the survivor 5 miles away. It's mostly bearable, but I don't know and/or have the means to make it better or even know how to fix it.
---
Infectious Fright, really? I hadn‚Äôt really given it much consideration, but it‚Äôd be easy enough to test considering I‚Äôm still learning her.

Ebonies, yes. Ivory, meh. Cypress, should be base

I see you are men of crusaders respect
---
Or there's a real life thing but you don't wanna dc
---
Thank you, and yes I‚Äôll definitely be doing a few more of the killers I like
---
Not to mention the shitty frames as killer, god forbid you get bloodlust as you go for a lunge
---
I think DBD should go f2p and monetize with cosmetics and DLC only.
---
holy why are you mean to him did he do anything to you
---
Yeah I uhh, I can't really watch his youtube stuff any more. He's an incredibly nice guy and I've subbed to him a few times because we need that attitude around, but it's gut wrenching watching him make the same mistakes over and over again lol
---
Thank you! It‚Äôll get easier the more you practice :)  I‚Äôm sure your work is great too
---
Please learn to read. I never said anything about scary movie. But anyway, I'm not going to argue with a troll whose goal is to get some attention because his surroundings don't care enough to give him some.
---
you had to specify ‚Äúfor the meme‚Äù lol 
---
as far as i can tell, tru3 rarely ever brings moris to toxic swf groups lol
---
We didn't bring the offering so we could "abuse balanced landing" we literally always used balanced landing just cuz its our favorite exhaustion perk.
---
"redefined scary movies forever"
---
But you never said anything about scary movie. Shittlebrick.
---
I‚Äôm strictly playing killer with this up and coming DBP event! The last one was a total shit show and waste as survivor. Either the killers all camped, had the most OP shit on every game, braindead random survivors, and constant DC with 2-5 party streamers 10 seconds into the game. Shirtless Myers will be somewhat on the friendlier side for his up and coming victims!
---
Is this one of those ARGs I've heard about?
---
You go to the menu and it tells you
---
Oh I thought you meant cuz it makes the recovery from hitting a mettle of man not as bad.
---
you have no idea how often as Myers I just tap survivors, turn 360 and walk away. if I was recording you'd hear a smooch each time I bodybump them
---
Yet another person who can't grasp the concept of a *joke* yet thinks *I'm* the one being stupid. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If *not* being a whiny entitled brat who thinks quickly pushing a button is too hard and something actually worth complaining about  makes me "stupid" then I don't want to be your definition of smart.

You're thinking of JRPG dumbass. This is a survivor action game.
---
Oh yea? I never noticed that! I‚Äôll try that at the end of my next march. Thanks Arizona_Slim!!!!

It isn't. You can play the mobile version on the ghost face leaked build.

I'd play Pig to get revenge and Ghostface once he drops.
---
can you drop survivors after picking them up? I recall being able to do it but playing earlier and I could not figure  it out . I use it to force them out at the end. get off my property!

People who call other people snowflakes are the actual snowflakes. And this is from someone who plays only killer and Feng Min occasionally.

Didn‚Äôt the devs mention that they were going to do a system like this across dbd?

I could go on in length about how many times this happens per session I play of Dead By Daylight. It's around ten times each session, which is insane. I know I could just leave, but why is the first option to avoid toxicity in the game, not even an option the Developers made. That's just screwed up in my opinion, and I think the report system needs to be fixed to better combat toxicity. The report system should notify a player when their report lead to a player getting punished, that would help a lot of things. Reports should also just work, because clearly they don't since toxicity never stops, it just keeps getting worse and worse. I'm just sick and tired of every game being the same old thing. The Developers should've fixed this years ago, but they just don't seem to care.

Because you can counter it??
