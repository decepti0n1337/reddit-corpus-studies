It would be really stupid of them to use it a lot. It‚Äôs suppose to be special, and if it was regular it wouldn‚Äôt be special.

Yeah, it's sleek. He could easily stalk his prey with the streamlined features.

Don‚Äôt think to hard about when to trap, just do it.(unless your build is dedicated to head pops) Don‚Äôt ambush at gens, instead stand up to try to get a gen grab, or just to get a free hit. Ambush just gives too much of a heads up. Ambush is super good at loops and learning to mind game with it is almost essential for pig plays.
---
Try to learn to mind game pallets with the dash. Pallets with low visability are the best to mind game. Insta down piggys pretty fun if youv got the perks, devour hope, make your choice, noed, haunted grounds

Here's the original: [https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/398/4A494UUNC0WZ.jpg](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/398/4A494UUNC0WZ.jpg)
---
I've closed the hatch on survs many times, this has never happened to me before.
---
Needs the JoJo arrow
---
Yeah, I thought maybe the meg was bodyblocking it.
---
Only tip is try to mindgame on palets with crouch mod you dont rly got many options with pig. Use your traps when you can dont wait to save them. Sloe√§w down progress when you can
---
Don‚Äôt trap people when all gens are done, it won‚Äôt work, always approach from the outer walls when trying to sneak up on players that are doing outer gens, as they won‚Äôt suspect it as much, and for the love of god, please don‚Äôt camp

Going back to purple ranks and then trying to learn new killers was the worst decision I made
---
You sound like a fun chap to play with.
---
What‚Äôs your psn
---
Survivor: don't be afraid to be creative with which character and perks you use; they don't have to just be the good ones. It is really, really rewarding to challenge yourself with a unique character design and getting them across the finish line
---

---
Killer: have fun strategizing with perks, but don't over-rely on them. Remember to stay present and use your eyes and ears first and foremost
---
But it's a bot...
---
Aren't the skins already out in the Store, though?
---
can‚Äôt play atm but i‚Äôll be able too later ! (twinklebcby on ps4)
---
Anal beads need toned down and that's it
---
also experiencing this, but time of disconnect seems random.
---
Red rank killer player here. Survivors DCing isn't nearly as much of a BP detriment unless they all leave at the same time. All survs lose a minimum of 5000 if the killer leaves, often double that or more. A couple survs leaving also doesn't automatically end the game like it does when killers leave, meaning there's still opportunities for both parties when survs leave, unless all 4 go, which is extremely uncommon in my games.
---
Ironic.
---
I was fishing to see how many people I‚Äôd piss off from my ‚Äútoxic‚Äù build. Not surprise at the amount, being as this is a survivor dominated sub. Of course killers need the best build possible. It‚Äôs literally 4v1. Stop crying and blaming killers when you lose. Get better.
---
This happened to me the other day. I have been screwed by too many farmers.
---
Me: "No, but thanks for the offer."
---
Killer:"Then yu die."
---
Procceded to tunnel and camp me while farming with everyone else
---
[removed]
---
That's odd, I did it this morning and it worked. Maybe its because i'm on PC?
---
Anyone playing Trapper with half a brain will decimate at lower ranks because none of the survivors know what to look for. At high ranks though he's Wraith-tier unless you're using tar and a stitched bag and have been playing him since rank 20 and know all the spots survivors go to. This is why they need to take these things by rank rather than overall.
---
Hatch closings are no longer killer sided because of dedicated servers. So it seems the survivor had the better connection to the local server than you do.
---
That's what I say, but the response is always... 
---
"bUt Wh3n YOu'R3 InJuR3D, YoU cAn'T d0 AnYtHiNg!"
---
Oh I‚Äôm not shocked üòÇ I knew what I was getting myself into.
---
*says the spirit main*
---
Unbeweaveable
---
I've been abandoned by my teammates countless times and I still stay and take the punishment.
---
Yeah, and I wanted to show, me 360ing, something I don‚Äôt do often. Not trying to say that killers are bad right now, its just whenever I play survivor I usually can‚Äôt do 360s
---
Wtf dude that sucks. Anytime I get a message from (who I assume is) the killer, I don‚Äôt even respond, I just ignore it‚Äîcan‚Äôt farm if I never respond.
---
If the survivors aren‚Äôt leaving it‚Äôs to start end game collapse. As people used to troll and just hide around the map
---
The opposite happened for me. Got into ST because of the chapter!
---
Yeah, cause they are, and thats why I said ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know whats happening right now‚Äô
---
I need to do 5 more missions to complete the rift
---
LOL I THOUGHT THE SAME THING
---
His posts are *pure cringe* because the build isn't toxic.
---
Literally just had an ace teabag me while I was on hook. He was teaming with the killer as well
---
Lol, it's a good show just wished that they added in Hopper as a survivor
---
The hatch "rewards failure" in the exact same way that NOED does.
---
Not only that but it took 3 days to write a full statement on it that they could have easily written up and put out at the exact time of the announcement. I feel like that would have smoothed the waves of fans a lot more than just "unforeseen circumstances. Bye."
---
 There is no such thing as killer shards
---
Also very altruistic, You can sometimes get more kills because they will throw themself at the killer to try and save there mates, I cannot count how many times soon as a door opens I get ditched by randoms when i play survivor.
---
She is definitely Asian
---
Just use MouseWheel Down, it makes life a lot easier
---
Then again new players tend to go for billy due to his simple power but he‚Äôs still high.
---
Yea she had too long, she was out no matter what
---
Cannibal, I definitely don't get as many wins. Cannibal, I know I am probably getting screwed if I am in the insane asylum or the Saw warehouse. I'm 50/50 on the neighborhood/school, and I will SMASH usually on swamp, forest, snow, or that car yard.
---
Hag though? Flexible in any of those imho
---
To start the end timer. Either to force the survivors out of hiding, or activate a perk like blood warden or no ed.
---
Also the wait times take forever. Like 20min on PC just to black pip.
---
Atleast I don't swallow.
---
Survivors are just reskins, you play litterally the most brain dead easy thing in the game, so i dont expect intelligence
---
Well deserved
---
Saying i was wallhacking because i found him on a locker he was hiding for the past 20 minutes
---
On a f o o k e n  xbox
---
So does dead hard. I guess everything has it pros and cons.
---
"I went into games seeing if I could piss people off and then people got all pissed off! What babies amiright? If you disagree well thats just because its a survivor dominated sub"
---
Neat
---
I don‚Äôt know what to say now I just got roasted
---
Pipping is a participation trophy. Surviving/escaping is the real win (unless you where Blendette hiding all game in lockers and take hatch at the end).
---
Spirit main, runs no Ed, haunted, tinkerer, and something else. Imagine having to use any perk other than shadowborn on spirit
---
This is really late, but they're referred to as 'she' because drag is performance based art. The Drag Queen is the art/show/performance/etc. So they are the character they portray-- Much like how Actors are referred as 'she' when playing female characters ( Linda Bob's Burgers ), as they're referring to the character, not the person playing them.
---
Had a match like this myself as the huntress, got pissed of at one guy who kept going for my totems when I had thrill of the hunt.
---
Wanted to let the others live and ju facecamp that one player to death. But nay, they refused to let me do so. Outcome was that they powered the gates with him being hooked last time trying to flashlight me, ended up with noed and killed them all instead.
---
They were so fucking toxic in the end-screen chat, it was unbelievable. But atleast I left with a smirk on my face and a 4k game.
---
Isn't it a special occassion that they've angered a big part of their fanbase?
---
Even with permanent x2 bloodpoints the sheer amount of perks would make it so that grinding didn't disappear
---
Imagine actually having 2 try as spirit, let alone sweat LMAO
---
 Because your timing is off
---
Abso-*fucking*-lutely. Slap a timer on those DC's and watch how fast those IRL issues and internet problems clear themselves right up.
---
Yes the devs will keep it here
---
Earlier today I was Doctor.  2 people left alive and they 3 gen d themselves. one seemed to give up so when I picked him up and he didn't struggle I took him to the hook near the hatch.   Other guy was just standing over the hatch but when It popped i shocked him and he couldn't jump before i shut it. instant DC.  Like comon man. I made a good play and timed it right.
---
I agree that not every DC is intentional, but it is awfully coincidental how many seem to happen after a survivor gets downed or the gens get done a little *too* fast.
---
So what happened?
---
Did you just put 2 holes in a piece of paper and scribble red over the front and then strap it to your face?
---
Really? I always assumed it was from Burn Notice.
---
The way it should be...
---
No i planned it and rubbed dirt and my moms ashes on it cigarette ashes
---
If you manage to bring both deliverance and decisive to endgame the killer has himself to blame
---
The moment they made lockers hard counter BBQ reads we as survivors lost the right to ever complain about BBQ again.  If killers are still getting BBQ reads on you it's because you're willfully allowing them to.
---
The funny part was at the time I was a baby legion. I only had disordienance on and some yellow add on. Meanwhile 2 of them had flashlights another had a green med kit. I was just trying to have a decent game.
---
ill prob be downvoted but I think it should just be a safty pip and nothing more because it could easily end up making killers that are not ready for low rank to be put in low rank and would cause big problems for them
---
I get matches can be frustrating. But if you DC you can't have that great, how did I do that?! Type of match.
---
Dead by Daylight is an assymetrical 4v1 horror game where one player takes out the role of a killer hunting down four survivors. Survivors have to run away and hide from the killer to avoid being sacrificed. "Baby" survivors. (New players to the game who don't understand the mechanics fully) will make bad moves because they're inexperienced at the game. This is just a joke and being nice to a new player by ignoring them and pretending you didn't see them in order to give them more of a chance to play the game. :)
---
Xbox One, sorry
---
&gt;  Can we stop rewarding killers and punishing survivors when survivors dc or when killers have bad internet, tunnel or camp
---
Until a dc penalty comes nothing we can do. But that doesn't killers op. That's just people being selfish.
---
Before if a killer has bad internet there's ping counter so you'd dodge. Now it's just the severs.
---
If the killer is "tunneling" or "camping" then other 3 should rush gens. if you're losing to campers and tunnelers then... 
---
When I play killer I hate when people dc because it's boring, and the other's just suicide on hook, and **I don't** pip from that.
---
5 seconds? DS lasts for 60 and it triggers even if you aren't being tunneled
---
Exactly my first thought
---
Me personally, if the killer is coming and I‚Äôm at exit gates, I go to the edge of escape and I let him hit me into dying state and leave like that: gives us both extra BP so why not.
---
What's body blocking and noed?
---
 Any one want to buy my new invention the Inst-flash , comes with unlimited battery to.
---
I‚Äôm a killer, why do I care about restraining orders?
---
I play like a one thumbed zero fingered moron and I get mercy
---
I‚Äôve never wanted another ghost face to mori me harder than I want them to
---
The two insta-heals, 4-man SWF and the "kys" at the end are just amazing. I got pro-gamered.
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt play against high ranks‚Äù
---
Because you suck or don‚Äôt like a challenge? üòÇ I bet you‚Äôre the type to dc after one down

I know that's what I said. A lot of people say everything is tunneling the definition is muddled by those people. Is that your definition or do you cry about every death, thats the difference in if your opinion matters or not.

Let him keep his chainsaw properties but let him run as fast as Billy at 250% kappa

Other than Nurse

I switch out pip for bbq. Because at these ranks even when I pop something that shit is fixed quick af. And some of these swf‚Äôs are crazy as hell. In like two mins my ruin is gone. A gen or two is finished and insta heals have been popped lol. Shits cray yo. Thanks for the response btw.

You good now?

I do not think I ever see that many ppl claiming its overpowered

Wraith: ‚ÄúA-ding, ding, ding! Welcome to this meeting of the Hookers. I‚Äôd like to introduce everyone to our newest member, the Pyramidhead! It says here he his driven by strong urges of sexual violence. Yes, Kenneth?‚Äù

Clown: ‚ÄúAh, Okay then.‚Äù
---
"No'hoy, scoopy boi."
---
is this like a personal attack or something?
---
The ONLY time it can even be deemed "op" is when the gates are open, and the person is close to the gate (because then they'd need to crawl across the map before timer ends which probably won't happen) so the best choice is to either sacrifice someone you can tell has it or eat it before end game.
---
The average shitpost on this sub takes 20 seconds to make, you're good homie
---
There‚Äôs a surprisingly high amount for some reason...
---
What a coincidence, so do I! What time zone you in?
---
Pick Legion and just exist. For some reason he pips like crazy even if you lose.
---
They're talking about the stun duration of ds
---
LOL
---
And that styptic agent only costs 3000 bp instead of 5000 because it‚Äôs on the inner ring. The syringe only costs 5000 instead of  6000 because it‚Äôs in the middle ring.
---
Old blood webs were a pain to grind through, but at least you could get good addons cheap.
---
Post doesn't even mention mories.
---
Most of the killers will never pick someone up after downing right after someone‚Äôs unhooked. At least no one in high ranks will do that. They will slug you until your DS is over so it‚Äôs not really immunity. Killers shouldn‚Äôt complain about how unfair is this game, when the game is definitely in their favour.
---
Back when Iron Grasp and Agitation were damn near mandatory.
---
No, just a bug with some perks that simply don‚Äôt work, (exhaustion perks) or the HUD not even appearing for either survivor or killer. It sucks.
---
yes that's all i have to say
---
Totally agree.
---
I am a killer for crust sake, why would I care about a restraining order?
---
With Prayer Beads, totally. Without them? Eh, walking the line. There is very little counterplay available
---
It's hard to guarantee a specific amount with DCers, I just think they should be worth SOME points towards an emblem instead of completely cutting you out of potentially 3 won chases and 3 hooks worth of points each
---
Survivors will call a one perk build toxic
---
I‚Äôll give him a shot tomorrow.
---
Who cares about when it came out? People watching it right now wouldn't like to be spoilered.
---
Is tunneling another word for babysitting?
---
Damn that‚Äôs helpful
---
yes it give you something but say right at the start 4 ppl left the killer should not be rewarded with a pip. they should get a saftey pip
---
Hey Siri, how do I upvote twice?
---
Alright good to know
---
I have played the event now and it is literally just hide and seek, honestly more scary for the seekers cause of the traps, first couple of rounds I would rush every door and found out fast that‚Äôs a bad idea
---
It is active for way too long. Not OP but it is overtuned
---
That‚Äôs very helpful thanks for the advice!
---
People who DC once they see the killer and don‚Äôt like playing against them.. -_-
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I hate wraith because they usually go invisible and camp hooks but you just gotta deal with it.
---
Dbd matchmaking at its finest. My condolences
---
Ooh gg ! :3 
---
Love ur nea outfit too
---
I would really like it if the brought splinters in for every killer. I wanna try out spirit, legion, Ghostface and so on before I spend more money on them.
---
Maximum effort.
---
Did you look at the sky to get more FPS for your skillcheck? Because I do the same thing on PS4 lol.
---
The cannibal: if there are no windows or pallets nearby shove that chainsaw ap their arsehole
---
He‚Äôs camping her while on the other side of the map?
---
DC'ER here. The reasons are different. Maybe you had previous bad games and won't suffer through another one or you play versus a killer you hate. Sometimes, it's not even about the killer. You are nearly done with a hex generator and one survivor lures the killer to you. Or they unhook you without borrowed time, when the killer is around. Or you play on the meat plant, the worst map for survivors.
---
Thx
---
They should have used the old actor that played Freddy, I dont like the new one.
---
This comment is too perfect. Sums up my thoughts better than myself lol. This might as well be the post and my post the comment. üòÇ
---
Good solution. Then it would really be an anti-tunnel perk.
---
Oh no, I might get in trouble for violating the order when I *murder you.*
---
Its there to counter the unfair action of tunnelling and only activates if you do so if you dont like it then dont tunnel.
---
I look to the sky so I can see the skill check better LMAO
---
I play both of them. I am a 50/50 player and you shouldn't take memes as "Survivor bad or killer bad"
---
Im mocking both sides when I get the idea for a meme :P
---
One of my friends was an early tester of this and he'd always talk about it. Now that its in early release he never mentions it.
---
Honestly I always get a feeling of dread in my stomach when a match is going too well for too long as a survivor. Idk what it is lately but I've had an absurd amount of killers DC when they can't down someone quick enough. I was livid the other night because they did this about 3 minutes into the match and it took my party streamers and I didn't get much of anything for it.
---
Would you rather him be the way he was before?
---
Here's a solution for you. I know it might be hard for you to grasp, but just don't tunnel.
---
yup only ones who would complain are the ones who do tunnel it would be a very good perk honestly
---
Your face? Yea I agree :(
---
One of them is secretly The Thing lol
---
my SSTTEEVVEE cosplay XDDDD
---
I dont understand this community because it seems so epic for a survivor to hit d strike and get away. Every clip is from console players getting away with terrible 360's or the killer managed to MISS their lunge from a meter away. They are boring. Is this subreddit full of console players who think escaping with DS is godlike? Why is everyone saying "well done" or "nice" when you hit a fucking d strike and leave.
---
See other reply. If you go away and deal with other survivors and come back after 45 seconds, that isn't tunneling. DS shouldn't activate
---
I mean yeah. It was actually good how they had it where you had to put survivors to sleep. I would have also liked to also pull them like off gens and such for them slipping up causing them to be sunt to the dream world and in his arms. I still don't like the fact that awake survivors could see you if you pick someone up. They should have just changed those to be honest.
---
And on the other side why don't they have any cosmetic ls for him. I would like the version from the movies where his Claws are coming outta his fingers
---
And he deserved it
---
This is the kind of video I like
---
You sir have hit the nail on the head. ‚ÄúJust do totems‚Äù. And I‚Äôm a killer main
---
I usually let survivors farm, but I understand the opposite mentality. Some killers find letting one or two survivors farm and do 5 gens boring AF, so they try and get to the next game ASAP.
---
LMAO it wasn‚Äôt, i actually hadn‚Äôt seen that before but that‚Äôs hilarious
---
What an idiot. Not just for teabagging but also just not assuming Laurie has DS lol.
---
I had the volume off but I'm guessing it's the "this is how you eat a big mac"
---
It definitely isn‚Äôt op don‚Äôt tunnel or just slug once they get off the hook
---
This happens all the time when I play billy and someone can't loop me
---
Yes it is they literally just got off the hook and youre hitting them back down again. Good killers are able to go for the healthy one and get the other one later.
---
If i was "Crying" about how strong spirit is, i would be complaining about nurse since she is better. You ignored everything i said bc you knew i am right and i proved you wrong.
---
Do tell me, what are the counters to spirit without mentioning perks or scratch marks?
---
I actually rank down when I play with my best friend. We'll be in a game and he'll be hooked and I'll be working on a gen across the map and he'll say "nobody is coming for me" and I'll hop off of a gen to run and get him down and usually get hit in the process. Its stupid but he's my boy and I know that feeling of being hung out to dry.
---
[Ghostface afterwards](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fbw4agFHBlY)
---
It was for me and all I did was watch lol.
---
Can't believe I'm still thinking about this meme 11 days later
---
Do the same for keys and I'm game
---
Only if Survivors get something adjusted too for compensation
---
For every time the killerbgeta hit by DS in a game 1 second should be removed from the stun. Makes everyone having it much less oppressive. Shouls probably also deactivate on hooking another survivor.
---
Oh haha entitled survivors so funny haha original and funny and never seen before haha
---
It‚Äôs apart of the game and has been forever there‚Äôs no point changing it.
---
Well like I said, I am doing really good with not DCing. Went from 3 DCs a day to like 4 in the last month
---
I'd rather there be a balance between the old and new gameplay styles. Him being invisible outside the dream world is the biggest detail I want back.
---
Why can't we all have what we want?
---
Awww
---
Dude that is genius
---
You can literally go after the healthy survivor, down them, hook them,  find the unhooked dude, down them and still get DSed. 
---
"Just don¬¥t tunnel" lmao, that¬¥s like "Just do totems". But looking at your comments, I wouldn¬¥t expect anything less from a salty biased dude who just craps on killers with every comment he can.
---
Tunneling isn't unfair.
---
I do get she's like nowhere near top tier or whatever, but you guys are blowing things out of proportion. Thing is, her last nerf was like a quarter year ago, and she's not even the worst of all killers. You guys are pretending like she's the worst killer by a longshot and bHVR keeps nerfing her like nobody's business. Btw, watch Ohtofu or Otz or whichever pro play her at rank 1. They still get kills.
---
that noir filter ties it all together for me. great outfit for a great cosplay
---
Well then you've gotten plenty of 4Ks. A 3K won't kill you
---
Yeah. Sorry to sound like an unhinged lunatic, but I'm really fucking tired of these guys. Everywhere, whether it's Steam Discussions or this sub, it's just "oh this or that is toxic, nerf it! But don't touch all my countless ebony addons, moris or inbuilt instant down moves that counter everything in the first place! I wanna keep those regardless of what you nerf!"
---
2016 was bad for killers, but now it's never been easier.
---
I'm not a killer main, but I've reached rank 1 several times. These killers who say the game is impossible are probably getting 4k in 9 out of 10 games. But then one survivor escapes in the 10th game and it's "waaaah survivors OP, I didn't get my 4k!" Either that or they chase one survivor who's good at looping and wonder why they got gen rushed, blaming survivors rather than their own poor performance. And finally, the myth about SWF being unbeatable. Most SWF are altruistic to the point of idiocy. Hook one and they will all abandon what they're doing to come rescue.
---
Any killer who complains about killer being hard is either annoyed they can't get easy 4k's every time, or bad at the game.
---
I miss old Freddy alot (IMHO he was better than Wraith, new legion, and Leatherface.) and he had best-in-class stealth, tracking, and stall.
---
His chase was pretty bad but a good Freddy player would constantly disengage and reengage targets sleep-juggling and ambushing while dragging out the game. A good Freddy would simply sleep you and move on for someone else if he was being looped, meaning he could waste survivors time more than his own considering the sleeping survivor now has to find a way to wake up, and Freddy's tracking allowed him to ambush in dead zones.
---
OG Freddy had a very weird playstyle of hit and run and constantly juggling targets and trying to keep everyone asleep. If you got good at it, used a good build, etc. he was mid-tier and was somewhat effective even at high ranks. (Although this was partially because of cocky survivors remaining on a gen thinking they have more time allowing a free grab, or maybe even because of nobody playing Freddy often since he's supposedly weak, resulting in survivors having brain farts once they go up against a Freddy. Sure you can loop a Billy, but a Freddy simply will ping-pong between survivors and will drop the chase to re-engage later if he feels like you're wasting his time. A tiny TR and the dream world fog meant you can easily ambush and cut people off.)
---
I like the rework a ton but I also miss the old one.
---
I won‚Äôt pretend this was well done or anything, none of us being particular time-rich or experienced cosplayers, but we had fun with it
---
No one ever makes post for the 7% of killers who stand by the hook till second phase. Or the other 50% who walk like 3 feet from the hook the immediately turns back to it over and over. Or the 42% that's striaght facecamp you it's always the 1% that make this post.
---
Survivors aren't getting bullied if they completed 5 gens to be rewarded with a speed boost and health state. Master of memes, novice at logic.
---
I can think of about 12-13 other killers that could use rework more then him now if one at all, so meh
---
Thanks for the tutorial; It worked wonders!
---
Ok
---
Pyramid head, from silent hill
---
Well i mean if nobody has done totems and a survivor is on a hook with endgame collapse. It kinda sucks when you try to save and you just get one shot by noed.
---
Haha! I‚Äôm pretty antisocial by nature, so talking to random people in an online game is something I‚Äôve almost always avoided.
---
Well they certainly aren't going away and are just growing in numbers so we will keep laughing at the clowns if they keep showing up
---
He has so much map pressure now. Plus the snares give anti-loop. Before he was an m1 killer who had to **wait** to hit you. He went from the worst to being top 5.
---
Oof my nephew can make better comebacks and he‚Äôs 3
---
You can take keys for the removal of moris. But also you say that but BNPs, Insta meds, DS, BT, InstaBlinds ect where removed when killers didnt really get any of there annoying mechanics removed
---
Ebony moris are garbage and are insta win offerings, remove them please
---
Noweave left behind

Slug then. Are you really that butthurt that you're unable to steamroll and get an ez 4k in under 60 seconds? Maybe you can suggest BHVR make survivors spawn on the hook, they'll probably listen to you and implement it knowing their track record.
---
I had a similar glorious victory against a teabagging ghostface recently. All three remaining survivors ended up escaping after he‚Äôd been BM‚Äôing all game. He knew he‚Äôd lost at the end so he didn‚Äôt give me the satisfaction of showing him my ass at the gate but it still felt right.
---
Do you not understand how balance works
---
In 60 seconds I can hook the rescuer and go back to the unhooked survivor and pick them up
---
My boy couldn‚Äôt even edit the meme feels bad
---
People like watching karma
---
The best killer!
---
What did I just say? Did you not even read my reply?
---
Aye good job im chilling on rank 14 right now
---
you buy legion for discordance and that's it
---
You make it actually 2 minutes before your ruin is gone? Impressive. Usually they just spawn on top of mine. And Pop is a pretty dang essential perk for slowing generator progress, if used correctly. Watch fungoose or Otzdarva, they may be able to help you.
---
This also applies to some survivors with many hours played. They will be poking out and clearly visible while trying to hide behind something and claim hacks when you go hit them.
---
I used to be 90k/10s but now I‚Äôm 50/50 please change it BHVR
---
&gt;Slug then.
---
Sure, I can. And then I will have whiny babies like you complain about killers slugging.
---
&gt;Are you really that butthurt that you're unable to steamroll and get an ez 4k in under 60 seconds?
---
Butthurt? The only butthurt person here is you my dude, just look at your comments. But if the injured survivor is *so bad* that he cannot get away even while you down and hook another guy, then he deserves to get hooked again.
---
&gt;Maybe you can suggest BHVR make survivors spawn on the hook
---
You got any more of those exaggerations instead of arguments?
---
I chuckled at this
---
Survivors have had the power role, so they got more nerfs.
---
Dummy I said *killers* not just spirit. Again, stop crying about the killers and get better .  And learn how to loop and use pallets to your advantage.
---
Yes and so do the devs if they saw it was bad for the game it would‚Äôve been changed by now because they will have the stats on what percent of killers run it and stats to see if it improves their general kill count and it most likely has a small difference so they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth changing something so simple. You could just play smart and not get hit three plus times though.
---
Im sorry but that guy looks like bald shane dawson
---
I would buy this
---
I thought noob3 died
---
A scratched mirror Michael and and an impossible skill checks doctor on the game 
---
No matter how many survivors you just quit then
---
If he was less whiny and bitter to his own subs he would get it less
---
He couldn‚Äôt handle being flashed by Adam
---
It‚Äôs just you
---
Stolen from r/rocketleague
---
*cough cough spirit and legion*
---
Yes it is wtf are you on xD
---
Instaheals too
---
I have a feeling you haven‚Äôt been playing very long
---
1) I had him on me the entire match 
---
2) He barely downed me after all 5 gens were done
---
3) He was tbagging like he was good
---
People shit on console players all the time but red rank survivors on pc are nothing special, and is some of the most boring gameplay I‚Äôve ever seen. Keep your negative comments to yourself bb, people like seeing trash killers get what they deserve.
---
When this happens, the killer is usually tunnelling my baby friend off the hook, but I have to resort to "toxic" methods (like body blocking in tight spaces so the killer can't get past), then I get tunnelled, facecamped, stabbed repeatedly while I'm still on the hook, and die.
---
Well, it‚Äôs not just the entity that‚Äôs displeased
---
Clearly, you didn't read.
---
You mean you hit them down first or not?
---
Unreal.  It's not like Halloween is a brand new event that's only been around for a few years.  BHVR has had literally ALL YEAR to plan an event and they can't even seem to accomplish that.
---
Can't say I'm really all that surprised though.  It IS BHVR we're talking about.
---
LMFAOOOOOOO!!!
---
Are you high? Whilst I disagree with the original statement, with the exception of Nurse in general and seriously OP add ins such a Huntress with iridescent heads or Spirit with the amulet, DBD is entirely survivor favoured. I‚Äôm not complaining, as overall I feel the game is decently balanced until you hit true red ranks, but your statement is utterly false. Either you‚Äôre an arrogant survivor main or you haven‚Äôt truly experienced high rank play.
---
This version was the license they could get.
---
Survivor: Hook Save
---
Killer Main: SWF is ruining this game.
---
Always the basic outfit. This about as impressive as a legion cosplay
---
he did this is partially a memorial to him, RIP and F
---
Well when they all join the lobby at the same time then all have bloody party streamers, bring brand new parts and instaheals, all have adrenaline, ds, and unbreakable, and are very coordinated to the point where they could only be that way if they had audio/telepathic communication, its likely theyre swf
---
most players are xbox due to easy game pass access also it was apparently free on psn like a year ago or some shit
---
As a killer main, I‚Äôm fine with DS in its current state. But I wish survivors would stop whining about me slugging to counter it
---
It may sound dumb but I think it‚Äôs his best build lol
---
Most Iridescent tier stuff is anti competitive, Ran into a Iridescent head with +2 hatchet huntress is just annoying and whatever allows the hag to teleport to any hex on the map is poorly thought out in terms of a "Competitive experience" which the game lacks 8/10 matches
---
Proper use of T-bag üëçüëçüëå
---
Yeah I feel corrupt is a good alternative
---
I can understand that.
---
I was EXTREMELY introverted until... Roughly 3 years ago.
---
Now interacting with people doesn't scare me, but it does annoy me.
---
Cept messaging online. That's ok
---
There are instances where the killer doesn‚Äôt tunnel but is still hit by DS.
---
Like when
---
Don't disagree with you there. I'm merely critiquing his new gameplay vs the character lore  and what made himself so interesting.
---
Isn't that how every legion mask that gets posted here is made?
---
The killer was a rank 17...
---
Yes it is favoured now. It wasn‚Äôt always like this. And I beg to differ. I experience high ranks at their finest. Op add ons begin in the purple ranks as well,  not only red ranks. We got a good noed counter with Nancy‚Äôs perks, but saying it‚Äôs not killer favoured it‚Äôs a lie. Playing solo survivor sucks if you‚Äôre in high ranks where everyone plays spirit and nurse with the best add ons. 
---
Imagine calling someone an arrogant survivor main just because you disagree with their opinion. Good community.
---
Another thread downvoted into oblivion by the killer mains.
---
So this has to be a troll right? When I heard that damn lullaby before I wanted to cry he was so unfun to play as and against and you're not happy?
---
I do not. I let them get away and go deal with other survivors
---
I think no mither is literally a direct upgrade from unbreakable in this idea lol
---
Lmfao
---
Marble is a literal brick wall and doesn‚Äôt understand that more broken shit equals more nerfs
---
Oh thats okay then
---
Assume all you want, but I see more prayer beads than any Mori for any killer.
---
Bill finally snapped
---
Now this is the content i subscribed for
---
I and several people I know absolutely will let the killer down us at the end of the gate sometimes. We‚Äôre already guaranteed to get out if we‚Äôre right before the escape line, who cares if the killer gets a few extra points? It‚Äôs nice.
---
but it takes longer to recover
---
You gotta keep up with the times.  Instaheals are getting reworked next patch.
---
Ah- yes  
---
**The boy**
---
rip
---
why not just watch the clip though? I do not really care for them as well so I ignore it not like it effects me
---
OK, but why is it unfair? Is it somehow exploiting? Is it against the game mechanics? 
---
I often see people saying how survivors have "nothing to do outside doing gens" and "gen rushing isn¬¥t a thing" "it is literally the objective of the game" and so on.
---
The role of the killer is to kill the survivors. How is tunneling unfair then? You could say it¬¥s simply securing a kill. 
---
Now yeah I personally don¬¥t tunnel because I find it boring, but from a game design standpoint it¬¥s basically fair game. Because IF tunneling is unfair then we need to classify a whole lot of other stuff like gen rushing as unfair too.
---
Looping is a legitimate tactic to waste the killers time. If I can‚Äôt catch somebody, I leave and go find a gen to smash. I don‚Äôt like hearing killers complain about looping when so many of them camp/tunnel/act super toxic the whole game and ruin it for everybody.
---
You have to use a external device to get it to work, but don‚Äôt be scum and use m&amp;k on console
---
Yeah but why would you pay for them when you can earn them for free?
---
LEGIT FUCKING CACKLED ü§£üëèüèª
---
Lol wdum external device and I‚Äôm only using it in kyf ü§£
---
Instaheals are actually beatable at high rank though. Its annoying yes but not game ending, the mori literally ends the game for one player.
---
Spacebar struggle will break if you PTT in Discord (regardless if spacebar is mapped in disco or not) . Remapping to something else will fix.
---
So ... did the match start?
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt understand. Just don‚Äôt watch them if you hate seeing it so much
---
On the other hand, DS
---
Read my comment
---
I dont think anyone cares about the D strike at all.  The title itself says what people are interested in. Nothing about D Strike.
---
But... the game has literally NEVER been killer sided...? The devs themselves have addressed this numerous times... The current state is the most balanced it has ever been, and that‚Äôs just fact - and I like it as such. You can ask literally anybody who‚Äôs played since release and they‚Äôll agree 99% of the time.
---
Bro, I‚Äôm not trying to be an asshole. Yes, you‚Äôre entitled to your opinion, I‚Äôm just pointing out facts and trying to make reasonable assumptions as to why you think what you think. 
---
You do just agreed with my points as well. I said that asides from Nurse and killers with OP add ons such as Spirit with amulet and Huntress with iridescent heads, the game is most definitely NOT killer sided.
---
But, yeah go ahead, take offence to me just pointing out facts. Snowflake community..!
---
Instaheals are gone in the next patch. The Styptic Agent now applies Endurance to the target for 15 seconds, and the Anti-haemorrhagic Syringe now heals the target automatically over 8 seconds.
---
100% take away the red key, red hatchets and red moris.
---
The hag teleport is okay because its not game ending but should still be re-balanced somehow.
---
Complaining about BBQ lmao... a perk that persuades killers to not camp, gives them more bloodpoints and has many ways to counter it. Especially when you have a perk that makes you able to ignore it 3 times... Just sad.
---
Hate ben shapiro, but this is a good meme
---
Remember when  exhaustion replenished while you ran and literally everyone ran Sprint burst and Vigil?
---
cringe
---
pretty GoOd jOb sO fAr
---
Okay so you're 3 hours ahead.
---
One time I saved my friend. He was at one of the hooks that were really close to the exit. I was injured but I gave him borrowed time. I timed it perfectly so that I wouldn't be hit because the killer walked away, but when I unhooked my friend he bolted to the exit in front of me instead of taking the hit. I got hit and downed, died on hook. He escaped. He barely said thanks and I died on the inside knowing we easily both would have made it lol.
---
I wouldt call them "salty killer mains" bc it makes it sound like we live in 2017, the people claiming DS is op also say that spirit is balanced, dont expect intelligence
---
You are not my friend. You are my brother, my friend!
---
The only thing to know is a killer won't drop the survivor if they are in the middle of the pickup animation. They technically have to be able to move before you can blind them to free the survivor. 
---
Then going to what the others said, you'll need to learn the timing of when this moment starts to do it before a killer can attempt to look  away.
---
oh right... i guess the patch is taking too long i nearly forgot about it
---
LMAO TRUE 
---
fuck spirit.
---
????
---
killers are not OP most of the time
---
Justifying tunneling is always interesting to see. Imagine if their was a way to  stop killers from playing the game. Sounds fun.
---
Yeah I agree thats not even tunnelling they need to change that so it cant activate if youve hooked someone before them
---
Hilarious. They are assholes because they are doing the one thing that guarantees their survival for more than five seconds? What should they be doing, give up and let you catch them? The entitlement is unreal.
---
Don't get mad at players for wanting to do well. Get mad at the game designers for making this the only way survivors can actually survive.
---
:)
---
Yup.
---
You think Myers, Ghostface and, Christ above, BUBBA (of all killers) are good simply because of insta downs? If this really is your opinion, then I‚Äôm sorry my dude but you really haven‚Äôt experienced true high level play.
---
Yes, playing solo can be frustrating, and SWF groups definitely have an infinitely better chance of easily winning, however the majority of maps can easily be run by a single skilled survivor for at least 3 gens. If it takes that long for a Myers/Bubba etc to down a single person, then yes - the game is survivor sided.
---
You do you, your opinions are yours and that‚Äôs totally cool - I‚Äôm just stating facts, facts I know to be true as I have done so numerous times myself and I still wouldn‚Äôt class myself as a top survivor - nowhere near.
---
(Also dedicated servers are already a thing, unless you‚Äôre on console then I dunno - so yeah, there you go)
---
Im so confused I used to be able to do it well but I guess my timing is wrong now
---
It won't happen. Look at how killer mains bombed your thread into oblivion. The mentality is they can get survivor items nerfed, but don't you dare touch any of their overpowered stuff that countered survivors in the first place.
---
Also, someone disagrees with you so much they downvoted everyone of ur comments
---
I hate running these as both killer and survivor bc as killer it‚Äôs obvious u cant do anything all u can do is hold down foward until u catch up or a window gets blocked it has no counter play and as survivor it feels cheap and has no skill involved. They really need to fix these loops imo. Best advice as killer i can give is drop chase try to find someone else but it does suck u have to drop a whole chase just bc u cant do anything abt a loop :/.
---
The killer‚Äôs goal is literally to kill. There‚Äôs no rules
---
Lol get fucked he 100% uninstalled
---
I‚Äôve got some for the killers, what is the bug they cause? Before I use them
---
Lol, look at the last sentence of your first comment, don‚Äôt expect intelligence, we‚Äôre dealing with some pretty dumb people here my friend xD
---
I think my comment was pretty reasonable and no one has rebutted it. 
---
You talk about mental gymnastics but didn't you just the hasty generalization fallacy?
---
Dwight leave the locker 
---
I need your help on the hook
---
Please get me down Dwight
---
That would be awesome
---
Yes but in the end its a game. For me at least i find no pleasure in ruining someones elses fun and game. The rules are just honor and good manners really. Just basic empathy. I dont like being tunneled, so i dont tunnel, Treat others like you want to be treated.
---
Depending on how long it's been, the pickup animation has been sped up maybe a year ago
---
üòÇ
---
It doesnt make you play as the killer for that match. Instead after the match you'll have the killer selected as if you own them and can spend blood points, change perks, and play as them. But after you deselect them they are no longer available until you use another splinter.
---
It‚Äôs almost like killer should be the power role
---
They need to remove some of the hooks while they're at it. The fucks.
---
Umm 'survivors' are trying to SURVIVE so running meta perks is justified???
---
He was being blinded multiple times. You can tell because he power UI goes away randomly and comes back. 
---
Spirit, Nurse, and Wraith suffer from this when the survivor knows because not many others do.
---
Yes I do play on console, so those are not a thing *yet*. 
---
Oh I know bubba is awful, but the fact that they can insta down is a big downside, a frustrating one I‚Äôd say. Especially now, with the insta heal rework in play. I‚Äôm not gonna say I‚Äôm the best survivor out there, I‚Äôm just saying that to me, it definitely looks like it‚Äôs killer sided. Better perks and add ons are what makes me think that. 
---
You won‚Äôt see much variety in high ranks. It‚Äôs gonna be either a spirit, nurse, huntress or tombstone myers. (Not many nurses on consoles, but a lot of spirits).
---
I‚Äôm gonna end this discussion cause I wanna go to sleep. Have a nice one and good luck!
---
Yep
---
Killer for me is always less than a minute unless I go past 11pm. Survivor is always 3+ minutes no matter what
---
Why are you bringing your 3 year old nephew into this weirdo
---
This should be way higher
---
Watch one of the more recent OhTofu videos. He gives some good tips.
---
Pyramid head from silent hill if I remember correctly
---
Double plot twist: The exposed status isn't because of NOED, but because of Rancor.
---
smh fukin immersed rank 20s
---
I believe he's referring to some of the more infinite loops you can create, with the likes of Balanced Landing for example, which are absolutely broken and should not exist.
---
stabby manlet lookin good
---
Bro it‚Äôs infinite tier 3 meyers with sloppy butcher you know how long that‚Äôs gonna take to heal? And dying light? Bro... lmao
---
I'm really glad you like it and if you wouldnt mind could you check out my other concepts "The Photographer" " The Sacrafice" And "The Marionette" &lt;---- She's my newest one so I do need opinions also check out my "Photographer's Add-on List" I'm taking these comments and applying them to my newer concepts so yours is really helpful
---
I had a game yesterday as a spirit. I'm fairly new to spirit and killers in general, so I wanted to try out the prayer bead combo (1st time using it). 5 gens, 3 dc, 1 escape hatch. Then the dcs trashtalked like it's my fault prayer bead existed in the game. "reported lol enjoy 10 years ban" their exact words. I was so confused I just give them a smiley face and left
---
It can be done. I‚Äôve posted some stuff on YouTube of 4Ks at red ranks. You better be ready for some stress and a little luck, but can be a fun killer. 
---
Discordance on Freddy though, that‚Äôs my bae
---
i like the idea. Not getting to begin another game until the game you just ruined is over.
---
Also a AFK Survivor hitting dummy still wastes more time / grants more bloodpoints than when you suddenly go whoos
---
Also, easier to shove that chainsaw with stacks of play with your food. Strong perk on bubba.
---
Look quick and see Lauri blasting the head off Leatherface with a gun, at the hatch. Brilliant. DS buffed.
---
As a new killer, I never noticed a swf in my games until the end chat where they trashtalked me to Oblivion in unison
---
As a Killer main, they are the worst scum and deserve a hook themselves.
---
How to make graphic so low?
---
he will now DC on your username, too
---
I love how someone always makes a comment like this when a killer gets his comeuppance. Killers have to have some kind of traumatic past experience to behave this way instead of just being a toxic piece of shit.
---
No
---
Lmao survivors always under suspicion but if the roles were reversed there'd be no questions asked smh
---
[NEARLEH ECHOES IN THE DISTANCE]
---
Someone DCed in a match I played this morning just because ghostface popped a corner and hit them.
---
I mean it was an auto loss to rng. The only way he had a chance to win was if she missed it.
---
I'm guessing English isn't their first language.
---
Yea they should have the power role. not the OVERpowered role. do you just think survivors play the game and dont care if killers are super op? you have to keep both sides happy
---
Its because camping is camping. Proxy camping or face camping, both are still camping
---
Jesus talk about outplayed
---
Yeah but oh well
---
Dude you‚Äôre having a conversation that none of us were having. If you can find the exact sentence where I said to never kill any survivors, then put it in your reply and I will admit I‚Äôm a shitty survivor and killer. Otherwise, if a killer has been on you since the start of a game, won‚Äôt leave you even when other survivors try to bait them, went after you after both unhooks, even after you ran them for a while through no fault of your own and you have no chance of surviving, then yeah, fuck them, DC. That‚Äôs legit what it‚Äôs been about, not the bullshit people make up in their head about what they think I typed. If they‚Äôre that desperate for a kill, fuck them. Nothing about incompetent survivors or whatever like you said or you being a dick? That‚Äôs it.
---
Okay, thanks. Is it normal that there isn¬¥t a, lets call it, reminder there, like 
---
\[ENTER\] pick up survivor
---
because i have never seen that before.
---
Very high quality must took like 100 hours!
---
Ah okay haha I was just determined that it was from Cursed, loved that movie.
---
why are these always the teammates I get...and then as soon as the killer chases me suddenly there are zero pallets left on the entire map
---
He was literally chasing you. In this clip
---
It's like people don't understand how reporting works lol
---
Did you need to upload the entire half hour match?
---
"Braindamaged" isn't a word. What caused your brain damage?
---
Hello? I sent you a friend request
---
thank you PneguinFyre, very cool!
---
This is what a bunch of my friends are doing too lol!
---
I've noticed the long times for killer..good to know survivor queues aren't as long. Thanks!
---
I would argue that a little, even when I *don't* think NOED is unfair. A killer's performance hinges entirely on their own merits, while a Survivor is dependent on their team. There's a lot you can do as an individual survivor, but if you have three completely braindead teammates there is *nothing* you can do to save them from their own bad choices, and once they die soloing the killer is virtually impossible.
---
The hatch is a tool like everything else; for a survivor that was unable to save their team, but was smart enough themselves alive, it's a final chance to get away from the killer (which can now be countered by the killer) so they aren't guaranteed to die just because their team was bad. For an immersed Claudette, it's an excuse to to jack shit and just wait out the hatch for a free escape. It depends on the player and the team.
---
KEYS on the other hand, *are* bullshit, and would be completely broken if they weren't an item that was rarely used. For *the* *click of a button* and the ability to rally your team, you can turn what *should* be 2-3 kills into 0, and no item should be that goddamn powerful as to become an instant win. But that's an issue with the item, not the hatch.
---
Yeah your answer is so smart, Einstein is shaking in his grave üò©üò≠üò≠ please excuse my inferior intelligence üôáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I'm sorry. I'm pretty new - have only played survivor and even then, I've been focusing on a single character. What's Ruin?
---
I just got it last week on the shrine, is legion just not worth it for anything else, even as a killer main?
---
Boy you just keep on delivering. Your entire post history is a goldmine. Fire all BHVR employees KEKW
---
Didn't someone post this exact same picture earlier today, but without the glove on the hand?
---
Yeah same
---
How are any of those broken?
---
just like they gave us dedicated servers, amirite
---

---
Well usually a killer can hit the unhooked before I can rank a hit for my savior. In my experience anyway.
---
I have the exact same joystick skin
---
For survivor it‚Äôs ridiculously fast but for killer, man it gives me enough time to question reality
---
Remove collision and anal beads, and stridor shouldn‚Äôt make iron will useless. 50% of 0 is still 0 devs...
---
Ahh i see, stolen from r/rocketleague , nice
---
I figured out the big boy strat was to use Myers to grind bloodpoints and then with the levels gained save up for Kate
---
Looks like you had a blast, good stuff dude!
---
real talk when are they gonna finally give benefits for getting to purple and red ranks tbh...if I have to verse an anal beads spirit or instasaw billy every other game I should at least get some extra fucking points for it
---
whats wrong with vaults?
---
&gt;we'll make it lol
---
Push to talk, I assume.
---
haha aww, yeh this was the like only friendly killer i encountered for like at least 50 games :O
---
I wish there was a way to tell if you DC'd because your internet cut out, or if you DC'd because you're salty about getting hooked at the beginning of the match after you failed to loop the killer like you thought you would. That way we could reasonably punish intentional DC's with like, wait times on re-queuing, and such. 
---
Most Competitive games make me miss how the community for R6 Siege is split. You've got Casual players, who play just for fun and they can rage quit without really affecting anyone since new players can just join in, and Ranked players, who care about getting good at the game (mostly) and train, and test strats, and shit, just in an effort to be a better player. I know this format doesn't translate to DBD extremely well, but I do wish we had a similar way to split the community so those rage quitters can play in their own damn mode while those of us who actually want to stick a match out like a trooper can all reliably get matched up together.
---
dis sum gud shiet
---
Honestly, too many people in general (until you get into higher ranks) don‚Äôt even try to power trough ruin, they spend way too much time looking for it.
---
Konami basically whores their franchises out to whoever will give them money at this point since they know they're sitting on popular IPs that they're too lazy to spend their own resources on (unless it's a pachinko/mobile game that rakes in $$$), so it's definitely not outside the realm of impossibility right now.
---
Sorta yeah, if you see someone else doing a gen and it smokes up but there isn't a loud bang then ruin is active. Also the skill check circle will be red and you will get a little icon on screen after it happens to you.
---
oh yeah maybe like an aura ability or something that can distort time cause skinwalker victims will sometime go for miles and it only feels like a minute or 2
---
You are not a clown. You are the entire circus.
---
it's an underrated perk
---
you have to deal with latency now. survivors have been dealing with it forever. I‚Äôm p sure it just comes down to who has better internet now
---
Might be where you live but in NA:South East, queues are quick for both sides. Even on the unpopulated times, maybe 5 minutes at the max?
---
u/HavelBro_Logan didnt mention meta perks though genius they said tbagging and harassment which is straight up toxic, pointless and not justified.
---
Oddly, that's a good thing lol.
---
I want to see endgame chat please

This guy knows whats up.

yup.. i understand, it's a hit and miss for me.

eitherway, when i don't like the pass. i'll just skip it and enjoy the additional free content.

let the other pay to support it. i'll just sit here and enjoy the free things. lol.

as long as they don't p2w it, i'm cool with whatever premium service they release
---
Your on thin ice
---
Wow this meme AGAIN
---
You are textbook right now out of the biased playbook.  Again I play respectfully af and still have killers who play me scummy as all hell just to do it with hard bm.  Some players are just dicks man.  Noone makes people like that they are who they are.  And anyone that uses that as an excuse to exact a "revenge" on their next lobby of 4 strangers who haven't set foot in their lobby before is full of shit and just looking for an excuse to be toxic.  Stop pretending killers are victims 100% and survivors are the only ones capable of unsolicited BM.  It goes both ways dude.
---
a lot of hatred of not leaving is just left over hatred from before EDC my mate, some time soon the "just leave" thing will only be for idiot tbaggers getting hooked before escaping.
---
casual killers be like
---
I run Enduring, (Hillbilly perk) Spirit Fury (Spirit Perk) for dealing with pallets, and BBQ (Leatherface perk) and Pop Goes The Weasel (Clown perk) for slowing the game down.
---
Hook survivor, see which generator is being worked on with BBQ, teleport to it to scare the survivor off, and kick it with Pop.
---
Pop is on the shrine right now btw. Get it. It's very good on Freddy.
---
when I get into a lobby with shit ranks I always go find ruin bc I know those fuckin potatoes are gonna be too scared to touch a generator with ruin for the whole match
---
Lol fuck you kid ur a t-bagging insta healer now imma delete my comments cuz u shitters outnumber me 4/1 and u guys love ur fucking downvotes
---
Bloodpoints =/= Emblem
---
If you got chased for a majority of the match then you can expect to max Boldness while the other categories are still probably empty because you weren't touching a gen for Objective or healing/unhooking for Altruism.
---
You do get a portion of points in Lightbringer for others repairing gens while being chased because of situations like this where you had no opportunity to touch a gen yourself.
---
Unbroken will always give a Silver if you existed in a match long enough.
---
Benevolent has a starting value which is Bronze
---
Evader is probably Gold/Iridescent because of the Killer chasing you for a stupid amount of time.
---
I was the nea btw. that billy was literally camping that hook, and when me and the other feng tried to help her, like he legit heavy tunneled that poor meg. So we gave up. Maybe if you watch the full clip tho, just maybe...
---
When it comes to DC's, letting the others get a handicap at the very least is the *right* thing to do, however, killing them isnt the *wrong* thing to do, its a decision made by the killer to play the game normal or not after DC's but they arent held accountable for the decision because the decision was forced on them.
---
It doesn't trigger if you pick them up after the 60 seconds soooo
---
Forgot the GG
---
So fucking annoying. Bitch ass SWF try to bully cuz they think they‚Äôre gods. Get wrecked at basement and rage quit penalizing your game for doing so well. Devs really need to implement dc punishments like MOST multiplayer games. Christ
---
Yeah, there's no reason to do anything but the bare minimum as it is. Not sure why I get cruxified for saying it, but I hope Project Resistance lights a fire under BHVR's ass.
---
...I can't tell if you got the joke or not.
---
To start with, I don't think that old Freddy needed a complete overhaul of his kit. A buff? Hell yes. A complete scrapping of his kit? Hell no. All he needed were some tweaks of how some mechanics related to him worked, some survivor perk nerfs, and maybe a chase mechanic or two added to him, and he'd have been fine. There was a good killer there, the devs just didn't want to take the time to dig him out. 
---
With that being said, I like the new Freddy. His teleport game is strong if played right and with the right perks. I'm still learning his snares but I seem to be having trouble with them. Still, I miss the "ping pong" effect old Freddy had and that new Freddy kind of lacks, where if I saw one survivor doing something I didn't want them to be doing, I could just drop the chase/whatever else I was doing and go to them. I can't do that anymore with new Freddy, unless it's with gens specifically.
---
how'd you do it in 20 mins?
---
It‚Äôs rated just fine; most times you won‚Äôt even have enough time to heal because the killer will come back or you could just use a med kit instead of wasting a perk slot

if we add each other can you show me where to get dbd skins and rooms in vr chat my guy? im new to vr chat and dunno how to get anywhere and my fuckin skin is still a hot dog
---
It was an exaggeration to make a point. I can last just fine without infinites. Don't resort to ad hominem just because you disagree.
---
ghostface has BUSTed another survivor doing gens.
---
I like to pretend I don't see the survivor and then as I'm about to walk past I stand still then slowly turn around to where they're hiding  and nod
---
I know it‚Äôs sideways I can‚Äôt change it
---
Just fyi, its not an infinite if the entity blocks the window and the killer can down with bloodlust. For example, an infinite means that the survivor can use the loop forever and cannot be downed. This also includes a survivor being able to vault the window an infinite amount of times and the killer can't catchup with Bloodlust tier 3.
---
Ahoy captain!
---
I'll have to rewatch the full clip that you posted in the comments but from my perspective didn't seem like he was camping/tunneling. Since no gens were being done and you were all in Meg's vicinity he had no reason to leave the general area.
---
You're not, lol
---
Can you elaborate?
---
now this is badass way to legion cosplay
---
There‚Äôs one on backwater swap with the house. McMillan estate has multiple. Farm map with cowshed. Farm map with long loop into killshack, that sometimes also spawns jungle gym. Red forest mothers dwelling if you get the good window.
---
SoUnDs lIkE YoU LiKe tO TuNnEl.
---
Free perks? You can try whispers, noed, blood warden, spies from the shadows.
---
I use BBQ+C, Discordance, Surveillance, and PGTW.
---
Most of the killers are low rank but also if you play console you‚Äôd understand cuz a survivor doing a correct 360 on console completely FUCKS your frame rate. Sometimes you can‚Äôt see shit especially in some areas like cornfields
---
Welp he got clowned hard
---
The big problem with these loops is that there is no mind game. The best killer in the world would have trouble dealing with these loops since the only thing they can do is either break the chase or follow until the eventually catch up. It's not skill in looping, its just a lot of free distance for the survivor.
---
Not a bad idea, too.
---
I just bought all the DLC when it was all on sale
---
Think the next Steam sales is on the Fall update
---
You should kys 
---
Mouse and keyboard on console is bullshit
---
Dark sense 8s a good perk
---
‚ÄúIf they devs saw it was bad for the game it would‚Äôve been changed by now‚Äù
---
My man do you know about hatch standoffs? And how long it took to change it? Do you know anything about these devs?
---
Wait, thats a thing? Bruh, Im lowkey tempted to do that to teabaggers.
---
Df's?
---
Why do they? I play cuz it's fun.

Yknow hoppers supposed to be dead, right
---
That‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt add him as a survivor
---
Also a fredward main. I think a lot of people just don‚Äôt bother with him since he used to be objectively fucking awful, so they overlook how good he is now
---
One of my games today we stacked 4 bps with randoms and someone dc'd in loading screen. =(

---
Nope, everyone gets the hook.
---
I just came back to this game not too long ago. How is he better now?
---
Is it weird that I liked him before AND after the rework?
---
100% agreed.
---
He got a complete rework for his power, he‚Äôs basically a whole new Killer now
---
I tried the beta and it was F13 formula, right? You can't CHOOSE to be the Neighbour?
---
As hard as I am on DbD, they did that part right. Let me decide who I'm playing when I start. Imagine the DC rate if you couldn't.
---
There is a dif between stronger, and 2 strong. Billy is a good example of the perfect killer, he is fun to play as and against, easy to pick up but hard to master, and has a super high skill cap. 
---
Spirit is hard to play against. billy is a challenge, whats the difference between hard and a challenge? a challenge is a fun hill to climb where both killer and survivor feels like they have a fair chance, Most of the time, the better player will win.
---
With spirit though, you dont have to be a good player to 4k against a good team, she has no counter play and is so easy to play.
---
I'd say that STBFL and brutal strength would be better replacements for enduring/spirit fury assuming you're a snare freddy, since with the blood pools, survivors are more inclined to drop pallets early, which pretty much negates the whole usage of the enduring/spirit fury combo. This is why a lot of people run brutal strength on clown instead of enduring. On fake pallet freddy enduring and spirit fury would be the better choice, obviously.
---
Damn, thats a good point I didn't think of. Kudos!
---
what'd you make the masks with?
---
Df?
---
Then almost infinites. You know how bad that window is bro
---
You are wrong not matter what you say.
---
I agree it doesn't feel good to go down to it, in fact it's really annoying. I've never used NOED when I play killer either. I just think the perk merely existing in the game is a good thing because it gives a bit more "what ifs" and fear to the end game and encourages people to not just sit on gens and find totems. To be fair I haven't gone down to NOED in a very very long time since I get every totem I see and run inner strength. I think that's why I also find it somewhat fair because it's fully preventable. Same with adrenaline, it's a reward for finishing objectives. Annoying as hell when I'm playing killer and someone zooms off with it but I think it's a fine perk.
---
they effed him. he used to be special and kinda fun, now he's just like everyone else
---
too bad only 1/1000 people actually has it on
---
Prep for mega salt in post-game chat.
---
Are you a killer or survivor main? I‚Äôm a killer main and it takes me almost no time to find a lobby as a killer but it usually takes me a long time as survivor.
---
I mean what else are you gonna do lol tbagging isn‚Äôt always BM
---
Of* goddamnit
---
crunchy
---
I usually flop between the two and your right it's much faster finding a game as killer but I also get into lobbys pretty fast as a survivor
---
I think they have this obsession with giving the player "something to strive for."
---
Which, you know, translates to keeping people addicted. The game experience gets exhausting, so they need a carrot to dangle, lest people abandon the game.
---
Except they now have WAY too much stuff to obtain, most of which is useless (like every perk you see below level 30), so they're losing the appeal of attainable completion without realizing it.
---
Thing is they made the achievements like 20x harder for killers for no reason survivor adepts is super easy like 1-2 games at most
---
You know he was saying the exact same thing you just said right? He was responding to someone else who implied the killer might have been BM'ed and that's why he did it. You literally agreed with what he was saying.
---
Dude same lol was gonna ask if this is a ps4 thing. I get into survivor and killers games within a minute consistently.
---
*survivors don‚Äôt immediately die in a jungle gym*
---
‚ÄúOf course they‚Äôre optimal survivors. This is what I have to go up against‚Äù
---
Add a hook or maybe a house behind her and it would be perfect
---
The Pyramid head: 
---
90% MS
---
Terror radius: 16m 
---
Power: Jame's Tormention: Apon hitting the secondary power button you see all lockers outside of a 20m radius (effected by add-ons) of survivors within 50m (effected by add-ons) you can then teleport to the a locker instantly, but it takes 2.5 secionds to exit, you may aswell stay in the locker with the undetectable status effect. Apon hitting the primary power button, if in a locker or not Pyramid head charges (3 secionds effected by add-ons) a long range survivor-wide forward swing that instant downs and hits multible survivors, however only the closest survivor is instant downed. Miss cooldown 1.5 secionds (effected by add-ons) hit cooldown 1 seciond, if activated in a locker the effect takes twice as long but the lunge is increased by 3x. His primary attack aswell has increased max lunge range.
---
Perk 1: Desire's pull. Whenever a survivor is hooked for a seciond time gain a token. For each token gain 0.2% move speed that ramps up to 4% after ten secionds of walking in a direction of a survivor. Apon entering a chase the move speed ramps back down over time.
---
Perk 2: Virgins aura. Every survivor who's yet to be hooked, negative status effects last 25% longer and for every survivor in a 7m radius of them, stacks up to a max of 50% 75% 100%
---
Perk 3: The blind's wish. Everytime you lose chase with a survivor there scratch marks persist even if not running for 5/7/9 secionds. You aswell lose chase twice as fast, however bloodlust is disabled.
---
That's exactly the point, then dont be mad at spirit, billy, and sometimes nurse players and dcing against that killer, they are just trying to do well
---
Ah yes, P E B B L E
---
Xbox queues are almost instant. I‚Äôll get into the lobby and ready up, then go spend my blood points from last match and find a game before I can spend them all.
---
This is incredible
---
Do you really want to face two Bubbas though?
---
You get a singular yike. As if you don't hit people once they're hooked and hawk no mithers because, "iTs A fREe KilL." At least I know I'm an asshole you could at least do the same.
---
Never seen this post before.
---
It's the thought that counts.
---
My boosted ass would have missed.
---
I'll summon him u/drit76
---
These are all good ideas, and I had a good time looking at them!
---
Only $10, no Survivor this time.
---
borrowed time would've helped that and not unhooking in front of the killer, lead them away first at least, especially when the killer is billy.
---
This situation was a 2k that could've been a 3k and cost me a pip
---
No I was just talking about loops that you need balanced landing to run, but thanks anyway lol
---
thinking of the Steve I had just two games ago ü•∫
---
oh that hurt to watch
---
Good?
---
I'm not saying it's not bad, but I've caught survivors doing this to me by simply hopping back through the window and going down the stairs. Mind game helps offset these things. Part of the problem is playing into what survivors expect you to do.
---
Y is for youngbuck
---
I'm glad I could grace your presence with my original idea
---
I just bought him and I've been doing a pretty good job so far. Still baby Legion with low tier perks but I can still get my 4ks at mid ranks.
---
I honestly don't understand the hate now that I've played him.
---
I think she's using a decisive strike...
---
wouldn't the perk synergize with the med kit and make it work even faster?
---
ONE strong competitor. That's all it'll take. One good slasher asym comes out and actually gets marketed, and DbD's community will get chopped in half.
---
But at this rate, it looks like the only way to get that is to make it yourself.
---
Why?
---
How is the killer supposed to correctly play this situation?
---
ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü•∫
---
How else are they going to bully players into just buying the cosmetics?
---
She does lol
---
She also looks like the female version of Frank
---
The question is; did you fulfill both of them at the same time or did you have to do them consecutively?
---
Had a game earlier like this. Was playing solo survivor. Two other survivors were tbagging this very obviously new demogorgan killer. Rank 19 demo with one perk, matchmakes into a lobby of rank 10s. Only manages to get two hooks. Post game chat, the two people are just being incredibly toxic to him. I really don't understand what people get from that. Like..... you can tell they are new to the game. They don't know what they are doing. Don't try to make it seem like tbagging is fine as a way to "teach" them how to play better.
---
Didn't xbox announce an official keyboard and mouse a while ago?
---
Im aware it was an exaggeration, but it was an obvious implication that you can‚Äôt last a long time in chases without them. 
---
Would you like me to correct it? How‚Äôs ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt survive a decent amount of time without infinites then you‚Äôre a garbage player that can only use bad map design to last in chases‚Äù? 
---
It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that infinites are broken and need to be fixed. They don‚Äôt take any skill to use like normal loops do, just like camping and tunneling. However, once infinites are fixed I do think they should remove bloodlust from the game.
---
The amount of insta heals recently
---
Any chance you've been playing against a ton of Spirits? The "in" thing rn is to DC vs Spirit atm hence the question.
---
If you're not facing Spirit, it's likely those "teammates" got outplayed and they're mad about it, I'm really sorry for your shitter experience :/
---
soz, next time i'll play the game normally, holding up m1 and do the objectives, like a normal high rank survivors.
---
I love doing this! If gates are open and someone's on the hook, I will always go for the save. This is what makes the game fun!
---
Isn't that one of the reasons the devs made the archives?
---
Rank 11 and up are usually like that. 7 to about 10 is okay on it. Anything below that is usually okay but be selfish rank 11 down or u will die.
---
I'm really glad to see people indignant about this. Some wallets staying in their pockets for a while should really wake BHVR up.
---
I think any game that has any sort of asymmetrical online gameplay will quickly have factions form. I dont think you have to 50/50 your gameplay perfectly, but playing a bit of both sides definitely helps you decide what's actually OP and what perks/killers/plays styles actually have counters. For instance I'm roughly 80/20 killer but DS and adrenaline dont really bother me, adrenaline wont come into play every match and DS can be played around. Honestly object of obsessions the only perk that really bothers me since it shits on a few killers way to hard and doesn't really hinder a few others.
---
Oh god. That is a tale. Not just Silent Hill.
---
It started off with Konami axing Silent Hills since they basically fired Kojima. Kojima, the master mind for their most popular series, Metal Gear Solid. They took Kojima's name off the Phantom Pain's box and out of the credits. They would not let Kojima attend an award ceremony that MGS won. And have done absolutely everything in their power to slander Kojima.
---
This is also all on top of shitting on MGS' legacy with Metal Gear: Survive. Konami treats their employees like literal shit on their shoes. There is just *so fucking much* it is insane. 
---
Kojima and Del Toro got axed from Silent Hills, so they teamed back up and now are making Death Stranding, which is a huge bonus for everyone. The games going to be...interesting.
---
Is it? Who is gonna pay me to entertain other players? 
---
Out of all the pvp games I have played this is the only one where I've heard that people should ensure the fun of the opposing side, in most games people just play to win and they find the fun in that. And even more bizarre than that is that the responsibility for fun falls in one side more than the other. Ironically it is the killer the one who should make sure everyone is having fun, you never hear people saying "survivors should take it easy on gens so games don't end so fast", if gens get slammed too fast is always the killer's fault for not applying enough pressure.
---
This is self care üòÇ
---
Exactly! I don't care if i win i just want it to be fun
---
Why are my skill checks so laggy
---
any alternatives?
---
Wtf, dude, im joking, are you ok? Thats a whole lot of assumptions from a one sentenced comment.
---
And the downed baby dwight youu left ds you, do the double stun with head on, dropped the pallet and tea bagged you.
---
Am Spidey, can confirm.
---
Are you insulting him about playing a game? How pathetic
---
Ahoy ladies!
---
Does he orgasm every time you hook him tho?
---
goddamn it
---
Take that shit to the forums. PC players do the same things if we‚Äôre not all already dead with 5 gens up because of how sweaty the game is
---
Saw this on Youtube and came here to upvote as well. So exited for Legion/Doctor theme!
---
Bless
---
Bruh why is she bald
---
Sis my pp got stuck in the zipper
---
Oh yeah the game is unbalanced, and the fact that most of the killers are considered unviable at high ranks tells you which side is more favoured.
---
If one survivor dies early in the match it's because they either played like dumbasses or they were completely outclassed, and for the game to punish players for playing well is another thing wrong with this game.
---
Okay damn
---
Those gonna be nastyyyy &lt;3
---
If I can get a decent screen cap of them, then maybe!  Ive been working on this style with another game as well, so I might start on DBD as well if I can get some good shots!  Glad you like this!
---
Yes üòÇ
---
Greatly appreciated!!
---
God you must have a massive dong
---
Been grinding it quite a bit.  Fortunately the event goes to Dec. 4th though!
---
what in the name of god
---
She basically is
---
where is the "gg 2 ez" on chat?
---
Glad you like it!
---
so what happened if the killer wont follow you, even when u showed ur face to em in the open place like keep going back to secure the guy on the hook, like you just watched that dude hang on the hook?
---
Thank you so much!
---
Pig should be able to pick up the removed rbt and reuse again
---
:(
---
I enjoyed that final tbagging you gave him
---
I love this
---
FYI this place is REAL but it's not how I described it I just wanted to make it fit in more to the haunted spooky places in the Entity's realm
---
Git gud
---
if i see another ds endgame video i'm going to lose my fucking mind 
---
stop uploading these it's not impressive it's embarrassing
---
the clown lost his vision permanently
---
"Some players are just dicks regardless" that's the point I was making but after rereading I see that it's worded funny. People assume a killer has to have had a bad experience or is only retaliating when they are toxic and it's never assumed the other way around is what i meant.
---
vinc3ntvega
---
I agree that‚Äôs the pinnacle of the game for me, besides looping the killer and losing them with unique pathing (I play optimally but I try to stay away from the run in a circle until you have to throw the pallet if I can help it). But I keep BT on literally all the time, it‚Äôs the only perk I don‚Äôt run without. Unless I have a string of dumbass tm8s and I get really really salty then I‚Äôll take it on for like a couple games then a situation where BT could save everyone comes and a facecamping killer gets a pity kill for example. And it makes it so the killer doesn‚Äôt have a reason to slug. Everyone should run it
---
i think maybe three floors instead of four, but sounds like a solid, great idea!
---
The slash travelled through the air. Duh!
---
If you dont mind me asking why just 3?
---
If you do something to piss someone off, they'll react, not sure why you're shocked. Also fuck you for using the actions of one person to discriminate against a whole group of people.
---
Absolutely. But unfortunately, they survive the same way EA does: People will keep paying them. People will buy every DLC at release no matter what, and until that stops, why should they develop standards?
---
Of course, I refuse to give them a penny more, and that gives me the PAINFULLY grindy experience of being "F2P." And that state shouldn't exist in a pay-to-play game, but here I am, never to own Michael.
---
Pretty much.
---
They gave you a solution
---
imagine if you missed it because he was laggy
---
On console the frame rate isn't very good. So if you look straight at the sky there are less pixels that need to be rendered and you get some more frame rate. Works too if you stare at a wall.
---
Dont run! At the start dont jump on gens.. if you dont know where is the killer and fail rhe gen.. move to the next one.. use yoir mic
---
I had the offering that puts you away from the killer, a toolbox with two add-ons. She saved me from a hook, I returned the favor when it mattered the most. We were gonna live! :‚Äô)
---
He probably took a trip down to the forums after and complained that DS is too overpowered.
---
He could have probably hooked her before she hit it from there honestly - and if not, he could have dribbled her.
---
Yeah I wanted to but was crunching for the deadline, ahaha üòÖ
---
It is I....the creator of this stencil.
---
...and the carving turned out real nice!
---
Insert mandatory "git gud" comment here so no other fuck wads do it to you
---
But in all seriousness I recommend running as little as possible, walk whenever you can, and play it like a game of hide and seek. Spine chill, stake out, and quick and quiet are all perks that help me stay stealthier because I can find out where the killer is and get somewhere safe without notifying them
---
This is console people are bloody idiots and never join parties. Also I don‚Äôt go on gens anymore because I know I‚Äôll get tunneled
---
RIGHT LMAO
---
If it doesn‚Äôt help me, the other person‚Äôs bad. Flawless logic.
---
Nah, make it Mikami so I could hear him yell "Delete" whenever he downs someone.
---
Dribbling doesn't work for DS anymore, as soon as your able to move or dribble the survivor their ds is started. The second you pick them up you can get ds'd.
---
lol yeah next time i'll do that, run to the other side of the map just to make distraction by making noises hoping the killer will notice me hahaha
---
Shit. New map leak?
---
I‚Äôve already gotten the git gud comment.
---
They were blocked
---
https://discord.gg/bncsTbx
---
I'd love 4 flashlights, the gens will be going super slowly coz everyone will be running after me when I'm chasing someone, trying to get a fl save. It's my favourite item to see a survivor bring :D
---
ayeee yes say it louder for the people in the back haha
---
Last week after completing my third daily I was given three more immediately. This week one of my dailies changed from get unhooks as bill to shocking survivors after completing a match. PS4
---
idk but this doesn't apply to me
---
Say that to the killers complaining about survivors tbagging
---
2 options that worked for me against tunnelers. 
---
Dead hard, decisive strike, unbreakable (may as well add adrenaline)
---
Or believe or not. Sprint burst. Alone it works well. You'll be Half way across the map once the killer comes back, and sprint burst  is ready to go when u get off the hook. 
---
Now add lightweight to it &amp; iron will, combined with dark clothes &amp; you shouldn't get tunneled anymore. Remember to stay far out from the area you got hooked. A lot of times the killers will find you lurking in that area or side of the map.  (Sprint burst+ lightweight+ iron will= good anti tunnel build if you're not going with DS) 
---
Remember to 99 your sprint burst on cooldown so you can run freely.
---
Mr. seal yo girl
---
Let's say you get unhooked, and you get on a gen near the hook with the unhooker. You can finish a whole gen together, and still have DS up. You can complete a 1/5 of your objective while being entirely unhookable. It's not always a matter of tunnelling. I have had and seen games where two hooks happen after the unhook, and DS still procs. Are you going to tell me that the killer tunnelled in that situation?
---
Don't even get me started on DS users getting in a locker any time you come near to their gen... Either you eat the DS, wait out the remaining timer, or leave, which is stupid.
---
Guys he got an ebony
---
 it is so much easier to counter billy than spirit. And billy has a one hit down move which makes him a MUCH easier character to play with (use to be a billy main). With the spirit, you have to be a good predictor to know where to phase. It may seem easy, but it‚Äôs one hell of a challenge. Where as with billy, you can down character with one swipe of the chainsaw.
---
but we failed to make him angry, he's the tough one, and we're the one who dced. lol
---
This is the most helpful comment I‚Äôve gotten
---
It looks to me the ghostface doesn't know how to counter DS by hooking her RIGHT NEXT TO THE EXIT GATE.
---
To be fair, you can catch a life threatening illness by working on a gen with plague vomit covering it...
---
...I'll show myself out.
---
Most games (mine atleast) don't last longer than 10 minutes. If you get unhooked twice, that's 1/5 of the game where you can't be picked up. That's atrocious. I'd been fine with cutting the time in half, but having the timer stop while being chased.
---
I am
---
&amp; the guy who said get good says he runs stealth builds- meaning he's not good otherwise he wouldn't be hiding like a blendette. RIP dude. If you was good you would be running perks to run the killer for 5 gens. The moment you get spotted your luck runs out.
---
Objection!
---
Relevance?
---
Leatherface is the best killer especially at high ranks
---
I play both sides and will continue to, still prefer Killer over Survivor.  Even if it comes off as biased, the cliche/stereotypical "Survivor Main" types are the worst type.  *slow shrug*
---
I can't be the only one who feels like he's worse to go against as a survivor am I? 90% of them have fake pallets, and when I go down because the pallet was fake, I feel somewhat cheated
---
Agreed.
---
Oh I have that on but he still manages to sneak up on me. It's likely just me being bad.
---
I know.. if i play as survivorse.. 1left, 1run around the map, 1fail the gens what im working on.. and me try to look after the hatch cause everyone dead...
---
But if im the killer i got full team with rank 10 or under while im only 16...
---
"Devour Hope op" omegalul. Opinion discarded.
---
Yup
---
That blows. I mean yea we are all frustrated and I suspect this whole battle pass thing may have contributed to the delay but it really does look like they launched it and found their messy spaghetti code was broken in a way they couldn't quickly fix. 
---
There are a lot of issues with this game so I can see why people are pissed off.
---
I read that as 5 SWF survivors, and with BHVR's coding, I'd believe it.
---
She can find me with her brain. If i have to guess where she is why doesn't she.
---
Ummm I was the one trying to argue lol?  I'm not the one that replied calling out my comment lol!  That was him but it looks like he realized after the fact we were saying the same thing.  But I 100% didn't start an argument with anyone I was the one that was responded to.
---
There‚Äôs a streamer I watch sometimes. I really enjoy it when she plays survivor but she‚Äôs so toxic when she plays killer and always says ‚Äúthey must be swf‚Äù when she loses. It‚Äôs so annoying.
---
The sprint burst combo was the one build I always use to run when I didn't have decisive. It helped a lot in chases, but it mainly prevented me from getting tunneled. Overall work darker clothes so you don't become a target &amp; don't be afraid to get chase by the killer. You can only stealth for so long before you have to face the killer. The best thing I can say is, don't be afraid. Don't panic, and try to keep your chases to at least a minute long. Gradually working on longer chases.
---
They taunt us
---
I can keep my cool just fine and I also have decisive but it‚Äôs whatever
---
I love the idea of the power! But I don‚Äôt think it would be Freddy they would add, I think they would add springtrap though since he was a killer   In the Fnaf universe. I could see the power working fine with either of them though. I also think having a Freddy fazbear pizzeria map would be awesome!
---
Honestly I thought we were talking about the dude that babyraged and deleted his comments.  I didn't even realize it was 2 different people.  I was referring to that biased killer dude with the victim complex.  Different person I guess.
---
He is one of my main killers. He is so versatile; like a demogorgon who trades the pounce for traps, a trade I'd make any day. And if you feel like an asshole you can run infinite freddy and make people realize spirit isn't the worst thing you can go against.
---
MS : after hooking a survivor in basement, you can Mori them next time you down them but you need to be 32 m away from hook to activate Ms. ( That's what I think, so people don't camp basement and this useless perk will finally do something)
---
Not that lore is the first concern, but Pyramid Head is supposed to SPECIFICALLY correspond to James' psychological trauma, so...
---
...how about Safe-Face from Evil Within? DbD seems to get the knockoff version of things almost traditionally, anyway. Ghostface's costume, Pedo Freddo...
---
proud of u
---
Scrap STBFL imo, it doesn‚Äôt stack with his power, you‚Äôre better off using Sloppy Butcher or some other perk that has synergy with the others!
---
Wait, which movie was this?
---
You already lost that argument.  Let it go.
---
My vote goes to Keys
---
No. It‚Äôs probably the same guy but you just SEVERELY misunderstood his sarcasm, since this is the same dude you called biased the very first time you responded to him. He was literally saying the killer got what he deserved and made fun of someone for implying the killer must have been bullied to do it and you misunderstood the sarcasm instantly. He probably deleted his comment because it wasn‚Äôt worth arguing about something you were on the same page about but you just didn‚Äôt read properly lmao
---
Woah, what's a solid stun time for you? 8 seconds? 10 seconds? 5 seconds is an eternity in a game about buying time and gaining leads in a chase. And you're forgetting the time that chasing them will take, which can be upwards of a minute if they're good. And that they heal a state from dying to injured. And that it's a personal perk, which unlike BT does not require teamwork so you can rely on yourself. And there's no indication someone has it until it's used. And that it promotes slugging, which is really lame for killers and survivors. Very few perks do all those things at once while lasting a full minute.
---
It can lead to some really lame games. I had downed this guy who was the last survivor since everyone else escaped/died. The thing is, he was unhooked maybe a dozen seconds or so ago. So I had counted to 50 and watched him sit there and stew before picking him up and rehooking. That player was furious at me for "taunting him and delaying the game" even though the ONLY move that wouldn't risk his escape to the open gates nearby was to simply wait to avoid the DS. He DID have DS and I explained it was the only move I could make but he was still angry, even though it was clear he wanted me to pick him up so he could win. Imagine if he didn't have it - I still would've had to do it since there's no telling  until after the match. Believe me when I say I 'd rather just hook and leave, but the only counter play to DS is slugging.
---
You might say "the solution is to not tunnel," but often times DS comes into play even without tunneling. Maybe an injured survivor tried to save you and you both were downed. Maybe they downed you, switched targets and left, you recovered enough to heal before getting downed again but you still have DS active. 60 seconds is an eternity in a game based on time management. And the solution can't be just letting someone walk away since they'll have DS for later, and as the number of players get smaller there's less and less people to switch to.
---
It seems like overkill when there are other anti-tunneling perks that don't directly dump on the killer like that. Borrowed time, breakdown, to an extent MoM/dead hard/adrenaline - all of these are recommended to varying degrees in anti-tunneling build threads in this very subreddit, but the difference is DS is in those threads and every game you play past rank 10.
---
Once you breach purple it's a given that nearly everyone you face/work with is running DS if they're playing seriously. Everyone uses it because it's stupid good - just like BBQ, just like adrenaline, just like ruin, just like the same meta perks every game. It's not OP, it's just another rote meta perk that gets more hate than the others because it turns the gameplay backwards. Survivors shouldn't be hoping to be grabbed by the killer and the killer shouldn't be afraid to hook people, especially when most people don't enjoy the thrilling gameplay of being a slug.
---
what servers you playing on?
---
Yeah, I'm sure he'd have made it through the inevitable cloud of body blocks. 
---
I think DS should be disabled after the last gen. As long as the status quo stays, face camping will inevitably continue. A survivor being hooked after the gates are open should feel like a hopeless rescue, not a guaranteed success.
---
Taking bets! I give a 10:1 odds of at least one major bug still present on the update!
---
I‚Äôm playing on console, PS4
---
Don't listen to him.. STBFL is one of legions best perks.
---
Are you red rank?
---
Rank 11 good sir/ma‚Äôam
---
*oof*
---
Ash from pallet town
---
STBFL is one of the absolute best perks for Legion you crazy man. If you can manage it correctly, at least. You can hit the same target twice for two stacks to break Feral; the only other people better are ones with downing moves like Demogorgon who can bypass the obsession, but they can't stack the hits like he can.
---
I know it‚Äôs p bad but it‚Äôs all I got :(
---
STBFL works great on legion, and sloppy doesn't get applied on frenzy hits.
---
I just watched this movie the other day. Good ass horror movie.
---
wazzzzzzaaaaaaaap
---
I like the remake better, much scarier Freddy, IMO we already got the good one.
---
One time, there was 1 generator left to finish, 3 of us left. Nancy was healing me near a generator we were working on. Huntress damaged it and went towards her friend that was downed. I gestured Nancy to fix the generator while I ran to her friend but she was sacrificed before I made it there. I ran back towards the generator and saw Nancy hiding behind some tires and noticed the Huntress was back to damage the generator again so I run past Nancy and brushed past the Huntress and lead her on a merry chase so Nancy could finish the generator. She did, and got the exit gates open but before she could leave, I got hooked, and I was planning to suicide on hook so she could escape but she refused to let me die and came to rescue me.... In the end, we both died. They messaged me postgame and thanked me.
---
Oh... thanks lmao I'm dumb
---
If this ever happens and I‚Äôm the killer I like to stare directly at them for 6-8 seconds. If they stay there I down and hook them. If they run off I hit/down them but don‚Äôt hook. If they realize I know they‚Äôre there and they walk out sheepishly I leave them XD.
---
I'd wager that the event tracking and the archives progress is borked day 1 and they have to extend the event another week or two
---
NOED is a counter to adrenaline and the nurse will still remain the strongest killer after nerf
---
Yeah I just started playing and have never seen a spirit and every nurse I come up against isn't too difficult to deal with
---
oh okay. just watched a video and brutal strength, pgtw, stbfl, and bbq seems like the build for me
---
Idk man, a little game awareness tells to me the only other 2 survivors left are both injured and one could easily be chased out the gate.
---
Bodyblocking would be a very stupid move on the survivor's part.
---
If you can, for the love of god get a pc. You can build a serviceable one for the same price as a console.
---
You have to press your action button untill the bar is completely full and then let go. 
---
If it‚Äôs not that then it‚Äôs probably a bug ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
---
Keys and moris should be changed today.
---
Fucking hell, someone else told me you DON‚ÄôT get stacks using Frenzy, this shit‚Äôs confusing
---
I mean, I didn't disagree with your point about people complaining, but I apologize if I gave the wrong idea. 
---
I guess my post was more of a "don't be mad you can't catch someone because your killer isn't suited for certain loops," kind of directed towards anybody.
---
Well he was teabagging before she even unhooked herself... So yeah, I'd say he's pretty toxic?
---
With killer times the skeleton would have decomposed before a match started
---
He's wrong. He does get stacks during frenzy. That's why it's so good on him.
---
It‚Äôs def just you. The later it gets, the longer the queue is. Drives me insane. And killer queues are outrageously long for me
---
You can see though that he was the first one to respond to my original comment no?  The comment I made not arguing or conversing with a single person no?  He then responded to me and later admitted to misunderstanding my comment.  Yet I'm getting all the blame lol?
---
Its unplayable on ps4 solo survivor. Just not fun at all
---
Oh interesting  I did hate that play so I‚Äôm glad to be mistaken.
---
The fire that coulda been in the post match chat
---
 Neko-mimi GhostFace
---
Title is very wrong. That ghost face isn't a clown, he's the entire circus.
---
Thank youüíÖ
---
*yoink*
---
*laughs in devour hope*
---
Not useless.. but not as good as it would first seem.
---
I‚Äôd really enjoy it if every time I did he said a random fact like that.
---
It's just to show that it can be an actual percent, but at their one its zero. I feel you tho
---
I play as killer and survivor and there is definitely a difference. Ranking up and getting blood points is definitely easier for killers and when Simone dc‚Äôs early game it‚Äôs almost always game over (unless I find the hatch).
---
And I think the ghostface played badly for failing to exploit their altruism.
---
It's easy to cry about "broken" perks when in fact your decision making is just poor.
---
Yikes...gross....yeah I'm survivor main so ik just messing around with killers lately. I have no perks tho. Haha
---
oY
---
One time I opened the wrong locker when chasing a meg and I found a dwight.
---
Dammit Bill!
---
Freddy is a top tier killer, so yes.
---
This is some pre-nerf nurse tier comedy
---
I love this so much !
---
I mean honestly a lot of us are upset that BHVR isn‚Äôt letting us throw our money at them which is hilarious... but you‚Äôre right there isn‚Äôt another game to run to. I just wish the devs and the community got along better.
---
This basically happened with dedicated lmao
---
Op got out-gamered
---
When I think of purple ranks, I do think they are solid, tho I have seen a lot of bad/boosted players in purple, and you see it at red ranks too. I don‚Äôt know if you are good, bad, in between, so I‚Äôll keep it semi broad. 
---
Get good at looping. A lot of this simply comes down to practice. The better you are at running simply increases your chance of surviving, and often times, killers will want to chase the weaker players to ensure they get kills. Being a great runner vs a good runner is quite a big difference. Zubat streams pretty regularly, I recommend you watch him :)
---
Some perks can help too. Do you find that you are often caught in poor positions? Sprint burst allows you to escape if you are ever caught in a bad position. Balance landing is nuts if you can abuse different houses well. I think dead hard is the best overall, especially at higher ranks. Just use it for distance to reach a pallet/window. If tunnelled a lot, use DS. If slugged a lot, use unbreakable. Things like Spine Chill can give you a good heads up too if the killer is coming :) 
---
If you want to practice running, use a survivor with a bright jacket, usually works :)
---
Yeah, how dare people try to play the game "optimally", they should just make killer's life as easy as possible. 
---
And we all know survivors kobe we off hooks in every single game. So when you decide to BM and get fucked by RNG you can just complain about a "broken" crutch perk instead.
---
Thx for the help I‚Äôll try it
---
What?
---
I played him a lot more before the nerf. I still like him now, he‚Äôs really good, but I enjoyed him more before
---
Oh lord would I wouldn't do to see that post chat.
---
I don't even care about escaping, if I can body block for giggles. I'll do it.
---
But some of us need to suffer
---
Hey I've seen this from david's perspective
---
I think that's Ben Shapiro in the picture. He said trapper Shapiro because it's Ben with the trappers mask on. At least that's what I think I could be totally wrong
---
I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre being downvoted. Is it seriously wrong to play the game the way it was supposed to be played?
---
At least it seems DBD is getting dedicated servers before V2 does.
---
I got my adept hag in the game using the body blocker hag build
---
When Demogorgon said üå∏ i felt that  
---
So did Laurie
---
"TrU3 BaD, GiMMe UpVotES"
---
Why are people dcing against spirit?
---
Honestly they could easily do this. Cause there ain't SHIT being done with this property, just collecting dust
---
Bravo!!! As a survivor main I love when killers get that sweet karma like revenge serve to them. I encounter this to often, so I enjoyed watching this a little too much. 
---
Especially the fact you made sure to get in his view to commence and deliver the t-bags to him. üëª This juts made my halloween. 
---
Happy halloween op mate ü§£
---
Yeah, because it's not enough that it was nerfed. These fucks won't be satisfied until survivors spawn on hook.
---
From what I've read there is currently no punishment for dcs since the game is unable to reliably determine the cause of disconnects. Since each match is hosted by a player switching to dedicated servers would let the devs track why people are disconnecting and add punishments. This needs to be confirmed though, 2 minutes of googling only found articles and forum posts so if anyone has a link to a dev directly saying this it'd be appreciated.
---
"Playing on 4 fps and bad controlls while losing all previous progress from your pc/console"
---
Pro tip from an epic gamer: Don't tunnel Laurie Strode
---
I hate getting to red ranks on ps4 cause I feel like I face the literal same person (not killer, same actual person) multiple times in a row, but I also dont wanna go to green ranks cause I know they leave you on hook a lot even after a super long chase. It sucks it's like there is no perfect level to chill at lol
---
I get bullied when I try to let people have fun...
---
Remap it to the mouse wheel scroll. It takes so little effort comparatively and it saves your keys and keyblard from all that abuse, and you are much less likely to miss the beat.
---
Leave that Baby Ash alone :'(
---
Not blaming the survivors for the balancing work that should have been done by BHVR.
---
If I have to over optimize only s-tier killers in order to compete, something ain't working right. That's the reality in game right now. Weaker killers aren't functional against optimized survivors, and that shows a fundamental issue with those perks.
---
I don't BM, but I get shit on just the same. Frankly, perks should be ranked, and players should be limited to only a specific number of said ranked perks, just so people can't run over optimized broke ass builds on either side of the coin. Something similar already exists with exhaustion perks and that balances things out well.
---
I don't know about you, but it gets pretty boring chasing the same sweaty survivor builds while being forced to play a very small list of viable killers with an even smaller list of viable perks to counter with.
---
Seems like everybody is so wrapped up with being try-hards that they forgot the game is supposed to be fun. The only killers having fun today are either masochists, Monto, or rank 14+.
---
The game is cheaper in steam, in console it‚Äôs 30$ I think
---
The two of you are getting downvoted for jacking each other off in the comments and offering nothing of substance to the conversation besides "lol kilur mainz".
---
Hope that clears that up.
---
One killer face camp the other chase. GgZ
---
Ghostbusters chapter when?
---
"DS IS SO OVERPOWERED, I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY ESCAPED WHEN I HOOKED THEM NEXT TO THE EXIT GATE!!!!!"
---
Uh, I see you're very passionate about Dwight.
---
What if one of the killer was trolling while playing the trapper by letting the other killer step on his traps that would be hilarious as hell.
---
How about make the male version Faster and Female recover Fatigue faster.
---
By not hooking her next to the gate in the first place.
---
My legion build is Discordance MadGrit IronGrasp and Sloppy Butcher or Bitter Murmur
---
I love him too, don't get me wrong. It's just I feel like a lot of prestiged characters look underwhelming. The coolest looking to me is probably Quentin.
---
Ya know, i think it'd be rad if say, you picked Frank. The rest of the legion gang, the ones you didn't pick, would spawn on the map. Idle poses, twirling knife, sitting on a crate, leaning on a wall..  
---
You couldn't interact with them, but they'd just be there.
---
Chase the killer
---
He shoulda known right when you Kobe‚Äôd it was over because you were Laurie lol.
---
I think so
---
If you feel that way talk to a therapist bro
---
Idk. They did that with Enduring for awhile then removed it.
---
I've done something better; stop playing the game. It's been much better and I feel like a nicer person.
---
Great loops like in the coal towers or the barn are the only defense against tunneling. Thats why you're not supposed to focus on one survivor
---
I have this hero complex...and I need it to go away. I'd rather live cowardly like cersei than die heroically FOR NOTHING like theon or jamie :(.
---
The daily rituals have been messed up lately. The other day I was playing when it reseted, and I got a hillbilly daily, I canceled it, it gave me a consecutive action for whatever seconds. I played a game, when finished it changed to a Freddy daily. Smh.
---
The rule of thumb is, you run into one asshole; they‚Äôre probably an asshole. You run into assholes all day? You‚Äôre the asshole. Quitting the game only delays the inevitable.
---
Shut the fuck up idiot
---
I like it
---
I like how you're "acting" nice and trying to suggest I get help while also downvoting me and proving why deleting the game was smart.
---
I really thought the bold words, crossed out t-bag and description basically saying Ghostface knew he was gonna get DS'd would be enough to convey sarcasm without the /s. Oh well, I tried.
---
I agree with what you're saying, that Ghostface was totally taking the piss and you shouldn't have been downvoted in the first place.
---
TBH this could be an actual good perk if it was real
---
Are you having a mental breakdown?
---
His assholnes :"Iam inevitable
---
Did you need to be a snarky little bitch?
---
Happened to me tonight- 4 man SWF, gone after the first one got downed not even hooked.
---
I have a friend who is a piece of shit on any game. Also in real life. Maybe you're like him who knows.
---
Yet here you are, spending your free time texting me back at your earliest convenience. It‚Äôs cute.
---
Noed is not activated by end game collapse, but by all gens being done right?
---
Remember when you could pick lesser tier perks to equip.
---
I would agree. It doesn't make sense to bring it unless you actually like getting chased, though I have seem some survivors claim to bring it for stealth purposes which is pretty dumb imo.
---
I still have some uncommon and common map offerings too, on my Trapper.
---
Yep. This happened to me twice while playing Hag today.
---
Was chasing a Survivor, suddenly got kicked out and sent to the Post-Game screen, with it saying I had disconnected/quit, gave me zero points, and didn‚Äôt count.
---
fake boobs, makeup, wigs, girly clothing, nails, jewelry.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
its the same thing as a trans, clown is acting as a normal comedic character and drags are acting as the other gender which is exactly what trans do, there is nothing sexual about clown where the entire concept of drags is basically sexual, there is clearly something wrong with that guy in video, so i think im gonna go around dressed up as a fox or something and think im actually that animal, but im perfectly normal and no one will point that out
---
P3 Claudette and stealth builds help me last longer. They can't tunnel you of they can't see/find you.
---
lol, I got reported yesterday for using scratch mirror Myers with M&amp;A. "no terror radius?, why didn't spine chill work?, seems suspect, reported" lol
---
Oh yea i remember that , at that time i only played  Killer  so sprint  burst was annoying as hell
---
Yeah, this game need a lot more of this! too much toxicity from salty players.
---
Looks like someone is getting Tapp'd ;D 
---
I wish I had friends to do silly things like this. I cri
---
To me Killer takes forever on console. Xbox btw
---
Well said. And I just want to add on that the "stereotype" is that when you get a SWF group, it usually suggests that they're either really skilled as a team, and/or using something like Discord to speak to each other through a voice chat. (Basically, a lot of communication and teamwork against you)
---
I know most would understand at this point, but I'll explain it just in case new players may not understand the joke fully. This post is jokingly suggesting that a "bully" or high coordinated group worked hard to basically win severely against the killer. So the high rank dude's comforting him over the experience.
---
I've played 200 or so hours of killer and just started to get into survivor. I mostly haven't until this point since I like the fact that killer has no one else to help them. Not in the sense of "I'm tired of having shit teammates so now I'm gunna be my team" but more in the sense that I'm playing a single player game with really good AI. It's funny now though playing survivor since I know what I should be doing I just have difficulty doing it. Like I know what I should be doing in a chase but I'll make some dumb mistake that would make me look like an idiot.
---
Don‚Äôt insult Jane like that.
---
I smell a salty survivor
---
Same reason Frank is bald and Suzie only has sideburns. Hair would clip through the mask.
---
This uhh, isn‚Äôt a Bug.
---
Incest
---
And vice versa. If I have to face the best of the best sweating their asses off on either side, then I deserve \*something\* for going through that fresh hell. Gotten to the point where I refuse to play this game often enough to make it past green, let alone get to red again.
---
Yooo that's sick
---
The shot add on was purple?! Damn I'm new
---
If "viable" means "get to red ranks and stay there" - yes. If "viable" means "getting 4k every other game" (that's not "viable", btw) then I'm not sure.
---
I went against an ebony mori, noed, camping, tunelling &amp; op addon clown. Do you think I'd want to play against that? No one would.
---
How are you enjoying the red ranks?
---
Well, depending on the connection, whether it‚Äôs yours or the host‚Äôs internet being bad, getting hit when it shouldn‚Äôt have when playing survivor is entirely possible, but since your always the host when playing killer, you‚Äôre gonna see exactly what you should see as the other survivor have to connect to you.
---
Survivors always use lockers in my games
---
Just tunnel and camp as you see fit. Let the game tell you what not to do not your opposition. With tunnel the target should be in more defensible position and 3 others have no pressure. With camp 3 others have no pressure and you're predictable. If they body block as a team all 4 can get out
---
While I love the idea, I more so have the issue with the fact that Joey and Susie don't have dedicated cosmetics in the game WITHOUT paying for them. 
---
People can call these bonuses as small as they like, but the Vault Speed Increase  (Joey) gives a smaller window for Counterplay for Survivors. While I am specifically not calling it OP, it's better than Julie's in my mind and I don't know how I really *feel* about needing to buy a cosmetic to use it. If they add them in it'll be perfect IMO, linking their personalities to who you play is genius and would vary addon usage depending on which one you play as, which I find really interesting.
---
Well that‚Äôs 10/10 on the weird bugs scale
---
Thanks!
---
*theyre literallybjuss*
---
*thheyre literally juss vibing**
---
Well it's good until match making pairs you up with 3 sub 10 ranks. ^_^
---
Nurse's would be better instead of Surveillence, cause you can get some stalking progress while they're healing. Enduring might be pretty good as well.
---
On the other hand they said that most oft the problems which caused the update to be delayed originated with the change of the engine to unreal engine 4.22. With this update they want to change something fundamental in the game, even if its not that visible. So the problem wasn't that they were unable to create skins, the archives of so in time, but that they discovered too many problems with the new engine in the PTB and don't want to publish this update with all these problems. And I personally prefer to wait a week instead of experiencing the bugs first hand
---
It‚Äôs an exhaustion perk that can free a survivor from the killers grasp. Head on requires more set up then other exhaustion perks but the potential is massive
---
Took me way longer than I want to admit to figure out the skill test thing while repairing generator in the tutorial  lolol
---
The reason why DS shouldn't trigger in the EGC.
---
Gives you godmode for doing nothing at all.
---
Lol, get over yourself.
---
I agree, and the fact that you even need to buy Joey and Susie separately in the first place seems like false advertising on the devs‚Äôs part.
---
‚ÄúLOL, our entire advertising campaign for this DLC is that the Killer is actually 4 different people? Put 2 of those 4 behind a paywall and give the other 2 lame cosmetics.‚Äù -BHVR, 2018
---
My only problem with this daily is the leaning. Most of the time I'll 99 someone and start a chase, when I'm close enough to hit or starting to get revealed I'll pop it.
---
Ah, okay your on pc
---
 So you're saying survivors being 100% vulnerable in endgame collapse is completely fair? Another toxic player we don't need in the game's community. People like you actually ruin the DBD.
---
Yeah I think it's pretty fucking BS too tbh, plus idk if you've noticed, but all the genuine "real" cosmetics (So Green Rarity and Above) are all either Joey or Susie? There's no Frank or Julie ones, almost like they're not real selling points and the devs know what they're doing ;)
---
Although there was a leak recently about a new Legion Cosmetic, no idea if it's a Frank or Julie one, but I'll eat my hat when it comes to it if it is one of those two. The devs know what they're doing and it's moderately disgusting xD

Wait, your telling me consoles don't have dedicated servers yet?
---
I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs good lol, not insta heal strength but definitely not a meme perk either
---
"Does this outfit make me look fat"
---
When I first started playing the only killer I had purchased was Bubba, a friend had told me I'd want his perks. I was low rank, got my first 4k ever and was feeling good. In the post game chat this entire party went of on me about having no skill and how easy it must be to play a character that requires no skill and has a one shot. I figured Bubba must be considered op until I told my buddy a few days later and he laughed and me and told me hes terrible.
---
Did you say no homo?
---
i don‚Äôt think so, people are always talking about dedicated servers but there‚Äôs clearly no ping bar for killers on console.
---
Tbf, unless you are a very coordinated swf. Sabotaging all 4 basement hooks in time is pretty challenging
---
No one else gonna comment on the fact that is a a ‚Äòparty‚Äô but only them two are there.....
---
I think the closest we have is the birds on the swamp map and the thing on gas haven that bings when you walk over it
---
you think thats bad? we only have 3 survivors (claudette, dwight meg) and 2 killers for free on mobile (trapper, hillbilly) the rest are locked. no free jake or wraith
---
That doesn't eliminate latency. In some cases, it makes it worse.
---
With peer-to-peer, the Killer acted as the host amd always had the advantage, where latency is involved.
---
With dedicated servers, the Killer now has to connect to the servers, meaning they can get screwed by latency, just as much as the Survivors. On top of this, if all players in a match have 60ms ping, then it's actually the equivalent of 120ms.
---
Just wait until you have to play against a killer with Hex: Ruin. You‚Äôll *love* doing skill checks.
---
Baby fenggg
---
I mean your right about the entity feeding on the fear of the characters. Therefor the entity cares about the characters feelings, but when in comes to the actual player controlling the character I can assure you that the players do not fear anything about the entity. So the entity doesn‚Äôt care about the feelings of players, just the feelings of the characters which they control.
---
Colours matching, cozy and warm sweater, hell yeah
---
I don't really understand what you are saying? How would making it impossible to enshrine when someone is downed matter if they can enshrine while someone is hooked? 
---
I never said if supported anti-camping and I don't know why you quoted "this fucking comment." It's not like it supports camping either outside of countering DS with the mori, since the exposed does nothing against an injured person. I don't think completely removing the exposed effect on a set up perk that does nothing until someone has is in the struggle phase is a good idea as a potential few seconds of auras does almost nothing.. It would be weaker than dark sense.
---
For the second one, if anything, having potentially infinite lit totems to cleanse means more objective emblem points.. You would still get the points for cleansing lit totems, you just can't destroy totems.
---
You say it isn't applicable, but why is it not? Do you think the devs don't have the capability to link totems to survivors? Or making totems not break upon cleansing?
---
Errrmmmm... No.
---
These loops can be used by anyone, not just those who are being tunnelled.
---
Do you mean we should abandon anyone that goes there, because then it may become impossible to get downs without 1-shots.
---
Pallets need to be the same for game design. Recognize it even in reflex.
---
But ive noticed alot of variation and interaction in maps theyve been making. All kinds of moving and interesting deisgn in the Stranger things level, all those opening doors on The Game.
---
As for more interactive objects...apparently, theyve REMOVED the blight blossoms in the halloween event because people COMPLAINED? Dont like touching things that arent generators, apparently. Probably not going to try it again.
---
BIGGER HAIR!
---
Are you two different ranks? That always makes it worse
---
You need to learn how to loop yesterday if you're already at purple ranks.  You won't be able to handle yourself in a chase against increasingly better killers as you continue to rank up if you don't.   As annoying as it is for you I promise your teamates are like how the hell did dude go down to a Wraith in 15 seconds?  
---
Tons of great YouTube videos for learning to loop.  Go there.  This game becomes much more fun once you know how to run a killer.  Most of the perks people will recommend like Dead Hard and Decisive won't really help you until you learn this skillset.
---
NeRf DeCisiVE StriKe
---
Those who think they're "wonderful", probably aren't. And judging by other comments, you're definitely the type of person you so accurately describe in your post.
---
They must have some sort of disorder. The game feels so monotonous after awhile. I would kill for some variation in objectives and interactables.

If you're a survivor and actually get salty over any killer using ruin you're trash.  Lol seriously man git gud man.  Ruin is nothing if you ain't potato.
---
Sounds like Spiderman 2 PS2
---
I was terrified when I first started. Wait until you get jumpscares because of Myers, Pig....a lot of fun to come ! Enjoy :)
---
The hag jumpscares and she still scares me to this day. I scream everytime she jumps out of a trap
---
Yeeeesss! Nice!
---
For me it's when ghostface, myers or pig just pops out of nowhere and grabs you off a gen.
---
Im gonna predict the major bug : randomly be unable to hook/unhook survivors.
---
not gonna judge but i don‚Äôt think legs work like that
---
Lmao! That's awesome
---
Yeah that annoys me more than anything tbh. Or a yoinking spirit. Tbh I get scared more when I'm playing killer (I know this may sound weird) but when I'm just walking through a pallet and someone thinks I saw them but I didnt they just drop it on me and My heart jumps out of my body.
---
Me too!! Getting 60k to use a chainsaw 4 times never felt so good
---
trust me, I jump just as much when I get trapped in a trap, finding ghost face or myers stalking my ass, the portal that shits out the demogorgon, and when I see that fat bastard swishing up a nice bottle of fuck you
---
Even survive with friends :(
---
Tbh the most scared I ever got at dbd was when I was killer, let's just say it was my first introduction to 'head on'.
---
In what multiverse both sides said gg to eachother?
---
We had to had a messaging argument over who would dc lmao
---
*shortcut center flashlight screen*
---
They dont always have enough distance to make it a loop. You can prevent them from getting there, for example forcing a survivor on the opposite side of a pallet before breaking it. Otherwise yes leave them if you have a better place to be, they made it to the safe spot and a good player recognizes that.
---
For example the asylum,  its a big structure with lots of pallet strong windows and a gen while the rest of the map is weak. I just chase the survivor so they drop a pallet and use the height to look for other targets since all gens are visible and accessible from the building. Finding survivor on a gen outside the building is a guaranteed easy hit.
---
That happened to a hag when I was playing survivor a while back in.. slaughterhouse in the center map &gt;_&gt;. Another bug I encountered vs leatherface was that he couldnt hit me at all. It was so weird, all his attacks just went through me. I felt bad so I didn‚Äôt do much for the game.
---
  I managed to get the hag out of it somehow but unfortunately I don‚Äôt recall. How did you get out of it? Were you able to place traps?
---
I use head on every game üëÄ
---
Trust me, killers get scared af if you jump out and they don't know you're there.
---
I never got out lmao. They just did the gens and escaped right in front of me
---
Nice one. He will remember that.
---
Finally a killer blinding a survivor.
---
as it is right now DS is an anti tunnel perk that is generally rarely used when the killer doesn‚Äôt tunnel. this was a case in which that doesn‚Äôt really apply due to the gate being open but nonetheless DS is a relatively weak perk against most killers and often times just leads to you spending a minute on the floor. 
---
also, both sides complain about both sides, welcome to reddit.
---
Well you were playing spirit
---
conflicts the entity‚Äôs 1 killer policy
---
Well fuck, that'll teach me to have hope in a halloween event on halloween.
---
*me when I see a baby jake*
---
Fantastic!
---
That knife is so pretty tho
---
I didn't say both sides don't complain I meant that usually only one side is the majority accepted one
---
And yes exactly it's an anti tunneling perk. So why is it 60 seconds? It could very well be 30-40 seconds at max.
---
Sure i post the pic üòÅ.
---
I run crop top hoodie with that headpiece but yours is pretty good too
---
Lol thats funny but also terrible. Hopefully it was no teabags and quick gens to make it painless.
---
Plague for an actual usable killer with good perks Clown for just perks or if you really want to challenge yourself with a 10 times weaker freddy
---
Xbox One. The last update made me lose the cat mask for the huntress. She was wearing it but it was not in my inventory, when I changed masks it was gone completely.
---
DS was only relevant in this clip because the ghostface hooked the survivor so close to the gate. Had he chosen to walk to a hook further away he could have simply slugged for duration of DS and then picked her up. I do see your point but you can‚Äôt ignore the ghostfaces mistakes up to the point we saw.
---
This is amazing! Really digging this one
---
Spirit literally gets scratch marks and noise unless she's using glasses. How is that any more info than literally being able to see survivors? You make the same amount of noise for everyone. You bleed the same amount for everyone. Wanna counter Spirit? Be less ballsy and predictable.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
No, the killer is still in this plane of existance. He might see me.
---
How so? Why do you think the devs are bad?
---
I love this!
---
It depends on play style. if you like ranged attacks and having debuffs on survivors, go plague. If you enjoying shutting chases down fast, then go clown. Beware though that a lot of people give him a bad rap for being boring and bad for some reason.
---
I‚Äôve had survivors say that my traps as trapper lagged onto them. I really couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around the logic of that. How? What? How?
---
I have both and I say plague for various reasons
---
"I'll take a potato chip.......... and EAT IT!"
---
It's filthy, I only saw some videos but I pray to god I'll never get this kind of match against Hag, give me a heart attack before attacking me, not the other way around üò≠
---
Right??  Like frankly, it‚Äôs not my fault you have McDonald‚Äôs WiFi
---
coding will always break, it‚Äôs just how many layers it has to break in order for us to see it
---
Lmfao That‚Äôs EXACTLY what they told me about my internet. Thats hilarious. Like okay, even if I did have mcdonalds internet I dont think traps do that.
---
Nah, im just going to sit in this locker until spine chill proks and I can guarentee that I don't move
---
Looks unique. All the Neas look the same these days
---
Who the fuck said they're cheating. Holy ahit. I'm saying if you use powerful shit then dont complain about powerful killers. Spirit is shit on constantly but she can deal with those windows in a jiffy. Idk how this argument is going in so many directions but it isnt my argument.
---
I always do, it is really effective. If you're doing a gen and the killer has pop, hiding in a locker will stop killer from knowing that gen has been worked on without checking
---
Don't forget killers and their addons they get complained about all the time. 
---
There are others but that ruin one is new to me. What's to complain about ruin?
---
I will never understand why they didn't moved the double BP event forward so that everyone expected to play the new event and battle pass in this week (people who maybe even got vacation, who knows) had at least something to do. That seemed like a perfect solution for me, I just don't get it.
---
And don't come up to me with the horseshit of "it wasn't announced", it was literally in the game files, it would have happened, no announcement needed.
---
I don't think it was that at all. more or less it's because you had a vial cap and dying is the fastest way to reset it. it created suicide strategies
---
Feels bad man
---
My bad. I roped your argument in with the other people who arent even arguing the same thing I'm arguing and I thought u were doing the same. It's true, you cant be mad not being able to catch someone with a killer who isnt equipped to do so. I'm just tired of playing a good killer and people complaining about it and dcing and saying they only see one killer but then i play someone mid or low tier and have every super bs window ran on me.
---
Idk some people just complain about it. I can understand people complaining about old nurse and spirit. Insta down hatchets and prayer beads are the most complained about addons and fair enough there pre broken.
---
Hah you mortals are funny.
---
I'm already on level 13 in the rift.
---
Insta hatchets are broken but prayer beads imo are fine. I like playing against them and I like playing with them. It gives the sense of horror the game needs. And I get the old nurse complaints but spirit is fine. She's powerful but again, there's good counter play and she's very hit or miss.
---
Yeah Hag is super underrated by most ppl
---
Whats the most common look for nea?
---
But if the killer doesn't come you just wasted time. Plus you get more points if you get into a chase
---
Huntress: Instead of throwing the hatchet the second it's possible, charge it sometimes because the survivor will start to panic and fuck the game up for you.
---
NooOooo ! it's Bill Murray  !
---
I smack 'em down and leave them on the ground for a second chance. Because they aren't going to learn if you let it happen.
---
Hahaha of course not. Nice job.
---
P3 Head hype T-Shirt and these white Pants. Pants cant variate tho. What i see the most is that or Pink head with Neon outfit
---
I said dying in addition to hooked later in the comment
---
And as it stands it promotes heavy camping and rewards it with a mori. 
---
And as an example since no one mentions camping until it happens so i used that comment as a fyi that camping is still bad and should be considered when making perks that would greatly benefit said campers. 
---
The way to play around DS is the same as playing around borrowed time which is to Not  tunnel a seemingly easy kill when said kill was Just unhooked. It's rude anyway. 
---
The exposure effect- to put it frankly is stupid from any stand point, after a hook that survivor is at their least productive state, Tossing an exposure status would make it as stupid as tombstone, Either you get on a gen while being 1shot and loud or you get healed to possibly be 1 shot once the killer finds you (which they most certainly will). 
---
And you're passing off a potential mori as a charity, Mori is a big deal, It takes time away from the killer picking up said player, going towards a nearby hook and hooking him. With a mori most of the time players get closer for the save only to realize that person is already dead/dying and you want that on top of that player being exposed?  
---
It was more about the "Totems can't be destroyed which removes points from the game" You didn't mention players would still earn the points since cleansing and destroying them are one in the same in all current builds of the game. That wouldn't be applicable to how cleansing currently works, correct. If all destroying effects proc perks/Lightbringer points it would work even though it would just increase the popularity of inner strength if they need it to start with (Especially inner strength as it essentially tells you where a free medikit is). 
---
It's also a permanent hex which is a bad concept to think of with the amount of addons killers have at their disposal, As long as they have moris and Iridescent addons I would add a way to destroy it such as "If all survivors are unaffected by Third seal it can be destroyed" 
---
And As for it it replaces ruin- No.
---
Third seal is more of a slow down of general information which slows the game down in a different way until someone decides to look for it. At best, A survivor hits stage two before she/he's found,  at worst it doesn't change anything whatsoever and they go back to ruin. 
---
Hex Ruin directly impacts generators, If you can't hit Great skill checks (Or your skill check pointer skips) They will have a very hard time completing a gen and if more than one person are failing it they will not make any meaningful progress.  They're both serving different purposes
---
I dont really blame them tho most of the cosmetics look... yeah.
---
Nice.
---
Pig deserves more nerfs
---
I've had hacks claimed on me so many times when I hear an injured person or something. Like so people not realize you can use your ears?
---
All the pin add ons are pretty useless don‚Äôt use them.
---
Yes. Although the noises are reduced, you can still hear them.
---
Every red-rank Survivor has an exhaustion perk, which will always get them to the loop.
---
‚ÄúEveryone is entitled to one good scare‚Äù
---
Looking fabulous.
---
i mean as long as it looks like tally marks it‚Äôs good, nice job tho:)
---
He's like the fusion of Myers and The Clown.
---
So there is a way to get out if a survivor is willing to help you. Basically they need to be injured and slow vault the pallet, if you quick attack (not lunge)  it should put you into the grabbing animation and place you on one side of the pallet. This bug used to happen all the time prior to the removal of pallet vacuum.
---
Who has a Halloween party before Halloween? That seems as bad as having an Halloween in-game Event after Halloween. üò¨
---
Would rather have something like Nea being corrupted by The Entity, glowing eyes and a smaller red stain, her power could be summoning entity spikes out of the ground to damage survivors. Could even have "a dark version of her perks". I could definitely see something like that happening when we start getting more lore
---
Thanks bud! Keep on doing what you're doing too, you look great!
---
So why should the killer be punished for someone dc'ing? It hurts them too. Blame the baby for dc'ing and not the killer for playing the game because more often than not people just dc because they got outplayed which isn't the fault of the killer. Im not saying it's not shit for survivors too of course, but it's not the killers fault either and punishing them won't fix it. In fact, if survivors knew it would punish a killer further then they would do it more often. 
---
When it comes to camping and tunnelling they still shouldn't dc. Yes it's a shit thing to go against but smart survivors will just bust out gens and make sure the killer only gets a 1k and thats what really hurts killers because they get hardly any points and a 1k. Killers play that way because too many survivors play into their hands, crowd around the hook waiting for a save, getting no work done and gifting the killer points and further kills.
---
Just get good noob
---
That a good to know Jesus I play for 1 year
---
After being unhooked you T pose and unable to interact with anything
---
PC - as killer - Big lag when the shape gets to the 3rd stage when chasing someone. (the screen fx lag it hard) as survivor - the same thing happens when we become exposed. 
---
Dead hard not working at all. 
---
PC dailies keep changing. dailies have only been killer dailies for me for awhile now. 
---
As killer in post game lobby - says host has disconnected- chat terminated? am I not the host? I'm still here.
---
Cosmetics are way too much. Battlepa$$e$ suck.
---
Has its ups and downs
---
Honestly it's a little *too* good on spirit to the point where I kinda feel bad, but a VERY fun alternative is Devour Hope, which you can partner with TOTH for what I feel is a pretty brutal and fun playstyle.
---
She is fine. Prayer Beads is a bit strong cause it has no drawback but otherwise, she‚Äôs fine imo. 
---
People only think she‚Äôs OP because she doesn‚Äôt give off the same amount of information when using her power within her TR. While I disagree with saying she‚Äôs OP or not, I do at least understand that while within her TR you have no feedback on what she‚Äôs trying to do. That doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs OP it just means you only have an unreliable method to know what she‚Äôs doing and she is soft checked by only two perks.
---
He sucks at killing (as a killer...) while it is piss easy to hurt survivors your skill does not help you finish em so its like you are playing a blank killer once surviors are hurt ...
---
Because they‚Äôre bad.
---
You know that making multiple game modes will only make queue times longer, right?
---
Borrowed time is active for 15 seconds because it buys you time to get to a loop regardless of whether you get hit or not. DS does not give the same power as the killer can just leave you on the ground in most cases without a worry, not a very good comparison.
---
I mean most killers I've played against pick me up as soon as I'm down.
---
Well i hate being sneaky so it dosent matter
---
This needs to be in the game!
---
If you use glitched in the title it automatically takes it down, try a different word.
---
Honestly, it's not too bad. It's kind of a meme tho.
---
Looks great
---
That guy is sex on legs and has a name.
---
Yeah its spirit, billy, freddy, gf, trapper. Theyre the popular ones i play against. Its like a special day when i get a legion, clown or hag
---
I‚Äôm so glad someone posted this. He‚Äôs actually been my most wanted licensed killer for the longest time.
---
Luckily we have some more survivor nerfs on the way.. God this game is a shit show.
---
If it's whenever they get the game working, it'll never be out then.
---
That‚Äôs really bold that you think people wouldn‚Äôt complain even with double BP.
---
Then take it up to the devs since the game itself encourages you to go for the 4k, and since there is only ranked play it also encourages you to go for meta perks.
---
You know there is something wrong with the game balance when playing to win is considered detrimental.
---
Maybe don't bundle a major content update with a timed event that happens once every year, realize you can't deliver on time, so unable release anything for the event
---
If you play drunk maybe the Floor does that
---
If I'm not mistaken, a DC does count as a ~~kill~~ death
---
Bet this lory was teabagging the whole game at every pallet and window
---
so that didnt happen..?
---
&gt;There had been many times where I went a through all three stages of the hook, and no one come for me
---
If the killer is camping thats the best option anyway. Granted that you can easily unhook against a Nurse since she can't instadown you but still.
---
My logical argument is that she's basically a ressurected mangled corpse so I don't think that would smell pleasant at all
---
DS plays pepeGA
---
It's pretty bad when your game is connected to a certain holiday and you can't get a game event ready in time for it.
---
Just a casual moment of using headon in a party. First time stunned someone twice in a row, omg? Yeah, absolutely the best move that ever was or ever will be.
---
*whe're
---
It's like that on Xbox too.  This game just came to Xbox Game Pass a few months ago so some friends started playing it but with the matchmaking change a few weeks ago (everything goes off of the highest ranked player in your group instead of an average) and the queue times being shit they've gone back to playing what they were playing before it was on Game Pass.  We were playing probably 3-4 nights a week and I don't think I've played 3-4 nights total with them since the matchmaking change.  It's unfortunate.
---
The Spirit phasewalked into my b-hole
---
My Turn is literally just bullshit Head On
---
&gt;IMO I think hitboxes suck, I mean when I play survivor every window vault I get hit and as killer, I seem to miss shots as Huntress when they should have hit. What's going on?
---
Hitboxes are exactly the same. The only change is how connection works. 
---
Also I found out that Huntress has a "new feature" with dedicated servers. A even bigger difference from what you see and what the killer sees. 
---
I went against a TTV the other day and one of my hatchets was precisely aimed at him over MacMilan loops with boxes. On my screen it was a perfectly placed shot while on his screen, the hatchet hit a box yet he still got injured by nothing.
---
When I see a Scoopy boi, I do bring my Mori toy!
---
I think there is a lot of shit on both sides tbh. Survivors have to deal with killers camping, tunneling, slugging etc. and killers have to deal with swfs flashlighting, teabagging, bodyblocking, Dstriking and so on.
---
The thing is, all of the above are legit strategies. Slugging or tunelling is not exploiting the game, it is doing literally what the killer is meant to do-kill he survivors...at the same time gen rushing or flashlighting is again, just trying to escape as a survivor. 
---
So we have all these people who have their own "ruleset" of what is toxic and what isn¬¥t, and then adjust it how it fits. Do I agree that tunelling sucks? Yeah, that¬¥s why I don¬¥t do it...and I hope survivors won¬¥t flashlight, Dstrike etc. me...but I can¬¥t get mad if they do because it¬¥s all simply game mechanics.
---
&gt;Huntress is broken af. Gettin hit by her through walls
---
There is a huge difference from what you see and what the killer sees. Even bigger difference from P2P for some reason. 
---
On your screen you don't actually know where the hatchet is going half the time.
---
I dont think so. I have never seen it
---
Fancy Face
---
It's not tunneling but if you have the slightest suspicion they have ds you can most definitely wait a little longer for the DS timer to run out.
---
You can literally stay in the locker the whole game and still get adrenaline heal lol. Noed is just a crutch perk that can give you a kill or two or nothing.
---
This would be a hit on P2P as well because the issue here is how pallet stuns works. If the killer puts the end of his lunge or even basic hit inside the pallet, dropping it will cause him to hit you a lot of the times (even if the distance was safe).
---
When you drop a pallet, the animation "sucks" the killers lunge towards the center of the pallet and also does the same with your hitbox, connecting his hit with your hitbox. Now, the problem is, the stun animation is delayed which causes stuff like this.
---
The way she's looking past the killer suggests that a greater villain stands behind him.
---
If it was decisive strike 1, it might have cooled down by then

10-4, I appreciate Monitor on Spirit. Sloppy is good too. Bamboozle works on nearly any character other than Nurse but it‚Äôs probably mitigated on Spirit if you‚Äôre mind gaming. Could always be even more OP and run NOED, lol.

Sure, no problem! So Obsessions are a mechanic triggered by some killer perks and some survivor perks, you can tell who the obsession is by the spider claws over their portrait in the bottom left corner. If no one (including the killer) has an obsession perk, no one has spider claws. An example of a killer obsession perk would be Save the Best For Last. This perk increases the killers basic attack speed every time they hit anyone other than the obsession and the killer loses attack speed if they do hit the obsession. A survivor version of a obsession perk would be Object Of Obsession. It lets the survivor see where the killer is by looking at them, however, the killer can also see you back if you both look at each other within a certain distance. It also make you the obsession. Hoped this explains obsessions for you a little better!
---
Does anyone ever really feel bad for a killer? By my experience this kind of outplay ends in gg ez and tbag, clicks at the gate
---
Can't see what the Lauri was doing before this ghost face decided to teabag though üòê
---
With bt you can still be chased and downed on the next hit, and also still have to mend yourself. You just want to down people right off the hook and put them right back on huh? Maybe they should just have first hook be death....
---
&gt;They'd have to be paying enough attention to see that they have the status effect though in time to know they can do so before the killer is on you, when 90% of the time you'll see it at the same time since the killer is already there.
---
I always expect Endurance when someone farms me so I am always ready to take a hit for the unhooker if possible.
---
Jane's two ass cheeks, larger than the tree

if you don't play with headphone the game is wayyy harder

Of course, because im always recording when i play casually with a friend ^^

&gt; the way it was supposed to be played?

that would be actually dope if devs make an official statement on "how are we supposed to play their game"
---
Nvidia GeForce experience instant replay. Like everyone else uses 3Head
---
You dont know how to take selfies?
---
Entity has to be pleased.
---
Beware of the 60 fps that allow you to actually hit those great/hex skill checks
---
If you got chased the entire match, you basically failed the main objective of "Evader Emblem", which would be completely losing the killer during a chase.
---
Evading and distracting the killer aren't the same thing and you shouldn't pip for doing just one thing the entire match just like your teammates won't pip purely for doing gens and escaping.
---
It surprises me that devs went out of their way to make sure people at least safety pipped for this.
---
Err.. tes you do as it pairs you with purple/red ranks cause matchmaking is busted. Ruin is mandatory once you reach treen ranks
---
&gt; Then take it up to the devs since the game itself encourages you to go for the 4k 
---
There's nothing inherently wrong with going for the 4k, just don't be a dick about it. And it's not my place to tell the devs what to do, i could express my concerns but i'm sure they already know about these problems. What I'm doing here is telling you and others to stop being a dick when you play the game and then maybe the devs won't have that much on their plate at once
---
&gt; since there is only ranked play it also encourages you to go for meta perks. 
---
What do you get out of ranks? nothing but a little color and "better" opponents that i know of. If you don't use meta perks you end up playing against people who either do the same, just aren't that good and might improve by meeting a better player without meta perks or you still do well and it never mattered that much.
---
&gt;You know there is something wrong with the game balance when playing to win is considered detrimental.
---
Right, because having fun isn't subjective. It's not as much about playing to win as it is being a dick when you play.
---
No! As killer you‚Äôre not supposed to stop teammates from rescuing others from hook! In fact, you‚Äôre not supposed to hook at all! Take it from a survivor main you‚Äôre TOTALLY not supposed to even chase us!!!!
---
I love her hair!
---
Uhm, nah? I'm playing casually, i wouldnt even use this if i knew it before

Little did they know, that was HG
---
I had enough about all this ass-kissing toward devs, when they want to grab some more money, cosmetics always went out on time, but on "free events" something always goes wrong and people get disapointed because it's delayed/and/or buggy either on PC and console. They never learning from their mistakes and people dare to say "they're humans" "people can make mistakes", when it happens several times in a row, you can't blame the human, you blame the poor team management.
---
Celebrating a victory too soon, no guaranteed. And DS saved him. The killer should not have teabagged you :/
---
Lol, I'm waiting in the lobby to complete my daily right now.
---
look how they massacred my boy :( (amazing work, 11/10)
---
Bloodhunts ruin DBD experience for as long as they last. It is almost impossible to find normal games during these times. 
---
If you play survivor you either get killers wanting to farm and forcing you to do it, making games extremely boring because most of them don't even know how to do it effectively or you get killers purposely using the most broken mechanics they have available just to make sure you don't get any points. 
---
If you play killer, you get survivors trying to farm, running at you and they even use names like "farm or DC" or survivors bringing 4 fully tuned toolboxes to make sure the match lasts as little as it can so they can safely focus on unhook / chase points.
---
Sorry for the shitty perspective. Was too hyped to fix it first.
---
Try iron will, alert, spine chill, and urban evasion. It's a great build for knowing where the killer is alot of the time so you know it's safe to work.
---
Just had 2 teammates dc after getting downed. So annoying  they ruin the game for everyone remaining. So selfish.
---
Just don't cleanse my devour hope
---
There is no such thing as almost infinite. It's infinite or it's finite. Stop whining
---
Which would only go back into the same cycle of people complaining about getting hyper sweaty matches because of double BP. Like there‚Äôs no pleasing people sure, no matter what happens, a group of people are gonna find something to complain about, I‚Äôd bet people would complain about only getting x2 BP if that were the case.
---
SJW warrior Nea
---
Using imaginary words doesn't even fall under wrong grammar anymore, you're just dumb if you do that. Keep on whiteknighting though.
---
Bet this killer was tunneling Laurie the whole game and finally caught her so tried to gloat
---
Yes i play solo all time and the first guy who gets downed leaves to 99%
---
Just letting you know I‚Äôm pretty sure  the huntress is free for pc as well
---
Spider-Man 2, I believe.
---
in that case i'm tryharding because the game sucks balls for everyone involved and i'd rather it end as soon as possible to get into a new one.  
---
I don't particularly want to chase the two of you around until one of you dies, then give the other the hatch when the game could end in 10% of that time and we could play an actual good game
---
A smartphone? Scream played when there were no smartphones. Not cool, dude.

DS works on pickup so you can‚Äôt juggle anymore.

is this a repost?
---
This is getting out of hand, now there are two MORE of them.
---
I didn't have bt or anything, but sacrificed myself to a Demogorgon so that the poor baby claudette could crawl out
---
This bug has been here since hag came out. I remember getting trapped endlessly.
---
Now that you mention it, she does
---
You take another chance.
---
But I thought the other guy said..... I am so confused
---
How? The hook was right there.
---
?
---
It‚Äôs basically god-mode at the late/end game. There‚Äôs not much you can do there besides Mori. 
---
As odd as it sounds, I‚Äôll eat everyone‚Äôs DS early if I can. Most players will use theirs during the early game and wonder why they still die and think the perk needs to be buffed and it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúDecisive‚Äù should have been a clear indication. I save it for death hook because when a killer comes for a repeat chase, they are pulled into thinking it‚Äôs an easy kill, but instead they come back a third time and catch a DS.
---
If you can't loop effectively, then you need to practice and learn to.
---
Does this post belong on the subreddit? No
---
Wha-
---
The chart says Nurse is the lowest on Xbox. It was released I believe shortly after Plague came out, which why she has some of the lowest kill rates (thought I personally think she has some significant weaknesses).
---
I still would like to see the whole game, because OP is not showing the whole picture.
---
tell me he DCed
---
Ash rework?
---
Tinkerer was permanent activated, if you had the perk on Level 2 and it conditions were triggered.
---
1. The more you are in the match, the more exp points you are getting
---
2. Ppl are giving you a free 1-2 hits sometimes for free bps
---
3. They are waiting for others
---
not when he Tbaging u :))
---
He probably knew she had it and there was literally nothing he could do to actually kill her aside from hoping she missed it. Might as well just have fun at that point.
---
Tbh that would be cool maybe difficult to implement tho.
---
Why ask if you have your own answer?
---
I disagree on the nurse part instant heals is bs weather you are survivor main or killer it wasnt fair in the first place.  Nurse is annoying but i wish if they gutted the spirit instead of her.
---
you can read her eyes : seems im fucked
---
If you press space and miss it, no, if you let it run out and don't hit space, yes.
---
Ik
---
Would be more effort than most but it'd be dope.
---
Looks like a Noed to me.
---
Which dlc?
---
Rank 9 and climbing. The hard games ARE the fun ones
---
Thanks ! I am planning on doing Freddy next ! :)
---
And then they freak out and run away and it's so so fun
---
I didnt trace, I used a grid on both my drawing and the reference :)
---
sometimes one of them changes randomly i had challenge to save 3 ppl from the hook at as bill i did it in match and when i check the dailys again it was changed to survive with nea with an item happens rarely to me
---
Being a prick is all you can do? Yeaaaaah okay
---
Seriously, any comments are appreciated. I don't see any other killers that play this way, so I don't know what it's like from my own perspective as a survivor.
---
I'm just disappointed in the lack of respect for the 4%... I've had to let people leave on with other 3 survivors to respect it. But on the bright side they said thanks afterwards
---
Im the one on the far right! We had an awesome time ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
What does that addon do. Im not an og player.
---
Ghostface,bubbas and myers are pretty balanced actually. Unless someone else lets myers get tier 3 off them
---
Why you smurfinü§î
---
Except dedicated servers haven't had an "official"  live release yet. They've said it's still in testing and it's assumed dedicated servers are supposed to have a proper release upon next patch, where they will come to PS4 and Xbox One too.
---
So then it's not bug free on the dev build.
---
Lol what a surprise
---
Ghostface will be as soon as the fix that wonky ass reveal system
---
Is your friend Ghost face or is he Tapp?
---
‚ÄûOoof‚Äú-Obama Care
---
I'm impressed you made it yourself, it looks incredible! Well done dude!
---
Closing chases with him is hard, I'll admit. I'm running ruin, PGW and discordance to give myself a chance. I'm honestly thinking a rework will come down the line and I'd be good with that.
---
Still, I like playing around with different killers, some aren't my style but I really like the tracking ability of his power. I really just need nurse's tier III now and I'll be good. 
---
I mean, real talk, sometimes I lose with top tier killers like Spirit too.
---
But they should know that their game is rarely bug free. It's ignorance otherwise.
---
35‚Ç¨ in Europe and in sale 15‚Ç¨
---
Maybe I quit Dead by Daylight when they come to my PS4
---
Clown should be bottom tier. Dude has maggots in his belly button.
---
Spirit shouldn't be on this list at all, since she's a ghost. She smells like spookyness.
---
Bubba should be top tier. He's a good boy, who always cleans himself up and dresses nicely for supper.
---
"visuality"
---
Id love it but whats his power come piggy
---
I hope you can get in touch with them
---
Its balanced because its a 4% chance?
---
The devs can get creative with his chains on his hands, use it as a long range whip or something. The mori can just be hIm ripping off someone‚Äôs head like in the actual outlast game
---
You may have just solved all my lagging DS skillchecks!
---
Thats.... Not a Scream...

#Thats a Holler

Not gonna lie, my mom made it. I dedicate this cosplay to all the moms out there *cue patriotic music*
---
What happens if he doesn't have any traps on hand? Does he just kinda pull it out of his ass? Because that would be hot no homo
---
Is this mildly lewd or am I just fucked up? (Amazing btw Entitty bless you)
---
If i see another killer post complaining about teabagging im going to lose my fucking mind.
---
Also,..
---
A Ghostface, A Legion and Freddy walk into a bar...
---
GHOSTFACE! HE'LL TEABAG WHEN YOUR DOWN AND THEN SEND A SALTY MESSAGE WHEN YOU ESCAPE!
---
Of course he does, where do you think Huntress store her hatchets ?
---
Vibe check Dweet
---
Stop, my penis can only get so erect
---
Pretty sure this is an exploit and it‚Äôs bannable
---
Its not difficult to understand that saying "versing" is easier on the tongue than saying "Playing against".
---
Yes its an abbriviation, changing the word to be shorter which "Verse" clearly is compared to its original "Versus" not mentioning again, how much easier it is to pronounce in conjunction with other words compared to just saying versus, and yes it does retain the same meaning, i dont get how it completly loses its meaning when its used in the same context.
---
I honestly dont understand why you are getting your knickers in a twist over someone not being correct with their wording, it honestly comes off as you are just trying to be pissy about him for the sake of it.
---
Also stop with the White knight obsession, not everyone is defending him because they are a fan, some are just doing it because you are being an asshole.
---
Hey...
---
*Pantless Myers*
---
Killer mains still crying over DS after its been nerfed to shit when theres noed and moris on there side.
---
I have 2k hours with 1k hours on both side. Ds is fine, noed is fine. 
---
I have one issue with each side
---
Insta heals for survivors which are getting nerfed.
---
And one hook moris for killers.
---
Well i guess spirit with prayer beads is pretty annoying as well.
---
*My first match, hiding from the killer:* "Ooh, this is so exciting! The suspense has me on the edge of my seat!"
---
*My first match, trying to hit a skillcheck:* \*panicked shrieking\*
---
it would be like removing fatalities from mortal kombat. it's kind of the theme of the game. the whole killer thing.
---
What a bitchface

Please don't demand to see my manager my shift finishes in 3 minutes I just wanna go home

Tru
---
&gt;Your main point is being a whiny bitch, why would I address it? It's like saying I'm not addressing a child who is throwing a tantrum about me not buying them candy.
---
Ad Hominem due to the lack of a good argument. 
---
&gt;Parity. It's easier/more cost effective for BHVR to release a patch for all systems at the same time, as opposed to creating a patch for PC, then waiting, then creating ones for consoles as well. You realize when patches are put through on console, some of them get approved faster than others, right?
---
No it isn't? Even if they waited until the patch was complete on all platforms, the original point I made (That you still ignore) is that theres no reason to not just release the PC patch right when it's ready. If every platform is ready, but some need to wait for certification while one doesn't then there is no reason to postpone the one that doesn't. 
---
&gt;Warehouses do this as well - they wait until their entire stock is in, THEN ship orders out all at once.
---
Yea thats not really relevant when talking about a digital product. 
---
&gt;As for your blanket statement - "the console position" implies that any and ALL people who play the game on console all think the same thing. 
---
No it doesn't. "Console position" is obviously refering to the position that consoles should get updates on the same day as PC.
---
&gt; Now, try acting like someone who isn't in their early teens, grow a fucking nut sack and a spine, and deal with the fact that patches get released on ALL systems, PC and otherwise, at the SAME GOD DAMN TIME. 
---
So angry. Yea you're definitely the mature one.
---
Using a crouch function is not rude no matter how much you children claim it to be. 
---
Try telling this to any person in real life. 
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so offended because this guy crouched in a video game!!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúWhat? You mean like he was given the ability to do‚Äù
---
‚ÄúYea!! So toxic right!?‚Äù
---
Looks like buff clown lol, that's a great game though
---
&gt;So if you look straight at the sky there are less pixels that need to be rendered and you get some more frame rate.
---
No wonder console peasants still are okay with 25fps, they don't even know how games work.
---
I play on PS4 and I find survivor games in less than 5 minutes every time i guess it just depends on where you live?
---
Nope, Dwight is dummy thicc in this
---
That is a silly description of something that has been a part of game culture longer than you seemingly have been alive. There are a lot of things that people do in real life that are rude because of how they are seen culturally, yeah if you ask someone outside of that culture they won't understand why its rude.
---
Head on is not OP, but it def isn‚Äôt weak IMO. Once the proper situation occurs where it can be used, you always have too respect it.
---
Can you read?
---
Then go look for someone else if you think they still have ds? 
---
Think about how great your map pressure would be if you had one guy on a hook and one guy slugged, then you end up finding another guy then theres one more survivor that has to try to be altruistic, no gens are getting done.
---
Instead youd rather go back for the guy that just got unhooked under 60 seconds ago, get ds'd then come and bitch about it on reddit.
---
If you like Legion, play Legion! I mainly play survivor and actually enjoy playing against Legion. Really just depends on personal preference, just play how you want and have fun.
---
"What's your favorite scary movie?"

Yup Bruce Campbell did the tutorial voices for Spider-Man 2 the video game lmao

---

---
That makes much more sense lol, I dont remember it being in the movies at all, and it does sound like audio from a video game
---
There are actually crows on every map if that's what you meant
---
Any picture with Dwight in it is lewd as far as I'm concerned
---
Nice
---
Ah thank you for this, is pop any good on her? I've heard it's a really good perk from many so I bought it in the shrine
---
DS is fair btw
---
Ignore the last comment, I asked if pop was any good. Just realised what pgtw is üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Quitting hurts the quitter more than it does anyone else, so I don't really understand it.
---
I bet you‚Äôre one of the people who think survivors t-bagging is so toxic too lmao
---
I know they‚Äôll never do it because it‚Äôs against their unwritten rules but I wish I could have a version of them with no mask especially Susie who I mainly play
---
I‚Äôm confused the downvoted say your wrong so does that mean it is for trash killers, or is it just hide fabled survivor mains who think that booking survivors should be out of the game?
---
&gt;Don‚Äôt play devils advocate here, you sound like a fucking idiot.
---
Pretty sure I don't give a fuck what you think I sound like, and I'm pretty sure this is just a video game you're getting so buttmad about. Cry more.
---
Why it‚Äôs always the back who has to get moried ? Jk :D nice cosplay !
---
You‚Äôll always deal with negative messages from time to time. My best advice is to learn how to rebuke their arguments, and to give your reasons as to why you didn‚Äôt save them.
---
That looks like the clown took one too many chemotherapy drugs.
---
Just ignore those messages, or shit talk them back like I do.
---
Just ignore the message? 
---
 If you're not wanting to turn off messages, then just ignore them. Delete them as they arrive, or even sarcastically reply with a GG. If you don't bite back, they get wound up more.
---
He's talking about specifically on the swamp, when anyone walks near the boat or the large dock, a murder of crows flies off and everyone on the map can hear it.
---
The killer can use it to find a survivor and the survivors can use it to know where the killer might be.
---
Look how they massacred my boy.
---
Dedicated server things
---
that's actually wrong, they're not adding the oblivious effect to that, they're adding the undetectable effect. which IS gonna remove his immunity to detection perks besides object.
---
I use the exact same build you are using, however I do want to swap out Nurse's for Discordance when I get it in my bloodweb. Knowing where multiple targets are is really valuable information.
---
It gives you 60 seconds of invincibility, that‚Äôs enough time to get fully healed, downed and grabbed by the killer, then you get a free escape. If the killer wants to hook you he needs to wait 60 seconds, killing all map pressure and flow of the game.
---
In conclusion DS is busted
---
I play killers that are fun to play and don‚Äôt force me to try hard all the time. So I main doctor because even when all the survivors escape I still get 30k bloodpoints with a black pip. Leatherface because it‚Äôs hilarious to basement camp with insidious and watch the salt flow in. I also recently picked up ghost face because it‚Äôs fun sneaking up on people and grabbing them off gens and stalking baby Dwights. I‚Äôve also seen a lot of high rank players play him without stalking and doing well because no red stain messes up the high rank survivors who rely on it to loop efficiently.
---
I why don‚Äôt we remove every survivor perk besides no Mither would that finally make you shut up
---
Tons of streamers on their tryhard mode always leaves people to hug defensive structures. Especially fungoose when he sees someone who knows what theyre doing and on the center structure just leave them. They're not doing anything useful after the gen inside is done and they need to leave sometime.
---
Atm i think it just part of the game with a workaround. They placed it there for a reason, they heard the complaints. If they change it good, otherwise thats all my input about it
---
found the guy in the video
---
No that's wrong. He didn't say that. Dwight is based on another employee of BHVR
---
Granny Ghostface, instead of a selfie Mori, just stuffs cookies in your mouth.
---
Jeff &amp; Jane ; Hold my beer.
---
You're literally defending a braindead britbong streamer who is obsessed with survivors' entitlement, get a hold of yourself.
---
&gt;(And Im guessing you like throwing out incel as well)
---
Nah, I am not a white girl tyvm.
---
You can still counter most insta downs tho
---
I'm kind of okay with bugs like these. For me anyway, they happen infrequently enough that they just lighten the mood a bit.
---
As a Kate main I feel this on a personal level. She straight goes Sinead O Connor at the gens
---
I just want the broken shit fixed dude. Can ya'll beat this horse anymore?
---
To be honest, I only ever get salty if my team has done something really stupid to throw the game.
---
They changed it but now it‚Äôs too easy to rank up.
---
Y‚Äôall get really butthurt over someone crouching. Wild

Why are perks not counter play? And personally I think she's fun to play against. It's challenging and scary especially if she has prayer beads. What's so bad about thinking that?

I don't see why not. Make the game free with Trapper, Billy and Wraith, maybe throw in Hag and Huntress like the version that came on consoles and just have more players to pad the queue's for existing players and more microtransaction sales from killers and survivors let alone cosmetics.

Because lets be honest if you are three years deep the price of entry is very unlikely to be the majority of your spending with all the chapter dlc.

It‚Äôs the same amount of pixels lmao. Wether you‚Äôre looking into the void or a highly detailed scene. You get better frame rates because of occlusion culling, removing assets and textures from the frame buffer.
---
Very cocky move shut down by a 4%. That‚Äôs was great.
---
You still need to unlock it via the bloodweb.
---
Well to be fair there is pumpkins in the background during the event (granted it won‚Äôt be halloween when it‚Äôs out so it won‚Äôt make much sense)
---
It's available to show up in your blood web now, it's not immediately unlocked and in your loadout. And it won't necessarily show up and the very first bloodweb you unlock, it might take a few as it's random like all other perks.
---
And the Demogorgon doesn't even have eyes lol
---
\-Pinhead sounds cool
---
\-Chucky sounds cool
---
\-We wont get anything from Jeepers Creepers (the director is a child predator)
---
\-I'm pretty sure the devs have said they don't want a killer to have that kind of "disguise" ability
---
\-Other than that, I'd love to see some representation from Stephen King's books
---
Same goes for a shining chapter.  That old naked lady in the tub.  I'd love being on the hook watching the mechanics of those bags of sand.
---
Papa Dwight looking swell.
---
That mori would be fucking sick
---
I like how all the money they make now is well spe.. nvm
---
They don't rip off any limbs in the game though so I dunno. I mean there is the clowns mori, but that's a pinky.  The demogorgons mori should decapitate someone, but it doesn't.
---
I looooove all the Ghostface stuff I‚Äôve been seeing recently. Great art, by the way. Keep it up!
---
I like how you doubled down on being ass, accidentally making his point for him.
---
Immersive Claudette talking about big dong?
---
You must be joking, we'll make it is godly.
---
If they let me get to second stage for no apparent reason I just wait until they‚Äôre 2 feet away from me and then let go of struggle
---
That isn't her final form
---
Cuz I thought it was a bug
---
I didn't hit space , but I missed it, I didn't let it run out.
---
&lt;3
---
I think making it just additional effects after a hook event without tokens is the way to go about it, like Pop Goes the Weasel, but I think the perk as you have it is incredibly bloated right now and needs a lot of fat trimmed off. Currently it does like 3 different things which is less than ideal
---
Legion is fun, just stab your way to victory
---
True, maybe just call you piggy and break your neck idk
---
Sounds like a good quote but I said it was mandatory in purple/red ranks not rank 20 where survivors don't know what a generator is
---
If you're not looking to absolutely dominate every game but have a lot of fun try out the Hag.  It's really fun trying to figure out new and interesting places to put her traps like before or after pallets so the Survivor runs into it during a chase, drops the pallet and thinks it's you so they vault the pallet right back into your arms. Also placing like four or five traps around a generator so they trigger them all at once and scare the shit out of themselves. She's got some great addons too that enhance her power.
---
Then that literally wouldn‚Äôt be the same as the 4% chance he‚Äôs talking about... your argument doesn‚Äôt make sense.
---
I feel like people always forget that DS got nerfed.  Love to see how the people who play against DS would react to playing against old school DS.
---
Would you have said that for a video about a toxic survivor getting their karma?
---
Well when there's an Object of Obsession and the rest bring all meta perks and flashlights it's safe to say that it's a swf
---
The people who main him typically dont.
---
I love this so much.
---
*We won't go without teabagging. The Legion can count on that.*
---
You people are really dumb, huh?  
---
There's literally nothing this ghostface could do about this situation.  
---
If he picks her up: DS  
---
Doesn't pick her up: She gets out  
---
So yeah, he's probably gonna teabag, cause that's literally all he can do about it.
---
thats be best thing i have ever seen in my life :O
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter, there are dedicated servers. You all clearly have awful connection to the servers
---
Name checks out
---
I know this isn't as impressive but I opened a mystery box on ghostface yesterday and got a 3 year anniversary Cake
---
It looks good and I love the idea of a modern game as a vintage comic.
---
I love when I run toward the chainsaw and they back up...like what lol
---
I feel like Myers should be right up there with GF, but only because I‚Äôm biased! Sweaty makes sense, though. Hahahah, love how you put this together. I also agree with another comment regarding Clowns stench.. He strikes me as quite literally cheesy.
---
Who cares? Its a game. If people this easily offended by an imaginary video game character squating up and down they got issues.
---
True... I‚Äôve only been running it cause rn my Steve is P1 and currently doesn‚Äôt have better perks.
---
A fucking ridiculous game mode where you can run any amount of perks that you want
---
I mean... Both of them literally require you to just press a button...
---
Deep wounds, hinders, prevents injury speed, stuns the killer, supresses terror radius, and these effects all change if the survivor has endurance when endurance should just completely stop it. What would be more interesting is a powerful strike that encourages you to actually leave the survivor alone after hitting them, like giving them an extreme version of Mangled (reduces healing speed received) and debuffing the speed that they repair generators at until healed (the chainsaw bros have add-ons that do this). There are enough perks right now that just make you better at straight up killin'
---
This is gold.
---
Okay good to know üëå, not sure if that was the problem though ü§î
---
You beat the game.
---
I bought legion, havent lost a single game while playing them
---
It's either you're a camper, a tunneler, or you should kill yourself, those are the only options with salty survivors
---
I‚Äôd like to complete this objective as well.
---
Haha, that grunt of frustration at the end was perfect.
---
I always wanted to see Benedict Baker as either a killer or a survivor. But having a killer created by the community sounds good. About the original killers, well, the latest original killers have been so disappointing to me. Legion and Plague are just no fun to play either with or against. For me the best original killer is still The Huntress. Her concept design and lore are amazing. I wish I could play as some of the killers without their masks on (I made a post about having unmasked killers as cosmetics but that's another topic).
---
I look like Eleven when I loose my wig while playing as Nancy
---
I suppose that may be true, but then either ignore them or down them. If you think you can't down them, just ignore them. What are they gonna do? Bodyblock you into hitting them? Sure, free hit, take it. Leave them on the floor for a time out. Think about what you did, buckaroo. Have fun. See you in 60 seconds.
---
Also all survivors have insta heals, but only Huntress has iris.
---
Yeah you can tell by the pants, cause the pants are variations on the pants that Frank and Julie wear usually, also Skemoo posted a render video that shows them off in more detail which shows their models more clearly.
---
Boobs boobs boobs boobs boobs boobs boobs
---
Jeez I just hook them. You know show no mercy
---
As a survivor main I REALLY love my insta heals but I know they are a little broken but in my personal opinion they are fun as fuck. But also insta down addons all mostly require skill to use on killers that dont have insta down secondaries like billy, bubba, and myers. I'm not concerned about insta downs more as to why billy and bubba are getting iridescent add ons DX that scares me
---
Iri needs aiming doesn't it?
---
The mice in hawkins lab
---
That is so neat! Well done.
---
5 BBQ stacks? I‚Äòm in
---
I was the survivor actually, I'm kinda new and he just stood over me hitting my downed body
---
Oh man, in my experience green ranks are the worst for campers
---
I see this idea a lot, and like to toy around with it. I really hope BHVR adds something like this eventually as it clearly has some demand. But as an idea that I don't hear that often, what if it was a special survivor that locked in during a que, that made their group of four survivors join another lobby and the "traitor survivor" has a power that depends on the normal killer, ie when with the hag they can draw traps and the hag can go to traps that trigger near the survivor. You'd have 110 movespeed and maybe some aura ability that let you and the killer see eachother. Then take two maps on the same (or similar) realm and attach them via an exit gate. The fact that the second killer queues as a survivor might mitigate some of the issues with long queues that could get worse if a two killer mode is introduced. And having 7 survivors rather than 8 would work better for balance imo
---
Too clown-like.
---
That is true, but there is a large number of players on PS4 never finding matches, at EVERY rank.
---
I think they mean posts that are like "hey, I got 4 iridescent shards. LOOK!" and of course people who've disconnected.
---
My fix to iri head; keep it the same but you can carry a max of 1 hatchet, does not stack with added hatchets. Easy fix for all.
---
Well it didn't last long. Due to some poor matchmaking I'm back down to 5. lol
---
OP is Tapp, his friend is Ghost Face. He said in a previous reply :)
---
That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm debating at all. I said that it *is* toxic to teabag. You‚Äôll have to find someone else if you wanna argue about whether you should be offended by it.
---
TY!
---
Prime example of some cheeky fun with SWF! Hope the Billy made some sort of a recovery afterwards
---
Hol up you ain‚Äôt thirteen? That ruins the point of my comments, mate.
---
But that‚Äòs more of a you problem  than a balance problem, isn‚Äòt it. 
---
Even the average player can insta down ppl quickly with iri heads
---
Who‚Äôs arguing with you? Learn to read
---
I am a black, so if you were to make fun of me you'd go to jail in most Western countries for hate speech. Stay mad white boi.
---
It's probably gonna be out on PC before this event. \^\^
---
Anonymity. 
---
No one would type that shit if their parents could see it, no matter the age.
---
4 + 4 + 4 = 12
---
I love this! &lt;3 Thank you for sharing.
---
Yeah but its not just a button. Youll still have to hit it or charge it up. 
---
It's "balanced" by the fact that it's only 1 ammo and the player needs to be accurate and aim well.
---
If you deeply regret buying this game why are you on a subreddit about it?
---
Pretty sure you're dumb, and a hater.
---
Done thru "custom match", where no one gets BP...its basically like a personal PTB.
---
Might wanna know WTF you're talking about before you run your mouth and stick your foot in it.
---
Why would you claim to be 7 years younger than you actually are and accept polite comments excusing your actions for being the age you faked being, mate? That ruins this very comment of yours point, lad!
---
Also bill finding when he finds a rock and grass
---
If you binge a bong you get high on the marijuanas
---
He is very different from clown, just cuz he‚Äôs tall and fat doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the same.
---
This cracked me up!
---
Havent had the chance to leave it yet. The memes are somewhat enjoyable too.
---
Sounds like your upset I know what I‚Äôm talking whether In a custom match is still bannable because it‚Äôs an exploit get off your high horse
---
So its next week?
---
Also them: wOw nIcE cAmPiNg
---
Knowing BHVR they‚Äôll bring back the book where when you get unhooked you keep being tethered back to the hook again as if you never left. The one that caused ridiculous lag spikes and completely broke the game for weeks.
---
‚ÄúWe delayed our event until November to ensure it worked perfectly‚Äù
---
Low skill is not a balancing factor. Every good game is balanced with having the best players in mind, some games even seek the advice of pro players or specifically look at the opinions of only the highest rank (which ofc would be hard to do in DbD as their ranking system is worthless). The point is: you do not balance for bad players.
---
Decisive strike deliverance unbreakable borrowtime YECH THATS NOT TOXIC
---
Nsfw pls i dont like saggy tits
---
I think that‚Äôs a great idea! I think all of the killers at this point are human except my favorite demogorgon so having a beast type killer would be amazing!
---
Why care about winning when there is no ranked reward anyways
---
I tremble in fear
---
Nope! He even got mori'd ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Discordance was recently in the shrine? Oh god that breaks my heart. That probably means it wont be in the shrine again for awhile and i need it
---
What so survivors get possessed and get thrown into the upside down for some time?
---
There's a game where one team attack and the other defend
---
Two games
---
Camping shack pallet :(
---
The term "Killer" has literally nothing to do with mercyfulness. Killer is the one who takes someone else's life, nothing more. Your meme is full of shit.
---
The game looks weird on a screen with those formats lol
---
I feel like new game modes would highly benefit the game. Make it random in lobbies or vote based with each match beforehand.
---
Yeah well saggy tits are tits too so tough shit. They come in all shapes and sags.
---
It's not a stream it's literally the devs saying "Hey sorry for the delay but the code is being finnicky in this new update so we won't release it until it's actually good."
---
Still, I don't like rn in a game like Dbd, where half of the game is based on luck. I get it, it's an asimmetrical game and stuff like that. But let's take the Trapper as an example. If you step in his trap you either escape on your first try or you can stay in that trap for the next 17 minutes. Or when you get the RTB off in your first attempt. Or ruin, where survivors either spawn on it, or it lasts the whole game.
---
*you're in violation of this subs rules, there's no salt, therefore not welcome*./s
---
+1 for wholesome post, seriously, this is adorbs.
---
Are you talking about the ping bar in bottom right corner when you're in a Survivor Lobby? Because I started noticing it a couple days ago on PS4.
---
I would enjoy this as a killer. He would be quite scary.
---
I bought the game today, went against a nurse, we did the gens, I went down, while my teammates all ditched me, the nurse carried me to the fog gate and let me go. Brought a tear to my eye ngl
---
Edgy hoodie boy... Isn‚Äôt that high school in a nutshell? :P
---
AD MORTEM INIMICUS!
---
At least it‚Äòs not ‚Äûslightly being damaged‚Äú
---
moderation, cost, security risks. they take the easy lane.
---
I was the generator
---
Yeah but itll be similar to house freddys ability sends them to sleep
---
wait did he quit?
---
Int3r4ct has [a fantastic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiG9MFjKJBY) breaking his power down and talking numbers about his add-ons and more! I really recommend it.
---
SURVIVOR MAIN FOUND
---
Special edition gives doctor and hag. Huntress is a free killer, always has been since release
---
i think the basement hooks not being "sabo-able" is balanced.
---
It's always such a disappointment.
---
Good call
---
Suppose to be a blood hunt during the event I'm pretty sure
---
Not officially, but he hasn't streamed dbd in like a month and admitted to playing a lot of Archage.
---
No. Just no.
---
I‚Äôve been discussing Pinhead a lot with my SWF buddies. I reckon he‚Äôd be a rad addition, and he fits in SO well. Chucky would be hilarious.. and I‚Äôm not sure how seriously I‚Äôd take him (if I‚Äôm being honest).
---
2v6 
---
8 players would be huge
---
I don't follow community posts.  Sorry.  I'm happy to learn the event is still taking place.
---
Yes! There will be an event offering that summons "blighted" hooks and generators, and whenever they get used you get awarded bonus bloodpoints after the match. You get bonus bloodpoints for interacting with these objects in general but you get way more if you toss in an offering.
---
This is adorable. 
---
*cries in loneliness*
---
how do you know what spookines smells like
---
Deliverance is situationally ridiculous especially when combined with DS. It means that hooking that survivor will generate 0 pressure which is a matter of winning and losing the early and midgame
---
Thank you. I need to go watch whatever this is now, because that IS the stuff of MY nightmares.
---
Trust me, I get what you mean (I‚Äôve been playing since a couple of days after release on PS4.) It‚Äôs just that you kind of need a solid team as a survivor or the game isn‚Äôt going to be as enjoyable.
---
I honestly didn‚Äôt start having fun until playing the doctor. I don‚Äôt even care if I kill anyone. Just running around and hearing them scream is so satisfying.
---
Side note: I do frequently get 3 and 4ks.
---
you need to   ***s t o p***
---
So you're "severely disappointed" but also not interested enough to look for just a second to see any halloween news? ...Because "spoilers"? *Hmmmmm.*
---
Kinda looks like his arm is broken
---
Gen tapping also works, it‚Äòs not faster though
---
Jane &gt; plastic
---
Oh dam it does
---
Thanks for explaining :) Appreciate it.
---
Let's start a petition to outlaw archage to bring panda back to dbd
---
Even the most expensive skins in DBD are still nearly $10 cheaper than the most expensive skins in Fortnite
---
Ooooooo dude get ready to get mori'd LOL
---
I got it! DS goes off if you‚Äôve been unhooked and then downed and picked up shortly after. Therefore what if the killer version made it so a second generator popping shortly after the first one just outright blows it up!
---
Mostly joking but I could see something like this working if it was like a one time use 25% regression or something.
---
I appreciate the sympathy. To deal with toxic people in game is really hard to do, it makes you mad when you are the killer. So it‚Äôs always good to give respect to the killer every once in a while. To deal with toxic players we use optimized builds that match our play style much like survivors do. I can‚Äôt speak for everyone here, but I try to make the game challenging and fun for survivors, so I understand why the toxicity is really infuriating when you are using a lvl 1 killer and the survivors are trolling you the whole way. The goal to dealing with toxicity is to show them no mercy, and keep calm. I‚Äôll give an example, I was getting gen rushed as demigorgon and they had one gen left so they were trolling by teabagging and slamming random pallets. I responded by putting two portals at each gen, one of them opened and one closed so when the survivors destroyed one I could go to the next one. It worked so well that I ended up sacrificing them all and I mori‚Äôed the last one. In summary I think we deal with toxicity, by staying calm, and in a sense being toxic.
---
Sincerely-
---
Killer main
---
I'm in
---
They can choose to hunt solo to compete or help each other to catch and kill survivors. I personally love the idea of hunting down survivors with a fellow friend or even a stranger. I'm ok with sharing my hunting territory and blood lust with other killer.
---
Jesus dude get a life.  Do you want me to whip myself for you? What a confrontational loser.
---
I felt bad bc the Killer got no blood points after for sure maxing out the chase points in a match. I was ready to give them the kill too as it was my second hook
---
Parents be like: you can have him, good luck
---
As if a group rendezvous in the basement wasn‚Äôt already unforgiving. Never seen the spikes either, and I‚Äôve been in since the beginning.
---
does reporting ingame actually work
---
Lmao Toxic survivor trying to blame killer xDDDDd
---
Killers are called KILLERS for a reason. Their job is to KILL.
---
Who has better perks then bran the broken?
---
Insidious bubba wont feel bad for u son
---
...You're welcome for proving the links, and exposing your craziness?
---
you run ruin and pop on spirit? I don't think she needs that much gen pressure tbh.
---
Nope. To file an official report you need to use the dbd website
---
I have escaped an iri huntress with noed before, yes you heard that right. iri huntress with noed
---
Still too strong, a good huntress doesnt miss
---
And that baby killer will become insidious bubba
---
Wasn‚Äôt super happy with last post I made in this so I figured I would use one of the alternative shots. I‚Äôm taking suggestions for other characters too!
---
What a sad person you are.
---
She is possessed, plain and simple.
---
Devs delayed the event and update due to game breaking bugs but it will still last the same amount of time - the dates have just been pushed back so that the game works during the event.
---
Yeah, when i‚Äôm in a lobby as survivor on console, i‚Äôve tested my internet‚Äôs speed when the ping‚Äôs really bad, and found that my internet‚Äôs fine, meaning that it is indeed the host‚Äôs bad connection. So like unless the servers are hella slow at the time, i doubt there are dedicated servers for console right now.
---
I think a better idea would be to just add in Deep Wounds. It's still technically a one hit down, but it's not instant and it synergizes well with the fact that you can snipe someone from across the map since they need to stop and Mend.
---
The Huntress is a great killer. I agree that they definitely need to up their game in terms of bringing out killers that are fun to play against. 
---
But I think that‚Äôs what would be great about a community contest. They could get an outside point of view, see what players want, etc.
---
Plus there are plenty of people out there with great ideas. 
---
To be honest, I‚Äôd love to see even a victim of the Salem Witch trials become a killer. Not sure how it‚Äôd pan out, but there‚Äôs so many tragedies in humanities history that the possibilities are endless.
---
Could make a survivor that was a war hero in World War 2, a killer that was part of the Catholic crusades, and the ideas go on and on. Of course the problem with this is that there are many killers and survivors that could be related to human history that could end up being quite controversial.
---
whats even the point then of there being an ingame report system?
---
Makes sense but i think doubling the numbers would be more fair. Imagine they both hunt down a survivor fast and suddenly it‚Äôs just a normal game with 2 killers instead of one. At least with 8 players you have more of a chance. Queues would be horrible with 8 though.
---
‚ÄúLook, we‚Äôre on Reddit‚Äù.
---
Nah, this is the most work anyone on this sub has done for their cosplays. Good on you, lad!
---
...?
---
feelings
---
Wrong sub bud
---
You still have to wait 60 sec and there's perks that counter slugging
---
Happy to hear. Thank you.
---
Iridescent addons are fun (usually. *stares at insta down hatchets*)
---
Yeah but  they should make it so you need to have both killers chasing different people because a 8 man toxic swf would be the end of the killers
---
Benedict baker would be more interesting(to me) as a killer because it would prove the whole ‚Äúsurvivors become killers when they‚Äôre tortured enough‚Äù thing.
---
So you aren't pressured by the end game collapse, and as a side benefit, it counters bloodwarden.
---
We need more support if this is going to work
---
It's pretty nice. Best head for Nea imo. Sweater is also pretty cool.
---
Ok guys this isn't actually me. Dang I just thought it was funny.
---
Love it
---
üíïüíñ
---
What about springtrap from fnaf? Or slender man? I could see both having some really cool powers and abilities! Slender man could have a passive power where the entire map is a lot darker and when the survivors look and him their camara angles are fixed!
---
Springtrap could have a better surveillance on generators and could hide in lockers, granting better stealth, and jump scares!
---
So the endgame doesnt start and you dont have timer pressure, And just in case the killer has blood warden
---
Bad day? Sorry if I made it worse, you just weren't making sense to me. :(
---
You know, it'd actually be pretty cool to have a 100% Movespeed killer who can phase through walls. I'd play that quite a bit.
---
Call it The Repeating Vapor or something like that.
---
Sounds like you guys are just farming at that point.
---
Unless one of your friends are already hooked after the last gen is completed. Usually if someone is hooked and we have to get the gates open, I‚Äôll 99% a gate and go rescue the survivor.
---
That way I don‚Äôt have to worry about the timer running out before everyone is safe, etc. Doesn‚Äôt always work out that way, but at least you don‚Äôt have to rescue the survivor and then stand by the gate and wait for it to open. Can just hit the switch and leave.
---
Yea but let's not pretend hitting a close range hatchet is that hard with a bit of patience.
---
My vote is on a victim of the Salem Witch trials. I think there‚Äôs a lot of possibilities for that one.
---
Even better
---
This shit happens with every video game ever. There is not one bug free game out there. I‚Äôm house testing can only catch so much considering there are not nearly as many people playing the game to catch them as there would be on live servers. Just look at the moonrise event. Does anyone really think that the event was busted when testing internally and they just decided to send it out like that? Probably not lol
---
Buy bubba next, you'll not believe how much easier your life is afterwards
---
Might be too similar to Hag
---
I'm not replying to you anymore. Go pick fights with someone with the same childish mentality as your own.
---
Yeah but if you're close ranged youre not different from other expose characters who also walk up to whack their targets.
---
I just want to see a Wendigo. Total fan of the concept...!
---
Killers are supposed to be more powerful than their counterparts. I don't think the matches would be overcrowded with 8 survivors, I guess. I don't know. It all comes down to finding a way to balance the game. But I can see your point.
---
Spirit only needs Shadowborn
---
Why
---
steve your scoops ahoy outfit is incomplete. please put on your hat. üòÇ
---
Its definitely a meme perk. You basically need to be in a swf to use it, cos its very hard to use solo. With the exception of DS, head on, inner strength, solo survivors are going to struggle to find value in it, and swf often soft throw the game because of head on. It's super fun though.
---
My vote is the big guy from Outlast the one that throws you off the balcony near the beginning
---
What makes me want to play a killer are two things, the killers power, and the overall aesthetic of the killer itself. If the perks are good it always helps too.
---
its probaly lag man and you can report them after the game but honestly even that video cant prove a lot considering our shitty support in ps4
---
&gt; pinky finger 
---
lmfao how do you even take yourself seriously holy shit. Do you crack up when you write this brain dead shit?
---
Bloody Party Streamers. It's an offering you burn at the beginning of the match that increases everyone's bloodpoint gains in all categories by 100%. This includes the killer.
---
I think everyone is this game is dead and in a limbo. If you read their bios, you can see a pattern. People go missing without leaving a body behind. The Trapper for example apparently died in a mine explosion, that's why his body is burned. I'm also adept to the theory that survivors eventually are drained out of hope, give up and become killers. I wonder if anyone will ever get out the Entity's realm and if they do, does that mean that they will regain life and rejoin the mortal plane of existence?
---
Instadown addons are a bit different. Instaheals just nullify all killer's hits while instadown addons just take away 1 survivors' chance for a mistake.
---
Like I said, it doesn‚Äôt always work. There are opportunities for it too, especially if you‚Äôre taking hits for your team and the first person injured opens the gate. That way you and the rest of your team have time to make your way over after the unhook.
---
It‚Äôs entirely situational. There have been times where I was screwed over by the gate being opened too early. Had a game the other day where the timer went out and I died after rescuing someone, of course this was also my fault because I forgot where the damn gates were.
---
Entirely situational. Doesn‚Äôt always work. Lol.
---
It would be cool if when he‚Äôs walking around you hear his chains like in the actual game
---
You followed my post history. You need help. That's Kat from Gravity Rush you moron, and Pokemon is beloved all around the world by all ages.  Go harass someone else you psycho. :D
---
If anything, this is proof that reddit is full of autists stalkers.
---
I would actually love to see the stats on how many survs escape against iri huntress, prayer beads spirit, etc. All the add-ons people say are OP. Very curious
---
Bubba is a mediocre Killer whose perks range from "Great" to "Godly".
---
- BBQ and Chili reveals the aura of every survivor outside of a 40m range, letting you know where they are (even if not revealed, you have a pretty good guess as to where they are). On top of that, it gives 25% bonus bloodpoints for each survivor hooked after the game (Max 100%), so farming is a lot less tedius.
---
- Knock Out prevents Survivors from seeing downed Survivors unless they're within a 16m range, allowing you to leave them on the ground without giving away your position. It's especially amazing on stealth killers like Ghostface since you can down someone and leave them without giving away any information; you could be 20m away and the Survivors won't have a clue.
---
- Franklin's Demise is the best Item Counter Killers have in the game, since hitting a Survivor forces them to drop whatever they were holding, and damaging it as well. Key? Medkit? Toolbox? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAYL5H46QnQ
---
That‚Äôs also true!
---
THIS. Trapper has insane potential that people don‚Äôt appreciate especially on some hell-loops like meat tree and the shack
---
Unrelated but do you sit sideways to your tv? How could you play that way? My neck would snapped off from turning so much
---
70%-80% survs are SWF? Seems legit
---
Has the Halloween sale started already or will it occur when the update comes out?
---
Except deep wound is effected by terror radius, so  you would have to leave the chase for it to start working wasting a little survivor time and your own.
---
Not according to what the devs said in the past. They said if they split the player base between game modes wait times would get even worse.
---
I agree imagine if even half the player base moved to another game modes...
---
And also making it random sucks for those who not intrested... surprise you got to play the game mode you don't want to...
---
Make a vote that makes no sense... join a lobby trigger a vote if everyone agrees you merge with a lobby who also voted? And wait for 2 killers who both want this? What a hot mess that would be.
---
Let's add into the fact the balancing of this game is a nightmare as it is... add in 2 killer kits working together I can hear the bitchin from killer mains and survivor mains now...
---
Don't get me wrong I love the idea but I don't think it works in this game this late in its life cycle... maybe if they do a sequel and build it into the game from the ground up.
---
I thought the Hag‚Äôs backstory was that she was persecuted for being a witch. I‚Äôm down for another witch killer. I just don‚Äôt want her to have Hexes as perks
---
Just noticed if he hadn't have taken it he might have had a chance of escaping
---
Is this really a quote from the movie?üòÇ
---
Id be fine if it was only 1 hatchet but stacking iri heads with an infantry belt is where it becomes a problem.
---
Insta-downs are the dumbest design concept for Add-Ons anyway.
---
To be honest I hoped they would going to switch some directions in that matter, the "common" Add-Ons of Wraith looked so interesting and rich of potential synergies that I played the living shit out of him just so I can have some fun with the new Add-Ons.
---
Especially, since UR's are sort of...Well. Extremely unbalanced overall. Not just for one side. They either give you an absolutely busted feature with a (more or less) massive cost. Best example would be Myers, the Fragrant Tuft is probably one of the best Add-Ons in the game, while the Tombstone sucks them donkeyballs so damn hard that even the Piece is more appealing to many people. Doctor's Iridescent King sucks balls, Huntress Iridescent Head is absolutely busted.
---
And then there is Plague...Plague is the best example of what happens when you give Killer a temporary, condition-tied extremely impactful abillity without binding them to Add-Ons. Half of her abillity revolves around benefitting from infected Survivors healing themselfes on the wells. However, Corrupted Purge is so damn broken and easy to hit, that literally none who plays with atleast some sort of thought would ever consider giving the Plague that much power.
---
There are some UR's that are quite interesting designed without being literally too broken, as they change the playstyle of the character in atleast a slight way, instead of giving them absurd conditions and even more absurd benefits :
---
"All Seing - Spirit" / Wraith - 
---
Allows the Wraith to see the Aura's of generators while cloaked. Since spotting Survivors on gens is one of his very few strengths anyway, but gives him some potential to work around gen stalling. Just like Whispers also a nice tool so you don't give attention to the wrong area's.
---
"Coxcombed Clapper" / Wraith -
---
To be honest, this is almost the perfect spot for Ultra Rare Add-On. Consistent Utillity that has to see some additional synergies or requierements (e.g The Game Map) to be used to its fullest potential. Very famous with the OP "The Ghost" common Add-On as it makes your approach almost unrecognizeable.
---
Ofcourse Wraith was never the best to begin with, once he would actually become good for whatever of a reason, the coxcombed clapper might be too much. But I personally thing that the Wraith's bell shouldn't give away sounds while cloaking anyway.
---
And then we have the Add-Ons that get broken immediately once the Killer actually sort of knows what they do, which would be the Fragrant Tuft, Iridiscent Head and especially the Redhead Pinky Finger (Clown). Almost condition-less and permanent exposal is simply too strong, regardless of how much hatchets you remove, the time of stalking requiered or whatsoever.
---
Exposal simply DOES NOT work for Add-Ons. It's either too strong and too consistent or too inconsistent and / or not worth being considered at all (poor Iri King). Give Killers some Utillity they can work and build around instead of the bullshit we currently have.
---
duhh lmao
---
You can run but you can't hide otz, I will find you and I will give you a hug.
---
That's kind of what happens when your response to problems with the game is just adding band-aid fix after band-aid fix.
---
Why would I waste my time taking something like Technician when I could take Decisive Strike and prevent being tunneled to oblivion.
---
But devs have said you need that ingame report too so they can tie it to the ticket.
---
I hope they don't vibe check me. I'm not vibin' today
---
For being a bloody shape you disgust us killer mains
---
Oh yes that is a big issue. There's no down side in using that right? 
---
They really should do something about that.
---
Yeah you need to do both. But simply an in-game report only does nothing.
---
Lol it's happened to me too. Forgetting where the gates are even though I 99'd them.
---
Yeah, would be pretty cool though.
---
I feel like you mainly draw female characters such as spirit and put a male character in a feminine pose
---
I know it's stupid and they have no excuse. Literally every other gaming platform allows it. They're just living in the past
---
That‚Äôd be cool as hell, imagine locking the door as a survivor then the killer just busting through the door while you‚Äôre locking it. It could work as an interrupt too. Maybe as Myers, his hand just busts through the door and grabs the survivors throat, then the rest of him walks through. As Leatherface, his chainsaw could be shoved through the door and hit the survivor. All of these interrupts would be unique to each killer, obviously. Maybe, since people can dodge things like weapons going through the doors in movies, there can be an extremely hard skill check for a survivor to dodge an interruption. These interruptions would happen while the survivors are closing the door silently (a rushed close would create a noise and be faster) and while they‚Äôre locking the door (always a fairly silent 2 second action, but can be heard by killer if they‚Äôre close enough). Like you said, just throwing out some random ideas that‚Äôll never happen.
---
i mean to be honest it fits him, he is freddy, he should be scary because he got super powers, other killers stalk and stuff but freddy should be like this because he have super powers abilities and that how he should be.

I didn't vote either way on the comment but if I would have I would have downvoted just cus I'm tired of people bitching about each other in this community and people bitching about people bitching. There's plenty of people here that just want to have fun and don't care if everyone is following a set of personalized rules. I'd rather their ideas be more visible
---
When you hook Adam you can see that real sharp fade he‚Äôs rocking underneath.
---
&gt;Somehow lost my Summer BBQ cosmetics (Free Bird for Kate and the Pro-Pain for Billy) and Trapper's Ornate Mask. Anyone had the same thing happen to them?
---
Happened to me a few weeks ago.
---
I opened a support ticket and got them back 36 hours later.
---
R6S Elite skins are about 5 dollars more expensive, the monetization model is the same except it also has paid loot boxes.
---
This just makes me think The Entity is Death and feeds off the hope of the dead. If you escape, which you can‚Äôt as death isn‚Äôt an escape, it‚Äôs just the beginning, you could rejoin the world of the living. But, everyone dies eventually and everyone is part of the entities game.
---
I need that much gen pressure. I always get gen rushers in my games for some reason
---
The biro I used doesnt show up in the picture and sharpie didnt work on the plaster, to answer your question.
---
ENTITY J I Z Z
---
Congrats!! Also, nice username. :)
---
You're giving the Survivors DW, forcing them to mend and then heal which wastes a ton of time on the Survivors end.
---
There's also the fact that Huntress' Terror Radius is 20m and her lullaby is 45m. People are going to be freaking out if they're trying to mend knowing you're close but not knowing where you're coming from.
---
Alright thanks, I should do that
---
I‚Äôd love to, Dead_Bear_King. Open your arms for me.
---
Ahh 2017 memes.
---
Matchmaking is currently worse than ever. Give me a laggy killer over a game that fails to start because someone is constantly dropping out because of dud-icated servers.
---
Hey it's a jack-o'-dwight
---
Well if there's gonna be bugs regardless, might as well release the update now
---
This happened 31 years ago. He pleaded guilty and served his time. He was boycoted by Hollywood and had his career cut short. He became a recluse. These are his words: "I‚Äôve been very upfront with the family. I‚Äôve been very upfront with everybody about what happened. I‚Äôve done my time. I‚Äôve paid restitution. I‚Äôve done everything possible." This may seem like it's not enough, but I don't see why we can't give him a second chance. Have you watched the first Jeepers Creepers movie and it's sequel? The guy created a horror icon.
---
They could‚Äôve just had people clear out for the picture. Don‚Äôt forget that this isn‚Äôt an actual selfie from the phone, someone is still taking the picture.
---
Ur hot
---
Plot twist: They are actually siblings.
---
No no. She got lost in a storm, fell, got knocked unconscious and was kidnapped by cannibals. Chained to the wall and eaten to the point where she was able to rip her arms free of the bindings.
---
And no, not at all. She doesn‚Äôt need to have hexes for perks.
---
I'm not denying that he made an iconic character but my point still stands.
---
Yup. Or why take something fun like Dark Devotion when NOED exist?
---
What does this have to do with dead by daylight? I don't understand.
---
Well shit now I feel even worse for mud mom.
---
My dad's a pedophile, so honestly I don't think I need to worry about him judging me...
---
Dumb question but, what category does my problem fall under for the support ticket? Technical issue?
---
once on PS4 I played against a bubba that was using a splinter (they were supposed to be a nurse) that was running over the allotted amount of perks...I know for sure bc they were running NOED (can‚Äôt use perks on a splinter) and the nurse they had set up wasn‚Äôt even running NOED in the first place
---
Rip panda
---
I hate when that happens. Lmao.
---
I always feel like the Benny hill theme is playing in the background while I‚Äôm circling the map.
---
He‚Äôs not wrong but also as a new player to this game. I search streams for how to play and nest builds and the top streamers at this time aren‚Äôt the most helpful. They seem to complain if it‚Äôs actually their fault if they do bad, they are a little toxic, and their streams aren‚Äôt very welcoming to new comers to the game with little to no help on best anything or what a new player should focus on. I literally watched the top two streams in this directory and neither gave a good impression. One ignored chat only spoke to his friends and the other tried to act positive but wasn‚Äôt really convincing and seemed to make excuses for his bad gameplay. I‚Äôm starting to regret buying the game because the only people streaming it seem üò¥ü§¨while doing so and do nothing but blame their team or game mechanics for their inability to do well at the moment. One streamer literally ignores his chat and only speaks to a few of his subsüôÑ. It‚Äôs not the best first impression of the community or the game.
---
Huntress is also only a 4.4 killer. Her chase potential is already less than most killers. Making her also give up on chases is detrimental.
---
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaah. Her story is pretty fucked up. I‚Äôm more sympathetic for her, than most of the killers. Couldn‚Äôt imagine having to watch people eat the skin they tore from my own body.
---
I do not blame her for going psycho and mustering them.
---
They are fixing "major" issues, where's the problem?
---
Ive done like 12 and still suck but the spirit definitely needs a nerf
---
You guys remember that bug where you could see Kate's hair on generator auras? Like you could see her hair through walls?
---
Totally didn't abuse that.
---
Oh. Thats why
---
Don't waste your breath trying to explain stuff to killer mains is like trying to talking to Norman Bates while he's in a trance. Impossible
---
I agree, spirit is a joke lmao. especially people playing with the purple n red add-ons aswell
---
well, i'd assume that it was being removed in exchange for the 0TR and such. because in the PTB, spine chill and premonition went off on myers whenever he was in tier 1. i'd assume the undetectable effect would change how t1 myers works

Who where you playing
---
Blood warden
---
I always bring doctor when 3 or 4 Claudette join the game with the massive terror radius to find them easily along with the mori because everytime they join the match they‚Äôll being the yamoka house
---
Yeah and the 2 hexes and tunnelling takes the cake with her also -.-
---
Ya girl got Hag to 35, meaning that it‚Äôs Hex: Ruin time. 
---
I‚Äôm also really happy with my Spirit because every time I unlock a new perk, she gets it in her next Blood Web.
---
They need to buff other killers before nerfing the spirit.
---
That's why no one uses it
---
Rumor has it you can still feel the warmth of their soul in the fog, as their cuddle brought them happiness, and peace, before eternal sleep.
---
gets really boring to play when all you play is vs spirits on rank 1 :/
---
Bruh stop complaining! I‚Äôm a killer main and I have get 4Ks against people running the DS, BT, Adrenaline, and Balanced landing build, 4 meta perks, if I can beat them with legion (one of the weakest killers) then I believe every killer is viable, I don‚Äôt get why so many killer mains complain about ‚Äúmeta perks‚Äù when the ones we have are much more broken than survivor perks, hex perks could get survivors really behind on stuff, especially if u have thrill of the hunt, while survivor perks will take only 10-15 sec of your time and that‚Äôs is if they are good, if u are really having a hard time against this perks, then I don‚Äôt know what to tell you, get better I guess
---
ü§°
---
So add the line 
---
- Trumps all other Add-ons
---
Must be nice I've gone through 20 blood webs and no pgtw
---
Lmao what
---
sorry I came out harsh on you, didnt mean to sound like a douche haha, just hate nurse
---
Pumpkinhead :) Stan Winston's guys working their creature magic
---
It‚Äôs like an actual scene from Scooby Doo
---
The devs have done literally nothing to the spirit since her release........... so why so much hate now?
---
It was in the files for ptb for the patch that's coming out. While I agree we shouldn't assume things until its actually out it was in the ptb
---
That's so sweet! Your mom did a great job!
---
*COD black ops zombies announcer voice* DOUBLE POINTS
---
He would make the Hag cry lol
---
Seems fine to me
---
Some good ol mockery never hurt anyone
---
That's the spirit
---
Ive always hated her .-.
---
It‚Äôs not broken tho, the game is good as it is, the only thing that‚Äôs broken is hitboxes and that‚Äôs pretty much it, everything else could be countered
---
I had a really shitty day yesterday at work so I fired up my switch this morning to play as Killer and decided to be super nice to my survivors. I played as the Doctor for a shock daily and only killed one of them for the BP in the late game and then opened the gate for them. Second game I played with Huntress and just chased them around and opened the gate for them, and a Claudette fast vaulted a bunch so I‚Äôd come over and let me hit her once. It made me happy to give people a bunch of BP
---
Actual cannibal Shia Lebeouf. Obvious choice.
---
When ghostie has no corrupt purge
---
Myers, clown, legion, ghostface, trapper, Billy, huntress, pig, plauge maybe? Idk
---
I agree though good old fashioned ones are good but we have a lot of both
---
4 times per trial
---
I see this a bunch and I love the game but I think The Walrider should be the killer
---
I didn't see it harsh dw lol
---
"Hello officer? Yes, niggas are in fact, wildin."
---
Tell that to my friend who has been playing for a month and a half, he still can‚Äôt loop for more than 10 to 15 seconds on average. Only times he lasts longer is on baby killers who are new. My group and I have tried to teach him how and show him vids but he hasn‚Äôt gotten any better. He still enjoys the game a lot though and likes playing with my group, it just takes him being really stealthy in order to survive
---
This is red ranks
---
I've finally gotten the last current survivor achievement and i only have 5 killer achievements to go :D
---
Riiiip. What were those survivors even doing?
---
And he's voiced on YT that's he doesn't have the inspiration to make vids that he used to. Which is too bad but real af
---
They even have deliverance decisive strike unbreakble borrowed time xDDD
---
Those pants make her look like she has a front butt.
---
The clown one isn't too bad tbh
---
Are you fucking serious?  It depletes the entire medi-kit and you still have to work through the blood web to get it. Soon we won't be able have any add ons. I often wonder if the devs even play their own game.
---
Iridescent king is great, don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about
---
Honestly I don't like when people write on people's steam profile
---
I wish I could man. The killer is near my spot. Leaving is my doom.
---
Nah lol.
---
2017 Pennywise
---
Walrider will have to be nerfed cuz he straight up destroyed a swat team and Chris walker without any problems
---
While I love Otz very much, and he has  a point to an extent, it's still up the each individual player if they want to have a knee-jerk reaction like this. At the end of the day, it's a game and you should play whatever you find fun and not worry so much about winning or losing.
---
Yeah it sucks to mess around with something like Mad Grit + Agitation + Iron Grasp and have 3 Gens pop in the first 2 minutes of the match and get only like 2 hooks total. But that doesn't mean that next match you need to just say fuck it and knee-jerk into running Omegablink Nurse with Ruin, NOED, Ebony Mori, etc.
---
Omg that was amazing
---
Playing survivor against other killers is easy. Nerf them too? No
---
I wish the main character from outlast was a character but he aint got no official face
---
That‚Äôs honestly a great build and you should keep it
---
I am not one of those individuals, but I remember having played with both yourself and Wyatt during one of my first games and having a good experience, so thank you for that.
---
Funny how you say this is red ranks yet you posted on this sub 6 days ago complaining that you‚Äôre a rank 18 Killer going up against green rank Survivors. 
---
How did you manage to climb up 14 ranks in less than a week? By doing this?
---
I love this too much!
---
That‚Äôs crazy, I‚Äôm surprised nobody thought to check the corners of the basement since you were playing leatherface. Especially after you hooked the second. But oh well, that‚Äôs their own fault.
---
That's not how I meant it don't twist words to suit your agenda. ffs
---
No one said that.
---
It's good
---
I once had someone tell the killer to die in a terrorist bombing like Manchester
---
It‚Äôs not lol
---
It's a typical build for Myers. It does the job all too well.
---
No lots of people have. Spirit doesn't need a nerf. Simple
---
Lol salty survivor xD
---
the withering dwight
---
Ikr idk how they ended up in red ranks
---
As their soul was no longer, they woke up, only to become worse than the Entity that had previously taken them away...
---
"No mom, it's not what it looks like. We're just acting out a scene from a video game."
---
Rattle me bones
---
Monique Heart tease
---
Did you just tell him to ‚Äúkill himself‚Äù because he asked if it was possible to use M&amp;K on console? Fuck is wrong with you?
---
DS but nobody is obsession? weird....
---
Disagree the spirit needs nerfing more than anything the nurse wasn't anywhere near a joke.
---
Here's my issue dude, I got nothing prestiged except doctor once. I'm rank 5 and have barely a full page of perks unlocked. In regular progression, XP doesn't keep up with the rates ranking does, so I either get matched against a fair team and have a good fun game, or I get to eat shit from over optimized try hards. There's nothing fun about having to eat shit to grind out my perks.
---
If you've been following his Twitter, you should have seen him posting about not having great mental health at the moment.
---
Just let the man do what he enjoys and rest and take care of himself for a while. I'm sure he'll be back once he's in a better place mentally.
---
Their flair obviously implies they're a Plague main
---
She does lmfao. Simple.
---
Certain survivors just get too scared and their hair turns invisible, such a sad condition called dragondese
---
Why? She can easily 4k.... great.... so can hillbilly
---
First person survivor it is then xD
---
You posted a picture of Nemesis and you don‚Äôt even know what game he‚Äôs from?
---
A month is really nothing depending on how often he plays. I'd say it took me about 300-400 hours to become proficient in looping.
---
Nice job! The toolbox is a great little touch. It‚Äôs cool seeing genderbent cosplays on the sub; I‚Äôm working on a Lady Ghostface now.
---
That build seems pretty decent. If you're running an extended Tier 3 addon, you might want to consider Infectious Fright instead of Ruin or Pop to help you snowball easier in Tier 3.
---
This is amazing üòÇüòÇ was playing dbd moments agp and the scream just mori-ed some people üòÇüòÇ
---
What's the point of playing then?
---
Cool! Can‚Äôt wait to see it you got my support!
---
Chris Walker. As long as you bring Miles and his missing fingers too
---
He relies on survivors letting him stalk them at least. They better not touch Daddy Myers. Least with Billy you have a potential instadown and potential map pressure. 
---
Only problem with Huntress is that she is ranged and can completely ignore pallets and window vaults if played well. Meanwhile you have to strut up to survivors as Michael to get a swing in.
---
I love that ‚Äûhi reddit‚Äú
---
I usually don't play enough to get in to the ranks where people think that far ahead :(
---
Crybaby killers.
---
The guy is bullshitting you lmao
---
The addons no longer use up the kit or reduce charges though.  Only the addon is lost when you use it. 
---
You can still run a kit+gel dressings for 2 health states and pop a syringe on it for an 8 second heal at no charge.  AND you get to keep the kit+dressings.
---
Oh, I know that feel. I‚Äôve been leveling my Huntress lately and she has shit for perks.
---
Where is Huntress?
---
Imagine camping in the basement as insidious Bubba on red ranks...
---
It's a mood by itself.
---
lol what, a 1 axe iri huntress is easily beatable by decent survivors, even if the huntress is top tier.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm definitely very skeptical of that being red ranks, but I don‚Äôt like to assume, and I don‚Äôt really care either lol.
---
Whatever, you are clearly a deeply jealous and spiteful person.
---
That goes without saying
---
Hello! Thank you!!
---
jdjdjjd this is so fucking cool you‚Äôre such a good artist
---
That is a ridiculous idea in my opinion. I survivor can just get unhooked and work on generators without any worry of getting hooked. The timer should stay in place but make it so when someone else gets hooked, the time goes away.
---
It‚Äôs not about the money. It‚Äôs about sending a message.
---
All I wanna know is why the fuck does she not have hair???
---
Im defending survivors..
---
Yeah. But I still think he would fit better being he has powers they can use
---
Question, whats your height and her height? Just wandering if she was hard to carry. Nice cosplay!
---
Shouldn't you prestige yourself? 
---
Nice outfit and toolbox. 
---
But usually the Nea's I meet have purple flashlights and self-kill on hook if they go down first. :(
---
As usual
---
I see you are a survivor main
---
Happy cake day! Yeah it really sucks, so I just resort to teabagging
---
Once as killer I found someone in a locker because their hair was outside the locker...
---
Ive already said why and not as easily as the spirit he still has to work hard for it.
---
This is cool
---
If the shitty devs didn‚Äôt put in movie characters the game would be dead.
---
Considering there was no obsession, I‚Äôm gonna assume you‚Äôre lying about the entire thing, which makes this post embarrassing.
---
Work hard?
---
See gen
---
M2
---
See survivor
---
Hook and repeat
---
I got used to it, what I don't get used to is my parrot messing up my skill checks
---
If you want glass to shred your ween all up, sure
---
Sureee
---
Just played against an infinite Tier 3 myeres, and i can safely say; I'm dcing when you use Infinite Myers :)
---
Dont tempt me with my kink
---
I hope so too, thank you! Good luck in the fog!
---
I‚Äôd use infectious fright instead BBQ but other then that it‚Äôs a strong build
---
Ur welcome :)
---
Didn't they actually buff her very early on so that you couldn't tell what direction she was coming from while haunting? I could swear they did.
---
How does that make the killers ‚ÄúOP‚Äù? You‚Äôre literally complaining about how they get rewarded bloodpoints when survivors dc. You‚Äôre not talking about how they are overpowered.
---
Now I want handsome jack as a Killer lol. And Maya or Zer0 as a survivor.
---
Killer power would be doppelg√§nger. Maya‚Äôs perks would be about healing and maybe one stun perk. Zero would be about hiding, and maybe a gen perk.
---
I am the girl. I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù and he is 5‚Äô10. I asked him if it was hard to carry me and he said no.
---
I just got it
---
looks great!
---
It is rank5 after rank reset my son
---
~~You should probably read more than just one post, as I addressed this further down in the thread~~
---
Oh sure. Increase the count to 3 at the least and it'd be worth the add-on.
---
I was the ruin totem
---
Highly doubt that lol
---
I would block you instantly.
---
Playing keyboard and mouse on xbox is classed as cheating by most players and even some developers
---
When your trying to show your friend a cursed image.
---
The fake pallets are by far the weaker of the two powers. It's really a matter of keeping pallet locations in mind. And then if you end up in chase while dreaming, be cautious when relying on pallets, focus more on heading to vault loops
---
Oof
---
&gt;Devs should COMPENSATE us for an event they are providing to us UNNECESSARILY as a fun project as an APOLOGY for not handing out a half-baked buggy mess
---
Am I reading this right? Jesus fucking christ it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm on the Archeage sub
---
At least an addon like Irisescent head still requires some skill to use
---
It punished him for slugging the downed survivor
---
The broken key is just an add-on holder really and it allows you to have some small benefits in the game for a limited time too
---
That is a cool style.... red ink with lots of etched in detail...
---
 Really cool way to represent Legion
---
How so? and lol sad that you have to dig on someones profile to find an arguement because you cant win the one youre in xD
---
Looks great! Should have added ketchup on his lips!

Iridescent Head: Requires a direct hit, forces you to be a ton more accurate without other addons as you only have one chance before being a 105% speed m1 killer...  
---
Redhead's Pinky Finger: Requires a direct hit with a bottle, and an immediate hit while they are still intoxicated, no large downsides compared to Iridescent Head, but still pretty hard to do...  
---
Fragrant Tuft Of Hair: Greatly increases the amount of stalking required to get to the one-shot status,  with a good swf, there will be 2-3 gens done before you can get this off.  
---
Insta-Heal: Fail a skill check to instantly heal 1 health state, or even completely heal someone who was just downed.
---
Imagine him whispering your survivor name in Chase's with you.
---
Lol you get the 4K and still get accused of teaming lol logic.
---
Damn baby Bills always fail their healing skill checks.
---
How do you get 50k BP in a game?
---
Im not repeating myself again
---
I can‚Äôt unsee that now
---
After the meg went down the best idea would have been to leave them
---
&gt; We desperately need a pass to bring perks up to speed.
---
Okay, I see your position now. tbh you could have done a better job saying this in your original comment.
---
Otz defined a problem - that people using strong things encourage other people to use strong things creating a meta where strong things that can be pretty unfun dominate.
---
Your response was to invoke the devs and game balance by talking about band-aid fixes, i.e., perks to address certain situations.
---
Then you tied this into a type of gameplay - tunneling which you prevent with DS.
---
So it looks like you were saying you couldn't run Alert because DS is the band-aid fix for a problem you see in the game, which is tunneling. And bringing in devs and band-aide fixes 100 percent implies a belief that they need to fix this base problem you have rather than just toss in DS
---
That's the thought process behind my comment so I think the downvotes I got were unwarranted
---
**EDIT** lol you fuckers are illiterate
---
&gt;Iri Heads get removed
---
"A soul for a... actually no you can just have that one for free fuck Iridescent Heads they're bullshit."
---
i just give you a heads up that you left your license plate in the picture
---
What's with the repost
---
I never noticed the ghost face! Japanese (I‚Äôm assuming) are always creative! I love it
---
Okay bo0b3
---
this looks so good, but fuck legion man lol
---
Hex: Generated Hair
---
Eachtime a Kate is on a generator, gain a stack. Each stack removes Kate's wig. Loss a stack when hooking a survivor. Hooking a Kate gives you her wig.
---
Yeah but the other half bitches whenever someone does it
---
actually such a dope style
---
What argument? Lol. I see you posting crap all the time (like this post) crying about the woes of being a survivor. Your swf is probably unbearable to listen to.
---
You get one devotion point and start with lvl 1 again.
---
Someone's early for the killer meeting
---
Still... It sucks. It's a green rarity item and it's garbage. It needs a buff if some kind.
---
Dudes just an attention seeker, you keep reposting this and there is no obsession so there is no ds pretty much proving you're like rank 20. You keep telling yourself its red ranks though haha.
---
Ah, the good ol‚Äô ‚ÄúI have nothing to say so I‚Äôm going to speak to you in a condescending tone‚Äù comeback. You sure got me.
---
The economy of a closed market is set up entirely by the market owners.
---
In short: since we can't sell perks on the Community Market it's entirely up to Behaviour how hard it is to get Bloodpoints.
---
&gt;Yeah flexing my economics education to insult video game developers. This is why I'm going to university. üòè
---
You gain 1 level of devotion and your level resets back to 1. Currently devotion does nothing.
---
What does the devotion point do?
---
played as freddy, and completely demolished a  4 man SWF. they got extremely salty and messaged me things like ‚Äúpussy killer, get good‚Äù. i came across the same team a few games later and destroyed them again as insidious bubba with an ebony :)
---
David!
---
90*
---
Broken keys are just shittier versions of maps (they need addons for the map part tho)
---
hell yeah !
---
it unlocks the ability to flex on nerds with no devotion level.
---
devotion 6 btw
---
Ya, because sloppy is only applied with normal attacks.
---
you cant carry 4 add ons..
---
OMG negan would be epic
---
Legion for discordance
---
Yes
---
She won't answer. She has no structure.
---
So it does nothing? After all the effort of trying to hit level 100 you get basically nothing
---
You get more shards per level but that‚Äôs it.
---
Lol he actually had chased me lost me and then followed my tracks to shack pallet, hence the heartbeat at the begining of the clip
---
I got an essential oil variety pack as a gift. Spookyness was one of them.
---
It pairs well with sandalwood.
---
I'm rank 1 and this happens all too often. Yet when I switch to killer.....
---
Fair enough lol
---
Fuck I laughed so hard I scared my cat
---
You don't get to keep the addon tho, you can find both of them in the blood web
---
Just so you know, you get more xp per day if you also play killer because you get a bonus for playing your first killer match each day and first survivor match each day
---
Boom, balanced.
---
Probably the sweetest thing I've seen here.   
---
Super happy for you two &lt;3
---
Same, that‚Äôs actually gonna help a decent amount lmao
---
Thank you!
---
You get instaheals the same way you get med kits. You don‚Äôt do anything special
---
And how are you expected to 'get good' after a 4K? Kill everyone *more*?
---
Imagine picking up a laurie, fucking idiot
---
That was BhVR putting their greedy hand out in the beginning of the month! It was very low of them to do, since the event was planned for the end of the month, that right there showed how greedy they are!
---
Asian Bill bowing to apologise made my day.
---
HA!! Laughed a little too hard on this :P
---
Already there sureeeee xDDDD
---
They took tape, then stuck the flashlight to your face.
---
i didn‚Äôt mean to come off as rude          üëâüëà
---
i once played a game as killer vs an swf group. After i won all 5 said gg, and they invited me to play survivor with them cause one of them was leaving. i legit couldn't believe it. i thought they were being sarcastic but indeed they wanted to play with me :)  
---
  That made me quite happy to be honest
---
I wanna smash
---
Huntress giving Bunny Feng a piggy back ride.
---
Theres literally no point of talking to you dude it's super clear you're not high rank lol. You also posted before complaining about facing green ranks, and theres no obsession which makes it clear it wouldn't be high ranks, so are you gonna keep lying to yourself?
---
The solution is simple. Make it an Ultra Rare Add-on to Instaheal.
---
Why don't they just set 
---
     Bugs==FALSE; else, NO bug
---
ffs have some patience
---
Enjoy your 8000 or so bloodpoints Bubba
---
Thanks, now I'm genuinely upset that isn't in the game.  
---
Hell, they could replace his knife with a broken champagne glass.
---
How does the game run on the Nintendo Switch?
---
Did you play a custom game at any point before hand?
---
r/nobodyasked
---
ok, but why waste killer pallet when you are in healthy state and legion use power?
---
Iri head combined with infantry belt is my main problem. 1 hatchet is fine, 3 is overkill.
---
Hi, looking back through old posts, I‚Äôm a few prestiged characters in and wanted to thank you for the use add ons advice!
---
Agreed
---
It‚Äôs always been like this on PS4, more people play survivor than killer because the FPS suck balls and BhVR still hasn‚Äôt optimized their game. Survivors at times can literally disappear in front of you. BhVR is more worried about getting those Halloween skins dumped out in the beginning of the month than fixing the game. Funny thing is, I haven‚Äôt seen one person yet with one, hmm wonder what happened there and maybe people finally saw bhvrs greedy hand reaching out and now we have a delayed event for those same skins...
---
Ye the same day y?
---
Me: scratching my arm
---
A skill check: exists
---
Me: slams my face into the keyboard hoping I hit spacebar
---
Skill check: ding!
---
Splinters are broken right now its a known bug.
---
&gt; cancerous perk and fuck any survivor who uses it
---
Decisive is literally an anti-tunnel perk. Don‚Äôt go after the same survivor you hooked and you‚Äôre rendering their perk useless.
---
I wasn‚Äôt. If you call looping at every pallet in the map and looping around windows trying to not die while the killer is on you TOXIC then I guess I was toxic. Sorry for looping him the whole game and barely dying when the doors are open.
---
Yes I am jealous that a braindead bong sits in front of his webcam for 12 hours a day and plays this shitty game for little kids.
---
They‚Äôre probably gonna take a look at that, eventually....one can hope!
---
If I ever have to pick up a survivor from under a pallet I survey the area before i do so to make sure no survivors are in the area.
---
No one is permitted to live when theyre in a game with me. I strive for true equality. All must die.
---
At this point, I'm pretty sure that ruin is just to help you locate the first survivor.
---
Don‚Äôt forget all the post talking about how entitled survivors are
---
How cool!
---
Got a lot of the more nuanced survivor achieves this week, including the crawl out the hatch achieve.  Only have one non-killer specific achieve left (hit people while carrying someone) and a couple non-survivor specific ones (whiffing to success, taking one for the team, grasp escape, and unhook self).  Coming up on finishing the achievements after 2 years off due to being tired of how long things were taking.
---
absolutely sick dude!
---
Platform you play on? Was like this for a few weeks on playstation but seems to be better now.
---
So so so many things need to be fixed. Iri heads, the massive maps that are borderline impossible for a killer to play, Haddonfield, moris, keys, 70% of the killers, so much shit.
---
Why do people post these? Do you not realise you're just as sad as he is?
---
Ds is no longer op due to the need if the killer is playing like a decent human being then they shouldn't have any trouble with it
---
I was gonna say!
---
people hate the idea of a new mode, idk why, perhaps they are just sweatlords and think this game wont die as soon as there is competition
---
I highly doubt ur skills too xD
---
Isn't that the point? Spirt's limbs are all twisted and bend ways they shouldn't.
---
Pretty well. Better in handheld mode for me. There‚Äôs a few lags but nothing game breaking
---
Is your arguement that its balanced because the blood web has to give it to you? Cuz i have 57 red instas on my feng, and you keep bringing up mikey so i have around 20 of both of his reds..
---
Pretty sure most of the ps4 population is little kids, so its best to not give a shit.
---
Just keep waiting man, it takes up to an hour for me sometimes.
---
*A lot
---
&gt;This is why the game is turning to shit because devs are listening to your whiny ass
---
The game is in one of the best states it's ever been in...
---
&gt;trying to get rid of things that dont need to be and have been in the game since the beginning
---
Go look up gameplay from when DbD first came out. If you think that was balanced there is no help for you. For reference, you could get a fast vault from all angles, killer shack had 2 windows and 1 door, there were spots where it was impossible to hit survivors, there was no bloodlust and no entity blocker, etc. 
---
&gt;stop being a sore loser and fucking understand how the game works.
---
How far up your own ass do you have to be to think that being able to completely reset a chase up to 4 times is a fair and balanced thing? I'm sorry that the game isnt the same cakewalk for survivors that it's been for the past 2 years. Get over it.
---
I think they are talking about addons, not about the power, because in the meme it says addons
---
They would increase her speed to 115, like the waterlogged shoe on Hag.
---
Almoat for sure, because her addons WILL be reworked some day.
---
kinda pay to lose since you get spotted from across the map, but awesome regardless!
---
*That is a Sweet Home Alabama moment right there*
---
I didn‚Äôt accuse him of cheating. He kept shaking his head and hitting me on hook so he kinda earned a DM. Tunnelling late game is understandable but it was pretty much all game
---
*Makes multiple valid points * "reee youre going against what im saying youre a. Cry baby sore loser!!!!"
---
It's funny how I get downvoted just because I dare to say that OP wasn't right. 
---
If you weren't teabagging, pointing or flashlight clicking or doing any other BM stuff and you were only running  away, then I can agree that what you showed in the clip is justice.
---
Or you can use Make Your choice, thats basically killer's DS..not as strong but it's very similar and you can also see when DS time runs out
---
Was that a jojo reference?
---
They changed it a little while back so it will only kill them when they try to escape if the trap was activated
---
Waterlogged shoe makes your speed 112.5 it's literally useless add on.
---
On the gas heaven map you can walk over something and it dings, it‚Äôs not loud enough to actually alert the killer but it‚Äôs something
---
It‚Äôs still better than we‚Äôll be right back and the lion sleep tonight, so it‚Äôs the way to go
---
I didn‚Äôt have a flashlight and I didn‚Äôt tbag at any of the pallets. He just got outplayed and got cocky when he downed me. Also, he had NOED too but we took out all the totems before the last gen popped so it never activated. That just goes to show that he was bigger trash than he let on.
---
They nerfed her traps when they implemented the End Game Collapse to only activate after a gen is completed. So if all gens are done and you place a trap, it will not activate and they can walk out the exit gate.
---
It's almost as if the power role needs... power? The only two killers with reliable instant down add ons are huntress and clown. Both of which have lengthy reload animations and conditions tied to those add ons. Make it so iri hatchets can't stack with infantry belt and it would be fine. If you can't dodge one hatchet you should play a different game.
---
Anyways. Calling them "equally busted" is disingenuous, but I've learned to expect this attitude on this subreddit. I'd be all for the game being completely fair if it was a 1 vs 1 game, and not 1 vs 4. I feel like you people keep forgetting that.
---
No, messaging someone to talk shit is never okay.
---
Lmao if I was that Freddy I would have just given up on life
---
2 health states for free is also a problem.
---
You sound like the type of person who thinks that Reverse Bear Traps are worthless because they don't get a Game Over very often.
---
Deep Wounds is there to force the Survivors to stop and mend or go down. It's a *stalling* mechanic and it greatly helps buy time if applied correctly, heck a lot of top tier streamers will go slightly out of their way to ensure Borrowed Time gets procced so that the Survivor can't instantly jump on a generator.
---
The Hatchets would still down in two hits. Deep Wounds on them would grant the Huntress more time for landing a single hit from across the way while also still allowing you to two hit someone at a distance. 
---
Also, I doubt you've gone to school for game design, so I don't know if you should really be the one to talk about if it's shitty design or not.
---
Lmao. Rainbow Six is scarier than this game. The horror aspect was lost a long time ago.
---
idk what to say aside from, try to prevent hatch escapes by slugging and also make the game last as long as possible. in my experience, though it might not be universal, a 15-20 minute game absolutely means a pip for me
---
How? Where have I posted proof I'm not? You clearly aren't and this video proves it cause people in red ranks would be using ds therefore there would be an obsession which you aren't even bright enough to know lol
---
Practice blinking, that's all you can do really
---
&gt;By the time infinite Myers has charged up, all but 1 generator is usually done. 
---
That really depends on the map and the addons in the second slot.
---
&gt;optimal ghost face doesn't actually stalk
---
Why not? His whole power is built around it. I'm not talking about what's optimal I'm talking specifically about killers who's powers are purpose built around instant downs.

I let the survivor who lives last, whether or not they're good or bad. Unless they're toxic, I don't have mercy for them.
---
DS definitely feels like a crutch when the exit gates are opened. I‚Äôve had it happen to me several times, and I just saw a thread yesterday about it. If you get unhooked at a hook near the exit door, you automatically escape. The killer doesn‚Äôt pick you up, you crawl out. They do, you DS them and walk out.
---
I love this so much!
---
He doesn't even have the camera just. Dudes just using flashlight app to blind Tapp. Karma is a bitch

i have escaped an iri huntress with  ***n o e d***  before

---
this is stunning! i'm so amazed, wow. üíñ
---
We take precaution, I heard it once from my friend who was new to the game, he became a sole survivor
---
maybe another variant of toolbox that makes you able to fix one pallet? although im not sure if it would be very balanced considering the god pallet is a thing.
---
Right but iridescent heads allows for instant downs. Which is the main focus of attacking huntress for that addon in particular while pretending that no other killer in the game doesn't have instant down capabilities. Hell, even trapper to a very minor extent has an instant down with his addons.
---
That‚Äôs when you put a bear trap on the other side of the pallet
---
Yes. Looks creepy, but in a good way.
---
Always the last survivor gets hatch, so long as they don't wiggle on the shoulder. Or, if they drop an item, I'll let a person go in a chase (but if I find them again, it's free game.)
---
Where's Adrenaline?
---
I wouldnt mind vibin with micheal tho üò≥
---
I promise I‚Äôm not on drugs
---
Nah, since they win without much effort they wouldn't sweat much
---
Where is dragondese
---
yeah because working hard for something means its instantly great and balanced
---
My totem spawn tends to be place within spitting distance of all 4 survivors. A good 10 seconds of Ruin
---
This actually made me laugh lol
---
Open portal?
---
man stop being a whiny cunt. god i hate survivors like this. they just want it all easy
---
I agree with how "cool" it would be, but it wouldn't really fit the horror aspect of it.
---
It‚Äôs true it‚Äôs too easy to rank up. I am a rank green level based on my skills but I keep getting to purple...which then I let down my team :(
---
I usually only let survivors go if someone dc‚Äôd early in the game; since I main legion, it happens way too much lmao. Also I usually always let rank 20s go, since matchmaking is now pairing them with rank 15 killers. Very cool.
---
Yeah i was assuming what OP said was true, but who really knows...?
---
When your first place a portal, it is closed. To have to travel to/from it to open it. 
---
Survivors also cannot see a portal that hasn't been opened yet.
---
Runn!!! Oh... I mean. Hastily wheel yourself and your eye brows away
---
How is me saying ‚Äúnice tunnelling‚Äù worse then getting tunnelled 3 gens, having the killer shake his head and then accuse me of cheating when I outplay him?
---
Im glad you came back ! :D. My pleasure
---
Wdym? This is just a picture of Nea tf?
---
yeah because pressing a button to save your life isnt too strong
---
That lady thicc
---
ash williams belongs on a whole other level imo. a true king
---
Well by defanition it is a "horror" game, doesn't mean it's scary, but I do think Negan whistling while carrying around Lucille would be badass.
---
**[gets gen rushed]**
---
Because it‚Äôs a game and it‚Äôs a waste of time to dm someone over it, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm going to say goodbye
---
No... he IS the game
---
who asked  and why
---
Good video. Terrible title.
---
oh thats just.. no.. just no
---
üëΩüî´
---
Maybe it‚Äôs your perk lineup? I‚Äôm really sorry about how you‚Äôre feeling; all I can recommend is maybe watch some strategy/game breakdown videos? I don‚Äôt know if you play survivor at all, but I didn‚Äôt until recently, and after I started, I noticed that my killer games are a lot more efficient- playing survivor a lot let‚Äôs you get into their head, you know? Anyway, good luck! Hope things settle out for you.
---
Dang ok
---
due to unfortseen circumstances, **fuck you**
---
jokes aside it got delayed. but its a good thing that we arent getting an event full of bugs
---
Gotcha thanks
---
No lol I had no idea where he was
---
Again, they're god damn annoying and I wish they weren't there, but they do take up a medkit and often people get hit becaese the use their insta heal.
---
They're strong, they're annoying, but they are also "very rare", single use and consume the whole item.
---
On Switch you have way more "free" killers, but the game's more expensive.
---
My answer: y.....no
---
The only thing i feel bad here for is the god pallet
---
Wow I thought this was just a reaction meme. I didn't know it was actually both of you! This just makes it twenty times more adorable than it already is.
---
I got harassed in the comment please do something about this guy
---
Here's my twitter for anyone who's interested, got a couple more renders over there.

Unless you want to be, like, a nurse main, she‚Äôs about to get reworked, so I would learn her after that patch. It‚Äôll save you a lot of muscle memory to be redone.

jokes aside this is very cool!!!! i love the arm in the bag and the colors are really nice :))) keep up the wicked work!
---
edit: listen i‚Äôm formatting on mobile trying my best
---
Legion can be made a mid tier killer easily with just number changes. Reduce fatigue to 3 seconds, missed swings take away 4 or 5 seconds from power instead of canceling, bring back old running and vault speed, lower duration of frenzy. Make some add ons that actually do something and boom, mid tier.
---
are you trying to say head on is bad you uncultured  ***s w i n e***
---
Mrs Kursh üòç
---
No, that‚Äôs death by blood loss not death by hand
---
Yesterday a survivor spawned right next to it because I sprinted across the map as legion right away to get to it and it was destroyed before I got there lmao
---
Okay.
---
S H O N K S
---
Hooks regenerate after a while, you can sabo all hooks except the basement hooks. Most people 99 hooks and wait until the killer downs someone to completely sabo the ones in the area.
---
Dammit to the bloody balls of rot gutted puss spewing hell... oh hi shirtless David!
---
Okay, I will cease my toxic experiment.
---
I've been working on my perks a lot since getting about rank 10.
---
My main is primarily Pig with BBQ, Surveillance, Pop Goes and NOED or Sloppy Butcher (depending how I'm feeling).
---
I did watch videos when I initially started getting invested, maybe I should go back and find some more advanced videos. I hadn't really considered that for some reason.
---
Also I did start playing survivor, maybe 1/10 of my games. But boy am I bad at it.
---
Yeah, if you play a killer that can extend the game like pig or doctor, you can get a pip if you get momentum. But lose ruin fast and lose gens fast and no chance to snowball.
---
I play for myself and for my survivor babies for whom I wanna put on a good show, and I just ignore the ones who act out. It takes a while to get used to but after a while you can tell which survivors you're playing a fun game of DbD with and which survivors are trying to pick on your nerves
---
you do realise that with the right medkit and another add on you can still get atleast one heal out of the medkit AND still use the insta heals. also "often people get hit because they use their insta heal" yeah which means they literally got saved by the insta heal.
---
Adrenaline is honestly the most annoying perk to face as a killer if you're having a game that goes to lategame.
---
Seeing 2 or 3 injured survivors instantly heal back up to full makes me want to just quit sometimes, especially if they're the only ones alive still. Most other survivor perks have at least _some_ form of counter-play (even if it's incredibly boring to do like slugging DS) but there isn't really much you can do against Adrenaline except run NOED and even then your totems can still get cleansed and you play without that perk slot for the whole game.
---
I get it's essentially playing with 3 perks the whole game but with powerful perks like Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Unbreakable, Decisive Strike, Head On, etc it's not like dropping a slot for Adrenaline lategame is really _that_ much of a disadvantage.
---
Thanks so much!¬†Yeah I thought to mark it NSFW¬†for the "totally baking soda on the table" and "totally a tobacco pipe on the table"
---
Also legion female and Myers
---
I was playing this game when my browser decided to pop this up.
---
That mindset is most likely the main reason for survivor salt.
---
It's more of a reference to the people that main them than the Killers themselves.
---
Jesus Christ, leave the man be
---
Im A KiLlEr MaIn. Haven't heard that before. Good way to copout of literally anything on this sub. Wanna tell how many hours you have while you're at it?
---
Oi! KOCHI WO MIRO
---
That'd be basically worthless. Deep wounds is a useless status.
---
Can you link which comment in particular? Because it mainly seems people were just asking you why you posted a 2 minute clip of insidious leatherface multiple times?
---
Holy shit that‚Äôs cool
---
why not? outlast x dbd crossover sounds great
---
They're not valid though lmfao. Cringe at the 'reee'.
---
Why am I turned on
---
I feel maybe both ruin and pop seems a little unnecessary maybe go with spirit fury or bamboozle to shorten loops
---
I just didnt see him say it either but my mans still tea bagged hard so whatever.
---
The game is in one of the best states it's ever been in... - lol next joke.
---
sorry for the poor editing, first time using a pc program :(
---
Hi, kind Rocko626! 
---
You can also use Rancor (which is one of Spirit‚Äôs perks) to complete the daily
---
Nea with a cock, the perfect organism.
---
You can do that without I head too.
---
and youve worked for it good for you?
---
Who is this?
---
Okay
---
Thats not an excuse for something to not be nerfed
---
i honestly wouldn‚Äôt recommend using ruin anymore, it‚Äôs almost kind of useless now, and takes up a perk space if it gets found early in the game, which. it usually does. though i‚Äôm saying this i wouldn‚Äôt know a good recommendation; maybe pop goes the weasel instead for better gen regression? like you said, it depends on what killer you‚Äôre playing.
---
No, don‚Äôt be stupid
---
Exactly
---
Thanks! :)
---
LOL, they actually did the same thing with Adam‚Äôs hair.

---
They're either stupid and think I'm saying you should do it, or they're bad and think having to down someone a fourth time is just so impossible. Some killers, like clown and trapper, can drastically reduce any distance they would get from the stun. And that's not even to mention spirit or nurse, who will behind you again in an instant.
---
If I‚Äôm not trying to rank up. That‚Äôs it
---
Many Ghostface players don't stalk because it takes forever and if you get broken out you've wasted a ton of time. Any hit cancels all that work. I personally don't like the slow heal tru3 build and use stealth with STBFL. My idea to buff the stalk playstyle would be to add checkpoint to his power in quarters and hits would knock his stalk down one checkpoint.
---
Its literally been next to my name for a year and sure is there a way of finding that out? :)
---
Oh don't worry, I'm a killer main so I do 100% know the pain.
---
&gt;"often people get hit because they use their insta heal" yeah which means they literally got saved by the insta heal.
---
You're thinking of people using the instaheal on theirselves, but you can also use it to, for example, get a downed survivor to healthy.
---
&gt;with the right medkit
---
If you take the right medkit, you not only lose a good addon, you additionally lose a good medkit.
---
And yes, I do realise all these things are annoying and prolong the survivor's life, but most of the time, they don't really do anything to influence the outcome of a match.
---
I'd like to see them gone, but I don't think they're too strong. Still strong and annoying, but nowhere near gamebreaking
---
Who tf is this streamer everyone makes meme about?
---
I'm a killer. LOL Also you're the whiny cunt now..
---
Yeah, killers don't really have a guaranteed way of slowing the gens. I usually opt for ruin and another slowing perk, like pop or thanatophobia.
---
Hide in a locker until someone gets hit.
---
Hard to find out when everyone DCs.
---
Survivor bad, killer good XD
---
Yeah like wtf can we use it for except maybe making the killer think we have a purple/red one lmao
---
Game actually has dedicated servers now... so it‚Äôs not on his connection anymore :/
---
You get great rewards the harder you work thats how it works you dont get special treatment cos 'waaaa they used a legitimate add on and took my self entitled kill.' No.
---
Otzdarva. Nice guy and a good killer. Dude has an incredible video about going vs a coordinated swf and it‚Äôs insane.
---
That‚Äôs not ‚Äúultra rare‚Äù at all. That‚Äôs stupidly common.
---
Besides your argument can even be extrapolated to Ebony Moris. Don‚Äôt nerf Ebony‚Äôs bc killers work super super hard to get them. 
---
Yeah ur argument is an omegalul
---
This is Neal cosplay. Simple
---
Wait why is the unbreakable icon colored?
---
If a single player receives enough reports, they automatically receive a temp ban. 
---
Report people when you need to.
---
You can't grab out of hatch any more
---
Hooks respawn after 3 minutes
---
Fatalities are used at the end of the match where as an Ebony Mori can be used near the beginning of the match.
---
A fatality is just a cool way to end the game for everyone where as a Mori ends it for 1 out of 5 players.
---
Bubba is literally wearing someone's face
---
r/cringe
---
Ahh I don‚Äôt play pig! (More accurately, I can‚Äôt play pig.) I doubt this will be of much help, but I stopped using NOED recently, and now usually like to run discordance in my builds, just helps with locating early in the game. 
---
And, oh yeah, I‚Äôm absolutely shit at survivor (kind of forced to play it with the horrendous wait times) but I figure it still helps a little with perspective. In addition to watching the breakdown of killer games, perhaps watch a few survivor games as well? So you don‚Äôt have to play survivor but can still get a feel for the behavior.
---
Man this idea is like Freddy but better, I like your thinking
---
so about your first point. a survivor using one on a downed survivor is even worse. because all the time you spent chasing that survivor became a waste. and if the survivor that insta healed was healthy, he/she will still have some time to get away.
---
and its not like the good medkits are lost forever. actually i think its literally possible to get a heal out of a brown medkit and still use the insta heal if you happen to be running the bandage add on which also happens to be brown
---
i recommend stranger things dlc
---
They literally have a rank system
---
The game is safe pallet city. If you know where the pallets are, you just run and drop every pallet, without even looping it and you still win if your team is doing gens. It's a good Hag map though.
---
Tbf the purple ones do look a lot more stylish.
---
Theres nothing wrong with ebony moris  either you get a game where someone has one thats tough shit they worked up the bloodweb and are allowed to use it just like insta heal dont be a baby expecting things to be changed to your liking.
---
Why do you think DS needs a rework? Also what do you think the rework should be?
---
Like the original reasoning was they didn‚Äôt have the license to Scream, only to the mask by funworld but now we‚Äôre getting the Scream outfit so I‚Äôm guessing that means the devs could theoretically give us Sidney down the line in a paragraph like ash, right?
---
Amazing!! The light really makes it look menacing! &lt;3
---
I think Deep Wounds is bad game design too, because you don't really have to do anything besides hitting m1 as survivor, for Beartraps you actually have to do something, going around the map searching Puzzleboxes. Yeah its good for slowing down the game, but you don't really need that much slowdown in the game, I would change Iri-Heads so they don't stack with extra Hatchets. It would be lazy design yeah but it could be pretty good for the moment.
---
I don;t think farm maps beside Rotten Fields are Billy friendly, loop aren;t too curvable.
---
DC rates would also be interesting lol
---
Yeah, I'm sure they are way more likely to change the Mori than just remove it.
---
2 hooks would at least make it so you can't just tunnel someone out of the game right off the bat.
---
Try out different builds and perks and see what works for you.
---
It's an air hose laying on the ground that old time gas stations used so when a car passes over it the air gets pushed into a small piston which hits a bell inside the station.

It's so they knew when to walk out and pump some gas or just welcome the customer
---
I‚Äôd probably switch out whispers with discordance? Then again, I never really got the hang of the effectiveness of whispers. I‚Äôm just really really fond of discordance.
---
Don‚Äôt forget all the post talking about how entitled killers are
---
Repost? Edit: my bad lmao nvm we good
---
yeah you should get great rewards for working hard, thats something i agree with. but you shouldnt get a broken ass add on that literally make you lose all your progress on chasing a survivor.
---
Lmao
---
I should not be laughing at this but I can't help myself it's not what you expect to read randomly.
---
Is sloppy noticable? I have a hard time following blood trails and never even bothered with it
---
No problem
---
It smells like a Halloween store
---
Plus it also ensures the player actually gets points and doesn't depip, like they would if they just moried and tunnelled everyone within 3 minutes
---
Thank you. Would be cool.
---
Not very polished but its possible.
---
I was thinking of that too or instead of that get nurses calling instead
---
Yeah, I did it wrong the last one.
---
The tiers were suposted to be "Steve" and "Not Steve" instead of "Steve" and "A"
---
Ok I'm going to try it soon
---
The Ideal fix was to instadown only through 20m away, so you need skill to use it properly, just like Pinky Finger.
---
When i use it, it's just to slow down the game a little.
---
Its happening to me on PC as well, before i didnt lag neither as surv, neither as killer after the dedicated servers, i do lag as killer indeed. But not as surv.
---
Why do you want the devs to make it easier to survive so bad? There‚Äôs already loads of killers the game is easy against. Spirit n ghost face are becoming the last challenges
---
The Nurse I feel moves pretty slow when she‚Äôs not blinking. Maybe he could have a power that reduces survivors movement speed?
---
ik, i wanted to buy it but its not on sale
---
I apologize on behalf of those abusing Ghost Toast.
---
You could use pop, ruin, enduring, spirit fury I guess
---
But the thing is it‚Äôs totally avoidable. I either eat the DS and resume the chase or wait 10 seconds. Odds are either another survivor will come up and you either get two slugs or you wait a bit and the survivor gets hooked anyways.
---
Also Bill got incredibly lucky in this situation, I think he 100% deserved to get out. Respect the Kobe.
---
If it only triggered within terror radius it wouldn‚Äôt solve anything really, and I think a minute at max level is a totally reasonable amount of time to expect a killer not to hook someone after they‚Äôve already been hooked.
---
I hear that the plays are wild sometimes but most of the time it‚Äôs not that detrimental to the match.
---
Ok I'll try it
---
He is a Spaniard who learned English from Irish friends. He tries to be wholesome and also to step outside the meta to play with somewhat undervalued perks.
---
That's the same case scenario like the Nurse, that's why I don't think iri head will be changed, because a good player will do good with her no mather what, and a not so good player won't get to hit all the hatchets as the survivors know how to juke.
---
PS: And to be honest, if a good Huntress always hit the hatchets, they will down you with 2 hatchets a bit later anyway if she doesnt have the addon. Iri Head for good players are just to save time, as she is slower than other killers. Same thing with Clown's Pinky Finger, it buys you time if you manage to hit the survivor. And if you are a good Clown, you can always slow the survivor to get that hit.
---
That's an interesting build I'll give it a try
---
Iri heads require you to actually be good with your character though.
---
Corrupt or ruin. Then Sloppy, Thanat,nurses
---
Tbh it does not seem like a rage quit looks like a connection error for him
---
*Her final form is insidious leatherface*
---
You cried about him "tunnelling" then called him dumbdumb which is something a 9 year old would say. Get a grip you sap!
---
DS was already reworked and its current state is fine. If you manage to save up your ds until the end of the game and manage to kobe and get picked up within those 60 seconds instead of the other survivor, then you deserve to survive. It's a strong perk but it's situational. A lot of times it won't even get triggered.
---
noooo no no no sweaty, dont let a rumor be your reality. look into it for yourself. dont believe a comment based on a possible comment.
---
Probably the increased frequency of swf teams. They're given a huge advantage that the developers never intended to be in the game which is why they don't include team chat in the first place. Since the swf remake on the last update they're definitely more frequently faced. I hover around Rank 10 to 12 and the amount of swf teams I face that absolutely stomp me is way more that it was when I started playing the game just two months ago. It is very frustrating I agree with you there. When I realize I'm facing one I have to severely lower my expectations and just force myself to be happy with a few hooks per game instead of two to three kills. But as many people have already stated there really is no solution to this problem unfortunately.
---
Actually if you at my history youll see I defend both sides if theres one killer thats OP a lot of killers are going to exploit it and ruin the experience just like they did with DS and Mettle of Man and they had to nerf them if you need me to name survivors too
---
Sometimes a survivor will do something that I think is cute, I mean like they know they‚Äôre dead and just stop and look up at me all innocent. I usually stare at them for a second and then slowly turn away and leave. It‚Äôs funny to me. Sometimes I will accept an item as a bribe, if the last survivor comes to me unafraid and gives me their item I‚Äôll usually let them go. Also, if I play pig and someone boops the snoot I might show them mercy at some point. 
---
I always try to play for fun if the other side isn‚Äôt sweating. Moments like this on both sides make me love this game and the community.
---
I bet he brought Left Behind and farmed his team.
---
They‚Äôre still getting my money. I don‚Äôt think my mean words are gonna change anything
---
Yeah lol it would have been hilarious if all 4 of you died right as you were about to escape.
---
He accused me of cheating- he is dumb. I‚Äôd have said much worse if I didn‚Äôt want to keep my PS4 account unbanned, you tool.
---
At what rank are you playing at if you don‚Äôt mind me asking
---
&gt; Or even infinite
---
Cool with me. I just hate that if someone has it they're basically invincible for 1 minute no matter what. Glad to see some people get it. :)
---
nearly impossible to find them both in a game.
---
shame to say, but I've never found one.
---
I use thrilling or pop, ruin, nurses and bbq and it works really well most of the time. Very basic but it does the job
---
Yeah, the to be continued meme was pretty big back then.
---
The sound when you die during the collapse sounded right after we walked through the gates so it was incredibly close. If I spent a second longer pointing at that trapper we would have died
---
Nah that seems like a connection error. Why would he rage quit after getting both of you?
---
I dont know how many clips i've seen saying "TOXIC GHOSTFACE GETS WHAT HE DESERVES" because the killer crouched once lmao
---
No, he will just follow the killer around and count how many of his teammates got killed or sacrificed.
---
The only perk he would use is Sole Survivor to help him count the kills with the tokens.
---
I personally watch ohmwreckers game play because he plays both survivor and killer rather well. I'm a survivor main and DONT run the meta perks except adrenaline (sometimes; depends how I'm feeling) just because it's not as much fun knowing theres hardly ever a killer skillful enough to defeat me and my swf team who have the meta perks. It doesn't make me weak but it does give me a different playstyle. I hope you dont give up! Once you've learned some different strategies on facing purple and red ranks you'll be on top of the games in no time.
---
Survivor i'm a 7 as a killer I'm 12 as i've hardly touched that side this season.
---
I did make a Survivor Concept for James a bit back
---
This does get me thinking though, what if they added them to hex totems?
---
Myers can‚Äôt throw his knife 50 feet and oneshot people.
---
You accused him of tunnelling. You're pathetic. And then you post it on hereüòÇ
---
it makes a good combo with thana since they heal much slower
---
Your telling me, if you had a dead by daylight pick up line used on you, you wouldn't accept?
---
I fucking would use the marry option right on the spot.
---
She looks like she‚Äôs from the future
---
This sub really needs to ban tier list post. They've been spammed 12 a day for a year. Map post got banned in 2 days and you at leat had to open MS paint or something for those.
---
Can we see it?
---
Finally a decent suggestion, I always lose track of kills and it‚Äôd be nice to also get a golden and dull machete on my kills and chases.

"And let's get to the numbers!"  
---
\*gets hooked by someone in a poorly made trapper costume\*
---
Yes because someone would definitely rage quit after hooking a survivor and downing one
---
You can always improve and get better. Don't give up hope, even the Entity doesn't want you to do that. Good luck in the Fog.
---
This sounds cool but what about the counter plays? Survivors should just accept their fate and die?
---
Yh you didn‚Äôt make him quit.most likely a crash or connection problem
---
Yeah glad you escaped but it would've been funny after all that you all die at the end. Image how happy, shocked the trapper would have been lol
---
At least a tool has a purpose.
---
For Killers id get leather face for BBQ and chili helps a lot finding people and doubles your blood points if you hook 4 people. Also his other two perks are useful as well. I'd get the Halloween pack as well cause Ds is one of the best survivor perks in the game. And Mike's fun to play if you get the ball rolling.  And dieing light and best for last can be really strong if you get enough stacks. If you want a super over powered killer go spirit just have head phones and chances are your gonna win. Also her perks arnt half bad either. Hallow grounds with ruin normally pays off well.  Spirit fury and enduring basically gives you a free hit. And rancor is like a better bitter murmmer.
---
I actually hate it when Killers do this. It makes me feel awkward as fuck being carried around on their shoulder for minutes. I always just wiggle so they hook me and I can get on to the next game. I'm trying to play and have fun, not just farm bloodpoints.
---
I agree
---
You played at red ranks? You‚Äôll see the counter play for spirit. It‚Äôs just mainly mind games. If you continue to rank up on both sides your gameplay will have to improve and you‚Äôll see how to optimize playing a killer like spirit thus learning her counter play by playing strong survivors. The only thing that really separates her from others is stridor. Cuz without it at a pallet it‚Äôs a guessing game for both of you
---

They should probably count dc's as deaths. If somebody doesnt want to play against bs add ons that much they probably weren't going to live anyways.

If they allowed michael to get all the way up to tier 3 they deserve to die
---
Golden chainsaw: Grants you 10/20/30% more bloodpoints upon surviving.
---
meh
---
Yeah, that's true. They could implement a map shroud that gets activated like freddy's dream thing, but it'd be the Silent Hill "other world" of course, maybe survivors slow down in it or their presence is much more easily alerted for the killer? He would have to have really long range with the Great Knife to make up for lack of speed, but I think it could actually work like that. I really wish they would do this, so badly lol
---
I guess you have never heard of the glorious Bodyblocker Hag?
---
"4 people died on the hooked. Including me because I was to busy following the killer and survivors around just to see how they died instead of doing generators. 1 male and 3 female survivors died making it a majority of females in-game... However the female characters that played are more probably played by men so... It might be a full male... But who knows!.
---
Anyway... This has been the Killcount! and I'll see you in the Next Match!"

Thanks! Xxxxxxxxxxxx

Why are you so cynical? Can you be like 50% less miserable?

"As we finally load in here's the map's TITLE CARD."

He chased me for 3 gens and was on me as soon as my team juked him and unhooked me, how isn‚Äôt that tunnelling? I posted it here because he accused me of lag switching when I dead harded you absolute moron.
---
LOL no we have two couches. I was sitting on the one facing the tv to take the pic. It was just easier to get Jethro and the TV in the pic together with him on that couch.
---
Pretty accurate except Myers would eat a raw dog
---
this guy has fake boobs, GIRLY PRETTY GLOSSY BLAh blah makeup, not makeup you barely notice in movies on men. this guy tries to act and talk like a woman, tries to look like a (gross) woman, probably thinks he is a woman, dresses like a woman. in my book its really the same thing as a trans, basically everything he is trying to accomplish is what trans try to accomplish but it can be hid by "its an act" excuse
---
if you were to put any man in a dress its considered cross dressing not trans. you arent giving them fake boobs, girly makeup and all the other crap, just clothing. those crazy scottish people can wear their signature attire its not like they are doing 5 extra steps to look like a woman. theres long nails and short nails, theres more masculine jewelry and more feminine jewelry, theres manly attitude and girly attitude, then theres big wobbly chest and not as big wobbly chest, the guy in the vid and trans are both trying to do the same thing here, they arent trying to wear some clothes they are trying to both act and look like a woman (boob)
---
also i find its very stupid people struggle to make it through life with "challenges" dealing with looking like someone else so you and everyone else knows you are what you want to be. god damn if you have a good job and can support yourself that should be enough, seems pretty "weird" having people so concerned about how they look to society and themselves that they sometimes freak out or kill themselves over it. and yes theres alot of weird people we already know that but theres different categories
---
I have been in red ranks shes still over powered.. You cant always counter them the buff that she can have on top of tunnelling. A freaking noob can kill them all shes that easy to play. Its actually quite boring how easy it is to use her and kill everyone.
---
I used to main trapper, and NOED works really really well on him, I noticed. People expect trappers to run it thought, to it‚Äôs a 50/50 win.

What does that even mean lol? He should‚Äôve just hooked her...

I think it depends on the ranks. I‚Äôve noticed Wraith seems easier to play against, the higher the rank you get.

What rank are you playing at?

Or a hearty can of

&gt;If they allowed michael to get all the way up to tier 3 they deserve to die

Sure...
---
But what if the survivors have brains?
---
I disagree I‚Äôve pipped and escaped plenty vs the spirit. Spirit forces me to actually play optimally and have my wits about me. This game is supposed to be tailored towards killers. Why the one killer it is for makes her op? What EXACTLY to the T makes her op?
---
&gt; brand new parts
---
flashlights are avoidable by looking at a wall and instaheals are about to get heavily nerfed so both these points are moot. If they jump in a locker they‚Äôre wasting time for their team and you can just leave them be or wait the timer out. It‚Äôs really not a challenging thing to comprehend.

---
Im not repeating again and billy isnt op you still need skill to control him where as the spirit you dont a noob can easily kill everyone with her and its practically impossible if they camp or tunnel she needs tuning down like every other character in the game. Theres strong but then theres down right overpowered and Im done with this topic its repetitive.
---
And legions mask doesn't have eye holes

Imagine needing noed on huntress

Ah no wonder, at super high ranks wraith is one of the worst killers to play as. Theres the rare few that are good but mostly wraiths get destroyed

Yeah the meme specifically isn't wrong, but there are similar things that are excused the same way and thats were they were trying to warn about the slippery slope. I've mostly been defending their view because this is an important issue, when either side encourage each other to try their absolute hardest and become sweaty to the point that no one, especially the new players, are gonna have any real fun. The game isn't about the ranks after all, it's just a way of trying to tell you how you did
---
And you aren't a dick for using Franklin's or getting a 4k. And you are also absolutely right that being a dick is subjective but there are things like taunting and being destructive to a single player's experience by camping or tunneling (not punishing them for unhooking in front of you, but actively ignoring chasing another survivor to go look for that one survivor instead) that are being a dick
---
Basically, when i say being a dick i mean avoiding 75% of your objective to kill that one survivor, or the other way around, ignoring your objective to survive just to let the killer see you teabag them instead of getting away. Part of the fun is challenging each other by playing to win, but then, as you say, the devs have added things that completely offset the balance of either side, especially powerful add ons but also moris. But there are also many who simply avoid using them with their absolute best combinations and instead use them to spice up the game a bit (this is specifically killers, some add ons add new effects at the cost of some other weakness which can be fun, but then there's combining them with something that completely offsets that weakness and suddenly you're just way too powerful for it to be fun for those you're against)
---
Incorrect use of a meme format? Really?
---
If the meme ends up being funny - who cares. If it isn't, probably no format would change it.
---
But then it's not anti tunneling, it's just a free escape from any time after you've been hooked.
---
It's so they purposefully activate DS and not have the killer slug them to wait out the DS timer of 60 seconds
---
Pc no que times are issues
---
Man that sucks. I love using Doctor haha. I love his stupid laugh too.
---
cuz the killer has no way to down and slug you then. they can either leave you or take you out and get DSed
---
He can find people with ease sure but then you have to uncloak which gives the survivors time to run some extra distance and he is very add on dependant as well if you want him to perform well at higher ranks and by the time people are at higher ranks they'll probably be able to spot a wraith without that much difficulty unless the wraith is standing completely still
---
Beerus would like to know your location.
---
Lots of killers will leave you on the ground when they think you have DS, so if you hop in a locker they need to pick you up and you are garunteed the DS.
---
I heard NOED used to not be a hex totem and only lasted for 2 minutes. Maybe they could bring that back?
---
i would recommend Ohtofu‚Äôs YouTube channel, he has a series of analyzing killers and survivors gameplay and how to play optimally. Some video are a little dated but the game sense he talks about are still very relevant and helped me a lot. I joined DBD around 2 months ago and I have 200 hours on the game now, hovering around rank 5 for both killer and survivor, but I believe I can climb higher with more playtime. Hope this is helpful for you, have a nice day.
---
Maybe because a cosmetic coming out isnt as complicated as one of the biggest updates the game is going to get?..
---
Make that 4 in a row. I‚Äôm even giving them bloody party streamers. I‚Äôm coming out with 4 bbq stacks + streamers with like 24k BP. -.-
---
This assumes that 1 survivor holds the same amount of power as the 1 killer, which is not true. 4 survivors equal 1 killer. When an add-on or mori disrupts that balance by eliminating a survivor from the match quickly, the game becomes very very lopsided. Unless a couple of generators, AT LEAST, are done by the time the first survivor dies, there is very little chance of escape aside from dumb luck or a bad killer player. Losing a single survivor is a HUGE crippling factor for a survivor team.
---
I quite agree that a good balance would be to make it so that iri hatchets don't stack with infantry belt. But for the most part, just about every ultra rare add on, item, and offering in the game (for both sides) should be removed, because they are all gimmicky and unbalanced, and usually cheapen matches.
---
Tbh i‚Äôve actually had success with Doctor in red ranks, you‚Äôve just gotta play like a dick. 
---
Ruin/sloppy/thanta/dying light, if they haven‚Äôt got med kids there fucked.
---
I like to imagine Bills are always actual old veteran men playing.
---
They might suck, but dammit, they WILL sacrifice their lives to get you of that hook.
---
Then why wasn‚Äôt the OG robe added to begin with? Like that‚Äôs obviously what the fans initially wanted
---
So were you being intentionally wrong when you claimed I‚Äôm upset I got caught or are you just that stupid? Either way you‚Äôre not contributing anything useful here you clown. Why are you so triggered about something you gave nothing to do with?
---
For ghost you'll probably want more perks that'll give you information discordance or surveillance Shadow is good for that too so you can get good stalk time and sneak around. Fire it up or bambozzle can help during chase if you trick the survivor by vaulting a window
---
Lol thank you! I‚Äôm so happy I commented on this because I go to red ranks and it‚Äôs really nice knowing that i can have this little safety net since I don‚Äôt usually get hooked until we‚Äôre a little closer to the end.
---
Btw I have no idea why I‚Äôm getting downvoted by people for asking genuine question but alright salty people. Just know this is why people are always fighting. When you try to understand both sides perspectives, one side isn‚Äôt ok with the other being understood üòÇ
---
Yeah this isn't overpowered at all ....
---
What killer are you playing I know I do that with killers I just don't have fun playing against mainly just nurse and hag
---
Yeah that makes sense for sure. It‚Äôs a bummer, too, because I think he‚Äôs a fun character to use and I wish all killers were more equally balanced so you don‚Äôt always see the same ones being used. You‚Äôre right, though, that his add-ons do help him a lot and he‚Äôd be much weaker without them.
---
This sub sucks _so much_ but it's still unfortunately the best place for easy viewing of DbD content and discussion. I just wanna see good discussion about the game or interesting fanart or cool cosplays or impressive clips. But it's just shitty memes and reposts 90% of the time. And by "memes" I mean a picture of _literally anything_ but with a DbD-related title. I wish the mods removed more of those posts, they get to the front page so often it's unreal.
---
Spirit run all three of the nurse perks with sloppy butcher. You can take out nurses calling for dying light or pop goes the weasel. For ghostface I like a antiheal build with sloppy, thana, nurses, and dying light.
---
Hey don't judge that persons face, they could smell really nice ya never know
---
It's only gay if you want to fuck Frank or Joey
---
Sure thing kid :)
---
The thing that annoys me aswell is that people keep posting mediocore plays.
---
Like i dont care if you Used head on for the first time and then pallet stunned him.
---
This is something that everyone has experienced,
---
thats nothing that is worth to be posted.
---
I found a baby Dweet and had a team of higher rank players who made a handful of massive mistakes and ended up having all three of them struggling in my basement.
---
I found the baby Dweet and carried him to the hatch. He said it was the first hatch he had left though.
---
That felt pretty good.
---
Wow thanks. That was very informative. Is there a reason why they couldn‚Äôt get direct licensing from the scream franchise?  And is this also the reason why Laurie Strode doesn‚Äôt look like Jamie Lee Curtis?
---
What are u saying that is different from what Slapped just said lol
---
I can say the same thing again. The Ghost Face Halloween costume, not an appearance from Scream is being added in November. I need you to please take a really good look at the render and remind yourself which license bhvr received Ghost Face from.
---
Yeah your right, the smell alone is probably enough to make survivors wanna gag let alone being infected and sick lol
---
I didn‚Äôt have this problem as legion. In fact I double pip‚Äôd a lot of games
---
I love putting traps on survivors, hooking them and then letting them be freed after a gen is done to activate the trap. Then I use bitter murmur to ambush those that completed the gen, trap them, and repeat. I also use add ons to give me more traps and make the timer go quicker and I get quite a lot of trap kills. Surveillance is great too especially when the survs 3 gen themselves. I also use nurses calling to ambush.
---
I know, but killer also loses his addons no matter what, which cost bloodpoints. This is just a hunch why survivors would have to work for the stacks. Personally to me WGLF is fine, but I wouldn't complain if it got buffed.
---
Great job!
---
*^yet*
---
I think I‚Äôve been pretty rational. I‚Äôve offered counterplay and logic, opposed to you reducing to belittling and complaining. I think the ‚Äúrational‚Äù players youre looking for are fellow survivor mains who get rekt by spirit. Every killer has been nerfed except spirit. Of course she‚Äôs going to look strong cuz she‚Äôs the last KILLER to actually have a real fear factor about surviving. Which is the point of this game no? Or would you prefer the power and fear to be in hands of the survivors?
---
On Ghostface I'm currently using surveillance, pop, I'm all ears and spies from the Shadows. It works great. Lots of information and one to slow down generators.
---
where‚Äôs the flashlight -_-
---
I didn‚Äôt have one on hand so I went with the toolbox instead.
---
The teleportation is the main part of the power to help mobility. A cooldown between teleporting would probably be a bit better, similar to freddy's ability.
---
Aura detection could be a good very rare add on for the power.
---
It's legion, don't feel bad for them
---
Yeah that'll happen probably at lower ranks since they don't know how to juke against it I wouldn't know what you could do unless you let them go once on purpose and get them later
---
Thanks for the support!
---
YOU JAKE
---
YOU SABO HOOK
---
Thanks glad to hear you like it&lt;3
---
The classic skin is legitimately the Halloween costume you would find at a retail store or amazon. I believe some people don't notice the subtle differences between that and what the robes in the Scream films look like, because there are plenty of differences.
---
Something to slow down early game 
---
One for traps
---
One for pallets 
---
One for tracking
---
One of your choice to make one of the categories above better
---
Or you could meme and do all generator regression perks
---
Or all hex perks and trap all of them
---
But there's only 10 you can deny and you spent loads of time travelling the map. Like I said
---
Survs with brains.
---
My thought process as surv there: ah, bodyblocker. I'll pop as many traps as possible without being in a Chase, and direct my swf to do gens.
---
Fuck this is great
---
Mediocre my *ass*! I love this!
---
Yeah, I love when they trigger the stealth, no illusion trap on a generator and then I snatch em off.  
---
End game chat was like "You near made me pee myself."
---
We'll see when she gets nerfed mate. xD
---
what's being delayed?
---
I like how you tried to lie and act like you actually play killer XD but exposed yourself as a survivor main complaining üò≠
---
Baby survivors got to learn, and sometimes, its nice to get a catch that doesn't endlessly loop everything in sight.
---
The Halloween outfit IS the one from the movie lmfaoo, how fucking stupid are you? Just because the license isn‚Äôt the same doesn‚Äôt mean the outfit isn‚Äôt. The OP specifically asked for the movie one which is why I said that the movie one was being added. Go back under your bridge
---
Well i haven't done the gen grab or myers mori achievements yet and those are gonna suck but the hardest i've done are probably the "do a specific gen and live to tell the tale" ones, and "Not Today".
---
I kinda got lucky on a lot of them but "Not today" was a like 3 week period of always having deliverance in my build
---
I'm assuming you didn't look then? Smh
---
Literally never seen this happen with my blonde Kate.
---
Survivors are plenty powerful without items as is.
---
This video wont stop fucking buffering every 3 seconds so can someone sort of sum up what hes saying
---
People cant take losing unless they can do something about it, in this case that something is perks, which are then looked down upon the losing players.
---
Then the cycle continues.
---
I am a killer main its all over my reddit you fucking idiot lmfao
---
Make Ivory and Ebony Moris only able to kill after 2 hooks instead of 1
---
Is this a repost of an old meme or something? Like why aren't Ghostface and demo on there?
---
The classic robes look nothing like they do in the movies. Bhvr doesn't even have a license to scream to begin with genius, so can you please be a bit less aggressive?
---
I mean, memes &gt; gameplay clips and cosplays any day
---
Yes! Let's trap the Hex totems!
---
Peanits said it better than any of us could.
---
They took no skill or forethought to use for how strong they were
---
Let me guess. The first streamer is tru3. It‚Äôs weird how you notice his flaws as a new player
---
Ok but I need to know what they eat at 2 am now
---
So you are the useless teammate that stays in lockers hoping for head on and camps pallets?
---
Shirtless clown? Is that you?
---
Maybe swap sloppy for dying light or PGTW for extra slowdown. (Or just use Bites Za Dusto)
---
DBD survivors keep their wigs on with a single bobbypin.
---
what is it about this game that has so many of us gays playing it? i honestly dont understand
---
neither does noed but somehow thats ok..
---
yes and one his perks shall be called the Golden chainsaw
---
I let him live if that's a Baby Dweet!
---
Appreciate the feedback üôèüèΩüòÑ
---
&gt;As he walks past you he should whisper that, just to make it scarier.
---
   
---
or when he starts chase with a survivor
---
It was primarily due to the scream rights being tied up with the Weinstein company
---
/u/vredditshare
---
Cutie
---
Is this from the same game as earlier or did it happen again?
---
idk tbh this is a lot more effort i see than most shitposts
---
make skeleton keys open the hatch for the user only (rework achievement where everyone escapes through hatch I guess)
---
delete dull key
---
buff broken key duration to 30 seconds (or more) instead of 10
---
The threat of the instant-down is still a powerful ability.
---
If you hit someone outside of your terror radius, that person now has to stop, stand still, and do nothing for a few seconds. This applies to someone out in the open (who has more hatchets to dodge) or someone who is next to a stupid good loop that would be a waste of time to go into.
---
I understand fully what Deep Wounds do, they slow the game down because unlike Rusty Head, you *have* to stop and get rid of Deep Wounds. With Inner Strength, Solidarity, Second Wind, Adrenaline, or just waiting out the timer, Rusty Head does nothing, and there would be nothing stopping you from running Deep Wound Hatchets with Rusty Head to stop a survivor for much longer.
---
Tell me, what would be great for chases that the Hatchets don't already do (There's add-ons for blindness, Hindered, Exhaustion, and Hemorrhage, none of which are currently used) that weren't complete bullshit for the person who got hit by them?
---
Finding this in a box during a match is like getting slapped in the face. By Bubba. With his chainsaw.
---
I know there is graphic/audio bug where myers gets T3 and the icon doesn't go away or stays a long time and sometimes the sound plays multiple times.
---
But if his power was actually active that is weird and sounds different. Definitely worth a bug report.
---
We‚Äôve had bill on console for a while lol
---
Did your mother tell you to type that?
---
Ruin: give enough time to set up all your traps.
---
pop goes the weasel: Punish survivors if they get hooked
---
BBQ chili: Bloodpoints and give you info where the survivor is
---
enduring: never respect pallets ever again.
---
you can switch to spirit fury on pop or bbq. enduring + spirit fury=free hit
---
Yeah me and shirtless david got that chemistry going
---
Ha-ha its my live
---
;) that‚Äôs, about correct! living the life over here. i‚Äôve been trying to explore other killers, but none of them really do it for me

Same game
---
So it's pretty obvious you've never played killer because it's never just a slaughter
---
Not much greater on the survivor side.
---
I‚Äôd prefer him directly, but his likeness works too.
---
Yeah exactly!
---
the only change I'd even consider for it would be for the timer to instantly stop of the killer hooks someone else while its active. Maybe buff the timer a bit or something in exchange.
---
edit: to be clear when I say stop, I mean the perk isn't active anymore. Not like paused.
---
It's pretty obvious that you're just bad then.
---
Rank doesn't really matter. You play against people so they can be bad/good/farming/afk. There's a lot of randomness to it.
---
Oh I know. Rank system is so cancer right now. I‚Äôm surprised I‚Äôm enjoying killer again. Normally I have a fake rank15 who‚Äôs been playing for 3 years.
---
Not even like he was taunting, the killer was nowhere near him. Just some fun for the viewers, in the moment type of thing. Don‚Äôt be so sensitive lol
---
Been playing Leatherface with PWYF. It‚Äôs actually pretty fun zooming across the map.
---
**BHVR:** We fixed the multiple killer glitch/bug for real this time guys!‚Äù
---
***ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?***
---
I don't think the timer could be *unlimited* because then the killer just can't pick you up if there's an exit gate open.
---
I play against a lot of rank 8 survivors and ik they have a very different skill gap between rank 15 survivors and rank 8 survivors
---
Wraith &amp; Mikey gave me a chuckle.
---
Saving people from facecampers is toxic now. Add that one to the 'killers rulebook for survivours'.
---
The Resident evil one certainly interests me
---
Okay will do
---
The main source of DCs in my killer matches.
---
That sounds pretty good. He‚Äôll have to get pop but that‚Äôs not to bad.
---
Pinky finger easy to use Iri heads, just like how clown is easy to use huntress.
---
More like 2 buffs, unrelenting and spirit fury
---
None of your points address that deep wounds is a useless status effect. It goes away in no time after doing absolutely nothing. Making her hatches apply it as about as useful as making them apply exposed.
---
Didn't Weinstein give the rights to Freddy from Nightmare on Elm St. Tho? Why would he hold off on Scream?
---
EDIT: got Wes Craven and Weinstein mixed up.
---
I can‚Äôt count how many post I have seen where it‚Äôs ‚Äúkillers cannot be within 15 miles of the hook because it‚Äôs camping‚Äù
---
I like the spirit build except I don‚Äôt want to use Stridor cause I‚Äôm scared of survivors DCing. My brother will like the ghostface build!
---
YES!
---
im a myers main
---
 i think its safe to say that after the freddy situation the changes the devs have been making are in good faith to game health, not to catering but making THEIR game more fun for both parties. You have to remember with out killers there is no dead by daylight, and killers have every right to be frustrated with 4 insta heals .that shit is outright broken and needs to be fixed. Also FAIR ADDONS? Yeah pressing one button and healing 2 states instantly is  fair. Not to mention with these proposed changes your still getting your precious health states, its just now your ass needs to work a little bit more then just pressing m1, which as a killer is more then fair in my eyes.
---
Then use dying light of bbq instead of stridor. Another thing, bbq can be put in almost any build and be good, so I do suggest that whenever you got it.
---
No idea, I just finished a game and got that when I came back lmao
---
A good spirit wont fall for mindgames, she gets so much info while survivors dont even know if she is using her ability. 
---
Spirit doesnt need to predict, she can legit just see where you are? she has so much info that makes her so easy to play that anyone who plays her is garbage.
---
there are mindgames that work once or twice, but a good spirit wont fall for those again, and then its back to being a 30/70 slot machine on whether you die or not.
---
Which just gets us tunnelled üòÇüòÇ
---
Who is dragondese
---
Everyone thinks everyone else is entitled. As always.
---
What I was thinking is that pennywise can change into a different killer for 30 seconds, and the cooldown for this ability is a minute. No Addons would just make the killer pennywise turns into a random killer but most Addons effect the killer pennywise takes form of and said killers abilities
---
;^)
---
ppl can do that with a timer already
---
For what it's worth, she's solid 3 ranks higher than me, so...
---
I'm so glad that someone else posted this. Panda has been so honest with his struggles recently and honestly if anyone is actually a true fan of his then they should realize that not harrassing him over DBD is what he needs right now. You can hear it in his YouTube videos that he's already beating himself up so much for struggling. Pointing it out is the last thing someone with anxiety/depression needs.
---
I don't mean any of this harshly, just that he needs to have space while he does whatever it takes to help improve his mental state. Pushing him will only make it worse and take longer for him to improve.
---
hybLove
---
They are selling it as a separate outfit in a couple weeks. I honestly believe they always had the license for the robe, but they chose to sell it separately cause they knew people would want it so bad. Very smart
---
Yeah it's a bug.  Happening to a lot :(
---
There is no threat of instant-down.  Have you ever been downed by a deep wounds timer since the TR change?  If you have then your opinion is of very little value to me.
---
If you hit someone out side of the terror radius, yes they have to mend, but they have plenty of time to find somewhere suitable to mend, and it takes a very short time to mend.  
---
If the huntress comes to follow up on the long shot, your timer will stop, and it will be as though you got hit by a normal hatchet, as you wouldn't have had a chance to heal in that time anyway, and you would still be injured.
---
If she doesn't you can just mend then heal, so it slows the game slightly more than just healing I grant you, but that is in the edge case scenario of long pot shots.  I'm not the best huntress, but I get them every couple of games.  Lets say I get them twice a game, that's 12s delay for an iridescent addon.  
---
I don't think it's not a cool idea, but suggesting it as a replacement to an iridescent addon just isn't enough.  I agree that the current hatchets are BS, but nerfing them into the ground isn't the way to go.
---
Jake brought saboteur just to get sabotaged by bill
---
In no particular order- 
---
You're running out of points? I think I already mentioned how being exposed while injured ruins that players chance to recover as if he stays injured the killer will find him/her via sound, if he/she heals it would lead to a slug+mori on sight. And borrowed time isn't enough to save a player unless the killer is either- Not a tunneling scumbag, The survivor manages to juke him before he's able to trap the survivor in a situation where the killer doesn't have to out play the survivor or survivors body block the killer. I play with borrowed time and it is not enough to save a survivor from a camping killer, All you can do is temporarily slow him and hope he tries to cut off the survivor. And that's if he's stupid enough to trigger BT while planning to tunnel which some don't. And If a survivor is camped every survivor loses points, doing gens is NOT enough to rank up, the only argument gen rushing has is the thought that survivors easily pip up from it (which they don't) in addition to the killer being looped for 5 minutes which can't happen unless the killer is very inexperienced. 
---
And Yes, It completely nullifies DS, hooks being sabotaged, (Here's some things you skipped because it goes against your point, Flashlight blinds, body blocking and even pallet stuns which I didn't mention) So yes, It is an argument and I'm going to assume you're an idiot now for disregarding those points but carrying on the fact that you have no argument but want to keep replying instead of improving the flawed ideas you've tossed up with little balance in mind. 
---
And the power of "The Strongest variation to mori* (Not including Tombstone for obvious reasons). 
---
There will always be at least one person to attempt an unhook unless it's a basement cannibal because they need the points to pip up. Saying they would ignore the hooked player just means you're in rank 17 lobbies where personal survival is the only way to go. 
---
I mentioned The Shape as an example of a poorly balanced power being given to him not unlike monstrous shrine in its initial post. I think you missed that point some how. 
---
The idea of a hex that can't be destroyed and must be coped all game is a very bad thing, That's actually something i forgot to put among other things since there's a lot to cover. 
---
Unclear what that comment is aimed at
---
Lastly i say you're new because you clearly lack the ability to balance custom perks with creativity being your only limitation. I hate to disregard bad ideas on the spot which is probably why this is still going, My suggestions are there more to show you how a balanced version of your unbalanced perks should be, Not how they are meant to be. It's like you're trying to misinterpret everything at sonic memeable speeds
---
noice
---
so you are saying a good killer has the power role in the game? yet you think survivors are still the OP ones? interesting
---
I usually wait in front of the locker for their DS to run out. I try always not to tunnel, but if the unhooked guy runs in your face and then just jumps into a locker coz he has DS and wants me to force him to grab him out of it then I make sure he dies...
---
I know its a waste of time and it would be better to go for someone else but when a survivor is toxic to me I am clearly ready to throw the game to kill them.
---
Jesus christ man, how bad are you that you only land one hatchet per game?
---
- You can land a hatchet on one person and go after the other.
---
- You can hit someone outside of your terror radius but not that much further and prevent them from running around.
---
- You hit someone with a hatchet. You kick the generator they were working on. They're stuck within 20m from you or they're stuck in place with a blood trail leading directly to them while they're mending.
---
- You hit someone with a hatchet, they pop Lithe/Balanced. They can't go far without having to worry about DW.
---
This is not a difficult concept to grasp.
---
Pop is in the shrine of secrets right now for 2000 shards. I just picked it up this week myself and love it.
---
You sound sooo fun to play against
---
Even with that, its still most killed sided map
---
Is this a callout or example?
---
The background kinda looks like a pumpkin. Might be a hidden message?..
---
It‚Äôs a game chill. There‚Äôs no reason to get ass chapped about it.
---
I knew there‚Äôd be one
---
You completely wasted that pallet btw
---
Just have fun, you'll get to rank 1 eventually
---
Sounds like you're ahead of most that early on.  Soon you'll be rank 1 and miss the rank 11 days.
---
Imagine blacking out the name that's already halfway offscreen. Holy shit lmao.
---
Nea wasn't even wiggling from the start I would left her ass
---
Survivor get tunneled to fuck: brings insta and decisive next game
---
Killer gets genrushed, teabagged at exit and "gg baby killer" in chat: never takes of ruin/noed again
---
Spirals into shit for everyone
---
1) If you hit someone outside of your terror radius, you're stopping them in their tracks to mend. That means gens aren't getting worked on.
---
2) If Huntress came to follow up on the long shot, you weren't able to run to a better position due to having to mend. Edge Huntress.
---
3) Just because you didn't get the long pot shot doesn't mean it's only going to happen once or twice per game. You can easily hit someone with the hatchet and go chasing after the other person who was working on the generator.
---
4) I've never been hit by Deep Wounds that didn't immediately give me a chance to recover with no downside of a Killer chasing after me. I've also never been hit by Deep Wounds with a Killer who has a base TR of 20m (4m with Furtive Chase), and I've never really been hit with Deep Wounds against a Killer that could down me outside of their Terror Radius.
---
Deep Wounds would absolutely be powerful on a Killer like Huntress that could perfectly take advantage of it.
---
I don't see any reason to resort to insults because I challenged your idea. You mentioned cross map shots so I addressed that point. I don't think an ultra rare add on that requires you to drop chase multiple times is very good design. You're trying to fix something that doesn't need a fix beyond limiting it to one hatchet.
---
Alright, thanks!
---
Everybody gangsta until Bubba head on stuns you
---
Thanks I'm trying to get the blood points and get those teachable perks so I can do my best
---
Lmao, this is great!
---
&gt;Look at how heavily your thread was downvoted. All these killer mains think anything a survivor does is OP. I've even seen them claim "excessive looping" is toxic. So what, we're meant to just stop looping after a minute and let them catch us, or else it's toxic? Same as "gen rushing". Oh I'm sorry, I'm not meant to do my objective until the killer says it's alright to start? Hilarious.
---
All these survivors mains think anything a killer does is op. I've seen them claiming "slug" is toxic. So what, we're meant to just eat ds or waste time when I can chase someone right after? Same as "gen rushing,. They still don't understand gen rushing is devs fault for how fast the game goes and they thinks everything is a direct attack to them. They even cry about tunnelling, oh sorry if I'm trying to do my objective, I'm meant to just let you leave for some made up rule? Hilarious
---
&gt;You'll never win against the mental gymnastics of these people. They truly believe that killers are little angels that can do no wrong. "60 seconds is too long", "5 seconds is too long". See how they behave? It's apparently too long, despite the fact it can be avoided if they don't tunnel. These are the same people who tell solo survivors to "just do totems" in order to counter NOED. But if we say "just don't tunnel" to avoid DS, they can't handle it.
---
You'll never win against the mental gymnastics of these people. They truly believe that survivors are little angels that can do no wrong. "Be DSed after another hook was done is fine" "just don't tunnel reeeeeee". See how they behave? They don't understand even if you don't tunnel you must slug, and if you do they call you out for doing so. These are the same people who cry about NOED when nobody uses it at red ranks since it doesn't even activate. They don't understand the point, and can't handle a criticism
---
NGL the reason I draw the spirit so much is I love drawing flowing hair... It's really fun to do in this style.
---
Why are you so upset? My exchange was barely even an argument. Stay in your lane.
---
Sometimes you have to grow up and realize that dming someone you don't know to call them out isn't okay. The game stays in the game, don't make someone feel like shit for playing a game by talking to them outside of it. He can do whatever he wants to win, and if you don't like it, get over it and move onto the next match. If you can't understand that then you'll just be considered entitled.
---
MaA is a lot of fun but I honestly think you dont really need it. I think bamboozle is better
---
r/perkbydaylight
---
It was definitely both the power and icon staying up and getting activated weirdly fast, I agree I‚Äôll definitely file a bug report either way
---
It really doesn't matter how someone plays Ghostface. His whole entire power is built around 1 shotting people. It's literally his whole fucking power. Idk what you noobs don't understand about that. Maybe it's because you want to pretend his power is useless. And it is, without add ons. You can say the same about any killer. Insta saw billy is a thing and it makes him shit tons stronger than no add on Billy. 
---
So are you suggesting "just remove addons because lol it makes the killers power more viable." That's what it's for but unlike insta heals you can use instant downs the whole match. Meanwhile the syringes can only be used once per person and consumes the full and entire medkit on use. 
---
I really don't think you noobs truly understand that. A lot of y'all bitching and crying about the game, a game which by the way is at it's most balanced in it's entire lifespan, are brand new players here because of the new stranger things content and the rest of y'all have less than 150 hours put into the game. You have about 2 weeks worth of experience and crying about shit that isn't broken because you don't know how to overcome it. Y'all are literally the only ones complaining about the game mechanics when no one else was. "Oh no idk how to get good. It must be the survivors fault!" The rest of you that actually have real and lengthy amounts of experience in the game are jumping the bandwagon for internet points. Get real.
---
Is shaking your head at a hooked survivor part of what he needed to do to win? He wants to bm so I‚Äôm gonna message him. I wasn‚Äôt even mean until after he accused me of cheating

The Hallowed Blight cosmetics from last year‚Äôs event have been on sale for some days now (can‚Äôt remember when it started).

I found the only way I can really enjoy this sub is by browsing new. That's the only place you find some halfway interesting stuff and it's also a lot of people asking questions so at least you can interact with people and give some advice.
---
It's a bug usually goes away
---
Maybe because you can also Dave it with add ons or retrieve them from the trial
---
Something that killers can't.. ooops
---
this meme has two very different meanings depending on if you read it from a surv's point of view or a killer's

You do know ps4 and xbox dont have dedicated servers yet right?
---
Same, I just saw that post a few minutes ago.
---
Why would he DC after this? I mean you bodyblocked and went down for it but the guy didnt even wiggle out, so it was only a win for the killer?!
---
I really want Negan from Walking Dead
---
I know pretty good how bubba works. Third most played character after Huntress and Pig...
---
Go look for it in new, somebody saw this post and already created it. It was really bad though.
---
Dude. I got banned twice just to reply to those dumbfucks. Just block every msg and friend requests, that's it
---
Hmm thick black üòè
---
Yeah, sadly thats the dbd community ^^
---
I was going to link it myself. Thank you my dude
---
I have noticed that Survivor ranks are used to bottleneck killers more since recent patches. After 2 months away from this game my Killer rank was all the way back up to 18 and during leveling I found that I was placed against lvl 18-13, upon crosssing rank 12 this shifted to 12-8. It seems killers are more commonly placed against survivors a couple of ranks higher then them, why this is  I don't know. Sometimes you'll find one lower ranked survivor but they are usually there because they where in a pre-formed team with a higher ranking friend.
---
It's a strange system, overall don't worry to much about ranks since they seem broken as all hell, or there is a strange system that until now I haven't been able to unravel. Also look up some builds for the killer like to play most and try to unlock those perks first from the bloodweb or shrine. At least you can get one killer geared up so you can have a better time.
---
Ghostface would share all his mori pictures on reddit
---
While I agree with hour sentiment, I disagree with your point that one killer = four survivors in terms of power. It only takes one good survivor outplaying the killer to drastically change the outcome of the match in their favor. One decent chase (not even those highlight reel 5 gen chases that are mostly the killer messing up) is enough to get gens done, cause the hatch to spawn, get Ruin, etc. 
---
Yes, killers have some strong tools to mitigate this, like juggling survivors, slowly working through pallets and catching survivors out of position. But the fact of the matter is that if you even have one survivor that you can't catch quickly and cant even make throw down pallets quickly, then any game is only a few bad decisions away from a loss. That survivor becomes a thorn in your side that you can't remove since the chase isnt worth it, but if you leave them alone then they get to just do whatever objective they want for free. Honestly I'd say the ratio is closer to 1 killer for 2 survivors, one to take up the killer's time and one to do the objective. If the killer target switches, the survivors switch who does the objective. That's why with 4 survivors up the killer is at a blatant disadvantage, which he/she slowly gains back as he completes sacrifices (or at the very least disables 1-2 of them with hooks and slugs).
---
The bow and the push into Ghostface make this gold.
---
Well okay, that's nice
---
Nurse should have expected the DS here tbh.
---
Someone actually DID report this for unrelated... bruh
---
I would lose my absolute mind if he was brought int the game. He is a wonderful guy.
---
oh fuck, you hate some dedication! congrats :)
---
Not really, compare an iri hatchet to bubba's or billy's chainsaw, both of them can be played around with pallets and vaults. That is not the case with hatchets.
---
I‚Äôd assume that it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs their powers respectively. People definitely get annoyed about insta saws though, and the crazy generous hitbox on Billy‚Äôs.
---
‚ÄúSurvivors are so toxic, just got teabagged by one the other day :(‚Äú

Concept: jockstrap David.

I‚Äôm sure you do at rank12 so does clown
---
Lol
---
Seeing how Walking Dead is a horror series unto itself, he fits in pretty well.
---
Better than he does in Tekken, at least
---
This question is valid if you are new. besides is more a question from ignorance than from stupidity.
---
A concept thread?
---
this is a decent idea if not a little 2 strong, but the main issue with it is that it just doesnt make sense with the character. i would think he would be given a lunge attack with his saw for a insta down kinda like demo
---
I almost never see this. This sub is mostly killer mains.
---
I got constant download speed of 125Mb+ and upload of around 45Mb+ and I sometimes see al lot of lag in this game when I play killer, there is a fundamental thing wrong with not auto-kicking survivors when they have a huge ping. Sometimes it works in your favor but it can screw you over in quite exceptional ways!
---
The problem is when you get linked up with players from the other side of the world the ping is a real issue, that's why dedicated servers are sorely needed! But until they get here people will have to take into account the high ping some players have especially if on top of distance they still use a a dail-up modem as some clearly still do it seems!
---
It's honestly a pretty necessary perk the better the survivors are. Without it, lower tier killers pretty much don't stand a chance as gens can be done so quickly. It's not op at all.
---
I‚Äôm here for the shitposts.
---
It's very easy to counter if the player using them is really bad. A good huntress knows how to aim correctly.
---
If that's true, that is very stupid.
---
Jockstrap Myers ;)
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs OP, especially in higher levels; I figure the more experienced a survivor, the quicker it gets destroyed. More than half the time, I hear that thundering boom in the first minute or two. Besides, I personally don‚Äôt find great skill checks hard to hit, though I understand how they could be.
---
Be warned though, he *constantly* complains about everything, making his videos almost unwatchable after a period of time
---
I've encountered it a few times, I usually just drop a medkit if i have one but it seems like some people can't interact with others via healing. I think I wasn't able to be healed according to my friend for a game a few weeks ago. I'm not sure what causes it but it resolved itself next game. It happened to some people in my party occasionally with nothing being out of the ordinary. If i had to Guess it would be lag with the killer, a hit lands for him, the lag may cause it to not register for others? I dunno
---
Sometimes kobe situations are required though when everybody else has been hooked or is currently on hook, but I can see what ya mean about some base line stats about other things.   
---
I think I would agree maybe like games played, average survival time per game (as survivor), average killer game length (as killer), stats like this could be really cool to see. I know on Overwatch I really like looking through stats and kind of admiring my growth if there was any at all, but it also helps me see where I need improvement.
---
I'm okay with them changing the instaheals as long as they change instadowns
---
Same thing with keys and moris 
---
Honestly? None of them should be in the game
---
My survivor games on dedicated servers disagree.
---
Part of being a good survivor is being able to work through Hex Skill Checks. Good survivors can and will work through Ruin, it doesn‚Äôt need a nerf
---
Endurance?
---
You have a ton of time to mend because Legion is running away from you giving you time to get it off. Alternatively, you have a ton of time to move away because Legion is affected by a 5 second stun if he cancels his power.
---
Huntress denies both of those things. Applying Deep Wounds as a Huntress with her Hatchets is actually faster than just hitting someone due to cooldown times, and Huntress can just as easily down you at the next pallet.
---
You're sleeping on the fact that Deep Wounds would be powerful for Huntress.
---
Swbf
---
It's a good way to work on your skill check abilities.  It slows down gen rushers but if you can hit skill checks it's not bad.  It's just a tactic to slow down early game.
---
Survivor rank 8 here
---
I would consider this a farming game, and my personal opinion is to never farm with anybody.   
---
"Farming bloodpoints is not bannable but farming survivors as a result of "working with the killer" is. If no one gets abused then it is no problem afaik." a quote from Megreta on steam.
---
Its not OP at all from a survivor main. It gives killers besides spirit/freddy/nurse/billy a chance... sometimes not even then since survivors can spawn on it.
---
I see what you saying then maybe just a stat on being 1hooked or something I would just like some info about who I‚Äôm playin with. I understand the devs intended for anonymity aspect to the game but when you‚Äôre playing and someone kills themself on first hook out of rage it ruins everyone‚Äôs experience
---
It means you fucking suck at the game, casual low ranking trash.  :\^3
---
Have an upvote before the scrubs lose their minds with downvotes because facts don't matter to them.
---
What farming game means ?
---
Did it say what you were suspended for? And was he nice to everyone?
---
If you attempt to use it and the spinning needle lands outside the d-strike area, it's burned - no re-uses.  
---
If you don't try to use it and it just pops up and goes away without you trying to stop the spinning needle, it's re-usable.  
---
From the perk description in game:  
---
Using whatever is at hand, you stab at your aggressor in an ultimate attempt to escape.
---
After being unhooked or unhooking yourself, *Decisive Strike* will become active and usable for **40**/**50**/**60**¬†seconds.
---
While *Decisive Strike* is active, when grabbed by the Killer, succeed a Skill Check to automatically escape the Killer's grasp and stun them for **5 seconds**.
---
* SUCCEEDING OR FAILING THE SKILL CHECK WILL DISABLE DECISIVE STRIKE.
---
* Successfully stunning the Killer will result in you becoming the ***Obsession***.
---
*Increases your chances of being the* ***Obsession***.
---
*The Killer can only be* ***obsessed*** *with one Survivor at a time.*
---
*"There's nothing to be scared of." ‚Äî Laurie Strode*    
---
Hope this clarifies it for you &lt;3
---
The perk can be taken out within a minute if the match, hell even just 20secs. It‚Äôs fine. People just need to learn to hit the skillchecks or power through it.
---
It didnt say why, and everyone escaped
---
How would survival stats make things terrible
---
The Halloween event where a new thing will be introduced called the archives. These are basicly a more interesting version of daily rituals, where you can get cosmetics and other stuff. Also the new skins that were to be published with the event as well as some balancing, like nerfing instance heals and the nurse. 
---
The issue seems to be problems with the new engine on which the game will be running, it seems to be fundamental to the game. The devs encountered too mand bugs during the PTB thanks to the change of engine, weren't able to fix them satisfyingly, so on short notice they delayed the event indefinitely (probably beginning of November).
---
Right now quite a part of the community seems to be pissed of by this. Probably especially because it was delayed hours before it was supposed to start and it isn't the first major fck up by behavior.
---
If you've read until here, you might care about my opinion. I personally don't think its such a big deal. The event will have the same duration and everything, only one or two weeks later. It seems and honestly might be a sign of incompetence by behavior, but I'd still argue that it shows that they care about what happens to their game and that the players will have a satisfactory product, unlike games like fallout67 or fifa20.
---
So I don't buy into the hate, but everyone has their own opinion and its not like there is no reason for it, just remember that there are people working on the game who want to ensure a certain level of quality for us
---
Dude, nice! It looks just like the posters I have of Alphonse Mucha's art!
---
Yeah lets nerf killers why not
---
That's it!!! Thanks
---
Kk, tell me more, brother
---
I would like to know the context of the original video. What the fuck was she even thinking?
---
What would be his perk though?
---
Maybe "Movie expert"? "The killer's aura is revealed for 5 seconds at the start of the trial but the killer sees your aura for 3 seconds
---
It is an ultra rare you idiot.
---
You forgot the /s
---
It‚Äôs an oddly balanced perk. Purple ranks and upwards allow hex ruin to cripple them instead of just hitting skill checks so they waste time looking for it. Making life on the killer easy. But the higher ranks it becomes just a minor slowdown cuz gens still pop. Plus it doesn‚Äôt last for more than 1-2 minutes 90% of high rank games
---
I recently downloaded it since the xb1 released for free for gold; is it worth a play? I wasn‚Äôt sure.
---
Yup, always browse by new on this sub.
---
Incoming baited indiviuals.
---
I would like to know "times disconnected"
---
It‚Äôs also buggier then dbd which is crazy.
---
Ranks 12 through 20: Ruin is OP. No one finds the totems, no one can hit the skillchecks to do the gens through them. Massive slowdown 80% of the time.
---
Ranks 7 through 11: Ruin is decent. Survivors do a gen until they get the red skillcheck and then search around until they find it. Better at finding totems, but if you get a good totem spawn/ totem map it can stay up a pretty long time. Otherwise it could be gone instantly.
---
Ranks 3 through 6: Ruin is meh. Survivors generally do one gen through the Ruin then search for it. You usually get 1 to 2 gens popping followed by a long lull until they find it. If ur Ruin spawns in a common spot close to a gen it's gone instantly and there's no point defending it. You get value out of it maybe 60% of the time and good value out of it maybe 20%.
---
Ranks 1 and 2: Ruin is pretty bad. On spawn, survivors tend to check the obvious and close totem spots just in case they can snipe it instantly. If it's not right there, survivors don't bother looking for it and wasting time, they just power through and hit skillchecks. They will inevitably bump into it and break it but it's by no means a top priority on a solid team. You'll say to yourself "well at least Ruin's still up" and gens will pop anyways. 
---
Conclusion: Ruin gets worse the better your rank gets. At red ranks, about 50% of killers that I see have swapped to Corrupt Intervention as their primary, early game slowdown perk. This works especially well now that there's more ways to consistently slow down the game once you get your momentum up (ie Dying Light, Freddy's addons, Sloppy+Thana becoming more popular, etc) where all you need to snowball is just a little bit of time to work at the beginning of the game. Ruin's still good (although inconsistent) but it's no longer the mandatory perk that it once was.
---
I also wonder xD
---
On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being nerf it now too OP... I would give it a 4 to 5. I don't think it's OP. I just think people need to learn how to deal with it using time management.   
---
1. You either brute force it and ignore the totem hopefully you are good at great skill checks, or you are lucky enough to only get 2-3 skill checks for the entire generator.
---
2. If you are working in a swf group send 1 guy out to try and find it that preferably has small game 
---
3. Understand and learn totem spawns (there is specific spawns) so when you are moving from gen to gen make sure to check each section where it could be
---
4. Take small game yourself if you are playing solo, and even if someone else is trying to find it also at least you are being somewhat efficient listening for the sound proc as you are traveling
---
5. try not to think of it as a negative because that's only going to make you feel worse about wanting to do it. Every time you see a hex ruin skill check at start of game don't just go on by saying "Oh fuck I hate hex ruin" just try to handle it critical and figure it out. You'll escape more and have more fun in the end.   
---
It's just there to slow the game down, but it doesn't mean it has to be OP.
---
It‚Äôs not op in the slightest,
---
The reason I usually get stunned is because I hook someone, go to someone else, down them, and then I happen to down that first hook person again. Its hard to avoid cycling through hooks so fast as an instant-down killer. You get hit by it even though you weren't tunneling lol
---
Cute. Great work buddy
---
I‚Äôve noticed it happens more frequently to me when I put the PS4 in rest mode then wake it up later picking up where I left off in the game. Closing the app and reopening fixes it for me.
---
they still pay people to say things like this?
---
It would make playing survivor even more focused on surviving rather than pipping which is the true success to the game. IE you can escape and de pip, if you‚Äôve done nothing during the trial. Adding a survival % will make people do whatever it costs to survive. Probably see an increase in key usage too.
---
Yes please. Please
---
It's rare to see because of the amount of DC's you'll see in a match if you do use it. You get no points and you depip. People not using them isn't the equivalent to it being rare or rarely available.
---
Dead by daylight is fun if you are good at the game. I used to think that because I'd always just load in a and die. To have fun playing dbd you need to atleast play for a few hundred hours compared to how fast I jumped into f13 and just demolished campers and Jason alike. The sad truth is they will never update friday with anything new so that first 100 hours will be the same as your last 1000. The combat in friday really was fun though until they decided to do the rage update which made me leave shortly after. I'll admit I have been wanting to play it recently though.
---
OH GOD YES PLEASE 
---
And his perks would be TITLE CAAARD, Let's get to the kills and Dead Meat
---
If you have DS and Head On you can create an ultimatum, either they grab you out of the locker and get DS'ed, or they get hit by Head On.
---
It‚Äôs still got its shitload of issues, just like DBD.
---
Because you're a passive aggressive asshole. Making people like you mad is my lane. Don't like it, don't hit reply bitch.
---
Then boast on the Friday the 13 subreddit
---
New killer coming soon: the Lorax
---
Good plan body blocking and using DS to escape but you got very lucky getting off that hook if not for that it would have been over
---
It's called farming. I've never heard of anyone being banned unless another player reported you guys.
---
I see people meming but I think there can be some great thematic perks that are maybe based on how many/how his teammates died.
---
To me the whole bp economy thing means that moris and some add ons are assumed to have some level of rarity to make up for their power.
---
During bp events players who already have the perks they want/need can get huge stacks of said add ons, which leads to many ufun matches. After bp events you will see a ton of instaheals (soon nerfed), moris, etc. which lowers the quality of matches and makes people want to play the game less.
---
Rev time, that's why.  The only saw people hate is instasaw.
---
You can dodge Billy as long as you are near a ledge or can break his straight shot to you, you can hide from Bubba or outrun him, Iri you can't do much with other than playing like a pussy, even just having one is going to blow ass given hitboxes and latency.
---
He has got to say "Title Card" when loading into a lobby.
---
I really easy solution to the whole Are They SWF debate is if they just put an indicator linking people's icons. Like what Overwatch does
---
It's not. Either power through the gen regression or wait two minutes.
---
Yeah ya do, Black Ward.
---
I think the doctor guy is called Doctor, idk tho
---
ok
---
I swear they dodge me in bloody clothes. I had to take them off and suddenly I dont get dodged. I've dodged bloody clothes in my earlier killer days.
---
Than*
---
Dead By Daylight is the biggest killjoy magnet imaginable, especially the console surv mains. I can imagine you dc as soon as you go down vs Spirit, you ought to quit being so negative
---
Oh sorry, I misread.
---
After a while of playing and eventually learning how to hit your great skill-checks, having to deal with Ruin really isn‚Äôt that much of an issue. I only ever look for Ruin around the area I‚Äôm currently at and then immediately go back to my gen, otherwise you‚Äôre wasting time. 
---
Even if a teammate or two is off trying to find Ruin the whole match, you can still tip the game in your favor by simply committing to gens and completing them. Plus, a lot if killers will usually stay close or frequently go back to protect their Ruin at the start of a game, so it keeps them off you for a bit longer to at least complete one or two gens if you‚Äôre hitting your skill-checks. 
---
It just does what literally what everyone else says it does: slows the game down a bit.
---
If were being fair, a lot of people never used them before the nerf was announced anyways. You might have 1 full instant heal out of every 10th match because they are actually harder to come by in bloodwebs. In a full year on just 1 survivor I think I've gotten maybe 12 in total. But because of the nerf, everyone is using them up before they're completely useless. 
---
You noobs cried about how "op" 1 insta heal was now you have to deal with 4 per person every match.
---
You reap what you sow.
---
I was thinking maybe something like the giant in Last Year.  Short dash, grabbing a survivor and then can walk around and aim for a bit before just chucking them in a direction hurting them when they land
---
Cause if you've played Survivor for 15 minutes you would know that even if you do everything right you will still take hits because of hitboxes and latency.  She can also throw through all major hurdles so you have to keep a wall between you and an instadown ranged attack that is QUITE generous to say the least.
---

There definitely is a bug where sometimes you can't heal other survivors. I've never heard of it happening consistently though, it seems to be more of a random thing.
---
She wanted to activate Balanced Landing to excape Michael
---
babies cant handle banter
---
You sure it wasnt blood warden?
---
I dont like the way you cant pick jason though. The rng sucks
---
nah I could leave, just had to move over a bit to not walk into the tree
---
This is why you mori blendattes
---
Surprised you slugged both. Nice placement though!
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll definitely do that and see what happens
---
Wait are the dedicated servers on console ?
---
That's pedantic and you know it.
---
Once you damage someone with their power with Legion, you can't do anything to them other than M1 them. 
---
Other killers, like Billy, Huntress, Hag, or Freddy have powers that are constantly in effect and don't become completely useless if the opponent is already injured.
---
A lot of people, popular streamers included, will say things like "Trapper is just an M1 Killer without his traps". That's just what people say.
---
Where are there images of the new costume I cant seem to find it?
---
Clown's instant down requires first hitting a bottle directly, then successfully landing an M1 attack in a short time. They're more fair to play against than iridescent heads for sure.
---
Who dat
---
If someone is going to leave against a Spirit, 1 perk wont change their mind they will leave regardless. I dont run Stridor (just prestiged her) &amp; people will still leave. If you are adamant on not running the perk though then you could do; Nurses, Sloppy, ThanPhob, BBQ. You can replace BBQ with something else if you want. Ruin, Dying Light ect.
---
Be aware though that Spirit can't see Auras when invisible but Nurses &amp; BBQ can give you a good idea before you go invisible.
---
The delay was not caused by a power outage. OP is a liar.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/98653
---
Thanataphobia, Sloppy Butcher, Nurses Calling/BBQ, Ruin. Don‚Äôt use ghostface‚Äôs stalk to get 1 hits use his stalk to have no terror radius and circle gens. You‚Äôll catch people off guard and if you only go on small chases and circle gens thanataphobia and sloppy should slow down the game plenty even if they find ruin right away. I prefer bbq to get as many hooks as fast as possible but if youd rather use nurses ik thats a good replacement.
---
P.S ghostface has been my fav killer recently and if you play him like i describe you‚Äôll find hes rather viable compared to having to stalk for 1 hits.
---
If you say so
---
Gobble gobble mother *&amp;*‚Ç¨er
---
OP is an altruistic god. My teammates usually sandbag me while teabagging.
---
So then explain to me how DW works, since you seem to think you understand how it works better than I do.
---
"Doesn't synergise with anything", he says. It synergises with how she doesn't need to be in Terror Radius to apply it, her tiny Terror Radius in addition to that, and how it'd be the only thing in the game that doesn't *require* you to go after them with another M1.
---
You could literally get it to where you have a 4m Terror Radius as Huntress, I'd say that's a pretty powerful effect to have on an Ultra Rare. But something tells me that you're stuck in your ways and too shortsighted to see past your nose.
---
"Welcome to the kill count where we tally up the victims in all our favorite horror movies"
---
OH! ZATS A BASEBAW!
---
depends on what the killer's power is. The problem with insta-downs is when they supplement the killers power to be even more extreme. There's a difference between getting chainsawed by Hillbilly and getting an Iri head in the face from Huntress. His whole power revolves around the chainsaw and it's lethality + speed, Huntress' main power revolves around her attacking from range. When you add  on the her power to do even more than what it's capable of that's where balance comes into question.
---
This can apply to every killer. Sure Hillbilly can insta down you with his chainsaw, but if he gains the ability to throw it at you fully revved, that will be unbalanced.
---
I kind of love that your response to me responding on sharing my thoughts instead of a streamers is 'meh'. Pretty perfect haha.
---
Stay pressed, sweetie.
---
Ya.. it‚Äôs called farming. And still is cheating
---
Negan from Tekken 7* of course.
---
Literally any above GTX 750. My friend got 760 ti and 8gb ram and still playing on medium graphics with 60 stable fps(because of fps lock in game)
---
But, if u wanna go all out, buy 1660 ti, low budget for INSANELY good perfomance.
---
Well, for you. Keep in mind that opinions are subjective. Dead by Daylight can be super fun depending on what, how and against whom you play. Same goes for Friday the 13th. With bad teammates and a smart killer, you get a short and boring round. For me, I like the concept of DbD better. Surciving by relying on your perks and your surroundings is much more fun than relying on being able to stun the killer with a gun or by fighting back.
---
Neal would end up in the locker with me ;)
---
Who cares about gens xD
---
Yeah i guess, i just found out...
---
The perk does literally nothing until the unhooked death hook survivor gets healed. Let me repeat that. The perk does literally nothing until the unhooked, death-hook survivor gets healed. A mori on death hook survivors is not enough to be a perk. Even with the exposed effect, it wouldn't be that good.
---
I didn't mention bodyblocking or flashlight saves because a mori does counter that. Yes, it goes against my point. So what? You get caught up on this while you haven't had a complete coherent thought this whole time.
---
 &gt; And the power of "The Strongest variation to mori* (Not including Tombstone for obvious reasons). 
---
Here's one of your incoherent responses. This isn't even a complete sentence. I have no idea what you are responding to because there is no subject and you didn't quote anything. All your responses are either too vague, have wrong logic, or literally don't make sense.
---
You say only rank 17 do gens.. but have you been at red ranks? Survivors come over, see the camper, then go do a gen. Camping doesn't work at red ranks in the vast majority of games.
---
Myers is one of the most balanced killers. So regardless of what you were trying to get at with the comparison, you are wrong.
---
But why is a permanent hex effect bad? It's similar to plagues power (but drastically weaker because it's a perk.). I don't see the problem. Saying "it's bad" doesn't make it bad. Your only point here was "muh points," but I cleared that up.
---
Everyone is bad at balancing perks. You think the devs are balancing gods? I'm somehow a new player because I'm only as good as a dev is? Should I take some "game balance theory" class at a university before I'm allowed to post?
---
You do sound entitled.
---
I get what you are saying, but the power can very easily swing into the killer's favor early in the game.
---
Also, the hatch always spawns, no matter what, regardless of how well or poor the players in the match did.
---
Very rarely are there more than 1 god tier looper in a survivor team. Leaving that player be to get free objectives is fine, because their less skilled teammates were free to do objectives in their place, but now you are disabling the team as a whole faster.
---
If there are 5 gens up still and 1 survivor is dead, it is now the killer's playground and escape is very unlikely for any of the surviving survivors.
---
Even with 4 people up, if you have one person hooked, someone is probably not working on a gen to go and save them. If you are also already chasing another survivor, you are effectively stalling everyone on their team from completing objectives except 1 person,  and that is if 1 person decides to stay on a gen and 2 people arent going to rescue. A single survivor death almost entirely freezes up the game unless the killer is bad, or a survivor is really good at their job.
---
Iris and moris completely throw this out the window, greatly speeding up the process at which progress is halted entirely by the survivors, and really just cheeses the match.
---
A perfectly balanced match to me is one where 1 or 2 survivors survive. A good chase is often what it takes for that to happen.

If you only buy 1 character from Stranger Things dlc it only costs (PC, idk about console) 500 auric cell things (= 5.00‚Ç¨, whole dlc costs 12‚Ç¨) so just select the character that youre gonna play most (for me it was demogorgon) and its only going to cost you 5‚Ç¨
---
Yeah I find that his big downside I like his stream most of the time but I remember asking if there was anything you can do when they're jumping into hatch and he got all pretentious
---
Fun world doesn‚Äôt have a character behind Ghostface so they told bhvr they could make one up and I assume the robe isn‚Äôt nearly as important as the mask and said they can add it later if they want
---
Okay... I'll just be over here, then... standing in this corner... all alone doing nothing
---
I tend to run iron grip and agitation, just because his basement game is so damn strong. If I down / trap someone near there, they are definitely going in the basement. Also means I can put the traps in really remote places if required and still carry someone to a hook. 
---
BBQ &amp; Chill and my beloved Franklin's Demise tend to be my other two.
---
Enduring and Spirits fury if you want something more meta.
---
Put quentin in ‚Äúnearly‚Äù
---
Thanks, I only stalk people when they are like in the open not knowing I'm there
---
fucking lol
---
So because I support the Devs that means I'm a dick rider? Everyone like you fails to realise that BHVR is NOT as big of a company you think. Yeah they make mistakes but that's called being human. Honestly annoys me that people are toxic to the Devs, they're trying their hardest to bring us a game we can all enjoy, then they have to put up with pieces of shit like yourself
---
How bout banning all the low quality cosplay too? The shit is annoying and garbage.
---
Totally agree with you, it's so frustrating!
---
Yeah that rule has not been enforced as hard lately because those posts are not always reported and given a few hours it hits front page. Thats all changing soon
---
Apologies if I ever let you down
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs Nea anyway.
---
How is this even cosplay? You look like the average teenager.
---
Insta down add-ons are not that powerful though. Huntress's Iri Heads are Avery big threat, but they're still hatchets, and you still have to hit a moving Target. They're powerful, but they're not free. They're expensive, and easy to lose, since the entitlement of survivors can be extremely damaging when using Ultra Rare Add-ons. If you really think that they're that much too strong, don't make them lose their insta down effect, apply something that makes them harder to land, harder to throw, easier to spot or Dodge, just like what happened to insta heals. Don't remove their power, just weaken it.
---
Your point?
---
When wake up was bugged you know how many people with that perk I saw?
---
The difference is, this bug is very rare, the wake up one, wasn't.
---
I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúgen rush‚Äù is some secret hack like people make it out to be it‚Äôs just a term for survivors doing gens fast. Them doing gens as quick as possible isn‚Äôt the issue. The devs just need to balance slow down perks if they don‚Äôt want to increase gen time. Like just don‚Äôt put ruin next to gens. Please stop that
---
Oh boi another pure Survivor Player.... who uses DS / Dead Hard Adrenaline and is in a swf group \^\^
---
Or you're just not good at Dbd.
---
Did the killer of the match you were in have Stridor? It‚Äôs a perk that makes survivor breathing a lot louder
---
Yeah, iri heads are really the bad one
---
Was playing against Bubba and got the gates open, but a survivor was being camped on hook. I got a flashlight and tried luring the Bubba away but he didn't budge. Someone unhooked the survivor and they got downed again, but the bubba started chasing the other guy around. I healed the downed guy while Bubba wascoming back and blocling the gates. He began charging his chainsaw up waiting for the injured survivor. I ran past him and caused him to chainsaw the wall, letting me and the injured survivor escape.
---
No one left behind uwu
---
u/Otzdarva u are amazing
---
Some killers do it better than others. Billy with no good perks will still have a solid shot vs most survivor teams. Hag has good teachable perks so even if you havent unlocked much you'll still have Ruin and a killer that can somewhat defend it with her traps. Clown with bad perks is just gonna get gen rushed and there's little you can do about it. 
---
The thing about this game is that your rank is mostly dependent on consistency. I can almost guarantee that if I play any killer with any set of perks I'll eventually be able to 4k it. But in order to rank up you need a build that performs well *every* game, or at least most. Synergized perks let you establish a gameplan that you can use to more consistently win games and increase your rank. 
---
For now, you're relatively new so just focus on getting good fundamentals, unlocking good perks and seeing how you like to play. Winning doesn't matter, just focus on improving and having fun. Eventually though, getting good perks and synergy will really help you stylize your play and fully capitalize on the good m1 plays that you are learning how to make right now.
---
Doesn't look like a ragequit.. are you okay dude? It's kinda obvious he had some kind of error or connection issue
---
Any word if the devs are working on a fix?
---
I really like the dumb tier lists though qwq
---
I LOVE that you can still see the other spirit while phasewalking, like, the spaghetti code knows that you can't see survivors, but thats a killer, so you can see it, even though there shouldn't be any way for that to happen.
---
Probably for the action speed bonus or when the Killer is too close for OoO to activate.
---
One has killed others games like them and the other has been in a coffin for 3 months I‚Äôll let you decide which game is which :)
---
Thank you for this useless post
---
don't make me do this to you
---
i dont wanna r/woooosh you, but its very tempting
---
add some blood or bandages, maybe a hook wound! Not trying to harsh your buzz but this looks like your mom or dad took a pic after seeing how long they could get you to hold a heavy tool box lol.
---
bruh...that's whack.
---
All right
---
Clown has a similar addon too
---
Did you farm your teammates?
---
Same buddy, i need comms with me frens
---
I have pretty much no doubt that you got suspended for something else. This kind of gameplay goes unpunished all the time. If you want to inquire about your suspension you should message support.
---
Not really. Just making a general point about teabagging in general. Whether you actually get offended by it or is lying I'll never know cause I don't watch you play to see your reaction to it. But my point stands regardless.
---
I got BAITED
---
What do you mean? How do i farm teammates?
---
Can you heal with a med kit?
---
Each to their own. Though what did you accomplish by saying this.
---
Honestly it‚Äôs not, not only are good spawns for the Hex not guarantied. But the skill checks just aren‚Äôt hard  maybe to a new player they might be but if you have a good rank 1 squad it doesn‚Äôt really matter if the killer has ruin
---
Gender switched?
---
And thank you for this equally useless comment
---
I got some people thoughts about what makes Dbd fun which ended up being to play it for a 1000 hours
---
I definitely get what ur saying. Just to clarify, I mean finishing a gen to get the hatch to spawn closed for a key escape, not getting the hatch to spawn open when there's one survivor left.
---
But I completely agree that moris are ridiculous. They're dumb, were introduced as a counter to old Brand New Parts that used to just instantly complete one gen and have no place in this game. I agree, taking out one survivor early is enough to just win the game straight up for the killer. I'd like to see them gone and keys gone. Both just abruptly win the game for their respective sides with no counter and circumvent a big part of the normal match's lifecycle. 
---
Iris I'm still pretty torn on. Yes, a lot of them are strong but they're also super gimmicky. Survivor's catching onto what you're doing is generally enough to render many of them ineffective. The two I hear people complaining about the most is Iri Head Huntress and perma T3 Mikey. Iri huntress is super strong if you hit the shots but honestly it's pretty bad vs survivors that are good vs Huntress. You only get 3 max so you can't risk spamming them over loops and the normal "are you gonna throw the pallet so I can hatchet you?" mindgame she has is honestly pretty weak at red ranks. Perma T3 mikey is good until you run into the p3 claudette team that never gets found, not to mention it will take a solid 3-4 gens just to tier up. THEN once you get there he's still just a normal m1 killer that you can loop, just a little faster. So many of the Iris are good when they work but have extremely exploitable weaknesses if they don't and quite frankly, aren't even most killer's strongest addons. I could see why people want them changed but honestly I've also seen teams straight up bully solid killers running Iri perks simply cause the survivors recognized what they were running.
---
Lmao you know someone did that to be an asshole
---
It USED to actually have a function, same with the ‚ÄúDid you enjoy this match?‚Äù Feature.
---
Basically in an old stream, they said they had to ignore about 90% of the reports because people simply reported others for mundane reasons, like tunneling/camping/using annoying Perks. They found that Survivors/Killer who won didn‚Äôt touch the Report/Match Enjoyment, while those who lost were reporting people and rating 1 out of 5.
---
Basically, salty butt hurt people ruined those features and now we have to submit actual tickets off the Website.
---
I got it now. I turned my shift into toggle recently and thats why noone could heal me
---
Some people aren't fans of cosplay. I do appreciate the fan art, but I prefer the discussions and memes. Everyone has different interests. All DBD content should be welcome here.
---
Fuck me just make this a feature if you cant fix it BHVR
---
I stated nothing about perks/killers/survivors/strategies being toxic. Literally nothing.
---
I don't know why this is getting downvoted.
---
‚ÄúFun‚Äù I don‚Äôt find it better though
---
Yeah it looks a little too clean, like you‚Äôd have to explain your costume over and over, because it looks like you wearing normal clothes lmao.
---
I‚Äôd definitely rip the pants/shirt up, and throw some dirt/paint/blood spatters around
---
How..? You still can't be tunneled *directly* off hook. As long you don't try any really greedy plays, you'll be alright. There's no reason 2 or more people should be able to have DS at the same time. How does one tunnel multiple people?
---
It's definitely the second one
---
Nice one man
---
Yeah, unfortunately you're probably right.
---
Nah I thought that looked like when Annie was in titan form then right before her nape got cut and she fell down the wall when it panned over her face, I now feel stupid for forgetting mello‚Äôs face was burnt, I‚Äôll definitely rewatch it, sorry bout that
---
):&lt;
---
For ghostface: WHISPER tier3! I personally think its the most important perk.
---
Besides that, you could do sth like BBQ, pop, discordance, but use what you like
---
I think there are 3 kinds of perks: one to slow the progress on gens like ruin or pop, information perks like BBQ or discordance, and lethality perks like noed haunted grounds or make your choice. Also some very situational, but I'd make sure that I have a decent balance of these categories. For ghostface, lethality is not an issue, but informations are quite necessary if you want to stalk, therefore I'd suggest a focus on that category
---
Aaaaannnnnnnnddddddddddddd back problems.
---
I play on a PS4 pro and the FPS is still awful as the Demogorgon, I've literally stopped playing him because of this reason.
---
That happened my first 3 or so matches, I was circling the upside down areas very confused and the person unhooking the guy I had strung up body blocked me.
---
I apologized post match and they were pretty cool about it since I let them take off and didn't facecamp them or ruin the match intentionally.
---
Let's continue this discussion in around 2 weeks. üò¨
---
Ugly in life, ugly in death.
---
lulw
---
[Perk roulette link](https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/roulette/survivor/)
---
I usually let the last survivor live. They didn't disconnect, they managed to outlast... Unless they are the kind to teabag.  
---
Unrelated, last night two survivors escaped and waited for me at the exit. Wiggling at each other made me feel good in my heart for some reason.
---
Truth
---
Exactly. "I dont want a ban because my internet sucks!" 
---
Then sort that shit out before playing. You ruin EVERYONES game. Or stop lying. Lol.
---
1) He teabagged with the Killer both no where near him, and not even looking at him. The Killer never knew or saw.
---
2) ‚ÄúLayytahhh biiitch!‚Äù was not even a direct insult to the Killer, it‚Äôs just the Streamer making a funny exit to keep people entertained.
---
Why are you so angry lmao
---
But you didn‚Äôt either as killer cuz you can get a 3k with 1 hatch escape and get a brutal killer Black pip which means draw
---
I'm sorry did your ass just jojo me?
---
"i give the godlen chainsaw for coolest kill for  dwight who get this ass  mori by the trapper"
---
I have to agree. Even on a Pro, on some maps I have awful frames as Demo and Hag. I really hope the next patch can fix the framerate on consoles...
---
I bet he still found a way, classic Bill
---
I think they capped it because a while back some people where hacking and gave themselves infinite bloodpoints for their accounts.
---
When you recognise the blood brush lol
---
I beleive this is caused by keywords such as "glitched"
---
Michael just has instakill add ons
---
Uh, no? He's only been in for a month or two. He was just added in when Demogorgon was added
---
The Demo doesn‚Äôt do it to rip their head off, though. It‚Äôs more like an alligator thrashing around to break the bones/neck
---
And why does that happen? Hatch mechanic and killer pip reward system they need a rework
---
Made with memeatic
---
It's just the fact that they let something like a power outage delay them and the pairing of the event within the mid chapter release instead of separate was a huge marketing miss and a little unprofessional. No one's saying this is the final straw, just pretty stupid on the release timings part.
---
No matter how much heck you put me through, if you were the last survivor I would let you live.  
---
As a killer I find this more hilarious than frustrating XD
---
DW is a timer, a timer that when it runs out, you go down.  However if you are mending, or are in TR the timer stops.  The timer lasts for 20s. 
---
If you think that 20s is not enough time to reposition and mend, especially considering it does not proc nurses (or you know synergise with any killer perk), then you are just bad, or you were in a bad position at the start such that the huntress would have got you anyway, with the DW make zero difference.
---
If you think that it will help in the usual Huntress gameplay, you know chasing survivors into positions you can down them with a M1 or cut off their options with a hatchet, it won't, because the timer will pause.
---
If you think it will slow the game down a little bit by spreading out damage then chasing down one, then congratulations, it will.  This is how I play huntress, and let me tell you the bigger time sink is healing, and guess what healing does?  You guessed it, it synergises with anti healing like mangled and nurses, which mending does not.
---
In all, this addon would be no better than a normal hatchet in the most common instances, with only a minor gain in others.  It wouldn't be bad, but I'd say it was firmly, alright, and in fact, were it to exist, I would not pick it.
---
You seem to be under the impression that DW is a status that forces immediate action, when it doesn't.  You also seem to have the misguided belief that it will somehow get you downs, that people will somehow forget to mend and die.  Looking through your other posts on this matter it's quite clear you can't even see out of your eyes, but can only see the fantasy land you have constructed in your mind.  Have fun with that.
---
The devs is responsible for it by allowing toxic, unfair gameplay like camping and tunnelling to persist in the game. It breeds discontentment and creates unnecessary factions.
---
Yea that explains the massive different in playerbase and the devs giving up on the game and the F13 copyright owners not allowing the F13 devs to make new content anymore. You're so right.
---
It doesn't matter whether or not the killer was near him or looking at them tbagging is still tbagging and its a dick move
---
You missed my wrists
---
Its best to remember its only one match and you'll forget it in an hour or so. If you can handle it, give em a gg so that they won't laugh their ass of thinking they made you furious, but with some survivors I found myself unable to do so. Still, keel it civil and don't let them win the off screen fight
---
I just think it's stupid to lick a streamer's ass and have no opinion of your own
---
Yh I'm fine with that. I love being toxic as both killer and survivor. :)
---
Isn't that what Nea is. Except the average is turned to vandalism and resisting arrest.
---
A well executed DS
---
I understand why for insta-downs. But why moris?
---
Same thing happened to me...3 man swf we‚Äôre looping the killer (hag) around where their friends were hooked, kept farming each other, and ending up all just DCing...I got hatch and killer and I had a laugh about it when they called her a camper
---
Mostly paper mache and just plain paper for some
---
You look like that one kid from the Polar Express
---
I hooked an obsession and then maybe thirty seconds later got D-striked in the middle of a chase with another survivor. The obsession teleported to my side but still had her countdown.
---
We all kinda ... stood there. I hope they were laughing, because I was.
---
I've had a few times this week when someone will stare at Myers over a pallet. You can always see the moment they recognize the mistake. Wish Myers could raise an eyebrow.
---
The scariest thing is when you see him walking past a window
---
Probably so long that they might as well not do it if they're ballsy enough. You could even throw on thana for extra pain
---
Yes.
---
No shit. Sometimes golden opportunities just appear and you take them.
---
yeah but that might also be more detrimental than helpful since the vast majority of the time my teammates and I have cleansed all 5 totems anyway so no NOED procs at all
---
Thanks. Appreciate it.
---
Original: https://milliekou.tumblr.com/post/159416185463/original-x-terra-suggested-this-scenario-if
---
No it doesn‚Äôt, because it‚Äôs irrelevant to what I said. I‚Äôm not arguing about whether teabagging is something to be offended by, I‚Äôm saying that it IS a toxic thing to do.
---
Also the only person I‚Äôve argued with is a bot on a DC subreddit but you know hype aggressiveness is in this year so you‚Äôll be fine
---
Ghost Face main, can confirm
---
And he made sure to wash both faces before coming to the dinner table.
---
Oh just looked it up he‚Äôs in the game lol
---
If you didn‚Äôt care, you wouldn‚Äôt comment :^)
---
Blood? The pig should smell like a rotting pig head AND blood.
---
Michael probably hasn't showered in years, so he should smell absolutely awful.
---
Freddy probably has a permanent odor of burnt flesh.
---
Clown smells like rotting flesh.
---
‚Äúthe golden Chainsaw for coolest death would go to Dwight, he got moried brutally. However the dull machete for lamest death would go to Tapp, he just bled out to death on the hook‚Äù
---
If he didn‚Äôt hit you at the end he would have probably gotten the kill cause endgame
---
I think Friday the 13th is great but the developers of the game are really sloppy and don‚Äôt really ever do anything to fix anything. 
---
Maps are all kinda the same. You always fight the same killer. Voice chat makes it super fun‚Äî but dead by daylight has more long term viability imo.
---
While I agree, there's a difference between playing tryhard and being mean spirited. Survivors can go in expecting a prayer beads spirit, but then they play against a wraith without ruin and treat them like shit anyway. Granted, same goes for killers who torture survivors who didn't do anything wrong to them.   
---
I just know that I've  reached the point where I'm not playing low tier killers with fun builds anymore because regardless of what I do I get awful comments directed at me post game and on my steam profile.
---
Yes I‚Äôve noticed it too recently. I play on console
---
Yeah PS4 here.
---
For 4 dollars you can increase your hair size by 1/5 of an inch
---
I thought Bill would get hit then disconnect!
---
Yeah, about as much as a can of Axe body spray makes someone smell better after a three-day weekend bender without showering.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm goofing don‚Äôt worry lmao
---
This is exactly what has been missing from my life
---
I think this a joke post but devs stated they want to stay with humanoid like killers anyway
---
Idk much about the current cards out now, but I run DBD on ultra at 1080p with a GTX 970 overclocked to about 1400mhz. Mostly get 60 fps, but the card shows it‚Äôs age sometimes like when Freddy puts me to sleep it might go into the low 50s
---
So anything better than a 970 should be fine, which is probably most of the cards out today lol
---
Rightfully so! It's an impressive feat doing this, I did it before the adept change which made it way harder to achieve.  Congrats :)
---
Is there no way to block chat in game?

[DEVELOPER UPDATE | SEPTEMBER 2019
---
](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019)
---
&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;**We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain.** To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here‚Äôs how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* **If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor‚Äôs rank will be used for matchmaking purposes.** (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.) 
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. **This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.**
---
&gt;* **New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule** in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing. 
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt; If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other
---
Instead of the bell itS JOHN CENA
---
DUN DA DA DUUUUUUUUUN!!!!!
---
Turn off text chat and ignore players like that.
---
Friday was fun but the game has barely any support compared to DBD and the gameplay is way more clunky. Once I started playing DBD I never went back to Friday
---
Hate the hair
---
I used to love F13, but it‚Äôs way too buggy and the game isn‚Äôt finished. There‚Äôs a lot to be desired from F13 and at the end of day DBD is still a popular game after like 3 years and they‚Äôre still adding content so...
---
Nice bait, lol.
---
And people say the tier lists need to stop. Nay. This is golden.
---
It is relevant. The topic is about the toxicity of teabagging. My statement simply referred to whether one should be offended by the toxicity of it. So its still within the confines of the topic. As I said it was a general statement and most people who consider it toxic do get offended by it to the point they tunnel and camp you. You may disagree with the relevancy but I stand by my statement regardless
---
Not sure what you mean by two and don't know what that currency is worth compared to the usd.
---
Playing both sides is a huge part of improving. Observe the strongest survivors you play against to learn their strategies. Use those strategies to play survivor until you run into a killer that knows how to counter them, then learn from that killer and repeat the process. In order to catch the loopers, you must become the looper.  
---
  
---
I recommend [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QYjInzLeM) video to learn about running map tiles on survivor.
---
If bubba gets teleportation than can we give demo his chainsaw?
---
&gt;You are right... Not much to say. The matchmaking is trash
---
Matchmaking has improved significantly since the last [developer update](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019). To call it trash is simply overreacting or pure ignorance. 
---
The majority of my matches, even when playing with friends, have been precisely balanced according to their new system.
---
I figure if killers are aloud to have insta down add-ons, mori, and noed then survivors should be allowed to have insta heals as well, if you are a good killer you won't need these and if you are a good survivor you won't need them as well.
---
I fucking love jjba x dbd
---
*unzips pants * *sigh* here we to again
---
Okay, glad you solved it
---
&gt;Matchmaking seriously needs to be fixed. I'm getting matched up with rank 15's...I just got to rank 2!
---
Most likely someone playing SWF unless all 4 players are below rank 10.
---
Bro I‚Äôd be down, but as of right now I can‚Äôt play on weekdays
---
it's kinda bad... why should i get rank 5/4 survivors for this? it's not even fair.. wtf.. thank you for explaining anywayüíñ
---
Survivor main sad
---
Yea, this shit isn't old at all.
---
Welcome to the club!
---
A long time, forever freddy is so boring
---
The title itself was stupid enough but still decided to enter the thread. Stopped reading at:
---
&gt;Gen rushing?? Pfft that doesnt exist! Our stats for rank 20s prove other wise
---
So I hate to be that guy, but... You can literally leave after the match and not have to see the chat.
---
Yep, but I‚Äôm on a launch Xbox, Demo and Doctor are my worst ones FPS wise.
---
Fuck that. First, we need u/mcote_bhvr
---
Where is it already
---
I almost never get to use it since I‚Äôm either the first one found or a teammate saves me before I can use it
---
Ruin isn‚Äôt OP, shitty survivors just don‚Äôt know how to deal with it. Gens should be the first priority, and if someone comes across Ruin then get rid of it. Everytime a killer has Ruin every survivor runs off to look for it while I‚Äôm stuck doing all the gens. Usually by the time it‚Äôs found, I only got 2 gens done and everyone but me is on their second to last life üôÑ
---
He got released on console July 2019. 3 months isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfor awhile‚Äù.
---
im pretty sure they attempted that and it didn't work. and if every survivor spawns on one side, and the killer on the other, it would take even less effort to find the right totem. not to mention things like haunted ground that want to be cleansed
---
Gen rush don't exist
---
Possible you switched Freddy and Bubba?
---
They haven't even acknowledged prayer beads yet
---
I think he switched Bubba and Freddy, cus Bubba would eat human remains
---
Nice! Hey bro could you send me a picture of the hidden trophies, still don‚Äôt know what they are.
---
You‚Äôre right! No winning with the community
---
My friend can really only play on weekends lol
---
Why would it take you skill to rub a totem?
---
I‚Äôm not familiar with the Doki Doki one, but it seems pretty cool. The rest of the ideas are sweet. I hadn‚Äôt thought of the lipstick demon, that‚Äôd be a good one. He could potentially have some creepy tiny Tim [chase music](https://youtu.be/tEp-XtGOp0s)
---
&gt; Dead Hard works on every killer no matter what?
---
DH currently works about 50% of the time, so maybe this is the answer they've come up with?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt worry about not having all the perks other ppl have. There are quite a few I still want/don‚Äôt have because I don‚Äôt want to buy a survivor I don‚Äôt want and I didn‚Äôt know about teachable perks til I was dead set on prestiging my Kate üò™
---
It was better til the lawsuit stopped them from being able to add content
---
oh my god survivors doing their primary objective???? T O X I C GENRUSHERS 
---
start bringing noed if you legit get ran for 5 gens, idk.
---
Killers should use their power more during their moris in general.
---
Wraith could execute you while cloaked.
---
Huntress could let you run away but then throw a hatchet at your head, only to pick it up right after.
---
You know what I mean ?
---
Dedicated servers has literally nothing to do with that.
---
Maybe add like a 30 second cooldown
---
Instant main
---
oh yeah i meant more in terms of what those challenges are
---
It's fine just add the penis next time.
---
Maybe if you missed it late enough to where the circle disappears altogether it doesn't register as an attempt. Idk.
---
Half of my games it gets cleansed in 30 seconds but yes 19/20 :/
---
Get better at the game...?  Use perks to slow the game down.
---
We'll  
---
Be  
---
Right  
---
Back
---
lol it‚Äôs Rng some times u spawn on it.. you learn pretty quick where they the totem spawns and you can work through it pretty easy as well l... I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty balanced especially since if it‚Äôs that hard for u to find the totem or hit great skill checks bring a map
---
The style is legit though. Keep at this OP, I‚Äôm digging it.
---
But when I use something like that I get unmatched lol
---
Maybe you could do the icon for remember me idk it's pretty simple but would be perfect for a pumpkin I think
---
That is such bullshit lmao, in half my games everyone can't even find it till at least 2 gens are done.
---
4 hours according to this wacko^
---
And your rank is what?
---
Lmao what did I just read üòÇ
---
Domogorgon
---
rank 7 rn
---
Surprising that it lasts that long then lmao
---
That could be cool
---
Forever, hence the build name
---
Can confirm it‚Äôs usually cleansed in the first 5 min tops if not before then
---
Sorry if I took to long but yes that is a real add on
---
I play huntress a lot and i think this deep wound change would be cool. you can get so many hits out of your terror radius and if you multitask a little bit you waste so much extra time.
---
i don't know why people give you so much shit, maybe it's not the best change but it's definitely not Legion tier bad.
---
Edit: someone said 7K bloodpoints isnt worth the effect, maybe, but 7K points for a dc fest isn't worth aswell
---
Occasionally wouldn't have hurt.
---
Freddy wasn't originally a pedo. But I guess he did kills kids so BURN YOU PEDO!!!
---
It's a busted perk lmao
---
agreed
---
Real pros power through hex ruin.
---
My advice would be to play a lot of killer, get to at least purple ranks, and play a bunch of games with ruin. I guarantee you won't have this opinion anymore lol. I'm not saying its terrible at purple/ red ranks, but its no where near as good as it is below that. 
---
Once you start playing more experienced survivors they're going to be able to hit the great skill check fairly consistently as well as they'll have the map knowledge to find the totem a lot faster.
---
If you're at purple ranks you're well past the point where Ruin should still bother you.  You should be good enough to work through it at that point with minimal impact.  If not then practice your skillchecks man.  It should absolutely not be triggering you at your  current rank.
---
Or you're a busted survivor lmao
---
Imagine crying about a killer after over a year of her last tweak.. wow..
---
The Graboid (El Blanco preferably) as killers. Burt Gummer or Valentine McKee as survivor. Unforgiving almost completely barren map. Honorable mentions I liked but I prefered big worm: Beetlejuice, Tucker and Dale, The Horde and Mr Glass, and the Killer Klowns from Outerspace.
---
*Laughs hysterically*
---
Perks and add ons. Remove that and it'll be as balanced as csgo.
---
/s means sarcasm or joke btw
---
There is this perk called Small Game. Might be worth looking into for you.
---
I second this, just takes away the small boost from great skill checks
---
...............
---
From my experience my ruin gets destroyed within 2 minutes but when I'm survivor the thing is hidden so damn well .
---
Obviously:
---
Evan: Has a glass of warm milk and tries to go back to sleep.
---
Phillip: Quietly eats lightly salted peanuts.
---
Max: Gets drunk and destroys the kitchen.
---
Sally: Never gets up until 6 AM.
---
Michael: Stands in the kitchen all night waiting to surprise someone who wants a 2 am snack.
---
Lisa: Noisely devours raw liver.
---
Anna: Cooks a full meal and eats it all.
---
Herman: Cooks an entire meal but falls asleep before he can eat.
---
Leatherface: BBQ and Chili with extra human flesh.
---
Freddy: Cold meatballs.
---
Amanda: Goes out to McDonald's.
---
Kenneth: A mayonnaise and tuna sandwich.
---
Rin: Gnaws on celery like a rabbit until she falls asleep.
---
Joey: Cold leftover pizza.
---
Julie: Warm leftover pizza.
---
Frank: Orders a new pizza.
---
Susie: The bread sticks that came with the pizza.
---
Adiris: Goes out with Amanda but decides not to order anything when they get there, then complains she's hungry while Amanda eats.
---
Danny: Nibbles on sliced cheese.
---
Demogorgon: Dog food.
---
would you be open to some critique/suggestions? (i know the title says tell me what you think, but, still prefer to ask)
---
No, it's not BT. It's the status effect of BT (Endurance) w/o the need of being in a TR.
---
Dude if the killer is getting a 4 man in more than half of the games your role is fucking beyond broken lmao. Especially when half the games won are from the killer trolling and letting people win.
---
Ruin usually goes down within two minutes and even if it doesn't, it adds miniscule amounts of time for a killer, especially when they don't run anything else that helps regressing.
---
But yeah it's totally uncounterable and broken, sure. You evidently haven't seen what's actually broken. (Hint: It's usually nothing on the killer-beneficial, if it isn't a bug.)
---
Hard flex, but nice job.
---
Really cool buddy!
---
Long enough for the Self Care Gamers to blow the game for everyone.
---
This is console, and yes, I was also acknowledging the fact that they have been working on it.
---
but it gives you the deep wound status when you get hit, which ticks down when not in TR
---
Freddy has no TR when you're asleep, so you just bleed out and die in 15 seconds unless you mend. Which you can't because he's chasing you.
---
The only thing you can do is keep trying. Some people will kill themselves if they‚Äôre playing a losing match. If there‚Äôs only 2 left some suicide to give hatch to the other person.
---
I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre tunneling but that could be a reason as well.
---
Good luck on the trophy hunt :D
---
these are just my opinions and should be taken with a grain of salt, but:
---
- i would suggest moving the camera back and lowering the fieldofView, adjusting focaldistance and boosting the aperture so that the demo is slightly blurred while still keeping nancy in focus.
---
- weaken the intensity of the light and change the hue a little, i personally like going for a light bluey green for my stranger things renders. i would also add other light sources (potentially just a soft ring light could be nice)
---
i'm not entirely sure what's supposed to be happening in the image because of the perspective and size difference, could you explain the pose/concept?
---
Yeah, it takes them a long time to manufacture those bloodpoints.  They have to store up a lot before they can do a bloodhunt.
---
"Disgusting" is a very subjective term
---
As with adding James Janisse as a survivor, who would the killer be? I'm thinking someone from the non-movie horror seires on youtube he loves and mentions multiple times. Lemme try n find it really quick
---
-I think it's the Look-See from Crypt TV. What do y'all think about it?
---
You had me at no shirt
---
I learned about this channel like 3 weeks ago. He has some great video‚Äôs about all our favorite killers and their movies!
---
We need to get this man a job at bhvr
---
How is that toxic?
---
Downvotes cuz he's mad. It's okay, lil guy, life sucks for some of us. Letting out that anger is therapeutic. Let it all out
---
DJIWQBDCNAISCN
---
Not sure if this would help, but a really good pig player is Scorpionz. I don‚Äôt personally watch him, but he supposedly has a lot of good game footage for the pig.
---
Why dont they fix it or rework it?
---
I can hear this picture. And maybe a chainsaw revving in the distance.
---
You talking mad shit for someone in finger suck distance
---
To an extent, yeah. 8 or 9 hooks guarantees an iri for that badge.  (check the wiki, there's details on what causes progress for each. A lot of them are stupid imo)
---
Pc as well. Also doesn't help that it's my only surv daily in weeks. Just gone
---
You‚Äôre going to have to find someone in the UK that can buy you one. UK is the only place that still has some in stock, but it‚Äôs very limited as they‚Äôve been discontinued for quite some time.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the wraith too
---
I mean there's already a B movie snowman killer named Jack Frost they could use. I dig it.
---
Thanks
---
Thank you, I will try that. Nancy is supposed to just stand there while the demogorgon rises behind her and grabs her. Nancy is supposed to look like she just knows she is screwed and accepts her biter demise.
---
I can almost picture him spinning around in circles on the floor once he reaches it.
---
His perk ‚Äúkill count‚Äù grants him additional speed in all actions when he observes the killer hitting, hooking, and killing survivors by 5 percent each time he witnesses them
---
what am i looking at here?
---
Legit had a game against a tunneling spirit with mori, in end game chat she typed: "you can thank the previous survivors for this game", so what he said is 100% true
---
I specifically don't tunnel because I know it makes people upset lol.  Ill go across the map as soon as i hook so they don't think I'm camping, and still SD all the time.  Oddly enough pig and cannibal first try, which are the people I usually get DCs with haha.  
---
And thanks!
---
Why the downvotes
---
My idea for a key nerf is to make it so only the key holder gets the hatch.
---
Lets see if me and my squad ds u 10 times in single game LMAOOOO
---
You're a noob then and don't know what you're talking about lol. Nobody stands with you on this except baby survivors maaaaybe
---
No that‚Äôs not true. If you combine the ‚Äúscarred hand‚Äù and ‚Äúwaterlogged shoe‚Äù addons for Hag you get the benefits of both.
---
‚ÄúTrumps all other addons‚Äù means that In instances where 2 addons have conditions that dispute with each other (like if You tried to run scarred hand and mint rag on Hag, you would only get to benefit from scarred hand since any use of mint rag disputes with the conditions of scarred hand) then the addon that ‚Äútrumps all other addons‚Äù takes precedent.
---
Yeah because survivor mains never complain. Perfect little angels
---
this is great
---
Welp someone gets it! I hate seeing people actually defend it sometimes üòÇ
---
Nice flex btw haha
---
What
---
Man dedicated servers are needed. On console I always find 160+ games and I have 100mb/s download and upload so it's pretty dumb to get majority of matches with awful connection somehow.
---
Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed
---
I love getting downed by a fair perk
---
It has happened to me like 6 times I thought I was going insane
---
"Gen rushing doesn't exist! RABBLE RABBLE! NERF NOED! REMOVE THE NURSE! BUFF METTLE OF MAN! I WANT TO PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS! REEEE!"
---
That sums up the bulk of survivor main replies. The devs are only interested in selling us things to slow the game down. Hence why the best perks in the game that do this (Pop, Corrupt, Ruin, and Dying Light) are tied to characters you have to purchase. Three of which you could TECHNICALLY buy for free IF you're willing to do some insane grinding.
---
You guys are both toxic
---
???? Pretty telling about what? Dude your comment is so vague at least add some substance to the conversation before hitting the reply button. There's a reason the guy I replied to hasn't replied... bc him (and likely you) know nothing about how very few employees dev teams actually have. Especially in a small game like Dbd I'm sure they are trying to be as cost efficient as possible.
---
You're good. Just dm me on any weekends and I'll notify them.
---
And as if him just camping for the pity kill wasn‚Äôt enough he moonwalks around the hook and slashed me as if he actually outplayed me. So annoying
---
True...but f13 has ALOT more kills
---
Doesn‚Äôt clear shit up, you didn‚Äôt contribute shit either.
---
It does, it's just not what people "think" it is. It's not the gens simply getting done quickly. That's not genrush, that's the killer not putting ANY pressure on gens. Genrush is when survivors literally ignore everything else over gens. I've experienced it a handful of times. I'm talking people not healing, not doing totems (not even ruin sometimes), and not even fucking unhooking. It's a boring form of gameplay.
---
That's a watermelon
---
Because there is a lot of counter play and you need skill to use them well, to use an insta heal you just press a button.
---
Does that mean you‚Äôre also me?
---
Because that's how you start a discussion as you claim you were doing. Not by making a false statement. Come on man everybody here knows what you were doing so just stop, you're embarrassing yourself at this point.
---
As I always say traps aren‚Äôt gay but stepping in them is
---
That's exactly why I love it so much üòÅ
---
Too true üòÅ
---
Yeah but you're the problem with this community. It's not funny to make somebody Rage Quit for any reason. Even if they were being toxic.
---
Thats gen rush but most people call gen rushing them being too stupid to apply pressure. But in your case thats dull
---
Probably just because they don‚Äôt involve ranged weapons. Also, Billy‚Äôs chainsaw takes a fair bit of skill to use, and Bubba‚Äôs has some hefty downsides.
---
I've never seen such a salty survivor before
---
What rank? I always have a hard time finding a survivor game on PS4 during the night time. I'm rank 2. Takes ages. On switch however, the matchmaking is very fast.
---
I completely agree. I also like how he response as if Nea doesn't have cosmetic that legit aren't just shirt and pants you know like Neon nea
---
Mine was a large but I'm a medium so it's got a bit of wiggle room, I'd say it's pretty true-to-size but get it one up if you like hoodies a bit baggy üòÅ
---
I feel like they make meme perks specifically to counter meme perks/ add-ons. Ohh the killer brought Spies from the Shadows? Good thing I have Calm Spirit. Survivor's brought Sabatour? Good thing I brought Hangman's.
---
It's lame. At this point I feel like we just need categorized slots or let killers have 5 slots or something game changing. Survivors pretty much always use an Exhaustion Perks and Killer needs Ruin/Slowdown perk.
---
Thank you! üòÅ
---
I don't watch Spongebob or look at deep fried memes, looks like a rock to me.
---
I think it's silly when people rage quit, notice I didn't say "making people rage is funny". But I don't see how that's awful but you give toxic players a pass.
---
üòé
---
Tier lists for DBD are sort of like Buzzfeed quizzes and articles
---
This is adorable! My current girlfriend and I really started hitting it off when we learned we both liked the game. Glad to see that I‚Äôm not the only one :)
---
And just now tonight since I started the game 30 minutes ago I've gotten disconnected from host three times once I was in a lobby with other people in it. And then the Game just crashed with an unknown error. WTH is going on?
---
Who?
---
What killer are you playing?
---
Its console so it's still p2p
---

Nea cosplay guys!
---
Cool post. Upvoted!
---
Can I be the entity?
---
i remember when i played leatherface for fun, i didnt even put addons, and they were swf who teabagged me and were being toxic saying gg ez in the end game, next match i played michael myers with op addons and i didnt even tunnel or camp just to add salt to the wound and i wrote gg when i got 4k and they didnt even write gg back.
---
Urban is the only one I don‚Äôt agree with but I agree with everything else.
---
We don't know the exact numbers behind the add-ons. Here's a guess based on numbers we do know:
---
"Slightly" is usually 5%. So with four survivors asleep, Swing Chains would apply a 20% debuff. Jump Rope's "considerably" could be 20%, like it used to be. We know that Sloppy Butcher is 25%. For an altruistic or Med-Kit self-heal, that's 16 * 1.25 = 20 * 1.2 = 24 * 1.2 = 28.8 seconds; on a Self-Care self-heal, it's 57.6 seconds, so basically a minute of healing.
---
THE IRIDESCENT STONE DEMANDS A SACRIFICE
---
Is there an option to turn off chat? Because if there is, do it. They want to trigger you with those words and it worked. You're better than that. Ignore it.
---
Everyone wants something different. I personally would rather see more gameplay discussion than cosplay.
---
One time i downed a David and he disconnected immediately. What i did was simply moonwalk and mindgame him.
---
His teammates tho, they were solid af, they were very organized + were extremely good at looping. I was a demogorgon, but i wasn't very able to use shred and hit them and i kept finding at least one of them so i couldn't place any portals.
---
It ended up with all 3 of them escaping, the David could've won too but nope, he decided to disconnect simply because he got outplayed.
---
Play both sides people, experience both sides of bullshit
---
Susies face, I would pay a hefty sum
---
Awesome!
---
Currently Billy, but they dont like Micheal either, apparently
---
Awesome meme, but as a 400 hour clown player i say keep trying the shit killer
---
Those perks are really hard to grind and it will take a lot of time if I won‚Äôt learn to play The Nurse
---
Man if you‚Äôre getting hit with DS five times in one game....
---
Insert oof sound bite here.
---
sorry i'm new what's a 4.4 killer
---
That is adorable. Congratulations!
---
I may experiment with this tomorrow as I have most perks and kinda getting bored levelling up the last few. It would be nice though if it suggested a Killer/Survivor to play too but not everything's perfect.
---
Or have it only apply instadown to the first 6-10 hatchets thrown.  The rest after that are normal.
---
I did a game as level 1 cannibal for my quest. Obv it's dogshit using chainsaw on ps4 as a noob so i couldnt down anyone. I couldn't hook anyone and I got these dumb ass messages too. Like wow gg you beat a level 1 killer so fair, fuck off -_-
---
&gt;Getting decisive strike 5 times in one game
---
When you're being such a hard face camper that even the Entity decisive strikes you.
---
Omg yeah xD
---
That's what I mean. If you're using your hatchet for a close range hit you're better off using leather face. 
---
The only advantage is her range. Which means you have to aim and try to hit which"balances" out
---
Better sleep with lights on tonight.
---
"Not my fault you were all identical P3 Claudettes"
---
This came from personal experience. The only way I could tell the difference was with how much stalk juice was left in them.
---
I believe he was also in an actual episode of the look-see too, so that would be perfect.
---
4 slippery meats
---
And Billy and Bubba deals with pallets and can instantly go reuse their power where if you dodge the axe she can't use it until she restocks
---
A very simple way of finding people is to just patrol a path around the generators. If you can't outsmart a survivor at a pallet then just go ahead and break it, demo can do this quick with his shred. Some pallets should be broken immediately due to being really strong like the one at the shack or any pallet that has a long path to the other side.
---
Fucking survivors should just spawn on the hook.
---
I play both Surv and Killer equally, can we just... get over... this whole ‚Äúcrutch perk‚Äù waa for survivor and killer because it‚Äôs really old dude. 
---
If you won every game, it‚Äôd be boring and there‚Äôd be no point to the thrill you feel for the wins. It‚Äôs just a game. The game has challenges within the game itself, including NOED. There‚Äôs a counter to it, 
---
It‚Äôs just a game man, let it go.
---
Welcome to DBD this has been a problem with the game since it came out.
---
Clown, what was the juiciest finger you tried and from who?
---
When you need a med kit and you find that in the chest or a green map xD
---
I am playing mostly Trapper right now and OoO users are getting on my nerves, disarming or even sabotaging all my traps.
---
So now I am either using bloody coils whenever avaible and stick close to my traps or I just play Trapper as a (surprisingly effective, at least in green ranks) M1 pallet eating killer that clears the map and then kills everyone because there are no pallets left.
---
How does Object make you toxic? It is an overpowered perk when used in conjunction with SWF, but I fail to see how it makes the player toxic.
---
And proceed to race each other to the exit gate
---
That's....not a bad perk idea.
---
It might help to unlock tracking perks if you can from the other killers.
---
Spies from the Shadows, Predator are good for when I lose people constantly even though there‚Äôs scratch marks.
---
If people are finishing gens, Bitter Murmur is great (it‚Äôs basically the gen version of BBQ)
---
Toxic = Communication and/or behavior which influences someone to harm themselves AND has no point except to make a person have a negative emotion.
---
This means items, perks, and killers people don't like and camping and tunneling are NOT toxic as well. If you think any of these are toxic, you should play a different game as you can not control what human players do.
