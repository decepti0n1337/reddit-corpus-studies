Yes, haha. I mean I do really like this concept, though. I think it would be cool if they made it so that while in a chase, you’re exposed is the killer is on your screen?
---

---
I often turn around while in chases to gauge how far the killer is from me.
---
---
---
That's ridiculous!
---
8:88
---
That's a difficult face to make IRL
---
I mean this guy kinda killed himself though. He tried to escape and than barely struggled
---
And as far as I could tell his teammates were pretty close, but I was near the hook because there was a gen nearby they worked on recently
---
I sometime run low on material
---
What can I say I digress. (Also I was never around for any of these memes)
---
And it's only like 2
---
Makes me want to vomit.
---
Yeah I am kicking myself for not getting all the Adepts before. I only got about half of them. 
---
5 of them were from samimation 
---
Yeah I’m not the best at killer 
---
Yes. SWF have an advantage. 
---
Yes. You can still have fun as a killer. 
---
OP, I love your content. It's very funny. :)
---
In your bizaroo dream?
---
This is like my 4th time killing all of them this is the only game no one d/ced and it still didn’t work.
---
Sadly I’ve seen two actual Myers that had noed on them, and they weren’t using scratched mirror. 
---
You don't go around 99%ing each gen instead of fully repairing one because you think the match is going too fast for your opponent to have fun. You're acting like an entitled hypocrite. 
---
In that case, what they're doing is shitty. But if OP didn't even try then....
---
So true its still hurting.
---
Out of 14. Cut me some slack
---
Sorry, I didn’t mean to say it as if I was calling you out on something
---
I completely understand people that play optimally, it’s just my preference to make games last longer than necessary by giving myself little challenges
---
Bobby I tell you what, in my bizaroo dreams I'm doing a lot more than just playing Dead by Daylight.
---
I can agree to the add on part on either killer or survivor, except of course *looks at franks mixtape* yeesh
---
Or dc
---
Even on console it is now frame droopy. 
---
I’m a survivor main but there were tons of them in line so I went killer to skip the line. Now I understand my mistake haha 
---
I was crying when he reset the loop at 1:02 in the video. He was about to end the loop but decided to just keep doing a “no u” the whole time.
---
It’s because it’s way too hard to rank up as survivor compared to killer. I haven’t seen a rank 1 survivor in a long time.
---
sounds like an exploit to me 
---
Wait? Killers get bloodpoints for a DC, even if they DC?
---
The fact that you think Lerys is actually real actually speaks more about your mental imbalance more than anything else. 
---
No no, I didn’t take it that way at all.  Nothing personal here either
---
Just my own thoughts lol
---
If you enjoy your play style, thats all that matters. It just personally doesn’t fit with me haha. 
---
You’re so smart, I totally forgot about boil over
---
He just wants to dump on DBD because he doesn't like it. Eh.
---
Savage.
---
Everyone is talking about the Seabear but all I can think of is that one south park episode where Cartman shoots Token
---
Technically he’s not; just do the final generator.
---
Groovy
---
Git gud
---
Noooooo GOD Please god noooo, NOOOOOOOOOO
---
Did you not see the whole “or more for killers?” And tbh, bloodpoints as a survivor aren’t that bad, unless at red it gets impossible, then I wouldn’t know.
---
There was. I had prosthetics but one big piece fell off after the competition because it kept getting stuck in the dress and the others I peeled off since this was taken right before I was gonna go home :3
---
Thanks!~
---
The ghosts of Bloodhunt Past, Blood Hunt Present and Blood Hunt yet to come...
---
There needs to be a time limit in this game. 20 maybe 30 mins MAX. Tired of hatch standoffs and hostage games. From survivors crouch walking around the map with exits open to killers blocking people in corners, it’s all shit. Cannot think of a reason why there shouldn’t be
---
watch out, the salty killer mains are coming to disagree
---
Thanks! I update my Instagram more if you’re interested in looking there! I’m also very active when it comes to uploading work in process photos~
---
Thank you very much. :)
---
I'm a full blown survivor main, tunnelling and camping annoy me unless it's because I've pissed off the Killer to the point they're doing it to get me then I find it amusing.
---
I do find it jarring how survivors act entitled if they do well, and bitch out for not being given the hatch, like okay you played well? But not enough to get out. Survivor mains (saying this as one) genuinely disgust me at points. 
---
Adrenaline rewards you for doing your objective noed is the opposite rewards trash gameplay 
---
You can use whatever perks you want! It's not the best choice as Myers, but it's a good way to catch brave survivors off guard! So if that's what you want to use, go for it! 
---
Awesome thank you for the explanation!! 
---
No it's more like "Why are you such a disappointment son and when are you going to be as smart as your cousin"
---
Wall lengths were changed to make some dropped pallets less safe so killers can actually mindgame at dropped pallets in most places (other than cold wind, which still needs to be fixed). If the loop is too long, that means the killer can’t double back on a dropped pallet and catch the survivors on the opposite side.
---
The worst thing is when you're about to unhook them, but then the killer sees you-- so you have to make the shameful run the whole way because the killer has NoED. :( 
---
*MR. MOSBY?!*
---
most of the time, i'm that kind of player
---
I think I made rank 15 (killer) my first day with the game, though I have to admit that was something of a marathon session (6-8 hours). Not exactly much time, either way.
---
Rank 5-10 is all over the place. Mostly because rank still doesn't mean anything and it will never mean anything with the current emblem system because the emblem system doesn't measure how bad you beat the other side's ass it measures like 25% how bad you beat the other side's ass and 75% how much farming you got to do while you were at it. And then everyone resets to 10 or higher every month. I get games against absolute potatos and I get games against SWF toolbox swat teams. I came back two resets after the Legion update broke sound, so I was rank 15 on a free weekend. Oof. I climbed my way back to red ranks, never stopped seeing babies at any point. Double oof.
---
Rank is just a monthly playtime badge. Sure, good players climb faster, but everyone climbs, because the emblem measures farm more than it measures skill. Play enough and you'll get there. Well, the new changes mean it's way more RNG at red ranks than skill, especially for survivors. Killers can deliberately farm when there are 1-2 survivors left to sort of guarantee a pip, but survivors can't really control a game like that. If you let a killer hook you so your friend can farm the rescues they need to pip maybe you ain't gettin' off that hook.
---
It was an offering from a year or two back that they removed from bloodwebs. They decided the green map offerings were sufficient and less rarer were a waste of bloodpoints.
---
Because You’re an idiot who doesn’t read
---
You're a little late on this meme bud. 
---
DS is dog shit now and you're not even likely to have to face it as killer unless you hard tunnel every game.
---
Killers are definitely in the best position they’ve ever been. Sprint burst constantly in chases, perma sabo, every window being infinite, quad instant DS, etc. Those were some rough times to play killer.
---
the fact that you were so hurt to make this comment actually speaks more about how you don’t belong on the internet and special you are than anything else. 
---
where did i say it was real? do you really think people think that a map from a fucking bad game exists? how fucking stupid do you have to be to even assume that? who hurt your feelings to the point in commenting this garbage on an obviously sarcastic comment on this bullshit reddit page? man, you have some serious issues and you might want to get those checked out. 
---
I play survivor main, I only really do killers for daily challenges, and couldn't agree more with this. I don't think most survivors are entitled, but the ones that are are very vocal
---
120 movement speed, tall point of view, he has no speed penalty while carrying survivors and can carry more than one. 
---
What was kinda awesome. I wanted to ask if you have more of these, you already linked your YT Thingie. Soooo, let's have a look!
---
“just let that shit mutilate her white ass and leave”
---
&gt; NOED rewards gameplay*
---
Every killer benefits from it proccing, and Killers can't ensure it procs or stays up without sacrificing a ton of pressure. NOED is reliant on survivors pushing through gens and not cleansing / not cleansing it at the end of the match.
---
Aside: If your team actually dies after a killer directs their pressure towards protecting a totem all match, you're pretty much boosted.
---
Separate game modes just splits the player base further and makes queues even longer. It won’t help the odd complaint people have that sometimes they face people better than them.
---
I have nearly 3000 hours in.  You've done nothing but talk out of your ass ignorant of the changes with Plague and look completely braindead in the process.
---
A small update, like one of the hot fixes? I have been getting DC'd every match since plague update so just curious.
---
It seems pretty likely that we'll get some kind of licensed cosmetics, either for previous chapters or ones to come. 
---
You have, that's a lot of time invested :P. Not sure how you can main Nurse for so long, I got bored of her after a couple hundred hours as my main. 
---
wait, for you it exists?
---
Or they just came back after a year long hiatus lol
---
How do I post something?
---
Nah, I think Alpha or Beta would be the best fit
---
The pamtri sea bear video is better
---
I love the feeling of making survivor cry because there toxic when there not I go easier on them plus she’s really the only strong killer 
---
I can confirm this bug as I have it as well. No fix yet, hopefully they are working on it. I get DC'd from every match since plague update. I lost 4 ranks before giving up.
---
It doesn’t matter if they’re bad at the game. They set the rules- therefore, if they say Legion is part of the game, Legion is part of the game. 
---
You can say it’s OP (you’d be wrong), or you could say boring (truth), but you can’t say they’re not a part of the game- that’s not up to you. You agree they make the decisions when you agree to the EULA and play.
---
And make it a separate queue.
---
If this hasn't been answered for you yet, go to the kill your friends menu. Select survivor, and you should easily find his perks with a simple scroll through. No need for other players if you just want to look around. 
---
Gosh that's so bad of those survivors. Let the killer play what the want holy heck. I'm glad they let you escape though, shows that he's a good sport.
---
there's always THAT guy
---
There is also a new killer ?
---
Same problem 😭
---
At least the game will end.
---
NOED can reward any killer. Not just bad ones. It needs to be changed where it only triggers if a killer played well throughout the whole game.
---
Adrenaline should be the same way. If you’re just running around injured and suddenly you’re healed and get 5 whole seconds of extreme speed? Just cuz someone popped the last gen? Yeah no.
---
Both perks reward good and bad players. They both need to be tweaked to reward just good gameplay.
---
OH GOD KILL IT WITH FIRE!
---
Go do a gen.
---
Capitalism.
---
No worries. When you load in it will be 80-120 and then randomly spike up to 280-320.
---
The new matchmaking made like a good 75% of my survivor lobbies into 300+ red ping nightmares, so for that reason I’m glad they reverted it because it has seemed to even out since. I won’t even consider anything above 150. Can’t wait for dedicated servers.
---
Bloodhound or Predator could really help with stalking survivors through that, but the easiest way is to strafe through the corn while following the scratch marks and listening for the survivor. It's def not easy when you don't play killer often.
---
May I ask why you love it ?
---
Well that happens to everybody tbh. My point is it only buffs lower tiers and not high tiers so not many games would be affected. To me it just gives you a hand after prestiging a character or get a character on its feet. It may harm lower rank games but new players probably wouldn’t buy Hag (pc) or use Hag out of the like 7(?) starting killers for Console. You can stay longer on the gen no? It would be a very low regression so you could power through it.
---
Negan would fit right in dbd unlike a certain other game cough cough.
---
Awwww wish we could have seen it before it fell off! You make a great looking plague lmao you even look tall af like she does too
---
What would this do? All survivors work the same so would it go by perks? If that’s the case we would have dozens of categories and it wouldn’t work. 
---
Go do a gen and go back
---
No like when you queue up as survivor it tells you that there is like a ration of 7:1 survivors to killers so you should switch to killer.
---
Fuzzymafia
---
Adrenaline is very situational unless a SWF is specifically setting up for its use, noed is not. 
---
3*
---
What did he say?
---
Ohhh my bad, completely misunderstood. That would be nice to see.
---
I feel as though more survivor mains need to do this as well...  
---
Can’t can’t the number of people (even irl) who never touch killer
---
I have a friend who has never played killer once and didn’t even know about scratch marks until I told him lol, he would just always complain about the killer finding him and such... 
---
Worst part is, he played the game even before I did.
---
DS literally just got nerfed to hell. So no. 
---
There's Ohmwrecker as well (I think) 
---
Exploit would be moonwalking and I’m assuming by break the game he means avoid the base game mechanics? I wouldn’t consider it breaking the game but that’s what I got from the post. 
---
Adrenaline is a good perk. However, I do wish it didn’t wake people up. I know there’s the whole “but it makes sense” argument but if that were the case then Wake Up! should wake you up. This game isn’t meant to be realistic. Other than that I think Adrenaline is fine, it rewards you for doing your objective. 
---
Just make yourself puke on command and it's perfect.
---
Unfortunately, matchmaking is bad. Lol
---
Yeah on console there are massive survivor spikes so it takes like 4 times the amount of time to queue up. I usually swap to killer. That longer queue time made me a killer main. When I first got dbd I thought I had a glitch so I played Billy for like 4 hours straight and then finally waited out my queue to play as survivor for the first time.
---
Oooooh. Thanks for clarifying that.
---
I just want them to move swf out of ranked. Have ranked and casual modes plus there's always kyf.
---
Yeah, Rotten Fields is probably my least favorite along with Wretched Shop. They both absolutely suck. 
---
That’s understandable lmao, I thought parts of the costume were photoshopped tbh.
---
Sometimes, when a gen is almost done. The killer is right on top of me, there's only a sliver left...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
My life... for POWAH.
---
We're not interested, thanks
---
I like having holidays, thanks 
---
I'm a Nea main and I use dark sense, urban evasion, balanced landing and lightweight, but I'm thinking of changing it up a bit. 
---
I absolutely am, it's still bonkers efficient.
---
just do a gen next time, wtf 
---
Which one?
---
Because Ebony Mori only requires you to hook them once then down them again for the kill, and DS gave you four chases before you were out of the game.
---
COMMIT
---
CCOOMMMMIIIIITTTTTT
---
And then none of the other 3 go back to save you off the hook
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
That actually does sound like a fantastic idea. 
---
Ok so i looked at the page With all the "Rick" quotes and turns out you're right (Looks like some peeps were pointing it out there too)
---
Bad data is far worse than no data.
---
I got into a game yesterday where i couldnt move to the left or right because i constantly was in struggle mode 
---
He pointed out the title. I put two and two together 
---
what map is that?
---
Haha nah. Only edit on this picture is that I cropped it a little bit due to the walls looking odd. It’s all makeup and props. 
---
Yeah, that and the ability to change Chase Music and have various cosmetic choices like stickers and dolls (maybe not the pets because they give survivors away easily as they all fly.) are literally the best things about Identity V.
---
Data isn't bad just because it contradicts your beliefs
---
let me guess, tuft and tombstone?
---
So... if you dc at a rate that it’s an issue, maybe you should sort your computer out a bit more before playing? 
---
For your own sanity and others in the game
---
I play on PS4, but I had shoddy internet before and had to use WiFi as well, which didn’t help, so I’d get bad connections and dc a lot
---
After finally accepting that I’m just not meant to play atm, I had a much happier life after I simply went to to store after a week of not playing when I had time and I got a wired connection to my system... had to run the line through my entire house, that’s why it took so long, but damn was it worth it lol. 
---
Did you make this yourself? 
---
you dc? you had ONE gen left, you could've fixed it and possibly escape. Don't blame devs, that's your own stupidity, I'm sorry
---
I'd left the spirit put some holes in me. 
---
*Mami*, **SUCC my soul out.**
---
Hey! 
---
I never dc, don’t hate all Feng’s :0
---
Also my most dcs I get are from nea, Dwight and David 
---
Yes it’s at the opposite end of the generator across the basement
---
Yup! Everything is made by my hands! ^ ^
---
I loved that game, it was like Friday the 13th but softer.
---
It looks like she took the kids too.
---
Can confirm, the quote on the first level of Mori is...
---
"You have done well, the last one is yours." 
---
Though you could also argue that the when you Mori a survivor while the others are still alive and present, it would diminish their hope as their friends and allies fall one by one. 
---
I bet normal means "how they think the game should be played"
---
Yeah. You can make actually fair, good builds out of 3 perks in a SWF unlike 4 perks where you have to use cancer builds to bully killers because you aren't good
---
You have to hook everyone 3 times iirc
---
Mine was fixed on a hot fix, hers sadly still persist. But yes plague is when it started.
---
what kinda bs is that
---
Fake news my cheeks have been clapped by multiple times by susies
---
Is this why we call him Daddy?
---
Because he's in **large** *and in charge?*
---
Lol yeah...iri heads and ebony, real fair game. It’s best if everyone just leaves. Might as well get the ball rolling.
---
wait so the spirit just has daddy issues?
---
I knew I had a type but damn.
---
A lack of understanding of how I explained the matchmaking and, again, the requirement to play ranked is probably why it was not upvoted very much.
---
No one wants to get pointed at when you pop a gen.
---
The killer should get full 3 hook kill for a dc, and the points that come with that, also add in some points for lost chase times and such they could’ve had...
---
I feel like, if a killer got rewards heavily for a dc, people who purposefully dc wouldn’t do it as often... I swear, most people o see dc like to say “it’s not fun so I dc”, but truthfully, most of the people to dc are just trying to spite the killer... so if the killer gained their kill with all the points that game with it, I almost guarantee there would be less dcs... possibly more suicides on hooks, but less dcs 
---
I don't mind giving a company I like my money, even if the outfits are overpriced. I just wish they'd improve the quality of the game instead of adding a bunch of random stuff.
---
Using your flashlight to blind killers at pallets does 3 things.
---
1. It allows you to gain bloodpoints via blinding the killer. Good way for building up your boldness category.
---
2. Blinding a killer is good in that by the time the killer breaks the pallet, they have no idea what direction you have went. This can go one of 2 ways. They either go the wrong direction or wait until the blindness effect disappears to then look for you. By then you have made more distance than before. Or 2 they break the pallet but they can hear your footsteps or they take an educated guess at where you are heading. This overall leads to you losing distance.
---
3. You piss the killer off. A good side objective &amp; discourages them from breaking the pallet. 
---
Overall its a decent strategy. The blindess can really throw killers off from your position giving you a free escape, especially if there is a window or wall near the vault. If you are unlucky then the killer might have headphones that are good enough to track your footsteps through the chase music. At that point, you risk getting hit after the pallet is broken. 
---
Would suggest you use flashlight add-ons that extend the blindness duration. Will make the strategy more effective. Some experienced survivors like zubatlel can maintain the blindness by flash lighting again before the killer fully recovers, which maintains the blindness effect even after the killer breaks the pallet.
---
When I play killer if a flashlight is shone on me when I break a pallet it doesn't bother me that much because it's gone more or less by the time I break the pallet. I just have to follow the survivors scratch marks. 
---
It's not toxic though. Its just part of the package of using flashlights. Aside from flashlight saves you don't get many opportunities to use flashlights.
---
60-6 seconds left: green-yellow ping
---
5 seconds left: 700 ping
---
No the worst is getting 3-4 safe unhooks for them and doing 3 gens and catching the noed for your first hook while they sit at the exit gates to protect their MAYBE black pip
---
Am sorry have i missed something I thought he wasn't even really confirmed yet. Did they do a official reveal at pax.?
---
Her backstory is that her stressed out father started killing both her and her mother, and in her anger as to what was happening The Spirit made a deal with The Entity for revenge.
---
This was me yesterday. I went to go for a flash save and the dude got fuckin moried instead. Felt like an idiot. Played extra scared for it to just be a green &gt;:(
---
Exactly. And if it's a doctor map or the game you'd be untouchable
---
i’ve literally lost 2 ranks on survivor playing like i normally would or just straight up getting tunneled there’s no in between today
---
Ayy it’s you again!
---
Looks great!
---
Coldwind Farm is my favorite map as a survivor. When i Played killer, I was ready to kill someone. Unfortunately, I didn’t.
---
Ooh okay, I hardly ever go over there. Is it supposed to be a salt ring?
---
I love this bug. Happened to me not too long ago too.
---
I like the perks! Take an upvote
---
Have you tried turning it off and on?
---
I refuse to pristiege some of my characters to hold on to these gems,
---
Sorry bud, no way you were getting this for free. They got to pay back somehow. :P
---
I did and that didn’t work, I even tried putting it in rice.
---
I like playing as hag, patrol near the hatch with traps and they usually run in. 
---
Can you explain that a little bit?
---
*Vomits*
---
Hmm, call the fridge company.
---
It's speed too. DS skill check is faster (at least the old one was, idk about the new one).
---
Honestly I just seriously want them to add the whole Scooby doo gang (besides Scooby doo himself) with the Creeper or the Zombie as the killer. Or at least Shaggy. 
---
I agree. I think it depends on each game. Obviously you should try to drag each loop as long as possible but if this gets all the gens done and everyone escapes then good deal, but for sure I agree to drag it out more because insta dropping them doesnt work at higher ranks. This person didnt respect pallets at all.
---
Exactly. This is why I like running blood warden sometimes--it really makes them pay for this behavior. 
---
This is exactly what I wanted to write.. _INFINITES ARE STILL IN THE GAME_ /s
---
Everything is on point. Even the neck, perfect for seeing over any corn.
---
Every other teamgame out there handicaps premades, every single one. Except DBD of course.
---
You could take perk slots away, or addons/offerings. Reduce the players movement speed or decrease the killers terror radius for the premades. Pick your poison, its not like you cannot balance around SWF, its that the devs don't want to.
---
That's actually a biohazard, I'm pretty sure. Sorry 
---
Not sure whether to play Dead by Daylight and rage at the busted mechanics or play Borderlands 1 Remastered and actually have fun HMMMMMM
---
right. sometimes i just stop playing and go do something else. one time i left for 20 mins and came back and he hadnt left so i reported him for hostaging and went over there lol
---
YES
---
When you upvote a meme but now it's at 421
---
Dwight: Lie back down
---
I believe the Trapper’s name was actually originally Chuckles, or that’s what his name was in the game files or something. 
---
Im going to just say the same thing others say, its annoying but it works
---
But if i was that killer and if i caught you i would camp you. 
---
Teabagging I got over quickly but yes please, just leave the fucking game
---
basically me as a killer without the dc. i can’t figure out how to commit and will end up leaving and finding a new survivor. i stick to playing killer now when it’s just a group of friends. 
---
I’m try to finish that last achievement : Take one for the team... it’s bs to try this rn.. But yeah I know what you mean
---
We had yellow map offerings too. Sadly, I have none left. They got rid of them shortly after I started playing, and I have prestiged everyone at least once since then. 
---
I love to think that they're shitting themselves and that's why they're butt-dancing. 
---
"Sometimes it's hard to explain what you need to know quickly", so because you and your friends are not capable or fully utilizing coms that means they are not perfect? Ever watched Marth stream with the depip squad? They manage to beat rank 1 killers without items/perks and everybody is running no mither.
---
Comms need to be present in 5 player teams, unless you have shared information like LoL. Can you imagine CSGO without comms for randoms? 
---
I agree. If you want to have a hatch stand off go for it because to some extent both players need to be stubborn to make it a stand off and either one is free to make the choice that will end the game whenever they want. They really should make some kind of patch where there is a definitive winner in those situations though. 
---
If you equip the perk empathy it helps out a bit.
---
They must all be terrible killers then. You're doing what you're supposed to be doing... surviving.  I'm a killer main by the way. I was cringing the entire time watching this killer. You're gonna get salty messages no matter what. 
---
Earlier today, I was sent a voice message that said "a rank 3 killer and you have to tunnel". I was literally across the map, chasing someone else and hooking them, going back to a gen I knew was being worked on and would hear a hook being sabotaged. The guy did this THREE times and was the sole reason I knew where he was. He was a lower rank so I just didn't bother arguing after that and blocked him. Plenty of idiots to go around in this community.
---
Stopped reading after "DC suggestion"
---
Shit
---
Lmao. No. There's nothing stopping this survivor from running off and doing the remaining gen.
---
Its not toxic, but some things to mention:
---
\- a good killer will still track you by hearing, so you dont win any time(distance) by blinding, its the opposite  you loose distance.
---
\- you wasting the pallets way too early, it didnt matter against this killer but against a good one you will have problems later in the game, when you throw down pallets that quick
---
\- you cutting the corners way to wide while running around obstacles which let the killer catch up to you faster
---
\- why  did the spirit even brake the pallets and did not use her power to go around and get you, as being said it works against average killers like this one, but a good one will down you fast and probably kill the whole team coz there wont be any pallets left.
---
oh and adjust emblems to reflect a safety pip for what a decent player accomplishes more than a farmer that gets chased every once in a while off the gen he kinda works on
---
I agree with the first two, but that should happen regardless of a dc problem
---
The double depip I don’t like
---
Because, people would then use that to purposefully depip to get lower ranks easier... which I don’t necessarily like as for one, more dcs from those people, and two... playing outside of your rank yo stomp on newbs 
---
I think my idea is more based around rewarding the players who stick it out and play the game and not giving anyone who dcs the pleasure of knowing they spited anyone... so it completely neuters trolls from dcing... so the only dcs that make it past that are genuine accidental dcs or salty people dcing
---
I also think this should happen AFTER they fix matchmaking and rank, but I still stand by my fix 
---
I prefer it if I'm playing someone like clown who can just Chuck bottles at survivors for points.

i didnt get a good picture of the hook (somehow i fucked that up yes i know) 
---
The survivor is also refusing to end the game.
---
or do gens, I could accept it if they honored me by continuing the gen rush. 
---
But alas, they do not.
---
No
---
You cannot even edit your title post. Nice one bud. There was no reasons to put 'update' when it wasn't an update. 
---
Nice Plagg cosplay
---
Ok then lol
---
Yeah, I posted it after it all happened. I did it like that on purpose, cause that’s how we all feel after something like that happens 😂 It ain’t that deep. 
---
Nope, it was the first 2 minutes of the match. 
---
Yes you gonna lose your 100% when there are new achievements added. 
---
But usually the new achievement are not hard to get, so you will get 100% easily again.

Fun being able to do nothing against high rank nurse and billy. Makes me want to uninstall every day and every day I come back.

with plague i just puke on things. one time i got the bar all the way for contagious lol

Susie is best girl 
---
it's literally in the contract behaviour signed that ash needs to be paid for. the only way they can get him in the game is by sharing profits with the license holder.
---
But did you cut off a toe?
---
Springwood is one of my personal fav maps. It's pretty fair for both killer AND survivor. Unlike other maps which can favor one or the other at times.

Mission failed we'll get them next time

Preschool is literally the most survivor sided map...
---
Now you're just saying shit to try to argue.  All I said was self care was massively nerfed.  It's my subjective opinion.  You came back with you're opinion, which is perfectly normal, but then you started adding a bunch of other things that aren't even relative to the original statement.  What the fuck does botany knowledge, med-kits, and me allegedly being a survivor main, have to do with self cares changes.  So yes, I suppose I am confused by your angle here.
---
Closes door. The straights are eating this guy up. 
---
&gt; I sadly started posting less here due to toxic people
---
What a bunch of shitheads.  Did you give them to THE ENTITY??
---
Oh god a Rick Grimes survivor would do things to a certain part of my body 
---
The game is broken, but hey, let’s just keep making content instead of fixing it!
---
I had someone genuinely compliment my Leatherface and say "first good Leatherface I've seen." Maybe for not camping or tunneling, who knows. But I was so thrown off by the compliment I had to ask them if they were serious.
---
I was once that dumb survivor. But luckily I did catch on after a bit and let the killer help me.
---
I really thought he was just messing with me but was touched when he just let me go. 
---
It made my night.
---
That’s not my point at all...  I’m not just protecting newbs... that was my counter to why I don’t like the double depip route... it has nothing to do with my actual post though...I don’t agree with you at all and I will never defend dcing... 
---
Even if you take away the punishment aspect of my post
---
What’s wrong with the other half?
---
Giving the killer the full points for a dc and survivor points for a dc as well.  
---
Also letting survivors keep their items and offering if the killer dcs...
---
I do see what you meant now though.  You want the rank to allow use of certain items and perks? So that having a high rank allows you to do more in matches? So having a depip for dcing would hinder gameplay... this isn’t a bad idea BUT, I still think killers should get the equivalent of a 3 hook kill and extra score based on the other categories they’d miss for a dc... and same with survivors 
---
How can I do a gen when he chased me down there I was looking for hatch and I heard it from the top only to find out he's behind and following alot faster. Then when I get there he pulls that off. I fail to see where my stupidity came into play?
---
What are you confused about?? I'll try to explain lol just let me know 
---
OP somehow ended up on the wrong side of the hatch, and the Killer standing on the hatch has essentially blocked off OP's escape from the narrow room in the basement. At least from the screenshot provided, he's completely trapped in that room 
---
Hmmmm.....Sounds something like a survivor would say, but yeah. Usually i already got the other three so I just wanna move on to next match,
---
Well, you would have plenty obviously, since you belong to one of those mental institutions. :)
---
Just slap a red hole wound texture over the clothes and send that shit to QA!
---
Hahaha I’m a killer I promise! I always feel like I control the pacing in the game, so if it’s a standoff it’s my fault. Idk what to say to get my killer cred :(
---
To play Devil's advocate, what if the Killer is trying to complete an achievement? Like say Blood on Your Face, where you have to Mori all 4 Survivors? It's already a bit of a pain to do with the current DC culture in the game.
---
The Survivor is no more entitled to escape than the Killer is to their 4k. Any statement you make regarding the Killer being selfish could literally be repeated verbatim with Killer being replaced by Survivor.
---
That's the question of the hour.
---
Who said I was serious? I responded to your bitch comment with equally cutting comment. The fact that you have to write long ass paragraph in response is amusing, 
---
The killer is exploiting because they're keeping the game hostage by standing in that exact spot where the survivor cannot jump into the hatch, or leave that corner.
---
I leave the gates at 99% if one of my teammates are about to get hooked Incase of Blood warden :) 
---
I'll take your word for it :)
---
What's an Apyr
---
Not toxic, but you're definitely throwing the pallets too early by camping them instead of "loop"ing them around the barriers a bit. In this bit, that didn't matter, but against higher level killers with Enduring and Spirit Fury (Stunned for less time and every so often a pallet breaks itself) you would have been caught much sooner and left your team without pallets.
---
What you're doing works, just keep in mind that you still have room for improvement.
---
Also, the reason a lot of newer Killers (Which this spirit obviously was) say that flashlights are toxic is because it goes from as dark as the game is to your screen being **bright-ass white** and then back to dark. Having that happen as often as you're doing it to the killer in this clip is very headache inducing.
---
Mind, that's why one of the first things you should learn as a Killer is how to avoid flashlights. So your eyes don't get dunked on.
---
Not trying to excuse the behavior, just explain it.
---
##Wat
---
first of all, dead hard and balanced landing have completely different purposes; dead hard will save you if you screw up a loop or if you're about to step in a trap, while balanced landing allows you to gain distance, unlock several loops and to turn every hill into a safe spot.
---
running both wouldn't even be such a bad idea.
---
then you're really underestimating how game changing it is when you're on the right map, especially both versions of crotus, which is where it really shines and even when the map is not the most optimal it's still gonna put some work.
---
then we have 28 possible maps. balanced landing is useless in 4 of those, 2 in macmillan and 2 in autohaven so i'm not really sure how you came up with those numbers. there is a reason why it's
---
It’s an anti tunnel perk now 
---
DS got nerfed like almost two weeks ago. 
---
Agreed. 
---
Lol I like you 
---
If you're super coordinated you are sweaty and tryharding.
---
Yeah, that happen to me the other day. I had to DC because I couldn't do anything.
---
Mcotes face should be replaced with a DC symbol
---
..... That doesn't even make sense.
---
I think it's time to take your medication. Didn't I tell you you go crazy without it!? 
---
Don't forget your straight jacket. It'll keep you warm! 
---
I think they should let us see after the match who was in a swf
---
I still like it when a survivor plays the one that forces the killer to be pig, nightmare, etc. Ive seen it 3 times in all my games, one time the killer immediately disconnected.
---
10/10, would buy
---
If you never used either one then you won't be affected by the nerf at all and be able to move on from it 🤔
---
Pseudo-infinites do still exist (ie loops that you should NEVER take as killer). Many MacMillan maps have them, Gas Haven, Torment Creek etc. 
---
It is massive. But it is also still predicated on the assumption that the killer would have gotten those 3 hooks to begin with. Which it is goofy to automatically assume (s)he would have and not assume all 3 of the remaining survivors somehow simultaneously unhooked that DCer at the same time and got 2 full unhooks themselves, which is of course, impossible. Which makes it an unearned reward for everyone if someone DCs, thus giving people reason to farm teammates even more than they do and encourage more DCing. It gives survivors who should be working together more reason to bm each other until there's only 1 or 2 left, really. Even if its just BP
---
Scroll through the selectable perks. Look for the Ash specific ones. They'll have his name displayed on them like usual. Sorry if I wasn't specific enough.
---
This has to be one of the shittiest posts I've ever seen here. What does this even mean?
---
Why yes actually
---
Aaaaahhhhh I’m so jealous! If you have any pics of the cosplay before things fell off I’d love to see it 😵 that’s awesome
---
Honestly though, why does the first picture look like Mathieu Côte? 😂😂
---
Definitely not toxic you weren't flashlight clicking bm at them or anything but it's clearly annoying for killer.  Also as others said I was a little triggered watching you camp pallets.  Incredibly wasteful, you need to conserve them by looping them first.  You did this well at the killer shack just apply the same thing to regular pallet loops.  
---
Nice.
---
Plague is one of my favorite killers. Nothing like Vile Purge to punish tbaggers at pallets.
---
I always feel bad for the killer in these clips. The lf is probably miserable and now there's an entire forum posts worth of comments bullying him.
---
I got to Legion to level 40.
---
Haven’t touch him since.
---
TAKIN IT LIKE A **C H A M P**
---
They have him in tekken 7 he’s bad ass af. 
---
If you have any more trouble, I can just DM you the descriptions. 
---
&gt;"Both exit gates are open and I'm fully capable of leaving and ending the game, but I won't because reasons."
---
Yeah, no. Survivors who do that ARE holding the game hostage.
---
The best part about NOED is that all you need to do is make sure one totem is left and it's an easy cleanup. Go ahead and facecamp someone to death while the rest genrush. You can literally punish someone for punishing you!
---
I’m sorry but I disagree completely
---
Even if you’re being face camped then... if you want to dc, just quickly die on the hook?
---
Or better yet, wait it out as long as possible to be a good teammate and let the killer lose while the others do gens... you shouldn’t dc... I’ll never condone dcing...
---
Every single game of killer I have played in the past month had at least 1 survivor dcing... sometimes at the start, sometimes in the middle, hell even sometimes at the end if I got them before they could leave the gate or get to a hatch...  that’s silly, and letting the killer have the bp for a kill would hurt nobody...
---
And after thinking about the punishments, fine, I could do without them... but like I said before, if you have shitty internet you should fix it first anyway... how can you have fun with terrible ping and dcing every other game? But sure, take away the punishments, it still wouldn’t hurt anyone to give bp bonus to the killer or other survivors when someone dcs... even if the killer camps, i shouldn’t dc... help the team.  
---
I used to have a ton of these but lost them because of prestiges.
---
You’re going to have to pay for it.
---
Only reason Bill was free was because Valve has an advantage since they own L4D. Ash is basically going to be Leatherface’s counterpart.
---
The ritual has commenced. It’s too late to turn back.
---
Now that's the kind of thing that turns tighty whities into frowny brownies.
---
Well you still get unhook points for farming a teammate. If they don't DC you got some extra points and they depip. If they do DC, everyone gets some extra points and they don't depip. Simple choice, really, on either side of it. Farmer, farmed, or even killer. Now the killer has a reason to be a shitlord and tunnel as much as possible. Arguably, they have a reason to to begin with, right? To get kills, to get points. Getting one gone quick is "massive." Now give them extra points for getting that person to leave before the killer ever has to earn a 3rd hook...You seeing the problem yet?
---
And frankly, there is justification for it, yes. Like I said, for people to protect their rank and their own gaming experience. Simple as that. Sorry, but it's not just a quick fix and you getting your BP you feel you're entitled to cuz someone else quit just adds fuel to the fire.
---
To be fair, they should have made them common again for halloween...
---
That escalated quickly lol 
---
It is definitely bigger, but the stun is pretty much nonexistent if the killer has Enduring. Yesterday, I used DS right next to a pallet, and the Billy could down me before I had time to run the 5 meters to the pallet. It's insane
---
Look up  "Salt Mine lobby." You have a hidden dc stat. If it gets to point X. Then you can only play with dcers in the salt mines. Enjoy playing with other dipshits for a few weeks. I agree with killers getting  3 hook points. Maybe gens can be done 10% faster? All I know is their are way to many dog shit people out there. Lets face it. 
---
I knew we were going to have to pay, I was just informing others who didn’t know yet 
---
It’s all good mate. Just confirming the facts.
---
Claud I'm fuckin crippled and if you ain't gonna stop looking for those damn ladybugs I'll turn into the fucking killer and it isn't gonna be a Freddy or Legion.
---
Groovy.
---
You know all those perks can be replaced by merely looking at a wall or faking a pickup?
---
You understand how hard it is nowadays to pull off a flashlight save? I’ll admit as a survivor a bring one often to try and save my friends that often end up tunnelled and camped.
---
But as a killer main, since the pickup speed increase and exhaustion change flashlight have retell ever been a problem, being blinded on pallets merely buys me time to catch up anyway. 
---
Is that a thing or just a random suggestion?
---
Are you a female?
---
If they're as bad as you say they are, you shouldn't have a problem with going after the unhooker rather than the unhooked a good percentage of the time. 4 man 5 gens is easy even without tunneling if the survivors suck.
---
Maybe I'm biased because Spirit's easy to snowball with. I don't know what killers you play consistently. If you're playing Freddy/Trapper or something, I can see where you're coming from. If you're playing a high mobility killer, there's really no excuse.
---
That’s giving rank 20s a lot of credit
---
Imagine, you have We’ll Make It,
---
IT TELLS THEM YOU HAVE IT,
---
And they still fucking run away.
---
Yeah haha, thats interesting 
---
And I agree with you, I just feel we can do many things, ANYTHING... to negate dcing, but they don’t seem to do it
---
I like the idea of this salt mine with the idea also of giving killer hook points and survivors something 
---
you did a pretty good job
---
...i did have we’ll make it. &amp; true story. 
---
I wish I could mock and ridicule every survivors that dc. What happened to your balls?
---
I see nothing wrong except you could have looped more before dropping pallets.
---
No? It's not a stalemate.
---
The survivor can't do anything in this situation except quit the game.
---
The killer has the option of hitting the survivor or moving out the way.
---
No they are not.  Holding the game hostage means it physically can't end due to the actions of one party preventing the other from ending the game, such as a killer body blocking a survivor at the steps of the basement and refusing to move until they DC.  The killer could at any point simply walk over there and chase them out which ends the game.  If a survivor hangs out at the exit gate and the killer refuses to go over there to chase them out then they are contributing to that situation and choosing to allow the game to continue.  It is rude for the survivor to do but it is not holding a game hostage and it sure as shit isn't reportable.  Simply walk over there and chase them out.  You get bonus points just for looking at them and initiating a new "chase" anyways.
---
I think it's referring to her arms? Normally both her hands would be down with an item but she's half doing her regular pose with her hands crossed. 
---
This is badass I love it!! 
---
git broken, scrub!
---
Survivor has the option of getting passed the killer?
---
Lol I have countless videos of killers ragequitting but sure, ok.
---
Even with Sloppy Butcher’s 25% loss it still is effective. Like, the fuck y’all doing? This is purple ranks too. Only time it makes sense to run is if killer is near or coming back.
---
excuse you
---
honestly 👏🏼👏🏼
---
Have you read any of the other comments?
---
The killer is blocking the only way out. The survivor can't leave the area, nor jump in the hatch. Both options are physically blocked off.
---
Who? 
---
If you're one of the last survivors though that means there are potentially 1-3 less hooks on the map since the others could have been broken by survivor deaths. Also if run with Breakdown or Boil Over it could potentially be really good.
---
Haven’t paid attention to the rank numbers but I still get red badge survivors
---
Lol, I can imagine all 4 survivors running around king fu kicking the killer right before they escape the exit...
---
can someone explain to me the appeal of someone that looks like she’s spent at least 1 million dollars on plastic surgery
---
can someone explain how to use the insta-heal? is it the same as the anti-hemorrhagic syringe?
---
Killer can force survivor out or down/hook them.
---
A Survivor standing by exit isn't holding a game hostage.
---
Hostage means the other party CAN'T end the game due to the actions of the other. Aka killer blocking basement stairs so survivor literaly cannot work on gens, leave or even be hooked and die.
---
A killer CAN end the game simply by smscking the Survivor at the gate which either hurls him through the gate or downs him for pickup/sacrifice.
---
By NOT going to the gate SOLELY because you dont want to let them tbag you, you're CHOOSING to waste your time and let the match drag on.
---
Basically, Survivor refuses to leave til he gets to tbag you, you refuse to go to gate to avoid tbags.
---
Aka you're BOTH holding the game hostage by being STUBBORN.
---
meg? have you seen how ugly meg is? 
---
Hide &amp; not get killed. ;D
---
Hatch standoff with the killer instead of doing gens/baiting the killer away. Big brain play right here bois 
---
Okay, so then if you get 3 free hooks what's to stop you from downing me and face camping me out of the game early with an Insidious Bubba? If I hang on, you get very little BP, sure. But then I have to sit there and slowly die on the hook which is not fun, at all, and get punished with a depip because you wan't to be a douche, right? On top of that, it puts other players on my team at risk for the same level of douchery if I hang on long enough so they can get gens done and one peels off to see if they can get a save. Or, I can DC, and not have a lame time, and not depip, and...you get rewarded for a full 3 hook plus chase points for that? And that now being a "massive" shift in the game the survivors get absolutely nothing for it?
---
Basically, I get depipped and face camped, the only way to make it less rewarding for you (points wise, cuz lets face it, face camping isn't done for points) is to hang on so you get less points for the camp plus occupy your time so you can't go get more, and they lose a teammate either way, but they get the joy of...working on gens? Or I DC and you get 3 hooks WITHOUT the camper penalty, and they still get nothing?
---
And you're not seeing how this might be a little...shitlordish?
---
What are you offering me advice for?
---
I stated self care was massively nerfed(my opinion).  How did you come to determine I needed advice from that?
---
When people's standards are low, don't complain about it.  Just sell them real cheap shit.  It's a capitalist's dream!
---
I see a lot of people complaining about hitboxes and it always confuses me. Isn’t the problem the connection which causes bad hitboxes and not the hitboxes being bad?
---
Yeah he already got 3
---
He gotta be seeing **stuff** and **thangs.**
---
That’s a good Nea build so far. Good stuff!
---
I agree, I think some people do it to spite the other side,  rewarding the other side, may deter this mindset.  Wouldn't deter all reasons for DCing though.
---
I know that pain.  Unfortunately for them, I have several collections of Horror films that I'm always willing to rewatch.  If they want to break their ctrl key waiting for me while I laugh along with Freddy, that's their problem.
---
I have been gone for 9 months and after playing for a few weeks I see about 50% of my games have a dc. I see it like this. I do not like this killer..DC. I was first downed DC. I do not like this map DC. They broke my ruin. DC. They did 3 gens DC. I slightly think its a swf DC. Killer burned a bps and I did not score many points yet DC.Taking to long to unhook me DC. This killer is 40 meters away after hook he is a camper DC.  if they feel ANY frustration bet your ass its going to be a DC. My personal fav. IM going to DC so my buddy can get hatch. Wow....
---
Same thing happened to one of my friends last week.
---
The only killer bug I saw was the Spirit one, she has a noise when shes phasing
---
Where you tbagging the killer at the hatch waiting for them to get there? How’d you even get in that situation lol. If the killer was there before you I can’t see how you’d get past them to where you are now 
---
Why does it matter what he plays anyway? His statement is his regardless. Some of you guys on this sub...
---
Lmfao reverse bamboozle 
---
The only thing I see bad personally is the pallet camping.. your suppose to make each one last as long as possible but I don’t see why killers would be mad at that lmao they WANT you to waste pallets. It’s pretty obvious to me that they are just being salty little bitches about the flash lighting 🙄
---
He was behind me during and I didnt know if when he's in frenzy if he could still pull me off soni didnt want to risk it. 
---
U know what, good for you. i retract my previous statement 
---
Honestly, I'm as happy as a clam right now.  I have not gone past 7-6 this season and it feels so good right now.
---
Tbh I hate streamers sometimes but I feel like they’re kind of a better introduction to this game than actually just starting the game cold turkey... shows you there’s for sure another side to the game beyond getting facecamped or bullied by deranked SWF
---
But it IS a free escape. I play survivor alot and even if there is only one gen left to power the exit gates I think, "What's the point? If I find hatch I win." There is no risk for b- lining for hatch as survivor Then the game just comes down to a boring staring contest of who can waste away their life the longest first. I just want the hatch to have more a dynamic to it rather then it be a cop out for not completing the generators.
---
Works the other way around too. I’m a killer main but once in a blue moon when I play with my friends I’m basically untouchable as survivor
---
Honestly not sure why people edit perks and icons, i dont think the reward is all that fantastic for the chance of ur account getting lost forever. 
---
Even got a gg? Godly sir
---
Can't say for sure but I don't think it was the dying that got to him, he's alright with learning curves and doesn't mind losing to begin with. But to sit and wait for me to finish a full game multiple times just made him quit, hopefully he doesn't uninstall/try to refund but when he left for bed it sounded that way.
---
I'm totally okay with a debate,  but ours are a lot different. I understand some circumstance of disconnecting,  as you do not. Lol. Which is okay,  I know personally as killer it sucks and as survivor it sucks. But if someone has a good reason I don't mind. If I'm playing killer and camping,  I know their is a 50/50 chance that the person is going to DC. And,  if the killer is deliberately screwing them out of their bloodpoints,  no I do not at all agree they should still get the sacrifice and points. That's just me tho.
---
But, I wouldn't care if the killer got the kill and points for someone who disconnects JUST over being downed. I just feel there would be no way to figure out which is which,  a DC is a deliberate fuck you to the killer/survivor that sometimes they may deserve. I dc'd as killer one day because the survivors would NOT leave the game. They just stood there t bagging,  I didn't even killer any of them on purpose just doing a daily. Then after 3 left,  1 stood at the hatch till I found him and just non stop t bagged,  wouldn't leave even after I hit him. So I just left,  and got such beautiful hate mail. Sometimes the DC is a fun thing. Lol. I ruined that guys day,  and got my daily done. He lost what 5k because he refused to leave. 
---
Killers can message Survivors on PS4 but Survivors have no way to message killer so in your example the killer could just message the survivor and ask can I mori you if I let you run around and get a bunch of blood points first?  Every killer that’s messaged me asking for help to do a daily/trophy I’ve helped unless they’ve asked me to turn traitor to the other survivors and then I tell him to do something physically impossible.
---
I’ve always thought that it strange that the killer can see the player ID names of all the survivors, but not vice versa
---
Nea would look better in it
---
WAIT! How did you know I want fake internet points? Oh crap, I just got _Exposed Status Effect_.
---
Can you imagine the fan art involving Amanda though?
---
Don't make me laugh when I'm trying to be serious, /u/Johnny_Zer0 
---
billy kk. thank you for showing
---
I like to just go to the other side of the map and wait. Sometimes if they're really stupid they'll come looking for you and you can get a kill out of it.
---
This also happens with Spirit. Is big spook.
---
Usually it’s the survivor you previously saved from the hook more than once and even took a hit for them to help them escape. 
---
Wow, they both did a pretty good job!
---
Survivors can message Killers...
---
Just hold the PS button, click on Dead By Daylight, and choose Currently Playing With. Assuming their profile isn't set to anonymous, you can grab their ID and message them from there.

I miss the days when PC games only really had community driven servers, with regulars and an actual community. This whole random queue, team competitive, or ranked queues are just lead to the most cancerous shit ever.
---
Were these matches mid game??
---
Oh ok😅
---
Says you. I'm not. I think of everything logically from both points of view and go with what I can back with fact and logic. 
---
I tried the new DS and had this is not happening, I still missed it 2 times... then nstoped using it, but I can hit hex ruin ez pz... I have no idea why I find a bigger skillcheck harder to hit
---
imagine thinking rank 1 players are good in 2019
---
Ok. I didn't think to look on the DBD wiki.
---
Run in a straight line baby dweet!
---
and who said otherwise? majority of survivors will happily die on hook if they had fun during the game. that's the problem, games aren't fun anymore
---
Shoulda just went with it, that was really flattering  of her,  being mired by mumma is a treasure.
---
🤣
---
I just cannot fathom how at rank 11 I can sacrifice 3 people, let last get hatch, and only safety pip.
---
[removed]
---
Yikes don’t cut yourself on all that edge 
---
the matchmaking system has always put you against other players from your region server, so of course they'll likely be from the same country. they're probably swf if they AREN'T from the same country because europeans play with americans. 
---
A little makeup and proper hair cosmetic can cover up that neanderthal face
---
dunno what survivors you've been talking to, we don't claim them
---
But... I do? And I barely play survivor so I barely get to go that. Who are you to say that first of all, I don't, and second of all judge that I'm an entitled prick. And I do try to win, and I don't care when others tryhard, but if I see someone just trying to have a nice game of huntress or Freddy without tunneling or camping which ruins my fun, I'm going to try and let them have their fun. It's also part of the reason I never take ruin, sprint burst, decisive, flashlights, noed, or any other thing that is considered toxic and unfun, if I find it necessary to take them, sure why not, I will take them, but if I could do without them I'd rather that as to not take from someone else's fun to have my own. 
---
no. only difference is you don't need to run bond and etc so you get to choose really custom and carefree perk builds
---
Well the fact that you use deerstalker means you plan to slug survivors often which really isn’t ideal. It’s a good way to always get 4k’s I guess but not to actually maximize you’re performance in games. You should use perks that help you get survivors on hooks often
---
&gt; Why is this not higher?
---
because it doesnt matter? if OP sat around hatch and then got blocked out of escaping, fine, he deserves it - but in the context of this image, he cant go out of the hatch nor can he leave to do the last generator. thats holding the game hostage, and a bannable offense.
---
also, you make the assumption the meg sat at hatch to begin with - it is possible the killer could've been right behind them as they arrived at the hatch.
---
I hope evil ash is a killer!
---
Everybody wanna be a plague infected Babylonian High Priestess, until its time to cut off a toe.
---
Absolutely horsehit bad killer if you play with any integrity.
---
However, if you use the right add-ons like frank's mixtape and a cancerous playstyle, (s)he becomes the most asinine killer in the game with no counterplay.
---
Very true, I don’t think anything is a be all end all fix, but it’d be nice for those who don’t dc 
---
Lol yeah mate... it’s ridiculous and the reason I will never condone dcing... such a cheese move 
---
... is anyone gonna tell this guy
---
Yeah I completely agree with you. 
---
I think the highest survivor rank I’ve seen is rank 4 but I’ve seen multiple red ranks for killers. It’s tremendously easier to pip as killers than survivor. 
---
This means there aren’t any red rank survivors to play against so really high killers are forced to play against average players around 12-10. 8-6 if you’re lucky. There are tons and tons of videos out there showing this bullshit. 
---
I’m teetering on the edge of 6-5 and that’s only sustainable if I play super sweaty. 
---
Fun fact, that’s not fun. 
---
I was usually red ranks but now even black pipping is a struggle. If you don’t play perfectly then you’re boned. 
---
So I’m not saying make it a hand holding experience, but at least make it to where the survivors don’t have to do everything to just barely pip. It’s frustrating. 
---
And also you should automatically black pip if the killer/survivors DC. It’s pathetic to pay consequences for another persons pettiness/shitty internet. 
---
This game is one step forwards and two steps back :/
---
TL;DR Killers pip way too easy forcing low level survivors to play against high ranks because red ranks are almost nonexistent for survivors anymore. 
---
I got that one the other day! 
---
Must be nice to have decent internet and the option to pick matches, all our lobbies are 600ish. If we didn't settle there'd never be a game. 
---
isn't it concerning that a we're taking advice (thats actually good advice) from a fortnite streamer, just think of it. DBD is legit dying if we're taking advice from a fortnite streamer.
---
honestly it sounds like a hassle and drag to play with someone like that
---
I mean, once a 6'8 WNBA starting center pukes on you, can you really say you're the one doing the humiliating?  At that point, you either learn to never teabag her again or become known as the sick kid who always trying to touch people.
---
Dude I've been coming back to this photo just to see that smug ass cool face.
---
All the more reason to transfer the BP and pip from campers to the camped person and have it shown on screen for everyone to see. The BP and pip siphoning need to be incremental too so the longer a killer camp, the longer they'll feel the punishment. 
---
This! I only do it to killers who I think deserve it in some way...whether they nodded while I was down, or tunneled/camped myself or another player. If I escape you’d better believe I’ll be giving it back. With a good killer I may stick around for a minute but with my back turned giving them a free hit or two.  
---
Lol you look like the plague.
---
I always feel bad when I kill people using the syringe. That's a hard add on to find and they died anyway
---
I agree mate, 100%
---
Emergencies are emergencies, but they wouldn’t really hurt you if punishable because they aren’t a constant threat for you to dc.  
---
Hell, true story, my neighbors house caught on fire a month ago while I just loaded into a game as killer. I didn’t even have time to close the game... I just s left my shit running and went to help my neighbors (they are really old, in their 80s...) all the fire trucks and everything were blaring.  I come back about 5-10 minutes later just to close everything down and funny enough, the survivors still had 1 gen to do (no fuckin idea why they were so slow lol) and I ended up getting a 3k out of it somehow 
---
We all got tons of points, and I had a real life emergency (my room smelt like smoke for a while after this because their house is directly behind my room) to attend to...
---
But... “he is using legion so I can dc” or, “he knocked me first”, is fucking stupid lol
---
My favorite of all time dcs was from an swf, they all 4 dced because I used franklins demise ... and it was back when flashlights were crazy op lol 
---
BURAGHYAAYAA  
---
Also, I appreciate that your censer looks like a right-proper blunt instrument.
---
Ok
---
If I recall, Bethesdas proof that the code was copy pasted was that WestWorld had the same bugs in it lmfao. If that doesn't say everything it needs to idk what else does. It was such a shit show lol
---
I'd guess it has to do with the environment, how the game draws the dream world, but I ain't no dev so idk 
---
Unless you're directly interfering with game files you won't be flagged by EAC.
---
Had the exact same spawn! Made a post about it too. :(
---
Low-key, fuck their current merch store. I bought some stuff back in October, and I just now got it! It took almost a year! There's so much stuff I'd like to buy, but I will never *ever* order from them again. 
---
About the doing it on purpose thing? I was joking lmao. 
---
I haven’t came across that one YET. Can’t be as annoying as the many survivor bugs tho. I just wish they would fix things already! 
---
Not at all. But salty, incompetent killers will camp and tunnel your ass they ever catch you. Just be careful. I'd personally try to get away / unseen after a couple of loops. 
---
Who is Sebastian?
---
I have been around and the premise of the game is that the entity feeds off the hope of the survivors why would it take people without hope to start with. We actually don't have info on most of the survivors being taken just their back stories. BHVR started saying when they were taken starting with Kate. Most of them just disappeared quietly after wandering into the woods but then the devs started taking more liberties with how they could be grabbed, like Adam being taken in broad daylight with a lot of other people around, or Jane being taken from a car accident. There have been no examples of survivors being taken because of no hope.
---
And Spoony is definitely right, the lore doesn't mean much these days aside from how they want to fit a character in the world. It used to be that survivors lost hope over time and turned into the monsters but they did a hard retcon of that and the entity just discards things that are of no use anymore whether its a survivor with no hope, or a killer with no rage, and picks a killer it thinks is a good tool.
---
lmao is it really 🤣 thats so weird and ye lil bit lol
---
He’s annoying to play against if they’re even decent. They have almost no skill floor or ceiling and has no counterplay what-so-ever other than basic jukes. He also requires a person to constantly hold M1 more than  the norm. Playing as him isn’t exactly fun either (imo), as he doesn’t need planning or strategy, just stab stuff. 
---
Since the other movie survivors are not free, why are you so shocked about this one costing money aswell?
---
dang, lucky you! I wish mine would get fixed. Not being able to play is killin me. Thanks for the info though. Hit me up if she ever finds a fix without a patch. Doubtful, but im open to anything lol
---
heheheheh
---
Yeah, Deerstalker isn't the best choice. What about Nurses Calling?
---
Excuse me? Anymore? ... O.K.
---
You're welcome
---
The ranking system is in a desperate need of fixing. Both sides are struggling we (as usual) just need to be patient and wait for the devs to hopefully fix this when the Ash update comes out.
---
Wait how did you get back up so quick right after she downed you?
---
I see your a fan of my screenshot. Lol. Now I will probably forever call him Braces.
---
We know what MCote thinks of legion now ;D
---
You still died just cause you wanted to be a troll
---
DS was overpowered, and now it is an anti-tunneling perk instead of a free getaway.
---
Nah they need to be bundled together to do anything against the killer. These bad bois will just surprise them if anything.
---
K
---
A LF did something similar to this to me not too long ago. Difference being he mind gamed himself and lost a chase. He then quits. Guy in the game asks why he left and he said "I'm not playing against mics". Fair enough but no one was SWF (all randoms) lol. Besides that, you lost a fucking chase, how the hell can you blame that on SWF even IF it was a SWF lobby which this wasn't? 
---
&gt; pallet stuns are rare against good killers
---
If they are respecting pallets they are awful killers, lmao.
---
Honestly freaking awesome 
---
It’s a stand-alone...
---
We already have that with thrill
---
The Evil Within main protag
---
What?
---
Nah, just about only survivors getting glitched.
---
Yeah, you and me both, man.
---
I read that as serial killer family and was about to sic FBI at you and your family's ass. 
---
Not protecting it, blocking it.
---
If they were just standing in the way then they'd be protecting it, they are standing in a spot that blocks the prompt.
---
Looping/Tea bagging etc.
---
THE PLAAAAAAAG DUDE 
---
Looping isn’t trolling mate
---
It’s just as annoying
---
Doesn’t that mess with the lore of no one talking 
---
I know but even with that it still gets destroyed so quickly, survivors have perks that basically negate the Thrill of the Hunt perk.
---
These comments are so aggressive lol; Nice cosplay and 'grats on meeting McCote :)
---
It's crazy man. The DC problem is an epidemic. It's wrecking games for the other people, and it's destroying the chance at ranking of for people who care about their ranks. Some people are experiencing obscene wait times just to load into a game only to have it ruined by a DC'er. It's ridiculous. 
---
And then you get all these excuses about why nothing should be done about it with some people acting like they live these complicated lives where emergencies keep coming up and they must DC all the time. Unless the game has players whom are real life Spies for secret agencies, are part of a royal family, live in the desert/wilderness/Detroit, an amazing scientist working on a top-secret invention, or a real life Hitman/Hitwoman ...your life isn't some real-life Mission Impossible movie. Emergencies will rarely happen to you. Having to DC once every week is ridiculous. Having to DC every day is beyond ridiculous.
---
The blunt honest truth of the matter is that people DC 99% of the time because they were outplayed, because they don't like the killer, because they don't like the map, because they want to troll, because of spite, because they are selfish. They don't care about anyone but themselves, so others shouldn't care if they get banned. They did it to themselves and the game would be better off without them.
---
This is more accurate than you think. Rin offered her services willingly to the Entity, so he wants her Killer Instinct super sharp.
---
Well I feel like that would make for an extra punishment for getting late game trapped. Really the only reason I'm into this is because there's already a chance you'll 1 box the rtb off your head anyway. Idunno
---
I think the idea Bricky had a LONG ass time ago still can work. Killers start off with “flames” for the hexes that are essentially inactive perks. Killers can imbue a dull totem with the flame of a perk you selected which activates the totem. This’ll prevent dumb totem spots and you can chose when to start using your ruin, devour, etc.
---
My bad \_sad smol billy\_
---
(I swear I did not take internet points from you)
---
The guy is literally being held hostage with no way out.
---
I think you just empathize more with survivor gameplay. That's fine, I'd just try being a little more self-aware and maybe consider that it takes two to tango. 
---
Imagine that with boil over
---
Also a chance you’ll 4/5 box. 
---
Box placement is the problem here. 
---
You're delusional. Go buy yourself a ps4 and get yourself a 4 man team in purple ranks and then come try telling me that the queues aren't 3 hours long. I'll wait. Until then, go fuck yourself.
---
I actually really like the insidious idea, I think some of the best moments of the game come from being surprised. The changes to monstrous shrine are cool too although I think it would be better as just a regular perk instead of a hex. 
---
That's a very interesting idea as well both ideas would help the game and save the devs stress.
---
it requires alot of skill and it has alot of mistakes so survivors can't exactly be mad if i win
---
Very cool! 🤮🥴😀

Aaaaand is this post again.
---
FeelsBadMan
---
Pig, Wraith, Huntress, and LF.
---
Mostly because they tend to camp and tunnel. 
---
Because those came with a full chapter release.
---
I thought it would be something like Bill where you get it for free. 
---
Hehe Mcotes face 😆
---
First guy to get hooked killed himself. The second guy died pretty quickly after that. Overall it was a fast game so I figured I'd give the last guy the hatch, especially because he played well. After 2\~ minutes of waiting around the hatch, I thought maybe he was hiding around it thinking I'd do a hatch stand off, so I looked around the area a bit before deciding to take a look at all the other gens. I did that for a little bit.
---
Suddenly, a generator that was close to me, had been touched. So I searched all lockers and didn't find him. Around 1 minute after that, he went around touching gens all over the map.
---
Then, as I was patrolling the hatch area, opening lockers, checking the gens, the madman was doing a finishing a generator that was literally across the map. As time goes by, I finally see him and we run to the hatch. For around 30 secs it's a match stand off. He was being so much of a dick I just decided he didn't deserve the hatch.
---
After that he left at one point and I chased him around for a minute or so, until I finally hit him and let him get the hatch.
---
I'm not sure if intentionally not taking the hatch counts as taking the game hostage, but it sure as hell was frustrating and a complete waste of my time. I got NOTHING out of it. So this guy intentionally wasted at least 10 minutes of my time... **because I was playing Legion.**
---
All of this hate against Legion is getting bizarre and too much.
---
Classic condescending redditor reply #5, yawn.
---
Survivors are bad and dont destroy totems
---
Eh most of the time. Some times I just give up and okay it though because of the constant dodging and dcing 
---
PLAG*
---
Too real
---
I didn't see it, but I suppose it's possible they found it in a chest.
---
Underrated comment 
---
Yessssssss
---
Hm. Fair enough. I've played a fair akount, I'm surprised I've never seen thar before. Then again I imagine it's probably fairly rare.
---
I want you to imagine the worst two chess players in the world, sitting down and playing games against one another for hours everyday, more chess than anyone else in the world is playing, until finally the World Chess Federation declares them the #1 and #2 players in the world. They haven't gotten significantly better because they haven't really been challenging themselves. They haven't proven themself against any truly skilled opponents. They've just been playing shittily against their equally shitty friend - a lot. And every game has generated points out of thin air and given them to one or both of them until they were technically had the highest two point totals in the world.
---
*That is how DBD's emblem system works!* Pipping isn't zero-sum. My gain is not your loss. My loss is not your gain. Alice can play against Bob, Clark, Derek, and Erin, all of whom are at the exact rank, Alice can 4k them, and then all five of them can walk away with 1 pip. It's not even all that uncommon, long games frequently end that way because everyone has time to grind out their emblems just by playing. Just think about that for a moment. Think about what that actually means. Alice beat the survivors, but DBD's MMR system decided that means she and the survivors are the same skill level and kept their ranks/pips equal. And the survivors lost a game against a killer of their own rank, but DBD's MMR system decided that means they're too good for killers of that rank and needed ranked up.
---
Yeah, that's actually really, really stupid. Math nerds figured out how stupid that was more than fifty years ago. Here's your recommended reading if you feel like dorking out about this stuff: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system
---
Basically, MMR is a solved math problem and DBD isn't using the solution or any of its modern derivatives. We *know* how to measure the relative skill of players in a zero-sum game as they play games against one another. You have winners take points off losers. The more unexpected the result (low skill player beating a high skill player), the more points the winner takes off the loser. The more expected the result (high skill player beating a low skill player), the less points the winner takes off the loser. You can easily measure degree of victory in certain games (rounds in CS:GO, for example), so sometimes you do that too when deciding how many points the winner should take off the loser. And that's it. That's all you've got to do. Make it zero-sum and as players will sort themselves as they play the game. It's magic and DBD doesn't do anything remotely like it.
---
Its a crutch for bad players who get destroyed. 
---
It will probably become a thing yeah, makes more sense than the generator perk. 
---
I think even more survivors will start just ignoring ruin though
---
People who DC are frustrating, but people who hold games hostage are literal trash. 
---
If you’re willing to hold a match hostage because you’re salty you should not be playing multiplayer video games if you are that poor of a sportsman 
---
That’s my brief rant of the day 
---
Classic person whining for free stuff #5000, yawn.
---
Honestly if ur an swf you can start to work at saving against campers (get borrowed time). But still camping is extremly prevelant at all ranks its something you have to learn to accept is part of the game.
---
Learn how to make tricky saves or gen rush the full blown facecampers
---
I love it when killers try to moonwalk and double back when I can see them haha. I just wait for them to look at me and point at them 😂
---
S T R E G H T
---
What about the side boob?
---
I see it more as a backup plan in case things go south for the killer especially when dealing with swf 
---
Used to be. They removed a lot of the pallets around the preschool last year.  Before that it was automatic loss as killer.
---
Wait is that really mccote? I thought it was just a buddy of his cosplaying Really well
---
If he didn't want to take the hatch, just kill him. How did him not taking the hatch waste your time? 
---
jump out of the locker...
---
100%
---
Here’s a concept 
---
Bare with me 
---
The last survivor didn’t run to the hatch when it was offered. They stayed in the match. 
---
Ok....you didnt use it...
---
Wish I could give you an award

Cleanse totems... problem solved
---
Ffs, people act like they can’t do it
---
Sure it takes time away from gens, ffs, that’s the point!
---
Why do you think every killer runs ruin, they need to slow the game down...  otherwise gens get done so fast, especially with a team of swf... so cleanse the totems 
---
Chuckling?  
---
Doctor, Clown, and Freddy all have something to say to that
---
Nothing fuels the soul like spite.
---
NoED is not a gamble wtf 
---
Lmaooooo
---
Wow calling people mental. Bravo you've made yourself a wonderful individual! I assume you're around 10 or 9 years old and watch Ochido.
---
Adrenaline would like to have a conversation with you. 
---
I bought Legion just to spite my friend. 
---
OP no one cares that you dont like NOED. We see these posts everyday. Just cleanse totems and shut up.
---
Cutie 
---
Is that Wendy from... Wendy's?
---
Missing a few metastasis bur your cancer cosplay is on point. 
---
I'm sure you've had your games where you run the killer for several minutes, you don't go down once all game, then bam NOED down.  That's why it exists.  Weak players need the safety net to help them crutch their kills.  It's awesome for them because it prevents them from having to go through the trouble of learning how to chase efficiently, pressure gens, and make intelligent decisions midgame.
---
Whatever you say pal. Just try not dying and comimg here to complain.
---
That is hilarious!
---
I hope so
---
*so far*
---
Well that’s one way to put it 
---
Yeah maybe but it’s annoying when I’m a rank 15 going up against an obviously skilled Myers who has NOED who probably deranked to face noobs such as myself (DEFINITELY not saying this cuz it happened)
---
Prove your fact then. Go on, do it.
---
Because aside from a very well timed pallet stun, there is zero counterplay. Zero reads. Zero mind games. Nothing. He sees you and enters frenzy, hits you twice, follows you but not close enough to register chase. Waits until your bar is at 1/3 then enters frenzy and downs you.
---
It's like nurse except nurse requires extreme amounts of focus and skill to use which is worthy of respect. On top of that you can use pallets to block her teleport (sometimes) and you can break line of sight to force her to randomly blink or slowly move around the wall. You can abuse her fatigue and completely lose her.
---
Legion? If he decides he wants you then there's nothing you can do. It's even worse if they moonwalk to use Frank's Mixtape. There's absolutely zero counterplay to either of those. I'm sure you can find videos demonstrating just how bullshit legion is. He doesn't down people fast enough to be anything besides a low tier trash killer, but because of the lack of any counterplay he is still frustrating to play against because there's nothing you can even do besides hope your team does gens fast enough to get out.
---
If you know that the killer is gonna respect the pallet then you can just pretend that you're going to drop the pallet and continue looping it, effectively keeping the pallet alive for longer than it should.
---
&gt;if you know that they can hit you before the swing animation even starts
---
Are you talking about good killers or just lag? Lag doesn't have anything to do with skill.
---
Is it a bug that you lose a pip as the survivor when the Killer DCs and you didn’t reach the safety pip? (We didn’t lose our items though). Please fix it :( not my fault if the killer DCs. 
---
Oh such original insult! How am I to sleep after such scathing comment? ;_;
---
BTW, is this your second or third account? 
---
Its just that you notice when it happens, its like people saying that they always get a 3 man game. They dont, they just notice it more when it happens
---
The good news is if you make it to rank 1 ever you'll still be able to face it routinely lol.  It's brought as a safety net across the ranks.  It's quite sad but true.  Shame too, the game has gotten so easy for us killers at this point but my micropenis brethren still consider it a staple on their loadouts.
---
Low ranks were always cancer but if you played well youd pip, for me the real problem right now rank wise is survivors have zero control over themselves pipping once they hit purple ranks. 
---
I still think John Kramer should be a survivor, even though I love Tapp. The guy spends 95% of the first movie blending in as a victim anyway, and Amanda's his antagonist in the third movie. Think of the perks. 
---
Rules: The game has rules. For every Survivor currently hooked, gain vision of the killer within 7/14/21 meters. 
---
Appreciate Life: You pry off of those complacent. Everytime a survivor is downed before you, gain one token. At three tokens, you may automatically heal them from the dying state once their wiggle bar reaches 20%. 
---
Relaxing Toxin: You become attuned the longer you're in a match. Once the generators are complete, for every dull totem remaining on the map, gain 2/4/6/8/10% move speed. 
---
Them damn str8ts always messing with us 
---
Normally yes, but ion this case, the killer is blocking the hitbox for the hatch itself and also any way out of the corner that the surv is in. So he's holding the game hostage, which is griefing and therefore poor sportsmanship and against the ToS.
---
Paging u/ZombieHuggerr ?
---
I love messages like this lol xD
---
I did this format once, but I didn't quite use it's proper potential. Maybe I'll re-do it and a few others in the future.
---
I googled DetectiveCookieh and can't find your IG 🤔
---
I go by the name of Cookiehchar there 😊
---
Haha what the hell?
---
I recently allowed a downed survivor to escape from the killer when the killer was right next to both of us.
---
I love the ''cleanse totems" counterplay point, because it is quite possibly the dumbest counterplay in this game.
---
Yes. Take time out of pushing your ONE objective, saving your friends, etc.  in the event that this killer is gonna have NOED. 
---
A competent counterplay for the power of NOED it is not. 
---
And it's virtually impossibly to guarantee all totems cleansed unless you yourself do it or you are in a squad with the other survivors because you're not a mind reader or able to know if they are also doing their part in cleansing said totems. 
---
You basically risk wasting time for survivors to control the match and save their friends for the event that the killer does not even have NOED and that's probably why so many killers try to use this as a counterpoint. 
---
''Waste your time it makes my job easier." 
---
I mean... are you saying noed takes skill to use? Lol also no counter for DS? I wonder what all that dribbling was about then.....
---
Oh for sure! I mainly think console because I'm a console loser. lol
---
Me trying to find a comfortable position in bed
---
At least have the Plague's mori melt their face or give nasty ass boils or something. I do love how she ends it with a censer burner bitch slap.
---
*wheeze* Haha its funny cuz nea is killur haha

On console as soon as you join a game, before even loading in completely, the killers already DC’d lmao. Its almost impossible to get servers that aren’t red pinged. When I do, I go against a face camping killer or useless potato randoms :) (Not saying I’m good cause I barley am but... if you can’t work through ruin and can’t find the actual ruin you’re literally useless lmao).
---
Adrenaline legitimately is only problematic in a chase with an injured survivor/survivor at the end game.  
---
Otherwise it's virtually a non issue endgame and it exhausts survivors who use it so if they used it to rush to an exit gate and you've gotten to it. Well they're not gonna be much use in a chase anyways.
---
Really? At least with Legion, you stand a chance, bubba is insta death.
---
 Herpes
---
There’s a pause button in the bottom left. Feels stolen from a clip.
---
When you go to kill people but they laugh at you
---
I'm just annoyed if you come against a shit killer you all de pip.
---
I main Legion and Freddy, so I can say that this one hits home.  
---
If you DC on seeing me, you are a problem.   
---
95% of the time I end up letting the three man team farm and get as much as they can. There's no reason to let them suffer because one prick said "not having fun, screw you"
---
those pins are amazing 😍
---
NOED legetimately is only problematic in a chase once the generators are powered and the totem is still up. 
---
Otherwise it's virtually a non issue endgame and it often wastes the perk slot of who uses it so if you're going up against a decent survivor who knows how to loop. Well you're not gonna be much use in a chase anyways. 
---
Look, NOED gives you one free down a game through a perk. *If that,* it's not uncommon for it to be disabled before it can be used. I can't turn off Adrenalin, and it gives you one free health state through a perk, even when you're down. I'm not even saying NOED isn't effective, because I use it a fair bit- nor do I hate adrenaline. *Just do every totem you come across.* God, for a perk that everyone knows the counter to, it sure does draw a lot of whining. 
---
I got an idea. How about we just remove every perk from the game except Spies From the Shadows and No Mither? Now no one is complaining.
---
Unbreakable. You slug 3 people and snag the 4th think you got a 4k. One pops up and then you got 3 people running aroind again.
---
You moonwalked him, right?
---
Bbq and chili its annoying as a survivor 
---
It’s like giving pieces of a kill to a hunting dog. You lose on those pieces, but it motivates the dog to hunt more efficiently and more often, netting you more in the end.
---
I mean...   
---
Am I the only one who thinks it's cute that Frank was raising his knife and was ready to fight 7 ft tall Stab Dad?  
---
I mean, he prob wasn't according to the artist, but its a cute interpretation &lt;3 
---
This reminds me of a while back when there was a glitch that made having 2 killers in one game possible - turning around and seeing a random huntress without knowing what was going on was *slightly* unnerving
---
“TOXIC SURVIVORS LEATHERFACE NEEDS BUFF”
---
I do t mind this one. I just hate the hospital
---
It's sooo cute how 5 ft Frank is ready and willing to fight 8 ft Michael because he touched Jules &lt;3 
---
I changed it as a hex for balance reasons, such as what if a killer camps the survivor on the hook. 
---
That's what I call a cosplay, good fucking job
---
It's easy chase points to get a send off at the gate.
---
No it's Wendy from twitter
---
That would make escape practically impossible. It's fine the way it is. 
---
Well you did camp so they're not wrong? 
---
Entity you drunk shit go home and get some rest you forgot the gate!
---
Playing at low ranks, it takes FOREVER for anyone to do a gen, double that if there’s ruin. Playing high ranks, if the killer doesn’t keep pressure, the game’s over in 10 min, 5 if it’s a coordinated SWF. How do you even begin to go about balancing that? 
---
Aren't mori's kept secret from survivors?
---
\#justdoctorthings
---
They used to reduce the cool downs of the attacks so much that you could instantly hit again after even a successful hit. Now that both have been nerfed they aren't viable to use in the current meta as a 20% reduced cool down doesn't do much. And even with STBFL it doesn't work like it used to. 
---
I know but this is nearly nothing like it. The machine gun build had no cool down at all. It took under a second to recover from both types of attacks. If you get a 50% cool down it would take about 1 second from a missed attack and 35% from a successful one it would take more than a second. These changes would make it just enough better to be usable. 
---
&gt; is it really worth the points gained for the last hook/kill points vs time.
---
you have to understand that there are a lot of absolute dumbfucks who play this game and they'd rather waste an hour doing nothing instead of moving on to the next match
---
“60% of the time, it works every time!”- Unbreakable marketing slogan
---
Well hello Mr Fancy Pants
---
Yep
---
Typical killer, don't you dare interrupt his kill or its facecamp time
---
It’s where the player’s camera is and the reason it is a weird fish-eye lense is be cause of the dream world effects
---
I just feel like that would be on the survivor to not get trapped and then being the lone survivor. It's just that usually with most or all other killers trying to find and kill the last survivor can be a hassle, so i figure that would be a Pig specific strength.
---
The last one would be a good perk honestly 
---
I rarely use NOED myself, but I always run it with an end game build. Remember Me, Blood Warden. Might as well start a new gen at that point.
---
OoO and urban immersion. 
---
It really does vary but I agree that many accusations of tunnelling are actually bad survivor plays - poor evasions or shitty unhooks.
---
Yo what if reverse prank. Comes out a day early as the ultimate joke.
---
Sure Jan. 
---
Who said it's original? I was just playing along with the original Lerys comment,which wasn't made by me btw. 
---
And what's your excuse for being nosey in other people's argument? Couldn't resist the white knight within? 
---
So... killers are complaining about you surviving? No, it’s not toxic. Both the flash light and pallet were put in the game for these purposes lol.
---
Yea let me do totems during mid chase. It just hutrs when you loop someone for 5 gens and then he outplay you with noed. Sure its easy to tell your swf "hes playing like a bot so better do totems cuz hes gonna have noed" but its a diffrent story in solo queue. Randoms usually just hold m1 only on gens and you cant tell them to clean totems.
---
Are u dumb? You have to fast vault out of the locker for it to work...man read the perk descriptions.
---
You want to uninstall the game because you can't reach rank 1??
---

I think my preistess has alzheimers the way her burner is shaking.  Is there anything I can do to help her?
---
Well that’s 8 minutes of my life I’m not getting back. 
---
yes, but when the killer brings a secret offering, everyone knows it's a mori, i think the devs should remove that, it's pointless tbh even if it's just cypress or ivory
---
Never disagreed with you just didn't like that you acted like a dick about it. Also that was suppose to be a smart ass comment, my real reason is because you're acting like a dick about. 
---
It's just the main fact that she is a female character so she is smaller than others plus her skin is dark so she blends in even more 
---
Killers get screwed with dc's and survivors killing themself on hook, it's a 2 way thing.
---
No they changed it a while ago to buff her.
---
Tough luck. You don't get to police other people's thoughts and actions. Maybe if you're used to living in communist country but otherwise don't tell others what they can or can't do. 
---
And try to butt out other people's argument. It's not attractive and you look like someone else's second account now. 
---
I am shocked ow many people in tis thread are either not reading or never get the map that don't understand what is happening here. 
---
So where does it apply?
---
it's funny 'cause when you finish cleansing the totem and stand up, you'll get trapped afterward
---
i guess ultimately bc you need killers so you can have lobbies, and in turn it doesn’t hurt to have that safety net/crutch as more compensation for playing killer (if fsr getting more bp in theory isn’t enough). 
---
The effect acts similar to a terror radius, If you can hear it at all you know she’s close. The noise comes from all around so you can’t tell the spirits direction
---
it’s the spider-man pointing at himself meme
---
Actually what you can do is quickly turn but keep movin same direction, to make the survivor hesitate. Might cut one loop, but doesn't cost you anything
---
I think... I'm in love, that cosplay is phenomenal!! Good.job!!
---
Obviously the ratio is 1:1 when queue times take 10-20 minutes, it should be 4:1 like it was back in the days, but the killer buffs made it 1:1
---
Yo, did you manage to hear any voice lines for Ash? I'm really curious what they are and when they play.
---
https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ
---
This guys video helped me a lot.
---
i really like the diversion one 
---
So when they’re in my terror radius they can hear it?
---
I didn't make level increments for Combat Ready, shit. 
---
I like it!
---
yeah a mode where there are 8 survivors and 2 killers lol, identity V already has it too XD
---
ass isnt thicc enough
---
I had just downed a survivor, picked him up amd saw my aura when I turned around.
---
I dont hate any other perk than noed, im sorry
---
If the survivor is inside the terror radius of the husk left behind when you enter the phase walk they do not hear the whoosh effect. If they are with I think it’s 16m if you are in the phase walk they hear the wind effect but they can not tell the spirits direction they just know that you are nearby (I don’t remember the exact value)
---
Why is it always this dam leatherfaces that do this
---
Oh okay thanks, I was asking cus I didn’t know if they knew by hearing when I was standing still or actually phasing when were at a loop
---
The devs don know shit about bugs themselves.. so you dont need to be a dev to know this
---
No worries, enjoy your new killers!
---
you need to double pip for it. 
---
At green+, only if the stars align. I almost had the exact same situation as you as Hag. I completely destroyed the survivors and that meant my Chaser emblem was garbage even without a camping penalty. The system's fundamentally flawed.
---
Diversion makes scratch marks. It was added with the Legion update.
---
And WGLF should still give the bonus BP.
---
Press space bar for the secondary action.
---
\-Learn to cut corners (strafe, dont just hold W)
---
\-Don't respect pallets
---
\-Learn when to moonwalk
---
\-Survs almost always spawn on the opposite side of the map
---
Just wonder if any of the devs got 2 pips during testing and they were like "Oh yeah, this is totally doable." It seems near impossible to me. And I'm in the lower ranks.
---
Anyone made a Cosplague pun yet? What was that in a the back? I think I’m hearing a no, okay great...
---
*clears throat* 
---
Don’t you mean... Cosplague. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
---
Ahhh this reminds me of the time I roleplayed Huntress for a match. I’ll see if I can find the image/edit out the usernames and post it later.
---
Well, if Unbreakable wasn't a thing, then slugging would be hella more annoying than it already is.
---
What a little wuss...
---
He lost 1 chase and DC'd.
---
What rank was this?
---
This shows everything wrong with hitboxes : you just had to turn your mouse slightly after your swing and due to the massive hit boxes she got downed. She shouldn’t have been downed if it was a few years ago.
---
Yes... it was rank 12.
---
Its not broken, the new system now asks for a double pip
---
Imagine going down the basement to rescue someone and you see a camping leatherface, you look around and see an ANOTHER camping leatherface in the basement and your like "fuck  this im leaving" and you go back up the stairs TO SEE A DAM LEATHERFACE BLOCKING THE STAIRS
---
Unless you camped/tunneled for dying light idk how these guys died to a lvl 13 Myers with no ruin or noed.
---
This would be a treat for me.
---
the survivor had a dull key or skeleton key and found the hatch because that is the only way a survivor can escape without doing all the gens and the hatch would have spawned has there were already 3 gens completed and only 2 survivors left and there needs to be one more generator completed than survivors left for the hatch to spawn
---
Nurse ignores pallet and looping mechanics, but her fatigue mechanic makes her more vulnerable to juking and line of sight breaks. Obviously that's not enough to balance her, nurse is the best killer in the game, but as a survivor you at least have options on the table. There's a game plan, there's back and forth, there's interactivity.
---
Legion also ignores pallet and looping mechanics, but on top of that he has instant attack recovery (so he ignores juking) and he gets to close distance like a normal killer instead of guessing, teleporting, and wheezing, so he's not really vulnerable to line of sight breaks.
---
Legion turns off all survivor gameplay. He's still not very good because his power takes too long to down, but whether you win or lose you will have zero fun against Legion. Your actions matter so little you may as well just hold W until the Legion's power recharges and he downs you.
---
Sharing karma - 300 BP
---
I'm so glad I don't do the Twitter.
---
Great concept my friend!
---
It is an explanation, of course. But every human being has the ability to reflect their behaviour and adjust it accordingly. (Or should have)
---
Thats why speaking to each other is so important.
---
Its a game, and even if it feels good to humiliate your enemy even more, one can overthink it and overcome the urgency to be an asshole.
---
Thats what it means to be human. Thinking :)
---
PS: i am no native english speaker, so feel free to point out flaws and correct me.
---
Imagine the body blocking, unless you have one person with iron grasp and agitation and a leather face to clean up the blockers, you’re not going to get a kill.
---
What about the finger jewelry? Did you have happen to borrow some or...?
---
Man you're good. Congrats on killing a potato who runs out in the open, dies, then runs in a straight line against huntress. Very impressive.
---
Good save buddy, I saw it too and looked for this exact comment.
---
Doesn't even bug me, lol it only proves the salt when it happens
---
Bbq, ruin, Dying light, the lesion perk about the 2 man gens.
---
It's one of the best counters against adrenaline and allows even the bad killers to be seen as a threat.
---
Cause where's the fun in destroying a baby killer, unless you also managed to survive it's NOED? Also, you guys keep saying how stupid immersed survivors are, but when exits are powered, you know that the killer knows that you want to open them asap, so ofc he's going to beeline there, meanwhile you can hide, search for the totem, or as long as the killer is far enough away, even rescue the teammate that got downed and hooked due to NOED.
---
It seems like you guys forget that this is a horror game, and yes, NOED is more easily countered by SWF, and that could be balanced, but if noed goes, atleast make adrenaline go as well, cause it's use is going to skyrocket after that.
---
Btw: I don't even use Noed, unless I'm like super triggered.
---
So you're Negan doesn't belong to tekken 7?
---
Who shit in your cereal? Yikes. Relax 😂
---
Oh, I see now! I didn't understand that he blocked you. Yep, then it surely counts as taking the game hostage and the killer should be banned :(
---
just dont slug 4Head
---
Sorry, it's only me who is stupid here! Hope you reported him in the game + send the screenshot somewhere
---
Why not?
---
Yeah I made the WGLF addition so that way survivors that take the high risk play can still be rewarded without dying to quickly and potentially losing bloodpoints. If they ever add this into the game it will just help those that want to be altruistic, not exactly help the whole team. The only time I see this being strong is when the whole team body blocks a hook running this version of WGLF
---
Your mind does not need changing, you're on the right track 
---
Please, next time put something like "he's been blocking me for 20 minutes etc" for dummies like me :)
---
wait what
---
how does that leave scratch mark in the first place
---
I'm guessing once it hits a certain area it will just leave scratch marks everywhere in a small radius
---
Thank you :D
---
Lol wasn’t even you in the video why you so toxic? The man is just trying to show us something that happened while he played and was excited to show it off, while you over here being negative get outta here lol 
---
Thank you :)
---
Somebody recently saved me that excact way when I was downed. Exit gates were opened and I was going to be on my last hook. Poor killer, but it was awesome
---
Look like legion passed lol
---
Fucking hell, that explains a lot. Thanks lol
---
Play survivor. 
---
so instead of investing this time and money into making servers happen sooner they waste it on... this?
---
If theyre a baby killer then they shouldnt be in high ranks. As for adrenaline, I only run that if im playing solo and if my surv doesnt have better perks ( i run empathy, botany, self care, and borrowed. As of lately my claudette hasnt gotten lucky with the bp tree for a borrowed but i run unbreakable). Noed is ridiculous now bc its literally every killers setup (ps4) 90% chance that the killer will run [noed, ruin, bbq, and something dumb like deerstalker]. Each killer these days dont want to have to try very hard so they play crutch perks. These perks alollow bad killers (and kinda survs) to get higher rank where they need to be carried and are detrimental to the team. 
---
Absolutely amazing!! 
---
You screw your friend over by SWFing as red/purple and then you wonder why he quits? Wow.
---
Yeah, but it could also work for injured, as in already getting 50% healing progress in downed state aswell.
---
But it could end up being a little strong with Ash's upcoming perk, which turns 50% of the healing progress while downed into wiggle progress, therefore automatically granting you 25% wiggle progress.
---
Yes I do.
---
There's nothing like dying on the hook bc the only teammate coming to get you is coming at 0.5 mph with urban waddle when the killer is obviously on the other side of the map
---
Or don't wanna play the game since the last update since it broke so much
---
Me and a friend of mine went up against a myers on the myers map and right off the bat about a minute into the game I am working on a gen and I see him chasing my friend and the first pallet he gets stuned by makes him rage and DC he even had brought in a mori.
---
Bruce Campbell isn't an A-lister, but he's always played Ash with a passion in the movies all the way up to the TV show. I'd rather see a season 4 of Ash vs. Evil Dead or an actual Evil Dead video game (with likeness and voice of Bruce), but until then, I'm glad he gets to be in one of my favorite video games.
---
Wow that's balanced. You don't see that very often.
---
 Thank you.
---
probably because some people have played when there were actual infinites in the game. 
---
Stop getting so triggered and move on Jesus 
---
This has happened to me too many times
---
I find him fun to play as
---
this happened to me once, i head on a Clown and i thought he DCs because of that while my friend yelled at me why did i DC and i was so confused but i got my BPs anyway
---
Well according to your logic then you shouldn't whine when you get camped all day because most of survivors t bag at the exit. Now what kind of logic is that?
---
Why would you want to rank down? Also there is no reward for reaching rank 1 anyways. Showing devotion level should be a thing as well, if I get stomped and see they’re a high level I won’t feel so bad
---
What is your problem lol? Just wanted to upload a video that i thought was decent onto reddit. Is this thread solely made for insane rank 1 killer plays? No.. Its a public thread were anyone can post anything.
---
Im going to make an assumption here, correct me if im wrong.. 
---
Your perks : DS - Adrenaline - Borrowed Time - Object of Obsession
---
Item - Purple Flash with purple lense etc
---
Offering - Cold wind Farm 
---
Traits - Tea-bags and click your flashie at every pallet drop. Reports killers for being decent. DC's on the regular. Farm randoms.
---
Feel free to share some of your "impressive" huntress plays. 
---
Stop right there son! It's illegal to juke the killer, didn't you know that? Hand over your survivor card right now you aren't a true survivor
---
Update- I won against Freddy! I was straight out of there though, wasn't hanging about
---
I have a bad feeling that when dedicated servers go up that you will actually be able to walk through them..
---
my teammate wasnt able to heal any of survivors whole game
---
Sloppy butcher , healing is slow enough as it is let's make it even slower yayyy
---
They're rare, but it always makes me laugh, "stop using the one mechanic you should use to buy time and survive!"
---
the true answer to this post.
---
unless you give the super pussies a reason to fight eachother they'll keep bullying those lower down. society has protected bullies so much they now think its normal behavior and its leaked into gaming the past 10 or so years.
---
\*confused screaming\*
---
I press W and turn my wrist on my ps4 controller yup. Lmao idiot 
---
I legit jumped in one of my recent games as Doc because the hallucination spawned right in front of me. That dude's scary!
---
I just wanna see the video he took down where he was getting at tru3.
---
Im not the one claiming to be a superstar mate. If you've nothing constructive to add can you kindly slide on? You're boring me 😴
---
My mistake. Just shows how little attention i payed to it.
---
Good apology. Seemed genuine.
---
I agree, the in game cgi looked actually sweet af.
---
LMAO
---
Yup
---
It certainly feels like it, or killers have had a speed boost.
---
No kink shaming.
---
Well, a simple apology isn't going to undo all the crap that he did, but it is good that he acknowledges the mistakes he did and strives to never repeat them.
---
But if he really does change then eventually people will see it was a real apology 
---
&gt;You can hit them over and over mend times keep getting longer until it takes 5+ minutes to mend.
---
Won't they just go down...
---
1. There are better and easier killers to learn, yes. That does not make Freddy bad. But hey, if they're self-caring, they're off gens anyway, so you get stall from that.
---
8.2. You can do it more often, but you aren't guaranteed (or almost guaranteed) anything with Spirit. I don't see how Spirit gets anything out of her mindgame that Freddy doesn't - she gets a hit if she succeeds, or a pallet drop if she fails (since creating a deadzone should not be your goal as Spirit - she doesn't have stall like Freddy does... not like she needs deadzones to do well). Freddy succeeds either way.
---
1. You don't lose any time that you aren't making up by putting them to sleep. I know you're agreeing Hag is good, it's just that we disagree on *how* good she is.
---
They can't end the game quickly versus Freddy no matter how emboldened they are. They could end the game, yes, and potentially in their favour, but it certainly would not be a quick game. Against Jen's squad? Zubat? Absolutely, Freddy would lose. So would Spirit. Hell, probably so would Nurse, unless she had omegablinks. But having weaknesses does not make a killer bad, and neither does losing to the top echelon of survivors. Even against good survivors, though, Freddy can quite comfortably pull off a win.
---
I've addressed this already. These killers do not have the same time Freddy does.
---
I never claimed to be one either, but you saw fit to try to insult me for having something you don't have lol. 
---
Especially since they buffed totem placement, sometimes that one last totem is impossible to find. Plowed through Ruin the other day with the team because the totem was just so well hidden. I could bring small game, but that'd be a waste of a perk slot if the killer doesn't run NOED, Ruin or if all 5 totems are easy to track down to begin with.
---
Meg needs a hoodie skin ASAP
---
You can hit all 4 and force them to endlessly mend for minutes
---
It's an offering that killers can bring. Each is slightly different and allows the killer to kill survivor's by their own hand instead of on the hook (generally after hooking em once)
---
When the moon hits your eye , like a big pizza pie... That's a mori 
---
I never understood why people do this when in less than a few minutes you can just go get a gen and exit gate which either they'll be forced to come after you or you'll escape.  Why waste so much time?
---
That's more disgusting that the Plague vomit.
---
Yeah damn that’s shot it down, if this was from the start you could of had separate devotion levels for each side but you can’t separate it all now
---
Probably a coping mechanism for what people don't like about the game. Better than ONLY complaints in the sub Hanna
---
Once a whole team dc'd on me. 
---
It was then that I joined the Legion. 
---
Change the third perk and call it “You got this” - Within the Killer’s radius increases Repairing speed.
---
I just want them to give you like 2k shards as a reward when gaining a Devotion level. Enough for a shrine perk or to add to a player's savings.
---
I put Pig a little bit higher and Huntress on par with Hag at least, but I agree with the most tier list.
---
Bloodpoint haven
---
Real footage of nea as the killer
---
Easy. As the game provides the option it shouldn't be hard to detect such groups and the member numbers, then apply a modifier. As example decrease gen repair speed by 33% if a group of 2, 50% if 2 groups of 2, 80% if 3, and let it take 150% as long against 4 mans. Gives the killer a lot more time to counter the coordination. To even out for non grouped survivors, give them + 15% bp if with a 2 man as solo, and + 25% if everyone else is swf. Tweak numbers as needed, this is just an example. You could also tweak other interactions. And solo surv remain pretty unaffected.
---
Who is this
---
Is there anywhere that counselors can counteract Mori
---
It also feels good when a killer complements you. This community can be so nice, sadly in doesn't stay for long but that's just human nature. :P
---
Fair enough.
---
Sorry.
---
To be fair, devotion still doesn't mean that much since it hasn't even been around for a year yet. Anyone who's been playing pre-Clown won't have their accurate time represented anyway.
---
Oof. I've used Filthy and Nasty Blades together a couple times, but it was last patch. Wonder how long it's been going on for. No one mentioned freakishly long mend times, and i usually get a good number of frenzy stabs in. 
---
Yeah it’s good to apologize but it means nothing if he doesn’t change. But i hope so, for the sake of the people he hurt. 
---
I just hope he doesn’t repeat the mistake of trying to get nudes from girls he plays with👀
---
See my reply above ^^ 
---
Dont get down again
---
10/10 would smash 
---
You should know better by now that they aren't afraid to backpeddle on stuff like that.
---
It's RANCHER not RANCOR
---
*gurgles well-roundedly*
---
that’s such a cool shirt ughhh
---
Good for him. Takes balls to own up to your shit. Looking forward to his new content.
---
?
---
For the plague’s backstory, she was in Babylon during the time of a great and dark plague. In game this sickness is part of the Plague’s power, and survivors can cleanse their sickness by using water from pools of devotion. These pools have their auras revealed all over the map once you are infected, kinda like how pig’s traps work. So the joke is that the Babylonians could have easily solved their predicament by doing what the survivors do and use pools of devotion to cleanse their sickness. 
---
They reworked and overnerfed it to hell
---
If you downed them quickly you'll get more chaser points.
---
okay then.
---
Already posted.
---
People that complain about legion are pussies
---
Just do the last gen and escape through the exit gates
---
His trap plays were on point all game. Needless to say it was panic stations all round for me lol. And a few profanities thrown at my TV 😂
---
Glad to see he's getting his shit together. Still *really* don't like him but this is a slight improvement. 
---
You didn't hatch standoff, I assume? 
---
Hell yea I'm higher devotion than tru3 talent and he was playing a full two years before me
---
#WRITE YOUR FANFICS

***Too little, too late?*** Most likely.
---
I lowered my standards to play with anything lower than 250 cuz apparently people don't want to play with anyone that doesn't use default skin free survivors.
---
Still 👏 a 👏 pedo 👏 
---
Wait what? How do you see yo self when you turn around?

Okay so it's not just me, the amount of games (killer and survivor) I've played where all but 1 disconnected and it's just a long ass farm match so we can at least get some BP, actually having more fun with fallout 76 atm
---
&lt;3 thank you very much, that was very uplifting!
---
I got the same exact pieces too, nice!
---
I havent played PC dbd in almost 2 years, so I'll have a bunch of the basic bitch map offerings to waste when I get back. Still have a few left on ps4, along with a couple moon offerings.
---
When he entered a lobby sometimes I heard a groovy
---
Happened to me a bunch of times while playing as The Spirit.
---
Give me the hard numbers to prove your fact c:
---
He's my favorite legion. I assume he gets less fan-content because he's not a default skin and he's not Susie, but I definitely like this skin best.
---
😐
---
I can give you the names of some murderers and rapists and you can go ahead and start bitching and moaning about them all day long but for some reason I think you'd be bored by that wouldn't you? Yeah I don't really believe you when you wanna pretend you hate Ochido for those things, I think they're your scapegoat so you don't have to admit that the REAL reason you hate ochido is because you're a little babykiller who doesn't like watching his fellow babykillers get teabagged and destroyed.
---
That's the way I see you noobs, do you wanna admit that at least a portion of the ochido-haters are like that or do you wanna go full-on 0 credibility?
---
Honestly pretty solid perk ideas. They don’t fit with the perk names, though. Like what does being deputy have to do with making the killer attack slower? Still solid ideas imo though.
---
Actually the opposite since the main people that complain continues to play.
---
It's just you. 
---
Haddonfield favors Trapper like you absolutely would not believe. Picture all of the reasons why Springwood could possibly favor him and compound them. It's arguably his best map along with Pale Rose. 
---
But I would agree that especially given the "Strode Loop" Haddonfield is very much Survivor sided otherwise. He's just a special case. 
---
It’s been happening in a ton of my games lately too (granite, I’ve also been having WiFi issues and done it myself too many times by accident) but it’s ridiculous!
---
How many people disconnected around you?
---
Entity: no selfie while working, Mr. Carter.
---
Thanks! also agree I didn't expect these comments. I should maybe have posted just a pic of just the cosplay if I wanted a less charged set of comments but also I didn't take any of those so c'est la vie.
---
yes
---
Had a Claudette let me get to struggle because she was walking to the hook trying to save her sprint burst.
---
😍😛😛😛😛😛
---
Doesnt seem like he regrets it much
---
Look at his face
---
This is all bullshit
---
This is why I run Whispers on her
---
I mean... you’re not wrong. 
---
It would remove the purpose of the hatch, give a chance to the last man standing
---
Great job! Did you make the sweater or buy it from somewhere?
---
Ngl when I was a noob I did that before...
---
I’m waiting to see if he actually changes or if the apology is meaningless 
---
Thanks! I bought a plain black hoodie and I painted on the stripes and arm logos using puffy paint. And added the fake blood, which was the first recipe from this: https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Fake-Blood. 
---
I'm sure we all used sprint burst as noobs, but this was a rank 7. 
---
When I died and spectated he was crouching around with a key looking for the hatch, with 2 gens done.
---
Tbh it looks forced... Like someone has something on him and made him do this
---
It's not so bad if you only use it to follow like 10 people, but yeah.
---
I follow a bunch of Hearthstone personalities, some Warframe devs, and the Artifact (I hope Valve can fix that game....) personalities too. It's never too bad, though occassionally someone does say something political and whooooo boy does the shit start flying.
---
Of course it'll be meaningless, look at the fact he won't say the dev teams name, the fact he says he's only saying he's sorry and going to change and that he's working on it, not before he got banned 3 times and hardware banned on pc and didn't say he'd change at any point in console, his whole stream breeds toxicity and isn't a nice place to chill and even when he plays other games his sole intention is to abuse players, take a look at that pc Chinese knock off that came out (I can't remember the name) 
---
Let’s not lie here. Cleansing totems is an objective. It rewards you with points and potentially punishes the killer. It’s not a main objective necessary for completing the trial but it’s an objective none the less. But I understand and agree it feels shitty to play well the entire trial just to be insta killed the entire trial.
---
Surely you use some basic logic here and understand why killers use the “just cleanse totems” argument. You guys run past dull totems every trial looking for Ruin. When I play survivor, I always cleanse dull totems. Not because I’m scared of NOED but because it’s literally right there and free easy points. If every survivor on the team cleansed ONE dull totem plus Ruin, killers wouldn’t even use NOED I guarantee you that. Also, totems are extremely often in painfully obvious spots. Even if you don’t want to cleanse totems, it’s not hard to take a mental note of where the Hex totem will potentially be. I have a hard time finding sympathy for survivor mains because of these reasons.
---
I’ll be honest with you. I’m apathetic on NOED being nerfed. I don’t use it, ever. So nerf the hell out of it, it won’t affect me. Not because it’s a “crutch perk” but because in my mind, it’s anticipating for failure and I just don’t like that idea. I’d rather use any other perk that will benefit me the entire trial like Enduring or something. Plus, NOED is really effective against bad survivors and not as effective against good ones.
---
These are just my truthful thoughts on the matter.
---
9 feet tall?
---
So people stopped sending him footage for his once removed montages and he’s begging for daddy to let him back in?
---
As I mentioned in another comment it wasn't the dying that annoyed him. He didn't mind queueing with me because if forces him to improve quickly, but even so what do you suggest I do? Tell him I don't want to play with him on a game he doesn't actually enjoy because of the camping?
---
still a pedophile 
---
Corn is life
---
How about this - When an ally fully heals you or interferes in the healing process (starts healing you at any point of the healing bar), the Stage 1 thing will do whatever its supposed to do!
---
No offense but the first one is trash. The entity isnt on our side. Period. This breaks the whole lore of the game
---
I did that once, as Leatherface. I just stood behind a wall near the exit gate, and waited. Two survivors stood right on my face.
---
I had charge addons, and managed to get one of them (he even missed his DS afterwards). Instant DC.
---
Kate ok, but Meg is way too flat
---
But if a survivor dc the killer get some points for it also it’s bad for the rest of the survivors as well. I am annoyed by dc of fellow mates but I am way more upset about a killer disliking a map and dicing and I lose my pip....
---
Oh thank God. I'm sick of Asians ruining my games.
---
Guess we have to watch out for more than just those Bear Traps.
---
Why are you getting downvotted for simply missing something?
---
Get it on xbox or PS4 problem solved 
---
Were you nervous? Awkward pose here lol 
---
What's the difference of saying BHVR or dbd devs means the same shit. Also I don't think his apology is sincere.
---
I just think it's silly to have a strategy potentially countered only by borrowed time, DS still(?) and SWF (or randoms willing to take hits for other randoms being camped but that's harder to coordinate). I haven't played or watched a good  4 man SWF but I've seen mentions on Reddit, so if it completely trumps a killer I guess it's somewhat understandable but I still don't agree that it's a good strategy to just gen rush and force 1 player to not play. Does it work and force a killer loss? Sure, but why should the killer get to decide 1 player doesn't get to play the game? Assuming pips are the killers focus, it's a bad idea to camp because technically they could lose all gens from it, but I'm not going to just leave a teammate to die for that, if possible. 
---
I agree there are some massive twats on killer. Had a Billy 90% charge me after first hook and stayed there until I died, no equipment, no tbag and didn't even loop him all that long. Just decided to be a cunt and so I didn't get to play the game that time. I'm used to it though, I get tilted but it's whatever, new player comes, doesn't get to play the game and quits and that sucks massively.
---
That was me...
---
Many had the idea, not just Bricky. It would be kinda cool, but imagine allowing the killer to search the best spots on the map, especially in maps like The Game, too much power imo.
---
I’m a killer main, have never used DS outside of adept Laurie. And I knew what DS used to be like.
---
Enduring is already great with Spirit Fury. DS is now NOT comparable to any other iteration it has had. Enduring shouldn’t affect perk based stuns to make DS and Head On more viable options, DS is only 3 seconds anyways, it’s less of a counter and more of a dead perk when that becomes 0.75 seconds and requiring to be hooked and then downed again.
---
Think about the chances of unhooking yourself though, to balance this perk I think the broken status affect should occur and if u use deliverance it does not give you the benefits of the perk
---
Damn that's gotta be like 999 wood
---
Yea but if you're going to say a sincere, important, actual sorry to someone properly would you say their name or call them by a nickname or call them something else? Maybe I'm just looking too deep into it but I definitely don't feel it's sincere or like he actually cares about them at all. 
---
Must be a Claudette main 
---
Ignore these other people/ I agree that it should not be possible
---
10 fps lmao I'm good
---
I only really follow Hearthstone people, but every now and then I get into local Twitter drama and I really wish I didn't.
---
People accusing eachother of rape and attempted murder just for some imaginary internet points. Why can't we be like Reddit and just say "Legion is bad" for internet points instead of trying to get people arrested?
---
Yeah it's the same thing
---
Great job BHVR!  Release more DLC instead of fixing your broke ass game. 
---
Just because the hate is strong for Ochido here doesn't mean anything. Many still watch Ochido we just don't post about it all day .
---
Legion = Someone that can't play Nurse.  
---
Plague = Someone that can't play Huntress.
---
Only thing is Plague is moderately fun to play against.
---
Why the hook backwards doe?
---
After a rough analysis of this pic I don’t think this picture belongs to you as I saw the play button at the bottom left. Either that or you recoded this week on PlayStation as that play button is from PlayStation and just uploaded this screen shot. Ok now I’ll stop being a pedantic c*nt now and say, OMG THIS HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME!!!
---
How does that make it any different?
---
Oh, so now the ~~talking cheese~~ guy who paints his face and doesn't know what a magnet does is going to preach to us.
---
Seriously. Talk about a "if your username is from (x) then your opinion doesn't count" moment.
---
They can be a bad person but if you're harassing black people who stole a loaf of bread and not giving a care in the world about a white guy who just murdered 7 people then you might have some other motives for hating the black guy. Using race here will really confuse the SJW reddit-crowd, try to talk yourself out of this one bitch, I'd go with "oh I guess I"m dumb".
---
And Mr X as the killer, his theme better be C gonna give it to ya
---
Watch the new Ash Vs Evil Dead DLC trailer
---
Last person hatch is not a problem.  I do it all the time and sometimes it's automatic anyway as they tend to get it while I hooked the 3rd person.  But letting all survivors go is a rarity for me.  Usually it requires the team at least having 2 survivors that I like and them not being douchebags.  Otherwise I just spare the survivors that I like and kill the rest.
---
Dude. No. Stop with that pseudo-psychiatrist bullshit. It's fun because Legion is a very active killer who makes for some hectic chases. The only other killer that has something like that is Nurse but she gets interrupted nonstop by herself with the stun after the blink. 
---
If there's any people who really get off on making others suffer, ie. kids or socially problematic people, they only do that with Legion because ya'll nonstop complain about him.
---
Who cares? Anyone who identifies as a "Juggalo" is sad....
---
A bunch of real shitty carnival music and angsty twats dressed like the clowns they are. 
---
RIP the booty
---
interesting. could be bad optimization on dbd’s part with the current update, presuming that your setup runs other games perfectly fine. 
---
Framerate is much better than it was before. At least I can play my game lol
---
I agress 
---
Ah yes, only swf is allowed to have fun, I totally forgot that! I am such a dummy :)
---
Thanks for reminding me, friend :) 
---
And yes, killers should not be allowed to have fun, i mean, what the hell do they expect when they queue up? Dafuq, all a bunch of idiots these 'killer-players', lololololol
---
Shitty Legion meme police.
---
...This meme is certified as dank. He has his noice meme liscense. Carry on.

---
and 30 dollars a day at mcdonalds
---
I see you are also a man of culture. 
---
Directly for winning I agree just rushing the gens counters it well. But I won't leave a new player alone to be camped if possible. Id rather risk the game to attempt to unhook him so he can play. Randoms at high rank I might leave, not that camping happens all that often at red/purple.
---
Also, the killer is responsible for camping and denying the fun of a player.
---
Better choice when you can't even play your better choice? Lmaooo
---
Whoever is down voting this post either
---
1. Thinks it is just spreading how to do the glitch
---
Or
---
2. Wants to keep it in the game
---
Ive seen people use dead hard to get around a trap to get to ruin.
---
GG
---
look at this guy reviewing memes and not even giving a score
---
Thank you kind sir.
---
It can be hard at times not to get caught up in it when you get douches and go pure sweat mode lol. 
---
F
---
For some reason Claudette face Leatherfaces are always the biggest morons.
---
All you need for that is one spoon of desync, 1 cup of dc and after 7min in the oven you got ur self a nice depip. 
---
This is the comment right here. Everyone says they can’t find survivors in the corn, but as a survivor main, I’ve never gotten away by going through the corn.
---
They appear close to them and looking in their direction
---
Okay bye now you really tried and then you failed but at least you knew when to walk away.
---
ya killers safe pipping on a 4k because there weren't enough hook events is legit
---
An adult asks an underage woman for nudes
---
Literal pedo definition
---
I'm aware, I don't care if people watch him or not. But most of his fanbase like to ignore the fact that the toxic behavior has less to do with the game and more of the kind of person he is. 
---
Ah man see you were a decently convincing troll but this one is a bit on the nose isn't it? Not your best work champ.
---
Because the killer messaged them while playing DBD
---
That third perk is super strong lol 
---
Tldr: i tbagged and was a cock but its okay because reasons.
---
In his backstory his dad was a dentist wanna ended up needing braces so no candy or anything until he went behind his back and ate some he then turned into the wanna we know
---
Because they don't like survivors who tbag at the gate. So apparently me telling them it's not holding a game hostage is me 'supporting' tbagging at the gate. (Hint: It's not)
---
People don't know how to be objective, only emotional. 
---
They don't want to hear anything that conflicts with how they feel. A survivor tbagging at gate is an asshole (this is true) so therefore it's all their fault and poor killer is being held hostage(This is untrue)
---
Tl;dr: They're salty crybabies
---
I make sure I hook twice before I start killing.
---
Yeah but say out loud your own mistakes in front of a camera, knowing how many people will see this is probably not that easy
---
They weren't broken. Just the prompt to heal didn't appear and nobody could heal them.
---
Do you have any pictures of you playing, by chance? would love to see some to hold me off until Tuesday!
---
If I don't start a match in windowed mode then Shift+Enter to fullscreen it, the game will close down. Among other things that only DBD has problems with, like my entire PC hard crashing because I dared to change the aspect ratio of the game.
---
Hardly think me being an asshole directly affects DBD in all honesty.
---
Fuck that guy. 
---
The rest of us have figured out how *not* to click on shit we don't like.
---
I'm confused. Do they honestly think My Name is Bruce was a documentary or s omething?
---
Humans are unique in that we’ve developed both self-awareness and empathy. Some people would overcome the desire to assert dominance, but most people in Dead by Daylight won’t. After being helpless and endlessly pursued by a large hulking enemy that aims to kill them and their friends multiple times, survivors get a huge release of testosterone from overcoming what was originally the “alpha-male” so to speak. (When men win at videogames, they get the same neurological response as besting another male in combat.) People’s instincts aren’t all terrible though. As I stated before, the instinct to protect your allies and acquaintances is high as well, so you’ll see many survivors do everything they can to save teammates even in the face of death.
---
Woah, i was talking about Billy
---
Then yes prestige. I do it just for the heck of it.
---
The magic of the DbD subreddit
---
Well, I don't have fun playing against flashlights, Dead Hard and Adrenaline either, but hey I can't complain about this because I play a certain character that the community doesnt like, give me a break.
---
This morning I (rank 9), was in a three Gen chase against a rank 14 Legion. Had to do the other two myself because after I got hooked, the team turned into a sack of potatoes. Barely pipped. 
---
You don't actually get more rare items. it's like a 2% increase
---
I know right? When content was still allowed, I had to watch his videos to see what was coming out, until I found some dude named Agility who was more informative, quicker, to the point, and a better sense of humor. I have tried to avoid SleevedBiker since, but every once in a while I accidentally click one of his videos. 
---
I HADN'T PLAYED SINCE A BIT BEFORE PLAGUE CAME OUT BECAUSE OTHER GAMES AND LIFE, SO I'M BACK DOWN IN LOW RANKS AGAIN.
---
AND I JUST HAD A HAG PLACE MULTIPLE TRAPS ON ME AND THEN FACECAMP.
---
EXCUSE ME, DO YOU KNOW HOW TO HAG?
---
Yeah the issue is when chapters are released plenty more bugs just come. So I feel sorry for the team that works on bug fixes because every few months it seems like their work does not even matter because it's overshadowed by yet another glitch.
---
Lol this dumb bitch is trying to do a fucking straw poll and claim that as some type of evidence.
---
Fucking anecdotal evidence lmao. Idiot.
---
Go back to your fake doctors degree boy.
---
It's not just me that thinks that he looks like Josh Brolin.
---
Can confirm, gave up like a month ago and now I'm back, saw that I'm a lower rank than before. Oh well, I guess I'll just rank myself up, not too har-- oh wait.
---
Why is there a perk that punishes survivors for not focusing on totems as well as gens?
---
And then you realize it's a hillbilly
---
For real. It’s almost like some people haven’t grasped the simple concept of just scrolling by something they don’t like instead of being an dick. 
---
No I just have open opinions, you silly.
---
I like Ochido, I don't care about his personality or him as a person . Same with other streamers, I watch people who are good at the game and have fun with it. 
---
I like tru3 and ochido, basically total opposites in terms of the kind of person and player they are
---
Literally every killer can get a survivor eventually. That’s the point. In an extended 1v1 the killer should always be the eventual winner seeing as there are 4 survivors and 1 killer
---
You cannot be helped at this point
---
You look so happy, lucky! :)
---
That is for you to decide. In reality, right and wrong, good and bad - they are concepts humans  have created. None of that exists in nature. Male mammals have an instinct to assert dominance and compete to be the alpha-male. As animals, we too have the same instincts that society has suppressed. Games like this one are a means to escape our reality and play out that power fantasy, which increases hormones like melatonin and testosterone. In short, it’s intoxicating to bm each other, and it’s in our natural desires. Overcoming those urges to humiliate your opponent is less likely while in this state of mind.
---
Same xD
---
Well... isn't that a sick move.
---
Survivors 
---
i was !!! I've never met a dev of one of my fav games before so I was ecstatic
---
Then you must be level 4-1.  In your case, you need all 4 Iridiscents.  No Gold allowed as you need 16 points to get double pip.
---
3 Iridiscents and 1 Gold only works if you are level 5 and below where you need 15 points to get double pip.
---
2 Iridiscents and 2 Golds is okay if you are level 13 and below where you can get 14 points and still double pip.
---
In summary, to double pip:
---
Level 20-13: you need at least 14 points.  That translates to 2 Iridiscents and 2 Gold.
---
Level 12-5: you need at least 15 points.  That translates to 3 Iridiscents and 1 Gold.
---
Level 4-1: you need at least 16 points.  That translates to 4 Iridiscents.  
---
I love this map as a survivor main. Whenever I see the killer approaching I run towards the corn and stop after a bit, then urban evade back arouns to where he first saw me. Works pretty much every time and yes I know I'm annoying. 
---
He voiced Ash in several Evil Dead video games in the early 2000s. I'm honestly surprised that we didn't see new ones after the Evil Dead remake.
---
I see 2 people that have ruined this game in this picture.
---
I'm sure straw polls hold up in court as evidence. 👌
---
I like kebab
---
This deserves #1 Post.
---
Also I got 10 likes to this post so obviously people experienced what I went through.
---
You must become one with the corn 
---
It’s Mathieu, a member of Behavior Interactive, which, in case you’ve forgotten, is the creator of Dead by Daylight. So yeah I’d say it’s fairly relevant to this sub. OP was probably just real excited to meet the dude and wanted to share it with reddit, and here you come being an unnecessarily sarcastic douchebag. 
---
I just checked the OP's pulse and it turns out that they *can* live without your approval. Go figure.
---
excatly and if you escape you still don't pip.
---
Apparently there were plans after the remake to have a second Army of Darkness film and later on have Mia and Ash both face off against the Deadites. Plans were scrapped, though, unfortunately. Also, in this day and age, the only licensed movie video games are either Lego interpretations, superhero or Disney games. I think the remake was released too far after the era of "license everything into a video game" during the 00s
---
I just want your attention, you're like the son I never had.
---
Because you're a kid, it's really obvious. We love you son, we just want to help you. You need to seek help, this illness is ruining you.
---
This apology seems a little forced in my opinion, but like most people I’m pretty jaded given his history. I haven’t seen any exploit vids from him recently so that’s a step in the right direction at least, but I have no idea if he’s still trying to get nudes from his fans or not.
---
Regardless, I’m curious to see if he actually sticks with this apology (being a bit cynical here but I doubt it) or if it’s just a bid for sympathy as he goes back to doing the same shit that got him in trouble in the first place. 
---
Don't get upset with him just cause he called you out for being a little bitch for absolutely no reason.
---
He was in the game as "Chuckles" in alpha.
---
https://imgur.com/a/00IN8Un. Here's a screenshot.

The video is here: https://youtu.be/u2d91TliOys

Also interesting is that Claudette and Meg were opposite ethnicities in alpha.  
---
I can't thank you enough for this comment.  
---
Still 👏 some 👏 brain 👏 on 👏 the 👏 internet 👏 left 👏   
---
She thot
---
Survivors 100%. And I am a survivor main.
---
Op made this post specifically because of me so I doubt it.
---
There actually was an Evil Dead video game for the Playstation 1.  I heard it was okay.
---
I had that too the other day when I was playing with a friend. I could not heal her no matter where we stood or which side I tried from. Some random guy on our team had to come do it.
---
Yes im so upset. You can have sloppy seconds on his dick if you like
---
No amount of anecdotal evidence will ever be proof of anything. Are you saying every outcome of straw polls should be treated as fact? 
---
And a..a Meg of all people? A gentleman Ac or shirtless David is understandable but Meg?? Must’ve been hardcore roleplaying the part of Anna’s lore where she kept girls damn
---
&gt;your 
---
wether
---
I'm arguing with an intellectual.
---
Id love that lol, im fucking corn blind
---
0/10 not a single mention of the word Coarl
---
Unironically resorting to ‘no one likes you!’
---
Yikes indeed
---
Likewise. All I see is dumb shit whenever anyone references it.
---
Change the third Perk to make the survivor letting them off the hook exposed. A little risk for the reward to balance it out.
---
Actually, I was Jane during this match. But yes, must’ve been. 
---
Just a lil note, no matter what killer i’m playing I have a soft spot for David’s.
---
I thought that was a biased comment until I read it and I agree.
---
And then prestiging in general ups your chances of getting better things in the blood web. So if the killer you're thinking about doing it to doesnt have enough good perk I suggest prestiging them
---
To me that's not farming. If I farm, I let them basically do whatever they want while I just hit them so I get BPs too. If they are smart enough, they will point at hooks so I know they understand it's a farm match and I'd hook them twice and let them heal each other as long as they want but some don't get the memo at the beginning of the match. I try to explicitly make it to tell them it's a farm game yet some don't understand lol
---
“I’m a respectful survivor” lmao
---
Whole post was a gem but I hope it was a joke on their end 😂
---
This is why Trapper is actually one of the killers I hate facing the most. The mindgame of never knowing if this ledge or pallet or grassy area has a trap set in it just makes the match so unfun for me. 
---
lmao me toooo
---
It appears he tries to moonwalk when he can see you. I assume he read up on moonwalking etc and tried mindlessly to do it. So when it failed he got upset.
---
You don't think the clown was farming? Interesting, what you think he was trying to do then?
---
I have played quite a lot of all these games I'm mentioning. It's also a matter of pattern. Think of other patterns: Korean players in FPS games usually curbstomp you. Chinese players have higher ping, are hackers, or unreasonably nice and sociable compared to the rest of their team. Japanese players tend to be quieter. American players tend to be...Americans (I would know), the like and on and on. It's a matter of noticing patterns. I agree that yes, you notice it more when it happens, but I notice a lot more patterns.
---
To balance this perk you need to keep it out of the game.
---
Perstige 1 one of your main characters and see what you think of it. I P3 Claudette and I'm not going to prestige any other characters, to me, it's not worth it. 
---
This dude. 
---
When I play Trapper this almost never happens. When I am survivor, it's almost a guarantee. Never understood why it happens this way but it does. I just summarize it as my usual crappy luck and have a good laugh about it. Love facing a competent Trapper. They can be pretty terrifying when done right!
---
Oof. Yeah. :( 
---
Did you tell him to fix his game?
---
Wait, hold on, what happened? What did he do?
---
Agreed! 
---
I know, it was a miracle. I had thrill so I knew when to go to the totems and I had haunted ground so they were afraid to do the totems. Lol.
---
This would be an interesting mechanic base if it is was much less extream.
---
You hit the nail on the head, lol. 
---
Does someone have a link to the music?
---
who gives a shit about this tool

If a survivor is better in chases than the killer, and knows the map well, he can easily run the killer around for the whole match duration. I've done it, players on YT have done it - but it's impossible against Legion, since he'll get you eventually, by virtue of ignoring your looping skill.
---
No but you can't categorically say that about ANYONE. For all you know, anyone could have done something like that and you'd be none the wiser.   
---
I've said it before, but to reiterate, I believe every girl that's said something about him. I also never said he HADN'T messaged underaged girls if you read my original response. In some countries at least one girl he messaged was definitely underaged (17 years old). My issue is primarily with him being labelled a peadophile, when he was 18 (maybe turning 19- not sure?) at the time. I don't think that short of an age gap when it comes to teenagers permits that kind of language.
---
Again, I acknowledge and believe he was being creepy. It's the use of the word peadophile I really object to. Even with believing every statement that's out there, I still don't think it's an appropriate word to use to describe his behaviour. Perhaps in some countries legally you can use the definition, but anyone would more than one braincell would know it's not an appropriate time to use it. 
---
Balanced Landing. I love making the killer think he's gonna get a free hit off the fall and just zooming away.
---
dont worry im gonna disconnect internet on april fools, YOU CANT TRICK ME
---
haha no but I almost said "pretty good job so far"

Franklin's demise / urban immersion

almost the entire time that shit happens
---
she will just stand near the hatch waiting for you to die even if you aren't in the struggling phase and 4 gens are already done
---
If by "different playstyle", you mean "having no means of defense" then yeah, your comment is correct. 
---
omg xD
---
You should feel joyous to receive such love from Bunny momma
---
He's a pedo. You respect that? He's also a manchild 
---
Can we not give him attention? Holy fuck
---
I'll admit, I really should use that perk more often.
---
They’ve said they won’t do actual lines because many languages play the game and they’d have to do it for each language 
---
Poor you, wouldn’t wish that in anyone xx
---
Adrenaline.  It's your best chance at surviving against an endgame hardcamp.  
---
I thought prestiging killers only gave just a couple extra percent chance of getting rarer add-ons, like maybe 2% or something. Am I wrong? Because I've been putting off prestiging for a while now.
---
For supporting someone’s opinion? Dude you don’t know shit about reddit at all, it’s people like you that turned this place into a toxic place so please do the world a favor and go back to you’re room at you’re parents house so you can fap all day to hentai you low life dick
---
I love all the voice acting in this game.
---
That flopped though we shouldn't do that.
---
Bond so I can see my amazing teammates crouching around staying 20 feet away from the gens at all times *sigh*
---
The people who commented... Wait...
---
Hey now, they’re weird but a lot of them are nice people, just weird as all hell. Grossly passionate about what they feel and think, while also being weird as fuck. I don’t get why you think they’re sad, let them enjoy their community like everyone else does- even if they’re super weird.
---
Jane took Feng's clothes
---
Yup I had a Trapper that kept trying to force me to farm with him at the killer shack.  He dropped me inside and trapped every single exit of the shack and refused to hook me he kept making me wiggle out so he could farm points.  It was one of the most bm things I've ever experienced and he was reported after game.
---
From somebody who plays both survivor and killer equally... Thanks, I hate it.
---
Despite my user flair, I really like urban evasion. But my favorite perk build is q&amp;q, lithe, and dance with me 
---
Doesn't matter how you start cosplaying, what matters is that you have fun doing soo!
---
good job!
---
There are two genres. Porn, and documentary.
---
Yeah I think that would be cool. You could see either of them coming with lots of corn being chopped, so it would be fair, and the killer would remove some of the excessive corn.
---
Sounds interesting 
---
Phenomenal! You did such a great job ^_^
---
Okay. But choose ONE. 
---
It's ironic that anyone on this sub is shitting on anyone else's hobbies/interests. We have a huge amount of furry's and drag fans, let's not start judging others lest we be judged.
---
This is what I’m terrible at. I love the game but never got the hang of the running and juking. I usually just avoid everyone by using Bond and avoiding people and gens until I see someone get hit far away from me
---
I said urban evasion 
---
Am I the only one that thinks the walking dead is an awful show? 
---
&gt; 100% it still doesn't make him a peadophile since they are so so close in age.
---
That is what you stated in the message before I asked you can you 100% say he is not a pedo. You are proving my point. Neither side of the argument should be expressed on reddit etc because none of us know. You do not know Ochido personally and even if you did you are not him and do not know what he has or hasn't done in his private time, which is the same for people who say he has done it.   
---
Also if your issue is he was 18 when he did it, it doesn't matter if you are 18 or 80 once you are what the country defines as of legal age/adult you are a pedo if you then try to hit up someone under the legal age. Of course the age limits differ from country to country but most use 18 as the age you are classed as an adult. You may not agree and feel if they are close in age it is ok but in most countries that is not the view of the law and it wouldn't hold up as a defence in court.   
---
For example in the UK if an 18 year old man was being sexual with someone under 16 it would be classed as a crime and that man would be a peadophile. 
---
Exactly, let everyone do their own weird things y’know? We all get way into a game about being serial killers or hunted by them.... that in itself is a weird enough group, don’t even need to get into our other hobbies rofl.
---
Nah Fuck him, He doesn't deserve any positive attention.
---
Ytf are Claudettes either super immersed or toxic? Is there no middle ground for y'all? 😂
---
Thank you so much! I've always wanted to do it but seeing all the super talented cosplayers out there I felt silly trying but I'm so glad I did ^_^ tysm!
---
We all have our opinions ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Bit of advice from me to you. If you're replying to someone else's response, hit the *reply* button. Otherwise you'll just be posting a comment on OP like a quack, and noone will have the slightest clue what you're talking about. You've done it at least twice on this post alone. 
---
Also, you really need to work on your trash-talking game. This ain't it. 
---
Yep. Christopher Lee's the best. 
---
That makes the time I saw a hallucination standing on top of a brick wall pretty impressive.
---
This is literally me completely 100% we are the same person.
---
Spoiler alert.  He created this loadout with the intention of causing this uncounterable game breaking bug and uses it to kill multiple survivors.  He's cheating slime.
---
have you even seen laura lee's apology video
---
Head on when it works. Looping killer shack. Throw the god pallet. Hit m1 spam boi. Run to the locker as he breaks the pallet and recovers. He thinks to himself “i saw you, you stupid mfer, now parry this you filthy casual. “ then i slam open the doors stunning him and say “no you”. Joke loops aside its really funny when you know hes carrying someone to basement and u smack his ass crossing those lockers and he drops them
---
Here's a little bit of advice--you have to know both where he is and how he thinks, because odds are he knows every map just as well as you if not better. A god-Tier Trapper is always going to know where you want to run and plan accordingly. He's going to cut chases short preemptively and he's going to make surviving chases very difficult. 
---
In other words, the easiest way to counter him is to play as him. Memorize every map. Think about where the most favorable spots are for traps. Where he can easily conceal them. Disarm traps only if he isn't close, because that notification will have him bearing down on you within seconds. Stay attentive and watch your surroundings, Monitor chokepoints, Check vaults and pallets out of chase to ensure safe routings. Expect him to reset traps or for them to reset themselves. 
---
Awful job you don’t have boils on your skin and you didn’t cut off a toe.
---
Had a P3 Claudette spam me on the hook until death because I got the unhook on her friend before she could. :)
---
New killer music?
---
I always get out of Gideon.  What’s wrong w OP?
---
Iron Will.
---
It's a bit of a sleeper, but it's saved my ass so many times. If you break line of sight, you can just walk away and you're a ghost.
---
I really miss it when I don't run it. Works well paired with anything too.
---
had a game as Vommy Mommy, all survivors had OoO. they all stood on a hill and crouched towards the edge of it when I got near, and I started backing away and shaking my head. then they circled around me and nodded as I vomited on them. made me laugh :) 
---
This is kind of a shitty thing to say but if we have more folks abusing this combo we’d get BHVR to fix it a lot sooner.
---
I mean, it’s camping to a degree, but after constant t-bagging it’s totally fair. 
---
And when they’re stupid enough to see that and not do gens? It’s a surprise they accomplished anything really 
---
did they pop haunted?
---
Tactical dot
---
Yes lol
---
Ok  [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b7pqbh/legiondc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b7pqbh/legiondc/) 
---
I would say adrenaline but recently I've been in love with spinechill
---
I don’t know much about Ochido but from what I gather he’s garnered a large following through “toxic” behaviour, if he does turn a new leaf, I wonder how much of his fanbase that don’t want to change with him will he alienate, he seems to take his YouTube career seriously so as a content creator I’m sure he’s taken the potential ramifications of changing his content into consideration and in my opinion this should give his apology more legitimacy.
---
Well, once you hit P3, there is no need to say "I am going to reset, so buy the cheap stuff until I am not going to reset"
---
No worries. I love Autodidact because it’s the best payoff perk. In the current state of the game with how much slowing heal speed can be, Autodidact makes healing through Sloppy Butcher, Thanatopobia, Colourpuobia and even Freddy’s Dream State much more manageable. While some killers don’t try to take a longer game, meaning things like We’ll Make It or Botany do become more time efficient vs the rate the game would complete, when you do have those games and do have that time, you heal better than anything out there by comparison. 
---
Autodidact is great. It’s fair and rewarding and encourages safe unhooks and altruism. What I would love would be for the perk to include a slightly higher chance to get skill checks while healing others or a bonus where after 5 tokens you can apply it to yourself. 
---
he is the best I love his weapon
---
Wow what a loaded poll. 
---
Does it matter why do you care why does it matter to you kid please go back to you’re room at you’re moms house and continue watching you’re hentai kid I just don’t understand why a literal fuck boy waits more then 24 hours for a reply just to make a bad comeback you’re trash my dude go back on tinder

The only appropriate answer especially when you see that bloody freddy claw
---
Is slugging just hitting them?
---
saggy\*
---
I AM ABOUT TO HIT -KARMA LEVELS THAT SHOULDN'T EVEN BE POSSIBLE
---
Nea
---
Nice idea, but the first perk is literally just slippery meat. 
---
And the last perk is like if you combined the best parts of adrenaline and borrowed time, with no drawback. 
---
Killers just inherently earn more points than survivors.
---
Slugging is well turning the survivor into a slug on the ground. It's when you knock them to dying state on the ground but then go after someone else and leaving them there. It can continue to leaving the entire team on the ground like that so they can't do anything \[even more so if they don't have Unbreakable\]
---
I like this.   I wouldn’t likely use it but def see it as more viable for some folks than some of the others we have.  
---
Slugging is leaving them in the dying state, saves the killer time finding a hook. 
---
I look at it like camping, there’s a time and place where it’s a legitimate strategy, but if you’re doing it from the start of the match for no particular reason then it’s frustrating 
---
I'm all against camping , but I don't think you can camp your way to almost a perfect game. Something is off here.
---
That's a lot of hits, chases, and hooks for a camper
---
Oh dear. You're really not going to last long with this approach. Implying that I could somehow wait twenty-four hours to respond to a comment that was posted 30 minutes ago. It's like every comment, you make, you're trying desperately hard to lower the bar- but I'm not a fan of limbo so I'll opt out now.
---
And also you're welcome. If I hadn't told you how to *reply,* you'd just be leaving endless comments of directionless rage on the post. How kind!
---
I usually have the opposite experience. It's probably the map I've gotten out of the least amount of times
---
Is this Feng Min
---
Nope a spirit 
---
Yesterday I was running from the Huntress and crouched just in time to avoid a hatchet to the back of my head. With less than 100 hours in the game so far I felt like a badass before I got hooked 15 seconds later
---
You posted this already.
---
Should've done this for Bill, lmao.
---
lets be friends
---
Oh thats actually 900iq :D ty for the answer
---
Wow really nice save :&gt; Ty for the answer
---
I haven't been playing the game for too long, only a few months so maybe that's why I find it so difficult. I usually have a harder time escaping from the killer in Gideon than I do in other maps. 
---
And thank you so much for the advice! I appreciate it, will try that more next time I'm in that map
---
Urban Evasion

But what about that toe...

You must have some type of mental condition. I just don’t understand how you literally are just a piece of shit for bullying people

I mustve been doing something wrong cuz I bought all the expensive stuff at P0 before I decided to start prestiging, at which point I only went for the cheapest stuff so I could prestige faster. 
---
This is just like in that anime I was watching today? 
---
Only reason I said it only seems to be survivors is because I’ve been having to play killer for a while now because survivor is so broken for me and I haven’t ran into one yet nor have I seen anyone posting about killer bugs so it’s definitely not near as bad. But I do stand corrected, there are some that people are bringing to my attention now. 
---
IKR they aren’t even addressing any of these bugs at the moment and they’ve been happening for almost a month now if not more...
---
You bet!  Best of luck, and hopefully we'll run into each other on a map someday.  :)
---
&gt;when it works
---
exactly... *when it works*. Mine has been failing too much. Right now it's working about 1/4 the times it should.
---
Yup, I do love a good stealth build. 
---
It's a very nice head canon and I can appreciate it, but the Michael Myers of Dead by Daylight and the Michael Myers of Halloweens 1, 2, and 2018 are virtually unkillable supernatural manifestations of evil.
---
I've never watched Rob Zombie's Halloween films so I can't say anything about them or their take on the character, but if Michael was just some poor confused kid in a man's body how can he survive being stabbed in neck, stabbed in the head, stabbed in the heart, [shot six times off a balcony](https://youtu.be/S-M_bLGrIMg?t=207), beaten in the head with a crowbar, shot in the chest with a revolver, [shot in the face with a hunting rifle at close range with a loud audible snapping noise coming from his head and neck area](https://youtu.be/LzacAlUzs8Q?t=58), stabbed in the chest with a kitchen knife, [shot repeatedly until he stops his infamous breathing](https://youtu.be/e5Gr4hloq84?t=284), and shot again twice in the head?
---
That's not to mention his repeated feats of inhuman strength as well as how he knew how to drive despite having spent fifteen years alone in a room, how he was able to find his younger sister (if you're following the Halloween 1-2 timeline) despite her identity being hidden and him having last seen her more than fifteen years ago, how he knew where to find his older sister's tombstone, how he was able to transport it across the town, the effect agitating him at the insane asylum had on all the other inmates and the dogs, how he was able to track down his mask despite no evidence telling him where the people who had it were or even if they still had it, and him apparently escaping the burning room at the end of Halloween 2018.
---
In John Carpenter's own words Michael Myers is "*almost a supernatural force - a force of nature.* ***An evil force*** *that's loose*"
---
Perfect. 
---
Sadly yeah, it’s human nature to complain, people will find anything to complain about. I’m 10000% sure you complain about dumbshit too. Just not the same dumbshit as everyone else. Lmao and yeah there will always be little bitches in this world. Complaining about them isn’t going to settle anything (:
---
&gt;In morality, you are correct.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;In the eyes of the law, you are wrong.
---
&gt;In the end, whatever happens, happens.
---
Why isn't he charged with a crime then
---
I can definitely see them not being used too often, but being able to take out 1 of the possible 12 realms can be helpful.
---
The dev says about twenty seconds in that Ash does say groovy
---
jen with the rank 20 killers ayayayayya xdxd rawr omegalul 4head
---
We have a child molester, isn't that morally terrible enough. #StillMadTheyChoseTheRemakeFreddy
---
It's a crutch perk so it does reward bad killers just like DS rewarded bad survivors 
---
Yeah, that’s my point. The Legion I feel bad for because they are my age. Just kids. 
---
The Spirit was killed by her father, The Hag being eaten alive, etc, etc. 
---
I like the idea of anyone being a killer, like the Plague who did nothing wrong, but at the same time, I want to know how she can just go from saving everyone she can, even to the point of self-mutilation, and now she is slapping me to death with a sensor (scensor? Idk how to spell that lmao) 
---
Give me more terrible people!!!! Or show me how it happens! 
---
You probably need some luck Offerings xD
---
Yeah u right. Freddy and the Clown make my shit list 
---
In all fairness, NOED can be hardcountered without the use of any perks.
---
I think the devs need to bite the bullet and give everyone a totem counter next to gens. If it's a secondary objective, and NOED enforces that, let's treat it as such.
---
NOED ruins the illusion.
---
Getting downed is not being bad it is almost required at least once a game and even the best survivors get downed, honestly if DS wasn't nerfed and NOED wasn't touched I'd be 100% ok with it
---
I got a little cosplay contest invite card for DbD and I'm so excited!
---
I don't use DS but I love the change to it it's really helped my new friends learn the game when a David with WGLF decided he wants to unhook you in front of the killer or when a Claudette decides to blitzkrieg for the hook immediately
---
For me this depends who the killer is. Nurse/Billy seems to have the biggest issue in corn, because they usually prefer using their abilty instead of walking. 
---
DS got reworked, so people want NOED to eat a 4th nerf. It's just how this subreddit is.
---
Im not really trying to help your post but you keep popping up in my inbox and tbh I’m just enjoying the social interaction now 
---
I started playing this game again the other day after an impromptu hiatus from it, and one of my first matches as killer was in this map. The very last dude was so good at juking in the corn that I thought I was never gonna get him. I only managed to get him because he stepped in a trap I set in the corn at the beginning of the match.
---
He was super chill about it though and actually sent me a message over PlayStation to compliment my trap placing skills!
---
Especially since camping or even patrolling punishes you heavy now.
---
Then why the fuck are you here
---
A sequel is required. 
---
That sucks 
---
Sure you can easily get out of the dream state, but you alert the killer right away. I don’t think it’s unfair that survivors can wake themselves up because there is a counter. The fact you alert Freddy when you fail a skill check makes you an immediate target. I think it’s all dependant on who controls Freddy. I hate Freddy, I find him impossible to play against. He can drag you into the dream world and walk away. He can keep you in the dream world with only one safe way to get out. If your not in a group I find it impossible and I’m never in a group, I play solo or with one other person, I always hate when it’s Freddy cause I rarely survive. I find him too powerful, but to each their own I guess.
---
Oh, um by the way, we sort of disagreed on the whole Hitman thing. But I think we can both agree that this guy has completely lost the plot.
---
If you read the Plague's addons, there are some hints they did terrible rituals and based on her clothes, she also unknowingly hasten the spread of the disease by participating in religious rituals. Then again, she was a devout person in a shitty time
---
Kids 
---
Yeah, that's the same reason I bring self care and deliverance whenever I solo. I never trust other players to  unhook me or heal me when we aren't friends. And also players who expect you to unhook them when killer is camping or gates are open. 
---
They easily could of made deadite skins for the survivors
---
Wait is this on controller? 
---
All you need to do is make it so the Killer can't stand on the stairs for longer than one minute every two minutes, without breaking their ankles, tumbling down the steps, and ending up on a hook themselves.
---
EzPz.
---
I want to inspire to be you. Cant play legion for shit but I own Joey so I might just start if I can master him enough.
---
I keep getting disconnected. It's super annoying.
---
Wow he’s deaf. 
---
You're right dude. But being downvoted by the killer hivemind who assume you are saying it is ok to teabag at the gates. If the survivors haven't left and you refuse to go to the gates then you're not doing your job as a killer. They seem to be peddling this idea that the game is unfinishable for a killer... and it is the survivors responsibility. If they want to fuck around, punish them for it. Don't hide because you don't want your feelings hurt then find a reason to report them out of spite...
---
Someone disappears before your eyes irl
---
"*Just like the simulations*"
---
Though I agree, they have been hurting survivors as of late with updates. Sadly not much they can do about blocking the basement besides making the steps wider, but that would require redoing all the maps in the game which is unrealistic. That isn’t an issue with the developer, it’s an issue with the player themselves.
---
AFAIK theres little to no difference.
---
Only prestige if you want the bloody cosmetics and/or the prestige "badge"
---
yea i'm at rank 1 and it's pretty polar. either they're nice people that play to win, or ducks lol
---
They're taking a long time to show much but the game isn't cancelled, is still making money (despite our opinions on the game and it's money making schemes) and is playable. That, at least in my opinion, isn't a flop.
---
There now its balanced you got one upvote I was gonna upvote but balance so now its zero
---
She usually just sits in front of the tv, right in front of my character for survivor too lol, but maybe I'll put some of that up sometime.
---
Jesus man. Chill.

I know I'm gonna look dumb for this but what's the meaning of 4head? I laugh every time I see it but what's it stand for

You haven't played DBD unless Maurice the horse has startled you at least once.

It is just stubbornness. It amazes me people have 20 mins to waste like this. You are right don't worry, just in the wrong thread ha
---
Does she paw at your character, or just watch?
---
This right here is why Overwatch is beginning to die out
---
I’m cool with it
---
Usually just watches, but sometimes when there's a lot of movement she'll paw at it.
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Motherfucking SPACE!!!!
---
I would've rather had that happen than him body blocking me
---
I'm sure they say that with love of course 
---
"""""anime"""""...
---
*are you sure about that?*
---
Apparently it means.
---
Can't wait to start using the new perk that allows you to extend a chase before being hooked for a second time. 
---
So was that audio clip of him telling a girl he’s going to rape her not him? Genuine question because that’s seriously is fucked no matter the age.
---
I can imagine Bill jumping a Hillbilly.
---
When all of them feed his tombstone tier 3 and he tiers up on you because your the obsession.
---
3 people don’t dc against a freddy in the first 10 seconds of the match
---
Okay, that's pretty funny though.
---
 I guess I don't mind a little group sandbagging, as long as it's not all match / at the cost of the game for the solo players.
---
Claudette 
---
&gt;It's fun because Legion is a very active killer who makes for some hectic chases.
---
No mindgames necessary in chase, no punishment for missing attacks, you move faster, you vault over windows and pallets (aka essentially ignoring whatever a survivor does). In what way is Legion’s power “active” or makes the chase “hectic”? Its the most boring chase ever for both sides.
---
Your comment about the nurse basically means that you want to play a killer that ignores survivor counterplay but doesnt take skill like Nurse does, so you play Legion instead. 
---
What perks that?
---
Which one of yas doesn’t know how to break line of sight?!
---
Self care, selfish care. Takes longer to heal your self. It’s honestly a smart move. Also helps you with points and your pips.  
---
Can’t say what happened n your game but hey, to each your own. 
---
I rescued my teammate with borrowed time and trapper just waited there until borrowed time was over.
---
Yeah I was hoping for that to be next on the thread but I guess I have to resort to the lowest of the low... 
---
#DOOOOOD WHA HAPPENED
---
It’s because of that damn cursor dot, right?
---
its me :)
---
When they reach tier 2, i try and let them suck off me as much as possible- that way past the midpoint in the match he can't insta pop me with a t3 cause my juice is all gone
---
Tunneling trash.

I wonder if Ash was going to be announced on the 1st making people think it wasn’t real and an April Fools joke only to shock people the next day. But then sadly the leak happened and now lost joke potential.

Explain why this is tunneling? The clip is 30 seconds 😂. How can you gather enough information to say that i am tunneling? Grow up 😂
---
Myers 👍
---
The problem is that both Survivor and Killer have Perks that are essentially “crutch” perks that become so Meta that most people will run them because why not?
---
So you’ll have Killers being jerks and facecamping to avoid the annoyance, and Survivors teabagging/being toxic because they have so many time extending/free whiff Perks.
---
I really hate how hostile and aggressive Survivor and Killer are. Like, Dead By Daylight is the first place I’ve seen people LITERALLY bully the opposite side, which is stupid beyond belief because you’re just scaring away your own playerbase.
---
Sadly no
---
Monitor and abuse
---
Slow down the pain, just a little bit.
---
im trying to get better at billy in preperation for mettle of man. Previously a boosted spirit main and that perk just shits on her. 
---
I mean, I'm not staying when 2 people dc and the killer is still playing seriously or if its a face camping Leather face when no gens are done yet because that's a fucking snowstorm, but usually otherwise ill stay, if i see something i don't like, I take it more as a challenge then a reason to quit.
---
Yeah I bet lol
---
Her name's Kira
---
Dwight?
---
I actually think it's the bird at the beginning, but she likes the stupid cursor too lol
---
Report them, then block. Turn off messages is an option too.
---
Good shit.
---
It's funny long as they're doing it for the luls. If they're doing it because you won't heal them or  to kill you off they're just rude
---
lmao survivor cosplays look like your average person just going to pax, nothing special about them.
---
but you do resemble feng min I suppose, so good job on that
---
Wow, you're just as stupid as the other guy.
---
Whatever floats your boat I guess, maybe its not psychoanalytical, maybe all of you just think the same way? 
---
I guess you didn't think about that since you're so determined to be something other than a carbon copy of every other person who says the same dumb ass shit. 
---
I mean we all dc’d at the same time, but I do feel bad for the Dwight I think he was in a team with the other 2 tho
---
if he was camping then how did he get 4 kills? 
---
a camping killer will only get a single kill if the 3 non camped characters immediately do gens because they will power all the gens in the time it takes the unfortunate camping victim to die. 
---
so if the killer camped and you still lose it sounds like a problem with the survivors 
---
like how when i get camped all 3 other survivors will hide 5 feet away from me waiting for a chance to save me that will never come making it a sure thing that they arent going to win the game
---
Ur nat mah mum
---
Yeah of course, i'm not a douchebag.
---
&gt;You jest
---
You, I like you. What a unique phrase
---
Just hide in lockers, so she has to pick one, the others can get out. Same goes for Bubba
---
Yeah, but the thing is — if you can’t catch that one survivor, maybe it’s time to chase someone else? Because there’s always that one weak link in the group. This way you’ll shake their rhythm and become altruistic instead of doing gen. You’ll eventually catch them. 
---
DS got multiple nerfs as well, yes NOED has been nerfed before but that doesn’t mean the perk isn’t still op, that’s an odd way of thinking honestly as by that logic DS didn’t need the nerf it recently got as its been nerfed before.
---
I don’t even bother putting traps around my totem, waste of time, now that grass next it I will and I normally always get them ;-)
---
Not to mention this helps in putting solo and SWF on the same pedestal which imo is important.
---
Yeah, alot of people just complain about legion to complain, and even some YouTubers and Streamers influence the hate towards the killer, while there are problems, its isn't as bad as people make it out to be.
---
No, PC. When you play it you can press the down button and the camera angle switches to your face so you can see behind you when you run. I usually do this when running in the corn so I can stay away from the killer 
---
Balanced Landing
---
All I wanna know is how is bubba gonna ask for help
---
It’s still annoying, especially for the Killer.
---
I don’t play Legion anymore just because it’s a waste of Add-Ons and Offerings. I don’t like bringing in Green/Purple Add-Ons and a Survivor Pudding only to hit somebody once and have 2-3 people DC once they realize who the Killer is.
---
It’s also annoying for any Killer who takes a Mori. In the past week I’ve probably only been able to Mori 1-2 people per game because the other ones will quit or DC before I start the animation.
---
Survivors have too much power over being able to DC whenever with little consequence. It sucks.
---
is it the same for you?
---
This is so good and so true! Prestiging Jane &amp; Nea. Just got Nea to P3 and Jane is P1... buying all brown offerings and avoiding useless/hyper-situational perks like No One Left Behind and Left Behind and This Is Not Happening.
---
Matter of fact, it's like the Bloodweb forces you to take those worthless perks cuz they'll be the only perk 3-4 times in a row!
---
What’s the fourth perk? 
---
My wife gets scared by survivors constantly when playing the killer. Always gives me a chuckle.
---
You and the others have convinced me. :D
---
The next installment will come. :)
---
I ain't risking a ban
---
**no.**
---
Screech until someone notices him, I guess?
---
I mean we get ito n the 2nd of April. So either they hacked all online and reallife calanders for the best prank ever! or we acctualy get him.
---
It’s not a fair comparison because there’s four times the survivors that there is killers but taking this away id say it’s probably still survivors but not by a ton.
---
Usually smth like iron will
---
In the corn you have to run at really wide circles email they follow your tracks without actually finding
---
This is the most accurate depiction of the DBD community.
---
I don’t think Behaviour would waste all the money for licensing and getting the REAL Ash to appear in a video for them as a joke.
---
That would be one EXPENSIVE prank.
---
Not a bad build, send yourself to lerys and boom.
---
Amanda be like: I want to play a game, the game is to get the bag out of the machine within 60seconds.
---
Exactly *taps forhead* 
---
You know, I've never gotten to play a full, regular game against Legion. Everyone always D/Cs. I wish I could play against a Legion. :(
---
I've gotten killed by him, but that's about it. All of my encounters have been less than a few minutes because everyone leaves. 
---
The devs cannot nerf unbreakable, because it is unbreakable.
---
The problem is that she doesn’t have to pick one, puke on the lockers putting everyone in injured and she’s guaranteed to hook 1 person without agitation. If there’s 3-4 people down there she’s getting at least 2-3 hooks and with agitation she gets everyone down there.
---
i sold all my steam cards and was able to buy LF with the money :)
---
(i dont facecamp or act toxic so it’s not at the expense of others ;) )
---
Why do people DC against legion the devs arent gonna remove the guy.
---
"BIRD."
---
I think things might get worse before they get better. Hopefully dedicated servers come asap
---
Awww I’m so bummed I didn’t run into you!! I was dressed as Susie at PAX on Saturday 😔👊🏻
---
Dammit I just got done laughing at the other one
---
In the eyes of the law he is not a pedophile as she was 17 and not pre-pubescent. What he did can be considered immoral and I don’t think anyone would deny that but he can not be classified as a pedophile by the very definition.
---
Why not go for ruin?
---
damn you couldnt be more condescending and obnoxious than this. its eerily similar to the caricature of annoying redditor
---
A pedophile is someone sexually attracted to a pre-pubescent child, if she was 17 this is not the case meaning no, he is not a pedophile. 
---
This game was TERRIFYING. That feeling of the two guards slowly closing in on you with only 3 more marbles to pick up. 
---
I've never felt so ashamed of humanity
---
Me when i play legion mixtape :)
---
Exactly. Or maybe even if the killer is just nearby. You just feel nervous and scared that he'll find you. And when he does.. it gets intense
---
In the states, she is considered a “child” and he can get arrested for pedophilia.
---
By definition he is not, can’t just throw allegations like that around.
---
Reported...yeah totally...nice job OP!!!
---
N OMEGALUL
---
It's like I used to tell my wife. "I do not apologize unless I think I am wrong. And if you don't like it, you can leave." And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one, too. 
---
Being considered a child is irrelevant as she is not pre-pubescent. It’s still immoral of him to ask a fan of his for nudes but he’s not a pedophile by definition.
---
I hate when people downplay it like this. If it wasn't effective then you wouldn't see 95%+ of killers taking it in red ranks.
---
Also no it's not OP, just strong. How strong it is depends on A) How long it stands, B) How good the survivors are at skillchecks, C) How many skillchecks they actually get and D) How long they spend off gens looking for the totem.
---
My only issue with it is that it gets old seeing it every game.
---
I agree
---
Noed=hatch not ds
---
Look I don’t bad for someone that moonwalks to end chases
---
Pedophile: A person who is sexually attracted to young children. 
---
So, yes, I can throw that allegation around, it's true. I don't give a damn if his rabid fanbase will say he's not. He is a serial harasser of young women. 
---
oh sweet summer child...
---
Yeah the music would help. They should add a new track and some ambient noises or maybe they could add a spooky map with jumpscares 
---
They're scary! Haha. That's so funny though, I'm glad I'm not the only one.
---
Because survivors can’t have fun against him, and the whole point of playing videogames is to have fun
---
i just had a dbd match, i was playing survivor. i loaded in and we had two dcs, it was just me and another guy. he got hooked so i went to save him but of course the trapper was right there, i went to run back but the guy made motions for me to save hooked guy, so i did. trapper let us heal eachother and kept putting me on hook and letting other survivor take me off and heal, it was pretty sweet.
---
the whole match was us doing gens, we letting him destroy them, me walking into a few of his traps and him letting us pallet stun him.
---
we both escape and said our ggs at end game, i just love matches like this, makes me happy ^^
---
maybe stop camping?
---
More like borrowed skill am I right haha yes
---
Yeah, it seems like all of the survivors rank 10+ (I haven't been past 10) are all getting dumber and dumber. Kinda makes it hard to play solo.
---
Plague or Legion
---
Totems aren't another objective. I don't get this killer main attitude where totems HAVE to be destroyed because its the survivors objective.
---
NOED is the only perk that requires you to destroy them all, if not then the killer gets a 4+ speed boost and unlimited instadowns. It takes no skill to wreck a team like that, especially when survivors are at their weakest late game.
---
Killers camp so survivors rush gens, then Campy McCamp falls back on his NOED crutch. That needs to change.
---
that’s ..not that many upvotes..
---
The topic was whether or not he was a pedophile and I gave you a definition from a well trusted and made website saying that he is not a pedophile. What he did was wrong and I disagree with it entirely but people need to stop making the claim that he is a pedophile when he isn’t. 
---
I’m sorry that your feathers got ruffled when you found out you were wrong, I didn’t mean to upset you. 
---
I never realized how gross his teeth were. D:
---
Then play Kyf if you dont want to deal with legion. Stop being child and play the game.
---
I'm not a killer main, I think that this game is unfortunately way to killer sided it's just stupid how survivors complain about a perk that can be completely nullified 
---
Hahahahaha he called you Pay to Win Lmaoo. I miss playing DbD on PS4 just for the salty messages haha
---
I'm not wrong. As I said, the definition you linked still agrees with me, as I explained in my previous comment, which you oh-so-conveniently ignored. 
---
JuSt pLaY kYf 
---
Some people use;
---
M&amp;A, Sloppy, Nurses &amp; Ruin for Michael.
---
M&amp;A allows michael to practically have an non-existant terror radius. Very good for stealth.
---
Sloppy slows down survivors healing. Combos with nurses to make it easier to find survivors.
---
Nurses calling is good for finding survivors healing from sloppy. Works amazingly well with Michaels reduced terror radius with M&amp;A.
---
Ruin to slow the game down at the beginning to help you get tier 2. 
---
You could also use discordance to kick start a match by allowing you to find a group of survivors to stalk. Can also be used to later in the match with deerstalker to pop tier 3 &amp; down 2 survivors at once.
---
Any anti-pallet builds works good with him. Both enduring &amp; brutal strength.
---
Infectious Freight would work amazingly well with deerstalker. Will highlight anyone close to you to start the next chase. This combos with M&amp;A where the extra 8 m to your terror radius during a chase can highlight extra people. If you bring knockout then you can devastate the survivors one by one.
---
Alright. You got the legion who is trash unless your cheap and moonwalk and the plague just came out who I think seems fairly balenced. The ranking system just took a huge hit and is a bit ridiculous. Also 2 new survivors who are whatever
---
I can get you a close up of those pearly whites for ya. ;D
---
I mean, I didn't think desicive strike was op but everyone whined about that. Oh no, you got stunned for 3 seconds (without enduring). Oh noooooo....
---
Yeah. Usually was pretty easy to deal with or to catch them again. But of course killer mains cried about it. Lol same with self care and sprint burst. 
---
Ok but does it ever go away? If it doesn't that's kinda op. I like the idea tho.
---
True, just looked up the wiki
---
The definition I send you clearly says, “pre-pubescent child,” did you just ignore that piece? 
---
Ok...i see youre one of those survivors. 
---
No sympathy for moonwalking Legions.
---
I'm a firm believer that a totem counter is a good idea but only in a perk like small game
---
The dbd booth was poppin the whole weekend!
---
he just hates on literally everything DBD.
---
If BT is a problem, then don't camp
---
Just run, circle back, crouch walk in another direction for a few seconds, and run again.
---
Devour hope and tombstone time?
---
Confirmed:
---
!Jacksonville Outfit, S-Mart Uniform, Ash vs. Evil Dead, Nintendo Powerglove hand, Ashy Slashy hand.!
---
Jokes on you, I decked out myers at p0 with no intent of prestiging.
---
Not OP but it gets really annoying seeing it every single game after rank 15. 
---
Eventually you learn to just work through it but still it is boring af to see everygame
---
I only agree that the oink needs to be map wide. 
---
But, really, it would be less healthy for the game overall to stop content. Content keeps people coming back, and that's important. They do fix things, it's just a slow process because there's a lot of things they have to fix, and try not to break anything in fixing these things. 
---
Different teams work on different things, and it's unfortunate that we have so many bugs, but we just have to wait them out. This can be said for a lot of online games, unfortunately. 
---
Aww what a cutie! I wish my cats did this but they never react to anything on the tv.
---
A nintendo power glove exclusive cosmetic would be amazing.
---
Well, you can at least see that she's about to get your butt if you get saved. Which is unfortunate. :( 
---
That’s odd. I never wait more than a minute or two on PS4. I played from last night to this morning with no issue. 
---
The Nea, lmao
---
People have also speculated that there's Evil Dead 2 Ash, Rosewood Hand, and the gauntlet from Army of Darkness, but the screenshots are pretty grainy.
---
Isn't this a good thing?  Now as killer, you don't have to pip to get ridiculous wait times and you'll always face noobs.
---
Win win lmao
---
Source?? I'm pumped!

Always Nea.
---
So dominant they are repairing hooks
---
I dont even mind the babies doing it, its the p3 killers with OP addons doing it that annoy me after they still cant get you all game without NOED
---
I hate Hillbilly, i don't have spirit and i don't have much interest in her.
---
Any more brilliant ideas by Legion haters? There's literally nothing wrong with enjoying playing Legion. Stop salting in my direction for no reason.
---
Will do chief
---
Considering you posted this within the same hour as it was commented, I wouldn't have expected the comment to get much recognition by then. It's currently the top comment
---
Hex: I don't want hit points, just go:
---
 When survivors stand in the exit gate area for 30/20/10 seconds they automatically leave. 
---
"I get it you fucking win!" -/u doggodoesasad
---
Oh my bad im a dumbass lol
---
Just various screenshots people from PAX East posted. We'll see it in two days, or I'd look it up.
---
People don't have fun playing against a legion. Idk why that's salty. Salt would be verbal abuse post match. 
---
Sounds to me like you're just kinda sensitive. 
---
I don't mean to offend you but that sounds very useless. It grows back after 10 seconds anyway so why use a perk slot for it?
---
Awesome!
---
I've only done it for the achievements. Can't say if the bloodweb improvements are worth it
---
&gt; Lol you got roasted
---
How so? 
---
Good to know kid...
---
As a piggy main, I will start running Enduring and Spirit fury just so every pallet can be smashed upon my cute piggy head so that everyone could hear it all the time. 
---
Unless the randos you're paired with are terrible. I ran a mirror Myers around Macmillan for 4 generators the other day. Got knocked down because of my own stupidity. He proximity camped...but my team was still too afraid of a level one Myers to rescue me. I died on hook one and the rest of them dropped without getting the exit gates open.....
---
I guess it's my fault for getting caught. 😩
---
Yeah well fair enough lol
---
It’s pretty self-evident if you read all your replies and look at all your downvotes, friend 
---
Goddamn Wraith, when are they finally going to fix him?
---
How did you not get hated on?
---
OOF, I've been experiencing that, too. 
---
oh
---
&gt; This sub has shitposts and meme threads, and this is the one you gripe over? Oy.
---
&gt; 
---
I can't comment on every single one of them, can I? Even still, I make my annoyance known in those types of posts as well so I don't know what you are on about.
---
Also, even shitposts and meme threads have potential to spark a discussion about the subject of the post. On the other hand, Instagram photos that don't even have a cosplay to make up for it have no use at all. 
---
Survivors deny say anything. No one does
---
The pallet spawns are random and too rng, death trap bathroom gen, hard to find ruin, poorly spread gens.
---
Yeah. I have everything private bc the salt messages became too much for me to handle. 
---
Thanks for commenting this before the silent majority swoops in to kick my comments down. Hopefully BHVR can find a solid way to make everyone happy, but I'm not gonna hold my breath on that one.
---
Nope he was already downed when the hatch spawned
---
Ruin isn't OP it just causes me to lose my sanity as I do 4 gens by meself because my team can't figure out that the hag is camping her totem.
---
Cool story bro.

What is there to test?  It's a known exploit that has already been established what it does and how it's performed.  There is nothing to test.  It was just an excuse to cheat by manufacturing an unwinnable game for the opponent.  Exploits exist due to severe game breaking updating bugs from time to time.  It's the players responsibility to choose but to take advantage of them.
---
10 
---
100% increased healing speed for 30/60/90 seconds after unhooking others, but it count with self heals.
---
If your comment was a joke I'm just going to r/whoosh myself before anybody else can.
---
I've been defending my ruin, it's been helping a bit against some teams
---
Trying
---
How many hours do you have?
---
Technically there's an increased chance of good add-ons and stuff spawning as you prestige but I don't think it's a huge buff. If you have a build you really enjoy right now and don't care about the cosmetics I'd say there's really no reason to unless you want to just because.
---
I got Dwight P3 and don’t really see a difference between his webs and non-prestige ones. 
---
Thought so faggot
---
Honestly Head On and Dance With Me is such a great combination.  Imo it’s better than Dance With Me + Lithe if it actually works
---
Maybe it's a viable strategy, but there is no counter to it and is not fun to play against. Facecamping is a strategy, but at the expense of 1-2 player's fun (of course you are not obligated to make fun for others) and I can't imagine standing in front of a hook staring at the survivor is fun for the killer either. Ebonies are part of the game, but is it fun to get tunneled and moried of your 1st hook? Definitely not in my opinion. 
---
I never DC against legion or aformentioned circumstances, but when you get a day, where majority of games look like this, you just need to vent. DCing just because you don't like a game mechanic isn't justifiable and you are hurting your teammates more than the killer but some games really are unfun and not everyone is willing to stay in those games.
---
Side note: I don't understand why are you so butthurt about getting 1 downvote. Besides, you are just assuming that the og. commenter was the one who downvoted you not talking in mind, that some other people could disagree with you. 
---
One of the devs confirmed on stream that Ash does indeed say groovy.
---
oh that perk that no one wants to use
---
BIG WORDS FROM SOMEONE WITH A FREDDY FLAIR
---
^^not ^^disagreeing ^^tho
---
Damn I'm so upset over that word. Really showed me.
---
Happens to me a lot. Most recently one did this to me in the basement, waited until the killer had come to check on me. -and by that, I mean I was hooked at 3 gens, and still on the hook at 1 gen. They just sat there, waiting until I was nearly dead to unhook me while the killer was there. 
---
The killer got me, obviously, and hooked me. I spectated and the killer NoED'd everyone BUT that Claudette, who was sitting on the Hatch. The two other survivors were at the same exit gate. :( One tried to body block the person opening it, and it just went so bad. 
---
The killer left before anything could be said after that game, but man, it really is always Claudettes that do that.
---
a major douche lmao
---
r/wowthanksimcured /s
---
Honestly, someone like Wraith would have no chance against Ash with his boomstick and chainsaw
---
They're usually wearing brown shirt, or bloody shirt.

What new killer music?

for me, the only worst thing about that map are the totems' locations, otherwise is one of my favorites
---
xxdddd baby ki11er ezezezez 
---
Seriously though, juking someone who probably has 7 hours in the game because you derank is hardly an accomplishment and much less something worth sharing.
---
You know what's going too far? Having a 4 man with the exact same name and skin. 
---
Nea is a bodybuilder now and looks better than in game as always.
---
Very cute. 
---
But that would mean hillbilly never gets to see claudette
---
Ahah, I am always teased because I think she is cute, while everyone else says she looks like a dude: I'm getting used to it, at this rate! XD
---
Thanks for your appreciation! :) 
---
Off that pose is uncomfortable for Meg, but as long as he just wants her hair.
---
The shared health among teammates in Animal Crossing was a more devastating debuff than NOED
---
Yeah, I thought about that. I intended for Rookie's luck to synergize with slippery meat. The last perk could probably expose the rescuer, as suggested by somebody else here.
---
Make it so when the obsession is killed your terror radius is decreased by 100%, I like the idea, good job.
---
Puke on gens after smacking them, break survivors instead of just hitting them in a chase, puke on ruin, and run her gen blocking perk.
---
If you notice a lot of tool boxes I suggest using overwhelming presence.
---
Thanataphobia is way worse than it sounds because it only really adds a few seconds to gens.
---
This is all I got. I haven't played Plague yet because F my bank account, but these are some things that I have seen Plagues do to alow the game down JUST A LITTLE BIT.

Why not? How is rewarding a killer for killing multiple survivors worse than punishing all survivors (and slowing the game to a crawl) because the killer tunneled one person?
---
Calm down it was memes
---
Have a tantrum? 
---
I would like a huge indoor museum map, that or a castle. 
---
Museum map would come with a mummy killer, and the castle would come with a werewolf killer. 
---
I specifically mean the killers, legion needs no explanation and plague is kinda just unfun to go against, it feels to me like they’ve begun to run out of ideas and well, it shows. 
---
I only have 1 P3 survivor and that's Bill, because I like him and wanted him to have a new outfit. 
---
Yea and ruins mostly broken within the first 5 seconds, here’s the deal I main nurse over 1000 hours even with immense gen pressure by having one survivor hooked, one on the ground and another one injured, all while running perks like pop goes the weasel ruin thanaphobia and bbq I still have 2 gens pop, the survivor gets saved the downed survivor is picked up cycle repeats, while changing my playstyle to confuse them they get out on there last hook one of them dies, well I’m uninstalling,
---
Does she like hands? Does she want to live a peaceful and quiet life?
---
Shoot I don't know then, maybe run an endgame perk like bloodwarden or the ever infamous NOED, so you have a chance of scoring kills after they rush the gens.
---
I don't think it's a bad idea, but there are a couple of things to consider.
---
One, this would be pretty useless against Predator, as this perk turns scratch marks from something that allows for fairly loose tracking into a reliable trail to follow. A few proposals have been put forward for this perk to outright brighten scratch marks, thereby rubbing more salt into the wound. 
---
Second, the name. Eclipse Bouquet has already been used for an offering that is sadly no longer with us. Let it Rest In Peace. 
---
You used dead hard and jumped into the hatch, what a skillful play. Why does this have almost 200 upvotes
---
“Life is unfair sometimes... sometimes you must sacrifice your time for a little reward. This time, you will be sacrificing your flesh for a small pay off- your life. 
---
Your arm is hooked inside a vending machine, and inside you will see a dangling Cosmic Brownie- and several scalpels. To secure your small pay off- your life- you must sacrifice flesh to obtain the treat. But time is of the essence- in one minute the vending machine latch with snap shut, leaving you with nothing to show for your effort.
---
  No pain no gain, right? Make your choice.”
---
A few people have said to not run coulorphobia with nurses, is it because they won't be healing since they are in your terror radius? 
---
I don't have dying light but I'll definitely give thanaphopia a try. I just wanted to try a different build out and thought anti healing could be fun
---
Ruin + Spirit fury + enduring + noed is 80% of my games
---
Oh my bad I thought it was just a random screenshot you took of a message and posted here.
---
To be fair, the magnets was in a song about appreciating the amazing shit the world has.
---
That said I don't think I've ever met a juggalo that hasn't been a fucking idiot (other than the actual ICP, they seem alright).
---
This is how my games go too. That, or I'm the last one alive and my team mates feed themselves to the killer while I'm the only one on Gens, and somehow the killer hasn't had the TIME to come look for me. 
---
Or, of course, everyone D/Cs. 
---
Nintendo land is unreal
---
Im a newfag, whats NOED?
---
His channel will die soon hopefully. 
---
Oh, right.
---
Good one.
---
First, because your *reward* is insanely powerful. Obsessions and Hex perks are strong because they have drawbacks. Hexes can be destroyed, and obsession perks give the obsession some kind of advantage. For instance:  
---
\- Dying light gives the obsession bonuses.  
---
\- Rancor lets the obsession see the killer when gens are lit up.  
---
\- Giving your obsession immunity to the perk.  
---
\- Letting the obsession get away is in your favor for PWYF.  
---
But you're saying to give a killer a MASSIVE reward with absolutely no weak point or obsession bonus.  
---
100% TR reduction with no drawback. No thanks.
---
Thank you!
---
If you got tunneled and camped 11 matched in a row, maybe you should re-evaluate what you're doing that gets you found so early that you become the object of obsession (so to speak) for tunneling and camping.....
---
Looks like his trap would just break if he stepped in it
---
I think how bright the maps are lends a lot to this. You can easily get visibility on the killer, that, and with certain perks, you know the killer is going to have to chase you a long time to get you. 
---
I feel like there should be more objectives, more random events that can harm your gameplay, or the killer's. [ Example: A floor crumbling through mid chase, one of you may make it, the other may not, and fall to the next floor. Or, the entity's spider arm comes out of a crack in the wall and blocks/swipes at whatever is there. ]
---
I’m pretty sure she says something along the lines of “Damn!” when she’s hit, or so I’ve heard, I haven’t played her enough myself to hear it but I know quite a few people who have told me she does 
---
This would be the proper way to do it. They really messed this up lol
---
This video makes me uncomfortable and has nothing to do with our sweet piggy.
---
Yea it kind of seems like a no brainer to me lol
---
are you... /s? or? 
---
I spy with my little eye a ton of grammar errors....  Lol
---
Why he so short
---
Hag and Shape should be higher than Plague, but it's not a bad tier list.
---
Hey! You forgot the godlike Save the Best For Last! I DEMAND EDITS /s
---
The killer perk No One Escapes Death. When the exits gates are powered, survivors are downed in one hit.
---
but whats the point in not using Scratched mirror? Just to make it harder? you will have a hard time considering your 105% movement speed.
---
He looks waist high to his normal self and now I'm crying thinking about him in game 
---
That'd be amazing

What can I say except **GGEZ BOOSTED BABY KILLER L2P KYS**
---
when i'm playing survivor, i despise Dying Light and Remember Me (god, have mercy on that survivor who ends up being the obsession), when i'm playing killer, i fuckin' hate Prove Thyself and Boil Over (i don't think a killer likes being genrushed and i swear to god, almost everytime i get Lerys, The Game, Haddonfield or shit like that, is someone who has Boil Over on)
---
Both coulorophobia and nurses calling require survivors to be healing in range of you. Having one of those perks alone kind of already discourages them from doing so, but with both? If they caught on to both perks than you'll be pretty much wasting 2 perk slots as they will never bother healing around you. 
---
Definitely go for different builds though. It's always refreshing, both as a killer playing and survivor playing against, to see builds that arent the standard meta. Even if I find the build annoying to play against, I always give some props to the killer for doing something slightly different.
---
r/amitheasshole

***LAUGHS IN FREDDY**
---
" *complete* removal of scratch marks? That's complete madness. "  
---
Not at all. Ebony Mori cuts *every single survivor's game in half*. That's madness, and it's in the game already. Also, Pink is ULTRA RARE. Meaning you'd only see it about as often as you see Ebony Mori. If you see Ebony Mori too often, that's an offering spawn problem, and not a problem with my offering idea.   
---
" Spirit especially. If you're going to run everywhere, it's only fair that there's evidence."  
---
Offering only affects one person who put it in. Spirit can still track the other targets, or use sound still. She can't be invisible forever anyway.   
---
" Two, this would be pretty to utterly useless against Predator "  
---
Wrong. Predator would be an absolutely useless perk against the survivor using this offering. That's the entire point.   
---
" Three, the name. Eclipse Bouquet has already been used for an offering that is sadly no longer with us. Let it Rest In Peace. "  
---
Again, wrong. There was never an "eclipse bouquet" in the game. Bouquets were: New Moon, Full Moon, and Quarter Moon. 
---
I like to think trappers map is pretty standard
---
Been doing NOED, wish i had bloodwarden
---
Partly to make it harder, partly because i don't have scratched mirrors.
---
I'd like to have Trapper laugh menacingly, or even say "**Weak**" or something after downing or hooking a survivor. 
---
After his Mori, he could say "**Pathetic...**"
---
Point is, I'd like more killers than miss Vomit to actually talk, except obviously Michael wouldn't. 
---
I think everyone knows coldwind farm
---
Freddy is immune to it, he just needs to wave his hand around and anyone in corn starts glowing.
---
I think it would help a lot, but it may also upset a lot of people too, because it could be perceived as unfair, since it would be completely random. But it would also fit in with the lore well. 
---
They could also start the game off really dark, and have it get lighter over time. [ Since the game is called dead by daylight ] It could make it a bit spookier.
---
There could be a ton of random things that could happen, and some of them could be dependent on the map. So say if you're looping the killer around the Farm's Dead cow tree, one time when you pass it the cow could fall out of the tree or something, or when you're walking by one of the tractors, or on top of it, it could suddenly start up and rev. 
---
There's a lot of things they could do to make things spookier, even if it would be jump scares, it could work just a bit. Or if you haven't worked on a Gen, or been in contact with another survivor for so long, perhaps your vision could become blurred from 'lack of hope', or SOMETHING. 
---
Not every idea I have would be great, but some could add to the horror factor a lot. 
---
I've tried to play more selfishly just to get points and pip but to no avail. Everyone gets found. I'm not usually the first found and hooked and I can loop just fine. It's just frustrating that, as soon as I go down, I can basically expect the rest of the game to be garbage for me.
---
Most likely. 
---
The blood webs don't change until you reach a new level.  He played this character during the last event, rolled this new blood web but never leveled up again until now, so it still shows the old offering.
---
this is more scary than a legion with nurses
---
It’s funny because I played against a P3 Myers with tombstone, NOED, and an Ebony Mori. He only got one kill which was me, but it was still hilarious to see the setup after the game. 
---
He probably thought it was a clip from the most recent patch, where, you have to tunnel for DS to go off. [ I say in the case you might not have dealt with DS since the change. :) ]
---
[Alright.](https://youtu.be/ySJpMyLiLRU)
---
Wait is there actually something wrong with slugging?
---
Just played this game.
---
Killer was nice enough, we had 5 gens done before I and the last survivor died. Just seems lopsided. This was solo queue but I dunno if there were any SWF.
---
Oh yes, forgot about that. This is before they changed it.
---
Survivors don't T-Bag, unrealistic tutorial.
---
Literally unplayable 
---
It's frustrating for the survivor, especially if you aren't playing SWF. It just leaves you on the ground unable to do anything while you just wait 2 minutes to bleed out and hope your team can get to you, except they're all being chased
---
I like how he unhooks the survivor then goes back to the hooked position 
---
But does their uncle work for BHVR or Sony????
---
Spirit and billy are pretty much even in terms of power. The gimmick of spirits 50/50 mindgames gets boring after awhile anyways too.
---
I've done this with Spirit a few times.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/DiligentTolerantGerbilPastaThat

Yep! I read your comment above. The other guy apparently didn't, Haha.

Hard yikes from me !
---
I consider this more of a confession tbh.
---
Thx.
---
Theres no “salt”, its the truth that you dont want o admit. 
---
Why do all Legion players like to delude themselves that the reason they play the character isnt because they are brain dead easy to play. Sounds like some top tier C O P E to me. Like at least admit it.
---
Probably not, probably going to be a survivor version of leatherface

oh, that's nothing. once i got camped by a Spirit 'cause i used dead hard to make it quickly to a pallet then telling me that that it's what i deserve for being a toxic cunt¿¿¿
---
Coldwind.
---
Damn
---
That means he’ll actually have to play the game, he enjoys his singleplayer experience in a multiplayer game too much to switch.
---
It's a game changer for killer. Just bring unbreakable or no mither. If youre being left to die though I can see how unfun that would be.
---
I like how this guy is trying to prove your OPINION wrong. 
---
Nope, it has been confirmed 😬
---
Of course, why couldn't console just get a free survivor like pc?
---
Survivors should get clubs to be able to beat the killer into the stunned state
---
Me when I’m trying to get an injured survivor to notice me for a heal, but they keep running to the edge of the map
---
The only addon you can really use is Boyfriend memo. Nothing else will really work unless you want to use glass fragment but even then you risk overstepping the tier 1 EW boundary. 
---
Perkwise (Not considering perks you have already mentioned);
---
- Sloppy Bucher: Considering you do not want to have extended chases with tier 1 myers, Having survivors take longer to heal is good for you.
---
- Nurses calling: Works well for tracking healing survivors. A very good way to surprise them &amp; make them feel pressured to not heal.
---
- You could use play with your food. If you find your obsession you will want to lose them in a chase &amp; it can be really useful for providing you with more map control when you get it. Survivors will not expect you to suddenly have speed that allows you to chase them.
---
- Rancor can be a good tracking perk. The ability to kill your obsession can also be useful for getting one kill. They won't know you have it as your immune to aura detection while in tier 1.
---
- Spies of the shadows can help with tracking. I would suggest whispers though as its better for gen patrol.
---
Honestly, I don't see how haunted grounds is useful for you in your build. The 60 seconds of exposed is great if you can find someone which is hard for you without scratched mirror. Could use whispers I suppose. You also lose 2 totems which you could save for NOED. If a survivor finds the one dull totem then they can break it, preventing NOED activating. 
---
I would suggest maybe;
---
Whispers
---
Nurses
---
NOED
---
Sloppy
---
M&amp;A for Whispers - Since you dont have much movement speed you do not want to waste time looking for survivors near gens. Rather you would be better saving time &amp; seeing if there are survivors near the gen. M&amp;A is good for entirely removing the terror radius but in 6m that is so close that the survivor will probably figure out that you are right next to them. Additionally, having the terror radius increase during a chase not only exposed you to surrounding survivors but also makes your red stain glow brighter which helps survivors loop you. I would consider swapping this but if you want to keep it pure stealth then stick to M&amp;A.
---
Nurses instead of BBQ allows you to make use of sloppy effect &amp; locate injured survivors as you will not be performing many chases. Will also make survivors feel exposed when healing. Using BBQ is a bit pointless as it takes so long to reach survivors that are 40m beyond the hook that by the time you get to them they will have likely been long gone from the location. Good for the bp though. 
---
Sloppy instead of haunted. Sloppy is good for forcing survivors to heal more outside a chase. They will feel pressure to do it as you can get an easy hit off them via stealth. It also combos well with Nurses allowing you to track survivors significantly easier.
---
The issue with haunted grounds is that it makes NOED much easier to destroy. Having 2 totems consumed by it leaves 3 dull totems. The 60 seconds of exposed can be a hit or miss. If you find someone while investigating its great. If you find someone but they are at a pallet then you will waste time being looped just to be stunned by the pallet.
---
Well since it isnt a Chapter but a paragraph it wont have the same price.
---
It isnt much but it helps the devs so theres that :)
---
This has been my build except for IW I have adrenaline and I love it so much on my Dwight.
---
Is that Cahlaflour trying not to sneeze in the background?
---
Hate to say it, but you are honestly right, I feel like PC gets more love
---
Maybe we will get a Billy skin like ash? 
---
  commie
---
As a killer getting flashlight stunned when you pick someone up sucks... but it doesn't deserve this kind of behaviour. Pathetic on the killers behalf. Not to mention its easy to move your head or spam drop to stop the stun.
---
I spam drop and go after the flashlight user... one user down one being chased and one going for a heal... leaves only 1 to do gen max no problem there.
---
Or if possible face wall and pick up.
---
Clearly billy is the result of inbreeding.
---
P.S. congrats on your first of I hope many flashlight saves.
---
He looks  like a toy on the box
---
Bill is licensed you know. That just shows that not all licensed dlc need to cost money.
---
This just adds more to some crap a cludette said after getting a flashlight save
---
Some matches will always be like that unfortunately.
---
But a good SWF group can help deal with tunneling and camping.

I dont get it but please take arrow.

I love the first perk, very nice, unique and neat idea
---
The iron will is to make sure they have a much harder time hearing you in a locker lol. This Dwight’s locker is his castle

It's hard on console because laggy skill checks, but when it doesnt lag it's pretty easy to just power through it

Lol there is no regular version. Only the 'special edition' which is 30 but OFTEN goes on sale for like $11. I bought this game for many friends who didn't get it when it was free.

Good job!

Did you also had the ruler?

Holy shit

so will anyone from the team respond because i literally cant find any matches and i would just rather have my money back if i wont be able to play i will wait a couple of days for a response then im calling sony to see what i can do about this. this is absolutely  unacceptable. things were fine when we had that wait timer and i waited 3 months for that im not waiting another 3 months to play a game i paid for 
---
Woag*
---
Good luck with the build man. Maybe could try experimenting with Play with your food as a survivor does not expect a 120% movement speed tier 1 Myers to come pounding down on them.
---
that's a super unhelpful comment. 
---
Play a 4man SWF and bully the killers hard. That's what I do when the games get sweaty.
---
I cant say without 100% you haven't,  you fucking pedophile.
---
See how easy that was?  I hate to be a dick but this 2019. Not one person recorded or took screen shots?

no mither gets you hooked immediately. They know you have it, they won't just slug you.
---
PC has regular for $20 and console has Special Edition for $30. Should probably check your facts
---
Sure, you can body block all you want but it just delays the inevitable
---
From playing both sides over the last few months, I think I've seen more Survivors DC than Killers. I haven't been able to play Survivor since the update, so I can't experience this from both sides anymore.
---
Yea I know how to play spirit, I dont use the stand still mindgame except in low ranks because people just run away usually. 
---
I dont like using add ons better than green because its kinda boring, especially on spirit. Wakisashi is just super broken. 
---
Billy and Spirit are definitely similar in power level, especially with no add ons. Depends on the map and the survivors perks a little bit though.
---
999 of everything on nurse pretty much
---
Thank you &lt;3 I just started playing killer so I definitely understand the salt, like adrenaline as a survivor is awesome when it works but watching 4 people get insta healed as a killer makes me literally want to die lmao. 
---
One of the survivors called me toxic too and I just couldn’t wrap my head around it??? I refuse to teabag, point/wave, do anything besides give a proper chase and I get one flashlight save and everyone hates me? So confusing, but it just makes me wanna play better. :P
---
That used to work, but doesn’t anymore. Unless everyone I’ve played with since the last update has been set to anonymous 
---
No he won't. It surely was expensive to get Bruce Campbell into the studio to record the voice lines and the license for the character probably wasn't anything close to cheap.
---
Still works. Did it today.

---
Just had the luxury of finding out that not only can you cheese the chase mechanic, but you can also run whatever add-on it is that increases the time it takes to mend, except it's bugged so it stacks over and over and over after each hit.
---
Legion ran it and BBQ. Chased my teammate on the other end of the map after hitting me with Deep Wound at the middle building of Ormond. I ran to the opposite side of the map. He was able to spend the time needed to down the survivor, hook them, read BBQ, come to me at the other side of the map and down me, because if I stopped mending, I dropped. I was one-third of the way done the mend at that point, just to put this all into perspective.
---
Odd as it says I’m not in a session when I try it
---
Noice! Good to know hahaha
---
I played a game with a legion named "Sexy Basement Time" who was running your standard basement build, but would carry you to the basement and just violently shake around instead of hooking. If you wiggled out he would just down you or somebody else and carry you back.
---
Chin seems fine to me, nose is the only thing that sticks out to me, but everyone is different and there's nothing wrong with a big nose or chin, we've all got our own tastes!
---
Than don't get downed or stay away from the killer. 
---
Noice thank you!
---
What would you rather have these upvotes go towards?
---
Oof that hurt to watch as a survivor 
---
I also play solo and I never body block anyone or force them to heal me. If they won't heal me I just self care
---
For reference, i had to leave because i couldnt look up or down and couldnt see my own weapon. After i downed a survivor, I couldn't even hook them. It was quite the experience
---
Becouse  killers always have to whine about something. You know just nerf every single survivor perk to boil over tier and they will stop maybe.
---
Dont write back. I got banned 2 times for that. Just report em and block em

Its the only time I bring one is to get a downed teammate a second go. Especially if they are good.

Throw out the whole match just to get one kill and ruin the fun for someone just because they were playing the game as it should be. Nice.
---
Legion chases are not real chases. No one that is the slightest bit sportsmanlike prefers Legion because of this fact.
---
You don't just enjoy hectic chases as Legion. The comment you're responding to is not to be discredited. Both sides are correct. No self-respecting killer would want to play Legion when he is /so/ unsatisfying to "win a chase" with.
---
I can tell you: Its not.
---
Having to hit someone multiple times more than a normal killer is fast for you?
---
... Kay.
---
Nope but wish i were in that club (still escaped)
---
since the new system i double piped three times, once with myers: no perks or addons, it was for a daily. once with wraith: no perks or addons, again, for a daily. third time was with pig and i had perks and addons...

I'm scrounging for Ash bloodpoints, I break them when I see them. Did Jeff say anything in post?
---
:(
---
"FOR ENTITY'S SAKE, WHY ARE THESE DELICIOUS FOODS TRAPPED WITHIN THIS METALLIC TOMB?"
---
It's like if you combined Emma Watson and Feng Min
---
Not like it matters, but I've been on here and played both enough to see both sides bitching about evenly on anything they don't like.
---
Seems like most people do not like the meta being adjusted at all for their preferred side, and they really hate every meta perk / build for either side.
---
I really enjoyed those PS games of evil dead!
---
Yo is anyone else getting Ashley Madison ads on the side bar?
---
likewise!
---
The map is poorly designed for both sides. Its either a really really easy game or all four survivors are dead before a gen gets done, theres no inbetween. I honestly dont think anyone would miss it if it got deleted, except maybe doctor mains and the occasional meme build killer. The killer has to have the right setup to excel, and survivors have to have amazing RNG to excel. 
---
They know they’ll just get sent back to the campfire with all 10 fingers anyway
---
But that’s just a theory 
---
Don't forget to brush up on your Ancient Babylonian for full immersion!
---
Please do
---
Except what do Surviviors complain about? Camping, tunnelling, and NOED are the big 3 I've seen. NOED is actual bullshit and rewards bad killers so I completely understand where they're coming from there. 
---
Camping is a dick move that killers do to preserve their score. Killers complain all the time about BT thinking that it's bullshit...like dude it won't do anything if you don't camp the damn hook. 
---
Tunnelling? Killers are bitching at Survivior mains for saying that enduring shouldn't lower the current DS stun time and I agree with them. It's bullshit that the only anti tunnelling perk in the game rn is countered by a perk you'll find on the fucking Hillbilly. 
---
I main Spirit and even I can see how 1 sided shit is for killers rn. 
---
I feel like I know them. Did the bottom guy bring a flashlight?
---
Okay.
---
Adrenaline Ash’s new perk , Borrowed Time, And dead hard are going to be my new perk setup :)
---
i love it! it’s so simple but sweet :D
---
I have a black cat named Kira too! He’s a boy tho. 
---
I think this would be a good [not unbalanced] perk if it was actually backwards. 
---
But if it was backwards, it couldn't be a Dying Light rework because the name would make no sense. 
---
If it was though, it would be a good way to secure your hook as any killer, and it would lose strength as the game goes on, yes, but it would also make it more fair to the smaller number of survivors. It would be crazy for stealth builds, but not so much that it screws over the team entirely. 
---
"it's too hard to carry Surviviors to the basement from the other end of the map nerf boil over now pls"
---
Lmao ok have fun with all those issues in your op that would literally be solved with SWF. 
---
Bullying is fun.
---
I don't know about that.
---
 I think that change would completely kill it. You'd have throw an entire build together to protect it, which only incentivises playing like hot garbage to justify bringing it.
---
Right now, it makes sense to bring Ruin, NOED, or both at cost of two slots. The problem is how low-risk it is until it is lit. I don't think anyone would bother bringing a totem you have to protect all match to get an extra kill, and it makes ToTH the only interaction with dull totems.
---
I quite like it since it’s an indoor map. They should remove some pallets but add another L wall and make it considerably larger, opposite of what happened to swamp.
---
Definitely but it’s funny as hell though
---
I like to play Pig too.
---
Tell me how absolutely terrible i am because of that please.
---
If you'll play the game for a long time, and are wanting to be a veteran than yes.  If not, no.
---
Unless you get it from a subscription to playstation plus, which DbD was in a while back as well which is when I picked it up for console. Got it all for "free" for a service I maintained anyway.
---
Survivors gamble when they run adrenaline every game. Killers should have to make the same gamble with NOED. 
---
Honestly it's funny, and the people complaining are silly. 
---
Sometimes you gotta' take their items away. I've had it happen to me, and I still think it's funny when killers go out of their way to say: "NO, FUCK YOUR ITEM." Haha.
---
fathieu
---
Didn’t know 8k was a thing.
---
LOL
---
Pretty good job! Could you do this for the Doctor also? 
---
Why do you feel the need to say that? Is it helpfull? Does is maybe make you feel good? I really dont know..
---
Btw..OP I find you very beautifull and the cosplay is spot on! GG!
---
They're trying to find a happy medium which is good for everyone that plays, not just you. Please re-read this post, cause this isn't very positive is it?
---
I think it will heavily depend on the sales of the Trapper one. If he sales really well, we may see others. 
---
Why...
---
I agree with you to a point. The heal is okay for it to have-- I just think Freddy gets screwed over enough that it waking them up sucks. I don't even own Freddy, but I feel sorry for anyone that loves playing him.
---
It would be cool if they set the music to rotate so a different version played every day.
---
Yeah, there have been weird glitches lately where shit just becomes neon.
---
I like how Jeff  looked at Meg before getting smack lmao
---
Just a lil bit
---
No kidding, how old's your cat?
---
Uh I’m gonna hard disagree with saying it’s understandable but Freddy is shitty and I’m glad we agree on that
---
He’s almost 7
---
I posted their twitter as well, as most artists work from Twitter these days. [ I say this as an artist. ]
---
Lol nice try, but that killer was a rank 2.
---
Apparently no. Someone once checked the probability of getting rare items on different prestiges. The rates remained the same. Anyway, you lose your progress, so even if there was some miniscule improvement, it's just not worth it. Unless you want bloodied skins, that is.
---
You didnt need to tell me how bad you were at the game, I already inferred that when you told everyone you like playing as Legion.
---
“A mori actively HURTS the killer”
---
And you call me insane? Lmao. 
---
No. 
---
Survivors need a pink offering equally as powerful. Anyone who remembers old pink BNP knows it was INSANELY powerful, as it immediately repaired a gen completely. If you took in four, then it really was a free game. 
---
Being unable to ez track a survivor for one game won’t kill you. 
---
Yea, I can barley find a game with one other friend... its a fun game but the servers on ps4 are non-existent... trying playing killer though! It doesn’t take long at all (At least for me).
---
So we know when the new chapter is launching?
---
Don’t let dipshits like that discourage you from playing, there are a lot of people who do play for fun and don’t get all butthurt! Idiots like this are not worth ruining the fun that this game is!
---
Actually managed to escape :p
---
Exactly, I guess they got mad that they lost their rainbow map
---
What about going against cheaters? Or killer DCs as soon as he finds out it's 3v1... 3v1 makes no sense for both sides and everybody is asking why it's even in the game.
---
Why is the hillbilly floating?
---
She'll break your vending machine. 
---
Ya girl needs her Takis.
---
It has been going surprisingly well, i typically leave with 1-2 kills at rank 5. partially because people underestimate you. and partially because you can pull some good mind games. I actually intended to de-rank a little with the build, but that has not been happening.
---
I'd still ride it 
---
The game isn’t killer sided unless you you’re against 4 solo and passive survivors or you’re using very strong addons. Good survivors dictate how a match goes unless you far outskill them as killer.
---
Tuesday the 2nd
---
Does anyone else see Nea when looking at her face?
---
My god. The game isn’t just about BP ya know. Survivors main goal is to SURVIVE, and killers main goal is to KILL. You CANNOT justify your response by saying “but less BP tho”. 
---
Oh no. I can’t ez track ONE SURVIVOR for this game. 
---
You just be a horrible killer. 
---
With the current hit boxes playing survivor is nearly impossible even for the best
---
Reggie is gone, Bowser took over.
---
Also easily the best perk against spirit. I never not run it for that reason.
---
That is the scariest f**king thing I’ve ever seen in my entire life *give birth to a child* AHHhHHHHHhH
---
Sure are a lot of "not Ochido fans" being apologists for him ITT. Hmmmm 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
Yea
---
W
---
Okay psycho
---
Not really true but you are allowed to believe whatever you want.
---
Wow, what an asshole. Accidents happen you're not psychic.
---
Yeah I know Reggie is gone, but he’s more well known so it makes sense
---
Have you seen some of the hitboxes
---
OP said "OP", not that it wasn't effective. 
---
Its not as good as it used to be, but now it isn't bullshit for killers, it should have a longer stun time imo or have it not affected by enduring.
---
I heard that before when I played Pig, it appears that all DLC killers are overpowered and none of the free ones are even that good in their opinion.
---
Thanks mate. :)
---
I got crapped on too for supposedly giving someone up once. I had bond on and know damn well I never even saw them the entire match but got accused anyways. Some of the uptight folks really want to find anyone to blame but themselves. Just gotta brush it off and in the future if they swear, Sony has a low tolerance for that kinda shit. Report the uptight little bitch to Sony and send them packing to a nice little ban, teach them a lesson.
---
This is funny as hell honestly 
---
Waaaay too much. Think smaller, maybe knock a second off the sprint and call it good.
---
Considering they’re getting ready for dedicated servers, which are pretty expensive, I don’t expect there will be free characters in the future.
---
Don’t remind me of this advert, I’m not ready to cry again 😭😭😭
---
Mmmm. Salt. I love salty people
---
While you may be correct, I personally dont think dedicated servers have anything to do with free dlc.
---
The others can be in play all match, NOED affects the very end, which usually lasts about a minute, or about three if people heal up and go back for NOED / a save.
---
NOED has been reworked to be a punishment for not finding / doing totems while focusing gens.
---
 I'm suggesting they actually add a counter for totems, and make it clear if they are getting finished to the survivors, instead of just nerfing the main reason to interact with dull totems out of existence.
---
I've just started keeping my task manager open so its easier to restart when it happens
---
 Nobody knows if they were actually camping. Survivors use "camper" as a general insult when they lose.
---
Do babies have a full skin?
---
From the Killer’s point of view, the survivor is holding the game hostage. The Killer has the survivor in a no win situation: he can neither exit through the hatch or complete generators. The survivor is forcing a stalemate by taking no action. 
---
Either way, it’s bullshit that situations like this can happen. Either make it so the Killer can’t snatch survivors when they jump in or let the Killer shut the hatch and gain some sort of sight on the remaining survivor so they can’t lame the game out. Either of those would be better. 
---
Report them and block them. Sony actually bans people for shit like this. Should probably turn your messages to friends only.
---
i think it should be 90 sec and 4 sec stun
---
No, the survivor in the situation is stuck in a corner and because the killer is standing on the hatch he can’t attempt to jump in. 
---
In a normal hatch standoff situation you’d be right but this isn’t really a normal standoff. 
---
I keep getting called a camper or tunneler by the players leaving blood trails and scratches all over the god damn map. 
---
Surviviors SHOULDN'T have to care about dull totems. They're dull for a reason. 
---
NOED is a crutch perk, not a punishing one. If you give someone a secondary objective that they have to clear in order for you to not get super buff bc you can't stop them from completing their primary win condition, then it isn't punishing them for not doing totems. It's rewarding you for not knowing how to play the game. 
---
A counter for totems won't save soloq. Dull totems should flat out not be a concern for Surviviors, simple as that. 
---
Yeah. I spend 8-10 hours on a piece sometimes. It would be like stealing a day’s pay! 
---
I'd like to save my bp for him, even as a killer main, but my Plague still hasn't found a single level of BBQ and Chili after I've already filled two perk pages and a half.
---
Damn people can't just say gg anymore now a days. they have to judge others playstyles too.

If you want to try and rush your opponent out of the match m, BHVR gives you the freedom to do it. Sometimes there's downsides to cutting corners or taking shortcuts to victory, and when you have the tools and strategies available to prevent it but you choose to take your chances in the name of efficiency that's 100% your fault and not some design flaw with the game. 
---
Finally the survivor buff we deserve!  /s

Nurse and hillbilly?

But yes DBD is incredibly P2W, you have to pay to get OP killers like pig and myers..

I like these changes.

Huntress Lullaby Tier 4
---
I felt the power as I merely watched. 
---
It deactivates and I think needs to be built back from zero again.
---
I really wouldn't worry too much until it's here. I've seen people, (our lead Freddy defender, on this thread, included.) point out that 'Save the Best for Last' is going to be good for countering it and bad for survivors in general.
---
If you ask me, after the initial release, it'll be about as used and as much of a surprise as Deliverance.
---
&gt;I think your viewpoint is absolutely the problem here. The primary win condition is to survive, not to power the gate. The game would end when it's powered if that's the case.
---
The directive given to the Surviviors is to power the gate and leave. This is according to Benedict Baker's journal. 
---
The directive given to the killers is to (quoting the Entity) "do not let the light in" and according to the loading screen, sacrifice Surviviors. NOED is only active if you fail to not let the light in. 
---
&gt;Additionally, finding all 5 totems with 2-3 people looking isn't even that hard,
---
If there wasn't a homicidal killer hunting you down then it's easy. But when one of you only gets precious few seconds before they get downed the moment they're spotted, suddenly at least 1 person has to go get him off the hook, and 1 needs to do gens to keep the game moving before the pallets run out. Lookie there, now you only have 1 person looking for totems, and if the killer patrols a totem, good luck bc it's never getting cleansed. 
---
&gt;That's absolutely a punishment, I think you just feel like totems are not an objective because they aren't always a problem, unlike gens. The problem is the Killers running it, right?
---
When you need to give someone a secondary objective bc you can't stop them from completing their primary, then yes you are the problem, so yes the problem is the killers running it. 
---
&gt;NOED always, 100% of the time procs because there's still totems, and it doesn't matter at all if the killer played well or not.
---
It also always 100% of the time procs when the gens are done, which means the killer *failed their objective of killing the Surviviors before the gens finished*. If NOED procs it means the totems weren't cleansed and the killer didn't stop them from doing the gens. 
---
&gt;A counter absolutely saves everyone the guesswork, and is most useful for solo queue players, so I'm not sure how you figure on that one.
---
You tie it to one lit totem and boom, it's your fault if it doesn't get cleansed. You as a Survivior should not concern yourself with dull totems, bc you already have gens, lit totems, and the killer to worry about. The killer only ever gets 1 objective, kill the Surviviors. Why should the Surviviors have so much more than the killers? 
---
I get it, gens get done too quickly, NOED is not the answer to that problem
---
It's some Japanese Twitter account-he posts alot of smol Huntress
---
Nope. They were talking about it on McLean's stream the other day, with him saying he wished they had a better term
---
Eliminating the number of opportunities ASAP isn't a crutch any more than popping generators ASAP is. The only difference is your level of empathy for each side's objective. For some reason trying hard to survive is seeing as more noble or something to most players than trying hard to kill, when nobody is actually dying, and a five minute match lasts the same amount of time regardless of how you were rushed out of it. 
---
Calm down, fedora
---
I'm right tho so fuck u

Oh I just thought they were on the second floor and you were looking at them with deer stalker. Lol.

That’s actually pretty mild toxicity.  
---
A legion cosplay isn’t complete unless you can do the bad posture creep walk thing
---
When the new update came out the matchmaking was only 1-2 minutes for ps4 now its back to its old ways like 20 minutes to join a game (even longer)
---
It would make Moris pointless, if someone has been hooked twice already why bother mori’ing them when you can just hook them the 3rd time for their death? 
---
I use to have games actuallu last long because of chases which isn’t the case now. I find myself rage quitting most nights because I can’t tell if I’m off or the games changed but I don’t like it.
---
Remember a couple weeks ago when everyone was worried how brokenly good head on was going to be? 
---
Well she probably views the Entity as a god of some kind, but who is anyone's guess. 
---
If the Entity is a feminine force, as suggested by how feminine articles and pronouns are used to refer to it in the developer's native French, then it would probably steal the identity of a female god from Adiris' memories. If this is the case, Inanna would be a prime choice, seeing as her divine role included a bit of everything and whose followers were extremely devoted. 
---
If Adiris was a priestess of the city of Uruk, Inanna's chief city, she'd probably do anything the Entity asked if it could convince her it was Inanna; even if that thing that was asked was ritualistic murder.
---
Regardless of who the Entity is posing as, Adiris' perks make it seem that she views the Survivors as infidels. She probably sees her job as a holy one: punish the wicked and evil. It is more than likely that using her modified power of being very sick is viewed as a way of expunging her body of disease and inflicting those of the unfaithful.
---
Of course there's also the possibility that the Entity just treated Adiris like most of the other Killers ("do what I want or get hurt") and that any masquerading it's doing as a deity is more on Adiris' part than the Entity's. Adiris just seeing what she wants to see, rather than what is actually happening.
---
I farm salt from these comments until they give up, its always hilarious
---
I feel Michael would find someone to help him, stare at them until they got the message, and then breathe down their neck until they’d retrieved the bag. Then he’d choke them to death.
---
&gt;lessens bloodpoint gain for killer.
---
After burning the offering, killers can choose when to mori. They have the **option** to mori someone after being hooked once or, if they want bloodpoints, they can **choose** to mori someone who is dead on hook. 
---
We're definitely not going to agree here, but you made solid points. Only new points from me is:
---
- Gatekeeper is only 1/4 emblems, and can still be filled most of the way even if they open, so the tutorial isn't a great way to keep track of what you should be doing to rank up in this game.
---
- Survivors have more to do because there's 4 of them that against all but 2 killers dictate the entire flow of the game. Even if 70% of the playerbase is playing badly enough to go down quickly in chases, that isn't reason to balance around that.
---
 You need to balance games around high-level play, or they end up like this one.
---
Slugging is an important part of the game though, there are a handful of perks based around it,  including infectious fright and some of Ash's upcoming perks.  Slugging is here to stay.  I don't mind being slugged either, it's better than getting tunneled and put straight back on the hook.  It gives me a chance, and slugging is only effective if survivors allow it by grouping up.
---
Man I love these videos. So informative. Hope they can upload more sooner than later.
---
Whats the issue? Gen tapping takes forever
---
How many survivors DC'd from that match?
---
Just didn't load in?
---
Smurf Gang
---
Only issue with it is the stun timer. Survivors keep complaining about tunneling but don’t welcome an anti-tunneling perk. ONLY 60 seconds after hook? If you can chase the killer off the hook for over 60 seconds, that’s amazing but then you wouldn’t need the perk in the first place. 
---
Seriously, increase the stun timer so it’s actually something to be respected but keep it as a perk that punishes a playstyle that’s a serious detriment to one person’s fun. Outside of DS there’s not much you can do about tunneling, new DS gives you a little (Not enough right now) help. Make the stun a few seconds longer so you can actually run to a looping spot, and it’s a good perk
---
Want an easy win as killer? Tunnel the first guy you hook, they dc 75% of the time
---
&gt; dying makes the game unfun
---
Who knew
---
Neas like wtf is this thing?
---
Thank you! When I went to the DbD booth I was worried I'd look stupid but people started recognizing it and if I get too excited I start to cry and then Mathieu said something about it and I started bawling my eyes out and kept trying to avoid dev eye contact  afterwards but it didn't really work and I ended up with a really bad headache afterwards because I was crying almost the entire time I was at the booth and I didn't even with the match I played there 
---
Tl;Dr
---
.... I'm so glad I dressed up, no matter how simple ^_^
---
maybe, just maybe, if a lot of ppl disconnects against a killer then that killer needs a rework? i mean a lot less people disconnects against billy, because that killer actually needs skill.
---
What a great event smh
---
Ebony mori needs to go, don't need to fight fire with fire to make the game even more miserable.  You have to account for the fact there are 4 survivor's.  If they all burn the offering, imagine how stupid that would be.  Killers would insta-DC in loading screen anyway.
---
Oh ok. I'm fine with that though. Tit for tat.
---
Havent played in a while but i always have enjoyable games when i slug a surviver IF i know where someone is and i feel like i can get there without losing too much time, this results in more pressure and the games go longer (well sometimes not if the 2nd surviver gets slapped down before the other one gets back up) and about tunneling well i will go after the injured one slap them down if i know someone is close slug and happy hunting
---
Playing both sides, I've had two killers D/C in the past month. 
---
I've lost count of survivors. Full teams against me, all three of the people with me while surviving. Sometimes only two, only one. But it's survivors. 
---
So many survivors D/C that it's almost unplayable at certain ranks. 
---
Dwight has had enough of the Nurse’s shit.
---
It's really just a nice thing to do for survivors, no real benefit. If I run up on a hook after an unhook and see both survs, I'll chase down the unhooker. If I don't see any survs and stumble on the injured surv from the hook, then he's sol.
---
I also play survivor so I know how shitty it feels to get unhooked only to be chased back down. You can climb the ranks and do just as well without tunneling.
---
Probably the most cheated I've ever felt in this game. I actually haven't played again since. 
---
You're the asshole, but it's hilarious how salty people get over Franklin's so it's hard not to laugh 
---
&gt;But more often than not they tunnel and mori strsight off hook. I think you need to meet more requirements before moriing
---
Then its their choice to earn less bloodpoint by doing that. Keyword being "choice". 
---
If you make the requirement for using a Mori so difficult, killers wouldn't have control over it as smart survivors can easily take hits for others and swap places on hooks, at least this is what I do when playing SWF. 
---
Unless you own every licenced DLC, having Moris appear on the bloodweb aren't as common as people think. 
---
Oh boy, I see you haven't faced a doc on game...
---
Legion basically is Ghostface. It still makes me scratch my head on why they added Bubba when Hillbilly is clearly inspired by him. 
---
What a time we live in, where a Japanese person can love a Russian character.
---
Still promotes tunneling.  Any perk that gives incentive to eliminate a survivor from the game immediately is going to promote an unfun playstyle of soft camping and bee-lining straight back to down the same survivor.  I'd like to see more perks in the style of bbq, which promotes hooking different survivors.
---
Yeah, this kind of makes you a jerk. 
---
First of all, they REALLY need to widen the basement stairs. It’s meant to be the killer’s domain, but being able to force people to DC if you decide to be a d*** is completely stupid. 
---
Secondly, the devs seem to be focussing on nerfing survivors because survivors were SO strong before, and the balance is finally being shifted. More pallets have been added to certain maps, and the new temple map has a ridiculous amount of them too. All killers but nurse still rely on the survivors making mistakes, not the other way around. In this way, survivors still control the flow of the game which won’t ever change 
---
Tldr: Basement stairs need change but devs are certainly not bias against survivors
---
It’s faster than the loss of progression of failing a skill check. And most the gen tappers tap because they can’t hit skill checks. 
---
I don’t think ivorys are a big deal, strong but not op, ebony moris are without a doubt the strongest thing in the game as far as I’m concerned should be removed.
---
A good majority of games I go against a killer who has a mori. I shouldn't be punished for the killer choosing to have a mori. Moris shouldn't be used in every match and I think having stricter requirements before you can mori people would lessen mori usage and make it more fair.
---
How did nobody DC before getting moried? Good job though it’s so difficult to get 4 moris especially with DH
---
Ahh &gt;u&lt; Feng had a long day of vaulting through windows and needed a bath haha I don't know special effects makeup at all so the face tally marks were as creative as I felt I could do TT_TT tysm!
---
TBH, not that much of an asshole.  Keys are kinda stupid anyway.
---
Funb*
---
Yeah that's a lot of bull, I don't even blame you. 
---
The worst I've seen is someone have a Billy run right past them when they were able to move, but survivors are supposed to be able to move before the killer? It's like a few seconds unless they changed it. So this is absolutely not okay.
---
Thank you! I really appreciate that ^_^

Dying five minutes into a game after being tunneled off hook is unfun. And only getting like 8k bloodpoints .

Looks like he met you

I like immersing myself and acting like im part of the scenery. This is an indirect nerf to my play style. I will not have it
---
Not the actual source 
---
Please tell me you have a link to anyone saying that. I know certain people have spaghetti strainers for skulls, but that is something else.
---
Honestly Coulrophobia is really bad.  Any survivor with a brain is not going to heal in your TR.  And if they are potato enough to do it, then you probably don't need Coulrophobia.
---
TLDR: Coulrophobia=ass
---
Hey I have those same shoes
---
Decent apology, I give it about a 6.5.
---
I don't trust him to stick to this, but we'll see where this goes I guess.

i dont prestige so my myers has mostly everything. You better get rdy to be mori’d.

My favorite survivors are the one's when we have 1 gen left and it's 50% done and are furiously teabagging me to heal them.  The gen pops and they have adrenaline.  Extra IQ points in this scenario if it's against a legion.
---
As a fellow artist, I'm just glad to see when SOME PEOPLE credit it, though I've found the credit for some people....
---
That said, I would be sad if someone posted something that was meant for Patreon or something, so yeah, that's rough. 
---
It wont load for me :c

big brain survivor main

God. I don't know why people get one skill check then proceed to run around the map for 15 minutes trying to find it. Just do the damn generator.
---
My issue with ruin is that I hate going against it 10 games in a row. I want something different.
---
It's absolute trash... I average at least 19K - 20K per round, been stuck on Rank 8 for a good 5 hours.... 5 fucking hours... besides the fact that when the killer D/C's you lose a pip, it's been unbearable trying to rank up in this new ranking system.
---
Ash Williams or no, if this shit doesn't get fixed I'm not buying that DLC... what's the fucking point of even having a rank system in your game if you literally make it impossible to play the game the way you want to?
---
The way I see it is, you're forced to basically get 5K in each category now in order to get even a single pip... which is insane considering it would mean you have to survive every single round among doing really risky shit and sitting on at least two full gens... between 4 people... yeah not happening.
---
These guys are fucked in the face if they think this is a good counter to the abysmally easy ranking system we had before.
---
Is it too much to ask that 20K = 1 pip and surviving = the other pip... That way if you don't meet the criteria of one category at least you get a mercy pip for surviving the fucking round, bare minimum.
---
At least this way someone could go all out, have their fun, do all the risky things like rescuing / healing / body blocking and even if they die they can still get a single pip...
---
It's not that hard of a thing to do... 2 pips tied to score alone is fucking mental when the criteria is already too high to even get a single pip.
---
Good name 😁
---
It seems like a lot of work to widen all the basement stairs.  What about just removing collision from killers if they've been afk for a certain amount of time?  Not sure how much coding that would require.
---
There's an important distinction here. Were you just slugged during the match or was the killer actively trying to win through slugging, I.e downing everyone before hooking? Because the latter is shitty and the former is just part of the game.

Now that you mention it... doesn't Russia STILL own some Japanese islands they took "temporarily" after WWII?
---
Found them. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuril_Islands

Has been confirmed, he does say it, my guess is he says it after opening a chest.
---
change decrease to increase and slap it on the docktah for the most unfun shit you've seen in your life.

I've been hearing people say that you have to double pip with merciless killer now. It's ridiculous.
---
This new pipping system has me not playing these days. I hope they revert it like they did matchmaking.
---
Fun fact you don't even have to hitbthe chicken great skill checks, just stop for a second when you mess up.
---
Also with how frequently I have to deal with ruin I just make stake out a permanent perk in anybof my builds.
---
Maybe the other log is for the killer since it's a different size from the others.
---
McMillan
---
Why not permanent?
---
Just use NOED to outskill them.
---
You have to get merciless killer and or a double pip to get the achievement. I know Monto was having trouble getting it as well.
---
theoretically, it might work if everyone dses after the previous obsession has been killed.
---
No bro he's not joking, he would probably shoot them out of pure instinct too

A big mansion seems cool or like a prison.  I was really disappointed by Father Campbell's,  I wanted a true carnival map.

I’m honestly surprised by all the people saying tunneling is the best option, yet they’re right. Don’t constantly camp the hooks but if you run into the injured survivor you have no reason to target anyone else, unless someone bodyblocks (Exception to this is if said injured person is on last hook). 
---
It’s up to the survivors to protect their vulnerable comrade, by bodyblocking, distracting and confusing the killer with their scratchmarks. I’ve seen excellent survivor plays like this and honestly if every survivor was this clever tunneling wouldn’t be an issue except for people that camp the hook. 
---
If you’re really worried about tunneling, just run Make Your Choice to make targetting the other person an even better option (Since the unhooked needs to waste time healing) and discourages camping 
---
At the end of the day play how you want to play. Your job as a killer is to get survivors. Play smart but mercilessly and you’re doing great. Go out of your way to harm your own objective and try to ruin a survivor’s experience (Looking at you, Leatherface who stares into Claudette’s eyes with your chainsaw revved at the hook when there’s so many gens still up) and you’re being a pretty toxic A-hole 
---
No one tactic or playstyle is toxic if it’s actually the best decision to make. Except moonwalking with Legion perhaps, though the devs have said it’s fine
---
This is a long comment so if you have to take something from this, remember you’re a KILLER and kill effectively, but don’t be needlessly mean unless you have a reason to be angry
---
I run prove thyself, so the speed from that with me + 1 person on the gen outweighs ruin. Doesn't matter if you can't hit greats, just go for goods so it doesn't explode and I got the greats down. It's fine. Get the totem if you see it but it's a total waste to go looking for it.
---
I ran stake out for a while, it was awesome. It really was. My friends I play with laughed at me for it but at least I can hit my skill checks shrug.
---
This is cute and all but where are my boyos and gals Legion?
