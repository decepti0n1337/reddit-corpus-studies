Don't run Distressing on Legion.
---
---
---
A toxic survivor argued in post-game chat that pointing at me repeatedly wasn't toxic, it just meant he wanted me to chase him. I asked why he didn't just play normally in that case, and how that was different from teabagging if the only intent is to taunt and get me riled up at them.
---
What do pointing at the killer after pallet stuns and beckoning them over mean, respectively?
---
People who disconnect are the biggest pussies imaginable. If you disconnect, kill yourself.
---
You can see a killer's loadout, including their perks, add-ons, and offerings after all four survivors have either escaped or died. Before then, however, the killer's loadout remains hidden so that the other survivors can't use voice-comms to warn the others of what's coming.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also killers are supposed to run faster than survivors, don't know who or how someone made that sound like hacking but someone said that already. I'm just stricken by the absurdity of that notion.
---
I’ve depipped in games like this because I did all the gens in the time the person was on the hook being facecamped. You wanna know why? Because the killer didn’t chase anybody else and we couldn’t save the person.
---
Plus, not to mention, JUST DOING GENS IS BORING. I wanna be chased!! I wanna mindgame! I wanna actually PLAY THE GAME. Not just sit there and hold one button the entire match and hit a few skill checks, thats so boring!?
---
For sure! Perks are definitely whatever style suits you best for this game so I gotta see if any of those work with my style or not
---
The thing is... You not only get perks by spending BP, if we get a LOT of BP every match, then, for example, moris would be something regular, and that does not sound really balanced
---
Haha alright man. Just a suggestion.  Ppl are way better now though. Like some killers it's really hard to get away from. Teleporting and shit like that is very rare. If I play hunter I can get a 4k. Depends on the skill of survivors of course too. But yeah. It's a neat game. I like the graphics and the mysterious nightmare before Christmas look to it. If you want a game not to take too serious and to pass time than its perfect. Ice actually been enjoying it competitively though. Bc it's a smooth running game and upgrading your character is fun. Skill checks are always easy though in dbd as well. Killer can have perks to make them smaller. I only said that about you saying favor of the survivors bc that just sounds like something out of this reddit. A survivor says something and a response like that always follows. But I get what you're saying.
---
I haven’t used it since Remember Me got nerfed but yeah it works. You just need to make sure your Obsession is dead before the gens get powered and the build really relies on the aura reading of Class Photo
---
Oh it’s wonderful. Especially because I keep getting survivors teabagging in 4 man parties.
---
Spirit fury is useless without Enduring. 
---
Enduring is still good without Spirit Fury
---
Spirit Fury is A, Enduring is C
---
Wtf man?
---
Isn't 17 like, the age of consent in most states tho. I hate pedophiles but it just might be legal won't it?
---
When you go to chose a theme, it will give you the option to do a custom one and you can just pick the image from your gallery.
---
It might play the base music, but I'm not sure since I have it turned off.
---
Leatherface more pig then pig
---
I was looking at the floating bird
---
You know your right and thats the worst part
---
Evil dead!!!! How can you say no to Bruce Campbell? Literally why I got DbD lol
---
Thank you for answering my question! I hope you guys will add more outfits for David and Jake as well. Thank you again!!
---
I have watched it. It helps alittle bit but I’m still getting wrecked
---
Or they could get rid of it, or give 50% of it as part of the base game. It strongly encourages killers to only play billy/nurse.
---
It's really new, before the last big patch this status worked differently
---
U right
---
WAAAAZZZZUUUPP!
---
Isn’t distressing good to hit survivors with?because once you hit someone it’s easier to see others
---
&gt;What perk should I use instead of distressing?
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse.
---
Thank you, sad I do not have all that much time to be aware of the updates, but you solved a big question
---
We all play to have fun. Sometimes, returning a rude gesture is more entertaining than try-harding the rest of match.

I stay in red rank stupid

if you refer to them as monsters you dont play enough to be entitled to call for nerfs.

see you on /gatekeeping btw

Any other tips or strategies

You forgot Open Handed to increase the distance where OoO works

You tried....

It's a launch code error, try reinstalling

Distressing is terrible on Legion. It greatly hinders your ability to get first hits with Feral Frenzy.
---

---
Franklin's demise.  Got it in the shrine, figured someone like Freddy or pig would be even worse with it
---
This kinda sucks if i'm honest :/ hope BHVr buff Legion a little some day
---
They can’t. He’s way too late in development to do anything about because BHVR apparently didn’t ask anybody to test him months ago.
---
Alreadt did that doesnt work and a lit of others are having the same problem .-.
---
That only happens on "bad" ranks, you have not experienced almost anything of the game but you have a formed opinion, nice
---
I second this
---
I laughed at this more than I should've. Also my head hurts now.
---
I agree it’s weird but in a lot of states in America the legal age of consent is 16, and it’s even lower in different countries. I don’t agree with it personally but it is legally allowed if the two of them dated.
---
Then I'll just say she is 40.
---
I mean, we could always do it the simple way. Every game you play full way through without a DC gives you X points to Cells. The Killer gets them for playing with a full 4 people, and the people get it for staying the entire time. No DCs. You give out 10 Cells per however many points you want to say, and each match gives you some arbitrary number of points that is low comparative to how you set the needed points. Very dedicated players will play more to get Cells, and casual players will enjoy the free cells as they continue playing.
---
I agree, it’s gross and weird but it’s not pedophilia.
---
The I shaped map on Autohaven Wreckers makes doing a 3 gen strat a piece of cake for the killer.
---
Good perks for Hag
---
**Make Your Choice** lets you quickly down survivors who unhook and set off a trap. Even if you don't get use from it much, once survivors know you have it they will greatly slow their rescue attempts or even cause them to hook-dive.
---
**Sloppy Butcher** causes survivors to stay injured for longer, which lets your low terror radius allow you to surprise them. Hag is the queen of getting random hits, so even if you don't follow up on a chase you still get value. They either have to spend a long time healing or get downed the next time they trigger a trap. 
---
I have a hit-and-run playstyle with Hag and this pretty complimentary to that.
---
**Monitor and Abuse** brings Hagatha from a sneaky 24m terror radius to an incredibly small 16m radius. The fluctuation of your heartbeat in and out of chases can confuse survivors and cause them to either panic and set off traps, or give them a false sense of security. 
---
**Haunted Grounds** can win games as Hag. After it pops, survivors all either panic or go super immersed. While this is active, slug to your heart's content and try to rack up as much damage as possible.
---
**Hex: Ruin** is kinda obvious, but Hag has extra totem protection making it even better. Instead of just putting your traps on the totem, put them around the paths to/from it to cut off survivors before they even see it or punish a survivor after they break it.
---
**Save The Best For Last** gains stacks very quickly as Hag, and her mobility and pressure mitigates the downside of hitting your obsession. The reason I like this perk on Hag is because it allows you to teleport to traps faster after a hit, leading to some near-instant downs.
---
**Nurse's Calling** lets you spook survivors who are healing by utilizing Hag's small terror radius. This can lead to an easy down or scare the survivor towards a trap. 
---
**Shadowborn** is a good quality of life perk for Hag, basically allowing for easier target acquisition after teleporting to a trap.
---
**Hag Addons**
---
My favorite straightforward combo is Range+Setting Time. I avoid the ones that increase the trap trigger radius because when you teleport to them, the survivor will be further away. Double range will let you have control over the whole map. Increased triggered trap duration addons can also be good as a budget range addon or for those cases when you're performing an action and can't port right away.
---
All of these perks are great on Spirit too for various reasons, except for possibly Monitor and Abuse. I have less experience with Spirit but my strongest build on her is a package deal. 
---
I use **BBQ and Chili**, **Make Your Choice**, **Surveillance**, and **Pop Goes The Weasel**.
---
You can switch PGTW or Surveillance for Ruin but that's up to your preference.
---
My playbook for Spirit is to hook a survivor, phase to someone spotted with BBQ on a gen, use PGTW on the gen and trigger Surveillance on it, chase the nearby survivor until the hooked survivor is rescued, rush to hook and down the Make Your Choice target ASAP, and rinse and repeat.
---
If you lose momentum, Surveillance lets you see where survivors likely are. The fewer gens that are left, the more effective PGTW becomes. If you have a decent map and play well you should just be constantly downing and hooking someone, or at least slowing the game down significantly with your map pressure.
---
**Spirit Addons**
---
My favorite duo is the green Movement Speed+Activation Time. The purple addon that gives a bit of everything is great, as well as the reappearance speed one. These are more up to preference as they're all solid options depending on your playstyle.
---
See auras, with the appropriate accessories. No, they can't be used on hatches
---
good boy
---
Well, then he goes and does productive stuff while you're busy chasing his friend. They've just traded you around. Nothing changes.
---
Thanks! I've always wanted to know, I always though they were useless
---
I’m Rank 1 with Legion right now. I run BBQ/Thanatophobia/Ruin/Sloppy Butcher. Key to Legion is getting as many people as injured as possible as fast you can then keep the hooks going. It sounds kind of generic but when you have the Survivors injured and hooked that when Legion is strongest. If you let them heal and reset you lose momentum and it becomes harder and harder to win the game. If they don’t heal it becomes extremely easy to punish them for being in a bad position. If they do heal it will will slow down the game to a crawl with Thanatophobia and Sloppy Butcher
---
walk up to person doing productive stuff.  press m1.  profit.  
---
they waste time healing.  if they don't heal, congrats! they might be doing shit but now they're 1 hit away from being downed. great!
---
playing killer is about time management and nothing else.  the more effectively you manage your time, the more you can do in less time = the less time survivors spend on gens.  if you need ruin to do that, you're not good.
---
Mate all killers need ruin at high ranks, otherwise they get gen dishes and the game ends in one chase. Happens too me all the time on any killer if I don’t have ruin on them. Nothing against good killers but it’s the state of the game ATM.
---
cool

They should also have to sit out. First DC? We all make mistakes. 3rd in 30 minutes? Stay disconnected for 1 hour.

Myers, not for the perks but because he's fun to play
---
I was born in December and graduated when I was eighteen, without failing a single year. It depends on your birthday and the schools starting time.
---
America isn't the only place in the world mate lmao. Lots of countries where 17 and 50 would be legal.
---
If killer is all about time management, don't you think that Ruin could help with that?
---
That's where I try to stay. I hit rank 1 (as killer because I'm a dogshit survivor) just for the achievement
---
This was me when a friend convinced me to buy BF3. I didn’t know friendly fire was a thing.
---
I turned a corner during a team Death match. Friendly came in full sprint. I got spooked and gunned him down. Mind you this was my very first match. I felt bad so I revived him. He was so salty, he killed me, revived me, then killed me again and t-bagged me. I stopped playing that day. It was an honest to god accident.
---
These builds make me think this is a meme.
---
I find it to be better than ruin. Gets people scared to do gens. Also allows you not to tunnel.
---
Dude that looks like Jared Padelicki
---
Agreed.
---
I think playing as killer is going to generate hate even if you lose. Survivors main reason for "reporting" is from slugging or anything they find an excuse for their loss. I got reported for "Semi camping" yesterday, I think it's a real bitch move though when they open a chat to talk trash post game and then report your comment to Sony. I did get a notice from Sony about the reports but I'm doing my part and reporting theirs as well since they can't handle a loss.
---
I remember someone telling me to get a crosshair in after game chat when I first started playing. Makes me laugh my ass off looking back at how bad I was.
---
what about the plague ):

Nope, just not a fan of rupaul's drag race! You're fine.

Age of consent under 18 needs you to be within a year of another and goes down to like 13 iirc
---
so a 15 year old can fuck a 14 year old, 15 year old or a 16 year old but not a 13, 17 or 18 year old

Thank you so so much for sharing, the art is absolutely amazing. So much work was put into these, one can tell.

I loved rafaeldeleon's works, with the superhero theme :) And OMG the GoT from jeremieroy - that's something incredible. Maybe one day we'll get a medieval theme based outfits :)
---
I would loooove to see the DBD Art book where you guys could put all those wonderful works. Digital ones are lovely, but the one in actual book would be so cool. 
---
Honestly, love and huge thanks to the whole Art department, you guys never cease to amaze &lt;3 Thank you.

Freddy you kidding he s tier baby
---
Yeah I'm not sure what they were trying to do, but it didn't work out for them.
---
They're going to completely rework him and give him a new power between the ptb and live build?
---
Ruin, bbq, whispers, nurses, iron maiden, and shadowborn are all worthwhile perks. Personally I run whispers iron maiden nurses and bbq. Put in the time to learn to aim, and she is the most fun of any killer by far.
---
The..... the PTB is the test.
---
I’ve had this same issue for a week or so now too, I’m on Xbox and I’m concerned my profile was corrupted and am losing all my progress lmaoooo
---
Useless
---
Big oof, the devs said they are looking into it but i wanna play right meowwww
---
Dude if you can’t even call them killers your opinion is literally invalid. 
---
Play the tutorial and learn at the very least the basics of the game before you call for nerds dude
---
Ah, the rank 20 game pass Xbox player
---
Somebody who was supposed to be portraying a singer/songwriter. Can you imagine somebody with a shriek like that singing you to sleep? xD
---
Dude I swear to god you and your SWF party were in my lobby a few hours ago, and I got two of you but you and the other one were talking major shit. I'm probably off my rocker but shit the entire build looks identical
---
Where you the legion I played against like 40 minutes ago asking my friend in post game chat why he didn’t bleed out during the chase?
---
Nah see you wait for your ds timer to run out and get hit. Then you leg it with lithe and instant heal duhh
---
I’m not sure why people dislike your comment so much. He obviously needs work, but people have been losing their minds over him since the moment he was released. If you think he’s garbage, that’s reasonable. Screaming &amp; kicking your feet constantly because they haven’t reprogrammed him immediately  seems silly.
---
I was playing solo maybe the others were swf but i was playing alone in that game
---
Literally me and my friend right now lol
---
It's true I feel this too. If it's leather face or a basement build my altruism just plummets and I focus on the objective. But like how fun can it be to get like 20k BP even with BBQ just to depip? Playstyles like that don't even reap the benefits of elongating the game or hooking people multiple times. I get the most fun in a chase so I can't imagine what basement dwellers or campers get out of this game. You can't really even get a 4k unless people are truly trying to die going for saves so it just baffles me like just learn how to play
---
Ohh my B, I misinterpreted what you said.
---
I'm level 47 on Titanfall 2 and I consistently get matched with and against players who are G50-100. That game needs more players desperately.
---
Looking at this at work rn lol
---
I usually spam it as Clown before killing then because he repeatedly stomps their head in adding insult to injury.
---
Survivor tears, so yummy. You can hide the chat if you don't want to see those comments
---
&gt;that sense of mystery basically but giving a terror radius at all takes from that experience
---
That's not even what I'm getting at. The "mystery" comes from what everyone (both the other survivors and the killer included) are doing at any given time (unless you can see them, obviously). Survivors aren't meant to know what everyone is doing all the time. That has nothing to do with the terror radius.
---
&gt;Just because it takes away from that experience doesn't mean it's automatically a bad thing. Balance on both sides is the main point of a game.
---
It is bad if it not only takes away the experience of the game, but completely breaks balance and breaks the game. SWF on voice comms is definitely not balanced at all. 
---
The rest of your post is literally just you whining about what killer mains do and do not complain about. That has nothing to do with SWF and how being on voice comms breaks the game. Half of those issues have to do with lag/host discrepancy and will hopefully change with dedicated servers; they are nowhere near as broken as SWF on voice comms is. Also, one issue with the game does not mean another issue is or is not valid to discuss and change/improve.
---
I mean it is aa a fellow survivor main really fucking annoying to be singled out just because you’re already injured and the killer doesn’t feel like putting the fort into getting anyone else. 
---
That’s all I’ll say. But the camping comment you already know is bs so let it roll off and just try not to let it affect you. You know it isn’t true, they are obviously just speaking out of anger and trying to lash out to feel better. 
---
I hold myself to a sort of code of conduct when I play killer, and I refuse to do the things I hate unless I’m absolutely certain the person deserves the scummy gameplay on my part. (If I see a survivor purposely trying to get others killed sort of thing or being 100% toxic) Not saying everyone should be by forcing myself to not tunnel a person who was just unhooked I’ve become a better killer. 
---
Anyways. Any one who has played me in a KYF would tell you I just outright refuse to face camp, will only proxy for a limited time and won’t do it close to hook, I proxy a wide zone around the hook. But every so now an then if I end up steam rolling a team that was just that bad or that unlucky I’ll get a similar comment/hate after the game. It always makes me laugh and yeah it’s annoying but if I feel really petty and they are super adamant about it I’ll clip the game and send it to them and say: “Show me where I camped and tunneled you or shut the fuck up already. You had a bad game, everyone doesn’t least once in a while, move on.” 
---
And I’m a Freddy Main so I get them a decent amount of the time despite never actually tunneling or camping.
---
Killer and survivor are entirely different roles that cannot be compared easily. Killer is 1 player that controls the game. But should not control a players experience. 
---
Ex. I just broke haunted ground 15 seconds into the game when the nurse just blinked at you and down you in 1 hit. Killer shack basement, great for you. The nurse just circles the shack for 2 minutes not allowing you to be saved, or just immediately downing and rebooking you before you can regain control of your character. 
---
You realistically had no control over your fate. You simply just lose. 
---
This alone is a huge cause for why ranks literally mean nothing and the game is not truly competitive. Let alone the terrible player experience on survivor end. 
---
As a killer if I were to fail the trial and displease the entity I would know it was my own poor playing that led to that cause. Because I as the killer control the game. If I cut loops better made less mistakes and watched gens more carefully I couldve at least killer 2 survivors every time which is a decently satisfactory end for new to average players.
---
It’s funny how it’s always hillbillies that do those moves
---
What the hell have you brought upon this cursed land ?
---
Lmao exactly. He's not even live yet and there's a reason he's not. He's in the ptb because he needs to be T-E-S-T-E-D. It honestly doesn't matter to me how many people dislike my comment because I stand by it regardless. People have been throwing a fit about how BHVR created a useless killer and its unfair blah blah blah since the DAY he came out on ptb but they haven't necessarily released him if you can't play him in a regular match soooo
---
All survivors are legal adults, so ours is an alternative reality version of her that's older.
---
legal age doesn't really define pedophilia tho, i assume you mean legality
---
I mean, yeah, that's what i play(BBQ, Brutal Strength, Surveillance &amp; Overcharge/STBFL). It works, but still gotta deal with that 50% chance to get a trap of on first box
---
I main Legion, Hag, and Trapper (and Dwight). I mainly play with a controller (even on PC), so I am limiting my reaction ability. 
---
Hag is great for a laid back game. You can use a controller as the chases are usually smaller after you place good traps (see Space Coconut for advice). Usually 2 gens get done prior to putting down all your traps, but you can use that to set up a great web. Just keep putting down traps. 
---
Trapper is a different kind of hag. There are many less traps, but the traps are a lot more satisfying. Don’t expect to win with Trapper, just have fun with the Snap sounds. 
---
Legion is harder with controller, but still fun. Use the mobility to your advantage. Also, don’t be afraid to hit an injured (but not deep wounded) survivor so you can locate all the Blendettes (P3 hidden Claudette’s). As others said, keep everyone injured as much as possible.
---
eh idk as the other person said you could sandbag teammates and piss them off to make them dc too so it's a difficult thing to implement
---
I don't have a problem with streamers. The whole reason I'm playing this game is because I spent so much time watching people have fun playing this game. Ya'll streamers taught me a lot about how to suck less as a noob.
---
True
---
I wouldnt be mad
---
Underrated.
---
Nah, it’s fine, I really shouldn’t use “went down” like that in a game where being downed is an actual thing.
---
Old meme, good point
---
Or addons.
---
It does. It would be awesome if you could have your own PlayStation theme though.
---
This kind of depends on the killer. That is why it is hard to make a definitive tier list. Really needs to be catered toward specific killers. 
---
For example, tinkerer is deadly with Billy, Nurse, and Mint Rag Hag. Lower tier on most others as they are not fast enough to take advantage of it (though they can get lucky being close enough). 
---
Fearful Fright is godly with Nurse, but low tier on most others. 
---
Unnerving presence is low tier, except on Doc. 
---
Stridor is amazing on Spirit who relays on sounds more than other killers. 
---
Bamboozle is near pointless on Hag, but can be good on other M1 killers.
---
Considering you're not even attempting to argue against my points anymore and saying stuff like "I don't see why most killers keep their mouths shut about" stuff, "since you can't manage that I guess this is where the conversation ends", and "because it obviously isn't worth my time", yeah, I'd say you're whining. 
---
&gt;And if u want to say it's "because I can't defend against your points" don't worry, it's not. I didn't even read anything past the "whining" part because it obviously isn't worth my time.
---
So... you're not even attempting to defend against my points, then, much less actually read my argument. 
---
&gt;Btw when I said before "it's not about communication", I was saying when I play with my friends, it's not the communication we play for at all.
---
What you play for is completely irrelevant. The fact of the matter is, being able to communicate directly in DBD is flat out broken.
---
I wanted to up vote but I will leave the up vote counter at 666 because DBD
---
I haven't experienced this, what are you talking about?
---
I stopped playing when they added Legion because they broke sounds for killer and *added Legion*. I came back when they added Plague because hey that's kind of neat she's basically Vomitbilly without the vroomy vroomy and sounds are better now, I guess, and oh look they nerfed DS. I stopped playing when they added Ash because hey look they just replaced DS with super-DS and it became immediately obvious that they only nerfed DS to make room for MoM and sell DLC.
---
I don't know if I'll start playing again when the MoM nerfs go live. I'm probably deranked all the way by this point, and I was never super amazingly great to begin with, so either I'm gonna get actual noobs and they're gonna have a shit game or I'm gonna get the vets who've stubbornly stuck with it and I'm gonna have a shit game. Why put myself through that?
---
Also Ghostface is a joke. I was kind of hype, but he blows. It's painfully clear at this point that BHVR don't know the first thing about the game they're making and every good thing they've ever done is either a complete accident or them caving to community pressure (Coldwild tiles). Following this game is painful. The core gameplay is surprisingly fun for what is basically competitive ring around the rosie, so you *want* it to be good, but it just isn't. It really isn't. The game is fun in spite of its flaws, and BHVR isn't learning enough about the game as they go to fix those flaws, or even stop adding more.
---
I think I might be bitter. Just a bit.
---
Idk, maybe. I'm not sure since I don't play her. But considering she's an M1 killer most of the time in a chase, I'd say STBFL is good for her too.
---
Premonition. When working on gens it gives me enough time to hide from the killer and also keeps me from going the wrong direction.
---
Thanks for the head up tho really appreciated it
---
10 to 15 minutes?
---
Downvoted for being right. Good job reddit /s
---
Prob is that this is extremely exploitable
---
That's awesome! That's the kind of shit that makes me love the game!
---
Haven’t watched it for years. Is it worth watching now?
---
Note: We did see Trixie Mattel in her live comedy show after watching the “Trixie and Katya” show on Viceland.  We didn’t even know that she was on Drag Race. There were a bunch of jokes that were I guess from the Drag Race show.
---
Wait.. people still post actual gameplay on here?! Take my upvote!
---
May be easier after the rework. I imagine his main power used will be tea bagging. I believe the Devs will nerf Nurse before they nerf that power.
---
First Myers, then Ace.
---
Hopefully or I’m gonna have to hope survivors don’t accidentally see me
---
Why protecting the chest? I thought it was just a meme but killers actually do this?
---
*AGHgRa*
---
Incidentally Iridescent King has a few unlisted effects. It can make the fake doctors visible as auras in tier 2, and make a survivor aura be revealed when they tier up. 
---
I sort of wish Doc had the most Ultra-Rares in the game. Like Ultra Rare versions of Calm to tremendously effect the terror radius, if only so I can combine it with the very rare calm addon and turn into Dr. Galaxywide instead of just Dr. Worldwide. Jigsaw piece too for maximum fun. Ultra Rares for all Carters Notes addons, and maybe rework Maple Knight (Doctor can see where shock lands) into something more useful.
---
Forcing someone to DC in order to exit the game is the only meaning of holding a game hostage. 
---
Anything else is fabricated and they’re butthurt.
---
It’s not. It’s just being a prick
---
No. I just usually see more build up.
---
Maybe they thought you were speed hacking because the nurse is so slow? That’s the best retarted reason I can come up with.
---
Could also be the disconnect bug I'm seeing a lot, although I don't know if it happens much on console. A dumb reason to DC if not, why take the perk if you're going to rage quit when the totem is destroyed? It's gonna happen in almost every match you play in lol.
---
Same for me today, except it was two people that tea bagged and 1 played normal. The last survivor dc’d because he got hit once in the first minute.
---
I'm going to have to disagree with that. It is incredibly hard to get an unhook against a revved up camping leatherface even if you're a great survivor. I also play killer as well and don't really struggle with gen rushing survivors because I stick with Killers that play to my strengths. Gen rushing is part of the game mechanics and there are ways to work around it. Even Bubba can stop gen rushing if he's a good enough killer. The issue I see is that you get people who suck with him and try to stick with it out of sheer stubbornness when he is obviously the worst killer. People say Freddy is the worst but I've gone against Freddy's that can even destroy SWF's.
---
ENG was made to prevent that, so no
---
Understandable
---
Get to 14 or 15 at least and try to stay there or higher. You can usually find matches really quick. There are not as many SWF teams there as there are at 16+. (For some reason, Survive with Friends tends to pair killer with the lowest rank in the SWF team, so I was typically going against red ranked survivors when I was 16+)
---
If you get to rank 8, you start getting more sweaty survivors and longer loading times. 
---
I found the 10-14 range was the best for avoiding repeated toxic survivors while still getting into games quickly.
---
I do run it. Its just shes not an "M1" killer, but she is still an M1 killer, you know, like Evan
---
Bunna definetely is B tier
---
Nope.  Neither is slugging all 4 and then jerking it to their tears.
---
I hope you got a dozen hooks on that one.
---
Ahh i see you too are an oink of oink
---
It doesn’t matter if someone’s down while the timer’s ticking, the match WILL end either way. Even if it’s slowed down, that doesn’t mean it’ll stop entirely. I don’t know what lies they are feeding you, but they’re pansies that sound like they also can’t handle a loss when they’re killed by The Entity when they can’t escape due to Blood Warden.
---
You have no idea how much better the game you for me lol
---
No.
---
No PC lol it was funny because we could have had 2 people escape but last minute Ash decided to be a hero and got killed. I could tell he was salty because he refused to die on the hook while I butt danced over the hatch.
---
Good ol’ Joey
---
Oink gonna yOINK you off
---
You can only dribble DS if it's at 9 o'clock. Even if you could, you take one step with the new DS. You gonna always down the person unhooked four steps from a hook? Come on.
---
Let me preface this all as: we are playing Wraith. Not Nurse, not Billy, not Spirit. Good old basic Wraith. 
---
"Well you shouldn't go after them", and this now brings me to your misconception about Borrowed Time. You want to see how a good team uses Borrowed Time? You hook someone, start moving to a generator, and they unhook while you're \~8m from hook. "Well they probably have borrowed, let's go for the unhooker". Here's the thing, that Borrowed Time player will attempt to bodyblock for you. If they are successful, are you going to chase after the healthy-state player or the injured player? So you go for the Borrowed Time player, who also probably has DS in this situation. You down them, and let's say you are actually dumb enough to pick them up: they DS, and now have the potential for Mettle to be activated. 
---
This situation isn't even cosmic, just the groups that are effective at this strategy are rare. Magnificent Seven's group does this very well, Enaraia's as well. This by the way, doesn't even talk about Unreakable, where they pop back up because you don't want to, no, CAN'T,  play into DS.
---
"Well just leave the hook and go get generator pressure", ah yes and this brings us to the OP. Let me go cross map, ignoring two players who are now going to go work generators, and hope that the generator I'm going to doesn't finish by the time I'm there. THIS is where Ruin is valuable. THIS is why you can get away with not running it on Nurse/Billy/Hag. THIS is why it exists. The amount of time it takes to cross a large amount of maps, even as Wraith, makes generating generator pressure (no pun intended) difficult. Ruin helps with this. 
---
And to u/SameAssGrybe, you hit it right on the head. These perks exist as an answer to game design being at fault.
---
Please note that rank does currently matter for game loading times. If you are higher in rank, it can take longer to load matches. This is why red ranks purposefully DC to depip. They want to get to lower ranks to get quicker and more diverse matches.
---
Newcomers: Am I a joke to you?
---
It's not "holding the game hostage" per se since it's at the EGC, but it is toxic behavior. This happened to me recently; instead of hooking, they dropped me in front of one and M1'd at me until the timer ran out (at least half the time remaining), then wrote "HAHAHAHAHAHA" in the post-game chat.
---
Yeah, his power should be shut down by kicking him in the bollocks and then glassing him with a bottle.
---
Yeah, I held out for as long as I could solely because my team knew it was smarter to finish the gens rather than save me. They legit finished a gen right next to him and he didn't move an inch lmao.
---
Ok... so if Kenneth is alcoholic from his drug problem, surely Amanda must be up there too
---
When the Reddit comment is mean to my epic post ok shut up!!!!
---
It is just a meme really. Lol. But there is a legit basement bubba strat.
---
I played Bubba once and decided never again. I legit use BP from my hag matches to rank him up for BBQ&amp;chili
---
Also Huntress
---
Tea lmfao time to have a drama news network for Dead by Daylight lore
---
I agree to a degree, if you play normally, do your gens, chase  the killer around a bit it should be a guaranteed Safety pip. Doing absolutely nothing and not touching a gen, chasing the killer or anything at all shouldn't reward you a pip
---
It’s fun for the killer mostly because of people getting mad and upset about it.
---
No. It's not holding the game hostage as the game is still moving, it is however, a dick move, just hook them unless they deserve it
---
actually nurse is an m1 killer, despite being correct that her power helps her in chases she downs survivors exclusively through m1s (left clicks) after the blink rather than the blink itself killing. m1 killer refers to killers that cant down with their power in the middle of a chase.
---
for example non m1 killers include Leatherface (chainsaw), Hillbilly (chainsaw), huntress (hatchets), and Plague (corrupt/red vomit, although you could argue she is an m1 killer because she usually downs with green into an m1)
---
the rest of the killers are m1 killers because they revolve around left click attacks to down.
---
trappers arguably a non-m1 killer because his traps are lethal without requiring an m1 if he can walk up to the trapped survivor and hit space, but only very situationally and with setup.
---
Don’t forget Franklin’s Demise since you can trap the item that Survivors dropped. This works even better with Save The Best For Last as this’ll SAVE you more time.
---
I don't play for bloodpoints though I play to win matches lol
---
Original
---
Most killers go towards gens when they're done, especially if he's close to one that just popped. If I'm close to a killer and a gen pops I get 10secs to disappear without a trace. Or if I'm doing gens, killers usually go towards gens when they pop if they're close, see scratch marks and track down survivors, but with Poised, I'm long gone with no trace.
---
My explanation for why not is simple, survivors already have an advantage at higher ranks and bt is one of the top tier perks in its current state even requiring a perk slot.
---
Your explanation (which i might add i had to read through your unorganized random replies to other comments to identify rather than seeing you actually explain in the post)) hinges on mitigating camping, in which ill say it doesnt. Not one bit. If people camp this just makes them camp harder. any killer can already permanently camp a hook using the grab interrupt mechanic to instadown any surv who tries to unhook. Bt doesnt help against this.
---
There's no logic in applying a hefty survivor buff for no reason, and your listed reasoning doesn't apply.
---
Right. I actually see that bug. It is usually preceded by some weird events like not being able to interact with anything for 20 seconds.
---
What do you mean is it worth watching now? All the seasons are good except season 1 and season 1 in All Stars.
---
plus, in the picture it shows 10 killers, not 8 lmao
---
With the right build (bond etc.) you may not need Self Care, but as a killer it's hard to determine how it's impacting the game. Being healed by a teammate is always better, but even top ranking survivors (many of whom play SWF and can therefore locate each other to heal effortlessly saving a perk slot for Self Care *and* bond or empathy) run it, which says a lot about its usefulness.
---
Too bad I can’t get any of my friends to play DBD on PC with me.
---
With the new Halloween (2018) there are now 4 major timelines.
---
Original: Halloween 1+2 &amp; 4-6 (#3 is a spin off without Myers).
---
Reboot: 1+2 &amp; H20 + Resurrection
---
Remakes: Rob Zombies Halloween 1 &amp; 2
---
2nd Reboot: Halloween 1 and Halloween (2018), plus the sequel that is in development. 
---
There are lots of dropped plotlines, and one does involve the (implied) child of Myers and Jaime (daughter of Laurie, Halloween 6). None that I recall imply a relationship between Laurie and Michael directly. Generally that the two are siblings, and Michael is out to kill his remaining family members. Laurie does kiss Michael (Resurrection) but it isn't really in a romantic way.
---
Just stopped watching and never really picked it back up. Haven’t really heard much about it since as I mostly watch things on YouTube and other non-cable shows now. Wasn’t sure if it was still good or if it suffered from one-too-many seasons and only worth viewing highlight clips.
---
Honestly just good timing. Didn't even realize when you commented, just had happened to come out of the shower.
---
2 rage-quitting killers downvoted this post :)
---
I don't see the point in taking Enduring or Spirit Fury on the Spirit. One of her major perks is that she doesn't need to take pallets head on and can play around them. The only killer who can do that better than the Spirit is the Nurse and maybe Huntress and Hag.
---
*Hey Listen*
---
It’s a game about killing... and people complain about dying. It’s honestly a shame. Let killers camp. Can’t handle it? Don’t play. 
---
“Stop getting mad because people don’t play the way YOU want them to play”
---
Couldn’t say it better myself

As a hardcore lover for Trapper, I tend to get flamed hard at the end of the match if I end up doing well (if I dont get asylum that is)
---
Hey Dwight, what's going on there big guy? It's not my fault you went into the basement, got hooked, got rescued then I catch you and your mate off guard. Those beartraps? They handle like a juicy miyata, almost like a Toyota 2006. 
---
But yeah, basement game is MINE.
---
Opposed to a game where the killer closes the hatch and one survivor has to open an exit game within a less than 3 minute period of time where the killer knows where both gates are and can monitor them to see which one is being opened? 
---
And if he camps both gates, he gets a free kill?
---
I don’t think this is a huge wrench in a killer’s plans when it takes up a perk slot for a survivor and has to meet specific conditions to be used in the first place. (Being the last remaining survivor and having the hatch closed and endgame started, on top of even finding the damn thing)
---
As a way out of shape Legion main, I can confirm this particular issue does not ruin my immersion at all
---
Seems pretty solid can you heal prettiest with autodidact ? 
---
And does that solidarity come in handy often? I'm interested in your build as I'm making a medic build myself :)
---
Campers are just killers that are shit at chases. You'd know because if you try to rescue and get spotted, they'd chase you for like 2 secs and run back to the hook, because they know they'll take forever to catch you and by then the hooked survivor would've been rescued and long gone.
---
That’s on you mate
---
Sad. I don’t rage quit. I still want the points. 
---
If it is that bad, I will just put down the controller and go get a snack or drink to clam down while the game is still on. Either that or go to the bathroom and take a Meg.
---
Remove basement blocking for killer and picking up a survivor while unhooking. Killers can hit the survivor and interrupt them but not just pick them off during a save. Without those 2 things will finally be fair. Killers have bloodlust and that's the most overpowered mechanic ive ever seen. I honestly cant believe it exists but I swallow it.
---
These are so cool!
---
R2
---
Doesn't need buffs? :thinking:
---
I've seen plenty of survivors have fun in game when I'm killer, or when killers play fair. I see this more from red rank killers. They'll go apply pressure to gens when someone is hooked and when you rescue they'll make their way back and track you down with a perk, usually nurses, and when they find survivors they hit the healthy one, then have a chase, hook and repeat. This way everyone gets a fighting chance, everybody gets to put their skills to the test and both sides have fun and get lots of points. There is fun to the game. Campers just show how selfish they are and how bad at the game they are.
---
If you don’t have the perks, LeatherFace. 
---
BBQ is one of the best locator perks in the game and the bloodpoint bonus is a near requirement. 
---
Franklins drops pesky toolboxes, flashlights, instagrams, and keys. It can break a toxic SWF squad’s plans. You may even get a quick down if they try to go for the dropped tool after getting hit. 
---
Knockout is great for non-SWF matches. Really can allow you to snowball. Not as good in SWF.
---
Whatever you say man. 
---
Don’t like it then don’t play.
---
Survivor mains can still be baby killers.  I never called you a killer main.  Most of us play both sides.  If you are in here to support insidious camping as a fun playstyle for the other side you are most certainly a babykiller.

Jesus before Huntress? If I have anymore questions I will be sure to ask the subreddit. I also have played for a good amount of time (Pretty sure before Curtain Call chapter) but I am far from a veteran. I literally had to look up what tunneling was earlier today. I had stopped playing the game for a while and I recently got back into it.
---
I get laughes out of pallet stuns. A lot of the killers are like the same oof if you get what I mean. Pig is cute, wraiths is scary but huntress is like pissed
---
Talking about the basement + insidious camp trap, then:
---
  
---
Because any of the following reasons:  
---
1- It brings results. hook -&gt; insidious -&gt; survivor walk in -&gt; easy kill
---
2- Trolling for salt reactions.
---
3- May indeed not be a good chaser.
---
4- Because they can. The tools are there. and it's a very efficient set up. so it's hard to resist not using it at least once. Just like how it's fun to try out different builds with different killers.
---
Being chased by the hill-billy or spirit is really not fun for me. Doesn't justify me complaining and DCing from game.  
---
Suck it up sometimes you lose sometimes you win.
---
Spirit's great for her gameplay and perks.  
---
Myres is good for his gameplay and Laurie's perks OoO and DS.  
---
Pick whoever you think is more fun.
---
Killer has been terifying these last few nights on pc. Rank 12 killer, and nonstop swf's that have  guys in  red ranks.
---
The BHVR team helped make it, so it is sort of a copy and sort of not.
---
I do like the unique abilities for survivors in the game. One person has a gun. 
---
The killers don’t have to be humanoid either. 
---
The grind is much better, IMO as unlocking a perk for one killer/survivor unlocks it for all.
---
I have Laurie already but haven’t leveled her up cause I got her DS in The Shrine Of Secrets 
---
And Spirit Seems Good But Whenever I think of playing her I don’t think I have enough IQ points to kill people without seeing them lol
---
Be Myers, convince everyone that you want to farm, 1gen done, 2 gen done... Pop infinite tombstone, enjoy the salt.
---
Yep. Especially when playing on PC with a controller.
---
Was gonna say
---
I think they did once. 
---
Don’t count on it though.
---
Wonder who made this lol.
---
Yo you forgot to censor his name
---
The fixes that I would put on ghost lad to turn him into a ghost MAN would be:
---
- make his ability function regardless of survivor's LOS. (His channel would only reset if he loses LOS on a surv for a certain amount of time)
---
- exposed lasts longer (probably a base of 20 or 30 seconds, add-ons would obviously extend it)
---
- no noise when entering stealth mode (like c'mon, what's the point of stealth then?)
---
- *maybe* a possible extra ability that truly seperates him from an M1 killer. (Probably not cause if the exposed status worked as intended, it would be hard to add more without going overboard)
---
Billy, Amanda, and Legion should be higher.
---
Technically it isn't I suppose. since the match will end eventually. but it's a dick move unless if you just never saw the sacrifice animation and just want to see it firsthand, I would not mind that.
---
It may stink for the survivor, but I don’t see them go for the other Gens when they have one at 99%. (Unless they are SWF and waiting to proc adrenaline for a toxic move). 
---
You do what you want to do. If that is going after the injured person, then do it. They shouldn’t unhook next to you without Borrowed Time. Also, if the unhooked survivor runs toward you by accident, you should take advantage.
---
He did drink though. "Old Gin Bottle."
---
Because now you're forced to cycle through the store to look at the shrine. It's like advertising.
---
SERIOUSLY.
---
he is in the lower half of killers in all honesty
---
Not always the case (I speak from personal experience and watching others. If the gates are open, DS virtually guarantees escape after an unhook. If you slug they have 60 seconds to crawl to the gate and if you pick them up they'll just DS and escape. It was much stronger before but I think it should be stronger again in a more targeted way.
---
Yeah, I think people were thinking I was talking about using him perkless or something, he's not a hard killer to do well with if you learn the chainsaw, which doesn't take that long. Good Billies are terrifying, not to the same extent add Nurse, but it doesn't take nearly as long to do well with him.
---
Not from what I seen. You must have really polite toxic players.
---
Then they end their frenzy and if its a girl you hear "AUGH AUG AUGHHHAH"
---
Eh... it varies..

The Game: "Am I a joke to you?"
---
What? Are you saying that killer add-ons are a requirement?  
---
I agree if you're talking about specific killers, but for most of them it isn't necessary.
---
Can you give a concrete example?
---
Killers: Survivors need to leave the game immediately after opening the gates it's so toxic to make us wait.
---
Also Killers: Just wait it's not that long.
---
I like your idea, but I think the problem with vicinity is that a nurse (the strongest killer) can teleport away then back in a relatively short amount of time and continue to tunnel the survivor. I think that the strongest killer shouldn't have the special privilege of ignoring perks like this while the weaker killers like Freddy and Cannibal suffer the most from it.
---
I’m not bashing the killer. It’s not “entitlement” it’s an opinion.
---
So is camping and tunneling
---
I honestly love doing that shit. Run calm so they already get confused about terror radii, and once they get hit by it once, they won't trust a single illusion.
---
Yeah I agree.  People who are great with Billy aren't very common, but it's pretty laughable for someone to say "good survivors will win against billy almost everytime", I'm pretty mediocre with him and probably 80% of my games I get 3ks or 4ks.
---
I believe he’s saying that killers NEED add ons to play well.
---
That’s fair. How about then, Inside a killers terror radius it’s 60seconds, outside of the terror radius it’s 30? Like the timer is slowed if your in a chase with the killer so you have more time, but it goes faster if not
---
Either the shrine or from the survivor itself as a teachable(DS from Laurie).
---
Maybe he's from Alabama and he wants you to Kiss Your Sister.
---
Rank 20 in a nutshell.
---
That is a bit extreme. Instead of “can’t (repair/heal” it would be more like “takes 20 seconds to charge the ability to start (repair/heal)”
---
Yes, most killers are heavily add-on dependent. Survivors can easily go without add-ons or any carried parts and do fine.
---
shrine or leveling up laurie
---
That's exactly it! Huh. Guess it's broken on dead hard too. For some reason it does not effect sprint burst. Lithe and sprint burst are the only two I tested it on.
---
But teabaging is just like emoting after a kill in tf2, facecamping is ruining fun, do something bm in return like when killers nod or hit a survivor on hook is like teabaging or flashlight spamming.
---
Will i be able to get it from laurie to dwight
---
On a second read... True, is that what this person is saying. Thanks for the explanation, someone just downvote my comment and left
---
Yeah I was gonna say 10-15 is a bit much. She would have found and closed the hatch by then...
---
You’re right, I’m not wrong. DS is fine as is, it’s useless half the time, it’s a high risk high reward perk. It used to be OP, now it’s balanced.
---
Yes. You can put any perk on any survivor if you unlock their teachables.
---
I think the timer should should slow to a crawl (1/2 speed) in a chase, and then resume normally. I still think that the perk deactivating if the killer hits other survivors twice is a good deactivation rule because it prevents the killer from downing the unhooker in 1 hit and then immediately downing the unhooked player but also rewards the killer for dividing their focus rather than tunneling.
---
Either u can get it from the shrine or reach level 40 with Laurie to unlock the teachable perk
---
Do you know how to get a teachable perk? for example, leveling up meg to lvl 40, on the meg bloodweb will appear adrenaline, if you unlock that, then adrenaline will appear in other survivors boodwebs. Teachable perks appears on lvl 30, 35 and 40
---
Im all for adding new objects in maps that allow for hiding. Just please no more indoor maps
---
With DS now going away after 60 seconds, the really good survivors tend not to have the perk proc except when they do it intentionally as bait. 
---
I don’t really find it to be that much of a problem anymore. I recommend slugging in those cases. It still slows down the game. If it is the endgame, then yeah, it is a possible escape, but Blood Warden and NOED are also possible kills, so both sides have a get-out-of-jail card perk they can use. 
---
DS can be clutch, but it is not used as much anymore and I don’t really see that many end game uses.
---
I would honestly just be happy if they somehow made it so that max of 2 survivors can run any one obsession perk per game.  Like have survivors pick a 5th perk as a back up and flip a coin for who gets DS
---
Thanks
---
Huntress is definitely the most upset when it comes to pallet stuns. Trapper sounds like he hit a traffic jam, clown sounds like he stubbed his toe while drunk
---
Hello I work for whoever made Dead By Daylight I will take $5,000 now and it will get into game.
---
Whoa, awesome!
---
If the killer is playing like shit until NOED then survivors shouldn't have too much of an issue at the end of the game. What purpose do survivors have to remain at this stage of the game besides to open exit gates and leave? Chances are people who are downed by NOED probably deserve it.
---
Bc she's mentally a child and basically is having a temper tantrum lol
---
Self Care is literally a 100% time efficient perk(you waste more time running around the map with bond trying to get someone to heal you) that is near mandatory for solo play. There's a good reason it has the kind of pickrate it does, it's just that strong. It annoys me when I play with people who deliberately don't take it because people like say it's a shit perk. Just makes the team much much weaker.
---
you are truly dumb af
---
Ah I see you’re a man of culture as well
---
Damn balance landing for killers would be awesome
---
Without using a mori, it takes so long to kill your obsession that by the time they're dead it want get much use. If it affected the amount of time it takes to open exit gates it might be better, but there are just other perks that do the same job better. There are just so many better perks you can use. Especially because the Spirit already has one of the best applications Sloppy Butcher due to how easy it is for her to hit survivors.
---
Using a corrupted fountain makes her vomit instadown.
---
If you select a survivor and then you press F1 the game will show you info of that character, you can see what teachable perks have everyone of them, same with killers
---
I think it should be a bit more niche (so it's not just a "you can't hook me for 60 seconds" card) but more powerful.
---
I saw three end game uses today, two in a stream and one that I ran into personally. All three allowed the survivor to escape.
---
People...ship them? Maybe im not that active in the community but the only ship I knew about was Dwight and David 😭
---
What you're suggesting sounds nice but also impossible.
---
&gt; near mandatory for solo play
---
I never run it and all I play is solo but okay
---
Personally, I waste more time using it than I save using it, it just doesn’t fit my play style.
---
If the killer is that bad, you probably wouldn't get evader points efficiently anyways. Best to just get a new match.
---
No I disagree. Make it 2500. Damn leavers.
---
Rank 15’s be like:
---
The killer probably wasn't good enough to get you a fun chase anyway. Probably better to find a new match.
---
You made some good points and suggestions.
---
DS is still quite the pain in the ass. Like you said, the perk is basically hook immunity for 60 seconds. That's pretty damn strong. 
---
It allows for survivors to make reckless plays. 
---
I'm in agreement with you that the perk needs to be toned down. For me, DS should prevent the survivor from immediately being hooked again after just getting unhooked. 
---
Once the survivor is freed from the hook and is out of immediate danger, DS shouldn't really have any effect at this point.
---
True true I guess
---
Overcharge and pop goes should be higher in my opinion
---
I’ve literally run into several dead ends on that map. It sucks, the pallets are hard to see (even though they’re safe) and it’s very easy to get cornered. Crappy map for both sides, it needs some sort of revamp I think.
---
I had a guy tell me that No mither was to OP and that’s why he tunneled me in the first 2 minutes of the game.
---
Dude, StBfT is AWESOME on Pig.  Ambushing a survivor for a free hit and then being immediately up their ass again in 2 seconds flat is such a useful ability, it turns her from a basic bitch m1 killer into a quasi insta-downer since survivors have no time to look for cover or get to loops like they normally could after an ambush.  Turns a free first hit into a discount second hit.
---
I dont know how i would respond that statement besides asking Bhvr to ban him so he cant spreas his stupid.
---
I’ve literally run into several dead ends in that map. It’s extremely easy to get cornered too, just with how the map layout is. It’s a shitty map for both sides, it definitely needs some sort of revamp for pallet spawns and random generation.
---
Yeah, I'm gay teen, buddy, I know. That's why I don't want to compare the two. It's bad enough we get stereotyped as being pedos from some 1950s bullshit.
---
And like... don't you think its weird to be attracted to teenagers? Like I don't know your age but assuming you're an adult yourself...
---
What is it about a teenager that you can't get from someone your own age, other than the fact that they look more like kids? Saying that you like blondes or tall people would be a preference. Wanting to fuck a kid is a paraphelia and a fucking gross one at that.
---
Age of consent in most us states is 16/17.
---
Sometimes I just want to fuck survivors as hard as I can. Thats not wrong.
---
So survivors actually would get points by being near the hooked survivor or feinting rescues, making the original point moot.
---
I miss not having the screen one giant orange color
---
You have a different definition of "most". There are 16 killers, there's no chance that at least nine of them are just fine without addons. There are killer tiers for a reason - because only the strong killers have a good enough base. And there are not nine strong killers.

Legion is my main. I float around rank 9 and it’s pretty easy for me to get a 4k with him.
---
I'm mainly referring to rank 1 as that's where I play. Also I lower ranks tend to have skewed killer rankings. I'd actually say that some of the lower tier killers are some of the best at low ranks.
---
I didn’t respond because I think I would be wasting my time and thoughts on someone with no brain, lol very true.
---
Honestly, loved Legion before rework and also after. Still love Legion to this day. I 4k with my Susie 9 outta 10 games. It's also fun to run Franklin's on a Squadette and Toxic Nea group. 
---
Just gotta know how to use Legion correctly. Sorry, not sorry, but get good 😉😁
---
Honestly, I wouldn't mind a killer who could jump in the air and divebomb survivors, kinda like an up to 3s at base hover, with a nurse reticle for the landing.
---
Tell me about, same 3 killers, a Huntress if your lucky
---
I don’t dc but he is absolutely the most boring killer to go against. Like okay go into frenzy, take your first hit and force the mend, a lot of rinse and repeat
---
And then their teammate's expect you to farm
---
I like a lot of different killers, but the issue is that the perks I want for them are on different killers. Like bamboozle, enduring, and spirit fury for myers
---
The Clown.
---
His real name is Kenneth Chase.
---
Fun for the killer
---
Dude I hope you reported that gamer guy
---
Please do ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Disgustang*
---
He's not even officially released yet calm down.
---
But (IIRC) Amanda beat her drug addiction.
---
Instead of sticking needles in herself she cuts herself.
---
Heck so I was right on how it was spelled my friend is a liar
---
This is why if ANY survivor escapes the match, the others should get a small BP payout.
---
 I thought this was something for paint the town red at first glance, then i saw what the chatacters/ subreddit were
---
I've posted about this before. Slightly/moderately/considerably don't mean anything.
---
Now that's fashion
---
So buff No Mither with an extra health state? Seems excessive.
---
Deal now i just need your credit card info so i know where to send
---
I just looped a Leatherface for four gens and got Insidious camped to death. I wanted to kill myself on hook and move on to the next game because that play style is brain dead and unfun, but I said fuck it and made him sit through two full hook stages. Feelsgoodman
---
Or something, yes. Maybe a sliding scale based on time in game
---
imma keep it real with you chief. The entirety of reddit is not in america
---
Yeah, I heard there is a scene for collecting these masks by Fun World. Do you own any of them?
---
It’s not real lol, just a thought
---
well they did so.... (shrug)
---
That’s even worse now.
---
Offerings will carry over, any event currency gained will not
---
If your friend joins out of luck then thats just lucky. The killer disconnecting is fine but its still a possibility that someone will farm. If you are part of a SWF  and you leave. Only the other people will get the bonus and not your other teammates.  Any sort of mechanic that rewards player for someone else doing something that may be bad but is very easy to do opens up farming potential. Imagine a automatic bot like AFKERS that make a SWF and leave? What if 3 bots leave every match and you get points. It's a request that would make more problems
---
its not even his smh
---
Is GF consider a chapter? If so then the next chapter would be chapter 13, really hoping Jason could get added because it's the 13th chapter. But there is that legal thing going on, so if GF is not considered a chapter then maybe we still have time to sort out the legal thing or is that something that's gonna take years?
---
Wouldn't that be impossible how would he carry people and put them on hooks
---
Ikr
---
Definitely the worst meme on here.  what suprises me more is that someone actually thought this was funny and upvoted it
---
If this was real, I’d make him be able to switch between big and small
---
And his weapon would be a gun
---
Question: why would a killer want to open the doors? In what situation is this beneficial for the killer?
---
Wtf that sounds ridiculous haha
---
That’d be sick to just bodyblock as a 1 foot tall doll lmao
---
You tellin me a group of edgy Canadian teenagers aren't drinkers?
---
I really like the shading style, nice job!
---
Oof i don’t think Jason would ever get added to the game, it’d be a fucking miracle if he did though. I don’t know what his power would be either,
---
are you sure this is not 3d print?
---
Thanks tooth paste!
---
Oh so the survivor is allowed to ruin the killers match though?
---
Everyone crouching would literally be the size of the doll.
---
Just fucking shoot down a David from the other side of the map as a 1 foot doll 😂
---
Yeha he sounds like he just gave up on life
---
"ehhh" - Ghost Face 2019
---
Mainline the salt.
---
&gt; Bc she's mentally a child
---
no she isnt.
---
Ohh you’re totally right he can just walk through doors and stuff. That cool down sounds better than any other balances I’ve thought if
---
He’s asking “how” cause you said it’s excessive, which seems crazy to me as well. You really think one “extra” hit and then being broken the remainder of the game, takes the perk from being garbage to too strong? I don’t understand that whatsoever.
---
more like cannoth Chase, cause his fat belly
---
Yeah, but going big doesn’t really make much sense. Honestly, his power would probably have something to do with voodoo and the totems.
---
&gt;i havent played dbd recently but will they actually get banned or suspended? i feel like when i used to play reports didn’t do anything
---
Yes, they will. 
---
Despite some people saying otherwise, since BHVR revamped their report system on Sep 13, 2018, punishments are being handed.

---
What is a “friend”?
---
I play survivor against killers plenty better than you. Don’t flatter yourself, you’re not good.
---
No? I'm asking how it would be excessive, cause even with the extra one health state it would probably still be bad. As killer you just hit them once, then the broken indicator appears and everyone sees it, so the killer who wasn't even expecting a no mither can still tunneled for a free kill.
---
Nah. Brenda Meeks with a press on nails perk.
---
I wonder why he sounds sad
---
Ash runs like he's hyperventilating at all times.
---
Indestructible totems? Maybe like, he’d be able to go small for a set a period of time, and during that time he has special abilities. Then he’d have to wait for the cool down to activate it again.
---
r/Deathgarden
---
Y’all will do anything to make being a survivor a cake walk lmao
---
*laughs in identityV*
---
No. It’s a full perk slot and is already very situational. Usually I’ll see that 3 of the survivors I face used DS and only one got it off. It is already a high risk and doesn’t need to be nerfed. If DS really bothers you so much just run enduring. Once again, I will reiterate, DS is a good perk but it is only strong under certain instances and doesn’t need to be nerfed.
---
Survivor: sends hate mail

Me: being smug saying you deserved it cunt 😂😂

When do us niggas on Xbox one get ghostface killah? I loved him in the wu-tang clan
---
I've never noticed that do you have to have your setting on lock ultra?
---
Yea after seeing GF and his power you might be right lmao.
---
Aw I’m sorry that happened to him :/
---
The most confusing thing about this screenshot is someone brought a broken key with no addons into the trial. Why? What reason could you have for that?
---
Thank you for reminding me of this
---
I'm not saying it's in a good state, I'm saying that giving No Mither users another opportunity at looping takes the perk from 'useful, but kind of memey' to a no-brainer. I don't know if it's OP at that point, we won't have to find out if we apply more sensible QoL improvement, like maybe what I suggested.
---
Yikes dude. This is why ranks are so screwed. New players shouldn’t have to put up with that kinda shit. I mean, no one should but especially not new players.
---
If you are trying to make it look more to scale yeah id make one a little bigger but thats just me
---
Good perks for Hag : Hex:Ruin, Monitor and Abuse, A Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher, Make Your Choice, Save The Best For Last, Franklin's Demise, Deerstalker, Knock Out, Hex:Devour Hope, Hex:Haunted Ground and Hex:NOED.
---
Good perks for Spirit : Hex:Ruin, Barbecue and Chilli, A Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher, Deerstalker, Hex:Devour Hope, Hex:Haunted Ground, Rancor, Surveillance, Discordance, Pop Goes thhe Weasel, Save The Best For Last and Rancor.

A moment of silence for the Dwight... *sniff*
---
Beat me to it. I was going to say the same thing.
---
Haha :D
---
you don’t know, maybe she literally has a disorder and never fully developed mentally
---
I gotta be honest with you the full recovery from dying state and a weak Iron will just doesn't even seem like good positives when Unbreakable and Iron will exists. Any killer that realizes you have no mither won't slug you, they're not dumb. And while the 50% less pain grunts is useful it's not 100%, so killers can still pick it up. The no blood thing is pretty unique to the perk I'll give it that, but is that really good enough to warrant permanent injured state?
---
I mean they are all under the same license so there is a possibility.
---
Don’t let some 15 year old troll you. Just disconnect.
---
How do you gain this power?
---
That pocket knife is really heavy
---
The people that do this are the people that lose their shit when you BM them back. It’s great.
---
I think a lot of survivors hate bubba because of the amount of insidious camping bubba's there are. I personally enjoy going against a good bubba who doesn't camp.
---
I'd say *darn* but its actually an acronym for does anyone remember noed?
---
Best part is he dced right after getting hooked.
---
Well… you might have some games where your kit will be completely useless except for empathy 'cause the skillchecks for autodidact are sometimes really rare.
---
Solidarity can be used if you manage to escape a killer after he hit you once, or if you are unhook by someone already hurt. It specially shines against a slugger or if you manage a kobe in a basement party. It's satisfying to use but it's quite niche i would say, so…
---
An other version which in my opinion can find more use is :
---
Autodidact, Botany knowledge, pharmacy, Empathie.
---
If you don't get your autodidact skillcheck you still get the +33% healing speed from Botany and for yourself just always use the medkit.
---
yeah matchmaking can be a bit wonky, especially at low ranks. usually it'll put you with killers around your skill level, but every now and then you'll get someone a lot higher. it's pretty easy for high skill killers to intentionally de rank and stomp low level games for ez bloodpoints. but honestly, the best way to improve is to go against experienced people and learn from them.
---
Hex: Darn
---
When losing the match, the Entity grants you something as compensation. You will get 50%/75%/100% more bloodpoints for suffering the match with Freddy.
---
The perk will still give you the benefits even if the hex totem gets cleansed, the totem is just to show how terrible the spots are.
---
What’s your argument here? Obviously there is more variety to killer perks as different perks suit different killers. You wouldn’t run Enduring on Nurse, right?
---
The bloodpoint bonus should be fucking 300% I tell you what
---
is this cursed
---
Ah well i'd say the first part of my response would be appropriate console as far as i'm aware has a smaller community of killers and survivors. 
---
So you're likely getting chucked in with the first killer lobby available. Someone who plays Xbone will probably give you a more succinct answer around the ins and outs.
---
Highly likely.
---
I know, but you know the devs... Always releasing things underpowered at launch
---
Amen.
---
The killer is just ensuring a kill. You're not immediately toxic.
---
I don't get it.
---
If all gens are done then it isn't toxic if the killer camps. What are they meant to do?
---
Played it, kinda agree with you.
---
Keep the tiers, but make it so that higher tiers are the more eccentric changes while the lower tiers are just simple stat swaps (Similar to how a majority of Nurse's add-ons work, a little give and take instead of just give)
---
Got damn xD
---
I agree!
---
It's Hermione Grainger 😂
---
You never see it cominggggg
---
It's not a game about killing, it's a game about both surviving and killing. It's nutjob campers that make it just about killing and then go "don't like it don't play". We don't like it because we don't GET to play.
---
I dont know about you, but facecamping is hilarious and ill find every excuse to do it
---
Sucks being the camped one, but if they are insidious camping just gen rush them. Don't give them the points they get one kill but it's just a waste of time getting angry at a game. 
---
I went against a basement bubba they got one person we just gen rushed and left the game, the other guy getting camped didn't care he just took it like a champ. And that killer had a steam profile built around being an insidious camper troll. 
---
Only one who looses is that guy.
---
I see, hard to see
---
The issue is when you are the guy on the hook
---
when you throw a pallet on him
---
he be like HGHEOHEHEHFEJGHS
---
I want a pink calm for ultimate doctor meyers
---
i usually snap when people shit on Fred but good joke is a good joke. get some karma, sir. thank you for the giggle.
---
Just an honest days work good sir
---
Oh no absolutely it was stolen booze, that's just true by default
---
Just wait until OP comes across 4 mettle, 4 DS, 4 DH, and 4 Adrenaline.
---
I believe so, either that or an Adam, tall buff dude
---
I don’t see you getting on to other people about breaking the rules. Sooo many people shame other players daily.
---
I think it is Jeff because of his perks and that makes me happy because all Jeffs are wholesome :3
---
It's clutter. More of explaining them so they aren't shocked when it's removed for being against the rules. I guess trying to educate someone is bad oops
---
Yeah it's not a fun experience but like I said there's not much you can do. Unless you kill yourself on hook, but i wouldn't because it just rewards them. When that happens to me im just happy that i bought my team enough time to escape.
---
Then educate everybody. Not just some streamer.
---
As Fred you have to sleep as many survivors as you can, mind game when focusing on hitting one,, go towards another hit them, wait for them to break out of heal, go to that location, sleep and mind game again. The only think that killed it for Fred was the darn time it takes for them to sleep. 7 seconds of God mode can be a life time when all you have to do is hit a survivor and they all gen rush in your face. But once you learn that and 3 gen strat he's one of the best killers to do fun builds with.
---
He sounds like ThePoon after his Warriors of the wasteland Choke
---
It's like an offering to you for sparing their life.
---
Imagine killers needed an add-on to kick a generator
---
Imagine killers needed an add-on to hit a survivor a second time
---
Imagine killers needed an add-on to break pallets
---
Imagine killers needed an add-on to see generators
---
Imagine killers needed an add-on to shut the hatch
---
Imagine killers needed an add on to get a basement
---
It might have been just under 10 minutes but she wasnt the most experienced hag.

Hillbilly is a good choice overall. :)

---
I like how Devilface has a more classic hood/cowl going for him. Given FunWorld ALSO has rights to a similar classic robe (the movie robe was shiny, had drawstrings for the hood, and ribbons, while FW's robe lacks all of those except the sleeves drapes are there but more like spiked curtains instead of ribbons) we could even see a classic look for him one day.
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
There's two considerations to the changes you suggest: 
---
1. As you might have read in these comments, I pointed out that instantaneous proximity-based deactivation would not affect Nurse (the strongest killer) because she could cover that distance in 2 warps, negating the perk in almost no time. The weakest killers such as cannibal could not do this, so if it's going to be proximity it has to be time-based.
---
2. I recommend two hits on other survivors rather than just a down because if an injured survivor rescues the person and they get downed immediately after the unhook it's not any better than tunneling because now there's a person on the ground *and* the killer is chasing after the freshly unhooked person. In such a case it's fair for DS to activate because the killer has nothing to lose by downing the un-hooker at the hook when tunneling. Similarly if the killer is running noed and does about the same thing, the same situation should apply. 
---
It's important to be optimistic. One way to draw attention to changes is to talk about it and bring it to the forefront of the community ^*(cough cough upvote this post cough cough)*
---
It’s obvious you don’t understand what I am saying. And with that sir, I bid you a good night
---
PepeLaugh... They don't know.
---
The 78 film never happened!! how dare you reference it!?
---
Prove me wrong
---
So your solution to "meta perks" is just to hope people get tired of grinding so long for them they just stop playing the game entirely? Why not just address the "imbalanced mechanics"? It doesn't matter it takes 10 trillion years to get them if they're broken, conversely it SHOULDN'T take a life-long commitment just to have variety in your perk/addon/item/offering choices.
---
Wraith *ROOOOOOH*
---
Exactly
---
Yea? Can’t disagree with it
---
*raAaAaAaA*
---
Bummer for you I guess? Do something if they camp like grab a drink or something, I don’t know, productive?
---
You put forth a claim with no evidence or basis and I’m the one that has to prove it wrong..*facepalm*
---
It’s an emotional statement unless you prove yourself right.
---
A toxic but positive experience (for me at least) was getting called bad killer and camper by some claudette, that I shrugged off, but next trial I realize that same player just entered my lobby again.
---
A true positive experience however happened recently. I hate Dwights, if you play Dwight, you're gonna get tunneled camped and mori'd if I have one at my disposal. But the Dwight I killed....was a good person, it is what it is, no rage at all lol
---
They are going to shoot down your idea but I love it. It's a smart way to encourage a decent secondary objective and like you said everyone would know what they are in for at the start. It'll also slow the game down a bit for killers in a different way from hex ruin. 
---
Smart, minimal work to implement, slows the game down, encourages another objective - sounds like a great idea. Of course BVHR would rather slit their wrists than actually implement such an idea. They think that doing gens and escaping is already more than enough on poor survivors.
---
*Looks guys! Fresh meat*
---
Ah I see. You fixed it x)

I see this as an absolute win!

And don’t be surprised when DS/BT work against you and the 4 survivors are tbagging you at the exit gate because you couldn’t stay disciplined and try to play the game as efficiently as you could have as killer.

Thanks! I love doing little "voodoo doll" versions of things. It seems to fit in with DBD really well.
---
Thank you!
---
Aw. thank you so much! :3
---
the reason why is because it's just too hard to do the hat, sadly. I think I could do it, but it would be very complicated and not easy for people to assemble. I'll keep working on it and see if I can figure it out!
---
On the wiki, yes.
---
Perks : Barbecue and Chilli, Hex:Ruin, Enduring and Spirit Fury. You can also replace BBQ or SF with Brutal Strength or Bamboozle.
---
Add-ons : Flask of Bleach is pretty mandatory and other good add-ons are Solvent Jug, Ether 5 Vol%/Ether 10 Vol%/Ether 15 Vol% and Fingerless Parade Gloves/Thick Cork Stopper.
---
Or you can use Redhead's Pinky Finger and Chip Gin Bottle.

Yeah, he's pretty cool! I have my little Myers doll stalking my little Laurie doll.

I didn't know what that was, so I looked it up... I can see why you thought that!

Any time someone called something a crutch perk unironically or claimed that they someone called something a crutch perk, it earned a tally mark. When someone equated two perks from opposite sides both being crutch, I put a tally in both sides. I quit partway through, but I think the majority is fine:
---
1. Evidence of survivors referring to something as "crutch": ***21***
---
2. Evidence of killers referring to something as "crutch": ***9***

thank you r/deadbydaylight for making me stop being an asshole :)
---
A very good choice! My personal preference is christmas sweater Jeff but do what you want o great artist :D
---
Just started and only been using wraith because I like to sneak up on people and get the jump scare. Also I spam the bell on the last hook. As for survivor ash all the way love evil dead.
---
I disagree with him too but I'd like to see why you think that
---
But I don’t have enduring :(

Well, I don't know what you have ...

I miss her derpy scream, they could've just lower the volume of it.

I just want finger guns to be honest
---
Alright everyone, more backround. There was only 1 gen ready, and it was being repaired, then about 1 min later the gate was open
---
PS:My team didn’t bother to help me
---
It would destroy the synergy between no mither and resilience/this is not happening.
---
😂😂😂 your perks don’t matter just run extra hindered and exhaustion add ons then take the free win. But also put on noed because y not
---
Bro if only
---
I totally forgot about Wraiths scream! That one is actually pretty creepy too. Sounds similar to Pigs tiger lunge audio, only "ghostified"
---
The Gassy Boi
---
I been needing a good fucking.
---
^(STBFL only gains stacks on ambush hit, its cooldown isn't reduced)
---
Is her power RNG like data suggests OR do survivors have a box specifically for their trap? I haven’t really found a clear answer.
---
I think you speak for all of us
---
Let’s seee, I have the Hags perks, the doctors, leatherface, pig, nurse, and discordance. That’s also only if I unlock them in the bloodweb.
---
So you made an absolute claim then created some arbitrary point system and picked a sample of threads with no explanations on how you selected these threads.... and proved your absolute claim wrong. I think it’s safe to say you hold a bias.
---
at the very least they could write "a small increase", "a medium increase", and "a high increase". How tf is anyone supposed to know the difference between "moderately", "considerably", etc??
---
Most ships happen on Gonewild or tumblr lol,,

And to correct you, Pedophilia is the attraction towards minors who have not gone past puberty, aka children, Laurie is a teen who hits the age of consent in many many places in the world, if anything its Ephebophilia, not pedophilia, please stop using pedophilia for teens under 18, it minimizes and partially normalizes pedophilia.
---
That's some looney tunes bullshit
---
Woo pig yeah!! Lets go!!!! 12 year olds!!!
---
B&amp;C is not S tier. Yes, everyone uses it, but it has easy counterplay to it and low Mobility killers dont benefit as much of it. For me, its only S tier for Nurse and Billy and High B Tier for the rest
---
I think this is the type of buff that no mither needs and that we should get more buffs to other weak perks
---
If you'd be so kind as to view my other comment, I've done a completely reasonable job of proving my point:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bz2w0j/definitely_me/eqqwjvw/
---
Play with NOED enough and Survivors will complain about crutching before you can even say "ggwp". It's part of the game.
---
*I know from... a... uh... friend... yeah... a friend...*
---
Whispers is at least A tier of you know how to actually use it. Watch OhTofu's video why and how
---
Thanks a lot for the response! Which one do you like to play more they both look really fun XD and I like to be a medic I know it isn't meta and reason I ask which one u like more is I don't have all the perks unlocked haha
---
Yes is still good
---
the book isn't technically canon but
---
in the book it goes into detail about the "throbbing between his legs"
---
Why don't they just make this an option in-game... Surely it can't be that hard -___-
---
Age of consent is the age of consent, it doesn't matter the age from a legal standpoint, as such you cannot say that it's to protect teens from engaging with other teens because we do have the Romeo and Juliet exceptions to that law in many countries for just that reason, 
---
While I do think that the age of consent is a very strange concept that should be reworked to not allow adults to manipulate teens your first argument is just plain wrong.
---
Mindless camping annoys me. By this I mean going in with the intent of camping because why not. Strategical camping I can deal with (no one comes up on bbq chilli for example). Ngl tho insidious leatherface only exists because it works people fall for it way too often and yes it ruins the game but just let go give up if there’s no one to camp he, then he can’t. But saying that you won’t want to give up because you screw your team over, and that’s why the build works .
---
Thank you
---
wow... you posted my text?!
---
'even though' should be replaced by 'because'
---
I miss the old lighting
---
Haunted Ground should be in a lower tier, only high mobility killers can get a good value out of it. The rest of the killers need luck which makes it inconsistent.
---
Yuck, no thanks.
---
I actually really like that there are multiple canons, since then you can choose the one you think is the most interesting
---
people argue about what's "really canon"
---
what really happened is whatever the fuck you want, fiction is made to be enjoyed
---
I think I will combine the demon robe torso with the normal mask to get as close as I can.
---
Can confirm! I adored season 11 just cause of Miss Vaaaaanjie.
---
I've Been Waiting For This!
---
Are you sure?  If so, I must be suffering from some crazy placebo effect because I swear I feel the on hit Ambush recovery getting reduced by StBfL.  Same with hitting survivors in the exiting phase mode as Spirit and the blade wiping in Feral Frenzy as Legion.
---
Franklin's is F tier, only because it just wont help to finish chases early, track down survivors, slow the game down. Its only use is to make survivors toxic.
---
Your point:
---
&gt; 8.	⁠Survivors will be the first to complain about crutch perks. Bonus points if they have adrenaline and complain about NOED.
---
To back this point up, you showed examples from a *cough* random *cough* sample size of threads where you *still* admit killers also complain about crutches. Your 21-9 score is arbitrary because I could easily create a sample size of threads to go against your clear bias.
---
You will feel like this for a while on the game. You’re new you won’t full understand how to use the mechanics the game gives you to your advantage and neither will the people you play with or against. The best option to try and get out of this mentality is go watch a video on how to improve see what stronger players do and try to do what they do. Once you learn the game properly your opinion will probably flip to the other side
---
We don't know how long the survivors have been in the Entity's realm. They might have been there for decades
---
Is the one in the middle the doctor or Francis? The outfit is throwing me off
---
Well it wasn't Vigo experimenting last year, it was a newcomer who found his notes. It could be that the entity was in something of a weaker state during the purge and needed to conserve energy, or it could simply be that it didn't care. It's not like you pay attention to what each of your blood-cells are doing at any given moment.
---
I'll try making one after I get home
---
Is the headphone new? I had to set my device to standard communication device before I could use it.
---
Honestly the main reason I bought the Myers dlc is because Myers is one of my favourite slasher villains.
---
I'd like to see the mask of the TV show. Actually found it pretty unnerving to look at.
---
i think the matching must be according to highest rank in swf. not middle ground.
---
sometimes playing with my low rank casual friends and i hate it cause being a red rank survivor i feel bad for facing yellow-green rank killers. they don't deserve it and i'm not having fun too.
---
as killer idgaf, i play fair and seeing a clearly less skilled survivor i go easy on them. but less experienced killers are definitely not having a great time with swfs.
---
Perimeter protection
---
Hmm you make a good point. I'll let you know what I come up with then.
---
I won't be buying him.
---
Hell, with how stale the game's getting, I may even stop playing until the Freddy rework.
---
I think the effect will not go away, but who cares because you shouldn't leave blood pools in the first place.
---
Ghost Face won't be released in his current state because nobody would buy him.
---
I thought Hag was a child?
---
Already am my dude
---
It should be self explanatory. What does "slightly increase the Survivor's bleeding frequency" mean on Sloppy Butcher? Does that mean a 5% increase? Does that mean a 50%? Is "considerably" a 100%, 200%, 500%, 1000% increase? Slightly/moderately/considerably don't mean anything because they could mean literally anything.
---
Ooooof I totally forgot pls hide me friend
---
Honestly for killers I find the rank system has become such a joke. (Well, more than it already was)
---
Players like that guy (green) just deserve a permaban.
---
His perks are ass though

God himself

Ew.
---
He was still pretty nice, most of the time they just tell you to uninstall
---
The thing is that the actual values for slightly, moderately, and considerably are extremely small. If they put the actual percentage in the perk/add on, then it would make them feel very lack luster. IIRC slightly only gives you a 10% boost.
---
DEJA VU!

Happy cake day

You ever wear a mask for Halloween? Yeah, his heavy breathing is understandable

if i get a friend in my lobby i message them im gonna camp your ass you better run. I don't camp them but we have a laugh afterwards

What's wrong with him?
---
Keep the darn BP's i want the emblem's filled for things you can't get. I'm trying to get R1 done for the ach only, then i swear i'm never fucking playing killer again.

"urgh I gotta stop drinking"
---
When doctor rubs his hands in anticipation
---
GG's on ur boi for getting a 3k against survivors with more experience and better perks,the salt is just the trophy :3
---
I can relate, as a killer main "how the fuck are these survivors so fast? "And then I play survivor to try it out and  fuuuck I am slow. Is there a secret super sprint button or something?
---
MoM nerf / rework is well deserved but you should've used your brain there. 
---
Legion and Plague are two killers that can reliably deny MoM stacks and you went for a regular M1? 
---
Also, David used an instaheal.
---
I'm sorry but your video doesn't say anything about MoM, just that you need to git gud.
---
Yep.
---
Recently bought pig and I just love her with all my heart. Oink!
---
I got pretty good at her on PS4. Had to turn my sensitivity to 100% in order to hit them as they try to hop back across a pallet when I blink through it. When I get to a pallet I usually always respect it because if they throw it 75% of the time I get a free hit because of their false security. Once you get over her difficulty curve she's amazing because like 80% of console survivors dont know how to counter her effectively. So keep at it :) unless you like doctor more then go for that :)
---
This
---
Oh doctor is my main killer. Like I said I was only really playing her to get nurses calling for him. I might try her again later down the road when consoles get 60 fps. I just love everything about the doctor's design and find him to be one of the more creepy killers.
---
I’d just use plastic, you can always paint it to look like the material used in the game
---
When you down the toxic survivor and they DC
---
Playing as Freddy and a survivor finishes a gen right in front of you. 
---
When using BBQ to see all the survivors are piled on the last gen and its ready to be complete. 
---
Seeing a survivor DC as soon as they are downed.
---
Hit boxes are ridiculous. But knowing you made a pallet or window jump and you get hit... man!!!!
---
Mhm. I feel you.
---
Boy creators that give thanks to the people financially supporting them really rustles my jimmies, lemme tell ya
---
RIGHT?????
---
well, im a killer main, so what if a player dc's on a killer???
---
I hope one day people will understand the difference between hitbox and ping.
---
On this day, I won't have to read stupid shit like this.

having a killer like the hunter from l4d would be pretty cool ngl
---
I totally feel that. I liked playing the doctor before I tried focusing on the nurse and falling in love with her. His laugh really makes it feel good to get a shock.
---
I dont wanna buy him, but because of bbq, so...
---
It's the mask. There are not holes
---
You did the whole "thank you guys for your support" schtick before you even publicly mentioned your Patreon. It's one thing to genuinely say "thanks for supporting me by watching my stuff" once, but mentioning it twice per video and doing that for like half dozen videos in a row? It gets tiring. Same with the humor and editing. There's only so many times you can put a filter over your voice while saying something borderline funny before it gets fucking tiring to sift through it.
---
*misses NE-AH by a little/she had DH* *grunt*, that's comedy alright.
---
I mean pings have something to do with it yeah. Do you want a reward or something? Pings factor in. I was just generalizing no need to get super salty.
---
Me too, it was so creepy compared to what we have now...
---
In Identity V, the hunter Photographer has a very... loud breathing once he enters his photoworld. Not that I complain since I main him ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Something similar happened to me last night, I hid in that same cupboard, killer came through checked the cupboard where your other person was hiding (I was alone down there) walked off, but he was still lingering. He came back through, checked that first huntress cupboard and then left. My heart was freaking out
---
To this day I still don't know when to drop it.
---
Especially with bhvr. Huntress' one windup add-on says slightly and the other considerably when the actual values are 8% and 12%...
---
Not getting stunned as Pig.
---
I am just sick of seeing people complaining about hitboxes everywhere. reddit, forums, twitch, youtube, everywhere
---
The worst part is, 9 out 10 people complaining about it doesn't know which hits are caused by ping or broken hitboxes
---
Try talking shit to people irl just to let out some steam, see how it's helpful.
---
Being on the internet doesn't mean you're not dealing with human people.
---
why would you want to in the first place? lol
---
Maybe you should suggest your friend to hide the chat at first, so this kind of people don't ruin the game for him.
---
Why would you think this is something everyone must see? You unhooked  guy when the killer wasn't there and then it is 15seconds of you running to the gate. What is special or funny or epic about this?
---
you never mentioned twitter but i was covering what you might say to my reply. He mentions “thanks to my patreons” AND “Thank you for all the support”
---
OINKS
---
Killers should get bloodpoints even if the survivors connection expires, because its lost bloodpoints either way
---
Has to be AFTER the entire animation is done and the killer can start moving again. The window is pretty large so don't be afraid of them taking a few steps. Just during the animation will never work and soooo many people drop it way to early.
---
I remember once I was also playing Billy and was chasing a Claudette and she went from pallet to pallet, used, no joke, almost 9 pallets, teabagging everytime I revved the chainsaw to break them and then when I eventually caught her she immediately DCed. I am talking alft+f4 levels of immediately, she didn't even hit the ground properly she left so fast.
---
a killer main was made that day
---
That makes a bit more sense
---
Survivor: getting farmed off the hook and then downed immediately and hooked again.
---
Killer: Getting raked over the coals by a sweaty, toxic SWF cancer squad.
---
Yeah I feel it. I think hit boxes are pretty even in terms of killers and survivors. I could of totally pointed towards ping for sure. My bad man. Have a good dbd match!
---
Well, considering when perks have clear descriptions like Enduring and Brutal Strenght, and still people can't understand how they work (most can't tell the difference between changing speed and time) I understand why they prefer those terms.
---
Nurse blinks especially.
---
And it shouldn't show the broken icon. And it should give you X2 bloodpoints Because it's hard mode
---
"the coals" 💀 but yesss i hate that too, especially if you're the one getting call toxic
---
Possible since there is also that growing like he is in pain
---
Whats wrong with Myers?
---
I think it should be like michael. If you see him, hide behind cover so he cant stalk you
---
Was his stalking fixed on the PTB? They said it's not intended that you can just spin your camera to break his stalking but instead, it should take some time (1 sec iirc) to break it.  
---
I think they will make some tweaks. Like stalk-meter doesn't go down on Survivors or smth like that. It's pretty unlikely that they leave him like this.
---
I like owning and playing all killers so I will. I really hope they address his issues though
---
Thanks, now I can finally not be useless.

Yes, it does just do normal damage.

The guy going for the save, even if it's right in front of you, recklessly, can do so with Mettle of Man.

Both get out for free, 0 skill involved, absolute braindead gameplay. No possible counterplay with M1 killers.
---
I main Cowboy. Why? Because being a hero is in my nature. That, and I do some pretty sweet lasso moves.
---
Some people are idiots who don't look around them whike they work on gens etc, thusly letting daddy Mike easily sneak up on them and stalk them. Then they complain Myers came out of nowhere.
---
Holy shit this is so true.
---
Lol I'd piss myself laughing if that happened to me as a survivor. Wouldn't even be mad.

---
This is a good point. I usually end up having to do everything because my teammates have zero brain cells. Playing killer means you dont have to rely on anyone else.
---
With the freddy rework I’ll need another bad killer to play as on kill your friends, Ghostface should be perfect. 
---
And if he gets buffed, I like stealth killers and his design sounds good just implemented poorly currently, so it’s a win win.
---
It’s not so much they want easy games, they want fair games, 4 tool boxes = gen rush, all join at once = broken swf,
---
I WAS THINKING OF SAYING THAT BUT I FELT LIKE NOBODY WOULD UNDERSTAND
---
At this point we need a spoof of DBD with nothing but parody killers and survivors.  Funny thing is. Bet it would work a whole lot better than the original too.
---
I actually use the perk all the time, but I feel like you should indeed start healthy, and I feel like the broken status effect should be hidden from the killer. With these 2 changes, I think No Mither could actually be concidered a perk.
---
Rework or not, I'll keep using no mither as long as it keeps it's 50% less noisy, no blood trail and infinitely getting up on your own stats

I don’t see why, how hard is it to say ‘gg, gl next’ or something along those lines after every game? Even if your opponent(s) were annoying or ‘toxic’, maybe showing kindness to them even after going through getting looped to shit or tunnelled will make them think, and if not, no skin off your teeth, right?
---
You're the ignorant one.
---
I've seen it happen from the killer's perspective too. They're the host, so it shouldn't.
---
But the survivor vaults all the way to the other side of a pallet. Killer slaps the pallet with their weapon, and even though the survivor is well out of range, they are still struck.
---
Stop pretending ping is an excuse for everything. In this instance it isn't. The survivor's hitbox does weird things like merge with the object it's interacting with, so they could be one tip toe left on a pallet yet they're still hit because they are technically 'on' it. It's lazy programming. Stop defending it.
---
Did u even read the meme lol
---
I must say that I like the No Mither as it is right now
---
Just make it so 3 perks appear each bloodweb, I feel that would help a fair bit. Or each time you level up, you receive a mystery box that can include green+ add ons/offerings, or a random perk.
---
When looping, if you look behind you, you won't turn corners as tight. Using the mouse to turn corners tight will help you there for example.
---
I learned that the hard way since it's a habit to turn the camera around and look at the killer while I'm being chased, but that makes you slower.
---
Holy shit what an asshole!
---
Oh damn. I thought I read she was around 15 or 16. I'm not good with cannon tho
---
Yep. Even if they have none, make those fucks go into the negative.

The main buff I want to see with No Mither is a 100% bloodpoint bonus
---
Farming Davids. Apparently they missed the memo that the unhooks have to be safe now, because I swear 1 in every 10 games I'm being pulled off right in front of the killer.
---
Immersed teammates.
---
Firstly, it doesn't make better if weak players get punished for playing like that. I said that there's already too much punishment for weak players for camping. There's no need in making their life worse. If they manage to get higher ranks, then they will have to deal with experienced survivors which can counter camping, and if such killers want to kill anyone, then they will have to grow. 
---
Otherwise it's okay when weak players get to kill at least 1 survivors through camping.
---
Secondly, don't forget that killers are players, not AI. They also want to have some fun, and, honestly, it's frustrating when you get completely destroyed by survivors which are much more experienced then you (this, although, rarely happens to me, but it often happens with nee players). Getting 1 kill is better then 0, it makers bitter experience a bit better. 
---
Thirdly, game mustn't be balanced around low ranks or weak players. The game should be balanced around its best players or at least rank 1-5 players. Balancing game around weak players, for example punishing players for using effective low rank strategies, which are extremely ineffective in hight ranks, is what will lead the game to complete disaster. Another example of it was freddy and ghostface. Freddy's power was (and it is, if I'm not mistaken) extremely strong on low ranks, because people don't know how to counter it, but is extremely weak on high ranks, because he's just M1 killer with little map pressure, which can be looped pretty easily. Almost the same for ghostface, but here we can see what happens when killer's power is balanced around low ranks (As for ghostface, I'm not very sure if it is true. It looks like it has so much downsides because it would be too op on low ranks)
---
Finally, adding BT or punishing camping even more can destroy balance and some killers' gameplay. Cannibal depends much on camping, because this is the only way his chainsaw can work at its full potential. And as for balance.. survivors will get a 5th perk just for free and it would make 20 perks against 4(5, if we'll do the same with killers) killer's perks. Not to mention how much profit would strong players get out of it. No, thank you.
---
Camping works because survivors(not all of them ofc) are dumbasses. They try to rescue hooked survivor without any coordination and just do that suicide YOLO thing. If you really want the camping to be fixed, then remember that camping killers often get depiped and get less then 15k BP. Isn't that enough?
---
The amount of grind. I have close to 200 hours I think and barely have all of the killers to lvl 40. Still working on Legion. Aside from Billy and Hag, I have no actual builds on the other killers and my survivors are all lvl 1 except for 3 that are 50 30 and 15.
---
Ya, but she only gets Corrupt Purge only that one time. She loses all those other chances.
---
and big brain Hag players run Haunted Ground to mindgame survivors into cleansing it
---
What's more annoying are survivors who can't stay alive against the plague's temporary downing gunk.
---
I'll do you one better that actually happened 2 days ago: completing the last gen as the killer gets close to you, only for them to have NOED. I didn't even get touched the whole game but died as a result of that.
---
what's more annoying is the fact, that people can't stand being injured so much they'll force everyone else to heal themselves too instead of just ignoring it and doing their job.
---
Actually i do talk shit to my friends when i'm pissed, and they talk shit when they're pissed. It's fair and everyone gets to talk shit every now and again.
---
Disconnects.
---
Nah, i only ever play survivor with friends and if i'd be talking shit, they'd all be talking shit with me.
---
"why'd you die though"
---
"no but you died"
---
"yeah but you're dead"
---
Just play dumb and salt the player like that.
---
Nuf said.
---
you're in more danger being healthy vs corrupt than being injured vs infected. you're in even more danger being injured vs corrupt. Thanks for fucking your team because you can't stand a green tint on your screen/being injured
---
I'm starting to really dislike the safety pip. I'll have what I feel was an amazing game, but nope...brutal killer. I've never played any other game where you could make 0 rank progress from a match. You either climbed or went back down. I know they said they plan on reworking it entirely, but I'd like a small tweak in the meantime. Even just moving each pipping notch down by one would make all the difference.
---
Its when you start a match as a survivor and someone immediately D/Cs or playing against a camping Cannibal.
---

*deep inhale* HITBOXES!

Face camping Texas 🤦🏼‍♂️
---
*deep inhale* SAME!
---
body blocking, teabagging after a pallet down (not even stunning me) and as soon as they were downed they dc'ed.
---
I don't play against her much and I haven't looked in detail. She is just so short I believed it when I read it.
---
- Survivors who are oblivious and let you get to second stage hook when the killer is nowhere nearby.
---
- Survivors who are at full health, and are still too scared to rescue their team mates from the hook right in front of the gate, against a cloaked wraith.
---
- Killers who get butthurt that you looped them or pallet stunned them for slightly longer than they would have liked. Apparently trying to survive is 'toxic' now, and is met with frequent and unwarranted face camping.
---
- Killers who tunnel and camp during double BP events just because they want the extra salt.
---
- Survivors who do not contribute to generators all game. If all you're doing is waddling around looting chests and cleansing dull totems, I won't rescue you.
---
- Survivors who cry 'camper!' at a killer, because they were waddling around in plain sight near the hook. What do you expect? If I'm playing killer and I know even one survivor is near the hook, why would I leave?
---
- Loading bugs that make me lose good offerings, three years after the game has been released.
---
- SWFs doing 4 gens in about 2 minutes and then crying that you camped the one person you caught after exit gates are powered. Conversely, SWFs doing the same and then insulting you in post game as if they're hot shit.
---
As a killer Id say its playing against toxic ppl with flashlights. Also known as trashlights. (To me anyway.)
---
12 plus a few
---
r/unexpectedlywholesome I think...
---
She's very hunched over when she runs and she even has one of her boobs out
---
Unless someone is using bloodhound and staring at the ground it’s kinda useless  and the fact you need iron will to be silent
---
Just looking at the scoreboard this looks like the ideal game. Everyone got over 10k bloodpoints, no one disconnected, 3 died and 1 escaped. It's basically the most ideal poster boy DBD like game you can have and this green asshole is bitching about the most mundane bullshit his chimp brain can come up with. 
---
P.S. Myers for life.
---
for p i g ness?
---
I remember what it felt like when I first started playing - I went into the killer queue as a fresh rank 20 after finishing the tutorial(s) and waited there what felt like an hour. 
---
Afterwards I simply refunded it, figuring the game would be dead (or simply devoid of newbies). When the free to play weekend came around, I gave it another shot and finally found other newcomers. After leveling up a bit I decided to buy the game (again) - and that's how I got into DbD.
---
I agree, but I was responding to the parent comment saying "Maybe even have their bloodstains dissappear slightly earlier"
---
Sadly "slightly"(and every other term in DbD) is a word that is used for a lot of numbers, as in Freddys addons to alter chances of skillchecks is 1%, luck offerings also 1% for slightly. Pigs "slightly" increased addon to get into crouch is 100% while Billys slight decreased cooldown is 14%.
---
Well i guess you're right. I used to be like that, just typing "GG" and going to the next game. That changed when i had around 20 games in a row against full SWF squadettes and i lost like 75% of the games due to them playing at maximum efficiency while i tried to have fun. I soon realised being toxic and running annoying builds like DWW and InstaBilly made me get 4ks many games in a row against those same squadettes. The end game chat would be the four of them flaming me for being a bad killer for running *x* perk or *x* add-on, and i soon started replying with various things, such as "Learn to play you natural camo abusing fucks" and that really tilted those bastards which made me happy because they filled my steam profile with comments like "KYS" and "Nig***".
---
Between ranks 1-5 I don't think i've had a single game in the pass 3 days that wasn't Nurse, Billy, or Huntress, maybe 1 spirit thrown in.
---
Idk I feel like they got our on their own terms I like when nobody saves them and they die in first is second hook I don’t feel satisfaction if they dc
---
Lmao that's an odd detail to have and now that explains that red dress in the store
---
Speak for yourself. Me and my team mates rarely have problems cleansing against the plague.
---
Has happened to me several times, just send a support ticket to bvhr and they'll compensate you with bloodpoints
---
Where's the lie?
---
It's helpful because you don't know em, they don't know you, you can let off some steam and they don't care. Win/Win

oooooooh hes name is shorty. lmao i thought ghostface was just flirting with him "hello shawty"
---
I use this perk constantly to make camping killers gamble between me getting up and the hooked survivor being saved, pair with DH and you essentially have 2 health and can beat noed/billy, pair with tenacity and iron will and you're gone when the killer looks away if you're down.
---
It requires synergy, but if you got the perks, mmm...
---
Oh dont say that -._-. That terrifies me

A long time ago someone datamined stuff for us here on reddit about every addon, item and offering we had back then.

---
Other guides for numbers is linked in it until Pig release. Every change or added stuff afterwards is sadly not datamined by anyone so we dont know about the "newer" numbers.  
---
Also, McLean gave us some numbers on his own stream after the datamining guy posted here. Its not every killer since a change to his working position in BHVR made him uncomfy in giving out more ideas/changes to stuff but we got positive response that all stuff datamined above is actually true.

I found that it’s around 8 onwards for the UK these past couple days. (PC) it’s taking about 10/15 minutes to get a game
---
They only did 2 gens only and yeah I tunneled...All four of them xD as you can clearly see. While I camped one and tunneled him, the other 3 did all the gens. /s
---
I'll buy him regardless, just because he has the ultimate power of T-bagging.-
---
Legion isn’t even bottom tier.
---
For what it's worth, don't get discouraged, have fun!
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I use it with iron will and it only works against Nurses; and you have to run dead hard with it.
---
There's quote a difference between friends and strangers, I though it was obvious
---
I know but it adds mingled and that crap, and that affects you until you're healed and slows your repairing and such though
---
Please, yes.  
---
Much like you, I'm sick of having to resort to the wiki in order to get an exact read on practically every item and add-on in the game. Players should be able to get all the information they want in-game, and go from there when forming their strategy.  
---
The fanmade wiki should NOT be essential to this kind of thing. It should merely be a second choice, should a player be curious about something, but not want to have to open the game to read into said something.
---
I dodge SWFs because I'm tired of rude players that teabag, flashlight clicks and especially tell each other where the totem is. The totem spawns are shit, if I add SWFs in them, then the game will be shit. So bye
---
Janky ass bloodwebs, I've unlocked M&amp;A as a teachable two weeks ago and haven't seen it yet on my Freddy. 
---
Y E T...
---
I've gotten STBFL and Pop goes the Weasel at Tier 3 and Tier 2 all within the same day of getting them, both perks I've gotten after I unlocked M&amp;A as a teachable. I just wanna run Ninja Freddy dude but the Entity won't allow it.
---
I find that the survivors that get cocky and try to make fun of you DC when you get them
---
As survivor: People who don't unhook you at the right time, may it be by accident or farming. If I see you on the hook, Imma pretend my nose is bleeding
---
I still get that since I usually play killer. When I go survivor, the anxiety kicks in and I scream
---
the way you just look ahead upsets me
---
\*laughs in Lery's\*
---
Never too late
---
I play legion on high ranks and i normally have a really good time with him. The things you need to focus on is injuring everyone, then after that you can relly on m1 killer mindgames, or you can use Monitor &amp; Abuse to get them by surprise in spots where they don't have time to get to a loop. I also recomend using Nurse's on him, because people actually heal against him after his "rework". Another really good combo to use on him is the enduring+Spirit fury, it's just godly on him, because you can hit them with friendzy and stay under the pallet, they drop the pallet negating your power fatigue and you get the pallet destroyed and stun reduction, that basically gives you a free down. Imo Legion is pretty underrated and is much better than he was before, you just need some time to learn how he works and what perks work best on him. Anyway, have a good day!
---
This would make the Santa skin an insta-buy

that juicy 1k though

FINISH THAT GEN BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE

*starts looping the killer*
---
Yes, the emotes I am thinking of would be toxic yeah
---
How much toxicity are we looking at
---
Rank 12 pro right there 👀 
---
Don't worry probably also an age 12 pro
---
Can you people understand it's a challenge perk? The only buff it needs is 100% bonus BPs if you manage to escape.
---
Opinions on noed aside, in your scenario the bad killer isn't getting the 4K due to the perk, they get it because the survivors are equally bad or dumb as bricks. Even noed doesn't speed/onehit you up enough to enable a 4K. Those survivors either spent their time teabagging well out of crawling reach of the exit gate, or banzai rushing the killer in a moronic and suicidal frenzy after he managed to get one of them thanks to noed. The 4K then isn't thanks to noed.
---
Yup
---
yeah but what if I don’t cleanse and am running calm spirit 🤔
---
Nope.
---
Id rather do something else to relieve some steam because flaming others does not do that at all.
---
Balls....I watched someone play wraith and they had some add on that made him not make a sound when he cloaks and uncloaks. If I get that killer I’m going to pee my pants.
---
My dbd motto has been for a while "who needs exhaustion perks when you have pebble". many of my teammates share this motto, but instead they replace "pebble" with "DC"
---
Its better to meet theese people as soon as possible so you can decide if you want to daily deal with that trash or just ask for a refund.
---
Balls...I watched someone play wraith that had an add on that didn’t make the bell sound when they cloak and uncloak. If I ever played that killer I would just pee my pants.
---
Sicko mode ability.

That sounds awful, this game on mobile? It already runs shit on most pc's

Can't blame me for camping because you're a survivor and survivors have a ridiculous tendency to be toxic.
---
Perk doesn't even do right what it's meant to do. Had a salty Pig camp and tunnel me after I destroyed her Ruin 15 seconds into the game. Managed to run her a bit after unhook but got downed right next to another hook.
---
I was on that thing before the line reached the success part of the circle to activate DS.
---
every single main building
---
Yes it is. It was officially announced during the anniversary stream and [it’s on the official roadmap as well](https://twitter.com/deadbybhvr/status/1134580355913175042?s=21)
---
That should be the ability of "Alien"
---
Honestly the entire """benefit""" of no mither is being able to get up an infinite number of times. But that'll never happen, because killers dont usually slug that hard, and whats more NO ONE will slug you when theres that big no mither logo on your icon.
---
The devs really need to calm it the fuck down with how much the make everything obvious. Killers and perks. Let people use their brains for a quarter of a second. Failed skillcheck regressed far more than normal? Might be a lullaby. Totem cleamsing taking way longer? Thrill of the hunt. Guy keeps getting up and never heals? No mither.
---
Its not that hard. Even if you're completely new all this hand holding is overkill and only helps more seasoned players completely counter said perks easier.
---
Being legit toxic. There's a difference between looping, flashlights and playing the game to win. And t bagging, body blocking, disconnecting and screwing over team mates for shits and giggles. That's toxic. 
---
Looping at a pallet, Not toxic t bagging after every pallet like you're hot shit. That's toxic. Leaving a survivor on the hook to do a gen. That might be smart if they have time. Letting a survivor die because "i Ne3D 2 sElF cArE" that's throwing the game.
---
He's been on and off recently. But yes, I will eventually
---
I think June 18th
---
I can totally understand where you are coming from and you for sure have some valid points. Being honest, does camping truly work? When I say camping, Im not referencing the killer stopping a survivor getting another off the hook. I am strictly speaking about face camping where you are just standing up front of the hook. Like you said, this isn't practical because it gives the survivors more time to run the generators. So, you could say face camping is a dumb strategy right? Well only dumb people use dumb strategies. It is uneffective and is a big waste of time. So for the sake of fun, a killer avoiding doing this by the means of their own self interest is something what I call nice. They aren't wasting my time (I play this game for the challenge) which means a much more active fun game. Maybe I have been lucky, but the matches I have played, I only experienced very few campers. I have not seen much hate mail either while playing both killer and survivor. Anyways, still my personal opinion, but I so far like almost everyone that I have played with or interacted with.

Sprint Burst so OP man! Its almost in the top 4 out of the 5 exhaustion perks

Fuck you man. Jeff is godlike. Like Jesus on the mist
---
I stopped reading when you actually just said "theres no point in making their life worse" when referring to a face camping killer because they lose points for being near a hook.... gtfo and go play something you are the problem.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Blood points, usually. Killer stuns are 1k each and for survivors in a losing game, any bit counts. And they're giving you the opportunity for destruction points as well. Sometimes, what looks like BMing is just trying to salvage a bad match.
---
(But if they're t-bagging, just eat their sweetbreads.)
---
idk when i got hooked they all swarmed me though, i ended up doing the last gen and we all escaped
---
The amount of times I see Monstrous Shrine in post 50 blood webs when looking for specific perks. I finally bought it when the other option was territorial imperative just so it would stop showing up. 
---
Survivor dalies should not be linked to a specific survivor, its all the same shit just let me play the one that I like/have perks on.
---
Do you have to buy hag? I got her for free so that's a bit weird. I love playing her though, she's very fun
---
This is honestly one of the worst responses I've read. I cant even try to break down your shitty argument because you're just dillusional. Play survivor you donkey. Stop bitching about how hard killers have you. You literally suck at the game if you have trouble killing people and genuinely feel this strongly about it. It's disgusting. You have a giant blade and move way faster than players that literally cannot fight you back. Dumb response. Next.
---
The most efficient way to play killer :) Gets boring after a while, at least it did for me. Nowadays i just play to max BP *per game* (i mean if i wanted fast bp gains, slug 4k's are the fastest, especially if/when survivors start DCing, thus the "per game").

My current build is BBQ, Nurse's Calling, Infectious Fright &amp; Deerstalker

I play legion at red ranks, the only killer I do better with is billy and 9/10 times the game lasts 5 minutes with 1 or 2 gens getting done. If I want to 2x pip I play legion.
---
Focus on injuring healthy people with frenzy over actually downing them. I know it doesn't sound effective but it is. Making them mend is tedious and wastes time for them. They have to mend, then they'll probably heal and if they don't he's a 115% killer now so it's a very easy down. If you're chasing a survivor and run past a gen with 2 people on it, frenzy all of them then chase the last one you frenzy. That's why I love discordance on him because it allows you to find grouped survivors very easily. You could also try stbfl you get tokens very quickly with frenzy.
---
if I recall correctly, some console gets hag for free
---
Why not run TOTH and HG so they think it’s an actually important hex and cleanse it 
---
Thanks. This is the best play I've had as survivor and I will never have another like this.
---
Hag has a solid learning curve. she's very fun once you learn how to play her
---
I feel Spirit is the killer with the most mindgames and stuff to her I've never really liked playing the Spirit but I can definitely see why people like her so out of those 2 I'd say Spirit
---
Dude once again 3rd comment. I just want to say I'm actually baffled at your response and it shows how biased you are when talking about this. You dont understand survivor gameplay in the slightest and you sound like a rank 17 killer. Move your fucking ass out of here with your cringe defense for killers and their precious bps that they deserve for camping?? Smfh.
---
I kinda disagree with this. At higher ranks more experienced survivors don't really heal too much anyway as it wastes time, they do gens instead.
---
With the removal of the indicator you'd basically have a better Unbrakable. They'd still have 2 health states for the first chase, and after that it'd never be safe to slug anyone.
---
\^ solid response
---
But she gets rocked at any rank above 12 because everybody is running urban immersion. I’d highly recommend spirit or pig based off of my own experience. Or maybe check out Freddy because his rework will be out soon and you can play bad Freddy while you still can
---
It should merge with WGLF.
---
Omfg 😂 Low key still wish this was her scream
---
That's what happend in the end.  
---
Those were some lousy teammates, leaving each other to dry, when I don't even camp in the slightest.
---
I just like to chill a bit when someone DCs early because it's unfair towards their teammates but holy fork.
---
Maybe I'm wrong, but freddy still seems to be very weak. Slowing down people might've worked a couple of years ago, but todays meta is about being able to catch people really fast and winning chases. Traps that slow you down or dream pallets probably aren't that great. But I guess we need to try it out first.
---
Legion has all the problems plauge has apart from height but doesnt cause much damage if a survivor heals unlike plauge. If survivors refuse to heal he is just an M1 killer.
---
And he’s better than most, if not every other M1 killer.
---
Myers has nothing on Acey-poo
---
Nobody that knows what theyre doing uses UE past rank 5, Hag is A tier and can seriously wreck if youre smart
---
Some people don't want to farm, they don't want to 'lol mess around', they just want to play the game to the full potential of it's challenges, because that's what they enjoy doing. And that includes playing against the Killer, even if said Killer has shown mercy or indicated that he wants to farm or anything similar.
---
Go for the spirit. It’s so fun to mindgame at loops and pallets. Just the feeling grabbing a “sneaky” survivor off a pallet while faking to phase is hilarious.
---
I think its stated it doesnt force any killers to come to its realm but talks them into it or persuades them
---
They are still probably making last minute changes.  I'm expecting us not to get any information until Thursday at this point.  If they try to wait until launch though to say anything then yes, i will be very upset with how this is being handled.
---
No the entity takes killers so it can use them in the trials to slowly eat the souls of the survivors so it can get strong enough to take over the world
---
Did you ever hear the noises he makes? He oinks more than pig herself
---
But we don't want to buy and use crappy perks... It's only irritating.
---
I don’t think they’d make the changes live right in the middle of the PTB
---
Didn't they say they probably weren't going to finish the changes to Ghostface when he comes out I swear they said that on the Q&amp;A stream.
---
It's actually been stated by the devs that the entity tortures any killers not willing to work for it until they consent to do so.
---
Intense notification is useless why would you want something that blocks the screen that long oof, the speed boost one is the same because of the wipe animation after hit negates the whole perk. And the final one has the issue of skill checks not highly effecting upper ranks. Nice perk icons tho, but joker wouldn't fit this game at all
---
Oh I guess that's what persuasion means haha
---
Ash would literally just strap a body cam to himself and film himself killing demons as his YouTube content, so this is accurate
---
Watch last Thursday's Q&amp;A. They *are* making changes, but they are unlikely to be ready before the PTB closes this week. They have, however, confirmed the changes will be ready for launch.
---
Ah, I New she was a DLC chapter but couldn’t remember if it was free.
---
EZ GG
---
The killer can just target the person unhooking. The same struggle with exist to save the camped player but not people are more incentivized to actually do it because the player getting camped can have a chance with borrowed. The killer has to do a better job of not letting the unhook happen. Rather then him just face camping and all your team just dies trying to save you in order to prevent you from having a terrible gaming experience. Killer mains always have the same response
---
Huh
---
I’m smiling right now because for an entire game I thought the spirit was phase walking around me when it was really just Ash wheezing
---
I thought I was the only one 😂
---
I literally had to put my phone down after reading that.
---
I'm disturbed.
---
I have it on my david build.
---
Y'know for whenever i wanna have a really hard challenge
---
Foggy Mirror?
---
I hope you don’t genuinely believe that doctor shuts down anything except the occasional window and the unsafe loops. Play doctor against real survivors or ask your favorite streamer and they will explain this fact to you. 
---
I hope you don’t genuinely believe wraith gets a free first hit and that his speed boost matters on anything but unsafe loops. 
---
I hope you don’t genuinely believe trappers strength is mind gaming loops. Holding a trap to “mind game loops” means you’re not placing them anywhere and you’re a standard M1 killer with NO free first hit. 
---
I hope you don’t genuinely believe Pig’s ambush matters on safer loops against real players, plus her RNG element makes your comment meh at best. 
---
I hope you don’t genuinely believe that Freddy has anything remotely powerful without pill bottle add on. Freddy has as much of a “free hit” as wraith does. 
---
Legion gets a free first hit in 9.8/10 situations and can easily injure people often times. On top of this, they have to spend time mending and leaving all survivors injured unless they waste loads of time in order to heal. I’ll take legion over any M1 killer other than Michael or Plague.
---
Which would makes sense considering the description of the skill.
---
It's not really toxic when an exit is about to be open especially if you have no way to one shot the survivor opening in there's no point in wasting your time.
---
And in the time it takes for them to try to deal with the gate you could have very easily been saved and body blocked so camping was pretty much the best strategy they had
---
Tbh 50% less noisy doesn't change much from the killer perspective - I still hear them unless they are in lockers
---
Me and my friends use it for this thing called the “Bitch Lasagna” build where we put No Mither, Self Care and 2 other Obsession Perks. Then for our item we bring a Med Kit with insta heals. We bring whatever offering we want tbh. Then we also have to wear either the brightest clothes or the darkest clothes (kinda depends on how we feel) and if we escape we just yell “BITCH LASAGNA”. Were basically asking for death lmao.
---
Jane's dad confirm the to also be thicc
---
If something doesn't say 'stacks', then assume they stack. The only way something wouldn't stack is if it explicitly says 'Does not stack'.
---
Skill:100
---
congrats, now you get to think about that every time you get chased by him!
---
unless you're a killer main, in that case you're probably never going to play as him again
---
I can accept a lot of this but a few things (other than Jeff which everyone has already stated):
---
1) Jane should be F. I hate her so much...
---
2)I like Ace but why is he so high?
---
3) How is Kate not S??
---
When they complain about you running NOED, but game ended with only 2 completed gens.
---
Jane SS tier. That booty.
---
No true words were ever spoken
---
It's been such a long time since I've seen a smol Billy
---
Iron Will doesn't work for downed state btw
---
Big boy Myers will now forever haunt me. Thanks
---
The clown cracks me up every time
---
If you go to a character, Character Info page, and hover over the lock icon next to their unique perks, it will tell you how to get the perk teachable.
---
For Decisive Strike, the only ways to make it teachable is to either buy it in Laurie Strode's Bloodweb at Level 40 or to wait and see if it appears in the Shrine of Secrets.
---
No, but it's dumb not to. You get a decent BP bonus for hooking and sacrificing Survivors during the EGC.
---
Jeff is D tier!?
---
*Sad Jesus noises*
---
“Wraith has an easy first hit” is the exact statement you made?? Good thing you don’t want to be a keyboard warrior, not looking good for you thus far. 
---
My point about legion still stands. You didn’t discredit it. If it was as simple as “look around. don’t be near each other, and loop optimally”, legion is still better than every M1 killer outside Myers and Plague. 
---
Despite making multiple claims, you don’t want to provide an actual statement to any of them. Now that’s incredible. 
---
You have a good and productive day now since your time is of the upmost importance.
---
It is not impossible, it happened just yesterday and I talked with other people who confirmed it happened to them too if you get downed too close to the hook. As I already said, I was on the hook before I had the chance to hit the skillcheck. It was almost at the very end of the circle and the Killer was already free to move then.
---
I thought the same as you and was furious when I experienced first-hand that the perk does not work as advertised. First time using DS since the change as I was constantly getting camped and tunneled that day and wanted to counter that.  It's shit and should be fixed.
---
It's kinda a noob perk IDH, it's great for learning pallet and window locations, but if you can learn the locations you can then replace the perk with something more better.
---
angry ghost monster noises
---
But it's lovely how you're immediately thinking that it was my fault when I clearly stated I had no chance to hit the skillcheck to begin with.
---
They're both fun. I main The Pig myself.
---
Why all girls isn't in S tier?
---
All other killers have something they can use mid chase to counter being loops, legion dose not. Thats my statement.
---
That's what really brought them together, their need to share an inhaler.
---
The joke is that you would neither play as or encounter a nurse due to a supposed and and not backed up opinion that you are a low rank PS4 player
---
I mean, technically you are. This perk is really geared towards newer players and it helps newer players learn more. 
---
On the bright side at least you won’t run into an area where you think a pallet is only to find disappointment.
---
That sounds like a serious workout, some really good cardio, shifting your husk of a soul through the plain of nightmares.

---
My DH was cleansed almost everytime, so I got better results with HG
---
AFK teammates that hide until hatch and when the hatch does open and tell them “hey at least try to do gens” and then they ( the afk and the killer ) both call you stupid and other rude things because you just want a teammate 😥
---
See, now you have a fairly correct statement. Not all killers do, but not bad nevertheless. I don’t know if counter is the right word, I’d prefer interact, but it’s a lot closer to a valid point.
---
I'm going to miss old Freddy. Excited for essentially a new killer that I already 'own', but even though Freddy rarely won me 4ks, I found him fun to play. Pulling into the dream world, knowing where everyone is even on the other side of the map. 
---
I'm sure I'll be happy with nuFreddy, but I wish they could have just buffed him and kept his powerset the same. Maybe the base transition takes less time, and if all four people get dreamed at the same time you can instadown the first one you hit.
---
Use whatever you want. It's good even if you know where pallets are because you know which pallets got destroyed. So for example you see a jungle gym but the pallet is already destroyed so you don't run there. If you don't have this perk you may run there and end up being downed because there's nothing there.
---
Okay, I give up. You clearly just want People to agree with you.
---
Depends on what you mean by "rely" and "do well". If your teammates are garbage, constantly getting hooked and hit, you can easily pip/Do Well from unhooking/healing/escaping or evading the killer and then taking the hatch out. I wouldn't really call that "relying" personally because you're mostly just making the best of their incompetence.
---
The problem is that Survivors won't let the Killer get away from the hook.
---
End of the day, if you're getting tunnelled, get better at chases. With patch 3.0.0 you'll get Gatekeeper points when people repair gens and cleanse totems while you're being chased.
---
The game has plenty of stuff already to discourage tunnelling: BBQ &amp; Chili, Make Your Choice, the Emblem System, D-Strike, etc.
---
Don't forget audio glitches (like not hearing anything through jungle gym walls).
---
It changes a lot actually. I play Ace and he is already pretty quiet. Contrary to iron will, No Mither also makes you less noisy while downed. I've managed to crawl away (with tenacity) many times because the killer simply could not hear me and there was no blood trail to follow
---
Both Hag and Spirit and fun and viable so I think either would be a great choice. They both have one or two great perks to unlock, too.
---
I actually think a costume with traditional chinese clothes would be way nicer. With a mask just like in the fifth movie http://imgur.com/gallery/YKnMYE6
---
 But yes, this is a really cute oink
---
I don't understand the problem
---
If the killer is good at the game and decides you should die. He will kill you and camp you. That's the problem. I'm a rank 1 survivor and absolutely insane at looping but i cant loop forever against a good killer. He can have you down in 45 seconds regardless of how good you think you are. Then proceed to ruin your gaming experience by camping since theres no base kit mechanics to protect you from this.
---
Did you just say the survivors wont LET the killer leave the hook? Are you fucking insane?
---
Sorry for assuming, but people can be crazy on Reddit.
---
And a little puff of smoke fun his chest wound.
---
&gt; that fucking dumb ass log
---
Just today i bumped into that stupid log because there's bamboo in front of it and rocks on both sides so you'd imagine you can go through, luckily the killer was just far enough so i could go around (the killer actually bumped into the log too lol).
---
Lmao why doesn’t this happen to me?
---
Exactly why I said it lmao. I would like Danny Devito in the game more than anyone else yet I wouldn't harass him for it.
---
Idk why ppl says it's a noon perk, in all honestly don't listen to ppl who tell u it is because chances are they all use perks like Self Care, Adrenaline, Dead Hard, MoM, NoED, Ruin, and BBQ. So they likely just tell u that to make u feel like a noob. And honestly if it IS considered a noob perk then I guess half of the perks on the game can be considered noob perks.. 
---
Also, like other comments are saying, it actually helps u see if pallets have been used or not so u can avoid screwing urself over. Anyway, just use the perks u want and use perks that help u that's what they are there for and with that good luck on ur games.
---
Prob means you're a bad killer. No ones cheering for you btw killer you're alone.
---
Even with that change I don't see why anyone would use no mither. I guess if stealth were more viable it could be a good perk combined with that perk that lets you repair faster while injured. 
---
But even then, I'm not seeing a viable usage case for always being a 1-hit down and being able to pick yourself up. Even if the killer didn't know you had no mither, it's rare that you would be left slugged.
---
I'd buy him just because I'd have the new weakest killer. I've kinda brought it upon myself to take what the community sees as the "worst killer" and make them work.
---
If he were to stay in his current state, it'd be more than a challenge to say the least.
---
If someone manages to Kobe off of the hook. I always respect and let them get away at least for a few seconds.
---
Lol, how often do you go hitless in a trial? The synergy is not "destroyed" but barely delayed.
---
I don't think it really matters. Was slugging a lot more common in the past or something? Slugging isn't something that I see happen all that often(or at least not long enough for someone to self-recover) so it's extremely niche at best.
---
Make me
---
i mean if he doesnt waste those few seconds to chase you out, you may interfere later. You can buy the last ones precious seconds
---
Honestly, a way to alleviate this without creating an imbalance would be to start every character with their own unique perks AND the universal perks (Spies from the Shadows, Lightweight, etc.) at Tier 3. That would at least eliminate some of the grind, but not so much so that it undercuts it completely.
---
okay
---
Survivors: *Looks at you funny*
---
Killer: HOW DARE YOU
---
Staying in that room with the TR approaching is a death sentence
---
why? Why would you respect luck?
---
And this was deliverance ^^
---
You're a donkey with no concept of how dbd actually functions. Next.
---
Lol, “this generation of young gamers”. Okay grandpa. Stop falling for obvious bait, stop tunnelling people off hook, and git gud. Or I guess you could just whine about how everyone who’s better than you is a big meanie cheater and languish in mediocrity and victim hood forever.
---
Just always felt cheap to me to hit them immediately after they beat their 4% chance. That’s just me though.
---
Just break it even if it is HG. Someone else will get that 1K BP if you don't.
---
I disagree with this change, but not because the suggestion is bad. I think No Mither just needs a complete rework or should give you a huge advantage due to its downside like an “opposite” effect of the perk dying light. So with that you would actually have a good reason to use the perk, with increased action speeds in all categories.
---
Thank you.  I only started to play her since I came back and she seemed super good.  I'm really a big fan of the trapper so I really enjoy her play style.
---
Scream 3, in case anyone's wondering
---
well thats just luck, nothing related to skill or anything
---
Survivors.
---
I do this sometimes, but only to prolong chase. I deserve death afterwards if I get caught. (Except flashlight I don't do that shit. I use insta heal)
---
If.
---
Downvote me!!
---
“No one agrees with me so you don’t know how to play the game”. 
---
I think once you become a junior in high school, you start writing persuasive essays. Should help ya out a bit, come back then.
---
Can someone draw me a fucking graph explaining how to loop the jungle gyms and L-wall T-wall tiles both as killer and as survivor? I definitely feel this meme when I'm running those.
---
Yup. He’s a stand alone killer. BBQ and Chili is the best perk for leveling up. Survivor equivalent is We’re Gonna Live Forever from David King, but it’s less consistent and forces you to compete for unhooks and make unsafe body blocks.
---
I’d definitely recommend BBQ though. This is the order I’d level up killers and why.
---
Leatherface: BBQ and Chili and Franklins Demise.
---
Hag: Ruin
---
Nurse: Nurses Calling and Thanataphobia
---
Doctor: Monitor and Abuse (important for Myers)
---
-You can probably go in any order after this.
---
Hillbilly: Enduring
---
Spirit: Haunted Grounds and Spirit Fury
---
Trapper: Brutal Strength
---
So on and so on lol
---
Adrenaline activates, but goes on hold, even if you're hooked doesn't it? So you unhook at full health. I think "staying alive (aka playing well)" and "being on a hook" don't quite go together.
---
Kate could legit just use her boobs as clickbait
---
What movie is this?
---
I never said it was related to skill. Regardless, it’s nice to let them feel lucky for a second or two.
---
Welcome to the good side.
---
Humblebrag award of the day. This man never loses a game.
---
Apparently, according to a Dev who was in Bahroo's stream, the purpose of it is to be run with the straight line add-on so that it creates the Φ symbol. 
---
Why anyone would ever want to do that I still have no idea.
---
Killer: Tbagging survivors, constant blinding, survivors who were lucky to survive then act like little cocky punks at the gate/hatch, SWF killing themselves so their friend gets hatch, 4gens being done in 2 minutes.
---
Survivor: Facecamping, Proxy Camping, Tunneling, Slugging (extended duration of time meaning done 2-4 ppl before hooking anyone), head nodding/hitting me on hook to taunt (If it's a pig that goes for the t-bag/growl spam), Getting hit 3meters away from a window I just vaulted, Killer gets 4k Thanks to NoED, and finally the SAME LOADOUT with an exception to one perk EVERY GAME (usually Ruin, BBQ, NoED and Nurses Calling. There's always 2-3 of these perks in every killer loadout).
---
That's a lot of stuff I know lol. But let's be honest, all these things has had everyone AT LEAST annoyed at some point.
---
It's Killing Eve
---
Best part of the entire movie lol
---
I cleanse. HG doesnt last that long. Run better and you won't get insta downed. Lol 9 times out of 10 the killer is chasing an injured person so they're  going down at next hit no matter what.
---
i would agree
---
thank you. are there any killers or survivors i should ignore?
---
Oh shit I think that's me. That happened to me the other day and I just looked at him when he seoppes the pallet.
---
Yeah, imo nimble and the drill skills are pretty much necessary
---
I was mimicking the post but sure. Looping and blinding isn't toxic. T bagging, farming, sending hate or disconnecting is toxic. The post is saying it's okay to be toxic against leatherface because they might camp. So if I play leatherface, the survivors might be toxic because they think I'll camp and the best way to deal with a group of toxic survivors is to camp.
---
Are you going to offer anything whatsoever to back up your point or just continue replying with "nah-uh!" ?
---
Probably new players. Instead of saying “gg” and moving on, they love to accuse other people of stupid stuff they didn’t even do. Or just have no concept of how the game works and thinks what you did was unfair.
---
For everyone that has accused people of toxic looping, gen rushing, tunneling, slugging or camping when they weren’t, that’s pointed at you.
---
25 with a bachelors degree in computer science, rank 1 killer and survivor. Many many MANY people agree with me. You just simply are coming from a biased point of view and its blatantly obvious. Your argument is so weak its nonexistent. Next. You failed to change my mind.
---
Did you bother reading? He already agreed with my point.
---
No you dumb fuck, I'm saying the killer isn't actually that fast.
---
Villanelle would be a great killer! Loads of cool outfits and tons of potential moris.
---
Ik what u were saying lol, I was just adding onto it xD. It's one of those "then again" or "to be fair" types of comments
---
Then quit acting like a child and use some of that education to make a more compelling argument than “I can kill you, Rhee” and “you’re wrong I’m right”. I haven’t taken a single post of yours seriously. You just look like a dumbass and everyone else here thinks so too.
---
Killers: Survivors should leave the match immediately. It's toxic and I just want to go to the next match.
---
Also Killers: Lol just wait around it's only a couple minutes why are you so mad? XD
---
If you feel like you can loop the killer indefinitely then how do you ever get caught, you dumb fuck?
---
hillbilly all the way
---
Read my responses, you illiterate donkey. Then come back with something of substance to say.
---
You shouldn't if you do everything right but mistakes are made and my ass ends up on the hook.
---
No problem. I’d say Freddy as his perks are mediocre and he’s even more mediocre as a killer at high ranks but they’re reworking him.
---
Clown is useful for Cauldrophobia and Bamboozle. Bamboozle is very good and I actually forgot to put him in the list for that alone. It helps end loops pretty fast. Clown himself is pretty bad though. 
---
Survivors rank up Claudette first. She’s probably the best survivor in the game due to how hard it is to see her in the dark, and Self-Care and Botany Knowledge is incredibly useful. Empathy is too. 
---
I don’t know who you would want to avoid as survivor though. Maybe David Tapp?
---
You havent taken any post seriously because you're an ignorant donkey with no concept of the subject matter. Next.
---
He has a problem.

If you have either Hex: Ruin or Spirit Fury but not both, get the other killer.
---
If it's a tossup, spirit is a lot of fun and I prefer her, but hag is apparently powerful too. Spirit needs good reactions and excellent hearing/situational awareness, hag needs to always be thinking seven moves ahead.
---
When is the update coming?
---
sounds like a solid theory
---
Hex ruin, haunted grounds, make your choice and pop goes the weasel is my current build, just prestige so don't have many perks, probably going to change make your choice for BBQ and chilli.
---
Ghost face sounds like he’s smoked for several centuries and can barely handle any weight being placed on him
---
I always cleanse Hex Totems lol. No Ruin? Cleanse! Ruin? Cleanse! All Dull? Cleanse! I ain't taking ANY chances of there being Devour Hope, NoED or any other Hex Perks. Plus that's an extra 1k lol why not?
---
toxic survivors
---
when I play killer, I try never to do so much as proxy, let alone face camp and tunnel, but when you still get tbags and flash light spam, it hits ya right in the feels
---
as survivor, i hate seeing my teammates gloat. They aren't as good as they think they are, and they def shouldn't be trying to make the killer feel like shit, he's just someone trying to play the game too
---
thank you, i’ll definitely be using this info
---
Maybe the pallets have the same temperature and consistency
---
*Buddy i’m an engineer.*
---
The game is literally designed for the killer to eventually catch up outside of a couple specific infinites that the devs occasionally try to patch out.
---
Your statement is the exact opposite of truth.
---
Red arremer for dead by daylight.
---
the universe sensed the tbag and smite you. Ik it was to your teammates, but its just like **T-BAG DETECTED, FIRE MORI**
---
Yea.. that’s what I thought. Enjoy your failed thread.
---
: (
---
This is a terrible argument against self-care.
---
First:
---
&gt;Self-care or not, the game will always be lost no matter how good you are if you have unreliable teammates.
---
This argument has nothing to do with self-care and does not address the point.  The point is, self-care helps when your teammates are unreliable.  The fact that unreliable teammates make the game difficult overall is not raionally related to the power level or usefulness of self-care to the individual running it.
---
Second:
---
&gt;Perks are much more valuable than items in assisting the team. Yet medkits are much more efficient and practical than the self-care perk.
---
First of all, perks are not always more valuable than items.  Given the appropriate situation, a key is more valuable to the team than any perk in the game.  Second, while medkits are more efficient than self-care, they are finite and they clash visually with most backgrounds in the game.  They can give away your position to an observant killer.  I’m not saying you’re “wrong” on this point, this does at least address the merits of self-care, I’m just saying there are valid points on both sides of the “self-care vs medkit” debate.
---
Third:
---
&gt;Nothing wrong with progressing the game while injured.
---
This is a complete straw man and does not address the point at all.  No one said there’s anything wrong with progresssing the game while injured.  The point is, being injured makes the game much more difficult because you’re leaving a blood trail, you’re making grunts of pain, and you’re one hit from dying state.  It’s obviously harder to play the game while injured and self-care is a perk that helps avoid being in the injured state.
---
Fourth:
---
&gt;That and most self-carers run to the back corner of the map to heal up thinking they are safe, when in reality, they put themselves in an incredibly vulnerable position and are more than likely to get downed again and becoming an incredible liability to the team. All thanks to self-care.
---
Again, this does not address anything to do with self-care.  Just because people use self-care poorly sometimes does not make self-care a bad perk.  Lots of people deadhard into trees and walls and get themselves killed, but that does not make deadhard a bad perk.  It makes them bad survivors.  Self-caring in a bad position or at a time that is disadvantageous to the team is not a weakness of self-care, it is a weakness of the survivor.
---
Self-care was, is, and will be for the foreseeable future the most played survivor perk because it is incredibly useful.
---
I actually think it would instantly kill you if you tried it without the entities help. The nurse experiences severe pain doing, and I imagine she only survives the endeavor because the entity protects her
---
Honestly I think it's both, I mean yes Lag has a big part in it and can contribute to the "phantom range" or whatever. But there's no way ALL killers have a lag especially when u can clearly see how good their connection is and u don't see any lag spikes in game or in lobby screen. When u get in game with one of these good connection killers, and u juke or vault a pallet/window and still get hit even tho u shouldn't have, like doing a 360 and the killer swings past u or is turned the opposite way but u still get hit, or u vault a window and start running only to get downed 2 meters away. That's either a very big coincidence that the connection would lag at that exact moment oooooorrr... It's trashy hitboxes. I'mma say it's hit boxes. Then if u add in another killer with bad ping with these trashy hitboxes then ur in for a Paranormal looking time.
---
Who cares. Doesn’t matter what perk you use, people will talk shit about it. Killer or survivor.
---
Especially as a survivor, given that you have one exhaustion perk, use whatever perks you want.
---
No problem. You’ll learn a lot by playing, but you can also learn so much from watching YouTubers. I would recommend TydeTyme as he’s very informative in his videos. Tru3Talent is great to pick up certain techniques from but he’s less informative. He will give good tips sometimes though like avoiding certain chases or ignoring a survivor, or good decision making like downing a survivor and going for a nearby one too.
---
If you don't constantly play in a flex on em state, then killer or survivor, you're gonna get flexed on.
---
Against potatoes that duo gens. There's a reason nobody uses shroud of separation.
---
This would be good, but most players just kinda get use too it and learn the numbers after certain play time. I agree it’s annoying at first but you get use too it. Trust me, there are much more important things too fix for QoL then item descriptions xD.
---
It can be a great tool for keeping track of chases as well - seeing a palette go down you know there's (probably) someone in a chase. I used to run it with Lithe, Dance With Me, and Quick &amp; Quiet for a full windows disappearing act.
---
Successful until so.eone changes my mind. You failed miserably. Next.
---
Don’t worry, that Dwight can handle getting downed one time if it isn’t DH
---
Tips for Spirit :
---
Survivors can't see your vault animation, so you should use that to mind game them at the shack or at jungle gyms. If you put your Husk in front of a window, they need to guess if you vault, phasing or just standing still. The shack, one of the strongest loops in the game, become very weak against Spirit just because of that.
---
Your Husk has collision, so that mean you can block pallets or windows with it. You shouldn't do that all the time, especially at loops where is already easy to mind game survivors, but if you want to make survivors leave a loop, use your Husk to block that pallet.
---
You have collision with survivors while phasing, so if you get stuck in an invisible thing while phasing, a survivor is probably there.
---
Use sounds from grunts of pains, breathing or footsteps, grass, crows or even your collision to track survivors while phasing. 
---
There are probably more tips, but these are the basic ones.
---
id want like seperate point options. So we could tell between "go over there" and "the killer is over there"
---
I had this conversation earlier with somebody else. 
---
Read my replies to him if you care deeply. 
---
But if you think most M1 killers are better than legion, you are the potato. Especially since survivors tend to spawn much closer if you have a hex totem.
---
That's not how it works in DBD
---
Looking cool Joker!
---
Teammates that dc or auto kill themselves because they're getting camped for 1 second when their whole hook time would have resulted in 4 gens being done and them most likely being saved with BT.
---
This is not fuckin metal
---
Soft patrolling
---
I'm still waiting for a good argument killers.
---
lags can be caused either by your or killer's internet connection having problems
---
He apologizes every time he makes a mistake. He'd be the anxious Bob Ross.
---
Side note: Anyone else ever notice the metalheads who dress up at concerts usually tend to be the nicest guys and tend to look out for everyone?
---
you can. survivors can get trapped in a corner
---
I'd watch the hell out of that D tier which has all the cuties on it.
---
the doctor buff we needed
---
&gt; This argument has nothing to do with self-care and does not address the point.  The point is, self-care helps when your teammates are unreliable.  The fact that unreliable teammates make the game difficult overall is not raionally related to the power level or usefulness of self-care to the individual running it.
---
I was merely addressing the issue of having unreliable teammates that was brought up. I personally go into games expecting my teammates to be reliable. I don’t want to waste a perk-slot on the chance that they are unreliable. Yes I will have games with useless teammates. But I’m not going to run self-care every game expecting useless teammates every time. Because self-care turns into a wasted perk if I have dependable teammates.
---
  &gt;  This is a complete straw man and does not address the point at all.  No one said there’s anything wrong with progresssing the game while injured.  The point is, being injured makes the game much more difficult because you’re leaving a blood trail, you’re making grunts of pain, and you’re one hit from dying state.  It’s obviously harder to play the game while injured and self-care is a perk that helps avoid being in the injured state.
---
 
---
I was addressing the original straw man that injured survivors *have* to run around looking for teammates to get healed or loot a chest. Just progress the game injured. If you have teammates that are dependable, then you don’t have to worry about playing the game injured as teammates can remedy that. Teammates are a “perk” that avoid the injured state. 
---
&gt; Again, this does not address anything to do with self-care.  Just because people use self-care poorly sometimes does not make self-care a bad perk.  Lots of people deadhard into trees and walls and get themselves killed, but that does not make deadhard a bad perk.  It makes them bad survivors.  Self-caring in a bad position or at a time that is disadvantageous to the team is not a weakness of self-care, it is a weakness of the survivor.
---
Even at best, a survivor has to react while self-caring after already hearing the terror radius. You *cant* react in time to avoid having your aura be shown for at least a split second. 32 seconds is more than enough time for a killer traverse the map and find that aura. This is a huge problem with self-care that many do not acknowledge.
---
&gt; Self-care was, is, and will be for the foreseeable future the most played survivor perk because it is incredibly useful.
---
Oh I agree it will be used. But not because it’s incredibly useful. But because of survivor lone-wolf mentality and hesitance to trust random teammates.
---
Yes because of all the other hex perks.
---
Nope. Use whatever you like and have fun.
---
It has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you are a good or bad person. Plenty of good people have legitimate reasons for wanting to safeguard their creations.
---
Also, plenty of companies love parodies, since they are essentially free promotion or advertisement. It all depends on how the parody is done. Is it an absolutely moronic, insulting tirade of soiling your original work under the guise of "parody"? Or is it a, despite critically brave, respectful satire like Weird Al' Yankovic?
---
Legion good. Legion cosmetic good. Legion have bad perk but that okay because legion still power good in right hands.
---
I think that Bill could become a big time Minecraft streamer.

That's very good for you that you never encountered it but it does happen. Run and do gens? I did that, survivors brought the killer to me through loud noises so he could kick the gen. I couldn't get away from them, I was trying to finish 4 fucking gens on my own with my team actively working against me and the killer kicking anything I touched. If he was late to the party they'd just hop on and fail skillchecks. Tell me please what way I have out of this situation other than disconnecting?
---
I think Brenda from Scary movie would be the best “This some scurry shit!”
---
People play however they want to play. Just because you want chill, doesn't mean everyone does. Where are far better games for chill gameplay.
---
I feel like killers just refuse to accept the fact that 4 solo survivors will cue in together the same as a 4 man SWF. I’m with you though, Lobby dodging is ridiculous with these wait times.
---
The game is actually built for survivors to not be communicating with each other, and for the risk of fellow teammates perhaps not being as good as you want them to be. The Steam page even says this. Everyone seems to think teammates have to be good all the time, but yet another problem with SWF is that it allows the survivor team to be *far* more efficient than they were ever supposed to be in the first place.
---
Clearly you haven't seen DICE, Bethesda, Wargaming, Overkill, 343 Industries, Bioware, Capcom, etc.

Tf2 hasn't gotten a major update in over 500 days. We are doing quite good honestly.

I have no quarrel with you

Then that's a solo player issue, not a killer issue.

Imagine the community playing Halo or Battlefield.

If someone's in a Chase and they've already been hit, that's when I usually go for it

no but apparently some of y'all should be with how much you fucken complain

I have seen a similar type of thing on a questionable website. You can ask my assigned FBI agent
---
I know my place after seeing this
---
I forgot to mention this in my comment, DEFINITELY use max sensitivity
---
I'm so sorry, your highness. Not every game company can be a Triple-A developer with countless people on staff, a stupid-huge budget and the ability to crank out another game/expansion every other year.
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
Nurse was made to be played with keyboard and mouse, and in ps4 you can connect but I do not know how exactly
---
I think they did a pretty good job so far.
---
These are my thoughts and opinions, you don’t have to agree.
---
Impossible not to love it, don't ever-ever doubt it &lt;3
---
Can't wait for more surprises from the team! :)
---
Aight Michael, bouta head out
---
Base nurse w/ no perks is still about 50% stronger than any other killer in the game. I'm not sure if I would consider that "fine".
---
Im just saying if they come out with skins and not a fix for ghostface we're gonna see where there priorities are.
---
Yes you can
---
Bloodlust for starters takes way too long to kick in, as a matter of fact, once it's kicked in, you've already taken way too long with this chase. If you keep it up, you're going to lose.
---
Bloodlust goes away after breaking a pallet, unless it's an unsafe pallet (of which a survivor shouldn't be trying to loop once it's down anyway.
---
Yes the window gets blocked off but I'm guessing you're not gonna sit there sucking your toes once its blocked off. You're gonna move onto the next pallet.
---
If you haven't noticed there's a reason why Nurse, Billy, &amp; huntress (and maybe spirit) on certain maps, are the only killers that can do much of anything against good survivors. Because they don't put up with looping.
---
The point is not the loop indefinitely, I'm speaking hyperbolically. You can loop the killer for a very very very long time if you know your shit. Long enough to essentially win the game on your team's side. Especially if it's a bad killer player and or bad killer.
---
I sighed at the placating the main audience (males) part. I'm tired of that trope. This game has been pretty good about making me feel that the female characters aren't objectified, but are their own people. Maybe it's just me whining, but meh. Females play this game, too.
---
Bruh
---
Is there a resource that shows an overhead view of common loop tiles and the ideal paths for both survivor and killer?  I know how to run places like killer shack, for instance, and clutter tiles, but every time I turn a corner in an L-wall T-wall tile I'm faced with three options and I always seem to pick the worst one.
---
I just dont like to be referred to as a dude... like nobody in my life calls me dude...

My favorite comment yet
---
Lololol
---
Second question in this thread: do we have maps for hex totem spawns in various maps, be they for specific spots or some form of "heat map" that shows which areas should be investigated first? I remember some Korean players managed to show that you should always check the North side of the map first in map X or Y, I'm looking for more stuff like that.
---
Ace is the chosen one
---
Going against BBQ + Ruin every.  Fucking. Match.  It's so boring.
---
But it doesn't weaken the character, it makes him stronger.
---
The amount of times I've had my saw cancelled because it got to 99% instead of 100% when I let go of the button is frustrating. Making it like Billy's saw is much better. Plus the only situation where you want to hold his saw is around the hook when someone is coming in for the unhook, at which point you have plenty of time to charge it up.
---
Ok. I like to play survivor so I’ll check out puppets as noob3 hasn’t been very helpful. Thank you.
---
Paper
---
My favourite is bringing a Green Mori, killing one particularly toxic player, and then watching the rest D/C or Give Up because they thought I brought a Pink Mori.
---
What are you on about?
---
\- Updated Leatherface's Chilli Addon description to "Increases nothing by 0%. Flavour text: Come on you can Facecamp the hook what else you want ?!"
---
"Puppers" i kinda understand Noob3 kinda just does it and if you understand the game you be able to copy.
---
It’s a lot easier to do it yourself in Microsoft paint. Draw a TL wall and pick your paths. TL walls are incredibly simple though: If the killer doesn’t force you to make a real decision you should just fast vault in between the two windows.
---
Hey! I was that dwight's! I was super pissed when I missed lol
---
I see you are very intent on missing the point. *You just lost that loop.* The place just became a dead zone. Next survivor that gets chased towards there is getting smacked. Are you the type of player that intentionally aggros the killer early on, continually leads them towards pallet loops without attempting to break chase, then laments how shit his team is when they get downed because you dropped all the good pallets?
---
Try having an idiot on your team waste all the pallets and then show me how you can loop the killer indefinitely.
---
Nah never pissed me off lol.  I just think you're a no skill clown.  I've seen your posts on here before where you ebony mori survivors directly off hook while insidious camping.  It is comedic gold that you of all babykiller people would start up a post crying about decisive.  Learn to play git gud and you'll never be decisived again.
---
Typo. That’s the feeling I was getting from noob.
---
Yes please give me gay flamboyant rainbow survivors so I can see them cross-map I want easy win.
---
This takes strategy out of the game.

I'm a killer main, and this would be fine.

Sure, I wouldn’t be against it (if the proceeds go to charities that support the cause).
---
I wouldn’t buy them myself though because I don’t want to make the killer’s job any easier :p
---
Nope i have it on ultra but its never been a problem before, i think it may be a problem with someones internet
---
Yeah, if I'm just standing in the exit gate (and I will be) I'm there to t-bag. I'm not making sure everyone is getting out okay, and I'm about to go knock over the closest pallet and jump back and forth through a window a few times, so buckle up.
---
Tunneling is when they ignore everyone else but you despite easily being able to hit them. It's not a smart strategy imo because it doesn't yield as many bloodpoints.
---
Whst is NOED btw? Sorry I’m new to the game
---
Coming from playing F13. Forgive my ignorance. Can survivors fight back or is it strictly avoidance?
---
Can you send a screenshot?
---
Wasting all the pallets is a mismanagement of resources. That falls under the category of making a mistake.
---
First let's clear this up I never drop a pallet, I'm pretty bad at guessing the killer's lunge and I don't like using a pallet that someone else is going to need. I just taking the hit and move onto a different loop, hopefully a window one.
---
Wasting all of your pallets in an area is a misuse of resources and it's a mistake. Now that you've made a mistake the killer can exploit it and beat the team's loops not just that survivors'.
---
Here's where you're missing the point. I'm not talking about individual loops, I'm talking about the entire loop, i.e. all the time you spend wasting the killer's time dragging him across the map.
---
At least new DS is useful a solid amount of times.
---
Wow, this perk clearly trumps Spirit Fury !
---
This. I absolutely agree with this.
---
And I'm honestly fine with addons that make the power better but what sparked me to make this post was that many Killers that have been recently added (namely Legion and Plague) have powers which are horrendously weak without addons and are essentially pigeonheld into certain builds (I don't play Plague much since I have bad perks on her and she's buggy as shit, but Legion is essentially forced into duration and either Cooldown or Recharge Speed) in order to be effective. This drastically limits the variety of matches and contributes to a dull and samey feel across all matches. Along with the fact that you essentially have to spend 10000 Bloodpoints per match as Killer for two green addons to be effective this makes the Killer experience very tiresom outside of the regular gameplay loop.
---
I honestly think that Nurse and pre-rework Hag are the best examples of how addons should be designed. The Team Fortress 2 design of "upside counteracted by downside" is a design I think Behavior should go towards. The issue (again) lies in the fact that none of the powers are balanced around this design and reworking all powers from the ground up with this design in mind would be very difficult. But I think it would be very possible as we already have snippits of this design in other Killers, such as Wraith's Windstorm addons which give him faster movement speed in exchage for a slower decloak, and Freddy's Class Photo which exchanges some time to put Survivors to sleep for a *massive* tracking power boost. Ghostface as well also has elements of this design but the vast majority of his addons are just "increase a thing / decrease a thing" which I think really dumbs down the experience as a whole.
---
It'd be cool if you had to earn the silver 25th edition one somehow, like Leatherface's survivor faces.
---
do you have a screenshot of how it looks?
---
*facepalm* so you’d rather a useless perk?
---
*FACEPALM*
---
What is the purpose of a new perk that just screams “use other perks”
---
&gt; while NOED rewards playing shit
---
I don't think all 5 gens being done = the killer is shit. The game requires that all killers lose eventually, otherwise it wouldn't be fun for the survivors at all. Even the best killers have times when the exit gates open and survivors escape.
---
Posted it to youtube if anyone is interested- https://youtu.be/c8Lx38yKrdk
---
OhTofu did a great tutorial on exactly this. Here is a link to one of his videos: https://youtu.be/p6QYjInzLeM
---
Lore-wise, the devs have said that everyone can talk but during trials they don't have time/don't want to make noise and at campfire they don't really have anything to talk about.
---
Your not even wrong. Don’t really understand the downvotes. On the tier list legion is mediocre, and the amount of hits gets everyone more BP.
---
Yeah, but who would want to see the results of a reverse bear trap? Or an Angel Trap?
---
No worries this sub is here to help. My biggest advise is to take every loss as an opportunity to learn. You will get better the more you play and the more perks you learn. 
---
There are a ton of youtube videos that help you learn. HybridPanda and TydeTime are two of my favorite for learning about the mechanics of the game. Hybrid does a weekly shrine watch video that is a recap of news and goes over the perks in the shrine with actual gameplay using them to help you better understand what they do and how you can pair them up. He also is really good and calling out his own mistakes in videos and explaining why. Tyde is more mechanical in his advice and can have a bit of a rough personality with a bit of the his way or the highway tone to his advice. His technique videos are a great way to learn the mechanics of the game though remember your play style will affect how you play. NoTofu is another youtuber who does play review videos and provides commentary/advice on actual games. 
---
My general advise is to do the tutorial. While it is a little outdated it is a good starting point and give you bloodpoints for doing which will help you start leveling characters. For survivors, start with Claudette or Feng. Claudette is the the only survivor who can heal without an item from the start and "Empathy" can help you tell where the killer is based on the injured other survivors. Feng is my overall pick for best starter survivor. She has "Technician" which will help you in learning skill checks where is you miss one you have a 50% chance to not cause the generator to explode. "Alert" is great for knowing what the killer is doing or at through the game. "Lithe" is also amazing in that it is the only exhaustion perk that  you can fully control and useful on all maps.  
---
Killers are bit different Doctor and Hillbilly are my recommended starters. Doctor's power allows you to see any close survivors in his treatment stance. Lower level players have trouble against him but higher level players know how to counter him. His strength for new players is it helps you learn where survivors like to go and hide in chases. Hillbilly is the strongest killer with the lowest skill bar. His power does take some training though it not as much as other top tier killers like nurse and huntress. His only real downside is that some maps cut the legs out on his power. (The Game and The Institute)
---
My last piece of adivce is it is a game that has a wide range of viable playstyles and it will just take time to find yours. Enjoy the game and have fun.
---
Hey OP, i think the killer might be me lmao. Is this clip more than a week old? Im only asking cus im sure ive done this at one point and those are the exact same cosmetics I use on my hillbilly.
---
I kinna want to. Can I also see the shotgin collar?
---
Check the resolution setting in the options. If that's low, try turning it up. If it's already turned all the way up, you'll likely have to increase your graphics preset. Low will generally look way worse in order to run on a larger range of systems.
---
Lol, says the kid that is following me around like a lost puppy. I am actually rank 1 in this trash game that YOU think requires skill; which is quiet hilarious. But hey its cool you were shit in actual comp games and you came on here to try to be a toxic cunt in a 4v1 and you got a little lucky...at least you are not a complete failure. Congrats.
---
Yeah which is when?
---
Except he’s slow asf lol so you can infinite him in a lot of places
---
When Meyers is Teir 1 he is immune to all revealing perks.
---
Scissors
---
You cannot actually hurt/kill the killer, you can only stun then and delay them. A perk like Decisive Strike, for example, will let you stab the killer in the back while they carry you, but that is purely for the stun. They do not have a health bar.
---
Use Shadowborn. 
---
I noticed with Shadowborn, the Clown's nose is visible during his Mori.
---
You must be one of those killers OP talks about. Tell those baby killers to try to get to red ranks with that crap.
---
I think I found Jigsaw.
---
Spinechill, premonition and blood amber doesn't work with myers tier1, also not with freddy at least you are in the dream world
---
So
---
&gt; I just taking the hit and move onto a different loop 
---
&gt; I dunno I always feel like I can loop a killer indefinitely 
---
&gt;\[I can take hits indefinitely\]
---
Are we done here?
---
That’s A pose
---
isn't Dwight just a twinkier Philly D
---
Follow you...lol you post to a sub I'm subscribed to.....your rank is completely inconsequential I've seen your posts I know how you play.  Get enough potatoes and even a crutched out scrub running ebonys and noed and hardcamping will eventually rank up.  You are hot garbage which is why you're on here whining about a completely balanced perk that only punishes babykillers such as yourself.
---
It’s worth cleansing because unless it’s a brand new hag they’re likely running multiple totem perks. Just clear em all out. Even better if you can bash both HG at the same time and make the exposed status overlap.
---
This was 19/12/2018, so yeah definitely a while ago. If it was you, kudos!
---
Your play style is your own. Its nice if you can bring perks to help others but your main focus should be bringing the perks that help you the most. If WoO works for you use it don't worry about what others say.
---
Yea well now you need 3 protection hits. Perk is dead now. It was ok with the safe unhook and 2 protecc hits.
---
Ah yes the old banshee. I honestly loved her scream because it sounded pretty realistic she’s being impaled by a meat hook cmon that’d be painful
---
I was only talking about skill checks. Which are definitely client side. Your statement about Ruin breaking the game unless the killer has fiber is just patently untrue. Do you think most killers have fiber or do most games seem broken to you because of skill checks? I've played against plenty of laggy killers too and skill checks are one of the few things that aren't affected by lag. Lagswitchers might be a different story because that is indeed game breaking, but that wasn't what we were initially talking about.
---
Just google how skill checks are client-side in DBD and you'll find many threads with the same consensus: if you feel you're missing skill checks due to lag, you're suffering from either bad FPS because DBD is horribly optimized (especially the case with Vsync turned on, or consoles) or input/brain delay.
---
Doctor sounds like when you sit down to poo in a public restroom but your balls touch the water
---
Not really
---
Unfortunately for your point, the devs have widened the basement stairs so this is no longer an option.
---
Nurse is so broken, she desperately needs attention.  She's extremely bad for game health.
---
idk about all that. 
---
there is a rank system after all. if you can secure a higher rank by tunneling then by all means knock yourself out.
---

I feel like I'm watching one of those 2009 "Club Penguin Hacks 100% legit" videos with that music.

If I drop an item in a trial and the killer leaves/DC do I lose the item?

---
All fun and games until they down the guy 20 feet from you right as you finish the cleanse
---
Found the surv main
---
Yes. You'll only keep it if it is in your hands when the killer disconnects.
---
Short for No One Escapes Death.
---
I would've done the same as well, but was afraid the guy would DC since the Claud did it when I hit her once and the other guy up there wouldn't have gone for the save if I went for the bill :(. 
---
Also had a task to get bp with a mori and that was the only one I had too so I just decided to get it over with anyway and not risk it.
---
Hey don't ask me. I'm not a dev I'm just posting this for people to find easier
---
Jane, David and Kate all get followers a totally different way than the S tier survivors, if you know what I mean(;
---
He's definitely a C-rank killer. You could probably stand to improve if you feel like you're doing nothing. Get BBQ and Thanataphobia on him.
---
Legit thought he went upstairs while I was using the mori. Didn't even remember about checking for the scratch marks after I saw this xd.
---
Sick loot dude.
---
The scary movie mask is basically the only way you'll coerce me into playing GF at this point.  
---
Which is weird cause I can't even see my clothes as killer
---
You dislike ass and titties?
---
Why is it that every time I play survivor I go up against killers that camp, tunnel and take you across the map to the basement, is it meta??? It's every time, people playing as Billy or cannibal running slug or gen builds but take you to the basement not even playing the game as the certain killer should???
---
No, but it will certainly make me feel better.
---
C R I N G E
---
It's a game. People have fun. Nobody cares if someone goofs around from time to time.
---
Ahh risk it for the Challenge very understandable.
---
Well if you’re Saving bp for Ghostface I’d save quests as well so instead of just 1 mil you can have 1’090,000
---
Also yeah dcs suck.
---
He's asserting dominance
---
Stick to mortal kombat pal
---
Enlighten me. Could you define Gen rushing?
---
to be honest it'd probably never happen because you'd be a beacon on every fucking map
---
He isn't good. Tell me what other killers could've buy beside Legion, so I can tell you if it was a mistake.
---
Rule 1: Cardio
---
Evil Batman killer when?
---
that’s why zombiehugger’s SFM memes are so great
---
I always go to save people cuz I know how annoying it is when the others leave you to die.
---
If no Mither is supposed to be a challenge perk:
---
It should give extra BP to everyone on your team.
---
If No Mither is supposed to be a risk/reward perk:
---
If it gave action speed then I feel it’d be a cheese perk where you hide the whole game and rush gens, unless it’s like leader and gives action speed for everything apart from gens. This is a plausible change imo.
---
I feel like the perk would be best if gave incentive to play risky, such as altruism speed or some other benefit that encourages encounters with the killer, though, as long as it doesn’t encourage a cheese playstyle. Also it’s what David King’s perks are supposed to be.
---
Sure, rank 16. Not even remotly close to competant players, hence why they died.
---
Personally I'd just try out everyone. In order to get all the perks u will have to level them all to 40 anyway so it's best to just test then out and get a feel of how each works. The only other way to get the perks is through the Shrine but each perk costs 2000 Iridescent Shards so it takes longer, and the perks reset once a week and there's only two for each side in it. That being said, idk which route u wanna take, so I'mma suggest wraith, Billy, doctor or trapper. They all are decently easy to use and are perfect for beginners. Just keep in mind that the better perks are learned from other killers, u can buy the teachable perks at 30/35/40 on each killer. Usually they are only for the killer who owns them but once u by them then any killer may learn them through their bloodweb. 
---
As for the killers' I suggested:
---
 Billy is a fast moving killer that can slug a survivor with his hammer or dash across the map and insta down with his chainsaw, that being said he's a VERY overused killer and CAN be a little difficult to control the chainsaw if u aren't careful.
---
Trapper is a basic killer which needs time at the beginning of the match to set his bear traps, efficient yet u need some strategy. I recommend putting then at pallets and windows as well as MAYBE hiding them in tall grass near gens.
---
Doctor is great killer for locating survivors. His shock therapy and static field cause survivors to build up terror and eventually scream reavealing their locations. The more u shock them the more effective his power is. However it doesn't injure them so u have to slug them to down them.
---
Lastly there's Wraith who can go invisible-ish. He's slightly faster when cloaked however u cannot attack until u uncloak. When cloaked they can BARELY see u, it's kinda like a piece of glass moving lol, but if u stand still u will be completely invisible. Other than that he's a slugger just like Doctor. 
---
There's other killers but in my honest opinion these are the easiest to learn. When u get the game just be sure to look at the killers' power and read them before playing so u know whats in store. That being said please do the same with the perks, some perks that other killers have might be great with your killer. Distressing for example is very good for Doctor, if I'm not mistaken it's a Trapper perk tho. Anyway, I hope this helps and good luck out there in the Fog ^^
---
Like a real man
---
Thnx so much
---
Oh god. Early Halo game team chats on Xbox could be absolutely vicious.
---
Start with Wraith, you will find survivors very easy with him and the chases with him are pretty simple.
---
Play both sides don’t see any problems
---
yeah, but if the killer let's you go when you could have died.
---
The least you can do is rescue other survivors instead of letting them die on the hook (which she did).
---
On that subject I will forever miss the Bouquets...
---
I wasn't aware that Michael Tier One had that kind of capability.  I rarely play him but might start now.
---
Oh really now.
---
Lmao yeah
---
Yeah ... but ... on rank 16?
---
I'd mildly understand if I was red rank or green but rank 16.
---
great move! i love a good flashlight save. 
---
When i'm killer it rarely seems to happen though. i see (or worse, just hear) someone attempting to flashlight either too close or at a bad angle.
---
How do I not get murdered by Billy? I find I have the least fun playing against this asshole because I’m constantly getting backrevved. I dont get how youre supposed to get enough distance from him once he’s right on you, especially when he’s backrevving you at a pallet. If I throw it, he instantly breaks it and is back on me, if I don’t he’s right on my arse again. How do I not get rekt by this guy?
---
he's decent and a bloodpoint machine
---
Haunted Grounds ans Ruin work pretty good together,but are just there as a decoy for a real totem perk.
---
Surveillance is too low
---
I dont run it but some people use it in insta down builds
---
Haunted*
---
When I play killer I main Billy.
---
The best way to dodge his chainsaw is to make sure you're close to walls and obstructions, etc. His chainsaw has to be a direct hit in order to down you.
---
Also the turn radius while he's running his chainsaw is horrible, so one quick turn and he'll miss.
---
Annnnnnd.....DC.
---
18
---
The 18th.
---
Aye... Just relaying info to our confused Survivor.
---
Haha look at this badass survivor over here
---
Thanataphobia isn’t the best on him actually. It’s alright in some cases, but that’s really it.
---
I think it should say "but you get ignored and they tunnel the unhooked person"
---
Leatherface sounds like a Tusken Raider
---
18th.
---
yeah you're right right there, i also love the game because of goofballs like that, they are funny lmao.
---
because his power is so insanely weak that unless you are a literal *god* at playing him, facecamping or insidious camping is the only way to get kills. so toxic players tend to play him due to his strength in camping
---
What would you consider a real totem perk? The only ones I ever see are ruin, huntress lullaby, and the one that reveals you when you cleanse it, so I don’t really know what the others are
---
Blood Amber should work because it requires a rare addon and a key so limited use
---
Whoops
---
He's mesmerised by Ace's perfect form
---
I don't think it's top tier, but I think that injured survivors shouldn't be able to perform "protection" blocks for other survivors because they know they can just DS... 60 seconds after the unhook. Not to mention the survivors get to change who the obsession is in the middle of the match, so the person getting "tunneled" (downed repeatedly) may quickly die or force the killer to ignore them based on what obsession perks the killer has.
---
It also keeps the game fun imo. It gets repetetive as shit, so this is always nice thing to see, lol.
---
It’s a dog eat dog world and we’re all wearing bacon pants.
---
who cares its just 2 pips, move on.
---
that's exactly it!, you'd get bored just from dying by a meat hook and escaping all the time, thank god we have some humor to this game.
---
I laughed way too hard at this

So around the time that Ghostface be released
---
"Oh shit, I'm sorry"
---
"Sorry for what?"
---
Bruh moment
---
If u tunnel, at least I would still have more than you :)
---
So you get a 10% movement speed increase and the ability to vault pallet, wallhacks when you apply Deep Wounds so you can use your sanic speed to go wound more people, and if that doesn't appeal to you then the ability to keep chasing the same survivor to quickly down them because, as we just stated, you're going sanic. Anyone you hit during that time is going to be *extra* wounded where they have to spend some extra time to heal themselves.
---
Seems fine. Not every killer needs to be S tier, and this one gets good mobility and detection in frenzy and slows the game down for the survivors with the bleed.
---
I think that it's strong in the wrong ways yet weaker overall now. It's not just an anti-tunneling tool; a minute is a long time in a match. A killer can down the entire team before the DS user and still get stunned, which makes it (as I've said) not an anti-tunneling tool but an anti-rehooking tool. I think that DS should be stronger and be active longer when the killer focuses (tunnels) and downs the injured survivor after hooking them, and weaker when the killer chooses to chase other survivors after the unhook.
---
In a broad sense, if we say that DS is *the* anti-tunnel tool, then tunneling is downing a survivor 60 seconds after they're unhooked, which isn't true: a survivor can be tunnel-chased for more than 60 seconds, and a killer isn't tunneling simply because they found the same survivor 59 seconds later.
---
I have them all, they're all there for me
---
Yeah, let's just not bring attention to bugs that are in game and move on.
---
thanks for the correction. editing op
---
It's what we deserve.
---
I was once 4 off :(
---
I mean, admittedly in that video he was also Freddy who gets like, triple fucked by Adrenaline so it sort of evens out in that case.
---
same, it’s so funny how killers usually respond to that too “dumb altrustic toxic survs reee” when in all actuality I feel guilty escaping when theres someone on the hook.
---
Umm...by truck?
---
I get it but like...you know?
---
Why is everyone forgetting Adiris???
---
Doctor. He makes stealth nearly impossible for survivors so there's less time of "Where the fuck are the survivors?" and more of "Found 'em! Time to chase him!".
---
He also stalls the game out, giving you more time to sacrifice survivors by making progress on the survivor's objectives a pain. Unnerving Presence, Overcharge, Distressing, and a perk of your choice is a good build to make skill checks super annoying for survivors. If they're making too much progress you usually have the 3-gen to fall back on. 
---
People say doctor's bad at chases but with proper timing (Range addons help) you can zap people at pallets and vaults to deny them from using them allowing you to get a hit in. 
---
He farms points like crazy which is a good thing considering how grindy this game can be.
---
is this a bug? this happened to me yesterday, it's really op
---
Exactly what I’d expect from someone who calls everyone “stupid liberals”
---
When exactly and why did they disable them? I didn't play for ages and when I got back into it recently they were just disabled and I was so confused lmao.
---

16 is legal in more than 50% of the states so...no, it would not be pedophilia.  Even if 17 was illegal it would still not be pedophila, or even hebephilia.
---
Ardetha’s got a Nurse guide right [here.](https://youtu.be/EfnmZvK4l88)
---
Why do survivors always say "trash, no talent"? So it took 0 skill to catch you?
---
Oof. F to pay respects to that spawn.
---
For hex: Third seal, does the effect apply if the hit is via Billy Saw, Bubba Saw, or Huntress Hatchets? Wondering for future slug builds as an alternative for knockout.
---
Pallets, Flashlights, and Firecrackers can stun them. Using the perk Head On can stun them with a locker
---
lol, I can't help it, I love triggering people who play this game for some reason, lol. The DBD community is the most sensitive gaming community, somehow.
---
A good rework would be to apply a short broken status effect (60 seconds maybe) along with deep wound after taking a protection hit while injured
---
He’s pretty good, I’ve been slacking on killer though so I’m only rank 10 but I usually get pretty consistent 4Ks with him. The improved walkspeed for him helps a lot, and it’s super easy to get a first hit using his power.
---
?
---
Disturbed Ward: fuck my totem spawns right?
---
Well, at least you’d know that the killer is Myers just because none of your aura perks are working.
---
Yeah. But then you would have unique survivors with shitty perks. Like Quentin, no one would use him.
---
**ANGRY ELEPHANT NOISES**
---
It's not a bug and it's not op. Every map spawn a number of pallets, if there is no space for another pallet, the map will spawn two of them in the same jungle gym.
---
What’s “healthy” lol, all I know how to do is play until my eyes wont stay open
---
100% agreed
---
You can see it. You can make it wiggle too.
---
He's not a very good killer so you'd be hard pressed to create a strong build for him regardless.
---
Piggy could use some faster crouching speed say 100% as there is some new competition don't you think?
---
Skill checks is still affected by Killers connection and Ruin breaks the game.
---
It can get frustrating when your totem is instantly destroyed though. I personally wouldn’t DC, but I definitely understand the feeling of being fucked due to bad mechanics.
---
For 1 killer out of 7 makes them copycats? You sound silly
---
36 minutes?! who has time for that?
---
It was something to do with the transition to Unreal Engine alongside Patch 2.5, I think
---
Lol I wipe my butt with 1k. Make it 25% added BP
---
Keep in mind you can buy non-licenced characters with the currency of the game
---
Lol battle pass called.
---
I played against a Bubba, who used the splinter, that facecamped first hook. That's the exact reason why people hate him.
---
Michael is funny to play with, survivors are all the same in game play, because you can buy their perks
---
The fact that they’re constantly active, nonstop working on the game every day already puts them above many, many other development teams.
---
Next to the Carrie Fisher cameo tbh
---
Idk justapost lol
---
This would never work because SWF exists so survivors could just say who's the killer and who is not basically making the ability useless. I'm just being brutally honest man
---
People get so fucking mad at me when I leave, but I don't have enough fingers to count how many times a 1k became a 3k due to crazy hook diving altruism with NOED
---
I’ve ran into way more toxic survivors than toxic killers. If all survivors win and escape they get toxic and bash me for being bad. If I manage to slug them all bc instead of opening the gates and leaving all of them chose to stay to either destroy the NOED totem (which I respect) or are just not doing shit, they get toxic and still call me a shit player and get salty. Yes I’m a shit player it’s a GAME! If you’re so good why are you ranked at my level?!?!
---
Windows is good because pallets don’t always spawn the same place every time, and it’s a good way to track which pallets are broken, which way you should run, and how far away you are from the closest safe spot. I’ve been playing this game since it came out and I still use it, don’t worry. It’s super useful.
---
This did not happen in a really long time, that's why I think it can be a bug. And personally I think OP, because instead of only being able to use 1 time very effectively that jungle gym, it can be used 2 times, a huge difference
---
This is the first oink post I don't approve and am scared of

Holy yikes what is this?

---
They were on their first fucking hook and started shit talking me. Like, first they spend the whole time I’m chasing them finding and throwing down as many pallets as possible and then they started messaging me all this garbage.
---
Then just buy Myers
---
Oh man, I always cleanse it, consequences be damned. \*But I at least wait for someone to get wounded before cleansing.
---
How did you fit into an axe suit?
---
I still had that happen on one map. Leatherface basemented me, buddy comes to save, and he stood at the TOP of the stairs (I think on the ironworks map?) and I couldn't move past him. He waited for 4 gens with us trapped until collapse killed us.
---
Nah just every 3 survivor games play 2 killer.
---
It looks great!

As a Legion and Huntress Main; the Huntress-esque Wolf Mask is my favorite thing about this.

Better than every M1 killer besides Michael and Plague
---
imo it's more useful than self-care
---
agreed. sometimes when i'm at a loop with a suvivor, i'll just stand still, let them make a mistake, then pounce.
---
Uhh. 
---
Hello.
---
I hate the ranking in this game. Everything is so slanted in the survivors favor its making killer no fun to play.
---
This comment is better than the meme. You have my respect.
---
What a brilliant idea, why haven't I thought of that.
---
*facepalms*
---
ez combo with borrowed time, you get the stack every time.
---
Survivors talk in lore as much as people talk in the pregame. Postgame doesn't count. 
---
Are you a talkative survivor? Or do you just sit back and wait for the trial to begin?
---
weSmart
---
I like the idea where looking at a gen makes the process go faster it would make the game way scarier
---
Yooo. Tbh sometimes that spot has fucked me up. I’ll take a quick glance and at a distance it just looks like a normal totem. Only until you get closer do you see the flames.
---
i always watch and see what way they move, and then phase. it works very well tbh and i love spirit tons
---
Yea So I Think I’m Gonna But Shatter les Bloodline 
---
Thank You Everybody For The Advice And I Hope You Have A Good Day ✌️
---
Absolutely. At this point there isn't that much point in using self care at all considering the time it takes, plus you can get healed by someone else which is 2x as fast and you healing over doing a gen can definitely screw over your team.
---
I mean. 
---
It literally rewards skillful play and punishes bad/frustrating play. Why should you get rewarded for whiffing? 
---
That’s the real facepalm.
---
A player DC should just be an auto safety for everyone
---
sometimes you can catch them trying to be clever and they walk right towards you. i &lt;3 spirit almost as much as that one guy here loves pig.
---
I love it! Which materials did you use for it?
---
Sans
---
I'm aware devs said that about "tiles that appear and the minimum distance required between pallet spawns", but what really surprises me is the fact they introduced that change in the game long ago, months, this double pallet thing didn't started at that time, but now. Devs said anything about this on recently patches?
---
You’d have to shift the survivors view to first person for this to be relevant.
---
I said what I said, he has too much cons and easy to counter. 
---
End of discussion. 😁
---
I run BBQ, Surveillance, Whispers, and a random perk of my choice. 
---
BBQ becomes somewhat less useful at higher ranks since survivors just hide in lockers or follow you close. However the BP bonus is never useless and even at higher ranks, I can usually still find someone. 
---
I like Whispers+Surveillance, since they allow me to run a pretty tight gen patrolling loop, and I don’t have to stop unnecessarily, only to kick gens or if a survivor is close. Whispers is also a nice compliment to BBQ as well as it can sort of help you distinguish if people are hiding or trailing you. Not to mention, when you’re tracking the last survivor, Whispers is so helpful. Survivors often jump right back on kicked gens so having the aura of the gen lit for you with Surveillance is great for knowing when to continue your patrol or to turn back. It’s all about maintaining pressure on the map and using your time efficiently. 
---
As for the “flavor perk,” I really like Pop Goes the Weasel, Nurse’s Calling, and Make Your Choice, though I mix it up a lot. 
---
Non-perk stuff aside. Faking phasing at pallet loops or windows is extremely satisfying once you get it work. It will all depend on the survivors you’re playing but if you can spook them into making a mistake, you’ll be rewarded with a free hit/hook. Her add-ons are decent and I particularly like the ones that increase phasing duration and speed for that extra map pressure. Prayer Beads are just too much fun on her and is great paired with Surveillance or Discordance for good ol’ yoinks. Also, if you see a survivor hiding, it can really help to pretend you didn’t see them, fake phase away, and turn back to where they might be headed (gen, totem, etc). Begin to phase and face away. You’ll want to continue facing away until the phase meter is complete, as your husk will turn with you if you turn while it is still charging. So face away, full charge, and then u-turn back. Many skilled survivors won’t even wait to make sure you’re really gone and will come out as soon as you begin phasing. I’ve caught quite a few survivors this way, especially if they’re confident players. 
---
Also, a headset is basically required to do well with her. You can play without it or course but you’ll be shocked at the difference once you try it.
---
LMFAOO and give him his own clown costume😂😂
---
there are so many pig mains here tbh
---
It looks really good! 
---
I appreciate the detail you put into all the zippers, that must have taken some time.
---
I've had three games in the last few months as a killer with invisible pallets.  Two and the spirit, and one as the doc on xbox.  Is this a perk or a glitch?
---
do you play on ps4 or xbox?
---
EVA foam :)
---
Okay. Poorly thought out view then. 
---
Catch ya later.

"Joey watch out! The Survivors are genrushing you! 
---
"Oh my god he has headphones on and is listening to his Rare Mixtape of bangin' tracks and slammin' beats so that he can moderately reduce the cooldown duration of Feral Frenzy! 
---
"He can't hear us! Oh my god!"
---
You could just use spine chill to know if the killer if coming your way.
---
Thats longer than a ranked 1 nurse games lasts!!
---
*if you like pina coladas, getting caught in the rain*
---
What we really need is a better solution to the grind, and it looks like bloodpoint awards for ranks are on the horizon.
---
I mean the obvious buff of making gens go faster needs a negative effect to balance things.
---
"You have broken all my pallets, making me the victor."
---
im the colon
---
So essentially you’re just asking for the Legion changes that were universally disliked (1&amp;2) to be reverted.
---
true, true. it's almost like a cult! ^_^
---

---
It has to do with the game not actually being in full screen. The game is set to borderless fullscreen.
---
What you can do is:
---
1. Go to desktop. 
---
2. Right click and go to display settings. 
---
3. Then on where it says "Scale and Layout", set the percentage to 100%.
---
I deal with this all the time. I set the percentage to 100% before starting up the game.
---
Fun fact: someone did the math and by using frenzy in chase to injure the survivor you lose time. Only frenzy with intent of chaining attacks on survivors
---
because of recent patches, they nerfed her booty
---
Yes but what I mean is that even if you have to look at gens you can juat use spine chill to know if the killer is close, even without looking at the killer. And if you're doing gens togerher, one can keep a lookout while the others stare at the gen.
---
There's literally no way they didn't do that on purpose to dick over killers. That's hilarious.
---
While I don't agree with all of your ideas, I'd like to extrapolate on the first one
---
&gt;Looking straight at the generator would fix it faster, while looking around slower, to both combat Ghostface's weakness and give a feeling of immersion.
---
How about while looking away from the generator you get skill checks in different areas of the screen, like when you're suffering from madness against the doctor?
---
While I think this makes sense, I don't know if I necessarily like the idea. I think many survivor mains are rather petty, hence the number of DCs. Adding a slightly more frustrating element to survivor gameplay would probably cause even more DCs or some people to just stop playing altogether.
---
Um did you just call the entity what I think I just read you called the entity? Thin ice man, the entity tortures the killers until they listen....
---
I think it's super underrated. Anyway, I don't think the gens should be able to be done faster. Gen rushing is a thing and making it even easier would make the killer's life a bitch. I think it would be better to make gen repairs slower when not looking at the gen and regular speed when looking at it. 
---
The thing is though that you could just flick really quickly to check your surroundings and it would cost next to no time at all.
---
At least Wraith and Dwight (and I think Feng) are new to me.
---
Huntress is also free on PC. I think she's just base game, Doctor is not base game on PC.
---
I like all of these killer skins, especially the pig and wraith.
---
Yeah these all were leaked a long while ago. There's been multiple 4k renders posted here too.
---
But... Huntress! 
---
Test subject Pig, Wraith and Huntress are so good!
---
Honestly I struggled to even find a single point I agree with on the list. Any information about the killers previous games/loadout is just ridiculous. The game already has a very streamlined set of perks for both survivors/killers at all ranks below 12, going as far as listing what they use flushes the already minimal perk variation down the shitter. Pre-game communication shouldn’t be a thing as SWF’s already get enough hate and cause balance issues, let’s not turn every game into that. Looking at gens to repair them faster makes no sense in a 3rd person game. Ghostface clearly needs big changes on his own, let’s not rewrite straight forward game mechanics to make him slightly better. Clearly you have Nurse and a lot of the changes you suggested would be extremely buggy as well as exploitable such as the terror radius suggestion. Overall this list focuses on things that either make the game worse OR are unnecessary in the grand scheme of the game.
---
What the game needs is better balance across the board and I think this starts with the maps. I don’t see many people mention maps at all when it comes to balance but it’s something that needs to be addressed. Why is Hillbilly so good? Because every map in the game fits his playstyle except for 2 (Lery’s, Gideon). Nurse ignores map layout altogether so obviously she’s top tier. Same can be said for survivor perks. There are maps with infinite’s if survivors have Balanced or even Lithe in some cases. Map layout shouldn’t be as random as it currently is. Everything from gen and hook spawns to Windows/Pallets and the exit gates need to be looked at for balance. I’m hopeful that BHVR recognizes this and that is why there are 2 reworks on the roadmap. I can go on and on but this comment is already too long. The point is, don’t fuck with the mechanics of the game when there are much more major flaws that need to be looked at.

The windows are closed the majority of times. So you are fucked if you get bodyblocked.

My man Adam just needs more Autodidact stacks
---
p l e a s e  have that Test Subject pig outfit purchasable with shards
---
Ive been having fun with legion.. but I also just started a couple weeks ago and am onlu rank 14 soo I dont think I qualify for an opinion.
---
I'm going to offer a counterpoint to the other commenter and suggest not using most add ons. Blinking is all muscle memory. If you are changing the charge speed or the range on a blink, all of that muscle memory goes out the window. If you combine add ons, it makes it even more difficult to gauge your blinks.
---
The only add ons I use are the extra blink ones when I want to have a little fun, or if it looks like I'm up against a tough team.
---
This approach won't work for everyone, but it does for me. You'll find what works for you if you keep playing her.
---
Good luck!
---
I think this would be awesome. Would require you to pay attention to what is going on verus getting the wonderful CURSED Huntress Lullaby.
---
Calling legions power “not good” is incredibly stupid. He literally gets a free first hit. How many M1 killers get a free first hit? Pig doesn’t, Wraith doesn’t, if they don’t get them then none of the others get it. What is being useful? 
---
You say any survivor with half a brain can “break a chase” but it’s not about breaking a chase. Breaking a chase doesn’t mean you lose a survivor. 
---
If you think Bubba and Legion are worse than doctor, you’re outright trolling and this conversation is useless. 
---
Literally the goal against every killer is to “stall” them. I can say that about every single killer in the game.
---
I have a few images of dwight tposing in the lobby
---
What Is The Fastest Way To Earn BP ?
---
Which gets us back to the original point of me giving you the humblebrag award of the day in stating that you can loop killers "indefinitely" (which is hyperbolic, as you've stated), which probably makes you the best Dead by Daylight survivor in the game if taken at face value.
---
I have never seen you play and I can still say with 100% certainty that you don't loop the killer for as long as you want. Especially if, by your own admission, you suck at using pallets and instead choose to just take a hit. Get back down to earth little buddy.
---
I hope to do every variation of mixtape for the variations of legion ^^
---
Not real axe. Not real blood. Pathetic
---
God tier red rank Nurse players are more frightening than jumpscare Myers. They flawlessly predict your every move and wipe your team in less than 7 minutes.
---
Would anyone be mad if they removed SWF.
---
I laughed pretty hard at work. Thank you for helping my day get better
---
I hope to do every variation of legion with their mixtape
---
Some tips from a R1 spirit player. Learn to use sound to your advantage. You can hear, and therfore judge the location of, injured survivors which helps with ending chases. Learn to predict survivors pathing, if they are running for a pallet or window, beat them to it with the phasing. Learn to use her mind games but dont overuse them, good survivors will catch on. MnA is very good on her as her terror radius is already quite small. You can walk to a survivor and get a hit, then use your power to finish chases fast. My standard build with any add-ons is MnA, BBQ, MYC, and ruin. Sometimes i swap ruin for nurses if im sick of it getting broken in the first 30 sec. of games. There is also an incredibly powerful gen pulling build you can use with her. Take MnA, discordance, survaillence, and pop goes the weasel with her prayer bead add-on. This allows you to maintain control over gens and keep pretty good info on the map. It can also work better than ruin for slowing gens as survivors will rarely be able to do a gen w/o you knowing. Above all she takes practice just like the nurse or any high skill cap killer. Hope this helped.
---
Don’t worry you will get it and it’s like a perfect storm when it all goes down. Got mine on Gideon against a squadette group, 2 of them were acting all weird and acted like they wanted to farm but Shirtless Myers wasn’t Farming, just that sweet evil from their souls 😈
---
A free hit doesnt matter if you cant get a second. Freddy also gets a free hit, and hes considered bad. Remember, he doesnt get a second free hit or he gets stunned.
---
4 seconds is enough to get away on most maps, as long as they dont run in a straight line. And even if they do, they can easily get to a vault point within that time.
---
The doctor completely takes stealth out of the game, he can keep survivors from vaulting or using pallets, and he has his illusionary pallets which can screw up a survivor.  Hes also amazing at camping.
---
Bubba moves slightly forward and gets stunned if he touches a wall. Hes bad. This is coming from a bubba main.
---
The goal isnt to stall, it's to kill. Stalling accomplishes nothing except farming, which legion is good for, though doctor is better at it.
---
Heah I'm glad they're looking into the window infinites on a couple of the maps. But I agree with you, the game mechanics don't need to be changed.
---
It's ok most of us have gotten used to the insults but  at least you learned what killers have to deal with.
---
...why use insidious in the first place? How do you find standing still fun gameplay?
---
Whaaat that's wierd. I already had him when I got the game lol. I wonder if someone wasn't base game on Xbox xD like Hag or something
---
Fortnite bad Minecraft and Dbd good
---
Off topic. I read "Boob" instead of "Noob"
---
I was a nurse main but okay.
---
I cant complain about maps except oh god corn, but since i am not a game dev everything in the list was aimed to band aid the streamline you called. Killer runs only 4 perks, survivors now may play accordingly. Third person could work only when you are directly looking at the angle you are working the gen on, indicated by the buff or de buff underneath it, or getting extra skill checks as a means of "distracted" could work.
---
Not everyone has to agree i suppose.
---
Get spirit, her mindgame potential is amazing
---
I've never put much thought into yellow moris but interesting that you don't have to be hooked. Never thought about it
---
If that's any consolation, I would probably still run right by it and miss it.
---
Freddy doesn’t get a free first hit. Low rank alert. Waste of my time. 
---
Since you won’t believe anything I say, go ask your favorite streamer, who actually plays the game well, how good doctor is. Ask them about legion as well. 
---
And please ask them if Freddy gets a free first hit without pill bottle or tremendously reduced Dream time. 
---
Maybe they can speak the phrases in ways that you’ll understand.
---
1. Hex No one escapes death, Rancor, Hex: Haunte grounds/Devour hope, Make your choice, Iron Maiden are perks that can lead to instat downs. 
---
Myers and Plague also have built in exposed
---
2. Deour hope ta 5 stacks lets you be moried instantly, but it shows devour hope is active at 3 tokens when someone ELSE is hit
---
Hard to tell, huntress is a giant woman.
---
How handsome does he look in them?
---
won't be repeating myself...
---
I think you have to take into account the different ways that people combine perks and what they use them for. Buckle up could be an S tier depending on a persons usage of the perk such as if they run a savior kit, or like Boil over if they consistently have the killers attention
---
Yeah let's make Hex: Ruin games even more luck-based. Will you randomly happen upon the totem that is invisible from most angles? LUCK! Are you getting one skill check on this generator, or TWELVE? ALL LUCK BABY!
---
No seriously fuck Ruin.
---
"Your treatment radius is 128 meters and your punishment radius is 0"
---
Self care and urban are not that high.
---
I'm rank 1. Freddy always gets a free hit because people dont take him seriously. I also dont watch dbd streamers. Dont like watching people play horror games, the overreacting is annoying.
---
And if you dont have a real argument I think were done here. I had some fun. See you later.
---
Yeah because Clown as everyone knows has the best Gen pressure and totally can't get genrushed to Oblivion
---
I'm glad me and Ace could help
---
But Clown is not a pay to play. He is also worse than Piggy.
---
Serious question. 
---
Is this a troll list? You have no mither somewhere besides the bottom tier.
---
Playing Killer with BBQ n Chili and BP offerings. Can get up to 50-60K per match.
---
Oh I’m sorry
---
I am sorry, I had to.
---
That’s the thing, I thought to put boil over higher up but it really doesn’t work very well in normal situations, and buckle up can sorta counter slugging but the killer can just pick them up, but I’ve never had the chance to use it
---
Huntress can counter if you dont suck. You must just be bad at the game if you think huntress cant counter loops smfh. Seriously. Next.
---
Whenever I’m looking for a hex totem I do dull ones I come across. I think it’s worth it in case of NOED or Devour Hope!
---
How do they work?
---
Oh. So you admit you play against bad survivors. Results are skewed. 
---
My argument has been proven. You’re just a stubborn bonehead at this point who is apparently playing a different game than the rest of us.
---
I can only speak for myself but yes, it takes zero skill to catch me.
---
I'm trying, I swear.
---
I'm not a big fan of leaks, so missed them, most probably
---
Goodbye friend. Goodluck on future arguments.
---
At least he is Thicc and I mean technically he is and is not at the same time because you could be lazy and buy him or grind alot to get him.
---
Most of the S tier needs to be lower imo
---
Truth be told, not sure about camping but the Basement is THE BEST place to take Survivors. So that's why so many Killers take people there whenever it's an option. Tunneling may be lame but if the Killer is having a bad match, he needs to get the 4 man team down to 3 and 2 as quickly as possible.
---
That or just run NOED.
---
Thanks for the constructive criticism that actually has explanation lol. Can you elaborate, I thought the gun looked awful?
---
No mither + unbreakable + tinacity has worked well for me sometimes but it kinda was just a bit of a joke to but it above f teir
---
Most perks are in the right spot but there’s some that just shouldn’t be there. Like Boil over should be f Self care and Urban should be B maybe A.
---
The BBQ nerf?
---
Rank 4 survivor after I get a 4k with my rank 16 1-perk 0-addons Spirit
---
&gt;literal trash, worst killer iv seen
---
You weren’t holding the button in the bloodweb draining it to zero were you?
---
Wait, Plague has exposed?
---
Sassy
---
What would you put S tier? (I would put MoM at S tier but I have some hatred towards it as killer)
---
I don’t know what rank you’re playing at. 
---
It’s kinda known that you don’t slug no mither. 
---
I have other issues but that’s the main one.
---
no. she can get you injured without hitting you tho
---
Bbq and Chili perk from Lf
---
There is an oinkers sub?
---
Damnnohtml has some high-quality dbd content in his channel. He uploads fairly rarely as he mainly streams but watching his 3-hour winning streak of speed limiter Leatherface was very educational.
---
Yeah. 
---
When did they nerf it?
---
Am at work, but a quick search did not reveal the killers that come with which system. However on PC it's nurse, billy, wraith, trapper, and huntress.
---
I like legion and games I play but those games I play i get 1-2 kills on average hes a decent killer but hes one that is limited heavy by a brick wall of a skill cap off which is basically hit everyone then chase then just m1 so I wish he had something more going for him to raise the bar of skill for him
---
I play surv rank one but my friends at at 10-6 so we usually get placed at higher killer levels, but go with the other issues because I would like to hear them
---
For his next outfit, Dwight is going to be wearing a donkey hat, a bib and a child leash.
---
Not a burn, just an advice. Take it as you want
---
Yes it's called R/Oinkers_
---
You know the hiding in lockers and the generators. It was mostly the locker nerf to it. 
---
If you don’t know if you hide in a locker before someone’s hooked bbq doesn’t show your location.
---
Not when your playing a Billy or anyone else that doesn't use their power just tunnel, skips the hook infront of them and takes you to the basement even if it's your last hook. It's not worth it if you focus on that while 3 gens are done and the killer is satisfied with one kill and runs NOED cause he's clueless
---
He's not as ridiculously strong as Freddy, but at least Freddy has perks that counter him like self-care and adrenaline, even if they are niche perks that you'll rarely see in a game. With clown there's just no counterplay, the bottle doesn't even need to hit you, just near you
---
Okay, but that is not really instadown/exposed
---
Its 100% not a reason to quit, but yeah the RNG spawns that can put you right on top of a hex needs to change.
---
Nea: Meh.
---
I second this, he's really fun to watch and he has an all around great attitude. He's why I'm pretty decent at this game
---
I just left as a killer as the survs had won but hung around to play dickhead. They then messaged me basically ridiculing me its put me off playing killer tbh
---
Puppers is pretty chill he also streams and uploads clips on his YouTube. I definitely recommend him.
---
It would take too much time to nitpick everything but the main issue is your S tier. 
---
Urban, Prove thyself, self care, botany knowledge, and distortion all need to go down. 
---
Balanced landing needs to be S tier easily. 
---
And wake up needs to be higher.
---
How are Empathy and Spine Chill C tier...what
---
Puppers is very funny and chill from what I've seen, he's a good channel
---
Honest question, is Urban Evasion in S tier some kind of joke?
---
Always be mindful of the chainsaw noises, just because you can't hear heartbeat doesn't mean he's not going to be on your ass within 3 seconds
---
Myers same tier as huntress? That’s a paddlin
---
I didnt want to put him in until we know what theyre doing to him since he isnt staying as he is now. But he's still be a shit killer with their track record of killer "buffs" recently. The Plague was nerfed after her PTB and given almost useless buffs in return for the movement sped loss. Legion isnt cancer anymore, but not that good.
---
Thanks ! I'm searching some new dbd streamers too, so that's great
---
I thought you did great. I read low effort and didn't expect much. I audibly laughed so good job \[:
---
Immersettes can use it to evade the killer so easily aswell as any normal survivor it can work well if you do it right
---
It also makes the killer move faster and down you with one hit instead of two.
---
I agree that she can by pass a health state by wating, but it is not an exposed so I got cinfused. For a sec I tought I missed an ultra rare addon.
---
Does the Evil Incarnate Achievement require fragrant tuft of hair or is it just strongly recommended? I was thinking about using the Tombstone + Memorial to try and get it but people in post game chat are saying I won’t get it.
---
it used to be a rare counter to DS. You'd slug your obsession everytime, kill everyone else and then kill them without giving then a chance to use their DS. then it came in a form of Rancor
---
Thanks a lot !
---
What's funny is that I have a friend who is super toxic when he plays games, and the one game he plays more than anything else is For Honor.
---
Self promotion doesn't tend to go well down here
---
Bloodpoint gains... that’s it, we’ll make it is better
---
Different models for advertising renders and in game, I guess
---
#F
---
Mettle was because I have a slight hatred for it and getting 3 hits in can be difficult
---
He still somehow is able to get genrushed faster then Freddy in my experience and I just don't know how.
---
Aw, thank you!
---
Yup, just how they’ve worked for me
---
&gt;Puppers
---
Yeah I know him ! He is very cool
---
Then tbh if you run him through five gens you have three teammates that if smart and see he is struggling to get you would assume he might have noed if they dont cleanse then that's the game when playing with randoms
---
Unlike adrenaline tho you can literally play around NOED every single game lol like aye its powerful but even tho I don't run it I appreciate its existence in the game as it encourages survivors to cleanse dull totems which helps to slow down the pace of the game.
---
Why though? She's easy to detect, certain maps maker her power useless, if he misses her she shots has to stop to reload... yeah she's high mid tier
---
Looks like sans lol
---
I had someone else saying boil over can be good in certain situations, it’s worked well for me quite a lot but it also ain’t the best, so that’s why it’s where it is
---
Yes, remove the ability for me to play a fun match with my friends, that should do it
---
He is, I misplaced Freddy by mistake
---
Yes but Tier list shouldn’t be biased it should be this is there because it’s good not for any reason or reasons including hatred. Sure MoM is aggravating for killer I understand but as a perk it earns its spot as an S because it’s that good. 
---
If we took your way then Nurse wouldn’t even be S tier because most people
---
Hate her. 
---
You need an unbiased list upon what has happened and just rank the perks as good as they’re.
---
Same! I usually rotate, but my main 3 are Ace, Feng and Jake
---
Then dont remove the ability that can counter you plying with your friends.
---
On PS4 it was trapper, wraith, Billy, nurse, hag, doctor then Huntress is a free dlc. I'm pretty sure that's all but I can recheck
---
So are we basing this off of rank 20 killers? Because at most Boil Over is pretty useless.
---
If you look at my title, you’ll see it’s in my opinion...
---
Use your pallet example to your advantage. When you’re running towards a pallet and he’s behind you they’re going to try to one shot the pallet. Just run past the pallet and make a hard right or left and you can reuse the pallet.
---
If he’s revving behind you, when he’s about to start running you can turn better than he can and avoid the chainsaw unless he has add-ons. A common mistake is to try to run around him when he’s revving when you should be using that time to create a bit of distance to dodge when he starts sawing. 
---
Pick up Dead Hard if you don’t already have it as well.
---
Around ranks 10-5 it’s worked well for me but once I got down towards 1-3 I unequiped
---
The Doctor is also good for farming since his shock gives you a lot of deviousness points.
---
I really don't care about masks for Ghostface I just want the robes he wears in the films, I'd definitely pay for those.
---
That’s insane. Had to purchase Hag and DR on PC. I didn’t actually buy Hag, I ended up getting Hex Ruin on shrine.
---
I think doctor and legion are pretty easy to get high BP on as well
---
Put balanced and MoM on S and bring urban dowm
---
One time I had a daily as Laurie to escape and so joined a match to do so. Endgame came and two players got hooked w noed on against a spirit
---
I had a gate open, was fully healed and was able to readily escape but I just said fuck it and ran looking for the totem along the way to unhook them. 
---
Didn’t find the totem so I just unhooked them both and the spirit chased us all out but didn’t actually get anybody somehow
---
She did end up getting a Kate with rancor because she didn’t escape when the rest of us did lol
---
great play! I like this a lot
---
I literally never complained about noed, and neither did my friends, we cleanse totems, why? Because we devide ourselfs into specific roles (1 person to distract the killer, two gen jokeys, and 1 totem hunter that breaks all five totems then does gens with the other two)
---
Botany knowledge is absolutely an S tier perk. It is guaranteed to provide efficiency in any game that isn't against plague. It is consistently more reliable than DS, BL or MoM. It provides benefits throughout the entire game too, unlike exhaustion perks or endgame perks like Adrenaline and Hope. It is one of the least situational perks at a survivor's disposal, which earns it a spot as a top tier perk. (Alongside DH and BT).
---
Hope being ranked C with all the meme perks is criminal, btw. It's also one of the best perks in the game if you're a good runner. It allows you to actually escape bad killers who depend on noed for kills and are who mad at you for knowing how to loop. Plus, it really messes with good nurses, if you can make it to that point. (Big if) It's basically a free escape if you know what you're doing and make it to end game.
---
Well sorry to say and I believe quite a people agree with me but your opinion on some perks really suck...
---
How dare you put this killer in that tier? Clearly you just don't know how to play.
---
People that dc as soon as something doesn't go their way.
---
Wait that’s how you kill a survivor “by your hand”?
---
I have a daily for the doctor that wants me to do that.
---
Killer could change who they look like whenever they wanted in a locker to keep them guessing or something.
---
I don't feel like wasting time linking it because it should be common sense, if the server's host lags then does client side matter at all? No and the entire point of my comment is Ruin is game breaking unless you have good internet as a Host which make it completely unfair to survivors.
---
I was just joking yeah. Although I did talk to someone once who thought Freddy was OP and disconnected against him every time, and he was actually serious...
---
Next Tuesday
---
1. I didnt want to put Freddy to high since his rework might entirely alter this
---
2. Trapper is sill worse than Bubba, Trapper is an M1 killer while Bubba can break pallets faster, cant be hurt by his own power and can guarantee kills while trapper really cant
---
3. I still find Clown a good killer and with all the potatoes that cleanse against Plague she is still good, not great but good.
---
4. Spirit, Billy, and ag are all almost in the same spot tbh, they are all just so good at what they do.
---
click then click again to play around adrenaline uwu
---
Or keep them on a hook.
---
**OH MY GOD THIS IS BRAND NEW INFORMATION!!**
---
Just give it some kind of significant BP bonus or boost and I'll be happy.
---
It's not required. Some find it easier with the tuft of hair and some harder.
---
YoUrE nOt ThE fIrSt To HaVe ThIs IdEa LmAo
---
I'd love to listen to whatever he is listening to, he looks like he's having a great time
---
He's Plague but shorter. Both of them have the same power, every survivor is injured and will stay that way until the gens are done. Bit better than Plague as hes shorter and breaks pallets are normal speed, but still bottom tier.
---
And how would you change her without making her F tier? If they brought her down to one blink she'd be pointless. Increased fatigue? Pointless. Turn lethal blinks on injured survivors into deep wounds? Give her yet another resource meter and reduce her map presence to nothing? Either come with ideas or don't bother commenting. Anger aside, I agree that nurse needs a change. Mostly in her addons, bonus blinks are overpowered. But I'm sick of this attitude some of you people have. Play her for a while. There's a reason she's stronger than other killers. She takes much longer to learn, more mechanical skill to use, and that should be rewarded with actual control over the game. Instead of being forced to wait for survivor misplays, nurse can make her own.
---
And even if they do nerf her into obvlion, I'll shift to spirit since she's basically nurse lite. At least until the crying starts again.
---
It stacks, the yellow addon reduces the cooldown by 0.2 sec, the green by 0.4 and purple by 0.6
---
the stun is 4 seconds, with purple and green addon its 3 seconds.
---
Must be a good idea then
---
"MY SPECIAL POWER... GUN!"
---
Wait so when are these available?
---
I know it’s not really a stupid question, but this is the best place to ask without making an entire post: When is the double bloodpoint event? I might be away from my computer next weekend and I’m hoping that’s not when it is
---
Sorry I’m new to the game, what does TR mean?
---
I disagree. Noed may be unpleasant to go against but I think it is needed for this game. If it gets removed then survivors will have absolutely no need to be nervous about dull totems and can lead to intense moments at the end of the game where one mistake or simply bad luck can screw you over. Besides, some people complain about not having more objectives in the game so taking noed away simply lessens what you can do in a game.
---
I always say try to get better at Chases and Looping but if you want to be helpful Bt or you can run an exhaustin perk to help.
---
Thats what killers do at endgame, remaining survivors have to work together to get you out.
---
I call him Skillbilly since he actually 0 skill to play, at all. Hold hold chains behind back and get a down, wow so much skill...
---
Yeah I think I underrated Hag  bit, but I find these three still very close in power. While having 110% she still has more map pressure than the killer who can vault windows lol
---
Okay then we'll go back people returning the game for having no option of playing with your friends!!!
---
Do you know why the 5 second delay was added when you leave a lobby?  It was because people kept spamming lobbies and leaving / rejoining trying to get with their friends.  Y'all morons didn't play during the beta and just get pissed at groups of friends who are better than you lol
---
True that
---
1 out of 7? Clearly you can’t count.
---
Terror Radius / the heartbeat
---
Hey. That's a good idea
---
Ahhh thanks!
---
sorry that you get to be the receiver of my question, but why is that? I mean i don't plan on watching this guy's stream (sorry op nothing personal) but i'm not gonna get on his thread and start being a dick. Not implying that your comment was a dick comment but i think these kinda posts should either be used to go look at the stream or flat ignored. I always open these posts just to see how our community responds and it disgusts me how some people just start shitting on some poor dude trying to get some people in his chat. While your comment wasn't harmful it only furthers the idea that 'We DoN't LiKe ThAt HeRe' Idk again sorry this went to you. I just think we should either give people a chance or move on.
---
HE BLINKED
---
God I can't wait to see all black stealthy piggies
---
A gun wielder is something I've always wanted. But it probably wouldn't be a revolver. I would think a revolutionary or something, with such a fast projectile you damn Skippy are gonna have major drawbacks (one shot, very long cool down / reload, and maybe little accuracy as well) however these drawbacks might allow for a one shot down but you'll only be able to carry like 6 per match without refilling the ammo like huntress can.
---
Is that the Blade of Woe from skyrim for ghostface??
---
Yeah depends on the situation. I leave if i feel like the poor guy is getting bm
---
So because 1 killer out of 7 was copyright, the devs can’t think for themselves? 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
---
Uhh...
---
I feel Legion is mid tier and underestimed by how they work because they arent easy to use. Most killers though, that arent the top need buffs.
---
We talkin like musket lol
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
---
This is funny but if you had him handing him a teabag it would have been more accurate. Good stuff though got an audible laugh out of me.
---
Yeah I’m deleting the game if they take out swf I only play when my friends are playing
---
I think Killer mains is a broad term: I am an overly firendly killer. If two people D/C I let the other two go while some other people would kill them and say EZ game. ALso if I like a certain survivor I will just not hit them, if the others catch on they cna go too because frankly after 2.5K hours I dont care oto much about bloodpoints or kills
---
Same with survivor mains: For every P3 CLaudette t bagging and flashlight clicking theres just a guy playing the game.
---
I agree with this guy. Try to get better at chases and use an exhaustion perk
---
Again, 1 out of 7??? You’re missing the whole point kid.
---
As a big boi Jeff main I disagree
---
Yeah or flintlock pistol
---
Creative, but how you imagine having 2 item 
---
buttons on consoles. The pad is fully binded and you can't put additional item button in there.
---
Haaaaa i love it. Got a purple flashlight on each hip
---
Arguably it also has a tracking element because it makes survivors scream. There's even a chance you'll get a location notification if you hit someone with the bottle.
---
And that's a silly argument. "If you completely ignore the main advantage, it doesn't do anything."
---
Oh shit
---
Something about that particular Feng cosmetic paired with that voice made me laugh
---
I've got a nossebleed
---
Damn thanks, just saw some videos and he looks pretty good !
---
You can just back up
---
You don't like DS? I think is good enough. We'll make it is nice if you go for the saves, even better with bond. Borrowed time is unlocked by default on consoles, it's good too
---
Ruin is a very bad perk for killers in Rank 1 against SWF groups because it gets found in like 30s of the round starting. Ruin is also counterable by BEING ABLE TO HIT SKILLCHECKS
---
You need to bring a Momento Mori, I reccommend getting a green or Ebony.
---
Nerdy guy with a tacky sense of style
---
Fut yea
---
This had me on the floor laughing
---
Honestly any of the non licensed killers and nurse are great starters and give a large array of options while licensed killers tend to have a gameplay changing gimmick
---
I disagree, carrying two insta heals, running MoM, dead hard, and adrenaline. You wouldn't be able to get this person down AT ALL I just don't think that'd be fair. Now if the items had to be two different types (not rarities, two completely different items) then that would be more fair and I'd support it
---
The entirety of Y3 was mostly original killers. And 5 out of 16 killers are licensed. So no it’s not “constant licensed killers”.
---
It's not like I don't like DS, its the fact that after being unhooked I instantly try to go down becouse I want to DS the killer, then I fuck up and I'm dead. So I like it but it makes me die
---
To add, there's no complicated way to actually kill any killer like there is in F13.
---
It’s actually a terrible idea, and would manifest very poorly into gameplay
---
Finally a worthy Pig buff!
---
You can see the flame?
---
I cleansed it and it went BOOM!  
---
I had no idea it was a hex totem.
---
He camped the first person he found. The guy at the start who was injured had been getting chased for 3 gens after being face camped till second stage. That's why I body blocked for him. I was on gens most of the game and only got him because he downed someone else with his chain saw who he slugged while still going after the guy I had just got off the hook, I'm on console so I can only record the last 5 mins of the match.
---
He was in my swf group and I didn't feel like letting him die. If you paid attention you would've noticed, I didn't get off the hook. 2 seconds after I got off he downed me then I used my DS. He held his chain saw infront of the guy on hook even before we got rid of noed, He chainsawed someone which allowed me to pull him off the hook. Sorry you didn't like it but next time just leave a downvote and move on.
---
Stuff of nightmares
---
As a killer main, honestly, I should stop being surprised when it happens, but they just keep running straight at me. like really Meg, you expect to break my hammer with your forehead or something?
---
Red ranks PC, I play all-rounder and runner. 
---
MoM is useful maybe 1 game in 5. 40% of the time you didn't need it at all, and you just let it go off in the exit gate to BM. (So I don't use it at all, because I don't BM.) 40% of the time the killer plays around it or brings a mori. Very inconsistent. Low RoI. 
---
DS only punishes killers who somehow don't realize that DS is a thing. In red ranks, that's mainly killers who are so boosted that you don't need it. Is it nice when it goes off? Yes. Can you get it to go off consistently? Not against anyone with a functioning brain. "Hmm... I wonder why this dead on hook, injured survivor is bodyblocking me? They must just be new..." (Especially because you tend to see the same killers over and over, they will remember your perks.)
---
BL is completely overrated. The maps it's great on, namely Haddonfield and the Game, are already very survivor favored. You don't need it. Maps it's "okay" on are usually concentrated around a singular structure or loop. Chapel, Ormond, etc. Good killers won't chase you into those loops. e.g. It doesn't provide any extra utility and any other perk would be better. It's completely worthless in most places on most maps , which is why I consider it unreliable. I will take Dead Hard over it 100% of the time.
---
Botany Knowledge shaves 30% time off of any heal you participate in, for the entirety of the game. It's good for healing yourself with a medkit, it's good for healing others off a hook. You are guaranteed to get value out of it, except against Plague. Very few survivor perks are this consistent. I don't always run it, but when I do, I appreciate the value it provides.
---
how do they decide what perks are green and what perks are purple
---
Let's see :
---
Pig : she has the best stealth in the game, because she is very small when she's crouching and her breathing can be easily confused with a survivor's breathing ( unlike map wide Myers breathing ), so she can get a easy first hit or even gen grab ( even if the gen grab would happen just against brain dead survivors, with Legion you would never be able to do that ), she has good mind games ( Ambush at short and medium pallets, crouching/uncrouching to make survivors leave the loops or just confuse them and she is short, so it's easy to mind game with her at certain loops ) and also she has traps which can stall the game or delay the last generator to be completed ( because nobody wants to have an active trap on their head in EGC ). And because her best add-ons are the brown and yellow ones, she isn't too add-on reliant and that's a big plus for her when so many killers are reliant on their green, purple or red add-ons ( Freddy, Trapper, Cannibal, Clown, Plague, Doctor, Wraith to some extend, even Legion ). 
---
Legion can get a easy first hit and that's all. On top of that, now you can literally loop him while he is Frenzy, because now he has a slower Frenzy speed and a slower Frenzy vault speed, his Deep Wounds mechanics are useless, he still can't get apply too much pressure if survivors aren't relatively close and he's like Plague, you have no reason to heal against him if you can loop a 115% speed killer without a power, even if you are injured ( his Frenzy is worthless against injured people ). Also, he gets fatigued for 4 seconds after using his power, 4 seconds for a power that even can't down survivors, he can't body block anymore survivors because of his slow Frenzy speed, he is add-on reliant ( playing Legion without Cold Dirt is a big OOF, 4 seconds are just too much ) and majority of his add-ons sucks even more than Pig add-ons ( and that's something ). He is short like Pig, so he can also mind game at certains loops, so I give him that, but Pig can mind game much better than him.  
---
Oh, and this is subjective but Pig is actually fun to play, while Legion is literally the most boing killer in the game ( for me ).
---
Thanks!
---
I learned perks by watching YouTube experimental builds. Most youtubers doing them take time to say how the perk works, so it's great
---
Yeah, that's what I really want to do. Have fun games! I don't mind survivors escaping and such cause ya know they need to that's their goal, and hey if I let them escape no biggie!
---
Typical toxic survivor
---
Lmao
---
1. You still have them looking for the totem, which slows the game down just a little bit. Also lets you know where they're going to be if they're trying to cleanse it.
---
2. I have yet to find someone who can hit skillchecks 100% and the punishment for missing a skillcheck is very heavy, especially if you hit it early. Also, I don't think Quick-Time Events as a balancing mechanic have ever been good design, ever, especially if the timing and rate of occurence of those QTEs is mostly random.
---
I didn't know that Alex Jones played DBD
---
I've been playing for a while mostly as killer. If you want I can spectate a few of your legion games and give you pointers.
---
Because it's oversaturated content. The amount of people sharing their stream info on here is unreal. As well as that, most DBD streamers tend to try to emulate popular content creators, and end up seeming obnoxious as hell.
---
I couldn't care either way, I'm just warning the dude that he's not gonna get the reception he wants.
---
Isn't it funny how I somehow don't manage to get all this flaming in the post game chat despite having fruitful matches with a few kills, sometimes even a 4k?
---
There we go, you finally get it. The point is, they should be thinking up things for themselves and not taking stuff from movies. Not that hard.
---
Urban Evasion, Probe Thyself and Botany Knowledge in S tier, LOL. Even Self Care isn't an S tier perk anymore.
---
Botany + selfcare against sloppy is a good combo
---
We're supposed to run. Not stop and admire.
---
We need more people like you in this community lol. And like a toxic bill once told me: "Im just spamming the control key on my keyboard to trigger someone". OS yeah, if you see someone thinking theyre THE shit, just remember its someone hitting a key on a keyboard.
---
As neutral as I've seen post like this.
---
Toxic trash survivors also being the kind of people that say things like this (liberal safe space lol) isn't all that surprising
---
This is cute. Reminds me of the Ash who DC’d on the way to his first hook and then sent 200+ individual “FUCK TARD” messages.
---
Kaboom 
---
:)
---
I know. I mostly miss them because my setup is right next to a screen door and the glare can get really intense in the middle of the day. If I would slap on a Full Moon Bouquet, then boom, I could see. 
---
Another side effect of the transition to Unreal was Claudette becoming invisible. Seriously, it wouldn't hurt to brighten her default clothes to compensate because as it stands she blends in too well and it breeds this idiotic mentality of "the killer will never find me and I'll act really put out if he does".
---
Hi there, welcome to Dead by Daylight by the way. I have about 500-600 hours into the game so maybe I can help.
---
All the advice can really be from personal preference, so keep that in mind. For ME, this is what I do.
---
There's actually a shit ton of perks that aren't necessarily good. But it's all up to personal preference and your playstyle, when you pick your perk loadout you don't want it to be straight meta, you should make it cater to your playstyle. When you have a perk loadout what you really want is 1 end game perk (People usually use Adrenaline) 1 Haste or getaway perk for the killer (At the moment the meta is Dead Hard, but any will do) people ALWAYS run Self Care from Claudette, so I would invest some BP and time into getting that. and the last one is basically what I call a "wildcard" slot. You can put anything that helps your playstyle. For me, my regular loadout is Adrenaline, Self Care, Dead Hard, and my wildcard is Decisive Strike, if not that. I use Borrowed Time.
---
Aura reading is basically a perk or item that shows an outline of the killer, as an example: Kindred and Dark Sense, unlock the aura reading, and reveals where the killer is when you do a gen/ when you get hooked. You CAN use these for your wildcard slot, especially when you want to get used to the game, but as you become more experienced it's not really needed, since you can probably tell where the killer is/ wouldn't care because you'll know how to loop and kill time if they find you.
---
For skill check perks there's maybe two, that I remember? But honestly they're not worth it. You'll get better through time when it comes to skill checks (trust me, EVERYONE misses those) If you REALLY want a skill check perk I'd probably suggest Technician. 
---
When it comes to offerings I usually have a plan. Whenever I'm just playing normal games I only use the common brown bloodpoint offerings, and I usually don't bring items. When you're getting higher in that rank, however, you can use the items you saved up (Especially toolboxes) and such. Since there's a Bloodpoint event I would keep your high bloodpoint offerings for that, and get a tremendous amount more.
---
Ah camping. One of the most annoying things in this game. If a survivor is getting camped, don't try to get them unless you have borrowed time, and you're confident that you'll get them off the hook safely. if you can't, don't get them. Rush gens with the other survivors and get out. If that person is getting camped, just kind of think of it as they're buying you guys time to get the exit gates open. Camping is just one of those things where there isn't a cut and dry answer for, SOMETIMES, you can get them, sometimes you can get them after the exit gates are powered, sometimes you can't. It just depends on the situation at hand, And the killer (**Absolutely do NOT try to get the person if it's a Leatherface camping**) Through time, you'll know what you need to do. Good luck in the fog!
---
P.S: Your girlfriends loadout was exactly like mine whenever I started playing, down to the Feng Min character, pretty cool! Both of your loadouts are good for your levels.
---
I hate that totem spot so much. It literally **SCREAMS** cleanse me
---
nah
---
This is just a carry over from the old system. Originally each character would have one rare, one very rare, and one ultra rare perk (with the exception of the Halloween characters). Eventually ultra rare perks were switched to very rare, and these days we follow the same scheme for consistency's sake.
---
Devour Hope doesn't have anything to do with dull totems. You might mean Thrill Of The Hunt which makes totems take longer the more totems exist.
---
Yeah he stayed spectating the whole rest of the game and kept messaging me. Like dude, get a life.
---
June 14th - June 18th, starting and ending at 2pm ET.
---
June 18th is the current plan.
---
I'm wondering...
---
Could you run Ghostface's normal head with the Blood body for a more classic look?
---
Most people suck at skill checks when they first start. It becomes second nature after playing for a while.
---
Feng has one perk that helps with skill checks but that's it. I wouldn't recommend using it though, it's not very useful. 
---
A **lot** of perks are going to require you to level up multiple people. For starters I'd recommend David, Claudette, Laurie, or Bill.
---
This weekend.
---
No I was just thinking the totem activates when the perk activates, but I was just mistaken! Whoopsies.
---
Open a support ticket and pray to the entity.
---
BHVR says it’ll be fixed next patch. We’ll see.
---
What aboutinstead havehim have a lasso where he can pull survivors closer to him
---
Where'd you find this? I'd love to read it
---
Not many people would play this game as much or at all if they couldnt enjoy it with their friends. That's what makes it fun.
---
I've seen 70hrs survivors and killers at purple rank wdym
---
i'm late but thank you
---
Fuck
---
Well at least I’ll have a few days. Should be enough to satisfy me
---
IMO it's almost completely due to the aesthetic of the game, it's easier to empathize with the survival-horror gameplay we're all familiar with, and the human survivor characters, than it is the 6'8 mutant with a chainsaw and it's hunting gameplay.  I guess that group/gang mentality also plays a part, but trying hard to survive againt other players just *sounds* better than trying hard to kill other players. 
---
I know this is a crude example, but imagine if the game played exactly as it does right now, mechanically, only the killer is replaced by a malnourished African boy and the survivors are tourists trying to keep his lunch away from him. I think "killers" would take less shit
---
actually it's Ephebophilia  but good try though.
---
lol DS in the S tier.
---
Nope, you speak for me as well.  
---
No matter how good I think I do because I kill it with the evasion in one match, the next I can’t evade for shit.
---
Gotta stop them tunnels
---
Lol thats funny
---
**HOW DO I SAVE THIS VIDEO?**
---
Keep your politics out of video games, please.
---
*Kiitos mestari intensifies*
---
**ØINK**
---
Yes and I'm planning to
---
Sir, this is at least a meme of the quality 'nice'
---
Doesn't stop the slugs though.
---
You usually get a nice look on those pecks thanks to mori, so it's a win anyway.
---
Well thanks to your question I now know there even is a double bp event coming up (I don't really keep track of news), so thanks for asking 😂
---
I mean her UI on the plague sort of gives it away anyway for her.
---
Can you use it multiple times? I assume it's on a long CD then, but I see it's been changed to requring to have been hooked once which is a welcome change.
---
I agree. Been playing Legion at Rank 1 and I don’t see how people can legitimately think a Killer like Doc or Trapper is better than Legion.
---
Nobody can hit skillchecks 100% of the time, i get that. But being able to hit atleast 50% of those SCs reduces ruins effect _just a little bit_
---
I love that satanic Huntress omg
---
CALL 911 BECAUSE THIS VIDEO HAS ME DYING
---
Im freddy main :c
---
And is ez
---
I feel ya, I waited almost half an hour as killer before I left the lobby
---
FeelsGoodMan
---
I’ve been on this sub since long before 4 months ago and the Nintendo direct was the first I saw of it. That’s surprising because I thought that would be talked about more if it was known
---
She does, yes. Once it's fully charged, she's speed back up to slightly below her normal movement speed.
---
It’s because you don’t know how to play her that’s why you say she’s the worse
---
It was so easy to down them too. They were wasting so many pallets and only hit me with 2 and acted like they were outsmarting me.
---
10 meters from the nearest object and right in the open
---
**7 seconds fedora man bad**
---
I've been laughing at that for about 5 minutes
---
To be fair, it always looks lit so some people might not notice the difference.
---
boooo
---
its not an idk for me it works just some maps a no go its how players use them tbh trapper my more A tier if anything nurse is maybe b tier
---
Np lol
---
lol the music tho
---
For perks, I likd to run Sprint Burst, Borrowed Time, Self Care, and Urban Evasion.
---
I prefer Sprint Burst to either Balanced Landing or Dead Hard.
---
Urban Evasion is great if you like the stealth aspect of the game, which is the part I most enjoy.
---
Borrowed Time is borderline required to ensure you have safe unhooked so you can Pip.
---
Self Care is Self Explanatory
---
She definitely does, both while she is charging and while she is holding it. She has perks that reduce the amount is slowed by however.
---
I don't think the pad is fully bound. Do X and Y (□ and △) do anything? Also, I think you could use the active ability button to switch between them.
---
I LOVE COP TAPP. And I'm getting chute Dwight too.
---
Yea on a daily even when I lose I get hate. I ignore it for the most part, but man when they sends that salt after I win a Tbag flash swf, it feels refreshing.
---
Good catch. Didn’t notice that. I got the characters ASAP, so I didn’t even think about that
---
Damn, RES says that I've upvoted you 41 times but I can't imagine how
---
Good thing we have endgame. Also I usually just take that opportunity to farm some bloodpoints. Feels bad when the survivors are bm but that's just how it goes sometimes.
---
The wraith one reminds me of Xur from destiny
---
OOF THE WRAITH AND HUNTRESS YES PLEASE
---
I think it may be due to the survivors having mouse and keyboard too. I noticed that on PS4 as well. Easily got to rank 1. Only got up to rank 8 on PC before the resets
---
Freebird makes anything funnier
---
On live servers?
---
Giving No Mither a BP boost would kill the game. People obsessed with BP would run it every game and sabotage their own teams, while people who just wanna play the game are stuck with them and have games end super quick. My teammates go down in 15 seconds from full health as it is
---
That's like the opposite of my definition of noble lmao. You look up to noble people, I don't look up to people who hurt themselves because they can't control their perversions.
---
Man. I thought this was based on the actual Crow movie.
---
I know it wouldnt make complete sense but they could lore fuck it somehow.
---
It's a totem pAsS
---
Could they have seen my name in the lobby? Idk... either way I was really surprised when I got the message and it was someone in game. They were also messaging me while struggling so idk how they were doing both.
---
As a wraith main, I am happy
---
I sometimes use keyboard and mouse on Xbox, the only way to get the mouse to work is with a keymander. Also once you get it setup it only acts as the right stick so you’ll need use WASD to control the cursor in the lobby.
---
My point still stands, two instas (avoid death x2) dead hard (avoid death 1x or more) and adrenaline (avoid death 1x) right there bare minimum is 4 freaking times one can avoid a down, MoM just adds a fifth.
---
No Mither isn't supposed to be a strong perk, it's for people who want an added challenge like billy's speed limiter.
---
It still gets use, just not as much as before. I don’t see it anywhere as much with 3 or 4 people running it. Plus with the stipulation of needing hooked first, it does not rob a stack of BBQ. 
---
I don’t really see it as a problem.
---
How are you explaining to the random without game chat? Yikes.
---
I love Scott he explains things so well. He is the reason I play cause I followed him from ds3.
---
No there’s no way for them to see it. You’re either lying about this whole post or you got these messages from another time
---
The laughter really makes it. Same thing with spamming Freddy's mori. Just endless laughter from the worst killer in the game.
---
the best part is that the guy who gets downed instantly after the unhook always blames the killer. the other day, I hooked a Quentin, then threw a bottle from beside the hook. It revealed Claudette 3 feet away, who promptly tried to unhook him. I honestly tried to hit her, but auto aim sends me knife carrtening toward Quentin instead, who goes down in front of his hook. no Borrowed Time, no DS. he gets his second hook, and I left after the Claudette. he got unhooked again, but I found him several minutes later near the same hook, and finished him. naturally, he informed me that I was trash about the same time I finished the last of his buddies.
---
ok bruh.
---
I ended up entering the beekeeper! You can see my entry and a bunch of other people's awesome entrys on the dead by daylight forums. (My favorite is the sea themed hag so far)
---
I really like that Wraith outfit!
---
I find it a lot easier to hit great skill checks with ruin than without
---
Uhhhhh I’m not lying I have a whole huge chat from them ragging on me the whole time. I have no idea how they figured out who I was but they started messaging me in game.
---
I play on Xbox/PC in just know most of the problems I've heard on console have been on PS4 (from this sub)
---
Some of these could just be updates for the first. Going to skip the obvious like rank rewards or better specific gameplay mechanics. 
---
I’d like more character customization. Changing colors for hair and clothing so it adds just a bit more uniqueness even if two people are wearing the same outfit. More game modes with different objectives: survive the longest, multiple killer games, collecting items to build something. 
---
Wouldn’t mind having randomized weather. There may be a light sprinkle of rain on a map, or a heavy downpour. A light snow, or a blizzard. Maybe some sort of smoky/falling ash effect for indoor maps. I don’t really want offerings that could change it, just leave it all up to the entity. 
---
Uh.. daytime maps. Maps that aren’t spooky forest or tiny suburban areas repeated over and over. Maybe a large store, a mall, someone mentioned an arcade not long ago, caves, mansion, water park, theme park, cemetery, apartment building, etc. 
---
As far as killers, I don’t think suggestions are needed. There are always tons on here. 
---
So I guess basically just going “bigger” with the ideas from the first game, but leaving the core gameplay intact. Though they’d probably need like 10x more employees and 10x more players for this to happen.
---
Well it shows her once they’re broken but this would completely remove that
---
Tell that entity how you really feel haha. Super unlucky placement though for sure.
---
Funny so did I. Used to watch his ds3 pvp videos to practice ds pvp and now I watch him for dbd practice.
---
I still feel bad about this. My friend and I had taken a break from DbD so we were rank 20's, despite consistently getting to rank 3 or 4. So we go into a game and we end up going up against a huntress who couldn't hit a hatchet. Being used to high ranks, we looped her for practically the entire match and at the end she put into chat, "trash game, thought I would try it because of the free weekend but it is a waste of space". That was the last time I played survivor lmao
---
Uh. Jane? Why is she not top? 🤨 id be alllll over that
---
what does sandbag mean?
---
Are you my teammate in every one of my survivor games?
---
Its possible on PS4 if you go through a certain submenu in the dashboard's friends section. they could then use the app to text while having the game open. if you're on Steam, maybe they could do something similar. it takes dedication to their rage, but people do it often enough.
---
His carthus build still wrecks even though it's not meta anymore lol
---
It's a short list of good things. Scream 3 is everyone's least favorite child.
---
ok this IS stupid but what’s the deal with “exposed” and “exhausted” status affects? like what does this mean to the player/killer?
---
Yeah I play on PS4. He was playing swf with someone that had messaged me before and they were in the same “dbd people of the fog” group on the network.
---
Lol survivors on hook be like...
---
This an interesting strat and it was fun to watch. But this video makes me wonder about the direction that survivor perks are starting to go in. More and more, people who perform safe unhooks/saves are becoming tougher to take down. Isn't that going to encourage killers to just tunnel people who haven't had the chance to build up those perks yet?
---
lol
---
Are there any plans to improve the placement of totems? I'm currently rank 9 killer maining Myers, which means Ruin is very important for me, but 90% of the time it gets cleansed 1 minute into the game. Often I find the placements to be completely ridiculous.
---
I really hope they would make it so the totems can't spawn within a certain distance from a generator. It should actually be an objective to find and complete, like gens. This could also break up the perks survivors use, having them use more utility based ones like Small Game for example.
---
Very informative and detailed answers! I love it thank you!!! I do have one additional question if you don’t mind, the teachable perks are they always tier 1? Can they be leveled past that?
---
Idk how about pc but you can spy your killer on ps4 if their profile is public. You just check ‚currently playing with’ on side bar.
---
That leather jacket tho... 
---
*oink of approval*
---
Damn
---
Ah yes, I can fap to this
---
Hey look, it's ace.
---
My bad. I thought he had 2 kills and 2 on hook.
---
I recalled the wrong video.
---
There’s actually a guide to these in the in game tutorial section but to answer your question, exposed means you can be downed from the healthy state so you only have to get hit once. Exhaustion is tied to multiple perks (sprint burst, balanced landing, lithe, dead hard and head on) and can only be activated when you are not exhausted. For example sprint burst puts you into exhaustion when you first sprint meaning you cannot use any of the other perks until your exhaustion status effect is done. The only exhaustion perk that is the exception to that rule is adrenaline as it will activate regardless of if you are exhausted or not.
---
Ignore those assholes have fun with whatever perks/builds you like.
---
RIP old freddy
---
survivor cosmetics have always kind of skirted the corny line but for the most part kept it tame but it just seems now they're going over that line and starting to just dive into the deep end with the fortnite style cringy shit.. between 80's retro new wave glow stick shit, Pizza Delivery Dwight and now this Parachute shit.. I give it a year before there's Team Mascot aka Fursona David... passive aggressive daNEArys, Dummy Thicc Jane, Shaggy Dwight
---
yeah yeah.. I get it.. when you care more about pumping out cosmetics and DLC at a rate of every month or so rather then fixing your core game you run out of good ideas pretty fast and gotta start mining the shit at the bottom to keep it up. I feel like they probably have 4 artists employed for every 1 Dev they have that actually works on the game\code.
---
This was the moment where Michael Myers felt fear for the first time.
---
My vote is clown, imo most fun, if you play survivor at all tho Adam and Jeff are godsends in my opinion
---
the ol' etika
---
In a way, yeah. The meta perks are all about a second chance, DS, MoM, Adrenaline. Even dead hard if you mess up a loop can save your ass. Not much counter play to them either. You can wait out DS, bait DH, but stuff like deliverance, MoM and Adrenaline doesn't have a lot of counter play unless you want to lose the game.
---
Holy- that wraith is amazing
---
I know The Ghost: Soot (Only addon that does this for Wraith) does something like this. When you uncloak you have no terror radius or red stain for 6 seconds.
---
One of the creepiest addons to be on the receiving end of, because while you're being hurt and chased, no chase music plays, just the ambient music even though there's a killer hitting you (unlike EW1 M&amp;A Myers)
---
Combine it with the Coxcombed Clapper (Silent Bell) and you're absolutely terrifying. You just appear and start doing damage with no warning or change in music.
---
Nah it doesn't need a nerf. Maybe just a totem counter and more BP for cleansing.
---
It be like that
---
Ya, a nerf.. just make him totally unplayable. Makes sense /s
---
The minimum # of pallets on maps was increased around Plague's release which is when this started happening, iirc.
---
yeah the chainsaw through the back wasn’t in the original was it? i know it was in the beginning
---
Wouldn't it be especially if they already did get hurt?
---
Youre a cute circlejerker but how old are you fam?
---
Looks more like they're turning Ash Williams into another puppet.
---
also that leatherface looks so fucking stupid
---
I would be happy with being able to sell back unused items for even a ridiculously low amount.
---
It will be when you get stomped by a killer who did really bad all game but you were the NOED revealing person.
---
*but not problems like, “what is beauty?”*
---
Can't wait for survivors to mistake my leather piggy with the urban evasion Claudette &gt;:)
---
Insidious Leatherface?
---
Thanks for your service, Man. You're a hero to the meme community.
---
I just saw that post like 2 says ago after I searched gun lol.
---
Thats why i cleanse totems it not that hard.
---
You can have two items. You can't bring items to the trial.
---
I've had this happen to Michael in the middle of a game lol couldn't take it seriously and got killed
---
I'd be scared too. Ace just got slashed in the back and couldn't care less
---
I hope so, thinking about doing the same thing.
---
that's what he did then. there's a subsection in frineds that labeled something like people playing right now, and it shows anyone you're playing with, regardless of if you know them. in a DbD game, it will show 4 other people. the one who doesn't correspond to another survivor is the killer. you can then message them if their settings allow it. so you type their name in from the app, and now you can message them while the game is running. 
---
I'd imagine he used voice to text for that, and hit send with one hand while hitting "X to struggle" with the other. easy enough, if you're dedicated to borderline emotional instability.
---
Or it sounds like an elephant.
---
14-18 June. So this week.
---
Yes this is exactly what I do. Dailies are good for losing these toxic feelings. It's how I enjoy the game more
---
I hate when survivors stay at the gate, when there is no reason. Just leave so I can start a new game, I don't wanna walk from gate to gate to see your stupid teabag
---
Thanks for all the awesome advice everyone!!! I was kinda hesitant to post these questions cause I wasn’t sure how people would respond on this sub but I’m glad I did!! Y’all are awesome!!!!!
---
Only if they can't carry two of the same items. Double instant heal medkits would suck.
---
🤡
---
"Kids these days and their fancy video games"
---
Why is there even a button to invert... I've honestly never played a game where there is a 1 button press camera inversion. On top of that, this is a "fast paced?" game. Where a mistake could end your game extremely fast.
---
How did they get to "good ranks" if they are "bad"?
---
You mean nerfgion?
---
Ace loves Tposing so much that he gets nervous when he's about to perform to the killer and fucks it up sometimes 
---
They don't call him 'A pose Ace' at the campfire for nothing
---
I actually feel like maining Tapp now.
---
Who said hard? It's tedious, it's not fun to go around the map to find something for like 4 minutes (maybe 2 with small game) and then having your reward be: Yay! you spent so much time finding totems that 2 of your teammates died and only 1 gen is done, hope you had fun finding those totems! Just to rub it in your face at the end of the game, even if you managed to escape, the whole time the killer didn't have NOED.
---
I usually find that the only people who bother to click on self-promo here are the people who want to go and give that streamer a hard time. 
---
It’s the same for ppl with ttv in their steam name, it usually just brings hostility
---
What SameAsGrybe said
---
True.
---
I think he was prepared for it too. I downed him and he sent a message, hooked him and he sent another one, and then I downed him again right away to get rid of him and he sent me a couple more while struggling. Then I got these lovely messages once he was sacrificed.
---
It's all fun and games until NOED kicks in. lol
---
Michael Myers sounds like the dude going to the kitchen for a snack but doesn't want to wake people and leaves the lights off...and then bumps into the wall: "Auwghh!"
---
&gt;saving the last person  
---
HAHAHAHAHA. no. i'm saving my own ass.
---
Console player here can't relate.....
---
I used to have the clip of it lol you first see T Pose Myers peeking round a corner then just glide out. His knife was hoovering a foot above his head and when he picked my up to hook me I was also floating a foot above his head
---
https://imgur.com/Hr9FYZR
---
When you have someone on hook at the end of the game, but the other survivors all have mettle of man charged. That's just losing with extra steps.
---
This is the weirdest belittling and sarcasm I’ve seen..... wow....
---
Thank you! I tried my best to make it as thought out as possible. I thought of the theory after reading the clown's backstory, and realized most of the killers ingame were murderers in the real world, or murdered 1 person and could murder more due to the excitement of killing.
---
How was the killer cancerous?
---
New Killer: The Clam
---
He was insinuating that OP was stupid, so close enough.
---
yep
---
Are those Tapp outfits from the movie? I haven't seen the original SAW in a while but I don't remember them. Either I'm forgetting them or they were made specifically for DBD?
---
Leatherface With Insidious. 
---
Also this is 50/50 with people but I don’t like Noed
---
Whenever that happens I send a screenshot of their lifeless body on the ground
---
If you say so.
---
Heck no! Then you could just SWF and take turns 3 person DCing
---
Theres a big difference between Adrenaline and Noed. For Noed to proc you need to have failed, you didn’t put pressure or you committed to a chase for too long, while on the other hand Adrenaline gives you its bonuses when you have succeeded  by doing generators and surviving, the two main goals of the game. I play mostly killer (spirit &lt;3) and I never use Noed, but I always use Adrenaline. Though I agree the suggestion in this post is not the best.
---
Something... something.. NOED.
---
Camping usually holds you back regardless, but no one needs an excuse to tunnel or should even bother to look for validation. It's not *necessary* to rush the objective, yet it's still often the right play, competitively speaking.
---
...I play Legion exclusively since the rework. He is shit but you can make him work, I hit rank one relatively easy and can hold it and do ok unless I go against swf or I don't have iridescent buttons anymore. Removing him makes no sense, I like feral frenzy even though it's poorly designed
---

Who the hell says you "must"?
---
Farmer John, he’s kinda small but he’s funny and good at the game
---
It's a cool idea, if they could find a way to keep him from being a strictly M1 killer in areas with little or no crows.
---
&gt;aying
---
Ah that would make sense. Players at that level barely understand the game and much less have an understanding for what certain things mean. Good on you for trying to be nice and know that survivors at higher levels usually know what that means. I always thank killers when they give me hatch.
---
Im on xbox tho
---
I didn't mean to offend or make you clutch your pearls, but he's clearly a good killer if he 4Ks 90% of his matches, and RES says I've upvoted him 41 times so he's clearly a regular here. So he's either peacocking or being facetious.
---
Do you really care that much?
---
U wot now m8?
---
No I just thought you did the worst type of belittling or sarcasm you could do that actually made me chuckle, of course at you though. 
---
Unless it wasn’t Sarcasm or Belittling but then I wouldn’t know what to say to that sentence besides okay...
---
I'd rather see a dab than a teabag
---
As long as you play anyone but the pig, you should be alright.
---
I'm a simple man. I see Hoffman, I oink.
---
Yeah just gotta get them in the bloodweb :)
---
$10 bucks each I'm assuming?
---
Press r
---
I had stable 1 gb connection like I usually do. I think it’s actually like 879 mb but I can’t remember.
---
Why didn’t you take the hatch? Just curious.
---
Yeah it’s obnoxious when I land a bunch of hex skill checks in a row and then someone cleanses the totem and I get nothing but good skill checks the rest of the fucking game.
---
It might have been poor connections since so many people get connected to players out of their country
---
NOED procs if survivors fail to do totems. I would understand the complaints if it was completely without a counter. I don’t run NOED on any of my killers (unless  it’s a new killer with literally no other worthwhile perks) though I don’t get mad when killers run NOED, even if I’m the first to get smacked with it. I pretty much exclusively solo queue so I understand it’s not easy to keep track of totems on the map. I just don’t get the content complaints when it can literally be removed before it’s even a problem. 
---
Honestly I feel like killers should get a BP bonus for every totem not cleansed and chest not looted. While they aren’t actually “objectives” for survivors, they are still something to do outside of holding M1 on gens or looping the killer.
---
That was almost a haiku
---
R key on PC, if I'm not mistaken;
---
Don't know what it is on Xbob/PS, but it should be in control settings
---
My bad I assumed of course because of 3 obvious reasons you where cancerous. 
---
1. Insidious 2. NOED 3. Leatherface with that. 
---
I also can’t tell what game style you play but you gave me 3 obvious reasons why I believe you should be playing a camping style. 
---
Also it’s not Noed it’s more of the three combined. But if you take off Insidious it doesn’t seem that bad and I would’ve just been like well that player got punished for being stupid.
---
Seriously though, just leave.
---
Oh? Borrowed time and the nerfed ds? Please
---
Billy could've just played that differently
---
I’m confused why people keep putting We’re gonna live forever low
---
How could i live with myself if i didn’t take advantage of that double pallet.
---
Well when in doubt restart pc! 
---
That’s usually what I do then if that doesn’t work I search on the internet for reasons.
---
The Enter the Gungeon crossover I never knew I wanted!
---
Nurses calling doesn’t work with frenzy and thanataphobia is just a bad perk.
---
I like to run BBQ, Noed, Spirit Fury, and Enduring for my usual build.
---
I also recommend discordance to help combat gen rushing as well as Make your choice since you are a fast boy.
---
I do kinda think you do in my experience as Weak killers because you just get genrushed to hell it's quicker and easier to just tunnel the unhooked and camp them because some survivors just rush the hook like a maniac so you might as well punish it but this is just from my experience as I go against hook rushers and gen Jockeys most of the time.
---
Well I'm here to provide you with the information that I really don't like to face camp :) 
---
If you're issue is me using the perk at all though, can't say much there.
---
The perk provides blood points... that’s it,  it doesn’t bring anything extra to the table like bbq
---
You know what... you’re right. I’m sorry for being so wrong.
---
He's very easy to clean house with on console. Never had an issue with him.
---
Ooof
---
Yea, most def, there is no counter to adrenaline, especially with myers
---
I know you're saying stuff as a legion is pig, but here are my counter points on the legion stuff.
---
Those easy first hits are great tho, delays the game, and makes downing them easier. Looping isn't just a legion thing, but what legion can do is frenzy hit th looper and find other targets. Besides, even if an injured survivor is y looping, still useful to frenzy hit them. Fatigue isn't that big of a deal, you can still see where the survivor went. His power is a tool, not a kill spell. It's not meant to kill, just harm. I play legion add-on free and he's just fine. You not having fun with legion is a fair point, but still a point that affects you and is not universal.
---
I agree with the pig stuff tho, I like pig.
---
I did restart it, that and my internet. Couldn’t find anything specific, so now I’m relying on reddit to see what it offers
---
Circle on ps4. Square(?) on xbox. r on pc.
---
Play Billy against good survivors and tell me how it goes.
---
It’s more like evidence that you may be a camper then anything. I don’t like Noed it’s cheap to me but if you aren’t camping then I have no reason to call you cancerous in any means necessary. So sorry about that and I will delete this comment for false information and falsely accusing you of something you don’t do.
---
If Huntress goes to a locker to reload her axes but a survivor is hiding in there, does she reload or grab them, or both?
---
Ahh sorry to hear I hope you figure out the problem. 
---
You know it could just be a bad internet connection in your town right now. I have no idea where you live or the weather.
---
Do killers like getting that last free hit? Like the survivor clearly could’ve escaped earlier but maybe the killer gets points from it?
---
Why? He’s so handsome
---
My eyes... Dark mode and this do not match... Love the work tho
---
Why does Ghostface's knife look like the blade of woe from skyrim lol
---
"KiLlEr OwNeD bY FaCtS aNd LoGiC!"
---
The other night, I decided to be a smartass and tbag at the gate. Noed had popped, one person was waiting to die on hook, basically I had no reason to be staying there. The killer was hillbilly, and so I hear the chainsaw rev up. I just continue tbagging away.
---
I thought I was close enough to the finish line that if I went down, it'd count as an escape.
---
I was wrong. I'm downed and carried away to my death hook, just a few feet away from freedom. I got shat on in post game chat. I deserved it. :( 
---
Lesson? Don't fuck with noed. Or any risky moves at the gate.
---
What do totems do anyway
---
My condolences.
---
I nod as Billy when I'm carrying a survivor because I one it looks goofy as fuck
---
Then you'll be able to rubber band anywhere!!
---
Bad meme gone worse
---
I'm not good at this game :(
---
Only one person has hair on the top of their head. Even though the Ormond photo shows them all with hair.
---
I never looked at the leaked alpha info, so this is news to me.
---
Finally, skins for my pig queen! And that Huntress skin is black metal as fuck! I love all of these!
---
I like to bring a shroud and watch people DC when I down them after hooking them
---
Updates create more bugs rather than fix them. We truly do live in a society
---
Honestly I think they simply did that to stop the hair from clipping through the hoods.
---
The only reason that they did it with Susie was because her hair came over her shoulders so there was no issue with it clipping.
---
How does OoO shut down Hag?
---
Furthermore she's one of the best bc a good Hag can single handedly lock down an entire area on the map and defend gens stupidly well. A bad Hag, which you sound like you are, can't do any of that.
---
i feel like the only mf who cant play against freddy. i literally have a way easier time playing against nurse or huntress than against freddy. not a question but i felt like venting this, anyone else have that problem?
---
Anyone know if they fixed the vigil causing exhaustion to last longer bug?
---
You counter the salt with being ruthless. I've stopped being nice except sometimes letting the last guy go if it's been a slaughterfest for me. If you try to play "fair" and get flamed, then the flaming gets to you. If you try to win to the best of your abilities with no mercy, I find their salt doesn't affect me the same way as had I played nice.
---
I've experienced this as well on XB1. It seems like I get a pip or double pip every match, but I've been stuck at 15 for a couple of weeks. I assumed it's just cause I sucked. LOL!
---
I know that's why they did it. I was just saying it'd look funny to have cosmetics that only add some hair that sticks out of the hood.
---
That "Hahahahahahaha" really convinced me that it's not salt.
---
That's why I get bullied as baby Nurse rn. So I can bylly back later &gt;:D
---
A-hyuck
---
I've never thought of just standing motionless as Meyers. Fucking brilliant!
---
Hmm, true. But possibly he is needing to be fed by the sacrifices to keep protecting people by taking from our world the murderers and evil-doers.
---
Nah bc when you run it with Deja Vu, OoO, and Self Care, it is the supreme meme build
---
Thank fuckong god
---
Yea imagine having useless teammates that go down easily... Not like that already doesn't happen even with survivors that have 4 meta perks and are purple/red ranks.
---
Outside of BP events it isn't like people use WGLF all the time or Prove Thyself. 1 of which is a do-nothing perk and the other a really good gen perk.
---
You really think people would run No Mither en masse if it gave bonus BP more than the other BP boosting perks?
---
I feel the same. I expected this on the game but not at Lery's.
---
No, it's spotty, works sometimes, other times it doesn't, but you can at times see the killer's name before the match even begins. I once got a message saying "play hard" before the match even started. It was from a friendly survivor I met earlier, who enjoyed how intense the match was and wanted round two.
---
Someone else mentioned this, but they do it this way so they can change values without people ever knowing.  Especially if the in-game effect is hard to gauge on the fly.
---
BHVR would rather you feel like you're going crazy and swear that something faster/slower/etc than actually give hard information and have people call them out for it
---
Outside of Ghostface which they may or may not fix - and I don't think they'll do anything good with him either - Legion is these developer's biggest killer failure. Legion was terrible when he was first released, and they found a way to make him terrible in a different way. They don't know what they are doing, and they don't have a clue how to fix it.
---
This rework was a salad of trash mixed with a side of "normal movement speed". A ham-fisted intelligence-insulting attempt at humor when no one's laughing. A pure panic job of "we have to do SOMETHING to stop these DCs" with no thought put behind it. He's a laughingstock; a meme.
---
I did have a little hope that he would be reworked to something good a few months ago but I was wrong to give them 1% of that hope. Hope is for suckers with these people. I won't let these developers off the slack for anything future rework or new release when it comes to killers. They DO NOT think killers should be viable - from their own mouths and they went out of their way to prove it with Legion by giving him the weakest power in the history of this game (or second worse if Ghostface stays the same).
---
Can a good killer make chicken salad out of chicken shit? Sure, on the right map with the right survivors with the right perk loadout, on the right day. But that's the actual person doing it despite a garbage character, not because of it.
---
I'll pass
---
That's how I did it my first couple times
---
It's OK, it was just a joke.  Now I need to get these jello treats ready for my boy scout meeting.  Take care!
---
A long ass time ago [I made a vaguely unbalanced killer concept](https://i.redd.it/gupcmer9mwj01.png) like this too. Crow based killers are always interesting.
---
I die for randoms last minute way to much, it’s a problem

---
Many survivors don't know the timing
---
Hex: Ass Eater
---
Space Coconut, Minute DbD, Croquedead, Spectrobyss, Evil Cynthia and Michi. Michi said that Hag has a much higher skill ceiling, but she still doesn't reward enough for that ( and she's a legendary Hag main, how could've heard about her if you defend Hag so much ? ), Space Coconut said tht Hag is still reliant on survivors mistakes and Minute DbD said that flashlights destroy traps 24/7 and coordinate teams can dictate what person Hag is  chasing by triggering her traps and so, negate her a potentially early kill.
---
[Here's](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fHo7l65W01b-j9QSYCPvFS7hu5tpoHeD) what it will look like
---
Can't wait.
---
You gotta cleanse BEFORE that totem activates.
---
I feel like you're overthinking this.
---
That’ll make those survivors scream for sure
---
Imagine this but with Nurse
---
Same. I started with Wraith. It gives you a good idea where survivors like to hide around while cloaked
---
agreed. hell, i barely know the timing/angle. i had to play KYF to figure it out
---
Such a shame that Legion broke his ankles. He could've been the pallet crusher we've been wishing for.
---
I think the heavy panting from the Legion comes from the fact they’re themed like a pack of wild animals - ‘Feral Frenzy’, ‘Killer Instinct’ etc. They’re supposed to be all animalistic.
---
They pant like dogs, including on the menu, cause they’re an edgy teenage wolf pack.
---
I only know the timing from playing against SWF groups as a killer
---
Neither do I, but consider say, Germany, where the original mortal kombat had to replace blood with green splatter.  If I remember correctly, it was outright banned in AUS.  BHVR doesn't have to only answer to horror fans when deciding what to include.  Honestly, I'm surprised some of the moris made it in as they are.
---
Or maybe even a campaign with a good story that Involves more of the entity
---
So all of these god tier hag mains specifically told you that she's trash against SWF? Lmao. 
---
To address their points tho. 
---
Michi I actually agree with, there needs to be more reward for good Hags considering her skill demand. Especially when You see that killers like Billy are considered on par or superior to her. Which I find to be complete bullshit but that's a different story. 
---
Space Coconut is only partially correct. A good Hag player has a lot to deal with if the Surviviors run Urban Evasion, but a good Hag player forces different decisions to be made, which slow down the game and give her the time she needs to secure an area. 
---
Minute DBD doesn't really take into account that destroying her traps is a double edged sword since you can see what trap is destroyed and that tells you "oh there's a Survivior here let's go over there".
---
Ah. Forgive me. I have a mild case of severe brain damage

---
A great idea to do is to choose one killer, and main that killer. After that, people change their strategy to fit that killer, and their power. A good thing to note is that kicking generators is a good idea if you don't think survivors are around, thats how I started.
---
Lol look at him as if his mixtape is good
---
No, they said to me that she is countered by SWF teams, you said to me that she can compete with them.
---
Who do you see a lot of? Also what rank? Genuinely curious
---
Yep, saw this a loooong time ago while looping and went "Huh...this bed has a body in,it *peeks in* Ohhhh.....weird"

---
The survivors wasting the killers time by forcing them to walk into the exit to avoid that particular survivor coming back in for a save or such. The killer, if they are already passing by, should do it to eliminate a variable in their endgame.
---
Someone said a racial slur online and it’s the end of the world lol.
---
I use to be killer main but became a survivor main cause killer got kinda old for awhile. But I’d say till you get a handle on killer side and get some better killer perks I’d say play billy at low to mid ranks he’s strong with a weak build, especially if you get your chainsaws down (he’s strong in general but you get what I mean). Once you understand how survivors work from a killer perspective then switch to whatever killer you want to actually learn. Other than that man it’s no different than getting good at survivor, practice lol.
---
Killers: Camping and tunnelling is a legit strat
---
Also killers: Why tf do I always get genrushed? Nerf the fucking gens, they're done too quickly.
---
I've seen more double pallets since the last major patch. So much for being fixed.
---
Thanks for your answer. I’ll try that out. You’re prolly right.. guess I need more practice. Doing mistakes and practicing as a killer is a lot more punishing tho
---
CLEAR THE FUCKING DEAD TOTEMS TOO

You do have a point, it's not noble, but, I personally don't like it, others do, and I can't call you a bad person for having an opinion, and an opinion which makes sense no less. Let's just agree to disagree, and have my upvote for your intelligent argument.
---
NO I BEING HIT WITH NOED IT TURNS ME ON
---
I would enjoy you being my killer. 
---
I had one yesterday do a total bro move, right at the start the guy that started next to me was AFK for a few minutes. the killer came up on us and stopped and looked at him for a minute to see if he would start moving, he didn’t, so the killer left him alone and came after me instead. The afk guy came back and died that match, but it was awesome that the killer gave him a fighting chance.
---
Imagine being the kind of person who watermarks their memes. While using other people's images, no less.
---
I'll be honest. Survivors, generally, are too stupid to realize you're being nice. You'll pick them up a half dozen times, take them to your totem, escort them to gens, and they'll still act like you're going sicko mode on them. Better to just hook them and get it over with.
---
Xbone?  Just report them.  There are lousy people everywhere, no need to tolerate their hate.
---
It does matter if you DC. If you're going for Evil Incarnate achievement you get fucked out of it if the player DC's, even if it's mid-animation. [Like this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9hkeHDbKZs) 
---
IMHO people who do this are absolute scum considering how difficult it is to even hit tier 3 with tombstone + tuft of hair (I couldn't even hit it once with just Tombstone Piece + myers memorial) let alone get a 4K. The match is literally already over yet you go out of your way to deny an achievement to someone who did it fair and square. 
---
So yes, it matters. You think I'm happy when the first 8 attempts at Blood On Your Face (Mori all 4 survivors) were cucked by the last dude DCing mid-animation? (Not including the times when people would just suicide on the hook. I had to start waiting to hook every one once first before I started Moriing to pretend I had a Cypress one aka mori the last guy, to prevent suiciding)
---
I think the pip system broke in general lol. I can have a 13k bp game as survivor and almost double pip and then have have a 23k bp game and barely pip. Unless your trying to get away from face campers in yellow rank I wouldn’t sweat it just have fun. There’s plenty of reasons to not enjoy this game I wouldn’t let pips be one of em.

I started two weeks ago thanks to gamepass.  It was suggested here that I start with either Trapper or Hag.  I didn't love Trappers aesthetic soI went with Hag.  Honestly I can't picture using anyone else at this point.  She's just so much fun once you get the teleporting down.
---
Yup looks like steam went down for a bit.
---
There's an explanation for that: 
---
The dark side is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
---
The players. In other games when you lose you blame your team mates or yourself. In this game people blame their opponent for beating them. It’s inane to me.
---
Darn, that's a real shame because it looks like the devs who made the skins worked real hard on them
---
Gotta love survivors that just feed themselves to you.

Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Pretty much who I figured, thank you.

I miss when they gave 100 thousand and even more

But everytime a killer is taken it basically opens a rip in reality and if anyone goes to that place the entity pulls them in for sacrifices I don't think something that is trying to do good would hurt innocents like that it also tortures some of the killers until they become a thing that wants to kill remember some of these killers aren't bad people they just did something violent then the entity would torture them until they become killers

*docs and maybe crows
---
Jokes on you... I wasn't planning to sleep tonight anyway.
---
Oi sry mate carry on
---
This is BS man, I searched using Chinese and I found nothing, please don't spread BS around
---
I think it comes asl part of the new DLC cosmetics
---
Except it isn't true, I never prioritized survivor happiness. And it being more difficult (because of comms or coordination) doesn't even affect a lot of killers. People are always looking for a reason why they lost. Whether it be "the killer was camping/tunneling" or "swf is ruining the game." SWF does not equal a win, and good killers are good either way
---
Oh my i diddnt knoe thaaat
---
Saw 1 amanda is best skin
---
This same argument could’ve been made for the old mending bar though
---
Where are the Chinese researchers? Link them please
---
It's rarely personal. It's just a part of the dbd experience in my eyes.
---
To cure his chlamydia
---
&gt;  This has been well-documented by the Chinese fans 
---
Link me the sources, i can read Chiense, ill tell you right away if its BS, but so far you provide nothing
---
On average I’ll run into a slugging killer about 20% - 25% of the time
---
That’s... that’s the point. To prevent slugging and/or tunneling the broken survivor just because they’re broken
---
the t-bags and 360's just to rub it in that I got rinsed by a SWF.   I get it, discord is OP
---
I've had this experience for the first time yesterday..
---
"I think I'll try killer!"
---
2 swfs later and being harassed for camping while exit gates were open and generally not knowing how to play the game as a rank 19 killer.
---
Yep, no more salt unless i get tunnellled from this point forward.
---
I would become a survivor main in the fucking spot
---
Counterpicking perks isn’t a good idea though, and maybe it’s just me, but I never notice crows as killer
---
Tapp mains rise up
---
Literally
---
So if the Killer were to constantly nod at you, it would all be the same to you right?
---
I'm currently on a low sodium diet, and I found playing killer is an excellent salt alternative.
---
I teabag if there is a hook right next to it so I can deliverance, teabag again and then get put back on hook
---
Yo new Quentin cosmetic?
