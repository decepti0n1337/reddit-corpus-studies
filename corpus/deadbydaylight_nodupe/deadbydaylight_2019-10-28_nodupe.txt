&gt; Myers can‚Äôt throw his knife 50 feet

---
have you ever been in tier 3?
---
---
---
there isnt. i just had it as a personal goal
---
Survivor on PS4 has had noticeably bad queue times, in my experience. But it‚Äôs been like that for a while now. Killer times are quick for me, though.
---
Where is this taking place? Is there a game con somewhere?
---
This is a fair assessment and the type if dialogue I was hoping to see.  Right now, there is more slugging in the game than at any other time.  Obviously, this is a killers response to the gen speed in the game.  I haven't played with a survivor yet that enjoyed being slugged.  
---
To me, this demonstrates poor balance.  Most of the fun in DBD happens during a chase.  What could be done to promote this type of game play.
---
Play with your food?
---
Yeah I am killer and it‚Äôs super quick to go in matches yesterday and day before
---
Horror know-how: Being into the industry has taught you more things than the average joe. One of the killer's perks will be revealed to you, and only you at the start of the match.
---
‚ÄúI only use these perks because of the BS meta builds the other guys use‚Äù
---
- Both survivors and killers. And so the cycle continues.
---
I love the logic of genrushing. It's not even funny, a friend of mine's mentioned he's in a Discord server where one of the users just posts in the ranty section about how survivors "genrushing" are toxic and cancerous. How is doing the objective toxic? What do you want a survivor to do? Teabag and flashlight you all the time?
---
It's very RNG-based. On some games with poor luck and not so great team, the killer will win.
---
On other games it'll get destroyed early or you and at least one other team mate can power up gen after gen despite ruin.
---
Just stop letting it get to your head man. This game is unique as every match is very personal compared to say a match of Fortnite. This kind of community you need a thick skin for, think Rainbow 6 Siege.
---
My brother has Surveilance but not Discordance. Is Surveillance good enough, because I have heard good and bad things about it. Other than that, he‚Äôs got a decent number of the perks you suggest so it will probably be a big help!
---
wait, i'm somewhat new here, what was a map post?
---
They capped it so you can‚Äôt instantly P3 a new killer or a survivor and have to grind
---
Killer speed. 4.4 means the killer moves at 110% movement speed. The survivors move at 100%, most killers are faster than survivors (except the Nurse).
---
I need it
---
I think it's in Japan, but I'm not sure where specifically or which con!
---
Her speed without Blood Lust. Normal killer speed is 4.6, but a handful of killers are slower, like Huntress, Nurse, Hag and a couple others.
---
You can‚Äôt do that then they‚Äôll think that works
---
Weird. Was thinking you might play spirit :D
---
What rank are you at? People at lower ranks tend to dc and I imagine kill themselves faster than you see at red ranks. But it also gets harder to double pip at reds...
---
You could just not tunnel every single survivor, ya cunt.
---
Ohhh i like that one too. But with swf it would probably mess with the killer since they can just say what one of their perks is.
---
Play Wraith, you'll find survivors easily.
---
Do bones.
---
Protection hits have always been weird. Don‚Äôt get your hopes up for any changes anytime soon.
---
I agree with all you said, except generator repair. I think this effect should be left for killer add-ons and Sloppy Butcher because imagine a Leatherface/Hillbilly with chainsaw add-ons that apply mangled paired with Sloppy Butcher paired with a  Power Strike that decreases Gen repair speed and also inflicts deep wound. It would be nightmarish.

I‚Äôm not hating. It‚Äôs 0 effort and no one can say ‚Äúoh hey look it‚Äôs Nea from dead by daylight‚Äù

I messed up on a generator and meg‚Äôs wig blew off. I could not stop laughing. Then it happened later on in the match when the killer picked me up. I was literally done at that point üòÇ

Survivors tend to hang out around generators, so look for them there. They'll hear you coming, so decide if you want to check around nearby structures if the gen you were investigating sounds like it's been worked on. But don't waste too much time looking for them!
---
Also remember that (while it isn't visible to you) you have an extremely visible red glow where ever you are looking, a few feet in front of you. Survivors will know which way you are coming from, even from around the corner, because of that glow. If a Survivor is looping you and you can break LoS but know they're on the other side of the wall, try walking backwards/sideways to hide your glow until you strike, it'll help you catch up in the loop.
---
Also consider picking up tracking perks. Whispers at Tier 3 is a fantastic perk, it will let you know when Survivors are in a certain radius around you. For that reason, it's great: You won't waste time looking for Survivors in an area where they aren't, because Whispers will not be lit up, so you know for sure they're not there. When it does light up, you should be able to deduce an idea of where they are within your radius.
---
Also, make sure you listen! Survivors make noise from breathing, walking through certain grass, running, being injured, using a locker, searching... pretty much everything other than slow vaults. Make sure your audio is turned up. 
---
Play Survivor! If you don't already, try it. It will give you a great idea of what Survivors do when the Killer approaches. Try taking Bond too, so you can see what distant teammates do as well.
---
I also recommend watching DBD Streamers/Youtubers.  [TrU3Ta1ent](https://www.youtube.com/user/TrU3Ta1ent) got me into the game, and recently I've discovered a love for the handsome Spaniard  [not Otzdarva](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDO__Z-tZD4bfG9m4AkK_uA). Definitely check them out, those are just two, there are many fantastic content creators in the community. Observing their gameplay will teach you so much.
---
Stand on the hatch if they jump through you can grab them or you can try and close it
---
Oh. I use OoO a lot because I really suck at chases and I want to get lots of practice and be better. Would that be considered lame or toxic?
---
From what I understand, their entire staff does not work on Dead by Daylight; a sizeable portion works on Death Garden, is that game out? I know nothing about it but I've seen some gameplay and I don't see the appeal. If I had to guess what all their time makes up, it's making new maps and a new killer every 3 months. It's a pretty bad schedule since they have to juggle patches, making new maps and characters, and making cosmetics. IMO, I would much rather they take a cycle off and balance the game as is and release a killer after 6 months rather than have a poor game with 1, probably mediocre, killer.

Oh I was wondering why you deleted it.

Legion is my spirit animal.
---
1. Slug them and hope you find the last guy at hatch.
---
2. Just take the 3k and gg
---
Considering they have to waste a perk slot for something that could potentially be wiped out in the first 30 seconds of a match, I'd say so.
---
This is something you should put into the bug reports section on the forums.
---
Clown  has a santa suit of it really matters

You look great!

The hag is my BITCH

We GET each other

We both are just so fucking thirsty for that big beefy murder boi
---
Really? I had no idea it was popular with gaymers!
---
That is such a weirdly feelsgood comic ?
---
In no order, I think his best perks are 
---
Ruin. Whispers. Brutal Strength. Monitor n Abuse. STBFL. Infectious Fright. BBQ. Nurses calling. 
---
I personally run the first 4.
---
How are people upvoting this.  Deep wounds is fucking useless
---
Says who?
---
I thought so, thanks. That's what I usually do, but I haven't really looked up anything yet, just been learning on my own and wanted to make sure there wasn't a better way.
---
Honestly when it comes down to it the Legion are pretty much the most well designed faces that are under masks.
---
I really wish they would give Ghostface to come here emote. I've been using Rancor lately because I love watching his Mori and it would be great to tell nearby survivors to come join in the picture.
---
It's gotta be Richtofen
---
I‚Äôve been part of random groups on Xbox and most have been good experiences lol. There are a lot of weird people out there though haha
---
I would get all dlc's that you cannot buy with ingame iredescent shards. So the Halloween chapter, leatherface, ghost face and nightmare on elm street.
---
Haha oh noes shes about to get gangra....ok nevermind.
---
This remind me of a game me and my bud did against a Freddy before rework
---
He was having a hard time catching any of the survivors losing us at first glance. Anyways he finally downs my friend and right when he picks him up and start walking the meg slams a pallet the second the pallet hit he D/C it was hard not to feel bad for him.
---
I agree. I actually think *Deliverance lmao* is better than adrenaline at low ranks seeing how you don‚Äôt escape often and some people actually won‚Äôt hook you. But once you get past like rank 12 it‚Äôs useless and laughable at red ranks imo
---
Thank you for the build suggestion, I really need the help evidently.
---
anyone who played the switch version? That literally runs on the dedicated servers. Consistent 30-60 ping games. Only issue is still the shitty hit boxes survivors have they are size of a 500lb man when it‚Äôs a tiny ass feng min
---
While never explicitly looking for groups, I have been invited in to survive with friends a few times, usually just pretty standard folks. Only real interesting one I had was a group of women who all seemed to be mothers as they talked on about their kids and the sort while playing like I wasn‚Äôt even there. Nice people overall though.
---
I've met some great people playing DBD on xbox but yeah I've also come across quite a few weirdos.
---
We have taste
---
isnt he too fat to get into a locker
---
Hopefully, reported him the moment i got the message, regardless of how a person plays they should never receive messages like that.
---
cosplay is what ruins this community, change my mind
---
It seems to get worse the higher the rank.
---
lol kys
---
No, playing demogorgon definitely does not help, haha. I just started playing a little lover 2 months ago and I started out with hillbilly. Definitely not good on your favorite map but is good on most others, at least outdoor ones. I think he's one of the faster moving killers and he also has a chainsaw Sprint which allows him to move around the map quickly. Try him out but don't expect to use his chainsaw Sprint to hit people at first just to patrol generators quickly. You're going to get looped a lot when you first start out, so learn how and when to give up on a chase quickly. Don't let your ego get in the way, when I first started if they looped me twice I abandoned the Chase and went and checked the nearest generator. Just focus on patrolling generators and you should have some decent success. That's why I think he is good for beginner because he can quickly move around the map patrolling.
---
Or just grow up and chase someone unless you worthless cunt?
---
This is a pretty major thing. Behind it
---
If you suck at huntress, iridescent head is just going to make your time even worse.
---
I've played so much Transit that the Richthofen announcer voice stuck in my head
---
Reported him right after taking that screen shot. I can't think of a good reason as to why someone would feel the need to send something like that.
---
For survivor: probably Alert. It just helps me keep track of the killer when I‚Äôm not in a chase with him
---
For killer: probably bbq for the info and bloodpoints
---
OPEN THE GAME!!
---
No problem! Good luck on your games!
---
What was the average amount you got after a game from that perk
---
what rank are you then? cuz jesus, that was like a 7 years old threatening someone on xbox 360 with a message
---
I wasn‚Äôt aware looping was a problem.
---
I‚Äôd love for that logic to be true for both sides of the aisle here but it just isn‚Äôt. Survivors don‚Äôt even need items to be considered threats at red ranks and yet if a killer that isn‚Äôt Current Nurse spawned into a fight without addons, survivors are gonna run circles around them. This gets even worse when survivors run items.
---
Killers are shoehorned into running specific addons in order to be viable into red ranks unless you are one of the big 3 (soon to be the big 2). Do you wanna get to red rank with Plague and *not* have suicidal tendencies by the time you get there? Load up the apples. Or Wraith? I hope you have plenty of Windstorm addons. 
---
For most killers addons are not the same ‚Äúfun and customizable gameplay augments‚Äù that items are for survivors, they are necessities to be viable in the upper echelons of play. 
---
*That* is emblematic of bad balancing
---
Carrie's Survivor should Be Chris so we can finally have an evil survivor.
---
Chris' perks.  
---
1.She gets faster when a teammate gets hooked
---
2. If she hides in a closet, a different survivor will get exposed to the killer, getting the attention out of her.
---
3.She set up a bucket in an indoor area as a trap. The bucket can stun the killer. Only one bucket per game.
---
as a killer i'm only rank 14
---
I depipped to 14 because I was going for the tombstone, now Im climbing back up to reds with killers I don't play, 10 currently, I think.  
---
  
---
And yeah spirits is awful. I gave up on hers lmao
---
I haven‚Äôt used LFG but I did notice that Xbox survivors disconnect way more often than PS4 survivors.
---
Behvr: nerf
---
Perk:I broke now
---
Behvr: excellent
---
This girl got some balls man, Jesus Christ...
---
I swear by Spine Chill at this point; having that early warning is very nice against all killers, but it is a major help to know whenever a stealth killer is about.
---
I'm rank 12 at killer rank 16 survivor I'm trash at survivor fear not
---
"Cloak mode activate!"
---
Yesssss! So annoying!  I'll get a survivor daily (finally), get out of the daily screen and when I go to look at it again, it's changed to a killer daily.  Again.
---
All my friends are on modern warfare so I had no choice. Solo queue didn't go any better.
---
The only key you slap add-ons with that aren't milky glass and key ring.
---
Im also on xbox and ill never play with other people besides my friends on this game the xbox community cant be trusted
---
How do i grow a beard
---
The actual trick is to pick and choose when to stalk. If there's 2 people 99% (or close to) and chase the other. When the other goes down and you go back for the person who is ready to be instadowns you'll have a ton of pressure on the game.
---
Is this Terrorism?
---
This
---
Then again, they make some nifty gadgets.
---
‚ÄúGuess I‚Äôll just hold this...‚Äù
---
I'm solo and it's working well for me. At least for the moment.
---
Chuckie might work as a duo with tiffany.  He will piggyback on Tiffany's shoulder  so they will be tall enough to hook the Survivor. The player can switch at will between Chucky and Tiffany,  The other will be an AI. Their gameplay will be like the gameplay of Resident evil revelations 2.
---
did anyone else burst out laughing when this happened in the theatre?
---
I don‚Äôt defend noed. I think it‚Äôs poorly designed.
---
However, given how skewed towards survivors the game is, I understand the almost necessity for it to exist.
---
There just isn't many people looking for groups right now. And a lot aren't looking for experienced players. They're yellow ranks getting a feel for he game.
---
Chris and Jill can do martial arts, it will be lame to see them getting overpowered by Susie.
---
Ideally you would slug the 3rd and go for the last one. But as a survivor I hate when that happens. I'd still consider a 3k with a hatch escape a win though.
---
You need to learn how to assert map pressure for one. You can use your portals to zoom across the map so the goal is to place them in non obvious spots and in ways to go back and forth between generators to keep survivors from finishing their objective. You want to drag the game out, you do this by keeping survivors from finishing generators. Patrol them and regress them as often as you can. Sometimes you need to break away from the player looping you and go back to patrolling and looking for other survivors. There are lots of YouTube videos on how to play killer well generally and also specific ones for each killer. Watching them will help a ton.
---
Slug. if the survivor knew where the hatch was once you downed the other person go see if they‚Äôre at the hatch they‚Äôre usually waiting there
---
Sometimes I'll just crouch beside a gen like I'm doin skill checks and be real immersed for lulz
---
I just played Leatherface and someone DCd the second they saw me and the other was a flashlight flickering tea bagger who DCd when I downed him after 5 seconds. I let the last 2 farm.
---
Sadly my Xbox DBD friends are on the new Cod.
---
That last panel is giving off some serious Dream Warriors vibes.
---
Yeah, there are a lot of moms on this game. It's sweet.
---
Then what is the perk for besides tunneling? Am I missing something?
---
Your already got 3 kills. That's already a win.
---
people like you ruin this community
---
I used to use premonition but it doesnt warn you about killers like myers and ghostface so now i think of spine chill as a better version of premonition
---
He‚Äôs talking about cross map hatchets, the ones you hit on survivors who get their aura revealed by BBQ and Chili.
---
I love how when Ghost Face came out, everyone was afraid to use him in red ranks. Now, everyone who actually knows how to play a stealth killer can mop trials no problem with him. Tru3talent be giving the wrong advice about him though.
---
Neither are keys, totem spawns, gen times, or the BS that is map structure.
---
Yet at least half of that shit there is radio silence on changing
---
Thing is instadown addons take more skill even iri head is balanced it's just the fact the downside doesn't trump other addons unlike instaheals are just hit button get free heal
---
Ghostface uses cologne for attention of his presence. That's actually really creepy in context with a victim alone in their home, suddenly having a strong smell erupting from inside the house.
---
EDIT: I made a mistake with the rarity of one of Trapper's add-ons! Please let me know if I made a mistake in the rarities because I will fix them ASAP! [http://www.mediafire.com/view/wyhyujxtx0bpt6g/iconAddon\_coilSpring.png](http://www.mediafire.com/view/wyhyujxtx0bpt6g/iconAddon_coilSpring.png)
---
yea then they respond with "its ur connection lmao". People with bad internet are dumb.
---
XD
---
Low effort shitpost gang rise up
---
a rank system that you can't opt out of... there's no distinction between casual and competitive, and the game certainly isn't balanced well enough to be considered competitive. not to mention the rank literally means nothing seeing as you'll hit rank 1 every month just by playing if you put the time in.
---
I main Ghost, but never relied on camping the hooked survivor in stealth to mark the rescuer as easy of a down that sounds. You are completely in the right. 80% of the time, I see below average Ghostfaces who either camp hooks or run carelessly in the open, thinking they're invisible.
---
kill count: the death of your team fills you with vigor to finish the job they failed to do - for every survivor sacrificed gain a %/%/% increase to opening the exit gate. if any survivor is moried then this bonus is doubled
---
golden chainsaw: who wants the hero to die in a dull fashion - for every chase escaped (and killer stunned) gain a token at every token slows down your hook progression up to \*/\*/\* tkens
---
a spectacular kill can really entertain - for every moried survivor each survivor gets a %/%/% bonus to repairing
---
dull machete: who wants an off-screen kill - injured hooked or downed survivors increases the speed of altruistic actions by %/%/%
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
every dead teammate will make the rest better (you don't bring it for the mori bonas its just for a little extra oof)
---
Mate if DBD was balanced with top players in mind survivors would have been nerfed a long time ago
---
No. It's obvious when killers are lag switching and I'm gonna call them out for it when I see it. When the game lags ONLY while they're in a chase and they keep downing survivors while I'm getting rubber banded across the map, you can't just justify that as them having bad internet. That's why when dedicated servers get fixed and hopefully used in console, we can put an end to lagswitchers.
---
I usually play solo or with friends.. so no
---
This was actually pretty good!
---
Keep up!
---
Survivors are constantly being nerfed if you would pay attention. I have been playing this game since 2016. Killer is way too easy as of now, every good killer will agree on this.
---
I don't like to dc because I hate de-ranking and getting zero bp for my time. But I'll be honest, I've rage quit my fair share of times from getting frustrated with the killer or killer build. I end up more salty at myself for doing it than at the killer though... I'm working on it.
---
That being said,  Mint rag is incredibly un fun to play against. As is spirit with prayer beads, tombstone Meyers, iri heads huntress, (please note the plural, if she only has one, it's not that bad) Omega blink nurse, etc. They are so altering to the mechanics of the game and what is typical to whatever killer you THINK you're playing against. All of a sudden, everything is not as it seems. I try my best to just endure through the match and not dc, but more often then not I'm checked out when I see that garbage. Assuming I don't disconnect, I'll run straight to the killer and let them down me then kill myself on hook. If they slug, I go afk.
---
It just isn't fun... You talk about challenge being the fun part. And it is with this game. But when the odds are stacked so greatly against you, to the point where it feels like the killer is walking on easy Street and you and your solo queue team need to sweat and play perfectly... 
---
Nah man... Get me out and on to the next match... 
---
TLDR; I rage quit or get myself killed on purpose sometimes because some add on's make solo queue matches not worth sweating over.
---
Lmao I always try to be off putting or humorous about it to show them that they just sound like ridiculous edgelords about a video game and report them. That's honestly concerning though üòÇ
---
In a way... yeah üòÖ
---
lmao you're really complaining about clown add-ons and exhaustion counters? actual chimp.
---
*4 survivors load at the same time with 3 toolboxes and a key*
---
Me: *leaves* 
---
4 Survivors: *Ego +1*
---
I was thinking every time you complete a healing action on a teammate or whenever you get healed. Might need a different token amount for the effect though
---
Spine Chill definitely is better as it‚Äôs an active alert as opposed to Premonition‚Äôs one-time alert. Plus knowing when the killer is looking at you is better then knowing if you‚Äôre looking at them, especially against Ghostface and Spirit.
---
I keep wondering why they took away the ability to do grabs and keep it with the hatch close. Guess it was too OP or something lol
---
Its a fair bit more complicated than that, because the truth is often somewhere in the middle. I've had perfectly smooth games in the past, where suddenly the SWF squad against me just starts wrrrryyyyyying to high heavens. The odd actually laggy game I get here and there, rarely actually recieves any comment at all from the opposing team, is the kind of funny part.
---

Y'know we need to greet new player with open arms if we want this community and game to stay alive
---
Me too
---
It needs a Brazzers tag.
---
*Sad Adam noises*
---
Idea from a friend: Broken key open the hatch and you go in but then it immediately closes. (Doesn't start EGC.) Dull Key leaves it open for a friend, and Skeleton Key is the only way you can get 3+ people.
---
The game is already balanced on the Soulja Boy Console version of the game so you should go buy that version.
---
Just bring a med kit and take hits while a survivor is being carried to the hook.
---
Most of the time Mr Slug is just gonna DC to spite you.  At least, that's what I've found.
---
it's not though, it's an "I put in the work for a 4k and only got 3 because of RNG" The hatch just feels so shitty when a survivor gets it from me, maybe if we are racing for it feels better, but even then I sorta feel like "oh, so they get to escape not because of skill, but pure RNG and luck."
---
For killer I really like Whispers and for survivor my favorite perk is slippery meat because it's the first perk that I got and my first perk I got to 3 so it'll always have a place in my heart.
---
Killer-Bloodhound Very fun 
---
Survivor Iron Will
---
That's maybe 10 feet.
---
It's long enough for everyone playing to fall asleep in their chairs.
---
Person who plays both sides annoyed.
---
She clearly hurt her knees pretty bad, only for a small clip.
---
Survivors are constantly being nerfed and yet 75% of the killers can't be brought into high rank games because they still don't stand a chance.  
---
If you actually pay attention you'll see that majority of the nerfs are minor adjustments of seconds to shit they don't even need to do.
---
He helped you with the hit lmao
---
Ever seen JoJo's
---
Maybe it was his intention to push me out lol.
---
i sorta agree, though if there is an unlit totem in some really weird spot then its not really their fault for not doing bones.
---
It's so OP, there's no counterplay.  Except, you know, the inexorable march of time and the five hundred other things you could do besides downing and picking up the recently unhooked survivor.
---
Nah, keep it as a 1hko.  
---
Deep wounds would be a slap in the face.
---
Ghostface main and...yeah I enjoy making shitposts. I should make more.
---
Yeah, and if I am ever make your choice, I've usually gotten away then get found by the killer later on.  A lot of perks are stronger, and some killer ones are really strong.  (Not necessarily Make Your Choice, but that tells you something:  a killer perk that isn't even meta is basically the inverse of DS, which is considered OP).
---
Why didn‚Äôt  you leave your gt?
---
A mask made out of a rotting pig's head. Or at least that was the original intention. I guess they changed it to latex or something later.
---
Well played
---
I play on ps4 and I just ask "hey could you check if you're downloading something in the background?" and many get the hint and ask me if the game was laggy etc. much better approach than yelling/insulting them
---
I agree. Crossplay should be optional but porting accessories would be nice
---
That sums it up!
---
The Demogorgon probably uses perfume, though. He‚Äôs not a peasant!
---
My Turn is supposed to be like earning a pallet stun after a prolonged period of chase - and it only happens once. There won't be any form of stunning to set free a carried survivor as the killer needs to chase you for a long period of time - and he won't do so with a survivor on his back.
---
Cross-play could be optional, like on Brawlhalla on Fortnite
---
Walking dead is horror, but Negan can be in crime series just as well, he's just a guy with a bat.
---
Why body block? The trap was gonna go off no matter what. There is nothing special about this play, just a baby claud.
---
They could have just walked out right?
---
Ok
---
Yeah I feel your pain on that one. If you're looking for someone to play with let me know! I'm always looking for people.
---
Your body blocking did nothing here tho lol
---
Normal looking survivor perks if you ask me
---
I guess
---
My point. The trap was active. Just a baby claud and a bad console pig player.
---
I'm not entirely sure about the balance about it, but what I know is that the killer would know that the person equipping No Mither has the perk due to the broken status. This means that the killer would know to not leave the person alone when slugging. 
---
Maybe hiding the broken effect or putting an exposed effect would be better, but I definitely think that No Mither needs a rework to make it viable unless you would want to play the game on hard mode.
---
He is a senior citizen. Chris Punches Boulders, Jill have super powers.
---
with the way the totem spawns in this game not op'ed at all
---
I don't think they'll ever add it. I feel like they should add cross platform play to PS4 and XBox as they both use controllers, making the cross-play more fair.
---
Just a console swf. What's your point?
---
You can be matched against people who are up to 6 ranks above you iirc so not out of the ordinary
---
BBQ and WGLF, gotta get those points
---
Thank you
---
I don‚Äôt think you know how those traps work
---
The trap was active already she tried to run out and that tripped it
---
I can‚Äôt wait for DC lockouts! I play solo survivor and DCers ruin the game for everyone.
---
reminds me of that HybridPanda clip
---
That's exactly what it is. It's a last chance for the last survivor to escape regardless of how bad the team gets steamrolled. You still prevented 75% of the team from escaping
---
At least as a character model would be nice
---
I fail to see how Steve is considered a "mom".
---
Everything in the patch.
---
How....
---
How is Steve a "mom"?
---
KawaiiBoyGirl
---
I would put dying light or slowdown.
---
Jeez, if you would have missed that skill check that would have been sich a epic fail
---
No, because one hit from an Iri hatchet is still an immediate down. No pallets, no loops, and no Dead Hard.
---
You're completely wrong. Go watch the films again.
---
The entity supplies her with them
---
Thank you.
---
Underrated post
---
Shit your right! It's been Nurse's and spirits all night, last night.
---
Hey, Thanks!
---
First of all, it doesn't matter how much you complain to him about tunneling, it's not something the game developers are gonna punish him for so there wasn't a point to message him for it. In fact if you look back on the official Dead by Daylight YT channel and go to one of their first ever videos titled "Dev Diary #3", literally the first thing Mathieu Cote says is this: "When you play killer, your job is pretty straightforward: Patrol your environment..it's your house...and find those pesky survivors, whack them, grab them, put them on a hook." Later on, he also says, "The killer sees the world in first person, what that means is you're much more focused. We really gave the killer a **tunnel vision to not only change the gameplay which is super important but because the killer is supposed to be super focued on his objective**..." He's literally saying it's the killer's job to catch the survivors by tunneling them down no matter how long it takes, so tell me, why should he have then not tunneled you when there's nothing wrong with the way he's playing?
---
Secondly, we got enough problems already with people making these stupid ass tunneling complaints, at this point honestly, just think about what kind of example this is setting for the community, messaging someone just to bad mouth them isn't good and it's even worse by putting it up on reddit and someone who's new to the game and wants to learn it sees this post.
---
And finally, this post literally breaks rule number 8 of this subreddit which if you click on it includes salty messages classified as oversaturated content. To add on to that as well, looking at these comments from other people's thoughts on this post, the defense of the post in response to them breaks rule number 1 of this subreddit, which again, if you click on it mentions that insulting other users is not tolerated.
---
In conclusion: \*facepalm\*
---
Why did you clip out the results?
---
yeah exactly
---
I guess idk
---
Should've let her hook him and use borrowed time instead of injuring everyone
---
lol
---
Gotta love the person who camps and wastes pallets. Your head on stunned him for 5 seconds. Make some distance.
---
Unpopular opinion, but this is why you should use Devour Hope instead
---
Ruin is detected early, and people either break off right away to search for it or outright ignore it
---
Provided it‚Äôs not found in the first five seconds, Devour Hope doesn‚Äôt come into play until mid game. When it pops up, it‚Äôs kind of like a discount version of the Pig‚Äôs Reverse Bear Trap - it‚Äôs big and scary, it can very easily lead to a lot of dead survivors (not just the mori, but sacrificed survivors as well), and, most importantly, it forces them to take a significant amount of time to find/destroy it or risk being vulnerable all game. Even if it‚Äôs found right away, it‚Äôs giving survivors a reason to not work on gens, and that gives you a window of time to keep building in momentum
---
Ruin is like a sucker punch that the other guy can shake off. Devour Hope is like a hard punch in the gut that can interrupt the other guy and give you room to catch your breath
---
Mmm fondant ü§§
---
Isnt the whole idea of perks to counter specific things? Like ds counters tunneling, unbreakable counters slugging, spine chill counters stealth killers etc.
---
Its suppose to go off highest rank so killer should be 7 or atleast purple
---
When the nurse is chasing you and not using her tps to catch up.
---
I was told the average
---
Rule #1 of this subreddit: Am I a joke to you?
---
Who knows anymore. Either way its still hella off
---
I've been letting the last 1-2 survivors farm when I play Leatherface to try to show people not all Leatherfaces are toxic face campers.
---
It would be cool to see gamemodes like this in dbd, even if it may look like shit hits the fan it would just be something fresh.
---
Yeah
---
Hey, may I introduce you to lockers and head on.
---
cote mentioned being interested in crossplay or at least be able to play on all platforms with the same gear on a podcast.
---
People like you give Bubba a shit rep.
---
this comic is based on personal experience i sat there laughing non stop when it happened to me.
---
The mask is only sold in select stores in the UK and it‚Äôs super limited since it‚Äôs been discontinued for a while. And the poncho is a Black Magellan Outdoor Rain Poncho, you can get it at a hunting store for about $5, or you can get the one from the Scream TV Show.
---
what happened?
---
Ehh, that would just make it like an either/or for DS. I don‚Äôt particularly want that for perks. Also stacking both, like DS on second hook and MoM on third would be way too strong.
---
Amen brother
---
The same might be able to be said with insta heals (or maybe old BNP) but those are getting nerfed, which is the point this meme is making
---
Change Iridescent hatchets to injure and apply the deep wound effect. Duh.
---
More pictures of my costume (and other cosplays) are over at my Twitter: (@the_onlySHAPE): https://twitter.com/the_onlySHAPE
---
I also have a Ghostface teabag video up as well, if you're interested
---
Mate I‚Äôve literally watched all 4 films more times than I can count. There are differences but the average viewer will just call the classic Halloween outfit the movie outfit. I promise you dumbfucks, it‚Äôs not rocket science. Both outfits follow the same general design just done a little differently
---
Keys can unlock it regardless if its closed

---
Or Furtive Chase would just become a meta huntress perk
---
Maby it is
---
Actually this is sadly 'working as intended'. You're not supposed to see anything more than a 6 rank difference, which this does fall in line with.
---

---
Just make a suggestion post lol
---
I bought the most suitable rain poncho I could find online and just cut it and painted onto it with acrylics.
---
I also attached velcro strips to the head and shoulders of it so that it'd stay in place :)
---
I could be wrong, but I think they changed it to where you will be matched with others within 6 ranks.
---
Edit: Correction
---
Yeah dyling light got reworked to give u a penalty for every survivor that is not the obsession hooked
---
They wont, it's a valid killer strategy. Against some of the SwF's they face it's a necessity to slug. Just part of the game my man.
---
After Otz got a 4k all the survivors started yelling and accusing each other of being at fault for the loss and he kept throwing out stuff to stoke the flames
---
Yes!
---
There was a Meg (I'm assuming from the pigtails) and Bubba ad well
---
I would love that!
---
Just give in and play Nurse, Spirit, and Billy all the time. Devs aren't going to do anything to make the older Killers on par with them. So if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
---
No add ons, keep playing keep losing, keep getting better, get better, start destroying, nurse opüòÜ
---
"Hey, Louis. What's 'Bill's an idiot' in Japanese?"
---
Stop of cry and do bones
---
There's a Louis quote in L4D where he says "Bill san baku desu"
---
When there's no Object of Obsession before the mid chapter drops yeah he does alright with a proper build. Still suffers from 4 minute matches like every other Killer does with how fast gens go though.
---
I think this is a terrible idea. In my opinion, perks like WGLF that do absolutely nothing except give BP are bad for the game. They should have a secondary function like BBQ or Prove Thyself. I hate feeling forced to run WGLF, and by extension basically have only 3 perk slots, or simply double the grind of this game.
---
You're a bit late, this discussion ended a long while ago with me understanding that.
---
Tiny 5 seconds? This guy's doesn't play killer at all.
---
If I could have a "no tier lists" filter, I would be sooo happy.
---
Just becasue their new players they are not entitled for anything.
---
There is no differnce for me between a new and an experienced player.
---
i dont want to see Clips of them doing casual stuff.
---
Its unintersting.
---
And a normaly functioning human beeing should be able to think so far even if you are a new player.
---
I didnt post videos of me pallet stunning killers because i knew it is something normal.

(Sry for spelling and grammar mistakes.

Killer: "I'LL GIVE YOU A DULL MACHETE!" \*performs mori on him\*
---
Killer is Save the Best for Last. Survivor is Unbreakable. When the killer slugs for pressure and you just stand back up is incredibly satisfying, and the killer basically tons of time.
---
The smell to grey ranks are very strong in this post
---
I made a comment on a post like this a few days ago so I'll say it again.
---
Yes. Getting Slugged is annoying, however the Killer needs to keep pressure on Survivors or else gens will start getting done too quickly. Hooking and Slugging are Killer's main form of pressure, the more a Killer can break Survivors off of gens the slower a game goes tipping a match into the Killer's favor. It's simply the SMART thing to do in a lot of situations. Why would a Killer waste time picking up a Survivor when another Survivor is doing a gen close by? If I slug a Survivor, they can't work on a gen, the Survivor I'm chasing isn't on a gen, and a Survivor has to come over to pick up the Slug, so they aren't on a gen either, now only a single gen is being worked on.
---
It's just the Killer playing smart, and there is no reason they should be punished for it.
---
I fucking love that he corrected his grammar üòÇ
---
I agree that slugging is a pretty stupid way to get a win, Especially for killers that can instantly down survivors. My suggestion would be that All survivors can fully recover once per game as a base which essentially removes slugging on its own, This does create a power struggle with perks that grant 1 recover so as a buff to them- Unbreakable now grants the ability to recover once per time the player is unhooked, while No mither allows the player to always recover from the dying state.
---
There are very strange people who play DBD on XBOX. I play with them, but I will never talk to them.
---
This is gold
---
Time to kill self.
---
oh yeah that *definitely* fits better
---
James A. Janisse.
---
Unbreakable works asides from just preventing slugging right off the hook. It's a pretty good circumstantial perk that works really in other situations too. I don't see it as a waste of a perk slot. 
---
You're also simplifying slugging. Killers don't just slug everyone right away and win the game. If that happens then your team obviously didn't play strategically or were way too altruistic. 
---
Also if you're getting slugged right off the hook then the blame falls on your teammate for unhooking too close to the killer without borrowed time.
---
What boogyman game are you talking about?
---
6 rank difference??? That's a MASSIVE gap. I'd say 12 pip difference than the highest ranked and pipped player, that sounds more reasonable
---
Didn‚Äôt I see you protesting Trump at U C Berkeley?
---
I feel pretty good about this match. I was juggling survivors appropriately and never got too flustered if I didn't know exactly where they were. Too bad one of them decided to kill himself on second hook, but it's whatever.
---
SORRY MOM ILL SLEEP
---
Its a time buyer more than a gen regression perk. Survivors get on a gen, see ruin, 2 of them will run around and look for it, thus you bumping into them
---
Well, while still unbalenced, you atleast have to do something, ira head you lose 4 hatchets and have to hit a shot, trapper, you have to have them in the trap and not have a teamate help,  key you have to do gens to use, bnp you have to hit skillchecks, however instaheals you just had to use the medkit and press your secondary action button.
---
Ez dodge. I'm queueing to play a game, not half of one, thanks.

Spirits have no chill

No, that would be possibly the worst ultra rare

Well, i mean, you have to aim with iri head, it is OP, but the medkit took no skill at all
---
It's the dedicated servers. Make sure to stand on the centre of the hatch to body block it until it's completely shut.
---
I found the artist! https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?id=1774701
---
It's a bug. Hatch needs to be reworked in general. I like getting 4k's to display my dominance, but I feel bad slugging all the time.
---
that is true then I feel then if that is the case and the timer stays then the timer should be increased maybe not be unlimited but longer until someone gets hooked to stop killers from just easily waiting 60 seconds like they already do. honestly, I find DS fine as is and at most as killer you want to get it out of your way as fast as possible or it is going to screw you over later
---
The Nea was on death hook.
---
While eating noodles
---
This is stupid annoying, but realistically they knew they couldn't compete against Call of Duty and Outer Worlds. They'll wait a week or two for the hype train to die down so when they do release they have a higher player count to maybe purchase more items and stuff. Sucks they waited to the last minute or didn't release it earlier in October.  
---
You're a horror game guys, this is your month!
---
At 8 hits its 160% so youd get a speed boost after hitting
---
Its basically a "hey I got a free escape against a killer who was forced to let me go"
---
So you like edgy teenager and wazzzup and the bane of literally any rank 20? Same here!
---
Come on man, they are trying. It not easy to cosplay a doctor or a plague
---
Is that the actual Devil Face mask too? They don't sell those anymore, nice!
---
NOED is a crutch perk, but it's also pretty balanced imo. 
---
You have to play the entire match without a perk and once it activates the survivors can still just cleanse the totem and then you can't use it anymore.
---
Think of all the perks you could've used in that 4th slot, that's the advantage you're giving up for NOED.
---
Is it annoying? Yup
---
Is it a crutch? Yup
---
But is it unbalanced? Nope
---
God I hope he contacts them and makes something happen, that‚Äôd be so cool
---
Well kinda but kinda like prestige skin im pretty sure stuff like that carries over from trial to trail so that means that the pigs head would fall under those laws
---
BIIIIIL!
---
Im rank 7 though
---
There was a book that caused that?
---
You aren't even going to give credit to the streamer? BroBQ? https://www.twitch.tv/brobq/clip/EnergeticInterestingApeKappa
---
I always wanted Ghostface to be able to use lockers, since he was always the most human killer.
---
i guess im ghostface then
---
Ah, should've guessed
---
Ah yes, how should I forget
---
its random though, we can put in the work to get a 4k and get robbed, you aren't skilled for getting hatch. It is 100% luck
---
Ok, so what are the official rules that constitute cosplay then?
---
Reduce your resolution down. Twitch clip default at 1080
---
Yeah it was a fucking pain to find the mask. Was able to find a very limited stock in the UK and was able to get one. Mask is super fucking rad.
---
One day fellow feng... one day...
---
Was just disconnected 5-7 seconds into a match.  Lost my toolbox with addons, my offering, and depipped.  It's ridiculous.
---
Playing survivor on pc compared to console is practically the same IMO.
---
The only real shock would be having to go against killers that a aren't limited to a controller anymore.
---
 Still waiting for the day somebody cosplays as a hook.
---
Because you're using your perks as a crutch since you know you'll make it to the locker before being downed and get an escape, it's solid logic, but in this community using rationale and decision making processes you are deemed toxic
---
It's bad because the killer can easily patrol it just by walking back and forth a short distance and the only real way it's good in my experience is if someone on your team is good at distracting/running and gets the killers attention towards the other side of the map.
---
Okay and can i use your username
---
So....
---
Don't post it on Reddit. Just stop playing it. Everyone's seen this post countless times already.
---
You can use my username
---
Yea im gonna complain about an addon that insta downs you that takes no effort and addons that cancel out required survivor perks, thats like having a survivor addon that cancels out BBQ
---
Ah yeah, then we're in agreement. If iri's were limited to one and did t stack with belt add-ons I would agree they'd be better. But there is stil something shitty about long range 1 hit downs. Maybe they change it to deep wound with some healing speed debuffs or something
---
Thanks :)
---
He is probably the only viable stealth killer right now for sure. Even Michael who is the next best one, sucks when you fully utilize his stealth and is still much better off just running builds to quickly gain his EW3 which at that point isn't exactly the stealth part of his power. It's like being able to play as jumpscare Myers, except you're viable on more than 1 map.
---
On that note, it is rather annoying watching Tru3 say his stalk is shit when it's arguably stronger than Michael's if used right with how quickly you can simultaneously expose and sneak up on people. At least Tru3 actually sees the potential in Ghostface and doesn't write him off as a trash killer like most other personalities or like Tru3 did himself a couple months ago.
---
You can open the bloodweb then the store and that stops the endless connecting to match you dont have to restart ur game
---
Gotta use meta perks finna be an easy game
---
I used this specific type of paint, I don‚Äôt remember the name. I‚Äôd go to an art store and ask around, I‚Äôm not much of an art expert anymore lol
---
Nah man people who do nothing and expect to live deserve to get hooked.
---
No, they were an idiot and the killer should have found the Ravens a lot sooner. Honestly as the killer I would have let you go lol
---
I get where you are coming from but I'm working with what's in the game rather than what could be added. Honestly if you ask me they should really start designing a dbd2, providing overhaul changes to this game is just going to cause infinetely more problems rather than rebuilding from the ground up with you know...SWF in mind this time.
---
Because of that nonsense, keys are essentially a free risk escape for the survivor holding it. There's really nothing you can do lol.
---
It's coded based on how many objectives you get done, mostly on the Killer side. If you kill everyone first hook, it doesn't recognize that they're dead, it just recognizes that you only hooked people 4 times.
---
spin your own camera and tap, auto-aim will do the rest.
---
If you're talking about people saying they "3 gen'd themselves" it's when they're down to the final generator they need to finish to power the doors. When you're down to just one to finish there are technically three generators on the map. If they're too close to each other the Killer can patrol then very easily and its really difficult to finish it and get out. You really want to try to leave the generators spaced out (whereas alot of times when you 3 gen yourselves you've done all the generators on the outside of the map first and then worked on the ones in the middle last.)
---
If they‚Äôre afk they kinda deserve it, especially if they didn‚Äôt do anything. Although with those crows he probably would have found him anyway
---
You know that add on that increases your stalk more than any other but only on obsession? Use that on furtive chase then you tier up a bit quicker.
---
Even disabled critters need to learn once in a while.
---
The new meta
---
I would suggest Randy from Scream?
---
We hate you too, pal =) /s
---
Activated RBT‚Äôs automatically kill if you try to leave through the gate, the bodyblocking had nothing to do with it
---
Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
Now yes, his reveal phase is a little inconsistent in some cases, but those who say they never can break his power in general are just really bad at doing so. My streak of breaking Ghostface in each encounter hasn't been broken yet lol.
---
If you're playing as killer and want to "3 gen" survivors it means you actively choose to not patrol some generators that are very far away and take time to walk to. What ends up happening is the remaining survivors are stuck with 3 gens all close together and it's extremely hard to recover from that. It can be a good strategy as killer and it's a common strategy for doctors (also known as "3 gen doc"). Hag and Trapper also benefit from just choosing to defend one side of the map so that they can manage their traps better.  
---
Survivors often accidentally 3 gen themselves. If you play survivor and you're new then deja vu is a perk that can help you keep track of where the gens are. It's not a particularly good perk but if you're brand new and don't have any teachables yet you can take it. Just be careful when playing to not do all the generators on one side of the map, try and spread them out and focus on the middle first.
---
I wasnt around, what did he say??
---
camping is toxic but at the same time using ds that much is also toxic.
---
This actually made me laugh, so thank you.
---
Nothing worth reporting tbh
---
No, its okay, not the most toxic thing from what i've seen. Just do whatever you want and dont think much about it, its but a game. If you think he was pretty useless and didnt deserve an escape, sell 'im. He'll be pissed off, but so what. Was he killed in the end?
---
Yes
---
Totems are a secondary objective and so many angry survivors complain about them already. Then as a reward for them not doing that secondary objective the killer has hex perks that activate or stay active. Either way adding another objective will still just make most of the people who already complain complain more. based on this Reddit... That's a very large amount of whinners
---
yeah, i at least, don‚Äôt consider gen-rushing toxic, moreso just an underlying problem with the games match structure. it‚Äôs not really the survivors fault, it just really can feel awful as the killer to have 3 gens pop in like 3-4 minutes when you‚Äôve been chasing other people. 
---
and at the same time, if you‚Äôre a 3-4 man SWF all bringing green/purple toolboxes with quick gen add-ons or BNPs, you are just trying to rush the gens and leave as quick as possible which kinda just leaves everyone bored but the killer moreso. 
---
so i think it exists, it‚Äôs just not a toxic thing that‚Äôs on the survivors. just like a term you use when you feel like you had no chance to hook multiple people because the gens were done super fast.
---
All 4 survivor would have to give up a perk slot for it. I think that‚Äôs fair
---
I mean the game is getting there, it isn't just "run insta saw billy or Nurse if you don't want to lose" anymore. Like would you believe me a year ago if I said Freddy and a stealth killer are actually viable in high ranks.
---
I would argue we have about 5-7 viable killers at high ranks now depending on your definition of viable. With a good chunk of the mid to low tier killers also having a chance with specific niche and expensive builds at the very least.
---
If anything I would argue that the survivor side suffers a lot more from limited options in builds, since every perk they get is either trash or can't compete with the current survivor meta perks
---
See.. Now that's what I get for stopping at chapter IV. :p Thanks &lt;3
---
Tuna and mayo is like the least disgusting combination you could‚Äôve made
---
Blocking another survivor so they get hit by the killer
---
I'd try someone easier to learn the game. Hill Billy is probably the easiest killer to pick up and use. Use his chainsaw to get around the map and patrol gens. Don't worry about using it to down survivors at first, but just to get around the map fast. 
---
Of course if it's an inside map like the game or lerys ot Hawkins then his power becomes near useless so keep that in mind
---
Sandbagging is when you block a fellow survivor from moving in a direction, intentional or not.
---
Usually it happens after an unhook, and the killer is getting near, so both people sprint in the same direction and bump into each other.
---
While on hook, ‚Äú Attention, I have been murdered‚Äù
---
Haha what a mad lad
---
It‚Äôs no longer in the killers favour in dedicated servers. So survivors can still get through if they press it first.
---
Ok but you tried to claim earlier that the cosmetic we are getting are the robes from the films, which we aren't. Call names all you want, lol.
---
Wow, that sounds really good then. I love the mind game aspect on her so I‚Äôll definitely use that more.
---
I‚Äôd love to see this in game, I think it‚Äôs super innovative and cool and would be scary to play against
---
Sandbagging is not body blocking.  
---
It's intentionally dragging down the rest of your team mates, being bad at the game, in other words. Being about as useful as a sandbag.
---
I think he‚Äôs talking about the reworked ‚Äúinsta heal‚Äù add ons live on the PTB.
---
Really? That kinda sucks, I thought he was pretty chill.
---
Someone commented not too long ago about something like survivors only gaining generator progress when they stare at the generator, while still being able to look away from the generator to look for the killer and such. They'd be unable to see anything but the generator while staring at it.
---
Chelsea too plz
---
But it would be simple don‚Äôt tunnel ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è make it so that the timer is shorter too I just am so sick of getting tunneled even with borrowed time, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm toxic either but I do main ash.
---
Ruin is a gen slowing effect, Tossing on other things like obliviousness doesn't suit its purpose and would just make it more of a meta perk, Increasing the skill check frequency while working with other survivors works well as it's meant to hinder survivors, Not completely stop them lol
---
Oh fuck me, thanks. I'm a fucking idiot. I never even read that first part that says after a Survivor is hooked. I thought it happened anytime you kicked a generator and the number of seconds was the cool down. Well this makes much more sense now.
---
Right below this is the Devil Face cosplay. üòÖ
---
I think he‚Äôs referring to the post nerf insta‚Äôs

Green keys should instantly open chests
---
I mean the devs suck.
---
I agree. They need to add cross play between consoles in order for us to get into matches easily.
---
Thanks, I'm dumb and never even read the first part that says you have to hook a Survivor first. I thought the seconds was how long the cooldown was or something.
---
Two words. Iron Will.
---
Dad I got bullied for doing this
---
I like the idea(even if I think it should only be skill checks that don't get revealed at all whilst doing it maybe) but if GhostFace has taught us anything it's that cameras are very fucky in this game LOL
---
Ahh tunnel bling!
---
Better yet - people are flagged for toxic comments (either automatically, because that worked *so well* for R6, or by number of reports). Then there‚Äôs a setting in options that allows people to opt-in to seeing comments from toxic people, which is default to off so you have to know where to look to turn it on if you‚Äôre okay with toxicity
---
Blanket muted and bans are too absolute, even temporary ones. It should be player choice, since a lot of people (on both sides) get a moderate amount of amusement out of the game‚Äôs toxicity
---
What do you mean? So you're trying to bait with a key and then get tunneled? Just don't bait with one and you'll be fine.
---
Also hide n seek sounds dope except it ultimately tells you when someone got into a locker which might be sucky if your trying to counter bbq, use quick quiet/head on or are just hiding temporarily cuz the killer came your way whilst you are the last survivor looking for hatch. If it didnt notify killer of how many tokens he had tho then i would call it fair.
---
That works so good!
---
"I'm gonna be like a ninja losing his virginity: quick and discreet."
---
ok this isnt a tier list of "how the mains of said killer feel about the subreddit" its how the killers themselves would probably use the subreddit
---
I honestly wish there were some replay system where you could watch a game from all perspectives. Can't tell how many times I've lost a survivor and wondered how the hell they got away
---
Use an exhaustion perk instead of technician. You said you want to focus on yourself but you arent using any perks to help you win chases.
---
Replacing technician with lithe is your best bet
---
I know that. I'm asking for personal builds. üëå
---
I dont take it personally. get ruin and get better.
---
He‚Äôs speaking if the new insta heals not the recent ones
---
Well the answer isn't no.
---
fair enough
---
i think they should just give her an outfit that makes her look super buff, that would lead to us survivors being so scared of her we wouldnt even notice her abilitys staying the same
---
Usually i never have to escape because I focus on gens. I'm rank 6 atm.
---
I play mostly all of them, except the nurse. I'm rank 3 if that matters.
---
Blur the others but not them?
---
Sorry, but you don‚Äôt have enough perks available to really make any interesting builds. They have no synergy for the most part, especially enough for multiple builds.
---
Edit: actually I do see one. You could run small game, alert, spine chill and possibly lightweight or lithe, for an aura knowledge build with some evasion benefits. The information could be helpful for a SWF because you could give your teammates the killer‚Äôs location at important times. Replace small game with Kindred for solo queue to help your team a lot as well.
---
And at that moment jake knew he fucked up
---
RuIn Is Op
---
I agree with that , where i sing up?
---
Humiliate the quitters is my mottoüòç
---
Perk 1 Slippery Meat. There you go. It's all you need.
---
If they wanted 2 remove slugging they never would have added perks like knockout or infectious fright, It sucks and anyone who does it is annoying. But what can ya do other then work around it
---
True on the toxic bs, BhVR is responsible for letting that shit get out of hand, it‚Äôs like the Wild West while playing this game! BhVR needs to crack down on all of levels of toxic bs and this game will be allot better but they have to fix it first and I don‚Äôt think they can do both at the same time..
---
Rip x3
---
OH SHIT i didn't know slippery meat granted 3 extra attempts to jump off hook üòå one hell of a suggestion!!!
---
A kind random stranger gifted me $50 to help me pay for my much needed heart medications. Not related to dbd but made me smile regardless.
---
i love how bill throws him under the bus straight away no hesitation
---
That's not what I'm arguing, you just pulled random other shit into this
---
There‚Äôs always a bigger fish
---
Hello? Custom games
---
i need this in my life
---
*quiet sobbing*
---
Every end game chat he says ‚Äúthanks everyone gg be good people.‚Äù 
---
Be like James A Janisse.
---
Oh yeah that happens too. I think the dumbest part is that it only activates while injured
---
can i have one?
---
Fair trade, your teamate spawned right next to killer lol
---
You didn‚Äôt specify custom games. You listed your perks as well, making it seem like you were only playing with what was available.
---
I got down voted for a FACT given by the devs.........priceless community
---
Lmao they're not even green ranks. Making a rank 16 dc isn't really something to brag about lol
---
So wretched shop and ironworks main buildings are fair to you?
---
No, unless it was a Dweet
---
Lol that ghost face bein a bit toxic
---
Dedicated servers have been up and testing multiple times over the past month. That means when a killer leaves the lobby it's not closed. It's not some amazing new thing.
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
---
I meant to write custom games not swf üò°
---
Lol I‚Äôve had that happen before, I tell them to go watch some vids on YouTube about scratch mirror Myers and get back to me.
---
Hey, thinking about buying this game while it's on sale. Is it a horror game or is it competitive tag? I'm getting the impression that it's the latter from this subreddit.
---
Of course steve. Scoops is the real MVP. Hugs all 'round!
---
They should be able to survive chases but those buildings are bs and if a survivor uses their speed burst from the first hit to run to wretched shop or ironworks every time they're hit that's bs. I'm not saying they should be taken out, I'm saying dont complain about strong killers if you use strong stuff.
---
I'm loading into already existing lobbies every time I play killer...
---
Thought this is the standard since dedicated servers are out ^^
---
michael is daddy i would hug him
---
Would be cool if they gave us something even something small little extra as a my bad guys for the delay but that will never happen
---
Don‚Äôt forget section B. Where it states OoO is useless too.
---
It does seem like the lobby isn't created until a killer is matched with 1 or 2 survivors. I rarely join a lobby that isn't already full.
---
Was it the most recent stream?
---
I would vouch for seeing a killer able to kick the fuck out of a totem
---
Imagine complaining about not being able to use ds
---
Also have had this bug on PS4 not sure why, just restart the app
---
I found it. It's the most recent stream after a trapper game. [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/500358135?t=03h08m15s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/500358135?t=03h08m15s)
---
I like Otz but it's honestly not that funny of a moment, barely anything is said tbh lol
---
I need a anwer
---
Yes it tells you when someone got into a locker, but it doesn't tell you where.  Do you really want to risk opening a locker and losing all of the tokens and thus your movement speed bonus?
---
I just went to the menu and went back in and it was fixed

I was the pixel
---
It‚Äôs really not that strong. And you can totally mind game those loops. There‚Äôs no guarantee that the survivor will make it there or they‚Äôll get that map or that loop will spawn or the pallet hasn‚Äôt been broken. 
---
Listen, I main spirit and I will be the last person to say she needs a nerf but if I am running prayer beads and a mori tbh I think it‚Äôs fair to complain because I‚Äôm for sure going to be very powerful and they don‚Äôt have a way to counter it. 
---
What survivors can do is intentionally diluted because there‚Äôs 4 of them and 1 of us. If a survivor is doing something I don‚Äôt have time for I‚Äôll just leave them and either catch them off guard later or get someone else.
---
Thank you. :D
---
Wouldn‚Äôt know since I‚Äôm on PS4 and I even helped out with the recent Survey, answered 2 questions and they then said TY for participating in the survey. 
---
Hope it Helped...
---
yos thank u. i also have da scoopz
---
Thank you! I based it on the illustrations of Alphonse Muccha, and his drawings often have hands in a similar pose lol At least to the lowered hand
---
That's exactly what I was going for! He's one of my favorite artists.
---
Then why did you list your perks??? You didn‚Äôt need to if it was kill your friends.
---
Lolol
---
This happened to me as well earlier
---
I've never gotten instaheal to work.
---
Very true

You should draw plague in this style, I think she would work really well also!
---
I want a perk that allows me to push a survivor into the killer.
---
I try to be a chill ghostface till you spam me with the flashlight üòè
---
When I first started playing a few weeks ago, every time the gates were being opened I had an anxiety attack. Will I live or will I die today?
---
People would make custom maps. It was usually a joke with like 200 pallets or the killer blocked in somewhere they can't get out of. They were really lazy and stupid, but so are tier list.
---
If the killer refuses to chase her how was she ever on last hook?
---
I am using quite the meta build: Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Unbreakable/Balanced Landing. U sure need to level Feng a bit more to get those perks
---
I &lt;3 THE GOOD PLACE!!
---
Ah, thanks!  I doubt I'll ever hear it myself but good to know.  My girlfriend likes running Inner Strength and I told her they make a noise but couldn't describe it :)
---
Playing with a mate of mine who is just starting out, got to watch a demogorgon slug him at the gate for his non existent ds, which let him pull of a hilarious flip flop play. Only reason he had flip flop is because he is an evil dead fan
---
Yes, now if you start thinking that pipping is winning, you won't lose when you die.
---
BLING SQUAD üòÅ
---
she's ok. like on the upper end of mid tier or the lower end of high tier
---
she can be pretty damn good and fun to play as
---
No.She is F tier.
---
-Tydetime
---
I feel like her Lunge could use some kind of re-work. Any pig knows it's best to just uncrouch behind people/corners than it is to use the Lunge. It can help at some small loops/areas, but otherwise it's really not useful. The loud noise beforehand, the fact that you're only slightly faster than a running Survivor, its bad.
---
Basically no matter what, people are gonna hate. Really the best thing to do is don't DC. If you want to play Legion, play Legion. It seems to be a common occurence for many people to find a killer they want to play and see the community hate on them. The problem is that most people expect to win every game and blame either bad teammates or the killer for just playing the game. There's a reason why I normally ignore most messages people sent to me. Overall, just play the game and enjoy it no matter if you win or lose and you're always gonna have some bad matches but that's just the state of most multiplayer games nowadays
---
Your opinion showed lack of experience / understanding, so I have no choice but to talk to you like you deserve.
---
Your second paragraph is so fucking cuck, I almost feel sorry for you. You just have to gut gud, then you can run 0 perks, and that *should* mean you can run whatever you want, lol.
---
Otherwise, l2p. Sorry. Keep running meta perks, and leaning on those strengths, because you will learn nothing. They can carry you to a 4k, rank 1, and GG's, but that won't help you, outside being sweaty and reliant on perks that make up for your lack of skill.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing Spirit katana the fuck out of a totem.
---
Most Halloween stores have good Ghostface costumes. It's a pretty basic design.
---
Sounds like 2016 all over again.
---
Ok good to know your position
---
Generally, I think the community would put her in mid-tier, because of her slow speed and time to set traps. 
---
Personally, she‚Äôs my fav, but I play around rank 10. Survivors constantly pop traps, so you know where they are. This can end chases quickly, because I often teleport, hit someone, they run into another trap, teleport, and hit them again. Or mind game them at a loop. Are you gonna teleport or not? The key is to just constantly have traps out. I‚Äôve seen streamers complain about her, but they only have 3/10 traps laid out. Can‚Äôt do that. You also virtually always need dragonfly wings or cicada to increase the distance you can teleport.
---
She's a very strong killer--the devs published a bunch of killer stats a few months back and Hag averages the most kills per match of any killer. She isn't overly popular and has a power that is extremely tough to play around efficiently and can protect gens/totems/hooks very well
---
###W E 
---
##A R E 
---
#F U C K E D
---
The ghostface mori is the most useful because you can just kill a survivor and then you will already have another one to chase right away!
---
She‚Äôs top 5 for sure. She has built in map pressure with her traps and can end chases pretty quickly.
---
If it happened once I'm sure people would be disappointed but not care and say they can't wait for it to be out but know the wait will be worth it. I've seen this happen before with a different game made by a different small Canadian company and that company was very interactive with its fans/player base.
---
I think Warframe had some content delayed a few months ago. People were a little disappointed but the company was up front about it, hosted a weekly friendly stream and kept people up to date on things.  
---
Meanwhile, here they screw up repeatedly and have d-bag self entitled personalities.... makes it hard to have any sympathy for them and people have a right to be annoyed at them.  Missing their biggest event just adds insult to injury. It's like celebrating New Years' Day on January 15th.
---
Halloween in November gang rise up
---
Disagree. I‚Äôve found Ghostface to be much better to play without using his ability.
---
Make it where even if they mend, if they were to bleed out, they bleed out. DW is probably the second worst debuff from it not being as lethal as it should.
---
I run Lithe, Spine Chill, Alert, and Iron Will because at green and purple ranks (Where I‚Äôm at) Spirit is common, and spine chill iron will is the best counter. Lithe helps during any chase, and Alert helps locate killers other than T1 Myers.
---
Instant scoliosis
---
Don't you watch Crypt TV? James is a Killer.
---
Rank 3 takes 6 minutes to find maatches its rediculous
---
Its fine, Halloween or not an event is nice. Tbh the only bad thing about the delay is for those who made time in their busy schedules for it. Planning your abscenses only for a whoopsie is knida disheartening
---
She can't be looped and has good map pressure so I'd say she's a solid killer
---
Wait these are great...
---
So he's going to replace Vigo and be a proper narrator?
---
Swf would counter that killers whole kit
---
Yeah, I mean some addons are ludicrous. Myers and Spirit are clear examples. Spirit has some of the most broken addons ingame ontop of being the strongest killer (post nurse balance patch) and Myers gets silly stuff like Perma-T3.
---
Didn't they say that stealth killers would become undetectable, so perks wouldn't activate for stealth killers including Shape?
---
No perk 4K against higher rank survivors, boy they must feel stupid
---
What perk does this again?
---
Good luck taking a toolbox and a medkit.
---
A 3/4 perk game in exchange for an early hit, fair trade.
---
HELL YEAH!
---
this should be a meme "when you play games too much"

Someone said this is how they drop you off when you fly Spirit

---
That's pretty much why I'm upset

I had a one week break that started on the 23rd so you could tell I was upset
---
Congrats you're a cunt
---
The people on looking for group trying to roleplay always give me a good laugh
---
Reddit doesn't collapse the thread any further for me i have it answer it here:
---
you make it sound like this game is a chore
---
were here for fun and not for rank i would prefer this game would have a quickplay queue
---
Pedophiles don't need love.
---
If the only thing you can do while losing is to be toxic, I have news for you
---
I would never run that. That sounds terrible. Three hatchets that only do something if you lose someone sounds worthless. I'd rather just run seven regular hatchets.
---
Leatherface Doctor hybrid
---
Bruh that's epic, take an upvote
---
For good reason mate
---
Uh oh, the patch isn‚Äôt being released as a rushed, buggy mess! Whatever shall we do?
---
Solo survivor or SWF? Also, confident in chases or no?
---
You had the opportunity to use the scene from Dream Warriors that leads into ‚ÄúWelcome to prime time, bitch‚Äù for the second panel and you didn‚Äôt. Bruh.
---
Myers should've been last one
---
This is some serious god tier comedy you got there
---
I think the bigger, louder characters; Jeff, Ash, Bill come to mind, should have a teeny bit more wiggle power, or maybe they are carried a tad slower.  I think it would be something nice considering how much of an advantage survivors like Nancy and Claudette have. It's very boring seeing tryhard survivors only playing little ladies or Ace.
---
Shhhhh you're making to much sense and the devs will stop everything they're doing to fix the update just to find a reason to nerf her more.
---
Yeah I used to run alot of urban evasion with sprint burst,
---
Maybe make the reward a bit more powerful, like when you get up you get the effect and a speed boast (I know I spelt it wrong but I'm such a brainlet not even auto correct can help me)
---
No
---
Link pleaseeee hahaha
---
"eyy gurl can i get yo digits?"
---
Yeah, you know how shitty and unpopular this game is...
---
Crying in the club rn
---
As a fuckin Trapper too.
---
I won several awards for this comment.
---
Oh yeah, I know. I don't hate memes on this subreddit. There are some really high quality ones and I enjoy making and uploading some myself. I just hate how many of them are reposts or are pictures/videos that are completely unrelated to DbD, except for the title.
---
Yes, how toxic to teabag the poor hatch. How will it ever recover from the intense bm.
---
Poor nurse :(
---
Imagine being that triggered by someone pressing the crouch button in a video game
---
She can know, by guessing. If spirit doesn't take skill right now why shouls she be good. She also still has scratch marks and ehe can still stand still. That alone makes her ability good. Her addons do fuck you up more but I run her no addons no slowdowns and ez 4k. Spirit should just get fucked upon and become weak asf with her current ability to track. They could literally make her passive phasing her whole ability if they buffed her.
---
Did you record it cuz I wanna see that shit lol
---
I don't wanna
---
Well Git Gud But jokes aside I‚Äôm blanking on the perks name but it‚Äôs a Jake perk. Anyways that perk is 100% a good counter to her. You just need to be good enough to loop and get out of situations. 
---
Iron will? Mmm no it‚Äôs something it‚Äôs on the top of my tongue.
---
LINK FOOL, LINK
---
When you know shes phasing and you're running, do a 180 and run back the exact way you came, running over your original scratch marks. You can trick some spirits into running past you and losing you sometimes. Itll at least give you a little distance.
---
Honestly spirit does need a bit of a nerf in some aspect. I‚Äôm not sure what would be a fair balance. Tbh her power shouldn‚Äôt be changed by maybe some of the add ons? Like prayer beads obviously should go or become much rarer to get. 
---
You‚Äôre incredibly right with the combination of hex and the inability to loop her fairly well it‚Äôs very difficult to survive. However this is a result of strong killer gameplay. A slight nerf is needed but I‚Äôm not sure what that is exactly? Idk I hate going against spirit it‚Äôs not fun and especially if they run hex it‚Äôs like near impossible to escape unless you‚Äôre the last one with the lucky hatch find
---
Iron will goes a long way against her, and really must other killers if the player is bad.  Good killers use their ears a lot, spirit even more so.  
---
You'll also want to avoid grasses while youre mind gaming, as she can see those move. This is something I use a lot until I hit the survivor, then after that sound is enough as long as they don't have iron will.  
---
Just knowing how to play her and what they look for, and avoid falling into the traps.
---
The idea behind it is right. The technical side isn't. But who cares?
---
Well yeah of course you can‚Äôt go around a con with a real one..... unless you‚Äôre a true Ghostface lol. 
---
It was a picture you could use a real one. But don‚Äôt mind me I‚Äôm just a nerd for that stuff. I bought a metalworked Freddy Krueger glove for about 125 took about 7 months. Dope as fuck mate lol. 
---
Still I think the cosplay looks great mate.
---
So many of the damn cosmetics are just reskins. You have to pay money for the ones that look different. (And even then some of them still look like ultimate reskins)
---
Why he has elf ears?
---
We still hate leatherface, but thank you.
---
If you thinking of the one that makes you 100% silent when injured then yes iron will.
---
He said on Steam I believe, which would make it PC
---
Looks Great! üòÉ
---
Yeah okay it is iron will lol. Thanks mate!
---
I always bring spine chill and if there‚Äôs a stealth killer it‚Äôs a hard counter üëåüëå
---
He talks shit about survivors every other video then when the hypocrite is called out for it he writes a fake apology and proceeds to do it again, while banning anyone from his twitch who disagrees with him.
---
Yeah Nice guy, on bread with mayo.
---
It‚Äôs just amazing
---
xD
---
You have to use different strategies against her. If she stands still by a pallet she could be phasing true, but your best chance is to run away immediately to the next pallet. Most spirits like to use prayer beads.  
---
1. don't run in grass with a spirit because she can see grass moving while phasing
---
2. iron will perk. pretty good against spirits.  
---
most spirits will try to run into you while phasing as well or bump into you to confirm they have you in front of them. I've also juked spirits by just walking after I can confirm they truly are phasing to remove my tracks, but this doesn't really work often.   
---
Makes me wonder if throwing down a pallet and sliding across it fast, and then sliding over it slow is a new way to juke spirits? mind game her into thinking you went over, but slow vault back to throw her off. IDK MAN LOL. I'm not good against spirits, but this is what I know hope it helps.

Remember this will only trick some Spirit players. 
---
But spirit mains, you will have the hardest time doing that and if you‚Äôve done it once they aren‚Äôt stupid. 
---
Or just good fucking killers in general lol. 
---
So this trick can be pretty neat but if caught your first time doing this don‚Äôt try it again in the same game.
---
Idk man i think it was just calling me
---
Thank you Doctor.
---
it's funny because this same thing is said about gens when  killers say gen speed is too fast "just run ruin 4head". also the same thing that's said when survivors run keys "just use Franklin's 5head"
---
You ruined smile sunday...
---
Yeah, that was fun

Devs sure have fixed hex spawn placements  that's for sure! I"m surprised that they hadn't tackled that on day one. When there should be a  point in time where Hexes shouldn't spawn near generators or up Survivor's asses when they get into the game.
---
Yea it used to work, I‚Äôm in red ranks and they don‚Äôt fall for any of those tactics
---
The biggest problem with ghostdick is that he can pop in and out of cover and spam stalk making it impossible to reveal him, the falloff for stalk with him needs to be sharper.
---
You DO realise swf teams have adapted and have a dedicated OoO player now to call out all movements the killer makes. Its impossible to get a 1st hit for cheap if every survivor knows your exact position and starts running to the nearest loop on time.
---
Ghostface is in no way a strong killer because his passive component of his power is actually useless. Its impossible to mindgame survivors if the OoO calls out every play and movement you make. 
---
Strictly speaking he is nowhere near the big 4 in viability but is one of the stronger m1 killers.
---
Idk about that but he has made several references to the game in some of his videos (one of the leatherface vids) and even has the nurse‚Äôs bone saw
---
Okay I see two nea's, a feng and is that David? The hair is really throwing me off (so many male survivors seem to have the same hairstyle)
---
Either way wonderful comic! Love it when i get photobombed!
---
(Edited for spelling)
---
Dude I don‚Äôt give a fuck what the stats say, the Trapper is without question the fastest in the game when it comes to base movement speed.
---
It definitely needs a bit of a rework, but we do need something like it. My largest hurdle as a killer has been getting paired with these red rank players masquerading as greens.
---
I'm sorry, but the rank 18 dude with level 3 meta perks, running insta-heals and looping perfectly is bullshit to go against when you're inexperienced. I usually just open  the doors as soon as I can so the annoyance will end.
---
Here we go again, blaming eachother instead of a developer refusing to put out balance patches more than once a year.
---
Because lul u a tryhard bro, toxic.
---
Halo absolutely did not have dedicated servers in 2006.
---
F
---
The Myers add on where he can kill people without even injuring them or hooking them is the dumbest thing the devs have ever put into the game.
---
Oh hell no I hate mending lol
---
60 seconds is fine. It should just turn off after you‚Äôve hooked someone else so it becomes an anti tunnel perk.
---
as a hag main, can confirm that it‚Äôs accurate
---
tried out trapper for the first time tonight - the snap of catching people is a joy! in my last game i had the chance to trap both exit gates and then when it came down to the last person i came across the hatch, closed it and... they stepped in one of the traps by the gate! so satisfying.
---
This will never happen cuz then survivors will also start complaining about the bullshit totem spawns and they‚Äôll actually have to do something about it
---
I dont get it
---
I love how she just gave up
---
Wow best one so far if you ask me
---
I dont think he needs the emote. If there is a mori, we are gonna join if close enough.
---
Neither, just how ping works. Your actual model isn't in the same place you see on your screen, which means if you try to dodge something in the very last second, it will hit you.
---
Oooh my to
---
looks fantastic, love the colors you used.
---
A hex is something that causes harm, since your idea is aligned with the survivors, I think it should be called a blessing totem.
---
I'd like an original killer based on Bloody Mary. Would be awesome.
---
Na man, those traps are already tricky as all fuck to get off in time
---
This is why I opt to use Thrilling Tremors with Pop goes the Weasel over Ruin any day
---
Matches are now hosted on dedicated servers.
---
The killer is no longer the host but rather the server, and thus doesn't need to exist for the game you are joining to exist.
---
Technology.
---
Ez fix 
---
1. Rule set #2 base
---
2. Increase crouch speed (and maybe decrease the time it takes to lose tr and/or increase the time after crouch the effect persists for)
---
3. Faster lunge charge speed base 
---
Boom
---
I kinda agree with you
---
If you remove it completely it'll only mean MORE chance that rank 1s will be thrown against 20s
---
H A P P Y C A K E D A Y
---
Played with a friend tonight for his first few times trying DbD. He was so excited to go up against Freddy!
---
Then as he was being carried by him he just goes "Hrm, kinda expected him to be more animated and obnoxious."
---
Me too, pal.
---
Michael in tier 1 was the most unique because of being the only killer in the game to be immune to not only aura reading, but detection/directional perks like SP and Prem. I'd like for the immunity to stay with him. Now staying in tier 1 will basically be worthless unless you're not going against a SP user, which is not often. His stealth capability after Mid Chapter is going from 100 to 0
---
Thank you!!
---
What region are you?
---
Aww cute lil Ghost Face uwu
---
It totally could. The best part about human killers is how easily they blend in or slip by. He'd be the same. 
---
I'm sure his terror radius would be the whistles from his crew! It'd be incredible.
---
I like how it shifts right into view as the camera spin ends.
---
IMO, I think spine chill may see more play. If aura reading perks are going to stop working on stealth killers, the only alternative I know of is spine chill. If
---
It's precious that you think the update won't be buggy/unbalanced regardless. It's BHVR tradition.
---
I edited those whimpers in, they are Claudette‚Äôs lol
---
Wait now I hear it I thought for sure that last one before the video ended it was real lol. Good job
---
Hey, if Bill can fall from heights without throwing his back out and breaking his knees then a young woman can survive for a couple years with back pain that‚Äôs equivalent to being 80 years old!
---
I always wonder if you could directly order from Fun World on their site to receive a perfectly crafted mask with no dents or bended areas, but sadly no. That's a little disappointing that devil face is no longer made, because that mask is very dope.
---
Helps them go Blendette mid-chase.
---
I have made a mistake and I am ashamed of myself
---
Bill you are frickin HERO, we dont deserve your braveness
---
Is that an old Asian Bill?
---
What a time to be alive.
---
Julie doesn‚Äôt get much love cuz she‚Äôs just a little differeny Frank
---
And by the way the mask is positioned on the photo, if you said it‚Äôs a Frank cosplay, no one would have corrected you, cuz no one would‚Äôve noticed
---
I mean they just sound like a troll group, id just leave. Games like that are boring af.
---
Well if the first survivor you find is really good at looping, Pop and Dying are doing nothing for you
---
It is fair tbh, considering survivors have plenty of perks that make them outrun the killer, having the killer deal 1 hit knockdowns and gain movement, but only at the end of the game it's completely fair. 
---
(And btw your flair makes you seem like a clown considering you are complaining about noed).
---
This medkit triggers me. 
---
Not only the order wastes 4 charges (base has 16, then adds 8, then cuts in half, so it‚Äôs 12. If they were put In differently it would be 16 cuz in half, so it‚Äôs 8 then add 8, back to 16)
---
But also, the charges add-on is useless, as you still won‚Äôt get the full heal before using the instaheal (even if you land a great, the charges left won‚Äôt be enough to use the instaheal. The medkit will run out instantly)
---
&gt;Well if the first survivor you find is really good at looping, Pop and Dying are doing nothing for you
---
Even the best looper can only do so much against a killer that eats through pallets and maybe even block windows with Bamboozle. Even if the chase lasts longer than it should, at the very least many pallets should've been removed which means your following chases won't be as long.
---
I never said that I was talking about bugs and toxicity so dont put words in my mouth.
---
Ur right, but after the first chase, at least 3 gens will be completed. Its almost impossible to come back from it
---
Fatality
---
It's his fucking stride. If you watch someone like the Spirit move, those puny irrelevant legs shuffle in quick succession. Trapper on the other hand, leaps like a pissed off gazelle. He's got that "I'm late to work but I don't want to run" pace.
---
Ok going to give you an analogy. In USA, if you get married, your spouse gets up to 50% of your belongings when you file a divorce. How is that fair? Same concept. You can‚Äôt do anything about it. üòÖ
---
I prefer discordance since it always shows you the gen where most people worked (and where they will most likely come back to), but surveillance should be perfectly fine as long as you keep kicking these gens. In the end game surveillance might even be better
---
Another great perk would be nurses calling, ideally you would stalk two survivors without risking that they could complete a gen while you stalk
---
Glad to hear, hope you have fun!
---
I find killer More relaxing because you have control over whats happening on the match.
---
Yeah but so far they've done this:
---
Gotten rid of Omega blink nurse
---
Reworked Freddy and made him more viable for a wider range of players
---
Made Ghostface who is pretty solid
---
Constantly have made changes to survivors and survivor perks(mom/old DS/pallets) to make them more balanced
---
I'm sure that they're going to keep doing that, a year ago people said only Billy and nurse were viable and now you have at least 4 viable 4k killers in high ranks
---
And also being able to 4k consistently in high ranks isn't balanced. A balance match is a 2k because that means both sides were successful. The game should never be balanced in a way to where you always 4k with any killer in high ranks.
---
Because as killer you have a timer dictated by survivors
---
As survivor, you are the timer
---
Making it very short
---
Had to look this up to see a photobomb from killer perspective.  [Here you go fam.](https://www.twitch.tv/hybridpanda/clip/YawningKathishAardvarkCoolStoryBro?filter=clips&amp;range=all&amp;sort=time)
---
Thats some serious luck :o
---
Haha his face in the bottom
---
"plenty of perks that make them outrun the killer"
---
You mean the situational perks such as: Sprint burst, lithe, balanced landing? All situational perks that require you to walk, find a drop or jump through a window that only gives you 3 seconds of speed before going back down to a slower than 98% of the killers pace?
---
Adrenaline is only for 5 seconds, although it does give you a insta heal.
---
I think NOED has its place but I don't think it's balanced either.
---
My heart cant handle it. Precious smol bean
---
You spawning next to the killer is also a problem that should be changed, we shouldn't be fine with either.
---
Can you explain how OP is being toxic to the devs? I mean, reading both posts I can see how you could be labelled as a "Dev Dickrider" for sure, but I can't really see where OP is being "TOXIC TO THE DEVS". 
---
If OP is being toxic to anyone I'd say it was just to "Dev Dickriders" like yourself? 
---
Sorry for being presumptuous by the way if you're in fact not a "Dev Dickrider" but your post sure makes you sound like you do at least fantasise about being one often.
---
Anyway, apart from having a pop at the "Dev Dickriders", and let's be honest, the irritating cunts have been out in force of late making some incredibly ridiculous, dumb, childish, and offensive posts - similar to the kind of stupid shit you write by the way - they also just appear to be showing a little bit of pessimism in regards to the state of the game after the coming update, which surely, if you are honest, you would have to say is perfectly reasonable, based upon the fact that every single previous patch and update to date has always miraculously managed to leave the game in an equally shit or worse state.
---
OP is clearly down in the dumps with this game, and why not? There's been plenty of reason to be. And they're also clearly fed up with all the nonsense being splattered over this sub by you filthy, bullying, "Dev dickriding" vultures, which is also completely understandable. 
---
I make OP's post fair and legitimate. 
---
I guess that makes you the piece of shit.
---
That is a very fair solution, and I am not in any way attempting to argue that console is a better place to play than PC for Dead by Daylight. In fact, I can very easily be attacked on console via private message unless I disable that as I would on Steam.  
---
But I've already noticed that without the constant harassment and shitty behavior vomited in nearly every single end game chat, there are so much less toxic killers/survivors (In my personal experience thus far). It's almost as if the negativity is parasitic and contagious, and with no immediate exposure to it people assume the best.
---
In my defence I only teabag when they've teabagged me or if they've been super toxic
---
Absolute power move Just eat noodles
---
Brutal Strength buff looks nice
---
Well personally as we can tell I have a few problems with it. But I‚Äôm a one man opinion lol. 
---
This being said I hope I don‚Äôt discourage you from creating more killer concepts. 
---
As much as I see more bad ideas then good ones it‚Äôs always fun to read people‚Äôs ideas.
---
I'm surprised there wasn't an IMMEDIATE disconnect lol. Killers are so salty about Ruin.
---
&gt;"Why shouldn't I DC though if you're going to keep coming after me, not going to give me time to get away or heal?"

Not the person you were asking to quote you, but here you go. But I'm guessing you were the Kate I went up against as Wraith on Ormond?
---
Looks like the netflix series ghost face mask. not sure who else has seen it but i immediately thought that. Either way i love it! also screw the 1% of people who downvoted
---
Any opinions on Andy Barclay's perks?
---
Rank is supposed to reflect your skill level. It's necessary for players to be able to rank down, so that people who got to a high rank through boosting or sheer luck will eventually get bumped back down to their rightful position on the ladder. Even if you lose rank progress due to bad luck, if you're really skilled enough to be at that rank, you should be able to use that skill to rank up again fairly quickly.
---
(Disclaimer: I'm just describing how the ranking system is supposed to work in theory, to prove a point about the ability to depip being necessary. I understand it doesn't necessarily work so well in practice.)
---
Suck that you're getting downvoted to oblivion by retards, hex spawns like this ain't even that common but this community loves to whine
---
Someone should do a version with "So NoED?"

---

---

---
Perk 1. Seems a bit too strong even if there was a cooldown. But I think it should have a cooldown or like x amount of uses.
---
It is literally not physically possible for me to get DSed, because I immediately leave hooks and don't go for the same person if they get unhooked.
---
The game is built around each character having individual perks, allowing near infinite customization per group. It CAN'T be balanced to where every game goes to any one group's favor. Sometimes you get a quad kill, sometimes you get a quad escape, usually it's a mixed bag.

Someone had a thing and used the thing to their advantage. It happens.

There's still the risk of it getting found early without it being able to spawn like 10 feet from the survivor's spawn.
---
people rarely run those
---
Quick and Quiet? just slow-vault the window. Spirit can't see you anyway and this little bit of time isn't worth a perk slot
---
Dance With Me requires Quick and Quiet to work in this situation and the effect isn't worth two perk slots
---
So maybe have perk 2 on like a 3 second timer?
---
No. I tried it both methods a few times, and I like Tru3‚Äôs build much better.
---
Played a clown game. As soon as I downed a Tapp after a short chase, he dc'd. Followed by 2 other DC (at this point I realised they were swf). I found the remaining Laurie, gave her pallet stuns and let her do a Gen, then, to my surprise, she pointed to a hook instead of looking for hatch.
---
In post game chat the other guys apologized, stating that they played a facecamping clown earlier who ran the same skin and exhaustion add-ons so they were certain they were facing the same douchebag. :') first time someone actually apologized to me for dcing
---
Which rarely happens unless you're rank 15
---
Trust me man I play survivor mostly but it just annoys me how survivors have so much power over killers with these kind of perks and items.
---
that's what you're doing wrong
---
This is a good idea i will just do that
---
You're rank 6 and asking for builds.. weird
---
Yes that works so the survivors can‚Äôt just immediately drop something and get rewarded like a minipallet.
---
The lack of items, or?
---
hmm, no DC.  
---
Yeah just this past 30 mins i spawned in as killer, turned to immediately look at my hex which was about 4 llunges away and a david was already cleansing it and completed it, so literally i had 0 chance of stopping it.
---
I want to hug her
---
and early *chase*
---
I find it goes up and down rapidly. Being looped = a lil stress. Same survivor stands in a bear trap I've already placed on the loop = immediate stress relief and fucking hilarious. Survivor uses D-strike = stress. Slapping items out of everyone's hands with Franklin's = destress.
---
And so on, so forth.
---
I spoke for the trees, you did not listen. Now ill break your fucking knees.
---
because the killer has the ability to close the hatch even when the survivor is jumping in. it was also inconsistent
---
Anywho. C as not go wrong with the Houdini build. Dance with me, Q&amp;Q, Lithe, Urban Evasion
---
The problem is that for every game like this that makes its way on reddit, there‚Äôs also a game where the hex isn‚Äôt found until 20 minutes in. It‚Äôs just a bad system that can be unbalanced both ways
---
Your right and slightly wrong. Yes the stealth aspect is of course amazing to use, but marking survivors can apply so much pressure at the right time. It's just that you should mark survivors when the opportunity is given. I've seen Tru3 play GF, and he just recklessly moves around, not trying to be a stealth killer, so when he does try to stalk, he fails because he doesn't get by cover at all or he already gave himself away by moving in clear view. He's basically playing as if he was Myers, because that's entirely what Michael can do compared to Ghost Face.
---
A key.
---
Im already 100%
---
Ill try my best but its so fucking hard dude :(
---
Is there anything BHVR could do to make her better to play on Console?
---
If you could potentially give someone a BT effect AND have it heal them later as well that's really really strong
---
‚ÄúYour awful nea‚Äù
---
I really dont know why you did that either...
---
a typical basic bitch build
---
decent
---
Not really. She‚Äôs also good on console but it takes more to play her. 
---
I quit playing nurse due to having no patience and constant harassment wasn‚Äôt fun. Actually I just quit the game in general due to constant harassment lol.

If you can do it man good on ya!

Ardetha (not sure if he still plays) plays a good console nurse.

Small Game because I like to see the look on the killers face when they realize I set fire to every stitch of that safety blanket they were planning on wrapping around themselves during endgame.
---
I was playing at green ranks. I've been matched with Myers who didn't know hot to play and we genrushed him. Both gates open, one person escaped and Feng get downed in the exit. I was body blocking Myers and make him make some missed swings while Baby Dwight sabotaged nearest hook. Suddently Feng wiggled and we both escaped. Not every Jane is toxic.
---
cool, but why sideways?
---
It's been reported on the forum a lot, so although nothing has officially been confirmed they have almost certainly noticed and are planning on fixing the issue.
---
Personally i almost had a mental breakdown as a rank 1 killer seeing how inneficient was playing anything other then Billy 
---
It was the most toxic experience in my entire life
---
Yup a bad one that usually results in the other 3 getting out but have at it if you don't know how to play killer yet.
---
And that's why it's called God pallet
---
GhostFail
---
Ardetha plays on Console?
---
Well you dont see many killers arguing with the nurse nerfs now do you? While survivors are proposing BALANCED MoM REWORKS - killers want to buff legion, clown or even plague to be tad better
---
The game needs a healthier meta to be honest
---
Think about the vAlUe
---
You know when the killer is looking at you, so you know when to look at them without them seeing you!

Genuinely curious, anyone else kind of just prefer Corrupt Intervention over Ruin? Just a flat two minutes of having the game locked down and having an oppressive start. With ruin, I feel like it only survives 2+ minutes 1 in 10 games.

Admittedly you dominate that 10th game, but I value the consistency of Corrupt.

I really should get Corrupt on my Trapper to mask his setting up time.

Well pig players have been hit deliberately with a wave of nurse that hurt their already mediocre killer - most people i talked to in topics about pig buffs, agree that pig is underpowered but mamy other killers also are
---
I can imagine playing as the town
---
What about ghostfreak from Ben 10
---
they also complain about losing, should we make them win 100% of the times?
---
It‚Äôd be neat but I fee like it would take the game away from the sp00kiness a little, but I definitely like the idea regardless
---
Hey, I fixed my mask! And better leggings :&gt;
---
Yellow mori should be a part of every killer's base set. it's not like the last survivor minds it anyway
---
I'm aware. That's why I was suggesting buffs.
---
I love the skin - " my mom washed my pants legion "
---
Plz nerf nea

Yeah i would love to be put in impossible games again with legion or wraith - so much fun
---
It‚Äôs called the god pallet for a reason.
---
 Hello, Potion Seller, I am going into battle and I want your strongest potions.
---
I can see where you‚Äôre coming from, but the perks for the survivors makes sense. DS is there to help stop a tunneling killer, just like Borrowed Time. We‚Äôve all had that game where if we had DS, we would have lived. The killer is already faster than the survivors, things like sprint burst, lithe, and balanced landing just give the survivors a couple more seconds. Maybe just enough to get to the next pallet. Dead hard is just a simple lung, but can be countered by a couple killers. NOED will stop the dead hard people, iri huntress, Michaels Tier 3, ghostfaces marked stab, and even Devour Hope can stop it as well, provided you can get it stacked.
---
On the killer side of things, they NEED those perks to an extent. Have you had people hide the entire game? Crouched in dark spots you can‚Äôt see and walk right past? If being seen by killers is messing you up, may I suggest the perk Distortion that Jeff has? It‚Äôs 3 tokens that stop your aura from being reviled, and covers your scratch marks for a limited time. If you see a person get hook and lose a stack, you know it‚Äôs BBQ and can play accordingly to it. It can seem overpowered, and yes the Plauges add on to make survivors puking revealed can suck, but there is some what of a balance to it. It‚Äôs a give and take. If the survivors didn‚Äôt have a way to fight back, then well, every chase will end the same. If the killers can‚Äôt find or see anyone, they can‚Äôt do their job. Sorry about the long message, but I feel like it makes sense how it is.
---
When he uses them optimally which allows him to go 2 rounds around the building than yes.. You could make him go from the other side, so fast vaulting isn't that easy for him. I'm saying that it was even worse back then so we should appreciate what the devs gave us (like lots of blocked windows that weren't blocked/barricaded before, entity blocked windows, bloodlust, pick up- vaultspeed, and faster hook speed also no double pallets anymore etc.) and hopefully even more in the future (stuff like reworked killer and add ons). If you use spirit people complain huh? People will always complain no matter what, no one will be truly satisfied. Just play as you like. All I'm saying is we came a long way and it's just not that easy to balance this game since there are so many aspects to it.
---
Exhaustion and aura reading perks have been in the game since the very start and it fits the theme of the game perfectly
---
No wonder its an unpopular opinion - its just bad
---
You're underestimating how good just moving around stealthily with no penalty to movespeed is. 
---
Pig would be so much better if she didn't need to crouch and faded in the shadows instantly
---
I prefer Corrupt over Ruin also.

---
It's not about what opportunities these perks give. Survivors' perks I mentioned completely remove "scare" factor from the game. Survivors are just not afraid of killer at all because they can use their exhaustion perk to rush to the safe zone. They don't need to worry about killer being close or else. See danger -&gt; literally teleport away and enjoy running in circles. Same for DS which gives literal invincibility against killer in some cases and rewards extremely aggressive gameplay.
---
Aura reading perks on the other hand, completely remove "seeking" factor from killers' gameplay and completely eliminate stealth factor from survivors. 
---
Once again, I agree that survivors deserve some chances to gain distance (called pallets and windows), but they definitely don't deserve and don't need what current exhaustion perks give them - invincibility and ability to ignore killer. Same for killers, they don't need to be able to find a survivor immediately.
---
But I burned it.... I fucking burned it, swear to God. I was even so sad of missing the SC but the second time I get picked up the SC appeared again. I mean if you really don't believe me and if it won't trouble you that much, go into a SWF and try it out according to what happened to me.

It seems there's three spirits in the game

I use it sometimes on trapper and have good results most of the time. There's so many times where I spawn and see ruin next to a generator across the map next to a generator. I don't even bother because someone most definitely spawned next to it.

That's why people DC to instantly open the hatch :)
---
I'm a girl, but yeah..
---
Give us pyramid head!
---
Hey man why you gotta do me like that
---
I think you had a dream that became a memory
---
DS can only work if they are picked up within a short amount of time. If the killer tunnel said survivor and gets hit with DS, that‚Äôs is their own fault though. I understand you can use DS to go for aggressive play style, but as a killer, keep in mind who was recently pulled off the hook. Once downed, leave them. Wait it out. You don‚Äôt have to pick someone up AS soon as you drop them. Saying the survivors shouldn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù button is a bit much. There are chases where you‚Äôre caught out in a dead zone. You should be punished by spawning there, or attempting to do a gen there. If you‚Äôre looking for a scary game, I‚Äôm afraid DBD isn‚Äôt it. It‚Äôs a hide and seek with extra steps. The killers need help to see them, by that logic, scratch marks shouldn‚Äôt be in the game. Killer need to find survivors, and survivors need to escape them.
---
Geeeg
---
Stop acting like you lose if you don't get a 4k, killers need to stop thinking that if you can't 4k every game with a killer it means they're trash. Spirit and Billy are most definitely gonna get changes at some point, since they are the other problematic ones that can easily 4k.
---
I met this hella toxic chick. She made my one buddy nearly cry (he is 12 don't bully him) by tearing into him on a bunch of shit
---
As a 19 yr old with a 13 year old buddy, that makes me sad.
---
It sucks when literal adults think it's okay to bully younger people. She tried to dig into me too, but I didn't give a damn
---
That sucks, I can feel it too. They should do something about it.
---
Lmfao
---
It's fine if adults choose not to associate with kiddos on Xbox, but that doesn't mean you have to go out of your way to be mean to them. Just leave them be.
---
Mostly because playing against a decent Nurse is an uphill battle. I don't mind playing against Nurse, but that's because I throttle my expectations and play purely for getting all the points I can before I inevitably die.
---
Wraith is ezpz but fun to play
---
Exactly. Don't gotta play with kids but at least show them respect too
---
It should be. He basically moans and groans if 1 survivor goes away. He is infesting his viewers‚Äô minds with the idea that ‚Äúkiller should be easier to play‚Äù while never taking into account 90% of the survivors play the game as solo queue and do not coordinate chases, body blocks and such.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong. He is a good killer and a very good streamer but its getting a little out of hand that he would rather suggest game breaking changes over game balances for SWF (such as slower gen progress when 3-4 ppl SWF queue)
---
tell the clauds that
---
I definitely think he's a bit entitled. And that big streamers such as himself should be more cautious about the shit they spew to their audience. They're pillars of the community and players look up to them. As someone who plays survivor and killer 50/50, I think it's important to see things from both sides.
---
Jokes on you, I don‚Äôt go to school &gt;:)
---
This is a stupid change and clearly made from someone who hasn‚Äôt played the game much
---
You can't handle my potions. They're too strong for you
---
If Jason is the father, Is Oinkers the mother? Reverse bear trap + Machete = Trapper?
---
Haha true! It's sad how u gotta warn ppl to not take this seriously otherwise ul get mentioned on his Twitter as toxic Pepehands. Very funny tho.
---
Both
---
Despite me not mentioning anything about cosmetics, I do like me some cosmetics. But idk. I feel as though event thought these events aren‚Äôt meant to be the main point of the game, it‚Äôs just a nice deviation from doing the same gens over and over again and killing the same survivors over and over again.
---
Two killers?
---
I understand and I know your pain. They'll fix it eventually. I hope.
---
Lol, yes! You play you some Luigi‚Äôs Mansion.
---
I feel like this ever since Ghost Face came out
---
What would a predator buff look like? I have a few ideas but don't know if they would be any good: make scratch marks last longer like the  opposite of lightweight and make it so scratch marks are brighter and there's more of them: what if predator didn't narrow scratch marks because let's be real: it makes it more difficult to track people and it makes it hard to find random scratch marks. Like what if the scratch marks were just as dense as when predator is on but spread out.
---
the progression system on Mobile is totally different
---
Potion Seller, listen to me; I want only your strongest potions.
---
The difference between tru3 and the others mentioned is simple. Tru3 plays this game competitively, while the others take a more casual fun approach.
---
From their point of view if they had fun this match and the last guy escapes with 5 gens left right after they deathhook the third survivor it's all good.
---
But if you think competitvely about it, how is it fair that the hatch allows a random survivor to just escape without having to work for it?
---
It's simple RNG and that is the enemy of competitive games.
---
That also explains why he talks about badly designs for maps so often. Like the ironworks window. There is a chance to give one side a huge advantage without any input from either side.
---
Now you can argue if DBD should be competitive or casual, right now it's hanging somewhere in the middle, pitting fans of either side against each other.
---
Why? She‚Äôs a nice lady and she did the job well enough
---
Feng youre literally the 2nd least popular survivor, but thanks.
---
Idk, although they probably didn‚Äôt have the rights to do anything with The Pig back in February they could‚Äôve been more creative with the year of the pig‚Äîon second thought they have released two cosmetics and gunna release a third in Nov, maybe it really is the year of the pig...
---
Oh i see... Still a noob in licensing but since they already have it, can't they still use it on the Dead by Daylight game?
---
Lmaooo this is so funny to me like u literally just stare at him and he has no power like he literally is just man with knife that sure is strong
---
it says only one works tho
---
or all gens blocked off for 2 minutes
---
No Mither for -200% injured sound reduction
---
Yeah it will actually take the spookiness away. It's more of an action movie. Although the Terminator would be a great addition to the killer roster.
---
because grabbing was the mechanic enabling hatch stand offs and wasn't that like one of the biggest reasons to make EGC?
---
Yeah... I fear we may be ‚Äústuck‚Äù (for lack of a better term) with this shitshow for awhile.
---
I legit cried in every episode.
---
I would but as someone who plays dwight, I am legally not allowed to leave this locker.
---
Because she‚Äôs Asian too? Lol
---
That legit creeped me out as a kid.
---
Oh its obviously more fair for survivors to just not let the survivors have a second chance at leaving. Just give killers 4k every game. Genius.  /s
---
I was excited for DBD since the 3rd year anniversary, but they haven‚Äôt been performing well‚Äîin my opinion‚Äîthis year. Maybe since they had a lot of things planned this year; dedicated servers and The Archives (both delayed btw). Maybe, they bit more than they could chew?
---
I like when this happens to me as GF. It shows that not everything is to be taken too serious and ypu may just chill and laugh for a sec. A complete counterpart to what I normally experience in the game.
---
The second I learned that hex totems basically always spawn around the four corners of the map, totems haven't been that hard to find...with the only exceptions being the swamp and Hawkins lab.
---
Thought you were talking about Huntress
---
Sounds like Nurse needs further nerfs then.
---
Or get carried by safe pallets and good teammates
---
I'm new to reddit so I dont know what I'm kinda doing but thx for letting me know
---
Oh boy,top section here we go
---
Don't.
---
Right because being bm'ing and being a dick in post game and on steam profiles is the same thing as trying to play optimally.   
---
Did you read the text in the meme fam?
---
Calm down big shot.
---
PepeHands
---
But it's too grindy for a mobile game
---
She just ignores everything. Only if she had 0 base chain blinks, it would've probably worked on PC
---
Flip side, it's much easier to patrol the 4 generators that aren't locked down. Almost always get a chase and hook in those first two minutes.
---
What we just gonna put TVs all over the map?
---
Jesus shed be broken in lerys
---
Killer job is to kill no matter the way  so what xD
---
But then that loops into being the weak link, which is SUPER stressful. I'm sure some people are fine with letting teammates down, but that's about on par with me having 3 blendettes doing nothing all game when it comes to stress.
---
Wait are you asking people to be polite when something isn't 100% smooth in the DbD sub? Brother you are actually asking turtles to fly.
---
Bravo Six, going dark
---
When people use hex it‚Äôs a gamble. Imagine you having to search for the totem EVERY SINGLE GAME that would be totally overpowered
---
have you seen a non-grindy mobile game? most of them are grindy as fuck
---
dbd is just one that doesn't allow you to pay up to skip it
---
Nah I'm not a dick to other people for no reason. Even when people are dickheads to me ingame I don't go out of the way to do the same.   
---
I don't see how running a strong build that might be difficult to play against when mostly everybody else is doing the same is taking my anger out on anybody.  
---
also it's a meme, so there's that.
---
Wat happened to wraith?
---
I mean what if the person who got hatch was running the killer a lot of the game and their teammates were just bad? I mean solo queue is a thing and theres nothing you can do if your teammates are stupid. Plus matchmaking is still broken so yea.
---
And that's the thing, you can't earn stuff outside the matches
---
Rancor will tell one of them where you are tho
---
unless you do it post-patch
---
Thats why its fair. Its 100% random for both sides.  I do agree some changes can be added but looking at whos lucky and finds it first, i find it fair. But how would change it. Do tell. Im open to hear you out.
---
And you work with craniums daily?
---
&gt; Adrenaline is only for 5 seconds, although it does give you a insta heal.
---
A survivor being full health and getting a speed boost essentially guarantees that they can waste enough time for gates to be open/ need to be abandoned to prevent the gates from being open. 
---
Yall wanna start running adrenaline killers really don't have a choice but to use noed
---
A thing of beauty
---
I downvote you for the typo and continue this war further.
---
STONKS
---
Sorry for being off topic but I think there should be an r/dbdrants for things like that not just a dedicated day
---
She is strong, but she's quite difficult to play, and at high ranks she can be bullied extremely hard.   
---
OoO absolutely destroys you. Any co-ordinated team can set someone to just keep an eye on you and call out your traps. Or run through them all when you're in a chase with another survivor.  
---
She really needs to capitalize on the pressure she gets from a hook, and snowball from it. As a result i often find i Brutal on her a lot because the game either ends very quickly in an absolute massacre, or i lose badly. She absolutely sucks at chasing since she's so slow, so you really have to setup traps in such a way that they run into them after being hit. Save the Best for Last is amazing for this as you recover from a hit quicker and can teleport to catch them again.  
---
She is a lot of fun, but can be very frustrating sometimes, especially when you teleport to a trap, swing instantly and hit air. Things that slow down the game early, letting you get your traps setup are nice, STBFL is mandatory imo, and then Make Your Choice, Sloppy, Thano etc are nice choices.
---
Killer objective is to kill and i got4 k so what xD
---
**Power: 7 Days**
---
Seven televisions are spawned around the map at preset points, similar to Pig boxes/gens. Teleport to televisions around the map and crawl out with no terror radius after leaving the television for X seconds. Activate your secondary ability while looking toward a television‚Äôs aura on the map to channel your sight through it and look around, silently spying on Survivors that are nearby.
---
I personally see it fair to give someone a second chance. How would you change it? Its 100% random on the location and whoever finds it first kinda wins. Personally I think its very fair although im open to logical changes.
---
Yup, survivors feel entitled... If you can't handle dying then probably don't play.
---
Difference being you can learn where spawn points are/ use perks that can locate totems.
---
Killers have a nearly mandatory perk that has a chance to be invalidated permanently mere seconds into the game
---
I have no suggestions but I don't need a fix to know it's unfair. Do you mind explaining how it's fair? Sure, the hatch is random but what is a killer doing when the hatch opens? Oh, right. They're killing the last person letting that last person save their own ass by finding the hatch and waiting for that last person to die. Not exactly fair is it when I can be in one corner of the map and have it be physically impossible to close the hatch before they escape is it?
---
You know what the only way to guarantee you kill all 4 people? Slugging. It makes the game boring for both sides, especially for the person waiting to get hooked. So people have to decide: Do I want to let the last person go because they have one hell of a head start or does the game drag on because I want to kill them all?
---
fuck now i want him in the game why did you do this
---
I actually thought of this power for her too and when the demogorgons came out I was kind of upset since it would pretty much be this as well. TVs or Wells. Whatevs.
---
Not stalking when you keep posting just to have your posts removed lmao. Also I'm not low enough rank to be in a match with you ;)
---
What happened to you saying you were red ranks? Lol
---
I'm making a killer concept for him as well so prepare to want him even more
---
Because, if not a single gen is done, he's just as much of a potato than the other three.
---
I'd rather see something classic like a Vampire or Werewolf, personally.
---
You think you're safe?
---
I have the body ready but I couldn‚Äôt find a mask so I had to get a basic one and attach some horns and paint it red. 
---
Wonder how that will go.
---
Amazing job by the way! I‚Äôd love to see a shot from different angles.
---
Pred used to make scratches last longer.  It is absolutely hard garbage if it does that.
---
Pretty much
---
Why's that? Because it doesn't matter if the scratch marks are too old or what?
---
Exactly!! every time I play a low tier killer fully expecting to blow ass, but also just wanting to switch it up to have fun, I get toxic survivors. It's more frustrating for killers because killers arent just basically skins like survivors... killers get a double whammy if they dont play "good perks" AND "good killers"
---
Omg that is so freaking awesome!
---
Tough to keep yourself entertained when you work in a morgue
---
"you won't lose when you actually a  lose"
---
Yeah, participation trophy.
---
Playing survivor must be stressful, if you ask me. Blame me for biased opinion, but currently playing survivor isn't stressful at all. Killer is not a threat bc you just blast away with exhaustion perk and find yourself near pallets and windows where you are safe. Head On&amp;QaQ&amp;DS combo exists only to bully a killer and make fun of him. DS solely is not a tunneling perk (otherwise DS would turn off when killer attacks/downs/hooks another survivor) and encourage extremely aggressive gameplay. 
---
I'm fine with survivors having something to fight back, but currently they have too much, that they don't feel like a prey anymore. More like 4 kids in a ZOO taunting tiger in cage. If they are not careful, they get hurt. But they use sticks and throw stones at tiger to annoy him even more and when tiger just gives up on trying to get them they start insulting him, knowing the tiger can understand them. Current DbD feels exactly like this. Of course some tigers are experienced enough to deceive those kids and get them, but they quickly get punished by ZOO owners (devs) for this (nerfs). Sometimes ZOO owners punish kids if they torment the tiger too much, but it happens rarely bc kids pay for this. And no one gives a single fuck about what tiger feels. He is bad by default and exists only to be an entertainment for kids.
---
Tbh, i told you how it is fair. Its 100% random and not guaranteed that they find it before you. Although i do get what you mean at the end of the day. Slugging is boring and personally i dont do it. I just hook people and usually dont slug cause I know its boring for both sides. Sometimes i do slug if i want the survivor to get picked up or if i want the game to drag on. I do think a mechanic change is in order but As it is right now, we just need to grin a bear it. And i dont mind how it is and i dont know how you can make it more fair.
---
Uhm no? If he went for saves, got chased, he didn‚Äôt get the chance to do a gen
---
Stupidity at its finest
---
Because then they have a tendency to overlap and mislead you
---
Even so you still can hide. And yes, you'd better use this build after new patch. At the moment it is good to replace Rancor with another tracking/endgame perk
---
I like hugging gens and saving people
---
You can make it more fair by it not spawning before there's only one survivor left or when the gens are powered.
---
Removed for name shaming
---
But you're not supposed to be pissed that much that you only got 3k instead of 4. It's still a huge victory. It shouldn't be a huge change for you to have the last survivor escape. And if it is, maybe you're not approaching the game with the right state of mind, because it's clearly not designed around sweaty competitive gameplay.
---
Dear god I don‚Äôt want to have a mobile player as a teammate.

---
this text gave me a good laugh specially the end where you bothered to message them asking why tbags
---
some people in this game are so clueless its actually hilarious
---
I usually don't get that upset, but it happened SO MUCH for SO LONG. It was more about me being annoyed at myself for letting them affect me rather than raging at the game itself. Also nice name. u/AidsJohnsn
---
I kinda get what he means about Billy.
---
Nurse and Spirit are good on pretty much any map, Billy is very map depended.
---
so I actually went to watch the video thinking it would be absolutely absurd but he elaborates on ways to make it fair to the survivor and the killer. I normally find Tru3 to be a massive complainer because he has a really heavy bias towards killer but in this case I can actually see his idea not being ridiculous for once. here‚Äôs the link https://youtu.be/ljLGeS2Wb6c
---
Depending on what you did sure, but I'm on my first hook after looping 4 gens and you're running and pointing hatch? Etc ruins it.  I only tbag or corner to get healed or to fuck with blendit
---
Now that I look back on it I laugh at it too. I don't usually send hate mail since I know that's what they want but something in me just kind of snapped this time. u/cruzerreddit
---
yo the nostalgia i just got from looking at that cool motherfucker thank you
---
Im the same when I swf with my group. We tend to just fuck about and try and do stupid shit.
---
Not only mine, just watch some "non-competitive" streamers - lots of goofing around. And when I play as a killer I see this, too. Even obvious SWFs (like complementing nicknames, "clan tags") play "casually" often enough.
---
Freddy‚Äôs gen teleport with Demo‚Äôs undetectable?
---
Thanks you can call me Ervin if it makes you feel better.  Yeah fix paragraphs plz I won't read it all like that, but you gotta find something in-between.  I play animal crossing sometimes lol
---
Id just straight up dc if that was my ruin
---
Does every chase end in a down for you? You can lose the killer or they can peel off, sometimes they even just give up after awhile. When my friend plays he runs the killer most the game and usually only gets hooked once.
---
Be like the OP, start using it as a bait
---
I once had a match in rank 8, I did 4 totems and ruin was still active. Granted I just did totems when I found one (and not search for it constantly) as we did all gens (did 2 myself) and escaped.  
---
Sometimes people ignore ruin and just power through it.
---
This dude is a joke. *As he's carrying the 4th survivor to a hook on a teamwipe that's lasted less than 5 minutes* "there's just too many pallets on these maps! They need to reduce the pallets."
---
Got dangerously close to an unwanted shave for a second there.
---
More downtime and there's less thinking required overall. Not to mention, if you have a bad game you'll be out of it faster compared to the killer who have to suffer through to the end.
---
Yesterday I came back to dbd and switched to pc,a very kind pig gave me the hatch even if I wanted to give him the 4k,whoever you are thanks for reminding me that nice people still exist
---
My "Small Game" David is my survivor main right now. I've had good luck bumping into the ruin hex just feet away last several games.
---
If you're getting away then shouldn't you be doing a gen then? You're either not the last 1 alive or your contributing to the "bad team that isn't doing gens" part.
---
Imma be honest. Quit the game if its affecting you this badly. I used to sob about dbd all the time. I havent touched the game in 6 months and have felt better for it. 
---
I watch youtubers if i ever feel like playing because fuck going back to the game
---
It probably happens even more often than people realise to be honest
---
My problem with poorly written rant paragraphs is that while I'm typing, I'll remember something that happened so I just kind of try to force it in there somehow and it never looks pretty. That and I type so fast when I'm upset that I know there's no real point in going back and fixing that mess. u/AidsJohnsn

Ok, so why should I do gens when my entire team is down? I could pick them up and have more teammates to do generators/create distractions while I‚Äôm saving the other idiots or getting chased by the killer
---
You can
---
Killer OP Perk - can be removed from the game before it ever has any effect by performing an activity that is useful due to stopping a number of perks and even rewards bloodpoints  
---
Survivor OP Perk - cannot be stopped by the killer in any meaningful way (adrenaline) or forces a double negative choice (slug someone who will get picked up or pick them up and get stunned for 5 seconds) 
---
nah
---
Playing killer may be more stressful, but playing solo survivor is more frustating, that's my experience at least.
---
it's bullshit though, count the number of games you see NOED in, its like one in 10 at max.  
---
count the number of games that you have MULTIPLE Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Dead Hard in
---
Nurse is just really hard, I main Pig so it's definitely a huge leap for me. Like I said before it doesn't often do this to me but I think everyone has their moments in any multiplayer game whether they want to admit it or not. I enjoy the game too much to quit just because there's some bad apples. Cute_Trash_ ‚Ä¢

K
---
You do no tru is 50/50 as well right? and his quite a good surv also its not like he just said HUR DER HATCH BAD I WANT FREE 4KS. He actually gave a good replacement that in my opinion fits the final girl theme way better then a magic hole spawning randomly for doing nothing. my biggest problem is it spawning when no gens are done that's like if the killer has no kills and all gens are done he gets a free rancor. Just for one last chance that would be bs just like a 5 gen hatch is.
---
Instant, as everyone will just DC from such a boring game
---
&gt;I‚Äôd love for that logic to be true for both sides of the aisle here but it just isn‚Äôt.
---
It isn't logic - it is truth.
---
The rest of your reply goes back to saying how survivors don't need items to be a threat. That is irrelevant and isn't a reason for removing items from a game or denying introducing more in. That is a balancing issue. Items are not the problem.
---
Killer addons provide exactly the same customisation and fun elements to a game. None are a must have to win. They also benefit from having a power - which survivors do not have in their gameplay,
---
Bottom line is without items and perks that can be tailored to certain strategies - or be used in conjunction with each other, then this game wouldn't be fun to play for survivors.
---
I think this game should entertain as many options and variations as possible. That is what makes it fun. Removing elements completely because they gets used well at high ranks is incredibly short-sighted. These things have always been in the game.
---
Even if it's not actually James, it'd be cool to have a horror fan in the vein of L4D Zoey.
---
No, I don't think she's even asian. They do share similarities though: probably because of the hair, the contortion, also a vengeful spirit of a young girl, pale skin, that japanese "onyro" or whatever they're called appearance. I think it would be redundant to include her after Rin.
---
Tru3 bad, Otz good.  
---
Now give me the upvote.  
---
The dude isn't even a killer main, give him a  break. If you hate him then don't watch him, how hard is it?
---
I still believe chucky would be the greatest addition to the game
---
Tru3 bad, everyone else good.
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt like his content myself, but I swear all this subreddit is doing is blabbing on about how much he sucks and how we should all polish (insert streamer/Youtuber here)‚Äôs nutsack every day.
---
As long as he hasn‚Äôt done any noncery like Ochido, there‚Äôs no need for it
---
Dude c mon, watch his ‚Äúhow to loop a rank 1 billy‚Äù and show him say that billy is the proof that itms an overrated killer. Literally one of the most mediocres billies I‚Äôve seen

He does the same with nurse: ‚Äúhow to counter nurse‚Äù-&gt; it‚Äôs a nurse with ruin.

Eh Plague‚Äôs skins are very boring compared to other killers skins
---
Tbh i quit entirely after over a year of plenty and sinking 50 quid into the game. 
---
I played both survivor and killer and it just stopped being fun
---
Its a competitive game gone too far. Its got too many young kids who think because theyre behind a screen their actions dont hurt.
---
Ive mained literally most killers apart from trapper, billy and the licensed dlc killers. 
---
Survivors are some of the most insatiable peices of shits and it fucking shows. 
---
I quit because no matter what you do, no matter how good you get, no matter how you play, someone is always upset regardless. 
---
I quit because people advocate harassing new players or those with little experience with other killers. 
---
I sank 300+ hours in the space of a year and i got high rank. 
---
I quit because i started getting anxiety attacks and sobbing from players just being assholes.
---
Honestly pretty sure majority of the totem spots in asylum are in the main building/ wide open field with absolutely 0 things obstructing view/ on top of the hills

People like me who still want Chucky. :(
---
Happened to me before too. Was an afk wraith
---
how is it my fault if my potato ass teammates let Myers tier up? if I barely feed him anything and the randoms feed him a lot, then I‚Äôm gonna use whatever counter I can to avoid getting tombstoned. also killers aren‚Äôt entitled to their achievements just like survivors aren‚Äôt.
---
Freddy, Ghostface and Demogorgon are also very viable at red ranks, and plague doing okay.
---
I mean, the full optimal SWF group is always going to be the exception to that, but most games are solo/duo queuers. And in that scenario, we get at least 7 viable killers.
---
I wouldn't think about it too much. This game attracts mega morons and due to the gameplay mechanics, gives them a lot of power to make other people's experience a misery.
---
I mean no offense but it kinda sounds like you're just bad at killer, and either very good at survivor or you're still low ranks + basing your opinion on rank 15-20.l, ESPECIALLY if you can lose killers in a chase just through one use of an exhaustion perk.
---
Watch limmy. He streams dbd sometimes
---
&gt;Yeah, Mettle of Man was strong and did need a change but damn. They could've at least tied it to safe hook saves instead.
---
They tried that on PTB before the nerf and it was easier to get it active than being hit 3 times. Plus at the same time they changed how the Endurance protection worked and it also protected you from M2s or exposed even while healthy.
---
&gt;Like I said, Mettle of Man was rather strong but it kind of felt right if it was Ash himself using it. And it was counterable by many killer utilities: Bear Traps, Chainsaws, Corrupt Purge, Ambush, Feral Frenzy, Hatchets, and any instant down could all bypass it. I'm not saying that it should go back to what it was. If more than one person had it equipped, it was rather unfair.
---
I used MoM from the moment it got released to the moment it got nerfed and rarely had problems getting it active against Billy or Huntress. 
---
&gt;I think that for the Obsession, MoM should be how it was before, but for people using it who aren't the Obsession, it should be how it is now. Kind of like the old DS, which was another unfair obsession perk, at least was not totally unfair if multiple people had it. That also means you run the risk of having such a powerful perk, but are vulnerable to Rancor or Remember Me.
---
The problem with MoM is the effect it gives (Endurance) not how easy or hard it is to get it active. MoM shouldn't even have existed.
---
Flip-flop and boil over is pretty good combo if the killer slugs ppl. But if a killer downs an ash they're going to most likely hook him because they know he has flip flop
---
If it were me it‚Äôd be haunted grounds
---
Terrifying haha
---
I mean that added Leatherface after Billy and Ghosface after Legion they'd  just make a new power and design
---
Wonderful!Why don't you put this in a frame in your room?
---
How many times have you posted this exact same clip today?
---
But it isn't. Survivors getting caught by the killer or not doing gens is skill-based. There's no luck, ping notwithstanding, about whether or not you get caught by the killer. And even when they catch you eventually, if your team is good, they killer already loses if they tunnel vision you and 4 gens get done. That's on the killer
---
The hatch is literally, 100% rng. There's a bit of a false comparison going on here between matchmaking giving you potato survivors and the last survivor taking the hatch.
---
As a survivor main, I'd be PISSED if ruin spawned right there. It's not getting popped for sure.
---
Ive played both sides and encountered toxicity only from survivors. Ive met plenty of killers that have gone sorry for all the dcs have hatch. Ive never had a survivor go "sorry for dc heres why" or 'sorry i had to dc good luck". Some people will find anyone but themsleves to blame for their mistakes.
---
Less toxic garbage -&gt; More normal people.
---
People are toxic because everyone is toxic and everyone is popularizing toxic behavior. 
---
I understand Devs are too scared of losing people and money, but bloodletting is what this game desperately needs.
---
I'm still mad the devs of Last Year killed the game before coming out on steam. I was really looking forward to playing it. WTF were they thinking, releasing as a discord exclusive?! I at least get being an Epic exclusive because they're indie developers, but they chose edgy Skype instead?? 
---
Ugh, excuse me, I'm gonna go watch let's plays of it and lament its downfall some more.
---
Otz good, goose better.
---
I know a lot of people want the child‚Äôs play chapter, but I just want grown up Andy, not Chucky. He would most likely ruin the game for a lot of people
---
I would definitely prefer Friday the 13th over Dbd but I have no one to play it with and everyone there that I've met was screaming kids. u/Cute_Trash_ ‚Ä¢
---
Well what is considered a win for a killer then?
---
Think of it this way, the perk is okay but other perks do it‚Äôs job better. First off Slippery meat will only work on your first hook and than that‚Äôs it and the issue is nothing is guaranteed. You can still go through 6 attempts and not get off than be put in struggle and now next chase you die. Second, perks like deliverance and up the ante do it better. Deliverance could be a guaranteed chance while Up the Ante gives a 12% increase to everyone‚Äôs luck so you jump of 15% each attempt. Slippery meats second use (traps) is also done better by small game especially with ruin being very useful now. Lastly slippery meat compared to something like sprint burst, spine chill, prove thyself or adrenaline makes it seem pretty low-tier compared to them. Slippery meat can be run and it‚Äôs not terrible just that other perks outshine it or are just flat-out better than it.
---
Do I really have to put /s
---
I quit the game for a year for this exact same reason, I just didn‚Äôt feel welcomed in the community because of ‚ÄúOoOoO TrAsH KiLlEr OnLy WiN bY tUnNeLiNg‚Äù and ‚ÄúBoOoStEd RaNk 6 oNlY wOn BeCaUsE yOu HaD rUiN‚Äù one of the insults when as far as calling me a disgrace to my family because of a fucking video game. I have trouble with anxiety too so if it takes this much on a toll just quit the game it‚Äôs better for you mentally.
---
does the ghost face mori actually record the picture? it should. that'd be great.
---
If a survivor presents you the god pallet you eat and be grateful. No buts.
---
really wish i didnt open that link in work :')
---
I refuse. This was obviously a joke.
---
I never use items,  guess thats why im rank 20.  Im that guy who has 99 healing items in rpgs because I refuse to use them.
---
"90% of survivors play solo queue" is just not true if you are playing in red ranks.
---
Yeah i tend to play with my bf or a friend. Ive only started playing it recently but i always have game chat disabler
---
&gt;You should expect this and adapt your tactics to this. By the way, you are not meant to escape all together. If killer camps he gets 2 kills at best, which fits 2/2 scheme devs are trying to follow.
---
If the killer camps we finish all generators and save with BT so we all can escape. He only gets 2 kills by camping if the survivors are also bad.
---
I kinda wish we had a zombie killer, but is that too similar to the plague?
---
Yes! Another understanding person. I usually handle the game pretty well even though I'm supposed to be on anxiety medicine because of how aggravated and upset I can get. If I get upset like this again then I'm just going to move to some other game.
---
This change would not stop toxicity at all. As I said before this change would greatly hurt the game this would have two outcomes ppl would stop playing and like I said really hurt the game cause of a lack of income and also ppl would just start time joining just like the old days without swf just so they can play with friends without being heavily restricted
---
I have a Spirit that isn‚Äôt even prestiged and I get one or two PB per bloodweb.
---
I tried convincing my boyfriend to play it with me but he hates it. I could try again but I doubt it would work. u/Cute_Trash_ ‚Ä¢
---
Never seen killers being called a power role, heard that a lot about survivors though. Survivors gameplay can be stressful as well, sure - typically while playing solo. On the other hand, playing SWF is cathartic, and I think that's where the problem lies. SWF gives you massive benefits that are in no way accounted for in the matchmaking system - ability to know where your teammates and the killer are, what they're doing at any given time, plan and coordinate effectively etc. Generator speed is also a problem - assuming people can hit ruin skill checks, it's 80 sec per gen - 100 sec of working on gens per survivor average, less with toolboxes. Assuming 1 survivor is busy looping the killer the average increases to just 133.3 seconds and you can realistically loop for at least a minute, unless against top tier killers.
---
Essentially stress is a matter of pressure, but for killer the pressure comes from time, whereas for survivors it comes from killer's activity. Killer needs to be proactive AND successful to apply pressure whereas survivors just need to hold a button next to a gen.
---
Honestly same
---
we also weren't talking about survivor achievements
---
I will admit it takes a little bit of time to learn the mechanics. But if he doesnt like it, find another game to play, taking a break from a game is still good
---
"save with BT" I still don't see a problem for you to keep the person with BT safe. 
---
Still, 4x4 second chance perks is horrible to deal with. It is still winnable but you don't feel it like a win. Barely any satisfaction, just mental exhaustion and frustration from Nightmare Level difficulty.
---
Hoow do u do this?
---
we were talking about achievements and how you think killers are entitled to them. it only makes sense to point out that both sides aren‚Äôt entitled to their achievements.
---
He really is.
---
Same but legion
---
+1 for Pinhead!!
---
True.
---
If shit goes wild again with survivors just take a break or quit the game entirely. If your looking for a replacement try Friday the 13th. But if you still want the mad power that all killers get try Payday 2 unrelated as hell but it helped me get the mad power trip feeling killer gave me.
---
The only busted instadown add-on is the iri head, which is not used too often, so it's not that big of a deal.
---
Thank you so much again for the talk but I'm getting sleepy. I was expecting nothing but toxicity, but responses like yours is always a welcome surprise because honestly nothing makes me feel better more than someone who can genuinely relate and be real with shit.
---
Ok I don‚Äôt get why this community has such a hate boner for tru3. He‚Äôs a really interesting streamer and has helped me get from 20-1 every season he taught me how to play nurse,spirit, and every-other killer. He also got me into this game and I‚Äôve been playing it for 3 years. So what if he has ideas about balance he‚Äôs been playing this game since beta and some of his ideas are not bad, yes most of his ideas are buffs to killer but tru3 plays solo at red ranks and does just fine because he understands killer and loops he‚Äôs one of the best players as he plays both sides.
---
First of all, the point ?
---
Second, almost EVERY SINGLE (free event based) UPDATE, comes delayed in case you arent able to read properly my first message. (or just wanted  to prove yourself right with this poor argument).
---
Who classifies you as a ass-kisser but thats not the point.  The point is, it still proves a poor team management, even if cosmetics, as you imply because you must be a 3D modeler of such are "easy" (sent us your book soon !)
---
They maybe are never delayed but sometimes are a poor quality (clipping ecetera) David mains can relate. And are fixed one or two patch later.
---
Sooo your point is flawed.
---
Camping and tunneling are two different things.
---
1.Boil over doesnt do anything
---
2.Nobody is looking out for flip flop
---
Good break down. Is this a good build or the perks don't synergize well?
---
 Deliverance 
---
No mither
---
Decisive strike 
---

---
If a killer is garbage it is not a defence, it is bullying. 
---
And I'm not crying about perks, I'm not suggesting their nerfs of else. Feel free to use your second-chance shit that carries you, I'm against facing 4 of these perks which are used by SWF with voice comms, which are basically cheats.
---
That's not how that works
---
Thank you!
---
Fookin dead ard
---
That's what I was thinking
---
its a green key with no addons they found in a chest
---
your comment bad  
---
my post good
---
I'm on Team Hell Priest with this one. Pinhead deserves a renaissance
---
that‚Äôs good for you that you‚Äôre nice like that, but if you can‚Äôt see the fact that both sides aren‚Äôt entitled to achievements, then you‚Äôre stupid. both situations involve one side being ‚Äúnice‚Äù to the other, and you‚Äôre acting like some extra points drastically changes the situation here.
---
Yeah protection hits are super broken
---
Iri hatchets becomes worse then regular hatchets then
---
But if teachables were stuck on a character then it becomes pay to win. Plus even more of a grind for new players and the builds will be boring as you can‚Äôt have fun.
---
Yes it‚Äôs 3 strikes and your out
---
I imagine that would be cool. Like either one main map or just you can play as all the maps in the game
---
‚ÄúOh there‚Äôs a spooky tv by this generator, let me just fix it as if there‚Äôs nothing there. Oh my. Some little white girl fell down the well. Now the TV‚Äôs leaking. Oh Christ. Oh god. Oh no‚Äù

*madly flashlight spams and teabags in abject terror*
---
it's 1 mind trying to read and manage to adapt to 4 other different minds in a handful of minutes,it can be satisfying yet tiring,that's why I switched to survivor
---
Listen here , he‚Äôs not being entitled Rather suggesting a better design he explained that slugging for the 4K is just really bad design and suggested a better way for the both sides to win with a fair chance.
---
another unoriginal post about how horrible survivors are? doubt
---
Didn't ochido get banned loads of times on PC before it was perma?
---
Or make it so fresher marks glow way brighter
---
For every time this happens, it‚Äôs almost impossible to find 10 times.
---
Samara - Remake Franchise
---
Sadako - Japanese Franchise
---
Kayako - The Grudge Franchise 
---
:)
---
What did you get banned for
---
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaah no.
---
Unfortunately you just have to deal with it. Also, the ‚Äúdifferent perks‚Äù thing would harm surviving with randoms too.
---
It‚Äôs not like a random could tell who‚Äôs running what, you don‚Äôt get to know what someone is running on their build before you enter a game.
---
And just to go over the last idea for your memento Mori. Absolutely not. Lmao. The ability to kill a survivor early and basically BBQ &amp; Chilli - except you can‚Äôt even hide in a locker to protect yourself. No. Also, I‚Äôm sorry that a survivor playing stealth toward your Mori is costing you the ability. I‚Äôm sorry nobody wants to hand you a win. Is that what you wanted?
---
My goodness. You‚Äôre telling people they need to adapt their play style, but it kinda feels like you need to adapt yours.
---
He kept buying the game over and over on different accounts to the point they had to hardware ban him
---
I don't like the idea particularly, they both share some similarities but Rin is 100% her own character with a great background and having her appear as Samara would make her seem less original and unique imo.
---
I think it‚Äôs more on the competitive side because of the rank but they really should add a unranked mode to make for those who just want fun and all
---
1st game play mechanics then communication abuse
---
Lemme paint you a picture: 
---
Ive had many games where Im the only teammate doing gens and everytime I get decent progress on a gen here comes claudette with the killer and guess who peels off? Which I don't blame the killer cause why would you chase the survivor you found urbaning around the map over the one doing a gen? Then I get my first hook and the urbaning claud gets hooked, kills themselves, and the killer finds a new target. Meanwhile I get saved barely before struggle or just into struggle as that survivor goes down, they dc because "boohoo i went down after a 15 second chase better just quit now". Then last person goes down, maximum of 20 seconds on that chase because idiocy, I've barely started a gen after healing, surprise they attempt escape, struggle, and then give up when I don't immediately appear to save them. Now its me, the killer, five gens, and a hatch. Ranks at the end of the match; 3 other survivors 15-20, myself at 10 or 9, and the killer at 6-8. Another flawless matchmaking job :3 kill me
---
Yeah, sorry if it wasn't clear, but i just wanted to lvl her up and be back to GF. Just got him to P3!
---
Same. If I‚Äôm lucky we find it with 1-2 gens left.
---
&gt;People have this weird hate boner for him, while ignoring that his actual solution, from a balance standpoint, makes a ton of sense.
---
That's this reddit in a nutshell, really. Almost every day we get a ha-ha meme aimed at him by the bullies of this community. It's so childish.
---
Then there's just me who wants the Alien.
---
To be fair, the other three survivors were probably camping the hook too.
---
Good job on P3!
---
Stop being a little fan boy. There are many more survivors that have dog shit teachables.
---
I think playing all the maps in the game seeing that the spiral is a being of some sort
---
Her name is Samara. üòÉ
---
This is literally just Demogorgon...
---
How can she see?
---
No, the event is the same time it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôve lost anything.
---
Lol u kidding? New content rarely kills games as those who dont like it just keep cracking on with the bits they do.
---
Except dbd doesnt have in game chat for survivors like every other team-based competitive game. Also its not really competitive since rank doesn't matter, just ask matchmaking.
---
As a Hag main and Myers fangirl, I feel seen.
---
You should be fine on med-high settings
---
&gt;Lol u kidding? New content rarely kills games as those who dont like it just keep cracking on with the bits they do.
---
I meant the part about removing SWF from standard game mode.
---
&gt;both situations involve one side being ‚Äúnice‚Äù to the other
---
That's also not correct
---
You aren't nice for not entering a locker. You are a dick for entering one.
---
You aren't a dick for killing the survivor once the rest has escaped via the hatch. You are nice for letting them go.
---
Yeah fair enough, its all good i was just being a snarky bitch for no reason probably.
---
a post about the unfortunate cycle of toxicity in this community that I atleast put some editing into instead of text over dining table cat.   
---
Ill keep an eye for your next post bro, so I can see how a true meme god does it.
---
Communication abuse might not be perma ban, just don‚Äôt call people swear words
---
That sounds like it‚Äôd be awesome
---
OH BOI I'M SO EXCITED
---
I haven't had a chance to try Freddy out yet!
---
those last two sentences are arguable honestly
---
Yes because doing it in KYF lobbies using spectator mode is sooo difficult I‚Äôm not saying I would report him more on watch out and well yeah people will abuse anything like the legion one as well wasn‚Äôt the wake up just resilience without being injured ?
---
I have seen flip flop working ONCE and i slug survivors pretty consistently so you are right
---
Just don‚Äôt think it would work
---
I just like scaring the shit out of people in tier 1
---
I do understand that as a counter point
---
With all the bugs DbD has it's a masterpiece compared to the pile of garbage F13 is.
---
Such a waste of shack pallet, you could have easily just moved to the right and avoided it.
---
If the killer was smart, you would've wasted the god pallet.
---
r/okbuddydaylight
---
Garbage ideas from garbage survivor mains are garbage, you can‚Äôt convince someone who doesn‚Äôt want to be convinced.
---
‚ÄúPretty good shape‚Äù
---
what is gameplay mechanics abuse ? I‚Äôm legit curious.
---
I will say it‚Äôs a much better effort than most of the posts on here, but yeah go ahead and keep an eye out if it makes u feel better to wait to shit on anything I post lmao
---
I was being a cunt and locked a whole SWF in the basement while playing as huntress.
---
Hey just to let you know this post got you on kids are f****** stupid and it's also on emkay and video has half a million views as right now here's the link https://youtu.be/HELOlNssxTI

BUT ME DOCTA
---
That is true tho
---
Saw a fanmade poster of an idea to add Jacket from hotline miami. Still to this day my favorite killer idea, but maybe that's just me since I'm a huge HM fan
---
shave yourself to make space for your beard to grow equally on every spot of your face,go do some jogging with your fav music every now and then to increase your testosterone,congrats you're now Jeff Johansen
---
I completely agree that devs should be accountable by their lack of communication and since the change wouldnt cost them anything and i am sure they would release praise from the community for this easily
---
But take into consideration that this sub like every fan sub has a lot of mindless folowers with no backbone - the same kind of people who will buy fallout 76 subscription service and defend it
---
Consumers should defend their rights to a good product
---
You just got to ignore those losers they have nothing better to do and I doubt they even have a popular discord to show ppl. Ppl like that are usually alone
---
Also given how wonky hitboxes and movement can be in this game, I can't imagine a killer that crawls on walls would be easy to play...
---
OP got suspended for holding the game hostage and a lot of people in this sub love to go around saying there is no punishments in DBD and reports do nothing. 
---
Not trashtalking you, OP, I even appreciate you sharing what happened to you. Maybe some people read this and change their mind about breaking the rules.
---
I hate this guy
---
ya and his ability could be something like when he activates his watch the starts swaying it from side to side ticking faster the closer you get to a survivor but if a survivor is to look at you (like ghost face) it will put the ability back on cool down but will cause the survivor to suffer the exposed effect and have their position revealed for 3 seconds. 
---
if the look see is to hit while using his ability it instantly goes on cool down 
---
when using his ability his movement speed is reduced by 10% 
---
perks: 
---
Let go: every time a survivor unhooks another survivor they gain a -5% to healing, repairing and sabotage speed. let go has a cool down of 30,20,10 seconds 
---
Mindgames: after being stunned your terror radius is reduced to 0 and your red light is removed for 10, 15, 20 seconds. mindgames has a cool down of 50,40,30 seconds.
---
I see you: survivor‚Äôs get an unnerving chill just thinking of you.
---
every time a survivor sees you, you gain a token, you lose all tokens when you kill a survivor. 
---
maximum tokens that can be gained are 8 
---
each token you earn decreases a survivors action speed by 3%,4%,5%
---
that would be the way i‚Äôd do the look see anyway.
---
I suppose so it just seems wild to me lol, he went to the extra effort on console to harass us which can easily get his account locked since Sony is really have handed on reports these days.
---
&gt; but yeah go ahead and keep an eye out if it makes u feel better to wait to shit on anything I post lmao   
---
Yeah don't worry chief, that last bit of my comment was pretty obviously sarcasm and not an admission of any desire to stalk your profile... but if that's what you extrapolated then whatever floats your boat.   
---
I'm just gonna stop responding now.
---
I feel this will destroy the ability to play this game with friends! I‚Äôm a solo player, but you have to understand not everyone is in a high end SWF group. Some perks are essential in beating a certain killer or increase your survivability a lot. These changes only favour the killer and would ruin the concept of any perk being meta! 
---
If you wan‚Äôt to nerf the SWF groups you also have to balance the killer facing them. 
---
How would this apply to a team of only 2 or 3. Those extra solo players could be screwd over, Cause they don‚Äôt have the right perks they have to survive ln their own?
---
You should take a break if the game gets to you that much, since you already got banned twice for bad behavior.
---
Huzzah a man of #BUTMEDOCTA
---
I mean the survivors not dying in 10 seconds actually ties in rather well to the slasher idea, your getting injured,maimed, bleeding as you desperately slam a pallet down and attempt to hide from the killer. Its only surface level because the primary meta turned into ring around the rosey and killers being none threats if you on the delivering end of a safe pallet.
---
I mentioned in another post but looping is quite a issue, its the sole reason why killers have such a reactive role, why killers play on the backfoot, why killers powers and meta is defined by 'can this stop loops' and why a great survivor will always beat a great killer, because of Safe loops, because if a survivor makes it to a safe loop it is almost completely in the survivors hands, there is borderline nothing most killers can do to get that survivor until the survivor itself makes a large mistake, yes you can 'mindgame' but at the end of the day its once again all about wether the survivor goofs
---
. Its why the Nurse is the best killer in the game right now, because she bypasses the looping stuff, allowing a killers actual skill to come into the equation, suddenly its not about waiting for a survivor to goof up on a loop, its about wether you as the Nurse are able to control and lead your blinks, and its about you as the survivor being unpredictable and attempting to get into the nurses head to shift directions away from said blinks. Nurse is strong because she is one of the few killers that directly allows killer skill and survivor skill to be matched up equally in a interaction.
---
If you‚Äôre looking for someone to play with, add me, I‚Äôm down to play most times. Gt‚Äôs ProtectUrHealer.
---
Since it was just a message of trash talking I doubt Sony would do anything other than telling you to block. But ya some ppl have nothing better to do
---
Fuck anybody that wants longer ‚Äúhold mouse 1‚Äù objectives.
---
that last bit of my comment was pretty obviously exaggeration but have a good day anyway!!!
---
If you want to report someone for something that happened in game you have to make sure that you reported them in the post lobby screen or support have nothing to work with.
---
Also bans on console are basically non-existent apart from in special circumstances since microsoft/sony don't want devs having that much power.
---
I‚Äôm stuff
---
Ya I had a killer message me one time and call me trash after I was the only one on my time who ran him for more than 30 seconds. Of course there wasnt much I can do playing with randoms who were definitely not experienced, and yet he has the audacity to message me after he wiped the floor with us?
---
 I completely understand where you're coming from it sucks but I've just turned off my messages, I play fair but it's just not worth listening to people whine because they died to a facecamped or I killed them when I'm killer
---
Oh no sony will straight up ban people for swearing in messages now even casually, Dane goes for threats of any kind
---
The only time I have a problem with hatch is when the survivor that was hiding the whole game and never helped their teammates or did any gens gets out because they let their teammate die, play like that shouldn't be rewarded, which is why I think there should be a stat requirement on the final survivor to open the hatch.
---
Can't speak about tofu as i haven't watched him, but otz is not competitive. He's a theorycrafter and a min maxer for sure, but he still plays with a casual approach. He cares more about making his builds work than the win.
---
I don't understand your view on fairness.
---
You choose to solo que (as do i, never have played SWF to this day). Getting bad teammates is the risk of that. The game giving one side a 2nd chance in the form of the hatch is a catchup mechanic, like mario kart giving you better items the worse your position is. That's fine for casual play, but if you want the game to be competitive that's clearly unfair.
---
Imagine playing rainbow six siege and one team is a group of friends, the other a pug. As the pug is losing a kill button spawns that can take out the other team if the last person activates it, while the friends team can merely disable the button should they find it first.

Wow this is a shitpost and not a funny one
---
You try to tell they are common, then you tell people you got them FIRST time on the tree on level 46
---
If its a bait - congrats
---
If not - i have a loss of words for the hipocrisy you are showing
---
&gt;The hatch is literally, 100% rng.
---
Yes..... thats what I been saying that its also 100% luck if you find it. Its a 50:50 odds that either one of you find it first. 
---
&gt;You should watch the 2m video, but it's basically some pallets respawn, you have to run the killer around for X amount of time, and at the end, the gates open or you win. Much better and more skill based than the hatch/keys.
---
Okay. Now explain to me, how does this help. You are giving the killer a chance to easily get 40k without an issue. What if the killer is a michael and he has Tier 3, what if its billy or any killer. Also this doesnt help cause the survivor will just hide until the killer either loses intrests and dc's or he juat gives up. Theres literally no point to this whatsoever and it worsens things. Also if the killer got 3 people, we can already assume he has some skill. And you removed the hatch all together. This is terribly one sided plan and doesnt work at all. This is not a solution, its only making matters worse.
---
Yeah players who are super toxic but whine when they get facecamped after are priceless, toxic as in constant tbagging, flashlight clicking or emote spamming, stuff intentionally trying to annoy you
---
Damnnnn
---
I don't understand that, it's absolutely hilarious when I see it happen...wish it'd happen to me :(
---
SuitFace
---
Jamie Kennedy's character from the Scream franchise is basically this.
---
Then you‚Äôll just get immersed survivors crouch walking around the map for 30 minutes and making it so the killer can‚Äôt end the match. No thank you.
---
I made it for class. My first project was ruined by shitty plywood, so I had to start over. Since that was the case, I had like two class periods to make it + outside time, so roughly 8 hours. The biggest caveat was that you couldn‚Äôt use glue or screws; it had to fit together just by slotting. 
---
In the end tho I had a lot of fun and my peers and professor loved it.
---
I did the exactly same thing yesterday while playing a full no mither swf (It worked tho, we all escaped)
---
Dude, that's John Wayne Gacy for sure
---
&gt;You're assuming that a survivor can't run a killer around for a minute or two, which is a completely unjustified assumption on your end. It happens all the time. 
---
Im asuming if you got 3 kills already its safe to assume that you get the kill. + you ignored the fact of the survivor might be injured. One hit, dead. Also this will further encourage the use of insta med kits. Do you honestly want that?
---
&gt;You're basically concern trolling about individual killers. Some killers are stronger. Yeah. That's not a point.
---
Ok first time hearing concern trolling. But its still a point. If you have nurse, you still have chance of not finding the hatch. Now what happens if this mechanic gets implimented and what happens to noed and end game add ons such as Remember me? Not only are you ignoring the endless possiblities of what happens due to this but also ignoring how much more people would use certain killers. You would see even more top tiers.
---
&gt;The idea he pitched also included a killer being able to see where you are every 3/5 seconds so you can't hide. 
---
Okay. So even further killer favored. Terrific.
---
   
---
&gt;Last point I guess, you can make a very good case that a killer can be bad but still 3k. If you are better, you can still easily loop them. You escape, they get their 3k. It isn't one-sided at all. 
---
 You just further addressed the issues. 3-5 sec timer showing survivors. Noed central. Its incredibly one sided and the plan itself is unpolished and currently sounds bad on paper. Alot more thought needs to be put into it.
---
Had to get his kill somehow, poor baby billy. Cut down more trees than survivors with his chainsaw.
---
Not wasted at all. There was 1 gen left, and had been so for a while so I knew I would get Adrenaline soon and going down would be the worst situation possible. So I dropped god, it‚Äôs not near any exit gates and I had to because I tried to rotate away from the first jungle gym to preserve pallets, with Iron Will it would‚Äôve worked. I knew what I was doing buddy lol you don‚Äôt always have to play like a sweaty bitch foh
---
I was simply suggesting that sometimes you get shit teams, in any game, DBD being no different - you just shrug it off and move onto the next one.
---
Neither of the points you brought up affects this.
---
Ohhhhhhh, something humanoid, but something so wrong about them. The survivors would have to give it a real second glance to make sure they weren't running to the next gen with the killer right there with them. I can't think of something that the werewolf would do that isn't super broken, but I love the ideas :o
---
That is why I suggested mori nerfs. There are a plenty of perks to use in the game and if you wouldn't be able to use some of them it won't hurt you much, unless you are nothing without these perks. And if so, then git gud.
---
Ye I know  I was surprised when I saw it
---
Nancy for perks, Steve for the epicness
---
The old hatch mechanic encouraged stand offs and survivors holding the game hostage. That‚Äôs why it was reworked. At least the way it works now, once someone finds the hatch the game can end.
---
no it wouldn‚Äôt have. I would‚Äôve went down and then the last gen would pop and I‚Äôd get proxy camped to death. I had to drop it since I greeded the first jungle gym trying to preserve the pallet, but I didn‚Äôt have Iron Will so she found me still. Use your brain
---
Survivors are designed in a way that they are supposed to be all the same in terms of balance (if you don't take into account size and sound). Gameplay &gt; lore.
---
I honestly think I must watch some other streamer called TrU3Ta1ent because the one I watch is absolutely nothing like the one people in this sub constantly lie/bitch about.
---
I also must watch a completely different Otzdarva to the rest of you. Because while he's generally pretty nice and chill, he also spends a good amount of time each stream "bitching" about survivors.
---
I honestly just don't get why so many in this sub seem to have this huge hateboner for Tru. He's certainly very vocal and brutally honest with his opinions, but I've never seen him get toxic or nasty. Especially not to any degree worth of some of the hate he gets here, a lot of which I've gotta say is just straight up lies.
---
Interesting balance ideas for mories.
---
Not sure about the SWF perk limitations.  It might work with high rank survivors/tourneys.  For a group of low rank survivors this will be very limiting.  Many only have partial builds and this would take away 12 additional perks.  Balancing for the top end isn‚Äôt a good idea imo.  Most swfs are bad/boosted as is.
---
I assume SWF would be forced to do a perk draft before searching?  I also assume This wouldn‚Äôt apply to two swfs in one lobby.
---
for the sake of the game id have it standing on its back legs as some of them do that so it works like a normal killer. it would have very similar abilities and power to demogorgan but its like you said it might not work well
---
You want a good tip to win or have fun? Because if you wanna win at those ranks against those gen rushing teams, you gotta start baiting that you leave the hook and tunnel. That's called proxy camping, it works. But it's boring of course so..you don't really have a solution here, this game is not fun at high ranks
---
‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt meant to be taken seriously‚Äù 
---
Chill the fuck out
---
No it doesnt????
---
As soon as I press play i get an instant match against a swf
---
he sure as heck seems fun, wish i could use his addons and perks tho :(
---
Isn't Spirit basically The Ring + The Grudge anyway though?
---
As a long time Team Fortress 2 player, i can say that you guys are rookies.
---
That's fine. I'm not saying the hatch should be removed. The thing I dislike is that the hatch is open regardless of the finished generators.
---
It opens after the hook symbol disappears and there is a skull on every survivor except the last
---
Why would I pay when 5 days ago I should of had it for free
---
Don't agree - offer your way to fix obviously OP SWFs. 
---
Mine playstyle is fine, unless I have to deal with sweaty swfs which are abusing 4x4 same perks on a default killer without strong addons. I have to take spirit or nurse to stand any chance against that imbalanced shit. Guess what I hear when I beat them? Spirit/Nurse is frustrating to play against. So as SWFs are
---
Still looking for Chucky myself, would be fun to watch him drag someone by the hair over toward the hook
---
I never said buy it, I said you can still get it. Stop being a 3Head
---
Okay when i get some free time ill work on it
---
His issue is mostly to do with ranking as you struggle to rank up if they get the hatch. Which means you need to slug which is an unenjoyable way of having to play.
---
Its 3 farthest gens. So it would be 3 gens for 8
---
i dont think youll get sympathy when you use prayer beads. all power to you but the addon is unfair and playing against it is a nightmare. their dcs are understandable
---
I feel in situations like these we should cooperate together to mƒÖkƒô BHVR feel like we disaprove - not make jokes about this
---
This only gets them an open hand to make more shitty stuff like these
---
I prefer playing as girl characters because I feel like it's easier to hide, so my vote is Nancy
---
Most of the time he has decent ideas but his clickbait titles is what makes this sub meme him so much.
---
I want jack torrance!
---
Survivors 90% of the survivors play the game as solo Also survivors if you delete swf this game is dead
---
Pennywise is just too cartoony and stereotypical clownlike and not nearly as creepy and real as the clown.
---
Pinhead and the ring girl are more original and creepy. Would be happier seeing them tbh.
---
I‚Äôm gonna be completely honest I woke up and only saw the image
---
I spent time making a wheel with an app, it's actually rly good, but I'll still check this link
---
So you woke up and rather than taking 2 seconds to read a title, you wrote a book confessing your love for tru3? Makes sense
---
I got a crush on the ring Bitch and the grudge Bitch
---
I‚Äôm on mobile I only saw the image then I commented and got ready for the say
---
You could say the same thing about Pennywise
---
I appreciate your honesty lol
---
Not love but gratitude and thankfulness
---
Had the same spot yesterday
---
You dropped this ü§°
---
It is?
---
Literally just a Demogorgon skin that replaces the upside down portals with vents.
---
No it isn't safe to assume that, that's the problem. The current system either fucks the killer, or the survivor if the killer finds the hatch immediately and you get a bad door spawn. No middle ground .
---
NOED only activates when the exit gates are powered. If the exit gates aren't powered, NOED doesn't help. This also ignores the fact that most high rank killers don't use NOED because it's a waste of a perk slot. You're basically assuming people are going to stop using strong builds which put them in game-winning positions in the first place, to take some shit perk like Blood Warden or Remember Me in the chance of this endgame thing. If you tailor your build completely to endgame, you won't ever make it there vs good survs; you need perks that help in the early and midgame like Ruin, Enduring, Thanatophobia, etc.
---
It doesn't MATTER if the killer knows where you are if they can't catch you because you're looping them. You wouldn't have to open the gates, it makes more sense for them to open automatically or you just winning outright. 
---
So. No NOED central. Survivor auras don't really matter. You're just striking me as someone who wants to find excuses to hate this without really thinking about it.
---
They just don‚Äôt use Reddit and worse there is a language barrier so all we can do is plead and make jokes
---
Ded ard
---
So I‚Äôm in the wrong for doing this to a group that harassed me in my messages? Don‚Äôt you have a brain?
---
YouTube Demonetisation can be the killer.
---
that would be super cool but I highly doubt that would happen all things considered, unless MAYBE they partnered with crypt tv or whatever it is to be for the episode he was in.
---
‚ÄúThe spooky bitch from the ring‚Äù
---
P3 Nancy because her white shirt is really easy to see and the blood on it might help.
---
I feel like the offering should allow to use the perks you have
---
Remove collision.
---
Exactly.  Pennywise could be like a shapeshifting killer. 
---
No innate power, but can pick up limited uses of other killers powers around the map. 
---
Or mix something like Doctor and Myers. Drive people mad and expose them.
---
I don‚Äôt know maybe because after one bad game he chills out and has a fun stream with his girlfriend sometimes dropping by
---
Imagine if it was Haunted Ground.
---
Like you protect it like there's no tomorrow so the survivor thinks that it's ruin and they they cleanse it and they're like FUCK.
---
(Assuming you have both Haunted Ground and Ruin and this one isn't ruin of course)
---
Probably the most accurate statement here about him. Also misattributes his own shortcomings to a build being bad
---
I dunno why we comparing items to blood points perks. Both killer and survivor can chose to not use ad-ons. Wglf does nothing for you besides the blood points while BBQ gives a very good aura reading power. If I were to change it would make it so it does something to actually help you in a match instead of playing with 3 perks. Like rescuing off hook is a bit faster or while someone is hooked everyone can see your aura kinda like reversed kindred.
---
The fun part of this is grievous dies in this fight anyway.
---
It seemed to have worked based on his comments.
---
This wouldn't apply to different SWFs.
---
Game should be balanced around strong players, not weak ones, so they will have motivation to get better. But sorry, I'm forgetting that DbD is going the other way
---
j- F
---
&gt;NOED only activates when the exit gates are powered. If the exit gates aren't powered, NOED doesn't help. 
---
Chase a survivor for 2 minutes, wait until noed is ready, boom. Dead. Well done. Its still an issue. 
---
&gt;It doesn't MATTER if the killer knows where you are if they can't catch you because you're looping them.
---
*sweats profusely when a nurse is chasing you with noed*
---
&gt;You're just striking me as someone who wants to find excuses to hate this without really thinking about it.
---
Im just trying thinking this realisticly and i find it a half assed plan with not much thought behind it.
---
&gt;If you tailor your build completely to endgame, you won't ever make it there vs good survs; you need perks that help in the early and midgame like Ruin, Enduring, Thanatophobia, etc.
---
Incorrect if you play well enough. Can say from experience.
---
I‚Äôve heard there are more killer dailies.  My tin foil hat tells me they encourage people to try both sides.  I was a hard survivor main.  Killer dailies eventually turned me into a killer main.  (It took a long while)
---
Lmao
---
Guy, you can't expect your opinion to be respected if you insult those you are trying to talk to
---
I mean billy is definitely loopable if you understand how high rank Billy's play
---
Yo! ... just imagine it, they make him actually shorter with a lower perspective but still just as fast as a regular sized killer; then have some really freaky speed run ability be part of his power. That would cause some serious cardiac problems in some folk, I think. üòÜüòÜüò≥
---
Because time has passed and people have learnt how to play her effectively with collisions.  
---
It's not really fun to play against an invisible killer, people hated freddy even before the rework, even though he was the weakest of all.
---
Kinda the same with Spirit, but she's strong so it's double annoying. If you get hit, she'll phase and reappear right next to you.  
---
Add stridor that now nullifies iron will for the complete package. 
---
Imo she would be fine in her current state if devs reverted the change on her phasing sound that happened a few weeks after the release.
---
"playing without any mistakes" and "the last survivor escapes" is a big contradiction
---
If most killers played stragetcally and stopped Just trying to be these unstopable killing machines, the hatch woundn't be such big of a deal
---
Cause If you kill the 3rd survivor without worrying about the last, that's on you
---
It does for me. It takes me ages to get a match as killer
---
Just lobby dodge if it‚Äôs that bad, also I think your swf would kind of ruin the fun
---
Yep, especially without Borrowed
---
I love his videos but, boy, this one likes bitching.
---
Can we like... Back the fuck off Tru3 for like one week please? Christ, some of you have one punching bag and it shows. I would say there are other streamers you could meme, but even then, my kind nature would STILL kick in and tell you all to stop. We get it. It can be funny to make these kinds of memes and Tru3 himself has said on some instances they are harmless and even funny. But some of you just take it WAAAAAY too fucking far and instead of peeing in the pool, you take a big old fat shit.   
---
I'm not having a go at the post. More so the people in the comments. (You know damn well who you are) Find a hobby or do something productive. Cause now its getting old.
---
I get that spirit strong and I'm fine with killers being able to be strong, but spirit doesn't let you PLAY THE GAME as a survivor. What's the fun in a guessing game and being hit by something you literally can't see and there's nothing you could possibly deal with using your skill? Billy, Nurse and Freddy are strong and I have no issues playing against any of them, Spirit is just bullshit. I don't dc tho, but I really do hate her guts
---
That type of dailes make most players to spend 2 hours per 3 days. If players play they might buy dlc or skins and thats how many games pay for themselfs. Just gotta roll with it. And if your connection is that bad try to use ethernet cable or change your net provisor
---
Where's this from lmao
---
Gen-genocide build with no PGTW. 
---
Ok.
---
do it
---
How about when 1 survivor remains a 5min EG timer starts, and they need to do 1gen for hatch to spawn or power doors?
---
My advice is: don't craft sharp objects that could kill people or which you can use to hang people from.
---
Even though it looks great, if the police asks you why you have it, and you point at the game, they Might think you use the game as inspiration to kill.
---
Y'know with the media and "GaMeS cAuSe ViOlEnCe" stuff going on kek.
---
But looks cool
---
Entitled for the 4k sums it up pretty much. A shame that he thinks this way, hes normally a really good teacher actually.
---
You could do that if you didn't want to clutch ruin
---
*‚Äùyeh, yeh its defanutleh a survav wiv frends‚Äù*
---
*match ends tow left to die on hooks one takes hatch, names all different languages*
---
awsome, it will be perfect if chucky becomes a killer
---
Human centipede as a survivor
---
r/engrish
---
I used to watch him all the time. Now I can't stand him. All he does is complain and bitch about the most arbitrary things.
---
You're right but you don't have to be a dick about it
---
This is golden!
---
I want Kayako. Imagine her hair as a teleport ability but you'd be able to move through dark corners of the map or tall grass. 
---
Just tendrils of hair coming out of nowhere to form a killer that sneak attacks that blending Claudette.
---
I want john wick
---
He just doesnt seem to actually have fun anymore. I wouldnt be too surprised if it was a ‚Äúi hate this game but its the only thing that gets me views‚Äù like tyde.
---
Look out Chucky!
---
What would her power be?  Teleporting between TVs placed in the game world?  We already have enough teleporting killers, but I don't know how else you could keep her iconic enough otherwise.
---
I want Jack Torrence.
---
Respect for being self-aware of your own actions.
---
Eh, the title of the post is a cop out to avoid criticism. Other posts in this make serious comments that agree with the meme, but as soon as somebody criticizes the point the meme makes: "It'S nOT SuppOsED To bE srS gUyS!"
---
Triple the time on PS4 for me at least. Over 5 minute queue times.
---
I 100% agree. or maybe once when the timer starts and once at 30 seconds. the three seconds seems a bit excessive unless like, every pallet came back but that‚Äôd just suck for killer. it‚Äôs a touchy middle ground
---
Spireh
---
With him we could finally get James A. Janisse
---
So, you start a match and 3 DCs, what do you do? Gens?
---
My build would be:
---
-Ruin
---
-Corrupt Intervention-
---
-PGTW
---
-Discordance
---
It'd be important that the killer is mobile, like Hillbilly or Freddy to disrupt generator repairs.
---
I like surge, but it is very map dependent and can do nothing.
---
Dark Devotion? OK, I'm going to need you to clarify why I would equip this terrible joke of a perk.
---
Oooh I never get a chance to meet zero terror radius Myers with a chainsaw, nowthis is my chance!
---
If the police arrive - that's your cue to quickly make for the hatch you've also crafted to escape hassle free!
---
Oh yes. Do bones while being chaced by the killer :) the killer will wait to restart the chace after Ur done.
---
Clown only suffers with map pressure but is incredible in chase. The two things you can do to make clown a frightening killer is use perks to help his cons, or use perks to improve his pros. Either one works
---
I agree, Surge isn't always practical but it's satisfying for me
---
I would love James as a survivor  definetly would be my main
---
Guess we should play Civilization until the event...
---
Can we get Jack Torrance from the shining? Or at least the bad guys from Dr Sleep? I'd main that shit hard
---
Just a normal day in dbd
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. Like I mori someone, tunnel, camp. You‚Äôll never see a smile on my face. It kills me inside to play like that. But I genuinely have no choice. I just wanna play the game normally but with the rank systems all fucked up, combined w me getting gen rushed outta my ass..I‚Äôm left w no choice.
---
I want to see Pumpkinhead as a killer one of these years.
---
Is this an actual quote?
---
I find that hard to believe
---
He‚Äôs not gonna shag you mate, neither is true. Stop being so mad over a comment
---
How fair is it that the game‚Äôs matchmaking is so shit I get put with low ranks, and the killer stompes them into the ground and now I have to try to do 5 gens while they farm each other to death and now the killer can just tunnel me for the ez 4k?
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand the point of slugging, he‚Äôs leaving them on the ground to go and find me. So he‚Äôs gonna check generators and find me and then kill me, so therefore I‚Äôm going to rescue my team and have more players for him to hunt down while I can then work on gens feeling somewhat confident that I can get this done faster with my other teammate(s)
---
This is a joke right?
---
I agree with you. I just want to say that survivor piping is very hard too. With killer its much more *difficult* since you rely on the survivors skill to get your pips and you must do a lot more to get your pips. But with survivors its much *harder* because you need to rely on your teamates so you can get an unhook or heal and every one is try to get heals or get chased or cleanse the totems, its lickly that a survivor literally didn'thave the chance to pip. 
---
I use the term difficult and hard respectivly because even though its hard to pip as both high rank killer and survivor, they're difficult for different reasons.
---
Viable killeh
---
is it really a reverse bear trap? I mean its not even really a trap. Its not something you don't notice and fall into. Reverse JawBreaker.
---
Yea it SArcAsm
---
Im not saying make a build all around noed. You are being ignorant. Im saying people will run it more often than they already do. You are ignoring my message completely. Why?
---
[I want Gingersnaps](https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/may-11-01-ginger-and-brigette-are-sisters-sworn-to-stick-to.jpeg)
---
Surprisingly it does.
---
prestige
---
It's probably the prestige symbol. I, II or III.
---
It doesn‚Äôt activate because it would be op against stealth killers
---
That‚Äôs like saying, ‚ÄúMy team didn‚Äôt do any gens but we should get to escape regardless.‚Äù Playing survivor is a team effort. If your team didn‚Äôt do bones then everyone will be punished.
---
Wraith‚Äôs a boomer confirmed
---
I see your point but I still prefer billy because of what I said, I can see him, I can potentially outplay a chase without having to rely on a 50/50 chance of her choosing the wrong pallet side, iron will or Spirit being bad. Don't even get me started on her having collision and getting free hits because she just happened to bump into someone who can't see where she is.
---
Lvl 50+
---
What killer rank do you play at?
---
Because people are better with her and Nurse is about to get nerfed, so she's the most op killer now. A decent Spirit with good perks and add-ons is not too fun to play against. There's no looping, just lucky guessing things, and that if she can't hear you in pain. If the player has good headphones, you're done.
---
Weren‚Äôt you the guy insulting and getting mad at someone for taking a meme seriously?
---
Also by your very aggressive response I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre the angry one here buddy
---
Would andy be the adult version
---
The Entity always tampers with the Killers abilities. Giving Chucky the strength to throw someomw up there isn't a stretch. Or they could just have the hook lower for him then rise back up
---
Not really, because the game doesn't give you the tools to keep two survivors busy at once. I mean, if you see them both you can hit one and then chase the other one. That's what I usually do. But if that surv already hides somewhere you barely have a chance to spot him. Just aborting the chase and look for the other one just results in him healing up, so you're right where you started.
---
It's so... exposed. Dirty
---
One word. **Totoro**
---
Of course
---
What makes you think its a good decision from a buisness standpoint to delay an event after the season of the event,piss off your whole community and make yourself appear incompetent, just to publish it when the hype for the own and similar events died down?
---
He's already in the game... just look at Ace's Moonrise event skin from last year.
---
Oh oh! I have seen you while playing ~~~
---
I just really enjoy spam crouching with the other survivors in the exits as Ghostface, even if it probably means I'm gonna get an "entity displeased" it's (imo) a lot of fun to just have a moment with the survivors, especially when the survivors realize I'm not trying to kill them and join in on the spam crouching. Its a nice reminder for me (and hopefully the survivors ) that not everyone has to be super toxic when playing
---
I told him to chill out, how angry and aggressive of me. Okay buddy
---
Slugging works if you got some perks that block aura reading, which you usually don't run as killer. If not, that survivor is up to full within 30 seconds. Also, you got a hard time finding the survivor yourself unless you run deerstalker or stridor, and nobody runs those.
---
Kayako has a sister too, Kanoo-oh
---
As you clearly read the team didn't get punished lol the survivor being tunneled was. Relying on survivors lack of communication to win is just cheap and why there are more swf lately since playing solo is unbearable thanks to things out of your control since Ur being tunneled.
---
Bruh, xenomorph can see you behind walls.
---
Why didn‚Äôt they make Laurie look anything like JLC?
---
JLC is an icon. She‚Äôs the first scream queen. We all know what she looks like, she‚Äôs extremely famous. They nailed Steve and did pretty good with Nancy, why couldn‚Äôt they at least attempt a good Laurie?
---
And it‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt have the capability. You can see in this image they clearly do. 
---
It frustrates me. I love Laurie :(
---
Get to rank 1 and ur thought will change quickly it just getting dead by add ons
---
Safe Hook rescues are usually not given to BT since you have to use it within 32m or less of the killer. I will admit the change for it to activate while healthy was BS. I think it should charge from hook saves, but otherwise function the same to insta-downs and M2s don't get blocked.
---
Seriously can we please remove Spirit's collision during phasing? You shouldn't be rewarded for accidentally bumping into a Survivor.
---
For those who haven't watched Tru3, what's his ghostface build?
---
Bloody rage seem like Bitter Murmur but stronger.
---
Not even including HL. Makes hard skill checks so much harder.
---
Takes the DC into account and rewards the survivor bonus points that way they have a chance.
---
Finger lickin‚Äô good.
---
The fact you get so mad over being critiqued just tells me i'm right. If you knew how to loop shack and know how to use the so called "bugged dead hard" you would easily have looped him and gotten adrenaline, which would have allowed you to run to another loop making it even stronger.
---
I didnt even know you could spawn that close to it. Thst was also a quick hit by the killer wtf? 5 seconds into the match and he got a hit.
---
How about if they get affected and are near another survivor, penny wise is able to teleport near them. This prevents survivors from helping each other. Or they start seeing penny wise in the corner of their eyes.
---
His idea was pretty cool, but it would work better if it was applied for when the hatch gets closed by the killer, and not to remove the hatch altogether.
---
Lol.
---
"yea if killers would just stop trying to kill all the survivors it wouldn't be the that big of a deal"
---
Maybe if they read it enough times something might change, till then I am not gonna play it as much.
---
I use Lightweight, Fixated/Urban Evasion (or both sometimes) with Iron Will and Spine Chill as P3 Claudette. Those killers never see me when I go Blendette mid chase
---
Yeah that's more balanced than crossplay with pc...
---
Thanks for the info mate, if it works it's very helpful.
---
Jesus why did you get downvoted so hard for such a good point lol
---
This comment is seriously embarrassing for you and you don‚Äôt even realize it
---
wait..
---
the order influences the charges too???
---
Someone else mentioned that pennywise's weakness is teamwork, so I am trying to balance it out to where teamwork defeats the survivors.
---
All those nerfs and changes arent specifically targeting people's ability to play and enjoy the game together they are mechanical changes. I can guarantee at least my group of friends would stop playing if this happened.
---
So many quality of life updates can be done, that they will earn them more money than releasing skins but they can't understand.
---
Also a sister called Nayako in The Grudge 3
---
Yeah idk how it became bugged after working fine for years
---
Then maybe it has to do with the fact I'm only a rank 9 survivor?
---
I like to play as both but I'm a survivor man and have always been. Got the rank 1 survivors achievement. I'm going to struggle to reach rank 1 as killer. SWF is really strong against unexperienced or regular killers. A full coordenated squad using comms can make all the difference. I have anxiety and even when I'm winning I get shakes and palpitations. I have a hard time playing killer. It's cool and all to satisfy your blood lust (although I can be a mercyful killer sometimes) but I prefer to SWF.
---
Who? What?
---
How did you get THIS from "playing strategically"?
---
I'm a red rank killer and I only win when I tryhatd and use rare add ons if I'm lucky enough and they dont DC or kill themselves on the first hook.  Gens go down so quickly! I can't even try to play it casually since they gen rush and use insta heals these days :(
---
He always shows analytical evidence whenever he has an idea
---
Someone got basement camped by an insidious bubba
---
And the other 2 came after other tru3 stans such as yourself started crying at the fact I told him the post wasn‚Äôt meant to be taken seriously, it‚Äôs really not that deep mate
---
You keep white knighting and licking rim for some precious internet points tho, whatever keeps you happy

I‚Äôm not listeninggggggg
---
We need something that hurts or weakens pennywise if 2 or more survivors are together. His ability works best if a survivor is by themselves.  while his ability is most weak when all 4 survivors are together.
---
How many people were hooked? Let's find out!
---
I'll give the golden chainsaw to Billy, and the dull machete to Trapper
---
Thanks.
---
You really can't discuss with people huh, it's sad you can't talk with people without attacking them üòè I guess I can't expect much more from you, right?
---
Are you on PC? I'm a green rank killer and I find matches in like less than 3 minutes. Can't say the same for survivor.
---
Look at that smile, that's the smile of man who wants to drop pallets on a serial killers head.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
This happened to me once as a killer, haven't touched the game since then
---
Thats actually one of the better spawns. Just lucky that you spawned in that corner yourself too. Had a horror game where we didnt find the totem for 10 minutes and it was in that location, since then checking all the corners is the first thing i do on that map.  
---
Sometimes it spawns completely uncovered, or right next to a gen. They could fix those very easily, like a min distance to gens and make sure that its surrounded to at least 180¬∞ by something.
---
The entity musta dropped it on his way to place it by that gen over there.
---
*Shit, they've already been loading for 12 minutes, I'll just roll with it*
---
Payday 2 got Ethan and Hila.
---
The image of Amanda threw me off. Not gunna lie.
---
To be fair thats only one of them that are higher rank than you and the perks he is using are not very strong.
---
If you're using the piece you'll exit t3 even when you have it infinitely and you won't get it again.  If you're doin the 4 mori build use the tombstone.
---
For standard gameplay though,  the piece is far better
---
Making survivors drop pallets ain't quite "incredible chase".
---
I'd say it's more childish of you to refuse looking at their arguments and trying to understand why people dont really like tru3
---
 Well that ain't happened yet. And i've been dealing with this game breaking OoO shit since June, as a Ghostface -  5 months in a row, Karl !!!! They couldn't fix it in 5 months.
---
 I don't even mention those Wraith/Pig mains, who had expirienced it since OoO came out.
---
And what point exactly do I need to prove? That you can move on with your life even though the event being delayed sucks?
---
Yeah dude, it's called not being mentally ill. You should check it out some time
---
He's referencing all the shitty comments aimed at the guy, not the post.
---
Spirit is really fun and quite unique. You will have to think every time you use her power. You will see a lot of dcs.
---
Plague is also really fun and unique. Her ranged attacked forces survivors to choose how they die and destroys uncoordinated teams.
---
You are very tall and easy to loop without corrupt purge, survivors will deny you your corrupt purge.
---
Both have really good perks.
---
We still want McCote Dwight though
---
‚ÄúRelying on survivors lack of communication to win is just cheap‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs literally what the game is??
---
I think the way to see survivor during that would be just giving him 3 crows.
---
Legion could definantly use a change like this as right now their power is quite underwhelming in my opinion. I like this idea quite a bit.
---
Maybe something similar to Billy? They can get down on all fours and sprint in a straight line? 
---
Or a skill "Full Moon" or smth they can activate that lets them expose the next survivor they down?
---
Yes this is what I need please BHVR
---
it normal when you play a killer
---
I was the rank 7 survivor not the killer
---
I wasn't the killer in that game I was the rank 7
---
Again, why are you so angry and can attack only me and not my argument? You might have some anger issues
---
You should chill out and not being so aggressive. It's not my fault you haven't made a point yet but just insult me
---
We need a better balance department1 Also bugfree and better timed events, but just me talking her so .... yeah priorities i guess.
---
 I hate everyone saying Ivory should be changed into being 100% useless like after 2 hooks are you kidding me???? That would make it so useless it wouldn‚Äôt even be funny
---
I went against a killer with trash connection and he was glitching around. when I asked why his internet so bad he said that it was my internet but my friend also seen the killer glitching around like crazy and the killer wouldn't admit to his trash internet
---
I want chucky lmao. Imagine working on a generator and this little goblin comes flying towards you
---
I completely forgot that NOED speeds you up. I use it and completely forgot about that.
---
I like my Wraith end game build with Fire Up, NOED, and Blood Warden. I switch things in and out with the other perk slot.
---
The best thing is when you spawn as killer and b-line straight towards the totem but it still breaks before you can reach it .
---
&gt;he's a very controversial streamer
---
I honestly can't see how anyone could consider him controversial.
---
You deserved to get downed for using the shack like this
---
You get more bloodpoints by killing everyone and double pip if you get merciless. There are 2 reason why you would want merciless. 1st reason is that you want adept. Its really frustrating when the last dude just finds the hatch and you have to try all over again. 2nd reason is if you want to reach higher ranks. There is nothing wrong with that. Maybe you want the achievement or you just want to play at red ranks. 1 game with merciless is worth 2 games with brutal. Its kinda bullshit that you can be denied of that just by luck.
---
From what I‚Äôve tried there is no platform sync on accounts and no cannibal on switch, but bbq is a basic perk unless it changed recently.
---
Yes. Prestige is NOT worth doing if you just want to play. Of you really like the character and want the cosmetics, sure go ahead.
---
Because if the hatch does not spawn, the survivor just hides.
---
The only thing I honestly really hate about True is that people will donate money for a build, but he said himself that he doesn‚Äôt have to play to the strengths of the build. Then, what the fuck is the point?? If you don‚Äôt play how you‚Äôre supposed to play, then the build won‚Äôt work! For example, if you give him a PWF and STBFL build, he‚Äôll never ignore the obsession and just keep downing them like normal, completely invalidating two perks in the build all game. I get you‚Äôre competitive but c‚Äômon try something different for once. He always plays the same, same perks, same shit day in day out but never wants to try new tricks in different builds. As a matter of fact, he‚Äôll always over-mindgame himself constantly, and many times will keep trying to mindgame someone who is clearly not getting tricked. His doctor ‚Äúshock‚Äù strategy is absolutely a waste of time, and many times the survivor slaps a pallet in his mouth by the time he catches up. They usually get two or three free loops anyway! 
---
Sorry rant over, lol
---
Oh my god I forgot how much endless shits thrown at Tru3 seriously he makes a suggestion that would benefit both sides and he gees the entire fucking survivor community in this games wrath
---
Yikes.
---
IMO they could simply have a 1-2 min period at the start of the game when totems are not lit up.
---
That way you can still spawn near a totem, but you need to take a gamble of whether clearing it is worth it or not. Might pay off, might lose you time if it's a dull totem though.
---
Also makes coordinating stuff like Haunted Grounds tougher as the SWF cannot just call out "hey there are 2 lit up totems probably Haunted Grounds". And you cannot just run past a lit up totem and call out its location for your team if running SWF. 
---
After those 1-2 mins hex totems light up normally and counterplay is easier, but the killer gets a bit more breathing room at the start of the game.
---
I mean Trapper is already a feast or famine killer, either he works... or he doesn't. But as you said it might be the survivors I get, I'm not one to claim that I go against hardcore, instaheal, all on comms, legendary top 100% players all the time *ahem* Tru3. But in the higher ranks you pretty much start of on your backfoot and the moment you control the game as killer you win, so in that aspect I can kinda agree. If it's okay I would leave it at that since I feel this discussion would take ages to describe accurately.
---
So the game is supposed to be about team work but it's also supposed to be about lack of communication? Well keep your thoughts and il keep mine I'm about done here. Just don't be surprised when your noed doesn't carry you on swf.
---
Sounds like you need some doom to play for a bit and give dbd a lil break.
---
Salty of small things? YOU MEAN THIS ENTIRE FUCKING COMMUNITY
---
When you think about it, some DLC directly affect bloodwebs. Think about it;when you get a killer, you can‚Äôt get their respective splinter anymore (unless a bug like that happens). That makes more room for things like, say, an ebony mori. Or maybe an iridescent add-on.
---
I feel like it's only a matter of time before survivors just wait out the Corrupt Intervention by hiding though, there's nothing stopping them from doing so after all.
---
The entity is high again
---
r u a hacker br0
---
The guy playing the hatch fucking nails it ! Color me surprised !
---
6*9 meters terror radius?
---
I dunno man
---
What are the chances that wasting the killer shack pallet actually works?
---
But wouldn't that just be half the fun?
---
This is true, but it still would mean they have made zero gen progress for 2 minutes, which in most instances makes it more effective than a ruin totem.
---
El chupacabras
---
Had that happen to me too, except it turned into noed about halfway
---
Of course it‚Äôs taken seriously its a post shitting on someone it‚Äôs always taken seriously not matter how much the person posting it try‚Äôs to say ‚ÄúoHhhH no this isn‚Äôt supposed to be taken seriously guys‚Äù even though they know godamn well what will happen because IT HAPPENS EVERY TIME

My Ass waiting for original killers: ü§°

I know, I could never get that square even if I tried! That's dedication right there.
---
Halloween is in 3 days
---
Penny wise is a bad idea we literally have a clown already
---
True, assuming of course you find any of them, it's much harder if they're not doing gens.
---
Yup. % and efficiency add-ons work on charges to the left
---
when i play as spirit, if its too easy catching and hooking survivors i let themheal up and do a couple gens to keep the game going so everyone gets more bloodpoints, how ever if its a very experianced team then they are all fair game
---
Or a killer wich can disguise as a tea-bagging claudette morel
---
Jaj
---
It‚Äôs not
---
I had some dude ask me my opinion on sex toys. No one else. Just me, the only woman in the party.
---
What‚Äôs your gamertag? I primarily play killer, but I still play a decent amount of survivor.
---
I had a game today where Ruin spawned right next to the gen in the middle of the cornfield on Thompson house. Just stone cold middle of the map few meters next to a gen AND hook. 
---
Managed to hold it pretty long only because I had Haunted Grounds and they spawned next to a Haunted one cleansing it right away, plus I put a portal next to the Ruin as Demo....but even then the spawn is just ridiculous. Right next to the middle gen in the middle of the field.
---
I like both OhTofu and Otz but to be fair Otz can also be extremely biased. I heard him saying the other day that exit gates should regress so people can't 99% them (for example). He also started complaining to the survivors in chat the other day on a game he lost because they bought toolboxes and he lost. He was playing wraith with the worst perks and zero slowdowns and started saying they played unfair by taking toolboxes. These are the two most recent examples but he is definitely slightly "killer main biased" and also doesn't consider solo players. Otz opinion is important/ worries me more because people take it as gospel recently.
---
I honestly think there should be a shift away from licensed killers. We have all but one of the classic horror movie slashers and the lore behind Demo is already on shaky ground because most of the potential killers aren't exactly designed for a concept like DBD. I know it's not a popular opinion and I know they bring in more players but licensed killers just aren't interesting and are all vaguely disappointing to me because I want a character I can really get into.
---
Yet every ass Clown is taking it seriously and circle jerking about ho much they hate Tru3 seriously the person posts a meme shitting on Tru3 on the DBD subreddit a sub Reddit of one of the most toxic games ever and then says ‚Äúoh no guys don‚Äôt take this seriously‚Äù he knew damn well people were gonna start shitting on Tru3 BECAUSE THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME
---
All good or meta perks are "make me run fast" or "let me dodge/endure attacks". Naive devs think that survivors are still interested in avoiding killer or finding items. Even quick healing isn't so popular (except maybe "finish the last gen to heal everyone on the map" one). I mean, as it's right now, new perks must be VERY STRONG to compete with meta perks, because meta perks are very-very impactful, have no restrictions and very little downsides.
---
&gt;Heard enough of that to believe it‚Äôs all bullshit. You remind me of that Dwight wearing the trapper mask meme that says ‚ÄúKiLlEr MaIn BtW‚Äù
---
Again. More people play both than play one. Sorry being in your little 'KiLLeR MAiN' bubble stops you from seeing that. How can you go on about balance when you only play one side. Pathetic mate. You just assume everyone is survivors or killers and constantly fighting.
---
You really shouldn't be using ruin at high ranks. Not many do. The complaints come from lower rank survivors. In my experience high rank killers tend to use more creative combinations.. And again you are completely deviating from the original topic.
---
&gt;And what I‚Äôm saying is that if survivors aren‚Äôt item reliant to be red rank viable, killers should not be addon reliant to be red rank viable.
---
Again this is irrelevant. I was talking about 'not removing all items from the game' which you were so keen to promote doing. You can't just change the subject of conversation to suit something slightly more viable.
---
&gt;You clearly ignore that.
---
Keep evading bro.
---
&gt;it‚Äôs okay Bucko you‚Äôll understand when ur older
---
No. This is not what I was implying. I was saying, Yes I agree, it isn't fun when you are being looped on these god loops. But that is how you deal with it. Don't like it? You do you, keep getting pissed off, not my problem.
---
&gt;bc you clearly don‚Äôt understand why map structure is bullshit
---
You are pretty much agreeing with me on most of this paragraph. But you have proven you are just an angry child who doesn't care for a reasonable conversation and just wants to go 'HurrDurr You Survivor. Your stuff good. Me killer. my stuff bad." All I said was loops shouldn't be so much of a focus for fundamentals. Changes like that would reduce the reliance on them.
---
&gt;Balancing the game isn‚Äôt a penance process. Killers have it easy at low ranks bc the entry barrier for survivors is only marginally higher than it is for killers. Except the risk/reward benefit for survivors is far far more malapportioned than it is for killers. Survivor is way WAY easier than killer when you understand the fundamentals of the game.
---
Wtf did you think I said? I said killers are easier to play at lower ranks and more stressful at higher ranks. Wtf is your problem kid. I never made any assumptions on why that is. I suggest you reread my replies then realise how much of an asshat you sound like.
---
&gt;That does not mean by some cosmic logic, killers need to be stripped of their power in high ranks. High rank players don‚Äôt control low rank players, they shouldn‚Äôt have to pay the price for their stupidity.
---
I never said they did...
---
&gt;Only thing ur here doing is arguing that killers should suffer in high ranks bc they do fine in low ranks,
---
Please quote me to when I said that. I said that the balance kicks in somewhere. And you tend to have fun in between the game being easy and the game being difficult. 
---
All I said is that I welcome more items and variation because it is a fun element of the game. I said that it is better to balance things than just remove them completely - which is what you were trying to justify.
---
I haven't seen you make one serious point on the basis of the actual discussion. Which was you claiming all items should be removed from the game.
---
It has become clear you are just full of shit and projecting other arguments that you clearly feel quite strongly about onto anyone who disagrees with you... because you seem to view this as a Survivor vs Killer thing, and it is all survivors mains vs all killers mains - so it is irrelevant what we are actually talking about.
---
So before you start spewing more irrelevant shit - please reread everything objectively.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what it seems to be to me. If there was supposed to be communication between the survivors, wouldn‚Äôt there be voice chat?
---
Or Clown's Solvent Jug, be his best addon.
---
What about endgame activating? Think of it being closed. Now with everything that happens it might be better to increase the timer if that‚Äôs the case but other than that I can‚Äôt really think of alternatives.
---
Even though his idea is great because it makes sure the person who escapes is at least semi decent at the game and also gets rid of camping hatch and hiding to find hatch instead of unhooking and also doesn‚Äôt reward people for not going anything the whole game and hiding
---
Can we get more dbd memes that are formatted like modern meme culture such as this one?
---
It's great on killers like Trapper or Demo that can then easily set up their powers on the gens close to you. 
---
Corrupt has some downsides too though, bad RNG can give you terrible lategame gen position if those corrupted gens are far apart, and depending on the spawns survivors can sometimes walk over to a gen and do it quickly anyway. 
---
Ruin is more risk reward, but even if it gets fucked in the first minutes that is still one less survivors rushing a gen at the start of the game. The only truly useless Ruins are those that literally spawn next to a survivor, which sadly happens sometimes.

Survivors leave behind a blood vapor trail behind them for a couple seconds but trails behind them the entire game so you can see the absolute most recent whereabout as well as brighten blood to a highly visible degree.
---
Literally my ruin every time
---
Thank you, I'll delete this post
---
Yes lets pair this with Haunted grounds :P
---
Streamers are circle jerking on twitter about Spirit these days so it's the popular thing to do. 
---
It's basically the same as posting about Shirtless Myers on here. It requires zero effort or creativity but you get a horde of people patting you on the back telling you how stunning and brave you are. And if anyone dares criticize you?
---
Throw a pants-shitting tantrum about how DBD is just a game, how you paid for it so you should be able to do what you want, and if anything in DBD isn't fun for even a nanosecond, then really it's your duty to disconnect.  Then step back and await more applause from the peanut gallery.
---
Setting aside your reply here making no sense, yeah you should be embarrassed for writing that self-righteous comment when you didn't even get OP's argument correct. Solos would not be affected at all. They said:
---
&gt; SURVIVORS WITHIN ONE SWF GROUP CANNOT USE SAME PERKS
---
Literally the first thing in the post. All caps and bolded
---
but good job I guess. You have a giant brain.
---
Heavy update when?
---
But that would keep the problem with the hatch the hatch is annoying and it‚Äôs a free escape that if a survivor gets lucky they basically get a free win
---
Assuming that everyone can read your mind from text online when what you replied to is what is implied from your response isn't very smart either. If you're trying to make a different point in response, clarify it.
---
Maybe endgame activates but probably add more (or less) time. Still gives the survivor a chance to escape as if it were a normal game where hatch is closed and you have to get the gate.
---
He does not have a bias toward killer. It's pretty clear that high rank survivors make the game incredibly difficult when they are coordinated. In my opinion the game should be balanced to the top 4% of players. Every time he suggests changes for killers and game balance he takes into account the fun of both sides since he enjoys playing both. It just seems like he is more leaning toward killer buffs because it's just a fact that half the killers can't even be played at rank one due to lack of pressure or mobility.
---
????? So wait he does good and that means that there‚Äôs not to many pallets
---
So basically spirit
---
I disagree. I've started to see people run Corrupt over Ruin, and so far all it's done is make me go "Oh okay, these gens are corrupted so I must be furthest from the Killer.  Now I go over to this gen that isn't corrupted, I know i'm closer to the killer".  Which I then just work on that gen facing the opposite direction of the corrupted gens, see when the killer is coming, and then loop/run as usual - till other survivors finish other gens.  To be honest I find Corrupt being used in a game gives me even more of an advantage than Ruin, simply because it tells me where the killer is from the start of the game and that is a huge advantage.
---
* Images of characters, locations, gameplay elements and the like from other franchises that would make an interesting addition to the game (e.g. Silent Hill, The Evil Within, Child's Play/Chucky, IT, ...). These posts must be submitted as a fan-made concept, including at least two of the following things: character background story, teachable perks, killer power/ability, new unique gameplay mechanic (similar to Jigsaw Boxes, Bear Traps, ...), map concept art/layout/aesthetics.
---
Idk why people use the "wE AlReAdY hAvE a cLoWn" excuse in pennywise's case. He isn't a clown, he's a cosmic entity. He just takes the form of a clown bc alot of people are scared of clowns. Notice how he turns into a giant fuckin crab, or whatever he needs to turn into in order to be scary.
---
What dicklords those guys are. If a survivor does this to me I'll always let them go really.
---
Those are perks, survivor have them too.
---
The hatch is a mechanic that every survivor gets to use, on top of his perks.
---
Also if you suspect bloodwarden keep the gates at 99, or if they are already open leave when the killer picks someone up (unless there is enough time on the meter to sit out bloodwarden).
---
But i'd rather not turn this into a discussion about perks. That's it's own beast in balancing.
---
Holy shit you have some terrible ideas for the game (I've been reading your other posts). 
---
Also your general view point of the game is complete upside down.
---
You want the game to become a hide and seek game, where you think survivors will be scared shaking in fear while hiding in corners, all while the killer brutally stomps through the map looking for them and if he finds them, boom it's over.
---
Well, news flash. This IS NOT a horror game.
---
It's a 'cat after the mouse' chase game with horror elements.
---
Third party communications are very much allowed and not an issue for the game, by far most swf are the easiest to deal with since they actually care about their teammates.
---
No survivor perks currently (except OOO, fuck that perk) are an issue for any killer.
---
In fact, they are all very fair and not that hard to outplay.
---
Exhaustion perks are not safety perks what so ever and aura perks are great. 
---
Also if swf was removed it would greatly hurt the game, if you take away peoples abilities to play with their friends we will have a overflow of killers. Because that where people would go, not into solo ques. 
---
I don't want to come across as a dick, but seriously dude. 
---
You got to either wake up or quit the game, because it does not sound like you're enjoying yourself and it doesn't sound like Dbd is for you.
---
GIVE ME PINHEAD AND/OR CANDYMAN, OR GIVE ME DEATH
---
So basically a mix of plague and demogorgon
---
Holy shit why not just dump more gasoline on the fire at this point because right now everyone‚Äôs fucking shitting on Tru3 holy shit good job stroking the flames buddy old pal
---
What was the point of your comment then? It inherently ascribes a modus operandi to killer mains. Do you also post the same thing when survivors whine? Big doubt that you do.
---
She has among the best looping in the game. The hell is transport? 110 makes up for tp. Counterable is the only weakness you have that is correct. Having survivors crouch everywhere is good. Run whispers over make and bam, game is slow as fuuuuuuuck. While yes traps can be disarmed, you will be alerted to it. Take Ruin off and put Sloppy and BBQ for Nurses (unless you want the BP then run it.) Set up in your area and pressure survivors into the web. Never leave it unless it's the beginning and you need to pressure survivors into it.
---
Hello yeah let‚Äôs just get rid of an ass ton of perk variety that sounds fun
---
Atleast he doesnt have a chainsaw
---
Nobody mind games himself at pallets and kicks gens with &lt;5% progress more than Tru. He‚Äôs good at the game no doubt but I can‚Äôt watch his killer gameplay anymore.
---
why?
---
Me in the back asking for a Gremlins chapter
---
If you can't play without 4 BT maybe you should revisit your playstyle and prioritize doing generators instead of unhooking your friends in the Killer's face causing him to camp and tunnel. See oh, it works both ways.
---
Adept for killers is bullshit and should be reworked, it's too stupidly hard compared to survivors and it makes deranking almost required to make it bearable, which is not good at all. 
---
For the pip situation, it's rare that that last survivor is the deciding factor but sure it can happen and feel frustrating, especially at red ranks where getting double pip is near impossible, I get that, I just think that hatch brings a lot of flavor to the game and this small drawback (again, the last kill is rarely going to be that decisive for the killer, even if it sucks when it is) is not enough to justify deleting or reworking it.
---
What are you even arguing against?
---
No one said anything about swf or every match being good survivors.
---
The guy above me said it's fair to have a hatch mechanic for survivors that get matched with bad teammates, to which i said on the same line of thinking the killer should get a mechanic to help him if he gets matched against 4 godly survivors.
---

Sadako and Kanako were both drawing from the same cultural well, but it's safe to say Rin's inspiration was first and foremost Ring and Ju-on. In the same way Hillbilly is Leatherface, Trapper is Jason, and the Legion are Ghostface.
---
What of your points are you talking about? You haven't made any, meanwhile I have made my point crystal clear multiple times now YOU CAN BE ANNOYED BY THE DELAY AND SIMPLY MOVE ON WITH YOUR DAY. Like the fact that you ask me to "prove" that point shows you're just trying to troll
---
While you have ended the conversation and finding out the he was speaking of Tremors, Dark Devotion is quite good.
---
If you want to counter stealth killers then use kindred
---
Because men are naturally bulky...
---
&gt;If you can't play without 4 BT maybe you should revisit your playstyle and prioritize doing generators instead of unhooking your friends in the Killer's face causing him to camp and tunnel. See oh, it works both ways.
---
"Causing him to camp and tunnel". We can play without BT just fine but every time we do, killers decide to camp at the slightest sign that they are going to lose and we are powerless against someone simply choosing to stay near the hook and going after the injured player. 
---
So no, it doesn't work both ways. Killers don't need anything to camp while survivors need tools to stand a chance against such play style.
---
The Copypasta owner gave the idea free use, I thought.
---
Whoever you enjoy more.
---
Reddit has had a much better suggestion for fixing Legion for a while now: delete Legion.
---
Every survivor aura is revealed for the entire game if they press the run button even once and you gain a 500% movement speed boost when within 1,000 meters of a survivor and you can instantly mori them and uninstall their game when you find them.
---
Can we please get more of the original killers ;_;
---
Or a rework instead
---
If DBD balances itself for the top 4% of players, every other casual survivor will stop playing.
---
And then killer queues will be even worse than they are now (because survivor continues to get nerfed and killer continues to get their hands held.)
---
Quentin should have his own tier like "???"
---
The legions‚Äô power needs a complete rework like Freddy
---
Me: wanting a BHVR original killer because the past 2 killers were liscensed
---
I am a killer main. 90% of my dailies are for killer. By your logic, you are wrong.
---
If you're nothing without NOED then you shouldn't have it.
---
If you add an higher cooldown for her power, or at least its needs to be recharged from the beginning when she used it and I can agree with you.
---
Running faster in Chase would be busteddd
---
I don't watch streamers too often, have watched a bit of Otz and Tru3 and Otz is definitely not at the level of intensity Tru3 is.  Even though I don't watch often, I can't count the number of times I've heard Otz say things along the lines of, "Well, there's a survivor behind that rock cleansing a totem but I'll leave them for now" or "I should do x right now but I'm going to go do y instead"  when x is clearly the right play for ending the game faster.  He's especially nice to people who are clearly over their head at his rank.
---
You'll get used to it
---
You‚Äôre right, the commenter must have small brain
---
Doom had dedicated servers? I thought it was a solo campaign game...
---
Who needs gen control when you can CONTROL THEIR MINDS!!!
---
But...the game is a horror game already, and you play it year round.
---
Not to mention cleansing counts as "injuries healed" and counts against you on plague.
---
When it was in the PTB for the rework you could get tokens for safe unhooks and protection hits. Then at the last min before the patch dropped after the PTB they changed it to protection hits. 
---
BhVR made a statement before the PTB of reworking mettle of man to be protection hits only in order to get it activated and the whole community told them hell no because protection hits have always been broke and don‚Äôt count at times.  So during the PTB they made it safe hooks and protection hits. Then changed it and said it was still to strong and I think they were just listening to the crybaby killers to much and we have this pile of a shit perk. 
---
Many people have posted about this and recently the only thing the devs did was make it where you can use it more than once! Good job BhVR we can use it more than once and requires 6 protection hits and that‚Äôs if you can get them to count. If you‚Äôve ever ran WGLF we all know it doesn‚Äôt count at times. Plus after healing the killer can see your aura and they should have scraped that with the weak state mettle of man is in and pretty much made all 3 of Ash‚Äôs perks junk and useless! 
---
Flip flop and buckle up are just straight trash and no one ever uses them! Flip flop, is only okay if you have a teammate saboing and also the killer has to slug you, and then anyone with time on the game knows who to pickup first if they are slugged and doesn‚Äôt  need a aura to figure that out.
---
Bad influence:  Gains bloodpoints at a higher rate being near other survivors, but slows others progress
---
Town bicycle: Other survivors unhook and heal her faster
---
&gt;The main reason Killers decide to camp against overly altruistic swf teams is because they think the Killer is blind and just hide around the corner once he hooked somebody so what else is he going to do but camp that Survivor? If you would just let the Survivor sit on the hook and go do a gen for 30 seconds then come back to save them the killer wouldn't have a reason to camp. But no, you think you can just follow the killer to the hook and unhook your friend right in his face and then expect them not to camp. You know damn well this is what swf teams do.
---
The main reason killers decide to camp is because they want, end of story. At the end of the match they will give you an arbitrary reason like "you looped me too much", "you kept stunning me with pallets", "you kept jumping windows", "you guys gen rushed", etc etc.
---
&gt; Except yknow, the game doesn‚Äôt differentiate between a survivor with friends or joining a random lobby.
---
lol it absolutely does. This is nonsense.
---
I never really thought Piggy was bad. She's one of the most fun characters IMO.
---
Horror game?Excuse me there has been a misunderstanding.Im talking about dead by daylight.What are you talking about dear sir?
---
DbD and I had a love hate relationship from the start. There are so many moments which make me pull my hair out, especially when it comes to the dev's technical failures which lead to crashes and game breaking bugs. But then... there are these matches here and then in which you are in an epic 3 minute chase with the killer, dodging him in the last second again and again. Or the heart warming moments where killer and suvivor are nice to each other and pay honest respect in game or post game - despite all the generally existing toxicity. This is what draws me back again and again. Those moments. Because when it is good it is really good. :)
---
Why not both?
---
Obviously, she‚Äôs gotta come with a looping hallway.
---
I have a feeling this is somehow connected to doing tunneling or camping.
---
No SwF team is full of 4 godly survivors a
---
Besides the glasses I see no difference . Am I color blind?
---
Chases are what make the game right now.  Killers need help finding survivors and survivors need help extending.
---
This has to be a joke, right?
---
Galaxy brain nibbas: want the xenomorph and predator along with arnold scwarzhnegger as a survivor
---
It's a horror-themed game. Survivors and killers. It's already themed around 'Halloween horror slasher' type stuff.
---
JAKE &lt;3
---
That moment when Bill is more popular from dbd than from l4d
---
True and your not moving around like a slug! If I run a piece of a tombstone, I save it for that one special survivor who wants to teabag and flashlight me at every pallet and than snatch them up and laugh saying ‚ÄúThe Jokes On You Pal‚Äù 
---
Then just hook the rest and take my double pip
---
Funny that this's devs attempt at making impactful effects to be restricted. But there is no point at making restrictions to powerful effects in new perks if there's literally a meta set of old perks that need nothing to work.
---
Then you won't be affected by the proposed change, I don't see the problem.
---
A L M A  W A D E
---
Probably because we already have her, I've scrolled down so far and I can't figure out why it's not the first comment.
---
I‚Äôd take Chanel #2 as a survivor
---
Can‚Äôt wait for his perks 
---
Kill Count 
---
The increasing stakes of the trail fill you with determination for every survivor hooked you gain a token up to 12 every token increases your action speed by 1/1.5/2% 
---
Title Card 
---
At the start of the match for 20/30/40 seconds see the killer arua while this perk is active all vault actions will be loud even if they were slow vault and your gen speed will be decreased by 5/4/3%
---
Dull Machete
---
You know how to rate killers on their killing ability while in a 24 meter radius of a survivor while they get hit gain a token to a maximum of 5 the next time your hit one of these tokens will be consumed and the time it takes to heal yourself or be healed is reduced by 30/40/50%
---
It's quite obvious the game is in a bad state of bugs atm if you can't see that then wow.
---
The blindest Michael in the wild west
---
Only reason I want pennywise is cause I want a cool sewer map
---
I feel like if you‚Äôre looking through the tv at survivors, the survivors should see your picture on the tv. This would make it fun to fuck with people cause they‚Äôll be surprised be the sight of her on the screen like when Myers is staring and also your guards are down watching the tv when you forget about BEHIND YOU-
---
I mean we still try and win.... thats the aim of the game right? we just dont tryhard and gen rush
---
Exhaustion perks are fine as they are right now.
---
Survivor: my team sucked
---
Otzdarva: Sorry but did I mindgame you at the god pallet
---
Otzdarva: *after you threw it?*
---
What a savage.
---
The lobbies are literally the exact same. What are you playing on?
---
When you go through to play as survivor on PC, whether you‚Äôre playing alone or with friends, you go through the same two lobbies. Same with on Nintendo Switch.
---
Whether you invite friends or don‚Äôt, you are in the same lobby.
---
Where did you get that idea yeah he played it once on stream and didn‚Äôt know what he was doing and was confused but that doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt like it
---
So we‚Äôre getting the Matrix DLC??? 
---
NEO as Survivor and Agent Smith as the Killer! 
---
Dope!
---
Yeah man! Like, maybe Chucky could hop on them like a ... Jockey? I can‚Äôt remember what they were called exactly but, those short bouncy zombies from L4D2! And when that‚Äôs happening, yeah, the survivor would have to have a skill check prompt. That‚Äôd be pretty dope. üòÅüëå
---
I want all 3 they sounf like fun
---
Make the shirt less new
---
Not OP at all
---
The devs should program the totems to spawn right after the survivors, so they can spawn far away from them
---
I mean, I could. I just don't think there is room in most of my builds for both. Entertaining notion though!
---
Practice playing without meta perks and strong add ons during the day so you‚Äôre ready for their meta perks at night.
---
*At WoRk*
---
Bubba has that " "They were too rough in /r/DBDGoneGay " bounce
---
Only if you're relying solely on sacrifices for your scoring.  If you have good gen pressure and chases the whole game and get 3k you will pip every time.
---
Your rank is meant to show your abilities as survivor or killer compared to others.  If you are at rank 8 and can't pip without changing the rules of the game, you don't deserve to be rank 7.  The killers sitting at rank 1 right now have figured it out.  If you haven't, you don't deserve to be there.
---
Or the lady from "The Grudge".
---
Why is there gumball and Darwin and also spirit doesn't need nerf
---
Someone quick call the devs
---
Yeah okay lmao.
---
What a coincidence
---
Awwww
---
Ngl his hate boner for Billy is really offputting.  He takes every opportunity he can get to downplay him meanwhile he never plays him and doesn‚Äôt think critically enough about his mechanics.  He also almost never plays against him so his opinion is hardly informed.
---
Is that it?
---
Instaheals are one-use tho (i'm glad they were nerfed, they're still broken), iri hatchets are broken because it's a whole-game instadown. 
---
Now that they're starting to nerf crutchs, I hope Ebony Moris, Keys, Iri hatchet and Prayer Beads are getting some love very soon.
---
Are you saying killers are weak in DBD. All the new killers are very pay2win and WIN is very accurate because they are extremely hard to play against compared to the classic killers. Developers have even said that theyre meant to be stronger than the classic killers. Also im just saying nerf a perk that almost every killer takes because its a bad sign that so many killers take it in the first place even at high ranks, that MUST be a red flag that its too strong
---
A fine addition to my collection
---
I would love more characters from video games, but I think Pyramid Head would be tough to give a power
---
I like the idea of making the scratch marks change color if you are injured that way if a healthy survivor saves an injured one you can track them both and know who is who. 
---
Or make it so survivors leave some scratch marks when they walk too.
---
\&gt;  I honestly just don't get why so many in this sub seem to have this huge  hateboner for Tru. He's certainly very vocal and brutally honest with  his opinions 
---
thats pretty much it. he has opinions that he is vocal about. and because he has come to the conclusion that the higher rank meta is biased towards survivors that must mean he is bad, liar just a complainer etc
---
it is however funny that people say he only plays killer, seeming for his entire stream he constantly rotates between the two roles.
---
It's even more annoying when you don't get a pip just because you let the last guy leave.
---
Yeah, it really sucks! I think he‚Äôd be perfect for this game! I like Friday the 13th but it‚Äôs no DBD. üòèü§ô
---
Yeah ebony moris should be the next priority, they're completely broken and just a "let's nuke this group of survivors in particular" button.
---
Idk why but a lot of people say Wraith is a bad killer. I suck at killer and tend to get 3K-4K with him as well. I think Wraith is very underrated
---
So it heals your jaw?
---
HL? Don't know that acronym yet.
---
They are fine, most exhaustion perks by a tiny bit of time and can easily be baited out
---
That was the dumbest comment ever, i want to kill myself
---
is there a problem?
---
It's for sure boring as hell for the killer, but I enjoy the "Hide and Seek" idea for survivor. I don't do it anymore, because it never accomplishes anything. However, saying it isn't fun for the survivor is wrong. Haha
---
You are right when you think about it because he is just mainly brute force and a giant weapon. I wonder if a different character from Silent Hill would work?
---
Mindgames are a core-part of a chase. 
---
If the survivor makes a lot of distance, say 40m away, then their aura should be revealed for a few moments, but when you are looping a jungle gym then it's essential that your aura isn't revealed so the survivor actually has a chance.
---
Is that it, the baby huntress missing some shots??
---
oh my god you actually think you're so important that the only way to find this comment is to follow you. sorry nerd but i do sort by new
---
it's not my fault you have a habit of saying dumb as fuck shit
---
Sorry it was a bit late this week, there was some unforeseen circumstances
---
What is everyones problem here? End game is boring af
---
I‚Äôm not saying they wouldn‚Äôt know they‚Äôre grouped up. I‚Äôm saying you go through the same two lobbies, whether you‚Äôre grouped up or not. 
---
So if you invite a friend to your lobby, let‚Äôs say, is it going to tell you what your friend is running? Will it black out the perks that you‚Äôre both using until you choose different ones? 
---
Or let‚Äôs just make it easy and when you think you‚Äôre joining a four man SWF......
---
Leave the fucking lobby? Lmao. As I have stated before, which you ignored. So let‚Äôs just end this conversation there, because there is no reason to implement new game mechanics when it is your choice who you play against. Hence why my sympathy is zero, because you don‚Äôt have to play against them to begin with.
---
What would you describe as high rank because again, i'm seeing hex in every second game at ranks 4 and 5 roughly. Don't you think if this perk is taken by so many killers in so many skill brakcets that it must have an aspect to it that makes it too powerful. Most of the people who play dbd now are people who have played it since launch. I doubt that those same people just dont know how to play against it
---
I want to fuck that spooky bitch
---
PD: Fuck  StoneToss.
---
He has 100% said that exact quote before.  He was playing an M1 killer (maybe wraith or trapper) and swung to get a quick down to slug then go after someone else and that survivor dead harded basically costing him the game.
---
Someone help me. Do we actually have a road map for DLC at all for this game or is it all a stab in the dark, with waiting for content? I‚Äôm still fairly new to the game and community. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I think it would be pretty cool to have a xenomorph in the game and have his power be that he can climb up walls and pounce on people for an insta down.
---
It‚Äôs like a foot tall but ok
---
Lol can tell you‚Äôre new if you don‚Äôt even know names but this is a great drawing!
---
Imma keep it real. I don‚Äôt run exhaustion perks except the occasional adrenaline when I don‚Äôt have Second Wind, but all a change like this would do is nerf a lot of perks that don‚Äôt need it, make clown and huntress win every chase in 2 seconds and would absolutely piss off a lot of survivor players as it‚Äôs unneeded and a pretty big nerf to survivors.
---
Thank you :D
---
Then dont immediately assume something and ask if you dont know next time and dont try to tell people what they think its dumb af.
---
Literally didn‚Äôt say anything to insinuate the sort but okay? Lol. I mean, you can keep commenting if you want, doesn‚Äôt bother me, but I feel like you‚Äôre just severely wasting your time at this point.
---
I dont have ruin so i just run with surge lmao
---
Calling me autistic for not playing spirit/nurse or sweaty for playing spirit/nurse is try hard how?
---
They have the chance to escape as soon as they enter the match, it's on them or their teammates if that doesn't work out.
---
I honestly think it's a problem with HOW survivors/killers are graded for those pips. Some of the points are pretty clear, and fair. Some others... not so much.
---
haha holy shit you have completely backtracked but you're still acting like you're right. fucking amazing. i have never seen goal posts move like this
---
you now:
---
&gt; I‚Äôm not saying they wouldn‚Äôt know they‚Äôre grouped up
---
you a few comments ago:
---
&gt; the game doesn‚Äôt differentiate between a survivor with friends or joining a random lobby.
---
my thoughts exactly, both sides would benefit from this
---
&gt; Literally didn‚Äôt say anything to insinuate the sort but okay? 
---
are you serious? your first comment was some neckbeard shit about suiciding because of ariana grande
---
Been playing the game for years i have 3 maps in my inventory :/
---
i had one visible near me during the start of the game where the camera 360s around you.
---
I honestly think the game should have been balanced around the idea of communication to begin with. You can't have a game that has a cooperative aspect, and not expect people to try to maximize it.
---
Wait, why are unmasked Susie and Amanda in the background?
---
Lol right? 4 gens done before first hook and he calls me sweaty in post game lol
---
Aw look. 
---
You‚Äôre still ignoring what I‚Äôm saying. It‚Äôs cute. 
---
Just leave the damn lobby.
---
My point is you can criticize a company and at the same time move on with your life
---
I stated in this in my first reply. You might have missed it or just have memory issues if you have to strawman my points so much
---
Before embarrassing yourself in the future I suggest to read again what are you replying to. Really.. i thought you was gonna come up with something concrete than just strawman, that's very disappointing
---
How do you not have ruin lol. Everyone has ruin
---
I can counter them well, it's my teammates at 10 rank staring at corners I can't fix you idiot
---
lmfao
---
holy shit I am actually curious how you even function on a day to say basis being like this
---
Clearly a joke? I like that you take everything seriously though.
---
Not everyone likes Ariana Grande, cupcake. People are bound to make jokes about adding her into the game. I‚Äôm sorry I hurt your fanboy feelings though.
---
What‚Äôs your favourite song?
---
Sometimes things get leaked after it's been in development (e.g ghostface, there was some weird things with it's announcement half bring leaked by some guy on Twitter), but mostly shots in the dark. Not really knowing whether the next killer will be original or liscensed content until after it's announced.
---
I still want candyman
---
Why would you increase the already ridiculously long fatigue timer?
---
&gt;\-It is fair tbh   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;\-you seem like a clown
---
bruh
---
I‚Äôm just wondering how old you are, to be honest. My guess is 16-18, but I could be wrong.
---
I thought it would be interesting to post, but it's guess not
---
I agree with both of you honestly. The progression of points into pips is laid out before you. You know what they are, and you know what to do to maximize them. 
---
However, sometimes that's just not viable. Sometimes you honestly just CAN'T get a lot of points in a specific way. Sometimes the sruvivors have pitched tent near your Ruin, or middle gen, and you have to dedicate ALL of your time to hooking the same guy that just won't fuck off elsewhere. So then you're stuck essentially blocking the hooked guy,  while the survivors swarm you to rescue him like a pack of wolves. Then you end up with 4 hooks and 4k, and you get shit for chase points and sacrifice. Them game isn't 100% in your hands to decide what happens.
---
Maybe you need a second view point of the whole situation. Look, some of the stuff Tru3 said can be often controversial within the gaming community. And I get that some of the stuff he says is him just having a bad day. But for God sake, have you spent the last few minutes even LOOKING at some of the comments within this thread? Have you?! The people are downright slapping their dicks together like fucking baboons. I think my reaction is perfectly justified thank you very much!
---
1) Not sure why the insults are needed
---
2) People being bad at the game is not a reason to change the game
---
Pay2win omg ü§£. I cant believe the shit im reading, im out.
---
Camping is a legit strategy, albeit a dumb and annoying one that you shouldn't utilize.
---
They have 2 chances to escape.  The killer has 4 chances to get a sacrifice.  It all works out.
---
Unless you're suggesting we also take away NOED and Michael's T3 and Billy's chainsaw, and Leatherface's chainsaw, and the bleed mechanic, and pig's traps, and moris, and michael's tombstone.  It just wouldn't be fair to use any game mechanic to down/kill a survivor outside of chase them and M1 them twice, hook them and let them die on the hook.
---
Yeah Huntress Lullaby. It‚Äôs pretty strong in a gen build because of the removed skillcheck warning.
---
&gt; Clearly a joke? I like that you take everything seriously though.
---
that doesn't magically make it not a generic neckbeard take
---
ariana song? i'm not that big of a fan so I only know her hits, but I like that one with iggy azaelia
---
Makes logic, it's interchangeable
---
Amazing
---
I don't like the idea of a skill check being apart of the attack. You're forced to rely on the survivor missing every time, or they prolong the chase and waste a lot of time. 
---
If the skill checks are too hard, there's no counterplay for newer survivors (or people who can't hit them in general) which doesn't work towards BHVRs tendency to balance for newer players, and if it's too easy, we have a speedy little shit that can't kill anyone. Maybe there's a perfect middle to these but I feel like it's too much.
---
Or they are actually moving faster because of ‚ôølust
---
Err, no, there will be no stand off, because:
---
\- if surv jumps, he gets grabbed;
---
\- if surv waits for hatch to be closed and then opens it, he gets grabbed during a jump;
---
i just turned 9.5
---
aw shucks, thanks
---
Well, I'm in, if Hex get an addition as well, like for every Hex you run, increase the Survivors ability to unhook themself by 40%.
---
Yes, because nothing you‚Äôve said in your entire life has ever been cringe worthy. You‚Äôre welcome to your opinion though.
---
what an intelligent observation
---
I thought I made this post because of how similar I would have replied lol
---
What is this template
---
as long as you admit to being a neckbeard, whatever
---
thx for playing
---
I think you missed the joke
---
yea, tru3 has only been playing since the game came out as 50/50 killer survivor and only has like 3000 hours, hardly informed.
---
This^ I play pretty competitively. If they want it to be a non-competitive game, give us a mode that doesn't rank us. Fuck, I don't even care if it gave 1/4th BP and no devote progression. I'd just like to be able to play more than 50 matches a week and not end up in red ranks where everyone is sweaty. I want to play with my casual friends and not ruin their fun.
---
i unlocked and leveled the clown for his perks without really wanting to play him.  I figured i'd try for his adept achievement last night.  My 2nd game playing him, all survivors escape of course and some asshat posts in end game chat "LOL EZ PIP", which didn't really bother me until he decided to post it on my steam profile as well.
---
I've watched Tru3 on and off for a couple years now, and I've got a couple gripes for sure. I find him entertaining and don't mind supporting him, but recently I've noticed him complaining a lot. I get that sometimes people get tilted, but, complaining that "my teammates don't do anything, and the enemy team gets all the sweaty tryhards" can be said about every online gaming community ever, and it's not just him that goes against the "cream of the crop".
---
There is no such thing as bad publicity they say
---
Well it‚Äôs just brainstorming to be fair, I would just love to see the speedy little shit part included
---
it shouldn't have a cooldown, imo
---
What? If the survivors can't manage to get a single generator, why should they get a chance to escape that is based on complete chance?  
---
What does any of what you just said have to do with that?
---
You ended your comment with a strawman too. oof
---
Like i said in my comment in one of his leatherface videos don‚Äôt really remember which one as for the bonesaw it‚Äôs been awhile and can‚Äôt really remember as he switches up the props behind frequently
---
What do you mean? It's only increased when all survivors are struck.
---
It says "2/3/4/5 seconds of cooldown is suffered upon depletion of **Feral Frenzy depending on how many survivors were struck"** Meaning that if you just toggle it on and off or stab just one survivor you'll suffer 2 seconds of cooldown. Striking two survivors during Frenzy will have you suffering 3 seconds of cooldown. Makes sense?
---
I didn't mind googling it but checking it again now the standard cooldown is 4 seconds of fatigue with no ad-ons. I still think the current sheet is fine. 5 seconds for injuring all 4 survivors shouldn't be too bad imho
---
What are you even saying lol. 
---
They tried to improve level design and totem spawns repeatedly (and the latest map + badham school map rework are getting pretty good at totem spawns). Everybody on this subreddit bitches about keys constantly (and sure, it would be great to see them reworked as long as ebony moris get the same treatment). Same for gen times, and if they didn't change gen times it's because it's obviously a little more complicated than "add 15 seconds and be done with it", balance wise. (it would completely break the game for white/yellow/green ranks, so 90% of the player base, to just make gens longer)
---
As you can see, we're far from radio silence on those issues.
---
I‚Äôm on it chief
---
It's all the reason to fix the algorithm, and you ignored my actual point
---
Correct
---
To catch your eye ;)
---
so fuck survivors? grabing needed to go and now it would be a lost case for survivors, always
---
I‚Äôm just doing regular Ghostface alongside a voice changer that I clipped onto the small slit at the top of the mouth. Hard to breathe, but it looks good, so...
---
no
---
Huh. Well, I guess it worked.
---
Why is dedication not a skill ? That sound like it could be a skill !
---
thank you
---
I thought the lawsuit was over and that was why they can't update it. For some reason i thought I heard that they lost the rights to make anything new because of it. I may be mistaken, though.
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. **This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.**
---
&gt;* **New players between rank 16 and rank 20** receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing. 
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019
---
Yeah, sounds both terrifying and hilarious.
---
What I hate about vureent hatch is that you can't do shit about people with a key. You just have to lie down and take it
---
I remember seeing Surge in the original BHVR livestream and thinking ‚ÄúWow, that could be a really good alternative to Pop!‚Äù Forgive me, Entity, for I have sinned...
---
What would be the punishment for looking at him?
---
This adds a couple of QoL changes and a stealth gimmick that could be useful in mindgames, but it's essentially a less useful Insidious and doesn't fit the theme of the power well.  
---
It fails to address a majority of the contradictory and punishing changes made to Legion during their rework/nerf.
---
Doesn't have any other information on the game though like gamer tag/name ect
---
This is such a specific situation
---
&gt; Except I never claimed to be the most important person in the world, or anything close to it, or suggested as much. You were the only person that assumed I felt that way.
---
no, no. you asked what kind of neckbeard **I** am. I was answering that
---
I bet he'd have a presence about him. 
---
Maybe it'd be a little unnerving.
---
Plenty would say that hatches should be removed whatsoever, because "survivors get rewarded for nothing". But I'm fine with either.
---
If you pick mine up wrong it breaks
---
Ruin doesn't survive long enough
---
With a Shaggy survivor that yells ZOINKS when hit
---
oh god i can only imagine how terrible huntress plays on switch
---
This is brilliant! Reddit...connecting people :)
---
Don't think the entity has the concept of time
---
Sorry sweetheart, but that wasn‚Äôt what I was asking. I was asking what definition you were using for neckbeard.
---
Though I guess your brand of neckbeard does check out now.
---
This is quite intriguing to me as a killer main. Mind running us through a few of your top and bottom picks? What makes them fun / not fun for you. Genuinely curious. If I can make the game more fun for my survivors, I'd be intrigued to know.
---
How would chucky carry Jeff or Jane halfway across the map lol
---
&gt;TOXIC SURVIVE WITH FRIENDS DESTROYED (Legit) (Gone Sexual!)
---
Video: *Tru3 playing normally against some altruistic Survivors and one Meg who clicks her flashlight.*
---
Killer main here for reference so that might explain my choices. Demo is a fairly strong killer as well and his unique chase music makes facing him really enjoyable for me and to play as.
---
Lol it's fine
---
That's nice, but it's stupid.
---
I think the whole emblem system has really skewed people's opinion on what it means to win. 
---
If you've forced the hatch to spawn - killed three survivors before they've powered the gates - then you've already "won". The last one escaping is mercy.
---
Against lower ranks yes it would. If they‚Äôre bad enough to fail skill checks like this perk requires them to be, then they‚Äôre also the type of people to give up on gens and immediately look for Ruin when they see it.
---
Even if they‚Äôre not directly on a gen, the whole team searching for one totem (like baby survivors often do) still wastes a ton of team and gives the killer a chance to apply pressure. Simply put, it‚Äôs way better used. The perk you‚Äôre offering gives a minuscule change during a game at best.
---
That doesn't address my statement. Lower tier killers would absolutely struggle without it. For instance today so far every ruin game I've played it has been cleaned in less than 2 minutes. It's powerful but it has a big downside.
---
nurse is a and rest is d. but nurse will join d soon and I will main survivor.
---
removing the hatch entirely is a totally different thing as keeping the grab animation dont you think? I wouldn't care either way as long as it's fair to both sides. no hatch would make the endgame killer favored more or less depending on the spawns of the gates and his mobility
---
So it seems obvious that the best thing to do is to pick one toon and run him until he's maxed, then switch over. I started with Ace because he was tagged as "Easy". I'm almost to lvl 40, so I should start considering who next. Is there a general consensus as to the most useful survivors? Or at the very least, who you should get to 50 early on?
---
Have you even played killer? and i dont mean played once like in rank 20, i mean REALLY played killer
---
Personally I enjoy facing everyone except Freddy, I still have the creep. My favorite to face against is the huntress though because of that most excellent humming.
---
And he needs to have an obsession perk that is "be my victim".
---
Hard disagree.
---
Demo is shit, noone plays him since he is just a discount Billy and many Twitch players and the community alike abandoned him 
---
I havent seen a demo in 50 survivor games
---
To quote myself after several SWF matches where I had a daily to open a gate and the randoms refused to do the last gen:
---
&gt;I honestly wish they'd remove the hatch not because it's OP, but because I'm sick of people giving up after doing 3 gens because "lol the hatch will just spawn and I can get out with a key or whatever."
---
With the current totem placement system? I don't think so.
---
Organize through twitch which isn't a random oh I can come next week type thing, it takes planning and organizing and would have been in the works longer than the issues they found but keep being salty about a free event being *delayed* but will run the same amount of time
---
it sounds like the stuff should be coming out, at the latest, by next week, like Nov 5. Plus, with no putrid flowers, theres nothing to look forward to except for whatver type of challenges the rift has, which i still dont know
---
I am unbelievably shocked this video doesn't have more downvotes. Not saying it's a bad video but with a title like that I would've expected the Survivor mains to pounce on it like lions on an injured gazzel.
---
Yeah he for sure prefers killer. I still haven't found him to be too biased though, but his opinion is definitely influenced by the potential of SWF groups rather than solo queue survivors.
---
Agreed
---
I‚Äôd say the only killers I don‚Äôt like facing are camping Leatherfaces,
---
And Myers because they always get the god damn jump scares on me. Every time. I have legitimately accidentally thrown my keyboard and mouse because a Myers just popped up behind me like ‚ÄúOH HELLO‚Äù, and I hate jump scares. Lmao.
---
At least a bloodhunt would be nice, something to get us involved in the game not a big "fuck you Twitch importanter"
---
Every time I see clips of this shit I wonder why it isn't fucking fixed yet.
---
So you're saying a perking functioning the way its supposed to be is op? Also that gives the killer a pass to be toxic?
---
I love it but I'd smooth out the lines a bit
---
I just close it in front of them and run stbfl just in case
---
Lol you run into them when you play swf. Jk, but honestly I wish I knew the answer cos it‚Äôs rare I get a team that doesn‚Äôt freak out when we get ruin lol.
---
I dont play a whole lot but the chick with the golden scissors from US would be cool.
---
A free event they announced? Which some people even took days off to attend? In a multiplayer horror game a halloween event should be pretty much expected even more one of the characters is from a movie called "halloween"
---
But yeah i am so entitled
---
From BHVR, keys and gen times get nothing
---
This would encourage camping...not only can a killer knock down an exposed survivor quickly but can likely knock down the unhooked one too right after. 
---
If you think about it. Why is it a big deal for killers to have survivors ‚Äúhovering‚Äù. I main survivor and it annoys me when several people hover cause that‚Äôs means no gens are being worked on. And that‚Äôs good news for the killer. Does it suck for make your choice? Yes. But on the flip side, you have less people working on gens because of it
---
I want Jason
---
:(
---
"cAn'T sPaWn WiTh ThE hEx ToTeM iN vIeW xDdDdDdDdDdDdDdD"
---
I mean, if you use Doctor with this Perk, Huntress Lullaby, Ruin and Overcharge like... you see where Im trying to get with this? It would be a scary game.
---
Yes, there's a good video on the subject [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Goi0knDvpGI).
---
And you‚Äôd be wrong lol 
---
This perk doesn‚Äôt account for the fact that people depip as well. What happens if you bring this perk in an attempt to slow down the game and, surprise, they all know how to do gens? It‚Äôs borderline useless. People with about an hour in the game will hit almost all their skill checks, it‚Äôs not rocket science to be able to get a ‚Äúgood‚Äù, even if they can‚Äôt hit ‚Äúgreats‚Äù. 
---
Im not even advocating using Ruin at all, because I don‚Äôt run it on the killer I play the most. But what I‚Äôm saying is that a good ruin spawn will effect the game more than the perk you are proposing, 9 times out of 10. Even a crappy spawn will slow down the game unless a survivor literally spawns right next to it. This perk is effective if the killer has also just started playing the game, maybe, and that‚Äôs about it. It‚Äôll work for like 4 games before being useless. At the end of the day, literally any other perk that slows down gen progress would have a bigger impact.
---
I want the werwolf, frankenstein and dracula
---
all killers xD everyone dc's the second they get downed first time &gt;&lt;
---
&gt;  but that wasn‚Äôt what I was asking. I was asking what definition you were using for neckbeard.
---
what? but you said:
---
&gt; Which one are you?
---
lmfao holy shit i love you. you either blatantly lie about stuff you say and do not give a single shit, have an unfathomably terrible grasp on english, or legit don't remember what you say
---
all of those possibilities are gut busters
---
went back in and smoothed it, thanks for the feed back
---
Demo is not shit. Demo is completely average, doesn't really do well in anything specific, but does decent in everything. Just cause no one plays him doesn't mean demo is low tier.
---
I play mostly killer and have gotten like 10 killer dailies in a row, so i feel it's just random
---
You see, I actually like this. The idea of combo'ing your Feral Frenzy by hitting multiple survivors is actually really good. If what I've read is correct, you can put a survivor into deep wound, put someone ELSE into deep wound and return back to that survivor that you deep wounded to apply more pressure to that survivor. Its a lot more fun and makes a lot more sense in the idea of a "Feral Frenzy"
---
GG
---
Yes, you are entitled glad you can see that
---
Yes plz buff it.
---
(Laughs in gen grabber spirit main.)
---
YES GIMME!
---
while I can see that the ranking system can make the game look more competitive the ranks have absolutely no meanings besides matchmaking(?) so we actually have no reason to rank up and keep it I guess
---
Or just playing a killer.
---
The "Difficulties" are literally meaningless, so dont worry about those. The most worthwhile survivors to level up for teachable imo: Bill, Nea, Meg, David, Claud, Laurie, and Dwight (I guess somewhat in this order, but it's up to your playstyle)
---
Ah that makes sense. I didn't consider that they would probably appeal.
---
Just keep leveling up past 50 unless you really want the bloody cosmetic, you'll have 4 chances per web to get it and the "rarity boost" from prestiging in negligible (plus discordance isnt a rare perk so youd actually have a less of a chance to get it if the boost was signficant lol)
---
Wow this is genius
---
Shame the devs think this is a horror game :(
---
Most of the time people level up survivors to get their 3 teachable perks (aka the perks a character starts with. Once you get to level 30/35/40 you can unlock those perks such that they start appearing in other characters' bloodwebs). 
---
Nea is a pretty popular pick because her Balanced Landing perk is one of the best survivor perks in the game (gets rid of the stagger effect when you jump from someplace and gives you a short speed boost upon landing) and some people like her Urban Evasion perk as well (you crouch walk as quickly as you normally walk). 
---
People also like Dwight for Bond (reveals survivor auras when you're within a certain distance) and prove thyself (anytime you do a gen with another survivor you both get a 10% repair speed boost). 
---
Claudette is also popular among new players for her empathy (reveals injured survivor auras) and self-care (gain ability to heal yourself at 50% speed), though self-care is pretty controversial on this sub for the reason that it can waste a lot of time which could otherwise be spent helping others or working on gens.
---
Strange if you never insulted them on a personal level then why did I immediately find your comment in which you directly insulted peanits? Comparing them to apes also counts dude
---
Get a life. Go outside, find something else to do with your time and find some happiness bro. There's more to life than dbd. I'm done talking to you
---
Sorry but what do you mean by snowball?
---
he complains constantly about toxic survivors but he slugs to prevent the hatch from opening which is a toxic killer move so he comes across as a hypocrite. 
---
killers have the advantage in finding the hatch first so its a game mechanic that is killer sided and yet he still chooses to whine about it
---
On the same note why is it a big deal for survivors to be camped or tunneled? That means the Killer is only focused on one person and that's more people to complete generators and that's good news for the survivors. The reason is because it's annoying for survivors and enough of them complained until they were given ways to counter it. But why should a killer be punished for tunneling? Their job is to kill in the quickest and most efficient way possible and the most efficient way is to go after the weakest target. Again he's punished for it because enough survivors complained about it.
---
And no it shouldn't encourage camping because of all the perks that reward Killers for not doing so like the ones I mentioned, PGTW and BBQ.
---
Infectious makes people scream around you correct? Do you know the radius?
---
ummmm
---
I was thinking something robotic. I think that‚Äôd be pretty cool.
---
I think I‚Äôve had my NOED cleansed once back in the older Freddy days (when he had to put survivors to sleep before attacking).
---
It didn‚Äôt much matter because I downed and hooked someone already and Blood Warden activated. What would have been a 2K became a 4K.
---
I don‚Äôt want bloodpoints I want kills lol
---
How exactly am I wrong? Mind to explain? You are a killer main and you constantly get killer dailies. I'm not and I get a lot more killer dailies!
---
That's even worse, survivors will simply spend these 2 minutes on searching and destroying your Ruin totem.
---
He's very clearly a survivor main. Trying to debate what's fair or balanced in this game with people that spend the majority of their in-game time only playing one side is a waste of time.
---
Gorilla glue? Looks good. But yea, they don‚Äôt even look that stable in the game. I‚Äôm waiting to cleanse a totem and wondering why Nea is taking so long, slap that shit and run
---
Ooohhh that would be fun.
---
High end of the tier list, not in the game stage. I agree endgame Fred is poo, but that doesn't stop him from being a decent killer despite that. 
---
Plus LF and Doc are at the bottom of OPs fun tier list and neither are amazing. Nurse is low, but not too far from Mid and she dominates. 
---
GF is higher up and is an alright killer.
---
Have you tried using a script to struggle for you? Very convenient so you don‚Äôt have to destroy your hands mashing space.
---
I want professor Snape
---
I see this poster went to the school of putting out a post to crap on someone instead of actually listening to his idea, then simultaneously calling them entitled on a platform they can't speak for themselves.
---
You know I'm right, that's why your only response is "whatever."
---
&gt; I literally asked you what definition you were using. That‚Äôs what I was referring to.
---
and I clearly declined to answer that one in favor of answering the other question so I could joke about myself
---
fucking christ you are impossible
---
That would be period stains
---
So assuming you have all the survivor perks you need, like Decisive, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, Adrenaline, etc. Then what the fuck is the difference between playing survivors? Like, killers all have their own power, but the only thing that differenciates survivors is their starting perks, right? Or am I missing something?
---
People wanted shaggy for MK11 and they said they're not aloud to put him in, due to him being from a children's/ family friendly license and MK11 is very violent. 
---
Im sure the case is same with DBD
---
Werewolf would be awesome.
---
Fix it how? NOED goes to a random dull totem. If this happens to be the only dull totem left, where else would it go? It's just chance someone happens to be cleansing it at the exact time it procs.
---
I don't know why we are comparing Billy to demo. Their abilities work differently, and play differently. 
---
Billy and demo's "dash" are very different. Demogorgon's pounce is to be utilized mid chase, while Billy should be used to go around the map and punish survivors who are in the open. In chase, Billy doesn't do much, against a survivor who knows how to loop, he's an m1 killer. A demo can force a survivor to make a choice if he's in pounce range and can predict survivor movements, if they choose wrong, they get hit. Why we are comparing the two? They have different purposes and utility. Also demo is better at destroying pallets imo, specifically mid chase.
---
And yeah Billy does have better map maneuverability. What is your point? They do map control differently. All you have proven is that Billy is good and is better than demo. This doesn't prove demo is bad.
---
It just baffles me how most of the higher tier killers are c-d, and lower tiers are a-b
---
For example.legion is boring as shit - why is he b?
---
Umm.. yes actually. I call Bs both sides.
---
They updates the unreal engine, which is a big fucking deal. 500 developers aren‚Äôt on bugs and fixes btw. They have jobs and time limits.
---
Hearing that giant sword thing being dragged around, nice n scary
---
Thank you man. Appreciate that üôèüèª
---
Who‚Äôs insulting you? I blocked whoever it is before, they sound like a dick and that seems accurate since I blocked them before as I mentioned.
---
I guess I'll try to get it next after I max out the demogorgon.
---
Lithe, Quick and Quiet, Dance with me, xxxx
---
One of the streamers penned it the Houdini.
---
Yeah. Freddy used to be an end game killer, but that changed with his rework. But when there are gens up, he's pretty powerful, which is the majority of the match. He gets weaker as the game goes on, but has an advantage at the beginning
---
Exactly right!
---
I run Brutal strength. He ends chases in an instant because of his bottles, with stbfl the chases are even faster
---
I've just rebound it to scroll wheel with infinite scroll
---
Fuck yeah, the big rasengan could be a mori
---
They're on the New Dead By Daylight chapter. They also need a nerf.
---
Yea I'm on PC. Green/brown rank
---
For me Ghost Face and Freddy are at the bottom.
---
Ghostface because his power seems very inconsistent as far as revealing goes.
---
Freddy himself I don‚Äôt mind playing against.  I just hate seeing the usual Forever Freddy lineup.
---
Wrong.  I play both almost equally.  I generally hit the rank resets around rank 12-13 for both every month.  Not great, but good enough to at least hit the green ranks.
---
I'm just saying we're only seeing what you show us, I'm not calling you a liar or toxic it's just very easy to paint a false narrative.
---
Tunnelling and camping isn‚Äôt the most efficient way to kill someone. You are setting yourself up for disaster and little points to go with it at the end of the game. If you tunnel one person, they could easily have Decisive and lead you on a long chase, meanwhile gens will be popping and you‚Äôll have no map pressure. Not to mention that if you injure and chase multiple survivors you will have tons of map pressure if you can do your job correctly, instead of leaving 3 survivors to do gens.
---
Understandable for gen times, source for keys ?
---
I don't want none of those killer. Only one I want is chucky.
---
Killers need to kill.  Killers do not need a 4k.
---
Nice :)
---
okay :)
---
Billy's dash is also supposed to be used mid chase - if you are not using jt this way you just do it incorrectly 
---
Also demo is not better at destroying pallets at all - his shred pallets takes longer then pressing space ones the pallet is dropped if you dont predict it
---
Why does noone Play demo high rank? I see more legions and clowns then demo
---
Killer main actually.
---
Nice try though.
---
There are some differences in skins - Claudettes with certain outfits are nigh invisible - but otherwise they're all just the same body with different coats of paint.
---
Dragging
---
Some survivors are louder than others, smaller character models can hide more easily, some survivors have cosmetics that lend themselves to gameplay styles. other than that nothing
---
If we get Sadako can we also get Brenda Meeks?
---
It‚Äôs really not that efficient though is it? You have a weak person that can either heal themselves but needs to take 30 seconds to do so or can‚Äôt heal themselves so they‚Äôre injured until they can get healed by someone - meaning someone isn‚Äôt on a gen or they stay injured till you find them and they‚Äôre on hit. The healthy person who took them off the hook should be your target. If you hit them, now two people are injured and not on gens or are at least more exposed than one full healthy and one injured. 
---
I play killer sometimes for blood points and experience but I never tunnel. And on top of that, if I accidentally run into the person who was I hooked within a minute of being unhooked, I‚Äôll just leave them. I don‚Äôt play at red ranks though so maybe that‚Äôs why I have an easier time only killing a couple people instead of all 4 because I don‚Äôt care about rank and all that. I just try to have fun and hook everyone at least once for BBQ. 
---
Also can we acknowledge BBQ doesn‚Äôt reward you for not camping. You see their auras whether you camp or not after you hook someone. And if don‚Äôt see anyone‚Äôs Auras far away, the assumption is cause they‚Äôre all close by so why would you leave?
---
Majority of the match - 1 gen left to do - pick one
---
Shia LaBeouf
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Yes she can use scratch marks and glow, but your proposed changes are to remove glow upon phasing, making it very obvious that's she's phasing, and simply relying on scratch marks will be pointless if all you have to do is walk or stand still. Just think of her in red ranks how ez 4k that would be with no add ons.
---
&gt;Strange if you never insulted them on a personal level then why did I immediately find your comment in which you directly insulted peanits? Comparing them to apes also counts dude
---
Ohh so you are talking about a totally another thread that you found after digging into my account. Creepy..
---
Yeah, peanits is a despicable mod. He shouldn't be in charge of anything for how he treats everyone and how shitty his attitude is, as well as many other mods too.
---
In the same post back there I also compliment not_queen and should also do the same for another which actually I forgot the name. So what? I don't get your point
---
Is such a weak "gotcha" and also meaningless. It doesn't help your argument my dude
---
&gt;Get a life. Go outside, find something else to do with your time and find some happiness bro. There's more to life than dbd. I'm done talking to you
---
The classic "get a life nerd" in 2019 and **ON REDDIT** that's hilarious. You're posting cringe dude, that's so sad. You have nothing else to say? Maybe call me virgin or some other 90's insult? God damn! Maybe you should get outside more if you get triggered and can't have a civil discussion also digging into someone account to make a point
---
Its like I'm going to dig into your past and look it up if you said something homophobic or racist in the past few months if taken out of context and then bring it up in a totally unrelated conversation. Like, really dude, that's sad
---
I've came here to say the same thing but I was outplayed
---
Sorry lol
---
You should head over to the BHVR offices and wave the magic coding/certification wand (which i assume must exist) to resolve all the issues and get the timeline back on track for those people who painstakingly planned their lives around the timing of this event.
---
Just so we're absolutely sure, have you unlocked the Discordance teachable on Legion?
---
Have you every tried the ‚Äúcolorblind glasses‚Äù?
---
https://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions/color-blind-glasses.htm
---
Not sure if they would help your case at all. Doesn‚Äôt really address the game issue directly, but they have Harlow some people a bit.
---
Edit: *helped, not Harlow. Spellcheck is really aggressive.
---
"The abomination" (frankenstien)
---
Mending is boring but he provides a unique experience while in Frenzy; Pallets and windows aren't as effective, but missing causes a big punishment for the killer. It can play like a back and forth, trying to fatigue him before he bops you. Plus OP may not mind mending too much.
---
Nurse is better Legion and isn't as harshly punished for her mistake, which is rarer than Legion's mistake. Since they both provide something different for looping while using their power, they both got a bump, but since Nurse provides less counterplay overall, she went down lower.
---
That's how I interpreted the placements.
---
Ow this formatting.
---
Anyways:
---
* I feel like the speed should be 130% and not 125%. The 10% extra speed just feels bad and 15% did feel better. Do agree that vaulting speed needs to be increased, obviously.
---
* Removing the Terror Radius while standing still is actually an interesting concept for mindgames, and does more closely follow Legion's character trailer. I think it would make more sense if the Terror Radius was *expanded* however to be global. This would give Legion potent detection and accomplish about the same thing as removing the terror radius, but would give Legion more synergy with Terror Radius perks (Clownphobia, Unnerving, possibly even Overwhelming) and give a semblance of parity with Iridescent Button. Basically it would make Legion feels unique and have some character-specific strategies instead of essentially being a default Killer that can vault pallets for their first hit.
---
* Don't know what you mean by the cool-down being dependant on how many Survivors you hit but if you're talking about the period after stopping the ability I think it should probably scale downwards with the amount of Survivors you hit? I also think 5 seconds of stun is insane no matter how you look at it. It should probably scale along the lines of 3 / 2.5 / 2 / 1.5 / 1 based on the number of Survivors you hit. Yes if you hit all 4 Survivors you could get old Cool Dirt cool-down, but this still involves you hitting all 4 Survivors.
---
* Being able to see while vaulting would be a nice QoL but risks being a bit too strong.
---
* Killer Instinct *shouldn't* reveal Survivors who already have Deep Wounds unless the Killer has an addon. (Rework to Frank's Mix Tape?) It should also be in a different colour to avoid confusion.
---
&gt;You know I'm right, that's why your only response is "whatever."
---
sure buddy
---
TRUE TALENT
---
You got it. Basically only cosmetic differences. Some survivors are shorter and harder to see; some people claim x is louder than normal. Mostly, though, just comes down to preference.
---
MineralYeet is a nazi
---
Camping gives a huge opportunity for gen rushing so if the survivors utilize that instead of trying to save the survivor then you will end up with 1 or 2 kills by the end of the game but if yout fine with that then go ahead
---
An already existing event hard to do again - pls defend this poor indie company :^)
---
...and if the killer DCs you won't pip.  I'm not sure what your point is?  Everyone knows how the system works.  Everyone knows what metrics are used to decided your pip points.  If the system were as arbitrary as you make it out to be, there would never be red rank killers.  It isn't, and there are.  
---
I'll repeat:  ranks are meant to show your ability.  They aren't meant to be a treat everyone gets for participating.
---
I mean, that‚Äôs your own prerogative.
---
WP
---
No wonder you have such a biased look on the killer side. I play both and ruin doesnt do shit on high ranks, its gone in the first 2 minutes of the game if not sooner. You say pay to win but you can reach high rank with any killer if you're experienced enough with him. 
---
What about survivor perks, Nancy brought a pretty good perk which heals you in 8 seconds and you only need to cleanse a totem and if that wasnt enough you can combine it with Head on from Jane which basically means you get a free heal if not a stun to get away. Also may i remind you DS which comes from Laurie.
---
Also Dance with me which most of the time is combined with Quck&amp;Quiet and Lithe to get a free escape if done correctly.
---
You say Killers are paytowin but Survivora have their fair share of dlc meta perks.
---
I don't like CI because some games the SWF will make the call to hide for the duration and those games are excruciating.
---
Also camping in way like using the insidious perk and the survivor as bait then yea thats a legit strat but face camping is terrible and toxic
---
Unique experience is not dropping the pallet trying to stun the killer?
---
Yes, thus ignoring the rest of my comment. So we‚Äôre both right.
---
It is simple really, no counter play. Almost every other killer in the game (including pre nerfed Nurse) had counter play but spirit says fuck that. Spirit hits you once, does some guess work and your downed. The only way to counter play her is to run a small perk pool like fixated, ironwill, lithe, dance with me, quick and quiet and urban evasion.
---
???
---
Yup. Camping (and extreme tunnelling) when done intentionally (i.e. After a long chase where the killer is all pissed off with one survivor) are the most toxic thing in the game. Only because it is self sacrifice. Ruining your own game in order to ruin the game of 1 survivor. It doesn't get more petty than that.
---
Yeah, sure. Hold on whilst I post a meme about it.
---
Uhh yeah how about no. The whole point of hex totems is that they are a gamble. You aren't owed not having your hex broken at the start of the match,  that's the risk you're taking when you put the perk in your loadout.
---
This. I really don't know how they expected to mindgame shack while outside the shack with the shack pallet down.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really matter who. Lmao.
---
&gt; Ruin
---
I've noticed that folks will DC if they even _observe_ a Ruin skill check. Playing Hag, I'm across the map making my mud doodles, and suddenly someone's gone already. Doesn't happen when I don't run it, and I'm not sure how to feel about that.
---
If its a big fuckin deal - then make it after the event - its that simple
---
&gt; Some survivors are shorter and harder to see
---
Right, I forgot about Claudette.
---
* Size
---
* Pain volume
---
* Breathing volume
---
Kate is technically the best survivor to play (smaller model, medium pain volume, low breathing volume).
---
I know it's not much but.. that's really the only difference.
---
OhTofu has a selection of guides [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqpGXoLSDNEUrBfACKnAhVA/search?query=loop) that are worth your time.
---
Also take the time to watch the [absolute best Huntress guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQRDijaX5Io) you will find online right now.
---
As the lattermost video will cover, Huntress is all about zoning. u/DamnNoHtml might have time to chip in with some specific advice on Haddonfield garages, if you're lucky.
---
&gt; Claudettes with certain outfits are nigh invisible
---
Yeah I noticed that the other day, entity displeased. Anyway, so on paper they all play the exact same, right?
---
The reason you're being downvoted is because that wasn't my original point and your initial reaction came across as passive aggressive.
---
Like Otz said, people get bullied and then run meta perks. Why waste your time with something fun like Stake Out when if the killer decides to be a fucker and suddenly you needed DS to not get tunneled to oblivion?
---
You took that and immediately thought I was complaining about being tunneled when that was just an example I was using. You kinda derailed the discussion.
---
I tend to not play her. more because I have really terrible hand eye coordination than any failing of the switch
---
Yea thats cool and all but have you had two survivors on your team leave the hatch on seperate occasions and leave you to die after its been closed twice üò¢
---
They‚Äôre a couple bucks each at Walmart
---
Once you've learned perks from the others, yup.
---
How does Dwight compare in size and volume?
---
&gt;I stopped enjoying his content when he pushed a video in which a Steve looped him around an unsafe pallet for 2 minutes without tru3 breaking it, causing gens to fly. He then proceeded to blame the game on SWF. He gets donations from fans to do specific builds, but complains about how terrible they are all game, timing out people who suggest that he‚Äôs complaining too much
---
I enjoy watching Tru3's videos and occasionally watching his stream, but there's no arguing with what you've said. I remember that Steve video haha.
---
I do think SWF teams can completely ruin a game in all honesty but that video didn't prove anything.
---
&gt;Billy's dash is also supposed to be used mid chase - if you are not using jt this way you just do it incorrectly 
---
If you can use it mid chase than either A) you have double charge add-ons or B) you're going against absolute potatoes- actually you're probably going against potatoes in both scenarios. Hillbilly has to charge, when he charges, he moves the speed of survivors. If you're going against someone who can properly work a loop, the only chance you'll get to use his chainsaw is in the open when there are no vaults or pallets around. 
---
&gt;Also demo is not better at destroying pallets at all - his shred pallets takes longer then pressing space ones the pallet is dropped if you dont predict it
---
I think he is. Hillbilly has to charge his chainsaw then go through the pallet break animation. Demo needs to hold their abilities for like 1 second and can immediately pounce, closing the gap and breaking the pallet. If we are talking about their abilities, i think demi is better than Hillbilly saw at breaking pallets. If we say demo isn't better than just breaking it normally, we have to consider the application. You need to walk up to a pallet to break it, that can take more time than pouncing to the pallet, quickly closing the gap and destroying the pallet. 
---
I don't know why people don't play demo, but acting like strength is the only factor is ridiculous. One factor could be that demo comes in a 12 dollar dlc, and people usually wont wanna buy characters separately unless they really main one side because if they wanna buy the rest of the characters in the future, it'll cost more than just buying the dlc bundle. Another factor could be that demo is unenjoyable to play as to some people, which doesn't = strength.
---
All the while survivor perks from the last 6 releases are just sat here like... umm Hi.?
---
/\ /\
---
Knowing my workplace, it‚Äôs either Ruin or Devour Hope
---
I liked the idea of removing the collision in phase walking and making sounds during phase walking all directions.
---
For a start you could have it where the totem doesn't light up until the Killer hits someone with NOED but that's another discussion entirely.
---
On topic of course in the case of there only being one dull totem it has to go there, and that's effectively the same as the Survivors cleansing all the totems before the endgame. But if there's more than one dull totem and a Survivor is cleansing one that one shouldn't be lit.
---
I've noticed you still haven't given any reason as to why a survivor deserves to escape with 5 gens still up, yet you have run off to other arguments.  
---
This is clearly going nowhere.
---
ju on / the grudge chapter is what we need
---
Please do not assault my Halloween decorations
---
Billy mindgames with the chainsaw just like demo.mindgames with his shred
---
12 dollars - while most survivors run with paid skins, dont make me laugh
---
Did you ever look at the killers we have and not notice your argument is not that smart?
---
If the time 1 gen left is longer than the time there are 2 3 4 or 5 gens left, you aren't good at applying pressure. And even if this were the case most of the time, at 1 gen, there's 3 gens to teleport to, so the point still stands
---
As someone who runs ds, it wasn't as big a nerf as you think, I call it a buff especially with the synergy you can have and how your basically invulnerable at the egt as soon as someone unhooks you. Anyone who calls it weak are seriously deluded especially since it's still run by 80% of higher tier survivors
---
Some are quieter and/or shorter than others, and some have cosmetics that make them harder to see.
---
That's all there is. It's part of the reason why running survivor is a relatively stress-free experience if the killer isn't sweating. Note that playing multiple killers is far more stressful, especially if you hope to exploit their powers rather than just running around with a "one size fits all" meta "regular M1 hit"/"slowdown" build.
---
Ruin gets used more in lower ranks btw. There's that sweetspot of 'high enough rank to have ruin' and 'low enough to think it is a fundamental'.
---
As soon as you start pushing 7/8 you will see the use of it diminish again.
---
I'm not telling what you thought, I'm telling you what you  said. You can say "I meant bugs and toxicity" but the fact is neither you nor him ever actually brought them up, so no you weren't talking about that.
---
Bubba
---
I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to the guy I commented to.
---
His logic is that survivor mains gets killer dailies to play killer. That means that killer mains should get survivor dailies. I am a killer main and I am still getting killer dailies.
---
Look I was lenient to them at first but it's already been almost a week and we have no ETA on its release and there's a very real chance it'll end up being released on or after Halloween. I wouldn't have a problem if they were being transparent and keeping us updated but this is ridiculous.
---
Freddy since he attacks his victims in dreams where they are helpless
---
Is it bugged?
---
Not pretty much the same mechanic. Demogorgon pounce is a longer lunge, chainsaw sprint is a sprint.
---
Billy has a harder time hitting his saw midchase than demogorgon does hitting his shred (provided the person playing demogorgon knows how to aim their shred)
---
&gt; Every day we get a ha-ha meme aimed at him
---
That‚Äôs because he acts like an asshat despite having one of the largest platforms in DBD, and only welcomes balance discussion if it aligns with his own personal beliefs. If you‚Äôre going to be a clown don‚Äôt be surprised when people find you silly.
---
this is not a best to worst tier list
---
This would encourage the killer to camp as they get rewarded for it. I saw some of your other comments about ‚Äúwhy is it bad to camp and tunnel‚Äù fun wise??? If you sit on one survivor all game it‚Äôs boring for others. You clearly haven‚Äôt been playing long to think this is viable strats
---
Probably Trapper or Myers. 
---
If we‚Äôre including their weapons than add Hillbilly or Bubba to that max.
---
Including powers, add Freddy to that mix.
---
I mean, imagine being the only semi relevant horror game on the market, just coming off a successful Stranger Things launch and needing to keep on players, maybe bring in the friends of the ST joiners and keep the game at the forefront of everyone‚Äôs mind. 
---
This is your chance! You make a horror game for pete‚Äôs sake! On top of that you have virtually no competition whatsoever! 
---
Nope. 3 days until Halloween and the 4 texture files you have to change for your glorified advertisement of the cosmetic shop is somehow having problems. 
---
BUT WE COULD‚ÄôVE SAID NOTHING ABOUT THE DELAY, OH COMMUNITY WHO PUTS UP WITH OUR SHIT, STILL BUYS OUR DLC AND COSMETICS EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE NEW BUGS EVERY WEEK; SO STOP WHINING. *12 off-handed comments about how toxic the community is next  dev stream*
---
ALSO MAKE US ANOTHER GUIDE FOR THE NEW PLAYERS COMING IN SINCE WE CAN‚ÄôT BE ARSED TO MAKE A REAL TUTORIAL. 
---
Tbh i can‚Äôt wait for a good asymmetrical game.
---
Demo pounce is a pounce, Billy sprint is a sprint and ghostface stalk is a stalk 
---
Both give you distance , both break pallets - one is shit
---
The OP didn‚Äôt state every killer. You are setting up a straw man. 
---
DBD is currently lower on Survivors. The game needs killers to be fun to play against. That will mean buffing weaker killers and changing (or nerfing) stronger ones. 
---
The game also needs to balance the SWF issue, either adding in coms or making Bond/kindred/a token counter as base survivor perks. This will likely need killers to be buffed in some way, but it will level the matches more.
---
Not in the game. He is vulnerable.
---
Weird flex but I've always wanted Medusa to be a killer - I can see her being able to freeze survivors by making eye contact, and it'd take a skill check or two to unfreeze, idk?
---
Or less if the survivors are any good at looping
---
hm not really, the reason freddy is strong in dreams because he gets power off the fear of his victims, i doubt killers would be afraid because they are mentally unstable and dont feel afraid.
---
Well, they could be close by or they could be in a locker.
---
It was quite a while ago and he puts out loads of videos every day so the chances of me finding it now would be pretty slim :(
---
If I do find it I will link it though
---
I absolutely agree different doesn't inherently mean good, as Legion is pretty bad, coming from someone who plays them regularly.
---
But different can be fun if it isn't annoying, and OP doesn't find mending annoying enough to counteract the back-and-forth chases at windows and dropped pallets.
---
It dropped off the face of the Earth due to long legal issue that made it so that they couldn't add any more content no matter what in all actuality that game had a lot more to do
---
Credit to u/TheCowrus for the image
---
2039 maybe?
---
Yeah for sure. But how often are all 3 survivors in lockers. Not much haha.
---
Unfortunately, as the video covers, high walls are not Huntress' forte. I'd say the trick is not to get baited into any strong loops, and save your hatchets for when you're moving *between* loops - which is something the survivor will have to do eventually (usually after slamming a pallet).
---
Better analogy: Last night I was in the mood for pie but it's 7am now and eating pie doesn't sound nearly as good.
---
I hover around rank 4 to 5 and there are many many games i would say every second ruin game where every survivor dies with only 1 or 2 gennys done. Id like to know when exactly i get a team that knows how to play against ruin. Because if i need to be rank 1 and 2 before this perk doesnt dominate my games then the pwrk needs to be tweaked.
---
Pay2win doesn't necessarily mean you can't advance unless you pay. It just means it makes it a lot easier. You said it yourself you can climb ranks if youre experienced which is a good thing. But the paywall killers don't require to have AS MUCH experience to get to higher ranks because their abilities are strong from day 1.
---
Also you saying that survivors are pay2win is true but here's the gripe i have. When a killer is pay2win it is at the cost of 4 other players enjoyment of the game. 4 survivors have a much more difficult time playing around pay2win killers because frankly the abilities can be a bit over the top. When a survivor is pay2win it still heavily relies on your teammates to take advantage of your dlc strengths. What good is being able to heal yourself in 8 seconds so the team doesnt suffer from thana if your team doesnt know how to juke a killer or plan which gennys to work on? When a killer is OP, 4 players suffer. When a survivor is OP you still need to not have bad teammates. Your argument would be fair if most survivors had dlc perks but tbh i havent seen DS in months. But ive seen more legions, ghostfaces and freddies than i have hillbillies, nurses and mikes. Even when you do see classic killers they usually have dlc perks fro  the newer ones.
---
pop pop
---
How is it a free win? That‚Äôs like saying going against a bad team is a free win? This game is all about RNG. People can‚Äôt demand a 4K every game and the hatch brings tension to a shitty game. If a survivor brings a key (rare item in the blood web), is able to survive being the last remaining, and is able to find the hatch isn‚Äôt a free win. They‚Äôve invested into escaping through the hatch, let them get the reward. Plus it makes cool compilation videos about the experience.
---
Or ya know a 4man with instas but yeah 50/50 what you get.
---
But the problem here lies in that the hatch is a Skilless mechanic. Yes, it sucks to get placed with 3 idiots who all go down super fast and waste pallets. But the Survivor side is a team. Why should someone, while being better then the others, just get a free escape that was not earned since their team wasn't good enough? Your not supposed to win every one, but think of how often 1 person escapes, which is usually an auto black pip, and a "win" for that person, versus how often the killer manages to get a 4k, which is a "win" persay, though not really. The hatch is complete RNG. It might spawn right next to some idiot hiding in shack for the last 2 minutes, or it might spawn in the middle of buttfuck nowhere. Thats why people complain about it, including True. If you get stuck with a bad hand, you should have to skill your way out of it, not get a free ride out of it cause you got lucky. At least, thats my opinon.
---
Fine. I got you wrong. My bad.
---
BELIEVE IT!
---
I've recently started playing with in-ear headphones rather than open over-ear headphones, and the noise isolation makes it much easier to hear details like this. Hex totems make a crackling noise that can be heard in a small radius around them, even through walls.
---
So my tip is to either use closed headphones that provide a good seal, or better yet, in-ear headphones. The audio balance in DbD is unfortunately a little harsh, so if you have your volume levels up enough to be able to distinctively distinguish details, louder sound effects like screams and proximity and chase music can be a little much.
---
Dbd is low on survivors because they are less and less exploits for survivors like infinites
---
Ifound jt funny that lower tier killers are fun because survivors win more - thats all
---
There are plenty of unexpected things that can happen in development. You can think everything is ready then encounter a critical bug that depending on the cause can take a while to fix.
---
But let‚Äôs face it, if it was released on time with a bad bug, people would be bitching about releasing a buggy update. There is literally no way for them to win in this situation because of the  entitled attitude of many gamers who want things 100% bug free immediately.
---
is that spoiler for chucky
---
Don‚Äôt run thana, unless it got a buff that I‚Äôm not aware of, its garbage
---
The biggest BS about hatches and keys is that if a survivor has a key and is near the hatch you can't do anything to him. You cannot grab him. You cannot close the hatch. Nah, get fucked.
---
I had a game a few hours ago where I faced extremely toxic survivor who played stealth the whole game and sold his teammates to find the hatch. I was playing GhostFace and since I had I'm all Ears I saw him vaulting a window nearby, quickly approached him and closed the hatch in front of his face. He just opened it and gone to shit how bad am I on killers and how "ezzz" this win was. Disgusting.  
---
I met him a few games later. I was on the GhostFace again, but I took a mori. Downed him and his teammate and just teabagged and spammed mori into his face for like 5 minutes until he almost bled out and then I killed him. GGEz you fucker.
---
Same Kinda vibe as when Shroud calmly sips his tea while flicking a sniper headshot?
---
what is tunneling and camping in this game?
---
That's some wicked bad luck then, unfortunately. 
---
If you're comfortable with probability then I did a breakdown for another player as they were trying to farm out their last perks, you can find that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dekr08/weekly_no_stupid_questions_thread_october_07_2019/f38hyqv/). The short version is that the more perks you have appearing in the Bloodweb, the easier your search will be.
---
I really don't recommend you Prestige, because you reset all progress to zero, the odds of you getting the perk you want are radically diminished, and if Ghost Face is your main Bloodpoint source then you're going to have a horrific time as you slowly level them back up.
---
Yeah camping definitely isn't efficient and I didn't say it is. I never camp because it's boring. But if somebody gets unhooked 3 seconds after I turn away from them I'm going to go after the easier target plain and simple. It's definitely better to have one person on a hook rather than two people injured. And that's why I'm proposing this idea, encourage me to go after the rescuer rather than the person who was rescued.
---
I mean, it depends on how in depth you wanna go. wraith and spirit would be super strong due to invisibility. spirit would have amazing surprise attacks, and if it was more like a battle royale, wraith could just stand still till the other last person isn‚Äôt expecting anything. trapper would probably be useless, as well as pig because their abilities rely on their enemies being powerless. . billy and bubba wouldn‚Äôt be very good either due to the killers all being incredibly resilient and their lack of intelligence in combat I would assume. due to plagues ability never truly killing, and her weapon, she‚Äôd be one of the first to fall. Freddy‚Äôs weapon is weak compared to others, but I think his dream world shit would be super strong on the main contenders, assuming they have to sleep. realistically, I think it would be a game of chance for most, and would really just rely on their in the moment combat skills and long term strategic thinking.
---
If they got space kook and he did that laugh every time he hit someone that would be great lol
---
üëÄ
---
man they‚Äôre always smackin the hell outta villains in Scooby doo there are no excuses
---
Sloppy to help you get aura reads with Nurse‚Äôs more frequently.
---
I‚Äôd actually love a killer vs. killer game mode. That shit would be so fun. I‚Äôm putting this here only because I saw ‚ÄúBattle Royale‚Äù.
---
That's what I was thinking. Rarely do you get to utilize the full potential of Thanatophobia as Wraith.
---
Any legion mains have advice for builds and/or strategies for optimal use of his power?
---
I've seen Umbra ready a hatchet and moon walk high walls then whip around and just catch them as they try and get around a corner. So I've tried that to exceptionally limited success, which is to say none. None success lol.
---
So yeah I've just been forcing the pallet if there's no window then checking gens or just leaving entirely if there is a window. Just frustrating after only playing killers who can play around them well.
---
Survivors like to treat the game as a 1v1 game and for most of the patches, the game allowed them this
---
Why are there so much strode offerings used with balanced landings? Survivors like to abuse game mechanics
---
Meanwhile its not a 1v1 game, a perfect balanced game according to devs is 2 dead 2 escaped 
---
Survivors like to win - that's why OP put clown and wraith so high
---
I do, just for that extra combined 2% luck at p3 /s, to be honest I just enjoy the grind, and some of the bloody cosmetics are good
---
I clenched my butt cheeks like holy shit
---
7 minutes?
---
I've been saying this since launch, although Jack Torrance would be a fun licensed char.
---
Not the idea if the idea is stacking buffs
---
i was going to take a hit for mine We're Gonna Live Forever¬†
---
Thanks!
---
LOL Its soo true
---
GhostFace cause he‚Äôs smart.
---
.
---
Kindred trumps all, even stealth killers after their buff
---
Turn around Laurie!
---
It‚Äôs a meme
---
*tasty*
---
Field Hockey player you say... And named Shelley? Is crypt tv giving a little nod to Jason and Friday the 13th part 3?
---
He called it Friday the 13th but worse
---
You saying this should happen after hatch is just suggesting making end game hatch more in survivors favor
---
On this thread. Make your choice doesn‚Äôt need a change at all. Plus 15m radius would promote camping and it won‚Äôt help the killer as you will proxy camp and loser chaser points
---
It‚Äôs a meme read it and get them meme seriously though one of the top posts today is someone whining over Tru3 and the comments circle jerking
---
I run it as well, and as much as i do prefer it in its current form over the old way. Its still not as good as it was.
---
I've prestiged 4 characters, working on my 5th. At a certain point, you run out of stuff to grind for anyways.
---
2 stalk boys in white masks with knives would like to talk
---
So it's bad because you haven't adjusted to your pounce range? That's a you issue
---
So it's bad because you can't land your hits? Again, moreso a you problem. Its not easy to land consistently by any means, but a demo who knows how to pounce will land pounce hits. And not rewarding? Okay. Let's ignore the fact that the pounce let's you hit a survivor you would've had no way of hitting. Literally an extended lunge.
---
The drawback needs to be huge because it makes quite a bit of distance. If the drawback wasn't huge, people would spam it to get around, which is not it's purpose. Similar to how players spammed lunge in frenzy to get to places faster when legion first came out.
---
The pallet destroying is not slow. It's actually really useful mid chase. It's a pretty good speed
---
That Claud had some mighty lady balls to stay that far into endgame collapse for the save. I would have dipped. Mad respect.
---
As Wraith, I would definitely say Sloppy Butcher. But you might benefit most from a perk that slows down gens.
---
Also keep in mind that Wraith does have an addon that applies the Mangled effect when hitting a surprise attack on survivors, which is basically the equivalent of Sloppy.
---
Thought that was Jason‚Äôs schtick
---
Yum
---
I for one love when I get salty messages on PS4. I say what I need to and block them right after.
---
It's when he or she is looking towards you within the range of the perk. You have to use your knowledge of the current game to figure out the direction they're coming from.
---
No i get that but im confused because survivor mains usually dont say stop complaining about the killers
---
And they kind of succeeded when they added demo. It‚Äôs scary as hell to hear that theme as the footsteps get closer
---
That tiny med kit is so cute! It might even have tiny add ons!  
---
Great work, guys.
---
Everyone likes to abuse game mechanics. Spirit players hit and then phase with strider for an easy down. People play nurse with omega blink and make your choice. 
---
Balance issues exist on both sides.
---
Wow
---
But kindred says that it ‚Äútrumps any of the killers stealth abilities‚Äù and if they nerfed it would become a pretty useless perk as there‚Äôs no point in revealing a face camping killer
---
Ah yeah Tofu is great, I've actually played against him a few times. But like I said, streamers are incredibly good so usually they do win since it's kinda their job lol. I certainly couldn't say I myself could get a 4k with wraith at rank one. I used to play a lot of pig and saw success with her a fair number of times. Also I have a hypothesis that rank one survivors just mess around since they are already rank 1 there is no need to try hard. Usually those really hard swf games are few and far between, it's just not a fun time getting flexed on lol. From my experience the purple ranks and the green ranks are more difficult. Either that or I'm used to all survivors going for risky stuff so when they play safe it throws me off lol.
---
How to turn straight men into homosexuals with this one little trick! CLICK HERE
---
I don't main Legion, but one of the most optimal things to do is run Enduring/Spirit Fury and use pallets to cancel their power rather than ending it yourself or letting it run out naturally.
---
Why do profesional players say he is bad then ? Do you accept any critisicm at all?
---
Oh lets look at his portals - 12 seconds to clear that - you can't surely say they are good
---
One fo the top posts today is a post shitting on Tru3 and everyone in the comments is circle jerking how he complains about things a lot while they complain about shit constantly the biggest thing people call him out for is whining but I thats like small parts of his stream that they are taking to make him look bad who gives a shit if he whines about annoying things like hatch or infinites
---
Ok and? I mean who gives a rats ass of you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs funny
---
I think you're slightly exaggerating. How you even can make "instantly ending" chases even faster.
---
Little creature of the black lagoon vibes
---
Sloppy is much, much better. But it's also the most obnoxious perk in the game. It'll work really well on that Wraith build tho
---
Yes that's my point - players like to win - that's why he is enjoing low tier killers, not because they are fun or unfun to play
---
The Nea was behind everyone including the Legion.
---
Hence why everyone took hits to distract the Legion
---
Just an average Tuesday for Shia LaBeouf
---
No, but seriously. Not sure what backend-update shenanigans they released last week, but my games have been unstable since then, SWF D/Cs, massive latency, unable to spectate matches YOU NAAAAAME IT. And as bugged as this game already is, for them to cancel an update a week after their major announcement stream and 24hrs before going live, do you know how fucked that build had to be? They definitely unlocked a new stage of low expectations with this one. And I'm still going to log on and play that mofo.
---
Accurate, don‚Äôt know how anyone can stand watching him.
---
WAAAAH YOU WASTED THE PALLET!! Omg cry about it
---
That doesn‚Äôt sound like something he‚Äôd do or even talk about anyways I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be against being in a horror game I mean who would that would be fucking awesome
---
It is like calling survivors toxic for hiding all game and trying to escape. 
---
The only thing that is unforgivable is BM. Anything else like camping, tunneling, rushing pallets e.t.c is legitimate strategy and must not be blamed.
---
I just want Cropsey as a killer
---
I only do it to give me something to work towards as i‚Äôm nearly done with needing bloodpoints. I have 2 Survivors at P3 with all perks and then the rest are just P3 level 50 apart from Dwight and Ace who i‚Äôm prestiging right now. I don‚Äôt prestige Killers so just dump BP into them for perks and i‚Äôm around 20 million BP off having every perk on every Killer.
---
LOL what the fuck does tool have to do with anything? That was very random.
---
I want Candyman and the Xenomorph
---
Ever heard of a joke u idiot
---
you realize that the company is big and there isnt 500 developers working on dbd right lmao
---
Oh okay. Well, that‚Äôs a little disappointing but what can ya do. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è well, thanks for sharing. üëä
---
Unless you put hundreds of hours into an ability you wont get perfect pounces every game , also survivors can counterplay and you will miss a few pounces
---
But unlike Billy, a hit chainsaw is rewarding - pounce isnt as much
---
Also his portals need to be activated to be cleansed. - which takes at least 5 and a half second for the fastest travel
---
Well that's a huge generalization. I've been listening to them for decades and have never thought of myself as superior. Shit there are some K-pop girl band songs that I love because they're catchy. I don't think I'm better than anyone based on their music preferences. But hey if you want to stereotype people you do you.
---
I cant find a lobby as survivor. There is always a network error and the matchmaking system has been trash since dedicated servers.
---
Depends on the killer.
---
I use corrupt instead of ruin with killers that make good use of pop/thana, like plague, legion, ghostface, etc. Most other killers I'll use ruin
---
Do you understand he can make all worst fears come true? I bet all killers have fears. For example they must be scared of the Entity, especially those like Trapper or Doctor
---
&gt;Do you actually think it makes sense to get punished for killing all 4 survivors within 2 minutes? Or to get punished when playing against a bad killer because you never once got chased or had to unhook or heal anyone? I'm not saying these things happen often, but it makes no sense for either the killers or the survivors to get punished and depip for either of those scenarios.
---
If you manage to kill all survivors in 2 minutes, that's an issue of matchmaking and not the scoring system.  You should never be able to get a 4k in less than 2 minutes under any circumstances.  In both scenarios, you would only depip in red ranks.
---
I get what you're saying, but the reality is that those scenarios are so rare that you will still end up at the rank you belong based on your skill as that role.  Trying to dictate gameplay based on an edge-case just leads to more broken gameplay.  The couple of times I've clearly outmatched the survivor team, I generally get the first 2 kills and then farm the last one or two (while letting them farm some gen/heal/chase points)
---
okay i will do that
---
The fastest cleaver in shadow realms
---
Ooooh I only saw the Nancy
---
to escape you‚Äôve gotta unmask
---
I want John wick
---
I'm having all those problems. I cant find a lobby as survivor. I spend most of the time waiting on some load screen.
---
I don't see any reason to punish the killer for using their power optimally. It should be 3 seconds regardless.
---
Lorewise he is the strongest. Game mechanics hinder him, otherwise he would be too OP.
---
You sound like a real fun guy
---
Thrust me Daddy Myers
---
&gt; I'm not sure I'd want to see a Huntress that can loop just as easily as hitting you with a hatchet before you even enter the loop.
---
I'm not sure what you're saying here

 r/dbdgonewild
---
You'd be surprised.
---
It had a tiny insta heal with seemingly unlimited charges.
---
Demo would probably have the best chance considering he‚Äôs a unstoppable killing machine Nurse is to frail. Legion stands no chance. Ghost Face is just human he may be the smartest killer by far but I don‚Äôt think he could win, Hags power wouldny help her. Myers May be strong but he‚Äôs still just human same thing with. Trapper ,Bubba Clown ,Wraith ,Hillbilly, maybe .Bubba/Billy‚Äôs Chainsaw could help them but I haven‚Äôt watch to to much Stranger Things Spirit May have a chance but if still day demo Plagues sickness probably wouldn‚Äôt effect Demo to much Huntress is strong but again only human. Pig would get her ask kicked. Freddy relies on Fear to take down his enemies and then being asleep first off we don‚Äôt even know if Demo sleeps/Dreams and obviously does not feel fear so he‚Äôd be able to beat Freddy so yeah 
---
Demo would take the win
---
In terms of the actual characters and lore, Myers or Freddy. None of the others even come close.
---
What's your problem
---
I honestly don't think that I can rank them based on the actual killer itself, certain killer players ruin killers for me. I love Demo, but his playerbase is cancerous. They just portal camp all game long once they hook someone. The killer themselves are great, but the way the players optimize it is annoying.
---
But I'll try anyways, favorites would probably be Ghost Face, he's just fun, there's really nothing more, he doesn't feel unfair or oppressive. I also love Doctor, I'm a gen jockey and though it's annoying at times, it's great practice for hitting skill checks. 
---
My least favorite since day one is Billy. Again, the way people play him. They just sit on your ass the entire chase revving the chainsaw. I honestly belive that in any game, one shot gimmicks are bullshit unless it rewards you, for example, a FPS, a precise hit to the head, that's fine. Or if it penalizes you for doing it, such as Ghost Face or Myers where they give up speed, you can also hide from it to prevent it. Even Leatherface, he becomes so slow when revving and also has to be precise in close quarters so he doesn't do that long animation after hitting a wall by mistake. But Billy? He can just walk at you due to being so fast, suddenly charge at you, doesn't have a lengthy animation like Leatherface for hitting something. On top of that, he can just sprint around causing constant pressure. Billy is bullshit, he just needs some type of penalty for using his chainsaw and I'll be happy.

I still don't understand why everyone keeps saying it would promote camping. Yeah maybe a small number of toxic killers it would but not the majority. I run PGTW and as soon as I hook somebody I'm trying to get to the nearest generator with any progress on it so I can pop it. My goal is to slow down generator repairs to give myself more time to hunt down survivors. So no I don't think for most Killers it would promote camping. But it seems like most survivors have the mindset that every killer is toxic all they want to do is camp. If you have that mindset that I can definitely understand why you think this would only promote camping.
---
That is funny xd
---
...what? But he's NOT, he's in WALKING DEAD. He's a guy that will bash other people's heads in, just to keep the rest of the 'herd' in line.
---
He's a horror character.
---
Nah if the trap is active (a gen is finished after it's placed) then it'll automatically go off if they try and leave through the gates. It won't go off if they use the hatch, though.
---
&gt;SWF with voice comms, which are basically cheats.
---
BHVR has confirmed that voice conms are not cheating. [Link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/chdykz/we_all_knew_this_anyway_but_now_bhvr_have/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
A lot of those instances Otz goes for another person is because he is pressuring the survivors equally to prevent gens.
---
Sometimes he goes for less optimal plays for the fun value of it, but he does everything within the mindset that he is still in control which more often than not gives him a 4k.
---
He is competitive but doesn't take the game too seriously, which is why I enjoy his content so much. It also probably helps him as he is less likely to get tilted
---
The Grey Lady from *Thief: Deadly Shadows* would make for a cool shapeshifting killer.
---
Demogorgon can probably kill him. For all we know, that thing doesn't even sleep. Bullets don't have any affect on it either. So knives and other crude weaponry won't really do much.
---
Absolutely agree. I play both sides. I see how unfair spirit can be/seem with BBQ when you are injured. Phases right to you and not much you can do. I see how hard it can be to play killer on Springfield. Balanced landing, even exhausted, is a huge issue there. 
---
Hag and Wraith needed their buffs (setting time and windstorm built in).
---
There needs to be buffs and nerfs all around. Killer mains complained when Nurse is bing nerfed, but I think she is more fun to play as and against now (played in the PTB).
---
When they nerf, they need to do it right. When they nerfed Mettle of Man, it was wrong. Now people throw games just to meme and try to get it to work. It was nerfed badly.
---
I would just take the head for more snoot!
---
I can see him being a crime lord who makes people bow as his feet just as well, his character isn't horror, it's ruthless.
---
How lol
---
It's irrelevant how the character is written in literature. It has been portrayed as an overly cliche clown preying on unimaginative horror cliche concepts. This is how everyone views Pennywise now. It doesn't really class as a traditional horror.
---
Also learn to read before being obnoxious. IMO = in my opinion. Or are you really that insecure that you can't handle other people having opinions?
---
But here‚Äôs the thing she‚Äôs not that smart she‚Äôs still has the brain of a child imo 
---
Ghost Face could probably sneak up on her and killer her with a neck slice since he‚Äôs the smartest of all the killers next to Doctor but Doctor has more scientific knowledge but Ghost Face is the clear winner as a smart and tactical killer 
---
Myers could probably sneak up on her to and he‚Äôs a fucking tank
---
Billy‚Äôs Chainsaw is terrifying and he‚Äôs moved super fast 
---
But most of all Demo could take her down and every other killer for that matter first off he can teleport and move around the area has a super strong unstoppable beast he has the the extinct to take her down and she‚Äôs never hunted something like Demo
---
The Official Forums are terrible... So much banning, shadowbanning and topics being deleted there you might as well not stay on top of the news about DBD then get it there because it's only what they want you to see that get's bast the mods for longer then 2h.
---
I don't main Legion, but I'd suggest Ruin or Corrupt Intervention, Thrilling Tremors, Thanatophobia, and Save the Best for Last.
---
Legion will build Save the Best for Last stacks very quickly, due to their power, and they have no problems keeping people injured. The slowdown perk buys you time to get people Injured (Ruin buys time, Corrupt Intervention guarantees time *and* forces the survivors to group up), and Thrilling Tremors means you'll usually know where survivors are hiding even if they hide in a locker (which would counter Barbecue &amp; Chilli).
---
Once you have max stacks of Save the Best for Last, you'll be able to down whole clusters of survivors faster than they can react to you - but you need to play very aggressively, and make good use of Feral Frenzy for travel and building perk stacks.
---
Iron will helps quite a bit
---
That does sound like an interesting perk and I'll definitely have to unlock it to try it out. Thanks for your constructive criticism instead of just saying that this would promote camping.
---
Ive got about 1200 hours and i know maps dont show up very often but ive used a lot of rainbow maps and if anything you should start uaing Plunderers and just search chests for keys and maps
---
Glad we could agree on that
---
"Tim, whatre you doing over there? The line in the drive thru is around the corner!"
---
What rank are you?
---
Did flashlight saves get changed? Ever since the patch we‚Äôre playing got issued, I‚Äôve had a harder time doing the saves when before I knew the perfect timing for the animation to get an insta blind (a bit after mid pick up of a survivor)
---
oh no
---
Nice, I‚Äôm always glad to see people trying killers that aren‚Äôt the Top 3. Wraith is my fav actually. Lots of fun builds you can do with him (surprise no bell, anti-gen, speedy boi, etc). 
---
If you unlock the teachables, Pop Goes the Weasel and Save the Best for Last are both very strong on him. 
---
Good luck!
---
A good counter is to click Clr + F4 on your keyboard
---
The zero TR thing is pretty interesting.
---
I made post suggesting a legion buff like 2 days ago
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dn3onn/my_suggestion_for_a_legion_buff/
---
Blindness in DbD makes sense since it takes away your aura reading ability. The name is a bit incorrect though. Aura Blindness would better show the true effect of this debuff
---
Isn‚Äôt that just like the spirit lmao
---
What if legions feral frenzy movement speed got faster for every survivor you hit
---
Just recently started playing killer again and am trying to get Ghostface to P3 to relive the old days of having that bloody Ghostface make everyone and their dog wore on Halloween.
---
All totem build, try for grabs.
---
&gt; *Just frustrating after only playing killers who can play around them well.*
---
What I'm saying is that, if she was a stronger looper *in addition to* being able to hit you before and after the loop, what would her weak point be?
---
Who you calling pin head
---
Sadako Yamamura (Original Japanese Version) or Samara Morgan (Westernized Version)?
---
Personally, I'd like the original version because it's worth paying tribute to the origins of something we enjoy.
---
I played a Plague match a while back and the survivors told me my perks and add-ons were OP.
---
I had Enduring/Spirit Fury/Ruin/Discordance and Ashen Apple/Severed Toe
---
They were a 4 stack with a Skeleton Key, Instaheal, BNP, and Rainbow Map
---
Some people, I swear
---
Yeah pretty stupid indeed. Then again lots of add ons are broken in the game. Mori's are also broken as they're basically a free win button. Instaheals are too, but being nerfed. Lots of weird design decisions. Not even mentioning maps haha
---
What about him? You have to pay for his skin with cells now.
---
2 chains, PGTW, Dying Light, Thanatophobia, Thrilling tremors, freddy. You are welcome
---
As a Legion main, I get rituals for killers I don‚Äôt own.
---
You ever get it figured out? I'm stuck with Nat 3. I've tried opening the ports and everything but it hasn't changed.
---
Your "opinion" is based by the looks of the killer and is blalantly superficial - IT is much more deep and complex in its lore but an illiterate like you is so ignorant that you dont even want to put a little work into that - that's why your "opinion" is worth just as much as people saying demo shouldnt be in game:
---
Worthless
---
You are literally arguing it isn't acceptable.  How is there any confusion here?  Your entire argument is that it isn't fair they get to use the hatch and deprive you of a 4k.
---
DBD is an asymmetric PVP game.  That means you're going to have asymmetric rules and asymmetric objectives.  The killer relies solely on themselves to complete their objectives.  The survivors must rely on their teammates, which if you are following the spirit of the game, you have zero communication with.  The hatch is a "get out of jail free card" because it provides the survivor a minuscule chance to not die even in the worst circumstances.
---
These days I usually just chase countdown from 15 and slam 'em into the dirt... if... IF I want to tunnel a survivor, I usually go for the dumbass savior that tries to get his teammate killed and camp him into phase 2 then I walk away!
---
I don't know why people are giving him shit for giving his opinion for balance based on his experience as both a killer and survivor. This thread seems like it was composed of people who don't watch any of his content but have a perception that he's an asshole because others deem so or they just saw this one video.
---
I agree that the hatch game was dumb from the get-go and the endgame should rely on the survivability of the last survivor until the gates are opened automatically.
---
* The Endgame collapse should trigger when the last survivor is alive.
---
* The bar above will indicate the timer and will have markers that will tick every # seconds, that will grant the killer with the ability of seeing the survivor's aura for 5 seconds. The aura is meant to prevent the player from hiding the entire duration of the end game, this means lockers won't help you. Saving pallets and getting as many generators as you can, which I will go more in the next bullet point, will determine if the endgame will be easier or harder for the last survivor.
---
* Depending on how many gens were left will determine the duration of which an exit gate will open. Say you have 2 gens left, each will add 30 seconds to the timer until the first exit gate is powered.
---
* Once the first exit gate is activated, it will take an additional 30 seconds for the second one to open.
---
* Award more points for triggering/participating in the event and completing the event.
---
Love this! Did you have more?
---
why not all three?
---
No problem. I have a lot of fun with Surge and Infectious Fright together. Anytime you down someone, people in the area scream and gens are kicked. It plays with people a bit. Very fun when people try to continue working on a gen around you.
---
As a legion main, you‚Äôve offended me.
---
&gt; The survivors would have to give it a real second glance to make sure they weren't running to the next gen with the killer right there with them.
---
Wasn't something like that attempted with the legion?
---
If they had THAT crucial a bug, then why not TELL US?
---
They literally skipped anything for the 3rd Anniversary except the decorations and the cakes, and did NO Scorching Summer Event. SUPPOSEDLY so that this event would be 'perfect'. And here we are, almost to Halloween...nada. They're instead promoting some weird cross event thing on Halloween itself, and we're still just sitting here, WAITING on some freaking news.
---
MAYBE they shouldn't have tied this Halloween event's serum to the Rift? Because I can only assume that the 'unforseen' circumstances are tied to the battle pass, and people were just getting through it too quickly for their liking.
---
Honestly, the Hillbilly is the killer I was least excited to do next to the Demogorgan - we all know he's Dollar-Store Leatherface and I didn't want to burn any good ideas on Billy I could use on Leatherpapi. Also it really didn't help that Billy has pretty weak add-on iconography, it's not like I could have included a primer bulb, speed limiter, or depth guage rake, etc, without people having no fucking clue what they are other than random machine parts. Overall, however, I'm actually pretty stoked on this one.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
To answer some common questions:
---
&gt; "Are you / when are you going to do X killer?"
---
Yes, I'm planning to do all of them, including Demogorgan and whoever else gets revealed. I don't have them planned out in terms of when I'm doing which killer - just kinda of letting it happen.
---
&gt; "Are you going to do the survivors?"
---
No. I did Dwight because he's my boy (and I wanted to do a pizzagram), but generally speaking the survivors aren't as visually interesting and they don't have the sort of strong iconography that makes doing the killers engaging from a design perspective. Oh, and also I'm shit at doing faces (as you can see with my Dwight). And no technology exists capable of making colors bright enough to accurately depict like 98% of Min's outfits. 
---
&gt; "Can I use this design for a tattoo?"
---
My stance on tattoo design is to contact me via DM and we can hash out the details but, generally, yeah, I'm cool with that.
---
&gt; What equipment/apps do you use?
---
Most of the work is done in Procreate on an ipad / apple pencil combo with some occasional photoshop involved. 
---
&gt; What else do you work on?
---
Quite a bit - I'm also working on hashing out a [Fallout series](https://i.imgur.com/OjxZuoT.jpg) similar to this one, working on two seperate sets of tarot cards (one based on my [own designs](https://i.imgur.com/kwbBgl2.jpg) and one based on [hiphop / rap artists](https://i.imgur.com/Fky8eva.jpg)), regularly doing pieces based on Ari Aster's films [Hereditary](https://i.imgur.com/bm1gcmO.jpg) and [Midsommar](https://i.imgur.com/Vf5PIhP.jpg), and I'm also a [nightscape photographer](https://www.instagram.com/davecarender/)... so I stay busy. 
---
&gt; Are you making stickers / prints?
---
Yes. The plan is to do both once the series is finished - stay tuned, or check my IG for the latest about it. 
---
More of my work can be found on my IG at: [@gopencyprep](https://www.instagram.com/gopencyprep/) give it a follow.

Adrenaline rewards you because you played well.
---
NOED rewards you because you played bad.
---
My Spirit is now P1-42 and I get at least a ring or a beads each bloodweb since lvl. 35 or so, so if P2, and P3 are going to up the chance of rare items even more appearing (even though probably only a few %) I can't really complain.
---
*me wanting Jeepers Creepers, even though he won‚Äôt get in cause of the diddling of kids*
---
I stay around Rank 10. Now listen, I play the game almost exactly 50/50 Survivor and killer. And I get tunneled from time to time and will send a simple message to the killer telling them they didn't need to do that. I never make it a point to tunnel and more often than not attempt to avoid it. I've only ever received one single message from someone accusing me and being salty about me tunneling them. But the fact remains that if there are two people running away from a hook and one of them is injured it is more efficient to down them and re hook them plain and simple. It's much better to have one person on a hook then two people injured, there's no arguing that fact. I'm not trying to justify or promote tunneling as, again, I usually go out of my way to avoid it. But if I'm against a sweaty swf 4 to 6 ranks higher than me then I am going to go for the easier target and try and take them out of the game sooner.
---
Is he fucking eating Chef Boi-r-dee or however the fuck you spell it?
---
Lmao. Illiterate. Maybe look up what that word means. Oh the irony. 
---
Yes my opinion was based off of general look and feel. I don't give a fuck if a paragraph in the book says otherwise.
---
I don't mind demo. At least he his gritty and real.
---
Imagine letting someone elses opinion get to you this much.
---
Witty response, employer!
---
Legion &amp; The Pig, I'm sure, yeah.
---
Yea but there both perks that get complained about
---
I can totally see this, and they could have the giant cat people from Zombie Island as the killer
---
I think people *get* competitive when playing this, similar to a game of Monopoly or Mario Party, but it's very hard for an asymmetrical game to be balanced competitively and still remain fun. The whole "balance everything to the highest level of skill" thing falls apart when the same tools aren't available to everyone in game.
---
The n/a get given for free now
---
They are now, Steam is often a bit delayed with actually applying the sales during the first few minutes.

Last major flashlight change was Patch 2.3.0 in October 2018. 
---
If you're on PC then it *could* be a discrepancy due to dedicated servers - what looks good on your screen is not necessarily what the server believes is happening.
---
Still remember getting hype for Jason X and how they revealed him. Sucks that all of that went away a few weeks later with the announcement of no more content.
---
Yup
---
To me it feel kinda weird to not prestige your characters, you don't have the same sense of accomplishement than if you don't, and if you change your mind, you spent all that BP on a P1 character for nothing !
---
Better do it now than later.
---
How does Dying Light give a second chance? It‚Äôs literally a general purpose slowdown perk that rewards you for doing your job. As for Blood Warden, it exists to encourage people to GTFO. Moris aren‚Äôt second chance at all, since they don‚Äôt help you actually recover from a mistake. They are, however, an unfun mechanic, and NOED is a fucking mistake and unless you decide to fuck around and make an endgame build, it encourages terrible habits.
---
Just because you can see that, doesn't make him so, though.
---
He was a used cars salesman before the Zombie Apocalypse, and he's tied into a horror franchise. That makes the character a horror character.
---
That's kind of like saying that because Ash was in Army of Darkness, he's not really a horror icon despite Evil Dead 1 and 2. Kind of see what I mean?
---
He is pragmatic, is ultimately what he is. He does what he can to try to 'save' people, in his mind.
---
There are two things that I think add nothing to the game and are a crutch for bad players. NOED/instant downs and instant heals.
---
noice
---
New killer: the virus
---
They got people psyched for a release and aren‚Äôt doing it on time. Sure, it happens. However, this is still a pretty small community. It would help to ease some tensions to provide assurance that at least a double BP event would take place during Halloween for their horror game.

Lionsgate owns the licenses and there is currently a Lionsgate sale going on

Oh, I wasn't saying that she should be. Not sure how you got that from my comment. I'm just saying it's frustrating after being so used to just running high walls normally. That's all
---
Hmm yeah!
---
My opinion is based on general look - meanwhile demo's base skin looks horrible
---
Yes you are illiterate because you can't even read the book before saying shit like - clown is squeaky
---
I will remind you about this convo while pennywise is released next chapter ;)
---
Same with Adrenaline
---
I get that question haha. It was originally a simple mask for other cosplay and then I make a thick layer of paper on top of it, to make the split you see on the mask, but I made the split where my eyes should be a bit too small so it's really hard to see in that mask. Still working on improving it
---
What about Chucky though? I‚Äôd be terrified lmao
---
Bring iron will if you can.
---
The spirit can and will attempt to mind game you. If you think shes standing behind a window trying to trick you, just run.
---
If you think shes phasing, try running back over scratches or walking away.
---
Stay mindful of her passive. She may not be where she seems.
---
Listen carefully wherever you are. There is normally a whooshing sound if shes near.
---
If ruin has been cleansed, try not to cleanse other totems unless she has a problematic hex.
---
Learn to hit great skill checks, this will help with ruin in general.
---
If you are injured you are much easier to find. Heal when you get the chance.
---
Be unpredictable and she will have a very hard time getting you with her power
---
Most importantly, do not DC when you see her. If you dont play against her you will never learn how. It takes practice to counter any killer, especially if they have a unique power like her.
---
People who say she has no counter play are bad at the game. The only unfair part of her kit is prayer beads.
---
Why is Spooky Bitch so funny to me
---
Don't worry, I play scratched mirror Myers in order to remind guys like you that it is a horror game.
---
Die lol
---
this is the correct answer^
---
Yea, but he does moan an awful lot.
---
Probably the ones who are basically immortal
---
(Spirit, Wraith, Nurse, Freddy ecetera)
---
they have the upper hand on all "human" characters
---
Legion, Ghostface,Pig, Bubba Billy and Trapper are the most vulnerable.
---
Why not just let the voting system decide if it shouldn't be posted? It's just silly to be so negative on such a nice nontoxic post. There's plenty of other low effort content on this sub and it's filthy with reposts. Edit: also the op comment you agreed with straight up said how is this cosplay so....you are saying it's not
---
Ah, sorry, just so used to "people pointing out differences" actually being "people wanting a buff". My bad, didn't intend to put words in your mouth!
---
Yeah there‚Äôs other ones too but Myers one takes the cake.
---
Dweard and Sharp Moustache were given in a code giveaway quite some time ago. You could probably find someone reselling them, but I'm not too sure about that.
---
The alternative is Dwearded given away for the 1 Year Anniversary of Dead by Daylight and I could be wrong but I believe it may have returned for the 2 Year Anniversary and 3 Year Anniversary so there's a chance it could return for the 4 Year Anniversary.

And honestly man I haven't said anything insulting to you. There's no reason to be all "git gud" and assume on some inexperienced noob just whining. I'm looking for constructive criticism and a discussion here not insults.
---
The shitposts on this subreddit are fucking amazing
---
Just add a LOT of generators
---
I did one today with one of my most hated killers the 4-hits from invis with the wraith at level 1 killer level. Using only Shadowborn. Just slammed one down hung him up to dry and waited in invis. Slammed the savior and repeated it 4 times, then I let the 3 survivors walk out one guy died becasue he just came to rescue every time when he was wounded. I don't tryhard when doing dailies and usually toy around with the survivors when I know they are done. They get points I get a chuckle and we all are happy!
---
Insidious bubba have hatch no problem
---
Cuz some survivors are babies and don't care about ruining the game for their team.
---
It's kind of silly to expect that level of balance in an asymmetrical game though, imo.
---
It's easy to balance and nerf things in fighting games and other well known competitive games because everyone has the same toolbox. If you, say, made all killers move faster to make it so the most elite seal team six swf squads lose 2 people on average,  rank 10+ would get obliterated by killers with no counters and no ability to use the buffs themselves.
---
I think people underestimate how hard it is to balance an asymmetrical game while keeping it fun for all who play it, compared to how easy that is to do for symmetrical games.
---
Well, here's what I was thinking about those guys
---
Ghostface - loud robes are bad for sneaking. Wouldn't be able to get close without alerting Huntress. Axe beats tiny knife once she's aware of him no matter what 
---
Myers - Stands a better chance against Huntress than Ghostface, as he's quieter and even stronger. A fight between him and huntress would come down to luck and circumstance, but yes, he could potentially win against her with EW3.
---
Demo - Huntress doesn't let it get near her. She's hunted huge animals for food her entire childhood. Demo dies by hatchets before even getting a chance to get split in half by her axe. Teleportation doesn't help Demo, and neither does lunge.
---
Billy and Demo and anyone else who's main ability translates to "move real quick" are swiftly put down by long range hatchets.
---
Surprisingly I've seen more than one killer dodge legacy survivors, bruh they're making your job easier by being brighter than pink neon Nea's.
---
If only
---
Same
---
I'm sorry but this is not true at all. I've seen him have balance discussions on his stream and he's never refused something because of "his own personal beliefs".
---
Weird, fun usually would be what someone would want out of a video game but you do you boo
---
Your submission to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
* Video submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to self-promotion spam. 
---
No worries, she's definitely one of the most well balanced killers in the game outside of iriheads. Extremely fun, too. Just waiting on BBQ so I can work on cross maps
---
The heartbeat radius filling up the map. It screws over the whole team if you just leave the camera on him.
---
 That would be super annoying to be matched with randoms, and perhaps someone doesn't know about it.
---
there's no reason for the hatch to spawn with zero gens done. it should go back to requiring at least 2 if you're the last.
---
I just use adrenaline to sprint to the gate before another survivor to get the objective points opening lol
---
Bateman is too funny to put in this game but god damn do I want him anyway. I see him as being a spy-esque character, because his entire thing is being indistinguishable from other people. Paul Owen mistakes him for Marcus Halberstram because everyone in that office wears the same suits, goes to the same barber, eats at the same upscale chic restaurants, and does the same job. In order to counter SWF, his ability would just transform all survivors to look exactly like him. All yuppie businessmen in suits. To prevent people from just spreading out and sprinting away anytime a teammate approached them (because obviously it's the killer), there'd have to be some kind of incentive for grouping up, or disincentive for spreading out. some fucking macguffin I don't know
---
anyway it's impossible to make something like this work in the game he'd probably just be an M1 killer don't care just want to return some videotapes and murder a homeless guy
---
Still not looked it up haha?
---
Base skin looks horrible? You completely miss the point, but that's your opinion and that's fine.
---

If he does fair enough. I doubt he'll be a good fit. Thats why its just an opinion..

Due to foreseen circumstances, steam sales are delayed.
---
Luckily they didn't
---
With the ring there could be wells instead of hooks and to save the survivor you have to crank the rope up.
---
This tickles me more than it really should. xD
---
I did this once with one of those blendettes, at the end she end up dead and i get hatch, I said thanks to the killer and we do some SWF. 
---
Onestly felt good.
---
The Demo is nothing like she fought before first off I‚Äôm not even sure if a hatchet could hurt him and second Demo isn‚Äôt some stupid animal it is a apex predator and could stealth around teleport around and jump her 
---
Also we are talking about in a battle we are getting rid of things like loud as robes we are using their lore and shit 
---
And Myer is a close up 1v1 would tear her in half

This one's my favorite of the halloween memes so far

why does this have more upvotes

The Master from Buffy the vampire slayer as a killer and Buffy as a survivor ! :O
---
Holy shit, i never thought i would read a comment that actually understands who or what Otz is doing. People keep seeing him as someone wholesome but they never see how good his strategic advances are. Theorycrafters are rare in this game that's why he became my favorite.
---
You can't really compare 2 totems against 2 perks that are not counterable
---
Damn dude. That background (without billy) would be a sick tattoo, I mean billy looks awesome just the chainsaw and skulls/addon etc would be really awesome as a tattoo on the back.
---
Great work man!
---
brand new part
---
It‚Äôs on YouTube so it‚Äôs dislikes not downvotes
---
Seems fair
---
I wouldnt care about the delay if I thought it would actually improve the quality once it's released. but we all know the bugginess of this game never really improves overall. in fact, they love to claim that X update fixes a certain bug, then you start the game and immediately have the bug all over the place.
---
That‚Äôs a big if though
---
But they are shifting the days. It says that we aren't losing any amount of time due to the delay cause they are just going to shift things back a little to accommodate for it. So they are i fact changing the days
---
I agree with this,  crappy internet users be damned.

How?

What I want out of a video game is victory with a satisfying fight or chase. Playing killer I can get those chases and victories.
---
Aka, something you would want out a video game.
---
been hit with ds a lot because ill find the unhook accidentally in 60 seconds. not just campers or tunners get hit with ds

I prestiged demogorgon because he looks like a testicle

Ash isn't a killer he's a survivor ü§¶, we're talking about killers.

I doubt we‚Äôll ever get Jason because he‚Äôs too similar to trapper, and I doubt we‚Äôll ever get the spooky bitch because she‚Äôs too similar to spirit
---
I would die to see the Luna Ghost in dbd
---
hadn't seen this suggestion before but it's a pretty good one honestly.
---
Imhotep is pretty scary. His power would probably involve damaging survivors to steal their organs and increase his power.
---
You killed me. Thanks.
---
England is a city right?

---
To add to advice, David has two good perks. We‚Äôrre gonna love forever will help with BP grind. Dead Hard requires good timing and finesse but I‚Äôd incredibly useful.
---
I would be too scared to play if they added her, bitch ruined my childhood
---
Where can I find a good "new player guide" for a survivor? The link on this Reddit is unavailable. 
---
I played a lot the first month the game came out and have been back for about a week. 4 stacks of "we're gonna live forever" gets me tons of bloodpoints to unlock perks, but I suck at chases even when I run an exhaustion perk. 
---
Everyone tells me to run Adrenaline, but if I don't live long enough for the last gen to be fixed... I do run self-care, so I can heal myself if the guy I unhook runs off after I heal them.
---
fyi people have started to substitute the last panel with something a little less insensitive to physically disabled people on r/antifastonetoss
---
Adrenalin procs because gens got done regardless of well anyone played. NOED procs when all gens are done regardless of how well anyone played
---
"white knighting"
---
Yes as we all know my favourite Egirl that I must protect is Tru3
---
Look I don't mind when something is postponed because of a bug but what I do mind which happens a lot with them is they postpone something like dedicated servers because of bugs that were happening in the PBT yet they then release that dedicated servers and yet the same bugs they postponed the servers for are still there. I just have a feeling it's going to happen with the Halloween event as well.
---
Yeah what a shame :(
---
But have to admit that freddy had something that make him look hot to me. (and no the fact that he's entire body is burned xc).
---
I'm amazed that the Spirit isn't in those lists actually... not at all...
---
This is why you always get Totems people. Bad Billy who can‚Äôt even get an insta-down normally
---
The more you know
---
every ranks since i play the game since two years now. I know each side, from rank 20 to rank 1 in swf or in solo
---
Me wanting a scary house chapter
---
Video link?
---
This I agree with
---
Yeah you're right, I was talking about base speed. Then maybe at a time limit to it like only 20 seconds after the person is hooked if they're unhooked within that distance the rescuer has the exposed status. You're right usually people don't, but I find the majority of swf I play do. Usually Killers also don't tunnel but there is a perk to combat the few that do. The downside to both parks, this one I'm proposing and DS is that they are highly situational and you might waste a perk slot by bringing them. But the option is there if you face rushed unsafe unhooks a lot.
---
Me wanting a scary house chapeter
---
I don't even like Tru3, but it annoys the shit out of me just seeing the exact same shit get posted every hour of the day
---
love it!!!!!!
---
Same.
---
Sloppy pairy very well with Nurses
---
After some troubleshooting on the phone with Century Link, I connected the PS4 directly to the wall outlet (rather than using it via WIFI), and it seems to help for a bit, but when DBD v3.2.2 was released, it came back (but not as often).
---
Bring the whole Mystery Gang and give them The Legion Treatment!
---
This is for sure an epic gamer moment
---
People say nurse on console is horrible but I‚Äôm consistently getting 3ks and 4ks with her, Id say I agree with this tier list although I think pig and huntress should be moved up a tier
---
Killers have limited time, they are automatically pressured to succeed in stopping survivors, survivors can slack of as much as they want because they just delay their own escape, but delay doesn't mean that it won't happen. If a killer does nothing he always loses, if a survivor does nothing but walk about he just delays the game.
---
Suits, just 5 million different suits.
---
As someone else mentioned, Iron Will is great, however a lot of Spirits will use Stridor, which essentially negates the effects of Iron Will. Firstly, you don't loop a Spirit, certainly not a good one anyway. Lots of survivors don't like the spirit because you have to play differently and that upsets/confuses them. You put the pallet down and then the pallet is your mindgame. I'd recommend watching TrU3Ta1ent gameplay both as and against the Spirit to get a really good understanding of how to play against her. Like with any killer, you won't really know how to play against them unless you know how to play as them. Contrary to popular opinion, Spirit isn't OP, a lot of people just don't want to learn how to play against her, so they DC when they come up against her. The only thing OP about her is the prayer beads add on.
---
&gt;I'd rather see something classic like a Vampire
---
I was thinking of a vampire being added to dbd the other day
---
Lots of great guides [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d5elu7/guides_resources_for_new_players/). Is your dead link in there?
---
In terms of information useful to new players, I'd start with the looping guides. Bear in mind that *normally* you shouldn't be able to loop forever, so the goal is to either force the killer to lose interest, or run them long enough for your team to pop all the gens and open a gate.
---
New killer announced: Your MoM!
---
I‚Äôll add to the other suggestions is 
---
Sloppy Butcher. While it doesn‚Äôt effect men‚Äôs, it will slow down regular healing. 
---
Monitor and Abuse. Deep wounds kicks in outside of your tr. M&amp;A drops your tr by 8 meters. 
---
Nurses Calling. Since they‚Äôll do a lot of healing, pair it with M&amp;A. 
---
If you do use Corrupt, I think Discordance is good. Since you‚Äôre shrinking the available gens, Discordance will point to where they do go.
---
Father Corn has ascended
---
My personal favorite build on him is what I call "Big Break Wraith". It's Brutal Strength, Fire Up, NoED, and BBQ. You bring the addon's "Shadow Dance" which "Tremendously reduces the time required to vault windows, open lockers, break pallets or damage generators while cloaked." and "The Serpent" (brown addon) which states " The Wraith will uncloak completely when braking pallets or damaging generators while cloaked."
---
Here's a video of me running it :) https://youtu.be/hrTbfO4UoEA
---
(I never found a connection type other than Nat 2.)
---
It's low effort and shouldn't be here. I also agree every "MLG head on" or "look I escaped through the hatch for the first time" or or Tbag tombstone Myers shit needs to stop. Remember when or mods were actually removing post and everyone started using "smol Billy" at least stupid post we're being removed
---
IMO looping is not a beginner skill. Gotta learn to walk before you can run.

Not really cos technically the plague is just sick not dead or undead.
---
Diavolo/doppio are the best villains
---
Thanks for that link!  I'll check those out!
---
The dead link I was looking at was on the "menu" here. The glossary and FAQ works, but not the "new player guide".
---
I frequently use The Bonsai tree and the Cherry Blossom to get more passive shifts and make them last longer... this is amazingly fun to do since it really throws of a lot of a survivors, I'm in the process of P3-ing my spirit now that Freddy and Doc. Carter are all grinded out, and that add-on combo makes for the funnest games 'cause you really see how it messes with peoples mind and you don't even notice it as the killer since only survivors see the flickering and shifting.
---
Ok so the one where you are hiding in bed and can't move. I thought so that game that's basically Fnaf4 how is that even kind of like an 5 player asymmetrical horror game? With multiple levels perks killers (that don't function at all like that)
---
This kind of stuff and even worse things are why I just solo queue. The Xbox community is certainly something else...
---
that‚Äôd be so fun!! what would his perks be?
---
No one complains about two stalkybois with knives.
---
Now this is a discussion. It's weird since you can go by in-game abilities or lore abilities - Legion is a good example since they would get absolutely bodied if it was just one of them like the game, but together they could overpower the human killers like Pig or Ghost Face before getting owned by a bigger killer. In general I'd give more chance to the ones who can manipulate dimensions like Freddy or the Spirit. Physically I think the most intimidating is the Demogorgan since it's a freaky murder animal.
---
Pretty sure the video is about the glitch, not the play
---
Good ol' Doc get's a mad as a hatter every time!
---
definitely gonna do this one.
---
sounds interesting. ill give it a go
---
**PEPSI MAN**
---
This. I got tired of struggling on the hook by spamming a button. I use a G502 when I play DBD, so I can unlock my scroll wheel and only hit it/flick it down a few times to keep struggling. Too bad I can‚Äôt bind it to the carrying struggle too :|
---
What about Pyramidhead from Silent Hill?
---
This is a double edged sword. You know how many killers I've had DC when their ruin is taken out in the first minute or so of the match?
---
Solution: bring thanatophobia instead of ruin, it can't be taken out. And, if you're doing your job as killer, at least one person should be injured at any given time. üíØ
---
I maybe thinking of the wrong game.
---
If you run hex: ruin, corrupt intervention AND discordance you get some interesting data.
---
  Survivors will often take around 15-20 seconds to move to another gen and start gentapping üôÉ
---
  Generators need to start exploding when two people try to work on them with ruin up.
---
we are all something without adrenaline since it doesn't do anything for us half the time. So we deserve it
---
Thanatopobia and Dying Light is a solid combo. Surge and Thrilling Tremors is good but it‚Äôs an advanced build that doesn‚Äôt rely on Ruin. 
---
The M1 Special always works (BBQ Ruin Enduring Spirit Fury) 
---
An anti healing build (Monitor and Abuse, Nurses, Ruin, Sloppy Butcher
---
My personal favorite Battle Legion (STBFL, Enduring, POP and Ruin.) 
---
And a silly rank reset build OOPS All Totems (three totem perks and Haunted Ground.) 
---
Power usage: Very sparingly. It‚Äôs a scouting tool so use addons that decrease fatigue or increase duration and try not to miss. The iridicent button feels kinda mandatory because their other addons are pretty garbage. Note that while Legion isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúworst‚Äù they aren‚Äôt all that good either. You will excel by using your knowledge of the map and loops and mindgames more than the actual power itself because it‚Äôs a hinderance to you more often than not.
---
These are literally the killers I enjoy playing to the ones I least enjoy playing so I guess we should play against each other lmao
---
All my friends are like ‚ÄòFriday the 13th is so much better!‚Äô The game can‚Äôt even load for me, it just loads a black screen. Yeah, no. As much bugs as DbD has, I‚Äôm sticking to it.
---
I can add the Wraith Ohm cosmetics to that as well!
---
Awesome... you don‚Äôt work in a hospital do you?
---
Nothing unusel. It normal.... im think..... maby.... yes
---
Optimal
---
If the main goal is humor I automatically disagree. Game's meant to be scary, and while it's great if it's funny on accident, it's whack to try and change the mood from how it's been the entire time thus far
---
Still, pretty funny to think about a wee baby running through the corn and getting slapped by stalks as he cackles and tries to shank survivor's butts
---
No if the event came back when it should have
---
The only reason I put Huntress at the top of that tier is that there's some maps with so many twists and turns to put between a survivor and your hatchets that its very hard to get hits (such as The Game).
---
But yeah console Nurse (while not as good as her pc counterpart) can easily mop up survivors with good aiming and predicting.
---
Beetlejuice is able to fly and walk through walls like most ghosts do, but also possesses a variety of magic powers, which he usually uses to transform himself, Lydia, his surroundings, and/or other people. So like a mixture of Spirit and Freddy? TBH I haven't thought too deep into it. Just popped in my head and was like, dude - he'd be awesome.
---
Try running Shadowborn 3 on your nurse.
---
God dammit why are you in every comment section
---
There‚Äôs an Nvidia overlay that I‚Äôve seen people use in other games that don‚Äôt have built-in options, but I‚Äôve also been told by people that use it that the overlay isn‚Äôt as good as built-in corrections. I don‚Äôt suffer from color blindness so I wouldn‚Äôt know first hand, but I *think* the overlay works for DBD.
---
*waits patiently for Jakob Goodnight*
---
When he says he'll train someone, he'll turn into a train and run over the person he said he'd train. When he says he's tired, he'll turn into a tire.
---
we were talking about pinky finger taking effort, not the exhaustion add-ons, try to keep up here buddy. and even if the exhaustion add-ons for clown were op, (which they aren't) clown is a low tier killer in general.  countering exhaustion doesn't magically make him somehow strong or even viable.
---
Nah the goal isn‚Äôt for humor. If he was the size of trapper? Maybe that‚Äôd be a bit funny but I think either way it‚Äôs be pretty terrifying to add him to the game
---
For an average game I usually get 40-50k unless I do bad
---
Reference: https://youtu.be/KxbroYs5mvI
---
Killer: The Countess
---
Weapon: Golden Shears 
---
Map: Castle or Plantation
---
Survivor: any from the movie 
---
I think this would work great.
---
Nah, a survivor can take an axe and keep running. How many do you think the Demogorgon or the other absolute unit killers can tank while it runs at her? She can't keep maintain distance, she's too slow, and while she's not a stick like Legion I wouldn't call her huge. Not sustainable - she'd ice other human sized killers but not the invisible/big ones.
---
New Survivor: Norman Reedus
---
New Killer: Lisa (The Abandoned)
---
New Map: L-Shaped Apartment of Untrustworthy Tap Water
---
Can't find any killer games. I stopped playing this game 1 year ago because of this exact problem, since I find survivor boring. I uninstalled multiple times, I verified cache, nothing helps. As survivor I find games almost instantly. Help?
---
you could also do old legion which is stab wound study Frank's mixtape tinkerer dark devotion insidous and another perk of your choosing
---
Doing this with tombstone equipped makes me nut

Now ITS OUR TURN TO HIDE IN THE TREES

A message that you only care about kills and literally nothing else, and will ruin a game for everyone
---
Each suit has a different color tie
---
The sound of endgame last second made me cry a lil lmao
---
The Dwight watching it happen from the locker would win
---
It does to me. 3 DC's makes it super easy for the last guy to escape and the killer de-pips through no fault of their own. 3 DC's should screw the survivor over, not the killer.
---
MAI AIDEA TO REMOOV DEE ‚ÄòATCH
---
I mean 4% reduced action speed for each injured, dying or hooked survivor is pretty good. Max being 16%. It's considered B tier.
---
Consider your location and local time. For best results, try and be as close to "prime time" as possible.
---
I was thinking that too at first but it'd require a lot of money for the animation and it would probably be really glitchy

I used to sub to him until he had a game where 3 people escaped and he was calling them all kinds of names and said they‚Äôre shit players.
---
I said in chat ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre shit players‚Äô
---
Because they weren‚Äôt, they played well and weren‚Äôt toxic. They had a good game he had a bad one it happens.
---
Then he started going off ‚Äòyou don‚Äôt realise they‚Äôre shit because you don‚Äôt know anything about the game‚Äô
---
I was just like fuck you man I‚Äôve supported your channel for ages and you‚Äôre fully badmouthing good survivors just because you didn‚Äôt do well.
---
Unsubbed, unfollowed, never watched a stream since.

this is truly an ascended shitpost

Okay? Why is a Middleschooler looking at DbD porn?

hmm i'd have to look into this one. I feel like im missing something. Like why the insidious?

Why

I didn‚Äôt need to know that this existed
---
Where does it say they just want to polish the event and not release a buggy event?
---
History says otherwise and these weird shilling posts are so incredibly annoying. Were allowed to not think the way a dev team acts is good or okay, and we're allowed to not give them the benefit of the doubt when they have not one single time earned it.
---
I play ole ty of other games that when an update is pushed back, or and event is postponed, the community knows something went wrong, and gives credit where it is due. BVHR at tight lipped, give little idea of what's going on, and wait LONG periods of time between updates in issues, while straight up not commenting or not fixing plenty of issues we face for months in end.
---
There is no reason for us to assume anything other than a mismanaged situation where they combined far too much into one update, and then we're not able to give the playerbase absolutely any part of said update when it either completely broke, or a bunch of behind the scenes logistics that we'd never hear about just didn't fall into place went wrong.
---
If this team was better we would have gotten the event but not the updates, or we'd have had some double blood point event or something for the holidays to just say sorry everyone were trying, and instead we've gotten snarky comments and lackluster communication.
---
Sometimes I legit wonder if people are paid to make these posts, even though that sounds so crazy to me.
---
We will get the updates and we will STILL have bugs and glitches and laggy shit, because that's always been the case. Stop acting like they don't have a track record we have been part of watching.
---
1k or none is loser
---
2k is tie

3k or 4K is winner

I‚Äôm the winner when I 4k

Or someone saw a meme with a lot of upvotes and decided they wanted to make something similar.

Their power could be to suck the life force out of survivors giving them a buff and after a while puts the survivor in the dying state.

I think you're clearly WASTING your education in a cheap attention grab.

GOOD on ya, though, for constantly needing life affirmation.

Pretty much exactly this, the NVidia overlay is a bootleg EnChroma that doesn't set you back nearly 400$ but it makes the game look jank as fuck
---
why dont you play the b tier killers much?
---
I‚Äôm loving all of these, I‚Äôd love to buy them as posters. Keep up the amazing work!
---
Lol...when ghostface came out xD
---
Plague 
---
Tinkerer, Bitter Murmur, Ruin, Cruel Confinement
---
Run Infectious Fright instead of Ruin if your felling spicy 
---
Add ons the red one that makes it every time you do a gen you get Corrupt and the purple one that makes Corrupt last longer 
---
Survivors finish a gen you are already there with no terror radius you see there aruas and all windows are blocked off and to top it off you have Corrupt Purge time for the fun to begin
---
*My eyes*
---
Worked out for you. GG
---
Legion is an abortion that bhvr made and unfortunately lived. Nice list btw.
---
Not exactly licensed, but I've always said Jack the Ripper is a killer I would want. If AC Syndicate and Identity V had him as such a badass playable character, then so can DBD.
---
Tbh Ghostface isn‚Äôt that bad on maps with walls because it breaks line of sight so it‚Äôs way harder to know if he‚Äôs coming
---
As someone who plays both survivor and killer, adrenaline can be absolutely soul crushingly overpowered. You could work your ass off getting everyone hurt which makes you think you have a ton of pressure then suddenly last gen pops and all of that pressure is gone and they get a speed boost. This leaves M1 killers with no aggressive abilities such as wraith or doctor in the worst position, they have a hard enough time smacking survivors down and to then have all that work undone is devastating
---
One or two adrenalines is annoying but you can still get a couple kills after it. But it is absolutely destroying if all 4 survivors have adrenaline. It‚Äòs one of the reasons metal of man got destroyed with nerfs, these high power perks are decent on their own but combined together it‚Äôs a fucking infinity gauntlet of power to survivors. Disagree? Play a 4 man SWF with all survivors running balanced landing, adrenaline, decisive and self care / iron will / object of obsession with everyone bringing flashlights, toolboxes and medkits and the cherry on top : Haddonfield offering. Those games are so stacked against the killer that it‚Äôs not worth playing.
---
There‚Äôs absolutely broken stuff on both sides that‚Äôs unfun to play against : For killers they have Moris and instadown addons for certain killers
---
Survivors have balanced landing, adrenaline, instaheals, survivor sided maps like haddonfield and most of all : SWF. 
---
The game needs a perk overhaul, there‚Äôs so many perks that are awesome ideas but in fear of them being too powerful are watered down while at the same time are perks that are incredibly powerful and are left that way. Then there‚Äôs also perks that are just completely useless like hangman‚Äôs trick or new metal of man, they‚Äôre so specific and situational.
---
I hope it comes out amazing!! Thank you btw
---
DAMN YOU BILL
---
I feel like Columbus could be easier and you could use his rules as his perks

I agree with removing collision, but lore-wise it makes perfect sense. Spirit still obeys the rules of the physical realm.

In all honesty, Jacksepticeye said it when someone asked him what he thought of Septiplier. Of course I changed it up a bit to be more vulgar. But I like to think it still holds it own in the accuracy.
---
Only if we get a Brenden Fraiser survivor
---
Freddy exists only in the dream world so he just won't meet demogordon
---
Maybe this is what i also can do...
---
LMAO WHAT.   
---
Or maybe, just maybe, more people are finding out that he plays DBD, but that might just be a conspiracy theory.
---
Fair, fair. She also has limited hatchets. I didn't think about that. Demogorg and possibly Michael could tank six hatchets and then without her projectiles Huntress isn't much
---
Have the devs ever made reference to or discussed a non ranked version of this game that isn't kill your friends? Like a bunch of random people who don't give a shit about BP or EXP or any of that crap but don't have any friends so they need to be matched up.
---
I see this man likes survival horror. Personally...I know this is TOO obscure but.....MADMAN MARS
---
Using bond with object of obsession and sole survivor to get your team mates killed so you can keep an eye on the killer without them seeing you
---
If we can't get Kane '98, in WWE 2k20; we'll get Kane '05 in DBD
---
Real shit tho, John Wick would be a cool Survivor
---
Thanatophobia can be taken out. All you have to do is heal.
---
Demogorgon exists in a reality that was previously though to be non existent until it was disturbed by humans. Then the demogorgon got the ability to travel between dimensions at will. It if it is able to get a read on Freddy, I'm betting that it will be able to go into Freddie's reality whenever it wants.
---
Legal cheats, right. 3rd party comms violate game concept and are not part of the game
---
Dude shut the fuck up
---
Oh and if you ever go against him, don't dare go in his channel afterwards to say GG or else he'll rant about stream snipers for the rest of the stream. I feel like he's just burnt out with DbD and doesn't enjoy playing any more.
---
Meh. This isn't politics or science. You can believe what you want. I'll believe what I want.
---
He‚Äôs spamming it on everything just report him
---
And if you understand anything about this game you'd know that camping is by far the least likely playstyle to get you a 4K.  The only way you 4K camping is if you managed to get paired with 4 survivors even more potato than you.  It's a losing strategy for consistent 1k's and a depip.
---
I need a video of this
---
No, No, No. Lol
---
Though it's not like he would add much without his size differences. His main weapon is like a knife right? Big trapper esque guy with knife and plastic face? Ring any bells? Thats just Michael lmao
---
I could be convinced but I just cringe away from those who vouch for Chucky to be added. Theres just not a lot going for the little fella
---
Yeah that would be cool. I think the studio might get backlash over him because Terrifier upset a few people over misogyny or something .
---
I use both on Plague
---
Personally I'm in the camp of don't make them quieter, make them omnidirectional while in spiritwalk. Survivors have to figure out where the spirits coming from when they hear her phasing noise, she should have to do the same. Still get louder with proximity, but itd take a bit more work/understanding of survivor movement to catch them.
---
Bad killers always do
---
I don‚Äôt fault them for the delay. They want stuff to go as smoothly as possible.
---
I do fault them for shitty balance changes tho
---
Lol i got 4 k by camping 8/10 games sooooo

Holy shit, you actually even consider that? Otz is such a genuine person. If he did buy bots, he‚Äôs the best at faking his wholesome personality which I don‚Äôt believe is possible. If you‚Äôre faking it, you‚Äôre gonna slip up now and then. I‚Äôve seen Otz do that.  
---
He‚Äôs become so popular because he‚Äôs what everyone should strive to be.
---
0,7sec and you in hook
---
There's always a chance but I wouldn't get your hopes up.
---
Lol
---
Freddy gotta get sone play.
---
Love how noob3 is playing Steve.
---
Hes a living ad
---
You can't understand why people get upset when lied to? Umm, how fucking idiotic are you?
---
He isnt 50/50. On youtube it might look like it but I watch his streams. And you do know when you‚Äôre a high rank killer, destroying teams before 5 gens only grants you either a black pip and or you lose a pip. I wish it didnt bc it doesnt seem fair for killers such as I who grind for low ranks every month
---
Yeah you're pretty much damned if you do, damned if you don't on her.  They really need to rework the system to be killer specific.  Judging Plague, Hag, and Billy the same way is ludicrous.

uhhhhhh... what is it you do again?

Yes thank you, someone who doesn't suggest a shapeshifter turning into survivors. Turning into survivors gets countered easily by SWF and just avoiding other survivors.

My non-dbd player friend said it looks like a demon's cheese grater! lamo
---
I would definetly main him if it were to happen

Hell, he was a ruler hundreds of years ago here where I live which makes it even cooler

Spirit lowkey ring girl
---
We are TALKING about if the characters are horror icons.
---
You're making up nonsense about Negan, who comes from a horror IP, and does scary, horrific things, dude.
---
Slugging and only because of how the hatch currently is?  Dude this isn't a new developement killers been slugging to cheese hatch spawns since before the End Game Collapse was even a twinkle in the devs eyes.  I thought now that killers could easily and permanently close the hatch we would see less of it but nope.  Still a very real sweaty thing.
---
I thought I knew joy before tombstone killing a particularly pesky claudette
---
I was wrong. piss shivers can't even compare to that shit, it was sublime
---
And the "taking it like a champ!" mori
---
I don‚Äôt know my whole list but doctor would be high
---
Nothing of value was lost this day. Fuck people who DC like this.
---
Make sure to open your NAT. You might have to contact your ISP for info on how to do that. Also, if you haven't played in a while, chances are you're at rank 20 or close to it. It takes longer to find a match at that rank, and becomes easier as you level to mid ranks. It might be easier for you to find a match right after rank reset, which happens on the 13th of each month.
---
really cool!! loving the skull :)
---
How about Sada-kaya? He/She/**IT** would fit right in.
---
Part Sadako, Part Kayako. All evil.
---
The map could use portions of Kayako's house and either A) Sadako's hospital where he was raped and beaten nearly to death B) the circus troop that mocked him or C) the cabin in the woods with the tape and the well under the house.
---
Or they could just reskin haddonfield with textures from the Akira residence.
---
i‚Äôm exactly almost- Almost the exact opposite of you, as a legion main
---
Correct, but all survivors are affected by ONE survivor being injured &amp; a good killer is keeping pressure on the gens/map and hitting survivors. My point is that once hex ruin is cleansed it's GONE. If a survivor heals, hit another one.
---
That's not a hatch standoff.  Hatch standoffs were stalemates that only ended when one side gave up.  What you described is an attempt to counterplay the hatch close.  And unless the door spawns are opposite on a large map it isn't likely to work.
---
cant wait for bepisman to finally be added
---
I just want to impale survivors now. Thanks!
---
To face camp that Meg that looped them the entire game.
---
Me wanting the cube
---
No one cares
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ But you kinda thought about it, amirite?
---
talk about a low bar, jesus christ this is terrible
---
One of my favorite parts about this game is getting to the end TOGETHER! Amazing!
---
You almost had a point until you said decisive and self care
---
Never even crossed my mind lel
---
Pepsi man ? Fuck yeah !
---
Cheese? 
---
 I think you mean counterplay.
---
 You deserve that hatch about as much as the second to last person deserves to get up off the floor.
---
Very odd of you to put Clown at A there OP. What makes him fun? By all means, his evil laugh when you hit a survivor is absolutely horrifying no matter what side you're playing. But his slow mechanic for me just annoys me if I'm honest. But every other killer at A? Couldn't agree more.
---
Legion sucks ass bruh
---
I like all villains,there is no bad character in jojo except some side characters I guess but most of them are interesting in their own way
---
what‚Äôs the most iconic villain from that that they‚Äôd put in
---
We're talking about how well a guy with a bat would fit into a horror game with people that phase through walls and become invisible. If he does scary horrific things then you haven't seen much horror movies either. All he does is hit people with a bat, that's literally it. There's people in horror that rip people apart with their bare hands and procede to eat their victims. Negan isn't a horror figure. His attitude demonstrated throughout the show isn't horror-like, he's funny with bit of an asshole side to it.
---
I don't know if the devs have explicitly stated anything, but splitting the playlists could have negative effects on the game when people are already waiting so long for matches.
---
I tend to keep an eye on r/LeaksByDaylight by sorting by new and checking-in once a week. They tend to datamine updates and post anything worthwhile on there. Also if the devs hint towards anything. There may be a discord you could join too :-)
---
Self care not so much but decisive needs a little adjustment.
---
Picture this situation : You hook someone, go away, hook someone else, walk around, just happen to find the previous hooked guy who has been healed fully and given time to recover. Down him then bam, decisive. That‚Äôs not tunnelling is it? Decisive is a tunnelling counter.
---
It‚Äôs more so the fact that I never see him and I just get happy when I do. I‚Äôm sure if I faced him more often i wouldn‚Äôt be as happy to see him but still. I also just like everything about him aesthetically.
---
I remember when used to be in potato ranks.  Try ranking up a bit there buttercup.  Not only does camping not work against even halfway decent survivors but even if it does and you 4K the game still depips you for playing like no skill babytrash.  You're literally playing to lose by camping once you're out of the potato ranks.
---
They're nerfing instant heals aparently so there's that. Minus Adrenaline. But yeah I agree with you 100%.
---
Entity is not you day
---
Also entity you drink, go home entity
---
The director is a terrible creep and deserves to be in hell, ABSOLUTELY. 
---
But IMO I don‚Äôt agree shunning away a popular character because the director was a sicko. That‚Äôs limiting options for a new licensed killer, now if the money of the DLC was going to the director than I agree that the Creeper should not be in the game, but I just don‚Äôt like excluding characters if they‚Äôre well done just because the ex-director is a monster.
---
Cute :D actually cool thing to have. Just imagine having a big one standing in your apartment/house lol
---
If that means we get Naomi Watts as a survivor then I'm all for it
---
Survivors seem to fail to understand that what makes Ruin so powerful is people will literally drop everything to do the totem, despite the fact it's not even that hard to hit skill checks, I'd rather have the game slowed by 50% than 100% where I'm the only person actually doing gens.
---
you're legally allowed to lead the killer to them
---
It is fun, everyone teabagging away and not paying attention to the timer and then I slash one of them and they scatter like cock roaches! Great times!!!
---
Why did you edit your skin so much? You can literally see the blurring along the edges of your coat and hood
---
Thanks, my dude. People like you make the world a nice place!
---
Who cares about ranks xDD high rank high reward ? Get cool cosmetics ? Get a life loser xDDDD
---
Farming itself isn't against the rules, its it's when someone gets specifically targeted while everyone else farms, then you have a problem. If you let the killer kill someone by, say, unhooking them right infront of them so they can rehook them, it can be viewed as you working with the killer. Whenever youre farming, make sure everyone is in on it, or dont participate. Doesnt seem to be your problem if everyone escaped, though.
---
lmfao, pinky finger requires direct impacts with a slow moving arcing projectile. it might not be hard but you can't argue that it doesn't take effort. Huntress requires you to land a hit with hatchets and pig requires you to chase someone and down them first, sounds fair to me. I actually can't believe you're crying because a select few killers have some very basic counterplay to your crutch perks lmaoooo
---
the crapper
---
&gt; a swarm of survivors following you as you‚Äôre trying to hook your victim.
---
I love when they do this, they're always the most shocked and outraged when it fails.
---
I need that o.o its noed. Everytime I punch someone hes down. And the totem will be in my room, locked away from everyone o.o....so nobody can cleanse it o.o
---
Its not like BHVR wanted to delay anything; they are sweating their metaphorical balls off because every day it is delayed is another day they are not only not getting money and but players are either potentially spending the money they had on something else (like Steam sales or other game events), or the players are considering not to buy at all.
---
By not getting hung up on semantics.
---
How about a sharknado
---
You did amazingly üòÆ
---
I had a similar situation on PC. A rank 14 Myers beat me, one new DBD buddy (originally a ghost face that stomped my face in who became a survivor pal), and two randos. Now we were on an autohaven map with extremely long lines of sight, no pallets in critical areas, and most of the map was pretty much a death trap in a chase. We got stuck in a rescue conga line that fucked us over in the end, but hey we still managed 3 gens. So, all in all, not too terrible. 
---
After the game, I saw it was a level 1 Myers with only one perk (and basic gray add-ons)and was obviously impressed since I was thinking he must've been using nurse's and what not. So, I say GG like a good survivor, and right when I was going to tell him how cool it was he managed to use everything to his favor, he says "ez" and a few other insults saying we were bad because we lost to a level one Myers (never mind RNG wasn't on our side to begin with). Me and my buddy said "rude", and I decided to end the conversation on my side with "For a very skilled killer, you have terrible manners".
---
Nobody was rude to him, so it was just needless rude behavior on his part.  I'll never understand this behavior.
---
Iron Will, Sprint Burst, Fixated + Kindred (solo play)
---
imagine asking for a buff for a perk that's like self care or adrenaline. everyone runs it. doesn't need a buff.
---
True, and we already have a groovy character like Ash
---
How about 2 survivors 2 killers?
---

"whats your....most liked...horror motion picture?"
---
How dare you find me, good sir?! 
---
I‚Äôll have you know that my eyes were closed. If I can‚Äôt see you, you can‚Äôt see me! Baby town frolics.
---
I think that's more a problem with people who DC and not his idea.
---
You're too much! I'd award you if I wasn't poor lmao!
---
It's not even really a buff. And with how any stealth abilities killers have/can have I think it'd be okay. It's supposed to counter camping and tunneling, how is it supposed to do that if a killer can hide their terror radius? Also nobody uses self-care anymore.
---
Probably just shitty people who had a bad game and take it out on the next set of people who had nothing to do with it.
---
Glad to see that he's still not funny.
---
Same here, too poor to award you too üòÇüòÇ
---
This, in combination with a normal fucking vaulting animation, would make her balanced and not so un fun to play against
---
The artist who makes these comics, Stonetoss, is a self proclaimed Nazi and white nationalist. He holds a lot of extremely far-right views. Pretty much an asshole.
---
Best fucking thread replies ever LMAO
---
Ok, let's change up, I got tunelled the whole match and made like 6k points, why I don't deserve the match? The killer had direct impact on my points
---
YES it came to my mind and I‚Äôm hold WAIT A MIN... I think I just did somthn. I REALLY want this killer yo
---
are you have the dumb
---
That was what used to happen before end game collapse, wasn't fun for me for like two years lmao.
---
  Just go make a sandwich if you're slugged, it's what I do.
---
Really
---
Can i add you too? I have played swf once with a random guy that i met and god it was fun
---
By the way im rank 7 (almost 8)
---
"Legal cheats" lol. There's no such thing. It's either cheating or it's not, there's no gray area. How entitled are you that you claim that something is cheating because you don't like it, even though the devs have stated that it isn't?
---
YES!!!! Dbd could make some nice $ but we can only hope. It just fits so perfect. Killer, survivor, map, YES
---
Well the devs have come out many times and stated that ‚ÄúCAMPING AND TUNNELING IS A NON BAN ABLE OFFENSE‚Äù so the community has run wild with it because they know nothing will happen to them! So it‚Äôs BhVR‚Äôs fault in the first place with their bs statements and even said it‚Äôs fine every now and then, little do they realize that 8 out of 10 games on PS4 are straight face camped games from the beginning. 
---
I played 7 games last night and 4 of them, the killer camped from the start... 
---
It ruins the other players experience and if it happens game after game after game, they get fed up with the shit! Then you get assholes who wanna sit here and defend camping and then BhVR with their mental retardation blabbing their mouths and this is what you get. 
---
There are certain times that facecamping is fine with allot of people. For instance those toxic assholes who teabag &amp; flashlight at every pallet or the person who bullies the killer all game and then the killer gets them, or the killer got his ass run and gets you before you can get out the gates and face camps, then sure have your kill and if I‚Äôm the one on the hook you won‚Äôt hear any complaints from me. 
---
I‚Äôve had friends and family members quit because that‚Äôs all they had happen to them game after game and my own nephew said this game was trash and a hook simulator!
---
R/wooooosh
---
Not bad i really liked coraline so this would be a nice surprise
---
Not the Halloween Event we were expecting, but a Halloween Event nonetheless.
---
Potentially. It sucks to eat someone else's shit when that happens.
---
Because he's a douche who blames everything on somebody else. Nothing is ever his fault and he thinks the devs should balance the game around him. For instance he gladly hits people after they vault a window and acts like it's a good mechanic and when he gets hit through a window bitches about it. He's a douche and I don't know why anyone would want to watch a dick bitch about a game. Survivor drops a pallet on him in a game? Video title- insane optimal coordinated stream sniping swf.
---
Well, you're saying you got tunneled and died with 6k points? How are you going to get the hatch if you're dead?
---
What did Ochido do?
---
LMAO I hate it when that legit happens to me as killer because most survivors don't do totems and screw themselves over on end game especially when I have bloodwarden XD. But I also feel so freaking good when I end up cleansing Noed right at the last second of saving someone from being smacked down.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs like I didn‚Äôt pallet loop you for the whole match or act toxic but you‚Äôre being rude to me? Lol
---
All DLC except Stranger Things, that is. Not a surprise since it hasn't been out that long, though.
---
No, I'm saying I got tunneled and only had 6k points by the time the hatch should spawn.
---
Don't act like that, you know my point, killers can chase you for long enough to you get only points in chase cathegory
---
Shapeshifter is a nono the devs themselves said no shapeshifters because they would be fucked over by a SWF group mabey they could look like a different killer or something so you think you play one way but you half to play the other way
---
OMG Thank you!!!!
---
Coraline is my favourite film and has been since release.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve actually changed my opinion on that. Maybe it was silly to increase cooldown on using it optimally. But it was to balance the power and make the player have to decide if you should hit another survivor and suffer a longer cooldown or maybe use FF a little so you just get a little cooldown. You can see this kind of design in games like League of Legends. It may be true that the numbers are ridiculous, that‚Äôs not the point. But I just wanted to suggest some interesting and unique mechanics that could be fun and spark discussion. Or maybe someone comes up other ability or version from it?
---
I‚Äôm not claiming this chart is live-server ready üò´
---
Get down from there, Legion!
---
Like combo of Freddy and doctor where they hallucinate and see the dead children and blood UGH DBD COME ON
---
Nice. Youve done our ghosty boi proud
---
For me it's killers DC'ing when they see a Haddonfield offering.
---
Ebony Mori's and The Game are perfectly cool though.
---
Kinda wish you had named it Samination 8 instead of newest if this one takes off for search purposes but sure.
---
For sure, decisive has some problems, the one you just mentioned being the main one.
---
But my point is, it's a terrible theoretical perk. The only use it actually has is going into a locker during a chase with it active when there's still a bit on the timer left, or going down at the exit gate with it active. 
---
These scenarios are not common. Decisive strike is playing with 3 perk slots. I main killer, and I haven't been dstriked in 2 months. 
---
Always assume dstrike, keep track of time, and slug if needed
---
Yeah, good point. Thanks for the recommendation.
---
Hey, you even nailed the flappy cape thingies. Good stuff!
---
How about Po from Teletubbies
---
Turning an advantage into a bigger advantage, like adding more snow to a snowball to make it bigger
---
so you get a down, you hook them, and because they come to save them, you hook *that* person too, and now there's only 2 left, and you can pressure the remaining two etc etc.
---
Incorporate the horse death carriage that could be part of the mori or her power. Make me dev rn
---
best ones are the Dwights who chase right behind you on your way to the hook, huffing and puffing with their loud footsteps. then you hook the guy, and Dwight is nowhere to be seen, but there are several large trees within 5-7 feet. And I'm supposed to pretend Dwight just disappeared.
---
We can't be lenient with them at this point. Even if they do "fix the bugs", you can bet your ass there will still be bugs in this damn update.
---
If you're getting chased for that long you should have the full 8k from boldness. But still, what you're telling me is the killer is tunneling you the entire game, which means if you're at that point, then you should loop a little longer your team can open the gates, or the killer is probably gonna face camp you, which again is a problem with face camping and not the idea.
---
Especially because the only counter (OoO) to stealth killers at the moment is getting nerfed, and you have killers who can move at 115% movement with almost no method of counter play. Yeah, there is spine chill but that requires them to be a little too close for comfort.
---
The game has a lot of RNG as part of it's base. Skill checks are random and effect generator repair time and ruin makes skill checks even more painful. Hexes in general rely on RNG for where they spawn and which totem is the hex. As you mentioned the maps themselves have RNG with how they generate. I think if they removed all of that, skill checks, hex totems, map generation, the game would lose a lot of what makes it fun and occasionally irritating. And even after all of that it won't stop toxic players and that will always exist to ruin the games of those they involve.
---
If this would actually be implemented I would literally die of hapiness
---
This is exactly what I want. A rework like this would unlock countless more gameplay posibilities.
---
If you DC a lot, you might get banned. But as a single offense, no, not bannable
---
Yeah I've never seen Tru3 do anything like this.
---
one problem steam is pretty much entirely down due to traffic
---
Oh thanks
---
Non infinite freddy is both fun to play against and competitive to use, quite intrresting
---
I lost it when the Wraith responded "are you calling me basic????"
---
Kind of a shitty move. Just play the game out.
---
I had the opposite of this happen as killer where I swung at a survivor and the millisecond before I hit him one of his teammates cleansed haunted grounds. Confused tf out of me for a sec

---
I'm not reading the essay you typed, I was done with this argument after my last reply. Good day to you.
---
I wonder how the system would work if 1 emblem was based around how effectively you used your power, granted they would have to program the emblem to work in like 17 different ways and this is a pipe dream...but if it were possible it can probably make pipping a lot fairer for killers, seeing as 6 or 7 of the killers are punished through it, and 1 is over-rewarded for it.
---
yeah the play sucked it was my first time trying
---
Literally why I give no value to people who try to justify things by saying X side had this, both sides are equally toxic and he presents himself as an innocent killer main who always plays fair/isn't toxic. He is toxic, this is proof. He'd be a hyprocite now then if he complained about teabagging and flashlight clicking. Not only that, he's saying this was justified because people use instaheals (an item in the game) which is not toxic in the slightest. By that same logic, using a strong killer like spirit would be toxic because they're really good and something that can be used legally while her strength is acknowledged. It's all pretty funny if you look past the curtains.
---
And useful, you'd know someone was looking at them so you're likely safe
---
Are they not doing the same thing to him by crouching around the edges of the map while he runs the killer?
---
Belive it or not, tru3 is not toxic, he just complains a lot about balance which is perfectly justified.
---
Jason should be adopted
---
Survivors could have to "drop a rose" to resist her in some way? She has a ton of potential to be a real fun and unique killer and I now want her as a priority. BHVR PLEASE
---
Nope, cave
---
I'm not sure what that has to do with it unless it's a joke that went over my head.
---
yup, if you do this often you might get reported a lot and banned
---
I hate leaving games, but if it's a spirit or a laggy killer I'm leaving
---
A mechanic based on light would be super intriguing.
---
Bitch from ring is kinda spirit change my mind
---
Why you mad it‚Äôs only meme also phantom alt, considering all the comments you make are spiting other people. So like *lay off*
---
It took you till almost 2020 to realize that lol
---
Throw on sloppy butcher with the clown perk the phobia one and distressing. They won‚Äôt be healing anytime soon. Fun build to fuck around with every now and then. Also burn the game map lol!
---
not defending him but this image doesn't even show his name
---
Well they aren't blocking you and get you killed by the killer are they? They're immersed but they do gens which also helps you out. You blocking them and getting them killed aren't gonna change how they play and won't change anything at all. In fact it will actually turn against you since the killer don't need to patrol gens knowing you'd just sand bag them
---
It‚Äôs a joke that went over your head.
---
Was basically calling French Canadians worthless. Lmao. Don‚Äôt worry about it.
---
they‚Äôre sandbagging me and the whole team by using Urban Evasion
---
I want Sidney
---
I don't think that's how it works.
---
Kinda sucks we can't get Jason Voorhees, sure we have the Trapper but there's just something about him that doesn't fill the hole in my heart for the most iconic Killer there is :( Sad face
---
Of course you're not going to read it, because you don't want to deal with the overwhelming evidence supporting my side of this.
---
Good day to you.
---
Lol, that‚Äôs gonna be the butt end of allot of jokes from now on!
---
demogorgon
---
I feel that a lot of people would just think that the game isn‚Äôt actually trying to take itself seriously anymore.
---
First of all, thats quite rude of you.
---
He is a controversial streamer if you like it or not if he keeps stating sentences that most of the community disagrees with. Just because the shitheads you compare him to are considered controversial that doesnt mean they aren't just plain stupid, because they are both, controversial and dumb.
---
I have looked at the comments and some of them are really offensive but that comes with everything, hate is common and people who post it or upvote it clearly just disagree with you and don't like true.
---
Yes i do realise it, but i said (or tried to say) something completely diffrent. Requesting to not have him in the spotlight is like asking people to ignore what he says, is what i guess i tried to say.
---
"Im sure this meme isn't directed towards true" is not saying that this meme doesn't include true, because it 100% does include him, it says it's not meant to offend true as if it was made as a provocation
---
Do they do it on purpose, tell me , did they do it because they want to see you die. Did they purposely block vaults or pallets because they want you to be sacrificed. NO
---
*Rock throw

If Scooby doesn‚Äôt have a perk called Scooby snacks, you can count me out.
---
I mean people recognize an artist by their work. I never said the OP was evil for using the comic, just that we shouldn‚Äôt use a Nazi‚Äôs art, because he‚Äôs a Nazi. People shouldn‚Äôt either, because it spreads their art
---
If we could get that on PS4 it would be nice
---
Killer idea?
---
Would actually be super cool. You may have my upvote.
---
If they're scared then leave them be
---
It certainly should be.
---
Excellent idea! A great opportunity to broaden the visual style. Give me Otho as a survivor too pls.
---
Who says the demogorgon is only stuck to invading parallel dimensions?
---
Well at least the ones who are our devs are. 
---
Edit: that was mean. Sorry devs.
---
Running to strong windows with object of obsession =)
---
Huuuuuuuge message to be sent to those people.
---
700 people posting the same exact thing doesn't change it, you cunt. Saying you're about to stop playing it doesn't change anything. Either stop, or don't. No one needs a twat like you insulting people when they say it.
---
Please don't ask me why I made this.
---
Naruto Killer.
---
Believe it.
---
eh to each his own I find the hand shaking one a good meme template
---
I am OFFENDED at you flashing a gang symbol! You'll be hearing from my licensing team!
---
...nah, just kidding. Awesome work dude.
---
Maybe if you jump on a survivor they get hurt normally but if the survivor misses the skill check he falls instantly... Or maybe give during that time a sort of skill check battle between Chucky and the Survivor. I mean it's such a quirky killer so that would be an hilarious power to go against. Hard to new survivors? Maybr, but you don't learn to hit great skill checks by running from them
---
I really don‚Äôt get how people are angry or disappointed? People complain when they release patches that have bugs in them... then when they ask for more time to fix those bugs people get mad.
---
The withered blight is only technically a Halloween event, it could launch any other time tbh, it‚Äôs only it‚Äôs association with Halloween which makes it a Halloween event.
---
I love how the rope tightly fits between the small chainsaw teeth. Great job
---
Ah
---
Its true. The Meta is to do gens and escape. If the first survivor can hold the killer for a minute (60 seconds) that will be 3 gens that are 3/4 done. Once they get hooked and killer gets to another survivor, 2 gens will pop, the last survivor will get saved another survivor will start the gens and finish the 1 that got interupted, assuming it wasn't completed.
---
With Corrupt Intervention, if you get a good map, you can hold 4 gens easily (on maps like suffocation pit, which has a choke point in the centre)
---
Lol yes but it might be a bit worse for me. You see, I have a little thing called Myers PTSD xD

That's actually really cool, seeing all of the ground geometry
---
Why not a killer similar to Bub from Day of the Dead or Big Daddy from Land of the Dead yet? Some kind of an intelligent zombie that has an attack that slowly "turns" survivors during the match which would cause good zones in skill checks to get smaller or something as the match goes on. If the survivor doesn't get help, they eventually become a computer contolled thrall or something.
---
Pig has some ability to slow down the game and get the first hit and her Sasha attack can be used as anti loop so she has stealth to get a first hit a anti loop ability and a slight anti gen ability 
---
Leather Face has no anti loop abilities and will get looped for decades as will barely ever be able to get his chainsaw off he has no map pressure and is over all just a bad Hillbilly with non of the benefits if he doesn‚Äôt camp 
---
Ghost Face as the best stealth ability in the game and can disappear and reappear and make survivors sacred and really add his own kind of pressure especially with Nurses Calling
---
Really? Uh, ok. What is beginner to you because those two things are incredibly fundamental.
---
I gotta disagree with that, 4 minute games suck. Games should take like 6-12 minutes, not 4.
---
Then why do you go out of your way to sandbag those 'useless people that sandbags the whole game' instead of doing gens yourself ?
---
Tunneling is when the killer goes after a survivor to ensure their death even if it‚Äôs illogical to do so. 
---
Camping is just waiting for the survivor to die on the hook.
---
nope, unless we are both colorblind
---
You might want to give Devil Face another look in game. His horns only poke through in his base shroud (including bloody, blue, and red variants). With the Poncho and Legacy Jacket the hood sits right above the horns. Believe me, I‚Äôve played an unholy amount of Ghost Face haha
---
Solid point. Forgot some people still run this shit
---
Do you really not understand? I like chasing survivors. And when I see scratch marks 5 feet away from a hook I'm going to chase the Survivor that made those scratch marks. And they're going to run all around the hook and then I'm going to be flamed for proxy camping. Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
---
Edit: fuck man, why is everybody so hostile and quick to accuse each other of camping or being toxic? Can't even have a damn conversation here without somebody accusing me of wanting to camp.
---
No, gen rushing is not real. It‚Äôs a term that baby killers rely on when they have failed to do their job of killing the survivors. Survivors literally have no other main objective during the game. I‚Äôve literally seen killers chase a single survivor for the whole game, then complain about gen rushing in messages.
---
That‚Äôs why most good killers on Twitch use the term ironically, they know it‚Äôs not real and are mocking the countless people who whinge about it.
---
*laughs in plague* Literally throws up on everyone and goes on about her day.
---
Coming from a killer main, I know it sucks. But can you blame the survivors for doing it? It‚Äôs more of the devs‚Äô faults than the players‚Äô faults.
---
Why not more original killers :^)
---
all good i think it looks great!
---
So don't do an unsafe unhook when you know you have a camping stealth killer then. Punish them by doing objectives.
---
yah except the person you're throwing up on is actually trying to kill you and can fight back instead of just running
---
When I play killer, most of the time "gen rush" happens when I play badly. Either I'm completely outclassed in chases (and should drop'em and patrol gens) or just not playing on my level.
---
If by "gen rush" you mean a style shown by Marth's depip squad, I honestly can't remember if I ever played vs team like that. Granted, I prefer to stay out of red ranks...
---
Just see color lol
---
I could see a vampire ability working like a combo between legion and plague, where after a delay of being hit you'll succumb to the vampirism and need to go purify yourself with some second objective to avoid instadowning. And maybe it could stack from downing to killing the more you get hit in a game.
---
Stalk me daddy
---
It‚Äôs not because of the yellowjackets, killer queues just take forever in general
---
LMAO
---
I'm sure BHVR could come up with some bullshit
---
Chucky Hook Chucky Hook
---
Mate cut the bullshit. No one‚Äôs arguing that he as killer shouldn‚Äôt kill the survivors. But get it over with. This Feng is the last survivor. She got downed. Hook her and call it a game. Don‚Äôt do this petty shit of putting her next to the hatch, then giving her false hope that you‚Äôll give it to her, then closing the thing in her face. It‚Äôs unnecessary BM unless this survivor was toxic AF in the first place. Like I said, cut to the chase and get it over with.
---
As a Killer main, I can say that genrushing as it is presented is not real. It‚Äôs meant to point out the fact that gens are done way too fast and that a regular killer will have their ass handed to them if they go without bringing a gen-slowing perk. Survivors banding together to rush the objective is not bad. It‚Äôs just that the speed at which it is possible is absurd.
---
I've already seen great ideas in this thread, about him bot having a heart beat if you don't look at him, and when you do the heart beat is spread through the whole map, meaning others would panic, and good players would avoid looking at him during chases. And also penalty for looking at the killer you might get a skill check that slows you down.
---
Have him be as slow as nurse without teleport. 
---
It was an interesting idea
---
At least with Adrenaline you have to work for it, NOED just teaches Killers to be bad.
---
F for both of you
---
Then why bring it up?
---
It's a fact.. idk what's so hard to understand
---
Gens goes too fast too easily by holding one button. Devs should make the game last longer **without** making the gens themselves take longer since are boring to fix already
---
A secondary objective would be nice, especially if involves making active decisions like going to point a to point b and retrieve something to make the game proceed. It will open up to more stealthy builds and playstyle while not been boring at the same time
---
It's **not** a survivor problem. But every survivors whenever they hear the term "gen rush" they act super defensive like you're accusing them of a crime.. it's braindead logic tbh
---
Gen rush is real and proven several times. Just look it up at "Marth88" and the depip squad. Gens are be done in 3 min max if people don't goof off just to take points and focus on be efficient
---
It's been proven with coms, without coms, without perks or items and against every kind of killers, Omega blink nurse included
---
Well how about a smoke and a pancake?
---
Pipe and a crepe?
---
Cigar and a Waffle?
---
Bong and a blintze?
---
No? Then there is no pleasing you.
---
Wraiths parts are ok but otherwise I genuinely dont see why people like these
---
Yeah.
---
Eventually my Dad and I took that sign...
---
And put it up at my Aunt‚Äôs house for a prank while she was on her honeymoon.
---
Funny enough, she came back home with a cold sore. We had a great many laughs.
---
Of course it's a buff. The terror radius requirement wasn't randomly added to the perk. It's a balancing trade-off.
---
Gen Rushing is certainly a thing, but you will rarely encounter a full team of 4 BNPs and perks to make gen progress faster.
---
The main issue is that gens don't take very long to complete for a team of decent survivors and there's not much else survivors really have to do.
---
Be quiet then haha :D
---
I mean, from personal experiences I think around 60-70% of survs solo-queue but yeah other than that I agree with everything else you said.
---
I mean its in her name. She has the plague so she basically gets all of the killers sick. Even if they do manage to kill her they'll get sick and eventually die. I could imagine just getting anything of hers on your being could be contagious. She'll get the last laugh
---
I must have missed it. Where was he being salty? All I saw was him chase you to the exit gate.
---
&gt; And they're going to run all around the hook
---
That's not what good survivors usually do.
---
If I see a survivor near the hook I have zero issues with chasing them to the other side of the map. I don't care about letting "them get an easy rescue". You see the difference? You said it yourself - "I'm going to proxy Camp the area". So, it reads like you like camping more than chasing.
---
DC is.
---
You're actually breaking the EULA
---
*random humming*
---
I mainly do it for the bloody faces, but other then that no other reason. yes, I just p3 Nancy but will most likely be my last to p3.
---
Gen rushing is a thing. For instance, if I'm injured and working on a gen and someone is trying to heal me, I think to myself, "no, no let's rush this gen out." It's a particular prioritization of activities. Or if you go in alone or with a team and you bring a build of, say, a purple toolbox + add-ons and prove thyself and you make sure the other two are on separate gens and your goal is to just crank out gens and not do totems or search chests, I would say that qualifies as well as a particular gen rush playstyle. It's pretty rare to see this last one in my experience 
---
people act like gen rushing is simply doing gens and then get offended when someone uses the term but I have never seen anyone call simply doing gens "gen rushing"
---
Imagine his heartbeat is replaced by the sword dragging making his exact location incredibly hard to pinpoint.
---
Yep, I figured that out from another commenter üòÇüòÇ
---
He wouldn't be a carbon copy of the trapper Jason could use something like hatches in the ground to traverse the area fast instead of using traps kinda like demogrorgan or threw knives or grab different weapons stalk like myers bust through walls bunch of different things he could do
---
He DC‚Äôd right at the very end
---
Elaborate.
---
Just out of Otz stream and he brought a Mori 3 games in a row cause he got people to escape through the hatch in the past 2 games, just saying.
---
&gt; NOED/instant downs and instant heals.
---
like 3 of the killers in the game wouldn't really work without instant downs(LF, Billy, Myers). to a lesser extent GF as well. 
---
do you mean like pinky finger and iri heads?
---
disconnecting __a lot__ is a bannable offense
---
just get new eyes 4head
---
It depends on who I'm up against. If it's ransoms then either works because I'm probably winning. If it's swf though, ruin all day. They will just hide and wait out the 2 minutes and rush a gen if I do manage to find one of them, whereas ruin is all but guaranteed to slow downu til my first chase, and force at least one other person to be searching at worst.
---
This is partially why NOED isn't sometimes the worst idea. We gen-rushed yesterday (if it exists at all, that's what we did) and then got murdered near the doors.
---
Discordance helps break up early rushes. Tinkerer has been surprisingly helpful too on some killers. Surveillance makes gen tapping much more difficult.
---
Obviously, Ruin is more (most?) powerful if it manages to persist, but that doesn't mean it's your only option.
---
Oh no he delayed the game by 2 seconds how horrible! The humanity! Inconceivable!
---
Well some people told me that it depends of the region
---
^what ^about ^original ^killers ^though?
---
I use bond so I don't accidentally lead the killer to my teammates. This one daily I had to get chased as Jake, and got downed right outside the house my team was in right as they finished the gen
---
Dead ard?
---
Uhhh about xenomorph, what about if after two pallet stuns, then next one cuts him and throws acid on survivors injuring them. The ceiling idea is awesome but mostly useless on most maps .
---
Maybe a long range attack with it's long tail? And an inside mouth M1 and mori
---
That‚Äôs basically The Spirit
---
If you're talking about the shirt and pants, theyre the same as i was just switching the head piece
---
I will always find you, David_Bear_King. We know no boundary. Open your arms.
---
Just find the hatch lol
---
It is open. I guess I'll try to wait tomorrow around noon for a bit longer see if I get lucky. Pretty bad experience if you're a new/returning player and you'd have to wait until a particular day to play what you like :/
---
Its shitty on the killers part to leave a slug. They do that to dodge the hatch mechanic. If they are fine with the depip DC is fair game if slugged
---
A vampire would be cool
---
Honestly DCing ruins the game and this just goes to show it. I had a game yesterday where somebody dc‚Äôd to give their friend the hatch, when it should have been a 4K. When are there going to be punishments for quitting?
---
Oh, so now trees aren‚Äôt allowed to survive as well? Shame.
---
Congratulations to be the 50th person making a post about spirit today!
---
I know right it literally does without context
---
Really ? I didn't know
---
Or they could just do what you do and [DC](https://i.imgur.com/jgY6ZTR.jpg) when you get fucked on a little too hard.
---
Those are marathon runners. Sprinters actually have huge muscles.  [https://www.fitmole.org/sprinters-vs-marathon-runners/](https://www.fitmole.org/sprinters-vs-marathon-runners/)
---
Yeah yeah, I know, I'm no fun at parties.
---
I'm pretty new still and had to look it up. Seems like a pretty solid perk, might be good with a build that's good at tracking and keeping survivors hurt.
---
Yeah I hear ya man that game was a load of fun see that's were DBD messed up DBD = gens hatch or die 
---
F13= call police fix car fix boat after finding parts for any of these or die
---
Nah, IMO the most balanced thing in the game (that's also good) is spine chill or bbq
---
I was destroying people as plague for like 10 matches before I finally got her adept achievement. Something about playing her makes it really hard to get points
---
I definitely agree with you. I play both sides equally and see nothing wrong with either strategy.
---
Now he just needs to be shirtless too.
---
Same, I‚Äôm a trash killer. I‚Äôd platinum the game by now if I could actually player killer. There‚Äôs something about working alone that just doesn‚Äôt work for me. Lol 
---
Probably why I hated playing Jason in Friday the 13th too. I need the buddy system!
---
Yeah.. as well as survivors dc which are way more frequent
---
I had 4 stacks of furtive chase, cant hear me outside t3!
---
tbh as a new player it's pretty damn difficult to get more than one kill with Wraith unless I tunnel and camp a bit, so I feel called out
---
I've escaped two times in my career right as the cue went off, shit's stressful
---
It‚Äôs the potential that it has to stay up and keep running. You need some sort of gen slowdown to be able to have a chance against optimal survivors who are good about completing gen objectives. Even having one survivor out of position trying to cleanse ruin can help you snowball. The problem is the shotty spawns
---
It is a thing, but you cant really expect survivors to do anything else. That's their only job.
---
If you are having problems with it, noed is a good counter because genrushing often requires ignoring totems.
---
Dark souls are forever. 
---
Bro you on pc/xbox/ps4?
---
You're just doing mental gymnastics to justify DCs. You're not going to get banned for almost anything unless you do it a certain number of times, but I double you would apply this logic to those as well
---
Sorry, but no. I think Decisive Strike is in a good place right now. I never played the game when it used to be overpowered, but the way it is right now works just fine. As a Survivor, I rarely need or use it, but when I have it, it feels absolutely justified to have it. If someone is unhooked, healed, and making you chase them for a while, chances are that the Decisive Strike window has already closed for them.
---
The reality is, whenever I get to use it, it's either because of a Killer who is *absolutely* just out to kill me specifically for whatever reason, or because of Survivors who recklessly unhook me while playing like a coward and allowing the Killer to keep getting me instead of aiming for Altruism. If I have time to use Self Care to heal back up‚Äîwhich is slow‚Äîand continue on objectives, then the timer for Decisive Strike has already run out.
---
When I play Killer, I never have to worry about Decisive Strike. The timer is a minute at Tier 3. *One minute*. That is practically nothing. I tend to spread out my hits and downs and hooks so I keep the pressure on everybody equally, which causes the Survivors to spiral into other activities outside of working on generators, so it never really triggers for me. If I do down anybody repeatedly because of abovementioned displays of recklessness, then I will slug them for long enough to chase off other people or down someone else who's responsible for that nonsense, and by then the Decisive Strike timer will likely have already run out.
---
tl,dr; It can be a magnificent waste of a Perk slot, or it can be an absolutely fair punishment for Killers who hyper-focus on a single Survivor.
---
Did you take this in an airport?
---
Make Chucky and Give him a Gremlin costume XD I DIDN'T REALISE HOW MUCH I WANTED THIS
---
Remember when they didn‚Äôt do a Summer Event to work on Dedicated Servers instead? Lol
---
Pepsiman?
---
^^oh ^^no ^^now ^^I ^^want ^^it
---
Seems like Myers took some knife throwing lessons from Anna
---
Uuuugggg I would love that. And I was thinking they could make the same thing as Freddie's dream world, but make it Silent Hill like, where everything turns to ash!
---
"gen rush" is how people call "I can't make enough pressure in this match so i'll have to sweat for ir", sometimes it's game fault (like clown will never have enough pressure), but most of the times isn't. You see, fungoose plays on red ranks as Plague without ruin and is in a 108 win streak, that's why people say that you can't "gen rush" a Spirit, because you don't need to sweat to apply pressure as Spirit
---
You were using an ebony so you deserved it /s
---
The killer could've got booted. I've had matches end like that with me as killer and have been accused of rage quitting. I've seen survivors quit after being downed only to reply they lost connection. I've been booted after being downed, hooked, etc. It happens more than you think and sometimes looks like a rage quit. I doubt any killer would quit at that moment in a match when you are all about to escape as they would lose all their bloodpoints and not hurt you guys at all.
---
Actual cannibal Shia LaBeouf.
---
Lol BHVR can't figure out their HALLOWEEN EVENT in a game about killers and survivors.
---
See you at week 1358 my dude.
---
Only 50?!
---
It takes forever for everyone.
---
Billy and NOED. Baby ez mode. Guy obviously cant take losing.
---
Maybe not, but I can dream ;-;
---
To ghost face: What does it feel being able to meet michael [daddy] myers?
---
I‚Äôm on PC. You?
---
My boi samination
---
Why?
---
As a main Wraith in red ranks, i can tell you that using good perks and add-ons improve him A LOT. Spend money on him and improve him, he's great and fun to play with.
---
well, i had to get from lampkin lane to elm street somehow!
---
(but no, it's a convention center)
---
That was fucking clutch lol, my dumbass probably would've ran into a tree or something in that situation
---
It‚Äôs does! On PS4 with leatherface, Myers, or Freddy, which I have all of them with my base perks and if I burn this with another killer I get to use the perks I have equipped.
---
Glad to see Reddit hasn't changed in all these years. xD
---
And every survivor wasent the same some were good at keeping the killer busy others at fixing others at hiding way more variation not ok I have no idea what this meg/claudette has for perks....oh balanced landing all 4 have DS go figure in F13 if Jason catches you your dead maby come back as tommy not let me hook you so you can be free in 5 seconds to do it again
---
This needs to be a real thing.
---
It's not a mental gymnastics, it's the rules. Devs said that you won't get banned for occasional DCs. And there was never a "DC to give other survivor the hatch is bannable" rule. Unless you can provide a link, of course
---
Me wanting Look See
---
Broooo me2!
---
double bp?
---
Look for old men running and thats the best you get
---
Honestly I do kind of like the idea he presented though. Survive the killer for a minute or so when you two can see each other. The amount of generators done gives back a percentage of pallets. That way you don't have that useless random who hides the whole match and waits for teammates to die so they can take the hatch. Or so you don't have people disconnecting to beat slugging and guarantee their team a hatch.
---
Not a bad idea at all and doesn't really reward failing like the trap door does. I play Both Sides equally and personally I find the hatch just as annoying as a Survivor because it incentivizes teammates who did nothing the whole match to let their allies die so they can escape.
---
[\*plays keyboard solo of pepsi man\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z54MpfR3XE4)
---
Are you sure he didn‚Äôt D/C because of the Mori?
---
At the end the killer immediately stops in his tracks and the game ends. On console usually there‚Äôs a delay some reason when the killer leaves
---
I'm not sure you understand analogies. 
---
&gt;Pipe and a crepe?
---
&gt;Cigar and a Waffle?
---
&gt;Bong and a blintze?
---
If I had any of these alternatives to Pie, that would be the equivalent to getting something else besides the event like Double BP. Instead there is nothing.
---
Is that a problem with OP builds and people DCing, or a problem with that guys idea? Seems like you're just here to vent about bad things in the game and not actually contribute.
---
Slugging is perfectly fair and often smart. They're winning the game why should they purposefully give the survivors a chance to get out without doing the objective.
---
Sadness :( I'm on the vastly superior inferior xb1x.
---
Which survivor you might want to start with/perks you want to start looking after., getting skillchecks, not to try to escape on the hook, when it's safe to unhook.
---
No, the guy saw that i exposed him with the stalk and then dc in front of me
---
Nurse treatment incoming if we're lucky. Legion's if not.. the worst case scenario Freddy nerf when launched
---
People DC too much and BHVR bows to whom does it against certain things. Next Huntress iri then hillbilly chainsaw and so on till bubba
---
man i ain‚Äôt taking shit serious. i‚Äôm a killer main, it‚Äôs just that easy not to be a dick about it. he should kill them, but teasing them? that‚Äôs discouraging and honestly, you‚Äôre being unreasonable. it‚Äôs just mean and that‚Äôs bad lmao i don‚Äôt know why that‚Äôs hard for people to process
---
When i first started playing I thought it was pretty scary.  The Hag popping out still gets me sometimes.
---
Passive ability can be crawling, channel to climb in a straight line up/over obstacles within reason to mindfuck loopers, which when she stands still and tastes the air to see auras within a small radius to herself, her acid blood, which corrodes pallets when stunned to destroy them after a certain timer runs down, and her agile crawl which gives her increased move speed with a slightly reduced terror radius. Her power options are limitless.
---
How long into the game were you?
---
Yakety sax?
---
Op idea: people that didn't made enough points in the match shouldn't have a hatch.
---
My point: you can have few points even tho you did your best.
---
Your point?
---
Xenomorph Ideas:
---
Power: Long Range Tale Attack
---
Extra: Every two pallets that hit him the next one cuts him and spills acidic blood on the survivor hurting them / Fast four leg running with X seconds cooldown before you can attack (gen patrolling)
---
M1: Attacks with inner mouth
---
No clue about perks tho... I feel like Rancor would be the perfect Xenomorph Perk but it's already on spirit...
---
I'm a survivor main and I hate the idea of Darryl being added. Gimme Columbus or Tennessee from Zombieland and then we'll talk
---
damn ok demo is stronk
---
Just because it takes a certain number to get a ban doesn't mean that DCing isn't generally against the rules and bannable. You're also not going to get banned for holding a game hostage once. Would you use that same logic you're applying to DCing there? Or are you a hypocrite?
---
I know, but he's my only dived killer (around level 15 or so), so I can't do much right now. I do like him a lot, but I swear to all that's sacred that survivors sometimes drive me nuts with bodyblocking, looping and teabagging. If only the add-ons for getting in and out of the bell were baseline...
---
I know you get a small reward when survivors leave for everyone else and you lose BP but yeah I agree.
---
Gen rush to me is when you‚Äôre doing really good, constantly hooking all survivors....but the gens just go ping, ping, ping. This tends to happen on killers like Clown, who lack map pressure.
---
If you were getting looped all game or constantly losing survivors you expect to lose. However when you‚Äôre chases are all really short and the hooks are back to back then it can be frustrating as you did the best you could have possibly done given the killer and map you had and it‚Äôs still not enough.
---
It feels at those points theres little you could have done different, aside from try to camp or tunnel which isn‚Äôt fun for anyone.
---
Some killers just lack the map pressure needed to consistently avoid genrush. Some maps are simply too big for the killers to control.
---
We've already lost our midnight offerings
---
My heart is forever broken. Cross play, one day, one can only hope :(
---
I agree but frankly I‚Äôd rather have Fred and the gang with the killer of Captain Cutler
---
In the start of the game, but he was doing a gen, so i really don't think that was because of the mori
---
the offering and add on costs more money than the money u got from the game lmao
---
I think you're lost, friend.
---
Chucky is my favorite serial killer! I‚Äôd love to see that. Instead of him picking us up, just imagine him dragging us by the arm to the hook. And he‚Äôd be so hard to see because he‚Äôs so short! Aww.
---
As a survivor main, I'd be excited to see all three.
---
Personally, I want something like one of those crazy horror vampires from The Strain. Guillermo Del Toro is a [fucking master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn4ERfzaiVw) of creature design. It fits perfectly with Spirit, being a combination of real world folklore and a bit of film popularity. And the way they move is creepy like Spirit too. Wish I could link you guys one of the subway scenes.
---
I imagine they could have a perk where they infect one of the survivors with those horrible worms, triggering an Obsession mechanic that sabotages the obsession's efforts or something.
---
Love all the classic tacoman references in it
---
The level of the perk
---
Yeah :/
---
That stuff is fundamental to beginners but that doesn't mean basic looping mechanics isn't also fundamental to beginners. I don't see why things like "run on the long side" and "watch for that red light" wouldn't also be in the same category as what you listed
---
It was probably a mixture of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm up against a ghost face who already exposed me, and he has a Mori. I‚Äôm fucked.‚Äù And just decided to leave.
---
Why not make it so killers have to activate dull totems for their hex to start working? For instance NoEd wouldn't be able to be activated until egc, just make totems have an Aura if you have an available hex to place
---
But Noed is now easily counterable with Nancy's Inner Strength perk, not sure of how often its used though but still new people will be using it.
---
I‚Äôm not sure you understand references
---
Come and down and get some corn ... or we will sacrifice your new born
---
Lmao he was not having any of it.

Then you‚Äôd notice their about 95% positive feedback and helpful tipsüëç
---
Demogorgon is such a slut, will open their mouth for anybody üôÑ
---
i dont know how people do it every game honestly. i get bored walking around a hook even when i know people are there.....how do people not get bored just standing next to a hook for 2 minutes?
---
That might be a possibility, but personally I still believe he quit after I destroyed his NOED and all survivors escaped.
---
/r/dbdtrade i think they go for 120 dollars
---
oh
---
Sorry, bro. Opinions are banned, says so in the rules.
---
Camping is such a bad idea, I only played survivor before yesterday and have been playing Legion who everyone seems to think is shit but I am not struggling at all without camping and camped my first match and could barely find a soul.
---
Both penny wise and pinhead could potentially bring me back.
---
Yeah, people are busing preparing Halloween parties so..
---
I understand the concept of references despite not recognizing that one. 
---
How does that particular reference apply to this  discussion?
---
True it was so dark, I got lucky! Nah playing on Xbox
---
I second this.
---
It's called waiting for dad
---
Are dedicated servers out right now? I can't find a lobby with more than 100 ping.
---
Just heal the slugged survivor lmao.
---
Pyramid head is SLOW. But when a survivor gets hit a timer starts, slowly adding guilt to survivors until they help the injured. Meter rate doubles when someone gets hooked, and when it maxes their guilt meter brings them to silent hill where pyramid head can see their aura from any distance. He's slow, but he knows where you are, and you've been deemed guilty.
---
I respect it, but it annoys the hell out of me. I usually try to ignore them but they just keep body blocking
---
That‚Äôs me tomorrow, don‚Äôt remind me. Lol.
---
This is great
---
There will always be bugs in any game you play. The problem is that they say a bug is fixed and then its still there.
---
On PC and obviously switch yea
---
This is a flawed argument. Slugging is not fun but it‚Äôs effective at some points in the game. For example the killer can slug the survivor to go and find the hatch or the last survivor. Slugging just for the hell of it? Yeah it‚Äôs shitty. But it has its purpose oftentimes
---
I‚Äôm that Michael in the back, so that‚Äôs cool
---
&gt; you‚Äôre being unreasonable
---
so are people in here shitting on a guy just cause he teased a hatch
---
you'd think he kicks puppies during his free time
---
No no, DBD is in equilibrium the most it will ever be XD 
---
The Survivors are as good if they can work together nicely and the Killers are good if they can use their Perks and playstyles optimally. Hatch is there as a last resort if the Killer plays _too_ well.
---
Bruh, We need one of the villains from AHS like twisty
---
Dark souls never die.
---
 I'll be here my friend.
---
Where's the panel for the survivors who idiotically run into the killer after an unhook, or the saviors who leave the unhooked survivors to try to hide on their own.
---
Well yeah. A 3k with a hatch escape is still a win. I never played on the old hatch so I cant comment but I dont like slugging if I'm playing survivor or killer, THAT seems toxic. Its not fun for the person left on the ground and the hatch is meant to be a last chance for survivors anyway. I dont know why you'd be so salty about it killers find it first about half the time anyway.
---
The pigs crouch ability isn‚Äôt an antiloop ability you can easily see her and plus once people see that it‚Äôs a pig most survivors know to look around when doin gens. So that cancels out your point of her ability being an anti loop/ anti gen
---
That would be quite cool.
---
Sorry that me speaking the truth is so triggering for you.
---
No I'm not complaining about killers trying to kill.  I'm complaining about the lack of respect and consideration shown by wasting that much of the opponents time when the EGC is already firmly in killers favor.  Just man up and close it man.  It's easy and you're likely to beat them to it being faster.
---
Also that is false.  Unless you're playing Trapper or Plague or someone it is easy to pip off a 3K if you don't play with babystrats (ie no camping and tunneling).  Those of us that play aggressively, pressure gens and swap targets have no problem pipping off a 3k.
---
I barely have any problems with lag anymore. Just sometimes as killer survivors just disappear in front of me and teleport a bit, but it's quite rare
---
Thankskilling is a must watch for anyone who hasn't seen it
---
i only use corrupt on trapper
---
Yeah I'm not saying they don't deserve the scorn they are getting, but its definitely not an easy choice to delay it. But that 20$ Steam card I bought it getting a little hard to save. :\
---
While skill checks have different starting points and hit zones, they always move the same, allowing you to learn them, so i wouldn't count them as RNG.
---
The other things you mentioned are though, and are frequently mentioned by tru3. That's pretty much the point i wanted to make, they are detrimental to a competitive game, thus tru3 is not fond of them.
---
If the game would be less fun as a competitive version i can't say. It would be a whole lot different and probably turn off a big part of the playerbase (probably the majority of people in rank 20-10). But i'd be lying if i said i wouldn't want to see a pure skill based version of the game (including fixed hitboxes and lag at vaults)

He has to be able to grow a better beard if he wants that moniker
---
People get mad because they advertise the date of the event for weeks then pull it after last second. This fucks over many working people who took days off for this. Plus their track record is terrible.
---
This may come out in november, they might also pull a microsoft and release it 6 months later.
---
First they often keep a close tryhard eye on where that body is and patrol it regularly.  2nd even if you pick them up they just turn around and redown shortly afterwards or worse down you instead which resets the wasted timer now because now it's the other player bleeding out.  This typically continues until he eventually has one on ground and the other in chase.  You know this is the most likely scenario for that. It's extremely rare where the survivors actually recover from that scenario and go on to beat the killer and you know it.  Cheese slugging to prevent egc is about as free as free gets when it comes to that 4k.
---
They're all kinds of messed up, it's not just that, I've had killer ones just randomly switch to other killer ones, finished survivor ones switch to a different survivor one, then completing a killer one right before reset and just not getting a new daily.
---
"Do you favor horror films?"
---
So? We have two bois with chainsaws
---
I interpreted it to mean the more survivors you hit the less cool down.
---
Who says he is not?
---
Yo, thanks man. I really appreciate it. üòÅü§ô
---
HAHA That's fucking great!
---
Its not always a free ride, true, but it is utter, random luck, not skill, that earns you the hatch, 100% of the time. You don't "earn" the hatch, you get lucky and find it. Having a way for the last survivor to get out is fine, but it should be skill based, not what it is now, if you ask me.
---
im chill when this happens, if the Survivor didnt run away yet, i nod and try to tell them "go away the match continues the next time i see ya".
---
Your rank shouldn't prevent matchmaking completely. It may just lead to increased queue times. In my area, killer takes longer to find a game as well, as the game requires 4 times as many survivors queueing up.
---
Maybe see if you can get a game as survivor to determine if it's matchmaking/game population, or if it's your connection.
---
omg you know me so well, my expectations IS REALLY LOW and they still dissapointed me.
---
"roses are red chocolate is brown i expect nothing and i'm still let down"
---
She can be hit by pallets. This inherently means she can be hit by, and presumably killed by, an axe
---
But there's no real way to confirm or deny it so it doesn't matter much
---
When I play survivor I have a 50/50 chance of either getting into a match or get stuck in an infinite connecting screen that forces me to reload the game.
---
What did you use to make this? It looks really good.
---
Thats how _Bond_ is meant to be used. Friends kill eachother best!
---
NoED and Mori's are consistently complained about. With inner strength in the game and detectives hunch buffed (is that live or on the blight patch?), you shouldnt have a reason to complain about NoED anyway. Mori's should be changed, and noone disagrees with that.
---
Blood Warden is not a second chance and it has counterplay. You need to hook someone with a gate already open (which survivors often 99 when you are carrying someone) for BW to activate. This is assuming survivors didn't already leave and are sitting in the gates for you to see them.
---
How is Dying Light a second chance perk? This makes no sense.
---
Again, a single intentional DC is not bannable. And two are not bannable also. You need to DC quite a bit over lots of games.
---
its called "DC". if a killer is being a fucking greasy sweaty nerd I will DC and not think twice
---
Exactly
---
I meant about saving greens
---
Anyone that BMs is going to get shit on. Especially when it‚Äôs not justified.
---
And a single instance of almost any offense is not bannable. So i guess essentially nothing is bannable then.
---
(I knew you weren't going to be consistent from the get go)
---
Oh ok, I thought you meant bugs in general. mb
---
Out of all of the villains you could pick from, you pick them?
---
And that's exactly why this argument is pointless
---
i doubt someone like myers would fall over a hit with bell.
---
That's funny as hell
---
Then what about as a draw back, for every solo player in the match up to 2, the killer loses one perk slot. 
---
The whole ‚Äúif you‚Äôre nothing without these perks you need to get good or don‚Äôt deserve to run them or whatever‚Äù is such a flawed argument because it entirely overlooks the usefulness and necessity of using such perks. If we were talking about old mettle of man, I‚Äôd agree, but for perks like DS or BT, perks that provide game changing benefits at important times, those perks are there to give power to players at a time in which they would have no power otherwise.
---
Almost every killer runs Ruin, or BBQ, or Whispers, or Enduring, and PGTW is being used more and more every day. Should we place limitations on how often killers get to use such perks? After all, if you‚Äôre nothing without the perks, you don‚Äôt deserve them in the first place.
---
I have my own gripes with DS, and I‚Äôm not claiming that swf can‚Äôt abuse its communication, (see OoO) but DS and BT can be played around even when there are four of them, and placing restrictions on what perks people can use is not the answer.
---
Shut up Jason your not my REAL dad!

He and bill can fight the Vietcong together ;‚Äô)
---
"I'm kicking her ass, Meg!"

I love how hope activates after this shitshow üòÇ

Survivor mains when they die one or two games in a row: "Oh well just moving on to the next game :)"
---
Killer mains when they don't get any kills one game: "OMFG TOXIC SURVIVORS ARE FUCKING OP!!!!?!?! WTFFF IDIOT DEVS NERF THEM ALREADY OR I QUIT"
---
Look at it from a killer point of vieuw. Many of them wouldn‚Äôt be able to hold their current rank if they can‚Äôt use their meta perks. At rank 1 you might have a point. But a lot of players arn‚Äôt rank 1. Your nerf would be to strong against all those other players. 
---
The mori nerf is a good idea. But killer builds would need some ballancing to, as not every killer brings the mori offering every game. 
---
Telling people to git gud, doesn‚Äôt work if you take their perks away that could aid them in improving their skills. It just makes you sound like another toxic player who has no qlue on how to have a proper argument.
---
So it‚Äôs a total coincidence that I haven‚Äôt had a survivor challenge in over a month? I don‚Äôt mind it, I‚Äôm a killer main but I often used them as a reason to play survivor
---
At least I still have H O P E üòÇü§£ü§£
---
Oh God I would pay so much money for this
---
I agree with this tierlist but bubba is really bad that‚Äôs the only thing I disagree I think he should be put next to wraith Ngl but other then that it‚Äôs good o and move pig up she is not that bad
---
I think it's just absurdly bad lag because I can't imagine why a lag switch would be necessary to BM here
---
Who could forget Creeper, Shadowperson, PEPSIMan and NEA of the HOOKERs?
---
I still can‚Äôt understand why people think Legion is annoying. Having to mend every once and a while really isn‚Äôt too bad IMO
---
Personally I think the largest issue with legions ability is the fatigue legion gets from ending their ability or coming out of it from getting a second survivor. Many times I see that when they fatigue survivors are able to easily get away to a jungle gym or take advantage of balanced landing. It's useful in getting that first hit on multiple survivors but then they become an m1 killer for the second hit.
---
Personally I think a good buff would be to have their movement speed stay at 125% after their fatigue ends for 4 or so seconds. Survivors still have a chance to get away but then legion can catch back up.
---
Other than that I think they need a compete rework.
---
Do 3rd party comms give you an advantage that was not provide initially? Do 3rd party comms mean they are not a part of a game client? These are cheats and good ones, because there is no way you can trace it. 
---
Devs are saying it is allowed because they cannot do anything about this, don't you think it would be silly if they forbid these programmes but had no way to limit the usage of such programmes? I bet if they could do anything about this, they would've done it 3 years ago before this cancer grew too big to be removed.
---
You told OP not to post on Reddit prick. I think that's insulting. 
---
Every day I see posts in this sub about shit that's been posted hundreds and hundreds of times before already. What's new? Maybe we should just close the fucking sub down?
---
Nobody has forced you to read the details of all those alleged 700 posts you speak of. Here's a tip. Read the title. Not interested? Move on cunt.
---
Can't enjoy these comics once I learned about the artist.
---
I had two guys DC on me when I was playing Ghostface a few nights ago and I knew they were a 4-man swf. So I messaged one of them after asking if they thought I was being an asshole and he said no it was his brother and his friend and they just hate playing against him haha.
---
There is only one licensed killer we need and that's Candyman
---
'the truth" which is about humor which is subjective.. sure buddy
---
A little bit pretentious
---
not if they sandbag me smh
---
You must eat a lot of sandwiches
---
lol seriously, this dude was throwing them
---
How are you gonna disrespect my Bing Bong Boi like this?
---
The most annoying build is the insidious basement facecamp bubba. Especially if it's you who gets to enjoy 2 minutes of private time with bubba while he stares into your soul.
---
FOOKIN' QUINTON
---
Or, you could try and help him out since he didn‚Äôt say any of that. You know, being nice and stuff.
---
They call is maize because it‚Äôs easy to get lost in its magnificent flavor.
---
This is bm? No, this is a massive overreaction.
---
Hey no worries, just because of this fickle community I'm gonna run pink mori and tease the hatch in all my games for the next few hours. This is bm, not what this guy did.
---
Dude.. in high ranks nobody use noed because get denied every game..
---
Just get good if you cry about noed in 2019
---
His terror radius is ME HOY MINOY and his weapon is THE PENCIL
---
Have you thought about why ? maybe your gameplay just isn‚Äôt optimal.
---
god you are so dense, stop talking please. this is a video game, they could make the dudes less bulky if they wanted to.
---
Template?
---
You know theyre already changing the syringes/styptic in the next update right?
---
edit: oops, misread that first part of the post. But I think the new syringes are fair, Im not sure I agree with your changes
---
You can move but you're very limited, Was referring to Frosty Nights and Boogeyman are the same,
---
You literally just fucking did xD and yes I was I think Id know considering I wrote it and you didnt xD What an idiot.
---
Sadly the game doesn't have the playerbase to justify having separate queues.
---
Uhhh it was an option? You can do something with the power. Cause most others are just people trying to scare people off for a reason, they're one of the few that actually tried to kill....also it's my childhood????
---
25% are 25%
---
So I watched the video and I think it‚Äôs actually a really good idea. It makes the endgame fun for both sides and rewards you based on skill, not by getting lucky.
---
Love the sense of entitlement off of the killers here that mandatory slug the 3rd survivor to cheese the hatch spawn.  You aren't entitled to waste our time while you continue playing YOUR game.  MINE is over.  Do the right thing hook me and then go find and close your hatch.  If you slug everygame to cheese the hatch spawn you have no right to get mad about it when the survivor decides not to allow you to hold their game temporarily hostage while you continue selfishly playing your game.  The entitlement is mind blowing to me for killers that do this and are like fuck that survivor he is such an asshole.  I promise you if the roles were reversed and survivors could end the killers game and force them to crawl around for 3 minutes while they kept playing theirs, this sub would absolutely be lit the fuck up like a Christmas Tree with salt posts.  But it's just survivors so fuck em amirite?
---
My prediction is either on Halloween itself or the day after.
---
I would love even if we just got a cosmetic pack like they did with the Left 4 Dead characters.
---
At least some of the DLC and the main game are on sale in the xbox store.
---
I dunno it sounds kind of like small drums or something?
---
When the actual fuck did I tell then to not post on Reddit? I said to just stop playing it and there's no need to post about it. So, maybe, use your eyes.
---
Thank you very much. It looks fantastic! I love Freddy. Wish we had Robert England Freddy, aka (The real Freddy).
---
Our day shall come!
---
Plague to an extend as well
---
A single proved instance of legacy hacking will get you banned. A single proved instance of hate speech in after game chat will get you banned. Not permanently, though
---
Love them allüëç keep up the great work, looks amazing
---
It's a p2p game. Transfer it to a dedicated server takes time and a lot of tests
---
Just wait to finish working on them.. god damn it you people. First you cry about having servers and now you cry because they are running tests to provide a better experience in the future
---
What do you want exactly???
---
I understand the big update but can't they at least release an update like the Hallowed Blight? Surely it can't be that difficult. It's only 4-5 days of SPOOK-tober
---
Exqctly this.
---
Thankskilling 3 is on youtube legally. It's the better of the two.
---
hootreds
---
Yeah I don't like to call "HACCCXKERZ". Just the weirdest lag I've personally experienced in the game and the setup with the hatch struck me as odd.
---
...Yeah, that is two things, and I said that **most** things require more than one instance.
---
Are you even reading my comments?

Forever Freddy. Pick 4:

---
catching (grapping a survivor in their action) works only in 2/9 Scenario's, what happens is your killer want's to catch, but ~~BHRV~~ game kicks you back into doing nothing, wich means you have to press M1 a second time to get at least a hit.
---
The only time a DC was somewhat legit was vs Infinite Mend Legion. Having to mend for 5 minutes isn‚Äôt fun or engaging, it‚Äôs just bullshit.
---
My response: "You Bastard".
---
Can we shut up about stonetoss for 5 minutes. Every time I see one of his comics there's always some circle jerk in the comments about how he's the devil incarnate. Just post the damn comic and learn to separate the art from the artist.
---
It‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs at the other side of the room because he‚Äôs the head of the group, and therefore not in the shot. 
---
Hmmmmm....
---
Naw, whenever I do play survivor I'm too busy rushing generators while injured and escaping to be slugged for a 4k.
---
you are a saint!
---
It‚Äôs not about seeing her sit at a pallet charge and then turn really quickly to make that person run close enough to hit them high tier players do it all the time
---
I‚Äôm being randomly kicked out as well.
---
it doesnt, at all
---
Erm.....your post above that literally began:
---
"So....Don't post it on Reddit."
---
Downvote this fact too you silly fucking prick.
---
Wow what an outplay losing your bloodpoints and making the game easier for the one person you're DCing because you hate...3000 IQ play right there
---
Always go for the hero plays. If you don't, escaping is meaningless.
---
&gt;TL;DR: It‚Äôs ludicrous that Spirit wasn‚Äôt an issue before. Why now?
---
Idk.. I agree with that but then they get out with the excuse "I did when she got launched".. which is bs
---
I think some streamer/post about her got semi-viral and now every person cry about her even if she isn't been touched for OVER A YEAR but only recently people get pissed about her..
---
Like.. ok.. let's nerf every killer to bubba level at this point so people won't ever get a single lobby. Since I see already people wanting to see huntress nerfed and demo too after nurse got the meme add ons treatment
---
If you write a macro for "left, a, right, d" and it goes fast enough, it can work.
---
I‚Äôve seen someone urban from more than 40 meters away trying to unhook me. By the time they got to me someone from across the map was able to run and make the unhook before them. Afterwards they urban‚Äôd all the way back to their gen while i ran ahead of them to get to it. Incredible how much time they waste
---
you dont get why people are unhappy with a dev studio that continuously fucks up/isnt transparent and has ample time to prepare for a once a year event but has failed miserable time and time again? really?
---
***this is the only time i will see legion in B tier and i want it to last***
---
Someones gonna walk around the corner and shit themselves lol
---
But they‚Äôll have new cosmetics :)
---
this sub is so wierd, why 8 downvotes? XD
---
Legion is the mosquito of killers, he‚Äôs fast, but not strong. His attack kinda forces you to stop what you are doing and hold a single button for a bit, he‚Äôs annoying because unlike all other killers he has no tension and his appearance kills all flow of a match
---
&gt;I DC because its unfun to play against and I play games to have fun.
---
Cool, you're breaking the EULA and you shouldn't playing if you can't take a lost
---
&gt;On top of that, there is NO counter play
---
Nice story you tell to yourself to not improve or change game
---
Who are you to try to silence others?
---
this has been on my list for a while. need to finally try it
---
I mean, I'm pretty sure a single use of a rock exploit will get you banned, just like other cases of intentionally taking game hostage. If other side has a proof.
---
Insidious bubbas have been dying down in my experience, and that‚Äôs a single build. Most other bubbas are just kinda there.
---
You're making it sound as if I told him to not use Redfit anymore. I said not to post it on Reddiy, yes, but that's the same thing as saying not to post it at all.
---
And you've been downvoting mine, you "silly fucking prick." 
---
I'd really like to stop wasting the times of both of us, because this is really quite pointless. Though, of course, you'll likely continue insulting me over literally nothing, because this started as nothing as well.
---
Why shouldn't be post his opinion, also emojis are for dummies, they don't belong here
---
Are you blind?? The last gen popped as soon as they were 99% done cleansing that totem that turned hex.
---
love jump scare myers. The nurse one sounds really interesting.
---
It depends on where I am in the game. 3 gens done and no hooks? Yeah I'm going to tunnel your ass to sacrifice.
---
I want Candyman and the Pinhead

I'm just tired of people disingenuously covering their bases after posting an edit of some comic. Nobody who is worth listening to really cares because they know it's an edit.

Latency
---
id rather lose a small amount of BP than lose more time/energy/motivation to play by sitting around in a game where the whole team has been slugged because the killer wants to play that way. its lame enough waiting 5 minutes for a lobby, im not going to spend another 5 minutes slugged on the ground in a game. the 300iq move IS to DC
---
fuck all of you.
---
THE BITCH FROM GRUDGE
---
How long are you waiting? It often takes me \~5 minutes. Note with the new system you'll stay on the "searching for games" screen with no lobby for nearly the entire wait, but when a lobby does appear, it should be full/nearly full already.
---
Due to unforeseen circumstances we have disabled the endgame portion of the game
---
I just hope they don‚Äôt ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù it out of reflex
---
Can someone ELI5? I‚Äôm rarely play and don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm watching ;-;
---
S p o o k y  B i t c h
---
I mean, they‚Äôre not gonna stop releasing cosmetics because the update got delayed. I don‚Äôt exactly see the correlation.
---
Nah, mostly its just "Check out this cool Legion cosplay by @dickfucky69 !"
---
I refuse to have a battle of wits with an unarmed opponent.
---
Oo you did? can I see
---
I couldn't tell you precisely when, but I know Devs have definitely expressed that they don't want to split the playerbase, so I don't think ranked/casual is a likely addition unless that changes :) Happy Halloween!
---
Don't forget the rest of Legion at the back.
---
There‚Äôs a chance they were booted as that‚Äôs been happening quite a bit recently, but it does seem more like a rage quit
---
Because instead of fixing core elements to the game, all they do is just happily add more and more cosmetics to the game.
---
‚ÄúDon't believe in yourself. Believe in me! Believe in the Dad who believes in you!‚Äù
---
"Due do unforeseen circumstances this joke is postponed"
---
What killer and outfit are you wearing?
---
Mate it can be done once in a game, or be done several games in a row. The point still stands. If teabagging is widely considered as BM (which it should) then this should be BM as well.
---
I'm spooky and I know itüëÄüëÑ
---
5 minutes? Killers have to wait 10-15, have more stressful games and have a harder time "winning" according to the game's standards. They have every right to slug when there are multiple anti-slug perks in the game (Unbreakable, Tenacity, Flip-Flop, and [I count this one as well] Adrenaline).
---
I want pyramid head
---
Oooh pig can get a hit in at a pallet so can all the other killers. Leatherface can destroy that pallet with his chainsaw there goes that loop.
---
Hag main for the win!
---
You do realize the devs aren‚Äôt the one making the cosmetics, right?
---
What core elements would you like them to fix?
---
What‚Äôs BHVR
---
Well, for me that already happened before
---
i want another original killer and an SCP
---
Seriously that thing looks really good. :)
---
I'm out of the loop here. Why fuck him?
---
Tell me. Are you having the same problems as OP? Are you repeatedly getting kicked out of lobbies, getting repeated errors, having to restart the game multiple times from the lobby freezing up? Or does your game run perfectly?
---
Tell me. Can you not relate to OP feeling down about this happening in a game they clearly like and want to play but can't?
---
Did you depip?
---
No she can get a hit on pallets that some killers can‚Äôt. Have you seriously never seen a pig do this it‚Äôs like one of the biggest things you need to know for Pig
---
they can slug if they want and Ill DC if i want
---
LEGEND. Hope you got out cuz he was tryna BM
---
Scrappy-Doo killer, when??
---
Sorry to ask, but what is depip?
---
"Why are killers so disrespectful to survivors? It's like they are trying to kill them or something."
---
If endgame collapse has started, survivors are at their strongest barring the beginning of the game. They are at almost no risk until the timer is low because they can just run out the exits whenever they want.
---
You say it's easy to pip off a 3k, so you must not be at high ranks or only play the best killers. It's an epidemic that you clearly aren't aware of.
---
Consider: you‚Äôre working on a gen and you‚Äôre almost done, you don‚Äôt know who the killer is, and suddenly you hear a loud MIHOY MINOY echoing across the map like the Demogorgon roar.
---
It's latency

Servers, hitreg (goes hand in hand with servers), balance (perks for both survivor and killer), balancing killers, a change to endgame to make it more of an enjoyable experience for the last remaining survivor(s) and killer. Just a few things off the top of my head
---
Edit: Also punishing players that dc too often. Ruins the game for both sides.
---
From a game play standpoint, there is no significant benefit to prestiging. You prestige for, well, exactly what it says on the tin‚Äîthe prestige. It certainly won't help you get a particular perk any faster‚Äîin fact, with 4 perks on your level 50 webs, staying 50 is the fastest way to get new perks. Just keep buying 2 every web, eventually Discordance will have to show up because it will be the only perk left. :P
---
You may want to quit wasting your time, he isn‚Äôt listening.
---
What do survivors do when they find the hatch before the killer? They stick around to teabag and prove they found it for no reason but to be a dick. This is a reverse killer teabag. Bitching about it is pretty yikes.
---
I had a Freddy slug me yesterday and close the hatch in my face, I had adrenaline, got up in front of him and had a looted key and won the game. I thanked him for trying to close the hatch in my face instead of picking me up. It helped me win.
---
I don‚Äôt know I think both chuck and gremlin deserve their own chapter I say we get Grenlin as the December chapter and have Chucky as the next killer after that or something or maybe as the paragraph coming up we could have Chucky but people are predicting Penny Wise which is also cool
---
Go ahead. You bought the game.
---
Fuck outta here with that. Stop twisting something that‚Äôs always been a thing like it‚Äôs now new and ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù. Slugging requires there to be another alive and searched out.  Either do gen(s) or get the guy up. If  there are still many gens left, then the killer dominated and most likely deserves a 4K.  With the popping system for killers, a situation like that usually requires the 4K in order not to de-rank or be rewarded for a strong performance.
---
If you don't like TrU I don't like you. LINKAGE.
---
Yeah, I made it out. He only got a 1k, wouldn't have even gotten that if we didn't screw up on the save.
---
Woah he looks like John wick from fortnite
---
May I ask why you play this game? Your post history is basically you just whining about it- and a lot of these posts aren‚Äôt even recent, you‚Äôve been doing this for a while. So why do you even play this game if you dislike so many things about it?
---
&gt; If teabagging is widely considered as BM (which it should) then this should be BM as well.
---
Well it's subjective isn't it? I don't consider tbagging as bm even though it happens often to me. Why should it be? I don't think it should and until bhvr releases an official rulebook and guidelines of what determines what bm is then we can only sit here and argue until our faces turn blue.
---
2 games in so far, teased the hatch once and mori'd 5 people. It's going well!
---
Some people just want to see dcler banned. :)
---
Thanks
---
You don't get it, do you? 
---
I'm not saying you didn't mean bugs or toxicity, but because you never actually brought it up it doesn't matter what you meant because the context for the conversation has nothing to do with them.
---
What you meant and what you actually said are two very different things. Just suck it up and accept you screwed up.
---
You do you bud
---
Honestly, that looks pretty fucking cool.
---
Most likely cause i don‚Äôt own them
---
This is so cool, thanks for sharing something nice with us. :)
---
Memento Mori means "remember death" in latin.
---
This is clearly not a ragequit. He was reving up. His character even glitches then the match ends. Seems more likely something happened to the connection.

not a lot of dbd content out there; i'll take what i can get.
---
All of these old dudes could totally kick my ass.
---
&gt;It's kind of silly to expect that level of balance in an asymmetrical game though, imo.
---
Not just an opinion, its a fact. This game will never, EVER have good balance. It should have just stuck to being a casual party game and not have a stupid rank system to begin with.
---
I play both sides: I am not actually biased: it was a joke
---
I‚Äôve stopped playing because about 2 in 3 times I try to SWF one of us goes without the other which means we have to completely reload the game and then partner back up. 4 months ago it would‚Äôve been fine but SWF queues are 5+ minutes now so it‚Äôs roughly 5-20 minutes of doing nothing because of whatever the fuck they‚Äôve done to matchmaking since Stranger Things launched. I started when Ghostface launched and I don‚Äôt know if I was too new to see bugs or recognize them but that build was so much nicer overall.
---
Are yoy The Entity,op?
---
They're ranting, I get that. I truly do. But there's no point in telling everyone you're about to stop playing. Either you stop or you don't. That's on you, not anyone else. Not a whole lot of people seem to understand it.
---
Yeah, DBD does seem to have a lot of problems along that score.  (The bloodweb sounds are insanely loud, I think to create a Pavlovian response).  I always wondered how high people turn up games in their headphones.  I already have hearing loss and tinnitus, so I'm really careful about what I expose myself to.  DBD streamers will all be deaf by 50.  I'll probably live with not hearing the totems.  I'm also a bad killer because I can't perceive directional survivor noises well, but hearing is more important :)
---
Appreciated really much
---
In that case, I agree that the creeper shouldn‚Äôt be in the game. Though isn‚Äôt there a way to just pay the studio and not the director? Unless the studio themselves are filled with pedophilic sociopaths.
---
The only killer that I can think of that is scarier than the Demogrogon is Spirit.
---
What? Survivors chilling at the exits isn't toxic, didn't you read section 4.1 addendum C of the survivor rule book?
---
Fantastic movie btw.
---
Legion mains are tilted lol

^lmao ^holy ^shit ^do ^you ^write ^fantasy? ^you're ^good ^at ^it
---
This is one of the most Halloween themed games and every other game on the planet has an event. It‚Äôs one heck of a fucking sillyboy to not have a Halloween event on DBD
---
Not saying that it wasn‚Äôt bad timing but people should know by now that in all of gaming you never take off for a patch day. I don‚Äôt know why people do. It‚Äôs always queue times or bugs or delays or wrong builds or crashes or it bricks your machine. Just not worth it. Take the day after patch day off lmao.
---
I feel like Ghostface moris just BEG to be photobombed!?!?!? I love it. I actually love any mori bombing, I think it's really cute and funny ;P
---
Nea new killer confirmed
---
What I mean is the blight is a Halloween event only by people saying it is
---
The event could easily happen in the summer logically, it‚Äôs just a time of year where the entity needs to release its juices
---
Tl;dr the blight event is the entity‚Äôs period
---
Behaviour Entertainment, BHVR for short
---
Looks like Steam has a lot of the DLC 40% off now wooo
---
Leaving your zone of comfort will make you grow stronger and overcome your past weaknesses. Staying within it, vice versa, leads to more weaknesses.
---
The event is going to happen one way or another why sit on my ass and cry about it? I‚Äôm not really understanding this, it‚Äôll happen when it happens and I‚Äôll enjoy it when it does.
---
With that Brand New Part change you really have outed yourself as a survivor main.
---
Gens are already too fucking fast, especially at Red Ranks, and you want to make it even quicker? Every fucking game there's at least one BNP and Syringe, that's bad enough but now you want to make Syringes REVERTED and BNP BUFFED?
---
Please do not call yourself a Killer main and suggest THAT bullshit.
---
&gt; Well it‚Äôs subjective isn‚Äôt it?
---
At the end of the day yes it is. I can‚Äôt disagree there. And in the end, people can do whatever they want, however they want. You can have fun BMg or doing controversial stuff and that can come at the expense of others fun. And you‚Äôre gonna get criticized for it. But hey it‚Äôs not rule breaking, and if you‚Äôre enjoying yourself then hell I cant really stop you even if I give you shit for it
---
The reason why DBD never got Jason is actually really easy to explain.
---
So Jason‚Äôs a big name- a VERY big name. DBD would‚Äôve had no chance at getting him around launch. It was only in the October when they released the Halloween Chapter- they had spent time pursuing the rights for Michael Myers and the Halloween characters. At this point in time, F13 the Game was already in very active development, and was clearly going to be a direct competitor to DBD- which, thanks to the Halloween Chapter putting it back into the spotlight after launch, was growing in player numbers.
---
So the license holders of F13 clearly weren‚Äôt gonna let BHVR have the rights to Jason because THEIR game was coming out soon- and when it did, it was DBD‚Äôs direct competitor... for about three months.
---
So F13 dies down really quickly, sure. But then the lawsuit kicks in. This not only halts any future content for F13 the Game (Uber Jason, etc), but future projects for the franchise in general. So now, the license holders couldn‚Äôt give BHVR the rights even if they wanted to.
---
And that leads us to today, where DBD has a whole list full of characters from external IPs, and almost every famous horror character- except perhaps the most iconic of all. Jason has now been left behind, and not just in DBD; there is a current resurgence in these classic horror franchises. Ash vs Evil Dead ran for three seasons, and not only is there a video game coming out but a whole new movie. Halloween just got a really good soft reboot, and the next one is being filmed right now (with the one after that being filmed directly after). Saw got a new instalment a couple of years ago, and now a soft reboot of the series is coming out in May. Chucky just got a new movie, as well as a TV series in early production. Even Freddy is heavily rumoured to be returning in a reboot soon. Every famous horror property is coming back except for Friday 13th.
---
Sad, really- but that‚Äôs what happens when the two franchise fathers get into a legal skirmish with one another.
---
We're did you get 15% from?
---
I don't think Scooby would be the killer here
---
The tradeoff for closing the hatch though is that appears no matter how many gens are left when there's one survivor and you can't grab a survivor mid-leap anymore. Not really fair if you ask me
---
I think it would be nice if Survivors did have something else to do. I like playing Survivor but here lately I just do it to get Head On Stuns and Inner Strength Heals. I usually at least do one generator maybe two then I go about getting the Killer's attention. I think they either need to have it where generators require fuel of sorts to be worked on, or maybe have a way of repairing the exit gates as well. Like before they get that last generator done they have to find two exit gate gears or something to get them to work upon finishing the last generator.
---
It's bullshit now because the old hatch was completely unbalanced bullshit for the survivors so I got and understood why killers were prone to slugging to prevent it.  Survivors were the power role with old hatch and could literally stand there and force you to hit them out.  Slugs back then seemed reasonable to me.
---
But now?  The EGC hatch is completely killer sided and you know it.  We move faster and can close it permanently...it's never been easier to secure a 4K as a killer than it is right now with the reworked hatch.  How often do survivors truly beat you to it in your killer games.  I close that dhit 4/5 killer games.  
---
Do gens.....or get the guy up....the gens would literally do nothing in that scenario you're just asking the survivor to feed themself to the killer to be a rank 20?  I don't even know why you'd bother mentioning that as final 2 with 1 slugged.  As per picking him up sure you can but we both know killers that slug in this scenario 9/10 maintain a patrol to keep an eye on the slugged body.  The moment they see you it's over.  Even if you pick them up they turn around and redown shortly or down you and now the bullshit continues with a fresh bleedout timer for you.  This continues until 9/10 they eventually have 1 slugged and the other in chase.  Stop pretending survivors typically recover from that scenario it's insanely disingenuous.
---
No you don't need to 4k to pip as killer.  Killers that struggle to pip usually play to defend hooks.  Play aggressively, pressure gens, swap targets more scoring events easy pip.  I can pip off a 3k through red unless I'm playing Plague or Trapper or someone that gets punished hard in the emblems for using their power.  At purple that playstyle can pip off a 2k.  It's babykillers that play to defend hooks that struggle to rank up.
---
I also saw this at Disney this weekend
---
Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm also a yellow jacket.
---
Gen rushing itself isn't a thing but there is a real problem with gen speed: a dedicated 4 man swf, even without toolboxes, can coordinate and all work on 3 different gens and finish them over the course of just 1 chase if the person is good at chases. If a killer has no map pressure, they're at the mercy of the map and the final gen placement to actually get a 4k. This is the reason why you always see people play ruin; you need ruin to not have games that last less than 7 minutes.
---
As an outlast lover, I'd throw all my money at this
---
gotta do what you gotta do i suppose
---
Stumbling upon it is luck by all means but so is getting a match where everyone knows wtf they're doing in solos. There should be NO hatch in SWF though.
---
Love the costume and the tats, you got more pictures of the tats?
---
I think you mean 2.51 million as that would be before knives being invented. 2.49 is after.
---
Awe but I want baldies basics as killer next üòßüò•üò•
---
instant down killer had a perk called NOED and it activates if all gens get done and there is at least 1 totem left and that lets the killer insta down, anyone, until it is destroyed
---
Uga booga.
---
I'm a super immersed gen jockey when I play survivor assuming the killer doesn't latch onto me like a fucking leech like they do 9/10 games.
---
Can't they transplant eyes nowadays? Wonder how your brain would deal with suddenly getting a color signal more. Get back to us on that one please once you got new eyes.
---
Should I buy 3 DLCs or wait for the sale in the game to buy only killers? Is it possible that it would be better? Are we even going to get the sale in the game?
---
You bring a generic, entitled argument of "Killers shouldn't be mean to survivors. :(" So I give you the generic response of "Suck it up, they are trying to win, too."
---
I don't find slugging lame. I find it perfectly acceptable for both sides, because that's the counterplay to rng hatch and exit gate spawns. Just run unbreakable if you hate slugging.
---
A video of otz himself not pipping on a 4k: https://youtu.be/kx_wgSMMepo 
---
Are you going to say he camped or tunnelled? Please do. I need a good laugh.
---
The mask was honestly one of those Chinese awful ones, so  I figured let's get crafty!
---
And if u see the hatch as such a waste if time then should it not be removed?
---
I didn‚Äôt say he was?
---
"we've done a pretty good job so far"
---
Why thank you! and I don't have any readily available alas! It's a mismatch of all sorts of average/poor/good trad and what not :D
---
He's a nazi apologist who believes the Holocaust never happened.
---
Trust me, so do I.
---
Personal experience in my killer games.  Let's round it up an additional 5% for you.  I successfully find and close the hatch 4 out of every 5 games. Ask yourself honestly how often does the 4th survivor tend to beat you to your hatches?
---
It really sucks because hooking survivors does not do anything, only hooking one survivor 3 times does. That means a killer can hook everyone twice and lose just because they didn't "tunnel" whoever has already been hooked. On the other hand slugging does more because they're guaranteed to be out of the game for a bit, they could have DS, and they can't be instantly saved like when they're on hook.
---
Maybe you should just take a break then, yeah. When the game becomes annoying to you, don‚Äôt force it, as it will only make your gameplay worse and lower your tolerance to certain things in game, which might cause you to become toxic. Have you tried switching to survivor?
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
I mean coldwind is his map
---
My guess? They linked r/dbdgonewild
---
They can still open the exit gates
---
Adrenaline is your high point at a critical moment of the match, one you struggled for for several minutes.
---
NOED is 'Here buddy, you tried your best, go fuck somebody up.'
---
I'm a killer main, don't @ me.
---
Amazing, i go to a engineering school and I probably wouldn't be able to do this, good job manüòÇüòÇüëçüëç
---
&gt;but its just shitty memes and reposts 90% of the time
---
*most of their memes are below 70 upvotes*
---
Hmmm
---
The amount of solo games I've been where I 99 a door while the killer is carrying someone and another survivor runs up and opens it just in time for Blood Warden is un-fucking-real. Dying Light gives you a second chance if you're bad at keeping pressure because hey the gens get slowed down if you just hook everyone but the obsession multiple times. The amount of solo games I've been in where I'm the only person doing totems is also unreal and rhe biggest reason I don't run solo anymore. I cannot tell you how many times I've clensed 4 totems, couldn't find the last one, and got fucked over by NOED only to find out the totem was right next to one of the gens another survivor popped.
---
Is there a double blood points event coming up?  I am very confused
---
Pretty sure the body would attack the foreign eyes unless he got immuneosuppressants, which isn't worth seeing a new color.
---
Ahh okay, thanks tho!
---
Yeah, just haven‚Äôt seen any map additions to the other pieces. I like the idea of it, wish it was in some of the other pieces now
---
you and me both buddy
---
Your video is amazing !
---
Of course it spawns regardless now.  You can close it permanently....you didnt actually expect to get the gen requirement AND that right?  Not only this but there is no stalemate anymore.  Tie goes to killer.  If both are spamming their buttons on top of hatch, killer animations wins out.  You can't honestly say you preferred the old hatch standoffs of yesterday right?  That was the stupidest aspect of the game and thoroughly unfun for both sides.
---
You played the game, didn‚Äôt really work for it.
---
I straight up hate hag and doctor with a burning passion. Hag because some genius decided to tie her counter play to an item so she can just trap the hook and you can't do anything about it and Doctor because **FUCKING TREATMENT MODE I'M ONLY GOOD AT HIDING YOU ASSHOLE**
---
I'm not tired of "tru3 bad" but I'm tired of "Otz good".
---
Venting always welcome here.
---
I‚Äôm sorry you had a shitty killer like that. Sometimes people are just... Well, shitty. At least that Steve seemed to be doing his best to get you alive and well again.
---
It‚Äôs never fun to go up against a killer who has tunnel vision on you. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have any advice for it, sometimes you just have to grin and bear it.
---
Slowing down gens by 2% isn't a second chance.
---
If that's your problem with noed, try to not do totems near uncompleted gens. That way, you are more likely to have NoED light a totem near you when your gen is finished.
---
What do you think The Doodle's ability will be? Erase parts of their bodies? Draw doodle obstacles that come to life?
---
You messed up, luv.
---
You can pip without slugging for the 4k, in fact your emblem points on reduced for slugging aren‚Äôt they?
---
Not permanent if the survivor has a key. And I think closing the hatch as a way to prevent standoffs is fine but removing grabbing screws you if you're in a chase and they find it and gives the survivor a chance to bully by making noise to show they found it
---
It was a 4 minute game.......it was too quick.  Not enough scoring events.  Understand how the emblem system works and then you'll understand why that isn't an argument.
---
Tru3‚Äôs been the butt of this SubReddit since the game launched shut up lol

---
I mean yeah you don‚Äôt work for devour hope. It‚Äôs not uncommon for all 5 gens to be done, getting a speed boost that ignores exhaustion, and fully restores a health state is as broken as NOED. Killers who can‚Äôt instadown are SOL
---
Some people on this sub take shit way too seriously. And some of them make alts *just* to take shit way too seriously.
---
The sad thing is I don't know which ones are bait anymore.
---
Samination on YouTube
---
I'm glad you in included the "illogical" part, a lot of times I see entitled survivors complaining about tunneling when it made total sense to go for them and hook them again because they got caught, it's really annoying.
---
i thought the trap would have downed me. the fact i was also m1'd blows my mind that i just got up
---
NOED is only op if the survivors refuse to look for the hex totem.
---
This is why I literally always spend time cleansing totems during the game.
---
Can‚Äôt use noed if the totem is already gone. Somehow people don‚Äôt think of this.
---
ULTIMATE POWER
---
Toxic
---
Hey there's no harm in being accurate. 
---
That's true about the previous one but it does not 9/10 times give you the win. As soon as the third survivor dies it becomes a rat race to find the hatch first and the survivor has that in their favor due to their camera and therefore field of view, and if you find the survivor first and chase them to the hatch you're screwed. 
---
I will say though it's always super satisfying to shut that thing.
---
"killer loses one perk slot" so he would have to face solo's (which, let me remind you, are usually very good on red ranks) with 4 meta builds without perks? That is not the same as taking away same perks from SWF.
---
In case of SWF that drawback serves to balance SWF's ability to use 3rd party comms, and since there is NO way to take away voice communication, something else needs to be taken. 
---
I assure you, my suggestion is the best outcome SWF could expect in terms of inevitable nerfs. It would add gameplay variety and force people to be more creative with their builds, as well as make killer's life against SWF less miserable. As a GhostFace main when I see 4 same characters/nicknames/tags I immediately dodge game, because I know that I will suffer no matter how this will end. What is that word, I forgot, oh yes, Frustrating. Playing against SWFs on any killer except Spirit or Nurse is frustrating. Since Nurse is already nerfed and Rin is next, I think it would be fair to do anything about SWFs. Taking Ebony Mori and Red addons just so you wouldn't get bullied isn't cool. 
---
Of course we can give killer some benefits for playing against SWF like bonus points or guaranteed black pip or extra movement speed etc so killers would have more chances, but it is not the way out for obvious reasons.
---
What rank at though?
---
Ahhhh I love when you can distract them so hard with a totem that they don't do gens! Satisfying. Rare, but satisfying :D
---
Mouse over the bar and you‚Äôll see their exact ping, if it stays below 125 you should be fine. 125 to 150 is a maybe and anything higher is a no-no. That‚Äôs how I determine it.
---

---
You unknowingly dodged a shitstorm the size of Nigeria by making this comment in advance.
---
r/antifastonetoss
---
I saw this vid. Tru3 is definitely someone with some good insight into the game. Watching him has definitely made me better at the game, for sure.
---
As far as his idea. It‚Äôs a maybe, but having to slug for the 4K sucks.
---
When I‚Äôm Killer, the last survivor finds hatch immediately. And when I slug, I can‚Äôt find the son of a bitch.
---
As a survivor, I never find the hatch. It sucks.
---
how tf are exhaust perks crutches? 
---
Clowns ability to slow people down allows him to just spam bottles, get close, then just direct hit a survivor and down them, Yea it might take a little more brain then clown players have available, but its not hard. I would be scared if you play huntress and cant hit a single hatchet. pigs is not great but its constant and lets her tunnel easily
---
How does one acquire the Daddy Myers title
---
Thanato is bad though, it barely slows anything down, on most actions it only makes the survivor take 1-4 extra seconds
---
The only time it really gets value is stacking with other perks like Dying Light and Sloppy.
---
What would her power be? We all know what Pinhead's would be and Pennywise has so many possibilities.
---
I'm gonna guess you didint watch the video because if u did you would know  his idea was to remove the hatch and replace it with a 1 min timer where the killer can see the aura of the survivor and the survivor has to loop the killer and then the gates open
---
Found the doctor in OPs vid.
---
Yeah for me if it goes into yellow I ain't dealing with it
---
So don‚Äôt chase anyone when 1 gens left and pray all the gens are next to each other? Ridiculous
---
you must sell your soul to reddit by performing a blood ritual while wearing a daddy myers mask
---
Well... He has been running and shooting very fast infected for a long time so no wonder he can run fast
---
What about The Curious from creeped out (netflix original series) idk what there weapon would be doh
---
also wanted to say there is no 2 they skipped it as a sort of satire of the endless sequels.
---
No when I said 9/10 time it gives you the win I was referring to when you close the hatch.  9 out of 10 times you will successfully catch that final survivor at an exit gate handle.  That 1/10 they escape is a huge map with opposite exit gate spawns.
---
Mad Grit *Exists*
---
and he can still close the hatch after she's hooked anyway :D
---
I use bond just to see where everyone else is, cause I hate being alone in that game. I need meat shields
---
Dwight looks like he ate 20 lemonades but it's stil a great drawing.
---
Why tho?
---
Survivors that call spoopy myers op should be locked away from society
---
Im not saying i should get a 4k every time there is only one person left, but what i am saying is that that last survivor escaping or being hooked being based on luck is not a healthy thing for the game.
---
There's a really really good reason that he was and I don't blame him. He went two games in a row against BMing survivors with pink keys and insta heals. He's not the sweet innocent angel that everyone makes him out to be but let's also not pretend most players don't get extremely fed up with other players in this game sometimes.
---
Who would be the killer?
---
My only issue when it's a 1v1, is that the exit doors are sometimes way too close to one another, so there's no point to even try anything. Other than that, I think it makes sense that the killer has the advantage. Still better than how it was before EGC. 
---
I used to play IDV, I love the atmosphere and the ideas behind the game, but it's basically over whenever the killer puts you into a chair because the only viable strategy is to facecamp.
---
I think the purpose of the add-ons rework is to make her unable to abuse other survivors more than she already does. More than 2 blinks was just bad at every level. That being said, I don't think they're ever gonna rework her unique ability to ignore literally every tool survivors have to fight killers, so, the only thing they can do is making sure she cannot be worse.
---
If she is your mom she might get it.
---
I think Chris Walker would be the perfect fit.
---
His power could be charging through walls and pallets kinda like how he walk through doors and he would have a passive power that makes it so survivors Cannot wiggle oit of his grip because he's shown to be strong enough to pick a person up and rip heads off as well.
---
Might be interesting if the Main killer was Jack but he could switch to other spirits from the movie that each had their own strengths and weaknesses depending on the situation.  That smug rich guy or that BDSM bunny mask guy for example. Maybe even the naked old woman or Lloyd. 
---
Survivor could be the horse faced mom.
---
Ah I see. You got me there

Mathematically it only makes survivors take 3.2 more seconds to do a generator PER PERSON HIT, and it's very rare that you ever get more than 2 people hurt

For me, and this is on console where its literally built into XBOX live, if i see 3 or 4 survs join lobby at the same moment it's pretty much guaranteed they're SWF. So, depending on my rank/mood ill just back out and re-queue.
---
Have Pennywise or Jason Voorhees been considered as killers for the game?
---
spooky myers&gt;spirit
---
Hmmm will keep that perspective in mind. Thank you.
---
No you should have multiple kills by the time it gets to 1 gen IF it even gets to 1 gen.  The majority of my killer wins end with gens up.  I play a lot of gen pressure loadouts.  Freddy is amazing for this in particular.  The killers that are in amazement that games can be ended with gens still up to repair need to take a look at how their games are playing out.
---
Yeeeeeeeah, I'm not great at faces
---
Don‚Äôt forget the part where you do it in your underwear.
---
There‚Äôs really nothing you can do except play exceptionally well
---
Like there‚Äôs no definitive counter other than playing better than them
---
"its ur connection lmAO"
---
Why the hell did I think that when they said fuck stone toss they were talking bout diversion.
---
Even then all those perks go out the window if shes using stridor and you get injured
---
this offends me
---
Two survivors I have are prestige 3, about 11 killers prestige 3. I don't lie, regardless of my opinions. No need to get mad, dude. Just an idea :P
---
Syringes aren't reverted, either. Please don't exaggerate.
---
Also... 'outed'? is it a sin to be a survivor main?
---
ofc. forgot to mention that
---
If it‚Äôs who I think it is, and they‚Äôre commenting what I think they‚Äôre commenting... then they have a very unhealthy obsession with *that* sub.
---
I mean that's kind of every perk in the game. That's why they're part of builds. No one perk should make or break the game. It's how you pair them up that makes the difference.
---
If anything we need Xenomorph and Ridley. It sucks that Demigorgan is sightly similar to Xeno but alien is such a classic horror move to just ignore!
---
In advanced terms, learn how to end chases faster and keep pressure on everyone so you don‚Äôt spend all match chasing the good runner as the gens pass you by
---
Hey guys I know this may be a little bit off topic but I was thinking that gen speeds should be much slower thanks and killers should be granted one hit downs once they reach bloodlust 3 thanks guys also remove adrenaline thanks
---
The only issue would be carrying survivors XD
---
Thank you, I was in a lobby with friends :)
---
I had second wind and honestly didn‚Äôt want to go down first - I instinctively ran to the pallet for that satisfying stun
---
I couldn't handle seeing Scooby and the gang getting hooked, I can barely handled it when someone kills me when I am playing Ash
---
You could sniff my bum
---
I did watch the video the other day.  You didn't specify that you were referring to his concept.  You simply asked me if I wanted them to get rid of the hatch.
---
Now that you've specified you intended to ask me about Trues plan I appreciate the idea behind the concept and why he thinks it would be better but it still has some big balance issues where I feel the current EGC hatch is more fair.
---
Biggest issue for me is how would a Billy lose ever under his proposed plan?  At some point if you're forced to be engaged in a chase with the killer and make the open exit gate you'll get t po the point where you have to abandon any defense and expose yourself wide open to make the gate.  What competent Billy isn't going to destroy you in that situation?
---
i lol‚Äôd
---
You just gave me an idea
---
New horror movie comes out
---
DBD subreddit : NEW KILLER?!
---
Voice chat has huge disadvantages actually, You can easily break off of chases in a way that would lead that person to assume she/he's being chased to find another person on a nearby gen due to said chase, From there it'll create traffic such as "I thought he was chasing you?, He was! Etc etc" Walking towards one place then breaking off for another, Whispers is a very useful perk since if you're being called out a little "Too well" they'll leave its range before you even search allowing you to pursue them immediately instead of wasting time. Additionally you can usually get a hook and from there chase the first person you see (Usually the bait), But by doing that only 1 person would be on a gen as they unhook/Heal. Then repeat,  However- If you get a slippery survivor that you can't seem to hit I would just ignore them. While dodging is possible it's easily countered by being ready for a potentially dodge, If you still struggle to land a hit it's a connection thing you'll have to cope with for that game.
---
As a ghost face main getting maps like Leary‚Äôs and HNL makes you a god. No need to stalk on those maps as most gens are right around a corner. If you think gen grabbing as spirit is satisfying you will love doing it with ghost face.
---
is that a spark plug in the middle?
---
Trying to pick my favorite of yours, it's between the huntress and the wraith, great work man, keep it up
---
Here comes the traper...
---
Yeah, this is what many Dwights do in game. That's why I have no mercy policy towards them.
---
Letting the feng min escape when shes last survivor üíã
---
I really appreciate it! Seeing your work was enough to get me to replay all of Cuphead!
---
I‚Äôm not saying to decrease fov I‚Äôm saying to literally decrease the range that she can see so everything from a distance is all black and she can‚Äôt see
---
What! That‚Äôs so cool! You really scared me because i was looking at that weird glitch
---
Racist, sexist, Nazi sympathizer, holocaust denier, altright.
---
I mean I don't think I need to add more labels but I really can.
---
He still gets posted, so apparently we *do* have to say it.
---
He did a stream of it once, he had never touched it before and didn't really know the mechanics and chose Myers, it was pretty funny to watch him try his best without having a clue of what was going on
---
This should not matter. If you dc because you dont like how the other side plays, you are a bitch.
---
Well they would censor tragers ass
---
Eeeeeexcellent! &lt;3 Happy Halloween
---
I cant tell if the sub loves him or hates him. He gets memed into oblivion it seems like an even split
---
They shouldnt be banned but they should be punished.
---
My guess is Nurse or Spirit with a Mori and all of the hexes
---
I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt it would force spirit players to use their ability more wisely because you wouldn‚Äôt be able to see scratch marks from very far away and scratch marks juking her would be a little easier because she would kind of have to stay on your trail.
---
So if you don‚Äôt have multiple kills, screw you then right? Your logic is flawed.
---
Blackbeard plays Dead by Daylight [2019]- Colourised
---
For the meeeeme
---
I feel like it's fairly apparently where the inspiration came from.
---
Wow u inspired me to have some last minute escape games on rank reset day. Ima let them all survive
---
He aint good but damn is he fun.
---
Why are you booing him, he's right.
---
Then why are killers not looked down upon for dc'ing?
---
Because they're not directly based off the movies
---
yeah but nobody would play pennywise cuz he isn‚Äôt   t h i c c
---
Just want to add to your comment.
---
A good number of top streamers will slug instead of hook, and there's a very good reason for that. Hooking takes the killer a lot of time, and unhooking takes the survivor very little. Slugging takes no time for the killer, and can take a survivor out of the play for a while, and possibly a second to heal them. It also allows the killer to immediately put pressure on someone else.
---
If one person is hooked, one slugged, and one being chased, the last remaining person isn't likely to be doing gens. If one is slugged and another being chased, you probably only have one person working on gens.
---
The only problem with slugging is that you can't take advantage of any perks that require you to get a hook first (BBQ, Pop, etc.), so a balance between slugging and hooking is important. Hooks kill people, so learn when to hook or when to slug and try to snowball a win.
---
&gt; Cool, you're breaking the EULA and you shouldn't playing if you can't take a lost 
---
Who says its about loosing? I would say I had an escpae rate of above 50% against spirit before I started to DC. I am DCing coz its no fun not because its hard to win, why would I play againts nurses then? 
---
But its all stated in my original post, dont know what you read.
---
&gt; Nice story you tell to yourself to not improve or change game 
---
Ok play versus me when I am spirit and show me the counter plays.
---
Spirit bad, DC Good.
---
*laughs in April 2019 MoM*
---
Wowwwwwwwww Mettle of Man.
---
i don't know why so many people on this sub hate rubberbanding mechanics. do they really enjoy stomps that much? like sure adrenaline is occasionally going to result in a sick comeback but more often than not if you trigger adrenaline you're already winning and it just erases any hopes the killer had of securing some final pressure before the end of the game
---
noed on the other hand gives the killer a chance to catch up after getting mostly defeated. noed is literally better game design than adrenaline because stomps are *not* fun. why is it that being bad is not a good enough reason to get this last minute power spike? why are crutches somehow this terrible thing everyone claims they are? there's nothing wrong with being bad at the game. 
---
i study video game design, don't @ me
---
They should be.
---
If a killer dcs because survivors are playing well they are a bitch.
---
Watch otzdarva, he‚Äôs probably one of the best trappers out there.
---
If 95% of survivors told everyone to kill themselves then there would be no more survivors left in the game since telling people kill themselves **is** a bannable offense if you report.
---
You've started this comment off with so many ridiculous stretches of the imagination, I don't even know where to begin...
---
So my idea was for the Scooby gang instead of getting noticed then run off screen and the killer looks confused
---
Don't play online games
---
I'm new. What is NOED?
---
Yeah I think it makes sense lore wise as well but not realistically like she is a spirit you don‚Äôt see me colliding with spirits whenever I walk somewhere.
---
Facecamping?
---
Is that Steve in the background?
---
Seriously?!! I am only playing at rank 10. And I hardly have to chase anyone lol. Maybe its the maps i‚Äôm getting?
---
It could be an unintended feature by the devs. You never know with the spaghetti code of DBD.
---
Lol. I like to be an A Hole sometimes
---
I gotta disagree with the insta down thing. Most if not all feel fair to me? Can you elaborate?
---
Its really completely random what they could mean, it depends on the context I guess. Most of the "signs" are just dumb memes you can ignore but Ill explain a few
---
Pointing in general: Likely they see the killer, take a look around and see if thats what they mean. If not, theyre probably telling you to go that way or are memeing
---
Pointing after missing a skillcheck: "you suck/youre disowned" (meme)
---
Pointing at an objective either before they run off or if you both spot it at once: "Do that gen/totem/unhook while I do something else"
---
Nodding: "Yeah keep doing that" (meme)
---
Thanks! My recording is so lame but at least I got it saved
---
Doesn‚Äôt everybody :)
---
Well why did people downvote then? I‚Äôm seeing it from their perspective
---
Wouldn't camping and tunneling qualify as a "casual killer"?
---
Sounded like Homer Simpson lmao
---
Is this bait? lol
---
"Unforseen Circumstances" is the new "Pretty good job so far"
---
No, it isn't. BT applies Deep Wounds to a hit that would put you into the dying state. That is simply what is happening here. The Trapper could pick him up out of the trap to bypass BT, but then that procs DS. 
---
This is literally the perk doing what it describes
---
Where is my boy Wraith?
---
I‚Äôm seeing the Alien, the shark from Jaws, Trapper, Other Trapper, Creeper, and lots of familiar ~~faces~~ masks
---
Finaly some good fan content. Damn good.
---
More importantly why do people use emojis with 2012 memes in 2019
---
Then show me...
---
Who is sayimg I am proud? Do you even read? Stop seeing things no one ever said...
---
Idk, just spreading awareness of who Stonetoss is gets people in this sub pissed off. They‚Äôre gonna downvote because sometimes people want to be dicks. There isn‚Äôt anything wrong with what you said
---
Jason has his own game (although failing) and has major licensing issues, so he's likely a no.
---
Pennywise, DbD twitter started following Stephen King I believe, so it could be possible, but I personally would prefer something else of his
---
I think some people could think that hand grabs another thingy.
---
The spirit is already the unlicensed ripoff of the grudge girl
---
He's just cloaked
---
I never get tired of your work. Keep it up!
---
P sure my daily says otherwise
---
So this comment is getting downvotes for not agreeing with using a literal nazi propagandist as a meme template? Seems like a valid complaint
---
Could I get this picture without the words, i need this as my wallpaper
---
I legit said I agreed with OP and he didn‚Äôt do anything wrong lol. Way to get pissed off for no reason.
---
Yeah, when is this game going to be accessible?
---
I like how Pennywise, Pinhead, Pepsiman and the shark from jaws appeared and without question
---
Thanks. I wouldn't mind the DC's so much if I at least safety pipped and kept my items. I feel bad for the one they left behind too. I'm honestly close to just quitting the game for good.
---
never understood all the hate against ruin. when I was newer I'd just take some time to find the totem, and now that I'm better at the game I just power through it. never felt like it was that much of a hindrance
---
Pretty much yeah. Funny thing is top rated comment says the same exact thing and has 50 likes, fuck me I guess though ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Is there a secret to finding the hatch when you‚Äôre the last survivor?
---
4k shouldnt be an objective with 4-5 gens left.
---
Plague OP, please nerf
---
SO I could use it on bloodhunt.
---
Well, first of all, the most important part of GF is gameplay, not perks.
---
Probably you are playing him the most obvious way, stalking people. It can work on low rank, but in higher rank it becomes frustrating and really hard. Almost impossible or at least no time efficient.
---
Check out true talent videos because he is one of the few how actually understand GF. The real way of playing is just like a tier 1 Mayers without wallhacks but with normal speed and crouching.
---
Just spreed pressure hitting everyone with M1, keep them injured and try to grab them from gens.
---
Said that, the build I recommend you with your perks is:
---
Sloppy butcher
---
Thrilling tremors
---
Whispers 
---
 And then choose between:
---
Bitter murmurs
---
Im all ears
---
NOED
---
I mean, if he is tunneling and camping a single person, why not punish him for camping? I am not a killer main, but when I have been camped I have just let my friends work on gens, get to end game collapse and then try to save me.
---
Without any teachables go with thrilling tremors, sloppy butcher, whispers and noed (or enduring)
---
With teachables go spirit fury enduring, bbq and ruin
---
I main David and Claudette so I don't get this. What's wrong with urban?
---
I did watch the video. That isn't gonna stop me from making a silly meme. I made the meme cuz the title is clickbaity.
---
Traps don't down survivors unless the Trapper has an Honing Stone
---
The Drowned
---
My friends have been forcing me to play bill
---
Watch out for the grid there neighborino
---
unfortunately the % of slowdown is a bit low. 16% is the highest it gets and at that point it's just starting to be worth it, but most games you'll only get like 4-8% on average
---
that being said it does have good synergy with other anti-healing perks such as sloppy butcher and nurse's calling, as well as killers that are good at finding survivors but not so good at chasing, like wraith and doctor
---
It's literally the same kind of japanese ghost. It's called an [Onryo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onry%C5%8D)
---
It doesn‚Äôt look like that at all but ok lol
---
like one of those youtube mousetrap pranks
---
He just pees on people?
---
I ran ruin, corrupt intervention, bbq and bloodwarden
---
When your both going somewhere or doing something (like working on a generator), and your injured if they walk over to you and tea-bag they probably want you to stop so they can heal you, or if they are injured want you to stop and heal them.
---
Also whoops reddit flipped the image
---
looks like a bloomin tarot card
---
i love it!
---
They did a crossover with L4D cosmetics. I'd settle for Scooby themed survivors. Feng/Claudette as Velma Dinkley.
---
I agree but survivors do it more often though.
---
Do it right and you get two stacks for one farm. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Trapper is a fun killer but he aint no god tier
---
Come back to me when you experience a rank 1 object of obsession swf and then we will talk
---
depending on your rank, a haddonfield offering can literally mean you're not gonna get a single kill that game. it's definitely more understandable when a killer DCs from a haddonfield offering (less so if the game just randomly selected haddonfield without an offering) than when ruin is taken out
---
I‚Äôm surprisingly okay with this.
---
I agree with you, sometimes i try to chase the survivors and then stalk them on the edge of a wall to stalk them faster. And thanks for your suggestion.
---
Got some bad news for you.
---
The leaks DID state that the new cosmetic releases would start on the 30th of October with the Halloween Collection (Myers and Laurie), and Ghostface would be out November 13th- however, considering the mid-chapter has been delayed, it‚Äôs fairly likely the cosmetic releases will be also. Unless BHVR come out with a small patch on Wednesday that adds in all the upcoming outfits, and put Michael/Laurie out immediately when the patch it out, Ghostface will not get his outfit until five weeks after the Mid-Chapter releases.
---
I know, it‚Äôs quite the wait.
---
Hah
---
DM‚Äôd it to ya
---
1. Listen for the wind tunnel-like noise it makes
---
2. Generally, walk around the perimeter of the map first and then work your way in
---
3. It's not supposed to spawn above the basement, so you can rule that out most of the time, however it glitches and does it anyways every so often
---
4. Check the killer shack ASAP, it spawns there pretty often if the basement isnt there from my experience
---
5. On The Game map, find it by listening for it on the top floor. It can only be on the bottom floor, but theres a lot less navigation to do on the top
---
6. On Badham Preschool, you can count on it spawning on the boiler room floor in that little tiny room to the left of the stairs, its not guaranteed but it spawns there A LOT
---
Queue times for killer are often twice to three times as long compared to survivor (as there is less killers per game), so get in queue and do something else. It should never more than 4 minutes no matter what time it is.
---
Also cool for being an otz fan - his plague game today was nutz
---
I hate this, had this exact situation happen to me yesterday. Downed one left him because the other one was nearby trying to be altruistic, downed that one and they DCd, next thing I know game's over and the other got the hatch.
---
There really should be a penalty of some kind enacted. I understand sometimes on rare occasions someone will DC due to bad connection, but most of the time it's just salt.
---
he's a pedo
---
He's called The Crapper.
---
that makes a lot more sense now. trapper hitting me freed me and activated the borrowed time hit. didnt think of it like that
---
Just saying, you might want to spoiler tag that.
---
How is it clickbait?
---
No one escapes death. Instant down if het when all generators are powered and if there is a dull totem left. OP cleansed the Noed just as it activated.
---
What in the fuck?
---
Yep, precisely.
---
Epic
---
He was stalking you through the window while you made this. He knows all.
---
I only dc when the killer tunnels me and I get hooked all 3 times in like 1 min
---
Thana is good if paired with dying light but on its own it‚Äôs not worth running.
---
That's a really good suggestion
---
As someone who has problems with both of their wrists, using struggle and wiggle scripts is so much better on the hands. AutoHotKey is a pretty darn nice macro software and I have a script for both, dont know if im allowed to post it to this sub though.
---
where is this from?

Join a youtuber discord of dbd - this is pretty much what happens in every official game discords

Yeah but like, noed bad.

---
im suggesting that the game actually be fun because with the way killers have been playing it lately its straight up not fun
---
I also tunnel OoO users, ESPECIALLY if I'm a stealth killer. OoO itself isn't toxic but when I see them teabagging across the map it's tunnel time.
---
OoO completely negates stealth killers so I often need them dead ASAP. They're like the reconnaissance guy in a squad, you need them out of the picture ASAP so you have a better chance against the other 3. 
---
I remember when someone got butthurt at me since I tunneled and mori'd them for the Old Dying Light and they were running OoO and I was Myers. I get it, the OG "Kill the obssession ASAP" Dying Light was unfun as fuck for the obsession but when you're ALSO running OoO in SWF against a Myers with M&amp;A (I wasn't running scratched mirror) the "I gotta kill this guy as fast as humanly possible" factor is even higher. 
---
Either way I don't see anything wrong with tunneling an OoO user. In a SWF they can be relaying your position to the other players and you're at a severe disadvantage because of it. 
---
On a side note, Blindness is an extremely underrated status effect. You see OoO pretty rarely but Blindness can really mess them up. Not saying you should bring Hex: The Third Seal every game (It'll get cleansed in 5 seconds anyway) but if you're playing a killer who's not very addon dependent like Freddy, the blindness addons can be a decent pick just in case you get an OoO user.

He's the leader so he's talking at the other side of the room.

Bhvr released them early to buy with auric cells, if you want them for free, you'll have to wait for the event
---
i play both sides. i know how survivor and killer is. i know theres issues on the killer side and issues on the survivor side. again, im suggesting a way that the game be made fun because spending 90% of the game on the ground isn't fun
---
Ah. Gotcha.
---
Ah yes, like Cujo
---
You didn't know about the new Nurse x Survivor crossover?
---
i get that. im not saying it's not a viable tactic but slugging for the 4k is still annoying
---
Oh shit oh fuck Feng I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôll put it away I swear
---
Joe
---
I'm going to start by saying I'm definitely not a top tier killer, so keep that in mind when you read my response. A lot of what I'm going to say is from observation from watching killers who are far better than me.
---
The survivor's objective is to survive, and the easiest way to do that is to complete generators. That makes your objective to keep pressure on the generators. There are 7 gens per map, but if there's one gen way off in the corner, you may want to make an early call to let that one go. It'll cut your workload down, and possibly even give you a 3-gen strat for end game.
---
I'd recommend running a perk like Discordance or Surveillance. These perks tell you when people are working on generators. If you're running Discordance, and you get a notification, all of a sudden you can pressure at least two people and one generator. You walk over, and two people run away. All of a sudden, half the team is doing nothing productive. Kick the gen or chase someone.
---
When you enter in to chase, don't chase them for long if you're not going to get a hit or a down. I give myself about 20 seconds. If I can't get anything during that time, it's time to go after someone else, because 20 seconds is 1/4th of a generator. If no one is hooked or injured, that's a lot of progress the team could be making.
---
Even getting a hit on someone and them cycling to someone else is helpful. People hate playing injured, and especially if they're SWF, they're going to find a teammate to heal. That takes two people off a gen. If you're running Sloppy Butcher, that adds 8 seconds to the heal time. (I'm not encouraging using Sloppy Butcher all the time, but it can be annoying against teams who like to heal)
---
If you're chasing someone and they run to an area where there are no gens or the gens have been completed, drop that chase immediately. They're purposely running you away from their friends.
---
Sometimes it's frowned upon, but slugging someone is a great way to apply pressure. I responded to someone else's comment in this topic about slugging, so I won't repeat myself, but learn when to slug someone.
---
Pressure someone or a gen and then rotate. Repeat that cycle as much as you can. The longer the game lasts, the more it is in your favour. You don't have to kill them quickly, you can wear them down bit by bit if you need to. If it's clearly a SWF and you need to eliminate one of them from the game early, then do it. Not saying you have to tunnel or camp them, but if someone is getting in your face a lot or causing you headaches, then play strategically. Yeah, people might get pissed, but it's just a game and you can't fault someone for wanting to win.
---
Good luck in the fog!

Game map? I think I‚Äôve been missing something big...
---
Adrenaline is Bad for Killers. But the only counter play to Adrenaline is to not allow 5 gens to be repairs. The counter play to Noed is cleaning 5 totems. I feel if Noed needs a rework, so does Adrenaline
---
Completely forgot about that! Next time I‚Äôll use it better. üòÇüòÇ
---
Killer spawns in as one of the survivors, befriends them, hits ability button to transform into a werewolf and murder them all.
---
Another joke would be what is feels like when the survivor has balanced landing when your playing billy.
---
Ok thank u
---
Trager and The Clown will either be great friends or great rivals for their particular interest in fingers.
---
Except, no I didn't. I explained the context for the conversation and how it does not match with what you thought/meant. So no, at no point did I tell you what you thought. 
---
The only one putting words on other people's mouths is you, either that or you're that stupid, or more likely, its both.
---
Why only for 2?
---
People hate rubberbanding because it feels pretty shitty to be on the other side of it. Look at how people reacted to jungle gold and xp rubberbanding in LoL for an example. Getting punished because you are doing well isn't rewarding.
---
 Going down and dying to Noed after dominating the match by just playing better than the other guy feels cheap.
---
The survivor took a gamble by taking Adrenaline, the risk paid off and they had to work for it too. The killer benefits from Noed without even having to run it (people wasting time clensing totems). It feels like getting handholded and the perk doesn't require an actual effort from you for how impactful it can be in a lot of situations.
---
How do you guys counter Object of Obsession?
---
It doesnt matter though lol. Its not multiplicative
---
GRANDPA-RKOUR
---
Devs will only give us enough serum for 2 full sets
---
You reckon hunters iridescent hatchets should only work for headshots? Increased skill cap, rewarding, and gives more chances to counter, if a survivor ducks they lose speed to penalise them. + stops people dcing instatnyl lol.
---
Theres any ghost face skin wich have some advantage over the others in therms of sneakyness?
---
"The Game" is the map from the Saw Chapter with two floors and the doors that open when you finish the gens, its not an item/HUD element, sorry to confuse lol
---
lol you sound so excited you cant even words anymore at the end
---
what
---
Down someone and then pretend to run away only to come back to get the other person trying to help them up. Use downed survivors as bait. Only hook survivors after at least two people are injured so it becomes riskier for them to go for the save.
---
And even then Left Behind is still a bad perk.
---
Sure you get to see where Hatch is but at that point 3 Survivors are dead and you get an advantage for a hollow victory.
---

Didn't Otz say right after this he was fine with eating the DS, and he recognizes he shouldn't have picked up that person
---
&gt; On The Game map, find it by listening for it on the top floor. It can only be on the bottom floor, but theres a lot less navigation to do on the top
---
huh.. I've never actually thought about this. How well can you hear it from the top floor?
---
Well see here‚Äôs the problem they say they are going to fix bugs, but then 7 more appear worse then the last and delaying an event for a week and half that is purely cosmetic and doesn‚Äôt add much new is inexcusable and laughable. Edit: Nice alt my guy
---
But if we die in the game, do we die for real?
---
The myers one seems a little basic but honestly i love them all soooooooo much!
---
Mate the evidence is right there for everyone to see i don't know if you're schizo or just plain stupid..
---
Well no. After all the entity controls all this so. Death is not an escape ü§ó
---
yeah but i figured why not try idk, mettle of man was good but they nerfed it into the ground and on top of that left it broken so it doesnt register the protection hits properly
---
So we're throwing "separate the art from the artist" out the window now?

Enduring is a teachable tho lol
---
in hindsight I shouldve put the quote marks around it lol.
---
BUT you can use the map item in the game to find the hatch too, I think you have to use the Black Silk Cord add on for it to appear. Also the Bill teachable "Left Behind" shows you the aura of the hatch when youre the last survivor from up to 32 meters away
---
Love crypt tv, could really recommend "look-see"

I have a question to all Michael mains, have you done the burger King myres challenge?

Theres very little difference in volume compared to if you were on the same floor as it, it might be like less than 5% softer if even

---
After having mettle of man used against me two games in a row I realized I don't want it in the game. 
---
I legitimately had to hit a survivor 5 TIMES in a row, consecutively, before he went down.
---
I think they should remove it from the game.
---
Any sort of an indicator that you aren't just wasting your time worrying about Noed would be appreciated, yeah.
---
I had an idea sometime ago to also show that a medkit has an instaheal, etc. Clarity goes a long way when you're dealing with powerful effects.
---
He should've just taken the loss!, We all have shit games, Just take your BP and leave dude, you already wasted the entire match so why dc at the end I dont get it
---
I thought they weren‚Äôt doing an event this year so i am happy we‚Äôre getting one no matter the date
---
**I‚Äôll TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK**
---
Hey, should I do add-ons sometime and change the Ability? Ability may not work since other commenters and the Devs said no shapeshifting.
---
&gt; I'm not scared of you
---
what a weird thing to say lmao
---
Yeah probably,it‚Äôs one of my favourite solo horror films so I‚Äôd like to see him get added,maybe with the release of terrifier 2 next year but idk
---
I too would like corn tattood on my back
---
&gt; Mate the evidence is right there for everyone to see
---
I know. There's clear evidence of you never mentioning bugs nor toxicity prior to my comment, but you kept acting like that's what you said.
---
You can quote my comments if you want.
---
The second survivor if it will have one will be Patrick Star, and when he loads in or gets morried he will scream "WHAT KIND OF PLACE IS THIS!?"
---
I know everyone on the Reddit praises him so much but he is genuinely really fun and entertaining to watch
---
To be fair, survivors keep using keys and meta perks because killers keep acting like this.
---
I'm shocked you would put wraith and huntress so low. Permanent insta down with huntress seems top tier to me, and the ambush potential on wraith along with the anti-mind games he has make him feel very good to me.  
---
Spirit is totally one of the best though, mother daughter ring is just gross with prayer beads. Insane mind game potential, insane chase and insane map coverage.
---
Yeah thata rly shitty happened to me as well but 3 DCs and 1 hatch... one pip from red rank
---
Yeah he streamed it with Chelsea for about 50 minutes and had no idea what the hell was happening haha, and I don‚Äôt blame him, DBD isn‚Äôt just a pick up and play game. I definitely think he would be cool with BHVR using him as a survivor, considering James is kind of a modern day horror host!

Nearly EVERY game has this issue. Fixing bugs leads to adding more code that could also have bugs, or patching holes in code that leads to bugs somewhere else. Dead by daylight is no exception. Being impatient with the devs for trying to fix a game that the ONLY feedback they get is that ‚Äúit‚Äôs a buggy, unbalanced mess‚Äù is ignorant and entitled. This entire Sub is plagued with it too...
---
Yeah, I'm subbed to his YT already.
---
Toes üò≥
---
Otz will eat the DS because he knows how to recuperate when it happens almost immediately all he has to say is ‚ÄúKiss your DS goodbye‚Äù and poof there goes a perk slot. And don‚Äôt shit on the man he‚Äôs a wholesome boi who deserves love because he‚Äôs not toxic and promotes good gameplay.
---
Yeah you should change the ability but add ons would be Amazing
---
It's not even that their concepts are bad. I *love* the idea of a killer that can strategically litter the map with traps, but he takes awhile to find them, set them, and he can only carry one by default... Trapper is a relic. Bingbong is similarly underwhelming because he's instantly observable at basically any distance if you've got a sightline on him. His power might as well just read: Harder to spot, press and hold M2 to charge a speed boost. 
---
I've never even tried Spirit or Nurse, but I'm guessing they're a totally different experience upward from what I usually play.
---

&gt; DS doesn't do shit if you don't tunnel
---
I have a lot of issues with your comment but I only really care to address this one, because it is total horseshit. DS is active for an entire minute. It is very easy to down someone within that time without tunneling them.
---
I think this is fine because DS imo is not just an anti-tunnel perk, but multi-faceted in its uses, but saying "lol just don't tunnel" is fucking brain dead
---
WAZZZZZZUP
---
People think of it, they just don't care about it, and rather complain. This completely counterable perk that I don't want to look for is completely broken and rewards killers for doing bad. It's better phrased that way rather than it punishes survivors for not cleansing a skillcheck free, 14 second totem 5 times that can lead to an extra 5,000 points and no NOED
---
What are your other issues with my comment? I'd really like to know because pretty much everything I've stated is a fact.
---
I feel attacked
---
Unfortunately that‚Äôs just the way things are right now. I‚Äôd rather spend a few minutes doing a gen boringly though, then the gens be done in minutes, and then back into the next queue.
---
I‚Äôm trying to come up with ways to slow down the game that would be unique, or fun, but honestly I‚Äôm drawing a blank.
---
DS is whatever tbh :/
---
Oh my god that killer would be trash. I understand that youre just brainstorming but nurse runs slower than survivors. The punishment of the entire map hearing his terror radius isnt even really a punishment because good survivors will just immediately realize who they're against and not even be worried about the terror radius going in and out. Even scratched mirror myers runs 5% faster than survivors.
---
It really is, that other survivor is just being salty
---
thank you. thats all we ask :)

Eyes are separate from the immune system and basically have their own. If your eyes were ‚Äúregistering‚Äù with the immune system, they‚Äôd be getting attacked right now.

Huntress with Iridescent Head and Infantry can be very strong, but she still gets f*cked by maps too much. You can still infinite loop her around certain buildings ( Haddonfield, Disturbed Ward, Groaning Storehouse, Wretched Shop, Grim Pantry ) even with Iri Head and I saw some decent Huntresses losing with Iri Head and Ebony Mori against solo survivor teams on maps like Thompson House or Rotten Fields. 
---
Wraith even with his best add-ons still gets looped too hard to put him any higher.

Congratulations for not being good enough to kill the survivors before all gens are done. Imo poor gen management. Survivors have every right to have that perk as a REWARD for finishing gens. It‚Äôs nothing game breaking. NoED is much cheaper as it‚Äôs just a last resort for killers that got outplayed.
---
The Plague one is fantastic, seems very inspired!

He said he has enduring you illiterate.
---
I feel like this is a fair balance imo. However many totems remain is how many times it is in effect. Sounds perfect to me.
---
You could go Sloppy Butcher to slow down healing, I'm All Ears for 6 seconds wallhack, Spies from the Shadows which is better than Whispers for detection and Pop Goes the Weasel for pressuring generators. The last one, Pop, is available in the shrine of Secrets right now for 2000 iridescent shards.
---
Being inept isn't equal to actively sabotaging your team's chance at escape.
---
Right but its hard to pull off
---
Are they rank 20 babies? I'd give them a friendly message letting them know what is expected, this game can be really scary for new players so I give 'em a break. 
---
If they have even half a dozen games under their belt they should know better and you did nothing wrong.
---
I play both sides and have gotten to rank 1 on both sides consistently. When I play survivor, I always expect NOED. Not only is it a decent amount of points, but it is satisfying to cleanse all the totems and find out there was NOED in the end and it never got to spawn. And totems are not that hard to find. there's always 5 and they'll spawn in a circular-like fashion. If you haven't played enough and don't know where they spawn and Hex: NOED has popped up, don't risk it. Leave. There is no reason to hand a killer more kills like that. Too many people stop playing cautiously once all the gens are powered. The game isn't over yet, you still have to escape.
---
lmao did you get this from my comment on the other post from earlier.......
---
Thanks for the suggestion, i will buy Pop Goes the Weasel for sure, thanks.
---
No talk of quitting please, this is against the forum rules. Admins please do your job

Yes. I actually got someone with it. It's hard you move at 87.6% movement speed

Oh, suck it up.
---
Lol overconfidence uses insidious? Lol toxic!
---
I mean to be fair the same could be said for Moris, insta-downs, BBQ, Nurses, CI, Sloppy, Devour, Franklin's, Ruin, NOED, etc. The list goes on but it's not the survivors of killers it is shitty game mechanics the devs refuse to fix.
---
This isn‚Äôt overconfidence lol. He was just trying to juke you bc he was running out of options.

UHHH HEAVY RAIN SPOILER BRO CMON /s
---
Yeah but shes a 110 killer, being absolutely clueless when you're at range just wouldn't work well. I think any changes to her base would ruin her. But on your idea of no collision, it would make all spirits run stridor which just fucks everyone even more, especially those with iron will as its a complete counter. Plus it would allow you to go inside survivors and it would just be buggy.
---
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
---
I think his best addons are the ones that recover his power faster. Make sure you're immediately using it from the start of the match. You can usually easily get a grab on someone off a generator early in the game by crouching up to them with his power on.
---
I didn‚Äòt notice the creeper in the video

People really just wanted hitsboxes to make more sense. They thought that servers would help, its just sad that they don‚Äôt. Sure I see less of the stupidly high red ping now, but I‚Äôm getting a lot of hits that I know I shouldn‚Äôt have.
---
I would prefer content with known bugs because I know how to fix them temporarily until I do a rinse repeat process such as kyf lobbies being buggy with servers or swf can‚Äôt all join the same lobby. These issues are temporarily fixable until they are ultimately fix in a giant ass update. But when it‚Äôs a small content update that provides some cosmetics and a small in game mechanic that was there before it‚Äôs laughable and unless they fucked up something hard such as you can‚Äôt access the game or you can‚Äôt queue etc. it‚Äôs inexcusable. If you need to wait till Halloween possibly passed that to fix all the bugs that could possibly create more just give me the damn update because I know how to deal with the bugs that are currently there. Pardon my comment about you being a higher being it was implied that you think this sub is full of idiots which in your words is not what you meant so my mistake. But if you don‚Äôt want to bother to read the paragraph here‚Äôs a summary
---
I would rather have content now then later because I know the same problems will arise at some point make the extra time worthless and wasted. So I believe the devs should stop wasting time and release the update unless the game is that royally fucked up.
---
&gt;I mean to be fair the same could be said for Moris, insta-downs, BBQ, Nurses, CI, Sloppy, Devour, Franklin's, Ruin, NOED, etc. The list goes on but it's not the survivors of killers it is shitty game mechanics the devs refuse to fix.
---
Why are you mentioning BBQ, Nurse's Calling and NOED? All these mechanics are completely fine.
---
That‚Äô is 100% true. @DriftSpeaks said he was going to make another meme expressing OP killer builds. But I agree with u.
---
The Legion crew next pliz?...
---
I like when someone runs a Killer for a while then comes to my almost completed gen and I take up the chase while they finish it. It's like a super satisfying relay race.
---
Yes, and surprise but... they didn‚Äôt have to give you an event to begin with. Stop bitching about it.  It will come out when it comes out.
---
Why the hell does it matter if it‚Äôs before or after Halloween? It‚Äôs a damn day. Take the event and shut your mouth. Lmao.

SWF being balanced if you‚Äôre a good killer: maybe vanilla, sure. But a 4 stack with instaheals objectively is not no matter how good the killer is
---
Whining about the number of pallets thing: clearly hyperbole for their meme and worth whining about 
---
Gen rushing: for sure something killers will say if they just didn‚Äôt play well, but it‚Äôs also a real and legitimate tactic beyond just doing gens. Prioritizing doing gens over healing and doing totems and searching chests is certainly gen rushing and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. It‚Äôs a strat with upsides and potential negatives
---
Why are you defending lazy devs and why are you so hostile. Calm down
---
Do you think the addons that increase the movement speed when crouching is a good combination with the addons that recover the power more faster?
---
Who the fuck says killer is easy?
---
I'm guessing you're fairly new to the game ü§î But Noed is a free ticket to kills because you as a killer failed your objectives. Also just naming off things survivors find annoying.
---
I just wish they'd quiet his footsteps dude, even if its just while playing as him. I can't hear shit

Well I only think she should be ‚Äúblind‚Äù when she is in her ability where she isn‚Äôt 110 at all. I like her base kit a lot and I think she is fun to play. There‚Äôs no way to really nerf her addons I feel without changing her base kit kind of like with they did with nurse but I could be wrong. But yeah I see what you‚Äôre saying about the inside survivor shit that would be hella buggy.
---
Exactly lol

I hit rank 1 constantly I run. Dead hard,Ds,adrenaline, and bt (if you want to rank Up because of hook saves) but I also have found a lot of success recently switching dead hard and sprint burst. But you have to have a strong knowledge of the game to do that(so you can use it to get to better loops with it)
---
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend picking that pumpkin up
---
Wait, your title says "this isn't meant to be taken seriously" but now you're saying you think he's entitled, he should be held to a higher standard, and that this is an important moment to learn from? Sounds like you do want this to be taken seriously, while being passive aggressive with a meme.
---
No it isn't.  I take responsibility for my games as killer and pretending that we have no say in gens all being popped is absurd.  I'm telling you without a doubt that if you aren't able to finish games often prior to the last gen popping you aren't playing optimal killer games at all.  Either your playstyle, loadout or a combination of both is to blame.
---
MoM was never good, if anything it should be reworked completely. It shouldn't ignore the dying state, the only thing I can think of working would be scratch marks are hidden for 5 seconds after being hit but im sure there's other ideas. If you thought MoM was good before then you must not want this game to be balanced which is pretty dumb if the killer can't even kill anyone
---
Mom
---
Aaron plays really good, he gives too much credit to reslilience
---
I agree with this. When one side - regardless of which - bitches about the other, it‚Äôs clear they don‚Äôt play both enough. 
---
This is why I don‚Äôt really ‚Äúmain‚Äù one or the other.
---
Cant wait for the crapper
---
0 TR approach is really good on any killer. Allowing the first hit is great and on a 1 hit down killer is amazing. While yes, it's short and obsession based, its surprisingly good on the 1 hitters.
---
Spirit already has cool down on her ability though, so does nurse now. However I feel like the changes to add ons could help, e.g add some downsides. Most other add ons for other killers all have downsides but spirit seems to have none. E.g prayer beads, increase Haunting recovery time.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt have to play the entire game in an optimal way just to counter adrenaline. If there‚Äôs one gen left with more then 2 survivors you‚Äôre screwed.
---
Other players can report you post game. Not saying it‚Äôs likely, just possible.
---
As a low rank spirit main, I can confirm this to be true.
---
the shape is an m1 killer and the spirit isn‚Äôt easy to dodge
---
Are you drunk
---
Do you mean killer or...
---
\*singing song he forgot the lyrics to\*
---
Not how my team would put it but yea for the most part
---
&gt;I'm guessing you're fairly new to the game ü§î But Noed is a free ticket to kills because you as a killer failed your objectives. Also just naming off things survivors find annoying.
---
I guess you are confusing things a bit. Judging by the perks you are complaining, it looks like you are the new one. 
---
Survivors have more control over NOED happening or not than the killer itself. I am not going to start an argument about NOED because this is a beat up subject and if you look in my post history you'll find my opinion on the matter.
---
THANK YOU! I saw so many people telling me "the spirit is easy D0odge". Finally somebody who say the truth.
---
I wasn't but I take it back. Fuck Spirit
---
It seems like he was doing that on purpose to make the survivor get greedy, which let him get the hit.
---
Yes but the issue with your argument is that everyone used to believe that too when the game first came out and was clearly unbalanced
---
Cool suggestion. I like this

Well of course you can xd

I'm personally waiting for Jaws

I mean, I recognized the art having seen it around, but never knew about the guy until the last thread where it was Solo Survivors and the Killer playing tug of war with other people.
---
Not everyone knows, you know.
---
Id like to see new and original concepts for killers honestly.   The only pre made one i want is sweet tooth from his twisted metal black era .
---
Prioritizing doing gens over healing and totems isn't gen rushing, it's playing smart. 
---
Wasting time to work on a totem or healing with sloppy butcher can be the difference that gives the killer the edge to win. That's like saying killers that slug are "kill rushing"
---
Camping and especially tunneling is usually done to make sure you get the kills so I would say it‚Äôs more tryharding than casual.
---
Yeah fuck him for assuming he would get a Halloween event before or even on Halloween
---
Knowing dead by daylights production history it could BE that the game is just THAT fucked.
---
If hatch remove &gt; mori removed
---
Yes you should have to.  25% of your emblems are based on gens not getting repaired.  That means the devs are flat out telling you we are judging you based on if you are playing optimally or not.  You can choose to continue not applying gen pressure if you want but you can't get upset about your losses and depips it results in after the fact.
---
Yeah but to be fair we complained about wanting it so its a little bit on us as well
---
I'vr never been so sad and happy at this moment in my life
---
p-penny wise?
---
Because you can easily loop a Myers where as spirit is a lot harder, she can phase and has so many more mind games
---
Idk why, but the trapper always feels like he is faster than normal killers (yes I know he has the same movement speed). Whenever I get chased by a trapper, it feels like he starts the chase with bloodlust tier 1.
---
https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/exaggerate
---
Don't give him attention then, by making a large thread about him, you surely are giving him a larger publicity then not citing the source or a single comment. if you bloody want, the best way is to reduce his impact is to ban memes with his work.
---
So all horror games should have events? Well I‚Äôll be damned, let me grab my pitchfork. I sure as shit have plenty of games where I haven‚Äôt gotten an event.
---
It‚Äôs postponed, not cancelled. Seriously, has nobody celebrated a holiday that yknow, wasn‚Äôt on the actual day? No ones been to a Halloween party, the weekend after Halloween?
---
Shit happens. Sometimes you have to make due with what you get. I get that there was an event last year, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre entitled to it this year.
---
Which addons for stealth Myers? Is it the purple-quality mirror and the dead rabbit? 
---
I don't have monitor and abuse but that also seems somewhat necessary right?
---
I still think it was a poor decision to do so, I mean if the survivor would have just thrown down the pallet he would be fine and the killer gave him 1-2 more loops then necessary. It worked out this time coz he got greedy.
---
Exactly. I had zero hatchets to chase him properly, so I tried to improvise.
---
New Map: Loot Rock
---
A small island with a huge cave on it which Jack and crew used to store all their booty. no, get your mind out of the gutter.
---
New Killer: The Pirate
---
Jack Curtis was the ragtag leader of a merry band of pirates back in those old days. He and his crew were close friends and made a blood pact that they would stick together though the treasure, the difficulties and the rest till the bitter demise, which of course happened at the hands of another greedy band of pirates, led by Blackbeard himself. As the comrades exhaled their last breath they were met with grass and the inability to breathe again. They were all in the Entities realm with no measure of time which had passed other than their skeletal bodies with which they can use to kill and plunder once again. Who knows maybe the Entity has rum?
---
Power: Blood Pact
---
As the former captain of this crew, The Pirate tells them where to go and what to do. You have 4 crew members to distribute around by throwing a projectile skull at objects which can do various things such as; throwing them at lockers will take any survivor who opens it down a damage state and give back your crew member, throwing them in chests will do the same thing, if they are thrown on the ground they disguise as a totem. The first fake totem will be a hex and the others will be dull. The Members can be picked back up from any range by using the secondary ability button.
---
Killer Perks:
---
Hex: No one Escapes Rum:
---
Rum always helps calm the nerves. Your terror radius permanently sounds distant to all survivors and their footsteps are 1.5/2x louder than usual.

After hooking a survivor, you gain the undetectable effect for 5/9/12 seconds

If I Had A Penny For Everytime...: 
---
People just dont seem to be comfortable around you. Every time your obsession escapes a chase with you, your obsession changes randomly and you gain a token up to a maximum of 8. Each token increases the regression rate on a generator when you kick it by 2/3/5%.

---
Why is it so difficult
---
The game is in it's fourth year, if they didn't do these type of events, it would be dead. The maps are stale, there is nothing new to do in the game and we rely on these events to keep it fresh and give us a reason to play. They know this as well and hopefully after they release the new content it won't be as bad going forward. 
---
Personally, I'm happy the event was delayed because I've been playing MW since it released. I look forward to taking a break from that to come back to DBD for the event.
---
I like the random Nea
---
so the idea is to mind game the survivor via 0 terror radius or to stab one surv. stab another back to the first, stab a thrid, back to first, stab Four down one. 
---
as Legion you would need to keep track of which surv. is which, through the ability to norm. vault pallet and look around its this would be not as hard.
---
to me this looks like an idea to keep legion in the frenzy for as long as possible which is nice because frenzy is fun; BUT you could just as well hit one , two, one, two , one etc. ;you essencially can tunnel down half a team just by jumping because mending takes too long, unless legion is jumping to another pair of surv  
---
so the strat for surv. is to switch posisitons or get away as much as possible in order to mend; the problem is, this is borderline inexecutable for non-SWF, healing each other will become counter productive as it will just give legion up to FOUR free stabs; Lockers dont help becouse killer instinct can see surv. in lockers and  
---
they can just vault over pallets; so the only counter play there is is to hit them with a pellet and hope you can get rid of them;
---
I really like the idea but i think this would just be mend-by-daylight like old legion with the difference that they can tunnel more than one surv. a little slower  
---
id love if they would just throw this kinda stuff onto the PTB and test some weird shit, just to figure out what makes the least people cry
---
Aye sometimes you will work for it less than others, sometimes more than others. 
---
That's a part of being on a team. If the team wins every team member benefits.
---
Gotta love those games were you play as fair as you can and somebody isn't happy about it.
---
Does Knockout also block auras generated from other perks?
---
For example, if I down someone with knockout, would someone with Empathy or Kindred still be able to see the downed survivor?
---
That's like saying Calm Spirit is a good perk because Doc exists which is totally not the case, when you happen to play against the 16 other killers. 
---
Not getting found does not equate skill. Try not to get found to avoid unnecessary chases and waste the time of the killer? Yes, but to deliberately let other teammates die or go to another phase of the hook due to such a playstyle is a useless player.
---

Okay I

1. Downvote any memes with his format
---
2. Call him out in the comments.
---
Not sure what else I‚Äôm supposed to do here. It‚Äôs not like criticizing him on a thread with his format helps him more than It harms him.
---
lmfao it can be two things. It can be gen rushing and also the smart play. Fucking Christ
---
Dire circumstances I'd a bit op. Maybe change it to once the exit gates have been powered. If you combine that with NOED, bloodwarden and BBQ, you have the late game. BBQ can be switched with anything really.
---
Also don‚Äôt cry about NOED if you think doing gens over totems is the smart play
---
GODAMMIT, I just posted a killer concept and one of the perks is the same as undercover. FOR ENTITYS SAKE
---
We gonna ignore the fact there‚Äôs a creeper next to the Hag?
---
Rip surge, the nerf was too much for it in my opinion.
---
Yea that‚Äôs right  I didn‚Äôt go inside earlier just went to the ride and then left.
---
Dead Rabbit doesnt work with the Scratched Mirror, so use Boyfriend's Memo instead. For the Vanity Mirror, you can use the rabbit.
---
Jumpscare Myers is typically Scratched Mirror, Boyfriends Memo, Lery's Map Offering, Ruin, M&amp;A, PWYF, and NOED. I dont have M&amp;A so I just use BBQ for points and it works fine for me, so its def not necessary
---
unpopular opinion: Adrenaline and NOED are both irritating perks to go against
---
yikes
---
Nice chainsaw bro
---
NOED teaches survivors to not troll after you open the gates.
---
Yes you can permanently close hatch.  It requires a key to be brought in by survivors for it not to be permanently closed.  Short of bringing in those ultra rare crutches it is permanently closed.
---
There are actually 2 mirrors for Myers, Vanity Mirror and Scratched Mirror.
---
The one you're thinking of is Scratched Mirror, which keeps Myers in Tier 1 but allows his stalk to reveal all nearby survivors. A great companion addon with this would be Boyfriend's Letter, because otherwise you have basically no lunge (you still have barely any lunge, but that's the only addon I know of that helps out to any degree when you're in Tier 1). You could also swap Boyfriend's Letter with addons that allow you to move faster while stalking (which I think are the jewelry addons?)
---
M&amp;A is nice for Tier 2 Myers, since it drops his TR from 16 to 8, but in Tier 1 Myers's TR is 0 I believe, so you don't need M&amp;A for Scratched Mirror Myers. Instead I'd focus on perks that give you speed boosts, like Play With Your Food, since Myers is slower in Tier 1

This. Thanks to the Update being delayed, we now have to wait longer for Stealth Killers to be actually Undetectable.
---
Not getting found actually is the most important part of the game honeatly, not the most fun but the best way to win. And imagine not being found or getting hooked and having to save people who don't ever hide. Just because you want to rush the game and try to finish gens asap which ends up getting you hooked doesn't mean the rest of the team has to get chased for no reason. There's no rules specifying how you have to play and getting mad because other people not playing like you is pretty dumb too. That's the point of certain perks they benefit sole survival instead of team survival. That is why the perks exist and if you don't like it then don't get hooked and blame teammates who didn't get hooked. Stealth is the best way to survive and it doesn't make them useless because they don't play how you do. A lot of people don't know how to play but that has nothing to do with urban evasion
---
If the survivor wrote something like ‚ÄúI love flashlight blinding, gen rushing and t-bagging every game‚Äù I bet my whole two asscheeks it wouldn‚Äôt get as many downvotes. But yeah, watch me get downvoted now too.
---
Who dat
---
Pennywise is closer to the entity than the clown, so that comment could go either way.
---
New to reddit who is dat
---
Most of the time camping is a bad idea, except when you have enough pressure that you can get that person killed without all gens being nearly or 100% completed.  
---
For example, if you have two survivors hooked near each other with ruin up and 3 gens need to be done the best play would be to camp.  Even without ruin up it‚Äôd be a good idea and the best play.  
---
If you have a survivor with a key or you‚Äôre playing a stealth killer and hooked an OoO user against swf itd be a good idea to camp.
---
Camping isn‚Äôt exciting and is quite unfun, but then again getting looped by interconnected L wall T walls or god windows with 40 pallets isn‚Äôt either.  In all likelihood the opportunity to camp could have been avoided had the survivors played better.
---
Thx I have no idea what he said
---
You gotta cover up the names
---
U
---
Man we can‚Äôt even read dis shit lmao
---
Def pick it up it's great. But don't misunderstand it like I did, I'm kind of slow haha. You have to hook somebody first and then you have 40, 50, 60 seconds to get to a generator and kick it and it immediately regresses by 25%.
---
In case it‚Äôs hard to read, it says ‚ÄúNoob delete the game‚Äù
---
Sick cuz BVHR been borrowing time not giving this event. Smart
---
Okay then, thanks :D
---
‚ÄúNoob Delete the game‚Äù
---
Oh
---
Why the hell would I not name and shame them?
---
Who‚Äôs the artist? Asking for a friend
---
Yes for sure, that's pretty much my favorite combo. Helps you easier sneak up on people on generators.
---
People are trash.
---
TAKE ME BY THE CAN

Because its against the sub rules. Literally no naming and shaming other players/witchhunting

Gottem coach, we can go home now
---
If the dweard is the one where he‚Äôs bald and has the red glasses I got that from buying the special addition which gave me cosmetics for survivors and the Halloween and winter eyes for killer
---
Totally intentional
---
The Nurse did üòÅ
---
No way? Literally no way that is being swept under the rug like, say... putting a buffer in your time table if the event is huge and is likely to have some bugs or difficulties along the way? Dont announce it too early if you arent able to hold the deadline? Getting people hyped up with ambitious additions to the event is great - if you actually plan it through. They could have taken their time with it instead of canceling it on the last day and disappointing most players. Expecting difficulties along the way and planning in some extra time beforehand should be a business practice bhvr understands but clearly they didnt do that and now fans are mad.
---
You want me to send you a link to the gameplay? I'm not shitting on him. I'm just pointing out that he would've got 4 kills but DS exists.
---
Perk concepts have been so good lately
---
Lol completely unintentional but hilarious anyways
---
True, at least u don‚Äôt have to worry about your teammates being trash
---
Well said, my friend. Well fucking said.
---
Of course, you'll now be downvoted to Hell for speaking the truth.
---
No. He didnt.
---
even if he did, doesn't change the fact that he would've 4ked if that person did not have ds.
---
Camping is when you won't leave the area that the Survivor is hooked. This is generally seen as a bad move because if you're next to the survivor, you're not doing gens. Unless at least two survivors are next to you and you *know* they're there, you typically don't want to camp.
---
Face Camping is when you lose all sorts of defense as to it being cause by Survivors, because when Face Camping you literally just stand a foot away from the  hook and don't worry about anything other than Survivors who come in for the unhook.
---
Shhh, play dead, confused spirit is confused.
---
When somebody DCs to give their friend the hatch when it should have been a 4K I‚Äôm definitely gonna get mad. 
---
Also when people DC on first down I miss out on a BBQ stack.
---
‚ÄúRaw rank 20 energy‚Äù is a powerful phrase imma have to start using lmao
---
This but unironically
---
Why is Jason there? Did he sneak in there again?
---
Everything about this is correct
---
It isn't invalid.  It is a direct response to the false claim you put forth.  You would have needed to make a different claim for that to have been an invalid response.
---
Again it sounds like you don't play to pressure the gens.  The devs rank 25% of your game based on this.  There are several killers and loadouts designed to achieve this exact thing.  Freddy for instance is fucking insanely strong for consistently ending games with gens up.  I like to use him against heavy toolbox swf lobbies.  Snares, Ruin, PGTW, Thanataphobia, and Dying Light/BBQ/Franklin's depending on a few things I see pre lobby.  Swing Chains make this extra nutty.
---
There are YouTube videos that can really help you develop your gen pressure.  I learned the most from Otz and True personally but there's others out there that are also worth watching.
---
Well theres a halloween event in this patch
---
That ones justifiable lol.
---
yea what is that thing
---
The Saw is Law.
---
he only needs 1% of his power to get a 4k
---
I tend to find "separating the art from the artist" more for someone like, John Lennon, and his music vs his difficult and complicated personal relationships with his wife and child. I do not find it necessary to separate a nazi from his art. *especially* not when he uses said art to propagate his nazi views.
---
Dude I know his chase music https://youtu.be/0PrHmSAK6zg it also adds new sounds throughout it so it could be like if the killer is close it‚Äôs the full song but if he‚Äôs far it‚Äôs just Gary‚Äôs eyes.
---
There hasnt been a halloween event since last year WTF LUL are u confused?
---
Steam is having some issues today
---
I swear you all are in an alternate universe because the otz I watch fights survivors in end game chat and bitches about them in game too.
---
"Wait where's Wrai- oh."
---
And what if others let him stalk them ? Do I let them die for their tomfoolery ?
---
Ah to bad, cross play would be a great thing on console.
---
The point of using your asinine logic of "it's just a day" on your SO for their birthday/your anniversary. 
---
Went right over your head.
---
I'd have to print it out first lol I do all my art digitally. I tried to make this look like traditional art though with paper textures and faux oil brushes.
---
Only between ps4 and xbox yeah
---
Wha?  :0
---
I only occasionally play killer, but earlier today I had a match where the final 2 survivors 3 gen'd themselves and refused to work on any of them. They spent like (what felt like) 10 minutes hiding in hopes I would D/C and when I finally found and downed them THEY both D/C'd. They generally just wasted my time because they couldn't win. I have the right to get mad about that tbh D/Cing knowing youre gonna lose your points just so the killer can't get the points they earned should make anyone irritated
---
I wish I didn't agree with you
---
I ended up doing just that :D [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dohivt/the\_plague\_art\_nouveau\_style\_portrait\_im\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dohivt/the_plague_art_nouveau_style_portrait_im_not/)
---
Made this on my phone when I couldn't sleep excuse the quality
---
Yes, you die a lot from your team being dumb, trust me im always the one to get downed bc he pops tier 3 the first time he sees me. he is no map pressure, so work around that
---
I'm sorry? What?
---
It‚Äôs either I chase a survivor when there‚Äôs one gen left and they pop or if I‚Äôm lucky and there all together I‚Äôll have to abandon every chase to protect gens and they‚Äôll still all be done and then the survivor I‚Äôm chasing is fully healed and gets to run faster then me. That‚Äôs unfair
---
What do you mean? If I get 20k bloodpoints normally wouldnt I get 40k during bloodhunt?
---
So say I get 10k bloodpoints, but I have BPS, that would bring it to 20k. But during bloodhunt it would get me to 40k?
---
So many interesting ideas for perks because of their group dynamic.
---
Daphne, being the 'Damsel in distress' could increase other survivor's action speeds while she's being chased, as she's usually the distraction. Maybe something that helps or incentives her being saved.
---
Fred, with his "split up and look for clues" mantra could maybe reward players for going their separate ways to accomplish tasks. 
---
Shaggy (Zoinks!) could have a perk which helps him find other survivors when in trouble and/or gains a bonus when he finds them.
---
And Velma; maybe her detective skills could help her discern the whereabouts of the killer and their belongings, growing stronger with more tokens as she gathers more information.
---
A Scooby survivor seems.... unlikely... but I'd like to see something which invokes the moments where Scooby would taunt and mock the various ghosts and ghouls. Perhaps gaining benefits when being in the killers line of site and performing 'brave actions'. Staring straight at them without moving, using items, teabagging (why not).
---
I'm no expert at game balance or development and obviously there's no numbers or specifics but let me know what you think.
---
Seems like they got to you if your posting it on reddit :D
---
people like to say it‚Äôs toxic but it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs just good play on the survivors part
---
but that being said it is annoying as hell
---
I don't even think killers can pretend like they have the high ground to bitch about DCs when half of them DC (on PS4) the minute they lose Ruin. I'm still somewhat against penalties but something's gotta change.
---
