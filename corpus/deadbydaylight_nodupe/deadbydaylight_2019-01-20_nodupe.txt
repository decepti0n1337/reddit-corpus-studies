you might want to look at this, while its true that there's no real advantage to hitting 100, its not a significant negative either because the xp to iridescent shard ratio is still pretty similar. also it doesn't take longer to level the second time
---
Imagine having to wait for BBQ n Chilli in the shrine of secrets....

People can't really accuse you of camping if they're hook-diving hardcore. Especially if it's like, more than half the team doing it. 
---
I dunno, people are dumb sometimes.
---
I always found Wraith’s pallet stun screech quite terrifying. He sounds demonic
---
So you guys have convinced yourselves that losing to legion means not only that the killer is broken but that the killers who use legion are shitty.
---
Fucking hilarious. 
---
Did she seriously...? What was she *thinking*?
---
I would love to have more gens like that, for example a discoteque that when you turn a gen under the stage the music starts playing (like l4d2 concert) or stuff like that. Also the tvs at the hospital should turn on after you do the gens just at the part of the screams
---
You're the typical player who never plays the other side. 
---
You seem like the killer I want to go up against when I want to watch every hook-farming, sand-bagging piece of ass this game has and me die, Thank you.

Nurse is mostly about practice and muscle memory. 
---
First off, don't be afraid of the addons that "decrease accuracy". As far as I and anyone else can tell, it actually doesn't do anything. 
---
Next you probably want to be consistent with your addons, and not change them around too much. Pick a load out you are comfortable with and stick with it so your muscle memory doesn't get messed up. I prefer the green addon that increases range and +1 blink. Yeah people will rage at you for that extra blink but you might need it against anyone that knows what they are doing. When you are blinking for distance, flick your mouse up slightly to increase the range to its maximum. 
---
Alright, now for actual gameplay. If you have 3 blinks, try not to use the third blink until you absolutely need to. Make them think you only have two. That way when you use the third they won't expect it and you will definitely get the hit. You want to keep blinking from generator to generator. Only use one blink for this, as the stun time is pretty short. Remember that your base movement is slower than survivors. You can't just run them down. Always go for the blink, even if they are right in front of you. When you chase survivors try to avoid teleporting in a straight line directly behind them. It's super easy to dodge you this way. Use the first blink to go slightly to the left or right, and if you can't hit then use the second blink to correct and come at them from a more perpendicular angle. 
---
You can "fake" a blink by blinking at the ground. This is useful for survivors that like to change direction when you blink, or if they are jumping from one side of the pallet to another. They'll just run right into you. Beware of any floors below you though. 
---
Maps with good line of sight, like Asylum and The Game are your best. Maps with poor line of sight like Lery's or the Swamp are your worst. 
---
Lastly, get good at trash talking because your post game chat is always going to be super toxic.
---
My recommended perk load out is Ruin, BBQ, Nurse's Calling, and either Monitor and Abuse or Make Your Choice. 
---
Posted earlier but figured I'm a newbie for reddit use and only had a link. Figure this makes it more attractive. xD
---
I was talking about the colour did you made the game to change perks to their designs
---
Chucky lol
---
Don't forget to tag as shitpost
---
I wish i knew that guy
---
Didn't expect to see competitive Smash stuff in my DBD but yes, that comparison is apt.
---
The other Dwight is having some thoughts on the situation
---
Gotcha. Regardless of there being no xp difference, it's still a completely pointless system. I just hit my first devotion level and was really disappointed to see my iridescent shard gain dropped back down to 50. The system is pointless was the main point of this post.
---
I had a Kate get stuck in a tree last week. I felt sorry for her, because she wasn't great at chasing. I downed her and let her go because that was something I had hoped the killer had done with me when I got stuck in a tree some time ago when playing survivor. 
---
But I agree; there are definitely reasons to DC without being toxic. The one stated by OP is not one of them, though..
---
Every time I get into a lobby my Meg is always T-posing on bitches 
---
Fair enough 
---
They’re usually sitting around the map, like in family residence there’s one sitting under the main building, on haddonfield it’s beside a picnic table etc
---
Lmao you just stole my meme and changed the image
---
We were at Springwood, and I had just solo finished the third generator when our second teammate was hooked for the last time. Time to get serious, it's just you (blue haired Feng) and me, with two generators left to do. We got this.
---
Leatherface began to patrol between the last four generators. No worries, I've been here before. We can whittle these bad boys down, and if we play our cards right and work together, we can both get out of this alive.
---
I bounced back and forth between a few of them, assuming you were doing the same. That's when I saw you: blue pigtails, white mask, hiding behind the bushes near the edge of the map. I ran over to try to coordinate which generator to take care of, when you urban evaded over to the middle of the street, and proceeded to t-bag on the hatch. Cool, good to know, now let's finish this game!
---
Wrong. You walked back to your warm spot behind the bushes. You pointed at nothing, then looked at the bush. 
---
We were faced with two options:
---
1. Sit here, hiding, till Leatherface disconnects and we lose all our BP, 
---
2. Play the game, and attempt to complete the objectives.  
---
I hopped on a generator and completed about a 25% before LF's loop brought him to me. Slinking from gen to gen, I ended up progressing them a tiny bit, hoping that it would keep him occupied long enough for you to make some progress. 
---
Wrong. You stayed behind the bushes. While hopping from gen to gen, I could always find your little blue pigtails, moving around just enough to keep the crows away, always behind the bushes, as near as possible to the hatch. 
---
I ran to the farthest generator, made some noise, then snuck back to a generator I had decided to focus on. Without any help, it took a few trips, but I got it done. Each trip, there you were; blue pigtails, white mask, behind the bush.
---
One more generator to complete. Three generators to choose from. Leatherface was checking gens like clockwork now; Generator 1, Generator 2, Generator 3, repeat. I didn't even need to look behind me anymore, because he was always coming from one direction. 
---
*10% done.*
---
*20% done.*
---
*Leatherface, switch generators while he searches for a bit and damages that generator, repeat.*
---
***Blue hair.***
---
***White mask.***
---
**Bushes.**
---
Our game passed the 30 minute mark. I got impatient. I got sloppy. Leatherface saw me, and hooked me for the first time, in the middle of the map.
---
There you were. Bushes. Leatherface decided that he would run circles around me instead of search for you. I don't blame him, for any part of his game, except that he never thought to look behind the bushes, away from any of the generators. After my entire hook timer was up, I saw you move from your hidey-hole toward your long awaited prize. 
---
I play both killer and survivor, but I only play about 25% of my killer games seriously. I enjoy letting survivors go, messing around with them, or just playing games without focusing on getting the 4k. When I do play seriously, I refuse to camp or tunnel, and if I happen to run into the same survivor three times in a row, I won't hook them till I've hooked someone else. 
---
But because of you, I will never, *ever,* let a blue haired Feng live. All "toxic" behavior, all logical reasoning is now priority #2 if I ever see that *damn* mask, and those *damn* blue pigtails while I have a weapon in my hand. To all blue haired Feng's out there, you must die for the sins of your sister. 
---
^^^^I ^^^^will ^^^^also ^^^^be ^^^^burning ^^^^all ^^^^bushes ^^^^I ^^^^see ^^^^in ^^^^real ^^^^life ^^^^from ^^^^this ^^^^moment ^^^^forward. 
---
yeah happens to me quite often, i get around it by starting a swf and solo queuing from there. as for killer no problems for me so far
---
Thanks mate. It would be interesting if you could use them haha.
---
I wonder if it's anything to do with the event soon?
---
Obligatory explanation: In this bloodweb I have to choose between the perks "Left Behind" And "No One Left Behind".
---
Why would a killer dc on the game?
---
In fact, let's take it several steps further!  
---
Hex: Huntress Lullaby: Survivors receive a 20%/40%/60% progression penalty for missing a Skill Check. Each survivor hooked decreases the warning time by 200%. (so it'll work like it does at 5 stacks when it's only at 1 stack)  
---
Thanatophobia:  
---
1 Survivor: -60%  
---
2 Survivors: -90%  
---
3 Survivors: -120%  
---
4 Survivors: -150%  
---
A Nurse's Calling: See survivors healing and/or being healed within a 280 meter range.  
---
Stridor: Injured Survivors are 500% louder. Healthy survivors are 250% louder.  
---
Tinkerer: When a generator reaches 85%, your Terror Radius disappears for 120 seconds and you receive a noise notification.
---
Also nurse has some counter play just not usually with pallets you can bait going round corners and double back to avoid the attack
---
It's mainly bc they cant give the attention to their chat when they are playing killer. You'll find more killer game play on YouTube 
---
Immanuel kant's critique of pure reason isn't a moral polemic?
---
&gt; If you’re at the hatch the only reason they get the hatch would be because you let them.
---
You clearly have no idea what you are talking about. Do you even play killer? 
---
If you are at hatch, and they show up, then you have to wait for them to jump in and catch them. If you hit them then they will jump in and you won't be able to catch them since your attack will be on cool down. You can even put them in the dying state and they will *still* be able to hop to their feet and into the hatch. And even if you do catch them, if they have Decisive Strike then they will stun you and easily get the hatch. 
---
NOED can be countered by cleansing totems. And lol who even complains about Rancor? It's not even a good perk dude. 
---
The hatch mechanics are completely one sided. The *only* chance that the killer has at getting the last survivor with the hatch in play is to put them in the dying state far away from the hatch. To suggest that the hatch is bad for both tells me you either don't know what you are talking about, or you are straight up lying. 
---
Yes because I am a killer main victim and I am bullied relentlessly by OP survivors &gt;:^(
---
I just disable messages/chat, what they have to say doesn’t really matter
---
In my opinion, it can be a bad map from both sides
---
Freddy darns no longer
---
I feel bad when this happens because I have 0 interest in farming but I don’t want you guys to waste your streamers either
---
4 legions vs 16 survivors on the swap map
---
Maybe if they’re playing huntress or possibly billy 
---
I see both sides of the debate (I play surv/killer about 50/50), but I will 100% avoid obvious toxic SWF groups and there’s no convincing me otherwise. Why would I play with people whose sole goal is to make the game unfun for me?
---
Freddy has been outdarned
---
Myers is also a bench to play as on their imo
---
Honestly I’m a pretty slow artist and I tend to multi-task so this probably took about 10 hours ish lol! And yes of course, I love DBD especially Legion and Spirit so more to come :D
---
The monster from *It Follows* would either be horrifically overpowered or hilariously underpowered. Here's my concept: 
---
 The monster is only visible to the obsession. What the obsession does see is what appears to be one of their teammates. The appearance will change to a different teammate after each chase is broken. The monster can only attack the obsession, but will see the aura of the obsession at all times. Like the movie, it can only walk, which would make it the slowest killer in the game. It never has a terror radius though. This combined with the appearance of a survivor would make it a very stealthy killer. The monster also has an active ability as well. When activated the obsession movement speed begins to drop, before eventually being paralyzed from exhaustion altogether. When the obsession is hooked, the obsession target will switch to another survivor. 
---
it does, but most of these killers tend to not be good and the most toxic when they're only able to rely on tunneling the unhooked even when healthy survivors are right in front of them it's like they don't exist 
---
Add the shitpost flair friend
---
Ooh I never thought of that :0 I thought blue would illuminate her black hair if that makes sense
---
Easy refers to how difficult the character is to learn. Not how difficult the character is to win with. 
---
Very fast Pig moving at very hihg speeds
---
😂😂👌
---
Too much work for snapchat my dude
---
Yes! I cant stand games where a couple of team mates spend time in chase's and unhooking eachother, I do 3+ gens and survive but dont get +1 pip because I never had to heal myself or unhook anyone... like they did a good job distracting the killer, I did a good job stealthily completing gens... team work. This promotes hook save stealing and shit because I get kore for a pallet stun then I do for completing a gen.  
---
/end rant
---
No they’ve been in the game for ages, only really thought about it just now
---
Honestly that makes the fan art even better, her hair is by far the best part of the drawing. Truly phenomenal.
---
Yes it does.  It's difficult but definitely doable.
---
In reality, a god killer knows when to stop chasing a good survivor.
---
Sooner or later, it becomes not worth it to chase the survivor.  Even if they DO eventually catch them, there are 3 generators completed already and the game is nearly over.
---
It’s weak in the sense that you might have to walk for a full minute to pick up a trap and place it where you want. That time far outweighs a 7 second dream transition.
---
If Trapper could get traps from lockers, he’d be MUCH stronger.
---
What's that?
---
, I'm new to the game
---
*I smell a quality post! Upvote!*
---
they are ochiditos
---
now with 4x the claw
---
It’s glitched? How so? (I’m a wraith main and I run sloppy butcher and bloodhound cause trash lmao)
---
Ah thanks a ton!! 
---
You know the game isn't real life don't you ? 
---
It's a game. It's to have fun. Being toxic annihilates fun, at least for one side (if not for both, being toxic can be funny for like, 30 seconds... then it gets pretty boring). You are playing an online multiplayer game, it's for you and the others to have fun, not just to "fuck their day up". If everyone had the same way of thinking, there wouldn't be as much players, and way less new players. So less money would be put into the game, so less to no servers, and the game would inevitably die. And the community that would've stayed would have a bad reputation (so less new players, etc...) 
---
But basically, just have fun with others, or just go play another solo game.
---
U can see my foot in this photo
---
While this isn’t untrue it is a flawed line of thought. While tunneling one guy down your allowing 3 other survivors to do gens uncontested which screws you.
---
When they can't find the devour hope totem.
---
Makes sense. His gun insta downs and he can instantly hook and kill you with the hook.
---
I am truly half gay. 
---
I sincerely run m&amp;a. 
---
At the start of the match,
---
Or if searching for hatch,
---
Will you find my radius? Nay.
---
No problem! I see a lot of Huntress fan art, and this is by far one of the top three, if not the best I've seen so far.
---

---
If you’re trying to tell me Freddy is better than Trapper... no.
---
I know. I'm not arguing with you, but in a skewed way it is a strategy to win
---
New killer: The Moth
---
Oh God no. I’m just saying that sometimes it’s better to leave those 2 traps in the corner of Red Forest because it would take you too long to retrieve them.
---
Switched out self care, dead hard and borrowed time for bond, sprint burst and we’re gonna live forever
---
Trap windows and looping spots and dont bomb it straight to your totems if youre using hexes in case survs watch where you go.
---
Iron Grasp is pretty good with helping you get hooks as she is quite slow. 
---
But that would involve a metric *ton* of movelist creation.  I'm down, but it'd take a long time for even basic MKP.
---
Just for shits and giggles I should eh? :b
---
Yep, you get b&amp;c from letheface.
---
Haha...
---
I got the building to get the perk to other killers from Legion discordance do you think this perks will be good for the spirit and the pig or Freddy or you don't think it be good for any of them
---
Yeah but this only works until the nurse hits the point of being a literal god and downing you nearly every second blink.
---
This gave me perspective that we actually have a good amount of killers
---
Thing is, it's a game. You're SUPPOSED to have fun playing it, as a survivor or as a killer. 
---
Gen rushing is not fun for the killer (even though it's only gen rush when SWF imo)
---
Tunneling is not fun for survivors 
---
Nobody likes it when some random guy is fucking up what's supposed to be a good time. Be fair, and let everyone have fun. Even if you don't "win" by escaping or killing every survivors.
---
But yeah camping is for morons. 
---
I get your point though
---
I would love a bun bun Nea. 😍 
---
Nice work!
---
Discordance is really good perk for any killer because it stops genrushing
---
Fuck me everybody told me that the best perks for all killers my next paycheck I'll drop five bucks on Leatherface
---
Never ever EVER place the trap IN a pallet drop area if you teleport to it you will be stuck in the pallet for the rest of the game and monitor and abuse is gr8 
---
They are both very real as the words exist to define actions that either side does. 
---
The real question is do you consider them toxic or not, not whether or not they exist. 
---
I don't know why I posted this. This is a dead meme lol.
---
oh yeah I'm not saying actual camping isn't shitty; the fact that people do that is super weird to me
---
Im laughing at how dumb you are right now
---
Honestly, if you did it just for the milestone, keep it like this :D

---
I thought this was a good perk I like using Legion even though he's a low tier next to Freddy
---
Thankfully, I don't. 
---
That is literally the whole point lmaoooo when you heal you’re wasting time which means gens get done slower what did you think the frenzy was for? It’s to waste time just like reverse bear traps are used and I’ve never gotten that bug before but if you’re experienced enough you should know how to lose him since apparently he’s a bad killer so it should be easy 
---
How long have you been playing? What rank are you? If you think the game is killer sided you probably are pretty inexperienced. 
---
&gt; SWF takes forever 
---
What? A four man SWF basically means you connect to a killer instantly. 
---
&gt; every killer runs bbq and chili, ruin, sloppy butcher, noed, etc
---
Every survivor runs decisive strike, borrowed time, self heal, sprint burst, dead hard, lithe, adrenaline, and we'll make it. 
---
At least the strong killer perks can be countered. The survivor perks are all get-out-of-jail free cards that the killer can't really do anything about.
---
&gt; Killers get ridiculous reach at times and can land hits at angles they shouldn’t
---
And survivors dodge hits that they shouldn't. It goes both ways because of latency and the lack of dedicated servers. 
---
&gt; Plus killers can pick and choose games they want (e.g., seeing two or more items brought in unless it’s flashlights and backing out).
---
On the contrary, killers are more likely to back out *when* they see multiple flashlights. You clearly don't know what you are talking about. 
---
&gt; It’s nearly impossible to max out survivor categories, except objective and boldness.
---
Survival is easy to max out...just escape. Altruism is the easiest. You just rescue players and heal them. 
---
&gt; I just want to see a little more balance because, in my view, this game is totally killer-sided.
---
Your view is wrong. 
---
wait 10 seconds at most??? oh wow, thats hard. Not like you can do that during chase.... im sorry but not every trap can be utilized without spending a shitload of time so a portion of your "power" isnt even used.
---
I love how dramatic it is xD
---
I guess you can say you were...  
---
Cursed:  
---
Thrill of The Hunt?
---
Hi, die hard Nightmare fan, just wanna clear up some details here.   
---
In the 2010 remake, which our Freddy is from, he IS a pedophile, but it was never tinkered with that he killed the children, just screwed around. HE was burned for that, which is why he is back. He wants to kill for revenge, but also has a side plan, which I won't spoil.  
---
In the original, however, they never specifically stated he did anything sexual with the children, but they did imply it. In the original series, he murdered the children, and was burned after being chased down. (There are several "canon" stories,but most agree he was chased down or tracked down by the parents of the kids he killed, and they burned him alive in his boiler room).   
---
FUN FACT, the boiler room he was burned in was where he worked at, a factory, which is also where he took his "children" to have his fun in.   
---
He would molest children later on when he was burned up, but it was brought up later far after his death, never confirmed he did it in his life, but 100% tinkered with!   
---
FINAL THING, that WAS how he was born, it gave him one of his nicknames: The bastard son of 100 maniacs. And there were 2 reasons listed that could be considered canon as to why he was let go: one version said he was not read his Miranda rights, the other said the search warrant was incorrectly written, the ladder being the usually agreed on version.  
---
TL:DR Freddy was 100% a pedo in the remake, but not a kid killer until he came back for revenge. In the OG series, he killed the children, 20+ when he was burned, but never specifically called a pedophile, although it was hinted throughout the films that he may have done some things with the kids. 
---
Ace is literally Mike Wazowski’ing in the back.
---
yeah, people who only play survivor love making up rules about how killers should play and bitching about it when they don't. 
---
Imo the dramatic edit is better that the actual clip. I just like to edit :D
---
It's sad to see a Feng act like that. I wish Fengs would only be played by non-toxic people, because she's a qt3.14
---
save the savet for last is it the same thing as Save The Best For Last or is this a completely different perked it is a how do I get that one
---
The most fun killer to face since he actually got me hyperventilating last night with a Jumpscare. No other killer can do that except Pig
---
Is it not? That’s ridiculous. This is griefing, no question about it.
---

Looks like I solved Dead by Daylight's biggest dilemma.
---
Rap Devil
---
I'm sorry, OK!? 
---
I don't mind them honestly, I just don't' get why people just don't go do gens. Anytime I play survivor and someone tries this shit.. i'll just go work on gens.. they cant' defend both.  I know I got EZPZ time doing gens because they're not leaving the hatching to check thinking i'm hiding waiting for the hatch play and once the gate is open.. they now have 3 points to try and defend. people who just sit there for 15 mins getting mad because the killer won't let them escape.. SMH.
---
Long as I break 20K I'm fine with it, I'll play how I want to and I'm trying my best to be an effective killer, if that means swapping off targets to the person carrying toolbox or medkit and letting an injured surv go then so be it. If people get angry at me for trying my best then that's their problem, I'll say GG at the end of a round whether its all 4 people escaping or all 4 killed.
---
I got 2 reasons. Probably didn’t want to crash if they are still worried about it or cause scratch marks are actually super fucking hard to see and from what I can tell clip u see the snow. It’s like corn.
---
Mostly agree, but tunneling is definitely a thing. I've seen killers drop a chase to zoom across the map so they can down a guy who was just unhooked. But generally, returning to the hook when you can't find anyone else is pretty normal. 
---
Gen rushing though, that's kinda what survivors are supposed to do.
---
How do you feel about leader being different?
---
You don't need to play nurse, just spend bp on her. That's what i did
---
Escaping doesn’t max out survival.... You clearly don’t know what you’re talking about...
---
I got to rank 4 survivor last season and I’ve been intentionally blowing rank since...
---
Love the assumptions and snark in your response though, makes for great discussion.
---
This sounds like my swf group. Lmao, they are always trashing on the killer for the smallest things. It is safe to say they dont play much killer. 
---
Yeah that's true
---
It’s really not. Most Trappers place them at the dumbest times.
---
Everyone complains that firecrackers are OP, but still... I like the idea of add-ons for it.
---
I hate when my shit spawn in the open or in a not so discrete place and it begs the survivor to cleanse it. The hex might as well be the 5th survivor at that point
---
The best part is that second survivor who left probably would've been able to flashlight save, but they just said "Nope" and left their teammate to die, at one of the worst times to die. Truly a good teammate.
---
&gt; I got to rank 4 survivor last season and I’ve been intentionally blowing rank since...
---
(X) 
---
This is actually really cool! Poor Dwight, always getting bullied...
---
Console or PC? If it’s pc I can’t help you. If it’s PS4 you first have to master mindgames first to help with the frames. Play a bunch of Clown and then learn.
---
How is it yours then
---
Would be pretty cool to have these add ons to be honest. But I feel like they would probably be strong, which is perfectly fine since they are one time use imo
---
So?
---
At least Freddy doesn't have to pick up his power, and can sleep survivors at will. This is made easier with the range add-ons.
---
Anything but 4 mans take ages to load into.
---
Killers tend to run a full meta load out more so than survivors. If you don’t believe me test it out for yourself.
---
Latency favours the killer the vast majority of the time. I don’t really think you can even debate this due to killer being host.
---
You’ve proven his point by saying killers are more likely to back out when they see an item, though I don’t know why he said except for flashlights...
---
Survival is ridiculously hard to max out. You get 5k for escaping, 300 if you fully heal yourself with self care(on average), and the rest comes from either escaping the killers grasps or unhooking yourself, of which both are uncommon.
---
The game is killer sided depending on the killer. Of course this isn’t always true and certain maps are bullshit to deal with as killer, *cough cough* haddonfield, but in general the game is somewhat in favour of killer when the lobby is full of players if average skill levels. This being the majority of the player base. 
---
Now you can argue that skilled SWF are strong than killer because in general they are, though there are exceptions. 
---
To be totally honest, I only use Dwight in any photo where the survivor's face is in focus. Most of the models for use are very basic; I've only found good models for Dwight and Meg, so I use them the most

I love the screaming from the building part lol
---
You’re right. And survivors should start the game on the hook and if they actually get the 4% chance then they should be in the dying state. Is that what you want? AcTuAlLy I pLaY oN cOnSoLe. And in a hatch standoff I can just go to the bathroom sooo your arguments are invalid. Seeing as though you have yet to bring up a valid point and you’re attempting to attack me personally, which is a fallacy, I’ll go ahead and assume I won this debate, which unlike a hatch standoff, was one sided. But think whatever you want to. :) have a nice day good sir.

Ruin and Monitor &amp; Abuse how do I get these perks and can you recommend me any other good perks I won't be able to get barbecue and chili till I get my next paycheck
---
Small game tho
---
No. The male survivors can crouch low enough they won't be seen behind something. It has jack shit to do with anatomy.
---
Well, it is a one time use item, so it being powerful would make sense for it.

You forget to say noed? Why ruin?

He is perfectly balanced between a dumpster fire and overpowered.
---
He's both at the same time.
---
You play him as intended and he's the worst killer in the game.
---
You play him as he was unintended and he's literally unbeatable because there is literally nothing you can really do once that timer starts.
---
No clue buddy 
---
No one said he was to strong or weak, i was simply talking about how annoying and boring it is to go against him

I didn't DE rank to pub stomp as I detailed above. I did it to have fun and do silly stuff. I would actually get moments where I COULD play to win and chose not to as it was hilarious. 
---
A great example would be if in a chase a survivor goes in a locker. I would pretend I didn't see it and walk all about as if searching for them. I would end it by walking up to the locker and standing there for a second or two, then just leaving. Do they think they were lucky? Did I scare them? Usually in post game chat it would be a conversation and laughs. It's a sad that people would de-rank to give others a nightmare game/pub stomp.
---
Dwogge the Hags coming. Oh fuck she has Monitor and Abuse. He cant hear the terror radius. Oh god oh fuck
---
People learned how to do that immediately the problem stemmed from the people going "oh just give it time/ he just came out you need to learn how to play/play against him"
---
Thankfully those ignorant voices have now died out.
---
Sadly what took it's place are those who think Legion is fine. Those people are bad for the game.

1-hit Killers work get with STBFL. Ex. Freddy, Pig, Spirit, etc.

It’s also not bad to camp a hook if you have tier 3 chili’s and no one pops when you hook. I mean I still run around and look in a small area but I’m going to wait for one of them to make a mistake first instead of crippling myself by just wandering off.
---
That is what I expected to happen. Think she left by accident honestly with how close we were.
---
Obviously she has Hex: Ruin which is generally run by most killers, but I like not running ruin and running devour hope instead.
---
If you have a ruin, survivors will be looking for a totem and might destroy your devour hope instead.
---
It's also extremely easy to stack devour hope while still guarding hooks because you can trap the area around the hook, not right in front of it, and teleport when they trip them as they run away. You can still trap right in front of the hook, but if they trigger it make sure you wait a second to let them get the unhook, then teleport. The add-on that prevents a fake Hag from spawning on trigger helps a lot with this.
---
I still find it funny that a hulk of a killer like Trapper can't  carry all his traps. But little miss Amanda piggy can waltz around with 4 reverse traps that are much  larger 😂😂
---
Some go back and forth between survivor and killer. I see a lot of killers in the morning time. Just look at some YouTube videos, a lot of streamers will post videos, too. 
---
Unfortunately, I'm on PS4, and don't have internet connection right now, but anytime I do, and you have a PS4, I'll take you up on that
---
Sometimes I escape. Sometimes I don't. It was true when they docked with the Spirit. And it's the same now with Legion.
---
I'm just not sure where the goalposts are for the whiners. Do they expect everyone to escape? Do they expect 2 people to escape?
---
If top tier Legions are killing all 4 every trial then there is an actionable pattern. Otherwise it just sounds like 'I don't like getting downed."
---
Hard to tell with no facts.

I died afterwards and kept the toolbox so I assume it was so you got to keep it regardless, but does it have the twice the charges? I've never seen it before in 150 hrs and my friend with 200+ hrs had never seen it before either. Mostly just curious
---
[removed]
---
Oh you must’ve just started using reddit today huh? I see some1 complain that’s he either too strong or too weak, It’s annoying sometimes I agree I can see how it gets boring if you run straight to the killer every game not trying to be an asshole but maybe learn how to juke or loop as a killer main I’ve played as legion and against him enough to know one simple move can lose him 
---
I’m not trying to start a killer tier list argument. I was merely explain why OP thinks Trapper’s power is so weak.
---
I personally am more lethal with Freddy than Trapper, but, whatever.
---
While I agree Boil Over can be one of the best perks in the game if played right (Or if you're on Lery's/Game) most of the time, you just get hooked anyways. By the time the hook auras get obscured, most maps the killer will already be looking straight at it. That's why I want to buff it, even if it's buffed by just a little bit. One of the main reasons I made this, however, is to make a counter to Mori's, so maybe I should've made a whole new perk for that, or added it to a perk that perhaps needed the buff more. *cough* Sole Survivor *cough*
---
He’a listening to Frank’s Mixtape
---
Should have renamed the perks after the levels, would love to see this collaboration
---
The fucking fact is that Legion can hit you once and start a timer on your life and it's literally up to them if you go down or not because all they need to do is turn around and pretend they're Michael Jackson.
---
Yeah she probably ended up escaping on accident, but if she left on her own instead of atleast attempting to save (She was healthy and you didn't have NOED so there was no reason to atleast try.) then she's not the best teammate.
---
Ruin hands down is better but 4 to 5 stacks of lullaby is near impossible.

Now Mommy Huntress would be looking like a snacc

Original: he got out of court, and the parents of the kids he killed chased him down and burned him.
---
Remake: he ran away before he could go to court. parents chased him down, and burned him.
---
[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYqRCk7SfNY) a fan movie about the original movie Freddy's origins.
---
Omg congrats you can correct peoples spelling everyone impressed 
---
The perks are named after 80s songs, but yes, now that you've suggested this I would probably like if they used the chapter's names lol
---
Honestly whenever I use that offering it seems like it makes me spawn closest to the killer
---
He doesn’t even have to run backwards. He can look at the ground while chasing after you and your mend timer will go down.
---
&gt; The other thing is since I main Huntress I have Lullaby at level 3, if I get ruin from the shrine of secrets it’s maxed at level 1 right?
---
No, if you get the teachable Hex Ruin from shrine, then ou'll be able to level it up in the bloodweb just like you did for lullaby and all the other perks. Just a matter of how long it takes to get it in your bloodweb all 3 times.
---
Thanks, it took lots of time and effort. I'm just glad my efforts were worth it.

Same, I played as him for the first time for a few games. I'm in rank 11-9 and I kept getting 4Ks
---
You'll naturally run lullaby until you have a perfect ruin tho
---
If you think killer is overpowered you are simply not good enough at survivor
---
I guess I need to see it. This is the top result on YouTube. We will see if it shows what you mean!  Will advise! https://youtu.be/onnqvEMn9lM
---
I don't see how they are op.
---
10/10 would play as Clown, Wraith or Spirit in MK
---
Altruism, for some reason
---
Just as planned
---
What?
---
Using that offering is a dumb dumb move. Spawning in is an algorithm. It's changed by other factors. "As far away as possible" does not mean the actual farthest point from the killer. And killers tend to cross the map at the beginning, anyway 
---
I guess it's a bug with the Ace perk (but a good one). Don't have Ace so idk but this is pretty weird 
---
Then ask your friend to show you why Legion is overpowered or better yet just watch [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oExzT4O0Ap8)
---
I don't know if it's "ban worthy." 
---
I compare it to snipers who camp in the back of the map on "push the objective" based first person shooters matches. 
---
Do they suck? Absolutely. 
---
Do you want to write them a strongly worded message? Probably. 
---
Should they be banned for being "hyper immersed," self-centered, and incredibly boring? In my opinion, nah. 
---
But just like those snipers, I hope that I get a chance to play against them again, and absolutely obliterate their camping, selfish butts.

Huntress lullaby is lowkey a shit perk. Once survivors see that you have it they will just pay closer attention to the generator and not miss any skill checks. Missing a skill check happens so rarely that its almost a waste of a perk to use it. Combined with the fact that it is a hex perk and it will be cleansed within about a minute, long before you can get it anywhere to full power.
---
Some killers as they spawn go directly to the opposite side of the map 
---
Mindgame? There is no mindgaming legion lmao
---
Hell. No.
---
do i smell hurt feelings?
---
Actually Ruin is pretty easily avoidable by good players if they are good at hitting great skill checks while any player struggles to hit 4 or 5 stacks of lullaby. If you are playing higher ranks run both as they will have a higher chance to hit good skill checks with more stacks of lullaby
---
Trapper is as M1 as it can get without refusing to use your killer ability. You really dont need to even read the description to have an idea of how his ability works.
---
Yeah, I can do that one. I'll ask him next time I get on, but it'll be a little different if I'm the only one he's huntinf
---
Yet in a scenario like that the sniper is at least trying to achieve something. 
---
In the hatch camper case they did nothing to progress the game and were essentially griefing. 
---
Rancor and play with your food work well because they both revolve around, well, saving the obsession for last.
---
That endgame build is pretty terrifying tho
---
Why? :')
---
I hear you. What’s most painful is that I love Legion. Only killer I enjoy playing consistently. But to see them in such a volatile state is worrisome. I want my favorite killer to be healthy because that’s what makes them more fun. Legion just needs something that I don’t know if the game’s mechanics can allow to exist healthily. 
---
Legacy TE/XP says hi.
---
I got a 4k and no gens done my first time playing Freddie. Even got props from the survivors. The next few times I got wrecked.
---
&gt; 100% avoid obvious toxic SWF groups 
---
so basically you just dodge all SWFs then. It's more rare to find a SWF that isn't toxic then one that is. I 100% dodge them as both Survivor and killer until they give us an option to not be match with or against them. 
---
*burns cake offering*
---
I posted this because of those two. Also Kate.
---
Rancor as you can save the obsession till end game then just down them to lose 3 stacks instead of 6 and then kill them there
---
I somehow manage to do consistently decent (at worst) as Freddy, but as soon as I switch to Billy, I get crushed. However, I prestiged Freddy recently, and I don't want to have to play up from a Tier 1 Remember Me. The bloody fingerknives were worth it, though.

I’ll have you know I got to rank 1 in both killer and survivor, I’ve been in contact with the developers, and I have 300 hours in this game. I am trained in the art of 360ing and I’m the top looper in the entire North American server. You are nothing to me but just another killer. I will wipe you the fuck out with toxicity the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my popular Twitch stream and your gamertag is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, any game, any stream and I can teabag you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my left hand. Not only am I extensively trained in real life generator repair, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Ochido discord and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of Dead by Daylight, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” meme was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kid.

BBQ is a perfectly balanced perk. It has *so many counters*
---
whining about it tells me everything I need to know
---
Spirit is not fun :( to play against :(((
---
They don't see scratch marks, have a decreased fov, and have a large blind spot while vaulting, if the survivor is good at the game they can typically avoid them/stall until their frenzy runs out of power. 
---
&gt; more so than survivors.
---
lmfao
---
par for the course delusion from you
---
It's called a full power rework.
---
so you can drop it while the killer is far behind you so they get blinded when they get close.
---
There is only one way to mind game legion, and it isn't looping...
---
It's trying to get Legion to walk into a pallet so you can stun them. If you don't stun them out of frenzy then it's a waste of a pallet though. 
---
I have seen the deepest depths of aftergame chats on PC, I don't think I would ever endorse an aftergame chat screen on console after some of those exchanges that I can never unsee lol.

Trust us, you don't want it.

I can understand. And even on ps4, if you don't have your private messages switched off I know toxic it can be. But not everyone is like that.
---
Thank you for your time (:
---
It takes about 5 minutes to type out what would normally take around 10 seconds on PC due to the PS4's "keyboard". The killer will have already left the lobby by the time it takes you to type out "hey \[username\] want to be friends?"
---
Can i have one?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Because I want to see it myself.

What is Bond like? Do you just see people through walls?

Would make sense, if you had something in return, like with the speed limiter

I don’t think I ever said anything about me being better than you but whatever I tried to help lmaooo you’re the one that got butthurt about my comment first you realize that right? I said something true and you got triggered I’m tired of people like you that complain about shit and then when some1 calls u out with facts you get mad because “I’m always right”

*why is nurse there*
---
The Shape, but you wouldn't have time to feel fear because you'd be pinned to a tree with a large kitchen knife by the time you know he's even there.
---
Tuft of Hair doesn't give you slower movement speed, you might be thinking of Judith's Tombstone. Tuft of Hair gives you the movement speed of EWIII forever after you reach it. The only downside to it is it "tremendously increases the amount of evil required for EWIII", which isn't really that negative along with faster rate of evil gain and also the fact that his stalking glitches out a lot and let's you stalk people you can't even see
---
Which is one reason I got mine so fast, I stalked somebody through a big ass tree when they weren't even visible on my screen
---
Rank reset could explain a bit, but still I don't see much counterplay involved since it gives him faster movement speed forever, much more lunge range forever, and add Enduring, PWYF, STBFL to your loadout, he's goddamn unstoppable
---
People who don't know how to use semi-colons but try to use them anyway to appear smart be like
---
Cuz he monky
---
I got into a game against a legion and I was not given an option to mend myself. Of course, I died because of this ridiculous bug.
---
I find the Trapper's sound hilarious. It's almost like he felt a minor inconvenience but not much more and that's just so ... idk man xD
---
Yes - the last patch made skill checks smooth but nothing else. 
---
Probably Spirit or Myers.
---
Imagine either having a shrieking lady acting distorted and "teleporting" in your face or suddenly noticing a silent guy stalking you in a white mask, tilting his head, who then slowly approaches you to kill you and from whom you can't escape from regardless.
---
Or you're ScottJund and you get ~34 4ks with Speed Limiter (not counting hatch escapes tho)
---
Baja Blast and Code Red flavored perks
---
If chasing a survivor who is clearly going to be able to chase you for a while just say fuck it and stop chasing them.  You'll just waste time, you want to care more about your generators.  
---
Also at the beginning of the match for slower killer's or for trappy killers (trapper, hag, doc) to name a few.  Pick 3 generators that are close together and defend those hard.  The further the last 3 gens are from eachother the easier it is for survivors to get stuff done. 
---
Keep control of the chase, a lot of low ranking/new killers have a hard time forcing the survivors around.  But if you know where there are no pallets or less windows or whatever, you can slowly move to the side of the survivor that is more protected to try and force them in the direction of the weak area.  
---
Darn.
---
In green scrubs at the moment so not winning any awards in stealth unless its the residence probably.
---
*No one liked that*
---
I actually have no idea.
---
You can run any direction where the corner cuts off line of sight.
---
I play survivor and survivors act like trash 10000000000 times more often and worse than any killer ever did. 
---
&gt;it's by far the most broken thing I've seen in it
---
I think Huntress's one-shot hatchets are more OP, especially if it's combined with the +2 hatchet belt add-on so that you have 3 of them. With some aim you can down survivors within seconds of seeing them, at least Myers can *somewhat* be delayed if you find pallets/windows while escaping.
---
It's mostly good by itself, but Rancor is usually a good pair with it. Ignore your obsession all game (but chase if there's one gen left), find them once gates are powered, instadown to only lose 4/3/2 stacks instead of 8/6/4, and mori. Boom, you'll have \~6 stacks provided you used Tier III, for the rest of the game (even if it'll be over soon). Another good suggestion would be STBFL, Ivory Mori, and some kind of instadowning perk. If your obsession is ever Exposed, tunnel them as hard as you can before it wears off. Then you get a hook with less stacks lost. Down them again (preferably when they're Exposed or still injured), Mori them, and enjoy your stacks.
---
Thats kind of the point of the post. If the legion does not make mistakes the survivor can't escape. Killers that aren't the legion or the nurse are forced to chase survivors through loops and other structures that are filled with tools that lets survivors escape without to much effort on their part. The only way the killer can catch them is by trying to mind game/ hope the survivor makes a mistake. Mind games can be countered, and mistakes don't happen if the survivor has a basic idea of how pallet loops work. The killer/the survivor playing against the legion don't get to decide who wins the chase and these issues need to addressed. 
---
Chests would better fit in the Survival category, because unless it's a toolbox or a key, you're not helping survivors get their objectives done (gens/escaping), but rather scavenging something to improve your odds of **survival**. Sure, chests would only give a little bit of points, but it's better than 250 points in one of the categories you can easily farm. (Especially with new Prove Thyself going to buff co-op action BPs)
---
I said it to someone else before, 150% movement speed is a bonus of 50% movement speed. With other words, the movement speed would only be 600%
---
Nah I just don’t like legion because most people tunnel with him.
---
Yet in legions case there are no mind games to be had. A player with a very basic idea of how to play can win every chase as legion regardless of the survivors skill.
---
A pallet looper with basic game knowledge can not do the same to killers of nearly any skill level especially once mind games are considered. 
---
A killer can mindgame a survivor at any pallet/structure in the game which creates a battle of wit and skill where either side can win or lose in any situation. 
---
Legion plays like a nurse without the ability to get juked and with worse map pressure and on average longer chases. 
---
I agree, generators actually doing something instead of reducing a number by one could really make the game more fun. The last map with gens that had a secondary effect was The Game, however, so I don't know if we'll get more generators like that any time soon.
---
I don't know
---
“GG EZ Baby killer” is what she was thinking. 
---
What I didn’t know that, I was looking at all these perks and said to myself “remember they’re limited to level 1” when thinking about which ones I want. Thanks for the info!
---
This makes me smile every time
---
Just posted this 2 days ago lol
---
Oh sorry lol
---
&gt; Survival is easy to max out...just escape  
---
  
---
Although your post is right to some extent, this is just wrong.  
---
Max. points per category are 8k, and escaping grants 5k. You'd need a silly game where you either mend yourself 30!!! times + escape or heal yourself 10 times, which equals 10 chases escaped and that itself is a thing of wonders (well, except against less experienced killers, but then you wouldn't even get hit every single chase to begin with).  
---
From my experience (I've been hitting rank 1 since the first time I played the game 2 years ago if you need to ask) the game currently is killer-sided, but only slightly so.  
---
A balanced state of the game would be a 2-2 score. If survivors are actually "winning" then they win hard and just steamroll the gens and the killer, resulting in silly quick games. Those moments are more memorable, which might sway a player's intuition about the game's balance.  
---
If the killer wins, it's a 3-1 or 4-0 score, which happens more often than not. Even the data provided by the dev streams suggest that. The Game has a survival rate of like ... 10% (again, in my experience). Corn maps are the opposite of that tho.
---
No but don’t do it, we don’t need more toxicity in this game please 
---
What are you talking about? Survivors can't ignore the Killer's mechanics.
---
If you think so then you definitely are not a good Killer and need to watch some [guides](https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ).
---
Just because Survivors have tools to escape the Killer doesn't mean they ignore the Killer's mechanics lmao
---
If a Killer gets looped by a Survivor for 5 gens that's the Killer's fault, not the Survivor. The Killer most definitely had options to end the chase faster but failed to take them.
---
But people dont like legion cuz you dont get to loop him like you would a regular killer. He nullifies windows and pallets and people. Honestly he’s ehh at most unless you run franks mixtape. That takes him from bottom tier to top tier. Other then that he’s just “ boring “ to play against. People just like to complain lol. And I barely play killer 
---
Survivors hate legion because he does generators? 
---
I’d love legion if he did gens. 
---
He's became broken, as you go into frenzy, stab the survivor 2x, then look at the ground and follow the blood/scratch marks which does not initiate chase. Therefore the mend timer goes down and it is nearly impossible to counter
---
Well it all depends, you'd have players stay for after game chat and you would have players leave right away. But the people who want to make more friends would stay around.
---
The Pig is my least favourite to play against because she’s the only one that gives me mini heart attacks when she farts at me out of no where 
---
I was supposed to put dart but put fart read it back and thought ahh whatever 
---
Alt F4 is a pretty good one 
---
How do you run the Haddonfield basement building?
---
Actually, the Adept trophies were back from when pips were based on a hook system (4 kills = double pip), so you have to get a 4k instead of a Merciless Killer rating. I think when I got Adept Trapper, I had a Ruthless Killer rating but I had a 4k, so I received the trophy.
---
Not if the survivor has a basic idea of how to stun the killer and how many loops they can get out of certain pallets? If the survivor gets hit while in the drop animation its probably because they got cocky and tried to squeeze one more loops than they could.
---
While in the drop animation you can get hit, once the pallet blocks the killer you can't, very simple.
---
Obviously someone replied to my question and told me. Why are you rude? Go somewhere else. 
---
NOED is one of the least commonly used perks. But go off survivor mains lmao
---
I love the docs laugh so much
---
300 hours in the game? Did they start playing yesterday?
---
well farming is boring and annoying af.
---
I usually Kill myself if the Killer and survivors want to farm.
---
On the other hand Im killing all farming survivors
---
If you get stuck in the grab animation, try attacking or using your power. Usually, it'll work unless the survivor DC'd as you performed the grab (that gets you stuck for a solid minute or more), and if it was from a gen, they'll stay until the gen gets completed, then they just poof and you can move again.
---
No, but if you do it vs a swf get ready to get bullied 
---
Really good point - convincing
---
Yet these loops are mindgameable.
---
If these loops didn’t exist survivor would be borderline impossible to win as.
---
There exists only a small handful of loops that can’t be mindgamed, not even close to half.
---
There is no way to mindgame a killer that completely ignores the object that you use to mindgame unless their power works in a way such as the nurses, and even then it’s more of a juke than a mindgame.
---
If a survivor does not make a single mistake and plays perfectly at each place they go to they will be able to loop the killer for a long time* 
---
Plz tell me how autoditact is supposed to work. 
---
Put your bloodpoints into, uhh... the **Left Behind I**, since that's MUCH better than total and complete invisibility.
---
Killers: post shit like this 
---
Survivors: tbag and bully killers who do this shit, call them baby killer if they escape
---
Killers: SURVIVOR OP NERF THEM MORE REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE SO TOXIC
---
Not a chance. There are so many ways for a killer to cut that and interrupt you. That wraith just isn't terribly smart.
---
Third seal because you of how easy it is to hit people, Monitor and Abuse because of lower TR, Remember Me because you can hit multiple times, and other standard perks like Ruin or BBQ. 
---
I know people will say to run Thanataphobia, but I wouldn’t. The percentages are way too low for me to warrant a perk slot for it. 
---
Bloodhound is interesting though. You could run it for a moonwalk build, but prepare to be flamed. 
---
I wouldn’t run any perks to do with healing like Sloppy Butcher or Nurses calling because high ranking survivors will just stop healing against legion. They know how easily you can injure them, so they just won’t heal. 
---
So for a build, you’d be looking at 
---
Third Seal
---
Monitor and Abuse
---
Ruin
---
BBQ 
---
That’s a pretty standard build for legion. If you want the whole list, Bricky did a video explaining why little to no perks work on legion, so I’d suggest watching that. 
---
Really helpful guide. Thanks
---
Oh yea, forgot about that. Can't let that chance go away with a prestige
---
Feels good to out mind-game a good nurse.
---
Just use Frank's mixtape and you can 4k every game with no perks. 
---
Resume running if she stands still. Don’t use the pallet.
---
I agree with you, and it's awful to play against. But to some degree, it does make sense
---
If you were to prestige without taking that Left Behind I, you'd be more stupid than I was when I hopped into lockers with a black-ward Myers when he only had green add-ons.
---
Heh
---
Yeah, Dwight is definitely easier to put into that bullied position most of the time too simply because of how he looks.
---
Did he get drunk in his lore? I forgot the details of that very brief story, but I thought he just wandered in the woods one day and got lost?
---
moonwalkers disagree
---
Move out of brazil
---
The Nurse.
---
Hearing her screams and seeing a Ghost just tp in Front of you

---
or hes incredibly unfun to play against, moreso than any other killer
---
Its amazing, but nowhere near as good as Prayer Beads or especially Frank's Mixtape 
---
I think he was on a business trip or something, and his boss gave him moonshine, and since he's a wimp he just passed out, and when he woke up there was a giant man with a smiling mask and a bear-trap in his hand chasing him.
---
But I need to be a P3 Claudette to sandbag my teammates to use it!
---
Eh, looks like baloney to me.
---
Also would it kill Rin to put on some actual clothes?
---
Nerd 
---
It’s pretty good by itself. I’d run it with M1 killers like Freddy or Wraith since it saves time in the chase. 
---
True
---
Survivors have more downtime where all you’re doing is a gen, killers don’t 
---
Holy shit, dude, you're a genius. To be fair, let's also remove the killer's weapons, because all they do is cause damage to survivors, they don't benefit survivors in any way.
---
If you're playing Killer: Hag for Ruin, LeatherFace for BBQ, Spirit cause she's a great killer to play as.
---
If you're playing Survivor: Laurie Strode for DS, Jeff Johansen for his Black Metal cosmetic. Adam for Deliverance. 
---
I checked everything and nothing seems to work, onyl happens with this game too :(
---
claudettes watch out he has a tombstone! oh god oh fuck they cant hear us they have Airpods ™️ in oh god oh f*ck
---
Eh, look down or up, problem solved. 
---
Put a fan on it. It does heat up and sound like a jet engine when I start mine up but never shuts off like you said yours did. 
---
gotta learn how to hit skill checks and hold the repair button with one hand 😂
---
“Last word,” 
---
Nah fam you got nearly all the words lmao.
---
Can’t even report him sadly.
---
Best not interact with those kinds of people at all. Stop the toxicity at the source and not let some of it run with you next game. 
---
Love it
---
The first time I played freddy with a splinter (first actual time, the first time i ever used one i got a glitch that made it game-breaking), I got a 3K and I gave last man hatch. However, whenever I used glass or bone splinters I did terrible, and I almost never got black splinters.
---
I didn't mention Billy either, who is also top tier. 
---
A good Nurse invalidates everything a survivor can do, she literally has no counterplay other than just not be seen. 
---
A good Spirit is just annoying. She has counterplay but that doesn't make her fun
---
Clown is fine design wise, but in my experience most Clown players are assholes who camp or tunnel anyone they hook ;_;
---
Ah sorry man, I came from r/pewdiepiesubmissions and I was just a lil heated, yer good
---
&gt; We were at Springwood 
---
That map seems to bring out the immersive side in people, I swear.
---
I disagree, love this map.
---
When it came out, it looked different then all the other maps too, which was great.
---
Adept killer trophies are pretty broken, atleast the survivor ones are good boys and just take into calculation "Escape? You get trophy. Die? No trophy."
---
lmao
---
Bad killers. Straight up.
---
Delete the game and then download it again?
---
What a noob; I play 300 hours every day!
---
https://youtu.be/kx1kveUU81w

He seems to be having fun...but he is also entertaining  his viewers, I guess you could say fun is subjective, I can have a fun time doing the same thing with  if I play survivor or killer.  
---
&gt; I´m still learning English
---
Your English is fucking better than mine lol
---
Im so lost, what's everyone's problem with the.legion killer?
---
I hardly ever play against him enough to know. The time I did he magically knew what locker i was at. After being there for a cool while and there were other lockers around. 
---
I forgot to mention that this was in KYF.
---
*Highschool English Class flashbacks intensify*
---
Nurse is a sniper. Its hard to hit, useless if you miss, but if you do, its killer. Best defense: dont get seen
---
Shouldn’t be getting downvoted, these types of posts are getting annoying
---
They put more effort into their meme then you. 
---
When I play nurse, I just blink at the corner. If they double back, hit without using second blink. Otherwise, hit using the second blink.
---
Isn’t that weird? Xbox has more overall toxicity but ps4 dbd has more than cod.
---
I knew it had to be that mo fugga before I even clicked the link. Oh Officer Leathercock how the world loves you
---
I'd also like some kind of alternate to the exit gates on some maps, like maybe a castle where powering all the gens opens a drawbridge that allows you to leave the castle. Maybe that wouldn't be the best example since the killer could just NOED-camp the drawbridge and get ez 4k unless a survivor has a key. Also, things like Remember Me and Blood Warden would be affected by that, so probably no changes to the exit gates until that can be worked around.
---
The biggest thing to avoid getting called a tunneler (or really anything else toxic) is giving survivors the illusion that they had a chance, even when you 4Man-4Gen.
---
I usually switch targets to a healthy survivor when given the chance, even if I'm chasing an injured one and will go after a second survivor near me if I've just downed one, over picking him up. 
---
I usually don't get called a tunneler when I do this but YEMV.
---
Take note that bamboozle doesn’t block pallets
---
Yes you can get banned from it. Your messing with the games files. Will you get caught maybe not. Is that a chance you want to take? 
---
Yeah that would be terrifying, and by the time he starts chasing you he's ~~at evil within III~~ too close and you get stabby stabbied
---
Good to see humanity in people
---
Yeah because in red ranks it’s rare to find a match
---
There‘s nothing you can do against Legion. There is no mindgames, there isn‘t even real gameplay. 
---
The lad(s) are braindead af. Slam the right addons on and you got a killer on par with a peaking nurse while requiring absolutely no effort.
---
Don’t forget NOED and DS 
---
Really? When did skins start getting add-ons built in?
---
She’s the least favorite for me because she seems to be the only killer I play against,I swear 70% of my games are pigs and I’m not sure if that applies to just me.
---
console is it's own nightmare.
---
If I could, I would give this gold
---
The nurse because I can’t even use doors to escape since she can teleport through them
---
It’s just a word idk why people get butthurt over that kinda stuff you know? 
---
Could have been an accidental cue up
---
Let me guess... Were you the guy that was downed? 😂
---
32 METERS. WHAT. A MEASLY 100 BPS. ALL CAPS. Lower those numbers dude. How long do you think a chase lasts? I would lose 4000bps for doing my job near a survivor. Make that number at most 16 meters and proximity amplified.
---
I was actually writing the same thing a few days ago o_O, but I wanted to do it for all four categories and suggest some ideas to fix that. Here’s what I wrote on Survival:
---
You basically can not get max points for Survival if you’re not farming with a friendly killer. You get points for:
---
* Escaping (5K).
---
* Wiggling out (1K).
---
* Self unhooking (1.5K).
---
* Self-healing (250).
---
* Struggling (up to ~900).
---
Even if you manage to escape, you’d need 3000 more points. These are the ways to get max:
---
* 12 self-heals.
---
* 3 wiggles out.
---
* Self unhook and 6 self-heals.
---
* Self unhook, wiggle out and 2 self-heals.
---
* Self unhook, wiggle out and 20% of time left on hook.
---
* etc.
---
As you can see, all these variants are quite unlikely to happen: the chance to self-unhook is just 4% (11.5264% to summarize), you rarely get a chance to wiggle out yourself (since flashlight and pallet saves do not count) for more than one time in a row and chances of you getting hit for so many times and then abandoned by killer (so you can heal) are quite low too.
---
Let’s imagine you run Deliverance, this makes it so you can surely get 1500 points. Ways to get 1500 more are:
---
* 6 self-heals.
---
* 1 wiggle out and 2 self-heals.
---
* 1 wiggle out and 20% time left on hook.
---
* 20% time left on hook and 4 self-heals.
---
Even purple medkit with addons to make it last longer can’t guarantee you 6 self-heals, and even if you use self-heal perk, most killers can’t lose you for six times in one match.
---
Wiggles out happen pretty rarely unless you run decisive strike (at this point it’s up to your skill, so let’s imagine you’re very good at skill checks and may hit this one.
---
This way you still need 500 more points that you can get by:
---
* 2 self-heals.
---
* 20% time left on hook.
---
While the second one is rare to happen (why would the killer not Mori you after DS and Deliverance) because you usually get insta saved on high ranks, so you need to self-heal two times. That’s much more possible yet you still need to bring a medkit better than the brown one or run self-heal.
---
Sound like you can finally get max in Survival, yep? Yes, but that makes you lose 2 perk slots and item slot or even 3 perk slots if you decide to heal with a perk. Quite a big deal for one category maxed up, right? 
---
A good survivor will not fall for the bait
---
No, I am talking about TheLegendarySwift. Marth88 and all other popular killer mains don't even come close to the man himself. He was practically what made nurse so scary and absolutely broken. If you were playing in 2016 you would understand.
---
[this is what it came from](https://youtu.be/1iHRrW5KTbw) 
---
Oh I’m not taking sides m8 I just visit this sub for the hilarious shitposts
---
If your legion and you are not doing gens then why play legion at all 
---
This. I‘m a killer main and said right from the get go that Legion‘s design is flawed. They‘re also impossible to balance without a full rework. 
---
There is nothing you can do against them. Not a single mindgame. The early „he‘s freddy tier“ calls came because he was really really slow at downing - this is fixed by the latest patch and the right addons. Legion is inescapable. 
---
Drop wake up or run adrenaline with it. Urban is good, decisive shank, iron, unbreakabill, sprint, ect are all good as well.
---
Any specific type of build your going for?
---
Just like the simulations
---
From a survivor main I am sorry some of us are like tbis
---
You don’t have to take sides idc if the whole world is against me I just hate when people ignore facts and just talk shit 
---
Actually, moth-man would be terrifying tbch 
---
I just made this...
---
https://discord.gg/deadbydaylight
---
Oh shit. Yeah you added the characters head and sounds. Sorry.
---
This is so sad can we buff survivors 
---
I feel the Legion is a bit over hated. Seriously, not a bad killer--in fact an ingenious concept. 
---
So make sure your not idle on the startup screen.(Not the main menu,the screen where you press x,a,etc. to get into the game)the ps4 gets craazzzy hot when you leave it on there 
---
This has to be the most accurate scenario for a new survivor to see the killer just sitting there... staring at them from a distance.
---
No moonwalkers allowed in my comment section
---
This meme was made by legion players with a brain
---
*Grabs toxic waste bucket from front pocket.”
---
#NOOO
---
For some reason the face looks angry now.
---
nothing, i just assumed only children would act like that
---
Yeah cause you poured toxic waste on him for playing legion
---
Clowns mori is disgusting and I just can't with it. Don't you get more points from a disconnect anyways. More than a mori.
---
It's just another think salty survivors are gonna call you. Oh I hook this person and saw scratch marks so I looked around for the alt-happy teammate. I must be camping. Oh you got an unhook and left your teammate behind to waddle around the wrong direction? I must be tunneling that guy. 8/10 games a get survivors who are just asshats so just ignore them and play how you feel is fun.
---
I don’t think that’s it.
---
OH. BABY. 
---
60,000 Bloodpoints? THANK YOU CITIZEN 
---
NOW DIE
---
But I *did*
---
New killer confirmed to be this man
---
By looking at the ground, sky or anything that’s not the survivor after you apply Deep Wounds, their Mend timer ticks down because they aren’t technically in a chase, but you just follow the blood with either steps or bloodhound/Predator and wait for the timer to tick down. By following the blood trial, the survivor can’t escape your threat range and they can’t mend or else they go down to a normal hit/have to let go and go down anyway. 
---
Yeah. Probably should stop pouring this toxic waste on this teenager.
---
Best part? I've done that exact thing. DADDY MYERS IN DA HAUS
---
It wouldn't kill Rin it would kill her thirsty fanboys

---
why the fuck is every insult online a homophobic slur 
---
oh you poor survivors, now you have to just leave the game instead of bming the shit out of survivors when the gates are open.
---
Yes please
---
SUCK IT
---
Not truly. I'm just looking for something. Lol.
---
And when you do it's ultra rare you find good team mates if you decide to solo queue.
---
Then that nurse wasn’t very good. That’s the issue with nurse. Even a mediocre one can easily snowball the game for a win just by virtue of how little time you gain even for a great juke. 
---
Then you get hit from a uncharged back slap. 
---
There *are* mind games, but they're really obvious to any Legion player who's actually good at the game. When Legion vaults a pallet you can run to one side of the pallet then run to the other side as he finishes it. He'll think you're going to vault it and quick 180 swing. It's like the classic pallet juke where you do a 180 after they break a pallet but this time it's on the vault. The other one is the classic window juke.
---
The thing is, they all rely on the Legion player being bad.
---
Also his slow down time is fixed by moonwalking and looking at the ground. (Preferably with Bloodhound). Nothing the Survivor can do. No jukes, no mind games, nothing. Or you can just use Frank's Mixtape and down people in 3 inescapable hits. Fun!
---
Any Killer that ignores game mechanics is going to be outright broken in some aspect. Legion is just the Nurse without map pressure so you'll get gen rushed hard. That's his *only* weakness.
---
Being gen rushed sucks, but I don't understand how it's toxic. It's the survivors getting the objective done in a quick and efficient manner. They're supposed to get the objective. I believe this is more the fault of the game design than the survivors being toxic. Tunneling's only annoying when a person was just pulled off the damn hook.  
---
Is there anyway for nurse to be decent on ps4?
---
Maybe, but it would still be useless until dedicated servers come around next summer and the chat can be hosted by the server, instead of the killer.
---
Deep Wound allows you to see nearby survivors auras if you hit someone with it if I recall correctly
---
TIME TO DIE, PAL

https://clips.twitch.tv/SplendidIronicEggWholeWheat Bugged hatch
---
More like a self resenting closet homosexual who can't come to terms with his own sexuality. 
---
But, hey, he won. He got the last word.
---
People don’t hate him because he’s weak. People hate him because he has no counterplay and is by far the most addon reliant killer in the game
---
I thought so aswell, but I looked closely at the original clip and there i can see him wiggle. :)
---
Holy shit that’s AWESOME. So jealous!
---
Oh nice it sucks when you try to save fellow survivors and you fail or even worse they waste the save
---
Jason. I want to see Jason. I never was a fan of horror or any slasher movie, they never caught my attention cause I was too much of a coward to watch them. It was in October last year  that I finally started being interested in them and it was thank to Friday The 13th The game. By playing the game I started to have a big interest in the Slasher genre, especially Jason. I read up on the lore in the wiki and talked to my friends to plan a movie marathon to watch The Friday the 13th movies( we also played the game together and it was so much fun). To me, Jason opened the door to a new genre of movies and games and he's my favorite from that genre. Sadly, F13 game doesn't appear like it may have the support it needs and after playing it for a couple of months it starts to feel stale so I'm hoping that the developers from Dead by Daylight can pay for the rights to get Jason as the 13th killer of the game.  
---
Yes, he has to be the 13th killer, so I'm hoping he gets released this Autumn. Finger's crossed and praying to mama Voorhees to let her son kill me in DbD.
---
For toxic players, you’re right, there is not much of anything that can be done, especially for those whom have this sort of behavior become ingrained into their play style.  But the new players, and some players whom have been led to believe that toxic behavior is the only way to play, this is the sort of thing that could get them to stop before it becomes all that they know.  
---
As regards to balance, absolutely there is not really a way to balance this sort of game, but I know that certain behaviors discourage other players from playing.  For example, my family and friends were eager to play SWF when we all got the game for free through PSN last year.  But after a few days of repeatedly playing games with camping killers, they dropped out, refused to touch it since.  The only balance I’m looking for, is the kind that people want to stick around, even if they lose.
---
so, you used only the 3 unique perks, got 4kill, and didn't receive it? Sounds like a support ticket worthy event to me. 
---
The Doctor.
---
Autodickdickdick is shit.
---
OK I will check her out thank you
---
Oh god, oh fuck
---
SWF Top rank Claudette purposely bringing the killer to me and unhooking me in front him so he could keep downing me and hooking me...I play both sides and so far survivors are the most toxic and bitter. People waiting to let you bleed out to hatch or 3 other survivors just fucking off and not doing any generators...I get 3 gens done and that’s it...I get chased by the killer for 2+ min, get hooked, and left for dead while everyone else is just hiding in a corner when they could have done the 2 gens and gates to at least get themselves out but I guess they all wanted hatch.
---
Beautiful side mission to those survivors that disconnect before the match begins after seeing my survivor pudding offering...10 times in a night...scumbags.
---
Weirdest thing I’ve ever seen(happened last night) is 3 people body block a hook and I down one and injure the other two...Guy I’m carrying gets away but I hook the other one I downed and end up downing the other 3 in half a minute because they keep trying to poorly distract me. One even escaped off the hook by himself but I’m playing hag for my ritual so my trap I placed in front of his hook went off and I instadown him and rehook in the span of 5 seconds.
---
Can we get an F in the comments for legion?
---
never really heard of it
---
Myers is unkillable. He would be the winner.
---
Myers is unkillable, according to the original Halloween lore. 
---
A killer who requires specific perks to counter is a poorly designed killer. 
---
Thanks for the info, not gonna risk the ban. 
---
F

Nice

Repost

More r3alistic than the other way around.....

DS and Adrenaline are bigger problems imo

Giant concur

*HEAVY SIGHS*

Time to move to korea 
---
Wanting and doing are two different things. They're SO slow to react to simple changes. Just figure something out, a 5-10% increase in the shard cap each time you gain a devotion? It doesn't have to be the be-all, end-all solution. I've been around since the game came out. Their dev team is terrible at stuff like this
---
While I do agree that Nurse needs a small change to make her less dominant, I actually disagree with your first sentence. We get frustrated because we tend to play very individually rather than as a team, so since all the survivors run similar perks, the nurse just capitalizes on the homogenous build of the team.
---
I've seen a couple on the bright side the matches last like 5 minutes. 
---
Welcome to the salt mines. Everything here is made of salt. People hate him cause he’s different and he won’t get the heat off until a new killer is released. 
---
I want one please 😊😊😊😊
---
Not worth it at all lol.
---
The exact same thing happens to me a good 8 out of 10 times I start DBD. 
---
Sounds like my PS4 is gonna explode for ten seconds on start screen then it chills afterwards 😂
---
It only happens with this game.
---
When the hatchet is a sphere and the player is a cylinder you see some fucked up hits
---
Shut the fuck up about this already. People bitch about it because it's not even remotely fun to play against.
---
Go all the way to the right then go back to the emblem screen. This will fix it.
---
I'm playing on pc through steam.
---
 
---
I think hooks respawn every three minutes?
---
Laaawwwdddd yes 👅 
---
i was kidding. nobody gives a shit what you wear.
---
Welp, I think it's broke.
---
When I'm solo queuing I always run DS + unbreakable. That way the killer is damned if they do, damned if they dont.
---
it just cuts the amount of time you have to moonwalk for
---
I agree on your opinion however, I’m sure I’ll get hate for this but it becomes annoying when you strategically outplay the killer the entire game just to get downed when the gates are powered is kinda frustrating. I play both surv and killer so I’ve been on both ends so I get the point but again it is frustrating to outplay a killer the entire game just to have something unfortunate it feels like the killer really doesn’t deserve that kill. 
---
I had a streamer as a killer and after game on ps4 he messed my friend trash talking saying we sucked and he let us go and showed us the ruin and all kind of lies. He camped a dude at the end so he was defiantly trying and was sorta a ass like shacking his head at me when he knocked me down and etc. I did have a good talk with one Myers guy though as a Myers main myself as he was trying to do spooky Myers but could not get us
---
Nice game btw
---
I took a few months break from this game but have been getting the itch to play again. When I q as killer it takes FOREVER to get a game lobby, is this just the norm now? I used to find full lobbies as a killer in under a minute and now it takes up to 10. Am I having a server error (as I last played when killers were the host) or is this just how it is nowadays?
---
yet when I'm on ps4 and say "fuck" I get told off by Sony wtf
---
ive always wondered how bad at the game you have to be to be in this position and... lose
---
To be fair, if it's happened to you, you know what they're talking about. It's pretend to be patrolling when in actuality you're just staring at the hook in a very small perimeter. But I guess killers have different standards than survivors for what they think is camping too? Idk, i play both, i just find the point kind of moot. 
---
For legion 360 them in corn. To short to find you after
---
i dont get it
---
Start a GoFundMe, we'll get 10% of Killer mains to the promise land.
---
Weird, cause I get dodged a lot for it
---
Don't understand why this was downvoted to oblivion. It's a question, but ok werk.
---
Are u serious about pallets? Wtf i swore I've dropped a pallet on him before and worked. And I've seen him vault over windows quickly i might add so it doesn't slow him down! 
---
Thats so broken. This is like everytime ow adds a new hero with broken stats and mechanics and Devs be like "yeah that's fine," 
---
And every time he gets pallet stunned, he goes "Nyarn\~"
---
Was looking to see if this had been posted yet. It confirmed a few of my strats and taught me how to handle shack. I used to be one of the triple vaulting killers :S
---
Until bunny is out we only have blue hair feng

I wanna say first that sometimes when I run into an incredibly toxic swf teams, I mean like above average toxicity, the next match I'll (on occasion) equip the most OP addons/perks I can and punish the fuck out of the next swf team I see. Sometimes even the very next round after. I'm not proud of it, but toxic swf happen so often I just lose my shit. I generally just leave the lobby when I see an obvious swf team because even if their nice, 9/10 they are fucking asshole teabaggers that will bitch if Devs even hint at balancing the game in the killers favor just a little bit, despite the overwhelming advantage that just comms alone gives the survivors
---
Anyway, I was playing the clown a few weeks ago. Ran into a swf team. Every hook I tried to make they would body block and flashlight blind. At least if it wasn't sabotaged. I didn't hook one person, aside from the endgame, because the moment I downed someone they would all be there teabagging and blocking the hook. Any second I was chasing was spent doing gens until I downed someone. Then when the exit gates opened everyone had adrenaline or whatever so they just pop back up and go. They all refused to go through the exits despite them both being opened and spent so long just teabagging and blinding me with flashlights over and over again.  Whoever played Jake park, this "lycan lord" something or whatever his name, was an extra douche. Everything had to be a flashlight click amd teabag and the next time I run into him I'm slugging that SOB and letting him bleedout. I don't care if everyone else escapes. Fuck them all, but especially fuck that guy. He deserves everything coming to him
---
phillip is fun but amanda isn't? 
---
legion isn't fun but Anna is? 
---
sorry but i honestly disagree with you
---
youre kidding me
---
So how are you going to keep making 300 shards without infinite levels, then? Eventually you'll hit the level cap and stop getting anything. You can't not care about devotion AND want to keep getting shards, the later is only possible *because* of the former. No devotion, no shards.
---
Instead of doing things alone you should point the killer to follow you and send it on the way of the camping survivor. Even if you dont get out no reason to get the useless survivor a free escape
---

---
Lol claiming copyright of a meme
---
When the character is so boring you call them "meh"
---
no
---
Like I've already said, it could be as simple as increasing the cap each devotion level a certain percentage. Or like I also already said, it could be as simple as making it optional to level your devotion and just keep whatever you're content on making. Forcing the reset doesn't make sense.

No ebony mori 1/10

Dwight's shirt and tie are similar to leatherface's funnily enough 
---
They gave a lot of exclusive DLC for free in one of the updates.
---
Wat do.
---
I understand peoples' feeling toward the killer and its design, but I don't think that means the player should get toxic messages or people should condescend the OP like that. 
---
The very few times i played against him he didn't chase me much, he focused on other players and. I always escaped, so I really can't say much.
---
Now i want to go play and see if it's justified or not
---
Although i did read about him ignoring pallets. So that's a no bueno ror me. That's stupid. 
---
I feel rank 10-4 is where the most toxic survivors are while playing killer
---
I actually main Meh, since they have Sprint Bleh.
---
ACKCHTUALLY, DS IS VERY OP IT HAS NO COUNTER :,(
---
Made me choke on calamari 10/10
---
You can still stun him with pallets but he can also vault over them. Due to his massive speed boost during frenzy its incredibly hard to bait out the stun, though. If you do it too late he will still hit you but too early and he vaults it.
---
Claudeet isn't bad either, self hoe is annoying though
---
yes I have, I play mostly killer and I rotate through them (Except nurse, motion sickness), in red ranks and even against people with like 4k+ hours, the only time I have visibility issues is in the farm maps and even then legion just trucks through it all and doesn't give a shit.
---
look mom i drew the people i dont like in an unflattering manner i won the internet argument
---
How do I delete someone else's comment?
---
Can confirm, this glitch happened to me (I was a survivor who didn't DC) and it made the fact that someone had DC'd and I was about to go down (Since I always get rekt by spirits) just a little bit better
---
The excitement from you is what really makes it magical. 
---
that really hit a nerve didnt it
---
When you make a shitty meme fishing for upvotes and it fails miserably 
---
Hook respawn after 3 minutes and respawn times are affected by the perk Sabotuer and Hangmans Trick
---
Yeah it really needs changing
---
As soon as he finished everything opened
---
Maybe if the killer stays too close to the hook the progression bar go down slowly or simply stops.
---
This. Chasing is literally the only thing he's good at. Neuter that and he's reduced to shit.
---
Survivor- *escapes once
---
Entity- *ANGRY BELLS, CHAINSAWS, SWORDS, AND BEAR TRAPS!!!
---
*CONFUSED SCREAMING
---
Marth88 but he doesn't really play anymore.
---
Also I'm going to cry if someone else says Ardetha. 
---
when he calls u a queer just say Yes ez u win the argument
---
He's not THAT good. Also he didn't even stop using Ruin on Nurse that long ago so that says a lot in itself.
---
he is playing right now or did you say that for the nurse?
---
compared to others i’ve seen he isnt the best lol
---
*after getting raped up the ass three times in a row and being sacrificed* well at least it was hard for the nurse to do so Reddit says i should be cool with it
---
About Nurse yeah
---
You already convinced me. Say no more, neighbor.
---
If you want to just heal fast, use We’ll Make It. Autodidact isn’t the best perk but when you’re against some heavy heal reduction speed, it’s downright sexy. 
---
MEME PERKS LIKE AGITATION. Nurse doesn't need perks so the perks you run doesn't matter
---
The struggle is fuckin real. 
---
Wym? 
---
hey you need to report him to sony for harassment! 
---
do you record your games by having a phone or something pointed at the screen? you realise ps4 has a video clip saver feature right?
---
Nah, I get what you're saying. I guess my point is that it's a weird "prestige" system with no extra benefit no matter how many times you level. Most games with prestige systems have some sort of incentive for your time investment, besides just doing it all over again with no extra benefit. From the way I see it, I just went from making 300 shards one game to 50 the next. And I don't play a ton, so now I've gotta grind away again just because I broke the peak. Life goes on I suppose. Thus the rant / salt flair
---
I didn't really intend for it to be a meme, more of a way to say something without writing blocks of text
---
Pf this is pretty lame, this person has a serious lack of education. 
---
I'm sorry for you man and I'm a survivor main but I hate to read this, that's why I'm always on the side of the killer when I see this happening. There is a limit to not cross, and people get so disrespectful in this game... I'm always amazed to see how small their brain can be. :(
---
Idk how to upload to reddit from ps4
---
Claudette took the fucking kids man
---
Allow me to just chip in here real quick.
---
That is the worst possible mentality I have ever seen regarding balance in not just this game, but probably any game ever.
---
If something has a higher difficulty to play then alternatives, sure anyone would expect it to be stronger then the easier alternatives. Otherwise unless you just enjoy the play style of the harder thing you got no incentive to play it.
---
Problem is that in all honesty, Nurse really isn't too difficult to get to the point of fairly consistent 4k games and that's WITHOUT add-ons. I believe for me when I was getting into playing killer months back I was really only going with Huntress, Myers with Doctor to point farm and occasionally I would play Hillbilly though that was just to have fun and charge across the map. I decided why not try to climb ranks quickly so went to Nurse. It took me I think 3 or 4 games at most to figure her out at the time and it was consistent 4k games all within minutes of a match starting.
---
Nurse should be powerful, she's I believe undoubtedly the most difficult killer to play and she deserves to be the strongest killer for that reason. However it's not healthy game design nor is it fun as the survivors to have a killer who just outright ignores a large majority of the game mechanics leaving the only remaining "counter play" to be that the Nurse player is bad themselves.
---
Long story short: No being a tricky or difficult killer should NOT be translated to keeping something the undeniable best thing in the game, especially when you consider how it's no more then a couple of matches to get your skill on said killer to a point of consistent 4k games.
---
Also bonus point: Doesn't help that as it currently stands and decent killer player should be able to get 4k games very consistently mostly regardless of killer because of how many global buffs and nerfs have gone to killers and survivors. Add that onto the fact that Nurse in this case has ALWAYS been able to get consistent 4k games with a bit of skill and it makes it easier than ever.
---
He is the chosen one

Red Forest: Mother's Dwelling. One person disconnected from the match 3 seconds into the game. Turns out it was Legion. I wonder if he's friendly- I spam enter/exit closets, then point to the generator. The Legion froze, then glares at me with his cold eyes. From there I knew what must be done.
---
Did you get a 2 pip or just a 4k? You need to earn enough emblems to double pip, which is possible with a mori but much more difficult.  It helps to have lots hooks, and go for as many points as possible.  You don't even have to kill everyone to get a double pip.
---
I really don't see a need for this. Elaborate a bit more please. 
---
I mean, is there really a reason for this though? I see no reason to have this whatsoever. 
---
Well Angry Pug may be about to meet Angry Dad.
---
No way that many people smoke and play dbd, but shit I do so who knows?
---
You know good players would make BANK on that shit. :D
---
Other than zubat name another streamer thats better
---
Instant orgasm
---
Why don’t they like nurse is she too broken
---
Nice shot.
---
I'm horrible as Huntress.
---
Weee wooo
---
I get your point but I still think it would take away from the fun of finding them on your own. 
---
the meme is strong with this one
---
Yep. Even in my darkest times as survivor or killer I just play it through. Everyone wins in the end when the game is played the right way. If u DC, nobody wins
---
pretty sure it's all coincidental; unless you know thats the very last totem and the killer is running NOED.
---
It would still help if you're a Killer and tend to get looped a lot. There would also be Add-ons that make the Skill Check tremenously hard, which would be an Ultra Rare
---
This wouldn't stop you from doing so, it would just give players more options.
---
What are you talking about? He was obviously repairing a tiny gen.^/s
---
This is true but there’s still undoubtedly better players on average in red rank than any other rank
---
I don't know. But it's just nice to scream at someone to get your rage out, if they understand it or not.
---
alexa play halloween theme 
---
Play a little or a lot, rate gain is still similar regardless of level. There's no more grind at level 5 than there is at 80. It's not a prestige system, it's just a turn over so you can keep getting levels/shards.
---
True is close to as good as ardetha man.like legit watch both of them play. Ardetha gets more 4-5 gens 4ks with nurse than true. He's just much more accurate
---
He's IS good but nowhere near as good as Marth.
---
I have yet to play against a single clown. I'd be interested in actual killer choice stats.
---
I'd agree with this. Red rank typically = more experience. 
---
Easy just need fire up
---
Cool, glad you think so. 
---
if you're already on the hook why would you struggle harder? it just gives you more points
---
Fire up nurse op
---
To be fair I got a lot of downs from survivors self-caring at pallets thinking I won't lunge.
---
The issue I see is burning through level ups
---
I searched Survivor for 3 times- waited 10 mins each. Nothing.
---
Searched Killer and got a match instantly. There's no way there's a mass Killer shortage, right?
---
Okay, but where is Doctor? 
---
Idk man I think that myers one where you have to get a 4k with the 2 iridescent add ons
---
Well fuck me, I fucked myself over
---
How the hell did you break the 64 bit limit wth
---
Legion is balanced!
---
Just play Doc 4head
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks I'm a motorcycle when playing Billy. XD
---
Omg I thought that too when I first started playing her :D and this art makes her look so pretty omg!
---
You have a physical map as decoration?
---
Thank u, I love legion tbh, I can quickly get into the action and with me being able to stab four butts in one frenzy feels really good
---
You are braindead, but all Ardetha fanboys are
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/RespectfulYawningButterBleedPurple
---
Yeah because the nurse is a bundle of joy to play against lol
---
Yea, come to rank 1 on PC, and enjoy your stay against slugging nurses, who basically reads your mind when it comes to chases, when tell me she is more fun to play against than legion, when she blinks from the other side of the map in 0.5s flat to exactly where you are, hits you and when hits you again, no matter what you do, because she have 4-5 blinks.
---
omg whos that on the left next to freddy
---
Is that a problem?
---
No clue mate
---
Well at first i keep asking myself why he didn't use the speed he used when holding a chainsaw in a normal chase. XD
---
Lol, you can't prove marth is better. Why do you hate ardetha so much? Calling me braindead is just proving you have nothing but insults
---
Would love one can give you a purple key for it 😋
---
Yeah just gotta keep going through the bloodwebs and you can get level 3 of every perk on any killer/survivor
---
Black dude is me minding my business so I could do gens.
---
doc’s power doesn’t encourage tunneling and moonwalking 
---
Nice! That's one more achievement to scratch off the list
---
She’s amazing on PC...enjoy! Even the first time I tried her it was hilarious bouncing around and figuring it out but once you do...god damn is she good.
---
It’s a wet dream! 
---
Yup! I’m so close to a platinum. :))) 
---
Just have Adept nurse and adept hag to do. There’s also the nurse’s 100 blink hit or whatever, but that seems easy to do. 
---
It's 50-50 for me. Either you spawn next to or survivor. You can sprint directly to it, it gets cleansed anyway.
---
in life
---
You can always reinstall your game if you're worried about it. 
---
Do you think you can ask the person who made this to make them have an ultra rare background like in the past?
---
gets pulled in a dream and dies cause she can't use her realm power in Dream World :D
---
then it wasn't a good nurse.  Just not a bad one.
---
You use YouTube
---
Well at least it's not 28 stab wounds.
---
It is the strangest thing in the DBD community that there is a social etiquette that makes using certain strategies "rude".
---
But, to me, the wildest thing is that people expect the killer to let them take the hatch. I'm talking just let them straight up walk up to it. No chasing. No hitting. Oh, congrats. I killed all your friends...
---
Why?? How is that even a fun win?
---
Patchy? We want the Flying Dutchman!
---
Yeah, I got called a tunneler earlier by someone who I hooked once and they killed themselves on hook. Like?? I'm sorry?? Was I supposed to stop chasing you mid-chase? Or, sorry, *mid-tunnel*. lmao
---
People throw around tunnel and camp a lot, but nine times out of ten it's just a salty survivor who lost. I wouldn't take it personally. There's no honor code you have to follow, despite what survivors like to pretend. Do whatever secures those kills!
---
Plus with Freddy specifically, it's usually works well to camp hook/tunnel. Gets more people in the dream state.
---
Well there is a difference between taking skill out completely, and having the highest skill curve in the game
---
I do this, but I also run borrowed time and deliverance.... Am I bad?
---
He may not be top-tier, but I find his bottles so fun to aim. Screw Huntress' hatchets, I miss those 90% of the time anyways. Screw Doc's shock, they always vault a window before the shock hits anyways. Screw P E B B L E, Killers never fall for it. Clown has the best projectiles!
---
He sent you hate mail because you didn't rescue him? Ffs
---
_Fun_
---
on a jpeg of clownman
---
And brutal strength
---
#WEE WOO WEE WOO
---
Nope just a question
---
Then yes. Yes I do have a map as a decoration
---
Borderline impossible against a decent killer unless your playing as invisi Claudette’s on cold wind with murkys. 
---
dang dude ur so good youre killing a default jake with 1 perk
---
😕 what’s that mean I’m a nea main
---
I just can't with it? What are you a high school cheerleader?

How old is your PS4?
---
Can I ask why Moniter and Abuse? Is that good on pig?
---
This... makes so much sense. He's using the chainsaw sounds to pretend to be riding a motorcycle.😂
---
**Hex: Disconnect**  
---
Upon loading into the trial, the Hex activates.  
---
The Hex has a timer of **10**/**20**/**30** seconds.  
---
If a Hex Totem is cleansed before the timer expires, you are allowed to **quit the game** without punishment.  
---
If the timer expires, **2**/**3**/**All** survivors in the trial are disconnected from the host.  
---
^(/s)  
---
How do you know they're swf?
---
The new matchmaking groups Survivors up before putting them in a lobby.
---
Words of a bad survivor.
---
So, if I hook survivor between 2 gens, I will be punished for defending them...
---
Neat
---
A challenge I would love to see survivors pull is...Wait til the killer does his first pass near your generator to start working on it. By the time he comes back around to the first one more than likely it is done or close to it. Then they’ll be popping off done like a line of firecrackers. 
---
Had one group do this to me as the killer and it was sick. Prob wouldn’t work on smaller, more confined stages or on some certain killers(Doc, Nurse, Spirit) but it would still be a good start to the match.
---
I didn't say you couldn't nerf survivors.
---
SWF members giving their Rank 20 friends a purple flashlight with green battery and low amp filament + Heart Locket.
---
New Killers receiving 14 Pink Moris and purple/pink addons from their more experienced friend.  
---
Basically, this could be abused into imbalancing the game at low ranks, and that's no good.
---
I find him fun to play against, mostly because of how hot he is.
---
Can someone draw me a diagram of where to stand like you were trying to demonstrate it to a five year old?
---
new perk??
---
This brought to you those killed by the Legion XD
---
Survivors who play like this deserve the tunnel.
---
yikes af.
---
I see Baraka fitting in DbD the most tbh.
---
As for the MK11 fighters, definitely the Doctor (or Huntress).
---
No fun allowed
---
for sure, i just thought thought it was funny because the word "fun" ended up on a clown
---
also "thank" on nurse and "being" on shape
---
Uhhhhhhh
---
Oh you're right, sorreh. I hate DS too!!
---
Shut up you TOXIC SURVIVOR MAIN
---
Animal Companion  
---
Both forms are pretty solid, especially because you can strengthen a 3-gen strat even further with Scout. But a question I have about Hunter: Is the survivor immobilized while dealing with the Skill Check? Because they may be a tad bit overpowered if that's the case.  
---
Parry  
---
Just set a macro, ggez bb killer ^(/s)  
---
This perk seems creative, but will it only activate outside of chases?  
---
Also, tier II and III are the exact same unless I'm reading it wrong.  
---
Hex: Hard Wired  
---
So it's a Hex perk that can only be activated so many times on a generator? Also, it sounds like Overcharge except it doesn't do bonus regression and it can be disabled permanently.  
---
On The Hunt  
---
The "if they have not been healed" part suggests that survivors are normally using insta-heals in chases. Basically, it could be used on tunneling Legions to make the 1% chance of actually getting away a 0% chance. Its Mangled effect is just Sloppy Butcher with a cooldown.  
---
Parry^(survivor)  
---
So this can be used to **force** the killer to stop chasing a survivor, only to start a button mashing minigame. A little too overpowered imo. Also, what happens if you lose?  
---
Vitality  
---
Is it when you're not in a chase like Diversion and Stake Out?  
---
This is pretty much guaranteed 3 hits. It should probably be balanced.  
---
Taunt  
---
All the killer needs to do (Especially on PC) is to turn over to you for a split second, and return to the chase. Now you're Exhausted, and the killer has wasted your perk. Parry seems like a direct upgrade to this.  
---
And what is the Bloodied status effect? Is it Hemorrhage or a new status effect?
---
I had a hag match where even though I was crouching it was still setting off the traps
---
I mean are we gonna pretend the survivor playerbase isn’t literally full of these kinds of ppl. Survivors have larger kill counts then half the killers 
---
Gen Rushing = Ignoring hooked/injured teammates in favour of just getting the gens done ASAP. Also refers to the sense that you lose gens extremely quickly.
---
Tunnelling = Ignoring other Survivors to kill one player asap.
---
They do exist.
---
Xenomorph from Alien. No idea what it would do, but it would be cool.
---
Oh boy I sure am glad that there aren’t things survivors have that don’t take skill and have no counterplay!
---

I'd literally pay for a good Trapper fanfiction. there's so much mystery to what this unit of man was doing before Entity trapped him in her Realm.
---
This actually sounds amazing. I hardly ever use maps or sabotage toolboxes, and I definitely wouldn’t mind exchanging them for BP. 
---
Amanda benefits from a smaller radius, particularly because her terror radius fades rather than vanishes upon crouching. The bonus vision and extra distance to play with your prey with makes it fun for counter-juking with her lunge around pallets and loops.
---
Unless the nurse is running like 4 blinks and is really good I feel there is counterplay.
---
Against a good nurse, it’s usually all mindgames. Doubling back at weird times, then after you’ve done that, switching to running straight. Corners are the best for this.
---
For the nurse, your counterplay is to fake blinks too, make them shorter than expected, risky but they could just double back into your arms. 
---
I want Amanda in a swimsuit 
---
Thank you Scott!
---
Okay - time to answer questions.
---
Regal Rights - Upon entering the Terror radius, you will receive the Status effect.  You will not receive it again until you leave and des ter the terror radius.
---
Checkmate - Yes, you will always be in the Queen’s FOV, which is why I labelled her as a hard killer, because attacking someone from a distance whilst moving something from a range requires a decent amount of skill, and the fact you are unable to move during the use of the ability.
---
While the Legion's power is easier in concept and practice to use than the Nurse's, Legion's gameplay in order to actually do *decent* in a match is nothing short of difficult. They're a 110% killer who can't really 2-hit down people, and if you tunnel, you're going to get genrushed. The unfun part of Legion is how people *play* them, and I completely understand that. It's not fun to get moonwalked and BM'd, but in order to get Legion to high ranks you actually have to *think*.
---
Also, pallets hurt. 
---
\-From, a Legion Main.
---
Why is this so HD
---
Why would you delete it just because other people didn’t like it?
---
You can totally counterplay Legion too. Just make him waste his frenzy and be immersed. Thats literally the same thing against Nurse.
---
Can noed be nerfed soon every killer has it nowadays
---
Counter-counter point; the payoff of being good at Nurse is still far greater than the practice it takes should reward.
---
A free win just cos you practiced is still a free win, any other killer played as well as they can still relies on some misplays to be perfect every game.
---
this freedy rework is INSANE man 
---
That exact thing happened to me too
---
You should have Baited LF to her, seems he knew you were the only one trying. If she's going to play dirty, you need to learn when to do the same 
---
Regal Rights - Upon entering the Terror radius, you will receive the Status effect.  You will not receive it again until you leave and reenter the terror radius.
---
Checkmate - Yes, you will always be in the Queen’s FOV, which is why I labelled her as a hard killer, because attacking someone from a distance whilst moving something from a range requires a decent amount of skill, and the fact you are unable to move during the use of the ability.  The reason I chose this is because the Knights have an incredibly movement speed and the Queen will be able to see the auras of her knights and anyone who is currently being pursued by them in a chase.
---
Thoughtfulness: As long as the perk is not on cooldown, you will receive the effects of Thoughfulness.  If you receive the reunited bonus, the perk will activate, you will experience the effect for the 10 seconds, and then experience a 60/50/40 second cooldown.  Once the cooldown is over, you would be able to use this perk again if you receive the reunited bonus again.
---
Or you play against me as a killer. 
---
r/memetempletofficial
---
Being an asshole isn't a ban worthy offense. The devs have made it pretty clear that the only playstyle not allowed is the one that holds the game hostage. A survivor waiting for someone else to die doesn't meet this criteria, annoying or not.
---
I got it on ps+ for free awhile back but never played it. My group of friends recently got into it though. 
---
Or console. Still accurate framerate
---
Honestly, as implied in my post, I don’t mind the t-bagging.  People do that both in and out of the gate, so I will not begrudge them that.  It’s the fact that they sit there, waiting for the killer to chase them out.  
---
Literally, I had a game where the gates opened and I saw them run into the gate area.  So I stopped chasing them, and got up to make myself lunch, because the game is over.  I get back, 15 minutes later, and the match is still going.  No one’s escaped.  I look into the exit area, and they’re sitting there like a bunch of pigeons.  I should not have to chase them out like a person shoos away birds.
---
As regards to camping area, with hook rushing or survivors holding on the hook rush, there would probably have to be tweaks.  Like when near the anti camping radius, the killer has a longer chase initiation range, allowing them to enter the area without fear if they see someone making a rush for the hook.  Or maybe make the radius smaller than the range I made a suggestion for, but not so small that it still remains camping.  Anything, because the current no sacrifice pips thing BHVR implemented to try and fix the issue is not working.
---
when they hit you, you can't escape the chase. for the love of god, i already said you CAN escape the Legion overall, you can't escape THE CHASE with them if they decided to go for you. while you CAN escape the chase with a good Nurse.
---
Deadass just thought "man we console players have it rough" before realizing. Optimization can't come soon enough
---
You died ?
---
Camp big time
---
Top person working with killer?
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Love this
---
What good does escaping the chase do when Nurse still gets you? Oh right. Bloodpoints. Thats all that matters?
---
perhaps
---
Undertale (2015)
---
Oh I see. I been playing for like two years lol
---
If you want to counterplay nurse you must mindgame her 
---
I'm having the same problem on PS4 so I just try being emersive, pound gens, totems,only go for safe hook saves, go for the hatch if need be. And one pip at a time get away but the hardest part is to never DC.
---
Username doesn’t check out 
---
Where did you find this OP?
---
He had to flex 
---
Man, i had one using a tuft of hair and NOED. Blew my mind. Sadly, he never got tier 3 and we cleansed his totems. Poor guy. When we saw it at the end game, couldn't help but laugh.
---
They’re
---
Yeah you do mate. I'd recommend getting cannibal to level 40 and getting Franklin's demise too. Very underated perk and great against SWF when they bring torches in.
---
Can you edit on PS4 to speed up? I thought you could only trim.
---
It's good on every killer except Doc pretty much.
---
I can only dream
---
Yeah nah but also take it cus it means you won't get it again (bcs it's lv 3)
---
This isn’t school you understand what I was trying to say so what’s with the grammar being corrected for?
---
What happens if Frank’s mixtape becomes base kit? 
---
The doctor because he seems the type to enjoy toying with his prey before a kill, and his shock therapy really fucks your head. 
---
Just imagine what’d it’d do to you without the restraints of being a game, the things you’d see hear and feel. It’d be like a state of constant panic attack 
---
F K ING SWITCHLAGGED A S!!!!

She kills male children indiscriminately. She only keeps. Females. 
---
yes to bubba, but i really wouldnt get freddy, at least until the rework. its difficult to do well with him without tunnelling. but hey, people told me the same with pre buff wraith, and i ended up loving him. if u decide against him, pig is a pretty good killer to pick up :) 
---
I got slugged once by the killer but managed to crawled away undetected until..... you guess it, this weasely nerd used Bond to point out my dying location.
---
Fuck him. 
---
I thought this was common knowledge and that it was the first thing that came to everyone’s mind when legions power was revealed 
---
I wish I had a PC that could even start to handle this game. Even then I don't want to rebuy the game and all of the killers. Just wish console killer could be even tolerable at high ranks
---
Staged. 
---
Jesus christ that jumpscared me lmao
---
I don’t think my laptop is too strong but I’m running it decently, what are your specs? 
---
Clown will always be my dead last favourite killer to verse, honestly not entirely sure why because I don't feel like he's broken or OP but god, something about the constant hindering gives me conniptions
---
9 year old toshiba laptop that takes 2 minutes to open chrome
---
Thank you, for the second part of the comment.
---
I'll probably pass on the punch haha. 
---
You’re sorry that people like to play the game properly?
---
Oh, you poor child. 
---
Freddy is not nearly as bad as people say and I’ll die on that hill. I spend most my time in the red ranks too so it’s not a case of “I don’t know how to counter him”.
---
The entity has spoken. 
---
It's used exclusively for youtube and college essays at this point
---
Nurse is a free character, I didn’t purchase her either I was just letting you know that Freddy was my second choice out of all killers. He isn’t boring at least for me, though A LOT of people who used him when I play survivor make him seem boring but that’s because they decide to play in very uninteresting ways, I’d much rather play Bubba then play say Hillbilly because Hillbilly tends to be a worse offender of uninteresting games. And I get it, BBQ and Chili is a must to a lot of you out there, but quite frankly I’ve been playing killer all this time without the damn thing and I’m doing A OK. Not that long ago I purchased bubba and I haven’t even unlocked it for all killers yet, I just have it on him lol. If he seems boring to you just go with Freddy and wait for the shrine to have BBQ and chili. 
---
Legion is a great killer. It's just how you play him and with what addons. 
---
Honestly, I doubt I would even reach the red ranks to be honest lol.
---
He’s just so different to every other killer, that he’s like a new class
---
I don't think people understand that tiers only matter at higher ranks of play. Like, see Freddy there? Yes, he's a bit weaker than the other killers. No, that does not make him completely unusable by anyone. No, it does not matter that you got a 4k as Freddy or Nurse or whoever the fuck you picked, okay?
---
God, I'm an edgy asshole.
---
Only like 4 of these are fun....
---
Earlier today, there were three of us left. Person unlocks the exit gates by me. I run out. I go to spectate. I see the third person running out the exit gate. Switch to spectate person who unlocked exit gate and they’re getting hooked. Idk how the hell that happened. 
---
Hex: Davy Jones’ Locker ~ Going into a locker damages you 1 health state upon your exit
---
Nah my first idea was a hex build with hex thrill of the hunt because he’s fast enough to run to a totem if it starts getting worked on
---
Well I’m sure you know this but with the recent tech advancements you could get a really “powerful” pc for like 500 dollars on your Facebook market 
---
I want to plunderer his chest too
---
Hag also. Basement hag legitimately needs to be nerfed because it's more of a death sentence then leathercamp, and it's more efficient.
---
The thing is though, when he was announced I was like "damn he's cool I'm gonna main him" since at that point I didn't really have a definitive main, closest was trapper. But then after people started to get used to him and figure out his weaknesses on the ptb, they all said that he was worse than Freddy. This hurt but I still decided I was gonna main legion when he came out on console, and here we are now, with everyone hating legion and their mains while I just kinda sit back and take the toxicity since I technically brought this upon myself.
---
except you can chase them out
---
Hex perks aren’t worth it anymore 
---
Extra blinks remove all of the skill lol, I don't know why they exist
---
Totems waste 75 seconds, most DS uses dont even get a minute.
---
But mindgames require brain activity which is something that I lack :(
---
Never said it was OP. There’s no counter :^)
---
Maybe it's your bad attitude that's holding you back
---
Killer main detected 
---
So do teachable perks stay at level 1? On the wiki it has a seperate section for teachable perks and always lists their stats the same as the level 1 for that perk
---
Toxic and arrogant. 
---
Ds only becomes a NOED level problem if everyone is runnig it and everyone is a good survivor. Otherwise it's adrenalin that's more leveled with NOED
---
I think he needs to reevaluate his definition of "last word," and how much effectiveness it loses during an argument/hatemail if you announce you're somehow proud of having the last word.
---
H E A L
---
You can invite players to party chat/group messaging once you are in a killer lobby (unless they have adjusted settings to not allow this).
---
Also Wraith is the same as Clown. Camp, Tunnel and use noed as well, and always wear that Halloween skin. Always. (im not frustrated, im only telling the truth)
---
Don't worry I'm that type of killer. But I'm on Ps4. 
---
found the alt account
---
Just wait until you pop frenzy as legion and lunge on coldwind. At that point the devs personally go to your house and stab your eyes out
---
Didnt Bhvr bring this issue up themselves and are "fixing" it? 
---
Susie fan art = tons of up votes tho.
---
No idea~ im a new player soooo i thought he would spawn nearby* me bcuz im quite unlucky not literally beside me
---
You don't escape the chase against Nurse unless the Nurse is BAD.
---
As a Nurse and Billy piece of scum, just wanna come here and say I appreciate the free bloodpoints in a convenient package you provide me with this attitude. ;)

Stealth Punisher/Ninja Doc Build would object to this statement! case and point:
---
Add-on's:
---
Calm 3 +/- 8m to Terror Radius  (- in punishment mode, + in treatment mode)
---
Calm 2 +/- 4m to TR
---
Perk:
---
M&amp;A +/- 8m to TR in and out of chase,  
---
Results:
---
32-8 (for M&amp;A) -12 (for stacked Calm add-on's) in punishment mode = 12m TR when not chasing
---
32+8-12 for Punishment mode while chasing = 28m TR
---
32-8+12 for Treatment mode when not chasing = 36m TR 
---
32+8+12 For Treatment mode while chasing =52m TR
---
This build has such a wide range of inconsistent TR fluctuations that no one really ever knows where the Doc is especially when he goes into punishment mode and sneaks up on them with a 12m TR. Add calms affliction into the mix where survivors randomly hear themselves on the edge of the TR, and you get a very stressed group of survivors. 
---
This is one of my top 5 favorite Doc builds, and I usually throw in NC, BBQ&amp;C, and Ruin on it, but lately have traded NC for Discordance. M&amp;A is incredibly fun on Doc when paired with the Calm add-on's.

Meme?

Was in a game sub a couple years back, caused a lot of drama when one of my edits was used on a news article, people were messaging me and the sub got mad at the site. 
---
As they were talking also about stuff and ideas people in the thread (think they might've copy pasted what people said) where I made the post were discussing about, without pointing out where they're getting it. (If you've been tv subs, its pretty common to see people quote or edit on _whatever is going on about_ where the theory or edit community are from).
---
It's personally no biggie for me, but its really cool when a year after something I posted shows up again. 
---
Or survivor main that's rank 1 with almost 3k hours into the game.
---
ima be real with y'all rn: spirit, clown, and wraith are not fun killers
---
Imagine having to play a killer to get a perk you want for other killers.
---
This reply was made by were gonna live forever gang
---
i wish i had your luck your 65% of my killers are nurses and the other like 25% are spirits and let me tell you i hate to play against spirit
---
No but EAC functions about as well as a one legged cat so I wouldn’t do it bc they won’t unban you if it decides to. 
---
Not sure why anyone would risk it in a game that uses that dumpster fire of an anti cheat 
---
Imagine if Lery's is as dark as the hospital in Silent Hill.  Bumping into a nurse would have been frightening.  As it is now though, why not just put neon lights in it?  Everything is so bright and well-lit.  :/
---
fr tho, fuck em
---
That’s what they all say
---
Calm down, Satan.
---
Petition to rename the sub to r/okbuddywraith or r/okbuddydaylight 
---
I got Bubba just for the perks. If you like the idea of playing Freddy just go for it, I've been having a lot of fun playing him since I just bought him even against teams who know how to counter him. Especially on PS4 you don't have to worry as much about super tryhard SWF squads in the high ranks that you don't even plan on pushing, so just play whatever's fun to you. I'm not the type of player who gets super tilted over a 1K or getting looped though so YMMV.

Some killers have a perk that activates when the gate is powered and that perk is generally attached to a totem. The totem lights up and if it’s cleansed the perk is cancelled.
---
This was just perfect timing.
---
Ok, other bad survivor.
---
Okay, I actually love this.
---
“Well, it’s a long, funny story that involves a freaky spider god and a man who can walk faster than you can run.”
---
What do you mean "takes skill to play"? Do you mean that you have to actually spend 15 minutes to blink around the map to get a feel for the blinking or do you mean "hmm I should go around this loop this way to mindgame the survivor"? Rhetorical question because the latter isn't true with Nurse who can just turn off her brain and blink at the survivor and smack him.
---
Because I agreed with their reasoning for not liking it
---
Freddy decided to help with gens since realizing he’s a useless killer
---
I'm new, who's Nea?
---
The nurse is the 1at one 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 ah man the irony 
---
I’ve had people let me kill them even though the gates are open just because I was Myers and message me saying so 😂. Gotta love people’s devotions to daddy Myers.
---
LMAO me and my friend do that all the time. Are you on PC because honestly it could have been one of us
---
Check a tier list pls
---
What's the synergy with this? Its not obvious to me :(
---
This. Other killers more or less rely on a mistake done by survivor and hence they are played as killers who punish survivors for a mistake. The one mistake survivors do against a Nurse is that they stay connected in the game with a Nurse. 
---
I've been playing legion a lot since they came out, I love their power for the speed and pressure. Pop a speed add on and you can cut off a survivors planned route very effectively. 
---
Plus it's a nice change from eating pallets and wasting time with pallet loops 
---
Well, that's it, I said I enjoy legion, have at thee...

When they were first introduced in 2017(?) the Devs said they would return in the future as a proper item. For some reason it never happened and they only come around during events.
---
"Farming is not even allowed", I laughed myself out on this. I sense you are one from post game chat.
---
How would you run jungle gyms and L-walls/T-walls on Coldwind Farm where the survivor can constantly see if you're mindgaming or not?
---
This is dumb logic because these terms easily describe things.
---
Going by your logic there is no such thing as Escaping because that is what Survivors are supposed to do and there is no such thing as being Sacrificed because that is what the Killers are supposed to do.
---
Oink
---
What are timer killers?
---
Nah, he's running freaking NOED. Then again, there is a Decisive...
---
Nerd
---
Then leave the game and nove on. If you even read the chat, I wanted my daily on Wraith and as you can see, 3 out of 4 wanted to farm. Funniest fact, guy spent 15min spectating others just to show his frustrations in post game chat. If he rly doesn't want to farm, he'd leave and play another game. Being butthurt when you lately realise that others farmed and you got only 13k with probably -1 pip is not my problem.
---
You just run in a straight line like a jackass. Its why Coldwind is the worst realm in the game and we've been bitching for 2 years.
---
Well if they were to share the same universe because of Myers then it'd already be the case due to previous games having Freddy and Leatherface.
---
It's even worse when you're having bad form and actually end up missing them, too.
---
I’m calling behavior hitting someone on hook is equal to hacking legacy or exclusives
---
I don't see the point, if you got no kills you're going to derank, and if its points you're worried about you get more for at least doing something whether its hitting survivors, chasing. etc. You don't really gain anything out of just standing there other than disrespect. 
---
Franklin's is bad 
---
This would be super boring. Imagine crouching in the corner and doing generators for the whole game.
---
Leatherface has the best teachables, Spirit &amp; Hag are the strongest DLC killers
---
The good thing is when your in dreamland, your chance of getting a skill check is 0% /s
---
Legion can't spend too much time chasing you. if they do, they're really bad. if you take Nurse in the Chapel or in the mid of long MacMillan map, she will lose you because many obstacles preventing her from seeing where you go. I've been kiting really good Nurses in these. Legion can't lose you. unless they're really really bad. from those I'd get away too. but there's not much difference between an okay Legion vs very good Legion. while okay Nurse vs very good Nurse is literally drastic. chase with Nurse base speed vs Legion also has huge difference. you can still get people with 110 while you'll never catch a good survivor with Nurse speed. 
---
Why?
---
Also Freddy is only awful relative to other killers, you can still do well with him.
---

---
After looking at your posts ive determined that youre just salty that you arent getting any upvotes.

I always find him super boring same with hag

I’ve even posted a positive comment about legion before and gotten bombarded. Interestingly enough everyone who flames me was a nurse player

---
Get yourself a man who looks at you the way David looks at Jake.
---
You use a slot to counter a bad item. That's why.
---
It's good vs instaheals, but the only reason to run it otherwise is just to be a dick to the survs (if that's your thing, go for it). You're better off running perks that actually help you win.
---
Just wait for them to turn a corner. You’ll hit them every time. 
---
It's true, you can literally win a 2v1 when there are still 2-3 gens left.
---
yeees i can't wait 
---
If Nurse loses a chase (actual chase, not the one where points are awarded) then the Nurse is bad. Plain and simple. Bad design and therefore incredibly difficult to balance properly.
---
Everyone knows Nurse is a problem, Legion is just even worse design.
---
Tbh all I want. I don’t care about ranking up or not. I just play games for fun
---
Franklyns can help with toolboxes too and slow down gen rushing early on. And the amount of people who are stupid enough to run straight back and try get the item again is insane 
---
It depends on your game style ect though. For example franklyns with legion is great but as doctor (distressing. Overwhelming presence, BBQ and ruin is what I run) it's a waste. 
---
Oh god

You can report with custom reporting saying “art theft” for reasoning and the posts often do get removed (though it doesn’t seems to never work on posts with high notes regardless of source not being credited)

\- some seconds pass

 Needless to say, I died first that game :D

But... but... why taking Leader at Level 1? D:

Adrenaline would be on par with noed if it healed you to full no matter what health state and have you a permanent speed increase until you got hit. 
---
I think I was the killer.... Was it against a Wraith?
---
Get that flashlight first man, can’t ignore a purple flashlight lol
---
😓
---
Try to talk with the support 
---
It's important to remember that the game is not necessarily showing the exact same thing it's calculating. Just because it seems like you used a pallet in time doesn't mean it should save you from a hit. That's part of what I meant when I mentioned hitboxes. 
---
Also, hang out near walls. Nurse blinks aren't very accurate, and if you're close to a wall it's not impossible for even good nurses to pop through one.
---
It happened to me too (with Kate) but after restarting it worked again, it reset all the cosmetics on my characters though. That was a bit weird 
---

(Works best on Myers and tall killers) 
---
You need to be as close as possible to the survivor (you need to touch him otherwise the camera can clip inside your body) and you have to be slightly to the left facing him as you can see in the diagram.
---
When the sacrifice animation begins (the entity's claw goes through their torso) the camera will be in a fixed position for a while.
---
For the best effect first stare at the survivor then begin turning once the struggle phase has ended you need to face the same way the survivor does on the hook to look into the camera.
---
You'll get this effect:

Hag?
---
Fuck me Mother Daughter ring seems insane, never tried it because I’m terrible.
---
Yes I know, I’ve become smarter over the time and I stopped using pallets when I think the killer will get a “bs hit”. If he hits me, that’s no pallet wasted and if he misses, I get another loop in. 
---
Why is a list every good player agrees on no argument ? Pls stay objective 
---
I'm just giving you facts 
---
I'm playing both wraith and doc and doc is mid or b tier, some times with the right perks even a.
---
Wrath is bottom end or d tier with Freddy only 
---
Course no matter his build he is super weak to loops and chases and extremely weak to flashlights 
---
And since the games meta for survs is an aggressive playstyle instead of sneaky most times and wraith is weak to palets and loops he is weak 
---
Far far weaker than doc 
---
Legion locks on you like a freaking guided rocket. With Nurse you can still hope she fails.
---
Legend thanks
---
Also possible.
---
It didnt occur to me because I dont see Hag very often, nor do I play her.
---
Well fork you then.
---
Its only because he counters looping to an extent. If you rely too much on it, he becomes very difficult to face.
---
Legion is the best for EASY 4Ks and is one of the most fun to play killers
---
Give me a 3-genning Doctor any day than a 3-genning Legion or a Frank's Legion.
---
I think I'm just gonna buy both. Rip my wallet :(
---
Breaking down addons and items for some BP back would be much more realistic. And also making all the op shit people have on their underleveled/unplayed characters being used would make this game much less fun.
---
Yooo same I just got bbq and chili today, but my doc is level 47 and it's gonna take a while before he gets it.
---
BBQ and chili is crazy man
---
The beautiful thing is that tricycles in the Saw universe are what Billy uses for transport so it would make PERFECT sense for Amanda to be able to wip one out for her tertiary ability.
---
Even better, have the Billys’s on each box that a survivor searches fail, get down and follow after them until they get the trap off lmao.
---
Stalking seems to glitch out a lot. The way I got it in this match, I stalked somebody through a tree while they weren't even visible on my screen
---
Just restarted it cool
---
Okay.
---
I got chased away from one particular jigsaw box twice before giving up and abandoning it to try my luck elsewhere. 4 failed searches later, I realized the key was indeed in the first box I searched, but by that point it was too late and I was dead. I was so close to completing it too, both times, but the killer just really wanted to keep me away from it. Seems like killer somehow knew. 
---
TIL not a single killer in the game is fun to go against.
---
Yeah, during the firt chinese event
---
Wraith. Bong boy fucking terrifies me. That thumpthumpthump of his footsteps as he gets closer to you getting chills lmao
---
I had this same thing happen to me today except the I told the killer I loved her because of the pain I caused all game.
---
ps: it was a nurse and I ran her around the same tire for at least a minute or 2 after she was already chasing me for 6
---
Huntress main here, reload more often, after you knocked the Nea you went to pick her up instead of getting hatchets
---
Sverkeren is really fucking good with Nurse, he only use shadowborn on her in rank 1, he is also one of the worlds best huntress players
---
Can I have it. For my next birthday. Plssss
---
If you like stealthy killers, you might like Myers. He has a fun, varied playstyle. With monitor&amp;abuse tier1 evil within has no terror radius so you can even pull people off gens if theyre not paying attention 
---
I managed to get 32k bloodpoints. Healing vs Legion slows the game down SO much.
---
Now you can see why she needs a nerf/rework. 
---
Can’t tell if you’re trolling lol
---
Looks like you just got outplayed by the big brain Nea main
---
Idk, just a shower thought man.
---
To be fair, and I don’t mean this to sound rude, but she just feels like how a killer should. 
---
Oof

That would cost some $$$$$$$$$$$$$

This might be easy on Rank 20, but...

I never said it would be specifically you. its just there are 2/3 of these ppl that farm new players and kill their fun on a higher level, its just not enjyable i mean i dont like to give myself pain and thats excatly what that is some would say it helps gettin better but wheres the fun on rank 15-13 when ppl purposefully derank to destroy us because we dont know how to fight back because we are learning and are new its discouraging and i think there needs to be a limit for the deranking. your opinion on this ?
---
I remember doing that when I wanted to get Taking One For The Team achievements because that's the best scenario where there is injured survivor next to the hook and killer is able to go for the hit on me. Thank god I'm finally done with it
---
I think doc is better than wraith but not by much. Doc isnt really any better than wraith in chases. He can ensure hits on unsafe pallets but good killers can do this anyway. 
---
Wraiths stealth gets overlooked. It can ensure an initial hit however docs timewasting and initial tracking is probably better.
---
Both are average b tier killers. They are in a stable spot not strong nor weak just average
---
no one is against fanart or lore related discussions. 
---
It isn't a high quality concept. I'm new to the game and I had a fun idea that I felt like sharing. Regardless of how "bad" an idea is, it's something someone had fun thinking about, and it's the kind of thing that keeps a community going.
---
I have a decent understanding of the games mechanics, and if I had time I could make a decent concept for how it's core ability would work, but this was just a shower thought.
---
Also I disagree that the perks and addons are the most important part. Most of them are simple thematics or extremely simple from a design standpoint. Clown has one that allows him to vault vaster and disable vaults. Everything done by that perk is done better by his Tonics.
---
Why did you hide the names i was going to go talk shit :(
---
as i specifically said its around rank 15-13 where it starts to go bonkers and u suddenly have 3/3 matches up against ruin sloppy etc killers and u gettin bodyied like nothing good in the world as a fresh players its just not funand it needs a change at least the ranking system i like the game but these ppl destroy it for me i dont wanna get killed within 10 seconds with like 2 others together cause the killer clearly is more skilled and shouldnt be in 15-13. There should be a barriere for red tier only and so on its not fair .

I like both but I enjoy the speed of 28 stab wounds, also I like yeeting myself over pallets.

Jumping over pallets is a serious factor in this

This matches up pretty well with the only available data we have on the subject:

I feel like legion just draws in the fanboys and girls. Easy costume to make and it's fucking plastered everywhere here. Anyone else tired of it?

You reach red ranks its nurses and billies with few spirts or huntresses here and where. Haven't seen one single wraith or freddy in a long time.
---
&gt;Especially if it's like, more than half the team doing it.   
---
This gets me every time, earlier today saw all 3 teammates trying to hook dive meg on first stage and after i downed them all with some hatchet snipes they complained about me camping in the lobby.   
---
Like damn man, you expect me to go and kick generators when your entire team is within swinging distance ? 
---
Why should killers only get to win if the survivors fuck up? It seems more fair to me that the most skilled team should win and if that happens to be a nurse than they deserve to win because they were the more skilled player. 
---
Pretty sure you were the only one to bring *lewd* into this. 
---
That reminds me of yesterday, when I was playing Spirit with Rancor. Nea, the obsession, was just about to escape through the exit gate, but I instadown her and outright mori.   
---
He was actually a little bit salty and I kind of feel bad about it LUL
---
i mean on this rank every killer is op tho 
---
I’m not just talking FPS though, I included both because the FPS and the game crashes faster than the dow in the summer of 08’

The spirit has to do the same. Think on your feet, it’s not supposed to be easy.

There is a lot of luck. Reading is when you know what's happening and you base your decisions on that. This is not such a case. This is just an example of a blind decision that went right or wrong.

Hello there.
---
I like that clown has Fun on him!
---
It says that because when you get to level 30, 35, and 40 for each character, the "teachable" version of each of their perks will pop up. They will be orange in color and you only need to unlock these once so there is only 1 level of the "teachable perk" once you get the one level of the teachable perk, that perk will become available in every characters blood web.
---
For example, you only need to get the level 1 teachable leader in dwight's blood web, and then you will be free to level the regular leader perk to level 3 on Meg. You dont need to get 3 levels of teachable leader in Dwight's blood web in order to level up leader 3 times for meg.
---
Rank 20 eh?
---
How tho? All he can do is tunnel 
---
IT'S PISSING ME OFF! I JUST WANT TO PLAY OTHER KILLERS!!! PLEASE!!! DON'T MAKE ME WAIT A MONTH UNTIL I DERANK!!!
---
GIVE EACH KILLER THEIR OWN RANKING SYSTEM OR WHATEVER! I DON'T CARE!
---
Well can I get banned for it?
---
Nope. 
---
Nah, it’s basically just the term I use for a forehead/potato. They cannot be boosted no. What I’m trying to say is that they do not belong in rank 1. With any other other killer they wouldn’t be there. Easy and boring games against such legions
---
The huntress is by far one of the funnest killers to plays as/against 
---
Yea I had this happen to me too, except when I noticed it, I found the killer, looped him till we got to the bush hugger location and the killer decided to kill him instead, so yea. Fuck you bush huggers. (Also he flamed me a lot on the post-game lobby) :D
---
You'll love r/dbdgonewild

Well.. okay then, time to derank.

39,000 players are online atm.

If you are queue as 3, you need 1 single survivor, which are the hardest to get.

I guess you could say they are *legion*

Call it ignorance than if you will, either way ps4 dbd is a joke compared to the pc experience

Do you consider looping and "gen rushing" toxic as well?

Had to question if my contacts were gett in ng dry cause of the quality. Still pretty sure a survivor just flash lighted you in the main menu giving you some warning shots.
---
Ew a cringey post game chat
---
Then you were a F O O L
---
Had the same thing happen yesterday except mine turned green and white. 
---
Gigantic if factual
---
Well the main differences are even though you could stock them up Killers will always lose their add-on this unless they have a black ward regardless of how well they do in the game.
---
Survivors can keep things like other bulbs and insta heals.
---
Another important differences is that The Killer's add-ons are meant to counter balance four different survivors and their items.
---
For example something like the iridescent head is supposed to be equivalent to four survivors bringing in insta heals.
---
As for Amanda's ultra rare one being ruleset number 2 is not worth being an ultra rare with how little it can impact things in the grand scheme of the game.
---
As for her other ultra rare Amanda's letter can pretty much just like scratched mirror Myers can essentially be shooting yourself in the foot more than it's beneficial depending on maps
---
Would have been a sick juke if you didn't run
---
AND sprint into the locker like why lol
---
why play legion when you can play spirit?
---
You flair and your username is uh
---
*contradictory*
---
I hqte playing as and against legion, same goes for nurse
---
That tier list is a meme my man
---
Agree with this one
---
I'm guessing from a part that you forgot to censor + the censor length that this is DUDE IS THAT A SUPRA? I had him accuse me of tunneling too after he literally ran into me twice after being unhooked, I wasn't even trying to find him lmao
---
Classic made up on the spot survivor terms of engagement. I think they do actually expect to be just let go x amount of seconds after being unhooked even if they're so shit at hiding or running that they flat out run into you.
---
The only way I can see Tyde being okay with de-ranking is the queue times at higher ranks. 
---
And yeah i agree. instead of de-ranking it's always better to just improve your play style and learn how to outplay people. 
---
Unfortunately, dodging the Nurse is harder to do
---
Because you already own it. It’s his alt outfit
---
I was spectating haha. 
---
Imagine taking tyde's tier lists seriously. Big yikes my dude. I mean you cant trust someone who put hag in D tier
---
Well hot damn, would you look at that.
---
Next few matches are gonna get hella sexy 
---
Michael, the true king of jump scares.
---
Hah I only just made this up, it’s a common idea so it’s not surprising. 
---
Killers still get rewarded for being good, what really grinds my gears is that killers get rewarded for tunneling and camping as well.
---
well obviously? I’m talking about the hits a killer gets after you fully vaulted and ran a meter away from the window and you still get hit, *which is not fucking intended* 
---
His ability has no counter
---
You are not alone. The community is torned: half loves it half hates it. Personally I'm not interested in using it and as a survivor is very boring to play against.
---
found the person who's never played Nurse
---
Same for me with the pig on ps4
---
I agree. I’ve played three games today where a camper/ tunneller managed to get a 4K which sucks. Against good survivors it generally only results in a 1k but a lot of survivors are too damn altruistic.
---
This happened last night during a game, on PS4, all we could see was a small mark for the back of the gen, 
---
I just think that the fact that you can‘t cleanse noed until it‘s active is kinda bullshit
---
Lol yah! Me and my wife do the same thing! 
---
Quite a lot of us just disconnect on hadnofun. It's good practice, especially if survivors use an offering for it.
---
At least camping has the counter of doing gens, the only counter to tunneling is not going down
---
You did hit her. The hitboxes can just be weird as hell at times.
---
I didn't DC. I sunk a lot of bps in him as killer. I have all perks and shit on them
---
sizable with the condition of the overhead meme being legitimate 
---
People bringing up ultra rare addons like they are a common occurrence. Yes they are a problem also but you’re missing my point that survivors can use up to 4 ultra rare addons never said they where commonly get 4 but it’s common to get at least 1 a game 
---
Ah so you're bitching and moaning about something fixed in the PTB then
---
nice. good job, survivor 
---
Trapper tbh he would be standing there with a bone mask and hooks sticking out of him and when i’d run i’d stand in one painful ass beartrap
---
Someone put Running in the 90's on this
---
boost it ?
---
This game will always have increased toxicity compared to majority of titles out there, because the core mechanics boil down to not letting the other team participate in the game and do in-game activities that they are supposed to do. It's not fun to just hang from the hook, unable to do anything and having no agency in returning to the match besides other survivors rescuing you and the killer allowing them. It's equally not fun being infinitely looped by bunch of good survivors with 4 crutch perks, not being able to land one hit, much less a hook, while gens pop in the background.
---
Therefore game boils down "to achieve a maximum win you need to steal fun from the other team". Naturally levels of frustration will be higher than your average multiplayer.
---
As for memes, it's just a bit of self-irony. No content of any kind expected for a while, so nothing much we can do on the sub besides posting memes. And since most of us admit this game makes us toxic in one way or the other, why not joke about it.
---
Not what we’re talking about. We mean being in chase, fast vault fully through a window, when the hit shoulda whiffed, and it didnt.
---
Yeah. I wish the devs implemented some kind of system that punishes camping and tunnelling. Like maybe if the killer is within a certain distance of the hook and isn’t in a chase the hooked survivor’s timer won’t go down or something like that. 
---
I don’t know if that would work but I think it’s a good idea at least but I doubt the devs would ever do it because the insidious LF campers would rage lol
---
If it actually getting fixed, I’ll be happy. 
---
nice. thanks, killer
---
They aren't really a bad killer in the sense of that they are weak. They are a bad killer because they don't require skill do get things done. There is no real counterplay and it's fucking annoying to go against. Legion is bad for the game
---
It is actually 5000 according to the Wiki. Lol derp. :p
---
nice. good job, survivor
---
But...that's like one of the best maps for scratched mirror myers

My most satisfying match in some time was when I looped the Killer around the entire map while 2 people were in the basement. When I finally got downed I saw the last Survivor crouching right above the basement, presumably because the hatch spawned there.
---
I struggled for as long as I could for that fucker to get caught. Mere seconds before I was sacrifced he went down and hot damn he deserved it.

And that 20 times

A lot of people don't know this, but the secret to getting away from the killer is crouching and not moving at all, even if you get hit.

---
I honestly get kinda disappointed as Killer when I turn around just for the Survivor I hooked to get unhooked. Like come on man have some respect for me I'm the guy with a knife.
---
Well I think that goes without saying
---
Haha, had this choice on Bill a few weeks ago
---
and dus my point stands :p
---
Honestly an addon that makes the crouch increase movement speed and terror radius could be fun and unique. Admitedly it also makes Amanda essentially a better Billy without an instadown.
---
Same
---
Not necessarily there are a lot of really strong pallets on that map, including set up with multiple strong pallets in a row. Plus the fact that it’s a haven for any survivor who uses balanced landing. And taking into account hook spawns, you could down someone with just zero hooks near you or hiding behind closed doors. 
---
It’s definitely not the worst killer map, but it has a lot of drawbacks, especially when RNG isn’t kind to you. 
---
Yeah I was mostly being tongue-in-cheek, but now that you mention it without proper support or a good incline lying on the floor would probably be even worse for their neck.

How to spot Rank 1 Survivor comments: complains about nurse
---
[Nea rn](https://i.imgur.com/9Uqc2nh.jpg)
---
Happens a lot. Tons of mechanics at work here. I get the hair bug where when another survivor is picked up, their hair in the aura blows everywhere.
---
And you are the type of killer mains people dont like. You are rude and say that survivors should be hit through windows that shouldn't have hit. If i vault the window and 3 seconds later im hit thats the bs hits he was talking about. With the new changed it should fix that so we keep our momentum and its harder to get those bs hits. Thank you :)
---
I always love clips like this.
---
I play against Nurse every other game, as do most people when playing Survivor
---
Hex : Darn
---
I just wish open handed stacked with it. I know it shouldnt but that would be a nice buff if they made it so open handed stacks on stuff like that
---
Although he made some good points here and there his list is just bullshit. He rated killers after how good he himself is and didn't recognise his strong bias. 
---
Candyman or Pinhead would be fun.
---
As a gay Amanda main running these, I’m now Laganja
---
I think the monster from jeepers creepers would be cool, just my opinion tho. 
---
IT WAS A TRAP
---
I am a red rank player... I 4k practically every game with that add-on, not saying Freddy doesn't need a rework but that add-on isn't that bad. Gotta be honest I haven't even noticed any amount of slowness 
---
Doctor's buff
---
Lightning strikes from the skies instantly kill survivors and destroy gens
---
I wish I felt that way but I’ve played against her too many times 
---
I don't really know, but they need to add short characters. Reading the descriptions of all the killers and survivors, they're either average height, or tall. All survivors are listed as average, same with the shorter killers (hag, Freddy, legion, nurse and pig). But it's obvious which killers are listed as tall. So there's one more category unused, I wanna see it on survivor side or killer side.
---
Probably somewhere around pig/trapper.. Definetly below clown tho. Clowns pallet/looping game is just so much stronger 
---
Found the player who's bad with Nurse
---
Ive been asking every claudette i see if they run urban evasion. And if they do i leave the lobby. Ive had too many games where a p3 claudette does nothing but urban around the whole map. It is so irritating
---
Myers infinite tier 3 is a pretty good ultra rare but the tombstone one is garbage and more of a meme thing. Doctors ultra rare is nice but not that strong compared to something like insta hatchets from huntress which are probably the best ultra rare. 
---
Yeah dunno why they blame the Killer when they unhook someone right infront of him.. \^\^
---
You do have to learn how to read people which compared to other killers don’t have to do so much in depth like Nurse does. Most other killers just need to keep loops and structures in mind while Nurse on top also has to consider distance with speed. 
---
*PTSD flashbacks where 3 blinks were default*
---
You know what's worse? Finding the pig crouching in front of the only jigsaw box you have left to search, and because she's crouched, it doesn't count as being in a chase so the timer keeps ticking, but you also can't access the box because she's in the way.
---
That was perhaps the only time in dead by daylight that I genuinely hated the killer i was versing, such a shitty thing to do. 
---
i don’t see why i’d complain about something i’ve never experienced
---
Hex : tunnel off the hook
---
Dang that game poster is dope af. Im glad you like angry birds as much as i do. 
---
Listen here
---
What do you mean "also"? Nurse doesn't have to consider pallets or windows at all. All the player needs to learn about the Nurse is how long to keep your M2 pressed down for specific distance.
---
It's not an aura reading ability. Something else you should watch out for: Ranchor will also reveal your lacation while hiding in a locker and legion will also find you when hiding in a locker
---
You kind of treat it like Scratched Mirror Myers. You don't chase, you disengage and bamboozle them with your wallhacks and low terror radius. 
---
are you playing on pc? cause that matters. Freddy on PS4 is much more viable. 
---
and I dunno how much you play but I'm a rank 1 Freddy main on pc. was even before Curtain Calls when it was harsh with all the vacuum, amount of pallets and old bnp. and this add-on I use rarely cause any big map is way too harsh when you're moving slower. I'd lose literally cause not enough speed. 
---
exactly, it can be good on any map where you can sneak up aka just Lery's and Game. on a big map you'll succ a big bottle like a baby killer. 
---
I heard that freddy is one of the better killers on PS4
---
therefore it can't be an ultra rare add-on. it's at best rare.
---
You can't be stunned whilst in an animation, this includes flashlight saves. If the survivor mistimes the blind to be too early, you'll be blinded but not stunned 
---
They have to get the timing just right. If the timing is off you won't drop the survivor.
---
I was playing Killer and noticed that the 3 sfw were bullying this Dwight- unhooking in front of me, blocking him. So I made sure to kill them all instead, and then I let the Dwight farm with me before giving him the hatch. His little hat was adorable

The Developer's have implemented the game mechanics in a way so that the player/s can dictate how they intend to use those game mechanics. This is turn has created a choice in how the player interacts with the competitor's within a match.   
---
You can play how ever you want, but if you have the slightest shred of awareness you know when you're trolling or being obnoxious towards the other players and how its being received. You are fully aware you are playing with other sentient beings who \*feel\* just the same as you.  
---
Repeating this cycle of "I don't give a F about their feelings because they hurt mine" is not going to get you or anyone else anywhere. Eye for an eye will leave the world blind and all that bollocks...  
---
Toxicity exists within the eye of the beholder, that much I can agree with but trying to justify your toxic behavior in such a way makes you appear rather small minded and petty.

Together, we shall rid the world of this Blue Haired Feng, by ridding the world of **ALL BLUE HAIRED FENGS!** &gt;:O

obviously

As somebody who's probably played nurse for 200 hours, I think you need to rethink how you feel about her.
---
This sounds just like what the bush humping blue haired Feng would say! 
---
Honestly, I like the idea of ultra rares, yes, I understand it's annoying to go against, but it's really fun to use some of them as a killer especially since a lot of them really change the playstile quite a bit.
---
A freddy actually won a tournament on PS4. Anyways, you can do well with any killer, the game is much more balanced than before. Freddy is only the worst simply because every other killer is better, but he can still win and do well.

As long as Freddy is fun, and I don’t feel like the survivors have a clear unfair advantage over me, I’m fine playing Freddy :)

Ye shackles are bugged I think. When I started out playing hag it definetly worked as in surv got no heartbeat.. 
---
I didn't say she doesn't take skill at all. You're pulling that out of your ass. I'm saying that she's overpowered compared to rest of the killers, which is testified by how often she is played. It's kinda sad that you don't see it because it's really bad for the game overall. You have one killer that is LEAGUES ahead of rest simply because of her power which enables her to ignore all survivor defenses while rest of the killers sort of have to battle through those defenses. Worst part about Nurse that you can't balance her because of that. If you nerf the power, she becomes useless. If you buff her further, she becomes instawin. And you can't balance the rest of the game around her because it screws up everything else. Much like Freddy, she needs a rework.

Something like that for me, japanese map vs myers 2 survivors killed and 3 gens done. Last survivor doing nothing and camping in a corner of the map. I made myers follow me, of course he didnt understand my plan until he downs me and  i do a small left and right moves pointing to the survivor that oh surprise started moving towards the hatch so i turned into a living compass myers t3 that freeloader into a hook and gives me the hatch, honestly i was fine getting hooked too but i guess that guy also dislikes freeloaders
---
If the killer is Nurse it is killer sided. If the killed is Billy, spirit, Hag, or Huntress it is balanced (maybe not 100% balanced with some of the killer but close enough for now). Any other killer and it is survivor sided. I think we should now start focusing on quality of life changes (like hiding killer perks) and working on making killers and perks more effective
---
Most informative and educational video.   
---
Thank you for uploading, I definitely learned where I'm going wrong.
---
Flashlight saves only happen when the killer is blinded while moving. If you are stuck in the pick up animation the survivor won't go free. 
---
I doubt immersed survivors will pick a hot pink bunny outfit with bunny ears that pop out of the hidding spots like antennas
---
Switch Sprint burst for dead hard.
---
Solo player - just avoid Survivors, power ruined.
---
SWF players - "bro is this you?" "nah" power completely shit on.
---
Honestly this idea comes up so many times and the person proposing it never realises just how weak it is and is essentially an alternate Wraith.
---
I had a few 3-man games last night, I only played about an hour but had x3 3-man matches within that hour.
---
have my upvote just for the hamster with dwight's eyes and nose on it
---
ye I like this map with nurse
---
nice
---
Because you can't unless they have something else going for them.
---
With huntresses it usually ends up becoming a guaranteed dc the second they see what build it is. Clown often doesn't require aim, 90% of one shot clowns just go right next to the survivor and throw over and over and over till they get a hit which is most likely. Tombstones I don't mind, ultra rare tuft is bullshit though, they don't have to work much for it and they get it forever. One shot heals by themselves are bullshit though are usually not game changing like decisive. Most ultrarares are though. 
---
When you don’t know how to run anything as survivor so even stupid killers can catch you with ease(?) 
---

The problem with nurse is that the only "counter" to her is literally the mindgame which is in no way reliable, efficient or effective. You will buy maybe 5-10 seconds to the chase if you manage to juke a good Nurse before the player outplays you on next one. It's basically down to luck against a Nurse where the survivor being chased has to stop as soon as they hear Nurse blinking and try to do some weird shit to throw Nurse off which can easily be countered by multiple blinks + lunge. It's a crapshoot of which survivor really has no control over. I mean ultimately survivor decides but the decision should be more or less "random" to stop Nurse from catching them but similarly the Nurse can just randomly blink in the general direction and blink again + slap you for trying to juke her.
---
Another one of my favorites is: outplayed myers.
---
When a survivor drops a pallet in front of you/on top of you, you just look down at the pallet a few seconds and then walk away.
---
Also wanted to extend on yhe chest protecting. I like to roleplay as a trader: if a survivor gives me an item, they can have the chest. If a survivor steals and item/opens the chest without offerung an item of their own, you chase them down untill A. They drop the item or B. You down and hook them. In the case of B, the survivor is now your property and other survivors have to pay up if they want their friend back (give you another item) if they resque their friend without giving you an item, then their friend is free to go and the rescuer is now your property
---
Most of the time it's the 3rd out of 4 for me.
---
Oh ok whatever
---
Those are both fantastic ideas, I haven’t heard of the myers one before, I’ll have to try that!
---
Scout could also become obsessed with a survivor and they would have skill checks to throw her off of their trail.
---
I use keys only solo, because I don't care for the dumb dumb in my group, they are most of the time the reason you die! So when enough Gens are done I wait silently that the killers kill you the last moron and escape. 
---
The game is not dead, there is a little problen with the current matchmaking system that sometimes makes it impossible to find only 1 more survivor
---
Freddy is the worst only because every other killer is better, even if they’re only m1 killers. Not because you can’t win with him. 
---
The pimp ghost from scary movie 2

The killers gg is missing

Now I want a Drag survivor. 
---
25. 'Cus 20 wasn't sadistic enough. 
---
Lol
---
Chilli in 2019 ffs they nerfed the shit out of it! Easy counterable. 
---
Aftercare is one of the new survivor's perks, right ? Meh, I would have to wait to get it in the shrine... But even if I see their aura and they see mine, it would only be useful if I find the hatch first, right ? It's kinda hard to make them understand we need to look for the hatch otherwise haha. Thanks for the advice though ! 
---
You're neaw?
---
Nah im just lucky. I was surprised when it happened lol
---
And this is why I run legion when I see 4 flashlight claudette. Sure I will not exactly be getting kills but they may say goodbye to their 4 purple flashlights.
---
Me: Nurse is overpowered and doesn't take as much skill as people make it out to be
---
You: NUH-HUH SEH TAKES SO MUCH SKILL and is BALANCED becuz of that cuz you never go against SuCh GoOd NuRsEs and if they do they DESERVE to win even if survivor has played as much and is as skilled with survivor as the nurse player is with nurse
---
Ok. Whatever. You don't want to surrender that she's imbalanced, frustrating to play against and just outright unfair, I won't surrender that she takes very little skill to play and is overall bad to the health of the game.
---
So instead of putting the survivors one person I should chase Laurie because l... reasons 
---
He is great at low rank where survivors doesn't know how to loop and being invisible whole time helps him very much at those ranks.
---
Throw a pallet, blind them with a flashlight while they break it, then crouch your way around them
---
I know, right? You're doing a gen and you turn around and it's just a horrible almost-human shape with piercing red eyes and you start to run and it _spreads it's fucking wings and takes after you_
---
Nurse is the easiest killer in the game to play 
---
Ah, didn't even think of that!
---
Deaf pig
---
ok but Tea gia and naomi deserved the double shantay more than latrice did, just looking at the lip sync alone
---
What are those perks
---
The amount of people in the thread who didnt know these things about Freddy is very surprising
---
Yes, it shall be my quest! **Death** to all blue pigtails!
---
It was yesterday (Saturday) about mid day British time. 
---
One glitch happened to me that when the killer just got into radius the music got so loud like he was right next to me but it was much much louder than normal lol
---
why does freddy seem to be broken all of a sudden?
---
Was it doctor? 
---
I guess this focused competitor's too focused on doing gens to focus on Escaping. Seems like she needs to focus on switching her focus.
---
We tried to get in to the game with my friend for 20 minutes and it always ended to: ''disconnected from the host''. Not impressed at all.
---
And I think what this comes down to between our opinions is I think that’s totally okay. Out of all the killers in dbd, only very few set the pace for chases and I think Nurse being one of the three who do is fine. A lot of chases are defined by the survivor unless you happen to be amazing at herding people into dead zones like Trapper or Spirit. This is what I believe leads to chasing being very uninteresting at medium to high ranks because as a killer who can’t set the pace or adjust the flow, you’re just going through the motions. L Wall to T Wall. Pallets to Gym. Shack to Long Wall. Ad nauseam. With Nurse that power is in your hands, albeit oppressively, and that’s the satisfaction is that the survivors can’t have that power unless they’re flat out better than you. 
---
This is so true. Idk where this sudden mentality came from. Just a couple weeks ago, Legion was supposedly the worst in the game. Whatever happened to “you can just vault back over the pallet when Legion vaults”?
---
grim reaper
---
S- Pig
---
A- Hag
---
B- Doctor, Clown, Huntress, Shape
---
C- Wraith, Nurse, Trapper
---
D- Nightmare, Cannibal
---
F- Spirit, Legion (even with cool add-ons or whatever. Love their design, not really fun to play tho)
---
You left scrach marks...
---
 Claudette being the girl we knew she was 
---
I can confirm this works. Happened to me last game there not a lot the surv can do, if they mend then you hit them if they don’t they bleed out 
---
i’ll remember that, thank you! 
---
this is the balance the games needs tbh
---
Why not use sfm instead of gmod?
---
^(blasphemy)
---
Yeah, sometimes killers are stupid bad like that, but in the end they’re just hurting themselves. I’m a survivor main and I guess it seems worse on this side because I hardly ever swf, so I’m relying on terrible teammates 70% of the time to work together. Most of the time someone just stands on the hatch until we all die. But when I get a rare game with amazing teammates and no disconnects, it’s such a nice change.
---
thanks for the kind words of encouragement! 
---
Exactly, things never change with time, everything stays the exact same forever and no new information is ever gained. You are completely right.
---
S tier: Nurse, Spirit
---
A tier: Billy, Hag, Huntress
---
B tier: Clown, Myers
---
C tier: Wraith, Pig, Trapper, Doc
---
D tier:  Freddy, LeatherFace, Legion
---
some combinations might look weirdly wrong in a way, but I'm looking forward to experimenting too! 
---
T-Pose Myers cosmetic confirmed 
---
maybe its also cuz gia had like 0 airtime in that lipsync lol. naomi def did better tho but gia turnt it out a lot more than latrice imo.. like i love u latrice but... the wig reveal was very meh... the split into the the rocking chair hair flip was not stunning... and dont get me started on her wild running around the stage in the first chorus or jist her outfit... if anyone deserved a double shantay it wldve been gia and thats facts america
---
I am gonna go over every killer:
---
Trapper: depends on how the traps work, but they could be quite viable assuming that when a killer steps in a trap, it counts as 1 of the 2 hits needed to finish them.
---
Trapper with addons: traps can become insta kill for other killers, so the trapper could just camp and hope huntress and nurse get taken out (since they can hurt the trapper without risking stepping in a trap)
---
Wraith: can just wait out the match by standing still somewhere
---
Wraith with addons: can just wait out the match by standing still somewhere and then ambush the final killer
---
Hillbilly: being able to insta down other killers is a strong point, other killers will probably try and avoiding hillbilly and hillbilly could get out of sticky situations with his movement speed. He is also able to safely make attacks on other killers, he can chainsaw at them and if they want to guarentee their own safety, they will not try and hitting him and instead will try to dodge him, just make shure to not end your sprint next to another killer.
---
Hillbilly with addons: not much would change really
---
Nurse: Nurse would probably be low tier. They are very slow and if they blink to hit a healthy killer, that killer would probably be able to hit the nurse twice before the nurses stun ends. Nurse will have to constantly blink out of harms way and can only safely go for a kill if the one she is trying to kill is already injured.
---
Nurse with addons: not much would change
---
Hag: I don't see base hag being viable. Only 110% movement speed and she can only teleport away from danger by teleporting to other danger
---
Hag with addons: with the mint rag, the hag can decide when to get out of a fight. With the hand, she is able to get people off of her back, but in the end it will still come down to a battle where she can only use M1 and thus would probably not do very well
---
Doctor: unless insanity has an effect on killers, doctor would be very close to just being a base killer. However, his shock therapy would prevent other killers from attacking (seems logical to me) and he would have no trouble finding that hiding wraith. His shock therapy would also cancel and prevent killers from using their abilities: Nurse and hag can't teleport Michael can't stalk, hillbilly stops chainsaw sprinting, ect.
---
Doctor with addons: his illusions won't do much for him, however, his sniper shock will be handy to fight huntress, preventing her from throwing hatchets and he can weaken escaping or attacking killers from further away.
---
Michael: unpopular tought: they would be screwed. Yes they would be strong in tier 3, but to get to tier 3, they first need to stalk. If other killers are smart, they will take him out at tier 1. He will have a hard time fighting back with his slow movement speed and almost nonexistent lunge. At tier 2 they are merely a base killer and if they ever get to tier 3, he will be a force to be reckoned with.
---
Michael with addons: scratcher mirror would be quite useless I think. There is no pulling killers off of gens. Infinite tier 3 would just make the problem I mentioned above a bigger problem since it takes even longer to get to tier 3. Tombstone would be useless since he can already insta kill other killers without it. So the only viable one in my opinion is the one that lets him reach tier 3 faster, this would make him very dangerous since he will be able to pop his tier 3's in quick succession
---
Leatherface: other killers will leave him be since they don't want to risk getting insta killed, however, the hillbilly and the huntress will have the ability to take him out
---
Leatherface with addons: nothing really changes
---
Huntress: being deadly at both long and close range will make her pretty hard to deal with. The best chance you have at taking her out would be the wraith sneaking up on her or the doctor blocking her hatchet throws, if billy catches her off guard, then she can also go down, but to be honest, billy is not exactly stealthy
---
Huntress with addons: ranged insta downs, there is no way she would lose
---
Freddy: can safely wait the game out and pick his fights, would defenitely be one of the too tier killers
---
Freddy with addons: same as above
---
Amanda (the pig): she would die, yes she can crouch, but other killers would still find her and she doesn't have any abilities that help her prevent attacks or secure kills. Her beartraps wouldn't do anything since downing someone = killing them.
---
Amanda (the pig) with addons: only addons that can help her are her ambush addons, but ambushing wouldn't be very viable since she would have a hard time sneaking up to killers before she gets taken out.
---
The clown: his bottles will make it easier to get away from attackers and will make it harder for killers to retreat, but he would only be slightly better than a base killer.
---
The clown with addons: his instakill bottle could give killers a hard time, but he would still succumb to the huntress or to ambushes
---
The spirit: killers make a lot of noise, so she will have an alright time with locating killers while phasewalking. She would also be hard to hit because of her passive phasing especially the hintress will have a hard time hitting her. Since she can bump into survivors while phasewalking I think it's only fair that she xan also be hit while phasewalking. I think she'd do alright fighting the huntress, but it won't be easy
---
The spirit with addons: increase in passive phasing will make her even harder to hit and being able to ise her powers more will be beneficial
---
The legion: I don't see them winning, they will be an annoyance to anyone they hit and will be ablento speint out of danger, but they can't really kill people while in frenzy, other killers will just hit them if they try going in for a stab.
---
The legion with addons: franks mixtape will make legion more lethal, but they still need to hit other killers 3 times, they will most likely secure a few kills, but I don't think they'll make it in the long run
---
Conclusion: huntress would most likely win and freddy should always be able to secure second place
---
No she does, some people even argue she has a longer lunge but it's the same
---
Nurse
---
Spirit
---
Billy
---
Hag
---
Huntress
---
Clown
---
Myers
---
Wraith
---
Doctor
---
Pig
---
Leatherface
---
Trapper
---
Freddy
---
I dont include legion because I dont consider them a killer. 
---
Yeah, I know, I never said I was dissapointed in the devs, I was just dissapointed in general
---
&gt;Addonless Doc better than Pig, Wraith or LF
---
Agreed
---
Spirit and legion under Freddy???
---
yeah i was on ps4 too literally the only reason i found it was bc i heard it from a laurie that was working on it but i was confused as fuck bc i could hear it but couldn’t see it then saw a floating thing lol 
---
I don’t remember exactly what it was but it was something about nurse being jukeable by making a lot of quick movements
---
I’d agree with this if it wasn’t for the fact of just how much shit Legion got. “They have the most boring, useless kit in the game. You don’t even have to heal against them.” Going from that to “omg they just ruin the game. Legion = DC” just makes it absolutely hilarious.
---
It only works after you stab someone in frenzy
---
Huntress would be able to easyly take out Bubba, all killers would avoid Bubba appart from the huntress. Unless wraith snook up and took out huntress, Bubba would go down.
---
Just hide lol
---
[\*clears throat\*](https://www.thoughtco.com/why-does-grammar-matter-1691029)
---
Im not afraid to say it, Latrice ain’t all that and Im tired of the showing forcing her down our throat it’s Eureka all over again.
---
Fair warning: I tought I'd love playing legion, but I hated playing as them
---
Hmm, I didn't think of that. At least match will end lot quicker for the one getting camped but I see your point.
---
I want this so bad too! No idea how to incorporate this so that it won't be super obvious tho, but I love this idea overall
---
Well I don't use this name on the game obviously. Hmm. Maybe I should change this user name since it lookes like it brings bad luck?
---
Salty, and not even accurate. This is about a new killer :)
---
happy cake day! &lt;3
---
nope clown
---
*laughs in urban evasion*
---
That escalated quickly. Bet you're a blast at parties.
---
I thought about chucky at one point. I also want to see some mythical creatures in there. 
---
And a CoD poster, wich is bad enough by itself.
---
I meant lag in general for all players lol but your right if i could pick a new killer ghost face makes sense for this game although would he be too similar to legion?
---
Bloodied: Oh, so it's like Broken?  
---
Hunter: Yeah both of those would be fine  
---
Parry (killer): Oh, so I DID read it wrong. my bad.  
---
Hard wired: You do have a point there.  
---
On the Hunt: anything to make those Legions less powerful  
---
Parry (survivor): yeah I could see it as a way to distract the killer before you start looping, but maybe it can only happen if they aren't in a chase with anyone. That way you can't be forced to lose the chase.  
---
Vitality: Maybe make the Bloodied effect something like 300/250/200 seconds? Maybe a little lower than that, actually. I just am thinking of this perk as a self-Borrowed Time so you can be a major bodyblocker, or to loop the killer for far longer.  
---
Taunt: Especially compared to the lower-level Parry, it's pretty useless right now, but a rework could fix it.  
---
These perks and the power (And the whole lore of it having two personalities) are all pretty creative, but need just a little bit more balance before they could be normal perks instead of Surveillance-tier or Self Care-tier.
---
Legion; allow me to introduce myself.
---
Imma tell you a little secret
---
*Chases aren’t meant to be won as a survivor*
---
The question should be ‘How long can I run the killer around?’
---
Yay it's been a while since u did these
---
you're in solo lobbies tho. phew.
---
I didn't know that existed lmao
---
I prefer knock out since it can't be removed, although it does have its downsides of the downed being able to crawl to others and empathy countering it, but I'd rather have those than a hex taken out within a minute of them finding out you have it (assuming its not already gone).
---
someone messaged me after a game and they told me i was a really good survivor and it made me so happy i love compliments :-)
---
If the killer is truly dedicated to catching you they often times will eventually catch you before the gates are open. As a survivor getting chased your goal isn't always to escape, but rather to waste as much of the killer's time as possible so that your teammates can do gens. 
---
Super awesome actually 
---
Yeah the ranking system is a little messed up, especially due to rank reset with *no rewards* encouraging people to derank to green/below for actually fun matches instead of the same BBQ/Ruin/Nurses/Sloppy Nurse.
---
Darn, you beat me to it.
---
Potential add-on right there
---
What made up rules besides no face camping or tunneling?
---
what sub am I on
---
You know what’s made me laugh today on my PS4? The countless times I’ve been faced camped, the countless games this morning where none of my random survivors are doing anything except hiding while I work on gens, so they can get a hatch escape. 
---
The game crashing, or killers disconnecting, and being tunneled into oblivion! The bad lag and frame rate issues, music and in game sounds still all over the place, the nurse still sounds like a shotgun going off when she blinks. 
---
So yah it’s made me laugh today and all the devs should have their PC’s taken away from them and be issued PS4’s and Xbox’s to play on so they can live thru are hell! That would make me smile today! 
---
Omg we are everywhere
---
Best part is when you drop exploited and they still managed to save with firecracker karmas a bitch lmao
---
Where are we right now
---
I've stopped doing 3 gen since they nerfed nurse's calling on doc, its just not the same running the sniper build and swatting survivors away without it.
---
Because its boring and ruins the game for the one you are camping/tunneling. 
---
No one gets any points and a boring game 
---
What perks was she using for her lip sync?
---
It’s extremely toxic no matter the rank. You make the game not fun for the person on the hook when you stand there next to them and then immediately kill them after the unhook. Furthermore, I don’t see how that would be fun to the killer. I would think it would be more fun to search for survivors and get in chases than it would be to pay hundreds of dollars for your gaming system to stare at computerized people on hooks. 
---
It was more in a sense of "If you play doc and get the obsession to madness 3, you usually won't get DS'd."  
---
Of course, at red ranks they'll probably still hit it, but I get a 0% hit rate when playing him and I'm at green ranks.

Yeah but game is a small map + good totem spawns + no random walls everywhere like Lery's so once you see a notification on a hex, zoom over there and get free hook

I sit against the the bottom of the couch 
---
Bad what are you talking about Angry Birds is the real shit man 
---
So the prayer beads are what get rid of the 'whoosh' sound effect when the spirit is near you in spirit form?
---
It usually is toxic, because you are denying the survivor you caught to get any more points since they will not be able to play after they have been hooked. Yes, you will win faster, but definitely not because you are being efficient and you are denying yourself quite a lot of points. Going right for another survivor after you have hooked one, gives you more chase points, as well as map pressure, which usually keeps the free survivors from doing gens. 
---
When good survivors know that a killer is camping, they will just do gens and not go for the save. The hooked survivor will die with only a measly 3k bloodpoints, if they're lucky, and you, as the killer, have just been staring at hook nobody will be coming close to. 
---
By letting the hooked survivor go while you chase another one, gives you opportunity to chase them again later on, giving you more points, as well as less opportunity for the survivors to do gens efficiently. 
---
Of course, you can play however you want, but I know from experience that I might only get 2 kills when tunneling and camping before the match ends, but when I keep moving and chasing, I often get 4 kills with only one or two gens done and I double pip with about 30k bloodpoints or more.
---
Sharon  Needles new killer confirmed
---
No, just no   
---
Doc is B tier, Wraith is D. Full Stop.   
---
Nothing else to say to that.   
---
Its agreed upon by the best players that play and pretty much every player.   
---
Accept it or dont but dont say its different.
---
Conceptually and aesthetically I think Legion's great, but I acknowledge his power sucks. 
---
Don't say that man, been called trash for using a pink + purple add-on on Freddy more times than I can count.
---
Yes it does, you're just not hitting someone first.
---
Ok then, instead of allowing direct sale/trade, make it like a WoW auction house, where you put it up for sale only to the public for a price. Good point though, I hadn't considered that.
---
Yeah I'm aware of quiet doc and it is quite fun but I just mean in general 
---
I've always wondered why this game seems to attract alot of LGBT players. Any ideas why?

today i got the adept trapper achievment, and i like the new apron i bought as well
---
Raoul Moat could provide some unique gameplay.
---
You need to have already hit during the frenzy in order to break pallets. And, thats not the most important thing to look for on this character right now.
---
If anything....this could easily maybe get chalked up to a chaos realm thing where some secret order is kidnapping people from other realms to please this said entity but that would be a reach and a half. That said....there isn’t really anything saying EXACTLY where or really what this entity looks for in its killers outside of having a pure killing nature and for that you can look no further than the Tarkata.
---
Technically you could say that during the first invasion of earth realm that the entity could have maybe snatched some of the Tarkata and could be holding them in reserve since the entity, although seemingly great in its power, looks to be trapped in earth realm. However, if this were the case the entity for sure would be removed from it by the elder gods as they would see it as an overall threat to its natural progression. 
---
That would make it less abusable. But a SWF member could just put up an offer at 3 AM and tell their friend to snag it  before anyone else. It would be harder than just outright receiving the items, though, and probably only the type of SWF who screenshares everyone's screens on Discord would do that.
---
Laughs in sole survivor 
---
funny i almost had a 4k but the swing did not hit meg at the the window despite being on her and she got the hatch...which was amusing
---
Well that's just wrong. That's absolutely what boosted has meant and still means to a lot of people. Maybe not in DbD but other games have it. 
---
Follow up: it also gives the Streamers the opportunity to play with fans and by extension have funs cover their ass with instant heals, body blocking, etc.
---
Man THAT is a real kneeslapper
---
Yes
---
Perks the OP likes using, instead of SC/DS/SB/Adrenaline.
---
I only have one tip for that but basically force them to run the loop the wrong way so that they can’t fast vault on the window. Without that they’ll be forced to either throw the pallet much sooner, killing that loop, or they’ll run to another tile.
---
Balanced landing or bust, the utility of this perk makes it endlessly useful, already exhausted? Still suffer zero fall penalty. Run everywhere all the time! While as with sprint burst your diligently trying to conserve your sprint or timing it so that you have just a sliver of exhaustion before you can pop it again. Bonus every map with a big two story building becomes such a pain in the ass for the killer to keep track of you, again that zero fall penalty is amazing and you'll quickly realise how foolish you were for not using Balanced Landing.
---
**Against solo survivors:**
---
S: Nurse (a good one)
---
A: Billy, Spirit
---
B: Hag, Huntress, Myers, Clown, Doctor, Cannibal
---
C: Wraith, Trapper, Pig, Freddy, Legion
---
**Against SWF:**
---
A: Nurse
---
B+: Billy (highly map dependent, also dependent on survivor mistakes if they're on comms)
---
B-: Spirit (add-on dependent)
---
F: Everyone else 
---
The tiers are kind of fluid depending on the survivor composition. The math just isn't on a killer's side against good survivors on voice comms. It's a balance issue. 
---
They said because of budget, not non-humanood characters
---
In general it's now easier to play killer. Many OP survivor tactics hsve been removed (like insta flashlight and infinite loops) and a few mechanics have been added (totems and generator kicking).
---
What I mentioned above has been mentioned by other people, I can't think of extra information. The care game is still the same, but it's less survivor sided now
---
I always save the pink maps so i can use the addons that increase the range and show everyone else where the totems are. 
---
Well it is a team game. You get punished for your teammate's  mistake too. And they gets punished too because they are now doing 3 vs 1 game instead of 4 vs 1. And for the camping it is the sacrifice for the team. Yes you are big fan of the chase but killers like me really enjoys mindgaming. And camping is sometimes viable strage to deploy.
---
Oh it’s a nightmare in low ranks to get them to do anything but yeah, first thing is definitely find the hatch then all can do is try to get them to follow you, if you can’t then don’t worry about it. 
---
Also someone else might be able to shed some light on it but there is a perk that allows you to throw up a beam of light, sort of like a beacon, it may help for those times you’re running a key. 
---
Oh and if you’re on PS4, swing me a message if you want, I’m also on PS4, try and do some SWF sometime. 
---
The worst is when you have the "open an exit gate with X" daily. Desperately tbagging and emoting to try to get your teammates to stop opening it. Lmao
---
You have to remember that the Spirit has a slightly slower Movement Speed. Every Killer has the same default lunge range (except for Myers obviously)
---
If you guys are feeling “short” after all your lunges, it’s most likely either Internet Connections or just the fact that you are lunging too early.
---
I’m pretty sure her Speed is like 4.4/ms which is only a tiny percentage less, but it will make a difference with consideration of Internet Speed/Positioning/How far away you were.
---
Almost everyone is in the wrong tier.
---
Yea, I was kinda refering to that :D 
---
Assuming you're using good add-ons and perks:
---
S+ Nurse
---
S: Billy
---
A+ : Legion, Leatherface, Huntress, Pig (fite me).
---
A: everyone else.
---
B: Trapper. 
---
I literally got to rank 1 by farming and killing nobody.. just to prove how pointless the rank system is.  Play for real at first, 1 hook everyone and I usually get gatekeeper and chaser maxed out. Rank system needs changing big time! 
---
they call me trash with green add-ons saying they're op, what's your point? they also called me wallhacker just because i can hear them breath behind walls. they reported me multiple times. 
---
i said this as rank 1 Freddy main. these two add-ons can't be ultra-rare and there's very little good to them. one is extremely situational because Shroud of Separation rarely works and don't forget that everyone at once know who the killer is. another cripples you to play properly on big maps and they're the majority. 
---
Altruism points / emblem??
---
ohhhhhh biiiiiitch 
---
Aha! I thought I was the only one who noticed that! XD
---
Never ever will I understand the people calling Legion overpowered, it takes days to kill anyone unless you're using a purple addon I've seen one of at level 50. If you think legion is overpowered then I can only assume you've never played it or you don't know how the killer works at all
---
someone care to explain these comments about legion being too good? I get the "it's unfun to play against" thing, that's a valid opinion, but how is it not less fun to play against an actual good killer? like one of the 10+ killers who are better, or straight up just busted like nurse?
---
&gt;softmore
---
The survivor had to have not noticed lol because you literally can't use Lithe if you have Sprint Burst.
---
I hope.
---
My boyfriend was rank 10 at the time I think. Or maybe 11. 
---
The meaning on words can change based on who you’re talking to
---
I just want my WGLF stacks. I'd gladly throw myself in front of a hook if it met I got  double blood points. 
---
I honestly haven’t used a Key in months. They just stockpile on my Characters.
---
Unless you have a SWF Group, most times it ends up being a waste. If you bring it Solo, you’re basically setting yourself up for failure.
---
It’s only useful when 2-3 Survivors have died and you’ve done a few gens as a Team and need a quick escape. If only 1 Survivor has died, usually it’s better to just finish that last Gen rather than go find the Hatch. If nobody dies, just use the Exit Gates. 
---
My Canibal looks literally the same xD Stuck on level 35 xD I want Franklin's though... But I feel so horrible putting bp into this character &gt;.&lt;
---
Those are typically dangerous for survivors without balanced landing in my experience since the fall stun from the box fall will get the killer a hit and the vault onto the hay stack will eventually be blocked by the entity, stoping the survivor from going back, trapping them there for the killer.
---
I didn't know how much I wanted this.
---
Yeah, I'd say blame infinite loading screens, especially since 3-man games or less are on the rise since several weeks ago.  
---
Here's a tip to distinguish a regular game from a 3 man game:  
---
In a regular game, the loading bar will generally take under a minute.  
---
If people are disconnecting, the bar will stop, and then (what I think happens) is upon the player disconnecting/getting disconnected, the loading bar continues.
---
Not really since my description/enquiry was in the general sense, not specifically DbD. 
---
Wait, isn’t the “Woosh” noise map-wide? I thought everyone on the Map heard it.
---
Well if you are high mobility killer like nurse/hillbilly/legion/spirit then it is obvious that running around the map and applying pressure to the geneis more of a way to go. But apart from them most killers are just too slow to effectively apply the pressure. Most likely if you don't camp then another survivor will pluck them off from the hooks and you get nothing in return. That's where the mindgame plays. For survivor and the killer. If you don't camp then you must get something in return to mend for all that time you spent catching that survivor. Will you camp and wait for the survivor to come? Or leave hook unguarded and get something more in return but risk an survivor for it? That's the fun part. But calling camping toxic just leaves out the choice and mindgame part with great opportunity for fun.
---
Its a boring and shitty strategy for someone who cant play the game properly. Im all for camping after gates are powered or tunneling if gens are going to fast but if you legit think its a good thing to tunnel and camp everygame I think your bad honestly.
---
It means more or less no chases occur during the match and survivors are forced to just sit on gens and leave, boring game for all involved 
---
I thought the whoosh sound was 24m.
---
Anyone else remember the Patch a few months ago that let you stun them whenever in the animation you felt like?
---
I remember playing Wraith and picking up Survivors at least 6-7 times, but didn’t hook any of them because I kept getting blinded. Fun times.
---
If you dont want an argument then fine but no i dont agree because of some unofficial tier list (whos tier list btw). Doc and wraith are the same tier, docs probably better but not by much.
---
Running sloppy or thanatophobia with Legion is borderline toxic. Yes I get that it’s part of the game and all that. But when you go up against a 3 gen patrolling Legion with thanatophobia, your odds of winning are extremely slim and the Legion will get a ton of BP.
---
"wrong"
---
This is my tier list. I ranked them based on my preferences. None of them are wrong.
---
June of last year. (June 2018)
---
Update 2.0.0
---
"friendly" 
---
Yeah, just don't like to play them as much as I like Freddy. Plus I love Freddy from the movies, and Spirit and legions designs don't really chalk up to Freddy's in my opinion.
---
2kills? Not likely. 1kills at max and zero if one of them has BT or they bodyblock while you are not running noed. Well for the person being camped can't do anything about them, yes. But it is still win for the team and getting 1 kill for the killer is not exactly satisfactory, so killer will naturally try to get more kills. If you camp someone full time that means you are missing out on all those kills. But why would I leave when I am sure that someone will come to resque the one hooked? As I said that on Asia camping is a strategy. It is the path you could take or not. If you are sure that someone will come then fine. If you are not? Then go search for more survivors. Might be a bad strategy, but strategy nonetheless. And certainly not toxic.
---
Might be the different culture I guess. I play survivor from time to time and when I get camped I feel fine. Sure I get less bloodpoints but I could always kill myself if I wanted to. And that feeling when my team comes for me and we escape all together is...extacic.
---
S: Nurse
---
B: Hag, Myers, Huntress
---
C: Doctor, Clown, Legion, Pig, Trapper
---
D: Freddy, Wraith
---
S(hit): Leatherface
---
I love Pig, I think they're really fun to play and their design is cute. 
---
r/ihavereddit
---
I don't get it.  Normally, RBT doesn't go this fast, do they?  I got the RBT when there were 3 gens.  By the time it's 2 gens, it shouldn't be this close to death. 
---
At any rate, after this I was done for the day.  Everyone seems to be playing pig today due to dailies and I can't deal with the stress of removing another RBT.
---
I love the Pig for her end-game potential. ALWAYS save your Headtraps for when there are 2 or less Gens left. Nothing is more fun than chasing a trapped Survivor while the exit gates are opened.
---
I find that happens with Pig a lot though, due to her slow Crouch Speed and sneakiness, you’re better off defending 3 certain gens and doing the 3-Gen Strategy since she can ambush quickly and punish whoever she found easily.
---
And this is why mirror Myers is my favorite build on him lol
---
Ace mains represent
---
Oh boy, quite alot of them, i'm going to try to list as many as i can, even very weird ones i've found on the steam forums and in my after game chat:
---
- Giving the last guy the hatch, especially after a 3V1 or if he kobe's
---
- Not using "crutch" perks, addons, "items" or killers / survivors because ITS TAXIC.
---
- No "genrushing" or "Killrushing" ( Both are ridiculous, but i saw that in my game chat and even on steam forums so it counts as a made up rule).
---
- DC'ing is okay if things aren't going in your favor or if you are facing Legion
---
- Farming if survs wants the killer to farm, otherwise you are a toxic player, goes in the other way also, killers calling out survs for no farming if he wanted to.
---
- Not looping because "it takes no skill" 
---
Pretty sure i forgot about some, but that's already quite alot, also not a rule but the whole "you shouldn't play the game if you're internet isn't good", while i get how it's frustrating to deal with lag, people REALLY love lecturing others (and insulting them) about that and how they should get "better" internet even tho it's not even their fault that it suddenly decides to dies/lag out of nowhere.
---
Omg so happy to see other drag race fans on here!!! My two favorite things!
---
that‘s some thicc dwight
---
Yeah I don't care much for Kate she had it coming 😂
---
The Thing, a shapeshifter would be fantastic for the game and The Thing would just be so freaky. You would just need to plan around how the killer works with SWF in the game 
---
It's a shame because the highs of this game are some of the best out there. But there's a 50% chance the experience will just be garbage between the dc's, bugs, toxicity, and ranking system that causes absurd leaps in difficulty from one game to the next at the same rank. 
---
I unironically think that freddy isnt the worst killer dont kill me thanks
---
My opinion is really weird. I used to hate Nurse but I've gotten okay at her. My least favorite is Billy, my favorite is Pig... My personal tier list is all screwy compared to the tiers generally accepted by most people, I think
---
Legion mains unite
---
Then he’d be viable at rank 1
---
I believe you can use steam achievement manager to modify your rank so that you’re permanently rank 12 or something. Be warned that this can be detected by EAC and thus be banned. 
---
Spirit is top 3
---
This. It messes me up every single time a video has pings in it, and it actually tampers with my enjoyment.
---
Probably a tampered timer add-on. Reduces RBT time by 30 seconds.
---
That's cool, I just don't like her. I respect people who do, her design is cool and stuff, and I think it takes skill to use her, but I don't think she's fun to play so I stay away from her
---
Step 1) Play Freddy
---
Step 2) Find Survivor 
---
Step 3) stand right next to them while they’re hiding in the corner, looking for you
---
I just love watching their Character just instantly freeze up, hoping I don’t find them. I made a Bill sit still until he had a Crow, I love scaring people with the loud Freddy lullaby
---
I respect your opinion its cool
---
No. I am not saying you should camp everyone. As I said, it is a strategy. One may camp at first hook and leave for other survivors at the second hook so survivors will not approach that hook. Or you could not camp at the first hook and camp at second hook and you get a survivor walking into your trap. All I am saying is that camping and tunneling is a strategy and is not a toxic behavior. If you just brand something toxic it just leaves out all the mindgames that you could be doing with that strategy. 
---
Maybe, I wonder what his power would be
---
Considering he replied with the same tasteless Trump meme again? Yeah.
---
Yeah but people message you salt anyways 
---
**Claudette** gets seen.  
---
**Ace** leaves the basement.  
---
**Meg** decides not to bring Sprint Burst.  
---
**Jake** does something productive instead of sabotaging.  
---
**Laurie** doesn't bring Decisive Strike.
---
So you have distressing, Ruin and BBQ? 
---
I run the classic "Asshole Build" aka anti-skillcheck for 3-gens. Distressing for larger terror radius, Unnerving for harder skillchecks as well as Overcharge for more gen regression and hard skillchecks when you kick a gen, (they stack with unnerving and become harder than DS I believe.) 
---
Last perk is your choice. I'd run Ruin or Huntress lullaby for slowing the game down more or harder skillchecks, but tbh Hex Perks kinda are hit or miss if they get cleansed early, and I don't have either, so I run BBQ.
---
Either way unnerving is great on doc, since it affects people in your terror radius, and with doc you want a large terror radius as possible + with doc's random skill check placement it can get really hard for survivors. 
---
Exactly my point, another nurse being mad that anybody even talks about legion
---
PC
---
lol i meant self care but maybe i should've put the actual perks instead of abbreviations  
---
but in my eyes spine chill is meta
---
Music=Sound 
---
Tell that to the people who DC against them.
---
I mean some of those are pretty justified. 
---
DCing while getting moried just means you don’t have to watch it the killer still gets points, camping is just as toxic as DCing and it’s not like they’re gonna get saved anyways, moonwalking with franks is understandable to not want to waste time with, and DCing when the killer slugs you to find the last guy just helps your team. 
---
Self care
---
Oh lmao of  course I thought scary cat was a hint but yeah self care is in *the build*
---
There’s a difference between challenging and impossible. 
---
Even solo queue takes forever right now on PS4, so it's not just a SWF issue. Also, SWF groups can only be placed in lobbies that have room for them and so they have lower priority than solo players. If a lobby already has one or two solo players, it already becomes impossible to add a group of 3 or 4. Also, difference in region between members of a SWF group can influence where and how fast you get matched.
---
Well, I mean... What do you mean by best killer? I just ranked them based on their design and how much fun I had while playing them. I guess a lot of the people that are down voting are thinking I meant that those were the most successful killers. 
---
Though, even if I was ranking on most successful... I do win the most with Pig. It's likely having to do with the fact that I play Pig more than any other killer, but regardless I get more wins with Pig than with, say, Spirit or Billy.
---
Probably drops together with the event, so hopefully sometime this week
---
&gt; I mean some of those are pretty justified.
---

Um not talking about ingame music, but club etc. xD
---
I just wanna see Jason in a game that doesn't look like it's dying. Also, I won't give up on the idea that Jason will come to DbD as the 13th killer.
---
I have no supporting facts, just blind idiotic faith.
---
If you mean the build in the video, she's running Alert, Technician, Quick and Quiet, and Detective's Hunch, and healing herself with a medkit. The reason the bar is red is because of the Nurse's Thanatophobia.
---
Me and my friends personally only experience the SWF's issue but I'm not surprised if solo queuing is also taking a while.
---
Honestly, for the free characters its not really worth buying their perks in the shrine. Sure, you save some time from leveling. But the shards could be used for better things like DLC perks, different characters or cosmetics. 
---
Nice video buddy, but when killers do scummy stuff I’m gonna continue to be scummy back
---
I just played david with WGLF to farm bp and put them into him
---
I don't mean that I meant like the common build, as in crutch perks
---

---
As a Feng main, I feel your pain and I now worry about running into you in the fog.
---
When I play survivor I change my tactics based on what that nurse does, that's what you're supposed to be doing, if they are going to go to the corner, then keep running, if they don't, then juke them.  
---
Nurses are also supposed to adapt to what survivors are doing to trick the
---
Even a good Nurse player still has some means of counterplay and more interaction with the survivor than most killers, I'd take the nurse over most killers.  
---
Shantay you stay
---
Higher score usually means nothing if you don't get kills. Maybe this is the reason that sets camping as toxic or not in the asia? Unless I go for bloodpoint farming I usually go for the kills. And staring at the survivor is a way to play a game. If they don't come then I get a single kill or no kill at all and it is not very fun. But if they come and I managed to hook two of them at the same time......Now that is great. Sure chasing someone can be fun if you manages to down someone at the end, but leaving the hook and chasing someone for full 3 minutes and not getting a single kill is really not a great way to play a game, especially if that someone is from higher rank and used SWF just to taunt lower rank killers. Since most survivors manages to loop killers for at least a minute or two, it is very hard to get kills not mention hooks unless you mix it up with camping and tunneling.
---
And bbq does not show the survivors that are in the closet.....So most of the time even I hook someone with BBQ I can't see anyone out there.
---

Don’t worry, I was going to leave it out
---
I just don’t understand what’s so bad about him, people say the person has to be brain dead to play him but I find that completely false, just because you can vault pallets and cancel loops, doesn’t make you broken
---
Ah ok. 
---
Honestly though, are cleansing all the dull totems worth it? Because if they do have Noed, and you thought you got rid of all the dulls, you are now hunting the entire map for 1 totem. Might as well just leave 2 that you remember and check them when the last gen is done no? 
---
Exactly
---
I had a match on ps4 where I had no HUD.  No visible skill checks.  I could not see progress on gens or anything else.   Now I understand why some survivors are  d/cing.  
---
I should have known better than to care about anything besides memes on this sub.
---
With the attitude some survivors have the devs are going to continue releasing killers with no skill ceiling. Since people believe that skill shouldn't be rewarded and that a killer should be forced to rely completely on survivor fuck ups.
---
Hey its not fear its just nerves and being angry because killer is brainless and don't have any balance( franks mix tape) 
---
By best killer most people mean strongest and most effective in getting downs and kills. If I were to rank killers on fun, wraith would be s tier, but I admit that he is indeed c tier at best.
---
O P E N T H E C H E S T
---
I mean if you play someone like Freedy with his one yellow perk and no addons it's a given that you don't plan on winning.
---
Aww, I’m glad you think that!
---
Checkmate: The Knights have no ability in destroying pallets, but at the same time, they cannot be stunned, blinded or burned, The Queen herself, however, can be burned if she is shone in the face whilst in the process of switching control between her movement and her Knights, which the charge time would alter with add ons.  Once the Queen has changed control, she cannot be stunned, burned or blinded, and the visual light of flashlights and firecrackers will not be shown to her in order to have a better view of the pursues survivors and her Knights.  The Knights, however, can vault windows, at a 50% faster speed than the Queen vaults windows (which is naturally 5% faster than most killers anyway)  I didn’t actually think about pallets and vaults at first so thanks for this!
---
Thoughtfulness: Dang it, forgot about that.  May change the perk slightly to activate after performing altruistic actions on teammates as well.
---
Lmao thanks a lot of my friends love that show but I never gave it a chance 
---
I got adept David yesterday. I don’t think you understand how relieved I am.
---
Not sure. Does that even really make a noise?
---
I always save the pink items so i can never use them
---
Pinhead. Just don't know how they would implement him without making the survivors salty. Since if you've seen Hellraiser, the lament configuration is a son of a bitch to deal with.
---
But I guess you can’t convince a majority of this community :P
---
Yeah, I guess it's just u and me 
---
I don’t think so because BBQ literally never pops up, though I swear I saw it once one time last year. 
---
So this is like DBDs version of the people painting the people who painted the people.
---
Need me a black ice
---
UNLESS...
---
We make a legion alliance.
---
We can all change our user flairs to legion alliance and try to change the world
---
Honestly could be kinda funny tho
---
Ooo
---
That's when you break down and use Nurse or Billy and equip an Ebony against a squad. That happened to me. I used Clown, got destroyed, last guy gets away because of DS and sprints about a quarter of the way through the map. No way in hell I could catch them. Of course they wait at the gate to tea-bag. 
---
That was my "fuck it" moment and now I almost exclusively use Billy. But I am warming up to Legion. 
---
BTW: even with Billy/Nurse and an Ebony Mori, you still might only get 2 kills against a 3-4 man SWF squad. It's better to just avoid them. 
---
I change my name to "Running Dailies" when I am doing rituals 
---
Yeah, that's fine, I don't really care if people just disagree. 
---
As for Wraith, people seem really inclined to murder him with flashlights. I had one really really bad game with him against a sfw and I think that kinda ruined my Wraith forever. I do have him at prestige 2 so I might try him again someday
---
Borrowed time only matters if you camp and tunnel. 
---
Same with doctor madness too. Your scream location will be revealed even if you're running Distortion. However if they have aura reading add ons, those can be hidden.
---
Fucking hated Gia
---
Would recommend hitting the unhooker instead. As for dead hard just wait a little bit before you swing, few survivors will be expecting you to respect the dead hard.
---
I've been wondering if suvirvors should be told that the killer has NOED at the beggining of a match. Cause it's only when NOED is present that dull totems actually become objectives, any other time you would  be wasting time cleansing them.
---
This is something a lot of killers don't seem to grasp. They don't go farther than 5 meters from a hook, tunnel the survivor who got unhooked, then complain about BT.
---
Also, 4 hits? OP you've been taking something? BT is only 1 hit.
---
Okay lets do some math
---
chapter 11 I guess in march
---
chapter 12 I guess in June/July
---
chapter 13 I guess in September/October
---
This year in september we will have friday the 13th.
---
So the 13th chapter on friday the 13th
---
I could really see this happening.
---
Same with DS use enduring/rancor
---
Hey thank you so much!!!! Are you 100% sure about it? 
---
I'd switch Myers and Clown personally.
---
He just corrected me, his is 27 inch, it just looks so funny sitting on a speaker right next to my 50inch 😅
---
Sounds good!
---
T I S F O R B I D D E N 
---
They play on Xbox what do you expect (jk OP you are still valid)
---
The BBQ change was very recent and most survivors don't make use of it. Maybe they are working on a gen and you just don't see them because their aura is partially blocked by the gen aura. 
---
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is: camping is a low-effort, low-skill way of playing that makes it unfun for 4 out of 5 people playing that match. Do what you want, but know that I and many other survivors will not be playing nice to camping killers. You play toxic? Then the survivors will also play toxic. A killer applies map pressure and interacts a lot with other things than a hooked survivor? Then I will also play fair and accept my loss when I win. The game doesn't allow 3 hooks before death so a killer can just stare a hooked survivor in the eyes until they die. It's a strategy, but more often than not a bad one as well as a toxic one if the killer instigated it without reason. If a survivor goes out of his way to be toxic, camping and/or tunneling can be a good payback. But know that when survivors play fair and get caught in the end only to be camped, you are a toxic killer, no matter where you are from.
---
I think that’s what the Legion does anyway, try to change the world XD
---
but I’m down for it :3
---
This game is designed for people who want an easy win so they can keep buying those stupid cosmetics. I'm glad I got it right before PS plus because I pretty much exhausted it. It's about money and keeping the thing baby survivors who complain about bad manners happy and I gurantee u most of them are young kids. 
---
Yeah, I've been using Billy lately. I don't like Nurse, unfortunately. Spirit can hang a bit too. They've made it hard to tell though since survivors are joining lobbies at once now most of the time regardless of solo queue or not. I have a feeling BHVR doesn't realize that queue times might get really bad if enough killers like myself get frustrated with the imbalance vs SWF and just start playing other games. At least give me a bloodpoint boost for my troubles against SWF. 
---
probably the part when he explicitly said he was proud to be gay if i just had to take a wild guess 
---
&gt;I need 4 hits to take down a single survivor after he got unhooked
---
uhm, why? 
---
Nope. When you hear the whoosh it means the spirit in nearby when phasing
---
It is. I have to wait up to 20 minutes sometimes ever since the winter solstice event ended. I started playing killer more to actually be able to play the game without crazy wait times. The lobbies usually fill up within seconds, too. Either matchmaking is fucked or people stopped playing the game and there aren't enough killers.
---
Nope
---
If you don’t go for the first person you tag you’re abandoning chase which allows the person to just fail a skill check while you’re trying to put everyone in the dream state. 
---
Candyman or pinhead
---
Well, who you *wanna* down isn't necessarily who you *gonna* down
---
You have given me more hope and happiness. Thank you.
---
Im not toxic and arrogant. Please dont generalize people for the survivor they use.
---
The problem is I am a horrible survivor XD
---
U let the obsession go 3 times? And use stacks during frenzy of they heal? Damn I want to see u at rank 1 in my games
---
Honestly you're not wrong. I defend the nurse constantly but this is true.
---
Or that they’re naturally whiners like the majority of survivors.
---
Holy shit. So I just watched it this time (didn't have time previously, so just guessed), and used the time codes to confirm I was wrong. That wasn't a tampered timer. That was the normal 2.5 minutes. And you got it off at *literally* the last second. It activated at 2:24, meaning detonation would have been at 5:54, you removed it at 5:53.
---
You're lucky it wasn't a tampered timer, you'd have died about half way to the last box. 😂
---
But it's not heard if you're in her husk's terror radious
---
I have noticed a longer Solo Survivor wait time.
---
Thats where I am for. Also can I inform you that the Pig is cute.
---
Prayer beads remove the whoosh sound yes. But remember that you will not hear her phasing anyways when in her terror radius.
---
most of the time when i vault back on a legion, it still messes them up and they'll whiff hits. if they manage to connect then i'll mix it up by faking a pallet vault and running behind them. legion's inability to see scratch marks means that you can lose them that way if they commit to the idea that you doubled back or ran in your initial direction. but idk no counterplay literally anyone can play this killer i guess.

If they join at the same exact time then they're most likely a squad. Especially if they load in with items. Failing that, look at their friend's list. 
---
Unfortunately, BHVR still doesn't have adequate competition since Last Year landed with a thud and F13 is dead. The lack of competition allows BHVR to not be forced to fix glaring issues because where else are Killer Mains going to go? Not to mention that Survivors outnumber us 4 to 1. They'll bend over backwards for Survivors while giving Killers some table scraps (Oh joy! Now Survivors can't see my perks and add-ons when they die and tell their buddies. It only took 3 years for this to happen).
---
There's a lot of ways to fix SWF with mics. The easiest would be just removing SWF completely but, like I said, they don't want to piss off Survivors so that's never going to happen. The other solution would be slowing down the game (ala secondary objectives) but they're still dragging their feet on this. Last October, Horvath was talking about making Blood Warden a base ability for all Killers and changing the end game. WTF happened? WTF happened to the DS nerf? WTF happened to the Freddy re-work? WTF happened to the totem re-work? Do we have to wait until after the next Killer/Survivor come out so QOL changes that should have been done eons ago can finally be done? 
---
Barrowed Time isn't overpowered.
---
What rank r u playing at? If they arent at a loop by the time u hook the survivor after getting hit and u hooking, then that will change as u climb 
---
i rush to the hook and the first hit doesnt even register when the survivor gets unhooked because why not, second hit activates "Borrowed time", third hit misses due to dead hard, forth hit finally takes him down, if you're playing legion multiply those hits with 5
---
and removes the skill 
---
So go for the unhooker? If you are far enough from the hook anyway borrowed won’t go off. Borrowed is not overpowered at all
---
Fake. The amount of dcs is too low.

Let's be honest, freddy is not the worst killer. I get to rank 1 with him consistently, I run him with no perks or addons and 4k against good survivors consistently. He's just a killer you can't play like most. If you tunnel, you will get genrushed. I beg of you, if you want to hear more, pm me.
---
I don’t think you understand what tier lists are for. Not to be a douche, or anything. 
---
As a straight male, I attest to being able to appreciate a well oiled man and love to watch drag queens waaaaaaark. There are dozens of us!
---
Because you also play with non-Asian players from time to time. The fact that you keep the same playstyle will be considered toxic and so you shouldn't complain when those players are calling you out, because, who are you to judge, who plays in the Asian region, that camping and tunneling is not toxic when you do play outside your region?
---
You aren't doing anything wrong, just Freddy sucks big time

Gurl I was all the Gia vs Naomi ls. the whole thing was an elaborate ploy to bring Latrice back and save Valentina from another elimination. I was fuming when Latrice got a shantay and for the first time watching the show I was actually shaking/shivering because I truly believed that Monique was going to get sent home over her when obviously Gia did way better. Then they gooped us. 😂
---
When the killer just downs you and somebody repairs the last gen
---
The best is if the last survivor was super toxic and you have mori, drop them near the hatch then mori before they get in
---
S tier: nurse   
---
Z tier: anyone else  
---
I wish that was true. But on PS4, many Pigs tend to go after someone trying to remove their RBT.  That's why she got that Feng instead of the Meg.  I'm guessing the Meg was too good at evading that she decided to go after Feng instead.  Pretty sure in this match we all got an RBT on our head except for Meg.  Opening that exit was actually nerve-wrecking. 
---
Yeah tier lists are based on overall viability, bias aside (though most tier lists have a lot of bias) 
---
Leather face S tier
---
Neami is using urban evasion that's why you never found her while chasing Meg.

„If you’re homeless just buy a house”
---
Why did she come back? Just stupid or because of Doctor's power?
---
When a survivor runs, they leave red marks on the ground and surrounding environment for a few seconds or so. 
---
When a survivor runs they leave behind red marks behind them that last for around 10ish seconds. They look like bright red scratches that are on the ground general vicinity of where a survivor runs.
---
Is this a power I can learn?
---
&gt;be survivor
---
&gt;blow skill check
---

---
I started doing this recently and noed has been a much smaller pain in my ass. I just finish the gens then check on 1 or 2 totems I know the locations of and a lot of the time it actually is one of them. While also praying that the killer doesn’t find me first 
---
At the rate it's taking them to rework freddy, I'd prefer deletion
---
He was asking about what killer to buy so I didn't write free killers. Pig is half because she charge the ambush and uses a trap. The difference is that that trap does not work before the chase like Hag and Trapper.  
---
I would put Hillbilly and Nurse in Charge, Huntress in Shooting and Trapper in Trap
---
Well that’s part of the game play. Survivors still get gens done way to fast at high ranks/really any rank with right perks or just a couple toolboxes. Keeping noed in the air keeps the fear of it there and the point where you have to make a decision if you want to go for dulls or not. It’s not the best thing for extending the game but let’s face it, the developers probably won’t think of a better one
---
Game starts, hear chainsaw, walk 10 steps, down... :( 
---
Why would they delete a whole ass killer
---
Maybe something like that, or replaced something and forgot to change one of the exhaustion perks?
---
🥄🍲🥣
---
I like how that's become the stereotype for Jake, when the opening movie shows him being the only productive one. :P
---
A tip I never found anyone say, but is SUPER helpful, if you m2 a person who is transitioning to dream state, it speeds up. So you should be fast enough to scare them away
---
Addons, yes. But party streamers? No. You get a bonus for having people DC and it still counts as a kill for you as far as I can tell. They probably helped you by DCing
---
Thx! I'll do that from now on!
---
Me when playing DBD on free weekend and seeing two people get grabbed off a single unhook while my game stutters at 8 fps  
---
Also, Trapper was looking directly at him at the very end so it seems like he gets a gg ez 4k bb survivors 1 gen done.
---
The way toxicity is defined in DbD is very simple.
---
I don't like this, therefor it is toxic.
---
So thats like 10 chests in game? what kind of spawn hell would happen to the chests I wonder. 
---
All the survivors downvoting and defending each other in the comments, lol
---
I like this training. 
---
Then i'm guessing it's the height diFFerence that is screwing with you.
---
OK, add me: DeltaForce2005 
---
I’m still new to the game and focusing on survivors.
---
funny that you say that considering the man in this picture is straight lol
---
You're right, it's in this kind of situation that the key can help, as a last resort item.
---
As DahrkMatter said, it's much better if you find the hatch beforehand, or if you're on a map where you can easily find it. But aside from that, yeah, it's one of the less interesting items in the game for me. I wonder if the key was in the base game or if it was added when they created the SWF option ? 
---
jesus is a biscuit 
---
I never claimed the pit crew guys were default gay because they get paid to wear Speedo’s lol. I was talking more about the drag queens themselves. 
---
Bump. I would like to know the answer to this as well
---
have you seen the trappers muscles
---
Well yes I seemes to misred that. Sorry. it seemes I got carried away and misinterpreted your intentions. And I understand that it is considered toxic to the western players. I do not expect them to suddnly see camping as not toxic. I just wanted to show them my point of view and try to convince them. Now I will try to change my playstyle when I meet with players from other regions. Thanks for telling me westerner's point of view.
---
It's a mind game on both ends guys lol
---
I’ll wait until the next shrine just to be safe but if it’s not there I’ll pull the trigger. Thanks for the help.
---
Swf?
---
Spine Chill users do not interact
---
All these people are trying to tell you how to escape chases and it's kind of misleading. Escaping a chase is unreliable and requires the killer to make a mistake to work. Its harder then hiding but when you're good enough, you'll want to just loop the killer for as long as possible rather than hiding as you're wasting more of his time that way and take less risks. Here are some good videos on actually surviving chases.

im a survivor main so replace it with a disconnect icon
---
Devs have talked about all questions like this. Mod that just changes visuals or audio for fun? They don't care. But if the anti cheat finds you then theg say it's you're problem and they won't care.
---
Just buy Leatherface. I waited 4 months for BBQ to be in shrine so I just bought Bubba and leveled him up. Plus his other perks aren’t too bad. 
---
Sound like you just don’t know how to play killer. Don’t fucking tunnel and you won’t have these problems. Killer main here btw in case you want to blame your downvotes on “salty survivors”.
---
removing or changing files always has its risk it prob not worth it
---
Sadly not. Can only grab people out of lockers that are not in the dream state. Any other action that can be interfered is only possible when the survivor enters the dream state.
---
No you can't. You will get perma banned. 
---
I'm actually wondering if you read your own comments and still think you didn't contradict the fuck out of yourself
---
I don’t believe there is an easy way to edit the audio files, anything that can’t be easily edited can most likely be banned for
---
Well you put the Doctor's Madness debuff so it would likely imply Doctor
---
No sorry,but you can get banned, unfortunately tampering with the game files is in violation of their easy-anticheat. BHVR won't ban you personally if they happen to see your stream and you're playing with custom icons or audio, but if the easy-anticheat catches you they also won't unban you.
---
99% of killers i go against literally do this lmao, they get looped for over 2 geni's and then they facecamp. its always like this lmao

S: 4K Killer
---
A: 3K Impressive Killer

B: 2K Baby Killer

C: 1K Sad Killer

Shit: Could not even find the Survivors Killer
---
That's how you Rank them. It works on my machine.
---
Ruin obviously, BBQ, bitter murmur, Devour Hope, DEFINITELY ENDURING so you can be more gutsy with your dashes, STBFL for recovery from dashes, spirit fury with enduring go again help with dashes, and NOED

---
"Escape with insertlevel1survivorhere 1 time."
---
"hell no"
---
"Mori someone with this Level 1 killer."
---
yeah devs have been rediscovering novels they read in high school
---
"If anyone disagrees with me they are just a stupid survivor main UwU"
---
Tuck your clothes into the drawer you monster
---
Literally the truth tho
---
Not if you set messages to friends only. I have so many friend requests now.
---
That's how mafia works. 
---
Since when does holding the transition on a transitioning survivor speed it up? it is 7 seconds flat, and that can't be changed without addons.
---
Calm down Satan.
---
Imagine the killer having the same name as all 4 survivors...
---
So it reduces the chances of getting a skill check while in the dream world. The addons that do that are actually very good because survivors will try to fail a skill check to get out of the dream world, and those addons reduce he chances of getting one. Pretty much all of Freddy’s addons are great, especially Class Photo (even though I don’t use it). 
---
Atleast it's not No mither, Self-care and Botany Knowledge.
---
legion mains unite
---
????? Comparing africans starving to a killer not knowing when to break chase in a video game. i’ve officially seen it all on this subreddit
---
I don't need to face camp to wreck your ass.
---
Wool Shirt - "Slightly decreases Skill Check chances in the Dream World."
---
It lowers the chances for survivors to wake up from the dream world by lowering the chance of a skill check. Being woken up by another survivor is not affected.
---
anal beads
---
That could definitely help, although 5% speed bonus each might be a bit much haha
---
Rank 1 isn't a measurement of skill. It only shows that the player has atleast half a brain and understands for the most part how the game works. Thats why I use the measurement of "bad player" and "good player" instead of using ranks. Rank 1 can be good, but it can also be bad. 
---

Ok you can't always get out of the terror radius in time but ok y'all keep disagreeing I don't really care

Sorry, I meant to say that it would work like NOED where one dull totem becomes an active hex totem and gives the bonuses( 5% mov. Speed and Bloodlust tier taking less time to activate)

---
I would like to see Jason with a big ass machete

Nerf SWF?
---
At what moment should the killer know when to stop chasing a survior?
---
Yeah but in order to be fixed the devs have to actually rework him and we've been waiting for a freddy rework for over a year
---
NeRf gAme
---
Maybe they’ll be faster with legion
---
Ru should name more of her songs like DbD perks. These two fandoms would combine and create one, bloody, covered in glitter, tongue-popping monster. Dragula who?
---
Wraith in the same category as Freddy? I don’t think you’ve been using wraith correctly...
---
Why are you playing killer
---
The perfect image doesn’t exi...
---
It does suck to be found first exponentially if it is multiple times in a row but that's the name of the game and if he had internet that would DC randomly and it chooses right after I put him in my shoulders. He has the greatest wingman anyone could ask for. 
---
Also on PS4, and yeah, there are definitely bad Piggies. But anyone who wastes time in a trapped Survivor either doesn't understand the Pig or isn't confident as her. When I play Pig, if I come across a trapped Survivor I'll smack them, if I don't have to go out of my way to do it, because a slugged Survivor keeps 2 people off if gens, or I'll chase them away from a box so they have to start over, but I won't commit to a full chase unless there's at least 3 RBTs in play. It's a waste of my time and a loss of pressure otherwise.
---
And yeah, bigger maps make RBTs more dangerous because boxes can be more spread out, and Ormond is pretty sizeable. I want to try a 6 box build on there after the new patch hits with its crouching buff and I can safely ignore the Combat Straps.
---
No it doesn't? It rewards you for your swf rushing gens while you do safe loops.
---
Focus all your anger on not having a skin for year of the pig and kill.
---
*laughs in scratched mirror myers*
---
Play how you want to play, but if it makes you feel bad, then stop. It's really sweet of you to try to please everyone, but unfortunately many players (both killers and survivors) are assholes and will abuse your kindness.
---
Not saying you should just facecamp everyone, but if a survivor is being toxic to you (teabag etc.) then don't bother trying to be nice to them. Respect goes both ways. 
---
At the end of the day, it's a game, and sure it's considerate to take everyone's fun into account, but you should think about yourself first. 
---
I'm afraid I don't master the anime/manga style. Otherwise I would have put a trap in there somewhere too
---
As long as you don't straight up hypertunnel or facecamp it's on the survivors to not fuck up and your not ruining anyones game. And if you're playing Pig luck is a big part of her concept, if you happen to find the survivor in the first box they search, well, bad luck.
---
It's like the hatch thing. If you want to give it to the last survivor because God knows why, do it. If you want the 4K, hook him. There's no right or wrong answer. It's not about what your are supposed to do, it's about what you WANT to do. I sometimes give the hatch, sometimes not.
---
I'm not sure what to do with DS and I'm glad I don't have to make that kind of decision. If you asked me though, I feel like it shouldn't've ever been added anyways but I also feel the same about a Mori. 
---
the point is that it's a joke you moron.
---
Survivors with really bad ping will sometimes teleport around, which makes it difficult to hit them. Plus it can’t be any fun for them either.
---
I use franklins demise like every other game. Yes it’s situational but when u play in higher rank and people are bringing purple toolboxes and insta heal med kits every game along with flashlights then it’s almost a necessity to have
---
Rank 9 tho 
---
I play killer because I enjoy the solo aspect, and to be blunt, I loved huntress and started playing her and now I’m a killer main
---
Just buy leatherface you will probably never see it in the shrine again until like 2030. It took me about a week to level him up which isn’t bad. 
---
That was likely NOED. It’s pretty much the best killer perk so everyone uses it
---
I did that once I was changing my build and didn't realise I was ready in the lobby
---
I bet they assumed you had scratched mirror lol smfh 
---
I would’ve been fucking triggered if I was the killer
---
Sloppy butcher is great on anyone
---
Yes. You are being too nice
---
This idea that you need to be fair and make sure, as killer, that survivors have fun is a load of shit that managed to penetrate the conversation about the game in a meaningful way because survivor mains whine about it all the time.
---
The only time you should "play nice" is if a teammate sandbags or if you can tell they're quite a bit below your own skill level
---
Mm, i do have times where I desperately wanna kill that one guy teabagging constantly and generally being a prick. I just don’t wanna deal with them whining afterward, I care too much about others, I’ll try playing a little less forgiving, and see how it goes from now on
---
hey bro , can i use it as my profile image on instagram ? @angry_huntress on insta. its a meme page 
---
Well Legion doesn't waste time whiffing attacks and it isn't like the survivor magically becomes invisible with loss of scratch marks. There really isn't counterplay if the Legion has normal spatial awareness. Their power is recharged fully upon the first successful hit and it also innately allows them to miss multiple times before even being punished for it.
---
Please keep any discussions civil and providing solutions to the problem. Not just memes and constant fighting between survivor and killer "mains". :) &lt;3 
---
I play survivor and killer. Honestly I find killer more fun to play but I do play survivor a bit more so I can play the game with a friend. I typically get 3 or 4 kills every time. I use the skills I pick up playing survivor and apply them to my killer play. I think if people only play killer or only play survivor you are going to have a tougher time because it makes it more difficult to predict players. Killer definitely can be frustrating at times but I've never had a time where I felt survivors were too op (swf can be annoying but not op in my opinion). It could be due to the fact that I've never been higher than rank 8 as a killer though 😂 
---
It’s pretty easy to get steamed after a few games of p3 LF’s camping and p3 Claudette’s farming you and fucking sending hate mail. Not joking. The killers send less hate mail. 
---
Yeah so then what? make Exit gates opening time 40 seconds long? You get my point right? i said you cant properly kill anyone because the in 1 minute 2 gens pop. My suggest was it to stretch out the game by making the gen working time longer so the killer can even find survivors.
---
Spirit fury works well with killers who use use brutal strength and killers with a chainsaw. 
---
I think the best way to describe Legion, is they're anti-swf, the perks counter teamwork and the ability is best used when they cluster in a group, or against a pallet looper. Separate survivors it's a long chase, but disruption of the whole team is far more effective. 
---
If it makes you feel any better, killers at rank 15-13 have a similar issue, where a lot of survivors are deranked in groups to mess with them. It's so frustrating because it seems like when I play survivor I'm always with other new players, but then when I switch to killer it's against a squad who have all the gens done in like 2 minutes with full meta perk loadouts. I had a particularly nasty game yesterday where they had the gens nearly finished by the time I got my first hook and I had no perks or addons on Bubba but bbq 1. I wound up just walking into the basement and waiting for them to leave after I ate my third decisive strike trying to find a hook they hadn't sabotaged. It took them FIFTEEN MINUTES to leave. 
---
Lol I don’t know
---
Memes and History go hand in hand together nowadays. Unless they fight a war against anime.
---
That perk ruins lives
---
7/8th killer? If you've surpassed Rank 1 i doubt you got there being overly nice.
---
Very well written, I just wonder when they will hear her lullaby!
---
Emergency Medkits are the new meta.
---
People seem to think that if they have to learn how to be good at a game, that it’s bad. 
---
Problem is that if I’m the first to be found a lose my pip almost all the time. I always get farmed. I’m horrible at stealth and without Urban it’s even harder. I am at rank 15 with rank 1 killers and new or farming players.
---
Dude, you're British. How can you use EU and Europe like they're the same thing ??? You're still European despite the Brexit you know, just not a part of the EU anymore lol. 
---
There are a lot of toxic players on ps4 in Europe... Like everywhere else. Playing on console also means you'll encounter younger players. This community is quite toxic in the first place, and gamers in general aren't really great people because of the anonymity online gaming provides. I mean, look at people on the internet as a whole, some of them are real assholes too.
---
To be honest, if you're judging the entire population of numerous countries based on the people you encounter in a *online game*, then maybe you should take a break or something. Sorry if I'm sounding condescending, that's not my intention, but this is really not a good mentality to have.
---
Save Jason from the dead game he's from and bring him here
---
I understand your suggestion. But solutions to balance issues that make the game less fun to play are not good ideas. I don't think the early game gen balance issue can be fixed absent a mechanic chance or introduction, but I'm not a game developer 
---
But its unfair...can't the devs disable reviews for free weekend non owners? Its killing future sales.

It is shitty compared to pc. That’s just obvious. Better technically and survivors and killers are better. Why the hell did he get down voted?

I think this would kinda devalue NOED. I don’t like NOED, but I don’t think making it obsolete is the right choice. I think with the updated totem/hook spawns it will be a lot better.

Hmmmm... Ill give you a slight pass on that.

Game breaking when it wasn’t an original feature of the game. Makes me want to start playing killer on console honestly.

the lack of any real missed attack cooldown is pretty obnoxious, i do agree. but if you're able to trick them at pallets and other loops with the environment, then even if they do catch on you can generally gain enough distance for their power to run out before they reach you. the sound bugs make this even easier to do for the time being. another great tool is that, if a legion hasn't used their power and you're fully healed, you can simply wait at a pallet for them to do anything. legion players will almost always respect pallets against fully healed survivors, so you can create a sort of waiting game until the legion acts. if they m1 you, then they don't get deep wounds off and have no momentum. if they use their power, at worst they get a single hit before you stun them out of feral frenzy and make them waste even more time with you. the goal of the survivor is to extend the chase as much as possible and rarely ends in losing the killer completely. yes, the legion has some obnoxious mechanics that can make chases boring. (namely bleedout moonwalking) but this doesn't mean you are completely void of options against them. for the time being, there are tools that you can use to waste as much of their time as possible so that your team can complete gens and escape.
---
Thats should be more than enough, make sure you take good care of it and dont play with it on your lap, use a table.
---
Dont forget a good wifi connection and a mouse.
---
Well the game is exactly newcomer friendly. I'm not even talking about perks and addons/items. Being new to the game and being looped by a veteran must be very frustrating especially when you don't know when to give up the chase. Same when playing surv and you get stomped by a experienced killer...
---
Maybe they should make it that new players who haven't bought the game have their first 2-5 games only amongst themselves and only after that they get mixed into the actual match making pool.
---
Dunno if this would even work and if there would be enough new players to fill the lobbies 
---
Wonder why the hell the wiki has lied to me!
---
I always say "Oh, he drives away!" when I see him chainsawing away. xD
---
100 downs with a controller Huntress is much harder. Especially when charged shots got through people due to framerate.
---
Thank you!
---
I’ve been rank 3 before highest I’ve been. Idk survs just frustrate me I don’t respect them because even if I win without doing anything shady( camping tunneling,etc.) they never fail to pull out some bs excuse for losing.
---
No don't use brutal strength with spririt fury. The double hit potential from enduring and spirit fury is way better.
---
Strong Billy build would go:
---
Bbq&amp;chili, ruin, enduring, spirit fury. 
---
Hey at least accusations of using third party comms are wrong 
---
Your legs spread? What mori is that?
---
Make sure to put the safety helmets on Survivors.
---
We don't want them to trip and get hurt.
---
absolutely
---
Honestly mang, go with this:
---
BBQ, Bamboozle, Enduring, Spirit Fury. 
---
You don't need Ruin. Ruin helps but Billy and Nurse have mobility and the ability to end chases quickly. If you're just getting started then Ruin might be good until you get comfortable with how everything works but when that day happens just use the perks I recommended. They counter a lot of bullshit in the game.  And you will come to know what bullshit I'm talking about the more you play. 
---
:Pepehands:
---
I "main" Freddy and can usually get to rank 6 with him without too much trouble. I still think he's the worst but I def get punished more when I tunnel. Oddly enough the worst killer's play style is to not lock onto one bitch and hawk em all game. But I'll be damned if that Hillbilly doesn't twist my dick in a knot even though there are 4 gens left with Ruin still up.
---
Some you can earn via shards ~the blue things you get for going up a devotion level~ or you can buy orache cells and use those to get outfits
---
Some outfits you can't earn
---
Ummmmmm no???
---
Iron will is god tier against her.
---
The only clothes you can unlock is the bloody clothing by prestige.
---
All other clothing you have to buy with real money or buy with shards but that can take a very long time
---
Got to love the rules when it comes to memes.
---
Nurse probably sends gift baskets full of fruit and bath soaps to Legion bi-weekly to thank them for taking the heat off her.  
---
**SLAM**
---
Isnt that poor game design though?
---
Chasing a survior for 30 seconds only for them to find several loops or infinites, thats 30 seconds wasted, and whats not to say that the other survivors wont go to that loop either. wouldnt that mean no matter what you do, you will always have to chase surviors for at least half a minute.
---
In my opinion the whole idea of killers leaving surviors along just cause they're in a loop or infinite feels fairly flawed.
---
what if u have to go to work or smth
---
this is my favorite build to just go around trying to give survivors a scare, i dont even try to get kills with this cuz its all in good fun :P
---
They’re a Screamface knockoff. The concept is cool but not original at all, and the reality of the killer in game i s so fucking annoying. And no, they’re not scary, just fucking annoying. If I see one I don’t get scared. I just hate the game a bit more.
---
I think killer on console is definitely easier than pc because it's harder for survivors to pull off 360s with a controller 
---
Dead by daylight has one of the steepest learning curves. I've seen reviews saying Killers are overpowered and some saying survivors are overpowered. It comes down to the new players not being proficient in their choice of play. It took me 15-20 hours to become somewhat good at dead by daylight. Most of the reviews have under 2 hours. 
---
The salt just entertains me truthfully but you can disable messages if you don’t feel like dealing with it. 
---
I'm new the game and the subreddit. What does SWF means? I have seen it on different posts now :)
---
You mean toxic assholes who have a huge ego because they're better than everyone else. Yeah that's me HAHAHA when your at the top you can be as toxic as you want.
---
I don't think this way at all. I mean surv can't really fight back (yeah ds and flashlights) so there being some sort of "save place" for the surv isn't bad imo. It's on the killer to catch surv in the open or mind game/outplay them in loopable areas.
---
DamnNotHTML just made a awesome video on YouTube on how you can chases early on the most common looping structures. Highly recommend watching this of your chases count any more than 30s to 1min 
---
From my personal experience, if you only play PS4 and never look at PC it's alright. But I purchased it on PC and I'd rather hang on a real meat hook than play DBD on ps4
---
Neither are your solutions..
---
Looks like you hate it just because it's popular
---
If the salt sticks wear it 
---
Everyone loves Meg 
---
This isn't MK
---
Don't assume my gender
---
Exactly lmao, now that people can’t message me, they fill the little text box on friend requests with salt!
---
Not always the case. When you, as killer, play against 4 solo players, you must be a terrible killer if you can't get at least 3 of them.
---
All in all, the game is favouring well-coordinated SWF survivors because they can keep each other updated what is happening from different places on the map.
---
I sure have some troubles going up against SWF groups (not always, some are overly altruistic which is actually their biggest mistake), but going up against 4 randos is usually easy af.
---
You can trap everyone straight away, you can try to always have one trapped only at a time, or you can save them for endgame.
---
I personally prefer the 2 earlier options as endgame has no fallback measures.
---
I wouldn’t recommend crouch walking the map due to low visibility and mobility. Using Whispers to snek up on first victim is good, and allows you to head trap someone before a gen pops. Only crouch if you know a survivor is going to pass you or they’re occupied and you now for certain they are.
---
Video tape and combat straps best add ons as it allows you to use your lunge in a chase, and you need to just to gain adequate BP.
---
Pig is really fun until you realise your strength lies on RNG and you will most likely lose when they get their hats off first try. Oh well!
---
Yep I play ps4 and once you get used to it’s not terrible but when you look at pc it seems like a different game.
---
BBQ *and* Ruin, comparable to DS? I don't know what they're smoking, but I don't want any. I like having braincells. But hey, at least he's admitting DS is OP by wanting to ditch two good Killer perks to make up for it being gone, lol.
---
okay but when I play killer I want to know who has adrenaline right at the beginning 
---
tfw last year launch flop
---
I love Monitor and Abuse. It goes super well with the Engravings addons. 
---
It's not a mori, it's a special affliction that survivors AND killers can get. They typically experience it after getting downed in the first 30-45 seconds of a game or after they've lost a survivor after a 2 minute long chase. Terrible affliction really.
---
Dank necro
---
All 4 of them? Yeah i think about them a lot.
---
I can’t wait for Ru’s new hit single ‘Hex: Ruin’ (Available now on iTunes *wink*)
---
I do kinda practice when the killer is chasing me, I always try to some techniques to lose him or distract him like the window juke (idk if it has a name) that works a lot of the time but when I try to do a 360 it only works like 1 time out of 10.
---
Amen brother.
---
So does DS
---
Hehe is it bad that I almost always go for the Megheads first?
---
Face a legion that moonwalks with bloodhound and tell me it’s not broken.
---
I like Kate a lot and she's one of my side mains and maybe pick the Tapp DLC, I personally play and main Pig and it's really fun playing her with traps but Freddy is fun too but weak but has great perks that really help with keeping the game lasting a little longer, but for Dwight and Adam I just leveled Adam and got his perks and then got all of Dwight's through the shrine
---
What’s the lore behind the horse? I’ve always wondered 
---
I can’t huh? Even when they have plenty of tools to escape chases and get second chances.
---
Borrowed time, Breakdown, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline or Sprint burst.
---
Put those 4 perks on an swf team and no killer can really get a 4K with that. At best a 3k.  
---
And those are just 4 perks bro. I could as easily put down lithe, self care, sprint burst, and balanced landing for another 4 perks an swf team could abuse.
---
Bait out the DH
---
Oh, yes! Can't forget the alternative acronym form: CNUT!
---
*When I get a Nurse daily*

You could make a religion out of this!

*WaaAaAAaaaHh*

There’s still people that think that. Also your question is redundant. 
---
Learn to loop around tiles
---
Amazing 
---
I honestly have never had any of these issues for over a year, and especially not since 2.4. 
---
Are you guys resetting your apps every time you get dodged? 
---
Either I’m very lucky or you’re grossly over exaggerating how long you have to wait.
---
Oh yeah how dare those people have fun together?!?! Such bs
---
Whoa there. I need at least 2 gens from you before brunch is even considered. 
---
A killer could if they were good at the game clearly you aren’t. Just salty because you can’t match players at your tier. Take the L and move on 
---
Hey man, we can help you with your problems. Just tell us who hurt you AND WHY YOU FUCKING SAID "I GUESS", YOU UNGRATEFUL STALE HAM SANDWICH
---
Pretty certain name and shame is against subreddit rules
---
Monitor and Abuse, Ruin (because you are slow), discordance and agitation/enduring/brutal strength. Only play tier 1 myers with extra lunge on Lery's.
---
I always work on dull totems in soloQ and then get super paranoid when I’ve destroyed 5 and can’t find the last one. Can’t trust people to clear them &gt;_&gt;
---
Man, some people are really patiant at all.... 
---
Are you playing on a microwave display? Why is that screenshot so tiny?
---
So is your post about thinking one side is better than the other. You’re just mad because someone or multiple people are better at this game than you are.
---
Almost every perk in the game is a "crutch perk". 
---
I accidentally deleted the full screenshot so I had to use the steam thumbnail of the screenshot.
---
You got off lucky this time... 
---
Just yesterday a group messaged me with my state and shut off my internet. If that's not the pinnacle of salt, I don't know what it.
---
I love this 
---
In your opinion. In my opinion he’s actually the worst lol.
---
Hey guys, we've got a meme thief over here! 
---
I didn't say it was bad to get the BP. I just said it's effortless. Tell me what other killer can overall still by definition "lose" a match against survivors but not only gain near max BP from it AND also rank up for it consistently match after match. Frenzy allows for 3/4 of the BP categories to be maxed with little effort and also allows for 2 of the emblems to reach iridescent easily, that's before factoring any hooks or kills you may also get on top of it.
---
I mean SWF can be countered. It isn't like survivors are automatically using in-game cheats or anything. Exploiting the fact that they may over-altruistic tends to work very well, and sure it will be overall more difficult but if you're good as a killer, i.e ending chases quickly, map pressuring, monitoring gens, etc. it shouldn't be impossible. Just because the survivor has a friend in the lobby with them doesn't automatically make you worse at chasing said survivor, at worse you may get more bodyblockers at the end but there are several killer perks to combat this and you're injuring more survivors for free, sure I can agree it is strong maybe a bit too strong but SWF isn't unstoppable.
---
Inherently a lot of add-ons and offerings are pretty OP. Mori however does punish the killer with substantially less points as well, unless they 2 hook everyone first, which at that point the ebony kind of loses it's potency. other good add-ons like Iri heads, tombstones, coxcomb, tuning guide, etc. etc. are either really good with a downside, or don't outright break balance. I personally noticed that starting with the Clown they started just making the rarer add-ons substantial upgrades. Him, Spirit, and Legion just perform substantially better at little to no detriment with their powerful add-ons. Difference being Clown and Spirit at least have powers that don't just ignore mechanics of the game entirely and both require precision to use. Legion is rather different in that regard.
---
The problem is the power itself and how it is designed is not good at all. When I say not good, I mean in the sense that it is not well designed. You get fast traversal similar to Spirit/Hillbilly/Nurse but don't get the downside of any of them. Spirit loses much tracking and survivors become invisible to her. Hillbilly only has so much control with his chainsaw and once he ends his saw he does get stunned for a bit. Nurse gets stunned after her blinks and attacks, she gets longer stuns the more she uses in a row. Legion has full control and all they lose is scratch marks, which at that point of already finding the survivor is null since you won't lose them as you're running at Sprint Burst speed can still fully see the survivor get multiple attempts at hitting said survivor if you so miss, recharge your power fully upon hitting them the first time, get a reveal on any survivors nearby after said hit and can effortlessly hit them a 2nd time. After the initial hit, a survivor can hope to juke, hide, or run for any other killer to varying degrees of success. All of those are impossible against Legion with even OK tracking as if you "lost the chase" your bleed out timer starts going down making it so you have to mend soon along with a super grayed screen, allowing the Legion to catch up and hit you again which at that point it doesn't matter if it's a regular hit or with Frenzy as you will go down either way with Frank's and if not with Frank's it resets your mend progress and gives you less time to remend yourself. (To think people actually want Nurse's Calling to work on mending)
---
Also I know it's an exaggeration, but Legion chases never last that long UNLESS they are trying to hit multiple people. When focused on 1 person, getting 2 free hits instantly then being able to get the next 1-2 free within the next 15 second intervals isn't hard. It is technically slower than an optimal chase against a 115% killer sure, but it is a helluva lot easier to get those hits. 
---
That’s the Horse The Clown came in on in his lore. The Entity took a liking to Maurice so now he just chills on the side of the caravan with a creepy third eye and occasionally drools blood. 
---
Nah on PS4, I’ve had quite a few people do it, even when I run tombstone and they’re at the gates they just want it 😂.
---
I just love how the nurse stands there, contemplating your choices, like "wtf did just happen" 
---
Me and my friends experience the same issue (UK)
---
If feminine guys or feminine guys dressing up like women makes you, or any other straight man, "uncomfortable", you need to gt a grip on your life.
---
After seeing it again, Gia didnt know the words
---
Thanks, I’m probably gonna lose a friend after this lol
---
Same for about 90% of the stuff people complain about
---
Ok so you just proved my point further that there's no counter? Also if legion hits someone and runs towards me before I can get out of the terror radius wtf am I supposed to do? Teleport? Lmao this is a really dumb conversation honestly. Legion counters stealth. 
---
Not if ur the one doing the gens silly edit: I also play solo so idk why everyone on this sub assumes swf all the time but it's really annoying
---
Ironic
---
Kate is the only good looking female in the game. 
---
I as like you. I'd go as far as to let the last survivor I'm carrying go to free someone from a hook and then let them escape. Or carry them to the hatch. Or actively avoid tunneling.
---
The result: Teabag, teabag, teabag, teabag. "lol ur such trash" messages. No more nice killer for me. Good on you though. :)
---
Kate is rad but Kates that I've seen have been fucktards
---
Tapp is better than gollum
---
Let’s not let that guy speak for all survivors. He’s a nut. BBQ and ruin are completely fine. 
---
He didn’t “fight” for it, they had to avoid it because there was an actual pedophile killing children at the same time and he didn’t want Freddy to be associated with that
---
Yesterday my SWF group did this multiple games in a row, Ace is a wonderful boy
---
My man. :D
---
The meme this is taken from is so fucking absurd and funny
---
Yah the hit box’s have been all over the place. I down a meg earlier with Daddy Myers and she was way out in front of me. 
---
You can't see the best part on that image though
---
wow, you do you.. you must be pretty good with her.
---
Lol I saw that in your video. Fucking epic
---
The highest effort of meme
---
That poor Laurie walking up to the door, has no idea what Myers has in store for her. No wonder she’s so frantic on the main menu animation 
---
I think you have it confused with Tinkerer. 
---
I'm alright, I've been playing her for around a month
---
Quentin's perks are fucking useless and Freddy is the worst killer in the game so I would buy the Saw DLC over the Nightmare On Elm Street DLC. Tapp's perks are at least useful in some instances and Ms. Piggy is fun to play.
---
no i mean rancor usually shows you other survivors working on gens that are gonna be done soon
---
Only the killers can see the scratch marks
---
Your mileage with Object is entirely dependant on which killer you're up against. If it's a Nurse, Hillbilly, Spirit, Legion or Huntress then you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. 
---
LOL I WATCHED IT 4 TIMES BEFORE I UNDERSTOOD.
---
Don’t need to “Let the obsession go” if you use Predator/Bloodhound/Sloppy. You can gain all 3 stacks in one chase by looking at the floor.
---
Lol no argument from you. Prove my point some more bud. Move along I’m done with you.
---
I just dont get what a "happy cake day" is

When you also speed up for some reason huehuehue

So i gotta play hag, pig, spirit, legion and nurse and report just kills or...?

---
If you don't abuse chase mechanics or use Frank's mixtape they still are the worst killer in the game.
---
No, not really. The last time one did they went down in under a second.
---
It's been two months for me with nothing happening from it, so, probably not.
---
He was just joking
---
I'm in your camp, I've only recently picked it up as well but I'm having a absolute blast. Even when I fuck up, or realize that the monster is horribly outclassing the survivors (or vice versa) it still is enjoyable and getting the blood pumping which I was sorely lacking in a game for awhile now.
---
Oof (also love the flair)
---
hah I had no idea. I just started dipping into fighting games again, saw him a few weeks ago on some games. I had no idea. 😂
---
There was a thread here the other day about how slugging is an exploit with a bunch of upvotes.
---
It's pretty much your reddit birthday.
---
&gt;lol why do i have 8 downvotes
---
Probably because what you said looked ungrateful and kinda mean. 
---
It basically gives them constant dead hard when they lag around
---
A lot of killers damn near get a stroke everytime they get teabagged lmao
---
Cornfields are disgusting if you're a killer. Too big map and corn-blindness
---
Imo the sounds were alittle bit too strong in this game sometimes. Like id be crouched behind a rock or something move slightly and all of a sudden the killer comes walking to me.
---
I played for a few months without Enduring on LF, finally decided to try it, and it honestly feels like playing with cheat codes on. Yeah, I'd say it's totally acceptable to call Enduring a DS soft-counter.
---
Yeah I’m not trying to play ignorance here, but I don’t get it? Like I said, unless they are ear/eye assaulting you, I’m fine with it. I sometimes even find it cute and if I’m playing pig, I’ll do it with them (thank god for combat straps)
---
For me Pig is creepy, this head is horrible and imagine her jumping on you with this roar :D Also I would love to smash pallet on her head xD \*squeal\*
---
Then you’ve got lucky you haven’t had the meta cancer legions. There’s a reason 90% of people hate him.
---
I'm subscribed to 2 RPDR sub and here...and TOOK ME A WHILE TO REALIZE THAT This wasn't a drag race subs. I'm proud of this community 
---
I don’t get it either it’s funny to me when they do it lol 
---
Nope, I tend to face toxicity with toxicity but t-bagging means literally nothing 
---
Same I know the survivors will never believe it but I still do it lmfao, the only killer I’m good at is billy because he’s my main so whenever I have to play wraith or leatherface I get fucked cause I’m so used to having a chainsaw that does something  lol
---
I dunno, I never played pre 2.4.0 and coming from years of playing games where audio is imporant...DbD audio is so broken that only pain groaning can be used to find anyone. I even tested it with friend when I began playing and just decided that you are not supposed to locate using footsteps (hence scratchmarks)
---
I think you mean Nea
---
Funny that I started playing this game exactly on last free weekend
---
So you say, copycat killer?
---
ah, i see you’re a man of culture as well
---
Just dont use windows or pallets or anything bruh
---
All of them tbh. But imagine you're in the wood and you hear inevitable Huntress' lullaby, it'd be super creepy...  
---
But Spirit appearing from nowhere, Hag jumping from ground, Nurse blinkin right in front of you... And Santa Clown xD
---
Even if they buff freddy theres gonna be a new worst killer, just leave it be. They are all viable in their own way.
---
Sometimes I think people will get mad about anything in this game. 
---
I blame the constant pushing the fandom has done with toxic attitudes. It teaches newer players bad behavior because so many older players are dead inside and don’t care anymore. The DS and NOED debate doesn’t help at all either. 
---
Your experienc3 m8
---
Uh oh a Star Wars reference without a glaring shoehorned DbD item you’re gonna get removed 
---
I'm happy i picked up the game today and got 2 4mans on huntress
---
Whats the point of the Billy?
---
I have a rule where if someone reviews a game negatively and has less than 100 hours, I don't take the review seriously. 
---
Well you still move grass i think and its audible so a killer can locate you sometimes if they can hear it.
---
\&gt;The next day  
---
"no"  
---
Game:  
---
"The Initiation"
---
Problem is, killer makes exactly the same sound constantly, so just turning around to check every time will waste you much more time.
---
Your choice of the word shity surprises me. I've played on both and I'd say the problem is the game not the system you play it on. Skill checks are easier on PS4 in my opinion, but you just get to technical glitches on PC survivors using exploits and shit. Like technically body blocking isn't supossed to be a thing but it is. Someone does that to me as killer I hit him or drop the person and chase. 
---
Im just saying bruh ive been found off making noise when moving a few times :p
---
i find teabagging very rude but i don’t get as offended as i did before
---
I had a nurse game today when I didn't do too great. They opened both the exit games and just wouldn't leave, I had no idea where they had gone so I waited and waited and waited... And DCed cause it was just too long. 
---
Dead by Daylight is an asymmetric survival horror game. 
---
- a·sym·met·ri·cal [āsəˈmetrək(ə)l] 
---
Adjective; 
---
Having parts which fail to correspond to one another in shape, size, or arrangement; lacking symmetry.
---
Given the definition of what it is, this game is obviously going to tend to lean more to one side. However, the side it leans toward is almost always whoever is better at the game, which in this case, is not you. Take that with as much salt as you want, but you don't have room to bitch when you're clearly just bad at being killer.
---
I have really high standards for toxicness. Unless the player is really making an attempt to make the game not fun for a certain side, just say “well there’s nothing I can really do besides still try and find some positive stuff in this match and try my hardest the next one”
---
In the end, only you can sour your own attitude, and you being mad only affects your happiness. It does literally nothing to the person who hurt you so positivity is key!

Weird flex but ok

It’s a terrible joke, but thank you for coming. 
---
Unfortunately
---
Genuine question, but how does it come off as rude to you? Is it because it’s disrespectful?

Ah ok. Yea without addons wraith can be very very bad
---
Right? I mean I love the mods what could the mods ever do wrong? *sweats profusely*
---
Red Dead by Daylight
---
The mods will delete anything “not DBD related” so if you slap a billy on literally any picture then it suddenly becomes DBD related and won’t be deleted
---
Got perk slot #4, what now?
---
brexit didn’t even help
---
I find it very rude, but then I reciprocate by not following survivor rules and punishing unsafe unhooks.
---
I'm a killer main and bad at survivor. I find killer way easier and more chill. 
---
Rank resets can get you to 20-16 ranks
---
Tbh when a survivor tea bags I ignore them lmao. When they run up and tea bag I go for the other survivors cause I know the tea bagger is good at looping and wants to be chased
---
Ahhh Entity...pretty chill guy. 
---
As long as you're murderous psychopath or pony.
---
Or both.
---
The power of the sun, in the palm of my hand. 
---
What rules do you mean? (Also punishing unsafe hooks is understandable. I usually like to go after the farmer tho so as to encourage them to chill on that mentality of “me before my team”)
---
yeah, basically
---
you’re doing it to literally demean and mock the killer
---
i get really bad anxiety and whenever i got teabagged it took a toll on me the next time i’d play a killer game
---
Well they honestly aren’t scary at all...in fact they are probably the least scariest out of all the killers..Now FRANKS MIXTAPE..that’s scary.
---
Ok, play 5 different survivors with the exact same perks. Experience was the exact same on each survivor
---
It made me chuckle little 
---
poor killer :'(
---
Entity displeased
---
I guess I never thought about it that way? Eventually the “pro-strat” would be to give up if you think they’re better than you and go after a weaker link. Still doesn’t mean you can’t try tho! 
---
God could you really be bothered lol
---
I’ll bait an unhook then come out of phase immediately after to down the survivor, slug them then go after the unhooker. Patrol camping is pretty easy with spirit
---
I didnt intend to look mean. Im sorry i just didnt knew that there is this birthday feature
---
Tbh if a survivor tea bags, I give them the nod when I hook them. People have thin skin nowadays. Like I said in my review for DBD on steam, if you have thick skin buy the game, if you get offended easily, go play something else haha
---
Looking at it now, you are correct, but I could’ve sworn somewhere I watched an interview where Wes Craven said he didn’t want Freddy to be a pedo, just a killer. Oh well, bottom line is Classic Freddy isn’t a pedo and that’s good enough for me!
---
i learned as a ps4 killer if you send a gg to someone they will usually be very nice and send one back even if you get a 4k
---
it’s nice to brighten someone’s day even a little bit because i know i smile when i get gg messages first
---
Do you think sometimes the player doesn’t interpret it or misunderstands how they are coming off? The internet is notorious for miscommunication. 
---
And also are you ok on the t-bagging thing? Usually some survivors can be supportive post game if it makes you feel better. Had a survivor tell me they were sorry the corn gave me motion sickness and hope I get better. 
---
There are some good people out there and hopefully your anxiety gets better! 
---
No I'm not 12
---
Downvoted because Claudette 
---
&gt; In my personal experience, I have seen more clowns perform better than the Hags I have faced. Also, think about it. 
---
Because a lot of Hags are playing poorly.
---
&gt; The Hag has an ability that is negated by crouching 
---
Crouching while in chase?
---
&gt; placing a "web" of traps can only be done to about 1/4 to 1/2 a map depending on the map 
---
That's good enough and you have to adjust a web to the situation (I mean change it)
---
&gt; anyone with a flashlight is going to destroy any trap they find 
---
So they are going to crouch around map and flashing a flashlight? It's not really possible and their flashlight would just go off 
---
&gt; her chase speed is slow. 
---
Nurse is slower, lol ;) 
---
Well yeah in your opinion their would be nothing wrong with camping, because you aren’t good at this game and think while you’re camping one guy the rest of the survivors shouldn’t be allowed to do anything. Like in your most recent rant about how you’re bad at this game but it’s everyone else’s fault they are better.
---
I switch up my killers and survivors pretty regularly, what is there to report? I played Leatherface, Spirit, Wraith, Myers and Huntress yesterday, only common perk among some of them being BBQ or Ruin. All games I had a 3 or 4k with the exeption of one of my Leatherface games where I got run around by a survivor for forever on the Game map. 
---
All my survivors have different builds, so whenever I want to do a different build, I switch to another survivor.
---
guys look at me im a REAL gamer i dont like call of DOOTY xddd.
---
Damn she scares the hell outta me half the time. Sometimes she’ll pretend to phase and then stay by the hook waiting for someone to show up. That’s why you gotta wait for a bit.
---
While I disagree with patrol camping, if it is warranted cause a teammate won’t let you leave the hook, it can be understandable. 
---
Ace would be more worth than quintin
---
Top tier work around
---
please don't kill me with downvotes, but if you play against one survivor with 5 gens, let him farm at least for black pip. that fucking swf ruined your and the survivor match. you really have no mercy ahahahah
---
Yeah... man i don't know if these weren't a thing before when i used to play or i just never noticed before haha
---
Post game chat is one of the beat parts 
---
*opens chest, killer fucking dies instantly, results screen says "GAME OVER" blood pours out of screen wake up see gen do gen get grabbed hooked then facecamped* Edit: There is no Edit
---
Tbh I’m honestly a jaded killer because I had to learn the spirit at rank one. Lots of teanagging and bm. Not anymore, though.
---
Thank god for mods keeping us safe from dangerous things like funny references https://imgur.com/gallery/sPcDMK9
---
well if it’s at the exit gate then i don’t think there’s any miscommunication there
---
if it’s mid-chase with flashlight clicking then yeah they’re definitely trying to upset me too
---
and i’m on ps4 so i don’t have a post game chat, but i guess i’m okay i just get annoyed now because i don’t care as much about my rank after hitting rank 1 for the first time
---
i’ve sent good people but sometimes they’re hard to come by, thanks though
---
Blood Warden would like to have a word with you.
---
Teach me your ways, it’s driving me insane
---
Oh you have a review? Is it under the same name cause I’d love the read it! (Trust me I’m not being sarcastic). 
---
Also I try to be nice cause some people don’t choose to have thin skin, it could be a personal thing, but I do agree to some extent. You can only be so nice as the killer/survivor to a certain extent, you can’t just let the survivors/killers control you and tell you how to play the game cause they got mad. 
---
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been told to cut/kill myself because I wouldn’t play a game with the opponent! It’s especially bad the higher rank you get. 
---
There is no way anyone could be stupid enough to think that adrenaline isn’t S tier, I do however love to bait for the one guy who agrees and thinks it’s a good idea
---
Tell that to Lieutenant Dan
---
Haha 
---
No really. This made me laugh
---
The fact that it’s so scuffed makes it so good
---
I'm glad 
---
Lol, baby nurse here, just need my daily. 
---
If survivors Tbag and flicker I just tunnel and facecloth them, no reason to not fight toxicity with toxicity 
---
Your opinion bud. I’m actually probably better than you.
---
what’s in the box!?
---
Well meme was there for awhile before some mod got a stick up his ass.  
---
Rude haha
---
Well true at the exit gates. I just interpret it as light teasing unless they refuse to leave until you actually hunt them down at the gate. I waited for a survivor to leave one time and I waited literally 10 min because I wandered off breaking pallets and getting more points. I was so confused! I thought my game was broken. 
---
I also don’t understand flashlight clicking? I do it at my friends but I think there’s such a stigma now behind flashlights that if you bring one then you WILL get deaded by the killer. Sucks that such a game mechanic hurts both sides. 
---
On ps4, they just PM you and also can be kinda scary. Hopefully if they do bully they get reported and Sony actually does something since the devs give no shit to the console. 
---
Anytime! If you need to talk to me I’ll be available. I play PC but it’s whatever. Maybe one day I’ll play on console. 
---
Did the black chest have a... Black Lock?
---
I grew up playing Call of Duty around the MW2 days. I've probably heard every insult possible. I usually laugh at insults in post game chat. Cause after all, it is just a game. But I could see why some would get upset
---
Maybe work on your pitch. Should is very your opinion, but other than that good idea.
---
that's the horse that pulled the clown's wagon around, he lost both his eyes while being transported to the realm of the Entity, so the Entity gave him the third eye in the middle so he's not blind. 
---
Oh absolutely, all I'm trying to say is that if you are going to talk the talk, you'd better be able walk the walk. No use to being cocky by teabagging when you can't hold a chase for longer than 20 seconds.
---
Well that sounds like a lighter teasing but you never know with some people. I always feel bad when I hit a survivor on the very tip of my weapon swing. I’d be pretty mad as that guy. 
---
I’ve actually made some great friends who’ve friend requested me and have made the game 10x better with them. Even if they are complaining, don’t take them to heart. People who hurt others are just people who are hurting themselves. It helps me to remember that. 
---
Any time my dude! Maybe we can play together one day. If you ever get a PC just PM or something so we can play!
---
See this is why I asked people to PM, because theres so much I have to say about him. However, people have just ignored that and just commented, so I will give the full run down here. 
---
The first thing I have to say is that people get so hung up on the whole 7 seconds thing and forget about all of the good things his kit gives you. Think about the aura reading. It gives you the most map pressure in the game. you can see everyone who is asleep and at that point you don't need godlike game sense so you can predict where survivors are, you already know. Combined with this and the 50% reduction in action speed and survivors will get nothing done if you are consistently sleeping people. Survivors know that you can see them, and because of this, you could come from any angle, at any time. Slowdown aside, this fear greatly affects survivors. Why would you try to wake up off of a gen in the middle of the map with no cover or pallets nearby, so you run across the map just to get to somewhere you feel safe. Now this obviously won't happen all the time, especially against high rank survivors, but it is still a factor. 
---
Next is the 50% slowdown, which affects everything! The biggest part of this is not generators, it's gates. Opening a gate while asleep takes 40s, thats not just a gimped remember me, its so effective, its arguably all the slowdown you need to keep those gates closed. Add in remember me and thats a full 100 seconds, way more that a generator. This combined with the aura reading means that if you have say 3 survivors left alive in the endgame and all are asleep, you can have survivors opening both gates while you are chasing the third, and have time to down him and pressure both gates before they are opened. 
---
The last thing there is to say is how easy it is to sleep people. You see 3 people in one area and boom boom boom thats 3 people asleep. You chase one, thats 2 people not doing gens at full efficiency, factor in a fast down plus hook and those two asleep survivors are not likely going to try to rescue when you can see them, forcing the awake survivor to rescue. Thats 2 people maybe doing gens at half speed, one person hooked, and the last forced to rescue, all from an action that took 5 seconds to do. This isn't even a rare occurance, often time you will see even smart survivors working together.
---
If you look at the doctor for example, all he has among all his abilities that seem really good is lackluster tracking that requires a good addon to be somewhat effective in the form of the doctor auras, the fake pallets which need an addon to even use, and the shock action that prevents vaulting. The shock attack, like the rest of the doctor seems really good, but crumbles when put against efficient looping. The tier 3 inability to perform actions is the only part of his kit that will slow you down and it's removed in 10 seconds with a silent action that makes you hard to see. Then you look at how long it take for the doctor to build madness and he loses a lot of effectiveness. I'm not saying the doctor is bad, I'm just saying that in many ways, freddy does many of the things the doctor does better and faster. This isn't coming out of my ass either, I used to main doctor quite a lot back in the day before freddy.
---
Check my other reply.
---
[Subjectivity is implied.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu8u2SxarEE)
---
even as someone who mostly plays killer ; I'd like to.
---
"Wow I so good I beat a console nurse that's playing on a slideshow and has slow ass sensitivity. I good survivor! Me amazing!"
---
DS still does has the intended impact even with enduring though.
---
Oh yeah you can stack shit like remember me and save the best for last on it (At least you could in ptb idk if it changed)
---
Pettiness on both sides, makes me laugh when people act they are a god, especially on a game like DBD 
---
Nah that’s you Salty
---
No lol. Tbagging isn’t offensive and is a part of pretty much every game you can crouch in. After the tbag fest of halo it’s just funny
---
Considering how fast survivors can clear generators and how little control the Killer has over that even with Ruin, NO ED is fine where it is, because it's the only recourse they have to stretch a game out past five minutes.
---
True true! It’s kinda funny when they act really rude and die in the first 10 seconds of the chase. 
---
And those are also always the person who DC the first down. 
---
Like at least let me get my stacks man. Plus when one person DC, they all start to follow cause they don’t wanna 3/2 man 5 gens. 
---
If only Nurses Calling can show people Mending or something or maybe add hard skillchecks to mending then i would stop chasing survivors with Deep Frenzy otherwise id just lose them immediatelly and can safely say goodbye to them until they mend.
---
I'm usually pretty happy to see people tbagging, at least during the match and not at the exit gate.  If they want to let me get more distance in a chase, or run around not doing gens to try to tbag/tilt me into chasing them, then go for it.  It's nothing but a benefit to the killer, and the people who tbag like that often throw down pallets quick/take suboptimal routes and let you get value as killer.  Obviously don't chase them forever if they're just going from loop to loop, but often they don't have the skill to back their cockiness.
---
If they're tbagging at exit gates, maybe it can be irritating but it's still a good thing for you as killer.  I'd rather get those last chase/hit points as I chase them out than not get more points, but I'd also usually rather not have to walk all the way across a big map and waste a bunch of time just to chase someone out tbagging at the exit gate for minutes. 
---
A legion who plays how he was intended to be used (the way you described) is weak. 
---
A legion who frenzies, hits you, and follows but isn't in chase with you, giving you no chance to mend while your timer goes down, is op
---
I was busy haha. 
---
You're giving me information that I'm already well aware of, I play Freddy more than any other killer. Aura reading is nice, but it also forces you to tunnel pretty much whoever you find because of the seven second thing. It is *so * relevant to everything concerning Freddy, it just can't be ignored. 
---
50% slower is borderline useless because you almost never have the whole team sleeping without that addon. As for exit gates, it being effective requires you to find the whole team, which is rare. You can't rely on that to happen all the time. More likely than not, because of him having to wait on people (again), when you find someone at end game, you have to chase, you can't hop off. And while chasing, literally anybody else can open the gates. 
---
Freddy is a good killer *in theory*. He should be able to put people to sleep and dominant the pace of the game. I believe that was the intention. But it's way too fucking easy to wake up, he can't effectively defend objectives (such as someone being able to break a totem right before your goddamn eyes), and he is practically forced to tunnel most games. All of his benefits, in theory, should make him way more viable, but the game simply will not play out like that most games. Even your example "you find 3 people in room, put them to sleep, boom that's people effectively not doing gens". Except you have to chase one of them, and more likely than not the other two are gonna wake up before you can say "praise the entity". It's way too easy to wake up for effective map control, and aura reading alone is not enough to say he isnt bad killer. In theory, he shouldn't be, but in reality he is. 
---
The thing is, the longer the game goes the more advantage the killer gets it seems. I honestly feel like killer is easier to do better with than survivor but obviously it can sway either way depending on skill/perks etc. 
---
Or just don’t stoop to the survivors level? Posting on here about it just shows you are as childish and trolling like that person was 
---
*Tubonerosis
---
Stay away from that sub, it’s quite horrible.
---
this game isnt scary at all tbh lol
---
I never played halo with other people. DBD is actually the first multiplayer game I’ve ever participated in. I didn’t even know what t-bagging was until my friend mentioned it. I just thought the controller/keyboard was glitching. 
---
Now I just t-bag my friends corpse while they get moried or downed. Usually killers just watch me doing it like “wtf”?
---
Killer easier to play than survivor no doubt. It would be impossible for a game like this to be perfectly balanced but it sways the line pretty well for the most part. 
---
Leave
---
The game now has a tutorial that explains the mechanics well and gives you the perspective of the killer and survivor as well as a menu explaining all the buffs/debuffs and other less obvious mechanics like perks. It really isn't a hard game to grasp.
---
And new players will be in ranks 16-20, once you pass onto 15 you will be unable to go back up.
---
There is little else the devs can do for the newcomer experience.
---
Im happy he got picked last though. We saw more of his box. Lol
---
His sack of goodies?
---
Laurie: "Wait, where's that knife going?"
---
They’re just farming but be careful they don’t have NOED. If they’re afk cleanse the totems before you finish the gens or check them before you farm hits. 
---
When you get rekt so bad you remake your post 😂
---
Balanced Landing is an amazing perk because even if your already exhausted they 25% fall stutter penalty actually opens up a lot of loops on some maps that are pretty useful.
---
Yeah, except stall them all you like, if you don't hook someone you aren't making progress either
---
That killer was talking about the hooks! Right...?  
---
^(/s)
---
oh hella
---
Suck my dick
---
The whole point is to challenge yourself doofus
---
It does not
---
Huh?
---
It's probably because my computer isn't the best for gaming (it's a TV connected to a laptop), but whenever I play console, it runs a lot smoother than PC.
---
You gain a kill. You gain BP when other survivors rush the hook. What's not to understand?
---
Nah it's like the Wraith bell, only from a certain distance (and you can't hear the heartbeat from the Spirit husk) 
---
It still beats the argument that "he's bad at rank 1" if this person says they can get to rank 1 consistently as him though so I'd give him the benefit of the doubt.
---
But why are they constantly swinging the weapon? And by this I mean not missing a single beat nor even changing the direction they’re facing! That’s the thing that makes me wonder if it’s a glitch or not - all the ones I encountered were AFK like this through till the end, and still continued doing the same thing when all exit gates were powered and open. Never moved an inch too 
---
I think if she jumped out from the first locker it would have been better, since she has quick and quiet. Walking from there it could even be possible to avoid nurse if she went straight for it.
---
You're crazy pal. Pizza Dwight or gtfo
---
Yeah, THAT'S why you're salty enough to make this post, talking about your Rank 3, killer-main playin' ass.. 😂
---
I'm not one of the people who say he's bad at rank 1. I still think he's gonna have a harder time than most killers but again, he's not unplayable. 
---
I don’t think that there is a specific killer that would work better than the others. But yeah, it is a nice perk
---
10 seconds to be exact.
---
The game's really only scary in about your first week or when you go up against Scratched Mirror M&amp;A Myers/Prayer Beads Spirit. After a while, it gets more annoying than scary. The terror radius on many killers will warn you so things like that won't scare you after a week or so.
---
*Laughs in Basement Bubba*
---
Dbd on PS1 
---
Hill billy inbreds from wrong turn!! 
---
I agree that Freddy's not the worst killer, but he *does* somewhat rely on good perks and addons to do very well.
---
I just don't want them to make him a killer with a sub-par power who's so focused on the chase that he ends up worse off than he was before.
---
I'd take an 8 hook 0k ~30kish game over a 4k 15k game any day.  Also them chasing me is so much better, it's like I get to chase 2 people at once.  That alone is so much incentive to not chase them.  If they want to throw the match, why is that something that should irritate me.
---
Though just for more clarification, suiciding on hook and disconnecting is throwing the match too I suppose, but that not only makes things less fair/fun for everyone but also means I get less points so that is pretty irritating.  Especially if they rage quit on first down before you get to hook them for the bbq stack.
---
Yeah... happened twice for me
---
Here’s the thing. Mending doesn’t really take that much time. By the time you finish applying deep wounds to everyone, assuming they aren’t swarming like idiots, they’re probably done mending. Playing him the way he was intended to be played in theory works, but you’re constantly applying pressure whilst making no progress of your own. Obviously, survivors that heal are going to lose simply because they waste time healing, however, good survivors know that legion’s ability injures you easily, and (until the buffs come from the PTB) that his frenzy poses no real threat even if you are injured, so there’s really no need to heal, and to just stick to mending. Sure, that means they only need one hit to be downed, but 110% movement speed is more than enough to make things worse for legion. This makes loops last FAR longer than usual and makes bloodlust less of a threat. You may say that the lowered TR along with Monitor and abuse allows legion to gain enough distance to hit the survivor, but exhaustion perks more than make up for the fact that you catch them off guard with a 16 meter terror radius. Legion’s ability on paper is sound but is just far too ineffective in practice, assuming you’re not using the add ons and not moonwalking. 
---
Yeah, only the skilled huntress one is more on console. We have nurse blink strike 500 times, tier up 300 times, and no "platinum" for doing 30% of achievements
---
Not entirely true. I queued with a rank 20 survivor last night and we had teammates in ~rank 19-20 that had fully maxed out perks and knew how to loop.
---
Either they didn't play since the rank changes, or they used a program that **can** reset you to below 15.
---
You barely “play” this game anymore yet you made a post recently bitching about survivors using items and how camping is ok, and now you make another post today about how this game is unbalanced? Are you sure you don’t “play” anymore or maybe you just don’t ever win anymore? 
---
Technically this is messing with the game files. 
---
Some speculate late January to early February. You never with these devs tho. 
---
It’s not worth it. Give them hell.
---
This has happened to me so much as a survivor. Probably also happens when I'm the pig

---
Hahahaha
---
You're supposed to hear footsteps? I only hear the survivor if they're hurt
---
I don’t care unless they talk shit post game
---
Talk shit get hit I guess :p
---
Oh my fucking god am I seeing this with my own fucking eyes 
---
HaHa JuSt DoNt PlAy HeR
---
Nah I’m kidding, some basic things are don’t use your traps till mid-late game to stop people leaving gates. Don’t get real close to survivors on gens with the sneak cause they’ll probably see you. Obviously don’t keep trying to ambush just run after them if it’s a chase (not for too long cause genrushing) 
---
Other than that it’s just general killer stuff to my knowledge but I haven’t played her just gone against her so take it with a grain of salt.
---
I’m not rank 3 anymore lol but whatever kid
---
U showed your colors. Didn't even see the guy teabagging
---
Sorry I don’t talk to trash. Blocked.
---
I wanted to make Deja Vu actually useful at high ranks / in general, as well as more unique. It's very similar to Detective's hunch in its current form and really doesn't have many uses. Let's be honest- generators are not that hard to find. You can usually just look for flickering lights. This idea is more unique and actually makes for some interesting plays. It gives you information about where the killer is and which generators are regressing / need to be tapped and how long they have been regressing for.
---
I was running plunders up the ante ace in the hole and self care
---
I read a while ago it’s a program they run that presses the hit button regularly and leave game/create lobby every so often. Have no idea how it works though, but I think it’s intentional 
---
Why is it always Nea doing some stupid a** sh**? 
---
Yeah I get that
---
He was rank 11 and he was definitely tbagging, cause it was doubled with occasional emotes
---
Yeah I was a huntress main before I played legion and I was garbage. Never did good except in the yellow ranks. I play legion now cause I like how simple he is. Yeah people hate that he’s easy but that’s what I like about him. He’s not exceedingly difficult, no tricks, no special games you have to play, just frenzy, hit everyone in your terror radius and give them wounds, and follow the last guy and hit him with a normal hit.
---
I clearly saw the teabagging if I watched the video, he tea bagged to piss you off into making a post like this 
---
That's how mafia works.
---
Ok bro whatever you say
---
I think we can all see that you don’t have the mental level to do so, in all reality you don’t even have the mental level to play this game without bitching when you lose 
---
When in doubt, whip it out
---
I’m pretty sure I got to killer rank 14 and now I’m 16
---
"I hardly play this game" But you felt the need to post about it? It's not the games fault you're too soft to be good at playing the killer. Maybe instead of getting on reddit and bitching about it you should get your salty ass on DBD and start attempting to get better. Or I'm sure your mom is right upstairs finishing up your hot pockets and Gatorade, maybe she'll comfort you. 
---
I'd die if that ever happened to me
---
Looks like locked cosmetics
---
I have wiggled free quite a few times, it's not impossible.
---
If you really have that much trouble maybe have the perk Boil Over... or use offerings that remove the killer's hook(s). 
---
Sure but after like 15 seconds it's too long
---
Ya'll got any pixels? 
---
Im so sorry
---
Same bro
---
I would hate that so much.
---
Step 1: Play killer with Beast of Prey, Distressing, Thrill of the Hunt and BBQ  
---
Step 2: "Git gud, Baby killer. I owned you".  
---
Step 3: "Dude... I am just chill farming."  
---
Step 4: "Yeah, totally. Your mum might believe that. Git rekt."
---
Two
---
You being able to get off is only intended for good teamwork, like bodyblocking and sabotaging, or special situations like a far hook+Kate's perk whose name I don't remember right now. If you could get off on your own killers wouldn't stand a chance.
---
Nah.
---
The game isn't called Alive by Daylight.
---
I think they do that on purpose if they deem you a “baby killer”. Like “you aren’t worth my time” or “you’re bad so time to remind you about how bad you are”. 
---
I love tombstoning them. There’s something about looking into their cold dead eyes that just makes me absolutely ecstatic. 
---
I’m ass at nurse so I can’t relate. I guess I get pitty wins all the time from them cause the last one I faced let us do all the gens. I gave her my purple flashlight in return. She was super nice. Gave us a heart post chat. To the nurse who did this, u da bes. 
---
She’s the killer I’m the worse at. Her and clown. Mostly because I’m terrified of clowns and his tonic makes me nauseous. Alls well that ends well I suppose. 
---
Also if you’re good get ready for the worst match of your life if you go against me and my really bad teammates. I love them but they always die 5 min into the game. 
---
They'd be constantly lunging then, which, in my experience, they never do; they only do a normal attack constantly.
---
*salt makes the world go round*
---
Git rekt nerd. 
---
Nope. Enduring alleviates the stun, it does jack shit for the fact that the survivor still gets off the killer's shoulder.
---
Probably a Star Trek fan
---
It wouldn't really help. The hooks spawn so close together you could see at least 3 just from where you're standing. The wiggle time isn't bad it's like 16.something seconds. Iron grasp bumps that up to 17.something. so it isn't bad 
---
Info that’s hot
---
&gt;the developers are incompetent in creating a fun experience, and advise to never buy this game.
---
I mean they're not wrong.
---
Just be thankful there aren't any console reviews
---
Unf that’s hot
---
NOED isn't overpowered, just annoying at times.
---
Fragrant Tuft of Hair, Iridescent Head, Prayer Beads, and Nurse are overpowered. (And I love all of them.)
---
I feel bad cause I just disconnected after getting downed first minute of the match and a teammate used bloody party streamers
---
Like 50 isn't enough? I understand you have a preference but I had a single character in Dark Souls 2 with 67 hours and could tell anyone with full authority that the enemy design and gameplay mechanics were horribly unpolished.
---
And so what? I won
---
It would make the game impossible for killers. Sure sometimes it is bullshit where I get the wiggle meter full and still get put on the hook but it would make the game much more difficult for killers. It already takes me 10 minutes to find a game so I dont need this turning people away from playing killer lol
---
Would be cool to get anything. I'm almost devotion 5.
---
Yeah, the game is supposed to be asymmetrical... *in the favor of the 1* in the 1v4. Not the 4. The killer is meant to be the power role, not the survivors.
---
I know bro &lt;3, sorry didn’t mean to start a shitstorm. 
---
Some days I play really good some days the framerate and sensitivity get the best of me
---
No, you don't need any dlcs at all to play. Enjoy your killing/surviving!
---
No you don't need to buy anything to play on any maps, dlc is doesn't nothing in terms of base game
---
You are right 
---
It's nbd. This might get downvoting but honestly I don't think disconnecting matters. You're like "Ha I sure showed him!" And the killer is probably chuckling to themselves that they got you that tilted. I dc quite a bit myself, the important thing is to have fun I think
---
&gt; Because a lot of Hags are playing poorly.
---
So litterally every hag I have played against has been playing her poorly? Really? Sounds like a lot of people are just hyping up Hag instead of accepting she's just mid tier at best.
---
&gt; Crouching while in chase?
---
When you are being chased, just pay attention to where you are running and you will be fine. Same deal with Trapper's traps. Or are Trapper's traps a problem for you too?
---
&gt; That's good enough and you have to adjust a web to the situation (I mean change it)
---
Except it isn't, especially against any decent Survivors who make sure to have all the gens spread out. Also, it takes time to arrange a decent web, so there is no adjusting to the situation.
---
Plus, if you are in a situation where you even need to change your web mid game, you've already lost. 
---
&gt; So they are going to crouch around map and flashing a flashlight? It's not really possible and their flashlight would just go off
---
Was that even english? Edit this part and maybe you'd make some sense.
---
&gt; Nurse is slower, lol ;)
---
Nice cocky wink. Except with Nurse, she can TELEPORT AT WILL. Any Nurse with half a brain uses her blink in a chase. It's like you don't even play this game and are only basing your claims on stuff you've seen on Twitch/YouTube.
---
Looks like you still have nothing my guy, but please, keep trying to prove me wrong. I got nothing better to do today ;)
---
TOGETHER, WE RIDE
---
Yeah, thats actually a cool feature
---
This has happened to me a few times. You can tell which killer will do it in the lobby if they keep readying and unreadying. I'm pretty sure it's a program that they are using to press swing and triangle. I think they are farming shards, since pressing Triangle on the PS4 allows you to ready up, unready, create a lobby and leave a finished game. Thats why they leave a game so fast. The swinging is just so they don't get disconnected from the game.
---
I'm still fairly new I can't even juke just got pissed off, been getting shit on all day
---
You just dumb or stupid?
