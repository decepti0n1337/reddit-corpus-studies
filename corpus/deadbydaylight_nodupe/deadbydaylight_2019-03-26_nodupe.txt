It's balanced without voice comms because the game was designed that way, the average survivor isn't handicapped compared to their peers or the competition by playing without voice crutches, and cake fucking easy to tell how many perks and game mechanics are undermined with it's use. I have no other way of communicating to you what kinds of benefits you and I get when we play with voice comm, benefits that *you already acknowledged* in other posts to me. 
---
---
---
&gt; Almost everyone plays both. Yet, I still doubt you're rank 1 or even in red ranks on survivor. That's okay, there's nothing wrong with that.
---

---
Except I have. You don't need to believe me, there's nothing wrong with that. I know the truth and that's what matters. I don't need to provide "proof" because someone decided not to believe me. You don't matter to me. 
---
I'd call xbox, and email the devs.

I think she looks pretty cute, not sure why you disagree.
---
I'd contact Customer Support, also check your email for a transaction receipt to see if the money actually went out
---
I get way more Shapes and Doctors than Billys.  Actually, I get very few Billys, and judging by the PSN trophies, very few people actually play Billy on PS4.
---
both have proven to be extremely helpful every time I've had to contact them.
---
Funny I had this happen to me too while playing the plague. Everyone disconnected simultaneously while I was lunging. Was this during the new matchmaking or was this after it was taken down?
---
Well it sort of depends on how it's done. You can easily pull of dyed hair and achieve the "cutsie kawaii" sort of deal. I'm not sure if they did that with Susie, but they got close. 
---
Nothing is above adrenaline.
---
Survivors you want to be able to take it off never get it off. Survivors you don't want to be able to get it off first try always do. 
---
 Had a game where a Kate got screwed over by her team and left for dead basically. She couldn't find the hatch and was desperately trying to get the trap off. I was following her to keep the chase up and help. Luckily I found the hatch so I downed her and dropped her by it. If I hadn't found the hatch she would've died, it was so close.
---
It's typically either cleansed before anyone can be downed or all totems have been cleansed before the last gen is done. i never called you a survivor main, and I can tell you aren't because you have some legitimate insights into the game. you're right that it's not necessary, but no perks are "necessary" merely helpful. Those are fairly weak killers for most people but it depends on personal play style. I personally main Freddy and routinely get to rank 5 even though I can only play on weekends for a few hours at a time. And NOED is kinda mandatory on any endgame build. I'm not saying it's perfectly balanced and amazingly fun every time it's used. I am saying that it's not COMPLETELY op, has some pretty easy counters, doesn't go off about a third of the time, and is generally pretty easy to deal with. it's fine the way it is, but some people will abuse it, same with everything in this game.
---
And yet, survivor still isn't difficult to play or succeed with. You don't need voice-comm crutches to beat a killer. You'll be ok without them, too. 
---
The most boring killer matches are when you completely destroy 4 solo queue survivors without even trying. Yet the reddit killers want that to be the norm when they play killer. Its just sad. 
---
I’ll solo queue as survivor and try my hardest to save everyone while sacrificing myself but it gets discouraging when you run a killer around for 2+ minutes using minimal pallets and a gen barely gets popped. When you go down you see 1 is in the basement searching the chest and 2 claudettes were crouched by the trees with a flashlight watching you get chased so they can go for an “epic” flashlight save.
---
I’m certain that its not even about SWFs being strong at this point, its about reddit killers wanting 4ks handed to them on a silver platter. I’ve seen streamers solo queue and everyone joins seperately, but it turns out they were all pretty good survivors while the killer wasnt very good and they all escape. Killer immediately says in post game chat “fucking loser SWF tryhards” and leaves. Killer is the easiest its ever been at the moment and yet people still find excuses for their mediocrity.
---
Feels real bad, man.
---
More than you know. I’m another thread someone told me to die and not take the game so seriously.
---
They have a tattoo of the logo...
---
maybe someone will save and edit
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
would be amazing if someone did tho lol 
---
I'm like 80% sure they are going to revert the rank system soon similar to the matchmaking. Considering how much backlash they are getting from it &amp; that its complicating adept achievements, I doubt they will keep it on live for long. 
---
no but you do need at least one other survivor who isnt a complete idiot to at least stand a chance against a mediocre killer. good luck finding that while solo queueing.
---
No, good not get my stalk on as Myers, Gave me a ruff start, and i made several poor choices.
---
hehe thank u :-)
---
Yeah I agree 100%. In a competitive multiplayer game, just having extra challenge isn’t enough of an incentive to use the perk. We either need the perk reworked to fit a specific play style (probably a stealth based one, giving it the full IW effect) or give people more incentives to use it (with extra bloodpoints end of trial)

I'm pretty sure OP made it using some sort of 3D model software but it's still impressive nonetheless.
---
Im amazed it made it past because everyone hated it in the PTB. The majority were against yet despite that they pushed it forward. I suppose they took it as its a design choice as listening to the community can be a double edged sword. 
---
Considering how killer mains have made posts talking about how looping should be bannable &amp; that killers should be granted moris when the exit gate is powered while survivors mains complained that DS used to be balanced &amp; that Pallet Vacuum was a good thing. I can understand why they can stray away from bending to the community. 
---
What confused me is that even their fog whisperers like Tru3 were saying that the piping was too unfair. Then again he said that survivor pipping was decent &amp; have no drastic changes.
---
Toxicity isn't the main issue with SWF groups, it's the 4 way play by play that you can give each other.
---
Its actually amazing that they got away without giving rewards for ranking up for this long. Something like Bloodpoints+shards for hitting rank 1 as both killer and survivor. 
---
But the bloodpoint economy! We balance OP shit by making it cost alot of virtual points to get alot of them!! Haha totally not our fault guys!
---
I prefer billy, but in green. 
---
Ok, so you *do* disagree....what I'm interpreting from your post is that you believe that a team of 4 "B+" survivors up against a "B+" killer will result in the killer winning the match more often than not, without help from the map..?
---
When when you spawn 33 meters from Ruin
---
Im'a about to end this mans who session
---
Hahahahaha 
---
haha i consider you giving valid criticism as you just being salty so I can smugly laugh at you since Im not smart enough to have my own opinion, “lmao”.
---
Hmm I wonder if this is some sort of bug they have going on. Its like at a random interval the game will immediately lose connection of the survivors for a second, forcing them all to DC. 
---
Looking at how you got bp from the match, it was not you that DC but instead the survivors. It's like the peer to peer connection got disrupted spontaneously.
---
my opinion is i don’t care, it’s pretty much always been fine for survivor and decent for killer at all ranks.
---
I do hope they change the rank/emblem system back too. I'm okay with it for killers, as I still get a pip most games and I used to almost always get a double pip when not doing great, so it's slowing down my progress a good amount but not stopping it. Surivor ranks are just so weird now. I've been at the same rank, same pip spot for four days. Games where I do well and escape are downranks, games where I do next to nothing and die are black pips, and pipping is so rare. I'm just not sure what they expect survivors to do now, since you never really get enough time to do everything needed for a pip.
---
Because when I play solo I get instantly saved and farmed off hook and when I play with a SWF the perk becomes less useful. It is a great perk though
---
The information isnt useless, the survivors are
---
Nea and Feng! Badass Gal Pals.
---
I don't understand what seems to be their problem with matchmaking.  Anything over 5 minutes to find a match is unacceptable no matter what rank or platform.  This game has enough of a player base that this should never be an issue to pair 5 individuals, with similar locations, ranks, and pings. To me this is the biggest issue with this game over anything else .  It's 1 thing to get face camped or tunneled and mori, but at least ppl could stomach it if they knew they could hop right into the next match.  Wait 30 mins to find a game, get tunneled off first hook, wait 30 mins to find another game =UNACCEPTABLE and will kill this game completely.  I am hopeful they find a way to fix these problems, perhaps dedicated servers will help.
---
It boggles my mind how I can hop on a game of Apex and have a 60 man lobby in literally seconds (obviously a much larger player base) but this game can't match 5 people in a reasonable time frame when we know we have enough of a player count.
---
Look at all the denial in this thread dude, we're at a point where the majority of the posters ITT feel *handicapped* without voice comm. 
---
Rly? Links?
---
Put the Kate down, Lenny.
---
i need to know if solidarity works with no mither, im too lazy to test it myself
---
It was the start of optimizing performance to make it better over time.  If you're playing this game for the graphics, you may want to look into another game.
---
Pretty much somes up why corn maps are complete cancer for killers...
---
I play to have fun and not get headaches. 
---
This reddit makes me want to never play DBD again.

i love the amount of people getting the mice and men reference

I would have Sprint busted out to let him know he just passed me and then jumped in lol

U would be mad too

Survivors:
---
Claudette has a turtle face and is fugly
---
Jane is bleh 
---
Quentin looks like an alien 
---
Nea has a dude face
---
Killers: (good ugly, because they should be)
---
The doc with his Halloween outfit is pretty hideous 
---
Hags pretty ugly
---
The plague has some pretty things, but the decomposing body and half a face really makes those beautiful aspects even more ugly lol, in a good, creepy way
---
Hillbilly is fucked
---
The clown is pretty ugly with his thicc ass head 
---
PS4 is terrible again with friends. The new matchmaking was awesome. Time to quit again, thanks for bitching everyone...🙄
---
Okay I don't know if these points were touched and I'm not going to look as I have my own as well. SWF can be bullshit. I'm a killer main BUT i do do SWF nightly with my girl and such. So I know from both experiance. 
---
Against a SWF can be fun or toxic as a killer it's difficult to do anything because people are co operating with voice and if you were to take a step in any direction, people are going to just announce where you're st and everyone gets stuff done with communication. Doesn't sound bad right? 
---
SWF wasnt originally in the game, only latched on after many complaints and requests. (Why do you think when you finish a game you're alone and gotta reinvite?) The game originally was supposed to be a horror survival game with not knowing anything about the killer, the other survivors or anything. You were dropped in and hoped everyone was as good as you. 
---
Another thing that I'm glad they did was protect the perks and such of killers because whenever a game of SWF the dead would announce it all to their alive teammates for a better chance. 
---
As a person apart of SWF at times it's sometimes too easy? Communication is a huge deal and if you got good players it's a win streak.
---
I agree with you, don't spam the support people. They'll get back to you when they do, no need to be impatient and a jerk about it. 
---
Great, that didn't make anything better at all on my end. I actually almost always found a match in under one minute. Now, it takes way longer again and the past few matches have always been with a red rank killer(I'm in the lower purple rank).
---
My personal favourite is having iron grasp + agitation, getting a survivor that was really good and actually fun to play with that you catch in the end (usually bad teammates and/or a dc), carrying them past many MANY hooks to hatch, then let them wiggle off. and every time, without fail... they run away. It's impressive how stupid some people can be.
---
I was really hoping BHVR would learn from their mistakes, but it seems they haven't. It's a real shame too cause with the supposed servers coming during the summer,  I really want to keep playing and supporting them, but if they keep up their ways of not listening to people like Tru3, I don't think it will be worth playing even IF they get servers.  
---
Oh why did this make me laugh so hard. 
---
Exactly! Spamming so hard sometimes your finger slips and you get killed is horrid! PCs can use mouse wheel and nothing for us
---
LOL I’m going to do that to the next friend I get to play. That’s hilarious.
---
The game map offering: have 1 survivor gone in the loading screen have 1 survivor dc and have the other survivors give up
---
This is a really good idea and I'm not sure how it didn't occur to me. Thanks for this
---
Don't even have to Google patch notes, there's a News button on the main menu screen that contains the newest updates/patch notes.
---
I could explain, but clearly you're only interested in le epic emojis and lol ur badding. 
---
Clearly someone who's just starting to play. 
---
So do gens still get done faster with 2 people on them than one? 
---
Same here! I don't have a ton of hours, but I have played enough to the point where I'd much rather give the last guy hatch instead of a 4k 
---
Im gonna start a petition to change her name to Big Booty Judy
---
Ad a Bill main, can confirm. Jakes sandbag
---
For real just had a game against the hillbilly and i was chased 99% of the game.. The other amount of time spent healing people (didnt even manage to do a gen fully) and then i get locked in a corner and hooked and then when he finally finds this claudette who i had only seen once hiding in the bushes of the temple map he gave her the hatch... iwas LIVID
---
-OH- my Ding Ding Dong~
---
One time all 4 were running to the gates and I got hit with that tantrum, and caught the David in the stomach at the end. I let him go though
---

She's also a personal favorite of mine but I don't use her because she isn't very good
---
Nah, squadettes would have DC'ed against Legion.
---
The default fov makes me claustrophobic and I see survivors I normally wouldn't have (especially useful on Spirit to surprise attack survivors that thought I didn't see them).
---
People enjoy subverting the 'supernatural-killer-versus-helpless-teenager' trope. I know it's simplistic but I think it's mostly because of the game's aesthetic, I bet we'd have seen less toxicity from that side of the aisle if survivors were like heads of cabbage or something, and the killer was a malnourished kid or something chasing them. It's just harder to empathize with that 6'10 dude carrying a chainsaw and trying to murder you, ya know?
---
I'm pretty sure the Legion killers Frank and Julie are a couple.
---
Instead of a strong exhale out of my nose, I actually laughed. Well done. 
---
Resigned Martyr sounds like it could be incredibly fun and clutch
---
Oh no, the Clown violated Rules 56, 72, and 89 of the Survivor Rule Book

Remove the speed boost from the perk and give survivors a totem counter so they know how many totems are left on the map. Also buff anti-totem perks.
---
You guys used decisive strike as a excuse to have noed..lol. Dstrike rewarded bad plays and NOED rewards bad killers who couldn't get a kill. They both need to be remove.
---
The new Switch models are just pure speculation and last year Nintendo said they dont plan on releasing new models 
---
Ash Willams from Evil Dead got leaked if you somehow missed that
---
Wasting snack pallet like that smh my head
---
If the ps4 fanbase keeps making enough requests for it I wouldn't be surprised if BHVR implement it back onto console. Would need a large following through as some console players may be against it.
---
I don't think that it need that big of a change, I feel a nice quality of life change is show the killer has noed once the last gen is done not when someone gets hit
---
Give it a speed boost 10%/15%/20% and remove the expose effect or make it only expose one survivor. 
---
Which leads to the same result.
---
Games move too fast as is. If you can't survive long enough to cleanse totems, you're either bad and need to git gud or you were facing a decent Nurse.
---
I mean, they’re more like goggles than shades... but I was holding a highly processed sugar beverage masquerading as an energy drink while telling kids how **X-TREME** they’d be if they made their parents buy it for them!
---
Put totem count in the hud to close the gap between swf and solo. Right now, solo survivors cannot reliably counter NOED because other survivors might decide not to cleanse the totem they had found. 
---
Indication that NOED is at play right after all gens are completed. Knowing there is NOED will give players a fighting chance before it's too late, like right now. 
---
Yeah actually I mostly play survivor solo. Hence why I can see the balance issues. Take it you're a killer nain assuming everyone runs 4 man swf speaking on voice coms like it's a swat operation.
---
Killers dodge lobbies then pick hilly, instasaw and an ebony. Its ridiculous how tryhard some people are.
---
Wraith may get the blood-points.   
---
  
---
But Fred will get the glory.
---
Oh man I'd love a silent ambush add-on. Or one that further reduces the red stain/terror radius fade from 4 seconds to like 2.
---
So do people use unbreakable now? Or is it still a bad perk?
---
My Devout and Malicious emblems are suffering hard today. 
---
I've learned its fine to dodge lobbies if you see items you dont like,  cosmetics you dont like, oe players who look like they might put uo some decent resistence...
---
However don't you dare dodge ebony moris or iri heads or anything or the sort as the killer mains will run crying to the devs asking for more punishments.
---
You are talkibg about high ranks in old matchmaking but right now in low ranks it is even worst. High ping and insta dc after game starts and again wait in lobby for 10 mins to get 15rank game.

Sloppy is one of those consistently useful perks. I like Whispers because I personally find tracking hard while I find the actual chase to be rather easy. The one problem I have with Sloppy on Clown is that it makes Sulphic Acid Vial fairly redundant, so swap off of Sloppy if you want to use SAV.
---
Dead Hard 5
---
I had a fellow survivor (p3 nea) follow me all game trying to get killers attention. I messaged him and told him to do gens and stop sabotaging our team. He replied that he’s a P3 and already cleansed hex totem so we have to do everything else smh. I did 3 gens then died and of course they got hatch....but not before t-bagging me on hook first smh
---
I agree. But how do prevent noed clense totems there are only 5. How do you stop adrenaline kill the survivors or never let it get to end game. To me Noed has already 3 or so counters.
---
It does if I’m the one getting the hatch :3
---
Save the Best for Last is consistently good on any multi-hit chase Killer (Wraith, Doctor, Freddy, Pig, Spirit) and is particularly good on Clown because he slows people. You can often get multiple hits between loops with enough tokens.
---
Fired Up should only really be taken along with Brutal Strength. It's okay on Clown because Clown does a *lot* of pallet Monch Cronching since people tend to drop pallets early against him. It's also decent on Clown because of his low overall map pressure: generators are done fairly fast against Clown and often games come down to the final gen or no gens at all, where Fired Up is really good.
---
Whispers is just a generally good tracking perk and I'm bad at finding survivors. :P

LF gets someone in the basement. You're thinking "well that persons dead" because you know how LF is gonna play. You're debating whether you're gonna risk it or not if he goes far enough away. You're watching and he doesn't leave the basement. You figure, fuck it I better rush gen.......oh there goes Meg running before LF has even left. Down she goes, now there are 2 on the hook. Well he sure as hell isnt going to leave now I guess me and bill better rush these gens....oh there goes Bill charging in. Now all 3 are on the hook and only 1 gen is done. Better rush this one before he comes, oh and hes here with bbq. Well GG.
---
It really sucks the fun out of the game. Many survivors just have no knowledge of the game. That's why people are choosing swf, because at least they get people of similar skill who they can rely on.
---
Oh wow…that’s actually a ton! It’s almost been a year 
---
This is the Q before the Q. In Australia its fucked.
---
You can hit find game, then wait 5 minutes before your lobby opens... and the people come and go for ages.
---
You don't appear here: https://dbd.onteh.net.au/
---
Until after the first pre-queue is done.
---
That would be so broken. By the end of the game a lot of pallets will have been used leaving you with nothing but windows to defend yourself against a killer that is ridiculously fast. What NOED needs imo is either a pre emotive warning that you are exposed or a totem counter, preferably tied to a perk like small game to make it more viable, and it could probably stand to lose the speed boost. That would put it in a better place to me. 
---
Looks like a contest of dumb and dumber where Legion lost. 
---
GG.
---
Platform: PC
---
Type of bug: In game
---
Description: If you're The Pig and a survivor disconnects when you are carrying them, your crouch ability bugs for the rest of the match. Anytime you press crouch, she will crouch but then immediately stand up. You still gain the ability to ambush, still move as slowly as when you're crouched, and you still lose your terror radius, but you're as visible as you are when standing up.
---
Nothing seems to fix it (still persists after picking up someone else, putting on a Reverse Bear Trap, breaking a pallet, etc).
---
I feel like these players are the ones I see immersed crouching all the way on the opposite side of the match when I'm hooked and the killer is chasing someone else.
---
Although I can see your perk idea is to provide a stealth perk for killers, I wouldn't see it come into much use. 
---
Survivors have very few perks that display the killer's aura. Even then having the killer's aura displayed isn't much of a game changer. It just seems that the perk you have suggested doesn't do much for killers. The only time I would see this perk come into play is if a survivor were to run object of obsession or use breakdown on occasion. 
---

Wraith actually has some of my favorite Killer cosmetics in the store. They keep to his theme but also really up his wow factor. The Hallowed Blight head honestly fits just about everything and the new set he got for Valentines day is so nice. (And the weapon looks fantastic)

r/dadbydaylight
---
Yeah, it would be pretty OP but like you said, a bunch of the builds in this game are with the right combo of add-ons. 
---
No it's definitely the people who pick and choosethe opponents they face an dodge lobby after lobby after lobby.
---
People don't use voice comms because it gives them an advantage. They want to chat and play with their friends like they would in any other game because it's more fun. Shocking I know. However yes a big advantage comes along with having thstz nobody is going to deny that. However sef having an advantage due to voice comms doesn't change the fact that killers cry for more survivor nerfs due to swf but then dodge swf anyway.
---
Except they increased her terror radius. M&amp;A gives her a 24 terror radius so you can see their aura before they get a terror radius. It's not needed on Piggy, but it pairs well with her power and Nurse's.
---
Can say that I have woken up a friend who was taking a nap at my place by getting spooked by a killer creeping up on me   10/10 
---
I feel attacked.
---
I'd argue viability tho.  
---
I mean, Like the Trapper, I love my big boi Evan, but lets be honest.  
---
He rocks at low and mid, but when the teams get smart and in the 7-ish ranks, his games become somewhat luck of the draw.   
---
With him, if the team is smart, you are going to have about half guaranteed escape. I mean, sure, you can play effectively and have matches where this doesn't happen, but 1 piece of gold in 20 pieces of burning wood isn't really going after if the fire is hot enough, and we all know Trapper got thighs of FIRE
---
I quite like your suggestion of small game maybe having a totem counter, giving you an incentive to hunt down all the totems in the match. Would be a direct counter to NOED but leaves the survivor with only 3 perk slots. It also encourages the survivors time being spent hunting down the dull totems as opposed to just doing gens which slows the game down for killers. 
---
Makes everyone happy. No NOED for survivors due to a perk for fighting against it and slightly longer games for killers.
---
I’d have asked if they can be red after the new ranking system, which I doubt because they would have a bigger ego stirring with the reds.

Was it like that all game?
---
&gt;People don't use voice comms because it gives them an advantage. They want to chat and play with their friends like they would in any other game because it's more fun.
---
That's like saying that people don't dodge SWF lobbies because it gives them an advantage, they do it because it's more fun getting a balanced group instead. Both statements are true. Both sides are doing the same thing for the same reasons.... they're just trying to have fun and enjoy their night.

Lel 50 days wait for a reply and people calling it spam. I wonder if these players ever get their pizza delivery.

I'm pretty sure that was a joke, git gud is almost never a serious remark.
---
Lol
---
I'm in the video, I was in a discord call with them. I didn't think I would need put /s on my post but it seems like I must 
---
Hey, some people just live in their little world. And it can be taken as such. I just couldn’t move on it hit the right nerve after a night of terrible matchups and awful randoms. Lol
---
I actually would really like this game to stop getting new players or at least get them at a much slower rate. I'm so fucking tired of having people with less than 50 hours on my team as high as rank 12 who do literally fucking nothing all game and run Self-Care/Urban Evasion. They actually do nothing.
---
Hey sometimes man it can get taken the wrong way. 
---
Truly the pose of horror &amp; despair.
---
No hard feelings hun. 
---
Ain't a true solo survivor experience if the Killer doesn't hit you with NOED after you did 3-5 gens solo AND unhooked 2-4 times AND ran the killer for 3-5 minutes. Feels really rewarding to play against NOED :)
---
People always say "Just do totems" but you know what would really help? Just fucking leave! Dicking around after the gates are open is what kills the survivors 90% of the time. 
---
Hope your night gets better my guy, it sucks having bad match ups 
---
*T3 music kicks in*
---
... Why you teaching everyone how to do it?
---
This has been my life for the last half a fucking year. Every nerf to SWF/buff to killer just puts solo survivor further in the dirt. I swear to god this game is practically unplayable solo.
---
Lol thanks hun. I really like my rant and I’d like to not delete it however given that a random reader may get salty knowing you meant it as a joke I’m going to delete it to save myself a headache later. 
---
Dude, Huntress is second hardest killer to get kills with imo. So props, but goddamn start with an easier killer. 
---
Alright iv been thinking of this for awhile now. So NOED wont be a hex but more of a perk like rancor. Instead of it lasting the entire end game make it have tokens. Tier 1 grants 2 insta downs tier 2 grants 3 insta downs and tier 3 grants 4 insta downs. Each down will consume a token. Plus survivors are notified when NOED is active just like rancor. This makes it a bit more balanced out in my opinon.
---
Its the same way when a survivor DCs. In any capacity, if someone DCs the other 4 players in the match will likely depip. But the killer almost certainly will if a survivor DCs and if the killer DCs early enough in the game the 4 survivors will depip. 
---
Also, with so many aura perks and add ons for the killers, the perk will be dead in like 2 seconds!
---
That's something only a dev would say

Sadly people like this find it amazing to show off very basic skills that survivors can learn and abuse against console killers with poor fps and latency

I'm happy with a survivor that isn't the exact same body type as all the other female survivors imo. And this song is a classic?

Not with this game, no.

Why did they make sure to draw the entire eye ball?

our SWF keeps losing 1/2 or 3/4 in sudden simultaneous disconnects.   
---
What is going on?
---
I don't think that's entirely true. The trapper, spirit, legion, nurse, huntress (?), plague all have really nice uncommon tier and pretty good common pallete swaps, while all wraith gets is someone drawing on his clothes with a white sharpie. Some of the recolors are nice tho.
---
True. It’s a good idea but you would really have to set those up. It says that the break function changes whenever she chooses something else. It’s too much set up that would fail more often than work

Yeah and Billy has some ridiculous snowball potential with BBQ of he gets and early hook. A lot of survivors can counter it but I still see auras frequently with it.

Im sorry that i appreciate the devs, i guess i should shit on the people that gave me a game i enjoy.

The devs arent always the best but they are a small company, also they are humans and they sometimes make mistakes but they try to keep relevancy to their game, btw you can check my profile if you want proof im not a dev.

---
It really fits Dead by Daylight’s subtle and rather depressing themes and motifs.
---
This is some genuine critique and isn't meant in any harmful way.
---
The music is really obnoxious and causes auditory overload mixed in with the games music, sounds and your voices. That's already an issue, but then there's more sound effects mixed inbetween and it just makes it even more unpleasant to listen to.
---
You gotta decide what you wanna do. If you want your voices to be heard, take away most of the sound effects. Most compilations are without voices, that's why there's so many (and honestly too many) sound effects in most of them. But if you have voices, that's what people wanna focus on. 
---
The music is just very much a taste thing and you're gonna lose half the people alone from that. It wouldn't be too bad if there was no ingame music, but those overlap a lot.
---
it would be good to use with rancour. besides there are plenty of killer perks that are only useful in very specific situations
---
Eh, I am Killer, is what I do.
---
Real talk I was in a game with that claudette and I swear it was the longest game I've ever had. I had to just give up at a certain point and give myself to the entity because it really wasn't worth the suffering especially because I knew that last gen would never get done
---
I like Lithe or Balanced Landing for chases, it helps give an extra boost to get away and hide so killer can’t find you. Personally don’t really like Sprint Burst because I feel like I can never run around unless I’m in a chase.
---
I’ll use Adrenaline if I have it, but i’ve been trying Hope instead on Dwight and I like it too.
---
If I have aura reading perks, like Empathy or Bond I’ll use it because I like knowing whether or not my team is actually doing gens or if they need help. I’m playing a lot of Jane rn, so I like that I have Empathy so I can use Solidarity better; I’ve healed myself completely while healing other survivors a few times, it’s nice.
---
Urban Evasion is fun, especially if you’re just starting out. It’s good to practice being sneaky without being too slow.
---
The one perk i will ALWAYS run on everyone as long as I have it is Borrowed Time. It’s come in clutch so many times, especially for camping killers.
---
Seriously, WTF
---
Imma survivor main and even that totem placement pisses me off smh... so many good places to stick em too..
---
Shirtless Jesus to the rescue 
---
There geolocation code they wrote was trash! I kept getting matched up with people in different country’s with high ping or 250 and up, the devs at bhvr skipped geography class or something! Live in the southeast USA, I would get people from japan, UK, Australia and a ton from South America, had fast match making but always someone not on U.S. soil probably 1-10 games I would get someone here in the states. So I would back out 
---
I used to be at red rank once, i can confirm ps4 killers dont use anyone beside billy at red ranks, but its even worse at lower ranks they only play myers, give me toxic legion PB spirit but not another myers. 
---
*survivor t-bags at a pallet*
---
“Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer”
---
That is not true. Calm spirit completely negates the aura reveal not aura reading because infectious fright doesn't reveal the aura but reveals the location. In simple terms not like bbq. Exactly like doctor tiering you up.
---
You really want mouse &amp; keyboard nurses on your console games?
---
For me it's moreso that survivor mains are such dickheads that they shit talk and BM even low tier killers when they escape. They make me believe they are so bad that it's the first time they've escaped all week.
---
Therefore, Nurse/Spirit/Billy are all I need.
---
Exactly. Not to mention the crows but even though its pointless it could help some time. Calm spirit isnt as bad of a perk as left behind or vigil

She was trying to slug. She originally had me and dropped me for my friend, downed him, and hooked him and then tried hooking me.

It's only for a split second after the unhook so most killers just wait

Killer saw me once all match and I never took a hit. I repaired the last gen with the other survivors dead and managed to open the gate without her seeing me. Yet I get a silver in evade? I don't even care for the ranks, I want those bloodpoints. However this is so damn flawed that I had to throw my screenshot on the pile.

---
As far as I’m concerned, if you’re running a P3 Claudette, clicking your flashlight the entire game and running around not helping the other survivors, I will face camp your ass just for being a detriment to the game just because they want to be OchiDo Jr. I will sit there and watch you go through the states the second any survivor over clicks their flashlights. 
---
Or SWF groups that decide to try to be bullies or acting like scumbags during the game. I have a build just for that occasion. 
---
“Hey guys what’s that music”
---
when you run the killer for 5 gens and escape for a safety pip is annoying
---
Im offended
---
I mean, the main purpose to help with ambush attacks, mostly. It's situational, but hell if there aren't a lot of other Killer perks that aren't. 
---
that console movement was giving me anxiety. Thought she was going to wiggle free.
---
I saw a suggestion for rebalancing NOED posted here a while ago. Despite what a lot of people on this sub claim “just cleanse totems”, cleansing all 5 totems is hard. 
---
So NOED should scale according to how many totems have been cleansed. Depending on how many totems have been cleansed, the killer gets a number of insta-downs on the survivors. That would scale with the rank of the NOED that the killer has unlocked. So this way the survivors don’t feel completely fucked if they cleansed all but 1 totem. Or, have to worry about not knowing how many totems have been cleansed.
---
[It sure would be fun, wouldn't it.](https://i.imgur.com/VZicYUx.png)
---
I mean it specifically says the closer you are to the killer. After you secured red in generators you should have been trying to get closer to the killer. Its too easy to just avoid the killer the whole time. Not to mention pretty sure regardless of rank thats a pip, in your case two. There's plenty wrong with the new system, but this is a poor example. 
---
She was a main character in the TV show Becker. 
---
I was wondering whether the joke was worthy of being on that sub.
---
They could made not fuck up every single fucking thing they so, that would be a nice change.
---
If it's a killer with honor, they'll recognize the farm (if intentional) and go after the idiot who tried that. 
---
Maybe it was balanced when the game came out but it's certainly not the case now. 
---
With the new PIP system it gives the killers a much better advantage because you KNOW what a survivor needs in order to keep advancing in rank. You can plan around it. Especially at higher ranks.
---
Shit, even with comms SWF can only really be beneficial for a 2 man. Past a certain rank 3-4 man groups run the risk of de-ranking because not everyone will be able to get enough points just to safety PIP. 
---
With how things currently are the killers have a pretty good advantage and SWF groups of 3 or more are going to disappear from red ranks and possibly purple ranks.
---
Head as empty as a hermits address book 
---
I thought they fixed this bs already.. *sigh*
---
I play with a headset too and I haven’t heard anything either. Here’s one of the [videos](https://youtu.be/GanvD5zVy_M), if you skip to 11:20, he hears the totem. After turning up my phone volume, I can hear a slight crackle but i’ve never heard this on ps4. It doesn’t look like he’s running a perk for it either 
---
Which why I always refer to those maps as the Grandma Swamp. 
---
Yep. If this happened all game, then its a hack. Submit this footage along with your name and the circumstances when you report them, assuming you haven't already.

oh my god the endgame mori one, i was there for that! yeah... a LOT of killer mains don't see that we're actually in the power role again(lets see how long BHVR lets that last) &amp; want to buff us to all hell because of... reasons, AKA squadettes &amp; or them just not being great at killer.
---
Fair point, been in JS land a real long time...
---
I'm inclined to think that they're just trying to discourage the use of moris as a means of ranking up, which I can understand to an extent, but man, to de-pip after 4K-ing a team with an Ebony seems extreme. Same with your case too considering Devour requires you to get at least 5 hooks to get it to full strength.

For a while I went on a mission to get as many adept achievements as I can on Xbox. I got all adept survivor and most of adept killers. Imagine to my shock when Plague came out and I got a 4k with her perks. Originally I thought that it just took a bit to unlock.
---
Nope. It never unlocked. And now my mission is completely ruined by this update. I have lost all motivation to do it again. Hopefully they actually fix it soon. I wanna get my achivement hunt back on.
---
Right?! Always fun to add some levity to this game, especially when folks DC out
---
It would be cool if this was how he carried dying survivors in game

Don't forget Blood Warden.

Genuinely lol

I wish I had friends that played the game :(
---
We stan a friendly clown 
---
I ran a Chaser build a few days ago and saw this screen too. First ever in two years. 
---
I wasn't expecting this, I'd say this is a good change because I wasn't being able to find matches as fast as before so maybe now that will be reverted. I wish the rank was maybe changed to before too as now it is just too hard, or maybe just ''eased'' a bit.
---
PS4 is back to being complete shit. Fuck man, this change sucks again. These wait times as solo and even with one friend are ridiculous long again for PS4. :/
---
&gt; Yeah.....turns out the new pipping system is not very kind

---
Yet another on the way to the basement, yada yada yada. 
---
I was a red rank last season. I felt like I ran into more Spirits and even Nurses than Billys at the high ranks, but maybe that was just me.
---
Because it's a shit community.
---
Right?!
---
There's no way I would've been able to do this if even one of them thought to do that last gen
---
This game for me has turned into playing on rank reset, where Ill reset to either 14-15, and on for a bit until I get to the purple ranks. Then I stop since there is literally *no point* to ranking up. Unless you want to run into shit like this every game. 
---
Wouldn't enjoy the 15 FPS it would play at. They have problems as is with that.
---
He plays like Nurse, they both ignore everything and both have a long stun after using thier powers. Why don't people have the same energy for Nurse?  I don't find Legion too bad to play against. I rather face him then Plague who's extremely annoying. 
---
Because Nurse is a lot “harder” to play than Legion. 
---
Plague sucks too. 
---
Once someone learns how to play her, she's a monster. 
---
Right. 
---
That’s the learning curve and her return on investment. 
---
Legion is far easier. 
---
I think you get your DC pips back.. I’m not 109% sure but when I take a break from the game at rank 7, I’ll log back in and be rank 6 and a couple pips 
---
Are you having fun getting shit on by my Nurse/Billy/Spirit/Legion? Because that's why that happens.
---
I think there is some kind of bug rn. Lately the game disconnects me from a trial but tells me that the killer disconnected. I get to keep my item and earned points, but don't receive escape points. I've seen others say the same is happening to them, and some in swf say that they got disconnected, it said the killer had disconnected, but their friend was still playing in the trial with the killer obviously still connected.

Yes. Yes! YESSS! *maniacal laughter*

Uhh he’s kinda worse than freddy as it is. 
---
Your first mistake was teaching him to teabag.
---
How I got my evil incarnate perk was all survivors just teabagging with no gens done and I got my unlimited ew3. They tried to run after I grabbed the first one but it was no use at that point 
---
DS was the only major issue, instaheals can be annoying but there's nothing really wrong with them since they're so expensive and so rare.
---
Source: am killer main
---
It used to give you your pips back the next game, but they've changed it now. Killer DC = survivors lose pips. There's a bug currently where say you started at rank 7 like you did, if you log off when you're a lower rank it'll rubber band you back to your initial rank the next time you log in.
---
Ds is nerfed
---
Lmao what? I'm just stating facts and making fun of the fact it was Freddy who cannot do shit to you. 
---
Well yeah, obviously, but a bigger budget on next gen hardware could get it there.  A boy can dream, eh?
---
Wow. Both of those hits look like bullshit 😵 I hate this game so much why can’t I stay away....
---
I also see zero reason to play trapper over hag when
---
They both do identcial things. Hag as the same and arguably better map control then the trapper hag traps harder to see and require you to slow down completely to avoid or bring a flashlight since stepping near them active them.
---
She has so many way to play her some even mimicking the trapper the only thing that gets me 100% of the time with trapper is the trap at the killer shake every time.
---
Yeah, seems fine to me. If you were far away from the killer the whole time then that's gonna be no evader points. You get more from being in heartbeat and not being seen, and losing the killer during chases.
---
Am I the only person who actually research's killer abilities and perks so I won't get caught off guard
---
I love when I get outplayed like this. 
---
/s
---
So trapper
---
I thought they already do that or?? 
---
Heavy smoker nurse is better

The reward is... the rank.  Some people find it fun and interesting to test their skills against the player base of a game and see where they fall within the group. The reward is the challenge of reaching for the next rank and achieving it.  I don't understand and can't relate to the concept of a challenge being meaningless unless you get a reward.  I get it, I'm old (36), but it we used to think it was fun to play video games and find out who was best.  College dorms had halo and street fighter competitions where the reward was winning! You do you, but ask yourself if this game is really something you enjoy if its causing you such anger.
---
idle hands could be fun
---
I disagree
---
Fight fire with fire, it’s funnier when you can upset someone trying to upset you.  It backfires in their face and they can’t take it. 
---
The only thing that would make that sweet revenge better, is if they sent hatemail afterwards, because I LIVE for the salt 
---
Every single game I play against her
---
If you get upset over a video game then you need to rethink your life.
---
Are killers responsible for the survivors enjoying the game? No, and neither am I.
---
I'm assuming it means while they're being carried or mori'd. 
---
You’re probably the type of person to call Kate of the spirit thicc. Jane is the literal definition of what thicc is. you’re just dumb. She doesn’t even have a bigger stomach. And even if she did, that doesn’t cancel out being thicc. She has a big butt, larger thighs and boobs. She’s thicc.

I like no0b3 just fine, but legit the guy needs some new sound effects.

Ps4 wait times are abysmal once again
---
Yeah I have, I didn't know pipping actually effected it though
---
Well this sucks. My friends and I were just starting to get back into the game too. Guess I'll just have to only play killer. rip swf wait times on ps4 being 30 plus minutes. 
---
F
---
Went back and looked at the vod, it's iri stone and stitched bag. Not a bug.
---
This happens more often than I like to admit at around rank 9-13, which is the set I'm usually around at as I play casually, there have been a ton of matches where the person sees me stares me down as I stalk them, and then when I stab them after almost max gauge for 3 they flail around like a turkey.
---
True story. When I first started playing, I did killer a bit first. I noticed that even when people didn't teabag they'd let me get a hit in at the gate before they escaped. I switched to survivor and never escaped. Finally I did get the gates open and I figure I'm gonna be nice and do the same to this killer. I stand there halfway through the gate and just stare at Myers. He's staring at me. I hear his music go off and just assume that's part of the game when Myers is close to you. It goes off again and he immediately charges me. Still I stand there just waiting for him to get his last hit in so I can leave. Downed immediately. Hooked. Camped. Dead. I just sat there in awe and stared at the screen for a good five minutes wondering what the fuck just happened. I find out in the no stupid questions thread what happened. Fuck me.
---
I have it bound to F. The spacebar was too inconsistent and I had to move my hand farther away.
---
Lmao love the video. Tho I don’t understand why you didn’t mend thru your borrowed time?
---
I have a similar story. I was the only one hooked and one person was working on the last gen and other two were coming to get me. As soon as the last generator was on the two people turned around and headed for the door. The one dude was literally right in front of me, turned around and left. 
---
If it makes ya (or other Piggys) 🐖 feel better...I got RBT'd today. Made my way to the first Billybox but got chased off with the Killer patrolling nearby and had to move to another...turns out my instinct was correct...that 1st one was the one I needed after I visited all the others I got it off just at the last 2-3 seconds.

I remember seeing somewhere on here that someone gathered a shitload of data on bloodwebs in prestiged characters. It was real organized and all that. The results were that prestiging really does fuck-all. If you wanna get P3 for the cosmetics or icon, go for it. You won't get extra greens or purps in your bloodwebs, though.
---
So you're gonna sit here and complain about killers "picking and choosing their opponents" when survivors will disconnect against any killer they don't personally like going against? And I ain't talking about Legion. I have no issue with SWF. I played during the old patches of true infinite loops and 8 second self care, so some coordinated scrublords don't bother me. What bothers me is the hypocrisy of Reddit survivors complaining about the shit they engage in.
---
Survivors will forever bitch about any add ons that aren't brown and any mori that isn't cypress, just like some killers complain about going up against SWF with comms. I understand why survivors don't like mori offerings or shit like iridescent hatchet, but it's obvious to me that you will never understand why killers don't like dealing with Claudette Swat teams with instant heals.
---
Rather take the wait time than an unbalanced match tbh. Next they need to revert ranking system back until one makes sense imo.
---
When I play survivor I will body block the killer if he’s too close but I have to save. When I play killer I usually down and camp the person who did the farming.  
---
It's easier if your scroll wheel unlocks, you can just scroll once and it goes forever
---
...really?
---
I run kindred (I solo que a lot) so if I get hooked, while I'm usually the one doing the gens, everyone can see if you're hiding in the corner.
---
When you first see the plague vomit on someone
---
Now imagine getting this bug while in swf. Poor killer doenst stand a chance
---
My first time playing Myers I stayed in Evil Within I. Had no idea what I was doing. Accomplished nothing. 
---
I think the point of changing it is to add rank rewards soon.
---
Sounds like a good idea to me
---
Where is the no stupid question thread? 
---
They sound like miniature camp fires. It's faint but if you're really paying attention you'll hear it.
---
Nea and Nea &gt;:)
---
Relatable. I'm not playing this game until the devs bring out the Freddy rework, finally get rid of infinite loading screens or at the very latest get the dedicated servers up and running.
---
I just cannot be bothered to play this game when 25% of the time I try to get a match and it results in me opening task manager to force close the game. And then of course 50% of all games have 3 people or less and its very likely it will be an unfun match for me while I let the survivors farm (because honestly a 3 man game is bullshit and far too easy as killer) or I play survivor and its some tryhard 3 blink nurse who thinks they're good because they beat a 3 man solo queue.

*Top 10 Most Terrifying Creatures in Anime*
---
you know, its funny. almost everytime i get a toxic squad like that, i get a 3 or 4k. they tend to be too greedy, you know
---
r/woooosh
---
It must still be bugged. The adept and escape as X survivor dailies tend to glitch every chapter.
---
You'd much rather promote white-hood culture I'm guessing
---
Killer: Nurse, Spirit, Plague. 
---
Survivor: Jeff, Jane, Adam.
---
Damn, that sucks. I've been trying to go for all the achievements and this'll probably halt my progress for a bit
---
Not funny. Stuff like this is why good killers deal with toxic survivors and constant dcs. So thanks pal. 
---
Birds fly, grass grows, survivors complain and killers gotta kill.
---
By any means necessary, I will bring someone into the dark with me... even if I'm a hook camper when the gates are open. Lol
---
Billy, Doctor, Pig
---
Tapp, Claudette
---
This is true, but I mean can you blame them? 2nd best killer in the game and not as hard as nurse or spirit (hate going against good billys tho) 
---
Killer: Mikey, pig, spirit
---
Survivor: Nea, Feng, Meg. Primarily Nea though
---
i'm actually fairly certain that it's a Shatner mask turned inside out! still hilarious, though.
---
Oh but I’m Freddy. I’ll put you to slee- DARN
---
You'd be doing yourselves a favour; at least until the devs get around to fixing infinite loading screens or dedicated servers are released.
---
Tbh if it were just 1 single issue with the game it wouldn't be as bad but you have the lobby waiting times, bad ping, infinite loading screens, broken/unreworked killers (legion, freddy, extra blink nurse), ranking system, countless bugs and terrible balancing. It seems like the bigger the game gets, the worse the dev team becomes. 
---
I don't know if someone new got hired last year around when the curtain call chapter and the store were released but it just seems to be going downhill with more bugs and unbalancing with every update that passes. Not to mention the devs aren't exactly taking their PTB feedback on board at all (even though that's exactly what a PTB is for but okay devs). 
---
Besides the teabagging what they do that was bullying?
---
Yeah I had five in a row last night. I wouldn't mind but literally every single one camped too which was very annoying. 
---
I got away more than not but games where the killer camps the entire time just aren't fun. 
---
I’m a rank 3 LF so I guess I’m a close second.
---
*I don’t camp*
---
I always knew you needed Merciless Killer. I got 4 kills and double pipped which was apparently required anyway all with The Plague with only her three perks and no offerings. I discovered Add-Ons are ok to use 
---
That is really messed up.
---
You are correct its about 50k for a web at level 50 and probably more if you are p3 cause the better add-ons mean more blood points needed. The grind in this game is just insane and our of this world and BBQ and chili is a REQUIRED perk if you don't want to fucking double the already insane grind.
---
Yeah imagine playing a fun killer how dare they
---
the longer he stalks a survivor, the more Evil Within he builds, eventually letting him get to tier 3, which means an instadown. it's not infinite unless you use an add-on but it's spooky as shit regardless.
---
I legit show no mercy for those brave enough to enter muh basement. 
---
So many times they run in one after another just to be snatched while unhooking. 
---
All 4 survivors hooked in the basement at once. Feels good to know u ams bigger brain. 
---
I have literally all my hopes for this game riding on dedicated servers to hopefully fix the hit boxes and latency issues. But in the back of my mind if it’s latency issues why have these bullshit hits only started around the time legion was released. If it was purely latency this would have always a problem. 
---
You want something to halt your progress then try getting "Evil incarnate" legitimately 
---
Because it isn't a necessity, anyone who thinks every killer needs ruin is dogshit.
---
Ruin is good on lower-tier killers if you just play to win, but you dont need ruin to do well. 
---
Also apart from Nurse: Hag, Billy and Spirit definitely dont need ruin.
---
So if you think that ruin is a requirement you're trash (&gt;\^.\^)&gt;
---
that's weird
---
I don't know what game they're playing but it certainly isn't Dead by Daylight if they think they can get a lobby at high ranks on even their microwave.

I'm new to the game. What's the way to go about "farming"?
---
Oooh whatcha say
---
This is why I picked my favorite killer and my favorite survivor, P3 50'd and maxed out all the perks I want on both of them, and called it a day.
---
girl same, every time i've accepted a friend request from someone i've soloed with they've been a 19 year old dude, what's up with that?
---
I'm rank 10 survivor on PS4 and it takes forever to find a match now and if we're lucky enough we get matched by some rank 18 killer who has a swing macro on. Jesus Christ this game 
---
I just wanna get to the next game
---
you're very welcome! give him a play if you get a Shard for him, he's my main when i play killer. c:
---
Looks Good! 
---
I don’t know about just on PC, but it added a wait timer to make a lobby (which doesn’t make sense) and very often queues up survivors with all the wrong killers. As a  rank 8/9 survivor, I would get rank 2 killers. As a rank 15 killer, I would get rank 8/9 survivors. This was so consistent, it made it unfun to play and it felt absolutely hopeless. 
---
Basically a shameless attempt to emulate a highly successful post from the past made by the fabulous Bread Pear:
---
https://i.imgur.com/7Z9zzRd.jpg
---
Not a hack, a glitch. Others have posted from POV of survivor.
---
decisive is garbage now, and pretty much everyone has ruin anyways
---
Decisive is garbage but I just find ruin annoying but you know what I mean
---
Nah dude Bugs Bunny 
---
It's almost like the killer would rather the two of you leave that shitfest of a game immediately and move on.
---
Confirmation bias??
---
Really never thought ash would come to dbd 
---
Wow a tldr; would have been nice.
---
Bias? I used to like Legion when everyone hated him,  until I started playing the ones everyone hates. I've play two different legions tonight and both face camped,  one with insidious. It's been fun. 
---
Not really. As someone who has all the dlc, if I want a perk I grind for it. 
---
Take a look at bbq. So many killers have the perk and it’s only been on the shrine once. People will always find a way to get the strongest perks in the game. 
---
I was killer main before legion. Just got tired of survivors taking advantage of shitty console frames. So I joined them. 
---
Killer side isn’t that bad. But survivor side is just awful right now. 
---
Survivor: Nea
---
Killer: Hag and Freddy
---
It was funny enough as is, and then I ended up with killer emblems to top it off 
---
I think this has promise. However, you might want to adjust it for something like kindred, such as a 7-10 second timer before the next token is consumed (I think they ought to implement something similar for nurse’s calling tbh)
---
He is super iconic and a cult classic so he was probably cheaper to get 
---
I mostly play on PS4 and when I use my good headphones I can hear them crackling.
---
It's definitely a thing, but they are very faint, especially at distance.
---
what kind of boy genius are you?
---
I just meant that this whole post is a joke about confirmation bias, but I see now that you're venting.
---
it's like in dragonball when someone gets launched and they leave a trail in the ground
---
There is only one group of players who will consistently be assholes, and that's assholes, they play whatever they want.
---
Yep, said on comms “lol he’s just staring at me” my friends just said run you idiot (Myers theme starts playing)
---
I believe this is on a PS4 so nope. 
---
Had this happen earlier... except it was Exposed. 🤦🏻‍♀️
---
I would say it’s like 60% Billy and 40% Spirit. 
---
i played killer when i was able to get a damn match and i only played Spirit and Pig for pleasure after update. both no ruin, no noed. rank 1. pc. 4k every time but i played Adiris for achievement. well, tried. best i could do was Ruthless cause Gatekeeper cucked me several times. 
---
i'm a good killer when i play Rin. with Pig was more luck. but Adiris with the base perks... man, i legit wanted to camp and tunnel. i didn't though cause pride reasons. but damn anyone less skilled than i am and i can fukin understand why they camp and tunnel and slug and all the nasty shit. 
---
i don't know what's up but after update the gens pop like crazy. without ruin games go fast af. i played survivor and even a good Nurse gets genrushed if she didn't have ruin. 
---
usually ruin never bothers as survivor me but skill checks are fucked. like, really. sometimes it's just ridiculous. i started gen tapping at some point. man, i have over 2k hours. and i play it for over a year. what's up with this shit? even before Clown chapter when survivors got cucked, i was a killer main. Freddy main, in fact. and even then it wasn't as frustrating to play the game as it is right now. i bet long time ago it was shit for killers but i felt fine before the bnp and vacuum/double pallet change. but now i hate the game. 
---
“Ranks don’t matter” aside, it’s just impossible for everyone to pip in red ranks. 
---
The killer literally has power to forcefully derank select survivors. Wearing a jakes fuckboi cosmetic? Depip. Lol
---
Is there any map larger than the max empathy? I don't think it's really a nerf, I think it's just clearer wording.
---
And its like you said a survivors just has to get teachables then max out 1 survivor. If you want to play different killers the grind starts all over again. It would be nice if either the web only gave level 1 perks then you had to either use BP to directly upgrade a perk or maybe do a challenge relating to it. Even the web web handing out wild cards would be good and you could use that to hand pick a perk or add-on
---
r/cursedimages
---
Chiming in with another 'this is ass for ps4' comment. Been thoroughly enjoying being able to consistently get into full lobbies in less than 2 minutes the last week. Sure, the wild rank differences made some suboptimal games, but I'll take that and actually bring able to play over the reverted system any damn day.
---
Been sitting with my wife readied up for almost an hour. Got into 2 lobbies, whereupon the killer fucking left the lobby as soon as we'd gotten in. 
---
I play on PS4 and that's where people do this
---
And given Lery's you can just duck into a doorway pretty easy or even just duck in a corner and than exit the room as soon as the killer passes, it's very possible
---
Honestly. I played a really good game earlier, got gens done saved people got some good chases nd I sacrificed my life to let another survivor escape thinking I pipped nd here comes the game again nd said “nope fuck you here’s a black pip”
---
(Gets hit by pallet)
---
I’d dc fuck that shit ain’t gonna waste my time 
---
All  generators are done. Why wouldn’t he facecamp. 
---
And against the Doc, too! Wow! Incredible!
---
I can honestly deal with all the bs if the killers just played by your standard. Even when I’m killer, if I go back to an unhook, I go after the fresh survivor, not the injured one. 
---
Only time I toxic play, is to punish toxic players. I’m not proud of it, but I feel it needs to be done. Lol
---
Who cares, it's a bloody game. Get a grip!
---
I play as killer as well,  so I expected this comment. LOL. I wasn't the first person he face camped,  I was the 2nd. Which is why he only had 1 kill,  and all gens were done. The last one got popped while he was camping me. 
---
Yes
---
Yepp
---
Yeppers
---
That ship makes no sense FYI and nobody here likes remake Freddy that's a fact. 
---
Yes, this is the sound https://clyp.it/pevov35n
---
Literally just got on reddit to ask about that
---
Yup
---
Yes. But this is my second camping Legion tonight, so I felt the need to rant. Trust me, I play killer and survivor so I see both sides. 
---
Exactly. I just ran a hag around The Game on my final hook so they can pop the last gen. Safety pip. Lol. 
---
I was also pissed because killer was hunting Claudette. Jane was sitting in a corner waiting for her to die instead of unlocking a door. 
---
It's down.
---
Good money.
---
Good point; I'm not sure. I googled it but it only gives me Tiles and Meters squared, and I haven't taken a math class in years, so.
---
Yes, for god sake... i was on a super good match, adept wraith almost done and bum... Down

I've never seen someone so salty at Benny Hills. 
---
Quentin, Claudette or Nea
---
Killer mostly Billy
---
Nurse creeps me the fuck out, floating around all stiff like a hanged body being puppeted
---
Most killers but right now I'm playing a lot of Huntress, Pig, and Spirit. Huntress is almost never out of my rotation because she is just so fun.
---
For survivor I leveled up Nea for Urban evasion and said fuck it because survivors are all the same mechanically so I just play her. I was going to play David but I swear the camera is more zoomed in when you play him after playing Nea so I just stick with her.
---
It’s so easy to counter the Leeg. Just spread out or throw a pallet on him. 
---
God, this guy sounded like he was just spouting nonsense. And look at this scorched earth shit- *every* one of his comments is deleted. Really makes me wonder what he could have been saying. 
---
You deserve more upvotes for this. Seriously the most fun thing I saw on this subreddit since I joined a few months back. Thanks for making my day! :D
---
YES
---
It's like with the huntress lullaby. You heard it one match? You'll here it in all the other matches and for the rest of the day as well... 
---
That's hardly the most distinguishable feature on killers. 
---
I'm a fuckin nerd so I read the in-game tutorials before playing my first match, still took me forever to understand how grabs work though, but that might just be because they're generally inconsistent
---
You say that like Freddy *isn't*. 
---
You mean something **WE** made today Conrad.
---
*Soviet Anthem plays*
---
No sense? I mean they have matching (probably the wrong word) cosmetics and they’ve received them for Valentine’s Day 
---
It'd be neat if his mechanic was that the obsession has his little cube, and if they interact with others/objectives, it has some adverse affect. Maybe the cube can be passed to others, even against their will, to get the heat off a target. 
---
I've also heard the idea that he can trap chests/lockers/vaults with barbed chains. Maybe he can *force* survivors to stay close to each-other by pinning them with hooks that are chained together. 
---
Oh yeah I see your point
---
He dc'd after getting chainsawed the second time :v
---
I meant the post itself having 6 "do"s, but yeah, in game you know after the first time
---
RNG kinda screwed this guy. There wasn't really much he could do there but hey, at least he accepted it. Hitting you and letting you escape was really the best way to go. 
---
Don’t encourage people to earn achievements by cheating. 
---
Kinda takes the whole point away from getting the achievements. 
---
Well T1 Mikey is something very different from all the other killers, that being no red stain and also a tiny terror radius (0 with M&amp;A). Could very easily throw off a new player
---
Is this what happens during the Killer’s loading screen ?

I just bought fire up for clown for that reason. I’m going to try to substitute fire up in for devour hope because I hate running hexes. We’ll see how that works because yeah clown does eat a lot of early pallet drops

It still won't let me in ;-;
---
When I play killer: Lit totem right next to gen.
---
When I play survivor: Lit totem somewhere in africa. 
---
&gt;facecamp
---
I mean, you were the last hooked survivor, where else was he supposed to go?
---
Perks should not be hard countered when they're that weak as is. 
---
Where did you get greatcoat?

You expect the devs to be competent? Hah what world are you living in?

It only took me 50 tries to learn my lesson SMH ahahaha
---
And here we see a salty toxic killer main in his natural habitat. 
---
Appreciate the honest response, and not an asshole comment either, it's all I've been getting. Even a developer gave a smartass response and said I should've backed up my game. Even though I'm console and the cloud is on there end.. :BigThink:
---
But thanks, I really appreciate that. Glad to know I'm not the only one, lmfao. 
---
I'd rather play and lose, against better players, than wait in a lobby 15 minutes. At least you get better, and actually play the game.
---
&gt;always swf
---
&gt;have always been boosted
---
Yikes what crawled up your ass and died? 
---
While this is true, ranks do also mean how skillful a player is. Like right before the revert change to matchmaking. I'm a Rank 1 Survivor getting pooled with Rank 15's and 10's (half way through Rank Reset so you know they aren't that good at the game) who were running around like headless chicken 5 mins into a match with 0 Gens done looking for Ruin against a Rank 4 Killer because of the broken matchmaking instead of just taking the time to do the Gens. I can only hold off a Killer so long before I finally get caught or if the Killer leaves me alone, the lesser skilled Survivor immediately gets downed 30 secs into a chase. It doesn't make a fun experience for the solo, high ranked Survivor and I'm sure they don't enjoy going against highly skilled Killers. 
---
Same 
---
Why on earth didn't you mend yourself? It's not like Nurse's is affected by it. 
---
First match against myers:
---
*Rescued friend in the basement and starts healing her*
---
*Myers comes to the bottom of the stairs and is watching us"
---
My friend and I: "wtf why is he just staring at us" "idk"
---
*Halloween music*
---
You probably know what happens next
---
Never heard of it, took a look, don't regret a thing. 
---
thank you
---
What is the, uh, the punishment, anyway?
---
Same. Except my wife doesnt play this game. I play with another friend. It takes almost an hour to find a match because the killer in every game decides to facecamp or tunnel only her so to make things worse I'm pipping up while she depips. She's now almost back at rank 15 because of the harsh emblem system. The thing with that is she's not a bad player either. She's actually pretty decent. We just have to wait an hour to find a shitty match that she gets facecamped in just for doing a gen. Not even borrowed time helps against these shit stain killers and it's far to difficult to pip up as a survivor to get away from these cocksuckers. I bearly pip by the skin of my teeth as a survivor. 
---
At least with the "new" match making we got into a game faster where the same shit would happen but we didn't have to wait all day for a match to start up either. It's more fun than sitting in the fuckin lobby.
---
Everyone should be shirtless. Especially my boy Bubber
---
THIS IS ALL THAT I WANT FROM THIS GAME
---
Points lost towards the chase emblem. 
---
And usually the match if you’re against good survivors but 
---
shes so sad &lt;3
---
i like how one of them is calling you a noob but they escaped with 8k points meaning they did 3k points worth of shit that ENTIRE GAME
---
why would i hate a jigsaw piece?
---
when i rarely play survivor this seems to be my team's response to myers too
---
Would be nice!
---
To be honest they didnt have much time to get altruism and boldness points
---
The win isn't easy, but it's worth it for me. Only if there's no voicechat I will do it. I like the not knowing part. That's why swf would bore me :/
---
And I say no, I'm doing just fine on my own.
---
Same. I really love Quentin for some reason, but the lack of cosmetics breaks my heart so I am moving on. ;(
---
They reverted the matchmaking  today and I think the hamsters are dying because I just had a match where my character was 509% in size and it was literally unplayable I had to disconnect same time as your post 
---
i hope it gets cancelled after a cliffhanger
---
What? Proof of what? It was in the patch notes and talked about with the devs that killers are punished in the Emblem System if they face camp for a long period of time.  
---
Also, he's talking about his bloodpoints. He got bloodpoints for face camping.
---
Now that was hilarious
---
Probably a bug unless you ran a obsession perk
---
....they still need to fix this?
---
I stand corrected :)
---
Dwight:  “Make me, you old fart!”
---
Michael:  (takes one step away from window)
---
Dwight:  “Cheese it!”  (Hides in a bush and tries to stifle terrified crying)
---
Yeah we were getting into game after game the other night and I said wow this is awesome we actually get to play more than 3 games per night. Last night we came on at 9:30 and didn’t get a game until 11. Tried to get another game after that but we all gave up and went to bed. Still have no clue why they went back to the old system, makes no sense!
---
Guess I'm leveling doctor next. Ooh boy, I'm excited. 
---
Yeah for sure this new system is hitting hard, but those killers are probably the standard now, just cause you didnt use d-strike didnt mean it didnt help your teammates ultimately helping you survive. That one dude with d strike dead hard did loop the killer for 3 gens instead of 1
---
I really wonder sometimes about whether people realize what their choice of perks mean. I was playing with one friend and this *Spirit* was facecamping someone on a hook (of all the killers to facecamp...). I think most of us ended up escaping but we looked afterwards and saw Make Your Choice and we were confused. 
---
We were like, I don’t remember that activating, but then we realized it was because she was close to the hook the entire time. 
---
Thicc 
---
The only reason I can think of is that I’ve seen a lot of SWF players complaining about longer wait times on the new matchmaking system for them, and some killers were mad about non-instant lobby making. But I feel like most of us were wayyy happier with the new system.
---
Killer: Nea, Doctor, Hag &amp; sometimes Mocha
---
Survivor: finger guns &amp; pizza boi
---
Stop camping x2
---
oh, true. you're right. d-strike in game mostly meant some totem time for me. now i dropped cleansing cause have to be a gen jockey or kite the killer but if there is a ruin, and it's mostly there, i don't even fukin know cause low rank people can't hit hex skill checks so no matter how long i can handle the killer(i'm not good at it if they commit and bloodlust and that's what lower rank killers do for some reason) unless the ruin was destroyed i'll just die on hook cause no one really saves.
---
They have never had to save much before, cause games never lasted that long, this is basically a brand new game
---
Honestly I'm not convinced the dev's even made this game. It's such a cool idea, theres no way any of these people currently working on it have the talent or creativity to even come up with it. The games existed in almost the exact same state since release, with basic shit like dedicated servers and a rank system that works still not happening. 
---
eat Shit.
---
So it cannot be bought by Iridescent Shards, just Auric Cells?
---
It ain't camping if there isn't anymore survivours
---
I see so much hate for this map, and see so many d/cs for it, but I love it. Maybe it’s seeing all the Saw references, but I really enjoy playing on it. I get why people don’t like it, but it’s definitely not the worst in the game like some people make it out to be (that will go to either Ormond or Yamaoka for me).
---
Do y’all ever get tired of making these posts? Just camp and go. You’re obviously not gonna stop so why justify yourself?
---
I’ll have to try it! Shame I’m using two perks slots on something that Enduring could eat.
---
i got a lobby after over 30 minutes of waiting. two people that already joined and left it previously were in it.
---
and gotta say waiting for 30 minutes to play base perks Adiris on Ormond map... well, thank goodness my periods are over or i'd cry tbh. really so frustrating.

I have done nothing but let Myers stare at me for three days.
---
tedious isn't even the main problem. if there's a lagspike, you just die as if you stopped hitting the button. a win/loss condition shouldn't be because someone's brother just started downloading porn
---
What I read from the comments is that the queue times are to long for Survivors mainly?   
---
this seems to be a problem of two main reasons:
---
1. PS4 seems to have a lower player base than PC, thus the queue time is longer
---
2. Since the game needs 4 survivors per 1 Killer, the balance is way off. Sometimes a new Killer/Event shifts the ratio of killer/player in one direction, resulting in long queue times for one side. The old system paired similar ranked players together, thus adding further waiting time.
---
An idea to balance the second point would be to add some extra reward for playing eigther side, based on the current queue situation. 
---
To few killers in queue for all the survivors to find a game? Give the players information in the main menu, and reward playing a killer in this situation with some 10-50% bonus bloodpoints (or something similar).
---
Same goes the other way around.  
---
Both are pretty decent killers, especially wraith after the rework.
---
Strange to see him as a survivor though. He's kicked too much ass in the movies, comics, and show to become a defenseless survivor
---
Mounting a 3-man rescue and pulling the bait off the hook with Borrowed Time and then all of you escaping feels absolutely amazing, though.
---
And then complain that killers are OP
---
I once broke Hunted Grounds while Spirit was talking the surv to the hook thinking it would be most appropriate time for this.
---
She downed two more AND THEN hooked the guy she was carrying. 
---
Neither is the terrible matchmaker we have
---
I stopped using UE because of you. Can’t believe I earlier wrote I would never go without it. It wasn’t that necessary after all. Thanks. 
---
Stop camping x3
---
Too many people play killer, im sorry
---
Stop camping x4
---
Not camping, just started playing recently
---
Ok thanks
---
For a new player the rank means almost everything. For someone who has 700hrs, It doesn't.
---
How would you feel as a new player getting in a match with people with  -8 rank?
---
Yesterday I played a match with some friends where I was who had the lowest rank (13).
---
The killer was in rank 20. We checked his steam profile, he had 6 hrs played. 
---
I'm talking about the hatch
---
DS needed to change. It was an awful perk that really sucked the fun out of the game for the other side. In a weird way though the game was balanced around DS and NOED. Both perks could change the game so much that either one being removed would have a huge impact.
---
I feel like we're at the point though where all killers are doing good and so the NOED crutch should be removed. Of course the devs won't though because they listen to the babies on their forum that still cry for more ridiciulous buffs.
---
Ok good info, thanks
---
Yep, same thing just happened to me as well. Did you get the $20 one like OP? That’s what I got. 
---
&gt; If your goal is just to casually play killer sometimes, then yeah, screw them with stabby boi.
---
Man, that's how I feel with Nurse. She was the first killer I picked up and I have played her the longest, so she's almost relaxing to play at this point. I get a thirst for blood and I just start killing. I recently picked up Spirit and she takes *so* much more effort to do anything. I'm probably playing her wrong because I don't have any of the basic killer chase strategies in my brain. With Nurse I choose a target and kill them through sheer power of will, but with Spirit I feel so powerless in chases.
---
I don't mean this to say that Spirit is weak, since many killers have beaten my ass. I just suck :(
---
Noob killer
---
Shirtless Kate
---
Was winning a match as Meyers and got dc’d super fun stuff..
---
Basically "I lose if I try other killers so I need the ones that are unbalanced to win or require no chase skill".
---
Not going to deny that the very bottom tier killers get BM'd but mid tier is fine. I never play billy because hes boring, and rarely touch nurse cus she's so OP. Dont touch legion because he sucks ass. Yet im dtill doing just fine with other killers. Clown, huntress, spirit, wraith, freddy, hag, trapper, doctor etc
---
How much money would it take to have this a dlc

Thanks man! I'm only learning.

It's been Ruin every time since before the patch, though. That one Shrine in February absolutely wrecked perk diversity.

---
Not necessarily. They reverted matchmaking and made ranking up harder so we see fewer skilled survivors in red ranks plus many skilled survivors prefer to play against semi-decent killers because they're less sweaty. 
---
Also, before they reverted the change we saw plenty of skilled killers at higher ranks having a go at low skill survivors and it also frustrates higher skill survivors because they cannot reliably rank up with even if they want to unless in SWF because other survivors are hiding around corners until seen and then fall like quicker than AFK players. 
---
Thanks. I realize that I move around too much to even use it. I like to be active.
---
When killers need to 4k just for gold and gatekeeper requirements just went up you'll see a lot of sweaty killers who make the game unfun. Idk how behavior didn't see this coming. A fun game is where I can enjoy my match without worrying about having to hit some kind of quota. An unenjoyable game is loading in with the intention of hitting a 4k every single time
---
I hope we get a response to this it’s only gonna get worse as the game adds more killers and survivors then who will be around to play this game when the grind gets ungodly punishing. Please boost how many blood points everyone gets already 
---
See, this is why Legion is one of my favorite killers.  Because I see them as this, they're just dumbass teens that would definitely do something like this.  When they're not in the trials they're just fucking around doing dumb shit with the other killers, or maybe even some of the survivors
---
im guessing you know how new DS works? and about obsession, it seems to ALWAYS be given to someone that DOESN’T have DS, so i believe it’s bugged
---
You make it sound like NQ is some sort of Grinch who stole your matches lmao
---
I always hated ds. On both sides. Never liked using it. 
---
I understand why noed wont be taken out. You can honestly work through all the other next totems. Might as well take totems out and just make their debufs permanent.   
---
Face camping &amp; tunneling = looping and teabagging? Lmao, okay. 
---
Yeah i'm a pig main who uses a nurses calling. Love it. 
---
Tbh you’ll never know, but it’s not worth it against enduring. I played against a Michael with enduring today and he ate my DS and had me down in less than 5 seconds 
---
Ohhh nice! Spirit will definitely be some sort of uphill challenge to learn, but Nurses, BBQ &amp; Chili, Make Your Choice, and Discordance are some good perks to play around with :)
---
How is enduring a counter now but wasn’t before?? I hope they change it back. Good killers knew how to dribble, distract with hits or circling or catch back up to survivors after getting stunned. It was incredibly counterable before and now it’s completely useless. The funny part is you same killers who used it as an excuse for why you couldn’t get kills still don’t get kills. 🤔
---
DH lol.
---
Clown is really bad at protecting hexes due to his low overall map pressure. It's part of the reason I honestly think that Corrupt Intervention would be a better choice on him than Ruin.
---
But with the new ranking system its not worth doing the totems. You lose out for it. If they just let dull totems count towards lightbringer like lit totems do it would be fine. Now if you choose to be the totem hunter you lose out for it. Its sucks. Plus having dull totems give emblem points would encourage more totem hunting which would be good for killers anyway as its more time off gens...except thos le who rely on noed.
---
Yeah the legion patch was when alk the nasty bugs came out. Infinite load screen every third game. Audio has never been the ssme since either.
---
One random person that does not have ds will be the obsession. Only after successfully using ds will the obsession be transferred over to the person that has decisive strike.
---
Gotta say, I really like your (safe) hook rescue suggestion. If someone hookfarms you, they should absolutely lose out on at least 50% of the BP gain.
---
billy is one of the few (probs only, barring a really good hag on console) killers who can reasonably stand up vs a decent SWF group, whilst also being simple to use (unlike hag or nurse), hence why he's so damn over used.
---
other low skill cap killers, like wraith/doc are stomped to oblivion, and higher skill caps like spirit/huntress don't get nearly as good results unless you are insanely good at them.
---
you would see more different killers in high ranks if more killers were actually viable.
---
Lol yup. I blocked him so I can't even look at the carnage while being logged in to reply lol.
---
Basically he was flaming the OP for "bragging" when they "weren't even that good." Basically a bunch of "I'm rank 1 and you're trash at the game stop enjoying the game you'll never be as good as me" garbage. When I told him that people are allowed to post gameplay for reasons other than swinging their dick around he kept spouting "I'm rank 1 this dude is garbage" bullshit.
---
Gave me a Meriam Webster definition of bragging. I gave him a Meriam Webster definition of comedy lol.
---
The first few days playing as the spirit were just filled with endless rage quitting, but i'm a little better now. Still have to practice a ton tho
---
I just pick my skin at random whenever I play any character. I have a bunch of cosmetics on all the characters I enjoy and some D&amp;D dice bots on my Discord server. I roll a few dice to pick out the cosmetics before playing.
---
Oof. Console experience.
---
I want totems to have a value outside of 600 points if there's no hex, like opening a hatch/drop to basement 
---
Wraith is too cute.
---
Also, yeah, survivors jumping through blocked windows is whack.
---
Thats the fault of all the whiny killer mains who cried it was too easy for survivors to pip, despite the fact that it was always easier for killers.
---
Now survivors are taking forever to get to red ranks. Guess they got what they wanted.
---
100% agree. Also happy cake day!
---
You know both sides are harder to pip now right? This isn’t a side vs side thing, but hey if you need a scapegoat that’s all you 
---
It's nice to see a fellow Jake main. Also, happy cake day.
---
28 people are fat
---
Will admit fully that I am a massive Wikigamer when it comes to basically any game. I'm the kind of nerd to do heavy research whenever I start a game.
---
I'll keep making these posts until people like you realise that the killer is there to kill you and just because you misplayed it isn't the fault of the killer using cheese tactics.  
---
Why would I camp? I get less points, i have no reason to.
---
It's repeatedly crouching and uncrouching. It dates back to early arena shooters as a method of taunting an opponent.
---
That sentence has always been there, it means being you can't see them while they're being carried. 
---
It did help massively. I never used it hut there would always be someone that did.
---
The game was balanced around it being there though. Now that its gone it feels like survivors are losing 99% of games. This is in addition to every killer having Ruin now. So survivors have less time than before, killers have more time. What we're ending up with is a bloodbath. It would be no different if NOED got nerfed.
---
they've really unbalanced the game.
---
Hopefully Freddy will get a rework this year. Hopefully it'll make him viable.  
---
Hopefully Wraith and Doctor will both be made viable at some point.  
---
Hopefully Legion will get a rework to be both stronger - because let's face it, without the right add-ons, they're a joke - and more fun.  
---
Lots of hope. Or at the very least wishful thinking.
---
This. Same with perks too
---
7/8 games have ruin, buff some other perks so we can get some variety.
---
Framerate &gt; resolution. Moronic console player lmao 
---
No ragrets
---
New SWF buff duuuh
---
Isn't that a different Jane? One was brown clothes other with black?
---
Glad I’m not the only one struggling. This is huntress and pig level difficult to do.  Starting to think I need to just wait for rank reset when I feel lucky to get even two kills. Gimping myself with these perks has been rank suicide. 
---
But how are you forced to run it? You were talking about countering a pretty specific tactic that would occur only in a rare matches, right now you don't even use DS in half of the matches. I just proposed you to run a DS + Unbreakable combo that was pretty common even before the DS nerf that would work pretty good for your purposes.
---
Infinite DS on downed survivors would be pretty OP when there are 3 or less survivors left and they are just farming each other off the hooks. I usually just slug unhooked guys and go for the unhooker but if he wouldn't be healed by somebody it means I'm guaranteed to get DS in my ass though I wasn't even tunneled.
---
I literally just had you in my survivor lobby and called you a dribbler. Small world.
---
Hey, that's pretty good 
---
Yeah Nurse is easy when you know her good and aren't facing a real good team
---
For Spirit some good headphones are a must basically
---
I did wonder where they had gone.  I miss them :(
---
I find the biggest difference for me personally is on console I can't turn mid blink. (I play at 75% sensitivity,  any higher and I can't aim right, any lower and I have a hard time catching 360s) but it feels like the sensitivity drops massively when you try to turn mid blink on console and I'll almost never end up facing where I want when I reach the end of the blink. 
---
Btw I don't do it at all. I know it's a good practice, I'm just not used to turning in mid-blink
---
go put your helmet on and shut the fuck up, your right to free speech should be legally revoked for that stupid fucking comment. "PGA golfers =/= best golfers?" LMAO ROFL LOL" kys
---
New ranking is way to harsh
---
Same. Shame that optimal play isn't actually fun and brings out a lot of negatives of the game.
---
You can still use them in KYF
---
Thank you Behavior for fucking me and everyone on Ps4 over :) 
---
Sorry but I'm just so mad that I have to wait 40 mins for one match again. Good thing killers weren't affected tho, hopping back on killer. If they remake it again I hope it turns out like this one but Pc isn't fucked.
---
I'm fairly certain they're all the same.
---
They *can* do well, yes, but not often, and not reliably.  
---
The fact that they rely on add-ons is all the proof you need for them being non-viable.  
---
The devs took a big step forward when buffing Wraith's power and reworking his add-ons, but they also took a big step back by giving his power a nerf in the very same patch, which essentially made the buff moot.
---
I wish people would stop adding "flashlights" to what they assume is toxic. Flashlights are ass and if you're scared of them as a killer, you're ass too. They haven't been good for a long time. 
---
You should be moaning about insta-heals. 
---
No you can't. You can view them, and look at what they do. However I am unable to use them. https://gyazo.com/50ef7b279ebb746334127ca20ec909f6
---
Yeah its rough when you have a Billy Nurse teleporting with a chainsaw.
---
no one called me a dribbler though 
---
That nodding at the end was perfect 
---
Yup, nobody cares about survivors 
---
Yeah okay say that in the middle of rotten fields or out in the open on crotus prenn or even in the middle of shelter woods. 
---
Well yeah... because I thought the fact that he quit after one window juke was funny but since everyone in the comments is so butthurt about the post I guess your right.
---
Because Pc got what we were having with the new one and seeing as Pc is the main population of the community Ps4 gets sacrificed for it. Ready to wait 40 mins for one match? :D
---
So what if he’s new and I doubt the mod will remove it because I did nothing wrong in the post. I only posted because I thought it was funny he quit after one window juke
---
'If you don't want to be slugged and lose your DS you have to bring unbreakable' 
---
Fuuuckkk :(. I’m glad I got in all the games I could get with that fast matchmaking... it was so refreshing not sitting there for ages waiting for a lobby. I now have the new devil may cry so bye bye to dbd for now :/
---
have a nice day
---
I'm not saying that flashlights are "toxic" i'm saying that flashlights are annoying af
---
What excuse? 
---
Please make this happen. IMMEDIATELY.
---
"come to daddy..." 
---
I'm so sad. I was finally having fun then the plug got pulled. At least Pc won't suffer what we had to suffer for god knows how long.
---
Where... Did you even consider this info was legit? All survivors have exactly the same hitbox, run speed, turn speed, etc. Survivors are purely cosmetic and the only legitimate difference between them is how much space they take up on your screen (David being far larger on screen then say Kate.) And how loud they are when running/injured (Ace nearly having Iron Will built-in and Jeff breaking the sound barrier when hit.)
---
What's annoying about them? Getting free hits when you bait survivors by pretending to go for the pickup? Getting free hits when survivors wait to blind you at a pallet? If you know how to play killer with an competence, you should welcome flashlights.
---
Annoying and toxic are interchangeable on this subreddit, btw.
---
As someone else has said, basically a random player will become  the obsession until the player with the DS used the perk.  It is so fucked up.  I never ever use DS.  I'd hate to be the victim of Rancor when I didn't even bring it in the first place.
---
I'm starting to really like Kindred because I'm a solo player. It allows the whole survivor team to coordinate their movement &amp; stop swarming the hook which wastes time &amp; can get the killer more momentum. Also shows if the killer is camping or the direction they are heading.
---
Nowadays I use Self-care, Adrenaline, Dead Hard &amp; kindred. Tempted to swap out self-care for iron will for the stealth factor.
---
No offense, but that thing is super low quality.

r/instantkarma
---
To be honest they need to revert the matchmaking or open up the matchmaking to find survivors from a wide variety of ranks. This just makes the depiping issue to get a lobby a really serious issue now for killers.
---
He's not good. He's just uncounterable and unfun to play against. Chases against him are miserable because you aren't going to get away.
---
as in i didn't see it. also why would anyone call me that? D: i mean i did dribble old ds rarely when i didn't have Enduring on but man not that it was that often.
---
You just added more hurt to your butt. Dumbass. 
---
Right? The basement’s supposed to be the killer’s domain it’s supposed to be the most dangerous part of the map. Plan and act accordingly. Leatherface is the hard counter to Leeroy Jenkins players
---
... But it's not intended to counter slugging, that's the whole point.
---
Unbreakable is, that's why I suggested it. 
---
And I also suggested a pretty neat combo.
---
&gt;Dude, you're a genius! 
---
Well thank you! :)
---
Pretty shocking that with it being much harder to Rank up fewer players are available to play matches with.  If only people could have seen this coming....

---
When you realise it’s a nurse for the 11th game in a row
---
They should not add more perks than four perks to the Shrine per week.  
---
What they should do, however, is not randomise it completely, and instead manually pick which perks will show up each week, so that we won't end up with Wake Up! yet again.
---
yupppppp plzzz
---
The devs show stats in the dev streams, feel free to check them out.  Even Freddy the weakest Killer has a near 50% Kill Rate
---
I'd like us to grab and mori people at the exit gate when they're just standing there, increased movement speed past those gates so we don't have to look at survivors crouch waiting
---
I rather take the wait time than an unbalanced match.
---
Thanks
---
I'm on PC. The new matchmaking was so bad for me that one day I sat down and timed it.
---
Ohio. Friday. 10:30 pm EST. 3h15m session as survivor. 45 lobbies. 36 of them were red ping (200+) or just failed entirely. 9 resulted in actual games. I spent 46% of the session looking for lobbies and 54% in game. The longest streak of lobbies I had to dodge to find decent ping was 12. A dozen goddamn times I had to wait for it to find a lobby, see that the matchmaking was trying to put me with a killer on another fucking continent or something, and leave the lobby to queue back up. I got a lobby with ~300 ping and there was someone there with a fucking Russian/cyrillic/whatever name there. Was that for real? I have no idea. I'm in fucking Ohio! Why is this happening to me!
---
That is the worst DBD has **ever** been for me. I have played at the weirdest hours and never seen anything like that - not in terms of ping, not in terms of wait time, especially not as survivor. I dodge for ping maybe once or twice a session, otherwise it's always green, and the lobby always fills up in a couple minutes. It was an absolute disaster and I was ready to uninstall the game and forget I owned it. RIP DBD, it was fun while it lasted.
---
I'm sorry it sucks for you, though, really. I have no idea why PC and PS4 would be so different. If there's a matchmaking solution that works for PC but not PS4, and another that works for PS4 but not PC, then that means it's not some unsolvable structural issue with the playerbase (not enough players in certain regions, vastly too many players trying to play one side or the other, etc, etc). So that's at least kind of promising, right? It's technically fixable!
---
That’s what you get for playing legion /s 
---
Again, you should show the source, as you are the one claiming there is data that proves me otherwise. Telling me to go find them myself doesn't cut it.
---
I usually bully playstyles more than survivors. But if you see me play, you'll notice a 'Dwights Killed' counter on the screen. That says enough ;)
---

Well, it is ment to look like a drawed one and looks a bit better in real life. Also will add some stuff to it later so, I'm still fine with it

I just had my funniest Myers game last night, but it was against a SFW group with a pretty good Jake looper.
---
I had managed to down him twice, but then I guess he turned it up to 11 and I just could not catch him. Flash light and tea bags abound, far as the entity could see.
---
Finally metadrenaline kicks in and his ass is gone. Kinda pissed, I decide to just stand near the exit gate to appear afk. Claudette comes and starts looping me for chase points, and I just wait. Finally here comes Jakiepoo, and I have 99% T2.

Eviled up and caught his ass well short of the very close exit gate. He was the only kill I got that match, but could not stop laughing.
---
Group had a good laugh in the lobby afterwards. Myers is best Myers.
---
Holy fuck 
---
It's sad to see these people exist 
---
That's usually everyones insult haha you faggots can't think of anything else?
---
Mm.. masaka!?!
---
But did you calm down?
---
Absolutely, you totally see everyone running the sick new meta DS and using it to... bodyblock while injured and just having come off a hook? Cleanse Ruin while protected by a 60 second immortality field? Christ.
---
Just when I started to have fun 
---
I get that. But I said for no reason. 
---
So most of the community loves Spirit, but how many people can play her well?
---
My best friend (a Pinhead fangirl) actually thought this was legit when they found it.
---
Not sure if they were beginners or just haven‘t seen me but I stalked up to t3 by watching 3 survivors teabagging, swapping items and joking around right at the beginning of a match. 
---
Wrong sub, my guy. This is DBD not DND. 
---
Pizza Dwight is always relevant :D
---
To be fair they did buff Wraith
---
And to be even more fair they're continually nerfing the most problematic killer in the game : Freddy
---
I got stuck at 5 :D
---
Im not sure if hes on Reddit but his "stage name" is Shontelle Sparkles....Just wanted to give him some credit for the hard work and I am sure all us DBD fans would appreciate it too. 
---
But why is it there then? .-.
---
Yes, I want them to look me in the eye as life leaves them.
---
Yea she's back to normal.
---
Lol shit 
---
I’ve played about 11 hours the past few days. Maybe three hours a day. Went from rank 10 to bouncing between a high 8 and low 9. Over the course of 11 hours. I can’t get out of rank 8. 24000 points and I’m black pipping 🤷‍♂️
---
I'm guessing it gets a lot more complicated from a Dev's standpoint. Imagine pushing an update to different versions of the same game, causing different bugs and glitches for each version, potentially doubling the amount of work you have to do (fixing the bugs for each platform). Add Xbox and Switch and it becomes impossible to manage.
---
It’s all good, easy mistake to make. Have a great day!
---
They will get infected by Adiris or measles (whatever comes first or maybe both) and will die within a week or so.
---
I see your point. I'm just so sad I have to go through the same shit again when it was perfect last time. At least Pc doesn't suffer anymore (when it comes to queues).
---
Don’t just look at it... eat it
---
As a killer on pc I have the opposite problem. The new system took waaaaay to long, now its back to being instant
---
Gotta flex your E-peen or wtf arr.you.even doing on Billy.
---
Leatherfaces left theirs in the cooler so they don't count.
---
^ All survivors have the exact same hitbox size, females have male hitbox size, feng has jeff hitbox size, etc.
---
It’s a problem with lag compensation for killers. Dedicated servers will fix the BS hits too.
---
Pharmacy makes searching chests faster but it will always give you a green Medkit in the first chest. 
---
I still get the glass cracking sound, but the stun is fixed now. 
---
Crazy right
---
Says the freddy main XD
---
my point is that if they make new matchmaking, people complain. if they remove the new matchmaking, other people complain. bhvr just don’t get a break when it comes to the community shittalking them and i actually feel bad for them.
---
Easy buff/rework like 70% av all killers ether their whole kit or their addons. Why because some killers like doctor is realy meh agains swf groups if not with the right addons and also rework some perks so we can get some variation for an example how many games does a killer us bbq and ruin? And Another example of a bad/meh bp perk is destressing it gives you 100% more bp in deviusness but the uppgrades for it is only cons. T1 is an increase of your terror with 22% with 100% bp while t3 is 26% terror with 100% bp? Like why would i uppgrade this perk? https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Distressing
---
Fucking meg head 
---
I've told my uncle (Gary J Tunnicliffe) who has worked on the old Hellraiser movies and who directed the newest one (Judgement) about Dead by Daylight and I've told him how cool it would be to have this in the game.
---
I've asked him who owns the rights to the character so If I hear any news I will for sure share it with you.
---
My frame rate was fine as is before the update. 
---
I remember running into a Myers that was running an addon to let him kill survivors at Evil Within III, problem is he was also running an addon that kept him in Evil Within I permanently 
---
In my first match me and my friend were just getting into the game and I yell for him to watch out as he gets yoinked off the gen
---
You should learn how to use capital letters. Especially for the letter i... 
---
"Hey there kid, got any medkits?"
---
Its pretty funny
---
Dude that's Hag
---
"play like a man" You mean walk away from a hook thats 5 feet away from an exit gate, and let you save them? Yeah man, my bad, what a wimp I am.
---
I'm using everybody because I'd be bored of maining any killer
---
Always thought the reasoning was because they didn't want to make multiple light settings for each new map? Plus less content less shit to break with each *patch* lol
---
I love it when people dont heal against Plague when I have Black Incense.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Black_Incense 
---
Id say this is a "but" about it.
---
This is true, if you just facecamp someone at the start of the game, that sucks and is a boring and unfun way to play the game. That being said "Reason" is subjective, and thats where arguements come in. 
---
Fixing the game means more players will stay which means more money guaranteed.
---
Not fixing bugs means they don't care about their players which is economically very dumb!
---
Maybe they should decrease the amount of time you have to sit in the locker as you level up the perk
---
Nerf matchmaking so it takes 2 hours to find a game as as swf *Megamind*
---
Honestly as a survivor main I think killers should normally get at least 3 kills. Idk I feel like the whole point of the game is to be powerless against this ruthless killer but survivors, especially swf, are absolute assholes and can wreck the killers shit with just a lil effort. Some of these nerfs were necessary, but a few of them definitely could use some fine tuning *cough cough ds changes cough*
---
That literally has everything to do with red ranks stupid. In red ranks you saw it on 2-3 survivors because it wasted the killers time, that helps all 4 survivors regardless if they run it. Now with out it noone knows how to play well enough that since they increased the requirements for piping it seems extremely hard. In reality you just have to play smarter. They have removed an easy answer to screwing up. Most red rank killers are facing purple and green ranks cause there is literally noone. Who do you main so I can focus kill you.

---
The problem is if you get destroyed as a killer, you don't deserve a single kill. Players shouldn't be getting punished for trying to save their survivor friends, because that's part of the game. Entitled killers are a toxic part of this community.
---
That’s true,  but I can usually tell at the start of a game how it’s going to be lol
---
If I hook someone and barely walk away and the person is already off the hook while I see no bbq, I know they are an altruistic bunch.
---
And it’s always true because I’ll try it again and it happens again, then I will start to walk away and then turn back to see them jumping the gun. And then they all sprint around like madlads once they’ve been figured out lol 
---
Technically we already have that with BBQ &amp; Chili.
---
Half-way fixed. The loud cracking noises persist still.
---
I can agree with this. Face camping is gross and boring.
---
You summed it up pretty well, I feel like in her case its a matter of time management. If you need to take the time to get to a fountain it gives survivors time to hide, heal, do gens, save friends etc. Time management is the name of the game in DBD
---
at least 3 kills???
---
It is considered a win for the killer to get a 2 kills, If a killer can easily get 3-4 kills every game then there is must be something wrong!
---
SWF is the only thing that survivors have at the moment and not all survivors play SWF...
---
Apparently, buying a yellow Adam head has no difference from the other heads, except for shortened hair. 
---
Is that way stabbing people a bunch? Then keep stabbing them?
---
He definitely has a lot more mileage on stabs than any other killer.
---
Lmao my inner commentary sounds exactly like this, I was just saying that the killer shouldn’t be a joke and sometimes that’s definitely the case. Idk I wanna be actually scared of the killers and it rarely turns out that way. They did a great job with spirit and her jump scares and I never fail to scream when a random Michael appears and wrecks my shit but some of these killers you bring a flashlight and lol in their face. 
---
LOL only 2 that have a chance. Killers try to push this myth that:
---
1)Big SWF teams are common
---
2)SWF are all these ridiculously good, well coordinated teams.  Most SWF teams are terrible and find it funny to sandbag each other.
---
In reality Killers continue to dominate at all ranks
---
Little PPs, Big PPs, it's all good. All PPs are fun. 😊
---
This information has not been confirmed by Nintendo, and the mock-up is fan-made. It was never pinned to the subreddit.
---
That's amazing 
---
PLS MAKE REAL NOW PLZ
---
He camped the first two pretty hard
---
Hag is so underused because she is boring to play as for most people. Only main hags like to play her
---
Old claudette looked so good, they changed the shmock cosmetic on her, her stance and her facial looks, it looks so bad now.. in 2016 she was les visible aswell
---
I mean just imagine their voice com lobby after the game, it's gotta be pure fucking gold, '' fucking unbalanced game always favoring the killer, We just lost our purple toolboxes and flashlights ''.
---
"Camping is a problem and I'm angry."
---
"Here's the awnser to your problem." (New Decisive Strike)
---
"No I don't want that. I want to be angry."
---
New Decisive is very strong since the Killer doesn't see it coming and also can't dribble you to counter it. Maybe actually try using it instead of going "IT'S NERFED SO IT'S WORTHLESS!"
---
All Killers are viable.  All Killers are basically at 50% Kill rate or above.
---
Saying all Killers should be as good as Nurse and Hillbilly is equivalent to saying all Perks should be as good as Old Decisive and NOED
---
Players shouldn't be "punished" for trying to save teammates? Do you want the killer to just let you escape for free? If you make a bad play trying to be overly altruistic then that's your fault, nothing to do with "bad mechanics".
---
But also nerf nurse
---
It's also part of the game to accept your loses instead of going on suicide missions.
---
I'd love to see a Pinhead, or at the very least, a Cenobite which can be customised similar to Legion. If only 'cause Chatterer is bae. Leprechaun would be great, too.
---
Ripley is a pretty good shout for a Survivor, especially if we could get a perk which boosted, say, flashlight/pallet saves. Just so the quote can can be "Let go of her, you bitch!"
---
A Sadako skin for Spirit would be nice. Spirit already has the Japanese horror shtick down, all she needs is the clothes and she's sorted.
---
I've already mentioned Leprechaun, so doubling that up with Chucky seems a bit lazy for just -another- short Killer. But Andy would make a great Survivor, especially with his paranoid, survivalist version from Cult of Chucky.
---
So with the new ranking system it's almost impossible to get a double pip, which is the requirement for getting Adept achievements on killers (Merciless victory). 
---
Which is extra sad, because in this match I was playing against pretty potato-ish survivors, only a few gens got done, I got a 4k, but apparently I should've not used my chainsaw because I didn't get enough chase points.
---
To get a Merciless, you have to abuse the scoring system, which is not fun for anyone involved, and creates artificial difficulty. Again, I absolutely dominated this match, but apparently that wasn't good enough.
---
In conclusion to this badly structured rant, I really wish BHVR takes another look at the ranking system, because this is kinda stupid.
---
You guys desperately need a Tiffany Cox, for real. 
---
Underrated comment
---
I’m that Freddy 😂😂 
---
So killers, who already get a shit load more BP, get a 50% to 100% increase across the board and survivors, who struggle with point gen, get around a 25% boost and, in a couple cases, fewer points?
---
Sure, sounds like a great plan. 
---
Yes it saves time but doenst give you a pip, even when someone with ds loops the killer for 5 gens, the teammates arent going to pip, because they didnt to anything than gens and escaping. I know that ds helps you living longer, but the guy said, that it is only because of the ds change, that there are no more red ranks left, and thats bullshit
---
The thing that sucks most about this? It's definitely an effect of BHVR listening far too much to the streamers who probably were the loudest and most vocal. They're all PC based so thus it needs to be fixed immediately, otherwise the Fog Whisperers and what not can't promote the game.
---
If the PS4/XBox wait times had gotten worse? Lol. We'd still have new matchmaking. 
---
This is a pretty good example of BHVR putting too much power behind the PC community/Streamer community and caring far too little about their console community.
---
Legion and Plague has both been the worst updates this game has had, mediocre maps and boring to play against killers.. i respect DCs when people face legion or plague
---
Survivors hide behind gens and inside lockers all the time. This excuse is getting really really old. If you wanna camp then just camp, justify it in your head however you like but don't try everyone else to buy that shit.
---
Did she eat Jane? She went from stick to thick lol
---
\*EW 3 theme\*
---
Source?
---
And my point was that SWF is completely and utterly broken.
---
Wins: LOL PUSSY BBY KILLER LOLOLO CALM DOWN
---
Loses: REPORTED 4 BEING FAGGT CAMPR GIT GUD SCRUB SO BAD AT THIS GAYME
---
Not gonna deny that. A survivor getting a 5 second speed boost and an instaheal when there are only 20 seconds left before the exit gates are opened is too much. You can't really compete with that. If NOED went I'd be down for Adrenaline going too.
---
I loooooove scratched mirror Myers, both when playing him and playing against him. Honestly, Michael is one of the most fun and versatile killers in the game, I even love losing against him.
---
Console needs better aim assist, it's way too easy to 360 someone on console and the devs have even stated so.
---
Kate is scrawny, there is nothing thicc about Kate. The spirit isin't thicc either. Jane has no curve to her, its mostly covered from fat and maybe it looks that way from certain cosmetics. In her default skin she looks okish but her other cosmetics just make her look fat. Also Jane really doesn't have a butt, its mostly thighs. 
---
u sound like someone who's either bad at the game or plays survivor only...
---
And then you find out he’s got the lock of hair attachment 
---
Freddy rework has been talked about for almost a year. It's about as likely as a Scream DLC
---
What are you talking about. Of course it creates artificial difficulty. It's an artificial achievement!!!! 
---
It wouldn't be an acheivment if you didn't have to do something out of the ordinary to get it. 
---
So sorry your highness didn't get his acheivment for 4king "potatoes survivors". You entitled douche. 
---
I think they are on console. 
---
I’m calling bull
---
[Evidence from a knowledgeable source](https://youtu.be/F5OVEQ23KrA) 
---
Urban evasion 🤢
---
And Hag. 
---
Reminds me of that Jason X scene.
---
“Guys he just wanted his machete back!”
---
I mean all the dbd players does , imo just do voice overs man , we come here for him and his personality not just some montage which you can find anywhere with overused not funny Brolls
---
I have been survivor main since release and to be honest yes the nerfs for deceive and pallets were necessary but that is where if should have ended but they decided to nerf flashlight change the timing for it multiple times nerf the window vault speed and buff noed so every killer can use it even if they just started the game I stopped playing since the Legion release because he was such a fun killer to play against now I barely play the game and only as killer because with survivor it's barely playable you need to rely on 3 randoms hoping they would do the gens while I distract the killer because if I don't they die in 10-20 seconds and the game is really not fun for me anymore 
---
Blue arrows incoming 
---
You need to chase more I guess.
---
This goes for survivors too. You can literally stand in a corner facing the wall and let the survs do gens and escape. They won't pip.
---
I always love it when they DC. Would rather waste points than have a bad game.
---
I said perk 100%.
---
I never said it does.
---
Yes it is, it's an unfair mechanic entitled killers abuse. You have to have a God run to survive being tunneled the entire game.
---
Survivors literally have nothing crutch left besides SWF, which can literally never be fixed without tanking this games playerbase, and that's not an issue that needs to be approached from the SWF angle, but rather from the none-SWF angle.
---
Meanwhile, killers have camping, tunneling, NOED, extremely unfair add-ons, Mori, etc.
---
To top it off, several killers who arnt even that OP are legitimately just unfun to play against (Pig, Leathercamp, Clown, Hag, etc). The game is ultimately supposed to be fun for all players, not just 1.
---
God damn it Jim!
---
Yh but it’s so stupid I get all 4 kills they get 1 gen and I get no where near a pip it should be if you 4K you double pip you complete your only objective as killer to the most you complete it.
---
Yeah, I love it because its usually funny. Like you kept juking them and they just get so mad. 
---
Especially on PlayStation haha
---
Vaccinate your kids people please 👏👏
---
Hahahaha 
---
It's the same people who'd call you a camper for defending a point in call of duty, that's what you're supposed to do though! There's killers that want the game to be easy by hard camping and that sucks, but I find the survivors who refuse to leave a hook because they feel they're entitled to an easy save waaaaay worse.
---
self care, dead hard and adrenaline
---
:)
---
Sadness. 
---
Same Freddy. Fucking same. 
---
Darn
---
Makes sense, you need to practice finishing chases quicker. But there comes a problem, LF is not the bets chaser as his power can't do a lot unless survivors fuck up or are in a bad spot.
---
I remember this wraith i looped for 3 or 4 gens in the swamp map (not boat house one) he finally caught me inside and couldnt find a way out so i got free,went throught the chase once again. When he finally caught me he face camped ne hard, team got free.in post game chat he said he face camped because i was being toxic,not once did i tbag lmao.
---
I’m obsessed 
---
That’s exactly the problem. I was red rank survivor before this. Now I’m getting stuck against rank 15-10 killers that tunnel off the hook. Half the games just aren’t worth playing. So it literally doesn’t matter if I hit gens or not. More times than not, the killer breaks a chase on someone else and tunnels my ass because I have feng’s blue hair or orange dress. 
---
I’ve been in games where the drop chase and literally tunnel me for 5 gens. They refuse to break my loops. 
---
What do you mean no guidelines? You gotta level up the 4 emblems you see in the post game. Each emblem has a description on how its scored and what you have to do. 
---
what counts is not the number of matches you got but their quality
---
I agree, but if you’re going to make it super hard to rank up, you also need to make it rather difficult to derank too, or it just becomes a clusterfuck of what’s happening right now where good survivors are stuck in low ranks
---
Well, the old DS had no counter, yes you could use Enduring or Dribble but it is still an annoying perk to face. new DS is shit if you compare it to the old one, but now it has a purpose, before it was a get out of jail free card.
---
Idk about super rare, it’s an extremely meta perk right next to old ds (which doesn’t exist anymore). I just think it’s unfair to screw over a killer who could of had a chance when they’ve only got less than a minute to get another hook. I think it would make more sense to just pick survivors up out of the dying state instead of allowing them a full heal.
---
Ithappened to me in game (i escaped) but when i got back it was fine
---
2 DCers every game is fuuuuuuuuun. Literally being unable to do skill checks because of lag is *fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunnnnnnnnnnn*.
---
I edited it 30 seconds after I posted it.
---
You can balance it by punishing killers for doing it in other ways. 
---
You should enjoy it, because IT'S A GAME. 
---
The game is the worst it's ever been since I've started playing about a year ago. They have continuously nerfed survivors and ignored the killer problems.
---
No? First of all rank doesn't matter. Ranking up gets harder as you rank up. It shouldn't be difficult to derank. Personally I hate black pips, either you win or lose, there shouldn't b anything in between.
---
They need to just change the adepts back to the way they were, where you just had to 4K with the killer+ perks. I like the idea of a double pip being something really special and rare 
---
You better hope that the rest of your team likes the Halloween soundtrack.
---
Dead Hard, Empathy, Self-care and Adrenaline is my usual set up. I often run plunderers instead of empathy or self-care though and I'm gonna run head-on too when I get back to playing.
---
Give hell to those camping cowards.
---
I'm replying to comments for me on my post.. Nice try.
---
Don't forget the Pudding. 
---
"It's heavy with salt..."
---
Head pops with RBTs are so rare, just make em,5000 points imo. I've played Pig a fair bit and played against a bunch in my time playing the game.  I've seen literally 2 headpops xP
---
Last time the devs showed the stats late last year there was still just shy of a 50% survival rate at red ranks. Lower at the lowest ranks.
---
So it was balanced around the high ranks. I do feel though that DS alone had a huge impact on the game. Even just having to dribble a survivor wasted enough time for a gen to finish.
---
Fact is the average player seems to be struggling as survivor. Its really not good for the health of the game.
---
Im not saying it should be balanced for potatoes, I'm just saying little things here and there could be all it needs - so for the example I usrd earlier Kindred as a base ability. SWF have that anyway so killers that dont lobby dodge wouldnt even notice the difference.
---
I really don't feel like NOED is needed anymore either.
---
Are you blind? 
---
hmm i agree but also disagree? Sometimes a match can go great everyone gets big bloodpoint gains but then having to wait for 10 mins for a shitty killer/survivors kinda sucks i kinda enjoy getting more games in tbh :o 
---
You guys already took DS, you're not taking adrenaline without literally 2/3 of the survivor playerbase leaving this game idiot. 
---
Salty killer that can’t end the game quickly spotted
---
Exactly, Legions ability should be more focused towards Chaining Attacks on multiple survivors
---
It's even better when he just tombstones you - even after you learn the correct distance to fall out the exit, you get stabbed to death.  You just go, "well, I kind of deserved that".
---
Are you high?
---
&gt;she
---
Good coordination can *never* be nerfed without making the soloQ experience absolute hell, and that would kill this game.
---
Taking a big ol' nom of it.
---
Please counter with an argument.
---
Sounds like a small peepee boi to me
---
You wouldn't get any pleasure out of it, because you'd be dead already.
---
You mean leatherface?
---
Yeah, I'm too broke to buy Jane
---
*\[Teleport back to the basement as a Hag and snatch somebody off a hook because they couldn't be bothered to crouch or use a flashlight\]*  
---
"OMG CAMP MUCH!?"
---
I've played killer for a long time in all ranks and it's incredibly rare. If I ever see multiple survivors benefiting from the effect, I immediately message them and ask if I can play with them instead of the potatoes I get lol.
---
It's not unfair and the killer isn't being screwed over because they had their chances to down multiple people who were either wasting time healing each other, or spending time injured (not sure why you're saying a minute, because that isn't true - they could have been injured way longer). It's a whole perk slot for five seconds of benefit.
---
And I'm not sure what you mean because Adrenaline only heals for a single health state? It doesn't full heal. 
---
I got this and submitted a ticket to BHVR. Make sure you do the same.
---
I dont see how you can tell the size of someone's organ through their few button controls in an area that could be hundreds of miles from where you are. 
---
But facecamping is a shit move pls dont do it.
---
People who tunnel and camp usually don't care about points and stuff like that. I can't think of anything the devs could change or balance to stop it.
---
The game really isn't that unbalanced. I personally have no issues as a survivor. It's extremely easy to apply gen pressure, and that's really all you need to win.
---
Lmfao beating Guy in SFIV reference I hope
---
:D
---
Well, we do know about Freddy's past...
---
I  also have an issue with seeing him being unable to do anything except run around and hide =/ At least if some of of his perks included some form of self-defense or something. Or even him being a killer and survivor being deadite. He really had a lot of potential.
---
No.
---
The problem is latency. And also teammates that are **too** eager at wasting pallets
---
OMEGA TURBO SADNESS RANK 3
---
uh, yes. confirmed by devs.
---
That make up is particularly impressive. Well done! Props to them for their creativity and dedication.
---
play one game as freddy
---
I mean it's not just a latency issue.
---
If people are camping the hook and tunneling, just do gens. If the killer camps the hook (assuming the survivor doesn’t kill themself) that’s 2 whole minutes the other 3 has to do gens. Gens take 80 seconds at base, that’s 3 generators and then 40 seconds to find and get about 20-30 seconds progress on another 3
---
but it is. the devs have looked into the hitboxes and they’re fine.
---
Thank goodness I picked up Adept Trapper before this at least. 
---
You should try to play a killer like the Doctor without Ruin on ranks better than 8 and come back.
---
My spirit would be most excited
---
Remove fun out of survivors (changing pallets completely) YES
---
Changing generator time from 80 sec to 100 sec
---
NO
---
I love these devs
---
Literally on to of everything else? Yes.
---
They seem shit even when I'm the host. Hitboxes are all over the place it seems. Sometimes it feels like they stay too long, getting stunned by pallets that are already down by the time I get there, or scoring hit when the lunge is already over.
---
Wait what's required in order to get merciless now? I've been wondering why I'm not getting it at all compared to a while ago -.-
---
And depiped
---
The problem is the pallet nerf in June last year, instead of nerfing gens they nerfed the fun in survivors.. i hate it
---
Not to mention you really don't have any control over when it procs. It's also hard-countered by NOED. 
---
What did you do?
---
**YES!  YES!** (overly dramatic music playing as camera slowly spins around my face)
---
How the fuck are you guys so fast
---
Don't. Take. My. Iridescent. Stone. 
---
Seriously, don't. It's finally good. 
---
yeah i got one pip, before that would be a crisp double because i did good
---
If you think PC times are that much better, you're wrong. The problem with the old mm wasn't the wait times, but the weird matching in general. Red rank killers paired with rank 15s and 20s, high rank survivors paired with low rank killers and teammates. It was broken.
---
Spicy
---
She should do a jane cosplay lol she got the hips for it!
---
that’s just a problem with the lunge. they’ve never changed the hitboxes but they did change how lunging works, it used to have to actually hit them during the swing, now the entire lunge counts as a hit, which isn’t hitboxes at all.
---
You said this in another comment. Care to explain to someone who doesn’t get it?
---
it's about the killer ping and the skill balance.
---
Oh there are plenty but this community only knows memes.
---
Thanks u/ZombieHuggerr 
---
for the quick edit 
---
Jeeeesus! He did an amazing job!! Holy heck, freaky fast too! 
---
Although M&amp;A is very fun, and necessary for jumpscare Myers, it's performance can be real map dependent since Myers is still a giant man with a big white mask. Coldwind is basically a hard counter to M&amp;A. Although M&amp;A might be good paired with Infectious Fright, dunno.
---
If you really want to buff your Myers, go for A Nurse's Calling. It's a good fit for his naturally low terror radius.
---
shhhh shhhhh

no yelling

---
Ok then genius.
---
4 survivors pop adrenaline. Swf so 2 of them are already waiting to open the exit gates at the last gen is finished.
---
Killer now has 20 seconds before the gates open. Even if in a chase he has to 1) catch up to the survivor who just got a 5 second 150% speed boostz 2) Hit them, 3) catch up again, 4) hit them, 5) hook them.
---
Thats for just one survivor.
---
How is anyone meant to come back against that? Idiot. Killer might as well just stand in the corner and wait for them to leave.
---
DS was an awful crutch perk anyway. It needed to go. Anyone who defended it didn't give one shit about balance.
---
When I'm solo I'm only playing killer. I knew this was gonna happen, instead of fixing the objectives a lot of nerfs while helping killers just made the game stale and boring considering you had less tools to play around with for survivors. Solo queue is shit and I hate how every discussion is shit down by gut gud. Or when they try to balance a shitty mechanic by making things useless. People said new DS shouldn't be affected by enduring because it renders it completely useless and people lost their shit over it. "It used to be broken, survivor perk/item/addon better be useless now"
---
i dont camp and still have little pp
---
Try this: Spirit with both windstorm addons (Wakizashi Saya and the green one) in badham pre school. Phase walk to the hole in the school then lunge as you go over the hole
---
Oh I really hope this is true lol. Happened at least 8 times yesterday.
---
Thanks!
---
And he's just like "SCORE!"
---
Alrighty I'll keep this in mind
---
Fair point, but I like to make videos and stream the game. And rank 8 looks a lot more respectable than rank 12 lol
---
Omfg i was able to escape by literally holding m1 for 2 minutes noob killer ez game pure skill
---
Does no one realize that there's multiple teams within a game development team? There's concept artists, creative designers, gameplay designers, programmers, all that stuff. There is without a doubt a team dedicated to fixing bugs. Doesn't mean they're good ad it. But the whole "stop giving us content and fix bugs" thing is rediculous.
---
That’s why I hate low rank as a survivor. Too many bad killers who do nothing but face camp.
---
My man, the real memer right here
---
I mean, Legion is basically Scream DLC, only it isn't licensed.
---
You have to get a Merciless Killer emblem score which requires more than just a 4k
---
It's not removing the fun, it's nerfing the possibility to actually win a chase dramatically. 
---
Why are we still here, just to suffer?
---
Probably shit like prayer beads. Which *to be fair* prayer beads is just a little bit dumb. Maybe if you could hear it after 2 seconds of the killer being within a 4m radius of you so Spirit can’t just sit there and check for collision where survivors would be.
---
Yeah the requirement is that you double pip using only their 3 perks
---
Same. Hoping within the next night or two I can get to green and at least be able to safety pip from there on. 
---
Wrong. NOED punishes survivors for ignoring their secondary objective and just doing gens.
---
Additionally, the killer still has to HIT the survivor to get the benefit before they open the gates and leave.
---
Sure thing, the second you give him their pay and resources. 
---
Until then, maybe hop off those nuts?
---
The 2016 one looks like she's in this constant state of being caught eating from the cookie jar.
---
Once again, survivor main stating how op adrenaline is.  I’m an awful killer and I’ve only played spirit for like a week so I’m not basing my opinion on that. I LOVE when 4 peoples adrenaline goes off resulting in a 4 escape, however, I understand how frustrating it can be for a killer.
---
Whats the illegitimate way? Im just asking for a friend....
---
ok well yeah, chainsaw hitboxes are broken af too but my point was mainly about how survivor hitboxes aren’t as bad as it seems.
---
It’s a he
---
whats funny about that is pinhead would probably fuck his victims because whoever finishes the puzzle is promised unimaginable pleasure which isnt a trick. they really will get to experience the most intense pleasure they have ever felt its just that the cenobites are sense freaks and while they will show their victims the most intense pleasure they have ever experienced they will also show them the most intense pain
---
he’ll get those if he goes to work there, so why hasn’t he since he’s so amazing at it?
---
She’s too old for Freddy
---
dovahkiin
---
SWF is the main reason why the game is so successful. Good luck getting this nerfed aswell. 
---
I meant activating mid-chase resulting in an escape, not to mention bypassing exhaustion. I’ve had it proc right after a lithe burst and my ass was **g o n e**. It just seems like *too much* of a perk. 
---
where's the small billy
---
Iridescent hatchets are anything but balanced. 
---
DS definitely needs to be reworked to not run out of time when downed, however old ds was hella toxic and I’m glad it’s gone.
---
I honestly wonder how nurse can be nerfed without her becoming completely unviable. 
---
Thats why I use to grind to level up asap as survivor every month. Playing against low ranks is incredibly frustrating because they'll either get looped all game or just tunnel the hell out of the first person they hook, while the other survivors sit around the hook waiting for the camper to leave.
---
Now though...you can't even do that since it takes so long to pip. I've lost the will to play survivor.
---
They hated him because he spoke the truth. 
---
I tried playing without ruin and it's really hard to play without it with the current gen speed. I understand why it's meta even if I don't like it.
---
**Of course it always depends on the person**, but I think the consensus is when people are in drag, they like to be referred to as 'she'.
---
When they are out of drag, they like to be referred to as 'he'.
---
Was this changed recently? It was just getting 4 kills last time I went for one (Legion)
---
why would they lie about the hitboxes being fine and dedicated servers fixing the hits. what do they gain from that? exactly.
---
All my games either have someone crashing or a rage quitter two minutes in. I keep safety pipping because of it.
---
If you actually rage quit, you should have to wait for the previous lobby to end before you can rejoin.
---
That’s the opposite of a problem!
---
Lmao thank you for this 😂 
---
Perks :
---
Monitor and Abuse
---
Enduring and Spirit Fury
---
Hex:Ruin or Corrupt Intervention ( but never use the both )
---
Surveillance
---
Whispers if you have problems with tracking.
---
Add-ons :
---
Efectiveness + Cool-down ( broken status faster and you can hit them before reaching at a pallet/window )
---
Apples and faster charge time are nice too
---
Iridescent Seal + Worhship Tablet + Tinkerer is a really fun combo to use.
---
That doesn't work. If all pools are corrupted you automatically get the Corrupt Purge and the pools are cleansed.
---
so can someone fill me in or link me somewhere that'd tell me why people are all over Ash? 
---
Freddy “yes please”
---
Hey moron. Game devs have dedicated teams for content and others for bug fixes. 
---
Yeah. It was in the latest update along with the emblem changes. It used to just be 4 kills.
---
If I had gold youd receive it good sir. From one who plays both but loves the challenge as killer more this literally screams accurate. I've had my fair share of being pissed at BM but after the match you got to evaluate your options and realize it was on YOU as the killer. Not on them for outplaying you. Could it be the addons your using perhaps? Or maybe perks? Or maybe your overall play style should be changed and tweaked? Those are the questions you got to ask yourself from either side not just immediately scream the other sides at fault.
---
Any suggestions?
---
Edgy
---
Heres the guidelines for killer: You want a lot of chases. Winning chases will increase your chaser score. You have to make sure not to camp for this one, as camping decreases your chaser score (the punishment they added for camping), and decreases your chance of a pip.
---
You're gonna want to try and stop them before they get too many gens done, or at least delay the game. Ruin is a big help in this, and will improve your gatekeeper score. Gatekeeper is scored based on how many gens are done at the given time of the game up to a certain amount of time (can't remember the amount of time offhand, but it's around ten minutes if I'm not mistaken, so no gens done within ten min should be iri gatekeeper). 
---
This next one is the one where people are getting fucked over a little, cause the survivors have A LOT of say in whether or not you actually do well in this category. Devout. For iri devout, you need to hook survivors a total of nine times. If you mori them after first hook (or tombstone them without any hooks) you're fucked in this category. If the surv dc's before hook, you're fucked. If the surv kills themselves on first hook, you're fucked.
---
The malicious category is literally just getting hits. So as long as you're hitting survs you should be doing fine in this category.
---
All of this is easily found in patchnotes/in the after game screen, so if you forget, you can always look and see what you need to do!
---
So the teleport removable is completely fair then since that was OP, I’d still argue that two pallets in a single loop is would be a little dumb. Survivors still have some unfair loops where the killer can’t catch the survivor. Survivors need strong loops to stand a chance but unfair loops with strong pallets would be hell to play against. 
---
That's a classic response. Sure. 5-10% of the developers actually do game development, the rest's working on cosmetics. 
---
Damn that's wack lol
---
GIVE PLAYERS BACK THE WAITING TIME AND WE ARE COOL
---
Yeah and bug fixing takes longer than new content because of all the code they have to go through, then testing to make sure the fix doesn't break something else.
---
God some of you are so fucking dumb, I'm amazed you haven't died yet!
---
That fucking sucks lol
---
when u have smol pp so u rage
---
Survivors need more options. Their weapons against the killer are pallets (nerfed), windows (nerfed), and flashlights (nerfed). They've removed and nerfed so many tools that looping is really all that's left. Killers keep getting new options and powers, survivors keep losing them.
---
Oh no
---
Gens are done in 80 seconds (Assuming not a single great skill check is hit and they don't have a tool box) making ruin almost mandatory on killer if you don't want 3 gens to pop before even one survivor is caught. 
---
There are 4 survivors and 1 killer making it impossible for the killer to be everywhere at once.
---
Unless the killer is playing legion or nurse the chase is dependant on the survivor making mistakes. 
---
Bloodlust loops like the iron works still exist in which the killer is forced to sink a large portion of time to even force them off of it. 
---
I think that's what he's referring to, the vacuum is when you would teleport to the other side of the pallet as soon as you hit the drop button. Vacuum, teleport, it's the same thing.
---
And fun for survivors maybe, not so much fun for killer.
---
Prob bullshit like frank mixtape, omegablink, spirits purple addons (anal beads, wakazashi), iri stone, iri head, exhaustion clown 
---
Unfortunately so. I would 4 stack with friends and 3 of us always used party streamers, low and behold killer managed to tunnel the three of us that used streamers and then let the last person who didn’t use streamers farm and leave. I’ve legit died in 2 minutes and watched the next 15 mins of farming proceed to happen
---
Rank 3 solo survivor... it's very easy to get good gen pressure. The average survivor is bad at the game and spends more time crouching around the map and looking for ruin than actually doing objectives.
---
I do agree that the ruin buff seems weird. Low rank survivors already struggle against average killers and if your going to normalize ruin across all ranks, maybe that's a sign that the normal pace of the game needs to be looked at. 
---
Also, regarding NOED. As a killer main, even I think it's a similar case as DS. It can have it's uses but a lot of killers just use it as a crutch to supplement their lack of mid game pressure. I never run it, mostly because I think the late game builds are just too gimmicky. 
---
Amazing art, I love it!
---
I’m a little confused in that your first post says moris should be on the chopping block, which I completely agree with,  but this post says they ebonies should remain as is. Aren’t these conflicting statements?
---
this is advanced shitpost. take the upvote.
---
I'm just going to assume you're new here. 
---
I was rank 1 before the patch. Lol
---
If some one is healing with 20/24/28 meters of you then you will see their aura. The basic counter is to just not heal if you're in the killer's terror radius since it's usually larger than the max range of ANC (32 v 28), but that doesn't apply to good ol' Mikey (8/16 in I/II).
---
It's also great on Hag and any other low terror radius killer, and even works alright on killers with the default terror radius.
---
It's Nurse's third teachable, so if you've got or are willing to sock away about a million BP you can just grab it without playing her. Alternatively dehumanize yourself and face to console blinks.
---
nope, i just don’t ride hate trains for no reason.
---
Jane x plague= this 
---
It’s toxic chasing them right off a hook. 
---
Killer: being a sweaty tryhard against casual survivors
---
Survivors: disconnect
---
Killer: :0
---
Do bloodpoint offerings multiply the bloodpoints I win in game or just raise the cap for bloodpoints in that category? Or both?
---
Adrenaline usually just ate my exhaustion and then got my killed by NOED. I like to be injured end game for dead hard so the Dead Hard+Hope combo has been way better for me.
---
Get good at putting people on hooks, that slows the game down.
---
because every game I use a mori with instadowns..
---
So if survivors are good at using lockers they should be punished by camping?
---
Love it! 
---
Good luck blinding someone you can't even see, lmao.
---
accurate representation of the dbd community
---
And while you’re chasing that one the others are fixing the gens with ruin not being an issue.
---
Get good at fucking off? Ok
---
Use curropt intervention and whispers to get good momentum from the beginning, ruin is only useful to stop survivors from completing gens at the beginning of the match when the killer is just looking for survivors. Once you gain momentum and have someone on the hook, and chasing someone else you don’t even need ruin.
---
So just use corrupt intervention.
---
Don’t use logic. Doesn’t work in life. 
---
Moris are moris.. There are the very reason that the game is just about some random games with unique experience.  
---
People should chill a bit. This game is gonna nowhere and people expectation are way too high.
---
It depends on the killer you are but killers with an instadown, or spirit/huntress could easily contest the gates being opened. Even in your extremely unlikely example I could think of 6 killers that had the advantage still. 
---
And you dont hook in that situation dingus, you slug.
---
On PS4 it helps slow down the game a lot because we have laggy skill checks all the time. Hitting that great is a lot harder.
---
Imagine complaining about Hex: Ruin being weak.
---
I don’t use Twitter but I have Tumblr and Instagram! https://art-by-mw.tumblr.com/post/183452569627/im-just-saying-this-is-my-instagram-and-patreon
---
I would agree with this but the most fun I've ever had in dbd was the first couple hours where everything is terrifying and even escaping a chase for a short out of time feels godly xD
---
Which is weird because I feel like he spends a lot of the movies getting his ass kicked, running for his life, and screaming his head off. Like, that’s one of the reasons Bruce Campbell is so good: he’s amazing at physical comedy. 
---
I feel like the bigger issue is that they’re putting one of the best talkers in horror in a game where nobody can talk. 
---
I just had a match where it was gone 30 seconds in. That slowed the game down loads
---
Had a flashlight juker last night disconnect when I finally downed him. I had the last laugh, though - I offered bloody party streamers 😂
---
I got called a camper playing Spirit with Mother-Daughter ring and a nearly instant transition addon.
---
Like....I don't think they know just how fast that thing makes me. I have a totem build (TotH, Ruin, Haunted Grounds, BBQ) and the instant I get a notification, I phase jump and run to the sound. I can be on the other side of the map and suddenly appear there.
---
I'm pretty sure people that shout "camper" or "tunneler" in a lot of these situations have just never played as a killer, let alone THE killer they are complaining about. 
---
I don’t even use them with other people anymore because literally every time more than one is used, the killer DCs. 
---
Ngl, I facecamp like a champ when I get teabagged.
---
Damn, I saw all of your DBD art post, and I LOVE IT!!!! Thank you for drew the Doctor! He’s my favorite :)
---
Hitting skillchecks shouldn’t make you this emotional. You need to experience life without ruin, try a new build.
---
Iridescent Head should not be an insta down. There are more unique ideas they can come up with for an ultra rare add on other than “lol I win the game”. Stuff like Mother Daughter Ring and Iridescent Button.
---
Prayer Beads, All of legions purple add ons, insta saw, omegablink.
---
How dare you use the perks you brought! Shameful!

---
This os why we can't have nice things. Neither side wants to give up anything.
---
I play survivor too and I would ditch Adrenaline in a heartbeat if it meant killers lost NOED. NOED is more powerful than Adrenaline anyway.
---
Think about the bigger picture.
---
Is there a reason why gay guys are drawn more to this game than others? I run into a lot more gay guys in this game than other games. It makes me happy to see other gay guys but it confuses me why a specific group is lured to it. Personally, the thrill of being chased is what draws me to this game. I freak out easily so its really exciting. I dont like playing killer though especially with players who get toxic after they die. 
---
I had to downvote so it could be 420 I am ashamed
---
Death is not an escape (from queening)
---
I am always delighted when people draw The Clown! 
---
The game map has alot of safe pallets and is survivor sided since the pallet changes imo.
---
My goodness I wish this was real. If I could get Hellraiser and Evil Dead in one game.. I don’t know if I’d ever play anything again. 
---
I'd be really fond of joke offerings that made you T pose or like flipped the model upside down, just fun things.
---
It looks super fake and edited. Not impressed. Take my downvote karma whore
---
No, they weren't an event thing. They simply decided to stop allowing those to spawn on the bloodweb a decent while ago, before more recently deciding to yank them out of the game altogether. 
---
Yoooo! That's pretty cool!
---
I think we both know that's not true
---
Imagine complaining about a perk that is made to be a gamble to use being inconsistent. If you don’t want to run a full totem build, just use corrupt intervention/dying light.
---
I get they wanted to balance how the game works, but if old matchmaking is on ps4(I haven't played in about a week so I'm just going off what I've read on this post), then ps4 is unplayable. I'd have times where I was waiting over an hour to find a match just for the killer to DC and I'd have to wait another hour. I want the game to be balanced, I really do, but I'd prefer actually being able to play the game than playing with a new matchmaking system that takes 3 hours to play for 20 minutes 
---
Well it’s a shit perk atm so die
---
Although I agree wholeheartedly with the point you're trying to drive across, there are probably better ways to convey the message than shitting on the devs. 
---
That depends on which offering you use. Say you use an Escape Cake, it just doubles all your blood points per category. I think the only time bloodpoints per game are doubled is when you use offerings for special events

Teabagging has been a thing since the 90s. It's not exclusive to DBD. Most everyone who plays DBD will already know what teabagging is. 
---
I like to play him and draw him alot! He needs more drawings. 😄
---
Imagine being so childish you tell others to die when they refute your point
---
Me, post game chat: WTF was that Claudette doing?
---
Guy that died on basement hook: Throwing the game, obviously.
---
No he saw no one on his BBQ and chilli perk and guessed correctly that the other three survivors were nearby so why would he leave? 
---
Had he been wrong and they just used a locker to fool him they would have free range over the map to do as many generators /totems as possible until the killer realized his mistake. 
---
So it was noit my imagination and the game got darker?
---
YEAH YOU ARE RIGHT FAGGOTS THAT WANTED THE REVERT ARE THE ONES TO FUCKING BLAME FUCK THEM TOO
---
Omg thank you! I have been a fan of your drawings for awhile now &gt; &lt;
---
Game is fine now. The game is balanced regarding Killer vs Survivors.  
---
Now we need a focus on map, in order to have less variance regarding the Killer/Map match-up. We need a rework on a lot of add-on, to make yellow/brown more interesting and Purple/Red less broken. We need a better balancing between killers, there is a too big powercreep between Trapper and Billy for instance. And finally, we need Perk improvement. I hope that they will buff every bad perk in the game.  
---
Otherwise, I am fine with the game. I stomp bad survivors and struggle against good ones. Game feels either easy either close, where sometime I have the game in hand but they manage to bait me correctly, outplay me and beat me. That is fine. Really. I can't understand most critics and whining.
---
They just have to fix it. I went against a newbie rank19 clown last night but no one in my team was below rank15 and I am rank8. That clown would lose us every time we ran into the cornfield or any jungle gyms. I don't think that clown or any other new players would like to have a faster waiting time instead of fair games.
---
Shit point
---
The problem was that on PC you were seeing low ranks getting shoved in with high ranks. Rank 19-13 survivors against Rank 1 killers. Near constantly. Also lots of people getting shoved in with bad pings way more often than they would have.
---
Get fucked, rip your post lmao
---
Tbh I'm not sure. Me and my other gay friends have wondered the same thing. It's not particularly campy so idk
---
Weeb 
---
I mean the pont of it is that it slows them down either a little or a lot, just depending on where it gets placed. Sometimes you get unlucky. If you really want to slow down the game use corrupt intervention since it'll give you at least 80-120s of additional time and herd the survivors to one side of the map. 
---
Imo hex ruin is pretty balanced and it's preemptively understand that it's a gamble as to how much time it'll delay. 
---
Like, why they love him or why people are talking about it? For the first part of the question: Just watch the Evil Dead series and Ash vs Evil Dead; you can't not love him, and for the second part: BHVR forgot to remove his perks from KYF when the last chapter dropped, spoiling that he'll be a new licensed survivor.
---
^^*aaahhhhhhhh*
---
So it multiplies points per category without raising the cap?
---
I mean it's cool and all but a little toxic that you abused it.
---
Agreed. I was having a blast being able to play with friends again. Back to virtually no playing at all now.
---
Really isn't. Hes right. You are just a whiny bitch who's crying for a perk to replace skill.
---
Nothing trapper has is broken
---
This is very clever. Well done.
---
Yeah that definitely happens too lmao, I was using dead hard for awhile and loving it but something with the new update either made me really bad at using it or it’s just lagging b/c it hasn’t been working as well. I switched to lithe and I’ve been enjoying it now that it actually works.
---
It's a gaymer's paradise 
---
Upvoted for cheese it
---
&gt; Do some shit where instead of rank being based on pips, it's based on time played. And based on time played you are given a rank.
---
I would also like it if they'd take into account perks and items for rank - hell, even character level would make sense and it's an easy value they can grab. There are so many times when I've faced a killer at low ranks (I don't play enough to get high ranks, especially with the new pip system) and they have all these tier 3 synergistic perks and very rare/ultra rare addons so the survivors don't stand a chance.
---
By the same token, though I don't play killer much, you see the same thing on survivors. Low ranks but maxed perks that work well together. It's not fun for either side to face this kind of thing.
---

---
Yeah, honestly I think plague is a little weak at the moment. Her early game is really tough even with corrupt intervention. Most survivors now just wait out the countdown and then start gen rushing the gens you weren't originally patrolling. I honestly think that they should either make nurses calling apply on the fountains or increase the duration that vile purge lasts on objects.
---
Yeah it's back to old matchmaking on PS4 now. It was fun finding matches and playing with friends too.
---
I've been waiting to dive into killer for when I'm able to unlock one of the new ones, but I'm having a hard time deciding what killer to unlock with Iridescent Shards. I've heard that Doctor builds bloodpoints like crazy, but that he's boring to play and for everyone else to play against. I like Clown, but most folks rank him really low, so that's an obvious uphill battle. Plague is new, but her bloodpoint generation seems lacking from what I've seen.
---
So my question is, what killer should I purchase first out of the ones that can be purchased with shards? Which one will benefit me the most?
---
The game is very unbalanced. You just dont really notice it because the only time you will face multiple “toxic” builds are during events. The game is literally balanced by the OP shit being “rare” and bloodwebs being a ridiculous slog to get through at the higher levels. So if someone grinded for long enough they could get access to lots of those OP add ons....such amazing balance.
---
Umbra_bug is a streamer and she is a huntress main. She has something like 800 iri heads last time I checked and thats someone who doesnt try and go for iri heads. Thats 800 games of just pure bullshit for survivors. I dont even remember the ebony mori number but its something like 150 at least.
---
Ebony Mori’s bypass 2 hook states for every survivor. When an ebony mori is brought the best case scenario for survivors is maybe someone gets the hatch.
---
An ebony mori is like if 2 survivors brought the insta heal needle. And Im not trying to say insta heals arent balanced either, im saying how bullshit both are.
---
I suffered through the most recent chinese new year event. Killers bringing ebony moris every game (which made them get less points), basement camping (which made them get literally no points) and then complaining on reddit about how killers get no points but survivors get 25 for escaping with a lantern (that you can literally destroy). 
---
bingers are a rare species.
---
Spirit is not hard to use honestly. Its very easy to down people if you get the first hit or play a bunch of mindgames in a single chase. No survivor can guess 100% of the time on your mindgames.
---
Doctor will probably benefit you the most because of his perks and BP farming. I think he's a super fun killer well. 
---
But honestly just go with whatever looks funnest to you. You'll get more shards.
---
Shit map for the killer he’s on, Tru3 not actually being one of the best players in the game by a long shot, streaming instead of completely focusing on the game. 
---
This narrative that killer is super duper hard and has no chance against swf is baseless balance whine, literally the only strong things survivors have left are insta heals and adrenaline. 
---
More like jiggle.
---
Considerably increased the chance to be mori'd
---
Run Iron Will and all the boosted spirits will be screwed.
---
Another good perk is the new one “Poised”. It actually wrecks bad spirits so hard.
---
Isn’t adept just killing everyone?
---
I agree with you completely. Adrenaline is one of the only perks that makes solo survivor actually bearable, since I don't have to rely on randoms for heals. Would definitely consider a long break if it got nerfed because I know NOED won't.
---
*2025 dbd patch*
---
Survivors now start the match in the dying state and a loud alert to the killers is sent so they don't have to waste time looking for survivors.
---
It was deemed necessary to give every killer a nurse blink to compensate for the frustration of killers.
---
Survivors may now only walk or crawl, no more running allowed as that was causing an imbalance.
---
You many now instantly summon a hook next to you by pressing space bar.
---
The entity will auto stun any survivor that completes a generator for 5 minutes so the match doesn't end too quickly.
---
So you get mowed down by killers or have an easy game as killer? Wut? You lack sportsmanship then.
---
I remember someone did an artwork where they made his disfigurement from before he was a killer less jarring. Perhaps before he was claimed by the entity, he wasn’t as extreme in appearance, but being in the entity’s realm slowly turned him into what he is in game. 
---
Yeah I would agree with the sickness change in reducing action speed. I think only sickness progression from doing actions is actually pretty week. 
---
I also wouldn't mind if they made the locations of the fountains available to see all the time so you know how many fountains are remaining and where. That would make it much more effective to patrol those location much like the pig does with the jigsaw boxes when multiple survivors are inflicted.

Billy’s kinda trash to play on console. The chainsaw is very hard to move with an analog stick. People on PC use Q and E, we should be able to use L1/R1.
---
That's the moment I knew I'd love the show and I binged all 3 seasons in a week and a half 
---
I think the problem is really that had any one of them stayed away and completed three gens they would probably leave this game with maybe 8-11k bp and probably depip. Running around screwing each other out of a chance to survive on the other hand, they can manage more and at least black pip more reliably
---
Isn’t it the greatest?
---
I totally agree, but when you’re not in a chase and injured and then you get that Insta-heal it makes no sense and just adds to the “well fuck” for killers. I feel it’d make more sense to just pick you up out of dying state then to heal everybody regardless of if they need it or not. Hell it may even make sense to pick you up from the dying state the next time you’re downed, that way it just extends the chase. A lot of perks need to get reworked (lookin’ at you left behind &gt;:3) so I hope we can all have discussions like these where we can debate what would actually work and what might promote balance. 
---
&gt;Adrenaline, balanced landing, dead hard, self care, borrowed time, instaheals, brand new parts,  gens being done in no time without ruin, infinites, being able to pip without doing anything.
---
Self care and brand new parks - have been nerfed
---
Adrenaline and instant heal are akin to Noed, as insta healing to instant downing 
---
Balanced landing and dead hard are movement to evade the killers. That I see as very well balanced, as killers are already faster than survivors 
---
And I dont run ruin on my main killers. I use spirit, hag, trapper and a bit of huntress. Generally I can get a 2-4k without ruin. And average 3ks with a hatch escape when I have ruin. (I just let them have hatch)
---
The game took away the best parts of being a survivor and aren't offering a balance of them 
---
Taken from both survivor and killer main who has 300+ hours 
---
Ow
---
when the David paused "the hell is goin on"
---
This still happens even at rank 6 so......
---
To extend the idea a little: DBD setting and characters, but with the gameplay of Until Dawn. Several of the survivors, any of which can die, versus maybe 2-3 of the killers. A more extended story going into character background and really playing up the horror side.
---
Maybe have the prologue be a few introductory scenes about the survivors and killers in our world before they get pulled into the Entity's realm and the game proper begins.
---
Honestly DBD has some really good lore but you can miss a lot of it if you don't delve into the details. I'd love to see a narrative driven game exploring it more.
---
I don't think you understand why this was posted
---
Theres very few add-ons in the game as powerful as iri heads, not close to enough to jump to the conclusion that the game is so unbalanced. Besides, iri heads aside, killer items are supposed to be better because it's 4v1 and every survivor could bring good items. 
---
I don't see moris often enough for them to have a noticeable impact on game balance, but on a good killer yeah they're broken but I think that's what the devs intend for them to be. But I don't think the game is unbalanced just because a couple of add-ons exist.
---
People like you ruin the match for me.
---
Not you.
---
You're cool. And got the NOED powerfist.
---
You yourself are even saying it's not guaranteed. There's no need to touch it. It's incomparable to noed, because adrenaline still doesn't ensure your safety, just a longer chase on the occasion where you actually benefit from it mid-chase. You are hooked when noed hits you. 
---
So if I'm getting this correct, you only want Adrenaline to proc in the instance when you're on the ground? 
---
I’m not really sure. I’m on a gay discord server and like everyone plays it, and I’ve just spoken to random LGBT friends and they play it.
---
;}
---
Sounds like you didnt get chased

where rebecca was playing a game clearly based on DBD
---
Yes, and their main source of money is the constant flow of dlc.
---
10-20 is too much for level 50.
---
You get around 15 cakes and like 5 streamers in average for leveling up to level 50.
---
Thats what I experienced and since I have everything prestige 3 all perks I think i have enough data to say that. (:
---
no one feels bad for playing Legion.
---
Some People just want to make you feel guilty
---
Fun while it lasted. Ah well, back to Apex and For Honor for me and my friends. 
---
Really wish a competent dev team would make a game like this to light a fire under BHVR's ass to actually fix this game. Why did F13 have to flop ;_;
---
Exactly, rank didn't matter. Now red ranks generally only get matched with red ranks.
---
If it wasn't for the awful new pipping system, there'd be plenty of red rank Survivors.    
---
Eatin' that booty like groceries.
---
You can if you aren't a shit survivor.
---
I hate how accurate this is 
---
With new bugs!!!
---
People look at it in a very individualistic manner. There is no arguing that in a 1 v 1 the killer is more powerful. But, the game has 1 killer and 4 survivors. The survivors have to do gens, not get and open exit gates. The killer has to prevent gens from being done, and catch and hook 4 survivors 3 times I  order to completely win. So with that being said, the killer should clearly have advantages because if they did not, it would be literally impossible to complete any objective. 
---
Is that Jane?
---
Its the best
---
I'm good friends with Mix-a-Lot... He hasn't answered his phone since this chapter dropped. 
---
*I'm worried for him*
---
Idk about you bug giving pips back but people DC on purpose to not rank up.
---
Simply put rank 1 survivors bullying killers at rank 15 and then deranking. Same goes with killers
---
Spirit, scantily clad murder machine
---
Yeah the DS change did swing the momentum quite a bit, bit gens still go too fast with two people, two tool boxes and prove thyself I knocked out a gen in what felt like ~40 seconds which even doing a sub minute gen feels VERY strong and to clarify the tool box I got was a vanilla yellow one meaning it could go even lower simply do to this good survivors can still steam roll you just need 2 people with prove thyself and a couple tool boxes.
---
Same. Shit is bullshit. Lol
---
Considerably increases the chance to be face-camped by a rank 15.
---
It’s easy to get mad at any game where there’s heavy competition. It is sort of broken in terms of gameplay for both killers and survivors but they make gameplay very easy for toxic killers and team comps
---
just a couple of days ago i got accused of playing swf becuse i was running behind an injured player towards an exit gate to save him from a hit... 
---
Haha yes sweater.
---
I’m not saying I want anything other than maybe a rework. With the addition of legion, plague, selfcare nerf, etc. it’s a little more common for people to just stay injured and rely on adrenaline (I do this too) and Swf only makes it worse b/c they can time it well. It’s not a completely broken perk, I’d just prefer if it did something useful that doesn’t make the end game pointless for killers. Idk how best to balance it to make it just a little less obnoxious but I’m definitely open to suggestions. 
---
Probably the clown, or the pig, i also enjoy the cannibals p3 outfit very much
---
her boobis are smoll tho
---
I actually only heard about the Con the day before so I made this entire mask in like 16 hours. But I got a mannequin head from a craft store and covered it with clay, making sure there was no facial features or anything, then I put several layers of paper mache on it and let it dry. Covered it with some industrial strength glue and let it dry then just spray painted it! 
---
Thank you for being specific. I didn’t realize that every single T.TV I come across in matches is an absolute GOD at the game. I will watch their motions diligently and learn from them.
---
Ah yes, Spirit 2, very original
---
I tried it on Nurse and right now it seems like a wasted slot, survivors just wait it out. Never thought about it on Hag though, it might be a good replacement for Ruin
---
Shirtless David 
---
No but for real I think the Legion’s character design is done really well even though it’s simple. 
---
Thank you
---
What’s that? I’ve never heard of it
---
By Quentin
---
Should've maybe put Freddy there because of that
---
Simple but cool looking 
---
When it does work though it’s a blessing, I’ve lost my shit over the awesome adrenaline saves I’ve pulled off. I love the perk and want it to remain good as well as make it a little less tedious than surprise everyone’s fully healed and you’ve got 15 more seconds to get 2 hits in
---
That is of little concern to someone who is trapped in a hell realm, also I like em fist sized
---
I don't get it, why you feel bad? 
---
Most of these gamers probably don’t even work let alone even have the sense to think of how a business is run/operated lol. 
---
None of them I’ve seen are God’s, but the guy who runs loops wrong and then cries balance isn’t a top teir killer
---
movie killers always look good and the clown was just scary when he came out, he was super homeless looking to me
---
Nope same boat. Me and my friends had never been so excited about getting that many games in a 2-3 hour span. 
---
The clown in that one outfit is actually pretty freaky and its always fun being chased by him. Need more intimidating outfits for killers tbh
---
Neat!
---
The number of hooks technically decrease
---
The mask and the knife aren't their only similarities. They're both quick compared to other slasher characters, there's multiple of both of them, and they're both just young teens doing messed up shit (Except for the mom in Scream 2)
---
Well, yeah, of course it’s stabbing people, but camping and tunneling with him is just silly. Darting across the map from survivor to survivor, wearing the team down gradually, and things like that is what, in my opinion makes him fun. Sure sometime playing him “honestly” makes for a hard game, but it’s fun at the end of the day. Had a survivor message me the other day saying thank you for playing Legion in a nontoxic manner because it made the game fun for them. I honestly hate that people play him the way they do, because it gives players who play him any other way a bad reputation 
---
true, and they’re smaller then mine so more like grapes
---
That's pretty damn good.
---
When I play killer against flashlighters I turn it into a mini-game.
---
I stop caring about the other people and instead hunt down the clicky clicky and just camp em out of game. The clicky heroically makes the ultimate sacrifice so the others may live. They tend to cry and whine about it being annoying and not fun like being blinded all the time is. I haven't figured out why it's not fun for them when I specifically choose to maximize my level of annoyance, though. Frankly, I have a blast with it.
---
With nurse's build in map pressure, there are probably better things to run for sure. With over 300 hours of killer play time, I can count only  a handful of times ruin has lasted longer than a minute or so for me. I'm shit at defending totems to be fair, but at least with this perk I am guaranteed to have it in the first two minutes at least xD
---
You have a really good ability to sense salt lmao 
---
It happened to me couple of times, u also lose all the blood points that u got and the characters that u leveled, i once lost 6 hours progress of blood points pips and character levels  
---
very true
---
Try r/dbdlfg !
---
I liked that they used more of the remake look then complete classic freddy
---
i actually didn’t notice that lol 
---
Wraith has the best, I like the dark and random outfits he had
---
I feel like that achievement would be legit impossible this patch - if you use his ability well, then Trapper actually gets less chase points than Bubba! So the other option is playing M1 only, and good luck getting survivors that let you 4k with that. 
---
Empathy is a great perk for being able to find injured survivors so you can heal them or see when someone is getting chased. Bond is a similar perk that doesn't need someone to be injured to find them but it only works on one other survivor
---
nurse is badass, maybe op but She look crazy 
---
A big "if" my friend. It's why I've stopped playing a lot of surv. Killer is just more fun for me at this point.
---
Spirit/Nurse, I'm into the ghost type things and even how they gave spirit 2 personalities in her animations takes the cake
---
Same I’m on Xbox too. Previously matchmaking was quick then they changed to the new system and the estimated time thing always lied.  Would sit in the lobby a good 10-15min to play one game only for 3 ppl to load and eventually I just left cause getting that 4th person was like playing where is Waldo. After they reverted it everything got a lot better. Interesting seeing everyone’s diff experiences and hope a solution is found. 
---
After ~1800 hours I still go to the wiki it never goes away lol
---
As a killer main I have to admit I believe they have gotten a little too buff happy with us as of late.  My games have never felt easier.  I think buffing NOED so it downs at all ranks was a horrible idea.  It's just way too prevalent now across the ranks.  I think them nerfing Decisive essentially out of the game 3 seconds duration won't stop them from simply sticking to the tunnel and redowning you WITHOUT also adjusting our version in NOED was a bit unfair.  They should have both been reworked together.
---
I dislike the ruin change to have it apply to all survivors at all tiers was a mistake too.  Not because it's an unfair perk because it totally isn't I use it myself it's just at least when it only applies to all survivors at tier 3 there was some variety in killer loadouts.  I never ran it unless it was tier 2 at least preferably 3 so when I didn't have it at least I would show some different perks to people.  You're going to see baby survivors at high ranks having an incredibly tough time because they just cannot repair through the perk at that rank and ruin 1 will be on every killer.
---
BNP's which were bullshit to be fair and flashlights which weren't that hard to play against have been nerfed hard yet we got to keep our Ebony Moris untouched.
---
Some of the buildings have been nerfed to uselessness with the closed off windows.  I just feel like they ignored us killers for a long time and now they're overcompensating by buffing our side too far.  I shouldn't be able to consistently 3 or 4k with Freddy at rank 1 lol. 
---
Just objectively I feel like a strong experienced killer will find that a lot of the challenge has been removed from the game for us.
---
I am so goddamn jelly
---
I also enjoy killer more, I'm just saying, good survivors don't rage quit or suicide.
---
Idk, I don’t watch twitch. You’d be better off just looking up how to run loops on YouTube

what the hell are you talking about? LOL
---
jesus christ how paranoid can you be, I was the Dwight in your lobby earlier when you were playing as Feng, I made fun of your name because white privilege doesn't exist, I don't know what personal issues you have bud but I have nothing to do with it
---
I agree! Plus that new weapon with a heart or brain (cant check right now) has to be the best one available yet. 
---
You're saying the first part like it's a bad thing. I rely on adrenaline as an alternative to healing all game, and only needing to be hit during a chase once has killed me on multiple occasions. 
---
That's the point of a risky perk, It has a good enough payout to make it worth running despite not working ideally most of the time and any nerf would change that.
---
And again if the killer gets a 4-man adrenaline proc, there was a whole game before that point where they weren't able to capitalize on opportunities to down. They created the bad endgame for themselves. For whatever reason (not you specifically), killers on this sub love to take the worst possible scenario of a survivor perk and frame it as commonplace. 
---
This is a like special episode of "Oh no I wanted to vault that window and entered a locker"
---
Happens way too often tbh. 
---
Whenever I play survivor and get camped I embrace it and just say to the other survivors, do gens let me die. I dont care to escape or not as long as everyone else does
---
I don't even enjoy killer more. I'm a surv main but I can't get good surv games anymore, so I've been forced out of playing surv. I don't think that's because survs are underpowered tho. I don't know what happened, but since this last patch, I cannot get good teammates, even in red ranks. 
---
Not true. The trophies for PSN state that you need a merciless victory (double pip) not a 4k
---
* This image link is either dead, deleted or broken. Please resubmit with a better link.
---
As a killer you want to finish chases quick.... You get more points the faster you end it.
---
Better than being a dirty weeb
---
What about Ghastly... jk yeah specters are always freakishly cool
---
Same. I don't understand people who rush into competitive matches with no preparation, often skipping tutorial...then complaining when they have a bad time. *surprised_pikachu.jpeg*

oh fuck me that would be hella funny
---
Wow still talking about skins, you must be a child. Kindly stop messaging me 
---
To be honest I forgot about the spirit tho my first idea for him was way to strong he was 115% movement speed alt was 140% speed could move and see thru walls and attack while in alt speed and was invisible and i forgot to put in the post was survivor's could see him while in blindness state now that i think about it this killer is probability under powered
---
Well, thanks. PS4 is now next to unplayable except on weekends. The game so dead that with old matchmaking it takes well over an hour to get a game of SWF. Fuck this 
---
NOED shouldn't be in the game, I agree, but ruin is needed on basically every killer except nurse. Rn gens are just insanely fast, flashlights just didnt really take much skill, rn a flashlight save is hard and should be.   
---
Survivors at rank 1 shouldn't be baby survivors.  
---
DS was too powerful.  
---
Moris are kinda bs, maybe they would be fair if you need to hook them twice for ebony's  
---
A lot of buildings were nerfed mainly cuz they were the strongest in the game and were being abused.  
---
And if your 3/4 K'ing at rank 1 with freddy, then your facing very bad survivors
---
You could 4k those ranks with a Claudette 
---
This is great!
---
Survivor-wise, David and Kate
---
Killer-wise - Spirit and Legion
---
Yeah, ranking system rn is kinda garbage.
---
Every rank is filled with babies and gods.
---
It only matters if you are next to it when they press to jump. Try grabbing them next time.
---
Killer: Nurse, Huntress, Wraith, Spirit
---
Survivor: Meg, Ace, Feng, Jane
---
you like to keep it simple huh? Kate is my fav too
---
His only looping weakness is windows, as his ability can destroy pallets very easily, and even then the Chainsaw's hurtbox can still smack people who fail to sprint-vault fast enough.
---
The mobility granted by his Sprint is truly absurd for a 115% killer, and being caught out against him will always result in an insta-down for any Billy worth his salt.
---
Might cost him an arm and a head
---
Mat black
---
They could probably go with fairly simple changes for general balance for console.  Better aim assist for killers to prevent rampant 360s, larger "Great" skill checks to help make ruin less gen preventing for survivors.
---
They could also implement the change to ruin that I've thought has been needed since the beginning of time, that it wouldn't have that stupid "can't work on gen for 2 seconds" after a good skill check.
---
Why is Trapper swole af though
---
Nea and Nea
---
Did you just... say something positive about the Legion?....
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Myers and Kate :3
---
Relevant flair lol. Can't decide whether I want to P3 Kate or Legion next.
---
Flair checks out. Can't decide whether to P3 Kate or Legion next tho.
---
Legion and Feng 
---
They try to assert their big dick energy but, it just end up being that small pp energy
---
I think this is the most accurate reddit post I've ever seen.
---
PUT THE RABBIT DOWN LENNY
---
Maybe I'll just play strictly SWF, that way I at least know my what my teammates are capable of lmao. 
---
For now though, it seems like killer is calling. At the time of patch I was rank 10 killer, already worked myself down to rank 2 with 2 pips.
---
you haven't been in my lobby cause i checked through people i played with and there were no steam of yours. 
---
"Whatcha gone do freddy??? Shoot me???"
---
*pop pop* 
---
"Holy shit, where did he get a gun!!??" 
---
Detective : *whistles* 
---
Yeah there’s no point in even trying to protect the hex if you’re not like spirit or billy or something along those lines like hag. I just rely on teams trying to gen rush as soon as they see it’s not ruin. And then I punish them when I get a quick 3 stacks
---
[https://i.imgur.com/wMz0xdn.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/wMz0xdn.jpg)
---
Man, console blinks are pure trash tho. I might have to just farm with Mikey and pump it into her levels, yeah. 
---
Are all of the 100% offerings broken? I lost 4 survivor puddings last night from using them and dcing when I tried to pick up the first person downed
---
kate because legion is kinda easy to grind up on
---
Killers so OP please nerf
---
It's probably because of chases. The last few killers have had pretty strong chase powers, and with bloodlust being what it is and maps having fewer safe pallets, if a killer really wants you, there's really no escape, even if they're not good.
---
On the flipside, however, gens are still done just as fast as ever, giving survivors a massive edge in the game overall.
---
Instead of trying to balance both chases and match length, BHVR has basically opted to give each side the edge in one.
---
it's still a 4k. I don't think they can change trophy requirements on PS4 no matter what.
---
Most of my adept killer trophies have literally just been 4ks, a few of them weren't merciless victories (usually due to someone dying on first hook or just being too potato to make the match a wash)
---
But I'm certain that the trophy requirement is literally just get all 4 kills, inversely I have gotten merciless victories but only a 3k and haven't gotten the trophy.
---
Sure, but less chases (instadown) means less points - so I am incentivized to not use my killer's power? I think that's dumb.
---
True. I do have a P3 David/Hillbilly/Huntress to grind points on tho. Probably will do Kate bc playing one survivor all the time can get boring
---
Imagine a game with 2 killers... you see a roaring leatherface in front of you and waiting behind you is a myers. 
---
Nah there is a few killers viable without it.  You can play  Billy, Spirit, Doctor, and maybe Pig to name a few aside from Nurse. 
---
When I was referring to high rank I meant the opposite rank 16, 18 etc... they can't repair through ruin for shit and you're going to see ruin 1 on everybody.

I agree DS needed a rework and I love the whole it punishes tunnelers aspect but they broke the perk by making it a 3 second stun.  It isn't long enough.  If the killer runs Enduring which is a meta perk on most killers you won't make it 9 feet before being renowned.  Regardless I think it was an equal crutch level to NOED so touching one without the other feels cheap.
---
I've been playing this game for over 2 years.  I'm rank 1 every month.  I always find it funny when people say you just don't play good survivors lol.  This is literally the only game I play I probably have a couple thousand hours in at this point.  I severely doubt I magically am the only person that doesn't face strong survivors lol.  I play sweaty ass swf's all the time.  I just make very intelligent decisions in game in relation to my chases and gen pressure.
---
Perfect, thank you! 
---
I disagree when 1-2someone on your team feeds a perma EW3 Tombstone Myers.
---
it definitely is in the right hands, but i still get way more frustrated against nurses with extra blink addons because at least with omegablink i don't feel like i only got hit because of crutch addons
---
Self Care, Lithe, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time.
---
or
---
And this build is just for distracting the killer, not too much for rescues :
---
Object of Obssession
---
Decisive Strike
---
Sprint Burst
---
Adrenaline.
---
Downvoted seven times for saying that apparently. 
---
Not to mention they both do a lot of jumping through windows
---
Should be tremendously increases the chance for the killer to DC at the start of the hunt.
---
That is WAY too much. Woof!
---
it was up until recently, now it's merciless killer
---
Exactly my thoughts - especially after vomiting on the gens, people just wait it out. Weirdly enough, Plague is not the best fit for her unique perks, including CI, but they're amazing for certain other killers, like Trapper.
---
Empathy Borrowed Time We’ll Make It Botany Knowledge. 
---
Stop biting your nails, alien hands
---
you can if the killer is bad. else you need mutible perks to pull it off plus the killer being dumb. you will not lose a good killer without perks just saying. 
---
I assume they're still viewable because one day they might change the offering. It's eaiser to make it not usable rather than remove them entirely.
---
Why would the Killer DC? Doesn't the Killer get bonus BP too?
---
Farm those sweet free points
---
Is it really caused by this perk? I thought it was some new hack or something. Do you have source on this?
---
If this was a commercial, i would buy whatever they are trying to sell.
---
i would hope a very situational perk like adrenaline is strong and can give a survivor a really huge advantage for living long enough for it to activate. it doesn’t even have a guaranteed chance of working since gen work is relied on other teammates and how effective/ineffective the killer is. i’m giving up a perk slot for something that MIGHT help me for 5 seconds.
---
in the past two months i have seen about one adrenaline user for every 3 days i’ve played. it’s nowhere near as meta as ds ever was because ds is a get out of jail free card as long as you hit the skill check which still was easy (survivor main btw).
---
adrenaline is perfectly fine the way it is.
---
I don't know how I felt about the new matchmaking, I guess I didn't have the sane experiences everyone else did. I definitely found games quicker, but it would constantly put me in bugged lobbies where a 4th survivor couldn't join, or lobbies with more than 200 ping. And I couldn't even find survivors when I tried playing killer, I waited almost 20 minutes for only one person to join my lobby, and then I just gave up. Maybe I was just unlucky, who knows?
---
And what was introduced to replace them?
---
People seem to ignore them.
---
I usually get into games after watching some sort of tutorial videos on them. 
---
For DbD for me it were the "Casefile" series by Bricky. I just get that itch to put this "newfound" (for me) knowledge into action.
---
Hex:Ruin, Brutal Strength, Enduring, Spirit Fury.
---
You can replace Ruin with Corrupt Intervention and Brutal Strenght with NOED or Surveillance.
---
They’re all still there, they just can’t be as abused
---
Corrupt Intervention seems tailor-made for him, but I haven't tried it yet. Might be better than Ruin, since it's more reliable, and helps with early game.
---
It's time to face the simple truth: depip is not a punishment. The game is actually rewarding smurfers. 
---
That watermark plus cornermark combo is the real cancer here
---
What does this shot look like without all the editing?
---
Lmao
---
Ah and what I said above was a j/k people you know the one about Michael touching himself 
---
Makes sense to me but at least we have variety, not just edgy and malicious wackos, now we have recreational wackos too *smile*
---
I don't get the pig.
---
*cough* head on *cough*
---
Since this update I think we've lost 95% of survivor games. I say we I mean me solo and other randoms. Often quite a heavy beating too. At most 2 people escape in just a handful of games.
---
Meanwhile when I play killer i've only struggled in one game, and that was with myers who i never use, with no good perks, and on a map that made it hard to stalk. Beyond that I've dominated the rest. If they're lucky they'll get 3 gens done, if not then only 2. Had a 4k with 5 gens remaining as freddy.
---
Killers shoukd have to put in effort for the 4k too. Right now I feel like killer is a breeze and solo survivor takes 1000 times more sweat and efforf.
---
Do none of the million people who've written this exact sentiment realize that a company can prioritize fixing its product, while at the same time allowing other teams that specialize in content creation work on new feature in the background? The issue is still priority. 
---
Any wildly out of context sentence you would like to share? :D
---
How about you just play the game and take what ever happens to you like a man
---

Thanks ^-^
---
You will if you're good.
---
Because this game is fucking gay
---
Nowhere close to Papa Myers though
---
My Trans friend said its because he hates himself
---
See above comment. I've explained my position. They don't exist in a vacuum, you have a chain of command in which people make teams and coordinate their efforts in theory. The individual teams aren't responsible for allocating their own budgets, you have lead designers and lead programmers and art designers and the producer who communicates between all of them, and that's where the teamwork comes in. I'm assuming, although I don't know for sure, that the director, who is supposed to be responsible for creating various compositions of the aforementioned teams by definition, deals with the people(whoever runs BHVR interactive) responsible for budgeting.
---
The TL;DR is this is bad management and it affects the final product. Bad management ruins everything , in every place that it persists. I'm not a game Dev, but I've done my homework, and to make an assertion like that after I've explained my position and have demonstrated that I understand what these positions do and the relationships between them makes you look pretty foolish. 
---
i feel like Alert is a severely underrated perk, it's really good in my opinion, maybe even too good but i don't want to give the devs ideas
---
If you have no option to damage the gen, then that means you already damaged it and it hasn't been touched since (sparks flying from it), or the progress of the gen is back to 0.
---
Hmm, Keep working on this gen or leave it to hide in an inconvenient locker... tough choice 
---
U right, but I had to go with standing there menacingly 
---
Aftercare is easily one of the most underrated perks. Also nobody runs kindred. 
---
On some maps I also think calm spirit is underrated. 
---
I’ve never really used that too often and it isn’t appearing in my bloodwebs either
---
The way I play her makes her more infuriating to play against than Legion, I love it.
---
I uninstalled it yesterday after I got teamed up with 3 rank 16s and against a rank 2 Hillbilly who slugged us all and stood on a hill waiting for us to bleed out. People can act like the rank changes didn't matter, but they turned the player base into a bunch of monsters. Someone pm me when this game goes back to being fun.
---
I feel like Bitter Murmur and Spirit Fury are pretty popular 
---
I really don't think nurse should be nerfed. She's already rare to encounter and they're usually not that great at her. The amount of skilled nurse players to decent nurse players is 1:10. The learning curve she already has is extremely high, and some parts of the map can't even be traversed by the Nurse unless they're using plaid flannel or they're god-tier, such as the stairs in the Macmillan map.
---
The Nurse was created to be a high-tier killer with many options. She was made to be able to keep the survivors on their toes and have incredible map control. But the skill required to use her to her full potential puts off many people who try her.
---
Nerfing her would punish the players who put many hours to days in the game to become viable with her. This could honestly be the same for Billy too. His chainsaw gives him amazing mobility and gives him amazing map control as well.
---
This is just my opinion, but the spite against Nurse and Billy is really uncalled for, because that's how they were designed to play. Amazing map control and killing potential.
---
ok buddy
---
Adrenaline already has the downsides of a) only being useful when injured b) Can only be used once c) is countered by insta downs d) If you are waiting for it to proc, you are vulnerable to getting one hit. Adding more conditions on top of getting gens completed is more than unfair when noed requires the killer to do absolutely nothing for it to activate.
---
i'm sorry, i'm dealing with a girl who's under protection of mods(a mod more like) here who literally started a witch hunt on me with her near 2k instagram followers who text me on there, minus karma my posts and comments here, harass me on dbd. of course i'm paranoid.
---
she lied and told these pussy lickers that i was harassing her and no one cares surely cause i don't play victim card unlike her. i have all the proofs but she won't get banned cause bitch is a cosplayer and attentionwhore so naturally has a bunch of white knights. i'm sorry, i don't want to show off my skinny butt and shove my face literally everywhere so horny guys would give me attention. 
---
Yea I appreciate your pick there \^\^
---
Perhaps a pic of Spongebob crossdressing or acting like a girl would fit Trapper as well :D
---
Stuff like this is why I love this game and community
---
Damn awesome!!!
---
If you do make it in game bloody party streamers increases your chances of being found first and camped to death. Yaaaaaay... I get 1k bp 
---
I don't get Freddy
---
Alert is very good. Especially for mind games during chases. 
---
You certainly have a stronger constitution than your peers, I'll give you that. As it turns out, *everyone* on the planet except you is insane. Conglaturation! 
---
Well make it, empathy, and detectives hunch on the survivor side.
---
Killer side I would say blood warden, surveillance, and I personally think iron maiden when ran with bbq. 
---
I have done the same and I ended up with 6 streamers so I also agree
---
But I can damage it multiple times in a row
---
I mean. As long as your have Botany Knowledge and know when to self care and when to let another survivor heal you it's still a fairly meta perk. It still lets you heal yourself while another survivor works on a gen.
---
Good lord. 
---
They've been doing that with a lot of killers perks lately. It seems like they kinda just use the new killers just to push out perks they already had planned instead of thinking of new ones that'd work well with the one they come with.
---
Better not go back down to investigate, that would make you a camper.
---
At the end of the day DBD is a casual game, you shouldn't care that much about pips. If people want to DC for whatever reason they can think of, let them be. Players usually disconnect whenever something unfun, according to them, is happening. 
---
Banning people for Disconnecting here and there would be incredibly stupid considering you don't actually win or lose anything by doing that.
---
People that disconnect ALL the time do get banned, eventually. 
---
to add to this, from a survivor's perspective, they can just do a quick interaction with the generator to keep it from regressing any more, then come back to it later. 
---
sometimes i'll do this to stall the killer more the next time they check the generator, while doing other tasks (rescues and whatnot)
---
Killer: kills

Survivor: fAgGoT aSsHoLe TrYhArD sWeAtY cOcKsUcKeR i DoN't WaNt To PlAy I cAn'T bUlLy ThIs KiLlEr! (DCs)
---

---
Exactly this. With that logic, unbreakable should be nerfed too.
---
Only in corrupt vile.
---
And you forgot the. Nurse and spirit 
---
I’m just wondering if their rarities will ever be updated to reflect their current stats
---
As a killer main I would rather farm 
---
I’m being tunneled and depiped at rank 13. This is fucking stupid. I’m about to delete it too. 
---
And think they were just justifying the continued release of DLC
---
I'm curious -- does bloodhound help you track blood at all or no?
---
Is this what she looks like on PC? 
---
Can you blame him?
---
Me too
---
***WOW.*** 
---
This guy must *really* hate the Plague. 
---
The Doctor, Huntress and Legion are fucking spot on.
---
Myers too, but I think we've all seen that before.
---
Fun fact: If the Killer is camping it means that the other 3 Survivors *should* be doing gens. Even with Ruin you can usually do 3 generators in the time it takes a Killer to camp someone from first hook all the way to sacrificed.
---
Also Borrowed Time exists. Take a hit, unhook with Borrowed Time, and either trade places to buy more time or have the Killer waste time chasing the BT Survivor.
---
I stand by my opinion that Michael could beat Jason in a fight.
---
Meg and the Trap Daddy
---
While buffs are a lot more fun it's a lot harder to buff than it is to nerf. Most of the killers who aren't viable need heavy tweaking or even full on reworking of various parts of their kit. (Pig as an example could use a rework of a lot of her weaker addons.)
---
And honestly Billy is overpowered. He's not insanely overpowered but he's above the power curve of the general game. The issue with Billy is that even without his power he's as effective as a default Killer, so the fact that he has *one of the best powers in the game* while also being a default Killer is a serious problem. The slogan I always say in regards to playing Billy is that "a noob playing Nurse will get slaughtered, but a noob playing Billy will do better than average."  
---
There is no reason that a Killer with a fast pallet break, instadown, and fast movement moves at 115% movement speed when a Killer who *only* has fast movement (Spirit) moves at 110%.
---
You could be not holding down the damage option the whole time and actually damaging it.  Make sure you hold that down all the way and not stop.
---
Thats an A-pose.
---
More like the exact opposite but w/e
---
Hey don't steal my line.
---
Also it's "legon bed giv mi 3 karma"
---
That fight ended with him decapitated though, lol.
---
You will get good as hell at looping and running the killer around then lol. I hate knowing you can't get caught or you are dead everytime, especially against Insta down killers.
---
also "newbies playing against daddy myers"
---
Red.
---
But also, congrats, I try to do this as well but I seem to just be less lucky. I can put them anywhere, even somewhere they should never be, and they get sabo-d.
---
It’s when spongebob was singing about the guys striped seater (and the striped sweater is something that makes Freddy iconic)
---
Oh wow, that's awesome! Thank you.
---
I'd say that's good to know, in the rare event of getting a killer that's not Billy.
---
I believe you, but I'm telling you I can often circle the gen damaging multiple sides, no survivors around. Maybe a glitch, idk
---
TO CLARIFY:  What I meant by this is killers should be able to choose which default dull totem is lit on the map to make it a hex totem. All totems spawn in the same spot as they would any other time. I was just suggesting that the killer should be able to choose which of them is actually a hex totem. Because I know that many maps have the hex totem spawn in the same spot every single time that specific map is played. 
---
Even more well known than "THIS... Is god!" ? 
---
Same
---
Hmm that's a possibility, maybe I'm letting go when the animation is done, but not the bar still isn't filled. 
---
Survivor adept achievement: hide in a locker all game and then leave through the gates.
---
Killer adept achievement: slaughter everyone and do it perfectly under a time limit to impress Entity-senpai.
---
I still think that the adept Killer achivements should be as long as you pip. Likewise with Survivor, because you can do fuck all and still get the cheevo as Survivor or do everything in the match and not get the cheevo.
---
No you see thats the problem, after running them around for 4 gens and running out of pallets, I go down and get face camped. and in Rank 15 killers don't know that they can, go for someone else other than the cheetah daddy.
---
&gt;Just you. Perk is fine. But you wont hear what im saying. You just want easy games.
---
Ruin doesn't make games harder, just boring. 
---
Myers, Meg
---
Sometimes they don't even remove posts that obviously break that rule. just look at the front page.
---
Shame the manga turned into such a *train wreck*
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems#Killer_Emblems
---
Yes. Because gens getting done in 4-6 mins is so much fun.
---
People remember Freddy more for "BITCH" and his comedic side than the actual scary parts, at least, the people *I* know. I would say that's a really good quote too, but it's better in context, since if an edgelord said that, it would make your skin fall off in disappointment...but even if an edgelord said "WELCOME TO PRIME TIME, BITCH" it would still be rather funny.
---
You Will NOT if the Miller has a Brain
---
This is the biggest issue that needs to be after imo. Not the ranking system, not lobbies, not rebalances, but decreasing the amount of DCs. 
---
Yo yo yo hold up, I’m a 99% survivor main who has just barely started playing killer like a week ago. I would never come from my killer perspective and say dumb shit like survivors op killer is too hard when I have literally no experience. As a survivor it’s dumb that we have this perk, that on the off chance it works, makes the end game pointless for killers. We are supposed to be escaping from evil, I want to be scared, I don’t want to feel in control cause that takes away from one of the primary aspects of the game. Do killers have perks and add ons that are too op? Definitely. But that doesn’t mean I want killers to be weaker, I just want them to be balanced with ways that make them stronger/more intimidating without them being able to take away from the survivor experience.
---
How much do the increased field of view perks actually give you? I rarely notice the difference.
---
anything is better than using dead memes from 2016
---
Rolled my eyes so fckn hard.
---
Holy shit this might be the stupidest thing I've ever read.
---
"Who cares if you only get two matches in an hour of waiting?  They were quality right?  What's that?  The killer d/ced in one and two of your teammates d/ced in the other?  Whelp..."
---
Ping and hitboxes are 2 separate things.
---
Can someone please explain what bps actually does im new
---
I thought most Spirits use Stridor?
---
It's too bad killers cant find and break the hatch, it would actually make it as powerful as NOED.
---
Wait, how do you decrease the distance between hooks without adding hooks? Are there just no hooks around the perimeter, they all get pulled inward?
---
I am going to semi answer all of your questions because 2/3 are opinion based. 
---
1) I am not 100% sure, but I would guess that the killer won't see your aura and you will burn a token (since it is any time the killer would see your aura). Best way to be certain is to just test it. 
---
2) A lot of this comes down to your preference really. I don't consider detective's hunch that good of a perk, because you can determine all of that information yourself without wasting a perk slot. If you're really just trying to sneak around the killer and do gens without being too altruistic, maybe mix in urban evasion and calm spirit.
---
3) In my opinion, self care is a crutch. Once you stop using it in favor of more useful perks, you'll probably never use it again. People probably call it selfish because you always see them doing self care while you're on the hook instead of saving you/doing gens/doing anything useful. Also, your teammates get points for healing you, so healing yourself could be seen as selfish I guess. I would say perks like Bond and Empathy are more selfish though (I always run empathy) because you can see where your teammates are and pass off the killer to them if you're being chased or completely avoid them if they're being chased. 
---
yeah She lmao
---
With all the bugs o wouldn’t doubt it lol. Just keep milking those bloodpoints while it lasts.
---
*Nani?*
---
I mean it will. There seems to be an issue with the matchmaking currently, but the ranking seems to be going in the right direction.
---
Yea... you're right. 🤔
---
i play on console but i dont know if you thought it was fast but it wasn't as fun or fast considering i was facing rank 15s and i was rank 8, trust me, it wasn't.

---
That's definitely Jane's butty
---
Where's the fun in being demolished by a killer or a team of survivors ?
---
this is really cool
---
Ugh fuck that I'd rather just play for fun I preferred the old system :/ 
---
The way Myers lets the girl hug him is so cute I almost cried
---
In drag you refer to the persona they're playing as "she."
---
But that sounds like a waste if the cap isn't raised
---
Yeah I knocked out both rank 1 achievements right before the update so now I mostly do no-kill farming games on Huntress with nothing but BP perks and Ruin and walk away with 60k at a time lol
---
Either Billy or Trapper, and Bill or Kate. I just wish I had better perks for Bill
---
That’s a better approach. I usually don’t bring it because it’s so rare that I get paired against a doc, and when I do, I migrate to the exact opposite of the map of him lol 
---
I actually like this map, for some reason. I guess because it's just so different from most of the others.
---
Yeah, I don't think that's what the guy was saying though, that's my point
---
When are the flapper styled outfits coming out for Meg and Claudette? I wish I could find this info easier 
---
[Actual evidence from a knowledgeable source aka the developers. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/qbMgxin) 
---
Well yes but who more then doc? 
---
actually, if you are rank 1 with this new ranking system then you are REALLY good considering how much you have to do to get there.
---
This can't be a cosplay, it's way too perfect.
---
I've gotta disagree. I've been able to run killers around for ages, even at rank 4 against billies and nurses. I only usually run balanced landing if I'm running any exhaustion perks at all, and can still bullt killers if I play right. If you go down within the first 5 minutes of a game, it's more your fault than the games.
---
Thats why you herd them to where traps are
---
Distortion can literally erase all traces of aura reading Perks the killer has for 10 seconds. Wasteful how? 
---
Mood, that’s a good way to use it too lol 
---
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Ever since you first posted that, I’ve been running it into the ground as much as people run the overall joke into the ground. 
---
the plag
---
Or just make a rank system that actually determines skill. Instead of the broken shopping list system we currently have.
---
I'm ready to be down voted to hell for this, but consider the Legion if blood points and moderate fun are your priorities.
---
Since each hit with feral frenzy gives blood points, you can build up mad bp without having to actually kill people,  just find one person, smack them with feral, see if anyone else is nearby and hit them too.
---
Of course if you don't have the cannibal get him first since bbq and chilli is basically free double bp with an aura reading perk built in
---
Bloody Party Streamers increases blood point gains of ALL players (all 4 survivors AND the killer) by 100%. Multiple instances of Bloody Party Streamers can be offered at one time, so it becomes possible to snag around 130k blood points in a single trial.

Matchmaking is absolutely fucked up. When you’re an old rank 1 matching up with an old Rank 13, playing against a rank 1 killer, you’re not going to be having fun. Of course the killer is going to mop up in games like that. Every game, you’re essentially down some players due this matchmaking. Regardless of rank, any killer can seem dominant when they’re essentially playing against one or two survivors. 
---
On the other side, there’s games of new killers getting matched up against much superior survivors and are getting shit on. If you’re one of these survivors, usually this won’t even register in your memory. The match is done in five minutes, you barely saw a killer, and you didn’t get any points. The poor killer made it that popping was impossible and you just barely safety pipped. It’s not memorable because it feels like it didn’t happen. 
---

3 It's ok to run SC when you play solo, because your teammates aren't reliable at all, but please don't Self Care through Sloppy Butcher against a Legion.
---
If a killer gets blinded it’s 100% on them, flashlights are stupid easy to counter 
---
Ok so I play both killer and survivor and I've been reading all these comments and u guys make a lot of good points like..
---
-Just hunt for totems
---
-Its boring
---
-Ppl just want easy killer/survivor games
---
-It comes in handy for the less fortunate killers
---
-makes the game a little harsh for casual      survivors.
---
All these are good points but I'd also like to add the fact that when u queue as a solo survivor there's alot of times where the randoms like to gen tap or just power through the ruin and don't help u look for it. There's also the fact that SOMETIMES not all the time that no matter how hard u try the ruin is just hidden too well and ur team can't find it, can't really help that. And to top both of those off sometimes the killer is a good killer and kills half or over half the team before they can find the totem. Personally I think it should've just stayed the way it was with tier one being for 2 survivors, tier 2 being for 3 and so on. I feel like that was satisfactory and was well balanced. And like someone else said, killers that run the new Gen protector perk with Ruin and sloppy Butcher, if it was back the way it was before the patch it wouldn't be AS bad. I understand that some killers need Ruin but then again A LOT of killers don't and I understand that ruin slows down the game but killers that can easily get 4ks even without ruin def didn't need Ruin buffed the way it is now. Now this is just my opinion so don't hit me with hate lol.

The problem gets worse, the acceleration when deranking is much higher than ranking, so with sufficient DC activity, everyone starts crowding the 12-15 ranks.

No this is just a render. It would be really nice if she had this hair though
---
I wouldn't say that's hypocritical. Hex Ruin can completely undo all of the progress on the gen if some rando runs up and can't hit hex skill checks. Slowing down generators would still have the progress move in only one direction. 
---
Yeah, totem targeting is such a chore when you have to do it at the start of every game. 
---
Imagine complaining about keys, which almost no one uses and are useless unless you’re in a swf. He didn’t mention killer nerfs or balancing because there hasn’t been any. It’s been literally ages since killer was nerfed in any way while survivor has been nerfed basically every patch
---
Anyone ever notice that the basement looks and sounds like the attic in the original movie? Even the way the light shines through the walls. =) 
---
0 is too high for me.. were different i guess
---
Here's a solution; make certain killers not an absolute unfun bitch to play against. Looking at you, Freddy, Legion and Hag.
---
At the end of the day my time is more valuable than your perceived right to have a 'good game'. If I'm not having fun, or predict I won't be having fun due to mentioned shit killers, I am leaving. Simple as that. That is not my fault, that is the developer's fault for not creating fun and engaging game play at every stage of the game.
---
Im a survivor main, i agree that its op. But cmon.. after 500 hours you should know all the totem spawns, pretty easy to find except for on pale rose
---
Can't deny that; some are just inherently better than others.
---
Yeah ignore Amanda
---
Totally agree with everything you said. 
---
I stole your format 
---
Were gonna live forever, its a David King perk
---
Get in line fred boi 😤
---
Then.. i might actually give it a try
---
That's because getting a 'Merciless Victory' in the past, ment you had killed or sacrifice all Survivors.
---
I promise you can still get Adept Killer Trophy's but just Killing or Sacrificing all Survivors.
---
Yes, yes... We have such sights to show him...
---
If you're playing a killer like the doctor, should you continue following someone in a loop, or break off and go to a generator?
---
Since some killers are so easily loopable, I have a hard time figuring out when to continue the loop and when to give up the chase. My solution so far has been to play the nurse
---
If the generator isn't sparking, you haven't finished kicking it
---
Well, I'm not gonna say I don't agree. 
---
If there was a survivor perk that countered Hex Ruin, then it would discourage the overuse of Hex Ruin off the chance that you MIGHT run into a survivor that's running the countering perk. Just like how Unbreakable discourages slugging, and the new DC discourages tunneling. 
---
Np 
---
What's in the box? What's in the box!??
---
Fuck. Wrong movie. Lol.
---
Its a fucking game, not a tough boy competition, im here to have fun, not endure pain
---
Which does literally nothing if they have ears because you won’t be able to juke them 
---
Butt dancing and progress, butt dancing and progress--

(Simple mindgame)

OMG DIRTY HACKER I'M REPORTING U
---
You have a point
---
What is teabaging ?
---
"But I burned streamers and everything!!!"
---
I just received your postcard! I love it! Thanks so much!!
---
Yeah? It's always been like that
---
Fam but those green reduced cooldown add-ons are so epic on him
---
All of those are great, but Caterpillar TV Robert Englund "WELCOME TO PRIME TIME, BITCH!", a line that can only be delivered properly in screaming fashion, and is completely a Freddy moment, is beautiful. Think about people who aren't fans of the series...they will likely recognize that quote better than others, due to the hamminess of it. All the ones you mentioned were pretty good as well, and Freddy v. Jason has some glorious ones, too.
---
Overcharge and Huntress Lullaby. Both work at any level. But then again I play on console.
---
Very unlikely. They wouldn't create perk art and quotes from a licensed product as just a test. They would be getting sued out the ass right about now if they didn't have a deal with the Evil Dead rights holders to add him.
---
What book is this?! I remember this but not what it was called. 
---
It is because you can hide in a closet. It gives us outed people a sense of security. 
---
He's already munching 
---
Nope, but I believe you still get the decreased terror radius.
---
Frog and toad. It was one I remember from childhood lol
---
Every time I try this they're running Overcharge lol.
---
 These both are me, to the left is patch 1.3.1 "OLD" claudette. To the right is me in patch 2.4 "NEW" claudette. Can we all agree that the Claudette to the left looks WAY better than the one on the right, and can we try to make the devs change her back to the old Claudette? ty :) 
---
Thank you I would have gone mad not remembering
---
Boo I wanted an FOV big enough so I could chase survivors backwards with legion.
---
huntress xD
---
only speed boost. 
---
side note: 
---
If you have to mend and say adrenaline kicks in, the mend bar will go away but will still be injured 
---
And this here is the major flaw to the “just do gens” defense. If you do gens as quickly as possible to punish the camper, you end up with NOED. When you come here to complain about NOED, the same people tell you “just cleanse the totems”. Uhhhh.....ok?!
---
This is why NOED should only result in previously hooked survivors becoming exposed. 
---
That was the intent ;)
---
eat shit nerd
---
buff Detective's Hunch to last 30 seconds or make it so Small Game shows totem auras again or at least hows how many there are left and i will cleanse the shit out of those totems
---
Hey at least we dont have the bugs pc does
---
I feel great playing the Breakfast Club 
---
Not really what I was going for... I suppose I could have omitted that and received half the downvotes. 
---
I was wondering what is considered OP because I don't really have a notion of what's considered criminally overpowered. If I find something that consistently gets good results, I'll run it without any consideration for community backlash. I develop all of my builds and my opinions independent of this community for the most part but like to feed them back in for constructive criticism. 
---
[Rich Evans laughing for 12 aeons]
---
uh if you think it’s the same now that answers my question....you are unaware.
---
Or maybe just don't make it so totems can spawn right next to gens in the first place lol. Oh, BHVR
---
YESSSSS
---
True. 
---
Is it really necessary? 
---
The problem is now on swf can get to rank 1. It is impossible to pip at red ranks as a solo survivor because you can't communicate with your team and it is a "free for all" situation at red ranks. You can't do 2 whole gens and open an exit gate while getting at least 2 saves as well as not being downed the entire match. Guess what you don't get to pip. A survivor DC's you don't get to pip. You get tunnelled you don't get to pip. The survivors gen rush you don't get to pip. I get that pipping needed to be made harder that is fine, however instead of making it harder they made it impossible unless you can communicate with your team mates "I need that unhook or I am gunna depip" or "can we slow down the gens a bit or I won't pip". It is a ridiculous situation at high ranks. I have 1500 hours in game and have sat at red ranks consistently as a survivor (and killer but I am talking about survivor side here I think killer pips are fine)  for at least 6 months but now I am being put against rank 5 killers because I depipped so much from killers at red ranks camping if they got looped. Did I mention if the killer is shit you depip and if the killer camps you depip.
---
I got perm banned a long time ago because I told my story of how I wasn't ever compensated for the loss of progress bug from a couple years ago, they dm'd me to stop spamming even though I had told the story once, then They banned me.  I did get my compensation tho.
---
I main killer, have since release. Hitboxes have made vaults inconsistent, most maps spawn with like 2 safe pallets, if you get flashlight blinded anywhere that’s not a vault you just played bad. 
---
Anything that’s not a 4 man is easy as fuck to 3k on most killers, and nurse and billy will brutalize even swf groups 
---
This was so detailed I had to re-read it multiple times and still ended up with a mind f*ck each time 😂😂
---
Gonna have to need to see that video, son. 
---
Wait, don’t BPS give double BP for *all* and not just survivors??
---
\[T]/
---
&gt;1) I would like to know who I can watch to see or if the best if TrU3 isn’t.

It doesn’t work for Killer and Survivor. This happened to me twice yesterday. I believe it’s like a safety measure to keep people from deranking unfairly. Twice as a survivor the Killer left and in the after match stats it said I deranked. But when you go to the menu you actually don’t. If you disconnect as a Killer you lose pips no matter what. It has nothing to do with restarting the game. It only matters who dc’d from who and the innocent one maintains rank.
---
Seriously? Working through Ruin isn't hard. From a killer pov this is much salt for no reason. Didn't last Patch literally say a minimum of 8 pallets on every map? When I play survivor it is very easy and I suck at chases. 
---

---
Oh I absolutely love her design, but it still creeps me the fuck out.
---
What if the killer could curse a totem, so a ruin totem doesnt activate at the start of a match where anyone could find it. The killer curses a totem to activate the perk, if they’re running multiple hexs it random, but the killer knows where each hex is and which totem has which effects. 
---
Dunno man. Trapper always looked like the biggest killer. Even some of his perks and cosmetics refer to it. 
---
Nea and Kate are good too. Probably Jeff as well. 
---
The only snowflake I see here is you
---
Im on US East as well
---
You're acting like camping was a bad choice in this situation. There was literally only one guy in your whole team doing gens.
---
Resilience, and whispers
---
No... You can't get more than 8000 points from doing things in the match. The cap on a single match from doing objectives is 32,000 (8000x4).
---
But you can multiply that 32k by adding stuff like bloody streamers and other perks that multiply your score.
---
correct. so the killer was fucking over extra blood points not only for the survivors but also themselves.
---
Yeah. But if the Killer didn’t use any then it’s of no loss to him if he had a bad day and feels like being a dick for no reason.
---
Honestly, a little knowledge about how Myers plays is sometimes more dangerous than no knowledge at all.
---
I watched a lot of Twitch streamers playing at red ranks when I first started playing, so I was starting to get familiar with the different meta builds and add ons for various killers. Cut to me loading into Crotus Penn at rank 17 (and thinking I’m hot shit) as survivor. I see the killer - Myers - right away, but he doesn’t see me, so I keep my head down and work on gens. One, two, three gens pop and I have yet to hear Myers tier up. At this point I turn to my girlfriend, who’s watching me play, and confidently proclaim, “Man, this guy got screwed. Perma tier one Myers on the Asylum. Why wouldn’t he play a map offering if he’s running a map-dependent build like that? Probably doesn’t even know what his add-ons do, poor guy.” 
---
I mosey on over towards the next generator, stopping to see if there’s a chest at the top of the hill, when suddenly I see Myers creeping on me from across the open area. He looks like he’s not sure if he’s going to chase me or not, so I start acting like I’m going to jump down from the hill to see what he’ll do. I’m not afraid of this man. “Hey Myers,” I say. “What’re you gonna do about it, Myers? What are you and your slow-ass permanent 105% movespeed gonna do about-“
---
*DAH DAH-DAH DAH DAH-DAH DUH*
---
Poor baby Myers finally tiers up and comes right for my ass. I scream. My girlfriend loses her shit laughing. I completely fail at looping, go down like a sack of potatoes, and die in one hook.
---
So yeah. Don’t taunt the baby Myers. It’s just tacky.
---
god dammit
---
As a laughs when he hits survivors for extra toxicness player i arppove of this
---
Not anymore. I got a 4k with Plague and I didn't get it. All were 3 hooks, too.
---
But that's just one idea, but more than just being able to change the colour would be great 
---
I thought her behind got stuck on the way out.
---
It punishes Myers like this as well, I've had many games with bronze chaser just because I would find someone and instantly pop t3 to 1 hit them. Billy can have the same thing happen as well, just seems stupid to be punished for using your power properly. 
---
Dont forget that fun is hella subjective, Im planning on buying the Doctor as soon as I can as he looks so fun to me. Ranking barely matters if you master your character
---
They don't stack though during double BP events, at least not in a beneficial way, as far as I am aware. They just add onto each other so you get 3x instead of 4x the BP. 
---
I just forget about pips and have fun. The base game is still fun even though the ranking system is a mess right now. Focus on the objectives you can do that will help you to rank up if you really want to. You have to play the game a little differently to achieve pips now though. If you're playing survivor, always go for unhooks. Get at least 2 gens done. Get chased by the killer at least once and you should be good. 
---
Killers need to be ruthless. No more "Oh, I already hooked him.. I'll give him a break". If a survivor is dumb enough to stick around after an unhook, they are dying. I'm not saying you should camp or purposefully tunnel, but be ruthless. Play like a damn killer if you want to rank up.
---
Or just have fun and not worry about rank ;\]
---
i know. but im saying this specific hairstyle looks a lot like nea’s half shaven. looks a bit weird. 
---
Honestly i just LOVE when chainsaw operating dinguses and/or michael myers run NOED its not like they dont already have the means to oneshot down you to begin with UUUUUUWUUUUUU. 
---
That's past few months. It's after the patch where it's every game because like NOED, it's now strong at ranks 1 &amp; 2.
---
some devs can generate these codes (I believe) and some people just saved theirs from the original events and sold them forward. I got my Street Meg &amp; Science Fair Claud from a giveaway. 
---
Also you cant get Dweard without a code. 
---
Knockout and Hope
---
Myers has to earn his instadown at least ,Billy doesn't.
---
"MoSt BaLaNcEd KiLlEr" they say. yeah right thats why everyone is using him.
---
Were gonna be young forever, self pleasure, Dead hard and we'll make it legal. Im not 100% sure about it though. 
---
This is a polite way to make the same point others below have been rude about. My dad always said there's a right and a wrong way to say anything. Good job, fellow human. I agree with you.. would love to see the unedited photo.
---
It depends on the loop. If its a strong one try to mindgame and make them drop the pallet. Its important not to take too much time in a chase as it reduces your map pressure to 0, but if you can end it quickly then do it
---
How did you finish typing that and then click "save" as if it was a legitimate response to OP? LOL the mental gymnastics you went through to even make it sound remotely *okay* is ridiculous. 
---
My dad (Hillbilly) says so. 
---
This has nothing to do with wanting to rank up. This last patch has brought light to so many toxic plays. Killers are breaking chase to down someone who just got unhooked. This game isn’t fun. I play objectively, they tunnel. I hit them with one pallet, they hunt me down for the entire game. 
---
This mentality of “killers need to be ruthless” is bullshit and promotes unfair and very unentertaining games. It’s the most boring shit when you have to run around for 5 gens just to get smacked with noed. 
---
And the ranking system definitely is one of the many causes of this. 
---
Even my good games aren’t even fun. I deleted it jut a little while ago. Let me know when it’s fun again. 
---
Survivors: Jane and Nea. I love Nea's outfits and punk aesthetic, but damn Jane's thiccness and laughable totem cleansing noises are just 10/10 memes.
---
Killers: Hag and Plague. Hag has my favorite playstyle of all the killers as well as the coolest Mori imo. Plague is hands down my favorite designed killer though. A vomit priestess?! Sign me up! I remember making a Death Godlike Priestess in my first Pillars of Eternity run and the Plague's reveal seemed like she was made for me. 
---
There obviously is a reason people play hillybilly, spirit, huntress over every other killer. Considering that killers like pig, trapper, leatherface, power tier killers in general are a lot easier to bully than stronger killers. It’s not fun to get shit on so people will pick stronger killers. Angry ranting and “git gud” doesn’t change that a killer who can sprint two the other side of the map and instadown you is objectively better than pig who’s traps sometimes do nothing to help you and whose crouch that only helps at a few loops and sometimes gets you a free hit.
---
Hilarious 
---
I've been thinking about this for a while. I'm interested in hearing what everyone thinks about competitive balance in dbd :)
---
Who doesn't?
---
Imagine if Ford consistently released new cars with cool contours and fancy paint jobs but the brakes and power steering didn't work. 
---
This is helpful, but what I'd like to know is how luck affects hook escapes specifically. If you have that data then I'd be very thankful &lt;3
---
Totems, totems everywhere. 
---
Either than that just the meta. B+C, Ruin, Nurses, and Corrupt Intervention.
---
No 90% open sideboob, not the plague.
---
It's amazing to me that this needs to even be said. 
---
We trade in the Freddy DLC for another DLC of our choosing and get a legion rework. Win-win!
---
That’s actually a good farming strat... might have to try that sometime
---
I really do hope that you aren't meaning this as an insult love...🙃
---
Dafuq has happened? I haven't noticed a diffrence on PC
---
Loved this m8
---
Couple days ago I was rank 16 as survivor. I dc out of a game cuz I was being yelled at to do something IRL and was rank 12 after I dc. It was not just a visual bug, I was still rank 12 later too. I’ve also lost rank on a double pip. Dunno wtf is going on anymore. 
---
Not to face
---
Ruin is a crutch? Lmfao. Im sure you have dead hard, adrenaline, self care and deliverance. Maybe pack an instaheal for lunch? Killers can chase 4 people at once and ruin provides enough time to have a decent start to the game. But as ive said before, you wont hear what im saying because thats just the way the community is. 
---
I hate that this game consistently freezes and crashes. What's up with that? 
---
I feel like Hope doesn’t make much of a difference opposed to Adrenaline tbh
---
luck directly increases the base chance to escape, base chance is 4%, each offering will increase by a set %.
---
ex. Playing 1 Vigo's jar of salty lips (3%) will increase the chance to escape the hook to 7%
---
ex2. using 2 Black Salt Statuettes (2% each, 4% total) will increase the chance to escape the hook to 8%.
---
You can check all of the numbers at

---
Nope, just memeing :)
---
Thank you very much! I'll just get into a SWF and everyone yeets off hook
---
We’ll Make It is def underrated. Using it a so helpful lol
---
The fact that SWF is a thing automatically makes the game more than a little unbalanced, seriously, having 4 potatoes that are on comms can take down the average killer. This is doubly compounded by the matchmaking being wack. DS is interesting until everyone runs it, and you can't pick up a person, assuming you can even find one when four people are on comms constantly telegraphing your location.
---
all playing survivor as a killer main shows is how entitled they get IMO. 
---
Huntress for the rare times I'm on killer
---
Ace for my survior
---
how the fuck
---
New mori confirmed
---
Killer main unpopular(?) opinion: I think killers are incredibly OP right now
---
Do you know what -phobia means? Because it means “an irrational fear or (in this case) dislike of”. No one is being transphobic. Maybe misinformed. 
---
People already dodge now based on trophies, lack of cosmetics/prestige etc
---
A new account? Again? Welp, time to go hunting people!
---
We are talking base billy no, insta saw is a while different deal and even then, i barely play surv once i get them to rank 1 but even i can 360/dodge the saw
---
Nothing
---
Shape vs Huntress, who is better ?
---
I say my Russian girl beat Michael in every way possible, but I want your opinions as well.
---
Depends on the Hex. If it's a Hex like Devour, then I wouldn't put it in that much of a hard spot to find. 
---
You'll never find Ruin though.
---
Not only long loading screens but glitches too. I loaded into a match on survivor and the wiggle option wouldn't go away....
---
Ranking up has gotten easier (until this last patch) so rank doesn’t matter. 
---
Rank 1’s don’t play like rank 1’s since everyone can get rank 1. 
---
... what about it?
---
What rank do you play at? 😆
---
he said he wants to taste his dick... don't think it's dislike.
---
Just to be a dick, they lose nothing as they didn’t offer any of them. Most killers are great, but you sometimes get those just straight up asshole killers who take joy in screwing over the other players.
---
Reds respectively for both when I’m not dicking around. I spend more time being a nice killer at mid ranks because I have empathy towards survivors who don’t get good games. But pretty typical you went from saying ruin was too strong for you and ur swf to deal with because it was a “chore” then tried to bring my rank into it.
---
“I guess you get shit survivors,” 
---
Why is it that no one can come up with a genuine argument and instead says this. It’s rather pathetic honestly. 
---
If you get 3-4 kills you are winning, I’m lost as to what the issue is. 
---
You tubers aren’t always that great. Some of the most prominent youtubers are mediocre or just above average at killer. Tru3 and monto are prime examples here yet they both don’t run ruin most matches and perform fine. You kinda disproved your own point.
---
With ruin people do the same thing, ruin merely prolongs the inevitable.  
---
Close Encounters of the Third Kind chapter leaked

---
if a killer is downing a survivor within 15-20 seconds of spotting them, they're either bad, or the killer is nurse/iri-head huntress/instasaw billy.
---
the only survivor nerfs from the past 2 years that bother me were shoving flashlights into their grave with pickup time changes, and healing timer nerfs - they should just make it so flashlights blind something like 0.5 seconds faster, so its still fast paced mindgaming - right now killer can 180 pick up a survivor and be safe of a blind because FL is too slow at blinding to counter it. making the FL blind faster means that theres more of a timeframe for a blind, whilst also keeping the counterplay for killer if he manages to pickup someone in an unpredictable manner.
---
something that made me chuckle though is BHVRs irony in balancing addons - they removed instablind flashlights because the timeframe of counterplay is "excruciatingly low", yet shit like instasaw billy is still in the game
---
I’ve always wanted to attempt this, it would be fun
---
That'll be dope af
---
I know using a tombstone piece on Myers takes you out of Tier 3 but does using the headstone also do the same? 
---
Actually, I was inquiring what level survivor your frame of reference is at. 
---
How typical of you to get prematurely aggro...

I hate it lmao
---
Being pleased\*
---
Its fun for the killer mains. Dont worry, they're still on the dbd forums oestering devs to nerf self-care even further.
---
This is what I do when I inevitably fail to kill the survivors. Moonwalk and all the the Toxicity just disappears
---
Small Game, makes finding Ruin and NOED way easier, especially now that totems can spawn in some ridiculous places. Also handy in the odd Trapper encounter.
---
He responded with a perfectly logical comment. Not to mention nearly every reply of yours on this thread is you being a jackass with nothing to add, hypocrite. 
---
Not gonna deny that.
---
What is that original picture from? (for scientific research)
---
Or Nea
---
i know
---
The nerf was unnecessary and was a bad move. She had potential to be top tier, now she’s low B/high C at best. 
---
He has "cunt" in his name for a reason.
---
Shhhhhmok

shmok shmok shmok
---
Indeed
---
Seems like something i would do if I ever used yellow moris 
---
Why? It has saved me a number of times when I'm in a chase and couldn't look to see where the gates spawned.
---
I would have thought that the 9% increase of Resilience would be better in general
---
Legit didn’t even know you could do that lmao that’s terrible 
---
I don’t think the perk is overpowered, just incredibly unfun to play against. The whole m1 simulator is starting to reach a point where I don’t wanna play the game almost ever and when I do I just want to be chased. I don’t think that’s how the game should be. 
---
First, they Bing Bong
---
Then, the Bing Bang
---
I just think there's so many better perks you could take in it's place. It take less than a second to look around and remember the direction the gates are in.
---
After all this time we have finally found the most toxic item in the game. 
---
A yellow mori.
---
Then they Bing Bong Bang
---
Happened to me once but we went around and did all the totems so all I got was a jump scare lol
---
Idk without seeing its hard to say, i know when i have shown other trappers how to place they thought they were being clever but were going for obvious spots
---
Who would have known?
---
You got whoosed so hard I thought you were being sarcastic. I've been whoosed by your whoosed.
---
Who wants to play against a doctor 5 times in a row? Not me. 
---
Why?
---
*Trapper wants to know your location*
---
Clown is jealous
---
Thats not a great analogy. A car without brakes or power steering is essentially a useless box of metal. Are you seriously saying that the patches bhvr pushes are anywhere near that bad? They have flaws and bugs that impede gameplay, but it's more along the lines of the speedometer not showing the correct speed or the car requiring multiple attempts to start. They simply don't have have the manpower to pump out dlc at the rate they do and also keep up to date with bug checking/fixing. And believe it or not, but the rate they put out dlc at allows them continue creating content. I'd rather have new content and some bugs than a dead game with no new content.
---
Very true.
---
Slugging for the 4k is such a waste of time . 
---
Did you fry your tv?
---
Just started playing SWF with a few friends after being a killer main, and by killer main I mean I only have maybe 50 hours into killer back when I was playing last oct.
---
Holy shit it really does feel like survivors have nothing if they're dealing with a semi-competent killer now. 
---
They seem to cover ground so fast now that even running around in a jungle gym, eventually their bloodlust speed will catch up with you regardless. 
---
There is a hook what feels like roughly every 10 meters. Even if I sabotage one, and get downed near it, killer still manages to get me to the next one. Even with tier 1 boil over. 
---
Killers speed feels way too fast. I get it they need to end chases because if a killer doesn't map pressure almost constantly, survivors will be knocking out all gens in roughly 3-5 minutes. Even with ruin. Which feels like if you're not rolling with that hex, you're playing to lose. 
---
which kind of sucks when I am a low rank low level killer and I dont have all the perks unlocked. I essentially need to burn rare or ultra rare addons to have a chance at survivors that know what they are doing, especially if they're SWF. I think that's sort of what it feels like with the "low tier" killers, they need to have some addons baselined into their ability if we want to see people not just run the same top tier killers everytime. 
---
I have mix feelings overall. I just did huntress daily and only hooked one person who died on second hook and it was on junkyard map in a terrible U shap formation that I wasn't sure how I was going to win because huntress is slow and I have so much ground to cover. 
---
Nurse's Calling and Sloppy Butcher are not recomemded for Legion, people tend to not heal much against him. You should use on Legion : Barbecue and Chili, Ruin, Discordance/Surveillance and Monitor and Abuse.

On Huntress, Make Your Choice and Monitor and Abuse are useless, you should use on her : Ruin, A Nurse's Calling, Barbecue and Chili/Deerstalker, Bitter Murmur/Whispers/Iron Maiden.
---
Builds for Spirit :
---
Regular build : Ruin, Barbecue and Chili, A Nurse's Calling/Spies From The Shadows/Rancor, Sloppy Butcher/Make Your Choice.
---
Gen protector Spirit : Ruin, Surveillance, Discordance, Barbecue and Chili/Monitor and Abuse ( but just if you use Prayer Beads, never use Monitor and Abuse on Spirit without Prayer Beads add-on )
---
Sluggling Spirit : A Nurse's Calling, Deerstalker, Sloppy Butcher, Hex:The Third Seal/Knock Out 
---
Toxic Spirit : Hex:Devour Hope, Hex:Haunted Ground, Make Your Choice, NOED.
---
Adrenaline and Hope are completely different when used. 
---
I wasn’t even intending the play if you could tell by me first running the other way, I wanted to grab his attention so I could make a locker play lol
---
Because they don't own the rights to Freddy Kruger, and would have to get permission from the right owners, which involves paying money and signing a contract to use specific designs.
---
Also it can take a while to get licensed content due to legal reasons. 
---
Ru ru ru the chainsaw and preform probably the most boring Mori in the game
---
Obviously Daddy Myers, duh.
---
The two that I mentioned don’t run it the majority of the time. 
---
P.S. Almost every popular DBD Youtuber streams as well so we can watch all of their matches.
---
i've been on the internet enough to know what happens.
---
Software developers and programmers make upwards of $100k a year, so hiring any significant amount of developers would likely greatly cut their profits.
---
Honestly haven't seen anymore often than before. Even old tier 1 ruin could slow the game down. It's definitely stronger but I think most killers who have it, use it, regardless of tier. Before and after the change. 46.7% usage though is still absurdly high and honestly it's not a fun perk to play against.
---
You tried. 
---
Duh. But, that doesn’t infect anything and it’s easy to miss with it.
---
You sure did a thing
---
But they have Freddy in the game
---
I think it adds a extra bit of objectives. Just doing gens and unhooking people is only two things to do everytime. Im not bored of hex hunting. I have to look all over to try and find it and i get very satisfied if i do. 
---
Let me tuch ass
---
I'd rather play the game than wait 40 mins for the killer to Dc. 
---
Like I said, when I'm in a chase. It's kind of hard to look around for a second.
---
Not really. I didn’t even say it should. All said is that IF the perk is nerfed again, then a timer decrease is the only thing I COULD see happening. 
---
Gotta tweak Small Game to not reveal trap auras then too. Because that kinda fucks poor Trapper over.
---
i prefer ping than hitboxes and you ?
---
Even if everyone plays vigo thats only 16% chance to get off the hook. 
---
If you have broken status, you get the speed boost from Adrenaline, but not the heal. And you aren't healed after broken status runs up.
---
Oh yes, that's what I've been doing with him as well! I absolutely wasn't trying my little ass off, while all survivors escape anyway!
---
No but seriously, I'll try this out. Less stress about trying to 4k with a mediocre killer.
---
The two of them, while being good killers and better than most, are not on the same level as some of the best players like ZubatLel and Ardetha (specifically killer gameplay). Neither Tru3 nor Monto run ruin in the majority of their matches. If you watch them stream frequently it becomes pretty clear. 
---
Which one of the two did you disagree with lol
---
I can go further into detail if needed I’m just not sure where. 
---
I’d rather use insidious with NOED and warp through an exit gate as nurse to sp00k a survivor but that’s pretty funny too
---
bubba see potate
---
bubba no understand why potate no like insidious
---
bubba will go make chilli
---
I Haven't experienced this but if it's true you can't derank I'd be shocked
---
Yeah but they don't *own* Freddy. They negotiated the rights for him to appear as a killer but they don't have the rights to make new visual designs for him.
---
Ironic coming from you.

Eastern Canada, higher ranks. Had no issues when the new matchmaking system was in place, longest wait time was 5 minutes maybe. Then they announce they are reverting back and it’s been terrible since. During the early evening wait times vary from 10-30 minutes, then it seems later it’s nearly an hour at times. When the new matchmaking was in place it was consistently good.
---
Fortunately, in our match there was no toxicity. I earned my escape and he probably did it for that exact reason.
---
But I do get your point, being nice/funny is a healthy way to deal with all shit in this game :)
---
I appreciate the tips, I could always learn more to be a better trapper. 
---
I actually like Legion, it’s the survivors who are bullies
---
Can't expect noed gamers to know how to play the game.
---
I got to rank 1 for the first time ever before the last reset. For my troubles, I received 0 rewards that might've been an incentive to grind it out, and then got to survive exclusively against the most oppressive killers in almost every game. I imagine killer is even worse at rank 1. Not only is depipping and smurfing a huge problem, but with the ranked systems current state, I fully understand why you'd want to. It's ridiculous that an exclusively multiplayer game that has been out for years now was allowed to reach this state.
---
And Noed can be covered with Thrill or Haunted ground to fuck over Surviviors who try to break the totem. Killers also have more base move speed than Surviviors by default (save for the nurse, who has SLB). Surviviors shouldn't have to always have the "we lose if I do my job" threat looming over their head
---
Poised vs Lightweight ? 
---
As a Billy main i agree 100% 
---
True enough.  Just wanted to mention it as I have seen people who think killers have never gotten the short end of anything
---
it's been happening to me as killer and I'm honestly not sure if it's always involuntary or because I'm playing the Plague. It's happened to me as survivor too, where to me it appears that the killer disconnected but to them it looks like I rage quit. Mostly since the last patch.
---
Well the Skilled Huntress trophy on PS4 requires you to:
---
*In ranked trials, put Survivors into the dying Health State* ***100 times*** *with The Huntress' Hunting Hatchets attack while futher than 24 meters.*
---
But the achievement on PC requires you to:
---
*In ranked trials, put Survivors into the dying Health State* ***20 times*** *with The Huntress' Hunting Hatchets attack while futher than 24 meters.*
---
This is because when A Lullaby For the Dark Chapter was released, the requirements for the achievement and trophy where 100 Survivors, but because the requirements were rediculous, they reduced the number requested to 20. The only problem is that because Sony doesn't allow developers to change trophy requirements, the Skilled Huntress trophy has been stuck at 100 times since The Huntress was released.
---
That's also why you can still achieve a Killers Adept trophies by killing of sacrificing all 4 Survivors.
---
She picks up the last one without hesitation lol, poor guy
---
Somehow, pads never occurred to me. Either way, he looks fabulous! 
---
Doctor be like
---
*doctor noises*
---
She actually ended up farming with him for a bit then letting home go. She was a true scholar.
---
Monto runs ruin in every. single. video I've ever seen. 
---
Slow the game down just a little bit... What perk do you think he's talking about when he says that in every single video?
---
And tru3 runs noed 90% of the time.
---
Rarely he will play games without it and go right back to it.
---
you uh, ever tried chewing before?
---
whatever the latest patch was really fucked up matchmaking 
---
This is a play on Nurse Ratched from \*One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\*, not the nurse from DBD.
---
the biggest problem I see is people forget that every survivor out there isn't super skilled. Any nerfs done to curb that toxic squadette that get all 5 gens done in 2 minutes will have a trickle down affect and make it more difficult for those default Dwights and Megheads that spend 10 minutes doing 1 gen and hide everytime they hear a heartbeat.
---
The healing changes semi-recently are already indicative of that, with lower levels being to scared to do stuff while injured, they're content spending 1 minute+ running to a corner to self-care against sloppy butcher.
---
While I do agree there are entitled survivors out there, that doesn't excuse killers for thinking they deserve kills every match no matter their performance and should face the fact that they are going to come across survivors that outplay them.
---
Yeah also just more brown hair cosmetics for Kate would be nice.
---
Same. Except now I get teased by my friends for instantly recognizing whatever the killer’s perks/add-ons are and letting them know.
---
True, but BHVR's patching system is very much centered around Chapters, which obviously drives people mad with the slow response rate. I'm a pretty new player, but I haven't seen any hotfixes yet, and the bugs are not only slow to fix, but persistent - loading screen freezes have been a part of this game for how long now?
---
The new emblem system pretty much forces players to go for the unhook in order to even safety pip so that's probably why you're seeing it, also if you're in any rank purple or higher I'd try to avoid leaving one person on the hook for longer than a stage because you get pretty punished for it (not to mention you do lose bloodpoints for it as well). Not saying you're in the wrong btw, if there's a survivor nearby it's alright to stay relatively near the hook imo but at least give them the chance to unhook and get the farmer down (it'll be better for you pipping and bp wise anyways)
---
Lmao fair enough
---
I would recommend lingering around the hook a little longer than you might normally in a regular game, but if you camp more often than not you just hurt your odds of success as a killer in the long run. Pressure the gens is the golden rule. Everything becomes a game of attrition from there. If you obsess over hooking the same survivors it just gives the others more time to repair gens uninterrupted. 
---
Thicky bitch or a stick that vomits. You have a obvious winner!! Haha
---
The shape
---
The killer is also 1000% wasting his time if he slugs like that and doesn’t have Whispers or isn’t a stealth killer. 
---
Is this a new Feng outfit? 
---
But Poised can be used in chases too, because it activates every time a gen is completed, not just when you pop a gen.
---
You know when people try to downplay dead hard and other people say its strong? This is why.
---
The hatch appears if the number of fixed generators outnumbers the amount of remaining survivors by one. It opens automatically, if only one survivor is alive.
---
You can open it with either a pink or purple key if it has already spawned and is closed
---
I prefer hitboxes than ping because hitboxes are a problem for every game no matter the ping whereas ping is only a problem for games with high ping 
---
You known why people hook swarm? Because with the shity emblem system, you have to compete with your teammates to get unhooks and actually pip. Camping will LITERALLY result in both parties depiped, so don't do it. If you're bad at downing survivors we have a saying for that  git gud. 
---
I seen a lot of people say it's bad...like what bitch??
---
Y'all are thinking of the perk Bamboozle. Personally I really like Guard Dog as is, makes getting those indoor saves a really tenuous venture.
---
This is true. However Lightweight works all the time. Poised relies on communication and precise timing or sheer dumb luck.
---
How's a Farmer John?
---
Unfortunately, balancing around survival rates isn't as effective as you'd think since the game and matches those stats are based on aren't balanced themselves. 
---
It's like designing a blueprint based off a house on a crooked foundation without fixing the foundation in the new plans 
---
"useless in swf"
---
ok then
---
The memo is you played with a bunch of *idiots*
---
gay do crl apanhei-te ;) 
---
Distortion gives you the information about BBQ in the first place. Without it you would either get seen or waste 10 seconds or so each hook if you want to avoid it.
---
The good thing about it is not really the effect but the info you get from it. You will know about Nurse's Calling, BBQ etc. Against Freddy it gives you an opportunity to get away during the chase. There are a few cool appliations for it.
---
I agree with OP that is underrated.
---
No the trophy requires you to kill or sacrifice all four Survivors. They worded it as "Merciless Victory" because that's just when they made those trophy descriptions, the only way to achieve a Merciless Victory, is to kill or sacrifice all Survivors.
---
this post is filled with survivor mains its unreal
---
Have any Plague perks worked themselves into the meta? Or just specific ones on specific survivors?
---
Its easy to get a 3k, but doing it without camping/tunneling is harder, also if you want a 4k you basically need ruin, otherwise that person is getting hatch.
---
I would love to go up against you with the swf i paly with and easily stomp you considering your choice of killer.
---
Ruin isn't for getting kills, its for making sure you have time to do shit. It takes 80 seconds (if you hit all greats) on a gen with ruin, if 3 people are on 3 different gens and you chased 1 person for 80 seconds or less without ruin, that is most likely 3 gens done.
---
I dont know how you play but im guessing your the type who says "im not tunneling, im going after the weaker survivor. It makes sense"
---
Watching all this animations really makes me wanna play with you guys
---
Whispers, Nurses, Monitor &amp; Abuse and Enduring is my current build, replace Whispers for Barbecue if you want points.
---
What you play on? 
---
you clearly never play killer at high ranks if you think they can get 3 mans with ease
---
Sure did. 
---
SOMEONE GIVE THIS MAN PLATINUM 
---
um plague does not ignore loops
---
Yeah OP was dumb and shouldn't have tried his luck but I have no respect for a killer who runs NOED. 
---
I didn’t pip, I was close tho
---
he was using myers and doesn’t camp, in the beginning they escaped his grasps using flashlights and decided to tea bag... they didn’t know a Epik gaymer was playing against them
---
Where I'm stuck right now is that I was a rank 6 survivor before and I hadnt played in a few weeks and came back to the new system as a rank 15. Now I'm stuck in games full of disconnectors and face campers and I cant even rank up unless I do every gen single handedly.
---
Freddy pls
---
Plague got tired of your shit so she turned into a green flare
---
he killed them so hard their internets went out
---
Imagine calling a cosmetic a skin. Also please learn to type properly, okay sweetie? 
---
Yep, can confirm that that's exactly how it went down. I like how that encourages creativity.

Give us the chisme, did you get any toxic hatemail back?
---
The difference is: the green and orange shmock (cosmetic shirts) look WAY better on the old one, her hair was more animated, her stance was different (more bent down and focused) and she looked more afraid
---
It doesn't need a nerf it needs a buff if anything in this state. It's absolutely trash and you can say goodbye if the killer has Enduring. 
---
Yee haw init m8!
---
distortion + poised is a really nice combo

i have only played a little bit on pc but its nice. feels weird at first but you get used to it. Personally i do like the controller in terms of looking around, feels smoother and faster to me than a mouse. One positive of the pc though is that the skillchecks feel less laggy and easier to hit
---
ive heard M&amp;KB makes the game a lot better
---
Why do I feel like I identify with this?
---
I wouldn't mind. The moment the killer steps on him, he gets stunned for 10 seconds. 
---
what does sweaty mean in regards to a killer, is it just another word for tryhard? 
---
nurse and billy don't need it.  They've got huge snowball potential and map pressure.  Every other killer should think about bringing it though
---
Makes sense, but I'm sad now
---
Surprisingly no
---
Its used to be all you got at red ranks. Now that pipping is slower, its all you get at purple ranks too.
---
Basically stay around the mid teens and enjoy the tunneling trappers.
---
Interesting story given none of em has a flashlight
---
Why don’t you take a seat over there..

Awesome thanks mate. The gameplay looks a lot faster in general.  I've found a cheap setup so might get that in a few weeks.

Cool people run UnbreakaBill.

Corrupt Intervention will be meta on Hag and Trapper and Infectious Fright will be meta on Myers. Some people may start to use CI instead of Ruin because is not RNG based like Ruin.

We no... *chili*

Are you a child? Excusing your own faults through others? “YoU wErE rUdE fIrSt!”
---
&gt;I got iridescent on everything except generators I got a silver and the game was like “nope here’s a black pip”
---
That's silver, iridescent, iridescent, iridescent. Adding up to a total of 14/16 points. If 14/16 did not land you a pip then that means 15/16 would be a pip at the very least. If 15/16 is a pip then 16/16 is a double pip. But here's the thing, you said you can't get past rank 5. Rank 5 is part of the purple ranks. If this happened at purple ranks and it gets harder as you go into red ranks then it would have to be upped by at least 1 and 16/16 points would land you 1 single pip. That means from what you're saying you physically cannot double pip at red ranks. This is untrue and you can not have safety pipped with 14 points at rank 5.
---
The discord mods are snowflakes anyway, get out of there while you still can.
---
So they essentially all found flashlights from chests, sounds legit lol
---
Fair enough
---
No.. So is it true you told kate your were “gonna grab dat booty like leatherface” on a private messenger?
---
I've noticed a good amount of LGBT folks playing this game too. Seems I run into a lot of women playing as well or at least more than I see in other games. I have no answer for why.
---
I noticed the same thing with left 4 dead back in the day as well. Maybe it's just something with 4 player coop horror games lol. 
---
? not sure why I should report him, just told him he's very scary. 
---
Yes sir.

Didn’t say all of em buddy

You don’t play? so whats the point of you even being here? I’m also screenshoting this exchange 😅
---
3 blink + range Nurse vs Prayer Beads Spirit vs Frank's Mix Tape Legion, which is more "fun" to verse ?
---
Depends on which version of Freddy we're talking here. Englund's Freddy didnt have much of a preference. The stuff about him being a diddler only came after Jackie Earl Hayley took on the role. 
---
I DONT SEE ANYTHING I DO NOT SEE ANY THING I DOOOOONT SEEEEEE ANYYYYY THIIIIIING.
---
Tapp knows how to take it off without a key in the video game. I think he can teach them.
---
It's always this. The shot-callers in any organization tend to have a fairly myopic view where the product is concerned. All they need to do to keep their bosses happy is to show an increase in revenue, profit margin, whatever. A few years go by, they get promoted, and whether the product is a dumpster fire or not is somebody else's problem. 
---
So you just assume I have to tunnel? That’s something I definitely don’t do and I still 3k in majority of games. Sloppy butcher does a decent enough job slowing down the game for the killers I use. Obviously if I spend a whole minute and a half (80-90 seconds) then gens will get done. It’s all about getting first hook early then finding somebody else to chase soon after. Repeat. Plus hitting as many people as possible lets sloppy butcher do the job. Obviously if you don’t want somebody to get hatch then you need Ruin unless the survivors are awful. There’s not debate that you need Ruin to stop them from getting two gens done. However in your case, billy spirit and nurse can end chases in less than 20 seconds in most cases so they do not need Ruin. 
---
Did you play dbd and have too much sugar before bed?
---
mmhm. alright sir... your free to leave whenever you want to
---
Okay.. you sure you don’t want some chili?
---
Just how good they are, add-ons included. Freddy has great stall with his dream world, the transition can be used to mindgame for a free hit, he has superb tracking, and cannot be seen while awake, just a non directional lulaby. He isn't great in chases, but he isn't about getting in lots of chases, he's about getting hits and dropping chases.
---
Yeah why is freddy so high and clown so low?
---
Nea must end him then 
---
Ps4 player in England, here. I'm rank 3 and having no trouble finding games.
---
I know it doesn't help *you*, I'm just pointing out not  *everyone is affected .
---
I’d really enjoy a Legion film. It probably wouldn’t be a horror film(yikes I know) and would probably build up and flesh out each member leading up to them being taken. Not to mention just seeing how Frank somehow manipulated each member would be an interesting plot point.
---
Spirit or Clown
---
You forgot he is completely useless when gates are powers.
---
Where can I find "You're Next?"
---
That’s Riley Ried 
---
You sir are worse than Hitler.
---
I was able to watch it for free on Vudu, but it does have occasional 30-second ads
---
I'm screaming at babashook. That's perfect. 
---
Freddy is good in anything that isn't a chase.
---
Clown is only marginally better than Freddy in a chase, but has nothing else going for him.
---
I actually like playig against doctor. It's not like hiding is impossible and he is pretty easy to loop
---
i’m sure, please leave sir.
---
I agree but personally I'd put him down a rank because of that dream transition time it can really screw him in so many ways. 
---
Why is the doctor where he is another one I'm curious about? I'd put him one higher but then again he is my fav killer so could just be bias.
---
His power is good for tracking and stalling the game and if you time shocks right it can shut down loops preventing a pallet drop or window jump and so on.
---
Tasty
---
Ever since the update, I have a crazy time finding matches as killer. I'm us east. 
---
Couldn't have said it better myself
---
Yea they could do plenty of stuff - another option is maybe give rank based on character completion as well, say if you have at least 3 characters at lvl50 you should be rank 1. Seems fair to me, since besides experience that's the only thing that separates new players from veterans
---
Makes me think of Scarecrow from Arkham Asylum 
---
Slightly disappointed it wasn’t a Dwight.
---
I learned that the hard way
---
Okay.  *goes through garage to get in car*
---
WHEEEEEEE HAHAHA WWWWHEEEEEEEE
---
Works every time. 
---
His stall should stop them from getting to that point, plus if you REALLY wanna count perks, endgame perks work well. His endgame is what put him below Spirit IMO.

---
“People who say they are rank 1 and get 3-4 kills without ruin are either full of shit and are lying* on the internet,”
---
People who are better than you at the game and who have more experience can do something that you can’t do (supposedly) and because of this they are lying? You really are pulling out all the strings now arentcha.

I am glad there are some of us, brother. Makes the pain easier to bear. 
---
-everyone disliked that
---
Discordance is the most overrated killer perk.
---
I have already proved to you how that is not the case. If you don't believe me go and look up the emblem score requirements to pip at rank 5. 
---
yes- yes it is
---
Ok?
---
*tantrum noises*
---
If you miss with Corrupt Purge you don't have hands.
---
Best thing you can do is play swf to get decent teammates so you can rank up, otherwise it will be a huge struggle.
---
Yup report them 
---
Clowns entire power is based around helping him in the chase while Freddy’s power is actually more based around avoiding commuting to chases and he doesn’t gain anything from chases via his power. In what way is clown only, “marginally better,” in chases? 
---
I admit being only marginally stronger is a definite exaggeration, so that's my bad. But he isn't great in a chase. Not bad, but not great either. So I'll give up that Clown is notably better than Freddy in a chase, but has everything else worse.
---
Its worse when there is legit no reason for them to leave. No noed the killers chasing someone else, they fully healed. Like bruh. End game is best game.
---
I personally balence them out best I can when I solo. Ive saved people being facecamped by hillbilly. I mean yeah ill die but I die a motherfkin hero. 
---
I don't get it
---
Right now it's pick your poison, either we worry about balanced matchmaking - or we worry about being able to play at all.
---
I'm sorry newbies, but we have been supporting this game for way longer - go play some private with friends and get good over there. We just want to play and your incompetence it's affecting our waiting times. 
---
This game is not that hard, hurry up and improve so us veterans can play.
---
Good job dood.
---
Cause I wanted to post it. Mind if I ask what is your biggest problem with my list? I'd love a discussion.
---
"What the hell is this? I'm taking this bastard down!" -Detective Tapp, probably
---
Will I lose my teachable perks if I prestige? Do I need to get the character back up to those levels to have them reachable again?
---
Yeah, I'm faulting more players than the company, I do think it's a bit extreme but players are certainly taking it the wrong way. Like I shouldn't be getting unhooked and ensuring a tunnel just because they want a pip... that makes it worse for all of us.   
---
I'm just going to keep playing like I do and hope it eventually pays off.
---
Wow, Adventure Communism with a dbd reference? Never thought I would see this.
---
Since you earn xxxxxx blood points per game, it’s very hard to land a perfect zero after spending the points.
---
That I can agree with.
---
True. Personally I'm not playing again until the Freddy rework, they fix infinite loading screens or the dedicated servers are released. 
---
A couple of weekends ago I was playing with my buddy and we ran into a Bubba. He downed one of the randoms after a few chases with everyone and then facecamped him. The rest of us finished gens and left, and then that Bubba popped off on us. He was saying a wide variety of crazy things from “I’m gonna camp derankers like you guys” (even though it was like 3 days after rank reset) to “there is a killer shortage.” It was truthfully the most hilarious interaction I’ve ever had with someone in this game, and I feel bad that he goes to play this video game feeling so upset all the time
---
I'm glad we had a chill discussion. 😊.
---
Honestly you can have Clown in high D or low C and I'd not argue.
---
Dead by Daylight has the best ranking system because you can only lose when your allies are bad.
---
I agree that Freddy is not at the bottom, but he should be mid tier and not high tier. As someone who as played Freddy a lot I can safely put him there. Like you said he is good at everything other than chase. Which isn't a bad thing, Freddy's tracking and smaller TR allows him to sneak up on survivors and get a lot of Free hits. Freddy also has the ability to slow down gens by 50%. Unlike a lot of killer who are almost forced to run perk like Ruin Freddy ahs a lot more options when it comes to load outs, making you able to focus on chasing and not disrupting progress.
---
Leatherface, you better not have or you'll end up nerfed into oblivion like Freddy.
---
This sparks Joy, and also does not sparks Joy.
---
It can be ultra strong when it decides to actually work when you press E / whatever binding you have. 
---
I'd consider him mid tier because of those traps.
---
Clown is good withhis low tier rank. His ability doesn't specialise in tracking anti looping or slowdown but does a bit of each which makes him rounded but still low tier as you can run the gas and still get away.
---
Now keeping that in mind compared to trapper his traps hard shutdown loops causing survivors to get trapped or herded he can shutdown areas and free chase in others great map control. And if we take in consideration addons like extra traps that expands. While his initial setup can be costly time wise you can counter that with a ruin and a trap on it usually. His mid game to late game can spiral out of control for survivors as you can't just tank the anti loop like with clown.
---
Also considering addons he has one makes disarming traps hurt so you get a remote hit essentially and intel on location and at worst usually drives that survivor to go hide and heal.
---
Also for many survivors they see a trapper and they become more cautious of where they step for overall slowdown of movement throughout the match.
---
Update on that - I just had two games in a row with this wiggle bug without the gen blocking perk 
---
I did take my ambien
---
Never seen it in the store, I think :( Will double-check.
---
Try her default cardigan with this skirt and P3 face :D
---
Ace and Huntress. Both are Daddy material.
---
Honestly, the difference between fifth place (Freddy) and ninth place (Doc) isn't too big. Seventh is dead center, so Freddy is barely above that, so mid high. It kinda shows that I don't stress tier differences, so Freddy is only slightly above Huntress, despite being a whole tier up.
---
wtf did i just read?
---
Billy can easily be the killer if you want map pressure and controlling it
---
When I play as a solo survivor this happens way to often recently. Had it happen 7 times within 3 days so I literally just quit because it ruined my games so often (I was a bit burnt out on killer). The worst part is that reports rarely do anything (My friend that used to play, flamed hard after every game and he still didn't get banned. He stopped playing because he mainly played killer and he wasn't to thrilled about the broken bullshit back in the days). Though all of this could just be anecdotal evidence and me just being really unlucky.
---
Oh believe me I'm dreading the fucking rework. Knowing how shit the devs are I know damn well they're going to ruin him. I can play him just fine unless I'm up against a very well coordinated SWF group but the devs have been ignoring him for ages now and its annoying me how little they have their priorities right.
---
Also it's Freddys not Freddie's. The name doesn't change when it's a plural and the apostrophe is only for possessions. 
---
The fact you can escape and still depip is stupid. It should be a safety no matter what. (Even if you literally did fuck-all and hid in a locker and got the hatch)
---
I dislike the gatekeeper change. I think it's designed to make it so the killer has to be more proactive (I used to get Iri gatekeeper all the time as 3-gen doc because the match will get dragged out a long ass time even if all the other gens get done super quick) but the new gatekeeper means the killer pretty much has to rush and kill all survivors as fast as possible before gens can be done which isn't fun as killer or survivor.
---
The DBD fourms are more professional but it's mostly just killer mains who will laugh at survivor-sided opinions...
---
Always clear a Hex totem.  Even if it's haunted ground, you should take the risk.

I just want a community that is civil

How do you infect hooks at the plague? Whenever I throw up on them nothing happens
---
exactly
---
Hey guys, devs are bad, does that make me funny? Am I popular for explioting a mistake their gonna fix?? Where is my Reddit gold
---
Ok I am not sure then. But every time it happens to me the killer has that perk.
---
Huntess... daddy? seems right
---
Lol it’s not trash. It’s still a good perk. It’s just nowhere near being broken like the old version was. Seems like you’re going through decisive withdrawals. I would suggest getting good so you don’t have to rely on crutches to escape. 
---
How do you infect hooks? Whenever I vomit on them nothing happens
---
I don't care for grammer online so chill, also if you have no problem with him then why are you complaining
---
Is there a reddit for it though?
---
Funnily enough, Scarecrow in that game made *me* think of the original Freddy; especially with the dreamlike transitions into his Fear sections and the way he's able to manipulate and dominate the Fear version of the world.
---
Wasn’t that just in the shrine of secrets lol :p thank you though but did it not change 
---
my gamertag isn't deadbyhitler for nothing ;) 
---
I never actually complained. I just mentioned how we're still waiting for news about the Freddy rework. You're the one who even brought him up with your little remark about me being a Freddy main. 
---
I like it. They could increase the intensity of the aura depending on how much it was saboed as well.
---
AFAIK all the game cares about for the achievements is the 3 perks and a 4K. I don't know if Mori's are allowed (AFAIK you CAN use addons and offerings but no 4th perk) but you don't need to double pip/see "Adept Killer" or whatever to get it.
---
Tbh i like to down the unhooked person just so i ruin the farmer's altruism emblem
---
[here's the link on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/Shontellespark3/status/1110351495873159168?s=19)
---
Didn’t see this until it was too late, but how would the killer even tunnel you? If you got away and used a fountain then that means the killer isn’t on you/near you and you’ll have no problem just leaving the area.  If anything, the problem with my idea is that the killer won’t find you anyway so it may as well be an instant heal.
---
Really? Did you not see the massive amount of bug fixes in the patch notes? Dumbass. Do you really think the same people that work on bug fixes also work on DLC. DUMBASS FUCKOFF!!!!
---
He is. He already responded. I messaged him. 
---
Makes sense. Ruin makes the game incredibly easy as killer. I used to always have Ruin as one of my staple perks because of how easy it makes matches as killer. It’s just so predictable as all killers seem to use it and it’s boring to see the same thing over and over. I try to challenge myself to get better by not using it and I understand if you don’t 
---
Enduring actually hurts the stun now.
---
Dribbling was a situational counter, so your point of good Killers knowing how to dribble isn’t that strong. Hit distractions only really work when Survivors aren’t really paying attention. It didn’t prevent the strike completely like it used to. Circling can be avoided by staring at the skill check. All of these were not true counters because they were situational or relied on the Survivor’s skill. Enduring is now a true counter to it because it basically nullifies the strike. I guess it’s too much for this perk to have a true counter though. Survivors simply refuse to get good and stop relying on crutches. 
---
I had an extremely realistic dream where I was a survivor and Meyers tombstoned me. It was in first person and one of those dreams where you like *feel* it. I had that dream closer to when I first started playing and haven’t had any other DBD dreams like that since. 
---
You literally started off by complaining
---
Dammit dwight, how am i supposed to get my anti-looping lv up
---
Theoretically Quentin should be his type, but he's been age-lifted by a lot.
---
And that way hooks become tracked only after partially saboed, making sabo builds still viable without voice chat. I like it
---
Where your edges at hoe
---
Who said i defend ruin
---
Making the game slower makes the game easier... that’s the point. It gives you even more time to get the balling rolling and early hooks without gens getting done.
---
Exactly, I never said it wasn’t easy, I’m only saying it takes skill and practice to do it right 
---
Thats riley reid, she does alot of BBC vids. 
---
Huntress is a total daddy. 
---
i too would love to see a movie based of the shape
---
What's up with these thirsty comments? I thought we were all gay
---
Ayyy she doesn't look like Gollum, grats
---
Its not like it makes the game super slow, you can still get gens done fast, just not super fast
---
Rip everyone downvoted me Ahahah 
---
A little confusing at first glance, I know, but here's a quick run-down:
---
The game is a 2D co-op platformer/asymmetrical party game.  Up to four can play, with one person controlling the paranormal entity.  As an investigator, you'll search objects in the environment to find ghost-fighting items, as well as a key.  As you're searching, you'll also encounter a breaker box somewhere on the map, used to power the environment. Once you have the key and the power is on, a ghost-capturing trap spawns from the back of your van, and you'll take it to the outlet that spawns randomly on the map, eradicating the ghostly threat.
---
As a ghost (currently invisible in the photo), you'll use your cunning and ghostly abilities to either kill the investigators, or stop them long enough for time to run out.
---
Just a fun little game I've been working on and off on for a couple of months. It's really coming together now, and will likely be released in the next month or so.
---
I have a lot of fun playing doc, but as a new killer you're going to have a harder time with him than others. Same with Plague. If you're interested in farming with doc, you're going to need to level trapper anyway for Unnerving Presence, so I recommend starting with him.
---
oh ok sorry. I thought you meant like the killers that were here from the start original
---
Feng min as survivor- she is bae and her red dress is too good
---
For killer I have many that I can’t seem to choose a favorite design wise, some for cosmetics and some for gameplay
---
The spirit- love the story and how twisted and creepy she looks in game, as she twitches everywhere chasing you
---
The legion- looks amazing, I like all of the cosmetics
---
Big daddy Myers- pssshh, please... such an OG of slashers and his ability is so fun and can be game changing. His ability to jumpscare like no other also sets him apart design wise
---
The plague- she looks so amazing and her ability is quite interesting compared to many in the game. 
---
Huntress- she is so creepy and awesome with her lullaby and overall being a mask wearing badass 
---
“Survivors rise up”
---
You don't need Billy to go against those teams. He just feels cheap. You can tell the difference between him and other killers right off the bat when you play him.
---
He does need to be nerfed however I'm not going to deny that Pig does seem quite shit imo. There should be a middle ground.
---
I'd argue that Nurse is in her own level above everyone else, but besides that there's nothing I can strongly disagree with. (Personally I'd put Trapper in C, Doctor in D, and Wraith ahead of Pig, but that's whatever.)
---
My real question is where does the Plague fit into this in your opinion?
---
I say small game shouldn't reveal traps or hex totems. I'm all for dull totems having their auras shown.
---
perhaps you should go to sleep earlier. 
---
Yes, another tier list disrespecting clown. Yet every time I beat SWF with him I get hate mail talking about how good he is
---
It's really bad and people don't seem to care... the team is at a disadvantage if someone dies quickly, it's pretty simple. I have honestly been a little less helpful to teammates who I am aware are farming me (if I even survive that long), it's just not fun. At least they're not getting hatch in games now. Still incredibly unfun for us, though, especially when all you try to do every game is the right thing. 
---
I find that *very* hard to believe. Your replies have hardcore 'survivors are op' killer main written all over them. 
---
It's not a counter to tunneling if you don't even get a chance to use it. Especially when it gets hard countered by Enduring *so much so* that you play with 3 perks the whole match with little reward for even using the perk because it's now so trash. Both of those perks aren't worth running anyway aside from Urban Evasion. Besides, Hangman's is not really a counter to Saboteur if you're sabo saving like you generally should be. Oh and some of the best every game Doctor addons are the ones that reveal the auras of survivors when they tier up so you can't really complain about that when it gets double countered. 
---
I don't know man I clap cheecks as freddy
---
I thought I saw other plagues do it and because I want to infect survivors who help their friends off the hook 
---
Weak? She can throw corrupt plague with no aim involved, spray and pray if you will. The cool down is a joke, she runs at full speed with it charged. That shit goes over barrels better than hatchets. She is not weak. She’s strong as hell.
---
YOOOO LAAAWLL DUD JUST CLEANSE TOTEMS DUUUUD LOOOOOOL 4Head 😂😂👌👌👌👌😂💦😂💦😂💦
---
Someone take their demon child please
---
I can't imagine what it's like at higher ranks, the new system sent me from rank 12 back to 15 despite how hard I tried to work in games. Before this update I was getting a lot of slugging in higher ranks, now it just seems so much worse. I'll see someone hooked and within a second the icon has changed back, how can anyone think that's a good idea for their team?  
---
You really don't get rewarded playing solo, honestly; I go from only being unhooked in second stage to being unhooked way too fast after the update, what gives. I won't blame people for doing more swf in future if it comes to that. 
---
Chainsaws on console tbh
---
The nurse for sure. So easy to escape the nurse 
---
she keeps em in her pocket
