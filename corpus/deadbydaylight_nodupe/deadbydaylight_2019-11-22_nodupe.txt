I’M SORRY I DON’T UNDERSTAND HOW I WAS NOT NICE CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN

---
There cause is dumb as it will kill oni
---
Are we on the same subreddit?
---
Yeah old kit was more imaginative and more fun, not really a fan of new freddy
---
TO YOUR PARENTS :b

---
Cheers - appreciate the help
---
I kept trying to get it legit w wraith. And couldn't get it for the life of me so just gave up and farmed.
---
Just look at the front page dude theres more whining about oni nerfs than people actually asking for it lol.
---
yeap
---
Beta Bill looks awesome. I'd play him again for that
---
Aw tits now I'm sad :( i got go through the sub to see i hope you ain't right.
---
Me after making one suggestion are talking about something that’s bad or weak on the killer side 
---
THE ENTIRETY OF THIS SUBREDDIT: You have commented war crimes and will be punished
---
Nurses are near nonexistent on console because you can't blink as accurately with a controller. Idk if that would actually give survivors a disadvantage, but it *might*. Also PC Huntress' would be crazier than console Huntress', but again, idk if that would really affect the capability of console survivors 
---
But yeah compared to FPS games DbD would benefit from crossplay with every other platform
---
OH NO IT WASN’T ANYTHING LIKE THAT I’M FAILING GEOMETRY AND I’M MAD AT MYSELF AND PARTIALLY AT MY TEACHER AS I BELIEVE SHE IS A FACTOR TO MY FAILURE
---
If you just slug people and not hook, they might catch on and see you are just farming points or doing daily. If they join in the BP farm it's easy to pick one up while they are doing a gen.
---
Mike would fuck up demo and plague
---
It’s cringe because she’s portrayed as perfect in every way able to overcome any challenge and every single male involved in her life besides her one grandfather was a dick and a barrier to her.  It comes off as a tumblr blog about power fantasy rather than a realistic backstory.  Every other woman in dbd has a solid backstory but hers is like a fan fiction.
---
Negan as killer when. You already have the mori handed to you BHVR, c'mon
---
i agree. but that doesn't sell as well.
---
I seriously believe between Bill, David, Ash and maybe Laurie.  The Killers would be getting their asses collectively handed to them if survivors could fight back
---
Oh you’re like a parody account lmao. 
---
If you aren’t you are a caricature of a player
---
Dank.
---
Yeah, nothing wrong with that. I just don’t like when a killers build is entirely made up of slowing the game down. I’ve played against so many killers lately running Ruin, POP, Thanataphobia and Nurses calling that I feel like I can’t comfortably do anything.
---
With that said, I do understand the purpose of ruin. It’s so detrimental to run against anyone over Rank 16 these days.
---
Wait, is 2v8 an actual possibility? That would be awesome!!
---
Why cares if they face camp? the other players should just do gens. Let him have your death and the other survivors get away. The killer gets less points.
---
He’s loop-able their you go
---
With infectious fright, you just string a bunch of kills together and it’s gg.
---
OH, GEOMETRY WAS A HOP AND A SKIP FOR ME. BUT ALAS, I’M A SOPHOMORE IN COLLEGE NOW AND EVERYTHING SUCKS.
---
if its not spirit or billy its fine. I have no problem going against mori, camp/tunnel stuff
---
At a certain range dipshit
---
200 hours is nothing you're fine with the newbies. Most high ranked people have 1000+ hours and can double pip at green ranks and rank up fast. You shouldn't be complaining about losing your rank if you barely play and have barely any hours
---
Nea main? (:
---
LOL
---
Is it Meg that gets the mask if you have the game Deathgarden?
---
Maybe legion or plague. (I know I’m going to get hate for saying legion but he’s very fun to play)
---
"I didn't want to slug you anyways, BAKA!"
---
I want to steal this for my Discord profile, it's amazing.

Oh no, I have. I REALLY love the fact he has to work for it. It makes him so much more fun. It’s just that I don’t think his power is adjusted very well. He has a high skill cap and is kinda hard to use if you don’t know how to slug well but I think he needs to be slightly nerfed in terms of the hit box his attack has and the cool down after the charge. But he’s gonna need something to balance him out too. Btw before I get called an entitled survivor main, I’m a killer main.
---
Hillbilly.
---
&gt;Mcote himself said it was coming on December 3rd so it's definitely confirmed
---
Link?
---
What I notice is when they’re using Ruin, I never find any totems.  But the minute they have haunted ground I might as well spawn right next to the totem.
---
Ok boomer.
---
Just to clarify this isn't my own photoshop. I was looking only for dbd merch and a site was using this image to advertise their clown mask. It just had to be shared on this Reddit.
---
Quick question have you ever played killer and at what rank?
---
haha, of course a survivor mori would be a t bag
---
[removed]
---
No mither + iron will. Gotta get that 150% noise reduction
---
So adorable. Great work!
---
Oof didn't think about that one...
---
BHVR employees use Their(name)\_BHVR not (random stupid shit) BHVR
---
&gt; I saw zero complaints about Spirit before the nurse nerf happened.
---
Lol what.
---
I want to smash
---
Your art has some nice style!
---
And gets 4K
---
Damnit, you're right
---
but...but you had gf caught on tape
---
Done.
---
Nothing Personnel?
---
Dude! I had 3 claudettes hiding in small spot of a T wall in McMillan estate. I can't see them at all, until I instinctively decided to check it anyway and saw a P3 Claudette crouching there.
---
False
---
Demogorgon, Hag, Spirit, Trapper, anyone with mobility/detection
---
My rage quitters are mostly megs and neas
---
While hitting walls every millisecond...
---
They added undetectable to Beast of Prey. Just as bad. No one seems to be talking about that.
---
What the fuck?
---
I think BHVR could get away with removing/nerfing the flick. They did this with Hillbilly, and he's still dummy-strong.
---
Now add fragment, tombstone, or tuft, pwyf, and devotion and you've got yourself something spicy.
---
Wait that sounds like an old challenge, do the older tomes stay when the new one comes? I hope so, i got finals coming up and i cant play at all since i want to keep my gpa up
---
Yes, he has to get at least one hit. Unless you're going against four looping gods with 2000+ hours each that all save sprint burst so they can rush to a safe area, you shouldn't have much of a problem getting a singular M1.
---
Use wraith and just camp the totem the entire match
---
And how controllable is the hillbilly in close range? 
---
Not really, and hillbilly's pallet break is much slower than the Onis. The Oni also has a constant one hit down when it's active, where hillbilly has to wind it up every single time.
---
What we really need is naked Myers
---
What survivor things were buffed?
---
She's so cute I could chop off her limbs and throw her through a glass window, then come back to finish her while she writhes in agony on a pile of broken glass
---
Seems also with the Oni, you can perform much easier when you’re in a dash then flick the mouse and down someone, which wouldn’t that easy for someone on console.
---
If you by “reworked” you mean “royally fucked”, then yes, Haddonfield has been reworked.
---
Mori time
---
Bill, Ash, Steve with a bat, and grandma Laurie would whip any killer’s ass.
---
 For people who doesnt know spanish, its: Here’s Daddy.
---
Tru3Talent and Pupper mainly, because I enjoy their content. Their dash is like Billy's Chainsaw, but won't crash into stuff by touching it. He gets looped pretty hard, with using his power being about the same as not for loops. The difference is when looping he can destroy pallets slightly faster by using his swing right (when using his power he can destroy pallets with his attack but there's still a cooldown after before you can move, like Billy) but except for that his power does nothing actually catching up to survivors within the loop. The good thing is he only needs one hit when using the power,  but the attack is straight, it isn't a swing so as far as I can tell you don't have the turning you can do mid-normal attack lunge to help you counter 360s. The attack is instant and has range though, so properly preparing for it beforehand should make that point a non issue.
---
Just play spirit with prayer beads
---
*Survivors fixing gens
---
*Wraith defending hex totem
---
Yeah this is big brain time
---
I love this for so many reasons.
---
I agree with this. Points for originality
---
I got it for free last September Cause it was 1 of the free ps plus games
---
What cosmetic is that for the piggy??
---
Ah, when things were still simple.
---
Iron Maiden LMAO
---
Maybe the issue we're having is that I'm calling out a long-standing dynamic with people frivolously complaining about being defeated in this game and applying terms like 'camping' and 'tunneling', and you're feeling like this is contradictory to what you've said about actual unsportsmanlike play and are reacting with anger.
---
This defense you're giving of "actually my playstyle is different and that doesn't mean I'm unskilled" (which isn't necessary, because nobody has implied you suck) is a little telling. So is your example - leaving a survivor on the ground while you chase off and possibly injure a nearby healthy survivor is usually the smart move, because a healthy survivor who knows what they're doing is going to body block you away from the hook.
---
To me, it's the same as the killers who get upset that the survivors have found strong loops or are flashlighting them while they break a pallet.
---
Christ, I'd rather wait for 30 min queue time than play this
---
Hononestly, if survivors were capable of actually fighting back he and Ash would probably singlehandedly kick most killers asses lol
---
10min ban will help you cool off or just get you off the game for good and you can find another which we know you wont 😲
---
I can easily play killer and get a 3k at low red high purple ranks.
---
Hot take: if the hatch opens for the last survivor without a key, I should be able to mori the last survivor without an offering
---
but yeah remove keys and moris they're both fucking lame
---
Well yeah devour hope is trash might as well surround it with trash by camping as wraith
---
WHY DO I GET TARGETED WHEN A KILLER FINDS THREE OF US AND AFTER LOOPING TWO GENS POP AND BECAUSE THEY LOST ME HE DCS JUST FOR ME TO WAIT 20 MINUTES FOR ANOTHER MATCH THAT FAILS TO CONNECT
---
THE SAD PART IS IM STILL PLAYING THIS SHIT
---
thx!!
---
*if* lawsuit ends
---
At first, it is not seem like much,but going deeper you see a lot of things, maybe the more features than any killer. Yeah, first hit would be hard but with corrupt + Discordance or whispers you will have the time. One hit gives him half of his power and orbs stay,so if they stay injured,it is guaranteed to take your power back quickly after some time. Also, because of the orbs you find survivors way easier.
---
His charge is way faster than hibility,the walls don't stop his dash,he can turn in the end of his dash,way easier to use than hilibily,His colldown's are very small too and eats pallets like crazy. A way better,better hibility.
---
It is a very interesting killer,but the combination  of how quickly takes his power bacm and how strong his power is leaves him essentially with no weaknesses. He obviously needs some tweaking of his number but the base kit is way better and tighted his features together than the Demigorgon/Freeddy clusterfuck.
---
I've seen just as many whiney posts like yours complaining about whiney posts.
---
Not when he winds his one shot when you're 10 feet away from a window because hotboxes.
---
RIGHT NOW its still spirit, however she is getting a nerf. Nurse's play rate has fallen since her nerf, but she is still very strong. Billy is also often played. The oni is already crazy good, but we will see.
---
Those who downvote are not only trash gamers, but also in reality due to poor parenting.
---
#lol millenials
---
I mean i am a crap killer and people d.c against me no matter who i play then i try to be nice to be trashed talked in the end. I play surv a shit ton and get killers raging at me for doing a gen i just think the whole game is toxic as crap.
---
Yes.
---
Character articles are always locked during the PTB to prevent vandalism, which unfortunately happened quite often in the past. Once the DLC releases, the articles can be edited by non-admins as well.
---
Wow never seen before garbage cosplay to get a few arrows very terrible!
---
except i'm playing on console, so dedicated servers aren't live. but it's fun that you're trying to play devil's advocate. next.
---
Yeah that’s how it is. 
---
Also, just fyi, all of the Demogorgon’s perks are trash, including Surge. Hitting a gen with Surge does only 6 seconds of total regression. On top of this, it’s highly situational, garbage in big maps, and has a cooldown of 40 seconds. Just so you don’t make the mistake of thinking it’s a good perk
---
The Deja Vu challenge is hard enough.

Old legion yeah he was very fun, actual legion no chance is shit
---
Hey, I wonder when BHVR will fix the fucking sound in this game. Spirit's already getting a nerf, the fact that I can be phasing and be incapable of hearing someone 5 meters away seems a little extreme.
---
There was a lawsuit involving the movie studio and the game that caused the game and rights for Jason to suffer. It ended the F13th game. Until it's settled and calm we might not see him in the game.
---
Then why are you here?
---
This.
---
Wow you made this entire post complaining about dead hard and talking about dedicated servers making it sound like you’re playing on PC only to say in the end that you’re on console because you have no valid argument 🙄
---
Is the huntress also dlc then? What other characters are dlc that I didn’t know about?
---
it wasn't in the movie that's what I'm saying...
---
no... i made a post about dead hard being glitched out and others chose to comment about when dedicated servers are coming out. 
---
you, on the other hand, decided to jump on a post without reading any of the thread beforehand. and now you look dumb. again, next.
---
I wish I could see these cries for nerfs everyone keeps posting about
---
Can survivive, but man, if we never get Jason, this game isnt complete, we need the big 3 slasher killers here: myers, jason and freddy.
---
Who gonna tell him
---
For free? In that scenario nobody knows where the hatch is since its barely spawning, all 3 survivors still have to be together, if the key bearer died with a weaved ring theres no more key, unless the killer is doing nothing chances are he's in one of the survivors at least, then factor in the fact that there's only a 30 second window for the hatch or even less if the killer closes it, so if all 3 survivors aren't together with the killer near, chances are they won't always all escape either.
---
2 or 1 survivor escaping by hatch is more common, but if it's 3 or 4, the killer kinda did that to themself.
---
Now that the Rift is here, that’d be a smart idea. 
---
I see nothing wrong with giving 3 fragments a ritual, considering rituals usually take a game or two and the Level 1 challenges (which take about the same amount of time) give about that many. Maybe 5 fragments for the Mori rituals but even that seems a bit generous.
---
It is super annoying
---
I really like the flick actually, it helps put a skillcap on him
---
Yus
---
How sad. 6.2 seconds is literally nothing.
---
Lol
---
Yup
---
he can be a killer after he's been lynched.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/HilariousOddOrcaVoteYea And? You don't get stunned by walls, you glide past them.
---
You can do this challenge as survivor. Teammates that are sacrificed count for the challenge (not yourself).
---
I did this one playing survivor lol
---
It's worse than equipping no perk vs stealth killers though.
---
I'm not sure if Clown could make it into Smash with his appearance and backstory, he'd probably be considered far too disturbing for the roster. Realistically they'd pick Trapper, or someone similarly inoffensive in design and backstory.
---
That cant happen swf destroyes that power
---
amen.
---
There is so much wrong with what you said. He doesnt just break pallets "slightly faster" HE FUCKING DELETES THEM
---
he dash is similar to billy but its much stronger. he is much faster and doesnt have to worry about bumping into anything, if you drop a pallet he destroys it immediately and you dont have much time to run away before he starts using his power again.
---
you cant do anything against him when he has his power.
---
I absolutely love all the added lore and the animated sequences, they’re really great.
---
I did this as mirror myers was easy
---
Usually if you think people who use 1 specific perk are garbage that means you think it's OP
---
More like great great grandpa.
---
Me with steve
---
cute art actually
---
I suspect that the upcoming seasons will be focused on non-DLC characters, at least until the leaked rebundle goes on sale. If a small portion of people have the character, then they won't be able to complete the character specific challenges.
---
I mean I knew this as soon as I saw the thing, so thats why I hope for one day to get a hastur thing going and have the entity make an avatar for himself to do the killing.
---
Yeah, she also has a more noticeable window vault animation, so you can’t get away with cheesy Fathers Glasses plays. None of her numbers were touched, just prayer beads and visibility.
---
The worst piece of shit is legion
---
Op I dont know maybe nurse
---
Daaaamn I'm on Xbone
---
Oh, whoops! I am just following the "perks worth getting" chart that Otz keeps updated - he listed Surge as "situationally good" and the other two as "not good" so I just grabbed it haha. Thanks for the info, though!
---
God bless lol
---
Say No Homo rn
---
I assume we'll get tomes in the order of release.
---
They start with Trapper then Wraith then Billy then nurse and then doctor maybe?
---
Exactly
---
What's the weirdest thing you've found on there?
---
I know, don't you hate itwhen BHVR does this to us. Next you know there's gonna be a challenge that tells us to be stunned by 10 pallets in one match as killer.
---
Wraith is a very happy boi in this comic :3
---
Honestly, we all know it's going to happen.
---
#bonk#
---
3 fragments might be kind of high for most of the dailies, as they're much easier than "complete 15 generators", or "sacrifice 13 survivors". I could see maybe an additional fragment for each one, and maybe two for the Mors Ambitio dailies.
---
Legion would never do such a thing
---
Ok let me explain a bit. So a youtuber named Int3r4ct believed that Surge did 18% regression to gens, not just 8%. An honest mistake considering they worded the perk’s description very weird. Him and Otz are good friends, and Int3r4ct told him that Surge did 18% regression. Otz made the video based on this information.
---
This Monday, however, the devs confirmed in the Q&amp;A that Surge only did 8% total regression. So yeah, not worth taking into games
---
I have 3 problems with that and that's why I mentioned it, you can disagree of course, but this is what I think
---
1. sometimes you can't find another survivor/the only other survivor alive is in chase and doing a gen is the best you can do, in this case he can easily get 100% multiple times from a single survivor for hitting you once
---
2. pretty sure a self care while the oni is using the more blood orb addons (maybe even without?) are 100% aswell
---
3. even if you go around the map looking for someone to heal you the oni can still follow the trail and get 100% without being in chase
---
if I would change something regarding that I would make so a single survivor can have only X% ammount of charge on the map at a time, with the older orbs dissapearing, this way a little chase/ hitting another survivor is required to fill your gauge over time, instead of finding a spot that gives you 1-4 free uses of your power that stays there forever
---
Exactly, everyone thinks he's gonna be 4king every game he plays now that he has nemesis and maybe beast of prey. News flash survivor mains, you can drop the pallet early and dark devotion can only be used with regular hits now, hits that deplete legions power. Play smart and you can beat him, but no one wants to try in this game, they just want wins handed to them.
---
Hey at least you got one!
---
Big exaggeration and that’s because of latency not hit boxes
---
I had this the other day on The Game. Couldn't do anything to stop it, no idea what else to do.
---
Can we get Luis as a survivor just so “Grabbin’ Peelz” can be a perk?
---
I would say after the game you'd feel awful for destroying a low rank but if you're using iri head you probably have no emotions anyway
---
I finished it in one game it ain’t that hard
---
omfg i made this but seth just reposted it LMFAOOOO
---
What rank currently
---
For buff yes know if a killer is weak is very easy, for nerfs no know if a killer is strong its no a thing of days you have to learn how to play againts him after asking for nerf
---
It’s pretty good though. Play Killer for BPs and Survivor for fun and tough matches
---
I feel like they should do this 
---
20=500 iri shards
---
19=1000 iri shards
---
18=1500 iri shards
---
17=2000 iri shards
---
16=2500 iri shards
---
15=3000 iri shards
---
14=3500 iri shards
---
13=4000 iri shards
---
12=4500 iri shards
---
11=5000 iri shards
---
10=5500 iri shards 
---
9=6000 iri shards
---
8=6700 iri shards
---
7=7000 iri shards
---
6=7500 iri shards
---
5=8000 iri shards
---
4=8500 iri shards
---
3=9000 iri shards
---
2=9500 iri shards
---
1=1000 iri shards
---
Basically if you reach rank 3 or higher you get a free character. And maybe add bloodpoints or something else to it idk
---
No, we really don't *need* them.
---
They also buffed Freddys snares to be stonger as everyone thought that were just weak.
---
When you try your best, but you don’t succeed
---
My guy, this is a picture
---
But everyone saids M1 killers are shit which he is so i dont get it
---
I honestly think the endgame and hatch closing is too killer sided I have had several games where I do three or 4 gens constantly unhook and run the killer around just to lose because my team was bad the killer closed the hatch and I don't have enough time to make progress on a door simply off of how fast they can walk between the two doors I think they should make the endgame last much longer if there is just one survivor left or at least boost the rate you can open a exit gate and to the people that say just play in a swfs you can't with how much killers bitch about that
---
Taken from the logs about the entity in the archives:
---
"The Entity is far more ancient than we ever suspected back home and most of our theories and conjectures were wrong. The rich presence of Auric particles and cells suggest it is one of the Original Ones—an Ancient."
---
"The Entity is the cosmic embodiment of evil."
---
"This leads me to believe The Entity is attracted to dark worlds because darkness and chaos are clear indicators that inhabitants have failed to connect the dots between the collective consciousness and the health of their world. The conclusion, then, might be that The Entity feeds off ignorance."
---
Compare the last one to the intro of "The Call of Cthulhu":
---
"The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age."
---
It looks like someone on BHVR had been playing way too many Onimusha on PS2 and decided to take a few ideas from that game and use it here (the Oni, the blood orb collecting mechanism, the charge mechanics, etc).

I guess the same reason killers dc as soon as they get looped a second too long or the ruin gets destroyed

---
[here you go friend](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5EChmFFesC/)
---
I can't stab the shit out of you without stalking you
---
Today I had a 4man SWF dc and call me broken toxic cancer.
---
I was playing a perkless addonless Wraith. Entitlement is over 9000.
---
Using logical fallacies (if Scott thinks this about X, he must think the same about Y and Z as well) never goes well.
---
Scott is a huge killer main, and him saying that this killer might be too strong is the opposite of a bias. Besides, the title is just proposing a question for a discussion, he’s not outright saying “The Oni NEEDS to be nerfed!” He’s saying in an indecisive tone that The Oni might be too strong, but that he’s also fun as hell and admits that he doesn’t quite know how he would fix Oni.
---
Also, literally one of the only reliable things a survivor can do is looping. If a killer cannot be looped then it’s probably too strong. And being too strong isn’t necessarily a bad thing, since Scott in another video says that he actually likes the Oni and hopes he doesn’t get nerfed because he just wants a “strong killer with consequences”
---
Your arguments for why Scott must think Billy and Myers are op are terrible. Sure Michael doesn’t need to hit anyone to get to tier 3, but not applying any pressure whatsoever results in a quick game. And Myers cannot travel around the map like Oni can, so Myers has less snowball potential, thus these two comparisons are redundant. And Billy doesn’t have that flick that allows him to turn 180° and still hit survivors, thus there is a much higher skill requirement to being good with him.
---
The last bit of your paragraph doesn’t even make sense.. you’re telling me that if Scott was rank 20 he would automatically be worse? As if his rank affects his ability to play the game?? I mean, a while ago Zubat streamed playing from rank 20 to rank 1 and surprise surprise; Zubat was still very good even at rank 20. Being a red rank killer has nothing to do with how good you are. Just because someone is in red ranks doesn’t mean they are some of the best killers ever who can win with any and all killers, being in red ranks means shit.
---
Until you get a match and all of the survivors have flashlights or keys
---
What's happened to Legion? (Poor console scrub here)
---
I'll be running Nemesis + Remember Me + Blood Warden + Rancor for funsies.
---
I will take that down, lmao
---
As In save the build for future use
---
Spirit. Many times If the survivor knows its Spirit, and there’s no Ruin, they won’t touch a glowing Hex totem.
---
I’m on PS4 and it’s the reverse, provided no events are going on. Just breezed through a Freddy game for the daily and am now waiting to be in a survivor match. I don’t know what it is as literally hitting Start for killer finds a match for me immediately while hitting Start, reading an article, watching a movie, etc. x1000 still won’t find me a match in a reasonable time for survivor.
---
This issue when events happen is the sole reason I gave up trying to play killer during them. The double BP one around the time Stranger Things DLC cane out was a nightmare for trying to play Demo but gladly gave me P3 Nancy. Let my Nancy carry me through the Halloween stuff and here we are. If another event arises with the Oni DLC, I’ll be P3’ing the survivor.
---
Your right you dont get stunned but its easy to lose a chase when you keep hitting shit it slows you down, it wastes your ability, and it can make you lose the survivor your chasing
---
Yes we do. The same devs crealy mention them in the reddit AMA
---
Hilarious art seen from Otzdarva's last stream (OtzNANI)

No, people didn’t comment about when dedicated servers are coming out, they commented saying that you’re having issues with dead hard BECAUSE of dedicated servers. After reading the very first reply you got where someone pointed it out, YOU chose to go off on everything dedicated server instead of simply commenting that it doesn’t apply to you because you’re on console. Basically you’re here to complain instead of actually get advice as to why you’re having issues.
---
Nobody who's good uses PS4
---
THIS KILLER TRIED BEATING MY GEN RUSH IM SO SO SO MAD BRO
---
Yes
---
slug them, pick them while facing a wall, mori them, dc after 3 seconds
---
The only thing I consider “toxic” is being a douchebag to other players in the end game chat (or in messages if you’re on console). 
---
If you think that things like camping, tunneling, gen rushing, or teabagging are toxic, you’re fragile.
---
No, we don't. The game is doing just fine. Just because you *want* him doesn't mean the game *needs* him. End of story. It would be great, sure. But it is not necessary for survival.
---
Yes, but you shouldnt ask for nerfs when the new killer just got introduced not even a week ago, at least try to adapt.
---
and be able to throw pallets at survivors
---
Because there are enough potatoes in greens for it to work.
---
Yeah, it’s something to do. But a lot people refuse to prestige because it’s really just pointless to them.

you...you don't start the game on Geforce you do it on steam
---
I thought this was the lgbt dbd reddit.
---
Maybe it is a bit early for opinions on him but i wish his power didnt encourage you to slug. They can change that by pausing his power when he picks up a survivor or at least not depleting it.
---
Don't you dare criticize my bread hat.
---
I hope when dead by daylight is starting to die out, that the last killer they add is the entity itself.  Hopefully this is a long ways away though
---
So in the new chapter there’s a perk that slightly brings back the old legion
---
when you tell a Rank 19 to do a Gen
---
I didn't know this was a thing before tbh oof
---
Nobody: 
---
OP: *empty white space with nobody for no reason*
---
I like having one perk that gives me awareness of chases and killer location. Spine Chill is good for covering your ass, but I find Empathy, Bond or Alert all offer good awareness of killer location in different ways. Empathy let's you follow the second half of chases easily, Alert let's you see where chases pause/stop, and Bond gives less awareness but much more team-based awareness so it balances a bit. 
---
Like you, I ran BL, Urban and Self-Care for a while. I found BL and urban it be too situational (bl only works on certain maps, even less with the upcoming nerf, and urban is less useful against certain maps/killers). Self-Care can be be, but running something that lets you find teammates like bond or Empathy, or another healing perk like Inner Strength, offers much more value. It's important to note how much time is wasted with Self-Care. I didn't really pay attention at first but after focusing on it I just felt so useless sitting there healing for ages while the game plays out around me. I recommend paying attention to this and seeing how you feel. If it still feels worth it then run it, but it's probably a good idea to test others and see if you like those better.

Because Friday the 13 can’t get new content? It’s not rocket science lmao. I’m here cuz this game at leafs gets new stuff. Don’t be a dummy, use your noggin
---
I only have mobile apps to edit with :,)
---
How? All Nemesis does is switch obsession and reveal for 5 seconds.
---
What
---
Ghostface is your best bet.
---
I was asking how is wraith balanced from a Killer's perspective. Unless a killer is seen as balanced on both sides, it's unbalanced.
---
It has nothing to do with Legion being too strong. Even old broken Legion wasn't OP by a kills per game standard because the rest of the survivors could gen rush while 1 or 2 dudes get moon walked. The problem is the lack of counter play. 
---
Old DS wasn't crazy OP especially if you had on enduring, but it was lame as shit for killers to deal with. Legion needs a buff, but this isn't the way to do it. Legion needs a rework.
---
The feeling when not even winning it was an enjoyable match
---

---
Where did spirit and nurse go? Are they on vacation?

Still not gonna stop me from running Iron Will tho. Once you don’t hear it, you can’t go back. Kinda like dead silence in COD

Hey chief next time you post a post-game picture blur out the names of the other players. Common courtesy and all that

Haven’t played Vs him, but I definitely hope his power becomes a little more dodge able.
---
Yeah I’ve seen my friend make killers disconnect because he’s good at looping them and is always laughing as I watch in the distance working on a generator and you see the killer pause a moment before the screen turns black lol
---
Yeah actually I did suck a dick today, it's my boyfriends birthday. Come on, your insults are lackluster at best.
---
Don't you fucking dare complain about Billy. One moan about killers on this subreddit and it spreads like wildfire.
---
The only thing I dislike about the official model is how stupidly huge his hands are. They look like inflated doctors gloves
---
Seeing more ghostfaces than every other killer combined atm. I got excited when I saw gen grabber spirit the other day purely because it was something different. Not even gonna get into whether he’s OP or not but it’s just obnoxious playing against the same thing every game.
---
Sounds like fun
---
Myers is personally not that big. Nick Castle was 5'10 and the mask is pretty close to the 1978 mask
---
The fan made model looks worse in my opinion
---
Groovy.
---
FORCEJEAR
---
One survivor from Left 4 Dead is enough. It'd be overkill if they added more.
---
Besides, Claudette's already got a Rochelle outfit.
---
H...how?
---
Straight up useless. Nurses nerf and huge ass fetigue also spirit slow as fuck speed on her power is just sad to watch
---
Needed an 8 minute video to show us how to bank bloodpoints?...
---
Nah man Billy is probably the fairest killer imo.  I still hate spirit though.
---
I find it so tiring. I spend however long just finding a match just for the killer to DC from ruin breaking
---
Reasonable. I agree wholeheartedly
---
"stop asking for nerfs!!!!"
---
I bring franklins 24/7 that alone gets me dcs
---
cause dbd gone wild
---
On console survivor queues take forever because playing killer sucks.
---
On PC killer queues take forever because I assume playing survivor sucks.
---
m1 killers are like wraith and legion.
---
He is an m1 killer till he hits ONE person ONE time. then he is uncountable when he has his power.
---
Exactly my point.
---
It’s intentional; it’s so it’s more clear what addons he’s running.
---
They just put Terminator in the latest Mortal Kombat game.
---
It's not likely by any means, but I don't imagine it's off the table.
---
At least Freddy is a god now
---
Legion and plague only have to hit a person one time too
---
lore fetish?

Thanks😘

username checks out

Thoes are the people I hate just let me heal you or the ones that will run away just to self-care and not let you heal them
---
Please gimme
---
I would put all of them on
---
I think they usually try to balance with "obsession = bad for survivor" so palette stunning being punished makes sense.  I don't see it being that bad of a perk, strong on Myers for sure.  Not sure why people are going crazy about it on Legion though.
---
Wel yea
---
Imagine negan as a killer holy fuck next level

The blood is fine but those lips mate lol. 
---
Does he have them black people big lips because daamn lol.
---
Yess
---
Yeah I should probably fix that 😂
---
Blood orbs do disappear after a while. It's quite a long time, but they do indeed disappear.
---
It doesn’t really fit into DBD’s theme, honestly.
---
Have you seen clown tho. Dbd has everything to do with sexuality.
---
billy, hag, demogorgon, nurse, or basically any killer with good mobility. I also had a good game today where i got 2 moris with devour hope as huntress, so it could really work with anyone.
---
That’s true, if you get into it again it’s worth watching but it’s hard when season 7 comes around but if you push through season 9 was really good
---
I guess you are right. Even tho, I still want Jason in dbd and maybe 90% of horror fans do.
---
Pretty much this. Because fuck no we can’t have a good killer to have fun and enjoy our time, we need to suffer 10000 nerfs before release just so precious survivor mains would be happy, while shit like AD or decisive stays in game for years. Sure why not. 
---
Come at me, entitled surv mains. You know I’m right.
---
I don't use those survivor perks
---
I somehow think he would be the ultimate challenge, and I totally see him being the final killer honestly. He would have to be hardest killer to challenge in the game but then again... people would probable be screaming nerfs so I think if he is added, they would have to do something special to ensure he doesn't become the only killer you ever see.
---
its a good idea, i wouldn't end up using them but that doesnt mean they shouldnt be in the game.
---
As I said, the game would still survive, but if we get Jason, maybe this game could be way better and way popular.
---
It's "Thanks for the game. "
---
I dont get it
---
I did it with Spirit, it was pretty easy. Managed to get 2\~3 grabs per match
---
Swf destroy everything
---
I remember a game where I went into the basement just to get the chest, all of a sudden it turned into a 3 man hook in the basement with me hiding in a locker
---
I just wanted that chest man
---
There are only 3 good dbd streamers (true, Otzdarva and Monto) and, oh would you look at that. They laugh at the devs for clearly trying to make survivors a powerrole.
---
repost
---
I had thought about the muting notifications/getting rid of lights as well! Definitely a good alternative.
---
*stabs janitor* Obviously not.
---
As someone that plays off and on, but hits red ranks on both sides consistently, I would love any reward that goes toward this insane grind.
---
Execpt the difference is that legion and plague are just m1 killers after they use there power, there power is to just injure you and thats it. they have counters.
---
The oni isnt an m1 killer. He starts off weak, but as soon as he hits one person he gains his snowball.
---
He is basically a billy chainsaw on command with extra mobility and a 20000% more deadly.
---
Looks very much like part 4 and 5 Michael, that is to say, like shit
---
The fan made is the COD version
---
Don't wiggle and I will set you free. - Trapper
---
And why is him hitting a person once with no power any different from legion or plague?
---
newest one i thino
---
Read title
---
Yikes. Had a bad day? 
---
What a hell of an exaggeration comparing a map on the lobby to showing who the killer and what perks are being used. 
---
If some killers are total shit on certain maps there is a very big problem with how it all works. And those who DC will get shat on after the next update. I also didn't say i take the ranking system seriously, i said that i have no idea if BHVR does. If not that's another problem. 
---
Either way the game has tons of potential for being strategic and competitive but the potential will probably go to waste so the best way to enjoy this game is accept the limitations and treat it as a super casual game.
---
#New Location: Silent Hill
---
##The Pyramid Head
---
*Music: [Chase](https://youtu.be/WShknpNpHbY)*
---
###Primary weapon: Great Knife
---
###Ability: Strangle
---
The Pyramid Head grabs a Survivor by **tapping the Power button**. Once the Survivor is in The Pyramid Head's grasp, he begins choking them. The Survivor will be faced with a skill check, giving them an opportunity to escape. If they succeed, they free themselves, but are put into the Injured state. **Strangle** has less range than The Pyramid Head's standard attacks, but can bypass the Injured health state, if the Survivor **fails** the skill check. If a Survivor is already in the Injured state, they will not be given a skill check, and The Pyramid Head can carry them to a hook immediately.
---
###Passive: Terrorize
---
The Pyramid Head's presence is so distressing to Survivors, that repairing generators and using items takes **10% longer** while inside his Terror Radius. This ability scales with Survivor perks that buff repair and item-consumption speeds.
---
###Perks
---
**Creature of the Fog**
---
You have a way of getting inside the minds of your victims. If a Survivor is rescued from a hook, they are afflicted with the **Dread** status effect for **60 seconds**. While this effect is active, the Survivor takes **5/10/15%** longer to use items and repair generators.
---
**Exhilarating Hunt**
---
You are aroused by the thought of tormenting the sinful. After putting a Survivor into the Injured state, gain a **25%** bonus to Bloodpoints in all categories, to a maximum of **50/75/100%**, for each consecutive time you put a Survivor into the Injured state. Hooking a Survivor or putting them into the Dying state stops the chain, meaning you must put another Survivor into the Injured state before you can continue gaining Bloodpoint bonuses.
---
**Deliverer of Punishment**
---
You can sense the hope building in your prey. When a Survivor is hooked, the aura of any other Survivor within **8/10/12 meters** of them is revealed.
---
##James Sunderland
---
*Music: [Lobby](https://youtu.be/6LB7LZZGpkw)*
---
**Promise**
---
You have vowed to protect one Survivor. Their aura is revealed to you at all times, and you heal them **25%** faster than normal. Additionally, you gain a **6/8/10%** repair speed bonus while working on generators with this Survivor.
---
**Repentance**
---
You are determined to reconcile the sins of your past. For every Survivor you fully heal, gain a **25%** bonus to Bloodpoints in all categories, to a maximum of **50/75/100%.**
---
**Escape Artist**
---
You perform well under pressure. While being chased, pallets are highlighted through surfaces, and you can drop them **5/10/15%** faster.
---
Honestly since they're doing something with it, Haddonfield must be the upcoming map rework. Probably will get variations like Bedlam.
---
Why should you? Its not a fighting game, you’re not supposed to win ANY killer in 1v1, thatsnot the point of the game, otherwise all killers would be Legion level.
---
Is plague's ability considered "magical"? If it is, I don't think she really reached a breaking point like the rest of them.
---
Well if he was the last killer he would probably be slightly weak, since the entity would be starving
---
As awesome as it would be it won’t happen due to the fallout they had back in 2015 I believe which is why Silent Hill pt wasn’t released and finished.
---
It won’t happen sadly man, silent hill will die.
---
A skillcap? Literally just whip your mouse and you hit them. That isnt skill.
---
Just do bones bro lol
---
More popular, probably. Way better? That's a stretch.
---
This is how he counters borrowed time
---
Fuck licensing... Seriously. I guess I'm hoping Konami is willing to whore out their IPs for some cash. It beats letting a franchise just rot in a Pachinko machine.
---
Also, you were so fast to reply, I hadn't even add my concept in XD. Feel free to check it out.
---
I play on console and see it constantly. I would say in at least 1/3 of my games at rank 8. NOED usually doesn't cause me to die because I assume the killer has it every game and plan according That being said, I have had games where the killer has done nothing all game but get clowned, happens to be in a chase as the last gen pops with someone already on the hook and ends up getting kills they absolutely didn't earn because of NOED. NOED inflates killer stats and helps bad killers climb ranks.
---
Oh that's why they nerfed insta heals, BNPs, exhaustion perks, BL, pallet amounts, pallet vaccums, flashlights, MoM, vaulting, hook sabotaging, healing speeds and other survivor stuff. It was all to make the survivor side stronger! Enjoy your next True stream dude.
---
Good to know you like to do them.
---
Just don't cry when survivors "gen rush" or "excessively loop" you (actual strategies that you killers love to complain about, as opposed to tunnelling and camping which are conscious dick head choices).
---
It's not. Console players have already adjusted to their fps. They know how to play, it won't change anything other than pc survs might perform slightly better than console survs same with killers. But that doesn't mean much considering it's your teammate
---
The thing is you're facing super low ranks which is why it's working for you. It gets harder when a couple have decisive and make you waste your own time camping.
---
Just restart the system.
---
Delete swf its the Best thing for this game
---
110 ruins his already bad early game. The issue isn't that his early game is too fast, it's that once he has his power there's very little a survivor can do to be safe short of not playing the game and hiding in a corner. Making his early game take longer doesn't really resolve that issue, it just delays it and leaves everyone unsatisfied.
---
Some sort of drawback to his charge, like a short cooldown, would be a lot better
---
Why are you proud of being a camper/tunneler, that's such a dick move to be proud of
---
they basically did this but with legion
---
If they did that they could be sued due to the main 2 people splitting up. But I’ll check out the concept.
---
It makes the game literally so much easier idk how yall losing
---
She looks adorable and spooky at the same time.
---
poor babie.
---
Ive been playing oni with controller and have no issue, just took some adjustment.
---
yeah when he gets released i think in gonna fix that for myself after
---
Guess that works too, I've just been telling people to restart the system.
---
Skill Check powers that can down you aren’t really fun it’s like hitting decisive strike. Plus anyone good at hitting greats on a generator will be good at making this killer have no power. 
---
Then everyone will try becoming better making his power useless in high ranks.
---
I mean, it might be smart against the Oni though.

We don't
---
Nurse is strongest and leatherface is weakest
---
Nah, you way to ugly
---
What were you trying to look up that you didn't find?
---
If you can provide examples of these things, I can bring it up with the editors and see if we can change something.
---
Yeah, it's an utter shame. Silent Hill was among the greatest survival horror franchises ever. It took the Resident Evil formula, and perfected it. I can't believe Konami would shit on an artist as gifted as Hideo Kojima.
---
No. This doesn't fit the theme in any way, shape or form. There's nothing in the game involving sexuality at all. Nothing. 
---
I'm not against the community, but bright pink and blue pride icons don't fit amongst the backdrop of dark murders and flashlight teabagging.
---
It's still Nurse. It will always be Nurse. It will never not be Nurse. A thousand years from now ancient aliens will descend to a ruined earth and dig up DBD and discover that yep, still Nurse.
---
But it's a lot easier to steamroll with Spirit.
---
For curiosity sake, what sensitivity would you suggest then for controller?
---
Next you’ll say “What now?”
---
I feel like I'm one of the few people left who main Ghost Face and don't sit in a corner with Night Shroud active
---
Well, Frank wouldn't do such a thing!
---
That escalated quickly
---
he has an upcoming cosmetic that's almost fully shirtless
---
Yes, people don't seem to realize the last gen and the exit gates are the most difficult part for the survivors, adrenaline is basically a trump card that negate this. As a killer the most important thing is to not tilt if you are getting genrushed, it is impossible to avoid this, but the end game is always the make or break it moment.
---
Well, i tried that. It just didn’t work for me
---
Maybe once DBD is on mobile Konami will take the bait. Only really care about their mobile and pachinko games.
---
When I can't even  play the game and getti tunneled right away for 5 straight games in a row tell me why I want to stay
---
My g this is sick!
---
Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
---
You can do flicks of different degrees, so you need to turn at the right angle to hit em. Plus it feels so much more badass
---
Yeah, it's disgusting. I don't get how they managed to out-EA EA. That takes unprecedented levels of greed and obliviousness.
---
Not exactly, sensing the despair of survivors noticing iridescent head descending on them is making the Whispers in my head very aroused
---
Continue the onslaught. Destroy. Them. All!
---
More like Michael and Hillbilly.
---
Because you cleanse the totem and then your unexpecting team mates suddenly get downed and proceeds to get angry and then close the game. That's why lol
---
It was in 2 i think they show the cops looking at the costume that anybody could buy in the store. Its still in the bag.

I was scrolling and I saw this and the title nearly gave me a heart attack

Simply answer is just humanity is like that.
---
Was pretty good with her on console. I was able to contend with purp and sometimes red rank survivors, but these changes have made her utterly unplayable. I'd have to play her on an alt account if I were to even try and enjoy her.
---
No dude I believe ash dont need his weapons to defeat the killers
---
I don't like meg but I like the mask.
---
The poor caretaker... I fear his duties have... Affected him.
---
Many have fallen, not this one. Not this one today.
---
Does everyone end with 4 leftover Putrid Serum? Why is that?
---
She didn't deserve a nerf at all. She was already the easiest killer to counter.
---
He'd roar back
---
The drawback to his charge I posted is a much harder to control dash, making it more like the saw allowing him to use it more for distance than kill potential as it is now.
---
The 110 may be a bit much i'd agree, but I feel slowing down that early game may be crucial as once he gets those first few hits he can snowball pretty fast especially if hes lucky in survivor placement.
---
I really enjoy his potential as a break all the rules kind of killer, and really appreciate his role, I hope they dont nerf him too much
---
Lmao are you mad?
---
Scream lol
---
100% both sides. It might feel off for a newbie, but for those who aren't new and haven't had it set to 100 will quickly adjust. Anything below 100 and you're probably not performing as well as you can be.
---
Maybe, with enough ale and beer, they can be innoculated against the horrors below
---

When you go into basement and they have territorial but it's ghostface
---
Completely my bad. I most likely won't post again though but if I do I will.
---
Gasping, reeling, taken over the edge of madness (damn you wine man you took my dismas ;-;)
---
are you even listening?
---
A man living on the edge, and dangerously
---
The hag and spirit ones are easy but the nurse one is going to be a pain in the ass
---
Watch. Your. Step.
---
Again, why is it differht. They all just need one hit without a power.
---
I think he's a better Billy. While Oni's is only high for blood fury, it's much better than Billy's. I'm also positive demon strike against a pallet is much shorter and less predictable than hillbilly sawing a pallet mid chase, which can help you gain on a survivor who may not be expecting it or if there's no pallets and vaults around immediately.
---
At first i would agree with you but the more y played the more i started thinking, "dude, you can fill the spaces while doing challenges" so you are always doing 2x1 and then just by playing normally  you get even more, because you know, you play the game because you like it, just like before there was this whole rewards deal. And when the new levels unlock you get a boost in your rift incomings
---
u/xxnailbunnyxx
---
Even high ranks can farm off hook when the killer is camping, especially if they're in a SWF.
---
Shit I wonder where all the feet freaks are.
---
Thee's no hatch. It's just three people looking at a computer.
---
What does this have to do with anything? Sure it would be nice but sexuality doesn’t fit in DBD at all.
---
He has no counterplay,end of story
---
Using something in a video game isn't being a dick. If you're singling a person out JUST because of something they did to you, that is being a dick.
---
Thats pretty much how every survivor main want all killers to be, because how dare they not win a match in 3 minutes and instead actually face a challenge, unacceptable!
---
From what I can tell survivors keep their remaining stalk % even through obsession switching. If someone's full red when they stun you, they'll stay full red. It's just that when they are your obsession you get to deplete their stalk meter much, much faster. You have to be a little tactical about it to keep the obsession on the person with the most stalk remaining but it's not too hard to pull off in practice.
---
No no at the point farthest from any objective.....
---
He's 1 inch from the edge.
---
the funny thing is he isnt self aware enough to realize he's at rank 13
---
R/dbdgonewild says differently
---
Oni
---
That's what I mean, singling someone out is a dick move, I understand if they t-bag or flashlight spam but to repeatedly tunnel and camp then post all proud of it without saying if the survivors did anything at all is being a dick
---
I'm docking your House 10 points because the proper trashtalk is "lmao u mad?"

Do you wear heels?
---
I hardly ever see her on Xbox.
---
Man, the cutesy art style mashes surprisingly well with the gore. I honestly adore this.
---
👍
---
I want a Vacationer Bill. It'd be out of character but sort of make sense what with the L4D1 survivors' goal to be to get to the Florida Keys. Some nice cargo khaki shorts, flip flops, a hawaiian button-up, and a bucket hat.

It is alright, welcome to Reddit of Dead By Daylight! Sadly, devs on here have already confirmed that Carl was already dead :(

Lol. You wont be pulling stunts like this a few ranks down.

---
its def not the worst idea, if its for charity then its good. it doesnt fit sure but most of the cosmetics dont fit. Like the twitch cosmetics, or the joke cosmetics.
---
i think the issue is that people will get upset that they are not represented 100%, it may lead to the devs being harassed. 
---
I dont think its a bad idea, but the LGBT community is known for harassment. and i think its good to just, stay out of it. I think maybe adding a trans character or somthing would be cute though
---
Women and men; soldiers and outlaws; fools and corpses. All will find their way to us now that the road is clear.
---
I forgot this game has these big babies.
---
Wraith looks so pleased!
---
Honestly the strongest part of the dash, in a loop, isn't the control but the flick lunge you can pull at the end. Removing that would remove part of what makes him unique and fun though.
---
Right now you can start the dash then realize you're a bit far, cancel, then start it up when you're on the other side of loop. Implementing some short cooldown or even a power charge cost on startup means you have to commit to your dash. If you're good you can still do just fine, but if you're bad or fuck up or are baited then the survivor would and should have room to punish you for it.
---
The real core issue is his power, not his early game. Extending his early game, again, just delays but fails to actually address what isn't fun in playing against him.
---
Either way however they nerf his power they could and should pair it with a reduction to how much power you lose when you pick some one up, that way you aren't obliged to slug or be punished. Slugging should be a killer's tactical decision, being obliged to slug is boring as fuck.
---
They can but a good team wont. Camp one survivor expect a borrowed time decisive strike play if possible and the gens being done very quickly.
---
Legion and plague are irridescent purchasable on switch, but I didn’t know that the others were dlc. Also dbd mobile? That’s gotta be hard
---
BHVR already said they’re not making a killer who can fake being a survivor
---
He would be quite boring in comparison if they removed it
---
I've been working on her on ps4. You don't see it much because she has a high learning curve and getting bullied while learning is pretty frustrating and a big deterrent. Every few games I have to switch to Billy with a mori to keep my cool lol.
---
Hes mad alright
---
He sounds mad
---
Well she kinda did, she was the head of a super religious church with no solution to the plague. But she didn’t have a mass murder breaking point. She had a mental breaking point.
---
Curious is the trapmaker's art. His own efficacy unwitnessed by his own eyes.
---
"This is so wrong"
---
Bullying, vandalism and theft? No, not those guys. They're just a social club that occasionally get together to chat about current events.
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
I disagree, I do decent again purple ranks still with current nurse. She is harder to play but if you conserve your blinks and make sure they count she is still viable.
---
What the hell why are their auras showing?
---
Dark Devotion or Tinkerer is your only chance without farming
---
&gt;Vandalism
---
Show me one thing they vandalised! This is spirit main propaganda
---
Most killers play as if all survivors run ds
---
Most will end up here, covered in the poisoned earth, awaiting merciful oblivion.

Keep your gender ideology politics out of video games.
---
Admins can we get this taken down thanks
---
I'm pretty sure those paper balls used to be paper sheets. Also... Where did they get paper? I smell theft here too.
---
Ah yes and don't forget the lovely point where the killer does start going after one of them, so someone runs up, fails to unhook you while the killers gone, hide again, come back (killer's still gone), and then unhook you right in front of the killer so you can run ten meters to the opened exit gate alone cause no one's willing to tank a hit even though the killer doesn't have NOED until you get smacked and rehooked. I remember this ever so clearly.
---
The difference is that after legion and plegue hit you with there power, they cant do shit to you.
---
The Oni gains his power from injured people, he can gain it from one person meaning the insta down works on everyone. Its not like legion or plague where he just gets an insta down and thats it. No.
---
he gains massive amounts of mobility and map pressure, He breaks pallets WAY to fast so you have no way to actually avoid him even if you are injured/un injured.
---
THAT'S THE FAULT OF SHIT MAO DESIGN WHERE PROBLEMS ALREADY EXIST AND ARE MERELY EXACERBATED BY BALANCED LANDING
---
BL ITSELF IS NOT THE SOURCE OF THE ISSUE, NOW IT'S UNUSABLE
---
It's not vandalism if they bought the paper themselves for like, 2 bucks
---
You have plenty of ways to avoid him but ok
---
Whenever I go against a Ghost Face, I usually try to keep him in the periphery of my vision as to monitor him without revealing myself.
---
Save The best for Last: every time you hit anyone other than the obsession you get a token up to a maximum of 8 each token reduces your attack cooldown
---
Dying Light:every time you hook anyone other than the obsession gain a token each token reduces survivor action speeds
---
Play with your food: every time you lose your obsession in a chase gain a token each token ups your speed
---
How are you able to make the spirit so cuuuute! I love her so much!
---
Console probably needs its own build, honestly. Flicking your view to check corners and do red glow mind games is hard enough with a mouse. I'm not even sure survivors are playing the same game over there as we are. Nothing personal.
---
You foolishly think yourself seperate from the whole. You're wrong, and I! WILL! SHOW YOU!
---
I actually agree with this lol. Make his sprint harder to control with a small cool down and make his area of effect limited to one hit per survivor. Also tho i think no mither should counter him. As it is it makes blood orbs and it shouldn't imo.
---
Hey, thats cute and im sorry for myself that i hadnt thought of that.
---
Yeah I'd support it,
---
Two whole shiny loonies? You know those Canadian boys are too broke for that.
---
Ghostface x lery's is how i got mine
---
"... and that kids is why you should always make sure to do your gens."
---
*They hate him for telling the truth!*
---
This. I didn't feel like struggling forever on it.
---
On ps4 I have seen her way more now with the changes and a lot of them pretty damn good
---
I'm just saying complaints about spirit are mostly justified.  I've never even seen anyone complain about Billy.  Except for this random jobrony you replied to.
---
Thicc thighs save mens lives
---
That's not even fan-made. That's Michael from CoD: Ghosts.
---
Most campers are a Leatherface, Hag, or Billy. The unhooker would get downed immediately with two of those killers, meaning there was no point unhooking.

It'll work for anyone, it's just that the obsession has a further range.
---
Hahaha, excellent. Thanks for the info! Can't wait to see that awful perk show up in my bloodweb instead of chili over and over :D
---
Julie had money, Joe had money, Susie could afford her own stuff
---
Oh nothing seems wrong, wait was was that? Oh? Oh, oh no...
---
No.
---
That's just busted I mean it's impossible to catch them off guard and they'll always know when your coming.
---
These are some of the best cosmetics for a killer I’ve ever seen. Hope to see more high quality cosmetics for our other killers.
---
You might be right! Having variations would be a dream come true.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I wonder what kind of changes they made that prevents being able to enter certain buildings, though...
---
I'll come back for the last panel in 9 days. ;)
---
It’ll feel more complete without Jason as good as it is it’s still missing something.
---
Billy is the type of Killer where his power can feel frustrating since it's a one-shotter, but him getting kills with that power is pretty much all about positioning.  He also gets crippled pretty hard in the indoor maps where he can't just zoom from one end to the other.
---
With some of the cosmetics I understand. But base appearance Nea looks like a fucking ape. And Meg isn’t too bad.
---
Ah damn I didn’t know that

Behold the heart of the world! Progenitor of life, father and mother, alpha and omega! Our creator... And our destroyer.

---
I get tunneled all the time, I just run the killer around, and it's so that you get the bloodpoints, you don't screw over your team or the killer, and the game just isn't full of DCs, when you play killer, and someone DCs, do you like that? Because that's how you're making someone else feel when you do so, and do say the whole "I don't care about other people's fun," as your excuse because I've already listed reasons for people who only care about themselves.
---
Fine then, name em.
---
The poor Miller. Thrice the victim. The blight stole his crops. I stole his land. And uncountable years later... The comet took his very Humanity.
---
She was wearing the shorts with the American Flag top wasn’t she? Love that combo.
---
I have the exact same reaction when I get a mori daily.
---
Sadly, tsundere isn't the LAST thing I'd apply to Spirit.
---
I wouldn't call it a breaking point, the only time you could think there was a breaking point is when it mentions that she made one last prayer before being taken.
---
I used to think Nea was Claudette because it sounds like a black name to me.
---
Lockers. He can't cancel his attack so he will have to use his attack cooldown.
---
Windows as long as you move to the side.
---
Jukes. He still has a cooldown and charge time.
---
Stuns with pallets.
---
He's exactly like hillbilly
---
Yuh whoever downvoted this smh, you do you bro, thanks for making such a good meme
---
Oni-chan is best gurl
---
Eh, cosmetics are a way for players to personalise themselves in game, to build their look and character to reflect themselves and their aesthetic.
---
Adding pride cosmetics lets those wanting to express their pride do so, refusing to add them is refusing to let those express their pride.
---
All in all, theyre cosmetics, this is their purpose.
---
Nurse, Billy, Ghost Face, Freddy, and Spirit are currently the top tier killers.
---
Claudette can literally wear a miniature of herself. 
---
Charms hit the ground running not giving a damn about fitting the theme of the game.
---
That's how it was worded. I think killer gets more XP.
---
But that also doesn’t answer it. Where does the exp come from, emblems, time or is it a set amount?
---
&gt;In the video he says that in a 1v1 chase he has no counter,
---
So like any other killer if you do not consider pallets a counter?
---
mmmm feet
---
uh? that “fan-made” model looks exactly like the Michael Myers from CoD Ghosts 
---
also it looks worse
---
Well if the survivors are playing slightly better and youre killer but I agree it wont have some crazy impact
---
That’s because if companies don’t say something about LGBT, they’re seen as a company that doesn’t support gays and whatnot, and they get attacked for it.
---
That would be sadddddddddd
---
I legitimately think it was because they assumed it would be a racist stereotype that the black girl would be good at running away. i.e. sporty girl with Sprint Burst and Adrenaline is black.
---
I assume time in a match.
---
It'll just mean console players will have to get better to make up for it.
---
I'm pretty sure it's time spent in the game up to a certain cap(I wanna say 600 or 800 but I'm not sure) and there's a little extra depending on emblem quality :)
---
Looks like a Tarantino movie
---
Stalk progression stays until hit or downed, it takes a moment to break his power rather than an instant, which an experienced player can conceal behind cover quickly to prevent it, and finally, the loud af noise he produced was removed to make him quieter. Certain builds make him a better wraith when you don't stalk.
---
A recent update made stealth killers gain the undetectable status effect, which is basically what Myers EW1 was, meaning ppl can't abuse Object of Obsession on killers like Ghost Face anymore.
---
Thanks bro
---
THESE FUCKING WAIT TIMES MAKE ME WANT TO BALANCE LANDING OFF THE FUCKING EMPIRE STATE BUILDING
---
Ya but theres nothing related to sexuality in the game why even bring it into it is the point?
---
How dare they have different priorities than you, amirite? Yeah, rank rewards would be nice, but I think it’s fair it takes a backseat to some more important issues
---
So just run around as long as possible... then escape. Lol. 
---
Exp based on time and not skill, that sounds fun. -.-
---
Ha ha I wasn’t. I think anyone who comes in to “speed run” with whatever is wasting everyone’s time, including theirs.
---
I mean, the uglier the better. The Hag ain't exactly a sight for sore eyes and neither is the plague
---
Player XP is earned from game time (1 second = 1 XP.) , your highest emblem will be a bonus XP 18 for red 15 for gold 12 for silver, and 300 XP for first game of the day.
---
Bloodpoints are earned easier with killers. But player XP I dont think it matters.
---
Every 800XP gets you one rift token thing
---
Someone did a whole math thing for the whole pass today if you search you might find it
---
I will say the reveal phase can be really wonky and inconsistent, which leads some to dislike Ghost Face because of that issue. I believe the devs said they would fix that eventually though.
---
You get one xp for every second in a match, with a cap at ten minutes, but you get 300 bonus xp for your first survivor and killer games each day
---
This is Darkest dungeon if you heretics don't know
---
I wish I had Jeff, his corpse paint is so badass
---
should i main tapp or ace? i don't wanna use iron will so i can use something else. I'm guessing Ace makes less noise but Tapp is harder to see
---
Do you wear skin?
---
New skin: Kawaii Spirit
---
Because he was ABSOLUTELY DESTROYING LOW RANKS.
---
Imagine thinking only high rank gameplay matters.
---
So it’s confirmed time? Lame. 
---
Oooohhhh well. Not like I really needed a reason to play all day anyway.
---
Yeah, just with an explanation with the Archives implemented now and all and how they can be used.
---
Absolutely. Way way more fun to crush people’s hopes and dreams while running some downright worthless perks/addons. Just so you can sit there and be like “I’m a god to these mortals”
---
uh yes I do
---
Holy loving fuck this is peak fragility.
---
No you dont
---
Tbh people are dicks enough in the community and youd just get bullied for having those
---
I’ve been getting that with a lot of killers on PS4 but not my PC. Dunno why
---
Yeah when wraith cloaks he loses the chase and bloodlust so it wouldn’t count unfortunately
---
Myers was the standar for balance two years ago, now? He is outdapted and needs a buff/rework
---
My usual killer experience is waiting in a 30 minute queue to GET this game. Also it's on Haddonfield.
---
They were probably swf so fuck those guys. Running solo requires different perks and some people dont get that. Urban is a good solo perk, like self care. Dont take it to personally.
---
IF A KILLER JUMPS OFF OF SOMETHING CARRYING A SURVIVOR THEY SHOULD DROP THE SURVIVOR!!!!
---
Prob could be fixed by initiating another skill check. I once had this but for a reunited bp reward, once I got another it went away
---
Platform: PC/PS4  
---
Type of bug: In game  
---
Description: Disconnect when starting an action as a survivor.  
---
I'm not too sure the circumstances around this bug, at first I thought it was my internet connection, but then it happened to my partner on PS4, and I watched a Jake in game just disconnect as soon as jumping on a gen. This is a disconnect that is causing me to lose rank and items as if I have left the game myself.
---
it did!! :) I just thought it was funny, first time it's happened to me
---
Freddy is not invisible anymore
---
Yeah it's just people blaming their loss on someone else. I'm a solo red rank and that shit happens to me too.
---
But why? I have your idea, but I'd like some reasoning, if you could.
---
xD
---
Legion vaults a pallet and gets lung cancer!
---
I'm sorry that so many people here are being toxic, evennif they don't agree with what you're saying, at least disagree in a way that isn't "LoL yOuR oPiNiOn Is TrAsH aNd So ArE yOu!!!!!!!!"
---
Personally, I don't care what the killer runs, they're using their reaources and playing jow they want, it sucks to go against but sometimes in games there are things that suck to go against and you just have to deal with it. I personally never run it, but who cares if you run it, let's stop our pissing and moaning because the devs won't change it, there are just things that are really good in games. So to the people that are always toxic when someone tries to defend NOED, screw off.
---
I dunno man, clown always wants his thumbs up anyway.
---
*thumbs up his ass-*
---
A true beauty. Thanks for sharing this in the thread mate.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one crying over the god awful sensitivity limit in this game.
---
Cackles in prayer beads
---
Lol I’m watching ptb gameplay and I’m saying to myself ‘damn I’m screwed’
---
Why?
---
Same thing happened to me today!!
---
"Wow, that perk WORKS sometimes?!"
---
The only problem I could see is if they’ve all been hooked multiple times and you haven’t because of stealth, at that point it’s best to stop hiding and draw aggro so hopefully they can also survive.  But other than that no reason to hate ppl who use urban.
---
"No one in DbD can jump"
---
*glances at Little Mac*
---
True
---
Literally had 3 people DC on me as Freddy, and one of them messaged me to tell me Freddy’s trash. Like. It’s a game. Get good or get over it.
---
Some people feel the need to bring their sexuality into every single aspect of their life. It's like their entire identity revolves around it.
---
It’s known glitch that came in when the onu came out my guess guess is that it has to do with their re-works on the pallets because of the new perk
---
SWF are awful. They want you to save their ass but when you need them, they just leave you to die and save their friend first, who still only in the first stage of hook.
---
or it could just not have any effect on deep wounds, or make it un usable on legion
---
dead by daylight + antimemes = this post
---
I wouldn’t really care if they added this, but why would you want to show off your sexuality in a video game?
---
Hey I just said this a couple of hours ago! Cool

Killer is balanced bc the counter to him is the killer messing up. Interesting i swear i have heard this before with a different yamamoka.
---
Nice to the rank, unfortunate to your teammates. Hope you manage to find some good ones! Sometimes it seems to get harder to find good teammates the higher your rank is.
---
Yeah part of consoles whole "exclusive deal" like how you guys got doc hag for free
---
I'm saying anything you can do vs Billy works the same against oni
---
Yup pretty much
---
I removed the upvote.
---
Also I'll call an ambulance
---
They had been hooked, 2 dead and that was my first time on the hook when we had 1 gen left. I had been chased and hit multiple times, I just always managed to escape before he knocked me down.
---
What platform?
---
Survivors: Do a decent play
---
True: Optimal as hell survivors
---
I still have yet to meet a nice team of SWF but I hope they are out there!
---
Huh... I guess I just never noticed. Thanks!
---
Dude, don't argue with him, people like that won't change their minds for shit.
---
Fantastic work!
---
###Power: Strangle
---
The Pyramid Head's presence is so distressing to Survivors, that repairing generators and using items takes **20% longer** while within his Terror Radius. This ability scales with Survivor perks that buff repair and item-consumption speeds.
---
You have a way of getting inside the minds of your victims. If a Survivor is rescued from a hook, both they and the rescuer are afflicted with the **Dread** status effect for **60 seconds**. While this effect is active, affected Survivors take **10/20/30%** longer to use items and repair generators.
---
You are aroused by the thought of tormenting the sinful. Gain a **25%** bonus to Bloodpoints in all categories, to a maximum of **50/75/100%**, for each consecutive Survivor you put into the Injured state. Hooking or putting a Survivor into the Dying state stops the chain, meaning you must put another Survivor into the Injured state before you can continue gaining bonuses. *Good alternative to "Barbecue and Chili", especially for Killer builds that focus on keeping Survivors Injured.*
---
You have vowed to protect one Survivor. Their aura is revealed to you when they're within **30/35/40 meters**. Additionally, if you rescue this Survivor from a hook, they are granted a **10%** speed boost for **7 seconds**.
---
You are determined to reconcile the sins of your past. For every Survivor you fully heal, wake up, or mend, gain a **25%** bonus to Bloodpoints in all categories, to a maximum of **50/75/100%.** *Good alternative to "We're Gonna Live Forever".*
---
You perform well under pressure. While being chased, pallets are highlighted through surfaces, and you can vault over them **10/20/30%** faster.
---
###*If you'd like a concept for Maria, let me know!*
---
Very well done, internet stranger. 
---
My only suggestion for future drawings, since I see you're only using a pencil, try to lightly draw in your shadows, then smudge them with your finger. It kind of helps shadows blend and look a little better (in my opinion)

It's moderate at best, the only difficulty comes from dedicated servers making grabs ultra finicky

&gt;thinking that a Killer "main" can't be Survivor biased
---
Well he *is* a Texan
---
I understand that it might suck for those who lost their event cosmetics. But using that to argue why everyone should get the event cosmetics doesn't make sense unless they do the same thing with the legacy cosmetics. A lot of people lost their legacy and never got it back. Does that mean they should just hand legacy out to everyone? At the very least I expect the devs to be consistent with their reasoning behind what they decide should be exclusive and what shouldn't be exclusive.
---
I don't think they should be sold in the store either. If anything, these items could come back as rewards during those events in the future. That is the ideal compromise. I highly doubt it will happen though.
---
I HAVE 30 HOURS PLAYED ON DBD AT THIS POINT AND THE KILLER LET ME ESCAPE AT THE END OF A MATCH. GUY WITH 1350 HOURS TRASH TALKS ME BECAUSE HE SCORED 1.5K MORE POINTS THAN ME AND SAYS I'M USELESS
---
I MEAN, HE WOULD'VE DIED A LOT EARLEIR IF I HADN'T BOTHERED TO SAVE HIM AND I WOULDN'T HAVE NEEDED THE KILLERS HELP ESCAPING IF I HADN'T HELPED HIM, BUT YEAH, OK, WHATEVER, DUDE.
---
It's hilarious you'd say something like that in the same comment section you said you're only green rank, you're barely above baby survivor rank lmao.
---
Good point. But i dont think he is humanoid because his face opens up and has many rows of teeth inside his face. He can also track blood without a nose. Thats what I think

Ok, legion got a change about terror radius’ and deep wounds. Nemesis means ths next person who stuns you gains the oblivious status effect (meaning they dont get the terror radius) for 40 seconds. Using the two addons you basically make new legion old legion

Reddit be like this most of the time.😒 but thanks

I hate this glitch with a burning passion. So much time wasted as killer looking for an injured survivor
---
Don't feel bad. All the other times it was used are not as relevant as this one ,as it's actually reasonable to assume someone buys the wrong Yamaoka as opposed to someone forcing this meme by being like "oh yea, i wanted steve but i got spirit"??? Idk how that even became a thing, but this use of it is genuinely funny
---
I always feel bad for stomping beginners, if i notice them not looking back or running into walls i usually cut them some slack.
---
The oblivious lasts 45 seconds. So one you're oblivious all legion has to do is stab you twice with Frank's mixtape and now there's nothing you can do. You stop to mend they can smack you down, you run them around more you go down to bleed pretty quick.

I think one of them lowers how much time you have in DW when you get hit but I dont know which one or what the other one does. I'll have to ask my friend who is one of the last ten non toxic legions mains what they do.

It's more annoying seeing teammates waiting to save you than the killer camping.
---
Actually I wasn't. I would like to upload the image of the perks and ranks they were, but their rank was green. Also, I was a rank 7, im a Myers main and just played hag for the daily
---
Nope, they were actually green and rank reset was like 3 days ago
---
Rank reset was 8 days ago, the way you play isn't bad for points or anything but it's not fun for the survivors, it kinda takes the fun out of the game for them
---

---

---

---
Just like my sex life
---
I'm really not getting the idea here. I used a strategy, didn't let them save and attacked those that I thought that would be more important to the team our would be more fragile. I am a dick for not playing like a stupid?
---
I actually feel this is incorrect. In my killer rank 20 eyes he’s obviously underperforming because I can’t get a 4k without having to move my character. 
---
So I propose that he spends about 4 min screaming at the top of his lungs that all survivors hear no matter where they are, which applies a generator repair speed debuff. Each minute that passes makes repair speed decrease by 20%. 
---
At the end of the 4 min charge time the killer jumps in the air and nukes the entire map instantly killing all survivors and awarding everyone full BP, but only the killer gets pips.
---
If the survivors manage to finish all generators before the 4 min then legion, spirit and nurse get deleted from the game permanently.
---
Not a bad idea. Only thing that sucks is if youre slugging the 3rd guy for a 4k he would prolly always suicide so the 4th could get hatch. Or if someones salty theyd just suicide so you couldnt get any hook points.
---
People can just be really toxic. But it's apart of the game
---
She's an overzealous priestess who mutilated herself in the service of a god who didn't save her and, while infected, offered water and food to her followers. She gathered people around herself and very likely infected them too. She was convinced she'd be saved and, in the end, kinda was - her delusions led her to the Entity.
---
This kind of thing happened during the Black Death. Folks would do all sorts of uninformed shit to protect themselves, but in some cases actually spread it faster.
---
DCs should be punished. You are ruining the experience for other people so now you get your gaming experience taken away from you. I had three people DC against me as one perk agitation Trapper for hooking people in the basement. Doing a challenge is enough to get people to rage quit, people rage quit all the time for getting downed once. People DC because they got hit or got outplayed at a loop. It's not that there's bullshit, it's that there's this entitled as fuck "I'm not having fun so fuck you" mentality. Welcome to a pvp game, there's going to be times that will suck, you are going against someone else. Sometimes you lose, sometimes you get put on the backstep and have to play harder for that sweet comeback.
---
i imagine Myers is a slap bass enthusiast
---
Steve.
---
She could’ve had so much potential
---
It’s the cap. So if a player routinely has a million bloodpoints it’s because they don’t feel the need to spend points normally. I know people that have excessive amounts of every add on/offering/item on every killer and every survivor, bloodpoints hold no meaning to them. Sometimes they don’t even spend them when capped, just leave them because it doesn’t matter to them. That’s not every player by any means, but a lot of people just wouldn’t care about a bloodpoint reward because of how pointless it is once you’re past the grind.
---
Its all about positioning and pathing. If you get to a loop while the killers a bit farther behind you, you want to position yourself at the best line of sights so youll have more time to react if the counter rotate you. You also want to be mindful of where you are going to run next and what pallets have already been used etc.
---
*Howls in Jeff Johansen*
---
yeah i remember when this was funny

Then that's not being a dick. You're not tunneling or camping just because you can, you're doing it because it's a valid stategy.

Haha thanks! Love your work btw!
---
Does anyone feel as if he is in a form or way overpowered?
---
Gotta repost for that sweet karma smh
---
&gt; Ya but theres nothing related to sexuality in the game so why even bring sexuality into it is the point? 
---
True, simply true, bringing sexuality into it im not sure, perhaps specifically if the customers ask for it enough and it can be easy to implement.
---
&gt;  Also no ones refusing to add it 
---
Sadly, i knew i would get nitpicked for this, i didnt state thats its a "youre with us or against us" situation, basically, add them in? great, dont add them in because whatever? fine, but *refusing* to add them in? noooo, bad. If they simply dont give a shit, and like 3 other players care about it, they can mod them in or something onto charms, theyre only textures, but what i meant is if it was a reoccuring proposition from the community and BHVR just said "no we arent because we dont wanna" that is murky water.
---
For the most part, i agree with you, im simply stating that its a super minor thing for BHVR to do that would mean a super **big** thing to the people who care, so lets just see how many people care.
---
No thanks don’t need sexuality needlessly shoved down our throats in a game that has nothing to do with it. And honestly something that small would be a waste of time to add and a waste of money to buy.

this answer is so very good, I remember when noob3 started in youtube :')
---
&gt; Yikes. Had a bad day?
---
So just go ahead and undercut the entire thing before beginning to respond. Interesting.
---
&gt; What a hell of an exaggeration comparing a map on the lobby to showing who the killer and what perks are being used
---
An extrapolation it may be, but it does follow a sort of logical pattern based on the request, as well as your own response. If "that's how it usually is in games that involve loadouts", where does the ceiling come in, or is there even a ceiling? If we're gonna give access to that level of information, why stop at just the map?
---
&gt; If some killers are total shit on certain maps there is a very big problem with how it all works
---
Certain killers are shit on certain maps for a multitude of reasons. Giant maps make pressuring generators hard, and because generators go obscenely fast, even with Ruin up, you lose before you even have a chance to be a force. Maps with the current overabundance of strong tiles with pallets and windows galore make M1 killers shit because of how few brain cells it takes to loop them for an eternity. Again, a discussion for another topic.
---
&gt; I also didn't say i take the ranking system seriously
---
Then what do you call "It doesn't sit right with a ranking system" exactly? You may not be taking it completely seriously, but bringing up the issue of not seeing the map while referencing how it's not a good idea considering a ranking system, I don't know what other conclusion you hope to be drawn.
---
&gt; tons of potential for being strategic and competitive
---
Again, this isn't Call of Duty. This is supposed to be a survival horror game. The issues the game faces isn't about competitiveness. The issues facing the game are, and have been since release, the consistent neutering of killers, the increasing power of survivor with next to nothing for killers, and a complete lack of dynamics in terms of objectives, just to name a few.
---
This shouldn't be a Street Fighter type game, and you can't really turn this into an E-sport style of game because of its genre. Things like SWF already break the game into a completely unfair match, so unless killers suddenly became beyond overpowered, there's no hope there.
---
I know that's now what holding the game hostage. I just felt best way to describe it at the time because that's certainly how it feels to be a killer in that situation
---
New freddy is useful but lacks the pizzaz that old freddy had
---
I'd say my biggest gripe with DBD development is the lack of just plain damned numbers. There's no need to use vague language outside of the lore tooltips. Stop restricting information; all it does is make noobs even noobier
---
LMAO fucking golden
---
I use Pharmacy, but it's unreliable. You only get one full heal now, where pre-medkit nerf you got two. There's a limited amount of chests per game,  so if you're not fast, you'll miss your shot. It's better than Self Care, for sure, but Nancy's is even better.
---
I still don't know what they're supposed to mean and how long I just look at the colours
---
I hear crypt tv's "sunny family cult"  had partial influence.  I went on youtube and watched the supercut,  it's pretty good.
---
Whats with pepe on the left?
---
Got to be honest, I have to really force myself not to DC sometimes when I get looped really bad. Like you're supposed to be this murderous fearsome killer and you're just chasing somebody around a car five or six times like you're in a Tom and Jerry cartoon. May as well have the Benny Hill theme playing at that point it makes you feel like such a clown. Definitely not what I was expecting from this game when I started playing a couple months ago.
---
people are 4Heads with the downvote you are totally right tho. as much i hate it, there is a counterplay to it!
---
AND IT JUST HAPPENED AGAIN WHEN I USED AN ENVELOPE. THIS GAME IS TRASH
---
There was nothing fun about infinites. There was nothing fun about survivors having 100% balanced landing at all times. There was nothing fun about sprint burst coming back mid chase.
---
This is why you run Spine Chill.
---
Camping and tunneling is never bannable. Just ignore them. I think most killers are quilty of camping or tunneling from time to time when they're losing heavily and frustrated.  Especially when survivors are being dicks. Survivors who complain about being camped during egc are dumb babies.
---
\#RinsDadDidNothingWrong
---
You obviously haven't made it to high ranks. Sooner or later you'll realize that camping isn't a viable strategy against good survivors. Up your standards rather than settling for one kill.
---
I’m trying to find a solution myself. I archived the game and re-downloaded it to no avail. I deleted the game and am currently re-downloaded it again. 
---
Gonna restart the system yet. Let me know if you get a fix.
---
Lol enjoy your less than 600 bp and derank.
---
Ayyyyyoooooo that Dweet is unethical level of cute, 12/10 would mori
---
Despicable
---
He is, depends on the Range gap between the sruvivor and Freddy.
---
NO POST MORE AND NEVER STOP HES TOO DAMN CUTE
---
That's the same excuse as "Killers could use Whispers to stop survivors from holding the game hostage at exit gates before End Game Collapse update." Nah fam, Unbreakable, one and done. No Mither? Extremely bad down side.
---
Yeah urban is not shit by any means. It's actually very under rated. Believe it or not, stealth is a very efficient way to play. Sadly, you dont get rewarded for being stealthy in terms of points which I've been talking about for years now.
---
Isn’t the whole point of the PTB to give feedback before the patch hits the live servers?
---
Not everyone complaining about Oni played 1-2 matches against him and gave up and is crying for nerfs. 
---
Things like “i his turning radius is too much during his charge”, “i think his aoe hit cone is too wide”, or “i don’t think he should be able to see orbs through walls” are some suggestions the devs should consider. These aren’t my suggestions btw just a few examples to make a point. 
---
Feedback from **both** perspectives is important. Sure plenty of survivors have complained but ive seen a fair few killer mains call him a bit too strong as well. 
---
Ghostface and Spirit were terrible on the ptb and after some feedback were buffed to compensate. I could use the same argument for them you’re trying to make now “how about instead of crying for buffs you get good and learn how to play him” sounds real condescending doesn’t it? Now spirit is the 2nd best killer in the game atm and ghostface while not top tier is a pretty good killer in the right hands. 
---
Why is it when a killer is considered underpowered on the PTB asking for buffs is acceptable but if someone thinks a killer is too strong they’re told to “get good” and stop crying.
---
During EGC if you have not managed to kill anyone previously I think it is fine to secure your one kill. If the survivors don’t leave that is on them.
---
Mine is already updated :(
---
I went against a garbage Bill so I just got him and followed him around till he decided to vault then grabbed him
---
Did it first try with Prayer Beads Spirit and they even thanked me for an intense and fun match. Only two died. Everyone was happy. 
---
Grabbed 3 survivors in that match. They did nazi me coming.
---
ya forgot "slow the game down just a lil bit" mate
---
That's exposed status effect. You can change the images in your game files and put whatever you want. There is a subreddit dedicated for it called r/PerkByDaylight and no, it is not banable.
---
Just a little bit
---
This seems like a repost. I swear I've seen it before.
---
If you reached that point it doesnt really matter, nothing will be a good reward for you
---
Rift farming or deranking.
---
I only saw one tonight out of probably a dozen games played. Probably just bad luck.
---
Since this is a suggestion thread and will likely spark a good deal of discussion. I wanted to post this here as i havent seen anyone else notice it. In tard rage mode, i was in a KYF lobby and used my lunge as my buddy dropped the pallet, it seems to work the same way the saw does in that it will break the pallet. I haven't seen this utilized at all amd wanted to post it where others could see.
---
My favorite right now is Dead Hard, Unbreakable, Decisive Strike, and Unbreakable. A lot of killers at high ranks will counter DS by slugging you, so unbreakable helps with that if you get slugged.
---
Inner Strength, Adrenaline, Spine Chill,and Iron Will are good too, just depends on your playstyle really. I'm thinking of switching to Spine Chill because of how many people are using GhostFace now.
---
being totally honest? oni needs a buff tbh
---
his power takes *way* too long to charge, his lunge also takes too long to charge, and his sprint gets you stuck in corners, which take long to turn out of
---
You forgot being an ass hole to his viewers.
---
Shaggy is too powerful, we at the very LEAST need Velma.
---
Str8 up I just don't like the moans
---
Short answer: no
---
Long answer: it would drastically reduce the grind in the game which would be awful for the player base as it would be insanely easy to P3 all survivors and killer's, what's the point of playing anymore when there's no more progression?
---
Fuck this, I’m still waiting for my devotion 6 rewards and better get cosmetics no one else can get for “free” until earned
---
Hey, this game is going alright for me! :) :-| :-(
---
Not stolen, just a super low effort spin on an old meme.
---
On any map in particular cause there's a bunch of them
---
I don't have a Switch so I'm not familiar with how to fix it, but I know some people have poated fixes for it on this forum. Do a search for "switch" and sort by new. Hopefully you'll find something to help.
---
Rank 13 man. It's not hard to do lol. That being said, no, camping is whatever. It sucks to get camped, but if played right, you can make the killer lose the whole game for camping. I dont see a problem with tunneling either unless you actually physically ignore others and run around them to get the guy. Unless its end game, that's kinda not cool. But do what gets you wins. Fuck what people say.

Billy it fine, outside of insta-saw.  Needs an addon rework though, and bad.  Billy "exploits" the way bloodwebs generate, and gets the most ebony mories of all killers.

---
Truuuuu
---
The game is objectively easier for survivors.
---
the oni identifies as a black man
---
What he do to you?
---
Honestly, he's really easy to beat.
---
Yes, if you try to beat a good Oni in chase when he has Bloodrage, you're going to die. That's just a fact.
---
Fortunately, he has weaknesses.
---
1. When he *doesn't* have Bloodrage (like at the beginning of the game) he's just flat out the worst killer in the game, IMO worse than Old Freddy. His only abilities at this point are his misleading proximity music and some blood tracking. No real stealth, no mobility, no special attacks. Unless you get a garbage map spawn, and *especially* if you have an exhaustion perk, there's no reason he should even get access to his power before several gens are done.
---
2. When he *does* finally get Bloodrage... jump in a locker. Sure, you take an L, but it gets rid of his power immediately, resetting him to his pathetic state. Giving him one down like this is far preferable to the potential teamwipe that could ensue if you try to beat him in chase (you won't). It's like Plague: staying sick is better than giving her corrupt, and giving Oni one locker grab is better than letting him get 3 downs with his Dash'n'Smash.
---

---
My first thought too.
---
My idea is if your bleedout timer reaches the halfway point you get an option to just die.
---
Like dude I know killers want that 4k but playing musical slugs for 6+ minutes is the worst thing ever.
---
Yep, like how the Chalk Pouch offering only increases your luck by 1%
---
I can sadly hear this picture screaming at me.
---
Wonderful.
---
Why not just make pipping easier for killers and leave it at that. I get 2 iridescent and still only get 1 pip
---
You forgot the dc picture too
---
And he proceeded to do worse in the entire game lmao
---
Nevermind the insane amount of lag that streams have, but +rep and -rep was originally used when you traded things on steam to show reputation of the legitimacy of the profile.
---
&gt; So Hag, Freddy, Huntress and Demogorgon were removed from the game or sth?
---
When you're talking about rank 1, it's a different dynamic when it comes to killers. If you're not playing a small set of killers, you're probably going to get murdered by optimal survivors. We're not talking about rank 10 where someone hits Ruin one time and then freaks out and crouches around the map looking for the totem. We're talking about survivors that hit every Ruin check, loop efficiently, path efficiently, and have the game sense to know when someone else is being chased. We're talking about how 2 gens are consistently completed prior to the end of the first chase barring some large stroke of luck or a severe misplay by the survivor.
---
At the top levels, Hag has a very hard time because she absolutely *cannot* chase survivors with her movement speed. You have to have great traps, and even then, they're avoidable, removable, and they don't actually slow generators, which is the main problem. Freddy functions a lot like Clown because of his traps, and unless you're running his slowdown addons, he's just another M1 killer. M1 killers get bullied because of map tiles being as strong and extremely abundant as they are. You may be able to force the pallet drop sooner with a Freddy trap, but that doesn't change the fact that the other 3 survivors are zooming through generators, and will have 2-3 completed by the time you eventually down the person you're chasing.
---
Huntress hatchets aren't exactly difficult for good survivors to dodge, and dropping the pallet early means she doesn't get the guaranteed hit during an animation lock. Demogorgon can be successful, but his lunge is pretty easy to dodge, and the penalty for missing it can really screw you over.
---
The problems aren't really with the killer's themselves, rather how absurdly powerful survivors are. To take a previous game of mine as an example, this ridiculously strong path existed. Jungle gym &gt; cow tree &gt; TL wall &gt; Killer shack
---
In no universe against good survivors do you ever win that chase without losing every generator you have. You waste a near endless amount of time and have to try extremely hard while the survivor can operate with relative ease. 
---
Nurse powers through because she can ignore walls, and Spirit makes it a guessing game. You have to be very good with both, and put out a very high level of effort, if you want to be successful, while the survivor still is under virtually no pressure.
---
Fat downvote from me brother
---
Insanely optimal survivors
---
Lord forgive me for what I’m about to do
---
These will never get old
---
Wait, can u still grab people out of hatch ?
---
You are very good at editing
---
That’s the thing..you don’t even have to defend dull totems in the first place bc it’s a waste of time for survivors to do them
---
FUCK OVER YOUR TEAM BY WASTING ALL THE PALLETS!
---
Ewwwww
---
Make sure you teabag at exit against those killers
---
I DID THAT ONE GAME AND THE KILLER GOT PISSED CAUSE HE COULDNT CATCH ME
---
F
---
If I bring a Mori I never use them until ruin I cleansed
---
Yes!! PLEASE!
---
I just wish we got pip points when a killer face camps you because what really can you do besides die.
---
Probably swf
---
Oh my god I hope there's more art of the oni being a caring dad
---
If it's anything I like about Xbox is I can make messages sent to myself friends only and the game not having after game chat. The worse they can do I tbag you.
---
Thank god someone else asked

When ever that happens to me I just go back to that one meme "chuckles I'm in danger"
---
Why didn't you bring a mori for the streamer
---
This is what I have been waiting for. An rin protection oni
---
A god pallet from my understanding is a pallet like the one at killer shack because as long as it stands it's almost an infinite loop
---
Preach!
---
Where's this art from?
---
***"Ding Ding, Campfire meeting shall come now to ORDER!"***
---
Because u have window near and huge loop on this pallet. U can run killer so much time in this thing
---
- rep killer killed me first.
---
Well shit I thought the update was doing so well wtf happen lol
---
i just learn to ignore them. Some people will say anything to justify them not being good in some cases.

No actualy that's perfect

I'm pretty sure it's 4 minutes from healthy.

---
Short anwser: if you think this amont of grind is acceptable please kindly fuck off.
---
It also doesn't work with a blinking nurse, even if you get the bp
---
I honestly never really considered slugging much of a problem, both from a survivor and killer perspective. I mean, yeah, its not the most fun, but I hardly ever encounter it. Plus a slugged survivor has plenty of opportunities to be picked up by other survivors or perks. If slugging is such a serious and consistent problem, then you probably need to start running those perks. Hell I think there are much bigger issues ahead for survivors besides slugging, i.e. The Oni, the old Legion making his return, and plenty of bugs. So yeah, no, slugging in my opinion is fine as it is now.
---
Wth lol
---
When you push your lil bro too hard so you pretend to let him beat you up so he don’t tell mom
---
Hey can you read what Lisa wrote again
---
Oni is somehow a better dad than rins actual dad
---
You haven't seen real Cowboy Hillbillies who are drunk af with MOONSHINE.
---
Yeah both sides can be really bad. I don't play much surv so I don't have any experiences with toxic killers, but they are definitely out there. This community just needs a little bit less ego and pride.
---
Because survivors rush gens, holding on decisive/adrenaline and then complaint about noed/bloodwarden
---
Question... what was this Legion's name?
---
Obvious troll is obvious
---
It's as simple as making a suicide count as a hook event, I mean they literally have an animation for the Entity reaching out of the ground to sacrifice a survivor so they could reuse that and give you the proper points. To prevent salty people from just killing themselves on the ground it'd be as simple as adding a 10 second channel to the Force Sacrifice action, gives the killer enough time to pick the person up after downing them.
---
Thanks. Gotta wait till December for the OG Ghostface skin to be fixed. Wish they would hotfix it.
---
I’m not for or against them frankly I don’t care whether or not you have a charm on your pant leg of a unicorn Cumming all over but frankly I think it’s a slippery slope to people harassing you. This community is not known for being nice and I just see it causing you more problems than doing you good either way if you want to show pride just put it in your player name. (ImGay) Roscoe boom pride shown
---
Wierd waste of a mori but okay.
---
I mean when playing a sweaty 4 man swf then slugging is gonna be a good option lol
---
Wrong. You just died to noed. Anyone else?
---
You'd be surprised by the amount of people who don't do that or simply don't know how to do that my friend.
---
You’ve made an idea sir
---
I’m not surprised, I’ve seen a sheer amount of people complain or ask the devs to remove chat it’s funny lol. The devs give you tools to do it yourself yet they don’t.
---
I’d risk saying it’s even better than the old Hillbilly flicks. It is way too powerful though.
---
...what? How is it a waste. Using a mori is always gonna result in a survivor death, it's not like immediately using it as soon as you can and getting less bloodpoints is less of a "waste"

I‘m pretty sure I remember McLean said in the last dev stream they are actively working on improvements to sensitivity and it sounded as if it wasn’t too far off.
---
I mean it can be countered , it’s like spirit fury where you have to throw the pallet early . It’s not like ultra broken or something
---
More like this please
---
your art is so cute omg!!
---
Hurts like a damn dagger, doesn't it?
---
Disconnect.
---
Friends tell you the killer is on otherside of map.
---
Reconnect.
---
The totem sitting right next to him completely untouched?
---
It’s a lie.
---
slugging is a often a legit strategy so i doubt theyll do anything like that. it would be nice if they would do something about it though, also situations where the killer slugs for the hatch(which imo is not really fair, they made it where it spawns no matter what to give the last person the chance, killers basically cheese this chance by slugging the next to last guy)
---
Even if you're good you need multiple thousands of hours to fully max out your account (all characters at P3 Level 50 with all perks unlocked). I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the grind to stop growing after each patch and have it be made easier at some point.
---
I just think using a mori like that is a waste to me. I'd keep it for someone who was toxic in the past. Just my opinion tho.
---
Didn't even check if it lit up either. You get a cookie my friend.
---
I say "Cheers" if the match goes swell.  
---
I almost never say "gg" because of how obnoxious it sounds these days... supposedly due to bad habit of players affecting this?
---
I want whatever he is smoking
---
And why would Lisa Simpson lie to us?
---
I disagree, not every reward needs to be currency.
---
Yeah I literally saw this a few months ago just the first one changed which is pretty half ass. Lmao
---
That shirt would be an insta buy
---
Reddit’s like the most judgmental place ever. 
---
Literally anyone who is self conscious should stay away from reddit it’s like high school x1000 sometimes. 
---
I got like 140 downvotes for asking if  changing your “Camera Perspective” in a game was a cheat. 
---
Then someone took the time to explain that you could change your camera in the 3rd Person mode back and forth.
---
It did and has made sense with other chapters because it has already been used before lol
---
Is that a new map as well? Nice
---
The first time it was used was the most relevant imo because it’s the person who actually made the meme.
---
I'm not seeing a lot of movement in here!
---
low ranks must get good. balancing the game around low skilled players is next-level stupidity
---
Nurse one is easy as hell. Just short blink and hit. Easily done in 1 game and im a dog shit nurse lol
---
Lmao quit justifying your stolen hack memes and stop reposting. Idc if you changed one panel slightly. It’s boring and makes the sub just awful.
---
Sadly Nea perfectly synced her death as well. Poor girl.
---
Maybe make him bump like hillbilly does with his chainsaw while charging and remove the 180 flicks and he'd be fine... I think... I dunno
---
Because you have a window and a big loop next to it. it last way longer than other pallets.

---
this is making me uncomfortable
---
No we need the creeper. He’s way cooler.
---
Ok, I thought there was a longer delay between his first hit and the tantrum effect.
---
So, does this mean if Shaggy appears in Dead by Daylight he'll use his 4% of power to unhook himself?
---
Hatch should open when theres only one survivor not downed. Slugging problem solved.
---
Do you think people see every single post that gets popular? Or that everyone has to dig through old posts to make sure it's not a repost?

Just hide the post. I legit saw this template on a different subreddit and was like hey that fits now we have two yamaokas. But hey man, sorry this isn't the girls pointing at the cat meme or an old legion with the new perk meme.
---
It's in my app store — Android: Xiaomi! Philippines.
---
Same but it’s just me getting shidded on
---
There's no Freddy, Bubba or Quentin yet.
---
If you play both killer and survivor, that's really good. When you play as survivor, just act like the killer. Think about where he is, what he can do with his perks, and how you'd usually respond to the situation. Then as a survivor, do whatever would be hardest to deal with. Alot of times, if they are being extra weird with mindgames, you can just run away from the loop. I've seen so many killers loop themselves 2 or 3 times after I've already left the loop, and I'm either healing at the next loop, or running off to a gen. The reverse mindset can help you be a better killer, and a better survivor. Just react to things before they happen, think about how you would take on a survivor as killer, and just do the hardest thing to react to.
---
Made it from first attempt with ghostface, super ez.
---
Dying )))
---
The garbage you are going to?
---
What's a "girlfriend"?
---
So it doesn’t matter for any tangible reasons outside of preference?
---
Rank 4 on Xbox. Like a few times a week. And they always struggle greatly unless they bring NoEd.
---
Wouldn't say so. He's good, yeah, but not the best. I liked old Freddy, actually. I would like more if they buffed him, instead of reworking completely
---
If u have intros for sell lemme know
---
Maybe the killer should have been going around the map more looking for survivors or get better perks.  Pretty sad to dc and lose points lol
---
Yesterday on Badham I was playing Bone Clapper Wraith and uncloaked blocking a doorway so I could get a hit on a survivor who was working on the one upstairs gen that's stuck in the small room. I guess they didn't like that, because the second the hit connected they DC'ed, then proceeded to message me saying that I was a "pos who couldn't afford the DLC" and that I would be reported.
---
O... kay?...
---
This going to turn into some kind of FPS if survivors get a gun too
---
O-oh, ypu hit a guy *with* glasses, thats, thats clever.
---
FOUND A KILLER BUG THAT COMPLETELY DISABLES YOU BEING ABLE TO MOVE, LOVE MAINING KILLER HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
I will give this another shot. Thank you
---
It's like those survivors that dc right before they die on hook and I'm like why? You just get 0 points rather than whatever you got
---
while also making him broken good with the new perk, but it will probably be patched out with another Borrowed Time buff or making Deep Wound not go down during EITHER chase or terror radius
---
Legion: What is my purpose?
---
BHVR: You buff Borrowed Time
---
We need Velma and what about each survivor get a cosmetic for the gang David can be Fred Dwight could be shaggy meg could be Daphne
---
Nah, it wouldn't work
---
And everyone here was thinking they nerfed legion.
---
OhTofu&gt;noob3&gt;otz&gt;ussylis&gt;monto
---
Pretty much, yes. I'm not attacking the devs for this, as you said, it is my preference to play on my servers that i should be on.
---
Whats been up with monto recently?
---
I dont watch his streams(If thats what most of this refers to)
---
I sometimes watch his vids but he is just meh to me
---
Yeah these match times already take forever.
---
You used the wrong form of “there” in the title.
---
I mean.. sounds like you should move more inland if you really wanna solve it.
---
definitely nut. a glorious murder.
---
Strange. I'm over in Sydney but I still play against Aussie players. I normally get abysmal ping whenever I connect to asia in other games.
---
The way it works, is it will look for the server with the best ping, but if that server already full then it will send you to the next best thing.
---
One I can think of is to check your dns settings. I changed mine a while back because our government, in its infinite wisdom, blocked some sites I frequent. Now some places seem to think I live in Singapore.
---
Here's a handy guide on how to do that: [https://www.wikihow.com/Check-DNS-Settings](https://www.wikihow.com/Check-DNS-Settings) 
---
If your prefered dns server is listed as [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) then that might be the cause of your issue.
---
Another problem could be your download region on steam.
---
To test glitches? The point of a PTB is what it says, player test build, balancing is part of that. By that logic every balance BHVR ever made is fine cause PTB is only for glitches. 
---
I used to use legion now they are in a place that is cheap and broken as hell with nemesis, stab wound study, and any blade to lower mend time but we should ignore that cause it isnt a glitch? 
---
Oni is a new killer and he isnt perfect, fanboying cause you like to go in 1 hit mode in 30 seconds and can flick at the end of demon rush for a quick kill is a bit silly, he is not entirely broken by any means but he shouldnt be able to 180 flick with hot keys and kill all chance at juking either
---
It would be nice, but there are too many bugs as it is. Plus, the wait time is horrid.
---
Yes, literally how hard is it to to make add-ons have numbers. In fact it sounds like it wpukf probably be harder to add the slightly moderately and considerably to the add on description then just straight numbers.
---
Why you gotta be a dick?
---
But wouldn't it be so cool if it was an event that only went for a week or so though? I'd love it, honestly! I've been around for so long and watched this game grow from nothing, so it'd be wicked to see where we started. :)
---
Feral Frenzy inflicts deep wounds, but the timer only goes down outside of the legion's terror radius. Nemesis makes survivors who stun the killer oblivious (unaffected by terror radius.) So if a survivor stuns the legion, he can give the survivor deep wounds and chase the them until they bleed out. Addons make the deep wound timer waaaay shorter.
---
He’s cocky and thinks his opinion is the only right opinion
---
Deep Wound now goes down when 32 kilometers away from the Legion.
---
Hitting a survivor while in Feral Frenzy will make survivors enter the Healthy State.
---
DM me let’s talk.
---
Get one or more of your AUS friends and have them host an SWF lobby for you to join.
---
Not an optimal solution either of course, but apart from that and the VPN, there's nothing you can do, the game just routes you wherever it does automatically. I guess if it were possible to find out the IPs the Asian-region servers use one could block them, but even if that were possible, DbD might then just Keep kicking you out of lobbies rather than reroute you elsewhere.
---
Out of curiosity, how does the game experience differ, generally?
---
Leigon is just in such a shit position. 
---
Not only is the deep wound mechanic resident sleeper and tedious to play/play against (my personal opinion) balance wise is a nightmare as it’s either useless and a joke or slightly tweaked and Leigon can be cheesed it ‘breaks’ them. 
---
Deep wound should not benefits from perks like this but at same time, what can you do to Leigon’s power without just making him Meg’s arch nemesis in a rely race?
---
Dead by Roblox has come to dead by daylight
---
Elf Dwight fits in the game for sure tho
---
I think they went off people killed per trial, while not excluding disconnects. Before they announced the tweak, spirit was definitely strong (not too strong imo), for how easy she was to play. I saw a lot of people disconnecting as soon as they saw spirit.
---
Like 8/10 games against a spirit I would have to play 3v1 and ofc she gets a 4kill then most of the time.
---
How the fuck would it even be shoved down your throats? You’re so dramatic.
---
WHAT THE FUCK ARE THEY HONESTLY PLANNING WITH LEGION? THE ORIGINAL IDEA I THINK WAS DEEP WOUND ACTING LIKE A HEALTH BAR AND YOU STRUNG TOGETHER TONS OF STABS SO IT FELT FUN AND VISCERAL TO DOWN THEM BUT SINCE THERE WAS NO COUNTERPLAY IT WASNT FUN FOR THE SURVIVORS SO THEY DECIDED TO MAKE IT SOME KINDA STATUS EFFECT THING BUT IT DOESNT FUCKING WORK BECAUSE NOW THAT THEY HAVE A LARGER TERROR RADIUS DEEP WOUND DOESNT GO DOWN AT ALL AND WHEN IT DOES GO DOWN YOURE FAR ENOUGH FROM THE KILLER WHERE YOU CAN HEAL IT RIGHT AWAY SO ITS JUST FUCKING USELESS AND THE ONE FREE HIT YOU GET FROM FERAL FRENZY DOESNT MATTER BECAUSE YOU GO FUCKING BLIND FOR A WHILE AND CANT MOVE ALONG WITH NOT SEEING SCRATCH MARKS SO THEYLL GET AWAY ITS A LOAD OF SHIT
---
I just got done watching and I gotta say man you come across as really unlikable in the video (I’m not saying that you are like that in real life) calling the killer a dickhead because he downed you and calling that Yui bitch a whole bunch of times came across as more bullying than it did Comedy. I would also be careful to use the sound effects you did because it comes across as more copying of Noob3 than it does as taking inspiration. 
---
That being said there are some good parts. I think the effects you used on the Uni were funny and your interaction with Yui when you were Bill were entertaining as well. Good luck with the YouTube stuff tho man I hope it works out.
---
I just don't want another killer that I'll feel guilty for playing, especially not one as fun as Oni.
---
You can, you just have to but the bloodsplatterd pack
---
I want to here *more* Steve
---
They’ll probably just make it so that oblivious doesn’t cancel the terror radius and not play the sound effects for it.
---
It's been 2 ½ years. It's about time
---
He Always plays against really bad survivors as a killer
---
Try staying in green ranks.
---
what a monster
---
I rarely DC but I will if I go against a huntress who continually gets shitty axe hits on me because of trash servers and awful hit boxes. No skill involved and no fun involved. *especially* if they use iri heads. I’d have no problem with that add-on I’d the ability itself worked properly.
---
I'm pretty sure thats always been in the game, you need to hit the skill check else you'll make a loud noise
---
Well Billy recently got a shotgun, but he uses the wrong end lol
---
With that perk now i assure you every killer will bring brutal strenght from now on (i used once with fire up and was pretty fun memeing all around NGL)
---
there's some real gaps in the lore. like how did the wraith go from working at a junkyard to being a spooky voodoo ghost? we just don't know
---
He's going to be a much chiller killer on console
---
Thanks
---
From my experience, I don't play killer often, but when I do, the killer queues are a few minutes to about 5 minutes, survivor only takes a minute for me and I'm purple. I assume killer queues would take longer the better rank you are
---
Loomis, Sally, Nancy, and Sidney
---
Ah, killer, makes sense.
---
What kind of Asian region is it, i. e. what kind of countries are the players you get there mostly from? South-East Asia, I assume?
---
There's one more tip I could maybe give you: Apparently, if you have the VPN enabled while launching the game, and then go into the in-game store and spend some time there looking at cosmetics, you should be able to then disable the VPN but still get sent into lobbies of the region your VPN  was set to.
---
I know of someone else who did this - hope that works for you, too!
---
Makes you think, wonder if a gun wielding killer could work. Like a sniper with a long reload and has to scoped in, so up close would be hard. And give the scope a glint if you look right at it or something
---
Man, when I play killer, I don’t even know why I let some survivors leave.
---
Like if a survivor comes up to me early game, I’m either “You have balls. Very well, when all other have perished, you alone shall leave through the gate.” Or “You cocky shit, you die first.” And I have no idea why sometimes it’s one and sometimes the other.
---
Be awsome. But sadly konami is to busy raping the silent hill franchise by turning them into slot machine casino games.
---
cats have 9 lives so its ok
---
For next year in December, I’d like a new pack for stranger things’ next season. I only watched it because of DBD and I really enjoy it. 
---
Otherwise, for a new chapter, Art the Terrifer would be cool. Or a proper killer from Evil Dead. Ash alone isn’t enough.
---
Yes, balance the game for 99% of players.
---
I'm glad you understand.
---
I actually got 5 grabs on one match as Wraith with the silent bell and the brown ghost add on
---
Same. As is, Hag, Spirit, and Wraith are the only killers I find... sympathetic?
---
Lol, whats the current reddit meta for this subreddit?
---
The challenges force different playstyle that most wouldn’t use. Like imagine running self care normally, eww
---
Yes that’s what I mean! The bar was red and if you didn’t get the hex skill check, even if inside the bar, it stabbed them
---
WHY ARE PEOPLE DOWNVOTING your comment it’s great???
---
So you’ve made a place where it’s easy to identify that you’re LGBT so easier to target? You’re intelligent
---
If you are a tunneling legion, all you have to do with nemesis is feral frenzy, hit them twice, and tunnel. Legions that then follow a survivor within about 15 seconds will just bleed out. I don’t know if insta heals work in the mendable state, if so, then that’s the counter. But it’s a pretty OP perk...
---
Hag's power lies in being able to completely shut down loops by simply placing a trap and forcing the survivor to abandon the loop or stay and get hit. Plus her snowball potential off of a single hook is downright disgusting, as she can essentially camp hooks from a distance.
---
Freddy has amazing map pressure thanks to his gen teleport, and can also shut down loops and turn safe pallets into unsafe with his snares. He also has amazing synergy with the top tier perks that killers have access to, and a Discordance or Thrilling Tremors coupled with PGtW can help immensely with game slowdown even if you don't go full Forever Freddy.
---
The only real problem with Huntress is the fact she really struggles in some maps, but in an open map she can really shine at the hands of a competant player. Her only real problem is patrolling gens with her 110% movement speed, but the fact she can potentially apply pressure from afar thanks to her ranged attacks does help a lot. Honestly, if the devs wanted to nerf her, all they had to do is actually fix the bullshit hitboxes and she'd instantly become Nurse 2.0 for how much skill she'd require, but as it currently stands, even experienced survivors will get fucked by hitboxes and eat a hatchet they should have dodged. 
---
Demogorgon, like Freddy, can also apply pressure all over the map thanks to his portals, and if you are experienced with his lunge, you can shut down some of the best loops in the game (such as killer shack). 
---
Regarding your jungle gym into cow tree into TL wall into shack chase, you simply don't commit. Chase the survivor around for a little, force a pallet drop or get an M1 on him, and move on, unless he fucks up and you can down him. If the killer forgoes pressuring gens in favor of commiting to chasing a single survivor who knows what he's doing and has a lot of stuff in his disposal to extend the chase, then the problem lies with the killer, not the amount of chase extenders the survivor has.
---
&gt;You have to be very good with both, and put out a high level of effort
---
Nurse? Yeah. Spirit? No fucking way. She might have been reworked, but her primary issue still remains, that being survivors having next to no clue to be able to reliably tell when she is actually phasing, or just standing still. The changes to Prayer Beads and Yakuyoke are nice, as is the fact she can now be seen vaulting windows, but the most prominent issue preventing counterplay that she has still remains. As it stands, a mediocre Spirit can still 4k against good (not great) survivors without much trouble.
---
Deserved
---
youre seriously reposting this again?
---
That's hilarious!!!
---
“SAFE pallets”, there are many pallets but hardly any good ones
---
It's dumb. Just bring a key place it somewhere in the corner of the map go pick it up when you need it.
---
I agree, keys provide an extremely easy win for survivors. This coming from someone who has plenty of experience on both sides. Keys really do tip the scales more to survivors who dont need these  advantages
---
They just need to step in the trap
---
That is awesome and creepy. Love it
---
I feel called out
---
Nothing like doin work in the lery’s with PWYF mirror Michael. Myers zooms around corners.
---
HERE'S DC!
---
His screams of terror are what got me😂
---
And small notice, you should choose a region that's a bit close to you. If you take it too far, your ping is gonna be affected. Takes the effect really. Good luck though.
---
I haven't gotten a Mori Daily since the Bills won the super bowl!
---
All the pallets on hawking's are super unsafe and next to impossible to loop. Survivors will burn through them quick as they have no way of preserving them. attempting a loop at hawking's will often get you hit.
---
Wat i learned about this game after 4000 hours.  dont giv a damn f... everyone at least more then a half of the playerbase will always complain about you. No matter wat you do. They hate you as a killer, they hate you as a survivor. I dont mind. I dont save my teammates if i dont want to, i go for the same person as a killer again if i think i have to. I run perks like no mither when i want and dont care about if anyone is telling me its a dumb perk. Everyone knows that. If a swf squad trys to bully me i might just play unfair as hell. Why not. Reminder: its your game play like you want. You dont have to care about some random guys fun. They dont care ether.
---
I don't really get the point of tunneling the key user in particular, like unless they are a swf, coordinating with your teammates to get to the hatch is borderline impossible. And even if they are a swf, the hatch is just a backup for when you have finished gens, and if the doors are too hard to open (like if it's a billy and they are within sight of each other.) 
---
If there was an item to tunnel over I would think it would be flashlights.
---
i cringed when i had to do the self care one. botany still didnt help
---
Honestly trapper really needs a change on how you gather your traps and i think just giving him a bag per default isn’t gonna be enough
---
I'm fucking sick of escaping with a key, or some other good item, only to have the game glitch and I don't keep my item. It happens way too much.
---
Make it to red ranks and that won't happen
---
Tru3 needs a kids show
---
"Alright lads, today's word is "Optimal".
---
N O
---
That OK but it picture yourself doing it while someone chasing you to heal you. Yeah no.
---
just shut up and put sloppy butcher on every killer :)
---
I love the style you've got going.
---
L O W E F F O R T
---
say that again, but slowly
---
Funny you say that because that’s what happened, I got unhooked and they tried healing me, I ran away and self cared, simple.
---
it would actually be like Japanewhere the females outnumber the males almost 7 to 1.
---
Which Rift survivor challenge is can be completed by AFKing?
---
Having the black one be the runner and the white one be the botanist didn’t do to well with testing audiences, I suppose.
---
Tap the big button in the middle. The big flat thing.
---
A god pallet is a pallet the is involved in a very strong loop (and i mean VERY strong) examples of God pallets include the killer shack, the ironworks at macmillan, the garage at auto haven and the fractured cowshed at coldwind.
---
Drop pallets early. Granted that disarms the best weapon against Legion.
---
Honestly it's not that broken, but it's gonna be obnoxious when bad legions try to abuse it.
---
? Tradable perks?
---
Would word only if killers were balanced
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
I’ll still be positive but unfortunately people act like entitled shits when I’m being genuine and friendly.
---
Hooking the last survivor is always nice, you just know they're expecting the hatch
---
Yeah about two hours ago. 4 in a row
---
The TouchPad
---
More likely they'll make the deep wounds timer pause while in a set range of the killer, rather than within their terror radius.
---
Who am I kidding, I can't predict the devs, who knows what they'll do.
---
Your controller button is broken.
---
That’s just hatch tech without a punishment then. Don’t dc, but have the same power of a dc and still get points and give mate hatch. Brilliant idea
---
Yeah, ok, hi, quick question, what the fuck
---
Wow, Nea’s got them hips. Great art!
---
Ghostface is immune to aura reading while stealthed. Imagine Myers in tier 2 vs this squad
---
I really don't know about Ace. It's hard to notice something that you DON'T notice, but I know there's times occasionally where I'll lose people based on sounds, and a lot is due to following noises mixed into the flaming barrels.
---
Something about Ace though is he has that injured pregnancy breathing, and it's so jarringly different from anything else that I find it impossible not to notice or confuse with anything else.
---
No it's not
---
This just reminds me how DbD cosmetics have reached Deviantart OC tier
---
I mean people can afk and still get xp experience towards the rift tiers.
---
All those urban evasions, and balanced landings are great for glutes and thighs! Glad you like it!!
---
dude, just don't stun him
---
If I remember correctly, plague did nothing wrong too.
---
Yeah exactly. There’s no counter to a Mori but I don’t complain about it, it’s part of the game. Ruining someone’s experience because a virtual item makes him mad is super childish, imo.
---
They still know the direction. icon lights up.
---
Or just have fun instead of letting a virtual item control your behavior
---
I expected ruin getting destroyed as your camera zooms on you
---
I got something even better.
---
Lol my sweet summer child
---
IIINTERROOGAAAAAAASIIION!!1!11!
---
camping is the opposite of an optimal play most of the time
---
Does he complain a lot?
---
Or like make excuses?
---
If shaggy becomes a survivor. That will be the only dlc ill buy.
---
Untill i get super hooked into it.
---
Dude is playing trapper though, they’ll know where he puts every trap and any element of surprise. Feelsbadman
---
Can't deny that. Last Time I talked about removing or changing keys I got downvoted. In the same thread someone said the same thing but in a more polite way and got upvoted. Really bizarre.
---
smash music too?
---
I support Velma as survivor
---
You must be the guy
---
Most of the time, sometimes it's the last optimal play available and still feels scummy.
---
To be fair the bar's not set very high there
---
is it really the smart move to just drop a survivor close to the hook after seeing someone halfway across the map who’s been on once? no deerstalker.. every single time i end up getting chased or dying while my teammate gets picked up. i’ve seen plenty of killers who genuinely face camp and tunnel for fun.
---
maybe it wasn’t a good example so let me rephrase. i’ve been in more matches than i can count where the killer only wants me and won’t go after anyone else until i’m dead. i’ve been in matches where i get chased for a while and then get face camped for no reason. i get in matches where the killer says “gg 2 ez.” it’s really not only survivors that can be toxic. you can say it’s just the objective but it’s the most obnoxious and dumbest move you can possibly make. getting one kill isn’t getting killers anywhere, and when another player can make you lose a pip when there’s zero counterplay, that is an issue.
---
killers are able to adapt to finding strong loops and flashlight pallets. every loop has a way to be dealt with and if you’re good at finding survivors after losing them, flashlight pallets aren’t that strong especially since the survivor can only either turn around you or crouch somewhere extremely nearby. survivors cannot adapt to camping or tunneling, there’s genuinely nothing that the survivor can do besides maybe borrowed time but not everybody runs that. the team can try taking hits but a lot of solo que teammates are not altruistic at all.
---
Survivor still too op
---
I got so disappointed when I saw the new survivor.
---
&gt;Driven crazy by a demon, killed his daughter and now is brought to Entity's land, where both the demon and a ghost of his daughter haunt him.
---
It would've been so god damn epic
---
I thought the bottom right of the screen was a square with another video lmao
---
I did this on my first try like many ppl here. Just short press instead of long press at a window or pallet.
---
I mean most Survivors' pained grunts are fairly easy to distinguish perhaps maybe Tapp and Kate. Jeff too if he wasn't so fucking loud.
---
I'm just parroting the community when I say Ace is the "best" Survivor. I personally don't believe in "best" Survivors, just the ones that are way too fucking loud (Jeff, Bill, Jane, etc.) and the ones that can't be heard from a mile away.
---
In my opinion, everything goes in/near the end-game
---
Yeah! They always look at you with these big puppy eyes. Even when they tried their hardest to annoy you the whole game.
---
What is this mod
---
I think you should fix the eye, and the shape of the mask looksss.... Good!
---
BOIIIIIIIIII
---
gib me that template
---
Must've been 211 when the world ended
---
Every game I meet the cream of the crop survivors
---
Or in other terms, double teamed by his daughter and many greats grandpa
---
Lol, I can just imagine a perk where if the killer gets stunned the survivor can just go up to the killer and hit them to extend the stun timer by 5 seconds with a cool down of 60/50/40 seconds.
---
Darn am i the only nancy main here?
---
The fire rate is a bit to slow... but maybe he is B tier then... near to A.
---
For me when I was around rank 10 it took about 3-5 minutes for a killer and around 20 seconds for survivors.
---
Bruh
---
I play a lot of legion manly for a more casual experience and more BP. I dont think this perk breaks everything. 
---
It just feels like its  camping to me you can secure a kill but it takes time time survivors can use to pop gens. But again it requires people to drop pallets or use flashlights so it's possible to counter it similar to spirit fury just drop early.
---
Teachable*
---
Yeah I was looking forward to seeing his loose end tied up. When I saw the trailer with the mask I assumed he had gone mad with guilt and commited seppuku. That would have been interesting if he became either a killer or a survivor afterward.
---
I am happy with both characters we got however, just a shame to not see him.
---
The game shown: Garry's Mod.
---
The map: I think it is called gm_asylum.
---
The gun: M9K Assault Rifles - SCAR. I recognized the sound of the shots.
---
Not exactly dad but gran gran gran gran gran grandpa
---
Outplayed.
---
Channel that teleport the trap of your choice to you!
---
Tranq gun hunter who can't move fast. Tranquilized survivor is oblivious and gets an initial speed boost but progressively slows down until they get stunned for a few seconds. They are exposed during the stun.
---
This gives the survivor a head start to run and hide before the hunter catches up to it's "prey".
---
How long ago was it that teachables weren’t shared? I’ve been playing for 2 years and haven’t ever heard of it
---
Michael with lullaby? 
---
What an odd combo

W O K E
---
Being a good Billy takes a lot of practice and skill,  so he’ll always be respected. I don’t think many would agree with this post.
---
don't forget to nod at them before you mori them tho
---
He needs the Lanzor from Gears of War
---
Nea actually looking kinda cute 😳 . But on the real, this is adorable, that’s me in the back
---
I'd just make it so that Deep Wounds (AND Borrowed Time) is radius based, not terror radius/chase/ect based (which leaves them prone to fuckery).   Would also give a better lever to make BT more of an anti-camp perk (Tight radius) that works regardless of killer, and less of one that punishes high TR killers while buffing low/no TR killers.
---
Yup, even one OoO in a SWF is basically cheating.
---
I do have fun going against them as Wraith though.
---
Ffs
---
So if anyone has seen Terrifier, Art The Clown is the premiere underrated psycho this game needs. If anyone is familiar, he breaks the mold of slashers. Yes he smashes, slashes and mutilates people, however to kill one actor he pulls out a pistol. I’ve wanted Art in the game since I saw him and I figure he’d be a Jack of all Trades sort of killer, with a wheel of powers/weapons. 
---
Never made a full fledged idea for him, but I know that I always wanted him to have his gun. Super accurate, insta down, but it’s one shot and if you miss you miss. This is the only way I can see a gun working in this game.
---
live on PTB?
---
I can't download PTB this time so can't say for sure
---
You can't hit them on live. 
---
if you can on PTB, it's a bug
---
if you could but no longer can on PTB, it coming back was a bug
---
I'm sure that all of us that love the game would want nothing more than for it to get nominated but the sad reality is that Dead by daylight isn't that big of a game compared to the other ones that got nominated.
---
it depends on what else they do.
---
like if a survivor runs up at me, maybe tbags, and runs away without being overly toxic (ie: throwing pallets down, spam fast-vaulting through windows, sandbagging teammates) then they're usually "the chosen one" ;)
---
Better yet, just make it radius dependent.  Doesn't have to be a huge one to be an impactful one.  16Ms is enough to enable running any loop basically, where the killer can't try using cheese to bypass Deep Wounds (Or just being Freddy and laughing at the concept of Deep Wounds), while also making large TR killers not be pointlessly "nerfed" by Deep Wounds being negated in such a large area.
---
Would you shut up. this is bs you can easily save and if not then your a rank 20 and tunneling isn't a problem if you were good. And no I'm not a killer main I'm a player who gets face camped just for looping the killer I know it bs but it's not hard to counter imo
---
Sweet, sweet karma
---
**we did a pretty good.....JOB SO FAR**
---
Shaggy perk, Like Run: When in a chase with the killer your movement speed is increased 2,4,6%, any survivors within 12 meters of you will have the same affect.
---
Join the legion
---
Or just don't drop pallets at all, at least not during Feral. You can still waste a lot of time from both hits plus the post-power stun/ speedboost from the second hit. By the time you get double smacked with two speed boosts you can make ur way to \*insert god loop here\* and run to your hearts content. Even if you have to loop a pallet instead you can just drop it for no stun, and on the off chance you are forced to stun, Legion still has to babysit you all the way through the rest of your timer or this entire thing was pointless. Not to mention that Legion has put zero pressure on any of the other survivors during this time entire when spreading the damage is Legion's best strength.
---
I get that once Legion gets Deep Wound AND Nemesis activated on you you're pretty much going down no matter what. But that doesn't change the fact that it's a horribly inefficient way to down people and won't even be reliable against survivors that figure out what you're doing. Yes it's super strong when all the stars align, but getting those stars to align is going to be a pain in the ass that's more trouble than it's worth. There's a word for those types of builds: gimmicks.
---
Based off their actions, I'd say they were tbagging cause you brought an Ebony mori.
---
Kate was a bit stupid to face you when tbagging. Due to how going down works, she backflipped and wasn't able to leave, which got her killed.
---
You're probably right even if it does get nominated probably stupid fortnite would win no offense with your fortnite player I'm just not a fan of fortnite
---
Kate is still better
---
That's not really a meme. That's not really anything.
---
DBD has far too little of a community compared to other ongoing games such as DotA 2, LoL, CSGO, etc...
---
DBD has had patches and DLC, while Dota keeps breaking records with the prize pool for tournaments. As much as I like this game, I'd give it over to the other nominations.
---
Stop using xd it's just cringey are you 12
---
It's not a story the jedi would tell
---
Keys end games early, can't blame them.
---
Hating on the spirit/addons and survivor perks
---
Why are you bringing up games that are not even nominated for the awards?
---
Except it isn't fun when I'm doing well in a game and all of a sudden through no fault of my own, I get a big "LOL YOU LOSE" screen halfway through a game.
---
Man you gotta have the creeper.
---
Was this post by some 40 year old middle school teacher.. miss me with the kindergarten shit.
---
People who DC against the clown are the entire circus, even if he has Redhead's Pinky Finger + a Mori.
---
Yeah it won't be op by any means, but it'll be obnoxious enough that people will dc against them, which sort of sucks for someone like me who just likes legion.
---
RJ MacReady from The Thing.
---
In the words of Monto, you have a key, you have to die.
---
Haha aww glad you like my take on her!
---
As a former Freddy one trick.
---
The nerfs were needed
---
Honestly, people still think that old Freddy was bad while they played him completely wrong.
---
With old legion coming back I have a bit of hope we will be able to play old Freddy again in someway.
---
Getting grabbed out of a locker is not counter"play", it is capitulating in the face of a power that is absurdly strong
---
I also remember a month or so ago as Ghostface I had a guy DC on first down in a game where 5 cakes/BPS were burned during bloodhunt. (I was going to play with the intent of 2 hooking everyone) Like jesus fucking christ at least play out the match so you get your BP.
---
It's just super addictive with broken shit each patch and insanely questionable balance for what feels like years. As much as I love this game, best ongoing games really need to be so bad for DBD to get a nomination.
---
that, that should not be possible. what the fuck.
---
Probably some beta player shit, Im a bit confused as well.
---
Eh, facecamping's excessive. Prioritising the key holder's understandable, especially if it's near the endgame, but hard tunneling is unnecessary imo. Especially since if they were a swf, someone else will go pick up the key and then you've lost track of it.
---
exactly
---
But you didn’t lose if you did well. If all four survivors escape to a hatch that means they completed 4 hens and you killed NO ONE. So yeah it is your fault.
---
Do I like this behavior? No
---
Do I blame him? No
---
Keys are cancer, just like Mori's and what insta heals were, Stypic is still an insta *but better* but at least there's not as many as before.
---
If you don't want to be tunnelled camped etc, don't bring a key. I don't do it, but tons of other Killers do, I can't do anything about them but I'm telling you that you can stop it by not bringing them.
---
Just you wait till all 3 of you are best friends.
---
If a survivor knows how to unhook and sit on a gen they pip. It's way too easy to pip into red ranks.
---
I’m no pc expert but I’m sure you could get the right parts for your pc. 
---
Um shit man goodluck with this question man, most people’s opinions will be biased. 
---
I’m used to Xbox and I have more friends there so I play Xbox. But I also do have a PS4. Ps4 does have amazing games for it like Bloodborne, God of War, The last of us and that’s about what I can think of for now. 
---
Xbox has Halo.
---
Nice so you not only do what a popular streamer tells you but you also let a virtual item control your behavior. Nice!
---
Both are the same, toxicity wise? Ps4 is more toxic in my opinion. I know xbox will ban any users using any sort of bad manner.
---
Yeah but tunneling and face camping guarantees a loss. How is that an argument? Hahaha
---
Nice drawing!
---
Also, you lose if you tunnel and face camp lol so you have no argument bud
---
Doctor canonically uses his power on himself to induce a coma just so he can have some peace and quiet from his own madness.
---
Really nice! I main nea and I'm gonna main Yui too. I love their styles.
---
Dumb bitch.
---
Mothman DLC, we need
---
Lämp, he requires
---
&gt; Hag's power lies in
---
I think you're completely forgetting how horrendously slow she is. You stop and place a trap at a jungle gym, and the survivor runs to the next loop. Hag is not built to chase. 
---
&gt; Freddy has amazing map pressure thanks to his gen teleport
---
The fact that he can only do it every so often says otherwise. Even then, you get to teleport to one gen, meanwhile, there's 3 others that could be going up. He's not Hillbilly. His mobility is very limited and extremely telegraphed.
---
&gt; and can also shut down loops and turn safe pallets into unsafe with his snares
---
Yes, because we see just exactly how well that works for Clown, don't we? The amount of time at a loop may be lessened, but all you have to do is buy enough time for your team to fly through generators. 
---
&gt; and a Discordance or Thrilling Tremors coupled with PGtW can help immensely with game slowdown even if
---
All of this is assuming you actually get the hook. A trap isn't suddenly going to just wreck the killer shack or a jungle gym. You're grossly overestimating it.
---
&gt;  but in an open map she can really shine at the hands of a competant player
---
Doesn't change the fact that hatchets are still easy to dodge, and if you're the type of person who gets hit by a full map hatchet, you're not paying attention. Poor play is not a metric that you can use here, though I wholeheartedly agree her hitboxes need fixing.
---
&gt; can also apply pressure all over the map thanks to his portals
---
Yes, he can, but it's still somewhat limited and removable. It also takes time to establish, which can cost you dearly when trying to gain early momentum.
---
&gt; and if you are experienced with his lunge, you can shut down some of the best loops in the game
---
You're still completely forgetting about the survivor on the other side of this. Sure, all this sounds great in a vacuum, but you're not playing against rank 10s with no brains. You're playing against rank 1s who use the ridiculous power survivors hold to nearly its full extent. 
---
Oh gee, I'm at the killer shack and I'm running to the window. Wait, he's charging his dash. I bet he's gonna aim it at the window, so I'll try to mindgame him and fake it so I can go the other way.
---
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but you're simplifying it far too much to try suiting your position. Bad form.
---
&gt; Regarding your jungle gym into
---
No kidding, but my point is that these types of things happen very frequently. These strong tiles spawn all over the map, and not just in one spot. You can't simply give up every chase. You *have* to force the survivors into rescuing each other, otherwise you're just getting slingshotted from one generator to another. Imagine how pathetic and abandoned the theme of this game has to be to tell a killer whose sole job is to hunt and viciously murder that he has to quit his pursuit because of windows and pallets.
---
&gt; Spirit? No fucking way
---
Oh, so you don't need to have foresight into the survivor's movements to best counteract them? You don't need to be able to see subtle changes in the grass to track them when they aren't leaving scratch marks? Man, you really got me there. I guess I thought it took more than just standing in one place to fool top survivors into their deaths.
---
&gt; can still 4k against good (not great) survivors without much trouble.
---
And here's the entire problem. I made very clear how I was referring to the highest levels of gameplay. I don't give a flying rat's dick about rank 10 players and their difficulties, and I certainly don't use the data of less-than-optimal play as my rubric when judging things.
---
The fact of the matter is that map tiles are still far too strong, and they spawn far too close together, far too often. This, coupled with insanely fast generator speeds, means that you have roughly 30 seconds as killer to get yourself ahead, or else you're going to have the game slip more and more away from you. The amount of effort put forth by survivors is egregiously imbalanced to that of killers, and the role that *should* be the one sweating and panicked, is not.

WHO LIKES MY KEMETH CHASE (THE CLOWN FROM DEAD BYT DAYLIGHT) COSPLAY
---
Kyle Crane from dying light 
---
All teachables would be exhaustion perks
---
I never made an argument. I said you have no argument. As a survivor in order for all four people to escape, 4/5 gens must be completed. That’s 4/5 of their win condition. In order for a Mori to work a killer needs to only a hook a survivor ONCE. Keep in mind it normally takes 3 total hooks to kill someone. That’s 1/12 of the killers objective. I’m not saying keys are balanced. I’m saying comparing them to moris is dumb, and saying that tunneling and face camping is a better strategy then just playing out the game because is nonsense.
---
I understand it , the tunneling Part i mean. If he  left you you probably would have escaped and maybe 2 mates  aswell .
---
It's almost like it's a bad idea to rush gens while injured when vs him. He's meant to have his power frequently, he's just not meant to have infinite use of it.
---
Bear in mind also that blood orbs don't spawn while he is in fury, so he's going to run out even if he's keeping it up and using it continuously.
---
"Because if he has Tombstone his hand will be open and not a fist" when in reality the open hand is tied to movement speed. 
---
If you play on a controller and tilt the stick slightly to move slowly Myers will have his hand open without Tombstone, and you can tombstoned by a Myers who has his hand in a fist because he was running Tombstone Piece which has no movement speed reduction.
---
Or we can stop it by not getting upset over virtual items lol
---
r/SwordOrSheath
---
Probably what they meant is that spirit players won a lot of more games statistically compared to other killers. Plus as another redditor said, a lot of people just DC as soon as they see it's a spirit, even tho it's a baby spirit. And I actually don't blame them, as I am myself bored out of my mind playing against her and ghostface all the time. Which is two meta killers on ps4. Even billies went extinct, where are just few Godlike Billy mains left on ps4, everyone else switched to spirit or ghostface.

Yeah I understand prioritizing the key. But face camping is ridiculous, as would be proxy camping. There’s literally no counter to a Mori, yet there is a counter to a key—franklins. Not to mention that if it’s solo queue that key is meaningless and as the devs data showed, most games are not played in a SWF.
---
Ay I’m just saying, no hate, but *usually* when you get tunnelled it’s because of you or your teammates bad decision. Why wouldn’t a killer hit you again after you’ve been unhooked in front of them? There’s no logic against it. U may as well hit them then go after the other survivor, or just hook you again. That’s the survivors fault not the killers, either bring BT or be careful. Otherwise the killers probably being a bitch, or can  tell you’re the weak link. Obvs that’s not fun for you but without taking you out the killer may really be struggling. So when people say ‘ew you tunnelled’ no you just unhooked in front of me when I wasn’t camping... u really expect me to leave with alone rn? All love not hate people :)
---
Wraith.
---
Play wraith with Haunted Ground, Devour Hope, make your choice, and bbq for points.
---
Until devour is ready, rush down the unhooker every time. Wraith gets first hits extremely fast and effectively. 3 games out of 10, devour will go early and you'll have to take advantage of haunted ground when it goes. the other games you'll mince people so fast that they won't have a chance to find the totem before it's too late.
---
It's inconsistent, but so is everything in this game. The matches that it works make up for the matches that it doesn't.
---
You forgot potato 4head teammates
---
I will run this perk mostly to throw the god-pallet near other survivors at the start of the match, see if someone DCs and then put it back up
---
Well a Key, Mori, Insts Heal, NoeD, among others are unfun to play against, to play with? Hella fun, I'd rather fun for both sides not just one side.
---
I mean, it happened with the nurse, who knows which killer gets axed next.
---
Can we please, Please, PLEASE! Fix the god damn never ending line of trapper bugs.
---
Legion's fundamental power can't work.
---
They need a full on rework.  Not a pansy ass rebalance.  A full on rework.  Something that actually plays into the fact they are "legion" and not just a teenager with a knife.  Or just a broken ruler in Susie's case.
---
IMO, the best direction to go with Legion to make them better designed killers both thematically, and balance wise, is this.
---
Fully play up to the idea that they are legion, by making them LEGION.  While only one can be controlled by the player, acting like a slightly slower M1 killer (110% move speed), the other 3 are still active and out on the field as AI killers with reduced stats (100% move speed, shorter FoV, a purposely "dumb" AI that is supposed to be easy to escape from with LoS blockers, ect).
---
The AIs won't down players, but will apply pressure of various forms.  If they can land a hit, they will try to to injure.  If they can hit an injured survivor, they will apply Deep Wounds.  If a loud sound notification pops within 32M radius of them, they'll investigate it, if they see a survivor aura shown by a perk within 32M radius, they'll chase after it, ect.  All 3 AI legion will have a short Terror radius (16M), benefitting from most Terror radius perks (M&amp;A won't trigger on them just for balance reasons), with the player controlled one having a medium one (24M).  Now here is the big deal.  The legion's active power is to swap control to one of the AIs.  He can always see where they are, and what they are doing while his cooldown is up.  Which means survivors always need to respect any AI they see, just because it could be the real deal very easily, especially with M&amp;A letting the real one mask himself as an AI with the shorter TR (and purposely playing a bit dumb).  Could give the legion a potency boost post-swap too (To keep you wanting to swap if you see a chance), and use the current Feral Frenzy run as the post-swap sprint, with the current frenzy exhaust animation revealing when they swap.
---
As far as addons go, generally they just would be cooldown on power, reduction in stun on swap, increased speed boost after swap, and other such addons for brown through green.  Some Greens and all Purples would add extra effects to attacks after swaps, and/or buff the AI's actions (For instance, the AI would apply mangled+Hemorrhage with the purple addon, or may break pallets that had been dropped by survivors prior, or perhaps kicking non-regressing gens), while the ultra-rare addons would basically write themselves.  First one is that when the Legion swaps it doesn't have either a stun or trigger the speed boost (Really can't tell who it is outside of the TR change), and the second being that the AIs can actually down players, but disabling swaps completely.
---
Overall, this creates a killer that is good into SWF and solos, and high rank viable, partially by heavily removing the SWF advantage of coms on killer location, but isn't super overbearing because he is still very much loopable, but still "slowing the game down a little bit" with the extra pressure put out by the clones.

Devs said it was the entity, and I don't think they've changed their mind. That still makes more sense. Kazan hates fake nobility, but he cares deeply about his family. He wouldn't make his descendant kill his own family, might kill him personally for reducing their bloodline to practically fake nobility, but wouldn't want any other yamaokas harmed.
---
Now, could the Oni's influence have driven him to commit suicide afterwards? That i'll buy.
---
5 gens must be done for 4 people to escape with a key....
---
Are you really defending it?
---
It isn't stunning with a pallet or locker like it specifies though, so one of them must be bugged, either furtive, ds, or nemises's wording is double bad.

one of the best shitposts in this sub, if not THE best

25 MINS OF WAIT AND IM FINALLY CONNECTING TO... OH NEVER MIND. FAILED ATTEMPT NO 5.
---
WHO WANTS TO BET WHEN I FINALLY START PLAYING, I LL BE HARD CAMPED IN A MIN !
---
IT IS SO WORTH IT, ISNT IT ?!
---
So your method to counter the incredibly long wait times is to do something else?
---
How is that a valid solution?
---
If part of a game's experience is to play 2 games of solitaire while waiting for a lobby, something needs to be done by the game company.
---
Sebastian Castellanos, he'd be my main in a heartbeat. Maybe along with The Keeper as a killer, since all he really does is swing a giant hammer anyways (and already has 'the' in front of his name).
---
Pure skill
---
Because tons of people who use Urban, ALWAYS use it, even when on the way to get you off the hook and it wastes so much time. You ever go into struggle phase because somebody was Urban Evasioning to you rather than running for no reason at all? Until then, you won't get it.
---
Yea, the difficulty is dedicated servers have made grabs... inconsistent.  And getting stuck in a failed grab is a major PITA, as the survivors gets several advantages from it (not getting hit, head start on running, obviously not getting grabbed, ect).
---
Equal size and no moving parts.  But survour would be kl or mabey able to turn into the floor or 
---
wall
---
Also dbd2  just no.
---
Bruh moment

He didn't cleanse the totem next to the gen earlier, now noed is activated.

Or just go merciful on a last 2.  Make it pretty clear you have no intents to kill (Bonk a gen, drop them at it), then when they start to work on the gen, pluck em off of it.  Let em go, and move on.
---
Elaborate
---
I WAS PLAYING A GAME WITH A FACE-CAMPING TOXIC KILLER, SO I RETURNED THE FAVOUR BY D/C. THIS GUY HAD THE NERVE!!!!! THE AUDACITY!!!! THE COURAGE TO MESSAGE MEEEEEE ABOUT LEAVING AND TRIED TO JUSTIFY HIS ACTIONS. I PLAYED AN UNO REVERSE CARD ON TOP OF HIS, CAN I GET AN ‘F’ IN THE CHAT?
---
What planet do you inhabit? Oni is an outright superior Hillbilly, that doesn't have a learning curve, and isn't punishable.
---
I think tunneling and camping is boring, but tbh so are keys so oh well. I have no idea how you find ending the game early fun
---
No idea. But yes, you are correct.
---
basically cheating. lol
---
Honestly, I would personally prefer survivors not to it in THAT circumstance. Like, if 2 people DC one minute in, the 3rd instantly suicides on a hook, and I drop off the 4th at the hatch,
---
it was not a gg. It was a shitfest of a match that we both will be glad to end as fast as possible.
---
I prefer to keep gg's to matches that actually are worth being called a match (regardless of who won or how it played out in detail, of course), because if you call gg after everything, including the dumb shitshows, it devalues the term 'gg' itself, and turns it into an empty formality.
---
*(Obvious disclaimer that this is up to personal opinion and preference.)*
---
Yeah, I feel like you are just skimming my posts so you can build just enough context to have a "killer vs survivor" argument that I'm not interested in having. So I'm not going to have it with you.
---
Ash is so loud he even talks in the lobby
---
The limbo world championships would just look at the bar and consider it impossible and move on.
---
Yup. How else do you call it when a survivor group on comms knows the killers position at every single moment of the game only thanks to a single person running a perk and feeding the perk information to the entire group?
---
I met 7 clowns in 1 week. Last week at that.
---
5k against a strong optimal rank 1 swf team with meta perks and insta heals on the worst Killer map as a no blink nurse
---
Knockout might not work if you use his insta, not sure though.
---
I never said that I think ending the game early is fun. I am trying to figure out how his behavior is justified when it actively interferes with his ability to win. It appears from this discussion that most people condone his behavior, which is sad for a video game which not competitive at all. Rank means nothing, lots of things are unbalanced, rng controls a lot of the outcome of games, and skill gaps abound.
---
What about when a killer doesn't bring a mori?
---
That doesn't happen that much ROFL, stop lying.
---
I feel like this could be fixed pretty easily. There's already programing for AI to struggle while on the killer's shoulder. If someone disconnects rather than just popping them out of the game entirely an AI can take over struggling on the shoulder and on hook. Obviously it would be super easy for the killer to hunt down the AI but it would be better than them disappearing altogether.
---
eh, she hid her illness from her followers. which isn't... great
---
I often play swf with someone from my list but we never communicate via voice or chat while gaming, only with gestures. You say "one OoO in a SWF is basically cheating". Thats just dumb, no need to argue about that.
---
Like I said, elaborate on my lack of self-awareness because I’m not sure it means what you think it means.
---
Coordination.
---
SWF is explicitly intended for a group of coordinated players to play together against a killer. Can't exactly call it cheating if people do just that.
---
(Of course you're free to point out that it's an insane advantage over non-SWF and that it makes the game hard to balance.)
---
You get insta-killed if you're the last one alive and get hooked. The reason for this is that it saves time, because if you could still try to unhook yourself the killer would literally be standing there waiting for you to die or unhook, at which point he would down you and hook you again.
---
Yeah I never used gen-grabber Spirit before but got two grabs my first attempt.
---
But what about the countless examples on this sub where someone Kobe'd next to the hatch or an open exit gate and they had DS or a Styptic up?
---
I get the tunneling, that part makes sense I think. But the face camping does not
---
It sounds cool, but you need a way to remove the last stage of insanity, similar to the doctor, or it'll be way to strong
---
Everyone with common sense, yes.
---
&gt;You are fucking hilarious dude.
---
Same to you bro.
---
I'd assume there'd be a "snap out of it" like Doctor has.
---
Yeah that's what I be been thinking. And it should be kinda difficult to apply that effect, at least more than ghostfaces ability
---
Just fucking get rid of ranks
---
What movie is that picture from? Unless it is porn....
---
I can give you the numbers for luck. Slightly = 1%,  moderately = 2% considerably = 3%. Then the myers stalk rate increase by addons, slightly = 11%, moderately = 22%, considerably = 33%
---
Knockout is useless against SWF, Empathy, and Open Handed. Deerstalker is all positive for a killer reliant on slugging
---
Now, I don't have commons sense because I don't play the way, most people play.   
---
So again, If I disagree with you, you won't just explain like in the other comments.   
---
You are judgemental and insulting. 
---
I am sorry for whatever is wrong in your life.
---
Oni is a lot better and easier to play than Billy on the PTB right now, but that might change as Oni gets more balanced. Besides, Billy will always be cooler than Oni.
---
At the beginning of the game (field aprx 700-800 hrs) trapper was my main. Now I mostly play Billy and will always pay respect to decent billies, just like to other killers with decent mechanics. So yes, billy has a special place in this game.
---
Oh definitely. Whereas Ghost Face needs to only mark one survivor to expose them, I'd think that with each new state of sanity, Keeper would need to restart the marking process
---
You already get bp for that, even if you don't wiggle out..
---
You are onto something! Since there is a samurai, why not some type of Undead Native American with a longbow that can only be used long distance and there is a timer for how long he has to pick you up and hook you or a teammate can pick you up with full health. Survivor get notified that you are about to be shot, some sort of  battle cry the native american does and you get terror radius and maybe a split second to be able to dodge like hatchets from Huntress. The dlc add on survivors is a pilgrim and a nun.  Can Ghostface be considered a ninja?
---
Dud I‘m using xD too, it‘s a completely normal sign that you think something is funny
---
You can play however you want to play. Nobody is saying you NEED to play in a SWF with comms. But that doesn´t change the fact that most people who play in SWF do use comms. Which is why I said OoO in a SWF is "basically cheating" because I meant using it with voice comms.
---
Would it make you feel better if I said "OoO in a SWF with voice comms" or do I need to clarify it even more? Again, everyone with common sense understands that I am talking about a situation on voice comms. 
---
I couldn´t give a shred of fuck about what you think about me or how sorry you feel, so feel free to say what you want about my personality or my life if it makes you feel any better.
---
Trust me when I say that those countless examples are **FAR** outweighed by the number of times people sat on hook like assholes for 2 straight minutes of nothing, or tried to kobe and failed and sat there for one minute of nothing, or did actually kobe but got bitch slapped by the killer and then hooked again to sit there for another minute of nothing. Another thing is that those last ditch kobes rely on the killer being kinda mindless, the moment they make a patch note that says "Hey survivors get a chance if they're the last one left" the number of killers willing to walk away is gonna go wayyyyy down.
---
Whatever you gotta do. I say gg to keep things civil. Idgaf what the game was like.
---
You don’t lose your items, you lose your offering.
---
If you do lose your item, it’s possibly a visual bug. Same with when you see ‘-1 rank’
---
Been a very very very long time since I've seen it but the old guy hunter from jumanji the good one, not the shit with jack black in it.
---
I thought survive with friends was intended for people to survive with friends
---
Even if we could swap two unwanted map offerings for a random new map offerings, my Jumpscare Myers would be pleased.
---
IMPACT is the best font for memes. remember about the black boarder
---
countering spirit 101
---
You can use medkits for the self care one lol, you just need Self Care equipped
---
So if a killer has a terrible vaulting animation every killer should? Freddy vaulting animation is terrible imo, which is why seeing spirit get the same treatment pisses me off.
---
What now?
---
Tbh was gonna say she looked like she was missing a chromosome
---
It is to dissuade you from bringing it in future.
---
&gt;Hag isn't build to chase
---
Chasing isn't her strongest suit, but she fares far better at it than 60% of the killers in the game. You don't even have to really place a trap, you can fake it and most survivors will abandon the loop anyways. The fact of the matter is that she can shut down loops pretty efficiently, and pressure all over the map thanks to her teleports, which is something that, again, many killers can only dream of. 
---
&gt;The fact he can only do it every so often says otherwise
---
You aren't using it to it's full potential then. You don't really have to use it every time it's off CD, most experienced players will often just fake the teleport to get survivors off a gen, or use it mid-chase to get a hit from an unexpected direction. Besides, the cooldown isn't nearly as severe when you've gotten people asleep, which isn't difficult at all after the rework. If you think Freddy is not up to the task of facing Rank 1s, go watch Fungoose 4k-ing without even using addons.
---
&gt;We see how well that works for Clown
---
Clown has numerous other problems though, he is definitely not a good comparison. He has next to no map pressure, he slows down himself when he tosses a bottle, which essentially makes the slowdown the survivor has irrelevant, and he also needs to reload, further slowing down his game. Freddy's teleport fixes the lack of map pressure, Freddy isn't slowed down at all when he places his snares, and he doesn't have to reload them. Literally everything that Clown does wrong, he improves significantly upon. 
---
&gt;A trap isn't suddenly going to wreck the shack
---
Thank god for that, considering how quickly and effortlessly he can place them. It will however greatly lessen the time it takes to get a hit on one of the strongest map tiles in the game, so i don't see anything bad here. What, you wanted his traps to also instadown people for him to be viable? You yourself mentioned how much time is of the essence in this game, so i don't see how being able to shave off a bunch of time off of strong loops, and force down pallets quickly is bad. 
---
&gt;Oh, i can fake going the window at the shack to throw off the Demo and go the other direction
---
When a survivor is about to vault, the item they're holding disappears. Any killer worth his salt should be able to take notice and know to use Shred at that moment for a guaranteed hit. If they try to fake it, again, you hold down M2 and walk towards them. They'll either have to vault, or go towards the pallet, and since you'll have significantly closed the distance by then, you'll have no problems reacting to whatever of the 2 they decide to do.
---
&gt;You don't need to be able to notice subtle changes in grass to see where survivors are going? 
---
Spirit has SO many indicators of where a survivor is at any given moment. Like you mentioned, there's grass, there's scratchmarks, there's sound, and there's even blood if you bring that addon(and that's before we even mention that she could also just collide with you and know 100% where you were at that moment just until a few days ago). Meanwhile, survivors don't really have a clue about anything you do. You might be using your power, you might be standing still, who knows? This reason is why Spirit's skill floor is very low, and skill ceiling not that high. Nurse takes a lot of practice and muscle memory to be able to dominate, and Rank 1 Hillbillies need tons of practice to hit curvesaws effectively. Spirit needs none of that.
---
In any case, like it or not, the devs can't balance the game around the top 5% of players, especially since this isn't some e-sports game. If every killer is made with getting 4ks against rank 1 SWF in mind, then soloqueues might as well stop playing altogether, and god knows they are already extremely fucked right now anyways.
---
Just watching this makes me salty
---
God i ducking love it and this guy was pretty awesome to face against in Evil Within 1 and 2. 
---
I’d rather see Ruvik due to how awesome Ruvik is and how awesome he looks.
---
But your idea of basically paranoia is pretty cool. Only problem is Swf can stomp it.
---
No I actually lost both a Yellow and Green Tool box because of Killer DC, I've checked my locker and its gone/
---
If it happens again maybe message BHVR. Definitely isn’t the norm for that to happen.
---
99% of the time, there is a reason why people are bm'ing.
---
Common reasons include, op and/or annoying addons, offerings and perks, such as Noed, Rancor, Ruin (/s), Tier 3 Exhaustion doctor addon, Irihead, Prayer Beads, Ebony Moris,
---
There's 60 serum by my count, and they're used in groups of 10, so it sounds like something odd is happening to you.
---
T1 meyers gets this easy.
---
Are you implying that they should nerf insidious on legion? You know it's core on him right?
---
Simply by looking at Franks terrified face you can guess what happens next
---
 By the looks of it, killer brought in a purple and green add on which I guess is the ones that increases infection from her puke. These are by far the top tier addons for plague. And she has got ebony. And she has got ruin pop bbq which are also top tiered perks. On top of that, it’s a plague. So the survivors clearly aren’t that pleased with the overpowered perks/addons and she seemed to have only secured two Mori in the whole span of five gens. That’s poor performance and she might have just deserved some retribution. Albeit the survivor fked up on their part two but that’s fun to watch. I won’t be siding with the killer though. Nothing to be sympathetic about if you’re trying so hard but still almost let two got away.
---
Only intellectuals can understand this meme! Your brain hurts cause it’s growing!
---
The problem is jumping into lockers isn;t fun for both killer and survivors. I mean, what kind of counterplay is it? "lol, just die". From the killer side he can't even use his power properly.
---
But can he do a reverse chainsaw on quentin hiding in a corner ?
---
XD XD XD XD XD XD XD
---
It’s a joke
---
The Best of them is freddy , but for perks I will go for clown
---
Ah yes finally a fun and viable counter to looping!
---
What people sometimes don't realize is that there a huge lot of interrupt/grab opportunities in the game, it's not just gens/totems. It's also a grab when a person jumps off the locker, a grab off the gates switch, but most importantly - window/pallet grab when survivor is injured. It's not that hard, you just follow an injured survivor and wait for them to vault. Unless they are complete dookey about it and just keep 360 around you without even trying to run away - but then you just hook the guy and go for another.
---
I'm not sure if grabbing a trapped survivor counts tho.
---
This. Vault grab is the easiest way to complete this.
---
“That’s it I’m getting me granddad!”
---
The faces xd
---
I understand that, annoying survivors deserve it, survivors who've done nothing wrong shouldn't be punished the same way
---
Pretty creative
---
Voluntary giving out a sacrifice state to a killer as a best way to counterplay doesn't sound healthy tho
---
Why? He doesn't need instadowns
---
Idk why people are so fixated on the blood orb stuff.
---
Well it's not hard to ask
---
Guessing you've never played Half Life.
---
Huntress next please?
---
Makes you think, wonder if there's a game already created by the same developer with the exact killer you're talking about
---
This way around it's not low rank survivors who are telling Oni is crazy tho. Rather it's high rank killers who are speaking about it
---
This kinda feels like the Iron Will to counter Spirit sure it works but not every killer is going to get countered by that perk so if people wanna run no mither just to counter Oni then that's their choice
---
First try, did it on an unsafe pallet vault, only one it might be hard with is like huntress, also nurse if you’re on a map with a ton of walls.
---
Or gen grab spirit if you’re evil.
---
I find it pretty stupid and keys have never bothered me as killer or survivor. If I notice a key I bring franklins as it helps a lot. I also pay attention who has said key and will try to go after them I won’t tunnel or camp though. I just play the game normal
---
*Roses are red*
---
*Violets are purple*
---
*My main is pig*
---
*I like to watch urkle*
---
Realistically I kinda don't see "not getting hit" as a viable counterplay. As well as having a wingman with a flashlight.
---
Just because I like playing Trapper and because it's sometimes hard to get his traps to work, I also know it's not really hard to hit people. It can be hard if you're just playing "hold W chase" all the time, but a little mindgame here, a little there, and you won't be *THAT* weak as an M1 killer.
---
Should have looked a bit more to the left earlier and gotten out there,  jacket boy...
---
I dunno, that took quite a lot of shots to down Jake, still feels quite weak, another rework pls
---
Devs said they tried testing that and they did not like it for whatever reason
---
Hey to be fair he was a good dad to a certain point he worked his ass off to pay for things like her school

Pretty gay of you to say that.

Freddy or pig bc they’re paid only

It's already there for Freddy, the only Killer borrowed time absolutely useless against.
---
Because people would use it to troll other people
---
* Excessive self-promotion - Follow Reddit's 1:10 guideline (1 self-promotion / self-content submission per every 10 submissions) and actively participate in other posts and discussions if you would like to promote yourself or someone you represent on /r/deadbydaylight.
---
This might be decent with insidious
---
In what universe does a player actively tunnel someone down just because they are gay? In fact, even if this cosmetic were a thing, I dont think the Killer would even notice, much less care. Also, anyone throwing slurs at you in the end game chat was probably already going to do it regardless if your gay or not. Dont get me wrong, people using slurs to insult people isnt healthy, but its just a fact of the internet and anonymity. And as for the cosmetic not fitting, as someone said in this thread, just because the holiday events arent horror related doesnt mean you can just start adding in cosmetics that relate to themes of sexuality. Holidays and sexuality just arent two comparable mediums for cosmetics.Not to mention, the cosmetics dont express the player, they express the characters you play, so unless they add a gay character, it just wouldnt make sense to add the cosmetics outside of support for the lgbt community.

el 21 de diciembre hay una frikifest tambien, capaz vamos (?

Thanks for the detailed guide! Would you mind if we add this post to our [New Player Guides &amp; Resources Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d5elu7/guides_resources_for_new_players/)?
---
And the main problem is that this counter is super unfun for both sides. As the survivor you just need to give up and as the killer you can't use your power properly.
---
Yeayea Freddy was bad. But what about Legion though?
---
I dont know ... sounds kinda gay to me
---
Just use infectious fright
---
Slaughter them
---
I used to do that but It's been harder to decide that way for me since they added BP rewards. 
---
Wiggling to milk a few extra BPs out of a lost game is the new default and I have a hard time punishing survivors I intended to let go for doing that.
---
It wasn't always so bad, it was kinda in the recent months he started complaining a lot. But he makes really huge points, sound issues, God loops, meta perks, and survivor objectives, they are all problems that need to be solved and have plagued the game. 
---
It is complaining but a lot of it is justified.
---
I mean it was kinda obvious, Killers cant get any nice things

It's obviously true that pure m1 is weaker than killer who have something to shorten the chase directly, but it's definitely not laughably weak. If you're 115% m1 everything is up to your skills as killer in pure m1 chases. Honestly I don't even consider old Freddy to be a joke. Surely he was low tier, but you could 4K pretty often if you know your stuff.
---
While Oni being tall is definitely bad for mindgames, I don't see any good player being looped whole game without activating m2. I mean, yeah, you can at least stall him for some time, but the only viable counterplay to his m2 voiced as hiding in lockers is just bonkers.
---
What are they?
---
... and they also need to keep the low (as in bad / numerically high) ranks from being too killer-sided (outside of deranked veteran survs) and erode the player base from the other end. That skew seems often forgotten due to filter bubbles.
---
Oh
---
Well I don’t see that happening
---
Bold of you to assume she would just let them throw stones at her. She would cut them down because that’s her samurai way
---
Well thats my opinion, if you dont like it, why are you even commenting?
---
Nah you cant use them too buy new Millers on ipad on ipad u cant use blood pointes to level up im using theme for moris btw my username is x___x

Survivors: "dwight why are you so bad at this?"
---
Baby Dweet: *blows generator, throws pallet down in panic, steps in bear trap*
---
Survivors: "ugh, can't believe I'm stuck with this guy"
---
Killers: "dwight why are you so bad at this?"
---
Killers: "dwight why are you so fucking adorable?"
---
Baby Dweet: *jumps in locker right in front of the killer*
---
Killers: "im taking this child to the hatch and nobody can fucking stop me"
---
The cosmetics were free for everyone, theoretically no one paid for them and BHVR made 0 profit of them. Therefore free to all, not a problem there at all. They were given to a small amount for no cost now given to all.
---
They are different games with dofferent cores, f13 the game is a game based on Jason, dbd is a game based on original and license killers feeding the entity.
---
The nurse is still god tier, the rework just removed some completely broken things.
---
Yup.
---
As long as the first Obsession didn't die (In which case I believe it wipes your stacks), you can get Decisively Struck to swap Obsessions and get more stacks for Dying Light.
---
I mean when you die you drop your item so someone else can just go and pick it up right?
---
Diatech and bloodletting.
---
Yeah new Freddy is one of the best killers in the game, and despite losing what made him unique, he is very fun to play. This rework was awesome.
---
Myers addon on omega stalk foem obsession
---
Idea.  Show the winn/loss ratio for each killer and buff/nerf blood point gains based on win percentage.  Same with survivors.
---
I want this so bad. Was just talking about it.
---
Frank lmao
---
Happened to me a few times as well
---
Man surveillance it's a fucking delicious perk , but if you just want this wait for the shrine
---
Lots of flashlight clicking spam but after sweating bullets I got a 3k and they were silent
---
And gutted her base power as a bonus. Say what you want, only the most dedicated nurses are any good now, high ranks are pretty much nurse-free already, compared to before.
---
I'm just imagining a glowing hex totem in the middle of the shirt, with the words right underneath......and then above it is a sledgehammer about to smash into it.
---
Nope, just make different gen times for ranks.
---
Thank God I wasn't the first to say it.
---
Obviously, but even you would agree, Jason would be very lackluster in this game. We already have the Trapper as a bootleg anyway.
---
I mean she DID leave the town when she was infected. Probs saved some people from getting infected
---
she look like a skullgirl character...so cool :3
---
I understand your anger, it's happened to all of us, but it's a difficult one to "fix". Like others have already said, people on the hook can easily troll the person saving. You don't think those same morons making an unhook in front of the killer are gonna kick people off them until the killer gets closer? On the rare occasion I play survivor, I always bring DS. Best thing you can do is start using DS or accept you have shit teammates, die on the hook, move on to the next match and hope you don't end up with another batch of idiots on your team. I'm a killer main, playing solo survivor is a chore. I rarely have fun, if I don't have morons for teammates, I've got a camping/tunneling killer. I have far more fun going against a 4 man SWF at rank 1 than I do most survivor matches running solo.
---
If you think that’s bad, try the VR version. You can actually lean out into the halls to check and see him barreling towards you. Absolutely pants-shitting.
---
Me and my fiance watched a few people who played so he started playing it and a few weeks after I got a pc so I started playing it and now theres no going back
---
I'm a special snowflake too!
---
Puppers is the only one I've seen recently. Otherwise, Twitch videos of the PTB should be around still.
---
Who the fuck ever complained about bloodwarden lol ?
---
Fire Up too op btw. And pls nerf Calm Spirit.
---
no
---
This is good art
---
I'm biased towards the Pig. People say she's low tier, but Pig with Sloppy Butcher and Nurse's calling is so great.
---
I though I got rid of this post because when I was posting because I had a spelling error in the title
---
Frank’s face in the last panel is a whole ass mood.
---
Seriously, Nurse and PB Spirit had it coming, but devs must have had some rotten truffles to hate Pig so much. Give her *something* back at last!
---
There are so many dcs loading time is forever and you’ll probably get a dogshit killer or a rank 4
---
Wouldn't say "absolutely", but he counters it with the least effort
---
Feedback besides "Nope"
---
I just don't like Streamers in general :)
---
Nobody is talking shit about Tru3 he is fun. It's just that he tries to hard at being an optimal DbD scientist
---
When you are insane and watch a killer doing gen rush
---
Not necessary stupid mechanic, better? No fun in doing gens or holding a button. The fun is in chases m8
---
So it actually makes Autodidact decent
---
how does my idea differ from yours "different gen speeds per rank"
---
Far from gutted, just made it more fair.
---
Nurse was always supposed to be a very high skill-cap killer, because she's mechanically broken and if everybody can master her, the meta is dead. Now we're back to normal level of Nurse presence (aka, you still see her way more than Doctor/Legion/Clown at red ranks), and it's okay.
---
Honestly I’d rather take the dc penalty than have to play oni with no power.
---
On console yeah he'll be more chill and possibly not as strong but on pc there are concerns
---
He’s still too weak. He could use 3rd person mode
---
Cleansing totems to reduce slow down gens. I think we’re done here if you can’t understand that😂😂
---
Ez bloodpoints
---
On a side note that survivor must get confused af
---
Sounds good. I've never faced more than one guy with no mither and let's be honest the perk is garbage. It's not like oni wouldn't had a chance against 4 guys that are one hit lol
---
I think you're ignoring the point of why he does that. He gets matched up solo with people who aren't very good as survivor, then gets matched up as killer against a team that pops 3 gens in a minute and a half because a lot of people run swf.
---
*disconnected*
---
Well, look forward to the Ghostface nerf coming in a month or two.
---
PC and did you dc in my arms?
---
Ooooh! Cool :0
---
Still, the chances of running into a 4 man No Mither squad are very low. Also, if Oni with no power happens too often, they could just keep the power charge you get from hitting someone.
---
And I'll say it again, you're way more likely to run into 1 or 2 people with No Mither than running into a full No Mither squad
---
I figure deadites would be a super cool addition. Seeing as they can "infect" the others in the movie they could slowly infect the survivors and make them not as competent at repairing, sabo or healing as the survivors minds/ body parts would be under the deadites influence.
---
Piggy needs more love. You might even have Survivors try to boop the snoot.
---
Ds used to be a good perk to bring, but most killers aren't stupid enough to pick you up immediately, since ds now only works for a minute after unhooked.
---
That is certainly pretty fun. Just wanted to take it out of meme perk status and give it a viable use without being entirely meta worthy.
---
Master Skywalker, there are too many of them, whatever will we do
---
They just dont know i guess
---
I don’t really think this is that strong as it’s pretty obvious which one is the killer and which one is a survivor a killer would probably be chasing you instead of doing a gen? The skin doesn’t matter any good player would be able to tell killer from survivor. Also too similar to the doctors power in its concept
---
Freddy is hella fun to play, i p3´ed him even before his rework, but now he’s really strong and really cool to play, also he’s totally viable at high ranks
---
You realize this is well known yes?
---
Way to butcher a meme format.
---
I forgive you,
---
I was thinking the same thing xd.
---
Yeah the survivors should just let us win.
---
3 swing down
---
(Some witty quote at the end of this meme)
---
i just wanted to highlight it bc it's very cool
---
Can we get a kek for spirit
---
The problem is that his madness came from the complete abscence of hope, he already has no hope and therefore could not be a survivor.
---
Thank you very much 😊
---
I can agree with this, but I wish he would just accept that solo queuing doesn't have the benefits of swf and stop saying how much worse his team is than the team he just vsed, it's the biggest turn off to his content imo
---
Thank you very much and same, im desperate to play her myself ✊
---
It’s so funny how we recognize survivors to their torturous screams
---
Hillbilly looks like he's nae nae-ing
---
Can't have No Mither counter any more powers or it'll lose it's "hard mode" status.
---
Can't get injured from bear traps if you're already injured.
---
Can't be insta-downed by a chainsaw if you're already injured.
---
Can't be insta-downed from EW3 if you're already injured.
---
Can't be insta-downed by a (crappier) chainsaw if you're already injured.
---
Can't be injured by being stabbed 28 times if you're already injured.
---
No need to cleanse from being vomited on if you're already injured.
---
Can't be insta-downed from being marked if you're already injured.
---
NOW you want to never be insta-downed from being bonked if you're already injured and never bleed?
---
(In all seriousness go ahead but No Mither really needs changed at this point tbh)
---
Yeah, theres a lot of downsides to tru3 i can write about as if doing a case file but mostly hes just to egotistic and not that good thats why he promotes to dont stalk with GF and think Spirit is balanced. With the misinformation and negativity he spreads, you cant really support him can you? At this point making fun of him is the most fun there is to be
---
There are 17 killers now (I think), so I don't see any problem with one being not played much for being hard to master. 
---
I'd rather have this than killers not being played because they're trash, like Clown, Bubba or Doctor.
---
Point is, Nurse is in a perfectly healthy situation, and good nurse players will still absolutely wreck survivor groups.
---
Why are you booing me
---
I am right
---
Just better manners would be ok for me - but i dont wanna Play demo to just get assaulted with ggez after a match
---
I am on pc but i dont dc
---
But this effectively ruins the Killers enjoyment.
---
isn't this happen from killer side also? there is a rework and killers already cry about it instead of playing for a little and try to adapt? "Nurse is gutted" "Rip spirit", meanwhile if we watch the good killerplayers on twitch they can win with actually bad killers, they literally go out of their way to dont tunnel and still win probably 50% times.
---
This is nearly as bad as informing everyone you're a vegan. Nobody asked, nobody cares. Why can't people just enjoy the game. We don't need this SJW lefty cringe in the game.
---
also it's not beneficial for survivors to seal portals since it takes time, give the demo a notification and it gives the portal back so idk why are they complaining?
---

---
Tbh the only thing I dislike about him is the amount of times he says "you shouldn't give toxic players any attention" and then he proceeds to make "TOXIC SURVIVORS GET STOMPED" like God damn
---
It's not a bug though.
---
You're all over the place man. It's like I'm talking to multiple people. You starting out saying that it's so much fun to play him, but you don't because people destroy your portals. Now you hate playing him?
---
The animation is based on speed and angle. Can’t do much about it
---
Lithe bb
---
The difficulty is that dedicated servers keep stealing your grabs.
---
It was a sarcasm "its so much fun playing demo and having your portals destroyed in 12 seconds" the whole sentence implied that its not fun to Play demo because you have your portals destroyed so fast
---
Ohmwrecker has a couple videos up.
---
Probably gonna get downvoted but nobody cares about your gender identity politics. Why can't people just enjoy the fucking game.
---
Everybody said the plague was OP because they cleansed asap.
---
In what world is spending 12 seconds (solo!) Not beneficial to destroy a killers map control not beneficial?
---
d0u lo voy a poner en la agenda(?
---
I made wait did someone else make this already
---
Why not just make the bleed down timer tick down progressively faster when all survivors are downed?
---
I thought this was real and when I saw it was not I legit shed a tear. Man we've been asking for this since release...
---
Unfourtanley ruin is pretty much required in high ranks.
---
hahahahahaha
---
#y-e-s
---
this patch literally fixes another broken survivor shit also with the BL hard nerf (nobody will run it after this)
---
Oni-kun
---
wait hol' up I've seen people paint on paper with blood  
---
it's the same consistency as yours  
---
explain?
---
12 seconds that can be spend on healing and doing gens, also it makes it so you may have an idea where the demogorgon can pop through
---
And again, demogorgon cannot replace a portal on his own, so if you complete a gen next to it, it's basically a dead zone and an useless portal
---
So far I been hearing more ppl scream about not nerfing him then posts on this sub saying nerf lol
---
It’s to test for bugs. Shot breaks every patch, BHVR can’t test every interaction so they need people playing things to see. 
---
You don’t get the number of games to test out how a killer will perform, especially when no one knows how to counter them.
---
What have I said that is different from that?
---
&gt;it's so much fun to play him, but you don't because people destroy your portals
---
Are you saying that even without breaking portals he is not fun either?
---
So his portals are bad because if you want to do gens you can just destroy it - and when you already have a gen nearly done you can just leave it to destroy his ability even more
---
nurse possessed him
---
I know, I love the guy, he's still entertaining. It's just that it gets annoying when he keeps asking for builds but then throws them under the bus when they don't work.
---
I remember someone gave him a stealth build once and he ran around like normal so he went down quickly, blaming the build instead of himself for not changing his playstyle for one game. Even in one of his recent videos where he had unbreakable, dude didn't use it when it would've helped him escape, instead blaming his teammates and his chat. 
---
It's just getting annoying is all.
---
If I spot a key in my lobby I just swap to Franklin's, smack the key holder, then face camp the key. Funny thing is I still somehow end up with 2k+ at the end.
---
Did you mean to post this 3 times?
---
Learned that the hard way.
---
Nah I think he should have a rocket launcher
---
Jokes on you, I only ran haunting grounds
---
You most definitely DC if you cant win
---
In response to someone who said that no one plays Demogorgon, you said that  it is because he is not fun and it is the survivors fault. But clearly you do not find Demogorgon fun regardless of what the survivors do. So why do you have to make everything into a complaint about survivors?
---
Legion 
---
..
---
U
---
Aight my mans who do you main?
---
Ok you can get technical and pedantic on language.
---
It is an unplanned exploit. It is an unplanned mechanic. It was unplanned. They did not mean for it to be in the game. Therefore this is not part of a buff and a nerf - as this thread is treating it.
---
OK it is not a direct coding bug. But in all casual meaning of the word; it is a bug.
---
I really love this Hospital Escape.    
---
Anyone know where it came from?
---
Because it would be fun to play even the weaker killers but thanks to our wonderful community playing the weaker killers is just an invitation to ego maniacs to walk all over you
---
I dont mind loosing but i will not subject myself to all the toxicity and for what? For playing the game that's supposed to be fun?
---
yea we have leatherface an hillblly, legion and ghostface, maybe jason and trapper.
---
Why did you post this more than once?
---
You posted this 3 or 2 times in a row. Check your post history.
---
I like this idea.
---
I wish she looked like that in-game.
---
“My uneducated opinion is more valid than yours. I’ve studied Oni for months now and I can tell he needs a nerf. Rank 21 btw”
---
I do this anyway. Mainly because the killer always goes to where I am when I hear that god damn heart beat unless they chasin someone.
---
&gt; What do you think they could do for her dash that would make it stronger in the chase?
---
Put a link to Scorpionz' clips in loading screen tips.
---
Watch out, we have a console war kid
---
Ok, that's a lore-friendly explanation. Thanks m8
---
Accurate chart. Because I love Ash so much he's my singular survivor main, and because of how loud he is, I usually play aggressively.
---
&gt; Okay, so we're back to square one. You want survivors to just let you win?
---
"just better manners would be ok for me"
---
You forgot that NM is a counter to all one-hit perks/add-ons too.

OP CRUSHES the MILLENIAL LIBTARD survivormains with FACTS and LOGIC, get OWNED you ENTITLED scum B)
---
Oni just needs to have his flick removed, like Hillbilly's was.
---
yeah but the mending timer will go down while he’s chasing you. so it only extends ur chase by like 10 seconds.
---
Can’t even wield it without 2-handing. *Casul*.
---
This is why NOED exists. It's our final struggle. It's our limit break. It's the only way to prevent a string of shitty-ass movie sequels with the same protagonist showing up like 7 times in a row.
---
Didn’t think about that, that’s awful.
---
yeah, they doin some weird stuff with this undetectable shit
---
PWYF, Nemesis, Enduring, and Whispers for Infinite Tombstone Myers. The biggest problem with the build is now solved as your obsession switches to someone you're in chase with instead of hoping you find the right survivor first.
---
H-have you seen how fucked Oni is rn?
---
I don't think they're gonna Freddy him (and they shouldn't) but I do think his power shouldn't break pallets, and maybe the blood orbs should all despawn when his power runs out
---
Turn off the chat, and now you can play any killer in the game.
---
He has a pretty high bloodtinge too
---
If it's my friends and bvb they're being chased, I'd still pop that, but not randoms
---
True, I don’t mind it as much since it adds a new element, it’s the purple or ultra rare add ons for medkits that are situationally useless now.
---
I know for some people it’s barley anytime at all, it’s just, that long for a grind? Seems to long
---
There is no option on pc to hide the chat, besides that doesnt eliminate bad manners in game
---
I dont know why you are arguing with me - find a better explanation to why people dont like playing demo then
---
Not that big but we're in a game where a tenth of a second can change landing a hit or not. So it matters I guess.
---
Sorry what’s the flick ?
---
I got your back brother
---
Healing beside a pallet and pulled it down ... sigh
---
1 gen alone takes 80 seconds it is actually slower if 2 or more help but that is counteracted if people hit skill checks gen rushing usually happens when a killer is too focused on one goal while not applying map pressure
---
I have so many questions.
---
Freddy for his power it clown for his perks
---
Excuse u Dex build ftw
---
Thanks, my waifu needs some love theese days, the Nerf Is near :'(
---
Nvidia overlay settings
---
deerstalker obviously
---
They key words are "**if you stun him**". Drop pallet earlier and don't blind him. Same as you would counter spirit fury, nothing difficult. Yes, you would get downed a few times firstly, but then you will use this knowledge and adapt, just as you would adapt to spirit fury.
---
I enjoy watching him small doses. Too much and it’s like the whole world is wrong. I like the 4 player sandbagging at the moment lol
---
Imagine protecting tru and and making otz look bad even tho he is one of the nicest dbd players in all of history
---
Dweet main is in the locker so you don't enter it
---
As someone who favours the Huntress, and is pretty new at the game, i would like to say thanks to the pallet dancers.
---
Means nothing. He's still added to the shitstorm of memes attacking him here. It's ridiculous and hiding it behind "Hee hee, I don't means it but...." comments isn't going to excuse him. He knows what he's doing.
---
Oh god, imagine not being able to suck up blood orbs on very, very rare occasions. Like I said before, the Oni can retain the ability to charge his power from hitting a No Mither survivor for all I care, so my proposed change doesn't even mean he can't charge his power even during a 4-man No Mither game. Also, 4 man No Mither games are so rare, that even after 1000+ hours, I have yet to run into one of them.
---
So most of the time, you'd run into only 1 or 2 No Mithers max. Which means bloodorbs are still a thing.
---
Additionally they get a few survivors that they can insta down at any point in the match. I really don't see how this could possibly ruin the killers enjoyment.
---
Meanwhile, if this remains unchanged, the Oni ruins the No Mither using survivor his enjoyment.
---
The Oni totally gets rid of one of the upsides of No Mither, meanwhile, you're just giving the killer a constant supply of blood orbs (as if you weren't enough of a detriment to your team already) You have no place to hide as the killer always has a trail of blood orbs leading right to your location.
---
I never have a problem with gen rushing unless it's a optimal team. Applying map pressure and knowing when to cut off a chase is important.
---
If you have trouble doing well without Ruin, here's an easy general winning formula: tunnel the first survivor out of the match relentlessly, and then you can camp and slug to really disrupt the match once only 3 survivors are left in it. I find having perks that help end the chases on that first survivor as quickly as possible to be more consistently effective in this strategy than Ruin. But Ruin is obviously still great to have, and it does allow one to play in a more sportsmanship manner without the match progressing too fast, which it without Ruin indeed not seldomly does.
---
Need some survivor lore here :D
---
He needs metamorphosis and during that form he would be throwing chainsaws to everywhere in the map.
---
That was a bad play on his half you should of tryed to juke or drop the pallet then he would of made the windoe
---
Yes and with the fact survivors can reset pallets now it forces you to legit break almost if not all pallets it’s irritating that killer shack pallet is now more of a threat. Nerf nerf nerf how about leave us killer mains tf alone for once Jesus christ
---
booping the snoot will get you killed, a small price to pay
---
Fact im using scoop ahoy steve makes this even better
---
Someone mind telling me why I had the sound off and still heard the combine beep after the kill?
---
Its as if they want to spend money....crazy I know
---
No u don't get how powerful it is for killers to control who the obessesion is gonna be which such ease and also slap that on spirit or hag and that's gonna be dumber bc again IT REWARDS A NEGATIVE THING FOR KILLERS
---
Exactly! A bunch of snobby little cunts keep on begging the devs to nerf killers. It’s all about the fucking survivors
---
Yeah that is such a weird and outlandish theory!
---
children's.... subreddit.... whom ever reported this... you do know that DBD is a horror game that's rated 16+... right? .... there's litteral death in the game...
---
The saltier rank one noobs downvoting me hahahaha comerme la polla
---
there were videos of him literally tunneling the fk out of survs, good gameplay? ok.
---
Just needs Bubba's screaming xD
---
You open the Geforce experience overlay, you go to Game Filter, and then you select Brightness + Contrast, and then you set the values up however you like them. It should make you a preset, hence everytime you'll open the game i'll automatically be this bright.
---
I had that happen to me once and boi, that's when I found out that I wasn't the killer. It was them all along, because they killed my confidence.oof
---
I play with headphones so my upstairs neighbor doesn’t get the wrong idea. Or the right idea.
---
Hey kids! I've got free candy

Ahhh okay I get it.

---
that... ain't.. possible?????.... "these times are confusing."
---
Nah.
---
The detail in this drawing is incredible!! I'm loving it!!!
---
I would assume Outta Sigh Outta Mind has a cooldown otherwise very interesting I don't think totems would spawn in a 40m radius of each other but that is probably map dependant. Gray man idk what that could be used for but all in all interesting ideas
---
Can you be more specific and formulate your thoughts?
---
Yeah i already have those set to the max that doesnt make screen just white. It doesnt look like your game from clip at all. Thats why Im asking.
---
Nooooooooo
---
Hahahhahaha. Are you actually out of your mind? Rewarding with the highest reward for killers in the game just because you run into every pallet. And then for such a long time.
---
I was very specific in my other comment. But I can repeat it.
---
Take old DS which rewarded a survivor for getting downed by being able to escape the killers grasp faster than usually, this was a dumb perk bc of the fact getting downed is a bad thing you shouldn't be rewarded for that nor should the killer be punished for downing you which makes sense right?.
---
Or we can take old MoM which rewarded survivors for getting hits now that is all fine and dandy of they like saved another survivors life by taking said hit but it is not fine when the survivor can back pack this perk and gain a second chance when they did nothing to deserve it and again it punished killers that where M1 based for just doing what they are meant to do. Which again no perk should reward something negative bc it's good to punish whatever good thing the other players did.
---
Now here is where nemesis comes in just bc only legion can truly abuse this perk doesn't mean it's okay. Here is why, Nemesis rewards legion for something negative that happened to them basically the stun while it punishes survivors for someone positive getting the stun which u can argue "just don't stun" but when getting a stun can give u time to run away to the next loop or just the fact it gives more BP and there is literally a quest to get stuns that argument becomes flawed.
---
No perk not a single one should reward a player for something negative that happened to them without it having a actually counterplay.

My example of a perk that does that well is Unbreakable which can save a lost game but the killer at that point has made their mind clear about 1 of 2 things "slug all day" or "slug for the win". If nemesis was like Unbreakable in a way it can at one point punish survivors for stunning almost like spirit fury does *but imo spirit fury is like MoM in the way u don't alter ur playstyle and it just works* then okay fine make nemesis fair but currently it is not
---
My main point no perk should reward negative things while punishing the positive side
---
I must pet it. I must boop  its snoot.
---
The filter is "Brightness/Contrast"
---
Exposure 40%
---
Contrast -36%
---
Highlights -66%
---
Shadows -66%
---
Gamma 12%
---
Holy shit thats amazing!
---
Lol.
---
Oh the hypocrisy in here is REAL.
---
Yeah. Trash someone ELSE for "not adapting", all the while trying to guilt everyone into forgoing NOED, and tunneling, and Ruin...all legit parts of the game that YOU, THEOUGH YOUR OWN LACK OF SKILL, CANNOT DEAL WITH.
---
So you try to make "rules" to make your side of the game easier on you.
---
Thank you
---
Yea sounds rly fun but I imagine with no cooldown the killer turns around to check the area out reactivating the perk and YEEHAW lol
---
lmao
---
don’t
---
Same. She looks rough in-game. But, are ya surprised? Look at Nancy &amp; Steve 😂
---
How can you be new and playing against rank 1s?
---
I thought the same thing, it looks lit because of the fire from the barrel messing with the shade but if you pause its normal lol but i definitely had a small heart attack for a sec
---
"The fuck you say about my granddaughter?"
---
Anythings possible in this bug nowadays
---
The fuck? You should always be breaking shack pallet because you cannot ~mindgame it.
---
Rin is here only because he hopes to meets her father among the survivors once to kill him. After that her vengeance we'll be gone, so will the Spirit. So it is not likely the Entity is ever going to fulfill its promise
---
That's never the way I've heard him frame it especially when he got overly pissed off a meme saying he calls out stream sniping too much. 
---
I'm not saying he's bad at the game he knows how to play and I don't doubt that's a part of it but going "you shouldn't give them any attention man just so unfun" that doesn't sound like how otz as a example says it "she is following me not doing gens which works in my favor" but that is probably also bc otz is informative on all his moves usually at least
---
I mean no hate to Tru3
---
Dedicated servers
---
Is that so bad?
---
Injured survivor: *Does generator*
---
The Oni: Absorb
---
Also everyone is a toxic SWF
---
I agree on Nancy but Steve looks amazing? He's a spot on recreation of Joe Keery's face (as people have said somewhere else, they probably scanned his face whereas they had to work with references for hers).    
---
But since they asked about our satisfaction on their looks in the player satisfaction survey, maybe they're looking into it?
---
 LEG-endary
---
thats the spirit
---
I aint a "fan" of his, but i do watch his videos every now and again.. but in one of his videos he actually said to ignore them. Because they'd come to you and won't be near any pallets/Windows.
---
Spam the reload button to do a slow clap.
---
His “play style” may not be but his attitude absolutely is
---
Dont abuse the perk and you wont get tunneled. Killers want to have a chance insted of having all actions revealed, but constantly looking = you act like you share info constantly. :/
---
I just want the definitions of increase and decrease to be more clear.
---
Hex: 3 man game, cannot truly be stopped. The devs tried to get rid of it, but it patiently waited for its opportunity to return.
---
uh, i'm assuming you're implying that disconnecting would somehow make you invincible or something like that? because i didn't say that anywhere and im not sure why you think i did. OBVIOUSLY it wouldn't make you invincible lol.
---
Probably it is not porn, porn isn't that subtle
---
Yea . I switched channels on twitch and witnessed him calling the survivors toxic swf, while tunneling with forever freddy build.  And then mildly complaining about DS =_= i like him, but sometimes this is too much
---
Updated
---
I hope you understand that you are in a cult of personality
---
Yup. Anything that sounds pretty good on paper is instantly called op. That's just how it works on here unfortunately.
---
Well I think we need perks like Nemesis to beat the living shit out of your overconfident ass. Have fun getting your tongue ripped out over and over again you saucy cunt
---
Everybody quick! Downvote this OP!
---
Soo... what happens if you cleanse it?
---
Yes I didn't know the names but Quentin is indeed handsome
---
These are hidden on every map. On haddonfield theyre under the benches for example
---
I had my first encounter with it yesterday actually. I was playing Huntress and actually threw a hatchet through a tree and hit a poor Nea.
---
Sorry. Mesnt to put /s
---
I think the issue was there weren't enough red rank survivors for queues so red rank killers had very long queue times.
---
Literally, they just love preaching to choir. It's common knowledge that this reddit doesn't like him and spreads a lot of ignorance and misinformation about him
---
He had fat-roll, DEX points for STR build? Good luck
---
Asshole community but it is a great game. One of my favorites
---
yes it isn't complicated to find hatch as killer either. Idk how you're playing as killer for 3-man hatch escapes to be super common, but it isn't simple to pull off and can easily be denied for 1 or 2 of the survivors.
---
Unless the survivors have multiple keys, and the killer has like no pressure on them whatsoever, 3-4 survivors aren't getting out that hatch.
---
As far as Mori's go, I would agree that they can be changed a bit, but they shouldn't be nerfed into the ground like some idiots want. Removing or destroying entire mechanics in the game is a stupid idea of balance and a lazy attempt at making things balanced.
---
Everyone gets kicked from the game and all offerings and add-one and items are refunded
---
And who wins? The survivors or the killer?
---
Yeah I’m horrible with realistic drawing this is one of the first time I’ve done something realistic really
---
This thread turned into literal clown fiesta. I wish we had a kind of balance council (consisting of people who play the game a lot- maybe fog whisperers) who could openly discuss the ongoing controversies in an objective manner. But instead we can throw git guds at each other like a bunch of reddit monkeys we are.
---
That’s where the skill gap comes in, good Onis will need to learn and gain map sweatiness for stuff like that
---
They did do Natalia Dyer very dirty! I love playing Nancy but she looks frightening, they gave here too many eyelashes or something, I don't know what it is but there's something very wrong with her eyes anyway. But yeah Yui's face looks amazing in the trailer and in the PTB... not so much. Not Nancy's face levels of bad but still slightly disappointing. Even her survivor portrait doesn't look like the trailer.

I mean, I don't even like the insta down hatchets. &gt;.&gt; You're still going down at the pallet tho.  
---
Provided my PC doesn't do the hang error and crash. Again. -.-
---
My insta is @roseydoe! I just... have a massive crush on Kate and now Yui comes in and my heart explodes.
---
Behavior, because you spent 15 bucks on a game that doesn’t work
---
Wait, I thought Oni was Spirit's dad?
---
Spirit fury combo ensures you are getting hit.
---
For me, as the ghostface player, making spirit fury work always meant that the survivor goes down, as he is exposed and he never has time to go anywhere else. 
---
Once again, if it has a counterplay, it is not OP. It is definitely stronger than Spirit Fury, yet it has the same simple counterplay. The Old Legion didn't have that counterplay, you were going down no matter what you did. In case of Nemesis Legion, you can just not stun the killer.
---
And why are you ignoring the beast of prey legion? This perk, unlike Nemesis, activates no matter what survivor does and has no actual counterplay.
---
when you think about it there aren't a lot of intentionally evil killers
---
legion is one, clown is one, doctor is mostly one, ghostface is one i think, and pig kinda? maybe myers and freddy? i don't know their lore that well, are they just psychopaths who dont know better or do they enjoy hurting/killing? bc like demogorgon for instance is just an instinct-driven creature afaik
---
otherwise, billy, trapper, wraith, nurse, bubba, hag, spirit, plague, and i think even oni are all varing degrees of justifiable self-defense/revenge or accidents
---
IS THERE *NOT* ONE? I RECALL SOME PEOPLE SAYING THEY DISABLED THEIR CHAR
---
From the creators of: Reverse Chainsaw to the Quentin in the corner. 
---
We have: Chainsaw from the corner of the map to the Nancy in the Pallet.
---
Absolutely golden
---
Drop em earlier. Same counterplay as spirit fury. If you can't do that, then stfu and die everytime you face legion.
---
[The Naked Gun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXQIQYlRHD4)
---
On Legion: Moderately = 0.4 seconds, Considerably = 0.6 seconds, and Slightly = 0.2 seconds.
---
It's great
---
This challenge is easy as spirit. Just fake a phase and ppl fall for it quickly. But I'm having trouble with the "3 Gen Dark Sense in a single game" challenge. It's so hard to get done. Like I can get around 2-2.5 gens done and after that it goes downhill. The killer either tunnels/camps after so many gens get complete and I don't get another chance or the killer has so many gen repair decreasing perks like ruin/thanataphobia/dying light that it take forever for one gen and by the time just two gens get done everyone is on dying hook. Heck even with sneaky builds it can be difficult
---
still doesnt tell you how much the charge time is increased :( but yeah its super inconsistent
---
I watch a lot of Tru3 and maybe I'm seeing it wrong, but I have always interpreted it as don't give them attention *because* it works in his favor. He always says "don't follow the clicky click, because they'll follow you", and he's right.
---
But if you caught up to them after the first time you hit them in frenzy why wouldn't you just down them like normal. It just seems like a waste of time to play like a normal legion up until the point that you could just chase them and hit them again to down them, mainly just because if you don't take Frank's mix tape or deep stab wounds for add-ons the bleed timer is gonna be a decent wait, but if you use mix tape and hit them twice then you have to wait longer for bloodlust since it resets the timer after each hit. Sure it's a guaranteed down at that point, but I really don't think it'd be any faster than if you just played legion with a typical build instead. All the waiting for things to happen instead of just going for the down to begin with seems weird to me, plus what do the other 3 survivors do while you're going for deep wound downs? If it takes 15 seconds for a bloodlust stack, about 15 seconds for deep wound to actually down, plus the time it takes to initially hit them the first time, to pick them up and hook them, that's around like a minute for one down. If the other three aren't potatoes then they'd be smart and do gens while it's happening so they'd manage to get to like 80% on 3 different gens in that time, assuming they took no perk to speed it up, no toolbox, are working on the gen solo, and don't hit any great skill checks. People still might take BoP to help finish off people that can loop very well, but I really don't think it'd be worth it compared to a normal build since it takes so much time to get it to work in the first place
---
You can always tell when something new is OP when that side is doing a ton of preventative work on the forums.
---
Bloodlust is easy to keep if you don’t care about the M1. Try it. Just take the “wrong way” around loops and if you get to a pallet that will break chase, use your power to jump over it and then come out of it immediately. 
---
It’s not about speed to down, it is about ease and no counters.
---
Game awards are fake. Doesn't really matter.
---
To be fair, none of the new killers recently did something that haven't been beaten to death in this game already. Most of the killers have charge and/or teleport already. It's just about who does it the best...
---
What I like is the atmosphere tho. The sounds are spot on, the killer itself is cool to look at. Idk about gameplay tho I never bought it.
---
HONESTLY, THEY SHOULD HAVE JUST INCREASED FATIGUE A LITTLE AND TONED DOWN HER LUNGE
---
I asked this in the AMA and didn't get a single reply.
---
Don't feed the Oni lol. He is the purest M1 killer in the game unless you give him 2 M1 hits on healthy, or let him chase injured survivor for eternity. He is extremely big and looping him is easy. By the time he gets his power, good survivors should've done at least 2-3 gens. 
---
He is OP only against noobs, his power is still loopable and slugging is counterable.
---
What even is a toxic survivor?
---
Have these people ever played competitive video games before? They would not have been able to hang back in the day lmao. Old school CS 1.6 days we used to just shit talk each other in IRC and shit  *all the time*, but it was understood that it was all just banter. It's not toxic, it's fun...if you're not a little bitch I suppose lol.
---
This is why you never buy killers until a month or so after they're release.
---
BuLgE???
---
The downside is he has to pick up every bullet individually scattered around the ground.
---
Coaxed Clapper and a common that makes you loose TR after leaving invis makes this ez pz.
---
Oni is Spirit’s great great great great etc. grandpa
---
That shake he does after he get the kill, made me laugh much louder than I would have liked😂
---
I DISAGREE, I THINK OMEGABLINK WAS THE ONLY ISSUE WITH NURSE. NURSE REQUIRES LOTS OF MECHANICAL SKILL AND GSME KNOWLEDGE FOR WHAT SHE COULD DO
---
...you can.
---
am I being wooshed?
---
Happy Cake Day.
---
Oh shit my bad
---
Ew. Two spirits
---
Heal yourself while you are about to get downed and you will be able to immediately move after getting downed

IT’S SO WEIRD TO SEE NOED ON A KILLER THAT DOESN’T GET TO ENDGAME. LIKE, BUDDY, YOU DON’T EVEN NEED NOED! USE SOMETHING ELSE THAT COULD HELP YOU GET A 4K, SINCE CLEARLY YOU’RE GOOD WITH ONLY 3 PERKS
---
I started watching him for DBD but he's become more whiney recently and complaining about keys, med-kits and other items when he loses as killer. I love his "build" which usually consists of the generic top tier perks - ruin, nurses calling, BBQ, and one obscure perk to look original.
---
To be fair toxic survivors fuck up everything, it's not just Demogorgon. I totally had my traps skullfucked by a flashlight as a Hag, that's just survivors. I understand teabagging is annoying, but you can't be mad someone destroys your portal.
---
Super cool
---
Honestly I'd rather take the dc penalty too if I see 3 people in my team with no mither.
---
If you run bbq and hook everyone you still end up with like 40-50k BP and you don't pip
---
I don't see the benefit in pipping anymore since you just play optimal red rank SWF blah blah whatever... /rant
---
It's time to stop using any shred of this survivor rulebook and eat / stab / chainsaw / finger... surprise / chop chop some survivors, then take out my camera and photo them
---
AW WELL YOU KNOW SCHOOL IS VERY IMPORTANT AND ITS GOOD TO HAVE A HEALTHY BALANCE. GOOD LUCK IN YOUR STUDIES AND I HOPE YOU GET A CHANCE SOON TO COME BACK TO THE FOG AND ENJOY A WELL DESERVED BREAK OF MURDER AND MAYHEM
---
Pretty sure he would have passed down his rage to the father of that were the case instead of Rin
---
Even Otz doesn't try as hard as Tru3
---
As far as I know, the only ones who are straight up evil would be Michael, Freddy, Danny, Kenneth, Frank, and Amanda. You could argue Anna and Demogorgon, but they are closer to feral animals if anything and aren't exactly "evil" in the traditional sense. Everyone else was either forced to do it, tricked, broken, or driven insane to kill. Even Herman who can be seen as evil now, I believe was tortured into killing initially.
---
That's the biggest threat they will ever received.
---
Rancor should be changed to one Mori per match. Simple as that. My personal opinion
---
Now who am I, to ignore a smile like that
---
yeah i don't know the numbers for all killers so im sure there's even worse than this but i know plague's purple duration addon says considerably but its only a 13% increase in duration... kind of a joke lol
---
So what you are saying is that if you are getting chased (let's say first chase) you have to get ur internet back online and join back within one minute before you die
---
I swear I have the worst luck and they somehow get the ruin first before they get a trap totem
---
This survivor is so raw I taste the hook
---
But i can be mad about a "tbagging claudette" yeah?
---
Paper bell?
---
Ah yes, men of culture
---
If it becomes a problem, that's most likely going to be how they nerf it.
---
yea and being tunneled is not at all same like: "LOL YOU LOSE" screen halfway through a game
---
I feel like Ashe's and Ghost would be a better chase music, and the dbd theme in the style of betrayal (maybe they can bring in the og Yamaoka) would be better for the menu theme.
---
Stop giving r/didgonewild ideas!
---
Well the devs say that none of the killers have met each other since they’re either in a trial or in a null zone of the entity where they’re kept until the next trial. So they probably don’t know of each other’s existence
---
You leave blood orbs everywhere and it seems as if they take alot of time to disappear, which makes it easier for him to find you which is unfair. So, to fix it you shouldn't leave blood orbs when you aren't in a chase....can you read?
---
this haircut fits him too well
---
We all know where Stranger Things got their inspiration from
---
Works out to needing to play more than 11 matches a day. Considering the queue times and the fact you’ll have DC’s on loading because of the offering I say good luck with that.
---
hey man if he does props ig that is where I am leaving it
---
you lose bloodlust with your power
---
The Claudette at the end! This is so fucking cute!
---
Hag, you can literally grab anyone off of anything, you can even grab survivors as they're trying to unhook.
---
EVERYONE, RUN! LEGION IS DOING THE A POSE! HE IS FUCKING DOMINANT! AAAAHHHHHH!!!!
---
Finally getting new killers in Bloodharvest?
---
Especially if you use the shackles.
---
Also, it's never an issue with his own skill. It's always the gen speed's fault, always. He can never admit when he's actually outmatched. Sure, he can make little 'nice play's, but he doesn't actually mean it when he attributes a team's victory to gen speeds.
---
That's subjective. For me demo doggy super fun.
---
He did, he had a son named Akito. Some of his rare addons mention him.
---
Rins dad is a great dad the entity just said fuck you to Rin’s dad
---
Freddy's got anime pupils
---
Throw your bottles in strategic places, and 'reload' when a survivors is/is trying to loop you, a survivor wont leave a loop very quickly
---
Wait does that mean it’s cannon that the oni got laid
---
and that aint a problem C:
---
dropping pallets early is hardly counter play. and just because something has slight counter play definitely doesn’t make it not op, especially if that counter play hurts you. you could argue 5 blinks nurse had counterplay, just don’t get spotted and break line of sight. spirit has plenty of counterplay too, her shards light up. old ds had counterplay, just dribble. Mettle of man? Just don’t hit survivors. You can talk about “counterplay” all day, but that doesn’t make it valid. Just not stunning the killer isn’t valid counterplay, especially against a legion. also, I’m not ignoring beast of prey lol? it’s just not what this thread was about.
---
I don't get why it's a thing.  Just break dangerous pallets (killer shack, cow tree, etc.) and the perk is a non-issue.  Or be Spirit or Nurse and make it a non-issue.
---
I actually like the language. It helps new players make quick gut decisions and educated guesses when they don't yet have a reference point for numbers
---
needs more optimal
---
..... yo that's pretty dark
---
I thought of a perk idea called lucky find : when you start doing a gen or sabotaging a hook you gain worn out tools with 10/15/20 charges. "I don't want to know why these are here but hey, I got lucky."
---
Yeah for the most part i dont tunnel or camp. Cause i hate when it happens to me when im playing survivor. Although if the survivors are sfw or toxic then ill make a expection.
---
don’t worry, some day you’ll be good enough to realize wasting pallets isn’t a valid counter and spirit isn’t the highest skill gap killer.
---
Then people just DC as soon as they see Franklin's :(
---
Ghostface is a full serial killer, Pig is a sadist, Myers is pure evil, Freddy is evil. Trapper can be seen as evil for trapping everyone in the mine, Leatherface is just honestly being told what to do and doesn't question it, Oni is just a pissed off badass.
---
I love when cosplayers set up character shots like this; so fun!! Great cosplays!!
---
Yea same here but rather in my case I'd rather not give a killer the pleasure of killing me when they tunneled, camped or slugged all game. If they camp me I'll stay on hook so my team can gen rush, but as soon as I get unhooked and they try to down me again I'll DC just to be deny them the only kill they would've gotten cause they chose to play poorly. Same for tunnelers, they wanna tunnel me just cause they found me first or I got their ruin then they won't get the kill, I'll try to loop them as long as possible but once I'm downed on my last hook I'm out. As for sluggers if they slug more than two ppl going for a 4k and not even attempting to hook then I'mma just leave. I don't tolerate unfun games and I'll be damned if I stay in one. I don't play the game to sit on a hook or lay on the ground. I play to enjoy it and if anyone has a problem with me dcing cause the killer would sooner refuse me my fun then they should not even reply to this comment.
---
How does one identify what Hex is what?
---
Oni is acually her ancestor during the samurai era in japan(not its real name) i was hoping that her father would be the survivor but instead we got the unoriginal cyberpunk chick.
---
I see, I didn't know that because I play on console so haven't had chance to use him just yet
---
I love David just poking his head into the last panel.

What effect? There‘s mend time, power recovery speed, and time in feral frenzy.

Sometimes it's not a good game though. I don't like being tunneled after being farmed.

You can pull survivor off a totem too
---
People have had days to play as and against him. It has been proven that without add-ons, he can counter a lot of loops, and WITH add-ons? He can fucking hit you on standard pallet loops, with sharp corners. At the least, the charge time add-ons need a nerf, at most, demon striking out of dash shouldn't be a one shot. This would keep all the fun and skill, and give survivors something to actually do against him. As it is, most good killers who have played Oni agree the best counter is literally jumping into a fucking locker, as it breaks his power. That's fucking dumb.
---
Always smile.
---
Probably
---
I think that’s actually a really good amount of blood
---
&gt;makes it easier for him to find you which is unfair.
---
which is the point of that.....its not unfair, its Part of the ability
---
could be a fun build to try
---
My boyfriend mentions this all the time lol he’s like I had no problem with old DS, just it’s obsession perk, they can’t all be my obsession the first time I touch them. Lol
---
It has been added
---
Yeah the Oni is Spirits ancestor
---
Haha yep that’s how it started for me too! We’re all stuck in the entity’s grasp now
---
Hope you got your iron panties ready
---
It's 10am est
---
Queue's are slow until later
---
They use wording so they dont show you numbers, so you dont know how minuscule the effect actually is.
---
The DCs have gotten especislly bad lately. In the last 3-4 days of playing I think I can count the number of matches where no players either a) intentionally blew their escape attempts and/or didn't struggle, or b) outright disconnected, on a single hand.
---
If it’s not licensed then yes
---
Basically
---
He is a jack of all trades sure, but you need to know what to focus on with him, I personally play him a lot and never really have bad games where I feel like he is underpowered. The key is to not focus that much on his portal network early, don´t waste time, just put a few portals on gens where you spawn and ones you pass and go look for survivors. You don´t need to activate them as they would just be destroyed and you lose time that way. Run BBQ so you can hook someone and then instantly portal across the map back to the portals you set up early and play like this to keep pressure up on the entire map. If a portal gets destroyed no matter, just make new ones along the way and keep portalling agressively, place them near hooks after hooking, place them near gens, survivors will not keep up with the new portals you make and if they try to, it is jut extra time spent not doing gens. And channel your power often, sometimes you can spot people trying to get your portal and instantly teleport there to pressure them or you will spot someone going to unhook and you can be right there to punish the unhooker.
---
Shred is another thing that I talked more about [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dzfo12/i_just_wanna_enjoy_my_thick_samurai_boy/f885vvu/) if you learn how to use it you can completely shut down many loops, pallets or mindgame survivors.
---
He needs early pressure, I personally run Ruin and Haunted Grounds and HG often easily gets me early downs that allow me to snowball the game. BBQ is a must and I cannot play him without STBFL, with max stacks he sticks to the chase like crazy and basic hit at max stacks+Shred is really great. Especially when you can save stacks by shredding your obsession.
---
He is a really good killer, and quite underrated, but his kit is not very simple to pubstomp with like Spirit for example.
---
I mean like, even the comments seem to be exactly the same.
---
Well...yeah. Unless he's a sponge and reproduces asexually, that's kind of required.
---
I hate adrenaline because my team usually sucks, so the perk will never activate. I know that it's super good, but i hate inconsistent perks like that. Same with borrowed time, i don't like bringing a perk that i will only get use out of once every 4 or 5 games. I don't like decisive because it only lasts 60 seconds, and is very easy for the killer to ignore. (I play killer just as much, and i haven't been hit by DS since the rework, because i never tunnel, and if someone runs at me off the hook, or sprints into a locker, they obviously have it.) Dead hard is a really good perk, because even if the killer just waits for it, the dash can still get you to a pallet or window, but alot of people don't wait for it, so it will work normally, but with the dedicated servers, it does fail sometimes. I usually run dead hard, prove thyself, and we'll make it. Because we'll make it is like a 8 to 10 second heal, and always works, and it can heal everyone, so it lasts long enough to be useful later, as well. Prove thyself gives extra bloodpoints, and it's a noticeable impact on the speed of the gen. Recently I've been using spinechill, just because of how many micheals and ghostfaces have been going around, but it is a bit of a crutch perk, and you can still play well without it, it just is a really strong counter to a few certain killers.

Basically, i like more consistent perks, that i control when and how they work, and perks that speed up game objectives.

#New Location: Skynet Research Facility
---
##The Terminator
---
###Primary weapon: Fists
---
*Music: [Chase](https://youtu.be/AOS1pMQVrCQ)*
---
###Power: Handgun
---
The Terminator starts trials with a Handgun equipped with a laser sight. He can carry up to **14 rounds** at a time (7 per clip), and can find small amounts of ammo scattered throughout the map. **Holding down the Power button** draws the Handgun, allowing The Terminator to aim using the laser sight, and fire by **tapping the Attack button**. The Terminator **cannot move** while using the Handgun. Additionally, the Handgun's fire-rate is limited to one shot every **.20 seconds**, and has a **maximum range of 18 meters**. While not using the Handgun, the attack button activates a basic punch.
---
###Power: I'll be Back
---
The Terminator earns a **token** each time a Survivor is rescued from a hook. After earning three tokens, he unlocks the Cyborg Assault ability. **Holding down the Power button** pulls out an M16 (auto-rifle) and a SPAS-12 (shotgun). These weapons are limited to a total of **30 rounds** and **8 shells**, respectively.
---
The M16:
---
- Fires at **750 RPM**.
---
- Becomes less accurate during sustained fire.
---
- Has a maximum range of **24 meters**.
---
- Applies the Deep Wound status effect the first time a Survivor is shot. Each follow-up shot reduces the Survivor's bleed-out timer by **25%**. 
---
The SPAS-12:
---
- Can be fired every **.30 seconds**.
---
- Has a maximum range of **12 meters**.
---
- Puts Survivors into the Injured state when they're over **6 meters** away.
---
- Puts Survivors into the Dying state when they're under **6 meters** away.
---
Additionally, while Cyborg Assault is active, The Terminator's vision is tinted red (with a bunch of numbers and data appearing on the screen), and he can see the auras of Survivors while their scratch marks or blood trails are visible. Cyborg Assault ends after **15 seconds**, and the tokens **reset**. Unlike the Handgun, The Terminator can **move** while Cyborg Assault is active.
---
**Nice Night for a Walk**
---
- Who doesn't enjoy a peaceful stroll on a calm night? Your Terror Radius is increased by **2 meters** every **6/5/4 seconds** while chasing a Survivor, stacking to a maximum of **12 meters**. After your Terror Radius reaches its maximum, you can break through a pallet by simply walking into it. This effect resets after walking through a pallet, or when the chase ends.
---
**Targeted for Termination**
---
- The Entity has identified a key target. You have become obsessed with one Survivor. Each time you land a hit on your obsession, your movement speed is increased by **1/2/3%**, stackable up to **6%**. If your obsession dies, you become obsessed with a new Survivor.
---
**Substance Scanner**
---
- Your extensive knowledge of human behavior allows you to analyze the trails of your prey with extreme precision. Scratch marks are color-coded, allowing you to differentiate between Survivor trails.
---
##Sarah Connor
---
*Music: [Lobby](https://youtu.be/pVZ2NShfCE8)*
---
**Hard Target**
---
- You've spent countless years eluding danger, and have become proficient at covering your tracks. When not running, leave no scratch marks.
---
**Desperate Struggle**
---
- After a long and taxing journey, you refuse to accept defeat. While being carried by the Killer, you can partially control their movement, making it harder for them to navigate (tier upgrades increase the amount of movememt control).
---
**It's Not Over Yet**
---
- Your will is unbreakable. If you are one of only two remaining **Survivors**, trigger a **Hard/Normal/Easy** skill check while in the **Struggle** phase of being sacrificed, giving you one last chance to escape.
---
##Kyle Reese
---
**Come with Me if You Want to Live**
---
- You invoke courage and hope in those around you. You move **2%** faster than normal, and receive an additional **1%** speed bonus for each Survivor within **16/18/20 meters**. This effect also applies to Survivors within the active radius. Survivors can only be affected by one instance of **Come with Me if You Want to Live** at a time.
---
**Sawed-off Shotgun**
---
- You have managed to conceal a deadly weapon. Start the trial with a Sawed-off Shotgun loaded with **4/5/6 shells**. Aim the weapon by **holding down the Actions button**, and fire it by **tapping the (new) Defense button** (Square, on PS4). You are unable to move while the Sawed-off Shotgun is drawn. It can be fired every **.70 seconds** (after each pump), and has a maximum range of **12 meters**. Landing a shot on a Killer closer than **4 meters** knocks them off their feet for **3 seconds** (The Nurse just gets a prolonged stun), landing a shot on a Killer between **4 and 8 meters** stuns them for **1 second**, and landing a shot on a Killer between **8 and 12 meters** stuns them for **.50 seconds**. Shooting a Killer carrying a Survivor frees the Survivor, but puts them back into the Dying state. Once the Sawed-off Shotgun is empty, it is discarded. *The mechanics are identical to Resident Evil 4.*
---
**Pipe Bomb**
---
- You've spent months studying fortification and defense strategies. Plant a proximity-based explosive charge, capable of stunning the Killer for **5 seconds**. Upon detonation, the Killer's aura is revealed to all Survivors for **3 seconds**. After using the Pipe Bomb, it becomes unavailable for **180/150/120 seconds**. If you've placed a Pipe Bomb, and it hasn't been triggered, you can pick it back up. Only one Pipe Bomb can be active at a time.
---
So what you're telling me is I'm the only european asshole playing this game? Because I refuse to believe that, good sir.
---
Thanks for highlighting Yamaoka's wrath, I nearly miss that detail
---
What do u mean when you say killer interaction?
---
I watch him on twitch and he has a lot of very constructive things to say and he does try to teach new players and explains what he does. He doesn't whine or cry, simply discusses the balance of the game. Lmao at him needing to take a break, sorry he isn't just an echo chamber repeating the same opinions everyone else has
---
you're misunderstanding
---
"Is Nurse Worth Buying It?"??? she is free? but she is literally still the strongest killer in the game and I would say if u are new don't learn her until u are used to normal killers and then no again bc she is boring strong
---
All popular youtubers, including Monto and Otz tunnel or camp sometimes, not hard core, but they do.
---
For now im using dbd Wiki but still devs change this
---
I mean, no.
---
But like taking 30 minutes to find a queue can help you guess how many people are on at ~4pm (idk which country you're in)
---
Wtf I dreamed of seeing this meme a long time ago. With the mask and everything. 
---
Deja Vu?
---
To be fair, she also severed her toe for one of them.
---
Ds literally saves you from that scenario. Then the guy who saved you can get killed. So you can do gens and leave.
---
I’ve been playing both sides on the PTB for the past few days. In the 2 years I’ve been playing on the ptb, he’s probably the strongest killer that’s made it there.  He quite literally has no counterplay once he gets his power. 
---
I get that people don’t want to rush to judgement about something they may not understand, but from a high rank mechanical and gameplay perspective, he’s pretty damn strong.  His power (once he has it) is stronger than Hillbilly’s, and it’s easier to attain than Myer’s evil within. Coupled with the fact that he’s a 115 movespeed killer, and that he essentially has no counterplay, I’m going to lean toward thinking that’s he slightly OP.
---
Wouldn't you get annoyed too after seeing the dev team ignore the same issues for so long, he's played the game for a couple years now so it's probably just wearing him down. That's not to say that he should be complaining on stream though.
---
I'm confused op. What are you trying to say?
---
why does he just look adorable in this picture and not scary, look at those eyes
---
That's what the OP was implying, not that you're dead body drops on the ground and gets back up later. Just so that losing connection isn't punished as badly as a DC. With dedicated servers, people get randomly kicked for having slightly worse internet, and it happens all the time now.
---
If they’re on comms
---
The best players in the game have been playing as and against the new killers for two full days, testing things out in kyf, and in normal matches. Almost everyone agrees his add-ons need nerfing, especially the charge time ones. I see most matches where Zubat and Scott play as Oni, they get 2-3 downs per power use. They can straight out end the match with a single power use. Do you honestly think that's balanced? And btw, not a single killer in the past FOUR chapters has been nerfed out of the PTB. In fact, Spirit, Ghostface, and Demo were all buffed either after or during PTB.
---
Count it for all the undeserved hits survivors get at windowd right now.
---
I quit after 30 mins of being in rank 18 killer queue Friday night 7 pm. You can't get a match as killer that low of rank even on the busy nights.
---
Nice to meet you again
---
Roses are red
---
Green is the Earth
---
Spirit is OP BHVR plz nerf
---
Cool so you ruin the experience of one gamer to counter an arguably uncounterable item. There’s no such remedy for survivors against a Mori. This community is full of people on power trips.
---
I think it's the power cooldown add-ons (which reduce the time you spend staring at your hands after frenzy). They're notoriously worthless due to how small they change the cooldown.
---
We've never seen killers communicate with each other in any way. I guess "Teachables" are taught somehow.
---
Wow look at all those detail I love this
---
Ah yes, Claudette leatherface
---
Holy shit that's a lot of info, thanks.
---
I saw on a vid that killers can't destroy a pallet (even bubba,Billy and oni) while you are doing the "thing" with by any means, and I if you are on a good pallet you will have time to put it up.... or the killer is nurse
---
"Welcome to upvotes, bitch!"
---
Movie references aside, great job and thank you for basing it off Robert Englund.
---
I wish devotion actually meant something tbh. It's just another number that sits there. Sucks.
---
You know that stunning a killer is a huge part of getting chased. If you never stun the killer you won't get away in 90% of the chases and will just throw every pallet on the map.
---
There is a huge difference between the killer not needing to destroy every third pallet and the killer having the chance to instadown someone for a minute. How can you even compare these? Wtf?
---
Well if i remember correctly the entity screws with the killers mind. With the spirit, the entity makes her see every survivor as her father (lore wise) and i think the oni sees the survivors as that lord who called him oni, which might be why he rips out tge tongue in the mori.
---
I think he should take a break from DbD and try something different.
---
&gt; He doesn't whine or cry
---
See, saying shit like this is why it's impossible to talk to tru3 fans. This is just utter delusion. There isn't a single streamer who whines and cries like he does except JenDenise, who stopped playing
---
This is the relationship i imagine run and kazan would have honestly
---
I haven't gotten alot of comments somehow, in my 1300 hours, it's really weird. I did get called a stream sniper once for using plauges black incense, which lets you see where survivors are when they vomit, which is literally all the time. It even works when they are on the ground or hook, which is insane, and really strong.
---
He's proud of her because of her Yamaoka bloodline; he sees her as inherently superior because of it, especially since he's invested so much in upholding it
---
He probably is as angry as her that she was brutally murdered by her own father because he would see that as a violation against upholding the Yamaoka line.
---
In that sense he's probably very proud of her warrior-like wrath, her willingness to stand up for herself in the afterlife and her ability to basically teach herself how to use the heirloom wakizashi
---
it happens when there is not enough space for the survivor to be dropped. for example if you are in a narrow or confined space, the animation of you dropping the survivor BESIDE you can not be generated. sometimes it doesn't even have to be a confined space, if there is a single object to your immediate left (you always carry the survivor on your left shoulder and drop them on your left side) you will not be able to drop a survivor unless you turn away from said object (could be anything from a building to a simple barrel)
---
Through the same magical sky-spider powers that affect the killers in the first place.
---
If the person using him is clueless then he's not that bad. But when anyone competent gets their hands on him, it's rip.
---
His flicks are insane, and unlike billy his charge can be used to run loops.
---
Don't want him nerfed too hard, but the flicks are busted IMO
---
I did it with Hag. Equiped Shackles + Range addon, hooked a survivor, set a trap infront.
---
There is ALWAYS some guy that runs over for the unhook even though they know its a hag
---
EZ PZ grab in the nuts for David, shouldn't have runned.
---
I like how you didn't even attempt to chase at first. Just sheer confusion.
---
Fake easy spot what the hell
---
6sth.....Shit has me weak rn.
---
If you dont even know how to dash in loop id even know why you are playing pig in the first place
---
Thanks ~~Obama~~ Dedicated servers!
---
She's still pretty damn cute here.
---
He is highlighting that blight spirit's design was a foreshadowing of the oni and how they are similar in appearance
---
I actually kinda like this idea, but it would never fly with the Survivor player base locked into the looping meta, for the same reason Deep Wound had to be nerfed. The concept of actually losing the Killer instead of running around in braindead circles seems to be beyond most players.
---
Ahh, I see now! That's awesome that the devs add the little things. Thanks fellow redditor!
---
Peanits if your the one looking like Quentin then you need to get some rest please.
---
Can confirm. I went into his stream recently and made a comment where I said I thought a nerf was okay
---
He replied with "yeah alright i'm sure you're also the type to call me names and bully me when someone doesn't agree with your opinion. go on twitter and @ me if you wanna make use of your time" 
---
Then their chat went on ahead and bullied me for simply saying I thought the specific nerf was okay and fair. For someone who preaches he's not toxic, he sure is egotistic
---
Honestly I really want to play some of Spirit on PTB but the killer wait times are just not viable when I get 2 hours tops of DBD time on the weekdays. Hoping I can actually test her out this weekend.
---
Sloppy will def be a must
---
Yup. I love when they go "-rep camping, tunnelling son of a ..., kyf, no life bla bla bla" and I'm sitting there thinking "just get in line with the rest of the 15.000 lobbies I had today"
---
physics would be nice...
---
flashlight clicking is toxic? I use it to attract attention in an attempt to get the killer in a chase with me so I can run them until a teammate heals or does a gen. I run OoO, Balanced landing, prove thyself, and D strike. Given that OoO is only activated when your outside a certain range, it's only useful if you're taking yourself out of the game, or doing a generator away from the killer. So how is it OP? Only has potential to be overpowered in a SWF
---
Tru, if you’ve read this far into the comments. Stop reading the comments.
---
given the fact that I don't think a SINGLE exit gate in the ENTIRE game has grass or something you can physically hide a bear trap in, if they step in one, they have no one to blame but their dumbass selves.
---
Yes he can pretentious, he can be dick, but his gameplay is what people like him for. He capitalizes a lot on survivors that throw him away as a stupid non stalk gf. And then guess what.....he wins.
---
I think shit like this is the product of people getting dicked by survivors/a killer who would have beaten them anyways with meta perks but burned them with a cheese strat.
---
I just had a long argument with someone who earnestly believed that it is literally impossible to black pip against a team of survivors who are all running no mither...
---
Their point was it is holding the game hostage since they have to disarm it
---
Love this idea and looking at the design makes me think that they should add Pyramid Head to this game
---
You guys do realize his youtube videos are just clips of the stream. When you put out 5-10 videos every day, you kinda run dry on proper titles. Honestly, after 3-4000 hours in dbd, you become bitter. He is handling the situation very well and stays calm a lot of the time when anyone else would flip his shit. He gets a lot of shit for some ridiculous things. When he calls stream sniper he doesn't do it because his gut tells him, he has a few very psychopathic viewers who like ruining his and the stream's experience. Also lets be honest, do you mean to tell me you don't complain while playing? Cut the guy some slack...
---
Also, if I don’t use any perks, I’m literally the same as every survivor other than the noises they make and appearances they have.
---
...How is it not "good gameplay?" What the fuck does that mean?
---
Well, you only escaped because the LF let you...
---
Yeah, using "point" and "come" emotes
---
I play on pc, and out of 100 or so matches since her rework, I've seen her 4 times. She didn't get nerfed that hard, but people just don't play her alot.
---
Was this comment made by a 5 yr old kindergarten, miss with Savage shit
---
Why run Pharmacy when you can run Ace in the Hole? You can get a much better medkit from a chest search than Pharmacy. Sure the faster search time is nice but I hate wasting a chest on a useless medkit.
---
These appeared 3 in a row, I don’t delete killer dailys so that I dont always play survivor. I still haven’t started on these dailys.
---
I know ;)
---
Blendette*
---
Have to be in a chase, doesn't count if he's cloaked.
---
“Young punks, get off my lawn.”  Proceeds to mow down everyone.
---
It's also a product of how Tru3 acts recently.
---
He used to have a lot more fun playing the game. It seems to have worn him thin.
---
Gotta love some good ol’ dark souls memes
---
Yeah, I have to agree. Just like with the Doctor, anyone who's played a decent amount knows the difference between the real Doctor and a hallucination at first glance. I really like the general idea, though; I think it just needs some work and maybe a more unique end result. Given the three-hook nature of most matches, there should be more Killers who apply special effects on hit instead of everyone getting fucking instadowns.
---
I wonder if user ShirtlessDavidKing, who has previously expressed utter contempt of trans people, has any ulterior motive in saying this. 
---
Also, as other people have said, check out dorky killer &amp; survivor cosmetics like Elf Dwight.
---
fair enough but I still think that was over the top not saying the people being dicks are in the right either idk it is a weird time but ig this is just how the DBD community can be
---
Wrong sub. This is too hot for here. You need r/dbdgonewild
---
This genuinely made my day &lt;3
---
A little bit, some, a bunch, a whole lot.
---
I played the closed beta last month for Project Resistance. It is unfortunately not that fun.. I escaped 50% of the time but didn't really feel compelled to keep playing. The teammwork aspect isn't there as much as DbD. It felt pretty lack luster. It could have been since everyone was just figuring things out but it wasn't as clear and fun as I had hoped for. 
---
I haven't tried Identify 5! I am going to look that up if its similar to DbD. Thank you for the suggestion.
---
What stands best represent each killer in your opinion
---
;)
---
Wrong they are pure! And in love! 
---
I dont even know what a tiddy is /s
---
Pride greed ruin and pop = gens never get done. Ever. I'm a killer main so I'm down but survs might have an issue with that lmao
---
I’m fucking with you
---
Play freddy
---
Not a console war, I’m just surprised how many people face amp on console, I own and play on ps4.
---
The problem is: there are no method of communication in this game. We just have two emote that are as much useless as slow. Of course everything rely on the teabagging.The entity should eat some call center guy and give everyone voice chat in game.
---
i doubt they will ever make a bloodpoint bonus skill for post game bp, simply because it would cut the grind down for killers which in turn would mean less time played to achieve goals.  Cool concepts otherwise though, I really hope a silent hill chapter like this becomes reality eventually!
---
See, you prove my point its bad gameplay, but it gets you the win. Thats the point all you see is the win not gameplay. You didnt care about other aspects of the game just the winning part and thats what Tru3 also only cares about. While he talks power levels all the time. Other streamers talks about all the things you could do with the game and have fun with it.  
---
I get it you're still trying to learn the game and get wins. Eventually you'll reach rank 1 and then realize "Wait a minute it wasnt really that hard. What else is there to do now?" you'll look around on what else you can do with the game and then realize that winning wasnt the point from the very start
---
I totally forgot about the demogorgon, he is like the adam of the killers
---
I'm not saying either side is right or wrong. I'm saying that people will jump to conclusions after playing a couple of rounds and then come here to complain and ask for changes without any actual data besides their own experience. Same thing goes for both rounds. People in the this community like to bitch and whine. That's what I'm complaining about.
---
This exact thing happens everytime something new comes to the game. The changes to nurse where people already expected the doomsday for the game since they expected her to get nerfed to the level of leatherface. That was before the changes even were in the ptb.
---
To the oni or the survivor I can't say much since I haven't played either one of them. I've watched some videos. He seems strong but as I said, in the beginning they always look stronger than they are.
---
Also, console war is related to Xbox VS PS4 so that doesn’t make any sense
---
Content homie
---
Murphy's law.
---
i lost respect for him when i noticed the hypocrisy 
---
he whine constantly about toxic survivor behavior
---
but then he slugs to prevent the hatch from opening which is toxic killer behavior 
---
you cant complain about toxicity while also contributing to it
---
Does this have to do with the MLP jar
---
Marth is pretty bad.
---
He calls survivors cowards for running DS, when he's literally going for 60+ games in a row with 0 escapes and heavily tunneling.
---
Also, he has an extremely high opinion of himself and is frequently vocal about it (i.e "this is a good strat against most rank 1 killers, but they're dealing with me")
---
Also similar to Tru3 in that he probably averages a 3.5k but consistently complains about anything survivors use
---
100% everyone always jumps to conclusions about dbd updates. And neither side is exempt from this it's always gonna have 1 side complaining. Your right and I hope someday we can fix this community even though it's unlikely
---
Whenever I'm the last one I always chance standing out in the open and waving the killer over, or spinning in circles 😂 sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't.
---
IT DEPENDS ON RANK. AT LOW RANKS (OR HIGH RANKS, WHATEVER YOU CALL RANK 20) SURVIVORS GET PRETTY MUCH SHIT ON. AT HIGH RANKS (RANK 1) A GROUP OF SURVIVORS CAN USUALLY ALL ESCAPE WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT. A PRIME EXAMPLE IS THE THIRD GROUP OF TWITCH RIVALS WHERE YOU CAN SEE A GROUP OF SURVIVORS PLAYING SOMEWHAT MEMEY AND STILL OFTEN BEING IN A POSITION FOR AN EASY 3 ESCAPE AT MINIMUM.
---
You don't have to become bitter.
---
We will....no tier lists
---
Haha I could do this myself tbh. 
---
I've been saying this phrase since Haunted Grounds launched 😂 So I might post a design up tomorrow or Sunday. I like the idea of it being a shirt lmao
---
I cant tell if people in this sub genuinely dont like tru3 or if they are being sarcastic
---
UGH I GOT IT ON MY FIRST TRY (BUT IT WAS, LIKE, 7 OR 8 TRAPS) AND ALSO A 4K, BUT THEN THE GAME CRASHED ON THE INITIAL POST-GAME SCREEN SO IT ENDED UP NOT COUNTING. THEN MY NEXT TWO GAMES WERE ON AWFUL MAPS WHERE I ONLY GOT 3 TRAPS TOTAL. I GOT IT ON MY 4TH ATTEMPT AFTER KILLING TWO SURVIVORS AND GETTING THE REMAINING TWO TO REALIZE I WASN'T GONNA KILL THEM SO I COULD COAX ONE OF THEM INTO A TRAP TO COMPLETE IT
---
THIS REALLY DEPENDS ON WHY YOU LIKE TO PLAY THE GAME. AS A KILLER MAIN I LIKE TO PLAY THE GAME FOR POINTS AND FOR THE THRILL OF THE CHASE. IF YOU GEN RUSH AS A SURVIVOR YOU'RE GOING TO GET MAYBE 10,000 POINTS IN THE GAME, AND THE GAME WILL BE BORING AF. INTERACTING WITH THE KILLER, TAKING RISKS IS HOW THE MOST BLOODPOINTS ARE EARNED. ALSO YOU CAN GAIN SURVIVOR RANK EVEN IF YOU DIE, BUT YOU CAN'T GAIN KILLER RANK IF YOU DON'T SACRIFICE.
---
I HAD THIS HAPPEN THE OTHER DAY. I WAS RUNNING THE KILLER AROUND FOREVER, JUST KEEPING HIM CONSTANTLY ON MY TAIL SO MY TEAMMATES COULD GET SOME WORK DONE. THEY DIDN'T END UP GETTING ANY GENS FINISHED. ONLY TWO GENS GOT REPAIRED AND THEY WERE BY ME.
---
AFTER I EVENTUALLY GOT KILLED, I DECIDED TO SPECTATE SO I COULD GET A BETTER LOOK AT WHAT THE OTHER SURVIVORS WERE ACTUALLY DOING. ONE OF THEM KEPT RUNNING TO FINISHED GENS AND SEEMED CONFUSED BY THE FACT THAT THEY COULDN'T REPAIR THEM.
---
I DON'T RECALL WHAT RANK THEY WERE AT, BUT I JUST RECENTLY STARTED SO I'M RANK 18, SO I GUESS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY JUST DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE GAME YET, BUT IT'S STILL FRUSTRATING TO BE AN EXCELLENT RUNNER AND HAVE IT ALL BE FOR NOTHING.
---
This is a close second for common accusations by people who don’t know what holding the game hostage is, maybe it needs to be more clear in the report screen.
---
Is there a specific rule against tier lists? I read the rules and it said nothing about that.
---
This was on console
---
You already made a post about it though
---
the hatch mechanic is killer sided
---
killers move faster than survivors do, and dont need to worry about being spotted and killed so they have the advantage in finding the hatch before the survivor 
---
so slugging to avoid the hatch is toxic killer behavior and there is something wrong with it
---
With all those survivors running around sidewise or backwards... Yes, yes it is.
---
Yep considered oversaturated content.
---
Fuck
---
I did after I made this comment
---
You are correct mate.
---
I'm sure you, after comparing LGBT content to the most flamboyantly oversexualized thing you can think of, have only our best interests in mind. 
---
Anybody who'd tunnel over a charm would do it over a name, and LGBT people are, uh, aware of the existence of homophobia and harrassment such.
---
I like that answer. My favorite so far lol
---
Spirit is OP
---
Cried many
---
We heard your pleas, so we nerf piggy
---
please
---
"bUt UnDeTeCtAbLe nErFs OoO!!11!"
---
There are two perks in this game that are so unfair I would never willingly play a match with someone running them: OoO and NOED. It's easy to immediately DC if some piece of shit is running OoO, but unfortunately Survivors have no way of avoiding the pieces of shit who run NOED.
---
That's honestly the main reason I play Killer almost exclusively these days. Survivor just isn't fun with NOED in the game.
---
Is this meme shitting on him?
---
What about the Otz meme about him using STBFL. Do you think that was meant to "shit on him", or just poke fun?
---
You're probably using him correctly. Leatherface is generally considered one of the weakest Killers, so a much harder time than playing a strong Killer should be expected.
---
This is DBD, since when is anything fair?
---
Just give it, say, 5 shots, infinite range, and make the Killer occasionally reload from lockers, and... oh, wait.
---
Thanks for the explanation. Truly this game is polished, it immediately recognized my P3 Doctor as a sign of lack of skill. AIs will soon rule over us. /s
---
Pretty sweet...and thanks for drawing the REAL freddy (new skin WHEN mscrote?!)
---
I'm willing to bet he doesn't even know what you're talking about. The moment he said 'another toxic otz fan' stripped him of any/all credibility.
---
You pulled the “you must be low rank” card when I’m in rank 2 and I see his gameplay as good, slugging isn’t toxic as I saw in the paragraph before that has active and effective counters to it. He has a different play style of gf nobody really does and he gets 4K’s 32 stack bp because of it. I tried out his build had a hell of a time with it and it’s what I use from now on. Yes he might be one salty son of a bitch, but his gameplay *i feel like this is getting repetitive now* is very good. Yes he has is speed bumps but I would be him if I got shamed on stream by some stream snipers that try to humiliate me in front of thousands of people.
---
It’s written, though.
---
Yeah, as much as people love to complain about it, sometimes that's the right way to play. If it's a swf and one of them is running OoO, you gotta tunnel them or you won't get any kills. If I run after an unhook and the dude that was hooked is running in the open while the unhooker runs to killer shack, I'm going after the guy that was on the hook. Ain't gonna waste my time and risk losing the game just because the enemy team has their own made up rules for me.
---
And I also added another perk idea
---
&gt; the hatch mechanic is killer sided
---
It's luck sided. 
---
&gt; so slugging to avoid the hatch is toxic killer behavior and there is something wrong with it
---
it's literally the only way to reliably get the 4th person because, again, it is all luck
---
"trying ti win the game is TOXIC!"
---
-imbeciles
---
&gt; killers move faster than survivors do, and dont need to worry about being spotted and killed so they have the advantage in finding the hatch before the survivor 
---
has nothing to do with whether or not the survivor happens to just be by it. Because **fucking again** it is all about luck
---
Why people think it's the servers fault? It was clearly that had a lag spike
---
Everyone in the Autoheaven gas center
---
Let me guess, you complain about oni being op?
---
There is no penalty BHVR could introduce that would stop me from DCing from that match.
---
Honestly, sometimes I feel forced to play more campy, which I hate because I know how much people in the community dislike that play style.
---
Maybe it’s just me, I just need to learn the game even more.
---
Increase your luck by 100% wouow. It's actually 8% now. that's why small numbers are not a pealing for the mases
---
Bullshit
---
Find one comment where I said something against trans people. I’ll wait.
---
I've never watched Marth before.
---
Unless it is a bug, I did not. I may have to redownloaf the beta and try it again to see if it was just that game (I did not want to keep doing that multiple games as it is not fun to just chase and wait). 
---
Regardless, it is fairly easy to keep bloodlust on most maps just walking around if you are not trying to Force a down. Add Enduring, and you just be an M1 killer after the initial hit. Play Legion normally and they WILL go down.
---
Still bad. Need more aim practice
---
good gameplay is mostly fun or creativity in a general sense  
---
the point of the hatch mechanic was to give remaining players hope and at least have something else to do on a clearly losing state. The endgame slugging was a byproduct. Its that, eliminating that mechanic in the game, it aint fun for the rest and you know you cant lose at that state. At that point your'e not playing a game anymore its just cleanup duty, its scripted. Its part of the game but its bad. bad gameplay   
---
Its same thing for scripted linear parts of other games. You know whats gonna happen you just move through it as of a movie. most people think its bad gameplay too
---
I enjoy watching true because he’s good at the game but he’s too egotistical to enjoy as a Twitch personality imo.
---
Weird I mean I made it so if it has already been posted then I'm sorry lol. Maybe its due to the influx of baby yoda memes.
---
"It's really easy Shapeboi me bob. Next time you kick a pallet or a generator just kick it 10% harder. That'll be 4 000 bloodpoints."
---
What are the fixes to the issues he complains about though? He wants the game balanced for high ranks, but if that happened ranks 20-5 would be more killer sided than they already are. If you complain about something but don't have a solution, don't complain at all.
---
Everybody likes him, it's just he has some extremely fun traits that you just can't not to poke at
---
I mean how is this hard to obtain ... 
---
Doc: Zap em then if they try to jump the window and palett grab em (you can still grab em in shock mode most people dont know this so its a easy grab).
---
Pig: Get Monitor and Abuse + Discordance / Surveilance and just walk up and grap em
---
Wraith: Get the Bone Bell + the Brown Addon with no stain /TR after uncloaking
---
Spirit: Well do spirit stuff
---
I'm on ethernet with amazing service. If the killer had a lag spike and this was the result, I'd still blame the server, I shouldn't be lagging backwards because the killer has a shit connection.
---
Uh-oh, better remove the heterosexuality from the Nurse's &amp; Billy's backstories and anywhere else it shows up, devs. It's being shoved down this poor man's throat, and he can't stand it!
---
I know cause I saw it when I got on reddit
---
People who check Steam profiles to use your personal info against you are so hilarious. At that point he is really just grasping for straws trying to find something to insult you, just shows how much you got to him.
---
ohhh so you mean that good gameplay is trying to not win and just sort of letting the survivors out. gotcha. i had a feeling that's what you were on about
---
He is a great player, its just that he is kinda arrogant sometimes
---
I hear Civilization is good.
---
I like it but the map needs a rework. The survivors have another way out of the basement. Too OP.

Someone has not watched Samination.

His video was on the 3 year anniversary stream, so the Hookers are cannon.

When you tell a rank 19 to heal in a spot that isn’t the corner
---
yeah the thousands of hours is wrong. my new account (450 hours) has everyone maxed. It’s a matter of playing the right killer with the right perks. nurse + bbq + survivor puddings (which you get tons of when you’re leveling her up) pretty much guarantees 75k+ a game
---
This meme needs to die. Killers can REACH YOU THROUGH WINDOWS BECAUSE THEY HAVE ARMS. It's not rocket science.
---
BAM BAM
---
Whats the original comic about?
---
People, let's raise this comment to the top!
---
Something similar happened to me. Went to drop a pallet, got in the locker instead. Felt like an idiot, especially cuz the killer just stood in front of the locker shaking his head.
---
Exactly what I was thinking. It's called blackbrook asylum I think.
---
I play as both survivor and killer, and im in the camp that thinks oni is too strong. I think that in a set of perfect circumstances, you could make the argument that he’s not a problem, but in reality he’s so much easier to play than to play against. People arguing that he’s fine in his current state are basically expecting survivors to be perfect 100% of the time to avoid getting his/losing his power, while the oni player can just basically do whatever he wants. 
---
Find a single survivor and land a hit? You have your power now.
---
Don’t know where people are? Demon dash across the map. Still don’t know? Demon dash back because you move incredibly fast and the power lasts long enough to do a complete lap or two.
---
Survivor trying to loop you? Flick 180 degrees for an instadown. Miss? Who cares, your cool down is minimal and you’ll down them on attempt 2 or 3.
---
Survivor playing “correctly” and hiding in a locker to avoid the insta down? Awesome you just pick them out of it and get a free hook.
---
Not to mention after using your power just a single time, you’ll basically have guaranteed access to it for the rest of the game since the survivor team is injured. Rinse and repeat the whole process and you’ll never lose unless you couldn’t find anyone in first 3 minutes and got genrushed.
---
More importantly, as balanced as he may be at red ranks against an optimal, coordinated SWF, he’s going to be broken at lower ranks, and that’s dangerous for the games health. I’m a red rank survivor and I play with friends who range from anywhere from rank 9 to 19, and they already complain about every killer being too strong because they have trouble looping. They’re going to have a field day with this guy, and if every game ends up being oni because of his ease of use and overall power level, it’s easy to see people just giving up and taking a break from the game. Ultimately, i understand the frustration because he’s fun and awesome, but with the horrible way the game is balanced overall there’s no way to have the oni in the game in his current state without pissing off a big amount of the player base.
---
They just need one or two nerfs, and I think they absolutely need to stop stepping on the toes of other killers. Why play billy when oni exists? The “drawback” of having to charge your power is a non issue after just one use. It sets a dangerous precedent for design where they just power creep new killers into the game.
---
I just can’t help but compare this guy to legion. Legion has a power that makes him run faster, and gives him access to a crappy power that has no lethality. It lasts less long than Onis, has a 4 second cool down, gets cancelled if you miss a single attack, and gets cancelled if you get pallet stunned. None of these things apply to the Oni. Not one. How does that make sense from a balance perspective? 
---
Making Oni as bad as legion isn’t the answer, I just can’t understand how a team can make both of these killers and think they’re equally viable unless they have 0 understanding of their own game.
---
No he didn’t lmao
---
Dropping a pallet early is a counterplay and if you ignore it, then it is your fault.
---
I speak about BoP because you call a counterable  combo op, while ignoring really broken stuff
---
Eh but builds and play styles can’t really be so flexible you feel?
---
It’s gotta be hard to use a stealth build against a team that’s not playing so easily that you can use it, then you have no choice but to play normally.
---
The unbreakable thing I remember, he said he totally forgot to use it . But even then in that situation it wouldn’t have helped
---
Throw your bottles in front or where you think the survivor is going to go. The clown is really good a T and L walls if you throw the bottles right
---
He is too strong vs "new" Survivors (and you dont need the additional Blood there) and too weak vs Survivor who know how to play the game and got tons of perks (here you would need the Blood but you get less cuz you have to catch survivors with no ability + they heal up way faster). The way he obtains blood is the problem....
---
Every single killer game I dread loading in and seeing a survivor's aura across the map.
---
My first try every single Survivor was running Spine Chill. 🤣
---
Second try, I got a grab in the first 10 seconds of the match.
---
I like him but a lot of stuff needs changed, for example increasing the rate your power goes down while using demon dash, breaking a pallet with your demon slam should also use a set amount of the abilities charge (maybe a 5th or 6th of its duration) because you can bully the hell out of pallets by tapping m1 for free far faster than normal the normal spacebar kick, the turn can stay but it should be reduced to about 80 degrees from centre of your screen (to the left or right) and maybe a longer stun if you hit geometry with your m1 maybe also reduce his standard movement speed while using the ability to 110% due to the fact he can get around the downside of demon dash by just not using it in chases and instead for patrolling then being an m1 killer with an insta down m1 with greater range.
---
Other than that a majority of the time good players only get their first kill mid way through the third gen and games where its earlier than that are usually because the survivors will prioritize gens over healing and don't react to hearing the global sound effect of the ability often leading to them not being able to react to him coming at them on a gen because they stayed there after it activates.
---
Overall i wouldn't put him higher than billy on a tier list because billy has access to his instadown whenever he wants and can kit his out better thus having more lethality than oni overall.
---
&gt;Pretty much nerf him for literally no reason and then add back stupid cheese tactics, BHVR must be on one hell of a drug.
---
I never saw a description too accurate in this sub.
---
THANKS MATE I APPRECIATE IT
---
I agree with your general point but purple ranks are not really killer sided and wouldn't be affected almost at all by balancing around red ranks. It would only matter from brown to low green
---
New perk *Save the baby Dwight for last* confirmed
---
Losing the killer only works if the killer plays bad, it's almost impossible to lose it if they play well, that's why survivors go into looping mode, they have no other chance
---
A friend of mine just started getting into the game and started watching Tru3. He told me he likes watching him stomp but apparently tru3 "whines all the time", which I can't completely disagree with, but dude's got thousands of hours on the game. When he says gens go too fast, it's because he sees 5 minute games all the time despite being one of the best killer players around. 
---
He's pretty dumb when it comes to new killers, but it's tough to fault the guy for being a little burned out when a lot of these problems have persisted for years.
---
If you're not Otz you're the devil, that's what I learned in this sub.
---
Only a few were positive or random.
---
Most were results of me engaging with toxic SWFs in post game chat, and then apparently them going to my steam profile comments to get the last word. lol
---
Omg 🤣🤣🤣
---
Hey I’m baby survivor, new to the game. What’s the PTB?
---
I swear the ranks are broken When I am like rank 7 I sometimes get survivors that are rank 10 or even 15...
---
Frank is really into it apparently
---
Omg!! Just when I thought it couldn’t get any funnier.  Hahahahaha hahahahaha hahahahaha!!!!
---
Yea he was still fucked up. I wouldn't label him as a straight up murderer like the others, but I would say depending on your definition he could be worse, since he instead tortured people in sadistic ways.
---
Won't let me see his broadcasts from anywhere past 2 months ago
---
Everybody gangsta till someone start t posing
---
Even i saw this all i could think of was
---
"My sirens name is brick and she is the prettiest" from Bl2
---
Then I’m inclined to not believe you
---
This does fit with ace but I feel it would be a bit op at High ranks
---
Public Test Build.  PC players get to test out killers and new fixes before they’re released for console and PC players.
---
Nodding no like you did something amazing lmao. Console pleb
---
If you're at a loop, throw your bottle at the corner of the longest wall from the pallet. They either run the short side and leave a potential to be mindgamed or they run the long side and choke.
---
the oni is a yamaoka, the trailer said your blood belongs to the yamaoka's.
---
I'm gonna switch it with Boil Over next time. Don't judge me, ok? :((
---
The image itself is SFW... So.. smart marketing.
---
mostly you can save when he is picking people up, not when he is already carrying them.
---
Yes but as it stands, you can use up a toolbox to 1 charge, go 3/20~ hooks on the map and its fresh addons and all. Making it gens only still allows you 2 times to completely refill a 80 charge tremendous speed toolbox since you can't use the toolbox before touching the first gen.
---
Seems balanced
---
Fair enough. If I manage to figure out how to view broadcasts from June (June 11th-June18th) and pull it up i'll let you know then ;)
---
Honestly he just went on about how "illogical" survivor main i was and that i would be the type to "bully him" etc. Screams egotistic to me and seems like I wasn't the only one to experience this. He promptly told me to take it to twitter with him. He's not a bad day, great at the game. His attitude stinks tho and you can have your own opinion on that
---
Same, he doesn’t really seem to… like… ENJOY the game anymore.
---
Over in Sydney I still get Aussie players. I'm guessing you're more northern? Might just be a general location connection issue
---
Idk man ps4 nurses arent that scary
---
It is annoying seeing him given interesting builds then shitting on them because he can't make them work.
---
I feel like his audience is like 100x worse though, they act like a cult who would eat anyone alive who doesn't 100% agree with Tru3
---
WRAITH IS PRETTY WEAK!! COULD HE PERHAPS MAYBE PRETTY PLEASE NOT GET LIGHTBURNED ANYMORE AS A MINOR BUFF?!! ITS REALLY ALL I WANT!!!
---
Do vault grabs count towards this as well?
---
I wanted to say that so bad but he already seemed pissed as it was.
---
ENGAGE A KILLER IN A CHASE NEXT TIME KAPPA
---
&gt; ALSO CHARMS ARE PRETTY LAME FOR SURVIVORS
---
YOU THINK? WHEN THEY WERE INITIALLY LEAKED I THOUGHT IT SOUNDED DUMB BUT THEY TURNED OUT PRETTY CUTE IMO
---
&gt; YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPLETE MULTIPLE RIFT CHALLENGES CONCURRENTLY. AT LEAST HAVE 2 SELECTABLE AT A TIME. 
---
THIS WOULD BE A NICE QOL CHANGE FOR IT. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE SURVIVOR ONES THAT CAN TAKE A GOOD NUMBER OF GAMES, I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CONGRUENTLY DO A KILLER ONE AS WELL
---
I only marked it SFW because of what the joke is. People who don't get it would then look up the source from the comments and then they're eternally scarred by the purest physical form of hellish torture
---
[Rapists](https://i.redd.it/rgv9dsglj4f11.jpg)
---
The first perk is literally infectious fright, the second one could be decent, and the third is literally op cause if you include something like tinkerer or bitter murmur, you could just find the survivors, let them finish the gen, then one shot them for a cheap down.
---
It's kind of a signature by the people that made the maps.
---
Both ways you are a sadistic genius!
---
I dont understand why people feel the need to message people. Especially sayimg your being put on youtube. Your not a big youtuber you probably have 100 subs at most just stop lol
---
If OP’s post became part of the game then yeah.
---
Wasnt my point.
---
So. Lets say we get numbers, excellent. Now we can mathmatically provide the most powerful builds for survivor and killer, with absolitely no ambiguity. Congratulations, you e killed build diversity.
---
"But wait!" You cry, hands rubbing togwther. "We can provide the mathematically best build for all scenarios! Thats diversity!"
---
No....no it is not. Because the majority will use the *best overall build* and the outliers will be a statistical anomaly that is safe to ignore.
---
We dont need numbers.
---
How about a fucking jetpack hmu
---
TIL I LEARNED TUNNELING IS WHEN YOU OUTLAST THE KILLER FOR AN ENTIRE GAME
---
I was playing Wraith once and two of my lite totems were basically right next to each other and watched a survivor look at both of them before DCing.
---
Finally some good Yuri. Now do something with Jane and my heart will be full. &lt;3
---
Just go full totem build.
---
\*wound up
---
Looks amazing!! Can't wait to see more!
---
I agree with him
---
WHY? THAT DOESN'T HELP ME IN ANY WAY, AND REWARDS THE KILLER FOR BEING TOO SHITTY TO PUT PRESSURE ON ME ANYWAYS (BECAUSE LET'S BE CLEAR, THIS WAS A CASE OF A SHITTY KILLER).
---
ok
---
At some point, you’re going to learn the truth about your rank. Rank doesn’t have a real purpose but tougher killers.
---
Same. He's good and has quite the amount of knowledge on it but he seems a bit too arrogant and "blamey" when things don't go his way.
---
Whenever I ask my wife she says, "Were they an asshole?"

Worlds biggest pallet respect
---
For the most part that's fine, but it's gonna become a problem with the Devs trying to work towards making less safe loops and more dangerous ones that force you to drop the pallet at the last second. It's already a problem with spirit fury + enduring
---

Do i smell a dex fag?
---
Personally I don't think using the best killers around is a fair argument, just seeing as they have devoted a lot more time to this game than average players so of course they're going to be able to make him seem over powered as hell but playing against a more casual player you won't see those level of plays.
---
*hears Jane moaning in the distance*
---
You're very talented but I still hate Freddy and want him deleted. If someone reads this don't be a fool don't play Freddy
---
These people give survivor mains a bad name
---
Inb4 Tru3 posts on Twitter about how this is misinformation being spread about him by the Reddit Drones.
---
Only about 3 times as much, so 12 or so matches out of a hundred, and she appears more often at higher ranks. Then about 4 months ago, i saw her probably 25% of matches, before everyone got on the spirit train, and before demo and ghostface came out.
---
Or healing "around a corner" from a pallet only to have DedIcAtEd SerVeRs fuck you and throw the pallet...
---
No, because Duel inherently stripped the game of the majority of its depth, turning it into a completely reaction-based snoozefest. But I digress, I don't think discussing FH is really important here, ha. 
---
I completely understand what you mean, and I didn't mean to imply that skill = competitiveness. Sorry if it read like that. But going by the For Honor example: When you basically exclusively play the, in lack of a better description, "scrub modes" and avoid the actual competitive aspects of a game, then you're not a competitive player. Imagine an Overwatch player who never plays Ranked and only fucks around in Arcade modes thinks they're competitive, or, in his actual example, the Mw1 players who always played FFA on Shipment rather than Domination, S&amp;D etc. 
---
I'm not sure if I explain it properly, but basically what I mean is that, yeah, he cares about winning and what is good and such, but he doesn't actually grapples games' competitive aspects. He just wants to win and be seen as a winner and competitively-driven person.
---
NO, DC IS JUST AS CHEAP AS CAMPING, YOU ARE LITERALLY RUINING EVERYONE ELSE’S CHANCE FOR ESCAPING. KILL YOURSELF ON THE HOOK NEXT TIME, AT LEAST IT GIVES OTHERS SOME TIME TO FIX GENS
---
Same with piggy. Boop the snoot.
---
We could give them the benefit of the doubt, but we won't.
---
Yeah he’s just kinda annoying, arrogant, and downright mean now to watch.
---
Queue Owen Wilson’s “oh wow”
---
Yeah, i play both, and it really helped me get better. Especially with scratch marks, because i played alot of survivor, so i didn't understand how scratch marks worked until i switched to killer.
---
the guy I mentioned before: **NeRf Dc PeNaLtIeS!**
---
WHERE THE LAMB SAUCE?! every time he it a survivor
---
I can't believe anyone understands him well enough to form an opinion on his attitude. I've finally picked up on "goodeadard."
---
That's some gnarly burnt skin. Great drawing!
---
Yea that is prolly my favourite one but I dont think Im gonna pick it up because I dont have / plan on buying the spirit
---
This art is amazing..
---
Thank you! It means a lot &lt;3
---
Its japanese for demon.
---
I'm glad that the penalty will apply to both sides. No more killer DC'ing if ruin breaks within first 5 minutes
---
The grind in this game is real. Just unlocking teachables on every killer costs millions of Bloodpoints, not to mention actually getting those perks on the kilelrs you want...and good perks are spread out between many killers, so you have to get most of them to at least 30 if not more.
---
New players coming to this game have it tough. IMO double BP bonus should honestly be the standard.
---
Ghost face and Meyers easy
---
My first experience with the hitting through wall glitch was a disembodied Myers hand materializing in mid-air.
---
You mind answering the question, lad?
---
IT'S FUCKING RAW.
---
Hard work deserves praise at the least. And when it's good work too I should be thanking you.. until this ends up as Inspiration for DbDGoneWild.
---
Just because fan content is shown in official events does not at all make it canon. If anything it's the devs acknowledging something popular among the fanbase or saying that they like it also.
---
If being shown or used in an event made/headed by the devs meant automatic canon then a ton of franchises would have their lore completely flipped upside-down any time they've held a fanart contest.
---
He was tolerable in his Mortal Kombat streaming days, but he's incredibly annoying now. He does nothing but whine throughout the majority of his videos and comes across as if he's constantly pissed off - things that are not enjoyable.
---
No reason to play Feng when her clothes are more noticeable than the blendette if there’s no perks.
---
No one understood the joke of this post i think
---
Maybe because the killer moves faster than them, just a thought
---
BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS FOR BEING ABLE TO DO THAT ARE VERY HIGH?
---
NOT SURPRISED YOUR DUMBSHIT COMMENT GOT UPVOTED ON THIS DUMBSHIT FORUM
---
then you get hooked or slugged. Feel better?
---
Pig for sure. It’s fun scaring unsuspecting survivors.
---
Well.... art makes an impact sometimes so I guess I’ll be impactful! But until then, I’m just gonna care about how cute these two are!
---
The DC punishment is gonna be the ultimate survivor nerf
---
That hurt my soul
---
Feng is hot tho.
---
Lol thank you!
---
Doctor’s head piece &gt; Huntress.... then probably the spirit.
---
they have said they're not happy with the results and it ends up being just as bad as the farm unhooks
---
Yup. Now I can move on from that match to the next instead of wasting a perk slot to make up for my teams slack.
---
The answer to both our problems was secretly just to die on hook as fast as possible.
---
But loud. Too loud.
---
DO NOT KINK SHAME ME
---
And your proof it's exactly otz's fanbase is?
---
Fair reply.. admiring what is done right Is the right way to view something.
---
:D hard work deserves praise!
---
Like I said, they can enjoy phase 3.
---
In the nights the queue times of killer is twenty seconds
---
His worst offense to this is that he tries to pretend he invented the play style of playing Ghostface like a stealthy M1 killer, which is pretty much playing him exactly like wraith, then switching to wraith and being like “is Wraith the new ghsotface?!?!?”
---
Well that makes sense. I haven't followed him for a long time but I watch him play DBD and I must say (from what I've seen) he is not only very skilled, but very knowledgeable. And always seems to have a competitive mindset. I do see how in other games he may choose non-competitive modes. But in Dbd there is only one mode so that doesn't really apply.

The Title/description is giving me Rule34 or DbDGoneWild vibes..but the art itself is solid.. clearly a not so subtle dig at spirit... Shhh the spirit mains don't need to know...

So deathgarden?

*hits a survivor* RAW!

*lands charge on survivor* FUCKIN RAW!

You cant flashlight blind a fucking safe

That is really well made!
---
It's literally the PTB this is supposed to happen.
---
Thank you! It took like...4 hours? I did the line art twice because the first time wasn’t what I liked lol!
---
I keep a disclaimer in my profile comments at all times cause it happens to often. "Please deposit your DBD salt here."
---
This is literally what happened to Freddy and why he got nerfed to shit
---
They're surely all already out there somewhere, maybe on the Wiki?
---
"TOXIC SWF STREAM SNIPERS GET 4K'D AND STOMPED"
---
Players proceed to play a totally normal game
---
This entire situation is asinine. Why on earth would you talk about how you were deranking then talking trash about someone confused/mislead about it???
---
I'm scared yet I really want to give him a hug... HOW does someone portray Freddy that way?! Well Done artwise however... S tier.
---
HATE him. Good at the game but holy shit annoying AF
---
I once boopee ld Gosthface's snoot, he didn't like it
---
Hey 5% is still better than 1%!
---
I am the dinner man
---
This woukd explain why their all so *Angry*
---
It's not, Freddy was released on live servers before they changed him. On the PTB, things are supposed to be changed so that they're as healthy as possible for live. They can fuck around with him all they want as long as he's good for when he's officially released.
---
A full build based around it kinda fucking blows though. Survivors don't stand a chance against it - both sides need to stand some kind of chance.
---
It's especially bullshit if Forever Freddy is doing his thing too.
---
If Ghostface has a 65% success rate, and Freddy has the highest success rate (we don't know his numbers)  then how can people keep defending that shit?
---
&gt; Or just don't drop pallets at all, at least not during Feral.
---
Dropping pallet interrupt frenzy still (I think so), So as Nemesis legion you wanna m1 chase and eat a pallet, then feral into double hit + babysit the survivor as you mentioned.
---
Your point still stand tho, it is very strong but has a bunch or requirement, (you can kinda force taking a stun a killer but if you hug survivor too close without using m1 they might get suspicious and play around that) even if they don't change it from the PTB I don't think we will see Legion by Legions still.
---
If they change it tho it's good for my survivor main ass so I won't complain either way
---
Whoops
---
A lot of people are going to hate you for say that but you are right the maths says it.
---
Dedicated servers are bad and to many times I am clear of a window and get hit.

With that said this rubber banding is 100% OP's internet.
---
Ambient temp doesn't appear that cold so I'm guessing Pig has her nipples pierced...
---
Lmao your sneaky ultra brightness ass
---
Don't be silly, it isn't like the PTB is meant to test the new content and give feedback or anything.
---
The flick is rather crazy though, it literally makes any loop unsafe against him, it's like Billy with omega steering add-ons.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if he gets something changed in the full release, it's just a question of what, and another question of how fast people will start saying "Omg you destroyed another killer!! He's worse than old Freddy. Stop appealing to Rank 20 survivor mains BHVR!!"
---
The real question is would otz use save the besy for last on this?
---
It's a business, it makes you want to click on it, every YouTuber does this. Why would you ever want to make a boring title, you will get no views, no money, and it seriously isn't very ideal. If you don't wanna support it don't watch it but you clearly are intelligent enough to notice it so I don't understand how you don't fully grasp why they would do it. Definitely if it's one of their ways of getting money in
---
The level of optimal you have provided is insufficient to meet my needs. MOAR optimal.

That's what I strive to be!

---
Good question. Only answer I can give is that you shouldn't have googled it in the first place
---
Sandbagging is intentionally screwing over a teammate
---
Just down stun them with pallets
---
What do u mean ?
---
Wouldn't surprise me tbh
---
I switched the flip y axis button to my left d-pad because I never accidentally hit that button
---
The same thing that should deter tunneling any SWF, OoO or not... the gens and the fact that by the time you down obsession once you'll have probably lost 2-3 gens and are at least halfway to losing another... if not more depending on perks/toolboxes.
---
Oh, I thought you meant T-bagging...
---
Can we make it a thing that Kazan is an overprotective great great great great grandpa of Rin?
---
Oni: *rams both his weapons into Giant Dad at once*
---
GD: filthy fucking casual. Git Gud. *endlessly swings at Oni until he’s on the ground*
---
Oni: *looks to the sky/entity with puppy dog eyes*
---
Entity, interest peaked in GD as a killer: I ain’t no helicopter daddy sink or swim bitch.
---
GD: ain’t no entity gon’ save ya git gud.
---
After that, I looked in the wiki if you can open the hatch with the key if in dying state, I was so relieved that no, you can’t.
---
Well.. you got an S grade you sly shit! (I mean that in the best way &lt;3 )
---
The are many generations apart, for what it's worth. They share a name, but never met each other.
---
NGL i liked old freddy because of the information gattering he had, like you tag a bunch of survs and chase one, latter you knew where to go after you were done.
---
ITT: "Keep gender politics and sexuality out of DbD, apart from heterosexuality in character backstories, cis cast, survivor perks aligning with gender roles, etc. Of course I'm not a homophobe! It's just that You People are political, and we're normal."
---
That or "Otz wholesome uwu"
---
You can‘t open it with a key when downed, so yeah...
---
Also, both of their skin is blue. Nice catch, op. I didn’t notice these details with her Halloween cosmetic.
---
This killer is literally just clown and plagues love child in a word no
---
My deepest apologies, mate.
---
His strength was entirely situational at how good or bad the survivors were &amp; how well they understood his abilities/downfalls
---
YUP. SAME. IT LOOKS LIKE HUNTRESS HELL. THE MAPS GET WORSE AND WORSE FOR HER AS TIME GOES ON
---
you can still get merciless if you dont slug and find hatch or the other person first. But yeah dont mind me, regardless of my BS. Its just good = fun and bad = not fun. Waiting for certain doom for the last 2 person isnt fun. Its everyones game and you can do as you please. heck sometimes i do it! Sometimes Im the bad guy dont you know it! But even still i know it aint good in the receiving end. If the devs somehow manages to change this design, and the last person will absolutely have a chance for salvation. Im all for it
---
So fuckin be it. I’ll keep commenting until I forget I forget this conversation existed.

* For non-text posts (images, videos, ...), referring to the game in the title is not sufficient. The main focus of the post itself must be on Dead by Daylight.

I don't think he was the Oni when he got laid.

---
Bruh u don't neeeeeed help
---
Buff Trapper 2020
---
I dont think anyone would have complained if Rins father was survivor. Most people (me included) were hoping for it. Tbf this new survivor is super unoriginal and boring imo. The perks are cool
---
Maybe try calling your credit card company and see why they are declining it....
---
Oni literally ran around murdering farmers for not being "true samurai", discarded the bushido code, and offed his dad. He a pissed off **evil** badass.
---
That's not what I was saying, I was saying in p2p, I only had lag spikes when the killers ping spiked, not mine. Also, it could have been, but without anyway to really know, I'll concede that.
---
Well...yeah, most of the time i relied in surprise smacks and having intel, i wasn't neither too good or extremelly bad with him since you can mind game and hit them like any other killer and that's all i needed. Of course this is subjective, i had loads of fun as freddy before rework(got rank 1 with him) and after the re he became a powerhouse, still miss the aura reading tho.
---
Bold of you to call Rin a samurai.
---
It's called stop chasing someone for 10 minutes. Everyone who complains about gen rushing chases the same person for the entire match while everyone does gens.
---
I really just feel like chopping up your daughter like cheddar cheese outweighs doing normal dad things like paying for her schooling
---
Don’t give it to them. They never let you get a free kill.
---
What rank are you that you can’t pip?
---
I know why the jar, but why Jane?
---
Wait why do lgbt people need charity money, they don’t have disabilities or anything dafuq
---
Oh wow that is actually a good idea, mind if i shamelessly steal it from you ?
---
Ever heard of Diversion? It does just that whilst also projecting a noise alert to the killer.
---
This fucker is going to get backstab fished and reverse parried
---
YOU SOUND UNHINGED WTF
---
Ty
---
How is NOED even unfair? Just cleanse totems?
---
I insist.
---
Ah cheers, yeah was in an enclosed space so that will be why
---
When i see this i just assume that it was a survivor who got "EGC camped" because i wanted to secure a kill, while their teammates were so obviously trying to bait me away... sorry for trying to do my objective, i guess ?
---
I would love to see hopper and was even expecting him to come instead of Nancy or steve, given what happened to him at the end of season 3.
---
It would be fucking sweet if we got or started getting  packs for licensed killers that gave them new skins based on other movies and new survivors, so with Nancy we could either get a pack that us og freddy or the entity from wes craven's new nightmare, which is essentially just freddy in a trench coat.
---
&gt; HIS POWER IS BASICALLY AN INVITATION TO TRACK
---
OH NO NOT TRACKING! WHAT A HORROR SHOW FOR THE POOR LITTLE SURVIVORS
---
No one cares
---
Two can play that game.
---
* Clown wanting to use his power
---
* Survivor camps pallet
---
* Clown holding back tears "please let me use my power sawg I'm begging you"
---
* Leatherface wants to hit people with his saw
---
* Survivor vaults a window
---
* Leatherface holding back the tears "Please let me one hit you dawg I'm begging you"
---
She was abandoned at a temple and raised with nothing but her faith. She definitely was wrong to blindly follow her gods, but she was objectively not a bad person. She used the limited knowledge and life experience she had and made a (bad) choice in an attempt to help her people. I don’t think she’s even remotely evil or deserving of her place as a killer, ESPECIALLY compared to the likes of Myers, Ghostface, Freddy, Trapper, Clown, or Frank.
---
Lmao i saw him nut when he ran it with Nemesis the other day.
---
Since you know the sauce, think: what did OP do with Rainbow Dash?
---
"To add your contribution to my DBD museum of salt, please insult me down below." 
---
  
---
Now they have to agree to my TOS stating that they're taking the bait
---
You can still blind. It only counts Pallet and Locker stuns. So DS also does nothing to it, but that doesn’t matter anyways since no one with Deep Wounds would be going for the save.
---
I play about 8 hours a day. I have 1150 hours in the game and I only got it 6 months ago. I need help :/
---
True lol
---
I do it all the time, Especially when the person who unhooks me is down a hook. I also take a hit for people with borrowed time to ensure they escape or at least wastes a lot of the killers time
---
we're putting Jane in the jar.....
---
Yeah you're right. I could remove the fact that you can gain charges from hooks and maybe reduce the amount of charges you get
---
&gt;  I ran the killer for almost two gens. Completed one on my own and one coop.
---
&gt;  So we are down to two people with three gens left.
---
This doesn't check out
---
They were also usually playing against their viewers, who are survivors I have played with and against, and are always at red ranks. They weren't stomping newbies, they were stomping experienced, veteran survivors. Not to mention it only took them a handful of games to get to that point.
---
I sat in the basement from start to finish and don't hook a single person, I played chest defender. maybe read my post before coming and being toxic lol
---
The one memorable match i had with old freddy was bleeding out all 4 survivors at mothers dwelling, other than that it was getting dunked on constantly at coldwind
---
I would woosh you, but I don't have enough power to generate woosh so powerful to woosh some sense to you...
---
Big yikes.......You're not even conducting yourself as a person are this point you're a caricature man.
---
I completely relate lmao. I'm actually getting spun as killer on dedi servers because survivors turn SO FUCKING FAST now it's almost impossible to track them.
---
This sub seriously loves to exaggerate in memes
---
*\*proceeds to follow scratchmarks and hit him\**
---
Yeah, a lot of idiots are jumping all over this like it's some ingenious brainstorm...meanwhile I've been doing the SAME thing with insidious for a year now.
---
2 seconds of standing still way less wasteful than having to eat a pallet stun.
---
But, have fun with that.
---
Ghostface is not appeased by the boops. Tea-bagging, however, really gets him going and is a surefire way to make a new best friend. Or die a horrible death. It's worth the risk.
---
Jane in a jar...
---
^(what)
---
Trapper looking like an angler fish.
---
Thank you. I'm tired of people asking for Rin's dad as a survivor. He's dead. Its done. And Rin is trapped forever now.
---
I didn't think about it, but now I can't stop to ship it ❤️❤️❤️
---
i mean a good leatherface can hit somebody mid vault
---
:'(
---
Cool, never noticed that. Nice detail.
---
Imagine being a fucking cocksucker on a gripe thread for someone posting their gripe. Also we dont have only one killer that eliminates stealth you stupid fucking barstool. And you managed to forget the part after track where I said tunnel. It's an invitation to tunnel. You cant break the chase with a killer whose power it seeing your blood. Literally go fist yourself.
---
DemoGordon Ramsay : downs Jane
---
DemoGordon Ramsay : "Finally, some delicious fucking food"
---
&gt; AND WHOEVER IS THE LAST ONE LEFT, THEY TAUNT THEM WITH THE HATCH AND SLAM IT IN THEIR FACE.
---
WOW YOUR LIFE SOUNDS REALLY DIFFICULT
---
It is an indicator that the survivor is toxic, at least.
---
Horse is yamaoka horse...and clown’s map...that means...Clown is the true heir. Obviously.
---
What if Clown had a 3rd eye on his belly button
---
Amanda isn’t really sadistic, she’s just parroting a mantra forced upon her that broke her mind. She’s not like Myers or Ghostface, who’re all “hehe kill u cuz fun &gt;:)”. She’s been deluded into thinking that humanity isn’t worth saving because people are inherently evil. While she is ultimately a bad person and nowhere near the likes of Anna, Rin, Adiris, or Susie in terms of sympathy, she wouldn’t really be quite the same level as most other licensed killers (except Leatherface and Demogorgon bc they’re mostly feral)
---
FUCK KILLERS ARE OVERPOWERED NERF KILLERS!NERF KILLERS NERF KILLERS,MAKE IT POSSIBLE SO SURVIVORS CAN KILL KILLERS,GAME SO UNBALANCED OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Man, I just gave a free hook to a Billy getting bullied on Haddonfield. I literally stood still.   
---
What I get? Camping time!
---
*glances at scoops ahoy Steve getting moried in the background*
---
Probably.
---
Moo
---
I don't think you've watched Samination either, that or you got wooshed.
---
I hate tve reworked Freddy .. not because hes bad its just not fun to play imo especially with fake pallets , old Freddy was countered really ez but i think the skill it involed to actually kill people was more for me
---
When you open the chest instead of vaulting the loop next to Maurice in Fsther Campbell’s chapel
---
#SPECULATION
---
It doesn’t have to be a gen grab, just follow them closely and grab them when they go through a window
---
I think you are a **little** lost.
---
It's especially fun when they sandbag you, then DC as soon as they get caught
---
Yea, you would think. But it’s completely inconsistent. “Tremendously XYZ” on Legion is COMPLETELY different from “Tremendously ABC” on Plague.
---
That would be fucking sweet to get. Even though they wont allow any shapeshifting/disuse based killer ingame, I would love to see them do what they did with ash were they put him in as  a solo survivor.
---
Sailor dwight.
---
wow. i feel kinda stupid. but kills is a short word and don't see it needing an abbreviation, unless that's just DBD slang to be cool.
---

Make sure the address is right with your bank and steam.
---
Mostly everybody piling on a gen &amp; rushing it in front of my face while i tried to pull anybody into sleep and the awake survivors bodyblocked knowing i cant hit them
---
I think you may have been taking that comment a little too seriously lol
---
he is a child
---
Old Freddy did not have decent stall in his power at all. It was much too easy to wake up
---
Ah ok
---
Did u play on swamp?
---
Clown causing survivors to camp pallets is a positive feature of his ability not a negative
---
Are’s there 4 of them? Where is the last one?
---
So adding a vaukting animation and changing prayer beads wasn't enough? Should Spirit even be able to use her power? Maybe Spirit should have her invisibility taken away and she should keep her terror radius. It's not fair to have survivors nit know what the killer is doing.
---
Hag and it's not even close
---
Playing Ash stealthy does a disservice to his character. But then again doing anything other than stunning and blinding the Killer all match does a disservice to his character.
---
Well except the legion since that's just 4 killers mixed into 1
---
Then they have to make something twice maybe? Although it would seem just a change in scale.
---
It’s random for me. Also depends on how they act/what character they’re playing.
---
i mean yeah fun is subjective but if you want more skill based freddy just use his snares &amp; aura addons
---
The meat packing one, saw map
---
well, there were addons that let you:
---
1. sleep them faster so you can hit them asap.
---
2. speed boost you after they are sleep so you can catch up to them or even better...
---
3. sleep other surv mid chase and get a speed boost to for the current one you are chasing
---
4. and distance addons that turned your sleep power into a radar to negate stealth, convined with the speed addon is like hitting nitro in a racing game.
---
5. class photo allowed you to get EVERYONE so you can plan an ambush acordingly.
---
6. the speed reduction and less skill checks were a pasive bonus you could use when not felling like doing anyting in particular.
---
uwu
---
I mean most of this info is lifted from Otz's videos on the subject. I just formatted it into a Reddit table.
---
Just a coincidence i dont believe you
---
That'll take a while haha
---
Any of survivor in the dream world would be out within seconds
---
if you're right on their ass you can still make that last hit frame
---
Hes my habibi
---
And that's fine as long as you understand you are wasting my time. Which is why I put that person back on the hook. I get messages from Angry survivors who do that and get upset when I down them again
---
but the post is exactly a killer complaining that the game made it too easy for them...
---
The best build in general is just that. In general. We cant *prove* its the best, so people dospute it. They build other things, they try different styles, it works. But if we could literally prove that using A perk vs B perk is a literal detriment then diversity suffers. If you can literally prove, mathematically, what build is absolutely best, then people will only gravitate to that build and overall playstyles will tank. Is it frustrating to have to play guessing games? Sure, im not saying your wrong in any fashion, but what I am sayingnis that I fully understand why the devs dont release the true values.
---
It's still amazing to me how many folks play against Hag and don't ever crouch! &gt;:)
---
Also, fire pretty.
---
So? Does every act of good have to have one in return?
---
They look amazing, but if 2 &amp; 3 were swapped for  Michael Myers and The Cannibal, I'd have to wear these myself! Lol.
---
Bullshit, I got several 4K's [here](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/941713791257719412/64FC5A0302F487C293F18EBF07D6A97DF0EE0263/) and [here](https://i.redd.it/751lotm88z321.jpg) with Perkless Freddy.
---
I liked OG Freddy so much I bought him, since he felt like an extension of Doctor's playstyle and it was amusing to be kicking ass with "The worst killer in DBD". It felt like the higher ranks I went, the more effective I was, since high rank survivors have tons of experience against Spirit, Billy, and Nurse, making it totally unexpected when Freddy shows up. 
---
With Freddy I felt like being looped hardly ment jack shit. If I felt like a survivor was wasting my time I'd simply disengage from the chase. Now the survivor has to go away from loops to find a gen to wake up with, and I'd usually ambush him then.
---
It is objectively EASIER to wake up now. They included Sabo Skillchecks and Clocks while removing exactly one way to wake up. 
---
Forever Freddy has an absolute max of 61% for non obsessions. Old Freddy with just Swing Chains had a 62.5% penalty for everyone.
---
What event cosmetic?
---
Every single time I have the opportunity to give the last survivor hatch, they struggle. At that point,
---
*It's killin' time*
---
FUCK YES!
---
i’m dyspraxic aka i have the worst hand eye co-ordination ever so it’s v v difficult anyway but thanks for the tips!
---
Let us know how killer is in the high red ranks. You will go back to survivor.
---
Sounds like you didn't get some free samples or something.
---
Not necessarily. Like I said, it's just an indicator. Not determinative.
---
It's the default shirt of Kate but in white with a orange moon.

Welcome to life in the solo Q.   Where you get stuck playing with 2/3 man SWFs who intentionally screw over the random if it can even minor benefit their team.
---
How did you manage To miss the joke this bad....
---
The drawing is amazing, however Freddy looks like a very nice chap over here.
---
I supopse in this Universe, Freddy got burned to protect the kids.
---
WRONG!
---
Most of his addons now are pretty ass ngl
---
You might be able to sometimes, but you have to be touching them to do so, and at that point almost nothing saves them.
---
How did you get it in the first place?
---
Needs more jpeg
---
Yeah but it’s just easier to say and everyone understands it’s meaning. Humans try to abbreviate thing quite a bit, even myself. 
---
Like my favorite band is called Cattle Decapitation but when speaking about it almost everyone types Cattle Decap.
---
Just used it and it was smoking spilnter bugged
---
With the event...
---
It's not at all toxic in itself, but is often used by folks who are trying to be jerks to taunt/get attention from the killer, so there's an association. But no, just clicking a flashlight isn't toxic. Like a lot of shitty behaviours ingame, it's all about the context! :D
---
...but if they were runnig along side you, first they are wasting time since they are not doing anything else i.e: gens, and second: you can just ignore them since they can't "bodyblock" you per say plus free sleeping survs that you could hit in seconds if they don't scram
---
Sucks when that happens. :(
---
LMAO no one is encouraging. I'm saying if they don't like basement defender games then they can DC. who is it gonna hurt honestly.
---
So now we know what the problem is and can tell others
---
You could also just not stun them with the pallet to counter it since the survivors are the only people that can activate that perk
---
Groundbreaking detective work
---
Its bc as soon as minor nerfs are announced for killers most OP shit they freak out and act like its freddy and legion all over again
---
I said "what the fuck" out loud but I also upvoted so take that as you will
---
Sure, *if* it happen again
---
Maurice new killer confirmed.
---
yep ONE TIME i left a totem alone, killer had devour and i never did that again

[More memey origin of giant dad](https://youtu.be/oyA8odjCzZ4)

Every now and then I get someone adding me on Steam and then I see the friend request like 4 hours later. I check their profile, see that they play DBD and add them to ask "why add?"
---
Get a mountain of salt and I'm just sitting here like "wait you were a Survivor in a match I played?"
---
~~And then I unfriend and block them. :)~~
---
I'm not saying that he's a good killer. Just that what you mentioned in particular isn't a good point for your defense of old Freddy
---
Mainly because I am a new player and she seems pretty difficult
---
the fuck? for every pallet? there would be 0 counter to someone just Holding W to gain bloodlust.

I did as well, same results.

I don't know and I don't think I wanna know.
---
It's one of the starter perks so it's no teachable you just have to level to get it
---
Okay the buildup made it work it :P
---
it’s a general killer perk meaning it’ll show up in anyone’s bloodweb, you have to level someone for a bit before you can find it.
---
Because I've heard of Samination but I haven't watched their vids? And people are always trying to insist things are canon when they aren't, no matter how stupid they sound?
---
I'm sorry papa, have I disappointed you and been a bad fan because I didn't watch the thing? I promise I'll watch everything relating to the game from now on so I don't miss any more dumb jokes.
---
landing balanced
---
Distressing is a generic perk that anyone can find on their bloodweb
---
This is horrifying and I love it well done
---
You'd have to chase them and hit them with frenzy then chase them until you get bloodlust to then wait for the bleed timer to down them. Bloodlust takes 15 seconds to start and gets reset on hits and breaking pallets while the deep wound timer is around 15 seconds as well, couple that with the fact that you need to chase them to begin the entire exchange and still bring them to hooks it ends up taking around a minute for that strat to actually down someone while the other 3 survivors have no pressure on them whatsoever since your entire focus is on that single person you started chasing
---
Hmmmm ok  I prestige my hillybilly. My trapper is level 25 and nurse I believe is 29. Do you know how far into leveling up before it pops up? And do you know what the perk does?
---
I mean 'Okay' is a short word, but people shorten it to 'OK'. And some shorten it further to 'K'.
---
Humans are busy people.
---
I would love to have the actual numbers.
---
Fair enough.
---
Damn! Great job!!!
---
I hate when I'm about to hit a skillcheck and they cancel the heal so I just drop the pallet in our faces
---
I’ll definitely show you when I hop on my pc. Playing nurse only (especially during blood hunt) pretty much guarantees you points.
---
No, I was saying that about p2p. I know it's different on dedi servers. I was just saying that about the old system.
---
100% death sentence
---
I know that feel bro. I currently have like 55k shards, they take so long to get that I never want to spend them.
---
The problem with making deep wound, for both legion and BT, radius based is that on smaller maps legion becomes much worse and BT becomes better against every killer. Imagine having BT on a map like the game, if you get it activated then even if the killer is on a different floor from you the timer still won't go down since the distance mechanic in the game works in three dimensions
---
it can show up anytime, the bloodweb is randomized
---
your terror radius is increased by about 25 percent, i forgot the exact number. you also get more bloodpoints for deviousness.
---
i see it pop up all the time so make sure you’re searching really well and look up what the icon looks like. it is a beating heart. if you don’t have it then it’ll probably show up soon!
---
That used to happen to me if a gen grabbed someone and they DCed. I would be stuck in the grabbing animation for the rest of the game
---
"Mori's are broken the cut the game in half"  
---
"I only use them after the game's gone on a while"  
---
"Reeeee"
---
&gt; Snares and Pallets do. The cool down of his Gen TP greatly benefits from sleeping survivors.
---
Hitting them is what gets them asleep and those two things are extremely strong against injured survivors. And the cooldown for teleporting even when they're all awake is not that long
---
&gt; The 61% exists only when everyone was on death hook. At that point you are a hook away from snowballing to victory. And it doesn't fully apply to one survivor as a bonus.
---
&gt; The 62.5% was one add-on and no perks. With Swing Chains and Jump Rope he had a 72.5% slowdown with the only requirements being they are asleep.
---
No idea how this fits into your defense of old Freddy at all. This is so minimal in comparison
---
have you ever encountered some toxic surv that wants to DS you so bad, that they go into a almost completed gen for you to grab them?
---
his current addons i mean, besides slowdown &amp; pallets none of his addons are particularly unique
---

---
yeah. Whenever I play as killer I usually just tunnel until they're dead
---
why is there 6 survivors???

"-chan" can also be used as an affectionate suffix, like how many people call their SOs "baby". Oni-chan is a play on onii-chan, for instance, which is ironically used by children talking to their older brothers.

the problem with what you're saying is that different perks don't do the same thing. you can't look at the number difference between 2 perks that do completely different things and say one is mathematically better. missing a ruin skillcheck gives 5% regression, but PGTW does 25% regression, so PGTW is mathematically better than ruin right? you see how that doesnt make sense?
---
I got accused of not participating in gameplay for slugging a nea by a stereotypical immersed blendette. 
---
I was finding hatch, found it hooked nea and slammed it closed.
---
Nea was really happy I killed the Claud and they were filling end chat with salt mostly to each other as I just kinda watched.
---
On that note, event though he might have been a good dad i think killing your family lowers it a bit. Not to mention Oni values his honor and his family above all else(if i remember correctly he let himself get killed by those farmers after he killed his dad) and he had a son that he cared for alot and did a lot to protect him and get back at those who bullied him.you can read about that in the addons. So if the oni and the spirit met, Oni would probably see her as fanily and do anything to protect her. Probably would hate rins dad because he brought shame on the family name.
---
I just realized this holy shit. I have no clue lmao. good eye
---
"I'm annoyed that people who haven't watched this thing take a post seriously on a sub where people are serious about what is and isn't canon rather regularly"
---
"PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW IT'S A JOKE AND WHAT THE CONTENT OF THOSE JOKES ARE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVEN'T WATCHED THE THING"
---
Have I understood it correctly now?
---
happy cake day! :D
---
I think Oni is the better, balanced version of Billy.   
---
sincerely- a survivor and killer main
---
So the killers never really get a chance to talk with each other or show any kind of relationships, rivalries or anything they may have. Obviously from a gameplay perspective this is understandable, but how cool would it be if we got lore about how different killers maybe interacted with each other outside of trials, some hate each other, some like each other - just stuff like that.  
---
Very much a pipedream and i don't *blame* anyone for the lack of interaction, it would just be cool to see
---
That would be cool, I've always wanted a Deep Sea Diver killer with a harpoon gun weapon. We still don't have an aquatic themed killer
---
It's infuriating, one of the survivors came over and started tbagging before doing the gen behind me. Said GG as they all escaped. 
---
Fun game.
---
Did you ever used to get unstuck?
---
I already say this as a killer main. Then again,  I also don't face camp, tunnel, almost always give hatch and try to compliment survivors on their good plays. And play Leatherface solely because I don't have any teachables unlocked and BBQ and Chili helps a lot with that.
---
Can't say I've had a toxic endgame chat yet.
---
I’m always down.
---
He needs something to help in chases
---
If numbers shouldn't be in the game, then the use of slightly/moderately/considerably/tremendously should actually be accurate, because Swift Hunt's "tremendous" decrease to uncloak time is a whopping four tenths of a second, for a purple add-on.    
---
    
---
Numbers should be in the game so people can actually understand how utterly useless some add-ons are.
---
Oni chan saving his sister,how cute
---
I sometimes give a free kill when the killer is nice and otherwise wouldn’t have got any kills, but tbf probably seen a random do it like only once or twice
---
This needs more likes. Lol.
---
Thank you  I'll keep an eye out now!
---
Oni-chan is best boi.
---
Kimura Yui is great. Her reference to her name is Yui because of actual legitimate names from japan
---
&gt;Hitting them is what gets them asleep and those two things are extremely strong against injured survivors. And the cooldown for teleporting even when they're all awake is not that long
---
45 seconds with no asleep is a pretty long cool down. That's a gen with two stacked on it. Snares can be pallet camped and fake pallets may not fool survivors. Not denying their strength, but they do have counters. 
---
&gt;No idea how this fits into your defense of old Freddy at all. This is so minimal in comparison
---
You said he had no decent stall. I was adressing that point by comparing it to forever Freddy who is known for game slowdown.
---
Lol ty I did do previous ones but I posted them in October?it had Michael Myers, wraith,trapper, huntress, and hillbilly
---
Well if you look at the situation:
---
You have one survivor in the injured state, one in the deep wounds state.
---
The one with deep wounds has to go mend and also has a sprint burst effect from your hit.
---
So choosing this one as your target is the wrong choice unless he runs towards a dead zone, while the injured moves to a safe loop.
---
You are making the emotional decision to tunnel, not the strategic one, and people call you out for it.
---
We already have the numbers, they are just on third party sites and videos.
---
Not always. But most of the time I can’t get that far because my teammates die immediately.
---
selflessness means that you go out of your way and dont do anything for yourself.   
---
selfishness is doing something only for yourself
---
Dan is a boolie, he calls me stinky all the time
---
&gt; You said he had no decent stall. I was adressing that point by comparing it to forever Freddy who is known for game slowdown.
---
You utterly failed to prove it
---
I let the last survivor open the gate then grabbed them off
---
I wish I had recorded it. It had to be only 10 or less away.
---
It's actually r/dbdgonegay
---
It's OP because the majority of the time that people use OoO is in a swf and that immediately gives all of them a massive advantage since one person taking it almost means that everyone in their swf group has it
---
What if I....parked my motorcycle next to yours...haha just kidding...unless?
---
You don’t want to know. Lol. Low. I just can’t get games to last long enough.
---
plague def aint b tier 😳
---
I really fucking want a chibi version of every killer and survivor, I would love if the lvl 100 rewards could have animations.
---
I just really fucking want a smoll dancing huntress on my hook.
---
Huntress and gag need to switch
---
If their that bad maybe, but really that means more saves for you.
---
My favorite is when they run into you and just walk away as calmly as possible
---
CHARMS ARE FINE I GUESS, MORESO FOR KILLERS BECAUSE AT LEAST YOU CAN SEE THEM. BUT NOT EVERY LEVEL UP ON THE RIFT CAN BE FOR SOMETHING AMAZING. IMO, BHVR JUST NEEDS TO HAVE SOME MORE VARIED OPTIONS (EVEN LIKE LOADING SCREENS OR SOMETHING). AT THIS STAGE, I WOULDN'T SPEND MONEY ON THE PASS.
---
Careful, she’s standing there faking the phase.
---
Real talk, the drawing is very clean and awesome!
---
yui from k-on!!!
---
Nice! Feel free to add me! GT: BGFNCY 
---
I pretty much play daily... got a couple of friends that play regularly!
---
Personally speaking.
---
I'd say that Rin is actually the "chosen" one in the Yamaoka lineage who by secondary means, resurrects Kazan. Kazans blood doesn't dictate what Rin came to be, she is just more powerful than he is/was.
---
Kazan was only known colloquially as an Onii, or Troll due to his murderous resolve, but he never actually was - he was just a nasty misguided bastard. He wears/had worn a mask in both life and death, so therefore had no evil entwinement.
---
With Rin however, her head cosmetic implies that she has a birthright to an Akuma (greater than an Onii) a spiritual tie to evil coupled with the fact that an Akumas face has physically merged into hers rather than a mask.
---
So in my opinion at least (I could be wrong) she is far more deadly than Kazan as this makes her both a demon and Onryō (vengeful spirit)
---
No. See people just attempt escape and die before I get there. It is rare that I have a game with 4 people still alive after the first few minutes. Most games I get rank 20s that get hooked immediately. Their friend tries to same them, but goes down and gets hooked too. So they both just kill themselves. Sometimes it’s one person sometimes three. Game doesn’t last much longer than that.
---
I’VE HEARD IT’S CAUSED BY UNCAPPED FPS, BUT IDK
---
How? I proved he had more than Forever Freddy and that it is easier to get to that point. Plus it is harder to wake up to ignore it. 
---
Question, do you believe Forever Freddy has good stall?
---
If so, then you say a weaker stall that is harder to get going is better slowdown than an easier slowdown that's more potent.
---
"In one game"
---
Thank you, I man that can take a joke.. even rarer than a good day in dbd
---
Ok boomer
---
agreed.
---
Was this in one of the Azarov maps?
---
Freddy is way too low.  He's either just behind Spirit or just behind Billy depending on how well you know the man.
---
I dunno what to say, if your that low rank you should be able to have a long ass chase with the killer. Play swf if you arent good enough
---
Truth spoken.
---
Yeah rank means fucking nothing in this game actually. If the match making system was made with levels instead of rank this game would be greater
---
okay. Like I said, if you did not know, you have to be outside a certain range to get the aura. It can only truly be used like you said early game, and if you've detached yourself from the game and went to do a gen far away. There is no need to have 4 people run Object If they're using it like you say happens. Only 1 person needs to have info to give it to them. Even if that does happen, it is very situational. But yes,I agree,in that situation,it is very OP
---
I thought this was just gonna be another r6 meme then I saw it was from the dbd sub
---
It's frustrating but sometimes it happens.  You'll be locked into place until they fully disconnect from the game, unless it's a different variation of the bug I've experienced.
---
Word!
---
I believe the dead rabbit is percent based and so the 4 meters is with M&amp;A. Otherwise the numbers would be the same.
---
So dead rabbit reduces terror radius by 50% in T2 and increases by 50% in T3. Or something like that. So 16m with dead rabbit brings it down to 8. But with M&amp;A it's already at 8 so rabbit brings it to 4m.
---
I hope this is clear and also that the numbers are not wrong. Someone please correct me
---
I picked up the Hag one. It's very well done.
---
I DSed and did this and just came out and begged for him to kill me
---
Personally, there's only three reasons you should  
---
insidious camping
---
borrowed time
---
If there isnt NOED and they run behind to protect. Blendette (me), a laurie, adam, and jeff were our protection. Laurie and I were hurt. We ran Indian style to protect each other. Full escape
---
We want demo to be better. Portals seal too fast and take too long to set up.
---
Again, there’s no issue with her being strong. That’s what we need, we need more strong killers so we have more than 3 killers in red ranks. The issue with her is that every single killer shows some kind of indicator that they’re using their power. Billy revs his chainsaw, Nurse holds up her hand, Huntress charges the hatches, etc. If there was a simple animation for survivors to see that she’s using her power, that would be great. Survivors don’t nessecarily have to see where she’s going when phasewalking, just a simple indicator that she is phasewalking is enough. As it is, you can literally keep your hands off your keyboard and mouse and this is considered a ‘mindgame’.
---
It's the internet man, the question nowadays is why not?
---
Bingo!
---
Oh I get that too but I’d never get red rank against a grey rank
---
I too was curious why SCP 1471 was dressed as Caveira
---
That's just it though, swf happens a lot more frequently since playing solo has so much more of a disadvantage than playing as a group, so all you'd have to do is have someone in that group be a gen jockey with OoO on and the entire group knows the location of the killer, and even if you go to kill the guy that has OoO on, since it's swf they know that you're going after him and can just focus on gens. So it becomes a choice between having one person sit there and tell the rest of them your every move or you go after the one person while the other three do the gens anyways
---
That's not how killer mains operate.  Everything is exaggerated hyperbole with them.  Look at how they "massacred" Nurse and Spirit!!!  (Still the two best killers in game no change at all to tier placement lol).  They are extremely over dramatic and are represented exceedingly poorly on this sub which is a shame because I'm sure there's plenty of them out there capable of rationale objective thought.  They simply don't stick out as much as the cartoon characters do on here.
---
Then Im fine with the way you play if they deserve it, some survivors are assholes
---
Maybe the Entity doesn't let them be together in fear of them cooperating against it? We already know Myers can defy The Entity so knows what would happen if he got help.
---
Yes, the Ghost Face had the red devil mask, and ruin.
---
Im the Jeff watching my teammates get downed going for an unsafe hook then I decide to just let them both die. instead of unhooking them where I get downed while they self care and I die first hook. There's no use saving teammates when 2 people are downed at hook at the start of the game. Stop feeding the killer delicious free hits
---
Yes just bloodlust 1 pallet and you already get this easily
---
Bruh the oni and the dad fell to the same influence. The dad didn’t decide to kill his family the dad was influenced by the entity. The oni was influenced in the same way to kill the dude who called him oni.
---
Asking for sauce
---
Oh nevermind. I had a similar game last night and thought it was me
---
See, this is the problem. We don't even know if numbers are flat or percentage based, so we don't know how addons interact with other addons or perks.
---
Dead Rabbit, according to wiki, doesn't make it much clearer:
---
- Reduces the Terror Radius of Evil Within II by 25 % or 4 metres to 12 metres.
---
- Increases the Terror Radius of Evil Within III by 25 % or 8 metres to 40 metres.
---
I still have no idea how it's actually coded, always 8 meters regardless of M&amp;A or Distressing, or % based, and if it's % based, does it apply before or after perks?
---
Whichever supplements your ego I suppose.
---
**YOU WATCH YOUR TONGUE BOI**
---
Looks cool.... that’s freddy teenage years. Lol
---
Maybe because they're both dead?
---
I love every single Demogorgon powers and think they are good but I catch myself not using the portals that much, but the shred much much more
---
Dad by Daylight
---
He doesn't realise Dex is far inferior to my Dark Harald build.
---
No thoughts on whether or not he needs nerfs but this:
---
&gt; I can name at least 4 very good big streamer killer mains who agree he needs to be changed.
---
why do we act like this matters at all?
---
You lose every addon, offering and perk (apart from the character’s 3 unique perks).
---
Thank you! I’m just trying to get used to Procreate on the ipad! I’ll def be posting more!
---
Biker girlfriends are the best kind of ship...
---
Depends if his last game wasn’t great, then he decides to take it out on you
---
This isn’t what I was expecting, but it’s what I’ll take.
---
i agree. People overreact to every small nerf/change even if its hardly a nerf at all. its not new to survivors when they get nerfed, but when killers have an unstoppable force like they do with nurse, spirit, and now oni they latch onto it and refuse to let go. 
---
Oni is gonna get nerfed wayyyy less then BL did.
---
A lot of them are, but not all
---
literally no one said Spirit was massacred. You are making shit up. the only people who say Nurse was massacred are console players where that's totally true
---
and lol at you taking off your "I play both sides mask" finally. you clearly play zero killer
---
&gt; Everything is exaggerated hyperbole with them.
---
lmfao what about survivor mains always screaming how survivors were nerfed into the ground because they lost instablinds and pallet vacuums
---
right so if we're going to drag in BL lets acknowledge this is because of maps broken in survivor's favor
---
It's the new DC into trap tech. I've had a few survivors do this and start teabagging me. As if playing the trapper isn't miserable enough already.

---
Yesterday I was having awesome luck finding lit totems quickly. Twice I found Ruin within the first minute or so of the game. Killer DC'd both times.
---
i would say the only maps that spirit has a slight disadvantage is indoor maps. Since good survivors can hear your footsteps.
---
I would say her best map for new spirit players is rotten fields.
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
play bond, and you counter the whole power
---
Classic right there. messaging you post game he really expected you to be salty about it but because you didn’t give him a reaction his only choice was to say that he got under your skin. We need a crouch cooldown for survivors honestly
---
DC inc
---
i love them aAAAA :'DD
---
A new ship is born!
---
Anyone who went to school would know that 8% is more than 3%, so there is no reason why they shouldn't have numbers
---
Haha reminds me of a time around that tractor with the window. I jump over and I notice he’s not following me through the window, so I go to a pallet beside it and I saw a red light so I smashed it down... right on a Dwight with the killer behind him...oops
---
I love the use of the word penultimate.
---
Take my upvote
---
To bad that nearly nobody play  with the demogorgon.I never met him.
---
He's saying that back when it was P2P this happened less often, and he would always assume its the killers connection and not his own.
---
Now that we have dedicated servers, the issue seems more prevalent and a much worse gaming experience as a result.

There are 9 survivors.

Feel free to see my post history from last night where I replied to a guy claiming Nurse and Spirit are both trash now.
---
Ffs one of u wealthy folk gild this man.
---
It may not have been an Azarov map, as it was green.  I'm not good with some of the map names.  I was Bill if it helps.
---
pretty much,youtubers only upload the good bits lol,this is why I like youtubers that upload raw footage
---
If you've played Evil Within, this guy can teleport via other safes on the ground. Maybe something like Freddy's gen teleport but with pre-spawned safes on the ground.
---
I'm sure they'll have one for stunning a killer with a pallet you've already stunned 'em with.
---
Dark Souls
---
My BF is the same way 😂
---
Bl change was a lazy band aid fix, it def does not fix maps like pantry or haddonfield. It does make em better but i think people will figure out quickly that those maps are broken in general
---
What is that yellow bar at the top i still havent figures it out?
---
Responding.
---
You play on a controller? Because I believe via keyboard it's two different keys, but – same here. I hate it especially when survivors are downed and crawl to a pallet, and I wanna pick them up real quick while getting chased but I can't because I'd drop the pallet instead ... \*insert clown emoji\*
---
Looking forward to some good times!!!!!!
---
how do you have it so bright?! that map is dark as fuck
---
Imagine being a butthurt surv who probably also uses DC and balanced landing
---
This is the gay agenda ™
---
at least it has somewhat of a face
---
Marvin the Tap Dancing Horse confirmed
---
THANOS HAG
---
I think the entity worries about that, so I explain the nerfs the entity is fearing x killer might be far too strong and could break from its control so it physically weakens it... just my headcanon.
---
i said this to avoid the "shut up entitled survivor main" comments. trust me ik that just bc someone is a streamer it doesnt make there opinion more valid. i just prefer not to have actual screaming in the comments of this post.
---
You’re right ps4.
---
Bubba best killer against these people
---
Keeper is essentially the same thing. Closed face to start, opens up, etc.
---
I'm here for it!
---
you are an entitled survivor main tho just own it
---
Yeah no, it wasn’t me. I don’t own the red devil ghostface mask
---
Except Dead Hard is broken after dedicated servers went live. It's still useful for gaining distance in loops/vaults but not so much dodging hits. I mean, it was never perfect to begin with, but it got worse with dedicated servers
---
oh god so it begins.
---
those changes where made ages ago when people sucked dick at the game. 
---
also i saw so many people complaining that spirit was getting nerfed. They ironically spammed it on this reddit saying it was bc survivors crying.
---
Lore has already been revealed.
---
He's an ancient samurai from back when it was a warrior caste you were born to, and went on a murderous rampage because peasants were allowed to be Samurai as well.
---
Imagine getting mad at someone for the way they choose to play a game
---
Ah, okay! I already thought of changing the keys for this reason, but we don't really have that many options lmao (I play on computer with an XBOX controller)
---
link it please
---
also you totally proved my point about you guys screaming about insta blinds and pallet vacuums in one of your comments lmfao so thanks for that
---
This is so cool.
---
I usually play wraith/piggy, so if I saw that pre-rework of OoO, i woulda dc'ed, without hesitation. I'm drawing the line in the sand,  miss me with that gay shit.
---
Post-rework... bring it on :)
---
Get like five squats before our lethargic asses need a breather.
---
But did it survive
---
I'm not even saying it's funny? It's still very obviously a joke but I guess common sense evades some people.
---
I unironically agree. Maybe Lithe on occasion.
---
Hag is easily counterable but fuck me dude, I lose to her more than huntress
---
Yup.  Things are a touch different now, but they only recorded Green Ping games so that their big spins and such landed accurately.  I mean, I understand why but when people are like "WHY ARE THESE KILLERS MISSING BUT THEY HIT ME?"  It's cause they are on sub 30 ping versus the rest of us playing whatever we can get!
---
What's the thing that people are using to find and contact survs/killers after games? It looks like a phone app
---
They have been getting better at changing things though, recently with the nurse, spirit, and insta med changes.
---
They did kinda gut BL which is kinda sad but i do think they are learning how to balance out nerfs and keep people happy
---
IF YOU'RE A KILLER YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUN RUIN
---
No, She definitely belongs in B-Tier.
---
You know considering Oni's values on family this is actually how I picture it. I mean he went on a blood curdling rampage knowing he was the reason his father's death. He didn't do it on purpose but damn it honestly showed he was more than just a monster. So knowing his great granddaughter was chopped up by her father and is now bullied by some punk kids? He might try to make it up to his family or at least what's left of it.
---
Nope. My original point was that is VERY OBVIOUSLY a joke, someone was still dense about it so I was forced to elbaroate?
---
Fan created content has NEVER been canon and the comment "implying" it was had sarcasm written all over it. I'm sorry you people lack any sort of sense.
---
If he could carry two damn traps I'd say he was perfect :(
---
Just let them chase you endlessly and get the down normally anyways lol
---
where is Rin? are you braindead?
---
i disagree but you do you man
---
I’m currently trying to become a nurse main  and oh boy prepare to lose a lot of games before getting good at her. Being able to perfect her blinks is very difficult. She may be OP but she has a huge learning curve that makes up for it. 
---
The reason she was more broken before was because she was easier to pick up with the ability to have 5 blinks so mistakes were less punished. Now with only two blinks that have a cool down you must be super accurate. She is very fun to play as and even some of my bad games survivors still tell me they were terrified the entire game. Also asshole survivors will take advantage of you if they notice you struggling. Stay positive and use each match as a form of practice. Ignore the toxic survivors. Good luck!
---
GeForce Experience settings. You press alt+z midgame, click Game Filter and change the general luminosity on the option Brightness/Contrast
---
People have given me free kills several times, even after I carried them to hatch or let them open the exit gates. Gives me some hope back for this community.
---
fucking porco dio (not for everyone)
---
No tier lists
---
Yup and I love how they will rationalize why they did it too.
---
Where would you place her? Because if it’s anything higher than B, then you truly are a meg.
---
Instead of the screech, you hear “you fucking donkey” in the distance as your teammate goes down
---
You have nice legs Lisa
---
Billy isn’t that high.
---
Is this based on how hard it is to win with that killer or how hard it is to actually use their ability?
---
I mean. It's pretty funny tho? And some survivors T-bag a bunch anyways but some say they cant complain. Ghost face is having a rave tho
---
I do the same, until you start teabagging while i'm clearly on top of you, and not attacking. Your not outrunning me, but if your gonna teabag me... then your gonna get a third hook!
---
Heh
---
LOL i was gonna place her lower
---
Spooky man.  Don't waste your time with Stength.  He's a well known troll on this sub.  He responds to get a rise out of people.  You cannot "win" talking to him.  You're just going to waste a lot of time prior to realizing this.  I'd just ignore him.  He'll tucker himself out before moving on to his next bees nest to shake around on here.
---
Good man
---
I say use plaid flannel every other game to get used to how far her blinks go just don’t rely on it. Good nurses need zero add one. Her base power is enough.
---
Demons are like onions

---
I remember that I saw a google doc somewhere with pretty much all numbers from add ons

He's getting a rework?
---
Fuck is the mlp jar?
---
its funny sure, but "some survivors T-bag" is what every GF player says after they tbag me for 3 weeks on the ground for looping them. 
---
A large amount of GF players i play against are toxic just bc some survivors are toxic, so i chose to avoid them.
---
I think the rectangle is pretty on actually, except for the Yamaoka one tho, that was just unnecessary.
---
Honestly I don’t mind dying to a pig, demogorgon or spirit because they’re all so cute

See for yourself ;)

what changes are those?

Hard to play as yeah
---
And they already said they're not going to allow Nemesis to work with Legion once it comes to live, so..Legion's only remaining build is now Spirit Fury/Enduring, everything else feels pretty useless now.
---
I think there are a lot of assholes in the bunch (mostly teenagers) but a lot of good too!
---
This is how I feel about every Legion. Esp Frank and Joey.
---
I'm no artist and by no means have any grounds to critique,  but something about the eyes looks off.
---
That being said, I love the rest of it. Really love the detail on the skin. I can practically hear him yelling "gotcha bitch." Good job!
---
Well that was disappointing. Sure it’s slightly disgusting but not much. It’s just “Sailors” in a jar with MLP figurines.
---
I DON'T HAVE MY FPS UNCAPPED, SO I THINK IT MIGHT BE ANOTHER ISSUE
---
Getting to the eye on the bottom right, that's all
---
IT QUITE OFTEN DOESN'T EVEN WORK, AND YOU FAIL TO PULL YOURSELF OFF THE HOOK
---
Yeah, it's just the same build that works on any other killer now, a lot of perks are pretty useless on legion if these changes go through, even I was thinking of maining Legion because of the speed buffs, but the fact that the perk build diversity has been gutted, I'm probably not gonna touch the killer anymore.
---
&gt; Please put more effort into your tier list and explain your rankings.
---
Oh now, killer would have to BL3  before downing you, this is so fast, no..
---
You still have access to dropped pallets and building up BL3 wastes a lot of time so it is not worth it. You main objective in chases is to waste as much killer's time as possible and only in endgame your task is to escape, so I don't actually see any problems here
---
I do always like some ghostface ❤ great job
---
Both Yamaokas accidently meeting would make for a great video short, somehow tied in with the lore (or Tome video perhaps?)
---
Imagine Kazan pacing around looking for a survivor, smashing stuff and generally making a lot of noise. He stops after hearing a faint sound, turns around and Rin suddenly comes out of a phase, lunges into the camera (Kazans pov) with a loud scream and a swipe.
---
Yeah, I just felt that I should give him a lil' handicap, longest match I had in a while that wasn't a Huntress with Iridescent Head, a Spirit proxy camping or someone farming and dying with 4 gens left.
---
Nah, still everyone would bring mori for blendetts  and dweards
---
Sucks I really like legion he’s such a cool concept
---
More like extra tracking and info gathering
---
I work in opposite of most killers. I never let babys live, it builds character. If somebody looped me for half the game and wasn't toxic, if I still win despite playing that terribly I'll always give them hatch out of pity.
---
So you're saying you have anger issues and need to learn not to break your shit over a videogame?
---
The best part about the perfect games is that you KNOW you got one based on how the match went.
---
I read both of their lores but what exactly is The Oni's relationship to Rin (The Spirit)? I know they have same last name. Is he her grandfather?
---
A few bp. Nothing too rewarding.
---

The spirit is so freaky and this just makes it freakier for me because that third eye of hers is inside a vaj
---
Better than clown and more fun too
---
He WAS a good father.
---
My wife is the same, tbh; sometimes she'll say it before I ask. 🤣
---
I'd be terrified if I loaded into a game and the first thing I hear is tap dancing hooves hitting the ground
---
Sprint Burst had always been my best friend
---
no problem!
---
Idk, if you plan out the rout or force them a certain way you could get a stack and sneak up on another person.
---
HUH. I'VE NEVER RAN IT SINCE MY ADEPT ADAM. WHAT A SHAME
---
you're right.  people who claim these "forever freddy"-tier builds are even remotely balanced (or that they don't stand a chance without) - including against good survivors - have clearly never played against such a thing.
---
My first game as Michael I got bullied so hard I stopped playing killer for about two months. They all brought flash lights and ds so I didnt get a single hook. Also in a chase two of them would follow. You can imagine the teabagging. This is why people use no ed.
---
If you get hit on the front you do a backflip (usually)
---
Holy crap. How many Iridescent Shards to you get per level?
---
What really blows is when you clense a bunch of totems and you're like "I think I did enough" and than BAM! NOED appears
---
As someone else said, wriggle points.
---
Incest.
---
Lithe with dance with me for me.
---
*ALSO* ALSO I’VE BEEN *ENTIRELY BEHIND A WALL* FOR A GOOD *WHILE* (LIKE TEN SECONDS, AT LEAST) AND I *STILL* GOT HIT BY A HATCHET WHICH SOMEHOW DIDN’T HIT THE WALL, DESPITE FLYING PARALLEL TO IT. I ENDED UP DYING BECAUSE IT REVEALED MY POSITION!
---
&gt;  ever since he berated people for trying to politely disagree with him when he claimed one survey last year proved that this sub is survivor biased. I don't know why the mods can't just ban trolls like him when he obviously comes in here to find people he can be a prick to.

Legion with sloppy was boring as hell. Good riddance.
---
You can't. The hex totems all look the same regardless of which perk they're from.
---
I am aware of that, yes.  Which he probably wouldn't have done if I had nailed the decisive strike.  But the point I was trying to make was achieving the 4% while the last person was half a second from being completely taken by the entity, thus not allowing a struggle.
---
Still, I find it kinda funny instead of disturbing or anything. Wanted to make a joke about it with DBD and an idea like this just hit me.
---
Well id say she is not horribly difficult just takes getting used to having headphones to hear better is good though if you want to play her maybe next time rank reset you can practice her at lower ranks

You don't read.......I'm not doing this with you anymore.  Scroll back far enough on the sub and you'll see them yourself.  Stop spamming me replies. I stopped talking like 6 replies ago.  If you do it again I'm just going to block you.  Move on dude.
---
You know what they say: “If it glows, it goes!”
---
I mean, now that I know it was a joke I could say its obvious. Anyone with hindsight or who already knows could say that. But judging by what comments have how many upvotes before mine, maybe it wasn't so obvious, hmm?
---
 I'm annoyed because of the gatekeeper-y BS that is "Oh wow you didn't recognize a joke made by \*insert fancontent creator here\*? You're an idiot lol". Like I said. I've heard of Samination. I haven't seen any of their videos. I don't (or didn't) know what "The Hookers" are. Does it sound like a joke? Maybe yeah, but so do most of the "canon theories" that pop up on this sub (and most fandom subs for that matter), but then they turn out to be serious.
---
But because I, and many others, don't IMMEDIATELY recognize a reference or sarcasm, that means we're lacking sense? Get outta here with that BS.
---
Urban evasion is a standard for almost all of my survivor builds mostly because it helps me avoid the killer but as long as The Killers not near me I me they're actively working on a generator or if there's a ruin I am searching for it unless I see a gen almost done/someones on it.
---
 That's how I use it I've seen a couple people who don't really try to do anything and they are the worst
---
But I already ship Kate with Susie why must you tempt me with other ships? It's not like I could ship all three...unless...
---
Also great artwork.
---
I mean yeah unlike her ancestor she literally has the power to go into another dimension for a extended period of time which very few killers can do so I’d say she is definitely more powerful power wise
---
If 4 people run object of obssesion - stealth killers should lose their undetectable because its not fair for the swf - that's what you sound like dumbass
---
I pull this off a lot with Claudette. Works every time. On the downside it's brutal when I'm the Killer up against a gang of Blendettes.
---
Or consider... julie x susie.... just kidding..... unless😳 what if all 3?
---
She’s pretty good at loops imo using her dash is pretty good at pallets and just going into stealth mode will really make the survivor panic since you won’t have a terror radius.
---
When did Ceave get here?
---
Idk about that man, even survivors benefitted from it, since usually a game would slow down by a lot and survivors would end up gaining a lot more points, especially for healing actions, and it would end up in everyone pipping by the end of it all.  
---
I think believe it or not, it was something that made everyone benefit from it, but no one cared because they wanted the match to end as fast as possible, and usually if you're the first person found by Legion, you don't even have to care, because they just stab you and move on, so it's less stress free.
---

Bro that sucks :((

Most of the ones i find are usually at the exit gates and sometimes i see them after long loops but not often really? That's pretty annoying tho :(
---
When he is mentally stable he was good.  As soon as he snapped and went psycho, I would say he wasn’t even himself anymore.  Just my take on mental breaks like that; the person is so far gone they aren’t even themselves at that point.

Well.... I just had a match with a David running UE. All he literally did was urban evade around the map once he found a key in a chest, waiting for the other players and myself to be found and killed so the hatch would spawn. I ran the killer for about 2 or 3 minutes. He didn't touch a gen, just crouched around looking. I get hooked, saved, Claudette dies, I get on a gen. He crouched past me, found the hatch, and immediately left. I'm not mad about it, more annoyed than anything. Only because this is generally what you always see with people who run UE, even in red ranks which is ridiculous. I have never personally been in a match with anyone who uses UE in a beneficial way, such as the way you do by doing gens. They always immerse themselves, don't do the objective, refuse to take aggro or a hook for a teammate, can't loop for longer than 10 secs, and tend to be the teammates you see crouched right next to the hook too scared to make a move til the terror radius is gone. I've been in too many matches where it could have been an easy win had these types of teammates just powered through ruin, took one hook to save another from death, or just done SOMETHING besides crouch in their little corner too afraid to move because the killer is chasing someone 25m in front of them. I'm sure not everyone who runs UE is like that, but again, I've never personally seen it. Doesn't make it okay that people flame you for it though. It's a perk in the game and has good use if applied well. But once you go against better killers you may find that it doesn't help you as much as it had before, and it may be a good idea to learn how to loop instead of evade. Throw on iron will, learn some basic loops, and disappear under their nose with UE so they waste time looking. In the long run, that will probably be more beneficial to you anyway.
---
Not always.
---
he's just making a joke lol
---
i love that when you get called out on an obvious lie you just act self-righteous. as you scream and tear your hair out about killer mains being overdramatic
---
f in the chat for epic weirdodin
---
Would love to see the objectives be similar to Friday the 13th. Different ways of escape that require teamwork.
---
This reminds me of ending up in some weird collage of gameplay footage back in 2016 as trapper when you could be toxic and place traps under the hook. The crotus Penn map was just released and I ended up placing several traps around the windows and basement and after catching the Youtuber and placing them in the basement all I got was on man he’s camping. I had distressing and was chasing the last survivor for the entire time the he was in the basement. It just so happened to be that there was 8 pallets in the asylum at the time. So according to some random video years ago I’m a camper. Today I’m just hook and run and hook and run. Don’t camp, but rather use a mori

Honestly toxic survivors create toxic killers which create toxic survivors. It’s a vicious cycle. I’m currently trying to get good at nurse and the buffoonery I’m experiencing is ungodly. Some survivors are super nice end game but the toxic ones I don’t even give them the satisfaction of them knowing I’m upset.
---
Playtime determens rank, skill to a much lesser extent.
---
You got to be shitting me. Are survivors not abusive enough?
---
A big one for many people is the objective time for survivors and there’s also totems which are still pretty bad overall imo. Trapper still after 3 years has to go around to pick up his traps, can still have them destroyed, and still only get 1 trap base.
---
Those are just a few killer things, I’m sure there are things on survivors side as well
---
Awesome! 
---
Good job, bro!
---
Someone complained about this exact thing during the [DBD AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/dy4ynv/ama_we_are_behaviour_interactive_the_devs_behind/f7ygfi9?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

TL;DR Connection and hitboxes are working exactly as intended. Stop complaining.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e05lqy/9_dcs_in_less_than_20_mins_the_servers_must_be/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I have seen. Too many. Asking for Oni nerfs that would trash him. It’s mostly a thing on the Forums tho, I don’t see it as much on the subreddit.
---
At least he tried to be a good dad and before his breakdown he treated her all right ~~but I agree still a bad dad~~
---
they took his fucking skin off
---
Friendship ended with balanced landing head on is my new best friend
---
Mori time!
---
It'd be nice if he could at least carry two traps or something. By the time you start picking them up and actually laying them out, you're falling behind and really need to land one or two traps just to break even
---
I really think it would shake up the game in a good way.
---
oh yea i def agree, survivors need more objectives. Idk if gen speed should be lowered or if there should just be more to do. since no one actually enjoys holding m1 to do a gen.
---
Trapper def needs a QOL change soon before they work on a buff for him
---
I saw this is morning lol
---
It takes 80 seconds to do a single gen. If your chase goes over 1.5 minutes and you’re against a semi-competent team then 3 gens will pop before you get a single hook.
---
At purple ranks, you need 12 points to pip, which means 4 gold emblems, or some iridescent ones.
---
Peak survivor entitlement
---
Bruh I just want Dark Devotion to work on him again idc about sloppy :(
---
Hoes does on lose as the spirit ?
---
Definitely, even this would be a huge improvement. Time is nearly everything in a match and every second is important and usually trapper has to go out of the way to even get an additional trap.
---
Urban and self care lmao
---
It’s not a gen grab challenge actually it’s any grab
---
I say this as a Freddy main too. All you need with Freddy is PGTW and you're good. You can be SO inventive with his builds.
---
You honestly don't need any other Gen slowing perk to get 4k. I've done it over and over. Freddy is strong by default now...
---
'Forever Freddy' is a bullshit build for lazy killers. It's extremely unfun to play against and I don't blame people for DCing against it. I wouldn't DC, because I love BPs, but I don't blame others for doing it. It's bullshit.
---
Survivors hold M1 all game on gens. The last thing they want is a killer who gets easy free hits and then has them holding M1 all game to heal too.
---
Please explain why I’m wrong and I’m a killer main it’s just doesn’t make sense to me
---
Holy crap this is great.  How long did it take?
---
Except that many people ARE that stupid on the internet. The countless ones who make those "jokes" and then defend them to the death is proof of that... hell 90% of Twitter is proof of that.
---
It's not "edgy" to assume people are being serious when in most cases it's the correct assumption on sites like this, Twitter, Facebook, etc. It's just a safe reaction based upon previous history/experience. People "reference le internet law" (god it's cringe typing that, even as quote), because it's still, and always has been, very relevant to how people operate online.
---
Getting chased for 20 minutes. Yes that was so depressing.
---
*me a Chad old Freddy main getting a 4k with noed and getting salt because they got killed by Freddy*
---
We all love this game, but 8 hours is too much. I hope you're exaggerating. Please just do something else. DBD will still be there later, it's not going anywhere.
---
New meme format incoming
---
I thought thats what they were alluding to for the End Game collapse. Like some alternate objective or way to escape at the end. Like climb over the wall by finding climbing gear, or like an access point you need to open that leads to vents under the map that act like a maze, etc. 
---
Instead its just “Now you have to 99 the exit gates or the game will slowly kick you out.” Like wow what an immense rework to the endgame! Its sad they tried to hype that up as some big thing. This game could be so much better if they at least attempted to shake it up. Instead of releasing a reworked map in their DLCs, they could try having different objectives/escape routes in their new maps and let us test it out in the PTB.
---
Pretty sure the pin addons just got nerfed, not buffed. It's going from being a hit from feral frenzy, to being after the first hit.
---
Well, recently I saw this video on pewdiepies meme review video and he said that the chef was giving it his last meal before being served which is incorrect. The chef is basically torturing it, the noises are it suffocating, it’s gasping for air. These pufferfish are actually prepared being cooked/cut open alive. Since pufferfish are toxic and not very good tasting, the only reason you would eat them is for the satisfaction of being able to say “ha I ate a pufferfish once.” It’s not funny, it’s just sad.
---
I mean devs only specified that killers are sitting in their realms in-between the trials. They have yet to explain how does it work with different killer maps in same realms
---
I GOT BACK UP AND PWNED HIM
---
The head from the late night outfit on the biker outfit
---
Event cosmetics should be given for free as many people lost these skins.
---
Endgame Collapse timer. It starts when an exit gate is opened or the hatch is closed. When its gone fully down everyone remaining in the trial is sacrificed to the Entity.
---
Nope devotion is just leveling up for more iridescent shards it’s infinite
---
*U N I O N*
---
Kate would never say hehe
---
i got a noed 4k with Bubba and it was the funniest shit 
---
Only times i 4k'd with old freddy was one match on the Game (still a great map for him) and when i slugged all 4 at mothers dwelling
---
Unless they changed something, I thought it was every survivor hit with feral frenzy who was revealed via Killer instinct gets the affliction
---
So 3 people could be broken by the time you're done, if you're lucky
---
I could be VERY wrong tho
---
this fucking texture ew !
---
Unfortunately I'm serious. I'm in a low point in life and I have no job or friends. It's all I do. I have 121 hours in DBD over the past 2 weeks which equates to 8.6 hours a day :/
---
Leaves the door open quite nicely, would be great to see killers going at each other in accidental encounters. Even if it was just confined to video shorts.
---
Cracked its skull too
---
I would love this "here comes the trapper, you better watch out for his traps" while slapping everyone off to oblivion 😂
---
The real chads are the ones trying to master the reworked nurse
---
Oni on onion
---
So glad they completely removed one of the most unique and one of my favorite killers because Fedora man bad 7 seconds.
---
Imagine complaining about people using perks
---
I remember a game I played with Freddy before his rework when Mettle wasn’t nerfed yet. Never felt so useless as a killer.
---
It's from Toy Story my guy
---
(It's November, cool it)
---
Completely forgot lol, was just thinking bout totems, gens and hooks, that’s a lot easier😂😂😂
---
He gets paid to play the game for 6+ hours a day or however long his streams are. That makes it even less impressive reaching Rank 1 on whatever side when you have thousands of hours in the game and its literally your job to play the game every day. Theres no point in putting that as a stream title like its something to be proud of.
---
I feel the same way. It’s such a cool game but for this reason is why I haven’t played in so long. While it’s immersive and fun, it gets old pretty quick. I feel like introducing different objectives would help some of the other characters or killers feel more important or usable.
---
That’s one of the few upsides why dedicated servers are better, you don’t have to suffer from lag cuz the killer was playing in Antarctica
---
Cool now i want a half naked oni with straps on his boobs and a broken sword
---
I do the same when I play Killer unless I need a daily :(
---
I do actually give a free sacrifice if I see the Killer is playing "fair" and no one is dead by the time the doors are opened. Sacrificed myself for someone trying to learn Nurse, and met a nice Legion who refused to kill me and dropped me off inside the exit gates
---
I can't cool it if it's Toy Story ,mate
---
Being a handicapped wraith wasnt that special
---
For me its the purple flashlight with the purple lens and a green battery.
---
It’s really easy to get screwed in the survival category. If you get hooked or downed even once, it’s impossible to get an iridescent quality emblem. And if you get sacrificed, the highest you can get is silver.
---
Don't forget Red Paint Brush. Combine that with Z-block and Monitor and Abuse = 0 TR in the dream world and 3 second dream transition. Run it on Lery's and you became Mirror Myers 2.0.
---
Someones gonna call you toxic for teabagging at the beginning
---
FUCK ONE MYERS IN PARTICULAR! JUST PLAYED A GAME ON THOMPSONS WHERE WE FINISHED THE HOUSE GEN LAST AND HE CAMPED THE STAIRCASE, MAKING IT SO THE THREE OF US COULDN'T LEAVE. I HAD TO D/C TO NOT WASTE MY TIME, BUT JUST AS A D/C'ED SOMEONE OPENED A DOOR SO THE TIMER STARTED. WE WERE THERE FOR LIKE 5 MINUTES.
---
I think it’s purple flashlight with green battery and either yellow battery, or a low amp filament
---
You can pause at around 0:29. It isn’t lit.
---
I’ll throw them on the ground and then they generally get the idea. If they keep struggling I’ll just drop them again and let them die or let them escape and down them again usually.
---
Nothing you do on the PTB will transfer over to the live game.
---
The trade off is you have a perk that's once per game.
---
Love love love both Hag’s Halloween cosmetics. (this year’s and last year’s) It just makes me so happy to play her. She also has another one in the rift that looks super cool. 
---
The Clown’s pumpkin face is outstanding. 
---
I thought I was indifferent to the Nurse’s but after playing against her on some dark maps she looks really really good. 
---
Last year’s Hillbilly is great but would have been better if they had added the ooze on his legs also.
---
i just wanted to make it clear :(
---
So the only exhaustion perk to work while exhausted was balanced? Hmmm
---
Animal cruelty so funneh
---
Nah, the biggest problem is that he's fucking insane and would kill/sabotage his fellow survivors
---
And that's you're fault for letting a chase go for that long
---
These posts are just as whiny and annoying AND more plentiful around here than the ones you're complaining about to begin with which adds a dash of irony to the situation.
---
Why not lithe?
---
This made me go cross eyed
---
i made this on paint and it blew up :0
---
Should go great with We're Gonna Die Alone
---
guess i'll do better work next time holy shit
---
The power of shirtless David is unprecedented.
---
Yeah then she acted like she was doing something. She could of done all 5 gens and opened both gates the whole time he was being chased. I laugh when noob3 says he’s gonna try to be immersed 😂 we all know that’s not gonna happen.
---
i always try to play the game for fun but stuff like this makes me a little disappointed. it’s okay though. i plan on staying at high purple ranks if i play enough before reset.
---
The same situation that happened to plague will probably happen to Oni. Her add ons that made her faster while holding puke got changed, her moving at 115% speed while holding puke got changed and some other fundamental flaws got changed. They will probably remove the charge time add ons and add a cooldown between Demon Dashing, maybe lower the mobility of turning while also making it not so punishing to pick up a downed survivor after using demon mode
---
You did so good! Love the style!
---
Bro I used to 4k all the time without NOED
---
spirit is invisible while phasing, they can only see your husk.
---
I love when people comment on my posted screenshots.  
---
"lol getgud, uninstall, u so bad"
---
I get maybe 6 hours of DBD in a week, and I still don't know who they are and I certainly can't believe I did anything worthy of enough anger to chase down my steam profile and leave a comment.
---
If you gonna make up lies at least make them believable. The chef gave it a carrot so it can tell the see the insides better and  remove the poison glad easier than if he didn't. Yes, people eat fish to enjoy the taste, I'm so sorry that hurts you enough to get mad at other people enjoyment
---
You are not the first a youtuber did the joke a while back but that the pic they did not do I like
---
Excuse me hiding behind a tree in shroud mode to prevent borrowed time is *not* camping. 
---
Its proxying :^)
---
They can see the corn moving 🙄
---
Nerf Oni apparently
---
His "mouth" gives Kermit's lips vibe once you slap a wig on him
---
But I thought the Wraith and Nurse were smashing uglies?
---
Because people lost their skins is why I think they should cost Iridescent Shards. At least the cosmetics will still have some worth and if the people who lost their Event cosmetics want them, they can still reobtain them for free with playtime.
---
it really is edgy to assume such a significant number of people are so stupid that you can't tell "it was in an animation a dev showed on stream so it must be canon :)" is a joke
---
Yeah that would be a good idea. Once he’s at full charge, orbs on the map dissipate. I just think if l 2/3 seconds are removed from his power or a tier system was implemented he’d be set. Like 1 tier demon strike, 2 tier demon dash. Something to slow the game a little bit. Bc from alot of ptb videos. All he needs is one injured survivor to possibly down all survivors (especially if they’re altruistic).
---
Us asking for dedicated servers was a mistake
---
I was about to say nice perfect game w/ legion,but the i took a closer look...
---
Insta Saw add ons are the only time I dislike playing against Billy
---
You guys are having normal matches?
---
I bet I'll understand this after 3 matches
---
Praise the rising spider legs
---
Darn
---
Add "teammates that can't hit Ruin skillchecks" and it basically sums up my solo survivor games.
---
Yowch
---
i'll never leave balanced landing
---
Bruh but whyyyyeeeee
---
Are dedicated servers currently enabled on live?
---
Would be fucking funny if they decided to add even more synonyms of "better than" and just put some random ass pink colors and stuff so everyone would be just so confused
---
What? What is it?
---
It's okay.  It gives me faith in players of the game, so all is well.
---
Neat
---
My favorite is to save the last guy, take him to the hatch and let em crawl to it. But close it in their face. Then let them open both gates, while in their face, then down em. If there's time left I'll put the person a random distance away from the opened gate and wish them luck.

Despite what people are saying in this conment thread, survivors almost never give free kills. Why would they? Ww get 5k bloodpoints as survivors for running away.
---
Somebody I read last year put it pretty well - no survivor is going to see that the glowing totem is out in an obvious spot and think "Y'know what? That's not fair, I'ma just power through the Ruin." So why would there be an expectation for the killer to bro out for them?
---
That guy was right, too. I have never, ever failed to destroy a totem, or run a killer silly, or hop into an open hatch. So I have no right to be upset if they put me on the hook.
---
I was and trying to get back to purple ranks (I stopped playing killer about a month after pig was released) and usually ended a chase fast enough to go back to patrolling the gens
---
Pls more i luv it.
---
... Once per game.
---
As opposed to Self care, which is useful all match. Small game, which is useful most of the match. Dark Sense. Alert. Kindred. Technician... I mean I could list all of the survivor perks that work the entire match, but okay. As a trade off from using a perk that you could use all game you get one thing at one time IF you survive that long. The balance is built in.
---
This is the most quality dbd shitpost I have ever seen
---
Hes fairly decent. Not a bad purchase
---
I agree
---
That happens to me a lot tbh... i went in game all happy with my ebony apand when i got in i was a pig with no perks at rank 1. Simply awesome, needless to say i was raped, and lost a pip
---
It's from a video where they are preparing a pufferfish to be eaten. It got turned into a "meme", for some reason. It's quite graphical (fish gets cut up a lot in the video).
---
[Here is a link to the video (NSFW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqt5_59TLgE)
---
He is quite good, he has a lot of different builds that work for him. You need to manage when to activate his Tier 3 thats an insta down, the most common strategy is to fill his bar to 99% and when you need it just activate it and 1 hit the survivor (obviously dont activate tier 3 on a injured survivor lol)
---
I’m mid ranks and at least still pip every game. Solo as well
---
I think so
---
go for it everbody has Michael and i can assure you that you will enjoy him
---
I blame the tutorial for even showing them the attempt escape button.
---
I wasn't expecting this. Goddammit.
---
&gt;Urban evasion is a standard for almost all of my survivor builds
---
Same. I love Urban Evasion. It was the first perk I fell in love with when I started playing. I just hate when survivors use it and don't do gens. It's not every match, but I see it often.
---
Ahh dbd. The game were ques are so long you can learn a new language
---
It bullshit thou
---
But thats the thing he was a generic m1 killer but with a handicap you had to play around. Now instead of having 0 powers he has 3, snares, pallets and teleporting. if legion ever gets reworked im sure people will get nostalgic about his trash ass too
---
New killer: GiantDad
---
Perks:
---
**Filthy Casuals**- Your superiority in battle fuels your power. After hooking a survivor, you receive the Haste status effect for 10/20/30 seconds.
---
**Well, What is it?**- Puny survivors are no match for you. You gain the ability to taunt survivors. Taunted survivors shake in their boots and bow to your power.
---
**Dex is Cancer**- Dex is cancer and all Dex builds must be destroyed!! Any survivor who gains the haste status effect is also exposed for 10/20/30 seconds.
---
Power:
---
**Fire the Bass Cannon**- Hooking survivors fills you with power. When your power meter is full, you gain the ability to down the next survivor with 1 hit.
---
It fucking pisses me off when the players who do nothing all game end up thinking or behaving that they some work to help out, or behave in a way which shows that they see themselves as a good player. 
---
One game I had against this really good Buuba, I literally did 3 of the gens on my own, unhooked teammates 3 times, sacrificed myself to let 3 of my teammates out of the map (I didn't need to escape to pip) and after some chat with the killer after them, telling him that he was good and gg, (ps4 messaging by the way) he told me that one my teammates from last game did nothing all game and were calling him trash and saying "EZ."
---
That would explain why it took a lot of time to do gens.
---
This is the first time I've encountered this in almost a year of playing. Just a random glitch I assume?
---
MY BUILD VS. *insert random youtuber*
---
I’ll get in on this. GT: i liKe ch33z84
---
Isn't it wonderful how the devs specifically designed a killer to slug? Encouraging toxic behavior through game design.
---
My controversial opinion is that I hate going up against killers that catch-and-release, farm, or just generally baby us. You generally only see this happen in low rank games, sometimes a whole bunch of times in one evening, and it usually results in the survivors each getting 2 pips.
---
So what you get is a bunch of people in the wrong rank with a weird idea of how nice the killer is going to be. Which is nice for the killer, who gets an easy 4k and can just ignore the post-game salt, but is awful for any survivor who gets hooked and has to watch all three other survivors fully immerse on opposite corners of the map.
---
Ok, I was about to go on a rant about why would people want to fuck something that kills people and then I was remembered that Gore porn exist so ya, I guess you point stands.( But really don't look up Gore porn it's fucked up)
---
What about bloody dead‘ard?
---
I love the crow with all my heart. They could make it where the entitiy tricks him into thinking the survivors killed him and his girlfriend or somethin like that
---
It does too much for 1 perk, that can happen for 4 people. 
---
I have argued this many, many times. Perk is super strong and does too much. Downvotes incoming and I don't care.
---
Oh hey good boy
---
bill on his way to get that sweet sweet christmas sweater
---
Ayy! It's you again! Yet another lovely work of art.
---
The new effect isn't on Switch yet. PTB is PC only.
---
does this make him a clownfish
---
I'm sorry, but if someone queues up with 300 or 400 ping, I'm going to find a different game. That game won't be fun for either of us.
---
You don't care to have a dialog about it? You've just made up your mind and you're going to stick with it regardless of what other people present?
---
Ok, Killer.
---
HAHA
---
I mean, you can. Check the nearest generator to see if Ruin is up.
---
But doesn't matter, if it glows it goes!
---
Hag is pretty viable too since they bugged her. Not those three, but she can hold her own. You don’t see her often, though
---
Wow, I guess I might be able to understand the huntresses iridescent heads but most of these are very unwitting. Alot of them can be countered, I personally think freddy is absolutely fine where he is mostly because I feel hes supposed to be more powerful. The engravings are already pretty balanced.
---
How did you send that message, twitter?
---
Fuck you for posting animal abuse you cock sucker
---
Play Clown for an hour and your depressive episode will be so long you'll learn every language in the world
---
They could have easily untrapped both at the same time.
---
&gt;!Or they could have ran in the basement and wasted time!&lt;
---
Just 99 your health and self care the rest of the way to be sure
---
Thats actually realism. Since you can’t see the status of other survivors and generators will randomly blow up since your character isn’t a mechanic
---
Im one of the few people who enjoy clown so ill be ok :D
---
Bro, david is fucking **ripped**
---
bonk
---
Hello :)
---
Simple answer: nein
---
Music build will power, which neans more time wasted torturing instead of feeding
---
Dont forget premonition lmao
---
xD I’m on PS4
---
They could call this killer the Stalker, and she could also have the ability to turn invisible for short periods. I feel like this would make for a very successful game.
---
The farm maps have a lack of jungle gyms to begin with - some of them have vast spaces (corn) where a survivor shouldn't run because it's a free hit or down. Some of the farm maps have decent jungle gyms around the perimeter, but most of them aren't very strong.
---
Even though I know it's a stronger loop, I've never chased someone to cow tree and been like "ugh, not this place". My suggestion would be to try to force the survivor in the weak direction around the cow tree loop. This can make them drop the pallet early, or leave the loop entirely. If you find yourself spending too much time there, let the survivor go and apply pressure somewhere else.
---
Guaranteed you and your friends werent the first to make that joke
---
Its a big locker with lil baby locker. Someone was mean to baby locker :( mumma locker is angry now.
---
My reaction when all survivors DC during a game in the PTB
---
The power slot used to not be grayed out &amp; you could select it like they were considering multiple playstyles, Freddy would be prime for testing to satisfy the 200iq masochistic gods that use to kill it with old freddy
---
A gun that works like Rust's Eoka Pistol could be a good idea.
---
A slow and unreliable gun with not much range that won't always fire when triggered and sometimes can take multiple trigger pulls to shoot.
---
He's an ancient ancestor of Rin so like a great great great great great(maybe etc.) Grandfather of hers
---
Yeeeah...i know...
---
Shes a keeper
---
Because we will go in a circle and argue about it. I can't be arsed.
---
Don't wanna show off, but I completed all the challenges 2 days ago  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Disable comments.
---
It makes you feel good.
---
From my experience, survivors tend to be more toxic than killers in both quantity and harshness. It’s a common quality among high-ranking survivor mains. That guy was clearly just a toxic, hypocritical asshole. Ignore him.
---
Never see nurses anymore lol
---
go for that tag like its on the bloodweb- in a straight line. all you need to do is reach it to complete.
---
They did say in their AMA that they are gonna try to improve solo play
---
Hillbilly is the DEFINITION of a balanced killer in this game.
---
Insta saw gone, sure. Anything else is fine.
---
I enjoy Thiccc Boi as well but I seriously gotta say he's underwhelming sometimes
---
Honestly I don't know if Rin knows anything about Kazan, if his horrid legacy was talked about through the generations or not, but I get a striking feeling that Rin wouldn't like him too much
---
how bout no
---
Oni is clearly running a quality build.
---
Doesnt help when you get the 4 man swf that are toxic af
---
That's something at least. I'll go check it out again to see exactly what they said.
---
Again, if you truly think that there aren't massive amounts of "mouth breathing idiots" on the internet, then you're simply naive of the internet. It's not arrogant to say "There's a lot of dumb people saying dumb things on Twitter" it's simply true. Regardless of what your standpoint is on any given topic, it's going to continue to be the case.
---
Arrogance would be saying that people who don't immediately recognize sarcasm in text are stupid or have less sense. Arrogant is seeing 100+ people upvote a comment that didn't notice the sarcasm (implying they also didn't notice the sarcasm when they upvoted) and then acting like you're smarter than them because you happened to recognize the sarcasm... even though there's absolutely no way any one person has NEVER been fooled by sarcasm before. That's arrogance.
---
I mean theres not much explaining to do, at minimum they can just say that the entity yoinks the killer out for the trial, or has multiple instances.
---
It mostly just comes down to preference. Usually purple flashlight, green battery, and whatever second addon feels comfortable to get consistent blinds.
---
Well in my eyes he is the one and only Freddy. I’m sad they used the 2010 Freddy in DBD. 
---
And thank you :)
---
Correct
---
Imagine if survivors also had some kind of OP "healing bullet" in their gun too that they can instantly revive downed teammates with roght in front of the ~~hunter~~ killer. Hmmmmmmm.
---
Not enough salt
---
that's a lot of words to say "i couldn't tell someone was making an obvious joke but OTHER people are the stupid ones"
---
I don't believe that. 
---
They need some improvement for sure. But in a year or so we will hopefully have a consistent experience for both sides. What we're experiencing now is growing pains.
---
Yeah maybe they are a little too big :p
---
Why is dbd mixing well with so many other subs? Because I absolutely love this type of content! I need more! Also oni is a quality build, he has the chaos blade, great club build down to a tee.
---
u/joaoestoraxota
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
dbdgonewild is leaking.
---
Thanks, i hate it
---
The difference is actually creating a new joke in the meme. This is the exact same punchline over and over with a lackluster first panel. The fact that the two dlc’s are related don’t outweigh the fact that it is the exact same joke as opposed to a slightly evolved form of the joke that’s actually humorous. It is a repost in a lot of people’s eyes because it’s the exact same joke and the fact the two killers are related hold almost no weight in anything that matters. 
---
Also a meme’s template doesn’t have to be replicated to become a meme that would just make it be sub-categorized as a popular meme template. I do like popular memes but they need some sort of creativity or effort put forth to make it their own. 
---
TLDR: such low effort equals repost
---
Pretty gay of you to call that gay.
---
What's changed about balance landing? This is news to me
---
And We Get A Biker Meg :D
---
Thanks ! This took me about 5-7 hours I think
---
I was blown away when I first saw the Oni so I’m thinking he will be next :) 
---
And although I have never played the Doctor nor do I like playing against him, I think he would also be fun to draw
---
Comments like these make me wish developers never come to forums for ideas
---
Nah, get the uncut rounds with Ohmwrecker. He's not great at the game but he's very wholesome
---
Those tier 3 snowballs are rough
---
Head on. Apply directly to the killer.
---
B L I N K
---
Devour, Third Seal, and TOTH all say hello :)
---
That’s your own fault for continuing to chase that survivor around a infinite loop, just break off the chase and find someone else. 
---
Plus pig tree isn’t that big of a deal, some people can loop it good and some don’t, either way I don’t waste much time there and move on, you guys need to quick crying and bitching about every stupid little thing that you want removed from the game! It’s a game and some are meant to be hard.
---
Plus with BhVR Interactive we are never going to get a Hardcore Mode and A Snowflake Pussy Mode for gameplay, and if shit keeps getting nerfed or yanked out then people will stop playing and also the game becomes unfun and way to easy. 
---
Look at Fortnite...
---
I dont know the rest of the World but in my zone the survivors queues are insane nobody wants to play killer
---
And with that you confirm you can't even see what I'm saying. Be on your way, naive internet child. (That was intentionally edgy on my part just so you know, since you seem to need it spelled out to you).
---
i imagine feng carrying a david and now i feel inspired to draw lol
---
🔪 vibe check
---
Oink
---
There should be a comma between "rage" and "making".
---
you were already being edgy, i don't see the difference bro
---
You do know that its not just based on the killer's internet right?
---
r/commentredirectsididntaskfor
---
Kkkkk, parece vc comendo minha rola haha
---
Lmao killer controls the chase, just chase around it clockwise so they don’t get a fast vault
---
No stun reduction when exhausted
---
Needs to be large, in the middle of the screen, with explosions and confetti that everyone around you can see and hear.
---
cow tree is fine. just run it in the right direction and it loses a lot of oomp. however, it's possible for tiles to spawn next to it that, when chained, are absurdly strong no matter which way you run and that can be an issue when it happens. I think it's only a Thompson House problem, though
---
Urban and self care are two perks considered used only by players that waste time. Self care takes around 30 secs or 40 with sloppy but her, which would mean half a gen done. Premonition is just underpowered. Better use spine chill.
---
seriously? ur using that clip? what the fuck... i rly hope the mods remove this. i dont wanna see animals being harmed here
---
**WHERES THE FOKIN MEWS SAUCE?!**
---
you can't mind game cow tree. you just have to run it in the right direction
---
People cant see the bigger picture of how his weakness would just keep getting worse the more people countered the evolving meta of how to make him not trash
---
Yeah, because the game wont even fucking load.
---
This is me for sure haha
---
No
---
I don’t think I’ve ever had a killer take up my offer for a free kill. If a game starts and everyone D/C because it is a killer no one wants to play against, I always tried to offer myself to quickly move onto the next game (back when you needed to complete 2 gens for hatch to spawn for the last survivor). Literally every killer would tell me to do the last couple of gens, give me a couple of pallet stubs before letting me leave. 
---
Like as a dude that enjoys plays survivor and Doctor, it is really frustrating when everyone leaves a match because it just ruins it for everyone. But just being a bit empathetic and saying “sorry about that. I hope your next game is better” does goes a long way to making it a bit better.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e073oe/new_killer_when/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
This is pretty much the exact opposite of the way to think about this, you shouldn’t be saying “you may have to start dealing with harassment” 
---
You should be thinking “the community should learn not to be stupid pieces of shit”
---
haha, I had a guy try to report me for that.  Last 2 survivors and I could only find one.  Jackass was hiding in lockers the whole time.  The other player helped me find him and I tunneled lockerboy.  10/10 would do it again.
---
Only if killers get a perk to carry multiple survivors simultaneously in a big pile on their shoulders.
---
lol i just had an argument with a bunch of survivor mains telling me that no survivors ever ask for dumb killer nerfs and that, actually, killers always cry to nerf survivors. So thanks for more evidence that they are delusional
---
fuck that guy. trans rights!
---
Well if the game boots me because of bhvrs shitty coding it better not give me a penalty! I got kicked from 2 games last night, first one with a error message and the second was kicked back to main load in screen with no message. 
---
If BhVR starts handing out penalty’s for a game that’s poorly coded and they know this and wanna punish people unfairly then this game is done. I know they need to do something since we all have been wanting DC punished, but they stated many times that they would need dedicated servers in order to do that! 
---
So they better have it figured out or I’m making a trip to my attorneys office...
---
fuck, when I'm getting screwed and it's the end of the game I just walk out into the middle of the map and stop.  What's the point of chasing to the exit gates to see the inevitable teabagging?
---
ping is the connection strength between the killer and the survivors. it can be bad for a number of reasons.
---
this survivor main meme that always just the killer's internet has gotten out of hand
---
Holy shit. Thats crazy especially with infin t3
---
i usually wouldnt call myself sensitive but seeing them choke the fish with that carrot and it making sounds and them killing it is making me sob. literally fuck OP for using this clip. its not funny. animals being harmed is not funny.
---
They could make the black powder pistol inflict a hindering status effect but then it'd be very similar to the clown.
---
Please do on the oni, I know he isn't out on console yet but I know he is an insta main from playstyle alone
---
I think it's my favourite perk tbh, that and Iron will
---
Micheal is bestest murdererer at gaem. He can one slap and conselors thinks: how can he one slap? Also better skin pantyless Mayers pyjama. Smh.
---
dont wait to use it, it will give more use to make distance from unsafe generators imo
---
What are you playing on?
---
It was not me last night but I am a very Friendly Ghostface. I usually let the last have hatch or finish gen if we have a early DC or I over powered the survivors.  I know the solo survivor struggle and as long as everyone was cool it's almost guarantee I'll let last one go. I think it's because we can all t bag meme that reminds me not to take the game seriously.  I made a few post about me being a sucker for giving the hatch. It warms my hear when someone does it for me. I think 2k is a win, 3k is I did great . 4k is wow that team pissed me off! Funny thing is I'm so compelled to give hatch as GF. I run on PS4 his classic costume with NC,Ruin,DL, BBQ. Was a pig main but I like playing spooky and do get a kick out of grabs. You are correct about GF on PS4 being cool. I seen a couple this month. Lastly. Remember to not wiggle at the end. Killers appreciate it and makes them think about driving you to hatch.
---
As a Legion main, this and the upcoming chapter makes me really happy
---
I can't tell if this is serious or not. Shitpost with some nonsense that doesn't seem to aim to be funny is rather confusing.
---
PS4.
---
Salty killer mains... Shame.
---
Why  an Alex’s tho?
---
Yeah but can it break a loop
---
Bamn.... Also No!
---
My friends and I have been talking about trying 'sandbag with friends,' the goal of which is to take a four stack SWF in, give the killer a 3k, and be the escaping survivor.
---
WHY THE FUCK ISN'T THE TRAILER PINNED IN THE SUB? COME ON MODS
---
He*
---
"no u"
---
oof ouch you got me
---
If the killer runs it the right way you can't get a fast vault, making the loop far less useful than if it was ran the other way.
---
Notice how claudette was fidgeting when she stopped sprinting? that was me trying to turn backwards but I couldn’t turn around
---
probably the cringiest thing i’ve seen all week
---
Thanks for sharing. Lol
---
Oh I agree, you can't tell if it IS Ruin. But you can tell if Ruin is up very easily, and therefore even more reason to cleanse.
---
Someone obviously doesn’t understand how this game works...
---
You can just say Monto. It’s okay he won’t hurt you. Maybe only just a little bit.
---
Ok but, why?
---
It's the internet man, your warning is about five years too late
---
Needs more Dead Hard activating but still getting downed anyway.
---
I feel like it's not that bad as long as you push the survivors the right way around, however there can be some dirty as fuck spawns with a jungle gym window right next to it that can be an actual nightmare to deal with.
---
They are within the 6 ranks of you or whatever it is. It sucks but that is how it works out sometimes and matches you with the closest available.
---
You're right about that tótem thing, I never let one go
---
[She](https://deathgarden.gamepedia.com/The_Stalker)
---
The joke is that "Dead by Daylight, but with guns" is basically the concept behind Deathgarden.
---
Giant Dad would poise through Oni’s mace and down him with his chaos 2-hander
---
Nvidia brightness settings and stretched 4:3 (but you see it as a regular 4:3 as a video)
---
Not really the most cinematic experience but i want to feel comfortable while playing, and the default fov and brightness of this game suck, imo
---
Or what's fun is playing Killer and making hits on windows that still count as hits even though I know I shouldn't be able to land that hit.
---
Im sorry that my joy in two characters is cringe for u :( whatever will I do
---
Automatically whatever that person says is hot garbage. Fuck them and their small minded bullshit.
---
Yeah, that's a garbage game.
---
His documents in the archives hint at him being much more evil than we first thought
---
Yeah sorry about that, I shouldnt be making memes with a fever, my head doesnt work properly
---
This. Every time you think about doing something good for the other side, take a moment to think about whether or not they'd do it for you. A good 99% of the time they wouldn't, so don't.
---
When will he get the bar for his saw that says The Saw is Family!
---
It reflects how survivor mains feel about killers they judge OP.
---
Ah lmao fair enough
---
He can semi click and break pallets instantly with very little recovery. Pretty awful counter play when the counter play is to ruin an entire side of the map before going down.
---
If they figure out what you're doing and want to play along, they might crouch-spam as an attempt to be friendly.  Keep in mind that between survivors, crouch-spamming often means "Hi" or "Thanks for the heal."  
---
Or they could just be teabagging jerks.  That's always possible.
---
I agree, but they do feel that way. Even in red ranks.
---
A character in dead by daylight having an lgbt charm won’t really help at all tho
---
Had a game like this yesterday. Was playing the huntress and got the survivors down to two left. One was a feng that was playing really well and had been looping me. The other was a dwight I had hooked early on and not seen since. I hook the feng for her first time and leave her to look for hatch. I look all around the map, until I get closs to killer shack and hear a crow sound. Look inside and there was Dwight and the hatch. He runs away and ends up saving the Feng from her death hook since she was struggling already. I downed deught, hooked him and walked the Feng over to the hatch. She deserved it more than him. He said he reported us at the end of the game lol.
---
That's crazy awesome. I wonder why it is he can do that. I mean, he's Michael. So there is that, but would the moris not also count as manipulating the realms then?
---
Agreed with insta saw and iri heads but the rest?!
---
Mori rework is way more urgent...
---
One of His perks is just to send the killer flying via log ram. I do think that would be sweet and cool, whether or not the predator comes with him.
---
10x more BP per game, 10x longer queue per match found
---
I don't really hate the idea, but the warrant for it isn't really there. Also what's up with only killers getting a penalty? Why not survivors too. If they're entitled to special convienience why would the killer either?
---
Piss your pants maybe?
---
Skillcheck musta used dead hard
---
Moris are allowed by the entity as a kind of reward

how could this possibly be one of the strongest perks?
---
People get mad for everything.
---
I had a Pig game today, found all 4 survivors on one gen the exact second it pops, and blindly chase the nearest person, a weird mix of Blendette and neonpink jacked. After a hit she clicked her Flashlight at a pallet trying to stun me, but i somehow hit her before the stun. She DC´ed instantly.
---
She waited the entire game to insult me about being an asshole for "tunneling" her just because she had a Flashlight. Just for context, the entire team had Flashlights, i even had Lightborn equipped because of that.
---
Idk bro that’s sounds to op *how about we just remove the pig?*
---
People in this community really are something else I suppose.
---
Shrek confirmed next killer?
---
Iron will and Urban Evasion have saved my ass countless times. I absolutely love that combo.
---
Lesbeans
---
im not wearing any
---
When I play survivor, I give myself as a kill in one of two situations. 1. The killer let us farm BPs. 2. I bullied the killer so much that I felt bad and wanted to give them a kill.  
---
As a killer, I have only received #1. I guess in high rank lobbies, survivors don't care if they utterly destroy a killer.
---
Nice joke buddy
---
Always creepin and sneakin
---
Dont say dud eww I just said it help I dont want to be ochido fanboy loser he which hunts and uses
---
Yeah, if you are down to one gen, the killer is likely to camp because its their best chance to salvage the game.
---
why would this be good on any of them?
---
LMAO theres a DBD version of r/okbuddyretard.
---
Throw a Blendette in there and its the perfect combo
---
&gt;  or deal with the issue of being slow after a teammate is hooked basically making the chase 10 seconds long
---
what? what are you talking about?
---
The god damn Vikings win all the damn time.
---
don’t forget Dead
---
Yes. And the Pink Key should open the hatch after the second gen being done.
---
IT GON BE ALRIGHT
---
how does it make chases any easier to end? and how does it synergize with sloppy for pressure?
---
You got no kills but 50k bp with an annoying build, they stuck out doctor w/ distressing&amp;unnerving (ew) and got an escape. What the problem?
---
It’s programmed as this: WITH the perk Self-Care equipped, heal yourself.
---
So you can actually run any other good healing perk like IS or Second Wind, and it will count. Med-Kits work too.
---

It’s for crossplay between the windows store and steam, not consoles and such.

Me as well
---
Yes oni.
---
*looks at legion*
---
Playing "fair" is not killing any survivor till after doors open? Edgymeme indeed. 
---
Nah I definitely get it. If I am absolutely steam rolling a group after rank reset, I let them farm it up.  Otherwise, prepare to get hooked and killed.
---
Ohhhh! Well that sucks but thank you!
---
No comrade, the only fun left is pain.
---
You see, survivors are skin deep only, so they got perk called "No mither" which is "hard mode" for survivor.
---
Killers have a killer Called "The legion" which is "battletoads mode"
---
It’s strong but as someone ho dealt with pre-nerf cow tree I’m not that fussed about it.
---
I think they’ll keep it exclusive to anyone that owned the game, but who knows
---
Ohhh okay! Thanks!!
---
In fact, hiding in a locker is a way some survivors avoid being shocked, and you also don't tier up from the static field while you're in there. Shock is the quickest way to get madness up - just using the passive field is slower.
---
I was almost ALMOST that guy who cleansed an HG totem, then I paused and went, "wait... newish looking spirit... no ruin... no reason to think its devour hope.... let's not cleanse." And i felt so proud of myself. Only for a baby dwight to run up and cleanse it ten seconds later. And it was Haunted grounds.

Does whatever thanos hag does🎼
---
I agree with this. It all comes down to scratch mark jukes. I run dance with me, lithe, iron will, and quick and quiet every match. Works against all killers. Spirit was only strong due to her addons. With the upcoming nerf she will be much more balanced
---
If you mean why me being trans means I'm trash, I have no clue
---
I had honestly assumed that the amount rewarded was so small it was unnoticed by me.
---
Why should we be forced to run a certain perk to counter a killer? The discussion is based around the mind games with spirit. You're just constantly guessing, thats not a mindgame.
---
The Wraith killed because his sanity snapped. He realized what he had done and his mind went poof. He snapped and murdered his boss.
---
Eric Draven, I’m assuming you mean the movie incarnation, did not mentally snap. He was still there, he chose to get revenge for Shelly’s death. This is not nearly the same as Philip literally losing his mind and then committing murder. 
---
Eric, the book version, demonstrates much more physiological trauma so *maybe* that word work better? But Brandon Lee’s Eric would not work at all and doesn’t fit the example you’re providing.
---
I'm kinda surprised by this I usually find games faster in deathgarden then I do in dbd.
---
a p p r o v e d
---
Lol I mean I use them perks all the time and I'm a rank 8. I could careless what the "best" perks are. For me these are what I like to use. I don't waste time. If I get hit. I run away use self care. Urban to leave a gen faster if my premonition goes off so I  dont leave scratch marks while running. We'll make it to get them quick heals.
---
I miss little things like that. I mostly get angry people. :(
---
That ain't lit.
---
le killer has arrived
---
Not exactly. We knew there were no plans for cross progression, so I was hoping they’d at least know *which account* I could level, should they ever pursue cross save later.
---
If I have plans to build a wood table I know I’m going to need a hammer.
---
Oops.
---
She sounds mean lol, my girlfriend loves when I give hatch to baby megs, says it's cute.
---
Spirit AND you are guessing. It's quite literally a 2 way mindgame, a game played in the mind, the only actual one in the game.
---
Well, it is still in closed beta. DbD had infinites and Self-Care going faster than hit cooldown back in its youth. I hope it picks things up by launch.
---
It's almost identical to DbD! Identity V uses the exact same formula, but has more creative/diverse "Killer" and Survivor abilities and attributes, uses a skill tree instead of perks, and has a few QoL improvements, although it's still got infinites for some Hunters, and Survivors are generally even stronger. It's interesting to compare.
---
Thank you sir. Find her playing dbd btw. There's hope.
---
90 percent of the time a killer not having Ruin is ggez
---
Yep.
---
don’t do that
---
She likes winning. I tried to explain that winning in dbd is pretty subjective but she wouldn’t have it.
---
don’t give me hope
---
Idk if you consider this pity but the entity tricked Rin’s father to kill a lot to allow it to move him into the entities realm but saw Rin’s desire for revenge and decided to use Rin as a killer
---
and then i literally said after he should be able to gain his power quicker and just over all be more efficient with it. I presented a nerf and a buff but ok. 
---
Im not gonna respond to this since you have been on this post for like 3 hours and you are obi just fishing for shit
---
Love these claims. BHVR has data pointing to her being overpowered and top streamers agree she's OP but there's apparently a small group of players that are just wrecking Spirits left and right.
---
We’ll  never know until shirtless clown releases ;)
---
are we really at the point where survivor mains pretend that's some super strong build?
---
Well, yeah. Plus, there's not much room to display hereditary characteristics, such as similar voicelines or poses.
---
Like green or yellow legion add ons, they say considerably and moderatly but decrease your cooldown by 0.2s or 0.4s iirc lol
---
I love that!!!
---
The only time I can see sabotaging hooks as useful
---
Indirect Mad Grit buff.
---
lol you *mildly* walked it back after being called out for how dumb that is.
---
you got exposed
---
ggez, punk
---
Yeah, dont know why theyre getting angry at OP when he most likely didn't know. Sensitive as hell.
---
Wait... I am ps4. So the quick jerk to the left and disappear is not a normal thing?? I always thought that survivor is just v skillful
---
No, ancient ancestor.
---
I wouldn't say that crouching counters the spirit tho. When I play her, I focus a lot more on breathing sounds and moving grass and only use the marks as a rough indicator where the survivor is.
---
Funny meme tho lol.
---
“Shush! I’m working on the gen, go die somewhere else meg! You’ll comeback in the next trial”
---
Yeah Im just guessing they needed to find something to be mad at you for? Idk.

**We´re Gonna Die Alone**

Being alone heightens your morale.

For each Survivor hooked, gain an additional **100 %** speed increase to healing up yourself for **30**/**60**/**90** seconds.

Cumulative Healing Speed bonuses cannot exceed **100 %**.

Yeah. Frame rate on console makes a big difference when you're getting spun and the such.

---
The reason why there is a PTB to begin with, BhVR will correct some issues before release and if a killer is to strong in some areas will make adjustments. 
---
I think I’m giving BhVR to much credit...
---
What are you on about? I said annoying,  because that is an annoying build esp on doctor
---
Much like Survival score, you either did everything properly or you failed and got nothing.
---
Murdering your family is a first hook death.
---
spirit has essentially no counterplay
---
I am pretty sure that if you were driven mad by an ancient entity that literally fed on suffering and had accumulated such power that they could drag beings of incredible power (like Freddy) between worlds with ease because it was literally pouring insanity and suffering into you in such extreme quantities in an attempt to break you into a killer like it has so many before.
---
That you might snap and tear apart a family member, remember that study where people thought they were electrocuting test subjects to death because of sheer social/peer pressure? People have done worse things after being driven insane and to the end of their ability to cope by torturers with far less hypothetical experience than the Entity itself.
---
Really??? Wow Sony won’t even respond to that! But Microsoft is run by a bunch of snowflakes who think everyone needs a safe space.
---
Sony is run by the Chinese who don’t give two fucks and have their own mobile suicide vans running around for people who can’t handle it anymore...
---
What the fuck why is this so bright.
---
😂
---
BHVR and top streamers are both complete trash at dead by daylight and have no idea how the game works. Cote mains hag and uses 75 combined IQ across maybe an entire season. Tru3 thinks soloQ survivors using meme perks are minmaxed SWF. Scott and ohtofu are MAYBE the only good players. 
---
Here's Scott's "Argument," 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZyG29POXJw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZyG29POXJw) 
---
He states that Spirit is annoying to play against because guessing against the killer somehow isn't gameplay but rangemaxing and looping automatic win scenarios are somehow amazing high skill players.
---
good to know!! thank you, friend!! see you in the fog 😁
---
Nice!!!!!
---
Bring back Old Freddy's kit next free DLC! Just...you know, also better.
---
Because top streamers have extensive and verifiable proof of their skill in DBD unlike people who post on Reddit.
---
This doesn't mean their opinions are invalid, but they aren't concrete data like VODs are.
---
"why should we be forced to run a certain perk to counter a killer?" you realise that killers are forced to run the same perks over and over to have chance at a fair game every match right? Now it's of course possible to perk up however you want but saying it's unfair for a survivor to pick a "must have" perk against a killer means nothing in comparison to the other side of that coin.
---
&gt; It's quite literally a 2 way mindgame
---
No it isn't. The Spirit has information to act on whereas the survivor does not
---
Well this video is a terrible example as it's pretty clear there's a huge lag spike between you and the server.  
---
There are times where "you" get hit after vaulting a window or a pallet and it looks like you shouldn't on your screen.     
---
 
---
It seems most of the most vocal complainers about it, though, are the people who like to bully killers and now it's harder to bully them because you don't have quite as consistent experience.  
---
There's definitely some improvement that can be made, though it'll likely require rewriting most of their network code.  In most other online games this type of thing isn't as noticeable because it's a two-way street.  You're trying to kill them and they're trying to kill you and melee is usually a tertiary option for hurting someone.  This game brings together all of the least-favorable scenarios for exposing lag problems and that makes glaringly obvious when things go wrong.
---
relax bud hes only eating carrot.
---
It's annoying, not strong.
---
Purple + Long life batter &amp; Low amp Filiment. 100% nothing better.
---
Honestly depends on the rest of the team and general gameplay. Did you unhook your fellow survivors more then you should have? Have the hatch! Did they leave you on hook till phase 2 when I was across the map? Have the hatch! Do something cute or Ballsy? You get hatch.
---
its not minimal animal abuse. you might not care about it because a fish isnt as intelligent as a human or as adorable as a cat, but fish are actual creatures. im not even vegan, but hearing the sound of a fish getting fucking choked is saddening and i cant fathom how you guys can find that sound funny.
---
New Survivor: Isaac?
---
Honestly, just remove the penalty for attempting to escape and reduce the base chance. Babies will STILL have it be a liability because they'll Kobe right in front of Killers and get knocked into Phase 2, and Luck stat will get to matter.
---
Not anymore, you get punished for DC if your on PC and not sure about console when the patch drops...
---
Are we talking about the movie or something you came up with. 
---
Either way with a name like that I would think of this grotesque being that collects body parts to attach to his limbs or someone that replaces limbs he has to look more magnificent. 
---
Someone who collects body parts and not really gadgets and pieces. Someone who used to be in the medical field and work on patients for face lifts breast augments etc. 
---
Someone who feels ugly to the point where they kill there patients to feel pretty someone whose lonely and wants to find someone. 
---
So many scars are on him that you can’t even tell who he is anymore. 
---
Each cosmetic could be a different body part that  he sows onto himself.
---
That is a killer I would love to see. A optional but free cosmetic would be a backpack on him with different body parts like legs, faces, arms etc.
---
It has been known the devs aren't the greates tat the game but if you're going to downplay the skill of people who have actual proof that they consistently hang and dominate in red ranks then I hope you have as much footage to showcase your gameplay.
---
Well, the devs are starting to take a new “no more exclusives” stance. All of the con-exclusive cosmetics are also being released for free, and some of those never came to consoles, despite being released well after DbD launcher on consoles.
---
She's hard, but still the only Killer who can just go through walls, so she's unique.
---
its not eating the carrot... they're using the carrot to choke it
---
i dont even remember. Pallet count increase, mettle which was overdone, there was another way that was pretty clearcut, but it'd be two since MoM was removed.
---
Is a good meme
---
Yeah my mom says “you’re supposed to kill them? Why are you letting them leave?” The bloodlust is real
---
&gt; skill
---
this isn't a hard game and a lot of shit that happens falls to luck. streamers are just entertainers
---
Y r her tits blushing tho?
---
Power countered by crouching.... yea....sure....
---
They did?
---
Meant to be a lazy highlight on the clothes but u know.... when u see a hot gal..... sometimes things go crazy
---
Sounds like kollector form mk11 but more dark Good idea!
---
That doesn’t even bother me, the only thing that bothers me is that skin.
---
Ya could run Monitor and Abuse combined with discordance to setup some pressure with a sneakier approach into a double stab.
---
At least legion is good at safety pip’ing and bloodpoint farming.
---
I don't get why people should be nice to the last survivor. Like, kill that bitch, this is a game. These type of "norms" made for killers, makes the whole community assume that everyone should do it, and if a killer doesn't allow last survivor hatch, then it would cause everyone to start talking shit about the killer. There are literally other stupid reasons that survivors provide when talking shit to killers, this should not be another one.
---
Lovely, thank you, I really appreciate your work!
---
I agree that this game isn't hard but that's besides the point.
---
Streamers are entertainers and I don't see how that robs them of skill? If you're consistently lucky, chances are you're skilled. I wouldn't call Lebron James a lucky player.
---
What pisses me off is I had a 200 buck game router along with a range extender 2 weeks before the dedicated servers and my experience was amazing for the whole 2 weeks, I can actually 360 even with a lag switcher, then these potheads dedicated servers come out and im the shack distance away from the killer and still get hit
---
This sub has the best quality shitposts
---
Played with him a couple of times he is super wholesome and humble
---
Pug: *Plays a capable killer he doesn’t demolish in 1/5 games* OH I didn’t know I was playing someone so sweaty, what a sweaty Freddy, he needs to chill. 
---
Pug is literally the biggest try hard, and douchiest streamer on Twitch for DBD
---
AT LEAST ONE FELLOW SURVIVOR DC EVERY FUCKING GOD DAMN MATCH. USUALLY WITHIN THE FIRST MINUTE. GOD DAMMIT.
---
Yes I agree, I am saying that he was a good person up until he was manipulated by the entity
---
That’s exactly what I was thinking and I watched a movie called stitched I believe that’s like this but In a different way.
---
You're right. I forgot the title, sorry.  
---
But TBH, when someone typically has that title for a video ("IS THIS THING UNCOUNTERABLE"), it's clickbait. The uploaders have their own minds made up on the matter and it's just to draw people in.
---
Also, that's not their only counter.
---
but you were trying to imply that the survivor overcame some big obstacle
---
If only there were any other way to increase objective time besides increasing "hold M1" time.
---
"I'm bad," "I'm also bad," not replying to an equally garbage post.
---
Maybe shit?
---
That sucks :(
---
But it really makes us appreciate the good rounds!
---
Hes the first killer I bought. Really average, ghostface is better imo.
---
I fucking love spongebob memes, thank you XD
---
That's a big no-no.
---
You had a lagspike. Dedicated servers wouldn't have changed that.
---
I feel like they should of changed balanced landing to remove the sprint burst effect entirely and instead have it as follows:  
---
Reduced fall stagger by 20/35/50%  
---
Reduced fall grunts by 50/75/100%
---
Balanced landing has a cooldown of 40/30/20seconds   
---
**(to prevent it from becoming problematic on maps like Haddonfield, but let's be honest that map needs to be reworked a bit)**
---
I noticed the eye as well. It's such a cool detail.
---
Fair enough
---
Right? I don't mind a disagreement. I was hoping that the drive-by disagreement guy would enlighten me with something I didn't think about or am unaware of. I've only been playing the game for a few months so maybe i'm missing something.
---
So cuuuuuute! I love this! It's very lovely, thank you for sharing :)
---
I'm of the opinion that because it takes awhile to go past all 7 generators (automatically making hiding until the killer passes your generator) and get a 40 second headstart (50 with a brown toolbox) to completing a generator per survivor before the killer can even find someone at best, resulting in only having to evade them for 30 seconds before a triple-pop.
---
And because with the speed boost for getting injured, the strength of jungle gyms and building pallet+window combinations.
---
That NOED is actually pretty balanced, Ruin doesn't slow anyone by that much if they're just trying to power through it given the strength of loops and the low-ish (I think 8% per second) chance of a skillcheck on a generator; killers don't have a lot of ongoing options against high-rank survivors and have to slap them with something, particularly ones with weaker endgames.
---
Someone ran the numbers that between adrenaline and the speed boost for hitting a survivor, the time it takes to catch a survivor is longer than it takes to open the gates (through sheer distance, as if running in a straight line); meaning if you want to catch someone in the endgame you pretty much have to use NOED unless you have an instant down in your kit.
---
"redneck" says it all.
---
But mai green medkits:(
---
This is the first I’ve ever heard of this happening. My mind is blown
---
Just got the email saying that everyone got their rewards. I didn't receive anything for it. Is anyone else having this issue? I made sure I was following all of the guidelines.
---
No one’s ever guaranteed a good game, imagine this sub if everyone posted a rant after they had a bad game. Win some, lose some just keep it moving.
---
At no point did I say you were wrong, or even try to say you were. I simply stated that while I understand your pov, I also understand why the devs dont want the numbers known.
---
It's personal, once you have played a game for a long time you realise maybe 1080p is more cinematic, yet not better in terms of playing comfortably. Many people do this on other games as well.
---
Personally i can't stand the default fov of this game and the general luminosity, especially on some dark maps like Haddonfield
---
well you're not wrong...
---
Oh it’s not just me? I just thought I was a potato killer when I’m getting spun around.
---
Rank Color is different but u are fine. When I am at 7-8 I go against a ton of reds. Now that’s...painful
---
Hell ya, I hate players like that or the ones that DC because they are trash and cant escape in a fair game
---
it’s literally always there
---
That a vanishingly small amount of the player base is going to use.
---
zubatlel, scottjund, Ralph, Umbra, fungoose
---
well, yeah. i lose plenty and win plenty. just saying the scores don't indicate that op had a good game
---
enjoy your thanksgiving prep.
---
The difference is they don’t release cosmetics people actually paid money to obtain. One that didn’t get released was the shirt (don’t remember the name) that you got when you bought merch. Because people had to pay money to obtain it they wouldn’t make it available to everyone. I imagine it’ll be the same with the Meg mask.
---
She was also hung with a noose, while Spirit and Oni bled to death according to their lore.
---
I get how you feel, I used to think that it was unfair that a rank 9 was playing against red ranks. But overall if you have the right perks and you play strategically you can probably get some points and maybe...just maybe....get a hook. Jk but it's actually pretty fair in my opinion as I deal with this exact thing as well.
---
What im afraid of is taking the ambiguity completely away and now people can unequivocally *prove* that the meta build is better. Right now there is a meta sure, but I can disagree and use what I want and not feel gimped.
---
I honestly thought she was op too but after a lot of testing both playing as and against her i think she was fine. The thing is theres not really one thing you do to counter her every time. You have to actually play mind games with her and switch up your playstyle. And yes when you are injured next time she gets her power you will likely go down but the goal shouldnt be to 1v1 her, you should just focus on wasting as much of her time as possible so your team can do gens.
---
Thats why I main her
---
How... did this post game chat even get to that topic?
---
Well you wondered why you're being downvoted so I'm just pointing it out. There's a difference between just being emotional and demanding that someone take down a video because you can't handle it.
---
lets be real this is just so you can brag abt having a gf
---
Good
---
Nice reference, but I didn't even have Monto in mind. So many of them do this 😁
---
Yeah, Micheal is an uncontrollable being not even gods can tame.
---
He failed vibe check
---
What this game needs is competition. Someone else gotta make a game like it but better for them to step their shit up, something better than F13 obviously. Right now it feels lazy as hell, the halloween event was a snoozefest as well. I uninstalled after seeing this dlc, given up hope on this mess and am bored sadly.
---
Hide or die has potential so I am hoping they do something amazing with the game.
---
Might sound harsh but if someone is full decked out blendette. I will probably tunnel them when I have the opportunity.
---
most maps are "re-makes" of existing maps because all maps exist in the context of larger realms
---
I’m sure he’ll be fine

Gay of gay to gay that gay.
---
Still have not received mine as of 1.5 hours after the email from Rover.

Alternatively, slug build time
---
Yes it does, Deathagrden is currently free until it goes down and I added it to my library and got the masks.
---
Thats fucked up
---
#WHAT DOES IT MEAN
---
It's not just you. Shit's tough... ;-;
---
Definitly worse trying, but for gods sake stay. away. from. RED RANKS. It gets bad in purple, but red is fucking insane. It's not even a game at that point, but a matter of life and death. That place is no place for filthy casuals like you and me. Mark my words....
---
You have a killer who's job is to slug or else he lose the power, but he also lose his power when he goes to down other people. Tell me how that doesn't make him a bad killer?
---
Ahhshdhshdhf this was my exact thoughts seeing yui!
---
Flex
---
Wait what?? Really? You got a source on that?
---
Better addons
---
I only ever hit green ranks cause I ran meme builds like no mither and self care with a purple Medkit lmao. I’ll stay away from red rank tho.
---
Ghostface is just Myers, but people still love him.
---
He's got a cool aesthetic and chase theme. That's enough for me.
---
i haven’t seen anyone demand for this video to be taken down?
---
Right i forgot that as a killer you have to instantly pick up a survivor when u downed him even if u see someone close with a flashlight
---
1. Have you SEEN the Archives?
---
2. Hide or Die is Hide or DEAD
---
naaa you lying bro its just eating the carrot for the daily dose of fruits and vegetables.
---
Nurse looking absolutely dejected when she loses track
---
I love how that meg is just standing there with a katana in her chest, not really caring.
---
she looks like she is gonna turn around any second and pull a fat anime fight move
---
Same, I hope elden ring will have a decent online mode and story to bring some people back.
---
Ew
---
What would a slug build look like? Only perk I can think of is deerstalker.  
---
Knock out would be useless since it’s a SWF
---
It's only a rough situation if there is only one survivor left.
---
1: Trapper is bottom-tier in endgame, he doesn't have time to reposition his power once the generators are powered without the gates being opened (at best he can reset a trap in an important position to defend the gate), Pig and Wraith are also pretty bad during the endgame (good luck hiding near a gate as either of them) compared to other kills.
---
2: Hitting a survivor gives them too much of a speed boost for you to catch up and down them before another one opens the gate.
---
3: Trapper has to take time to gather and trap both gates in advance, making it possible for survivors to disarm the switch traps prior to the final generator popping. He isn't going to be able to trap both gates only after the final generator.
---
Sure if Trapper has killed all three other survivors, trapped both gates, and closed the hatch and you haven't done anything about his traps or ensured the switches were clear (or disarmed one before he closed the hatch to lure him to a gate looking for you) then you've lost without a key or a toolbox to sabotage the trap and then hide.
---
But that requires that you, the survivor, monumentally fuck up at every single stage of the game against one of the killers who is not only one of the weakest, but even weaker due to the unprecedented need for preparation time beyond any other killer in the game, often having to devote both addons and one (or two, since Corrupt Intervention and/or Ruin) perks to having a chance of performing **equal** to other killers only after they spend time gathering and placing their own fucking power.
---
I know survivors get a ton of second chances and chase prolongers with building loops in their current one-sided condition, three hook states, and DS/Adrenaline essentially robbing the killer of any chance of an EGC kill.
---
But to die to trapped gates means you've had to personally fuck up at least a dozen times extra, throwing your own game in the trash not the once of DS, and not the once of BT/Adrenaline, and not the once of going down early despite pallets, or the twice of being in the struggle. But a good 15 or 16 times because Trapper shoots himself in the foot so hard.
---
Sometimes you deserve to lose, a trapped gate being effective against you is one of those times.
---
Yeah I saw her and immediately was like in love
---
You’re back! I love your art
---
Sounds like an unnecessary insult that 180+ people disagree with
---
nobody is saying the did it in a brutal or awful way. but i can’t comprehend not feeling emotional or at least disturbed when listening to an animal get choked in this way.
---
I like him. I think hes very unique im really glad that they made it so he actually has control of when he gets his power and didnt pull another plague. Also he rewards you for doing well as youre going to have more blood to recharge your power if you are applying pressure and keeping everyone from healing. He has map pressure, some gimmicks during chase, can punish poor positioning, and great snowball potential.
---
okay so you didn't read the OP nor did you read my comments because neither of us said he would lose his power unless you slugged and would also lose his power from pallet stuns
---
typical
---
Elden Ring? Thats a new name. Ill be sure to look into it.
---
Should be base kit

And here I thought I was the only one........

Beautiful work!!!!!!!!!

it's fine. this forum is overflowing with by the far the whiniest losers i have ever seen and the input you get from them will be awful
---
Wait shit I confused your comment for another one about the same topic lmao
---
I wonder why that is. Maybe the offerings aren't always the same? Like maybe vigo's jar of salty lips increases luck by 4% one game, then 3.8% next game, and it's all random? I know it sounds pointless but why else would they actively avoid answering questions about it?
---
Sorry for the probably stupid question, but what does BMing you mean?
---
4 hours? Those are rookie numbers. Gotta pump those numbers up

&gt; this isn't a hard game and its gameplay is very casual

Every game can be considered that, it isn't a valid point. However, going up into the higher ranks and playing against solid survivors/killers is a whole different story. The skill cap for this game is high [albeit not higher than other popular games], and it shouldn't be taken lightly.
---
&gt; a lot of shit that happens falls to luck and RNG
---
Like what?
---
&gt; there are a couple people who are highly specialized in Huntress and maybe one person extremely good at survivor who I would say have genuine skill.
---
Who? How did you get this information? How can we trust that what you're saying is even factually correct?
---
I used to hate playing against nurses, until I played her once and realized you can just run towards her to make her overshoot teleport by 10 miles.
---
Fully agreed, good sir!!!!!
---
I finally bought the rest of my friends, buuut you cant see them because they're behind everyone else
---
I didn’t even care to try it until recently.. but you’ll lose a killer quick with it the right spots.
---
My gf does the same thing lol
---
^Get ^out
---
Yeah ngl, it's a great game if you try to avoid the bad stuff. It's frustrating at times but when it works, it fucking works. What im trying to say is: The game is good, fun to play and satisfying. It has a bad side, but the good stuff outweigh the bad stuff.
---
Polnareff hiding from Alessi
---
oh word no worries. sorry for going at you then
---
Not at all, my friend. BM stands for bad manners. Like, constant tea bagging, flashlight clicking....anything douchey really. LOL!
---
It used to be that way, before the endgame collapse.
---
That’d be busted in so many situations
---
Wait you pip when you demolish people?
---
maybe, but animal cruelty is animal cruelty. i don’t think how harshly they get abused should affect how we emotionally react. i understand reacting more the more brutal it is, but in the end all kinds of animal cruelty should make us sad because animals being in forcible pain is fucking saddening. i’d probably cry more if the fish died in a brutal way but regardless of what could happen to it, i’m sad because the fish was put through pain. and i can’t see how that’s something people can laugh at
---
Ahhh of course! I honestly feel so silly for not understanding it haha! Thank you for explaining, I hope you have a wonderful day/night :)
---
I second this I would like to see the dev comment on nemesis
---
It’s best you don’t know
---
my favorite is when I hear the hatchet hit the wall behind me and I still go down :)

Icon pack:  [Combination of Ritual Pack and Happy Clown](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/dfk4t8/nurse_rework_and_stranger_things_perks_ritual/)
---
I think, based on your post, it's safe to say you want to be right all the time and never take the time to fully discuss anything. Your reddit history speaks volumes on this. Example; the very first question of mine that you answered was met with "uhhh, we'll never see eye to eye because red ranks understand the basics of the game" - I don't think anyone in their right mind would ever agree to that, let alone logically come to that conclusion. Also, you made fun of someone who said 'vods are counted as evidence', yet your comment about obtaining information about other people who also stream, upload vods, talk about the game, etc... are, somehow, legitimate evidence. Not too sure how one is wrong yet the other is right when it's the exact same thing.
---
There's a big difference between good and bad players, and it's a lot more than just 'knowing the basics'. There is so much psychology that comes into play at higher ranks across all competitive games. 
---
Anyways, god bless, I don't be responding because I don't think I'll be getting anything worthwhile out of it.
---
they didn't? they almost all got an increase in healing speed
---
If that killer were me, My vision would only let me see you and your scratchmarks. Everything else is red.
---
**and that’s fucking impressive, take my upvote you chad. I don’t deserve to be in your presence, shirtless mad lad chad!**
---
OoO needs to be looked at. Should only work for one person and be on like a cool down or something it’s so fucked
---
No one's saying you should pick up a survivor immediately if a guy with a flashlight is sitting nearbyor if they have ds. Why are you being stupid on purpose?
---
 I'm talking about leaving someone on the ground for several minutes, even when no one is around. That shit is toxic. 
---
Also, lol, I'm a killer main. I don't slug because I think it's toxic.
---
I think only one medkit had charges reduced. the rest didn't and they all got increases in healing speed
---
Has anyone? Should we contact them?
---
I love this pack, but is there any consistency with the colors? They seem kinda random.
---
This would be interesting, I think I can support it. Do you think it would be too powerful to have them all set around the loops though, even at random? Although that would certainly cut back on time of having to go to random spots on the map where there's no survivor activity. I wonder if maybe he can have an offering of different rarities stating how many traps are set around loops from the beginning of the match. 
---
I don't play a ton of trapper either, but I would definitely play him more if there were a few changes like these. The default starting traps would be a great start.
---
Some of the ideas I come up with may seem stupid, but you never know what it can lead to.
---
Great x32 Grandpappy.
---
So reporting a video is not the same as demanding it's removal? Let me ask you then, what is the desired effect of reporting it?
---
Ah yes that one SCP I can only remember because it has a metric fuckton porn of it
---
LOL! I asked this same question a few months ago, and felt the same! You're very welcome! Hope you have a great weekend, and a fantastic Thanksgiving!!!!!
---
Love your username, by the way!
---
Lol too late devs apparently already stated nemesis won’t work on legion at all
---
Oh, nice! Thanks for the info
---
Tbh you can just signal to survs to hit the gen and stand there while they do it a bit and grab them. I know it’s kind of corny, but hey....I need them points
---
I made fun of them for calling it "concrete evidence." that is some fucking neckbeard shit
---
have fun thinking a party game takes ultra talent. vidya is very serious. gamers rise up!
---
&gt; There is so much psychology that comes into play at higher ranks across all competitive games. 
---
**lmfao**
---
where do i even start with this? good god
---
when you demand something, you are requiring something.
---
when you report something, you wish for it to be taken down.
---
you can easily do both. they’re not mutually exclusive. but you can also do one without doing the other.
---
Interesting take, but I guess we're just arguing semantics at this point.
---
Well everything in the realm, not including the killers and survivivors/maurice is the entity itself, the crows are the entity, the landscape is the entity, it's all the deadly fog.
---
Theres also that moment when Myers didn´t pop Tier 3 at all since 3-4 Generators, then suddenly he activates it behind you and puts you into a chokehold
---
# Tombstone time
---
Could the same not be said about the new and old insta- heals though?
---
This.. is a good meme template. If you find it can you share it?
---
I contacted support via ticket and they said they don't have access to PTB records and we need to email Rover directly. 
---
&gt; We do not have access to the records of this experiment. For this case, I would suggest that you contact Rover directly as all queries about the said experiment go to them.
---
Legion all the way
---
No, each one would be different
---
David "Mr. Robot" King
---
That'd be really broken on current Freddy, though. The idea of being able to mark, track, and debilitate Survivors is interesting, but current Freddy already gets plenty for free.
---
What is wrong with them ?
---
My Legion already suffered enough.
---
Guess I’ll start to Play Spirit.
---
Also Otz's chat.
---
Clown is my best killer if I ever need the four kill I just play clown he shuts loops down with the press of a button
---
yeah, but lying about internet strangers is still weird. even if it’s about semantics. you can accuse randoms of demanding something when you don’t know what demanding is, and you’re also assuming that they “demanded” something at all. what.
---
Hey I didn't know they are releasing me as a survivor
---
Like the mask didn’t give it away?
---
I seriously loved your ideas honestly, do you think it would be more fair if instead the traps started maybe around objects and buildings like mother's dwelling?
---
My boyfriend gets concerned watching/hearing me play killer. I like huntress so it varies from my humming with her/cackling like a madman and yelling YEET. But if someone gets farmed or does something funny i let them live.
---
Last week a david ran me to the basement and shined a spooky flashlight at the wall. I cackled and said "this david is a precious baby who must be protected" he was the only one who lived
---
Who knew Nea was that flexible.
---
My boyfriend says this to me whenever he catches me carrying survs to the hatch. They’re just so cute man :,(
---
You're only going to be able to do so much to actually improve solo play. Ever wonder why most MOBAs only allow duo queues at Max in ranked modes?
---
Kate(=
---
I guess I’m just terrible.
---
Same! I replied to your message.
---
See?
---
I think if they’re teabagging and pointing and stuff determines toxicity for me as a killer main
---
Jesus...makes me sad because I’m sure it was a passion project that just didn’t take off well. What a shame
---
If I see the hatch on the way to the hook, I’ll toss the survivor in. Other than that... IT’S HOOK TIME, BABY!
---
Honestly I think the problem is it had such a huge overlap in demographic with DBD. If BHVR does a completely different type of game it would probably be more successful.
---
Imagine losing your one shot ability when you pick up a survivor. This post was made by BILLY GANG
---
Its only super disgusting if it spawns next to jungle gym.
---
Sorry, I'm not familiar with the genre. I'm guessing to limit the imbalance that comes with the coordination of a full party?
---
Similar thing happened to me earlier, downed a kate I think in front of the badham preschool and she ended up behind the school.
---
Wait for Yui
---
Then they should do something about that instead
---
I still stand by I will destroy any lit totems and risk the chance of it being HG. Friends of mine got mad at me a bit ago when they both told me NOT to cleanse it because it was Spirit but I was like BUT WHAT IF... so I did it anyway. It was HG and one of my friends got downed because of it. BUT TO BE FAIR it was just the one down/hook so whatever I still say worth over the potential risk of devour or something.

I will never get tired of shit like this, gg!
---
It's hard to make the connection to both killer and survivor less than a third of a second apart, especially considering it took them 3 years to fix freddy
---
I play as the Nurse. A lot of people DC when they see me tho.
---
L, you used a sabo box
---
Even funnier now that I realize I can find pics of both of them in wifebeaters easily too
---
It's you gotta do lots muscle memory like, how far your blinks go, understanding when to 1 blink hit or 2 blink to get a hit once you get that down you're set
---
Grass is your friend. Bring the Green Bottle to darken traps and a trapper bag. The purple one is beat. Place traps in grass around a pallet loop, in grass next to a window, grass that is in a choke point. Lots of traps. Burn for a dark map like mcmillian
---
What other perks you use then other than lithe
---
I never said there aren’t. I’m just joking about the Russian gamer stereotype.
---
Ok
---
All the rework really did was add a few seconds in between blinks. She’s still the strongest killer when played right in my opinion. The add ons are also much better now so yes she’s definitely worth learning
---
BOOMER
---
The survivor is creature manifested by evil incarnate. Some show signs of love, but this is just mere camouflage. It is the duty to purge these evil creatures via the entity.
---
I thought it was Pepsi Man from the thumbnail
---
I dropped her. If you dont care about winning you can give it a try but i think shes pretty fucking bad now. Its an unpopular opinion though, a lot of people say shes still good and you may be able to find a way to male her work, but i personally dont think shes worth it.
---
This sounds extraordinarily like Alex Jones
---
Wanna know something funny? I was joking about the stereotype. Imagine getting so rattled about a joke that you’re convinced that it was actually an insult.
---
Man ,are you okay?
---
The archives and vials should be a clue. I took this screenshot yesterday.
---
lmao we took out ruin within 2 mins of the match starting, and I shit you not, some bozo takes out haunted ground 3 mins later as I was looping a bloodlusted spirit. I was so mad.
---
I usually don’t set up a character’s cosmetics til after he’s leveled. XD
---
survivors with toolboxes/keys are boring as hell too, should get rid of both.
---
What, do you want me to joke about German stereotypes next?
---
it's just a joke
---
It would be weirder if it didn’t.
---
Im rank 9 killer and my queus are instant..
---
Not when the screenshot was made. I mean when you last leveled up ace. Bloodwebs in older updates of the game are different.
---
It wouldn’t be OP if the devs implemented a major drawback to the add on to at least make it somewhat fair for the survivors
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
The wiggle test. Ruin of many man.
---
That emoji is blowing shrek
---
Oh, yeah. That is fair. Guess I could tell you that I’ve only had the game since March this year, which I think was much after the web rework.
---
Where are you from? Also I'm not offended by Nazi jokes. It hard to offend me at all

Those Dwights are always so entitled. This is what happens when you start believing baby Dweet BS. I always kill them when I see them.

---
Lmfao please nooo :(
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Yeah he has definitely changed like I said I’ve really only seen videos so I have no clue what he is like on stream he’s like a super mixed bag it’s very strange
---
what if killer but with gun
---
+1 for Otzdarva, spend any amount of time on this sub and you'll soon find out he's the golden boy around here, and for good reason. Keeps a positive attitude, stays down to earth, does a really good job explaining his plays, and messes around with a lot of different builds+characters, even tho we all know his true love is Trapper with Save the Best For Last. 
---
You can learn a lot quickly watching his stuff
---
But the oni killed the spirit
---
There.
---
America, but I’m almost half German. Not only that, but I’m learning to speak German. And I’m glad you’re not offended by nazi jokes, because a lot of them are pretty funny if you’re into dark humor.
---
It’s not something you should do because of some made up obligation. If you don’t want to, don’t. Some people do because it’s just a nice gesture that can maybe even help keep people enjoying the game and coming back to it. It’s a small community, and even if it weren’t, I’d just rather people have fun playing against me. 
---
(Alternatively, it’s a lowkey powertrip to make the last survivor do what you want them to and then let them go because you’re so good you don’t even need the 4th kill. Theoretically.)
---
he looks jewish
---
scott jund,  otzdarva and scorpionz are always good! also i’ve watched panda since he was in the yogscast, so I still appreciate his content.
---
I see no one's gonna mention the perk icon of someone sucking on a dick
---
Lmao I would love to get mori’d by Andrew Jackson.
---
Contrary to what you might think I don't want SWF to be abolished at all. I just think they need to split up the queues or give you the option to only play vs solo/duo queues as a killer. Though I think your solution would work as well.
---
I love Urban Evasion.  I've ran random builds without it, and suffered. Not saying it's a "great" perk, but it's benefitted me.
---
Wraith was driven to murder by the evil of others, just like Eric. 
---
Nurse had her husband die and had memories replaying in her head of the evils of others that she was driven to kill people. 
---
The Spirit lore starts with her witnessing a murder, trying to stop it, only to be overcame. As she knew she was going to die, she vowed revenge in this life or the next surrounded by glass shards.
---
To quote: 
---
"The ground shook with her father's footsteps. She knew she was not going to make it, but she no longer cared. She would make him pay, in this life or the next.
---
A dark Fog slowly veiled her eyes, but it could not subdue her rage. She would not rest--not yet. The darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge.
---
An oath was made and Rin closed her eyes."
---
Eric was thrown out of a window while trying to stop a murder he walked in on.  He was surrounded by glass and couldn't rest until he got revenge. The opening scenes of the Crow talk about how a soul cannot rest until it comes back to right the wrongs. 
---
I'm not really seeing how Draven wouldn't fit. 
---
You can take your pick of characters to relate to.
---
I was playing with a 3 man swf stack &amp; one rando. The rando was a Jake. It came down to me and him at the end.
---
I had done the only 2 gens done, 3 totems (one a lit hex totem) and searched 2 chests. Found a key and needed to do one more gen to find hatch.
---
I almost died 10 times trying to do gens (against a Freddy). &amp; Finally I was like WTF IS JAKE DOING?! &amp; One of my swf spectated him: he was in a locker and every so often would get out, drop his medkit and pick it back up, then get back in the locker.
---
I was so peeved. I went to his locker (upstairs yellow house on Springwood) and fast vaulted the other lockers til Freddy came and found him. I didn't even care if it died at that point.
---
It was just a point that HE died. I was livid. Freddy tried to thank me for ratting him out, but I insisted he kill me too, so I didn't get reported for 'working with the killer.' Randos can be assholes sometimes...

I hate how people worship streamers on this sub. 
---
That being said, Spirit is OP
---
Yeah, I often run it with sticky soda bottle.
---
Or Oni, at least for the PTB
---
I play both surv and killer. Some killers give me hatch, so I give some surv hatch.
---
Are these issues mainly just survivor side? I’ve played like 120 hours on dedicated servers and only had a couple games with a couple survivors teleporting around.
---
This is very realistic
---
I'll do that then. Wish me luck!
---
She sounds cute, I'll look her up on /r/dbdgonewild
---
I think she is still the best killer in the game as she ignores nearly everything that a survivor could usually do to survive - but she is now slightly harder. Lots of people say she is trash because she is hard to learn, but any good nurse player could get a 4k in most games. If you’re willing to put the effort in- go ahead! But if you’re looking for someone who is strong but more simple, go for spirit, huntress or ghostface. Perhaps Oni when he is released.
---
Oh I just was too fast, wasn‘t even on purpose lol
---
As a gaymer, I can confirm I will never do this.

---
Depends on how much you play. It’s easier to get them 40 when they’re not prestiged. I personally don’t think it takes THAT long. Especially if you always put your bloodpoints into that specific character and use offerings that give you bonus bloodpoints. 
---
If you plan on prestiging one of the characters then you can go for 3,000-4000 items rather than the ones that are 6,000+. I do that when I prestige someone because I see no point in getting ultra rare stuff when I’m prestiging them. I prefer to go through it quickly.
---
At that point I'd DC on the spot. 1 OoO is annoying, any more and I'm out.
---
I'm a relatively new player so I haven't had much chance to buy other perks, so for the majority of the time, I've been using: 
---
Lithe 
---
Resilience
---
Spine Chill/Alert
---
We'll Make It 
---
Found that Lithe gives me distance to get to pallets if and when I need to. 
---
If I take a hit, resilience helps me to loop pallets if the killer decides not to break them. Means I can just vault them over and over without being hit over the pallet as often.
---
Spine Chill helps me to avoid chances altogether because I am definitely not the greatest at running the killer around. I'm okay, but not great. 
---
Alert helps me to spend my time more crucially. I can stay on my gen if I see the killer breaking pallets elsewhere or kicking gens.
---
I like to heal faster after unhooking people.
---
I was thinking about that and thats a great point ill leave those add ons alone. Does she have many others that don't change her blink time?
---
Had this happen when I was playing Myers, there were no hooks near any exit gates. I just said fuck it and let the Jake crawl too the exit.
---
If you like looking at the ground for half of the game, go for it..
---
This man speaks truth
---
Lol ok
---
&gt; If this is the standard we are at then you are just looking for this sub to be riddled with low quality memes in exchange for upvotes.
---
A fair explanation! But yea, this quote here is about how I rate this sub as far as game subs go - like, 90% reposts and shit posts, 10% funny or helpful / interesting.
---
You can unlock any survivor perk for all survivors by leveling them up to 35. I recommend going thru each survivor’s perks and figuring out which ones you’d like, then leveling up those survivors to get them. If you want to get a feel for which perks you like the most, then try them out! Almost any perk will be considered a “waste of a perk slot” by somebody, but you might find it to fit your play style very well. It doesn’t hurt to do your research either. You should make sure what you’re looking up is current tho. Lots of perks have changed a lot since they came out.

Heh. Nice.

Ay, thanks lad.
