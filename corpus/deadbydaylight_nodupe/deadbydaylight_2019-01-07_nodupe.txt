Pallets are annoying because even if I read the pallet drop and don't get stunned I still have to spend time breaking it, which on most maps gives the Survivor enough time to make it to another loop. I like the idea of giving the killer the ability to break pallets faster if they read the drop, like pressing the interact button as it gets dropped, causing you to raise your arm up to keep the pallet from going all the way down and smacking it once with the same arm, breaking it down the middle and rendering it unusable like normal. Of course, this mechanic would have to have a system in place that just won't allow the faster break to happen if you're mashing the interaction button, and the fact that you'd have to be really specific with the timing to get it to work so that it's not braindead easy for Killers to use. You'll still get stunned like normal in the case you mash is mistime it. This way, pallets are still useful to Survivors and the mindgame potential is still there for Killers, and a good Killer will be able to better counter long loops. 
---
---
---
Why wouldn’t it be? 
---
how do you keep a killer from getting close without them already taking a swing if you try that and I do they get the vault or pallet I move around 
---
The game always refers to him at Detective Tapp so it threw me off when I read it like that haha! 
---
I have not. 
---
Hey u got any more of them ***SOCKET SWIVELS***
---
King is the only David in my heart. 
---
so you are upset in doing the one objective survivors have? ok then.

Toxic survivors who gen rush. If even one gen gets popped I immediately start face camping and tunneling &gt;:( 
---
Probably because David King was released before him, so to avoid confusion they call him Detective over his first name. 
---
I wasn't really talking about your last sentence to be honest, just tried explaining why it is still camping. Then went on to explaining that camping isn't a bad thing to do when the situation calls for it
---
I played alone and the other three survivors where swf.  I saved like 5 survivors from hooks. I distracted the killer multiple times so they don' t die and so they could open the exit gates. The killer hooked me at the and and he was somewhat camping but still in a way that the chances of everyone surviving where very high. They didn't thought a second about saving me and left.
---
You die in real life.
---
Yeah it confused me since I’ve never seen the movies &gt;.&lt; *feels dumb* :3
---
Survivors getting a skillcheck right before I'm about to hit them as Freddy.

You can't fool me with that KYF mode!

No definitely not time yet. Give it a year or two and maybe depending on the player count then

Would’ve been better if it was “I’m leatherface so I must camp”
---
I didn't know that was a thing thanks bud
---
Oh, you didn’t hear? Lagging a legit strategy now
---
Since legion is still “new“ I can Only say about my short experience with them.
---
They are in unique place right now. It is hard to play against them as survivor because there is not really counter against them (or as far as I know). But the same time the killer feels weak for killer main.
---
Interestingly as far as I observed Legion, the one that goes for Multiple survivors  with FF (feral frenzy) tents to have more success due to the recent buff (or nerf for survivor) of deep wound status.
---
And the one who tunnelling seem to lose due to the long chase. But like I said , still need more information/data.
---
Change the deep wound to depleted faster as you suggested would literally broke the Legion for low rank. (Would only increase time//prolonger the match for high rank) low rank survivor would be down a lot more due to either forgetting to mend immediately (as you suggested the only way out is stating to mend before legion get to other survivor) or get hit while trying to mend by legion. (And the forth hit instant down is also a little too powerful considered how fast you can use your power, as well as you can see survivors with FF , every start of each match someone would be down instantly if one survivor get hit by FF)
---
My verdict: wait a bit, they are still "New" people start to understand and know how to use them. Each of us need more information/Data , as well as give the Dev time to balance them. 
---
Prayer Beads won't let you hear her undirectional phasing sound while she uses her power.
---
The passive phasing doesn't have any sound.
---
Okay, I'd like to make it clear that I don't agree with u/AnklePickBro on much, but he is right to call you out here. No one who says pallets need to be removed gets taken seriously. There are people who ask for Killers to have more options at a pallet loop, which is not unreasonable at all. Self Care, similarly is still an absolutely amazing perk. The ability to heal yourself on the spot whenever you want in incredibly powerful, so it needs a hell of a lot of downsides to counteract that one upside, which right now, it doesn't have. Gen speeds absolutely need to be decreased. I, alongside many others, have openly expressed that the healing nerf can be reverted as long as gens take longer in exchange. Lastly, the hatch is in dire need of a change. What makes me angry is that they were so close to making it balanced when Killers could close it. Just give Killers the ability to automatically read the auras of Survivors who don't do gens for a long time and have Left Behind be applied to Survivors who are in the situation of having the hatch closed, making them able to get gens done a lot quicker. Maybe also slow the rate at which generators regress when kicked by a Killer. The prevailing opinion is that Survivors have too much control over the game, which is true. 
---
Honestly, I’m just surprised no one has said a word about Claudette’s who wear the brown shirt and black skirt to become invisible 
---
I shudder at the thought.
---
Lol sure
---
do you not find it annoying? as a survivor main who plays killer occassionally for the rituals, i find getting pallet stunned and looping hella annoying. just because i know its literally the only way for survivors to extend chases doesnt make it less annoying. :P
---
No.  It's been ridiculously nerfed as it is now.
---
Max is best, being able to turn faster will only benefit you. I started at 75 movement speed and slowly upped it a few points as I got use to it until it was maxed, wish it could go higher now.
---

Nice

Freddy: when you transition to the dreamstate and when in the dream state, the best way to get out is to fail a skill check. Fun fact: if multiple sleeping people are working on the same generator, only 1 person needs to fail a skill check for everyone to wake up. Self care is very handy against freddy, since self care skill check fails will also wake you up. Just know that if you can't hear the heartbeat that freddy can see you. After getting out of dreamstate I recomend relocating yourself unless you can finish something importand in the area in only a few seconds. Just remember that freddy, after pulling you into the dream, is just a base killer, he has nothing to stop you from looping him and his speed is only 115% (altough, he gains a slight speed boost after pulling someone into the dream, so be aware of that).
---
Clown: they are a pretty good killer, like with huntress, try moving a little bit unpredictably to avoid his bottles. In general, only walk into the pink clouds if it's the only way to safety. Appart from that, not much you can do about him, he will force you to end loops faster than you yourself would want to.
---
Spirit: this one is a master of mind games, so all I can give you is the mind games you need to watch out for. For starters, when she activates her power, it will appear as if she is standing still. If you are looping a spirit and suddenly see her stamding still, don't pannic because the mind game has started. They are either using their power and trying to close the gap with you, or they are just standing still and waiting for you to mess up. Best thing to do in general is to stop running, and start walking in any direction, make shure you can get to a safe place if she reappears clode to you and don't walk towards her. Also, if you are injured without iron will, it's more dangerous since she can easyly hear you, in this case running might be your best option, just try not to run in a straight line. They also don't have a window vaulting animation, so when you see her staring at a window, she is either vaulting, phase walking or trying to mind game you. You should watch out when doing a generator or cleaning a totem within her terror radius since she can suddenly appear behined you and pull you off. There is however an addon that makes it so that you always need to worry about this.
---
The point was that THE SOLUTION to someone finding the lit totem immediately, is to remove the hex part. Is it good for the game at all, HELL NO. But it is the end all be all solution.
---
If you want slowdown but not to have to worry about your totems, thanata is a alternative.
---
I wasn't saying to add more totems, just totem locations.
---
Having to take the totem somewhere is extremely tedious. The killer would know where and semi camp it the whole match.
---
And whether or not you like your own solution, it's still not viable and is too easy to manipulate.
---
Matchmaking 10/10.
---
Didn't we all get a few hundred? Surely you can spare a few dozen.
---
I can hear this picture
---
Yea I’ll correct that,thanks for the notice
---
Nope. I searched for quite awhile to try to find a poster that was more than 70 x 200 pixels but it turns out that looking for a poster for a critically panned movie that basically killed an entire genre is rather hard to do.
---
why the fuck do default dances make me laugh so hard
---
lmao 
---
certain people on this sub keep telling me how it's totally killer biased, yet here is a survivor hitting rank 1 (congrats btw!) being upvoted while a killer making a rank 1 post is being downvoted
---
I t bag cause I have kindred 3. Get baited fucker
---
People thought the Legion was gonna do that, I mean a lot
---
Leatherface.
---
Not to mention it completely trumps some killer perks, as well as a lot of the aspects of this game in general.
---
Well now that explains alot.
---
Youd be suprised ive seen amazing killers stoop to facecamping if a survivor pisses them off, generally speaking though you are right, camping doesnt pay in the end
---
2 at once is very intriguing. 
---
Looks like a thanksgiving turkey.
---
IMMA BE A DOUCHE
---
#YEET
---
Its not a match making problem... Is more of no one wants to play Killer on console because it sucks problem 
---
How so? I always thought he was pretty easy to combat.
---
Decisive is fair and should not be nerfed
---
Brain dead rank 10 survivor here
---
Guys dont make fun of him, this guy is the newest albert einstein
---
I’d also like to hear the justification behind this
---
I think you mean, if you are using a phone tether and want to play killer, don’t. 
---
It wouldn't have worked then either
---
When I play killer I will chase the first survivor I find around until they realize I’m trolling, stop running and just look at me. I will immediately leave and do this to the other survivors unless they t-bag. The benefits of playing at low rank. 
---
My bad if im wrong but i thought i caught some sources of this being outside an event but i wont defend my point as my knowledge on this isnt that trustworthy lol.
---
I'm also pissed off abiut this since I WAS a Spirit main. Now I mostly play Legion and Freddy. Call me crazy, but it's true.
---
I *really* want a werewolf killer, especially if it has hella scary howls and snarls and shit
---
Get facecamped for the whole game ;) 
---
Nah i think they didnt woosh lol, kinda funny.
---
Escapes hook once\* 
---
Get max level hook camped, while other survivors spin and try make the killer move...
---
That's how mafia works.
---
If their allies are smart they'll finish all the generators and leave while you waste timing starting at a afk player
---
Exactly
---
This mafia city advertisements/ "memes" are pretty shit
---
I think Pinhead is more suites to be in Mortal Kombat. He seems too powerful for DBD. In ny opinion.
---
I wish they would add it to dead by daylight tbh
---
Friday the 13th had a such fun social feature to it 
---
I wouls like the see The Thing. Idk how they eould do it, but it would be cool. Maybe get the Norris spider head to chase survivors?
---
Happens way too often...
---
its like no one googles the killers abilities before playing
---
If I'm honest the lore it always what seems like all the effort has gone into and so is ussually high quality it's the balancing and the ideas for perks/mechanics that often seem uninspired of just blatantly overpowerd.
---
How are they abusing comms? by telling them the killer perks they are running?
---
Maybe don’t make a legion mask
---
Be original and choose someone else
---
Lol no it doesnt, the pigs power and i cant remember if billys chainsaw. Thats it. 
---
Doesnt counter traps, hatchets, dream demon, spirit, stalking etc etc
---
Some survivor quests are frustratingly difficult, others are buggy lol
---
Claudette with D strike
---
Killer mains gonna be fuckin pissed
---
I agree, there isn't a rework needed. It is a niche perk, but niche doesn't mean bad.
---
GaMe dEsIgN iS hArD!!!
---
Or it goes off the highest rank survivor in the swf
---
Nah man, we need more legion
---
People only stream this game as killer if they are running morays so it seems fair
---
He is only annoying when he face camps and makes tard sounds. Lol
---
Removing pallet vaccum :(
---
Yup, and because playing killer is so EZPZ.
---
Both posts are lazy
---
walks to other gate...
---
Which only strengthens my point. Take it away and people won't play. 
---
If you think ds is op then you must be a rank 20 legion main because you can simply down the survivor again or dribble them it’s not that bad 
---
I've gotten this once or twice in my 100 hours of playing.
---
the pig is considered a mid tier character because the traps are able to force survivors to not be working on gens which extends the amount of time that you as a killer have to hunt down the players. The ambush feature isn't especially high tier, but it removes your terror radius while crouched so it does allow you to get close enough to survivors to start a chase from a fairly close range, or if you do it well, get an early hit on them before they realize they are under attack. The ambush can also be used as a super extended lunge if you are being looped to hit a survivor who is just jumping back and forth over pallets.
---
The one with the hat!
---
i just got this game and i'm smiling because i enjoy it, kinda. i don't smile when i play killer,  because it takes a long time to get a lobby and then i can't find a survivor for the whole game or when i do, they pallet loop me. but i enjoy playing survivor. it makes me smile.
---
True
---
Dead by Dwight
---
Dribbling is a method but puts you at risk of getting blinded, body blocked, survivor wiggling off etc I’d love to know what rank you are aswell =) once you hit rank 1 and play with actual good survivors it opens your eyes
---
Bet the dedicated servers for Oceania (Asia/Australia) wont come out till 2020 and the player base will die due to laggy connections to servers on the other side of the world...
---
Unfortunately due to the dodgy tracking on the auto attack when survivors quickly change direction, you need to have very high sensitivity to be able to hit someone who is good at dodging the killer. So yeah, as high sensitivity as you can.
---
You’re just bad lol
---
I use the traps in the endgame. I also crouch whenever I'm not in a chase. Good for sneaking up on them. Other than that I don't have many tips.
---
I'm not the best at Pig, but one of the main strategies I use with her is the Last Will add on and Blood Warden - save the traps til 1 or 2 gens left and then the end game potential can be massive, if it goes well 0/1 kills can turn to 3/4. I also tend to run Nurses on her and use the crouch to down them, pretty much the only way I land a successful dash attack. :)
---
1.generators 2.generators 3.generators 4. Generators 5. Generators 6. Fuck they have noed
---
At best, it’s an unreliable counter because a Survivor being able to hit UP skill checks isn’t rare at all nowadays. Survivors that can hit UP+DS skill checks are also not that hard to find. It seems like you might need to get better at UP+DS skill checks. 
---
Nah dude, its just the new cosmetics
---
Well... to be fair, a killer can do whatever they want.  Sucks but a killer can be calculated,  obsessed, insane, you name it.  If winning the match means killing one little insect and slowly pulling the legs and wings then so be it.  It's the nature of the game... unfortunately
---
I dont even really know whay you're saying here if I'm being honest, but maybe you mean that even if they make the pallet you just go around the loop. That only works on unsafe loops or if the survivor isnt looking behind when they dead hard so they know to not drop the pallet yet.
---
I have nothing to say about this other than, "Have some faith in the developers."
---
I'm sure they're working on it.
---
This glitch is so weird. I've only had it while playing Freddy ir Legion.
---
Dying light sucks unless you have a green mori and get lucky with finding the obsession early game, save the best of last is pretty decent and play with your food is only really good when using tuft of hair and tombostone. You wanna probably be going for something that eats pallets tracks and slows the game down and removes your terror radius in teir one evil within.
---
Try monitor and abuse 
---
Barbeque and chilli
---
Hex ruin
---
Brutal strength/spirit fury/enduring
---
Okay.
---
I don't know which you mean. Either the suvivor who saved them has the perk borrowed time which makes it so if you down a survivor who was just rescued from a hook they go into deep wounds state (the same as the legion inflicts). This gives them a count down until they go down again unless they take some time to heal themself, though that count down does not decrease while you are chasing them. The other alternative is that the killer is not capable of downing a survivor until they have gained control of their character. if you hit them while they are still being pulled off the hook, it will not down the survivor being rescued.
---
I wouls help if I has the slightest amount of knowledge about crafting cosplays.
---
I think it would be way to toxic in DBD to be honest. But its a very fun little feature in friday the 13th, maybe the community is more chill there.
---
We can only hope so
---
Bad idea posting here
---
Everyone is gonna downvote you since they dont wanna hear the truth
---
I threw a white ward on without an item because I was running a plunderer's build. Then I found a party starter in all three chests... RIP
---
I feel you. I think this is what compels people to theory craft so much because we may think “if this idea is good enough, maybe it can get some attention by the developers and it may spark something.” 
---
Truly, I just like thinking of killers and killer perks and survivor stories and their perks too. I may even post it once I come up with a better name for another survivor perk. 
---
Eva foam is better for the mask
---
Thoose materials you using and weak
---
pls teabag the mori.  it's all we've got left.
---
Yeah... there are multiple different perks which do that.
---
No one cares
---
Soo tired of this posts
---
Seems pretty bad, for taking up an entire perk slot it doesn't really help you at all when the terror radius.still exists
---
That makes me want to t bag more. Seeing killers get so tilted they literally stop playing the game makes me so erect. And the fact that all 3 teammates see you camping means I'm bouta nut
---
It wouldn't be a bad idea. It would be a niche perk that is rarely used, but still not bad.
---
lmfao i have 100 hours and i've been moried at least 15 times
---
The only help I can give is to suggest you use Iridescent Shards. If you can't for a certain skin, I can be of no help. Sorry.
---
Ok, pig is a mid tier because she has two main advantages over other m1 killers 
---
1) her traps slow the game down, just a lil bit
---
2) with video tape you can use ambush to counter loops
---
Now, as an m1 killer you want m1 killer perks. Enduring and spirit fury are two main contenders, and bamboozle another highly picked one.
---
First, stop overcrouching. If you have to travel the whole map at sub 100% speed you will lose any pressure you had. Crouch whenever you are close enough to gens. That means USE COMBAT STRAPS. Never ambush if not using medical file or video tape. 
---
Trap usage is personal. I like having 3 running and leave the last one for endgame. But, whatever 
---
Im on mobile so ill stop here. 
---
so don't comment lmao. i'm proud of my accomplishment bc rank 1 survivor on PS4 is pretty difficult. take ur negativity elsewhere, thanks!
---
Rank three
---
Thanks for the suggestions! I’m currently trying to get ruin teachable, will probably go for monitor and abuse after, don’t have all the dlc so would need bbq to be in the shrine
---
It's at +6 and was already being upvoted when you commented
---
Except you can pip while dying, so dying isn't always a loss...
---
On my first month of having the game I was with 3 other rank 18-20 against a rank 1p3 leather face
---
Don't tunnel the person with the trap. The trap is meant to stall the game and waste time. Make Your Choice is good on Pig. Spirit Fury is good on Pig, because of how easilly she can be looped. Blood Warden is also good if you wanna get a surprise attack on scummy survivors. Nurse's Calling is also good for sneak attacks. You don't want to rely entirely on her dash attack or her traps. Only traps mid game don't waste them before a gen has been done.
---
You are probably right sadly :( 
---
Good
---
Show this to your family ans friends
---
We get this type of posts every day
---
And what negativity?? Im speaking the truth that you cant handle
---
No because that would be nice. And they are to busy working on fucking cosmetics for the two most toxic survivors in the game. What a surprise.
---
"no one cares" is negativity, lol. and if you don't wanna see it, don't look ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Pallet checks. Enduring, spirit fury, brutal strentgh etc etc... bambozzle woudnt hurt either. And yknow, the staple ruin 
---
Wont rise much though
---
By using comms to replace perks like Alert and Bond - but not just that but replacing them with a much stronger form
---
Look in the back!
---
The invite link is invalid or expired.
---
With the ping I experience, maybe
---
Ruin ain’t half annoying lol, thanks for the suggestions
---
Negativity would say its horrible or a bad thing
---
Im saying the truth
---
repost
---
I think if Small game did this it would be fine. 12 meters isn't a very big area and you still have to face the totem to see it. The ding gets on my nerves personally because sometimes it just doesn't work.
---
The concept of decisive strike is fine, but I do think it requires a counterplay option beyond negating it using dribbing, an uninetended mechanic. It should have an activation clause that the killer can actually influence. Maybe require you to be in the killer's terror radius for X amount of time or to successfuly land a pallet stun. Just some sort of fairly easy action required to prime the perk so that a killer upon seeing that a survivor is an obsession can take action to try and avoid letting that prerequisite be fulfilled.
---
There isn’t a single game where I get messages like I do when I play DBD. Survivors can’t just say nothing. 
---
"When i play survivor i don't really care if the killer camps me"
---
Using Mori on a SWF rank 2 as a level 18 killer very satisfying 
---
Her Reverse Bear Traps are great at slowing the game down. 
---
I do amazing with her at Rank 1.
---
Oh man :( 
---
All Claudette’s are sinners.
---
You know it.
---
&gt;That makes me want to t bag more. Seeing killers get so tilted they literally stop playing the game and stand still makes me so erect.
---
yikes... 
---
Imagine playing a game with the sole purpose of trying to make somebody mad.   That's pretty sad, dude. 
---
That shouldn't make you drop your item.
---
2 dlcs? Weird.
---
She deserved like all streamers
---
Offering?
---
I only played pig for a while when I bought her, and I was successful a lot of the time, but that mostly relied on MYC and finding someone instantly. I also saved at least 1 trap for the end to try and keep as many survivors in the game as possible, I usually ended up with at least 3 or 4 kills without needing to tunnel 
---
I hate playing against Freddy because he is impossible to see unless you're asleep.
---
That could be the case I suppose, it’s very hard to tell from the video. 
---
r/iamverybadass
---
bbq, enduring, spirit fury, ruin. it's godlike on michael. sometimes i swap ruin for either bamboozle or monitor &amp; abuse depending on which add-ons i'm using.
---
I agree I think there should be a prerequisite in order to earn ds. Most players who run the perk are Aggro and attempt to keep the killers attention so a pallet stun could be easily achieved for them. But on the other hand the perk could become useless super fast as the killer could just avoid the ds user rendering the perk useless for the match 
---
I'd honestly just be happy with discussion instead of getting a lot of votes. If people agree, that's cool, too. I just think we shouldn't be complacent (if that's the right word) with what BHVR has done/has not done.
---
Imagine standing still in front of someone for minutes because they crouched several times
---
That's pretty sad dude
---
All survivors are created equal once you have the perks you want. 
---
I'm sorry you had a hard time reading my post. I asked for help for a cosplay, not help on deciding what I'm allowed to cosplay as.
---
Ps: have you seen the other killers, if I'm having trouble doing legion I don't think I'd stand a chance trying the rest. 
---
Hurts just by looking at it
---
So you admitting you a tunnler?
---
Less sad than what you’re doing bro. You’re actually pathetic. Only losers teabag. 
---
If it says "stacks" in the description they stack. I think even if only one says "stacks" they both stack. Am I right?
---
Well I’m not going to leave if a person is being saved in front of me now am I?
---
Wrong. Literally standing still and not playing the game by looking for other people is a lot sadder than crouching up and down lol
---
You're such a crybaby
---
Get it fixed, it's 2019 can't be that difficult 
---
I t bag people who don't know they can't leave the exit gates with a trap on their heads
---
Fucking agreed, whenever I play killer and I get t bagged and shit, I do the complete opposite of camping, my play style becomes hyper aggressive. I find no enjoyment in watching ONE person die while the rush happens when I can crank up the pressure and just work the survivors to death. And as a survivor main, seeing someone get camped basically tells me “okay, well at least that’s a free two gens”. Killers getting tilted just let’s me know that they expected an easy win from potatoes and that they had a tantrum they had to work for it
---
What is dark sense? 
---
*ferociously T-bags inside of the survivor getting morried* who else does this? I do it as a way to say ohhhhh fuck bouiiii 
---
The healing is exponential
---
Damn really? I’ve only previously played the game in bursts every couple months, is there a reason it hasn’t come up?
---
Neither of them mention stacking. 
---
I’m going to be completely honest here, I have never experienced major FPS drops as Survivor (except against a Wraith with the bugged Sloppy or in really, really short bursts). The only major FPS drops I regularly experience in-game are as Killer when I’m swinging and the Survivor is trying to dodge it. Everything else works fine for me (I’m on a base model PS4 BTW). 
---
I have no clue but I am not complaining at all.
---
Beautiful 
---
Also, the fact that anything in this game “extends” your hit box should not be a thing. Plain and simple. A hit box in a video game should remain the same no matter what you are doing. A hit box that changes size based on different actions or movements is a really bad design imo lol. Just theres no reason for it, it only gives you shit like this.
---
Either random was not generous towards us or devs see BBQ&amp;C as the only reason for people to buy Leatherface DLC. I mean Bubba is not popular, so a little p2w money grabbing is understandable. 
---
It doesn't matter if you do or not they will still make up some reason to blame the killer or even other teammates for their own dumb actions. 
---
Yep, 1 blink for 2 separate DSs in the same match for me. It was very satisfying to put them in their place.
---
Yeah I get why they do it, it’s not like the dlc is that expensive tbf
---
Went up against a match agaimst the Doctor and with me and another person left we got a total of 4 gens left before she was downed. That New sacrificed herself for me. This happened a few weeks ago but damn that match was aweosme.
---
Sounds cool. Not meta, but strong for someone like Myers, Hag or Pig. And I'd give it a different name. Something more related to fog. 
---
stop your bitching
---
Don't feed trolls. Downvote and move on. &lt;3
---
r/Mots2 r/Vikingking42 
---
Gen rushing isn't really a exploit its just playing the game well and focusing on objectives/winning
---
Been playing fora couple weeks now. This happens every time. Once in a survive with friends game we all shit ourselves when it went off. 
---
They obviously, do, just interesting that both posted an image of the post game screen.
---
But then if a killer swings and a survivor barely starts the animation, what should have hit turns into a miss, because you cant just move the hitbox with the animation. That doesn’t mesh with how the swings work. You’d have to teleport the hitbox with the drop, but that pretty much removes any reason to swing at a survivor during a loop, so you’d just be playing eat the pallet sim.
---
He arguably is the best survivor because he makes the least noise while injured, side note, once all perks are unlocked it's a matter of preference. I'm an ace p3 50 with all perks in the game tier 3.
---
Anything is a crutch depending on how you look at the perk/add-on the guy most probably wasn't having a very good day or good games
---
Just leave it and move on? Don't quite understand the point of this post as you say you don't like he felt entitled but your doing the same thing he was doing to you but to a larger audience :P

---
Fucking endless groups of swf 03 claudettes . This game is going to make me a racist if I keep playing killer.
---
Dwight is a god, you heretic.
---
The hook one sounds feasible, but it was a bit odd. Huntress was like full auto like a semi auto rifle with a extended magazine
---
https://i.imgur.com/loikwE4.png
---
Yeah like there are literally abilities in the game that are useless if you have voice chat.
---
Use speedtest.net and give us your results could be you especially if you don't have a huge amount of bandwidth and are using multiple programs / devices
---
You tell him, bloody dwight. XD
---
I understand that the game is moderately designed around not having voice chat but wow are they missing out on something! I even would like the killer to be able to say things to scare you or taunt you.
---
"She squeaks and teabags."
---
That's all I need
---
I don't know because I don't hang around hooked survivors
---
They are shown but not revealed which secret it is
---
Amen
---
They removed vaccums to compensate for that, it was the reason they removed them, so a survivor who barely got the start of the pallet drop animation couldn’t get a pallet stun, you have to walk literally onto the other side of the pallet now to even get the prompt, so if you have made it that far into the pallet and successfully time the space, no I don’t think the killer should be able to get a hit. That should be a stun. Now if the survivor can’t make it to the prompt to drop the pallet that’s a different story, or if they don’t time it right. 
---
Well then
---
Console legacy looking nice. 
---
If you don't want any survivors or killers just buy cosmetics for the ones you like
---
Is this really your only contribution to the thread?
---
buy a killer that looks fun, or spend them in the shrine of secrets for good perks
---
Would have to drop medkit, but as you can see near the end, they still eat the corpse raw, ensuring the body doesn’t go to waste.
---
Hacks
---
Do gens.
---
True statement you get 4 til the survivor gets released  
---
Don’t understand slogging a ds user, I just take the L and down them straight after it’s no biggie
---
I would agree, but when I play as Huntress and Axe people to stop pallet looping they always disconnect.
---
I mean, it's not my fault the survivors decided to stay in one spot for a brief second in order to jump a pallet (incredibly easy to aim) or to drop a pallet (Practically can't miss).
---
first meme of 2019. mafia city
---
Scares the shit outta me Everytime
---
bless their little hearts
---
Uh I play both. Just killer more..... So yea. Survivors/swf are assholes that get to exploit and an obvious advantage that borderline cheating if not straight up unfair. 
---
Which is having an effect on the more killer side of thr community. 
---
Or are you not noticing all the complaints from the survivor side about killers DCing during the lobby process, if they can find a match at all, or during the game
---
Duh.
---
Typical survivor main. Not realizing the problem they themselves have made with their own toxicity. 
---
Had a Dwight run up and start teabagging in the corner of my vision while I was clown mori'ing someone once, couldn't stop laughing
---
I've been pallet looped as Huntress and yes, you can axe people behind stuff like that.
---
The hitbox window is tiny, but you can do it. You're likely to hit the pallet/box twice and have a third one go wide though.
---
*runs iron will*
---
I mean, a lot of killers run BBQ which doesn't activate on moris, sometimes people don't get unhooked, sometimes you just forget.
---
Ace Visconti- the lucky gambler
---
I think a vip mode would be cool, one person becomes obsession and the killer needs to find and kill them to win while the other survivors gotta body block dress the same etc.
---
Here's your bimonthly "Quit Game button is dabbing XD" post.
---
Did you.... even read? Like... at all?  
---
It *is* revealed that a secret item is in play, and due to the fact that there are so few secret items, it's super obvious what's at play. 
---
300 hours isn't that much, you'll see it more when you hit the high ranks. Last night I had like 4 in a row.
---
Knockout.
---
And at the very end of the slow pan! *Perfect* 
---
That's how Dead by Daylight works
---
It also is really good for escaping from the basement if they aren't body-blocking.
---
There's certain things a killer will do that's considered cheating but it's also with survivors. They just like to bitch when they're getting beaten. 
---
A survivor in the game
---
Probably a dumb question but since im new at this game what means DC, face camping and what the problem with losing all totems??
---
Still waiting on my leather suit david
---
Had a bad game as Leatherface were a rank 2 was swfing with lower friends intentionally to play against bad killers. Managed to down them once, but they had ds and I was too far from a hook to juggle. Brought an ebony next game and got 3 kills with 1 hatch escape. The 3 kills all had ds, but I didn't get hit by a single one because I juggled the obsession and the rest were close enough their ds didn't activate before they got hooked.
---
Dc = disconnect aka quitting
---
Face camping: when you hook a survivor and you stare at them instead of searching for other survivors
---
Losing totems is bad for a killer. It replaces their perks and are rendered useless when you cleanse them
---
Thank you all for your input! I’m going to take all of this into account when choosing what killer I want to play as
---
pRettY GoOd Job sO FAR
---
I mean, if they run it they probably have to hit it every game, they eventually get used to it.
---
Decisive Strike by a fucking mile. Irritating as fuck and enables all of the toxic little shits.
---
Who won?
---
This post will be probably removed, but good job! 
---
Nooo! I believe there is good inside some claudettes!
---
thank you!
---
Ruin is mid tier due to it's unreliable nature and completely useless once exit gates are powered
---
What time were you playing ? 
---
Lol at the devs making stealth killers like pig or myers when swf exists.
---
Nothing better than sneaking up to a gen with pig only to have their mate on comms tell them you're going in the building.
---
ive been playing for a while and i havent seen a single legion or spirit xD 
---
I take it to the next level, I’ll sit 3ish feet from the hatch and leave idle to go make a sandwich or something. If I come back and the survivor is still there, I slap them and carry on with the sweet sweet victory of food and a 3k
---
Toss bad killer internet in there and then you got a real fucking treat.
---
If you're set on buying a killer/survivor i suggest the spirit and adam francis as they have the most fun perks/powers to play around with. Otherwise just get cosmetics for your current characters.
---
People who put TTV in their name never have more than 10 viewers anyway
---
Meh, I’m toxic as fuck as killer but man, facecamping is the lowest low, the only time I ever camp is if I’m running a basement meme build with insidious, or I sometimes proxy camp if I see no one on my BBQ proc
---
But nowadays I don’t even do that because of distortion :/
---
Now just wait for the inevitable return of the hybrid shit meme killer concept
---
So let's just straighten this out, if the killer get's 3K's you think you're entitled to an escape and they're not entitled to the fourth kill?
---
Gotta hate those teitch streamers
---
Literally done this once, and it was a couple days ago, and it WORKED. Fuck you Billy.
---
I wouldn’t spend them in the shrine. I would only buy shrine perks if you don’t own the killer (I.e. you want Dying Light but don’t have Myers). Otherwise I’d say buy killers and survivors you like and buy cosmetics. Shards are pretty easy to get so don’t worry if you bought something you don’t like. 
---
From bottom to top:
---
* **Trapper Bag** - Gives you 1 more Bear Trap. Should honestly be baseline.
---
* **Mouldy Electrode** - Increases Zap range so it isn't point-blank, and the only downside is a slight increase in charge time.
---
* **Winter Party Starter** - I think we're all experiencing these things now lol.
---
* **Berus Toxin** - Causes Exhaustion for 30 seconds. Ever since the Exhaustion nerf this addon has become a 3000 Bloodpoint "delete any Exhaustion perk that isn't Sprint Burst from the game" addon for Huntress.
---
* **Combat Straps** - An absolutely insane addon that cuts the time it takes for Pig to crouch/uncrouch in HALF (2 seconds to 1 second); insane for stealth gameplay of any sort.
---
* **"The Ghost" - Soot** - This was kinda the main point of my post. The Ghost is an *insane* addon that is completely mandatory to make sneak attacks as Wraith in any way viable. Having six seconds of Tinkerer + Beast of Prey is insanely good and the fact that it's tied to a Common addon is ridiculous. It's mandatory for Jumpscare Wraith (Coxcombed Clapper/Bone Clapper) and very strong in any other build as well.
---
Piggo 4 life
---
The game knew you all weren’t true rank 10+
---
Thanatophobia can be good with him, especially if you combine it with the addon that makes the terror radius the entire map to help you injure everyone and slow the game down (just a lil bit)
---
Holy shit thank you 😆
---
You just relieved so much aggravation for me.
---
Let me tell you survivors like that will call you a camper even if you teleport to a different fucking server. You just gotta deal with their shit and say “I’m not gonna let you guys save him, I have a job to do”
---
We were right next to the exit too, so we both made it!
---
Oh! Thank you so sorry. I’m on Xbox. 
---
Anything with bloodhound is great because you can just follow the blood trail of the deep wounded survivor while looking down and they can't do anything. Since you aren't really chasing them they can't do anything but go down.
---
I'm one of them, I like to watch their reactions. 
---
You’re awesome. I’m on Xbox. Thank you so much!!
---
Toxic is a jam even to this day. lol
---
Still waiting for The Shard to be next dlc 😔
---
/s
---
Sorry, i'm not on here enough to know if something has already been posted.
---
the only time i ever facecamo is when survivors run from me
---
This is probably more of a r/woosh thing right?
---
can sprint burst be buffed so it recharges when sprinting

---
How are you chasing all 3 at once? And it is still possible. Time goes much quicker than you think in this game. There are so many different factors that come into play. I cant say what happened if i have no video to show me
---
2/3 of Dwight’s perks are good. Leader is fantastic because it’s leader, bond is good for locating survivors and grouping up with them to help them with gens, or heal, and is god tier when combined with leader. Prove Thyself isn’t too great because for it to work properly you need all survivors near you which typically won’t happen, and it’s just better if 3/4 have a boost instead of 1/4. 
---
Never had a game crash since beginning 6 months ago on PS4. Is this a common issue?
---
Yeah, idk if you read the other comments, but it appears to be only progressing when you are healing a teammate together with another one.
---
That costs money and resources.
---
Easy mode with spirit. 
---
Buy all of us dedicated servers :p
---
Different skill checks spin at different speeds. For instance the healing skill checks are quite slow. Normal generator ones are a bit faster, generator skill checks triggered by the overcharge perk are very fast.
---
He can make an area of a map unsafe and no people dont usually disarm them this trapper should not have tried to go for the hit and go around 
---
The stun part
---
Cosmetics, you can always buy chapters during sales
---
game over
---
***DA-NA NAH!-***
---
Pick bloodbound to make sure you wont lose the survs then proxy chase. The other 3 perks doesnt really matter. 
---
Their job is to entertain and sell the game as streamers. There's no right and wrong way to go about being an entertainer. It's laughable that you think there is a right and wrong way to stream the game.
---
Your beyond stupid , grow the fuck up and access your life priorities friend.
---
She was bloodlusting, she deserved to be punished for it with a spirit, absolute scrub move.
---
Do toolbox addons have anything to do with it? I’ve never really noticed a difference but sometimes I swear I’ll hit it and the gen blows anyway 
---
You should change the tag to shitpost when you are joking.
---
Not gonna lie, that actually looks awesome.
---
DS isn't near as bad as some people make it out to be. It just starts the chase again which shouldn't be an issue if you're a good killer.
---
I'd like one change, make it so you always have to wiggle a bit so I can down people near a hook to avoid it.
---
Once again.  
---
Camping is legitimate strategy, and sometimes the only valid one, considering how handholding this game is for survivors. They have it easy enough. Sometimes it's the only way to secure a kill in times of cheese clutch perks that survivors have a handful of.
---
Thana, blood hound, BB&amp;q (cuz legion doesn't get enough bloodpoints already)(jk) and maybe hex ruin or nurses calling. Also mad grit is rather badass for the try hards
---
As a survivor, just run off to a gen and work on it or try to open a gate. 
---
They’ll try to follow you and hit you, use the speed to go back to hatch. 
---
As killer, you don’t win. You lose by letting them go, you lose by waiting 20+ mins for a kill. Killers should be able to close the hatch. Seriously. 
---
Not even that it’s just that they wouldn’t even stand a chance fighting back
---
Bruv thanks for the advice, ive been raking in the 4ks and this killer is fun as hell
---
Doesn't the ps4 have an inbuilt recording system so you don't have to record half a screen with your phone?
---
Always first survivor down, can confirm
---
same ;-;
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
GAME OVER YEAHHHHHH
---
I don't see why I should help the survivor who unhooks under my nose getting a pip if I can steal all those delicious progress with an unsafe unhook. 
---
While it sounds like the smart idea from consumer standpoint, as a company money is in the forefront. And they will makes more money by fixing it over 9 months whilst releasing killers then they will by fixing it over 3 months and not releasing a killer.
---
I believe you are correct, yes.
---
"You got KNOCKED THE FUCK OUT!"
---
Great news!
---
Thats the main use of that perk in the first place.
---
Gurlllll you need to back yo ass off. You ain’t her sugar daddy.

We literally had this post last week. Maybe 2 weeks if I am off.
---
But what brings in the money? DLC
---
Great drawing.
---
It's a mechanic that they are *abusing for no good reason*. You can be just as entertaining at high ranks and other streamers have proven that. Like I said though, if you want to admit they're being assholes than that's fine by me. By the logic you're using they are no better than the killers they complain about. Also I don't get this whole "one individual streamer" thing, its a group of assholes from what I can tell.
---
genrushing doesn't exist. do killers "killrush"? you can't 'rush' something when thats the survivors only objective. cmon.
---
not to discredit the rest of your post, that is, as you are right, everyone's entitled to their own opinion
---
I haven't been on here for maybe 6 months.
---
ah
---
I only ever use moris for dailys or toxic people. Dumb item overall in my opinion. But so are instaheals and co.
---
Shhhhhh, they'll hear you! 
---
*shudder*
---
That david XD
---
Almost there, buddy.
---
to me it's Demi
---
A story would not only be a waste it would ruin the Atmosphere. Opinion discarded.
---
wow you really know nothing about game design huh, maybe you should learn basic shit before acting like you know anything you're talking about
---
What.
---
calling this game 'bare bones' and that it needs MORE content rather than fixing a laundry list of bugs and glitches is incredibly naiive
---
I bet you feel stupid right now
---
Ironically enough, _Freddy_ is the only stealth killer to trump this aspect of SWF. Sure, you can tell where his song is, but you don't know exactly where he is or which direction he went.
---
Umbra lost a 4 man slug to a single DS the other day. She downed them all again and killed them, but the power a single DS can have is just stupid.
---
Any susie suggestion is a good suggestion.
---
In my experience, just expect a kill billy to be charging after you and prepare for a chase. Move near pallets and obstacles, hope he hasn't decided to go for you. 
---
BBQ and chilli hilly billy is very hard to beat if they are semi competent
---
I spent probably about 8 hours today playing (finally got a day off and I just recently gave this game a chance, been addicted to it) and had it occur multiple times. I should've counted. But frequently enough early in the day to make me salty and make a post on Reddit about it obviously lmao. that's super strange though, thanks for the input. 
---
I mean to be a neutral voice here, there is no real “winning” it’s your own definition sometimes I view just getting a kill or 2 is winning some think a win is all 4 it depends on what your goal is, its the killers playground is what the games supposed to be
---
No idea. The game’s jankiness can probably be attributed to them not spending a lot on fixing a game people have already bought (which is effed up) and also shenanigans on the griefer/hacker side of things. You’re also more likely to hear from people saying the game effed up instead of all was well. So only BHVR has reliable data and again, it’s probably not in their (sadly finanicially-based) interests to share it.
---
As a killer main I completely agree, they’ve tried to, you loose SOME points from 1 category for camping, its not much so they do need to do more
---
Uh what? Have you ever played aNY Bethesda game?
---
Yes all 4 perks in my first build are teachables from other killers. Brutal Strength is Trapper at lvl 35, Bamboozle is Clown at lvl 30, Fire Up is Freddy at lvl 30, and Ruin is Hag at lvl 35. You can also get in The Shrine of Secrets as well when they appear if you have enough iridescent shards. 
---
The other add-ons I mentioned though work with pretty much any perk in the game if you can't get the perks right away.
---
The one that sorta pisses me off is the one when you jump out the 2 story window and are falling down and the killer still somehow manages to hit you lol
---
I swear at times killers will face camp over anything.
---
You dare to finish a gen in front of me? Face camp! 
---
The chase goes on for over 10 seconds? Face camp!
---
You dare flashlight save a survivor once in the entire game? Face camp!
---
Both sides can be petty,salty, and toxic but with the recent changes these past 6 or so months killer's are now finally being called out as much as survivors now.
---
Whatever it’s on, I’ll take 20.
---
you can use Mori to get Adept.
---
what happened here is a current bug. after last chapter due to, I guess, different connection or something like that, grabbing is fucked. way too many times I'd have few moments of grabbing animation to only injure a survivor in the end. 
---
I thought it was a bug. If that's her new state then that's just terrible. I've been avoiding playing her because of that and the terrible audio when she was my favorite killer before.
---
Lmao, good.
---
What? The game concept hasn’t changed in forever. One killer v. four survivors is the only mode and the maps are practically reskins.
---
&gt; Ah yes, just because I use a mechanic, I'm apparently abusing it and shouldn't do that. ???? 
---
Its mechanic that is abuseable because it isn't meant to allow players to derank all the way from rank 1 to rank 10, if they wanted people deranking like that why would the implement the rank lock? DCing is supposed to punish players by allowing the to derank further than others not because its method of deranking to bully low-rank killers for no good reason.
---
&gt; They're meant to entertain however they want to. 
---
Yes, they are, but by doing it this way they are being assholes for no good reason when there are other ways to be entertaining that have shown to be more effective based on her average popularity and the below average popularity of this group as a whole. This seems to be hurting them more than its helping them currently based on this thread, no?
---
&gt; The whole thread and OP post is referencing Jendenise but I'm sure there are other streamers like her. 
---
There are, and I would criticize them all the same for this type of nonsense. They can do it, but they deserved to be criticized for it, especially since its non-sustainable if the devs aren't clueless and eventually implement a dodge timer that stacks like every other game.
---
Ok. Sure. I hate overarcing narratives butting in to my slasher films too. /s
---
I'd never use the chainsaw near all those walls he needs to switch to the hammer :s
---
fucking exactly
---
if they want the game to be fixed continue the hissy fit and organize but don’t remove the thing that’s keeping the game going...
---
how is it rude?
---
so with that cleansing totems if you got spawned in front of one is also rude?
---
you can control where you go down, might as well not be around hooks, ya know. killers can't control where hexes spawn.
---
i used tombstone and hair and only 1 gen was completed when i got to 3 (The Game Map)  
---
guess i got potatoes?
---
I've only camped twice and both times its when I admit defeat, get shit stomped for 5 gens by good survivors and just want atleast 1 sac. Also sometimes the survivors have a stroke during the rescue and I get a 4K out of nothing. 
---
The offerings are called Memento Mori. They allow a killer who has hooked you at least once to kill you on the spot without carrying to a hook a further time. 
---
Well, I didn't get hooked once so I couldn't die and the killer had knockout so you had to run across the map to look for the slugs that plus ruin and noed gives the killer tons of time so it isn't just "outplay". You are right that they made us suffer tho but literally because they were bored with killing us the normal way.
---
How did you find this post 3 months ago lol
---
I've seen killers who never learn and eat flashlight save after flashlight save and never bat an eye.
---
I have yet to see a killer not face camp EVERYONE in the game if 1 person gets a sabo save, tho
---
It's an offering killers use to be able to kill survivors after being hooked. 
---
That's nice. Not very often though.
---
yeah, I figured people mostly call a killer camper if said was securing a kill after gates powered. 
---
do they not understand it's stupid of killer to leave hook? cause everyone can just leave since no more gens to do.
---
like almost every game due to my altruism or bad luck, I get my first hook when gates are powered. maybe couple times I'd get a Trapper to just leave the hook but mostly any killer stays to camp. and I really don't mind. like... what's wrong with that? 
---
If he refused to kill you all, then you can use whatever time on totems. If he downed everyone, then you guys sucked at getting away. Ruin shouldn't last that long, he's probably never had it that easy.
---
Not to talk shit, because I feel for you, that fucking blows and I try to keep my kills clean and fun. What rank we looking at?
---
i always imagined that since the killer is watching the survivors in the lobby screen, they eventually notice and run away (into the game map), at which point the killer walks to the campfire, burns their offering and pursues the survivors into the map.
---
You may wanna read what OP said more carefully. He never said anything about being held hostage and they could not purposely die because the killer wanted to sorta be a dick and just made all 3 of them bleed out.
---
In the right situation, a lot of perks can turn a 4 man into a 4 escape tbh
---
The most annoying thing about dead hard to me is that more often than not it will not proc, get downed, and be exhausted anyway
---
Part of this game's design is giving the killer at least a little bit of the upper hand going into a match. And if killers weren't able to see that kind of stuff, items would essentially be invincible until they're fully used. That shouldn't happen.
---
Plus, not seeing offerings would just make SWF even more overpowered, since they could just tell each other what offerings they have. I do agree that killer secret offerings should not be shown, though.
---
Thank you!
---
ever since i started climbing with the nurse i cant go back to other killers. Besides maybe the hag every other killer is unplayable
---
cause you don't even talk most matches. 
---
Good job!
---
i got Meat Plant while i was playing Tombstone + Hair.  
---
Didnt end pretty for them.
---
Great I’ll take 20!
---
That knife haha
---
whoa i never knew you could make the text shaky. kinda makes my eyes hurt, but neat!
---
Why do people always pick parts of a game arbitary to reply realism to it? If you were in that situation would you keep walking after being hit? Would you respawn the next time? Would you know the injured status of your teammate in the interface? Would you willing que up for another trial?  
---
The idea of applying realism towards the inbuilt gameplay mechanics is idiotic. Gameplay mechanics are just that and the human mind has suspension of disbelief to filter them out. Thats why you don't stop playing a game in which you die once and reload while keeping your immersion.
---
No, yeah, I did.
---
 I'm saying that bleeding out might very well have been his best bet, if they couldn't counterplay it. Takes the frustration out when you commit to not letting the guy get his toxicity under your skin.
---
 You don't always get the nicest person, and that guy clearly outmatched them, which always sucks. It shouldn't lead to this, but I'm 90% it's not really reportable.
---
Also, none of the addons say that they stack so does that mean if I use a joey's mixtape and a julies mixtap that it wont have the same effect as one cold dirt?
---
Exactly this. Had a killer wraith face camp from the first hook and kill 2 people that way for no reason. When i escaped i tea bagged. Yet killers on this sub said i deserved to be camped for teabagging, *only because he camped in the first place*
---
I saw multiple of these but on the killer side a while back. A Freddy reaches rank 1 and gets like 100 up votes or something.
---
I think people don't wanna admit it but its more or less balanced between the two
---
It's just that the upvotes feature shifts it one way most of the time.
---
It sucks being that guy, but in a lot of cases it's just gg and you missed out on your item and the escape points. Could be way worse mid-match.
---
No one said anything about reporting because it’s not reportable still sorta a dick move though. I think that’s what OP was trying to say 
---
You missed winter gifts, 3k for 7k items
---
ty bro
---
&gt;I feel like you aren't reading what I'm saying. Deranking is supposed to be a punishment, not a reward, she doesn't get punished because she's swf and she's also an actually good survivor so she abuses a mechanic that isn't intended to work the way it is. Its a moderate version of abusing a bug, and it makes the game less fun for other players which is where I draw the line with this nonsense.
---
How is deranking *supposed* to be a punishment? I don't quite understand. BHVR offers no incentive to stay at rank 1. So why does it really matter? It let's me derank to rank 10 and nothing bad happens. I don't see what argument you are trying to make, and don't think you've changed the argument that it falls squarely on BHVRs fault. If it was a bug, I'd expect it to be patched, idk, sometime within the last 2 years?
---
&gt;It is, but it doesn't mean its okay for streamers to encourage behaviour that makes the game less fun for everyone.
---
Again, you're dictating how a streamer streams the game. Her job is to entertain, this will literally be an argument that goes into circles. It's on BHVR for allowing the mechanic.
---
&gt;Where did I say this was okay? You're literally pulling shit out of your ass with this line.
---
You literally said survivors derank to rank 10 to bully low skill killers. Why did not not mention the opposite as well? Killers do the same thing. This all goes back to being a broken mechanic, and hence on BHVR.
---
&gt;Yeah and assholes are assholes, they deserved to be criticized for there nonsense and not get white-knighted when they are obviously in the wrong as you just admitted by saying she's an asshole.
---
Theyre not in the wrong, that's where YOU are wrong. Your anger is misguided, as you see all the other arguments lead back to BHVR being at fault. So you should stop criticizing people for using a mechanic when it could have been fixed anytime within the past few years if it wasn't intended.
---
yes
---
Sorry it took me so long to respond. I haven’t checked reddit in a while. I’m in the US. 
---
Totally agreed. I'm just mentioning that aspect to point out, "yes, it sucks, but it's fair game and in the future you gotta be ready for it, or accept when it's time to pull up something on YouTube and sweat out the bullshit."
---
My bad if it seems like I'm trying to start anything or misrepresent you, OP.
---
Yeah most of the time but it also rewards bad gameplay which is the reason I don’t like it. Same with noed, just brings people to higher ranks than they should be
---
Don’t really have one yet. I’ve tried playing as several. 
---
Oh I see ok I thought you may have read what OP said incorrectly so that was my bad lol
---
I see people comment all the time saying “oh yeah I only face camp if survivors are being toxic, like if they pallet loop, flashlight save, or bodyblock to protect an injured person.”
---
...I’m sorry but what? Do you just want survivors to run in a straight line and die?
---
Usually it’s just poor connection to the host as opposed to hit boxes. If you have even 100 ms (which should be just fine) and you initiate the drop pallet action and within that tenth of a second the killer also swings and gets a hit score, then you will get hit and the killer will get stunned. Depending on how bad your ping is, the window of which both actions may occur simultaneously expands. (If your ping is 500 then you have a half second window, and if your ping is for whatever reason 1000 then you have an entire second of time once you start to throw down the pallet in which you might get hit as if the killer swung through it.) 
---
Hitboxes can be weird but with such a close call like interrupting a swing with a stun it’s more often than not connection issues as opposed to simply bad coding. Hope that helps!
---
Didn’t know how to get that onto here so this is the best I could do
---
Outside of balance the game and optimizing for consoles. I would much rather have new maps. 
---
Pressing shift allows you to run
---
Excellent 😂
---
Omfg this was goodddd!
---
SNIPael Myers
---
*leaves locker* 
---
Me: :) oh boi
---
I'm just looking at it like, yes, I could give a run-down on possible counterstrats that are full of shit, or say I feel for him and fuck that guy. . .
---
Honestly, I just want to give him an understanding that these things happen, and happens when the killer can outplay each of you individually, (meta perks or no, lag being the big variable) and nobody would blame him for just stepping away for a bit and saying "Whatever happens, happens."
---
Seems more like a typo than a bone apple tea
---
Too EZ. But yeah all those walls I wouldn't chainsaw.
---
please make more clips like this, it was really funny lol
---
That's true, but any company with even marginally intelligent management will see the long-term profits and benefits exceeding the short term ones.  I'm not saying BHVR is or isn't conscientious about their playerbase, but at this rate, players are going to continue leaving the game in droves (on console at least) because the game is flooded with issues.  
---
Not that it matters, but I personally stopped playing because even though I love this game, I'd rather play ones that actually function consistently. Why would I play DBD in this state when there's games like Red Dead 2, Spiderman, God of War, Black Ops 4, etc.? The state they left the game in before their holiday break is shameful.
---
There's no point in putting out DLC/cosmetics if no one's there to buy it for a broken game.
---
Then the problem is you. Stop tunneling and face camping and you won't get salty survivors.
---
I've gotten as much GGs as hate mail. The only time I get hate mail is when I be a dick to the survivor that was being a dick.
---
My first time playing against the pig be like
---
I'm rank 10 right now, but i think you are underestimating how much they were able to stall the game. We got ruin not too long into the game but having to look for slugs while a huntress with good aim is constantly downing then ditching isn't outplay.
---
So they'll catch up to you but it'll be super annoying
---
Anytime my buddy who I play with gets Mori’d I’m like “Hah dumb bitch”
---
Then when I get mori’d im like “Oh, me the bitch.”
---
All I could hear was “MINE MINE MINE MINE MINE”
---
You could say he is addicted.
---
It’s just manners at this point 
---
Flair is appropriate. This is a shit post
---
People only ever decided to hate bloodhound when legion came out, before that it was an ok perk.
---
Fair enough. You can usually extract it easily with a USB and I think even upload it to youtube from ps4
---
Once again, that's just my own personal opinion on the matter. This obviously seemed like a different situation. 
---
I think we need option to disable end chat. This happens so often.
---
I didn't see the match, man. I couldn't tell you what went wrong. Sorry, not trying to take your rant away from you.
---
Uh. . . okay:
---
If you want a shot in the dark, you'd need to be good at chasing with the Huntress already, and have 2 teammates that are also competent.
---
Empathy directly counters Knock-Out, and picking and choosing your times to pick people up and when to hoof it to a safer place is also really important. You can't control your teammates, either. 
---
SwF pretty much wrecks their strat entirely. 
---
Wait what are they planning to do with the legion?
---
Lol I feel you, I had a fellow survivor dc Bc their offering was overtaken by mine
---
I mean at rank 13 i had a nurse dc cuz i was looping around a truck with no pallet. Sometimes killers are just bad.
---
Yeah fiber 4real, other games I get a few ping. But this is just weird.
---
The next killer will bring in more people than are leaving the game now. Atleast without coming back once it is fixed. They have way more money to invest then ever before now that skin shop exists.
---
But I am the killer!
---
Haha nah I play both, I just like to give comedic content to the forum
---
If teabagging bothers you, I can imagine how badly end game chat must destroy you.   Find another game or get used to it.  
---
I actually pallet stunned a legion in frenzy and they dc :/ first time i ever made a killer dc (unless there was a bug that caused that)
---
Good luck with that, 90% of survivors with TTV in their name disconnect when downed the first or second time. 
---
Too EZ. Yeah I main both killer and survivor so I understand both sides of the salt and boi is there plenty of salt everywhere.
---
Yup, pretty much sums it up. 
---
As a rank 1 killer main i find this to be true
---
It should have been “me watching a team mate get Mori’d and the happy dude and the it should have said me when a second team mate gets mori’d for the sad dude because you know that means he has a red mori 
---
I mean I stream SWF all the time. 
---
Why not just play the perks you like?
---
I just wish I knew that reporting people for being racist would actually do something. I exited end chat before I could write down their names to report to steam. I'm just so mad. I just don't understand how people can say some of the things that they do. It's not funny. It's not "cool." You're being a dick. It just makes me want to only play KYF and never deal with random people, which is frustrating because I really enjoy this game. 
---
Its the best of the best, never seen someone with a higher mbps 
---
Ouch. 
---
Or you could not be triggered by a game mechanic that's been in gaming history for decades
---
Fucking pepega 
---
It's not like we're directly insulting you. 
---
My guy, connection speeds go into GBps...
---
They might be far enough from you that ping isn't going to be good.
---
Are you a penguin or wallaby?
---
Killer games for me are always much more stressful than survivor, even if I get tunneled and die instantly and frustration is different.
---
Oh thank God. I'm makes some eggs and bacon but am out of salt luckily you showed up. Jokes aside you sir or madam are correct.
---
  You keep mentioning that it's just a game and it should not effect you emotionally, but you can inferring to playing the game with determination to win the objective by whatever means necessary. Is that not an emotion, a drive to win? It's a game, a game where both oppositions want to succeed. Taunting, like in any instance, is frustrating, especially when paired with mistakes or losses. This is why tilting is a strategy, you are playing a devil's advocate. It makes them preform worse. What makes this style of behavior unacceptable is that your robbing the pure joy out of competition. It makes defeat feel especially bitter. It's the intention to make fun of or insult that you consciously do when you t-bag that makes it hurt. It is a nonverbal communication to the player. You might as well shout, "Hey, you're garbage." over a com at them. It's the same effect. This style of play can be effective, but it makes you a shitty person and ultimately you bog down the community who surrounds it. Don't be shocked that people have emotions in games, not everyone can be as apathetic and heartless as you. I hope you find another hobby for attention seeking.
---
But it shouldn’t be worth it your just suiciding most likely he doesn’t even notice or even care that you disrespected him it just means you got yourself killed XD but hey survivors will do anything to disrespect their opponents because respect doesn’t exist in DBD it’s just a lawless wasteland of a game 
---
Sounds like someone has some gitting gud to do.
---
I live in europe, their pings are 50ish
---
Not that I do it, but I always thought that if people just stream sniped them and killed them they might quit the game or putting twitch in their name.
---
Hehe
---
I like BBQ, Sloppy, Bloodhound and Rancor
---
You're*
---
My life priorities are a lot better than someone who has to defend twitch thots. 
---
Know what's actually stupid? 
---
* Putting "chick" in quotes as if somehow being female is in question.
---
* Defending making a living through twitch. 
---
Can't wait until they bring back the ability to stun Nurse mid-blink
---
This isn't funny, you just sound like an entitled asshat. 
---
What disrespect him or the killer because if it’s to disrespect your brother then that’s pretty fucking funny 
---
Yeah, I agree that the next killer will bring a wave of new people, but if the poor performance continues, people will hop on, see the new killer, and then go back to not playing when they realize how bad it still runs.  This is assuming that the killer is fun enough to even warrant investigating.  If they release another Legion-like killer they're just going to dig themselves deeper into the hole they're already in.  
---
For me, it's sorta like games that have daily login rewards.  They're a great short term fix to maintaining a playerbase, but if your game has fundamental problems (be they functionality issues or lack of innovational updates) it won't be long before people don't even value those incentives enough to boot up a broken game. 
---
I love cosmetics personally, but there's no point in buying more cells so I can get the Santa Clown or other cosmetics I'd like if I can't even use them in a stable game.  I would suspect that many people feel the same way.  Not everyone of course, but many.
---
You have a valid point with Blizzard and EA, but as the old argument with BHVR goes: they're a smaller company with smaller amounts of consumers and smaller profits.  While I'm sure they are still making lots of money, they can financially afford to make less mistakes than one of those other gaming company titans.  On the bright side for them, at least it appears they aren't even bothering to worry about Deathgarden anymore lol.
---
On a side note... bist du deutsch dann? Cool. Ich wusste das nicht.
---
she needs a better ambush to be a viable killer 
---
I have literally had killers flame me in the chat and call me toxic/bad for looping them a little. And I'm mediocre at looping, plus I never tbag lol. 
---
Same on Pig. 
---
&gt;  I’m just mad that ... dbd only favors killer mains.
---
lol
---
It ain't easy being a killer in these streets, but we could all stand to be nicer. 
---
ps. fucking toxic survivor mains
---
n o. 
---
I absolutely understand their push for content but I've always felt like new chapters every three months are too much, for me anyway! I feel like I still barely have a handle on clown and then spirit is so new and now there's legion... Aah!! 
---
That's just my perspective though, and I know ppl who play more than a couple days a week are more hungry for more content, but yes, I'd also prefer to see more time between new content. Maybe a new zone for a classic map every once in a while? Or a new paragraph here and there?
---
? I learned the game playing Killer and got to rank 1 as killer in under 100 hours back when there were less hooks and they were permadestroyed if you sabo'd them and there was more pallets in the maps. I enjoyed the challenge back then and generally it was fun to play against good killers cause of it.
---
Nowadays if I'm even remotely trying I can easily 3-4k people, although it is lower ranks since I deranked all the way down due to inactivity. It's pretty rare that I don't pip/double pip as killer atm just cause a mixture of player skill and honestly just that it doesn't take much of a brain to play killer anymore outside of Huntress and Nurse (and I personally struggle playing Pig but I don't think she's hard, just a playstyle thing).
---
I see the salty killer main :)
---
"suck this medkit bitch"
---
I like to stand at the edge to wait and see if any of my teammates go down. I also like making the killer come hit me out just because it gives us both BP. I usually only wait long enough to heal up, though. 
---
It was the map with the big gas station in the middle. Maybe I'm not explaining it very well but the killer didn't camp or anything they just downed and moved on. The problem for us was that it took 20-30s to find whoever got downed and had to heal them to full while the killer was already on another person. The most she ever got downed at once was two and when the gates got powered only i was down but i ran adrenaline. 
---
I run urban and love hiding. I'm also a fucking gen jockey to the max lol
---
This is high quality
---
You don't have to like read end game chat, if they're being especially toxic in-game just leave immediately it's better for your mental health imo
---
I'm not saying you even need to do either of those, just listing two direct counters. Why the words in my mouth?
---
What I said is if you and the guys you queued with knew what to do and played well, the amount of downs and inability to immediately find people isn't actually that bad. It'd be 1-2 people down at a time at most, and at least one of you guys can usually see the Huntress at any time in most maps. Slugs can also crawl to high traffic areas if the killer refuses to hook, you just have to avoid rushing to lift them and hope everyone else gets the idea too.
---
People who play different require different approaches, and you can't expect to know what to do the first time. You'll do better next time, or you can throw your hands up and let it happen if it's that infuriating.
---
Side note: lots of people run Empathy. You usually don't have to, but I'm letting you know there's a high chance someone in that match rushed to save with it and sped up what doomed your team.
---
I do very well when I play as Freddy. Normally 3-4K every match.  Playing killer has never been easier than it is now 
---
Sure you did man. Whatever you say. You totally sound like a killer main. 
---
My explanation is that either he's deaf or the sound glitched and he thought you 360d him.
---
Killers = salty 
---
Survivors = toxic 
---
Killer main BTW
---
Since every character has the same lunge, Shorter killers like legion and freddy will look much longer than say, a trapper or huntress lunge
---
They probably got fuck all in points, then. Good on them for finding anyone, honestly.

Why are you jealous that you dont have fiber? Loser, downvote someone else
---
Are you saying the doctor drives you... *insane?*
---
Yeah, I get that. And I do. I try to ignore them. But I feel like if you report someone for throwing around racist slurs, something should happen. I get that people report over the tiniest things, but certain reports should be taken seriously. I think you're going to have a lot of people quit if they continuously get slurs thrown at them in end game chat. 
---
Even copper can get 100Mb/s in cat 5e and 1Gb/s in cat 6 fiber does upwards of 10Gb/s
---
it's not nearly as hard to kill as a year ago *shrug*
---
imagine BNP fixing a gen within few seconds. amount of pallets, pallet vacuum, the healing that would take just 20 seconds to finish. no Bamboozle so you HAD to get T, L-wall, shack looped for ages. 
---
yet there was less killers who camped and tunneled so much cause in previous state of the game it would hurt much more. now killers can afford these two and still not lose a bunch of gens. 
---
I do get salty meeting several toxic swfs in a row but then I remember how much I got bullied being a Freddy main before Curtain Calls and I suck it up. 
---
Like, I would be content if they just awarded us like 1000 shards for red rank, 750 for purple 500 for green 250 for yellow and none for brown. But that’s never gonna happen. 
---
Yeah the report system might as well not exist in dbd from what I understand they don't even look at cases until they have like 5 reports 
---
Yep, I am german. Thing is, Behaviour _is actively working_ on fixing it. They just won't abandon their release schedule to do just the fixing.
---
I laughed, i love when killers just want to do goofy things like this and not be so sweaty. 
---
You said the killer just outplayed us so I thought you were gonna tell me what we did wrong but not having the right perks and not being in a call is out of our control. Rushing to save isn't what doomed us, not clearing all totems after spending 20 minutes doing gens and looking for slugs is what doomed us.
---
&gt;Because players are supposed to want to be high rank, and not be at a lower rank than their supposed to. That's inherently obvious.
---
There's simply no incentive to be high rank so your argument falls flat on the ground. There's no difference between being rank 1 or rank 10. Maybe they should give end of season rank 1 rewards? Still falls on BHVR.
---
&gt;Yeah a lot of the blaim falls on BHVR, but the streamer deserves to be critisized for taking advantage of a faulty system to be an asshole so that they can somehow be "entertaining". If the only way for you to be entertaining is to be an asshole than you aren't worth anybodies time, but inevitably they attract like-minded assholes of which there seem to be plenty.
---
&gt;Argument is not worthwhile, I gave you examples of other big streamers who make tons of money and are still assholes. You can't dictate how a person runs their stream whether you think it's "right or wrong". Argument is not worthwhile.
---
&gt;Because the opposite being true is also not okay and ruins games for newer survivors, this doesn't add anything new to the argument.
---
That's fine, as long as you are acknowledging that both sides exploit it. More evidence that it's a BHVR problem.
---
&gt;Now you're calling it a broken mechanic, from just calling it a mechanic. So we agree they are abusing this now, correct?
---
No, there's nothing wrong with using a "broken" mechanic. A mechanic is still a mechanic. It doesn't work but it's not a bug or anything so it's legitimately fair to use. BHVR not fixing it over the last few years proves it's fine to use. Any counter argument other than blaming a single streamer for using it because you don't like it?
---
&gt;"If the teacher isn't looking its okay for a student to bully another student"
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Man, this is a childish argument. I'm done with this, the white-knights for this streamer don't seem to want to admit that the streamer can do wrong, go figure.
---
You seem to be blaming the streamer a lot, when it's a mechanic in the game. All the rest of our arguments lead back to BHVR. The fact that you don't realize your anger is misguided and keep blaming one single streamer is illogical. All the evidence displayed here shows you should be mad at BHVR. The fact that you are avoiding coming to that conclusion shows who the real childish one is.
---
Dude saaaaame. I wanna play her again so much because she is my favorite killer but the devs took a giant shit on the audio.
---
Yeah you're not alone. It's really bad right now. Good thing rank east is a bit to happen. Or I would be pissed about rank right now.
---
OwO who’s there
---
This is good. This is very, very good.
---
The quickest exposed in the west
---
If pewdiepie was trying to cause a stir, I wouldn't know, but the nazi thing; he doesnt really support him anymore and there isnt any real proof that he is a nazi. It's possibly more edgy humor. It seems youre just making assumptions and Im not saying that you're wrong, but there are other possibilities.
---
Yeah name one provider that servees 10 gb internet connectjons for private use, lol 
---
Ofc nasa and other instituioms reach those numbers, for consumers 100 mbps is top tier
---
My favourite is when the killer hits you as you stun them with the pallet, then magically appears on the same side as you and hits you again.
---
You answered your own question survivor is super chill to play in my experience i can actually knock out like 5 games in a row as survivor because it’s not stressful at all but as killer you have to be firing on all cylinders and working your ass off I can barely play more then 2 games as killer because it just doesn’t feel good I just recently tried playing without ruin I barely had time to think and boom 2 gens done and I only just downed a person and for that reason I play survivor when I want more bloodpoints
---
Also if we got SOMETHING for devotion levels. Everytime I cap and level up, it’s like a kick to the cunt and I get less shards all over a-fucking-gain :(
---
I don't condone those actions. Especially not the racist slurs.  You can't control what others will do or say, just how you react to it.  As long as there is an end game chat, someone will end up saying things that you don't like or agree with so instead of trying to make it a battle of moral superiority, just move on to the next game.  Remember, it's just a game and those are only words.   
---
You always do totems if you see them.
---
If you're just mad about NOED, then you guys could have done better with that. Regardless of the situation, there was definitely time early on for everyone to get one, and late game to find another.
---
As for what I said, yes, all of that led to NOED getting under the radar. Slugging with no intention to hook is a bad strat, and you guys fell into the loop of constantly going for saves and letting her pressure you out.
---
I don't know what else to tell you. I play Solo or with my brother, and I've yet to lose to a pure slug build, and only occassionally can't find NOED or break 3 totems myself.
---
What’s ETC?
---
I’m also super tired of these posts
---
Like, do people think people have never made it to rank 1 before?
---
Cool, I didn't know many Germans really played DBD.  
---
And yeah, I know they say they're actively working on it. I'm hopeful they'll sort it out, it's just a question of when.  From what I've heard, with the way the game was initially created the coding was a bit of a ticking time bomb.  Given how much the popularity has (rather unexpectedly) exploded, it's obvious they weren't prepared.  
---
I'm not for them completely skipping over a whole release quarter with a new killer, but I'd prefer they bump everything back by like... a month or so to try to make at least *some* noticeable progress towards alleviating the game's current problems before more inevitably come from the next content update.  I don't think it will be completely resolved after that time, nor does it need to be, but just *some* stability so that I don't get a migraine every time I try to play killer.
---
Well that sucks
---
Thanks bro!
---
F
---
Yes, d MNM imu
---
Cuz they’re trash and realized we were fucking them
---
Imagine tbagging having this much control over your emotions
---
Devour or myc 
---
The teabagging didn't. The racist slurs did. 
---
While others have already answered your question, a brief reminded that [we have a glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/glossary).
---
True enough. I think that's mostly because of latency issues though. 
---
I would be happy if the Dev wouldn't be like. "WE DONT PATCH ANYTHING UNLESS ITS ONE OF THE 8 YEARLY PATCHES! NO HOTFIXES. NO SMALL PATCHES!" This is so stupid. 
---
Yeah I agree. Especially with a multiplayer game.  I don't really know how small patches/hotfixes work, but I'm fairly confident that patches on consoles have to go through authorization processes that cost a fair bit of money, which would explain why they limit themselves to so few compared to other online games.  I'm not sure if there's a window of time where they can push out hotfixes for free/reduced costs or if they always cost money.
---
Even still, the opportunity cost of letting game-breaking bugs run rampant is too great to ignore.  Like right now, there's an insane amount of bugs, especially compared to any other game I play, but for most people none are completely game-breaking (minus the occasional random crashes many have been experiencing). Right now, on console especially, they're more just debilitating than catastrophic.
---
But yeah. I think 8 patches should be a baseline goal, not a limited threshold.
---
You were lagging a bit but this is just a dumb killer or he's memeing 
---
I literally said it irks me. It's a stupid way to play. But that's just my personal feelings. It doesn't piss me off like the racist slurs. That's what get me. And you could listen to me on voice chat. I mostly don't talk. When I do, it's more because I get jump scared by survivors haha I'm not a good killer and I know that...because I'm learning how to play. I really didn't get mad until end chat, when they said what they said. I didn't reply to them. I did report all of them. But it pisses me off because I don't see a point. They're going to continue to spout racist garbage at random people because they're probably horrible human beings. I know there's nothing I can do. It's still just disappointing to me. 
---
Lmao, nice way to assume a ton of shit about me just because you don't agree with what I'm saying. Real good idea there, buddy.
---
SWF completely negates and undermines a ton of shit that this game is specifically designed around. It's got nothing about me being mad at SWF, rather how it completely changes the game.
---
And yeah. I'm right about items. Killers would have really no way to counter items other than taking that one Doctor perk. Woohoo. If you don't like losing your items to Franklin's, don't take items. 
---
Yeah, because the survivor secret offerings don't affect jack shit about how the killer plays. Survivors see a killer secret offering? They immediately assume a mori and change their playstyle accordingly.
---
I'm also right about the lobby being designed to give the killers that slight edge before the match. Once again, the killer is meant to have the power. Not the survivors. You will do just fine losing your toolbox a few times. You do not need that extra incentive to decide between a purple toolbox with decent add-ons or a yellow flashlight.
---
Lmfao
---
Wouldn’t it be fucking cool if they had a reward like reach level 50 devotion get a 5th perk slot lol. Would be hell to grind for and break the game but it would drive everyone to play constantly lol 
---
Hello yeah 
---
Wifi is garbage, it doesnt matter if you have 200 mbps on that, its unreliable and is interval based. Your 200 mbps wifi connections is the same like 2 mbps fiber connection lol.
---
Yeah
---
I was also skeptical about whether the guy was truly a white supremacist or not, but it seemed like several people were digging into his history and comments, and he seemed to be pretty serious on at least appealing to that audience.
---
I don't hate Pewds or anything, I just feel like he's constantly making some pretty bad decisions, and his responses have not gotten any better. I normally feel people will go too hard on people for not being politically correct, and will generally defend a person's right to be controversial, but Pewd's recent stuff just seems like he's going the wrong direction, IMO.
---
Wouldn’t it be fucking cool if they had a reward like reach level 50 devotion get a 5th perk slot lol. Would be hell to grind for and break the game but it would drive everyone to play constantly lol
---
I'm only complaining about them dragging the game out. I still don't get what you mean by letting her pressure us out, do you mean we shouldn't rush to find them and just do gens/totems? I can't see that doing anything other than allowing her to down two or three people to get 2 gens done or 3/4 totems but at that point we might just out right lose.
---
Atleast shit like Wraith+Sloppy Butcher = unplayable on console is something they should fucking hotfix. If not the balance issues or goofy bug, the fully gamebreaking shit shouldn't be delayed till "next big patch".
---
Its because you're uneducated and have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Here is something to read for you:
---
https://www.fastmetrics.com/how-fast-is-fiber-optic-internet.php
---
I’m the killer and it still spoils me..
---
What kinda of internet do you get there? My WiFi is pretty damn stable at 190-210MBps it only ever drops when my ISP does the weekly restart
---
Hey, atleast they try to improve the game.
---
I have two ideas one make it so the killer who brought the hex can place the hex down inside a unlit totem or make totems have skill checks and take much longer  
---
Hey guys! So  [/u/gingismaximus123](https://www.reddit.com/u/gingismaximus123)  and I talked about this killer idea (he was the last survivor I drew!) and we workshopped it. Sadly it isn't as high quality as my last idea posts, lately I've been anxious as all hell and it's been hindering my work. BUT, I've been really hoping to draw this. The idea for this killer is a similar to Doctor, and Clown someone to roam and be able to find survivors utilizing one of the least worked features, crows! I think it'd be really cool to be ansy about where you are in the map and how long you work on a gen with the potential of "Impatient Flock" giving away your position, and Hex: Agoraphobia would make survivors rely on Independence until they can find the totem. Suggestions are more than welcome! Thanks!
---
Thats what you think, lets compare pings in different games, you'll see.
---
Bump, I'm intrigued (Legion main since their release) 
---
we all get these moments, op.
---
those who tell you to suck it up were the ones to creat same posts week, month, year ago. they desensitised to salt and BM and forgot their own rage. 
---
I don't believe for a second they never felt bad after getting flamed in the chat when they already lost the game. personally, I'm still being salty sometimes. mostly cause of end chat too. because it doesn't matter if they were toxic in game, what matters is if the toxicity within roles we take(killer/survivor) is enough to not keep on being a cunt when it's just players with no roles talking. cause to me it's the point of gaming - you remove your frustration through actual game. how bad must one feel to continue in chat? 
---
to slurs: report them by submitting a ticket on dbd support page. provide screenshots, don't forget player IDs. they do look into those.
---
to chat: you can click &gt;&gt; near "send" icon to hide the chat. very recommend for the last game of the night. 
---
You do understand ping is based on location to the server right? And even so I get about a 15-16 latency to my server 
---
What's wrong with Legion? The design is perfectly fine. I think BHVR has done a good job getting a killer that is actually putting some pressure on survivors unlike many other killers. Atleast it ain't a Freddy.
---
Actually how much a video game costs up-front can be irrelevant in our F2P world because of the rise of DLC and in-game purchases. AND $20 dollars spread over 3 consoles WORLDWIDE with a lot of cosmetics thrown in is probably pretty freakin' golden. Story mode could be as simple as a fighting game's story mode, you maybe end at level 50 or prestige rank three (or some other bloodpoint sink that gives you an ultimate cosmetic or alt-color or something, like the prestiges) with some sort of dumb cutscene that shows some concept art and "the battle continues," or there's a a very tiny chance if you play as one of the killers a lot you'll come across a survivor who plays as one of the characters relative to someone's backstory (like Rin vs. her father), I don't know, I'm not getting paid to know and grow this game. As it stands now a lot of the new character stories are pretty duckin' lame, it's not that hard to write an interesting backstory to make people like and want their DLC more.
---
Your connection is garbage. Wifi per definition doesnt even come in the realm of fiber. Read what professionals sat not what your local scsmmer  told you when he provided you the 1+1 50 dollars a month 'super package'. Lmao.
---
Read what professionals say:
---
Nice upload speed btw, 12 mbps hahahahah
---
Your upload speed is what I ran in 1997. Garbage. With your 200 mbps wifi quality aka 2 mbps fibre or 5 mbps cable. Get real and get something reliable, uneducated idiot.
---
Well not every perk is going to be a home run, I just thought it was cool
---
Okay yeah but what if we did cleanse? What if the killer was just waiting for the moment to hit him down? What do we do then? I guess I'll whine more about it on reddit because I don't know what I'm talking about.
---
Try over a window and almost around the corner. 
---
Yeah, I've heard that and seen other players say that. That stuff doesn't bother me. I know what I am and how I play. I can't stand people who say racist/sexist bullshit. That's what pisses me off to no end. 
---
You're responding to yourself, do you even know how ti use reddit? :D
---
Next to being uneducated about internet options, now its usage of social media? Whats next? You suck at dnd too?

Noob3 is a good survivor and has some good content. Monto plays both and is decent at either. ZubatLEL is a lot more focused on twitch but he has a youtube channel as well, he's the best killer I've seen and is one of the better survivors out there.
---
If I wanted to use wired I'd just walk the 2 feet and plug it up but I can't be bothered and I get a fine enough connection as is also I don't understand how you don't understand how 200MBps on fibre and 200MBps on WiFi are literally the same speed the only difference is that WiFi is less reliable, the article you shared just said on average Fibre is faster...
---
did you submit a ticket? https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000556983-How-do-I-submit-a-support-ticket- 
---
in-game reports don't do much but they look into tickets. pretty strict with racial slurs. 
---
to killers, you'll get better when you find a killer that you really like, who's power you enjoy. then you won't care for kills and that's actually a mean to winning. even not getting kills is a win if you enjoyed the game.
---
Bro rank does not equate to skill. You'll never see streamers like Jen in yellow or brown ranks, where players are actually newer players. Red ranks actually seem to have shittier players than purple or green because the experienced players are prone to downranking. 
---
Also, with the beautiful creation that is Legion (/s), it's practically impossible to depip as killer. You'll see a lot more shittier killers moving up the ladder easily because of playing stupid Legion. 
---
I use bloodhound, nurse's calling, sloppy butcher and the last one is my wildcard
---
Brother that's prox camping. And at least with face camping the killer gets punished by loosing bp, when they prox camp they don't lose bp and still accomplishes the task of camping. That's toxic, it's exploiting the game for gay strats 
---
200 mbps with drops in between meaning on average a 200 mbps wifi connection is the same like a 2 mbps fibre connection.
---
Whats the use of internet if you habe unreliable trash.
---
Lol, 12 mbps upload speed btw. Do you live in 1999?
---
My dream. I'm at rank 10
---
Seems great but would he not be countered by the perk that makes crowd chill? Assuming a survivor ran that
---
just my take here; honestly both sides - killer and survivor - can be pretty toxic/salty because they take things personally. i've done this myself but it's something i'm trying to improve on. for whatever reason dbd has, and still is, full of this. you just deal with it 
---
I have actual fiber yeah, go be jealous somewhere else
---
My sides hurt. That hey you come here in sync with Legion's mori is amazing.
---
And then there's invisible killer besides Freddy and Wraith
---
I don't think you out quite understand what you're talking about, in order for my 200MBps to be like 2MBps it'd have to be 2MBps, the lowest I've ever seen my internet is 120Mbps 10Mbps upload

I had a 1v1 yesterday, I was the killer, let the guy out, downed him a bunch of times and let him struggle, he ran around dropping all the pallets, still de-pipped -.-
---
That isn’t right where is the LVL 10 Hitman?
---
Other than empathy/swf you said crawl to high traffic areas, choose when to save and a few things about the randoms. Everyone that got downed healed and then crawled to whoever was closest to them, I don't know how waiting to save makes the situation better for us since the huntress never guarded her slugs so I need you to explain that to me a little more and I can't do anything about randoms. Not trying to call you out or anything just having a hard time seeing what I could have done to keep the killer from dragging out the game. Also, i did 2/3 totems and i didn't pop the last gen and i was also checking every spot for totems as I ran around to pick up slugs.
---
Sounds like input lag on the tv. Is your tv in game mode? Some tvs have terrible input lag for games. I mean TERRIBLE.
---
The killer gamer is easy enough without more buffs! By the time you die you have a decent idea what they are running if you've paid attention to whats gone on so this seems like an unnecessary extra buff
---
I didn't. I forgot to write down their names after I reported them and immediately left chat. Thanks though. I'll save this in case it happens again. And I do have a few killers I like to play. I definitely have fun most of the time I play this game. It's a good 90% fun games to 10% horrible players. 
---
Salty survivor mains
---
I play on ps4 and have been having the same problem. I normally play with 1 other person and it always seems like the killer leaves. So you're not alone
---
Here's a link to another one that has a chart for consistency and my results
---

---
Lots of loops and quick turns to lose the killer. Also usually 2 pallets. You can also jump from the second floor to activate balanced landing, and you also have lockers on all floors to hide from bbq and chili. 
---
aqz#"1#*€*1
---
Why do you think killer is easy? Have you tried going up against a 4 man swf who all know what they're doing and are running meta opens I against your cannibal or your wraith? You're gonna want your blood warden or noed to actually work...
---
I got less than a handful of crashes and long loading screens but I just always attributed that to my connection never the game. 
---
Go for it
---
ok thanks for the advice then I'll just run empathy and small game in case I run into this again.
---
Ur link didnt work
---
Advice: go play with ur trash connection dummy, and educate yourself about fiber. 
---
Kid gamer who runs WiFi, lmao
---
am i getting wooshed here
---
I get sensory overload if I have 2 noises at the same time. So I usually just mute the stream and watch it while I play. I just don't take this game seriously anymore and now I can actually have fun.
---
No not that many, completely useless to bring more than 2
---
Everything's coming up ACES 
---
(sorry, got triggered by the P!AtD reference)

I hope you actually learn what you're talking about some day &lt;3
---
Worst i have seen yet, congrats.
---
I guess.
---
jesus that shit tilts me even as killer
---
I do. Its why I have fiber connection and have had 0 internet issues ever since, and download 100 gb files within minutes.
---
You on the other hand have wifi connection, trash, unreliable, garbage. And you're a gamer? Lmao. Also u literally have 12 mbps upload speed, thats so sad.
---
I mean 2 gens left is probably why...
---
Clearly you do have issues or you wouldn't have made this post 🤔
---
Thats DnD, not my internet.
---
love the artwork!
---
And 12Mbps is a fine upload speed for day to day if I need to upload anything I'll just walk over 10 feet and plug in my Ethernet cord, I just don't like the clutter 
---
I feel like it is a good thing when it gives away the perks of the killer. Gives the killers more reason to switch it up from time to time. The stream thing doesn't seem that big of a problem to me since usually, the survivor would be at a bigger disadvantage whem they get streamsniped than the killer would be. Also, if you don't want the posibility to get streamsniped, either don't stream or don't use your stream name
---
I played Sloppy Butcher Wraith one game yesterday. Forgot about the bug and after game survivors complained about blood splatter and feame issues. (on pc even) Told them what caused it and apologized since I actually forgot it caused that bug. They were nice about it and not suprised about dbd being like this. I quote: "Bugs like this. Only in dbd"
---
Youre responding to.yourself again you dumb fuck. Learn how to usr reddit just like how you need 2 learn about internet connections.
---
No 12 mbps isnt fine. Its absolute garbage.
---
What flavor?
---
Upload speed? unless you're uploading a fuckign movie it doesn't matter 
---
No it actually isn’t
---
Omg that’s me!
---
I'm just getting back into the game and I've been playing Wraith, too. It was the first and only killer I ever really played. I run Sloppy Butcher and NOED plus some combination from Bitter Murmur, Whispers, and Shadowborn. I just got BBQ, though, so that may change.  
---
  
---
I'm sure that my build isn't optimal and my total lack of add ons is tough, too. After I got back under lvl 10, I stopped getting 20k+ each game... Feels like it's time to learn nurse or Billy... 
---
Nurse has a gas mask?
---
Pallet blinding can work depending on what the killer does after the blind. Some will stand and listen for where you go, others will simply walk forward or they will swing during the blind. When killers walk forward, this is considered a good time to juke the killer by running at them. In the other two scenarios, it’s incredibly risky pulling this tactic. 
---
my dream is to forever stay on purple ranks but it's too hard to not rank up. purple ranks are perfect. you get lobbies fast, you get diverse swfs, sometimes challenging, sometimes easy randoms. best time.
---
Bojack Horseman
---
The sadist who came up with this is also the one who hates his creation 😂
---
How did this happen? 
---
That buff is trash, it has to have a 100% success rate and instantly finish all generators, open both exits, and indefinitely stun every killer in every match. (/s btw)
---
I'm pretty sure teabagging is directly insulting. If it's not meant to convey disrespect, what is it the intended meaning?
---
What happened if you tried to go to the inside of the wall? 
---
imagine dying to a stoopid gun banana smh
---
only fools swing or go forward unless they know it's where they need to go anyway. 
---
blinding is not a pro tip. it only works if you're a de-ranked cunt bullying baby killers. it's literally spreading toxicity. 
---
(honestly though, if you see him, your character is not allowed to move so you just gotta watch him comin' and hope he doesn't see you CUZ HE SO HONGRY)
---
Got picked up by the killer by a pallet, then they got pallet slammed while I was on their shoulders and I glitched into the wall when he got stunned
---
Thank god the devs listened to us:D
---
So facecamping the first person you down is justified? Look, the gates are open and you got a survivor on a hook. There’s no much a killer can do, that’s not the problem. I can’t speak for the pc version but on console, survivors don’t have this unfair advantage you’re speaking of. I’m sure we can agree that DBD without the chases, is a really boring game. 
---
That moment when your killer and you get hit by a pallet youre clearly not under.
---
Probably goes to Starbucks
---
Now this is epic!
---
I don't think people realise that character designers and artists and people that can fix the game are two separate teams, so if they don't make new characters the artists are gonna chip in on bug fixes too? :p
---
That'd be a cool event. Love me some cyber punk cosmetics for Nea and the Legion (and really everyone else). 
---
Thanks extortionist, very cool
---
"You wan't to not get caught without using stupidly good perks and actually use the map and the tools provided to you via gameplay? Toxic cunt."
---
I seriously don't understand people complaining about playing the game in a normal way. tbh nowadays if you get a game where the survivors don't loop you at all you're either just starting out, or you're extremely lucky in matchmaking.
---
Interesting... and you couldn’t move/crouch out of it? 
---
Appart from the joke, I feel like they make a good point, no mither starting out healthy, but not being able to heal during the match feels like the best choice, at least then you'd be able to use the ability to recover from the dying state
---
It’s really bad on Xbox and PS4, I never played on pc which is why I stated that first I’m a console player. 
---
Blinding spreading toxicity? It’s just a flashlight chill dude. Look blinding is a tactic that can work depending on the situation. It won’t work in all situations, but it can work.
---
It’s another survivor you can play once you unlock the hag DLC I believe. 
---
Yeah it wouldn’t let me do anything except heal and spin around. Luckily it was just kill your friends, so we had a good laugh at it
---
I switched to this now: SelfCare / Lightweigth / IronWill 
---
Would you recomend an exhaustion Perk or QnQ at the last slot ?
---
^don't ^mind ^me ¡just ^fixing ^this ^gen
---
#HOOOOOOONK
---
It is allowed but people will probably downvote you, either way you can also try r/dbdlfg
---
The upstairs has at least one very safe pallet, usually it spawns right next to the gen as well. There are multiple windows upstairs that vault you outside the shop, forcing the killer to vault after you or take a very long way around. Downstairs always has 1-2 pallets, and most of them are safe. Besides looping, the high ground means you can see the killer coming from a mile away, and there are 4 pathways you can take to escape from the generator... down the stairs, off the broken side, down the hallway, or into the center room to hide/ jump down the hole in the center. Very easy to evade the killer there.
---
ruin, bamboozle, brutal strength and any other perk of your choice, these are good perks because they help him during chase where he is weak af
---
I am very happy that it was a haunted grounds totem
---
Oh very true!! Though as a Claudette main I would be sad I couldn’t Ninja Vanish as easily in the corn 😂
---
Impatient Flock:
---
Crows spawn 30%/40%/50% faster when idle, or staying in one area.
---
Additionally, crows also will spawn when repairing generators.
---
Essentially the crows that appear and make noise for being afk, will start to spawn on players who stay in one area too long.
---
Now, I understand you will be fucked but don't use anything if you learn a killer with nothing then start using powerful perks you will just be that much better. Learn the killer for what it is then what it can be
---
Hahaha that’s the point! :P
---
I think you’re getting a bit too into your role-play there dude. 
---
I’ve noticed it. Especially today, though. I was trying to heal someone and missed two skill checks. Before I could finish, they ran off. Also have had an instance where I’m working on something and then I’m suddenly getting put onto a hook. 
---
Yeah probably auto correct on mobile
---
I know this is an unpopular opinion, do generators.
---
Lol. Bugs by Daylight for sure. I heard that wraith doesn't see the blood splatter that survivors do after they're fully healed, is it true?
---
am i not allowed to have fun and/or bitch? i mean camping/tunneling not fun for survivors but look at the amount of salt everywhere while these two are actual legit strategies.
---
you seem to never actually play killer on high ranks where you know better to not swing and listen where the cunt goes. it prolongs the chase to 2 seconds top but it's really, really unpleasant and annoying. and very unnecessary unless you want to get tunneled and camped. 
---
Awww I shoulda known, thanks
---
Doctor is hardly a problem once you learn how to deal with him. Most of the people who lose to him can't hit skillchecks, and don't understand that you simply have to not let 3 gens at the end get all bunched up.
---
“Nope, used Hex: Ruin.  That means it officially doesn’t count.  It’s the law.”- Megan ‘EZ or DC’ Thompson
---
How could they possibly rework Nurse without absolutely breaking her into trash? She's honestly one of two killers who can't be bullied, and completely ruin what the atmosphere is supposed to be in this game, once you master her.
---
I mean you’re allowed to complain and have fun, but I think you’re taking the complaining a bit too far. You said it yourself, pallet blinding doesn’t drastically change the dynamic of the chase and yet you’re losing your mind over such a mechanic. Just chill, it’s just a game. 
---
Your hit box is larger while self caring (useful as fuck when playing huntress) not sure about anything else
---
Yes, most people don't know how a developer studio works. 
---
Yeah to me the camping, tunneling, flashlight clicking and t bagging isn't what's wrong with this game. It' the toxic people in the chat who are.
---
Fuck I knew it was tydeturne. I've been saying that the entire time but I checked his YouTube out and I thought it said that, thought ive just been saying his name wrong the entire time lol
---
They'll never be happeh
---
It must be survivors side only, in which case again, i beg you to run a different perk until devs fix this issue (and i know a lot of wraith players use blood to track injured survivors so i know im asking a lot)
---
So my post gets removed but not the other ones that break the same rule? Awesome.
---
Wraith cannot see that mega blood splatter at all. Healed or not.
---
BHVR is not an indie studio. There are people in separate teams doing different things. Delaying a chapter will do nothing for the game's health, or the game overall besides delaying them more money to spend in the game - if they do that, then yes, for sure, the game will be unfixable.
---
A new way huh xD
---
it's your first time don't worry
---
(X) Doubt
---
I personally know 5 people who play and they will tell you we’ve gotten 3-4 games in a role where killers just camps. 
---
It won't do anything. Campers only care about the kill. Not rank, not points. All you're doing is making the hooked person wait even longer to get to the next game. Likely prompting a DC. Just do gens and move on.
---
That could make things more exciting and put more pressure on the end game.
---
Do you have same perks on console? Do you have same windows, pallets? Items? On console it's even harder for killer to win. Facecamp is even more justified there.
---

Would be better than it is now, and would give survivors more of a reason to go after dull totems. Could be a nice change.

I'll probably just not play for a while. They really messed things up in this update.
---
I feel like NOED is enough reason to for me to go after dull totems but that’s just me. 
---
I was in the woods, Trapper's map. A Huntress found me, chased me but then suddenly stopped and vanished. I was like Huh? Later on I saw this Huntress, she facecamped a team mate, til death. Her first catch. Then I started observing her. Then it became painfully clear what her intention was. She was keeping the three closest gens in check. And with that facecamp from earlier I just knew people will have to guarentee die to get one of those done.
---
My team mates didn't realize this and were happily fixing generatos on the other side of the map, not knowing what they had to face when there was only one more gen to do.
---
Long story short: We all died.
---
I always aim to be friendly in match. I try to win but I’m still nice about it. Then the survivors decide to bully poor little old me playing Freddy 
---
I agree, but not everyone does. If dull totems serves a purpose beyond noed, more people may feel like it's worth doing.
---
they really did...
---
Hell no. 
---
Maybe but there's honestly better film killers out there that are more popular and just seem better. Definitely one of the least favorite horror icons imo

Oh that's good. Still doesn't change the fact survivors get like 5fps though.
---
Demi rarely uploads on YouTube does he have twitch? I love his accent
---
I'm down GT: Adive_tricks

It happens when people alt-f4 during the loading screen.
---
I saw an interesting idea where all killers get a 5th slot for only hex perks. Totems would then become secondary objectives in every game and since they get destroyed so easily it wouldn’t leave killers playing with 3 perks. Of course some hex perks would be adjusted with this change as needed but I can see it working and slowing games down just a bit. 
---
losing my mind? by... pardon, by complaining on Reddit and asking people not to do it because it's annoying, ruins immersion and doesn't really help? 
---
he does. not sure if he streams much though. 
---
Hex: exterminate all weebs
---
Someone else said it may be a problem with that map specifically, I'm not sure though.
---
Okay I like the general idea but here's my take, I'll start with the perks fieldworker can't work as a perk as much as I'd looooove to see through that damn corn it would completely avoid the mechanic of those "corn" maps. Maybe make it an m2 power where he uses it to see better kind of like Myers stalking? The hex perk seems meh to me it feels like a cholrophobia mixed with thanotophobia that can be broken, would feel like a waste of a perk slot. Please elaborate more on the impatient flock perk, kind of seems like a lower end huntress lullaby. As for the power idk it seems like it can be pretty broken, maybe elaborate more on it? And what's the movement speed. Cool morning tho
---
How can they ruin the experience when they literally can’t fight back?

I still want Hannah Montana, I don't care what anyone says.

---
What offering did you use and what did they use
---
Wow, brutal strength, can you like not use ctutches all the time? Obviously you're gonna get a perfect game with the best killer, Freddy has no counterplay and is better than the nurse, she's to hard and too slow, plus her blinks don't do anything. Please, for the love of God, don't use crutches like Brutal Strength, Surveillance, Spies from the shadows, etc. 
---
Taking the OoO and just teabagging to annoy you.
---
Dashing through pallets and windows solely to create that noise, over and over.
---
Using every loop possible.
---
Using instablinds.
---
Using voice com to completely abuse the game mechanics.
---
Refusing to leave with gates open, teabagging instead, or running across the map.
---
Just a few examples. In this game, killers have hard time and survs are on vacation. They have much more tools than killers to abuse wvery mechanic in game.
---
Bloodhound helps if you mess up and lose the surv
---
That's fair tbh, explicitly being an ass is just... Idk why people do it, there's no real excuse for toxicity.
---
I would take QnQ and swap SC with Adre
---
Exactly. The best they can come up with for their own jackassery and stupidity is “oH jUsT dOnT gEt OfFeNdEd LoL” 
---
ya me to it sucks cause I love sloppy 
---
'beautiful salt' we are likeminded.
---
What I find funny about swf salt in particular is...They're friends. Ever watched starwars? Darth Maul killing Quigon and Obi-wan going " NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! ". We are that Maul. We killed that friend, and unlike the movies, us bad guys get away with it, "Sorry the movie's not getting the ending you hoped for..SMIRK". It cracks me up.
---
They're like extra pissed cause you killed their friend. Such movie cliche, so fun.
---
&gt;I'm pretty sure teabagging is directly insulting. 
---
LOL the survivor can literally only communicate to the killer ingame via tbagging or emoting. Meanwhile other games allow coms and chat ingame. How coddled do you have to be to be offended by tbagging as a form of communication?
---
I'd love to have Candyman in this game. He literally has a hook hand so he'd fit well in dbd. I imagine him having a bee swarm attack as someone else said, and perhaps a secondary ability to travel through mirrors.
---
But again, as others said, he isn't the most popular horror character, and we'd probably see others before him, such as ghostface, Jason, even pinhead for example. 
---
LOL the survivor can literally only communicate to the killer ingame via tbagging or emoting. Meanwhile other games allow coms and chat ingame. How coddled do you have to be to be offended by tbagging as a form of communication? Jesus
---
Ideally that is what they'll do yes, but this is ultimately a business and they need a profit margin. the best way to handle things if we want things fixed is to divert resources into gameplay changes and bug fixes. I don't know what you think but not all game studios are like Rockstar with hundreds of millions to develop games 
---
Yep
---
Are you saying bbq and chili doesn't show people hiding in lockers? 
---
Who thinks it does?
---
She had to have been so close to wiggling out.
---
I faced one once.  He has a freakishly small terror radius. 
---
I would DC 
---
Teabagging waste time when they should be running so that’s more of a favor, or if in the gate just them out.
---
 
---
The noise can be annoying but I’ve hardly experienced that. I like to say they can’t make noise if they’re dead :)
---
Loops are literally their only defense
---
Have you tried using a flashlight properly? Also, look up, it’s not even close to being op 
---
SWF is literally built into the game so “coordinated” survivors is a game mechanic  
---
Again, they taunt but killers get more points for the same match so just push them out. They aren’t so brave when you hit them. 
---
Killers and survivors both have strong perks, killers get add ons and survivors get items that bend the normal mechanics 
---
Hahah no I hate posts like these I don’t facecamp  I farm people who are toxic ie ds, flashlight constantly teabag at pallets fuck this post 
---
It's meant to be "HEY ASSHOLE CHASE ME"
---
Wait seriously??? I have mained killer since I first started playing the game, and have never considered anything in-game as toxic. Post game chat where people tell me to kill myself is toxic. Didn't realise someone could be that pathetic to get annoyed at looping
---
i think playing p3 Claudette is shitty though. especially on Yamaoka Estate. and not touching a gen when only two are alive, waiting for other one to die, is shitty. 
---
Not anymore after the legion update 
---
You're so delusional. I'll crush your bullshit later.
---
Yep. Lockers hide your aura as of the most recent patch.
---
It’s working with the killer and it’s unfair. Don’t do that shit 
---
is he compensating for something?
---
It does look a bit too close to the doctor, but hellraiser franchise has been out for a long, long time. I wouldn't be surprised if there are other face stretching horror doctor types out there
---
fuck yea baby, better than being toxic and raging in the post match chat xD
---
I didn’t know this, I am so sorry!!! I love sloppy butcher but I always wondered why survivors started acting choppy D:
---
Played against this fckin terrified :/
---
Yeah, but if the killer is camping don't just stay nearby. They might even have perks to tell them you're nearby which will just make them camp even more. Do a generator and go for the save once the killer leaves. If they're just camping in general do generators. Don't try to unhook if the killer is camping, do generators and escape to punish them for camping.
---
nah the killer just awkwardly walks in and excuses himself and quickly drops in the offering and leaves like the killer is walking to the table with the cool kids.
---
All I want is a casual mode so I don’t get punished for ranking up and playing with people who spend way more time on this game than me. I don’t care about getting better at the game or being competitive I just wanna dick around.
---
Yikes. Iridescent head is so annoying tbh. Huntress is pretty good if you're good with her hatchets, you don't even need that shit.
---
Idk why you got downvoted lol. That's cool though, pretty nice of her
---
THIS ID ACCURSTE AF DJDBJDND
---
I'd love to see a big fucking spider as a killer. He'd have to be some sort of bi-ped form/hitbox but that would be awesome. 
---
Yeah nice spot. It's a shadowplay I have from last year. Haven't posted it online before though.
---
Thats... Dont take this personally... 
---
Really stupid... Like. At least you can dodge iridescent heads. You cant dodge legion.
---
Also, they mentioned on livestream q&amp;a that a potential buff is to when you hit an injured survivor with deep wounds, it will count as a double hit.
---
And the other buff would be that you keep your remaining Power if you deactivate it early. 
---
Seriously... You telling me Freddy can do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4AhTjaaDJE#t=1m14s) but in DbD suddenly windows are just this impossible hurdle?
---
What is HASTE?
---
I wonder what you guys think is one of these good fan made ideas, curious to see
---
Behavior don't generate revenue by fixing their game. Adding more cosmetics to the store and pumping out new killers are the top priority. Gotta milk the cattle before they leave for greener pastures.
---
I'm a nice survivor main, I play clean and always say GG WP even if the killer did awful. It's just polite imo, sometimes the killer is salty and says "ugh maybe for you..." But that's fine. 
---
I don't play killer much but when I do I just do it for BP and don't actually kill anyone, nobody has insulted me for it so far but we shall see 🤔
---
I'm not saying you should do this, it's just what I do because I don't care about winning at all. I'm just here to have a fun game and make it as enjoyable for others as I can.
---
Wait, if you are never seeing the same survs it means theres way too many survs compared to killer.
---
It was an idea. Yeah it would be too much. Of course you also have Billy and his chainsaw. A noed spirit or nurse. And I've seen my fair share of legion dodging.
---
I certainly agree, but I'd rather see Combat Straps get nerfed and base crouch buffed a bit. The normal crouch speed is a bit too slow.
---
Also yeah seriously give Trapper an actual buff instead of more band aid addons.
---
Thank you! And I agree with you on that last part hahahaha 
---
They don't expect you to love their concept and give it popularity, they're just sharing it. They don't have to, they could do without people insulting their artwork and ideas. They also don't expect it to have a chance of being added to the game, that's not the point of it. It's about the concepting, it's fun to create original ideas.
---
Sorry if I sound salty or something like that, I'm not but I feel like the way I wrote sounds that way skskksk
---
I ham it up for the viewers and when I'm done, I like to sub so I could watch the match. But if I'm getting owned, then no...nah...I'll have to force myself to watch it for learning purposes but that's it. lol
---
Yeah but it will be kind of a guessing game cause you don't know on what map you are gonna play until you are in the game. 
---
What does that have to do with whether teabagging communicates disrespect or not? I know people on the internet will say you're "coddled" if you're offended by literally anything, but what I'm saying is that it seems like the *intent* is to offend. Do you disagree? Do you think teabagging is actually meant to convey respect?
---
its funny you think your post is gonna stop people from using it.
---
'worthless' is just rude. How dare they use poor little dipper for their shitty meme
---
Very few killer's give a shit about your fun. If it makes it easier "to win" then they will do it.
---
The boat has 2 vaults.  One from the middleish of the boat, and one from one side with the stairs.  Both of these can set up into a safe loop around to escape or stall.  2 Pallets create a safe enough chance to stall out the killer, and several lockers set up good potential to hide from BBQ and to lose the killer, especially after a vault.  Bonus points to Lithe users here, as not only are you going to cut Line of Sight from the killer, you also will have no scratch marks for 3 seconds with several possible ways to run.
---
You really want to knock out the boat gen first if you can, get one guy to distract the killer while 3 work on the boat gen and knock it out ASAP.  Once you knock out the gen, the boat turns into one of the best places to waste time for your team, and makes it much less obvious if a survivor is over there when they run from the killer.  Meanwhile, leaving the boat till late sets up your team to struggle if you haven't secured a big lead on the killer pressure wise, as it effectively gives the killer a free gen for the 3 gen strat, and can be quite hard to make progress on the gen when the killer can quickly chase you off of it.
---
A good trick to use is to get on/near the boat, and just hide for a while the killer inevitably comes to check after hearing the crows.  Killer will probably give up quick enough as they can't give up too much pressure to check if a survivor is still around or just ran near the boat and brushed the edge of the crow trigger, and not pay much attention to the fact the crows don't come back down, especially if he does end up finding someone somewhere else.
---
Brap brap. Pew pew.
---
I'm a killer main, but I hate when other killers say stuff like, "lol you have DS, that's why I face camped you"
---
*there was a murder!*
---
If you don't get downed they can't just pick you up. He earned the kill.
---
Billy can still be looped and NOED can be cleansed
---
jokes on you
---
here comes the trapperrrrrr 🎤
---
I just make them when I am bored. So... yeah, a lot of truth in that.
---
"op party starters" ok, satan. Wraith add-on made me laugh though, literally was using it with coxcombed clapper to get gen grabs yesterday.
---
Get that fetus, kill that fetus!
---
His new add-ons were the buff. They're awesome and give him way more pressure with his traps.
---
Sometimes I watch their VODs after the game, and if they weren't hostile with their comments, I follow them.
---
What offering is it??
---
This is hilarious.
---
Gimme dem JUICY chests. 
---
I always try to make my creations balanced in some way. My first throw into the ring managed to be so perfectly balanced it had 50% upvotes.
---
Really though, people don't like being told that their ideas are bad or need tweaking in my experience, and I'm guilty of that myself. I've seen some good ideas and then I've seen some bad ideas. How the cookie crumbles.
---
Or the skillcheck is fucking near impossible to hit and not everyone is perfect and just misses it a lot. Or will you keep using your personal experiences as if they have relevance to mine? 
---
Yea, I prefer the bone Clapper because you can fake coming out to lull them into false security (assuming you saw someone else) but it's (the ghost) my favorite add-on. Goes great with nurses if you can pop outside of LoS and lunge around a corner.
---
BT is bugged. Iron will is actually busted at red ranks. Good verse spirits. Obviously adrenaline is an S tier perk, but everyone plays differently. 
---
I try to balance my ideas at least. People tend to dislike being told their idea is bad or that it needs changes. I'm guilty of that, myself. Ah well, these things happen.
---
I feel like a lot of people will just run it more if they find out...
---
It is not the best art I ever made, but I thought that someone will maybe like it. And as a person tryharding to make art for a living, I am not hiding behind my imaginary sister. After all she is really shy, leave her alone!
---
The beta version of the Doctor's map also had Chinese all over the place basically. Eventually they traded it out though, probably to avoid getting into trouble.
---
its called the "sand bag" i think because its literally a sandbag with a gas mask attached iirc. cant remember if its free
---
Watch PsychoScorpionz on Twitch. Extremely good Pig main, plays without Ruin and NOED. 
---
I'll take Gru over Legion. Shit, give me Freddy Fazbear. Something well designed, at the very least.
---
The face camping bubba gets the song that never ends. (Until you die)
---
Thank you
---
Real talk Kira would be a 10/10 Killer concept.
---
Yeah... Your wording at the end "I crawled across the map you couldn't just let me have it"
---
That's entitlement. You don't get a free escape because you crawled towards the gate.
---
If you escaping (winning) is fun, but them getting to you, picking you up and then hooking you (also "winning" in a way) isn't. That's very biased and selfish. If you say everything is "for the memes", then you're going to get into a mindset where you're gonna start expecting free escapes because of a set of rules that everyone apparently has to follow, or they're "ruining the fun of the game".
---
Now where have I heard that before?
---
Why is this a picture? Where did this specific image come from? 
---
I doubt that will ever happen as much as I would love that, (nurse main btw) I dont see it happening that would leave the killers with one maybe 2 "strong killers". While I agree nurse and legion need some kind of re work they take basic mechanisms of the game and flat out ignore them, which obviously isn't fun for either side in the long run. 
---
Sweaty Nurse Main with all the crutches. Kinda overkill
---
&gt;What does that have to do with whether teabagging communicates disrespect or not? I know people on the internet will say you're "coddled" if you're offended by literally anything, but what I'm saying is that it seems like the *intent* is to offend. Do you disagree? Do you think teabagging is actually meant to convey respect?
---
It's meant to convey whatever the survivor wants to because it's the only thing they can do to communicate to a killer. Just because you jump to the conclusion that it's meant to offend, is on you and your interpretation only.
---
New killer is the Entity itself. Whenever it manages to look at a survivor for 3 seconds uninterrupted, the survivor explodes into fireworks... Meaty fireworks.
---
"nothing personnel, kid"
---
I feel like people HEAVILY underestimate how much new Killers and Survivors help the game stay fresh and keep the pull for new players. Variety, replayability and a sense of progression skyrocket exponentially with every new release, this does not even factor in whether the new perks, maps and characters are balanced or not.
---
What he said 
---
I do that shit on purpose to see if he has iron maiden rofl
---
That's only if they have the legion perk, right? 
---
If you read my comment again you'll see that I only run that build when I'm having a bad night, ex lots of really good swfs, or maybe I'm just playing like crap at that moment and I need a boost to get out of the slump! I know how cancer the build is trust me it's a last resort!
---
To disrespect my brother in the right position you can see the other person tea bagging normally ends with me being moried right after 
---
Banned!? Lol. 
---
Nah. The first meme was Lemon.
---
Then sprintbursts away... happend allot on my adepthunt..
---
Yup, I believe we have enough killers/survivors/perks in the game for now. They should really focus on fixing bugs at the moment.  
---
I also wouldn't be against them just releasing more maps instead of a killer/surv.
---
Yes, I saw that that's not your main build. Doesn't make it any less OP.
---
If I'm having hard times even on Nurse, I just close DbD, it's definitely not my day.
---
Well, that would be normal if you were 5 years old.
---
But here me out I think Freddy Fasbear should be in the game...
---
BT has been bugged for a short amount of time and will 99% be patched next update, so you don't really have a point with that. And you wrote "verse" instead of "versus" so I'm just going to assume you don't know what you're talking about for Iron Will. 
---
^ How to play endgame. ^
---
The amount of time you’re wasting trying to get a 4K, you could just get 5x the BP lost by starting/finishing the next game. 
---
Agreed: JoJo x Dead by Daylight fans unite
---
Doesn't matter, Jake is injured anyway. Go do gens. Either the killer will follow you and down you, or he is afk and you'll get to leave through the gates. If he downs you, too bad, just move on to the next match. Does getting a few thousand bp really matter that much to you so you have to just stand there afk? You'd get more bp by just moving onto the next matcj, instead of just standing there, waiting for him to give you the hatch.
---
Rank 3, got called a facecamper because all claudettes kept rushint to the hook after i hooked someone.
---
As soon as i turn around, boom, i snatched a claudette trying to rescue the guy i hooked.
---
Remove noed
---
Rancor and bitter murmur
---
Why?
---
Ad hominem aside (pretty sure that was a jab at me). Putting hours into something only for it to get shutdown is pretty frustrating. I should have specified however, what I mean by that is when people just say it needs changes or that it's bad without giving any feedback on why. That's what upsets me at the least.
---
TheEntityLeftHand is that you?
---
I need a flashlight your little cunt &gt;:(
---
Do you know that rancor shows the aruas for all survivors for 3 seconds forvevery gen done my child?
---
Run both. Embrace the powers of being a mute.
---
Not really, probably just one of the few killers on r1 who doesnt need nurse or camping to get kills. 
---
It's BHVR.
---
No, lockers just hide auras now
---
Agreed.
---
The other is just a nurse that blinks.
---
Run borrowed times and go for suicide rescues
---
That's kind of the issue with Nurse, and Legion, but I'm not getting into them. The ability to teleport through things in general makes her completely unable to be balanced to a generally agreed upon middle zone. She will either be completely broken levels of OP or completely broken levels of UP.
---
The middle ground doesn't exist for her, and the most counterplay you can give survivors is some LOS breakers in the map and praying to god your mindgames work.
---
I felt like Discordance and Distortion were oddly similar to me and then I remembered my concept from a while back.
---
Enduring, not only does it do a good job of countering ds but also pallet stuns. But I also agree something should be done about ds/noed
---
If you dont like pallets you can go Enduring + spirits fury and respect no pallets. You will get stunned, but they wont last long and you wont get looped forever, and eventually there will be no pallets to stop you. 
---
Don’t have the spirit yet. I’m not spending money on the game again until
---
BHVR fix some of the issues.
---
...I don't see any logic behind how it's good against Legion. If they're frenzying, unless it is literally the ass end of their frenzy duration, dead hard just makes them whiff and them immediately swing at you again. If they're not in frenzy, then I guess it gives you a dodge if they decide to chase you normally when you're injured?
---
Mmmmmmk
---
Mmmmmmk dad
---
I felt like you in the beginning but I played at a time where playing killer was much harder to play than now. Now I've gotten less mediocre I find killer really easy until rank 5 or so. Even then if you're not against 4 man swf you'll often get 3-4k.
---
Hag and Pig are fucking spot on. 
---
&gt; Combat Straps get nerfed and base crouch buffed a bit.
---
This is happening.
---
I struggle to make myself play a game every so often and I have every trophy for the game (except legion dlc ones) I just can’t be bothered with the stability and optimisation issues. I have recently just stopped playing on release of legion and it makes me sad cause it honestly is one of my favourite multiplayer games me and friends had so many good times but we all can’t stand it anymore. 
---
Angrypug has earned himself a permanent spot on my mori list. Second time I used it he just insta dced, felt so good.

That is completely understandable and something I really wish wasn't a thing. If you're gonna take the time to create your own killer, survivor, or entire chapter, you should be ready to listen to feedback for how to balance.
---
I truly appreciate people like you.
---
ok
---
Only one legitimate playstyle and you know it. Equip Insidious, Iron Grasp and Agitation, and get the first lucky survivor you find into your basement
---
I'll believe it when I see it.
---
I really hope you’re joking 
---
Which is the correct thing to do. Just though I'd give you the heads-up :)
---
Everytime I see "Desert Rock Billy" and hear QOTSA's "Millionaire", I'm a happy man.
---
I used to run Knockout or rarely Third Seal and slug DS but nowdays i run Enduring, makes DS a complete non-issue since i can short blink them down again. 
---
I don't need any other perk so why not ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ (my full build currently: BBQ, Nurse's, Enduring, Agitation).
---
Another person unironically using Bubba! Biggest advice I can give for old Bubba is hammer time, 90% of the time hitting them with the hammer is your best bet. For builds, just your standard meta perk build/fuck your loop build. Does well for him, I like to run enduring, spirits fury, ruin and BBQ.
---
For more scummy games that demand Bubba's justice I've had great luck with slug builds. A fun one for me is monitor and abuse, nurses calling, knock out, and either deer stalker (if you keep losing your slugs) or BBQ and Chili to find the slugs one by one once you've hooked the last one you knocked down. Monitor and abuse + nurses is great for catching altruistic survivors trying to get their friends up, knock out makes it difficult to find them in the first place. But this build while doesn't require ruin will bring nothing but salty rage your way.
---
It should, it definitely improved mine (yet the game doesn't reach 144 stables).
---
It depends also of your CPU, your GPU and your monitor. It's like a balance thing.
---
I would reach more FPS if I had a better CPU or if I cap the FPS, or maybe I'm using an IPS with great colours but shitty response, etc
---
Build: Insidious, Agitation, Iron Grasp, Mad Grit
---
Idea: down one survivor and take them to the basement, hook them, then sit in the corner with insidious and when a survivor comes down to rescue. If all survivors come down for a rescue, gg, if none come to save and the guy dies, rinse and repeat until all 4 are dead or one got the hatch. 
---
Or just ignore them, wastes time for less pay off than chasing another survivor. 
---
I have 2 monitors,1 1440p and 1 1080p thats why my frames are lower. (I have a gtx1060)
---
Probably so they can gen rush
---
You can learn from him, I’ve gotten much better at survivor just by watching him
---
Gen rushing is done separetely.Who dies it together?
---
gen rush 
---
Yeah I agree, I mean we had a dc about a minute into the game as soon as he got downed he left. The LF had hooks throughout the game too, we got all five gens with three of us and me and the other one get dc’d on for no reason, that was like the third time he chased me the whole game, I wasn’t a dick or anything, didn’t tbag or nothing like that. 
---
Yeah, probably it's the 1440p squeezing the 1060, But the game is still poorly optimized, tho.
---
HAVE SOME GODDAMN FAITH ARTHUR.
---
Until I see actual changes, I doubt it. If they can fix up their game, grand.
---
Memes
---
i do it if i have a coop action ritual 
---
nice
---
1. Rank doesn't matter and you will realize this once you get your rank 1. Asking for help instead of trying out things on your own is in my opinion/experience a bad way of learning. When it comes to Sloppy or Franklin's I would use Sloppy, Items are annoying but so is longer heal times.
---
2. Leatherface is the most basic killer in the game. You chase, you get close and you chainsaw unless you need to melee them which you need to be the judge of.
---
3. Monto's builds are purely for fun they are not good builds as they serve one purpose. The basement build is fun I guess but not so viable.
---
very nice
---
I HOPE AND PRAY THAT MY SURVIVOR HAS A SOUL SO IT WILL FEEL PAIN WHEN I MORI IT FROM MY HOLE!
---
Pretty good but i would change noed to devour hope because it can be much more rewarding and noed is a perk for noobs
---
There are plenty of reasons to use it, especially in swf 
---
If you click on the double arrows next to the chat box(it looks like &gt;&gt;), it closes the chat and makes it possible to avoid all of this bullshit. 
---
It sounds like she unfairly put you in an impossible game.
---
The cooldown is long as shit considering it takes 4 stabs to down a survivor once. Which is insanely long if the survivor has enough of a brain to camp a pallet ASAP as Legion approaches. Let them get the first stab, then drop the pallet and Legion has to refill the meter 3 more times for a single down. And because of that nature Legion usually uses Frenzy as soon as it is enough to get another stab. That way you waste their stab and they are stunned and need to wait for another charge up. So if the Legion isn't letting you bleed out you can force them to come and hit you 5 singular times to get a single down.  
---
Yes, once they know you have Dead Hard they will keep some extra charge, but even that is good value. Because now Legion has to charge their power a few more sec for every single attack on you unless you already used the skill.  
---
This all only works if the Legion isn't moonwalking or breaking LOS on purpose. Yet it is actually smarter on Legion to hard chase since they pip like stupid from doing that whilst just moonwalking won't reward as much points in the chaser category. (They can do a bit of both though so they can down faster and max out the emblem)
---
thats why he mentioned it comboes really well with either of the clapper addons (one of which removes bell sound while the other one makes bell sound global so you can't tell if he's next to you or in a faraway galaxy)
---
A good way to win every time is play as a survivor who has a good stealth skin and then just fix 2 gens as fast as possible by yourself so you can get the hatch.
---
Heck I have so far gotten 316hrs and that amount is only gonna continue rising. The game offers so much value for the money you pay, it's pretty silly to think it needs constant updates in its current state.
---
320 shards to unlock pallet
---
A trap was on her head and it killed her
---
DBD really needs its own version of "Operation Health" from R6 - a whole update devoted to making quality-of-life updates and fixing bugs. 
---
I agree with tou completely, this NEEDS to happen.
---
Yeah, and the worst part is that they do it right in front of you and then say that your a tunneler because they can’t think for 5 seconds
---
Thanks, now i can finally live my dreams
---
White Ward is useless imo. Good items you would wish to protect would often result in getting a lot of bloodpoints so you want a escape cake instead Furthermore, it's more likely you'll survive because of the good item thus making it a dead offering. 
---
Especially when they all wear the black pants and shirt and you can’t see them.
---
Yeah Candyman is getting a new movie directed by Jordan peele (The director of get out)
---
Also I'm curious as to what some better horror movie characters would be fitted to the roll. I love horror movies and can't think of anything. Maybe It, or Ghostface. But not much comes to mind.
---
Yes, but then the addon isn't good by itself. Unlike combat straps it requires the synergy of something else to be good.
---
What region?
---
I don't know how you play but it seems like you're pretty efficient + good at chases since you're able to consistently 4k with a killer that is looped easily and has low map pressure.
---
Even though there's the whole "rank doesn't matter" thing, in my opinion purple/red rank survivors are much more efficient than rank 15s, and since you're rank 10 you'll find yourself getting genrushed to shit as you go higher, survivors working through your ruin etc. Survivors will also (mostly) be better at looping and leatherface doesn't exactly have tools to prevent this so expect some pretty tough games. You said that you didn't need noed in your games, presumably since they rarely powered the exit gates but this will probably change as you get to purple/red ranks and if you find that happening often don't be afraid to switch out franklins for noed.
---
Other perks to consider are enduring/spirit fury since you do eat alot of pallets, whispers if you need tracking I personally prefer whispers over nurses. 
---
As far as playing leatherface, you probably already have the basics down since you can consistently 4k but the biggest thing is probably knowing when to chainsaw/m1, better survivors will almost always punish greedy chainsaws to get an additional loop at pallets, most of the time it's better to get the m1 unless they're in the open and you can reliably get the instadown. 
---
They did say that the next Killer will be someone from before World War 2. One of the Devs leaked this information during a Dev Stream, I'm assuming a Plague Doctor or maybe some sort of Knight maybe. They weren't specific as to when in time before WW2
---
And then he disappeared into the skies, literally
---
Okay but that second Claudette scared the hell out of me. 
---
Thank you for a post that is actually useful
---
lol welcome to club sally
---
*Cries in Dwight ;-;
---
Your opinion is that must is rank A. According with his chase power and map pressure, it is only a B.
---
 I wish I understood 
---
"gO Do A GeNeRaToR"
---
I would but so many baby killers need to run noed nowadays.
---
Also, if you're in a hatch stand off you've already 3kd, if you're willing to stand around hoping for that 4k you're sweatier than the survivor waiting. 
---
Mafia Capo 🅱ol🅱o
---
Because standing there resolves absolutely nothing. Yes, if he leaves, it's a loss. Too bad, you'll still get more bp by going to different matches instead of being afk for 30 minutes. Which option sounds better to you? Sitting still for an hour, waiting for the possibility of the killer giving you the hatch, so you can get 5k bp, or just leaving and losing, but being able to go to diffrenet matches and getting way more bp? Is escaping one time really that fucking important to you? Op is as much of a loser as the killer
---
Smh my head, ppl really do be toxic these days. Imo, they should buff noed and DS, those perks aren't really strong unlike 
---
Good job, rank 1 means more than most people understand 
---
Maybe I should translate other maps such as Autohaven Wreckers and Coldwind Farm...
---
It seriously doesn't break the game. It just makes it easier. A decent swf can still can fucked by a good killer. It is when the swf with toxic perks is really good with flashlight saves and looping that the killer gets fucked bad. 
---
&gt;So why on purple reagent is wroten '' stacks''? 
---
Unless you're being sarcastic, there is a reason: Even though adding another 75% purple fog perk will exceed the arbitrary limit if 100%, the remaining 25% will still stack with new 75% being added to the mixture. Obviously brown and green fog perks also add up, so they all "stack". It doesn't change the 100% limit however.
---
I find that horn so satisfying, you could say it makes me horny.
---
Awful puns aside I really do like the sound, best sound in the game

That would be greatly appreciated

---
A minute of silence for our fallen brother. They got to the hell that is Rank1, you will be missed
---
Usually I roll a spliff and open up twitch -  That's how I settle hatch stand offs. They don't happen often enough to bug me, but if it comes down to it and the killer has already 3kd or someone has dcd and I'm in a hatch standoff ill stand there and wait. Like I said before, all the killer has to do is hit me and we move onto the next game, they get their 3k, i get my escape. - everyone's happy. Your solution is to give the killer the 4k and move on. No thanks, that's not how I play. 
---
You can try wraith with shadow dance White + blood and brutal strength. You bait the uncloak when survivors wait at pallets and then you cancel and break the pallet in half a second. 
---
Either you misspelled "Doctor" or you misspelled "lerry's"
---
&gt;Same and I pissed myself to top it off*
---
Don’t try to hide that edit /s
---
you get more points for doing gens with other people. besides, it's a bit safer. killer can't chase two people. 
---
I mori spammed someone as huntress because they kept tbagging the game before. They got mad and added me on steam to yell at me.
---
we all, killer mains, sometimes need to play survivor instead of using bad perk D:
---
Ass Viscunti 
---
If they remove DS NOED would be IRRELEVANT.
---
The stun on ds is enough for any good survivor to absolutely YEET OUT combine that with a good long chase played well by the survivor you end up getting punished for winning the chase, it auto turns into a failed chased. 
---
1 decent chase is already 1-2 gens depending on spawns, swf running ds? 9/10 you can guarantee a 4 survival.
---
I know this well because I do it with my swf
---
As for ranks 
---
Rank 1 killer and rank 4 survivor 
---
I feel like it would already be slightly more fair if it counts as 1 generator completed, this way, if you were with only 2 people left, at least you'd be guarenteed that there is a hatch, same if you are unfortunate enough to spawn alone. This will however not fix the mayor issue
---
t This is exactly it. Today I was playing survivor and there where two players who were doing exactly that. They even had both of the gates open and decided to wait just to teabag, I found the hatch and waited until they left. Well one of them was knocked into dying state and put on the hook. I didn't save them even though I could have because why should I risk myself for someone who ruins the game for everyone else. Fuck toxic survivors, they ruin the game for everyone, get them in a survive with friends group and it's over with. I still believe a toxic killer is never as bad as a toxic survivor. I wouldn't be suprised if half the toxic killers where the way they were for the reasons you described above. If anyone wants to complain about it is it four killers against one survivor or the other way around?
---
I hope you enjoy your week off :)
---
I’m at the point where I’d rather just die and move on than play against legion. They’re either bad and a mindless win or know how to game the ability and a killer than downs in 20s with zero counterplay.
---
Spirit isn’t even much better. Interactions against her can be summed up with essentially coin flips.
---
I’d rather play against only nurse for eternity than have to play against either of those killers.
---
They also get mad if you chase around the same survivor to long to try and hit them or if you try and make sure the person you hooked is going to stay on the hook as long as possible. 
---
None
---
Took me a bit to get that.
---
*DC Noises*
---
You imply that looping requires skill?
---
Hangman's trick and surveillance were made to counteract ok older dbd features but are now pretty much useless.
---
The only one I'd recomend is Monto to be honest
---
Well....I am Korean and English is my second language....Anyway I will correct it. Thanks.
---
If I get face camped it sucks but I'm sure it's because that's how they learned how to play the game due to how shitty the other survivors play the game.
---
Yeah,thinking back on it it does seem kinda unfun looking back,thanks for letting me know,I might be revising it later on seeing I typed this 12 at night and I was incredibly tired. What would your opinion on the perks be?
---
It's pretty bad. It's a shame because the idea behind the perk would be excellent. It doesn't last long enough though. Overcharge is pretty good and accomplishes almost the same, especially if you use unnerving presence to make the skill check extremely hard to hit. Discordance is also pretty good for people working on gens. 
---
Killer disconnects are just broken I swear. Sometimes I've depipped, sometimes it's left it as is, sometimes I've double pipped when I would have only single pipped in a game. I just stop questioning it and look more forward to dedicated servers when they (hopefully) fix it
---
Legion is an auto down in aprox 20 seconds, nurse can be gamed and stalled for a long time around corners.
---
I was thinking maybe make self care base kit, but I like your idea better.
---
Same
---
Welp, thats the meme format I found.
---
Thanks for this! I’m gonna have to remember to test this out next time I get ruin on one of these maps.
---
I only started watching streams because of this guys, I cant understand what you are trying to say here
---
The fact that you can turn around and continue the chase in less than 1 second instead of waiting 3.5 seconds? How the fuck is that not an indirect counter? I run enduring in all my killer builds now.
---
the face camping and toxicness of this community 
---
313 hours of Dead by Daylight on Steam, have never once been moried. When I see them in my games they're usually green, and it's someone else getting moried.
---
just a joke
---
Alright but really though
---
Unnerving presence doesnt really chance that much
---
That, in fact, was the funniest thing you could have said and I love this comment now
---
By the way I actually bought this game back in September (2018) and I got rank 1 killer twice. Once by playing Wraith only (after his buff), and once by playing Hag. So yeah, I know what survivors are like in rank 1. And yes I did run NOED on both my killers after reaching rank 5. But I don't think its necessary in my current rank, like you said.
---
Also I'd love to get Spirit Fury 3 on Leatherface but I also just bought the Spirit DLC at the same time as Leatherface (2 days ago) so I still don't have her teachables unlocked. But I do have Bamboozle. Do you recommend I use Bamboozle and take off Franklin's/Sloppy, or nah?
---

Given the quality of what Bethesda has been developing themselves lately (especially Fallout 76), I don't think they should ever be lauded as a big company producing quality content anymore. They're fine at publishing, but their own developed releases have been consistently terrible for years. The skyrim remaster made no attempt to fix any of the outstanding number of bugs, glitches and crashes. Fallout 4 was hollow and devoid of anything meaningful. Yes, BHVR might need more staff, but a huge team doesn't remotely help Bethesda not just roll out releases that are worsening in quality. 
---
I main survivor and after games I’ve gotten death threats and all of those sorts of messages just for playing the game.
---
Pallet stun me? I’ll camp you and send hate. Loop me for more than a gen? I’ll camp and send hatemail. Dodge my abilities? I’ll camp and send hatemail.  
---
People seem to take this game really seriously. I’ve gotten hate mail and such from survivors when I play killer too so :/ can’t win sometimes. 
---
Its for Adept Pig, and meme builds.
---
3rd person camera on Nurse being tested
---
Bloodhound/Remember Me/BBQ or Discordance/Nurses is a pretty tidy build on him.
---
Everyone's already talked about bloodhound on him. RM is very easy to gain stacks if you're focusing on frenzy hits (use franks tape for even more effectiveness). Discordance is probably better at lower ranks where you're more likely to get people working on gens together but BBQ is probably better at higher. Nurses, while not working on mend, people tend to heal straight after mending so that'll help you find them.
---
Other worthwhile perks are Ruin obviously, Mad Grit if you think you're going to be against a particularly altruistic team (insert 4 man swf joining lobby at the same time). Thana can also have applications on the same kind of team. 
---
One time, a wraith was standing on the hatch and not letting me in. So I went to do the last gen. Then my friend told me he had NOED. So I destroyed all the totems and did the last gen. He tried to kill me and got so pissed when I escaped. It was worth it. 
---
Baby killer
---
Its when you get hit and stun the killer with the pallet. Like game, just pick *one* thing to happen. Even I got the stun, or I got hit.
---
Tbh I'd be pretty mad if I used an offering for somewhere like Autohaven and it got overridden by Lerys
---
There is only one correct answer: **Yakety Sax**
---
**Bwong**
---
I find him fun to play and like the concept.
---
I think this concept is actually pretty cool! Also, this image of Dipper is hilarious!
---
Also didn’t get any points cos killer from that match dc’d.
---
Mostly new survivors lol we need more female survivors too many male survivors I’m not judging either lol
---
It’s for if you want to waste a perk slot by using a perk to do so. You could probably get more use out of WGLF in KYF than you would surveillance in a normal match.
---
But that doesn't get them money
---
It honestly depends on what kind of film you're making. Is it more of an rp'ing kind of thing, or more of a documentary or a mocumentary? I think my answer would change dynamically depending on what kind of film you're creating.
---
I know right? I never thought I'd see gravity falls become a meme before this format started
---
Lol yeah. I'm actually watching Gravity Falls for the first time. The end was spoiled for me, as I've seen it before, but I like seeing the build-up to Weirdaggedon.
---
Keep in mind that all killers can hit survivors over the fences :)
---
Same here, you’d need a lot of opinions on what people would want to see.
---
i watched his videos till face reveal for months. kinda liked them but quite frankly i also watched OchiDo before i figured this is toxicity(as in i literally didn't know cause i only joined the game back in the days).
---
same with tru3ta1ent. watching him more than occasional couple videos made me realize he's a one trick pony with a massive ego.
---
&gt;Visualizing it by map like this will probably help devs realize the problem faster and do something about it.
---
Lol.
---
&gt; Berus Toxin - Causes Exhaustion for 30 seconds. Ever since the Exhaustion nerf this addon has become a 3000 Bloodpoint "delete any Exhaustion perk that isn't Sprint Burst from the game" addon for Huntress.
---
Which is exactly why Huntresses and Clown's Exhaustion-causing add-ons should be reworked to be on a flat timer, rather than tied to regular Exhaustion mechanics. They are remnants from a time when Exhaustion still recovered while sprinting.
---
Something of note people may not know about the Winter Party Starter's utility: it also causes "burn" events, that is, it can be used to destroy Hag traps (all of them within its vicinity), burn Wraith out of cloak, and Nurse as well as Billy out of their ability charge. I'm pretty sure they stopped implementing burn mechanics for killer abilities after Nurse, for some reason. Not that they are very integral elements of regular gameplay (not by any stretch - people hardly utilize them, even if they do know about them), but I've always liked the flashlight as the only item - and one of the few survivor mechanics in general - that creates actual interaction with the killer. The flashlight has lost a fair bit of its utility with various nerfs over the past year, so the discontinuation of the burn mechanic with new killer abilities is disappointing in that same vein, of removing interactive gameplay elements. I appreciate the firecrackers for that very reason; namely that they create some new "exciting" interactions, such as using them mid-chase - something that had more or less died with the removal of insta-blind flashlights.
---
*Western standoff music plays
---
The feeling at the end when your relieved to survive after an intense game, but I never really get that feeling anymore...
---
Just get facecamped and tunnels off the hook... boring 
---
Thx m8!
---
Here’s my original scarecrow idea...
---
Yes, okay, Legion does have a few bugs. What I meant is that the concept of the legion is good, I do see where they wanna go. Can't just let bugs blind me and instantly don't see any potential smh
---
If anyone bothered watching the DBD devs stream they clearly said there's no longer gonna be one big optimization update but instead it's just gonna be here and there updates and they change some stuff wth Freddy like how it looks in the dream world but other than that nothing big has changed for Freddy or the optimization but I will say it definitely has gotten better since the beginning of December 
---
Latency would likely be evenly spread based on the server's connection, as opposed to connecting to someone who is on a 56k dialup and should be banned from multiplayer games.
---
I'd probably stay away from licensed characters like Laurie, and Michael, and Quentin, and Freddy just because their stories have already been told in other media. If I were you I'd take a look into the lore of each character on either the wiki or through lore videos on Youtube so that you can pick characters (in an rp sense) that are interesting. For example, Feng Min is a pretty independent, cocky, and solitary character in her lore so maybe making her own hubris her down-bringing or avoiding pairing her with another survivor in your rp would be a good idea. You may want to consider equipping your characters with toolboxes since that'd fit the whole idea of "fixing" and "tool boxes" together. Honestly as far as killers go, I think your best bet would be to either use the huntress, the hillbilly, or the doc in their own maps just because they have an enormous fear factor, and unique moris when they kill survivors. If you're looking for more blood run sloppy butcher. 
---
Yeah... that's always annoying.
---
Maybe it implies the heartbeat getting closer, or the killer getting into a chase with monitor and abuse, or a legion using the iridescent button. Who knows.
---
Thought prayer beads muted her power completely. Guess I was wrong.
---
No you're right but still the PASSIVE phasing never had a sound.
---
Tbf what would a window do irl to stop someone stabbing you
---
Out of those, I only know Queen, Beatles, and David Bowie. Isn't Black Sabbath Ozzie's band?
---
Nah, ill wait. 
---
the same thing happend to me once. except I was the second person to be killed. so I don't know what happend at the end of the game. 
---
A killer with noed told me that looping and HEALING AT A PALLET is toxic. Like... If you don't like my game mechanic: 1. Get a few more brain cells   2. Don't use your very annoying game mechanic
---
That's the same as saying you escape every game without getting downed. I doubt you've never gone against a killer who managed to slug your whole team and haven't found Unbreakable useful there or when the exit gates are open and DS lets you escape, that's where the perks shine. DS and Deliverance almost always waste a ton of a killer's time and completely remove their pressure which makes the perks extremely useful at times.
---
Spicy dude
---
i honestly prefer the way the game is now, as you can just use MLGA and just compensate for when you need to throw pallets and vault windows early by checking the ping every so often. and honestly, i just dodge games with killers who have horrible ping and alt-f4 in the loading screen if their ping jumps from 80 to 400 when the game actually starts 
---
I didn't mean passive phasing, I meant her power "Yamaoka's Haunting"
---
I would playing as him or against him.
---
The trapper makes his own songs.
---
“Here come the trapper, you better watch out for his traps. Here comes the trapper, you better eat some ginger snaps! Trapppperrrrrrrr!”
---
Hopefully someone knows what I’m singing lmao 
---
Just wondering why the devs would do that, like it's just to troll survivor mains
---
Ok
---
well you still wrote it down
---
Why the hell do people keep making Anti Killer and Anti survivor things? It doesn't promote anything good even if it's a joke. 
---
OP also didn't look around before picking up the survivor, bad play on their part
---
basically
---
lmao
---
No.  
---
That would be a complete waste of time. You don't play the game to pip, you play it to have fun. Maybe try an offline game at this point.
---
They have counters, and are at least fun to play. They just need to tone down some of the add ons.
---
*the laws of physics cannot hold me*
---
Thank you &lt;3 I didn't want it to sound harsh. As I read my response, it sounds kinda douche from me, but it is not! Does it make sense? I hope so. Have a wonderful day, sir! &lt;- Not sarcastic. 100 % kind and optimistic. 
---
I'm in the red ranks. 
---
I switch lobbies as well. If the ping remains yellow for more than 30 seconds, I'll leave and requeue. It's ether bad matchmaking, which I get a lot of when I'm up late or up early as I assume it matches me with people far away, or there is a high percentage of people out there who pay five bucks a month for Internet and it clearly shows.
---
Also, how do you determine ping in the loading screen? Or do you base it on how long it takes for the bar to start filling in?
---
Good choice? Sure. And NOED + Ruin is even better choice. Doesn't make you better Nurse player, though.
---
BigWilly_17
---
To be frank, I expect myself to get 4 kills almost every game when I play as one of the killers I'm good at.  
---
Against a full on tryhard SWF, I expect myself to barely get any kills. But I might've gone against *one* in around 1500 hours, so that doesn't worry me.  
---
Just a little note: Rank in this games means pretty much nothing. With how much people derank, ranks 12-1 are full of really good and bad players.
---
Still so silly lol
---
Oh hellll no
---
&gt;totems were supposed to spawn randomly over the map
---
**Totems aren't intended to spawn completely randomly** , their place however is randomly chosen between various possible hiding spots.
---
Even if you know where they can spawn you still have to check up close almost every point as they are rarely visible from afar.
---
If their spawn were truly random it would be detrimental as most of the map doesn't provide any cover and they would be seen right away.
---
Also in this scenario they could spawn in certain areas blocking doors or corridors.
---
In my opinion, Pop Goes the Weasel needs a buff. Not too big a buff, something like making it work on a token-based system and not on a timer.
---
My killer bias is affecting my ability to have a reasonable conversation when you're willing to go afk for 30 minutes just to get one escape. Ok dude, whatever you say.
---
I met some guys playing DbD and they added me as a friend because they figured out we're from the same country by my name. They teabaged a killer even if he was really nice and fun to play with. At the end they kept swearing in our language but the killer didn't understand so I told him that they agreed they were assholes and deserved being tunneled and camped. Never played with them again.
---
The thing is that as a survivor I can go afk and just wait for a hit. The killer on the other hand has to stand there with a trigger finger ready to catch them if they attempt a jump. You know you're a sweaty killer if you're willing to wait through a standoff hoping for that 4k.
---
Also doing the last gen is stupid nowadays considering the amount of killers running NOED. 
---
Baby killers will downvote but thats the truth. 
---
Insidious does not affect Freddy's lullaby
---
Aye my teacher said to stick with the original killers just in case of legal stuff but thank you for your suggestion about showing the personalities in the characters its a good idea that actually does help me out a lot. Toolbox as well. As for map I'm gonna use a run-down farm a family member owns so hillbilly could work well with it. I would so love to do huntress though cause her mori would look really cool on film. Anyway thanks for the feedback! it helps fill out my research papers.
---
Dying in dbd doesn't equal a loss. 
---
Would it be good in my case though?
---
The messages I get for Camping and Tunneling. Fucking love them.
---
&gt; if killer camp without reason (like "he looped me for 4 gens so i camp"), he need a punishment
---
yeah.. he is.. it';s called not getting BP and letting Survivors do gens freely to escape and losing the game. Why do you feel like you need to follow up and being a cunt afterwards? Might wanna do some self examination. 
---
OP plz explain 
---
There was supposed to be a ? And /s and the end of my last comment 
---
Not really. If I wasted the killer's time the entire game and he has to resort to Tier 3 Bloodlust with NOED and then proceeds to face camp me, I'm calling it a win no matter what. He had the chance to go after others but if he wants to chase the Legacy 3 who knows how to run him around, fine by me. I'll prove to them that they shouldn't tunnel.
---
Tell you what though, its funny when I get saved with Borrowed Time, and getting out with all 3 survivors having my back only for the killer to DC at the last second. Always makes me laugh out loud and really makes my day. 
---
There certainly are better perks but it can help stalling the game a bit. It's not too useful a perk in my opinion, something like ruin or sloppy butcher would be much better.
---
Preach. 
---
Only use one perk: insidious. Bring survivor to basement and then stand in a corner. Rev chainsaw when teammates come for save
---
I know the film your talking about "A nurse's calling." I've got good ideas from it as well its a good film. Don't expect too much though. They had a full camera crew and all the good tech and everything while I have the budget of a ham sandwich lol. Thanks for the response! 
---
Its fact though. How can you say "If you say so" when its true? I don't really get you to be honest.
---
Jake and Nea (my main survivors) narrowly escaping the doctor on crotus penn asylum complete with his iconic laugh by running through the exit gate leaving him enraged and trapped in his realm. After passing through the gate they enter a cornfield passing a hooked and decaying dwight(whats left of him) after passing him the familiar sound of Billy's chainsaw is heard revving and quickly approaching, the end.
---
True that, you'll most definitely get better at the game watching his videos since he teaches you what the perks do and how to use them effectively for killer and survivor not to mention just watching him play will help you become a better mind gamer 
---
We are pretty much trying to make the same point. DS isn't situational and thats the problem. I'd propose for Decisive Strike to be an exhaustion perk, that way, if you already managed to get away from the killer with sprint burst, ballanced landing, etc, you can't waste more of their time with decisive
---
Fair enough. Trapper is a classic 
---
Ok. 
---
Well, you're LF. At R1 you're going to get genrushed and 99.9 percent of the time basically have to M1, using your chainsaw very rarely. 
---
I can't run ruin because it's a hex perk, and what good would sloppy butcher do?
---
I don't use it, I just pull them out of the locker when I seem them during a frenzy.
---
Favorite thing? The almighty pebble of course.
---
One of my teammates was waiting at the exit for a Myers yesterday. He got tier three right when he approached and tombstoned him within inches of escaping. Was one of the funnier things I’ve ever seen. 
---
does not change the fact that this is what you wrote down: "This add-on makes it so you can't hear the passive phasing sound"
---
Both sides are equally stupid and sweaty for holding each other hostage lol. 
---
because in the other way around the game punish survivor for the same things: black pip (or no maybe), not getting good BP ... it's a "moral" punishment what i want to intend. You do that to me? Nice! You like if i do that to you? No? So don't do it anymore. Is the message clear? Im not english, im italian and i have some problems about explain what i want to explain in english 😅
---
Gen rushing isn't a negative thing whatsoever
---
Survivor is sweaty for trying to survive. - Killers 
---
I think PGTW is a great perk but I usually pair it with overcharge just to be an asshole
---
That's actually a pretty good idea. 
---
Minor misunderstanding, at the end i didn't mean gens left until the exit gates i meant how many have to be done for it to spawn
---
There is no killer in this chapter. This is a single licensed survivor. Just like Leatherface was when he came out as well as Bill. 
---
It doesnt matter of quantity
---
I'm not salty I'm just making sure you dont get an infection from sliding off the hook. Watching out you survivors. 
---
Tier 10 Myers 
---
I ain't gonna be harsh to you my man. But I do know what a fact is. And "BaggyBalls" does make a fair point. 
---
As someone who is rank 1, can confirm.
---
Well true righr?
---
at this point, if they made a dlc that fixed the game that I had to pay for I probably would. Just fix the game already! its too damn good to be in this state for this long
---
Quality of the game doesn't make them big bucks though.
---
Releasing half-assed does the trick though!
---
Pretty much, despite what a lot of people think most players ive seen in red ranks play no better, maybe even worse, than other ranks.  Its just the fact they play more frequently but good lord, are some red rank players bad.  I am by no means a highly lethal killer, but damn I am mildly surprised at many games I am losing only to suddenly get a 4k, and in case you are wondering I never run NOED or RUIN, those perks bore me and really arent needed at all
---
You may hate me for this but I feel like the Insidious perk was specifically created for camping. When you hook up a guy having BBQ and you see 2 people are missing, they're most likely camping the hook and waiting for easy unhooks. I don't use Insidious but I can see why it would work great in this scenario. It may not be nice but it's efficient.
---
Yeah ive noticed this, no idea what the hell happened.  Went from incredibly long Killer queue times to the complete opposite...like wtf
---
...Where did that piano come from? 
---
Ok. Wasn't Bill a free chapter?
---
Lmao all you have to do is reactivate evil within and it mori's the entire game.
---
Well from what I've read, the red ranks have long queue times in general since very few folks play there.
---
And my axe!
---
I've only disconnected once and it was because I was already in a shit mood and was going up against an extremely laggy Myers, he would hit someone halfway across the map, then suddenly I'd get wanked off the generator. I just gave up and didn't want to waste another five minutes
---
Funny how so many people complain about camping in the game, yet this perk exist.  Oh the irony lol
---
I think he was. I play Dbd through PS4 so idk. 
---
Not sure the RSPCA would approve hurling crows in a video game.
---
Usually get 3-4Ks with 1 or 2 gens left w/ 4k.  Playing killer has never been easier, especially if you understand how the survivors play. 
---
Proxy chasing is infuriatingly broken.
---
I never really feel bad for streamers, mainly because most of them are scummy and usually report me for beating them in-game. Sometimes i think that if i were to be banned it would have to be by a streamer, i just say "ez clap" and leave instantly. Gets a better reaction out of them. 
---
I play Pig. Half of the time I win, i kill everyone before they get four gens done because I stall the shit out of the match and group gens together. Almost entirely of the other half they get down to one or zero gens and I finish off 1 to 3 of them before they can escape due to reverse bear trap. Three kills is an absolute a-ok win to me. But y'know I'm not the best rank one killer on the world. I lose two survivors and even three more times than I'd like to admit.
---
Guys, I don't think someone playing killer for the first time is gonna have ruin, spirit fury, bamboozle, etc.
---
I play as Spirit, so it'll be easier to find and kick a gen quickly.
---
Killers have it too easy to pip, survivors have it too easy to depip. Like man, I couldn't finish a generstor because I was busy unhooking my whole team and healing them various times as well as looping the killer so they could finish them. Why you -1 me? And I didn't get a single kill and got 2 hooks. Why you +300 me?
---
when you have spent enough time playing this game, you develop a mental map of where hex totems can spawn, because they follow a pattern. that's why ruin totem can be cleansed so fast early in the game in high rank games.
---
I went for self care first, healing anytime you want multiple times seems more worth for me.
---
What?
---
Really?
---
last time i used that , we gen rushed to the nearest  gen in a shack....
---
was making great progress.... , 
---
were all on discord and loudly chatting away..... 
---
i said : "hey would be funny if leather face pops up"
---
everyone else : \*laughs in survivor\*
---
killer : \*pops up in leatherface\*
---
downed three of us.
---
You think console would also be getting dedicated servers? Oh honey...
---
Looks like a slug party to me.
---
Sprint burst, you can just bring a medical kit. You'll get distance from the killer, and if you bring Urban Evasion, you could crouch walk to charge it up while being stealthy and fast!
---
Hag would be amazing to watch. I wanna see her tearing out Dwight's kidneys with her fingers :D
---
Killer lunges I swear
---
Thanks! Normally, I have a great time. I'm still learning the game and the majority of players are actually just trying to play the game too. Last night I just got so angry about it and I do just need to ignore the trolls. 
---
I mean I feel like all of this is called latency issues ha
---
Tru. That’s somethin u only learn with experience is that getting the save is pretty much just as good as escaping. At least look for the totem before running out
---
do you already have an exhaustion perk or not ?  
---
If not I'll take sprint burst. If you do I'll take self-care.
---
I feel your pain as a Pig, Freddy main
---
Why Dwight :(
---
I like the characters. Especially the killers. It really gives me the warm and fuzzies when I get obliterated by a killer I think is cute. 
---
THIS!
---
Some games it’s really useful and you’ll find that it slows down the game a lot. Other games you’ll end up prioritising chases over kicking gens (which you usually should), and you’ll barely get any use out of it. The timer hurts it a lot, but if you’re playing a character with decent mobility it can be useful. 
---
Why, he's the bearer of the tastiest kidneys of course. And ruggedly handsome to boot!
---
oh yes.. the 5 year old kids defense.. "BUT HE DID IT FIRST REEEEEEE".. lol. Nice to see you're that fragile you need to lash out instead of just being the better person. 
---
Yep, useful when the killer just won't leave quick enough
---
Dwight lives matter.
---
Now that’s one aroused Myers alright xD
---
Camping is legit, it has always been. 
---
But that doesn't change the fact that staying near a hooked surv when you're sure no one's close and/or tries to rescue is counterproductive and toxic.
---
Anything else isn't camping.
---
I play spirit so I should be good.
---
Sprint Burst, as it lets you play with no spacial awareness.  
---
I'd recommend getting We're Gonna Live Forever first for bloodpoints and as for exhaustion perks, Dead Hard and Balanced Landing are great. Sprint Burst isn't my type of perk.
---
Yeah, he fills a huge hole in the survivor team. Who else will keep the lockers warm?
---
I started DBD with Huntress and Wraith and then i found Nurse. Never looked back.
---
That's a campin.
---
To answer your question, Steam (PC) gives developers free rain to monitor and control there own games, they ban players/add updates as they please, however Microsoft and Sony are in charge of their respective services BHR have zero say over bans on consoles. 
---
That perk is situational it only work against weebs. 
---
RTX ON!
---
Hillbilly is tier a killer ( even though he cant turn well
---
I just want them to fix sounds so i can actually hear survivors or play spirit again becouse spirit at the moment is tbh unplayable.
---
How is the player going on ps4?
---
*Plays in korean server*
---
*All hex totems are gone within a minute*
---
[Anger in Korean]
---
So instead you potentially throw the entire match away just so you you can stop yourself from being blinded? That doesn't sound like a reasonable solution.
---
This is something you learn as you play the game, but this is a nice summary of it. Totems have set spawn locations and you memorize them sooner than you'd think.
---
Comfort thinking that maybe you were about to give a T1 Myers without Jigsaw Pieces a free go
---
Just do thing that Valve did with CS:GO: time penalties for quitters. 
---
So, you prefer survivors rushing gens instead of giving you free hits? I play killer as well and i win just fine in rank 1 without camping and tunneling, so i guess you're just bad at killer. And camping while exits are open is understandable. 
---
You know, Killers with long weapons i.e. Hillbilly and Spirit can hit you through the neighborhood Haddonfield fence windows next to most houses.
---
Even in my most embarrassing moments I’ve yet to DC. Just take the L and die on hook. Or on the ground. DC will let the killer win in their bad intentions or screw the team over every single time 
---
but meg t h i c c tho
---
who needs more than meg
---
Wraiths who run past you to block a pallet so you can't run through or drop it and they get a free hit.
---
Slow all abilities within 10 meters? What do you mean by abilities?
---
Sometimes I Mori spam because I forgot you have to fill a damn bar to Mori. I usually press it, the bar fills half full and let it go and wonder why the hell the animation didn't play and then try again. -.-
---
I feel like I'm one of the few people that doesn't do this because in most cases it's exactly what they want you to do. It's something else if an entire group of survivors does it, but if it's just one of them acting like a disrespectful shit, they probably want you to focus all your attention on them so that their friends can work on generators in peace.
---
But what OP is trying to show us here is that if a killer runs ruin (only) the hex totem spawns always in a certain area, so you have not to search the whole map for it. Seems interesting. 
---
Huntress would be a cool one! Also, make sure to share it with us if possible. 
---
Myers isn’t good. Takes way too long to get the ball rolling. 
---
Well since they are facing the best killers now we shall see. 
---
Also pretty much anyone can do good with SWF 
---
If you play solo go for SC as randos are not very reliable.... 
---
If you play SWF pick whichever one you prefer really as both are decent enough to use.
---
Learn where to trap, trap around loops and not at the pallet and use the add-ons that give you more traps as much as you can. Run ruin and hope it doesn't get destroyed early. Trapper isn't a killer with too big a learning curve and he's pretty weak when it really comes down to it.  
---
As for better killers I'd recommend Huntress, Billy, Spirit, Hag or Nurse.
---
Nice match
---
If you have TWO people going for flashlight blinds at once its nothing but clowns. Doens't matter if it is swf or not.
---
The real strength of Trapper is in his area denial in chases. Most survivors won't even try and loop an area unless they've already scouted it for traps which leads to faster downs. Anything else you get feels more like a bonus.
---
I still hate how they nerfed him in the most recent patch though, previously you would get a notification when a trap was disarmed along with a loud "SNAP" but now it makes a tiny "clink" noise with no notification. Very much hurts his area control.
---
Minute? It's a lot for a hex totem lifespan
---
I'm just gonna post whatever comes up in my head but here are some tips:
---
Tall grass is your best friend as trapper be sure to put traps in spots that are difficult to see.
---
When putting traps down avoid obvious spots like right under a pallet. Most pallet loops will have a patch of tall grass which you can place your trap in, they're much more hidden and should snag survivors more often.
---
Place your traps in choke points that you're pretty sure survivors will run through. There are dozens of spots on each map that will almost guarantee a survivor will run through.
---
Most addons are fine with trapper but try using addons that compliment each other.
---
There should be some Youtube guides that explain trapper better than this.
---
&gt; Visualizing it by map like this will probably help devs realize the problem faster and do something about it.
---
Oh my sweet sweet summer child...
---
This post will probably be deleted as it attacks a loyal dbd twitch streamer that bhvr loves.  You played that so well and most killers would of fell apart at the end.  They gave you no props whatsoever and not only that they attacked you when they lost.  
---
Are they cheating or exploiting?  No, they are taking advantage of a broken system that allows multiple overpowered perks be played in the same group.  This is what bhvr did when they added swf.  They complained she had Franklin's.  Not noed, ruin or mori.  Other players continue to look up to streamers like these and continue to make the game the way it is.  You are influencers whether you believe it or not.  
---
This is why I kinda admire players like Pug and Tru.  I don't like pugs personality, but I respect the shit out of him for going solo.  Same with tru.  Always giving respect for players outplaying him.
---
It's a cheat program and is bannable if you're caught with it.
---
People who do that deserve to be farmed
---
Gen rushing isn't even really a thing anymore, it's the only objective survivors have.
---
Just run unnerving presence and enduring on every build and you will be fine 
---
Read enough shit on the sub for this game.
---
I seen someone like 2 or 3 weeks ago explaining what exploits and he listed things including, Flashlight blinds, pallet looping, any item that I think wasn't a toolbox and about half the decent survivor perks.
---
A lot of people really think it's toxic to the other side to just play the game. Like if you're killer and someone gets the 4% attempt escape, a lot of people will say you're toxic for not giving them a free escape. 
---
I've noticed this lately, like if you're on that swamp map with the small building that has no exit on the bottom until the gens done, if you run a hex, 99% of the time it's in the bottom area.
---
Usually you have to run Combat Straps with Video Tape for crouch/lunge to even be worth using. Combat Straps only affects the crouch part, unless you're using the tape you're better off just uncrouching for a normal M1.
---
Yep, I googled to check it out and have absolutely no desire to use it. I very rarely have latency issues when I join a lobby with a green ping.
---
They both are sweaty for holding each other hostage. Survivor wants to survive and killer wants to kill. They are both pointing a finger at each other like “wow look at this freaking tryhard who won’t just let me win”. 
---
They’re both idiots, Daniel. 
---
Can u detail me suprise wraith build? What addons perks etc ?
---
Not everyone runs WGLF. I don’t and I’ll only go back for a friend if they get hooked after they exist gates were powered. Or if the hooker guy healed me, then I’ll try and go for them. 
---
What a nuanced, rational and interesting opinion to read.
---
Not really. Wraith is currently my main, but for the most part I am just a digger for theorycrafting and I watch people who I know are good at the game. Aswell as doing my own testing. For example:  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/abh8bo/analysis_wraith_windstorm_addon_movementspeed/?st=jqmgjl9e&amp;sh=af1b0d13  
---
While I might be a Wraith specialist in the future, I just play him as my main for the moment. 
---
To be fair, speaking for me personally - Unless I have been chased all game, I don't mind risking my life to save someone. The thrill I get in the game is being chased by the killer, not by doing gens or running out the gates. You best believe I'm coming back to save you even if I'm dead on hook! (Thank you borrowed time &lt;3) :)
---
Nope, because there are uses for Insidious even when you know that survivors are near, for example preventing Borrowed Time.
---
However, even it is, I also consider DS toxic, and that one's a valid game mechanic aswell, it just isn't all that much fun to be hit by.
---
I still prefer running Windstorm + Swift Hunt for the insane bodyblocking you can pull off. Nothing quite beats chasing a survivor in stealth running to a pallet/window and getting there before they do, forcing them to turn around and run or get hit. Windstorm also gives you some insane map pressure since you can usually cross a big map in less than 20 seconds.
---
I noticed a similar thing. Every time I spawn on Grim Pantry the hex is always, without fail, in the lower floor of the small 2-story shack.
---
Sure, but making sure vision of the traps is obscured it will be less likely they'll be discovered.
---
Because they cant follow through, so they stay mute
---
So serious that I flaired as shitpost
---
All killers weapons have the same hitbox
---
Something tells me you really think thats true lol. 
---
Definitely. 
---
This is the exact point I stop playing the fun villain in a horror movie that plays with their prey and just yeet the survivors. Yknow how sometimes you pity people and let em go? Yeah, no more.
---
You really prove that the DBD community is a bunch of salty crybabies.
---
I disagree considering self care just got a nerf and a lot of killers capitolize on it by running sloppy butcher. I find im playing against sloppy butcher at least 1 in 3 games, which is why even though i run self care as a backup i often just have teammates heal me.
---
This isn't my match to clarify unless I'm reading that wrong.
---
do you realize that her goal is to entertain her viewers while she is having fun playing a game.  It is actually kind of pathetic that you feel the need to come onto reddit and talk shit on someone.  The whole toxic thing with this game is hilarious too.  You're toxic for teabagging, flashlights, etc.  
---
Not my match. The video is linked from the killer/player's YouTube channel. 
---
Yea it's hard to detect sarcasm in text, especially if I don't put /s I guess.
---
But I assure you this is what I truly believe.
---
You put shape in c and nurse at the bottom? Are you okay?
---
If they run BBQ on all their killers 100% of the time, maybe.
---
I was having this issue as the killer. When I play survivor the wait times aren't really bad, but the problem I am having is these people playing killer with their terrible internet. Last night I ended up in a lobby with some guy that had 300 ping and the night before that kept coming across 200+ ping lobbies. Fortunately leaving the lobby only puts like a 5 second cooldown for your next chance to search, but it is still annoying these people with horrible internet are hosting and lagging all over.
---
Bro the spirit is a lot better than what you're putting her at. 
---
Not really an unpopular opinion, nobody really cares about bloodpoint changes if people get more.
---
"hurls crows" 
---
Soo.... Fiddlesticks? lol
---
Mostly think you believed that becaude you think most streamers actually try with their swf group lol. 
---
Pallet looping is also toxic. So is adrenaline.
---
This is a console tier list and Nurse is definitely at the bottom. Shape is C tier in my mind. I’m a devotion 4 killer main.
---
No they don’t.
---
Love the idea.  Problem: if the devs even touched the code for the crows, the game would have a bad time.
---
suggestion: fix this shit killer 
---
thats something i wanted to try.
---
put on KO and chase people to some odd corner, down and abandon em.
---
Had someone who was downing and not hooking once, kept us very busy and try to save our downed mates. he would down one and patrol by on his way to check out gens.
---
Dedicated servers and hit box fixes pls
---
Trapdoor?
---
Ooo emojis 
---
You're entitled to believe whatever you want to believe
---
I’m surprised nobody has done this until now, tbh. 
---
TheEntityLeftHand had one that lasted for 4 hours 5 minutes
---
Imagine turning down triple those points to go back and you get hit before you even touch a totem or hooked survivor.
---
I like that idea, right now all of the cut coin offerings are pretty much worthless. This could actually have a place in the game.
---
I never said it was. I'm saying it was a swift victory by them and usually in the end game chat they'll be toxic. So it leads to a negative feeling about the whole thing.
---
It's crazy that they would complain about franklin's. Seems as if they looked at the perks and were trying really hard to find anything to cry about. Especially with the one player doing a last second swap before the match. Cheers to the killer for hanging in there until the end and pulling out that win. 
---
The number of survivors alive + 1= the amount of gens needed to be complete. So if you are alone you need 2 gens done. If there are 2 of you you need 3 done. 3 of you=4 done and all 5 of you it will spawn once all 5 gens are complete.
---
If you all haven't figured it out by now - looking at the comments - these lists are completely subjective and a waste of time.   
---
You might as well try and pass off your "list of favorite Marvel movies" as objective as well. 
---
Leatherface is under valued and underrated, hence my B tier rating.  Also: Huntress B tier on console? No way.
---
So basically everyone is free to do everything they want because the banning process is so complicated to follow it through anyway 
---
The absolute hardon you guys have for Jen is a little..much?  If Jen bothers y'all so much just you know....move on? The drama over a streamer is ridiculous. 
---
I personally don't dig Jen's SWF group myself, but I really only have to see her in other streams.
---
It does
---
Most of the lists are I agree, mine is objective though and factual.
---
Little story. I have 350 hours in, like 340 of which are survivor hours. I finally began to play killer all day yesterday. Now, I’d like to think I’m not a toxic survivor. I don’t bring flashlights cuz i suck at them, I don’t teabag, etc etc. I always thought killers were just exaggerating, but my god! I was rank 13 and got nothing but SWF groups using flashlights, teabagging, and being salty. Calling me baby killer because I’ve never used nurse before and actually suck at her, jeez. I just told them all “congratulations you beat a noob” both sides are toxic honestly, I just think that for whatever reason this game brings out the worst in people. Also, from my experience in the DbD discord, most of the ppl that play this game on pc are fucking adults!
---
A trolls gotta troll I guess. Welp I tried. 
---
Yeah you gotta go over and pretend to pick them up, slightly adjusting your stance... The key is that last little shuffle over their body before the sudden turn and long press M1.
---
He could've just faced the wall when picking the survivor up, I always try to do that as killer so the others cant do anything to me. Plus the extra hits on those survivors are amazing as you can now hunt them down.
---
&gt;DbD devs 
---
&gt;Devs that fix a problem
---
Pick one
---
That’s just stupid 
---
I always bring deerstalker to SWF.
---
But they could just do this in KYF??
---
I would say, at about killer rank 8 your traps will get destroyed quite often. At lower ranks you can get quite a lot of catches with them.
---
The problem with legion is more than a numbers buff.(600 hours rank 1 survivor and killer) He is weak if you use his power the intended way. But on the other token it's so god damn easy to cheese the fucking chase and get free downs by just following. They need to rework his power at this point because if they buff him in any aspect it will make him over powered because of how easy it is to cheese the power and get a free down. Which is infuriating to go down to something with 0 counter play. It's hilarious how behavior managed to release a killer that sounds so good in theory but also is both super weak and un-counterable. They also just need to change his power so the other half of the damn perks will work with him
---
Yeah they're definitely longer than before, but not over 1-2 minutes (purple ranks). Also ping tends to be trash once you get a lobby more often.
---
Killer queues however are amazing, you get 4 survivors in like 4 seconds.
---
I used to agree but I'm pretty decent with Huntress now. My Xbox doesn't seem to drop frames much when I throw hatchets anymore, apart from the first hatchet of every game. I almost always survive against Leatherface unless they're camping.
---
The thing with survivors abusing pallets and windows when the gates are already open is annoying as hell, you’re right.
---
But sometimes stealth won’t always work, especially against a good killer. The survivor will just be making themselves easier to hit since they are likely sitting in one spot to attempt stealth.
---
Yeah if it's the person's first hook then I'll stay back and try to break the totem and get them out.
---
Second hook? Depends on whether or not I know the location of the hex. Sometimes I see every totem, some games I don't see any. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Yep people can’t get banned from dead by daylight console. 
---
Well she's a girl gamer so my hard-on should be justified.
---
;)
---
They do. 
---
I for one am excited for the next killer so I have fewer killers (relatively) against whom to DC.
---
I need That FieldWorker! NOW!!
---
lower your graphic settings?
---
Instead of a new killer I'd like a perk pack (3-5 perks for both killers and survivors) and balance changes.
---
&gt;I feel like survivors should be able to freely pick an aura reading perk, again, killer main here.
---
The balance here would be to give all survivors kindred level 3 as a passive ability instead of perk.
---
/u/BEEFJAKE
---
I instinctively would've faced rewards that wall licking her up
---
Killer whining about bullying that didn’t take place whatsoever.
---
What
---
Well an example is wretched shop, it can spawn behind shack. Tbh I’m too tired to list more off rn but I’ll try to get back to you later on. 
---
I’d just suggest the people who did this just use a larger pool than 20 try’s...
---
When I play billy and see a hidden survivor offering I always hope they burned that one. At that point it can become a speedrun game and is fun. I'll also burn the offering while playing with friends as SWF and slam the nearest pallet when we load in. It's just a fun offering for me on both sides. 
---
Just because koreans did this doesn't mean its 100% accurate. I have seen ruin spawn literally anywhere on the maps that totems could spawn  regardless if ruin is the only hex or not. Maybe they have higher chances of spawning in those red squares  (idc about frequency) but they will not always spawn there.
---
Upvote cause you still got the hook
---
It is not just for the bugs, but for new players as well.  Each new killer raises the skill floor for survivors, and makes it more difficult for new players to get into the game.  I'm at over 100 hours on survivor and continue to struggle with basics.
---
What bullying? If anything the killer BMed them multiple times.
---
The meme build. SWF?
---
I hate using Insidious just because I feel I always need to be on the move as a Killer. Just standing still for any amount of time feels like a waste to me.
---
Idk how laggy huntress is on console. If she is not laggy, then she should be in the A rank also switch the legion with the clown then it’ll be spot on.
---
I think when you are the last survivor and at least 2 generators have been powered, the hatch should appear and unlock but be closed. You gotta open it before jumping in automatically. 
---
I love the matchmaking
---
I'll even run Resilience and just keep powering through gens. Resilience, prove thyself, leader, and bond. Add a toolbox on top of it and gens get done so fast. 
---
amyaltaria :)
---
Solo
---
I've always wondered where the lines is between how much you have to watch a streamer to form an opinion about them and "don't like don't watch"
---
Because I've tried to voice my complaints about her, Zubat, Scott, Bahroo, and Morf in the past and it's like there's no way to win with their fanbase.  
---
I will agree though, apparently a reddit post or two is enough to set them off and cause enough of a reaction that we get very passionate twitter threads and screeds on their streams. 
---
All from people who will one minute espouse the "Hey, fuck you, I'm going to play the way I want to play!" and the next minute "Fuck this guy for playing how he wants to play, what a fucking lose, no-life sweaty tryhard!"
---
Guess you're only allowed to enjoy this game how you want if you're a popular streamer.
---
Why do you mori him? I haven’t watched much of him, but is it because he has like 100 ebony moris on every killer and isn’t shy at using them? Because that’s the first thing I noticed when I pulled up his stream
---
its called the "10 foot lag knife" common in games without dedicated servers lol
---
I’ve been running no mither, resilience, dead hard, and deliverance this week and it’s pretty fun honestly 
---
Yea...I can run a killer around for days on most coldwind maps
---
Looks like an intense game for the BP. Not for the Jake or Feng tho, whoever it is died early.
---
Yeah, they just changed that mechanic entirely here recently.
---
Try this. No vaulting. Just stand on the other side of a window too close to it and let the killer swing at you. You will get hit.
---
This was not always the case. Only recently has it been a thing.
---
I very rarely get campers at rank 1. Honestly I hardly ever see them if at all, and when I do they get smoked. 
---
Considering how much a survivor dc can affect the flow of the game i feel like they should be equal.
---
And surviors should also receive a bonus if another dc's
---
5 minutes is way too long. 
---
Agreed. When a killer quits it ends the game and allows no further points to be gained bc the game ends. When a survivor quits the game goes on and people playing can still get BP and possibly PIP.   
---
If you host, you bare a responsibility. It's a give and take. 
---
She suffers from various performance issues when throwing, makes it pretty difficult to throw the hatchets, especially trying to aim with a joystick as opposed to a mouse. 
---
Ikr!  Everyone was shitting themselves because they pulled a red bulb after getting 3 or 4 party streamers.  You know what would have happened with a normal bloodweb?  You would have plowed through some actually semi useful shit on your way to a red bulb.
---
Not an unpopular opinion, however the bonus when someone disconnects is a delicate topic.

Bullshit.   Grade A Douche had "how hard is your cock right now"  typed out and ready to go the second she responded with 4 ds.  Quit trying to justify their actions.   
---
he's fast... that's all you need to know place your traps. then run after the survivors.  you have the fastest base movement speed.
---
Stopped playing dbd months ago as when i was playing killer i was completely polite everytime because i loved this game and wanted the community to finally reunion. Saved 150purple flashlights on meg tho. If i was using one 8/10 matches i would get told im fucking trash toxic shit cause of DS and Flashlight. Thats when i understanded "I WILL USE ALL 150" did it and stopped playing. 
---
Huntress tends to use it for those fast reloads.
---
Yea ok. Gotten to rank 3 just fine without doing either. So yea. Totally a bad killer 😆 😆 😆
---
This. These maps are completely false, and the koreans should feel bad for trying. I've had my ruin/seen ruin spawn literally anywhere totems can spawn in general. 20 tries per map is NOT a good sample size. 100+ at least to get a decent understanding. 
---
Asks specifically for console wraiths to not do this
---
"Lower your graphic settings" he says...
---
Super easy to pip as survivor and easy to pip as killer in my opinion
---
What are their actions? Using survivor perks?
---
Yeah they were butthurt after the game and that was stupid, but the video talks about how bullied the killer was during the game. I'm just not seeing that.
---
The camping Leatherfaces give him a bad reputation. He's actually very viable with the right addons. Instadowns and multidown potential at 115 movement speed is pretty great. 
---
I played a clean game against him only to find him tbagging me at exit. Day what you want but I always see it as a spit in my face, so I run them from that point on whenever I have someone do it to me
---
In all honesty, I dont think matchmaking isyour issue.  Sounds like you are really bad at killer and would play more before complaining.  Use the skills you have as a survivor to counter survivor as a killer.
---
What reddit post
---
Well I guess you're just dumber than a dickbox, can't help you there. 
---
&gt; Considering how much a survivor dc can affect the flow of the game
---
Killer DCs end games.
---
I’m at work trying so hard not to laugh out loud.
---
Survivor's DCs can end other survivors games too
---
I believe it's just the people playing on console having these issues so unfortunately that isn't an option for them :/
---
I remember there being a exploit with Dwight where people got treated as rank 20 for matchmaking. Unsure if it's been patched. Anyone come in as Dwight and switch?
---
Well, I don't know. Making a brief, telegraphed delay or something before teleporting would make her jukable, but still able to ignore conventional means of escape. Nirse wouldn't be any worse for good players, but would have meaningful counterplay with the ability to mindgame and juke.
---
Damn I just got caught by one but she hooked me after so I didn't know how to remove it.
---
 I do the throw out. If a player gets hit by a cheap one hit I am using at end game I take them out gate. I only use noed on one shot killers as a gag and then it is only on a blue moon. I'm only sweaty for the fourth kill if the player did not earn their spot. Otherwise I like to lawn dart the hatch.
---
I used cold wind and they did a swamp

Dota has a Pseudorandom chance thing (forget the actual term) for Chance based things that works the same way. It prevents some things from triggering way too often, and prevents the same things from never triggering. So, a 25% chance may be 7% the first attempt, 17% the second, 27% the third, and increase until its 100%.
---
Some of them have slightly larger or fatter hit boxes. Don’t be such a dick 
---
Myers is one of the only killers that genuinely spooks me lol, other one that spooks me is spirit with prayer beads.

There is no need to look to be honest, if there is a wall, always use it, you never know if they found a flashlight in a chest.
---
It can light up if you break all the totems and i always make sure to do it, because 8/10 games the killer seems to be using that
---
Also when is piggy girl going to get some real deviousness bp gainz? its so bad. 
---
That's why I love the nerf to SB. Once I see my exhaustion almost gone I just start running to be able to use it when I want. That nerf was actually a buff to me.
---
How many gens are left after those 5 minutes? 2 at the very most. 
---
1. I know I wasn't initially asking for solutions. Now I am. Its called human discussion, you should get used to it if you use reddit.
---
2. I'm playing in rank 10 in this game. My point was that better players won't heal anywhere near the killer. My point still stands.
---
3. Alright then, let the killer gamble on if the Hex totem will spawn up a survivor's ass or not. And if they lose the gamble, they get genrushed to shit. Sounds fair doesn't it. The RNG is fantastic.
---
Stalkyboi strikes again. 
---
It's possible. But those games are too few and far between. They're outliers on the bell curve. 
---
It's called sterotypes. Just like any other sterotypes, there is a slight truth to it which then get hyper exagerated. In amount, percentage of how many times its actually true and so on.
---
What is pinky finger?
---
2. Yes work on claudette but Dwight is questionable, i later went to david for dead hard and live forever, then nea and meg.
---
That was the guy i talking about, forgot his name
---
I've managed to do this before and got a grab! I was Myers and dropped down that hole without them hearing the breathing or the actual drop and grabbed them right off the gen. :D
---
Nurse is still really good I would say, she is just harder to play.
---
&gt;All 4 of them died after an intense game with a Hag who is using no "Try-hard" perks or add-ons
---
"It's only because we wanted to lose"
---
Yea, that says a lot right there.
---
Im a killer main so my view is allways gonna be sided.
---
&gt;I also agree about survivors receiving a bonus when a killer DCs.
---
And i meant that other survivor's should get a bonus when another survivor disconnects. Im not sure if i worded that properly
---
&gt; Except it's more than that. You can run killers like Trapper and even Hillbilly around for a minute or more if you're a decent survivor,
---
I would argue that the ability to loop is infinitely more dependent on the perks the Survivor's are using and the map they get. You make it seem like "Well, if the Survivor is really good" in which case, if the guy lucks out and there's 3 pallets right next to each other and he can get away to the main building in Disturbed Ward that was 100% because of the map and not because of his "skill."
---
I don't know people like this insist that they're good when they're just handed amazing RNG (bad RNG for the Killer) like that. The mental gymnastics are real, mang. 
---
Most killers I go against never protect their hex totems so they get broken right at the start of the game

very, very standard build
---
I personally would rather count on perks that help me with chases throughout the entire game and dislike counting on perks like NOED, BW, etc... But Freddy's endgame is really strong because of his power.

I'd recommend trying out actually good killers and go for builds that are more chase-focused though.

I'd also add that if there's any item you need to "learn" how to use it'd be the flashlight which doesn't work against any killer that can look up, down or at a wall.  
---
The strongest item in my opinion, would have to be the toolbox while the strongest add-on would be the *anti-hemorrhage syringe* you'll soon figure out why. 
---
Oh I have. It's just a different perspective going into a game like this. Its almost like you want to reach the endgame so you will be at your most powerful. I understand its not super viable but its a nice change to racing the clock hoping they dont finish all the gens. Its almost the exact opposite.
---
He has above average map pressure, more map pressure than Clown. When he goes into killer instinct he can locate any survivor. 
---
Except Nurse can SEE people when using her power; can ignore pallets, windows, walls and floors and can use her power more frequently.
---
I fucked up, it’s a typo lol
---
Claudette: Pallet? I’ve never heard of this thing called a ‘pallet’ I just hide in my surroundings and try to blend in.
---
Yeah but that is the thing, he needs everything to go right for him or he gets his shit pushed in.

https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Random_distribution
---
&gt;The pseudo-random distribution (often shortened to PRD) in Dota 2 refers to a statistical mechanic of how certain probability-based items and abilities work. In this implementation the event's chance increases every time it does not occur, but is lower in the first place as compensation. This results in the effects occurring more consistently.
---
He's just as easy to loop as any other killer, yes, but when he catches you in the right areas or without a pallet you're going to get downed. 
---
Omg this is so messed up
---
How about the survivors that rather use things like dark sense, empathy or even deja vu?
---
You got balls of steel.
---
The higher ranks can be consistently toxic. I've been a rank 1 both at survivor and killer with 2500 hours in game. The higher you go, the more toxic. Just shrug it off and take those games as a challenge to better your skills. 
---
But the racism, report that trash.  There is no place in any community for that garbage.  
---
4 stack swf  
---
BM from both sides  
---
shittalking each other at the end  
---
isn't this the same every match?
---
And its fun to see 2 survivors waiting in a gate as i hook one so they can come in for the save only to be greeted with bloodwarden and you get an endgame 4k
---
I know what you meant, but I feel like the guy I responded to didn't
---
Bone Clapper makes the volume the same around its entire radius. Coxcombed Clapper makes it silent.
---
Even so if you're coming to a gen that has multiple directions to enter from Survivors will often be confused as to where you're coming from. And if you give yourself a bit of a run up the supressed TR can be quite helpful.
---
I think it applies any time you are being healed. I know when I press crouch while being healed, my camera moves. So I think being healed causes your model to change, but your hitbox doesn't. Crouching probably makes your hitbox closer to your regular hitbox. I haven't really tested this, but I'm guessing.
---
Each blink adds some time to the cooldown(either half or one second if I recall correctly.), the base blink has a 1.5 second cooldown(I believe) and a swing adds 1 second.  
---
Nurse is the most broken killer in this game. In both the sense that she's incredibly strong and that she ignores the game's mechanics so if you're starting to learn killer, don't go with her.  
---
As to how you get better at Nurse, learn her default blink timings and don't use add-ons. Know that you can blink down to shorten your blink's distance(you'll blink for the same amount of time) and learn how to "counter" people running at you. The most important thing you should be concerned about is knowing where the survivor's going to go next. Whether it's visually or predicting it.  
---
You should use your first blink to catch up with the survivor and the second one to guarantee a hit and/or bait out Dead Hard.
---
Indeed, as a kiler main I am all about getting the current decisive strike out of the game, however, I think it has an easy solution: make it an exhaustion perk, so it doesn't work as well on builds that are already annoying to go against.
---
If you're trying to get to the end, your build is almost perfect.
---
Distressing nurse gives me super anxiety.
---
If you're near a wall when picking up a survivor you should always face it, because flashlights have a specific angle they can blind, and the wall will block 95% of the angle while you're animation locked.
---
If you have played Friday the 13th the game it works like the shift ability but with a small window to hit someone. Then a cooldown
---
I hope your joking yes playing pallet loops/jungle gyms requires skill. 
---
"You think I care 'cause I facecamp? Lol, why you so mad over getting facecamped, just get better at the game and don't get hooked".
---
Not my personal opinion (mostly 'cause I play both Killer and Survivor) but it totally works the other way around. You don't define how to play the game for others in such a subjective, open-ended game.
---
#NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Agreed on Huntress and Clown. I've said that there should be an Exhaustion debuff as well as a "Sprint Burst Exhaustion" that doesn't go down during a chase.
---
As for burn mechanics it's tied to Nurse and Wraith because of loar reasons (they travel between planes of existance or whatever) but also due to balancing concerns since it's a lot harder to blind these two killers. (Especially Wraith since he's invisible.) I honestly think the mechanic could be removed (at least for Wraith since Wraith is much weaker in the current version of the game than he was on release) but it's not too bad and it gives counterplay to powers that are otherwise quite strong.
---
It's literally different for everyone. Nobody plays exactly the same of each killer. Nobody has the same opinion. To someone who plays nurse on console enough to be good with her, nurse is A tier.
---
Example - I would put both Pig and Hag into A- tier.
---
Sometimes easier depending on the killer. A lot of leatherfaces i go against start reving their chainsaw as they are coming towards a pallet. I just run through. At this point theybhave 2 choices. Finishing revving in and attempt to hit me which usually wont work since i gained distance and they respected the palletor cancel their chainsaw and continue the loop while being further back than if they had just m1'd. Continue this loop 3 times before they realize they have to m1 in which they get stunned. Go to the next loop and see if they have learned. If they havent you just do it again if they have now he is chasing you like a 'normal' m1 killer. But i agree with your second point. If you arent near anything. You dead.
---
The legion perk makes the survivor exposed and shows their aura after they leave a locker, hiding in a locker for anyone now hides their auras from the killer
---
That would be enjoyable, yes.

Hes also really good at making sure no one will ever leave the basement.
---
The first time I equipped a hex perk i literally jumped when the totem broke
---
Is there a way to properly submit it?
---
I repair the boat generator every time because I love the foghorn. I'm like a child. Every time I hear the horn go off, even as killer, I feel good.
---
You dead, but I’m not dead ;)
---
Why should you play Legion?  
---
As for your questions, the "Decreases the power gauge depletion on a *successful attack* makes it so your power bar doesn't completely empty and the cooldown decrease makes it so it takes less time to recover from Feral Frenzy, the fatigue time.
---
There's some details about Combat Straps being nerfed with base crouch being buffed according to some people. I don't have a source for that so take their word for it not mine.
---
*monkey paw curls one finger* 
---
Hexes are now removed from the game, replacing them with global effects affecting all survivors. The game is unplayable thanks to the lack of counterplay option the survivors have to the strong perks like Ruin and NOED, and quit the game a week after the patch launched. The game now is dead.
---
The Ghost Soot + Either Bone Clapper (Yellow Addon) or Coxcombed Clapper (Pink Addon)
---
Uncloak behind a wall when you know a Survivor's on a gen or something and then run up to them and hit them. Almost guarentees a hit unless the Survivor has Sprint Burst and god tier reaction time.
---
It's really strong with Nurse's Calling for that reason.
---
Are you playing solo ? I had the same thing playing with a friend, but playing solo is fine, takes up to 5 minutes and under a minute solo. I'm on PC though.
---
My guess would be it just fluctuates, sometimes we get less killers and sometimes less survivors.
---
well thats  lame :/ i guess its similar if you constantly chase the trapped survivor with pig and not allow them to take off the trap
---
Not to be mean but she is getting killed way more often at red ranks when I'm watching. This can be because killers are more tryhards, have moris more often, tunel and camp more often, snipe her, and etc. I think this is a DBD problem mostly. However, deranking does hurt the new players and also hurts and ruins the games of other people in the game with her when she (or other people, since she can actually be deranking with a group of friends and not hurting anyone's game) is deranking
---
Those look nice. Ribbons work very good as bookmarks. My DnD rulebooks have about 20 each so I can quick flip to sections 
---
"The killers on my ass!" 
---
A rank 15 whenever they hear a heartbeat.
---
Good point, I had forgotten about the camera moving if you crouch during a heal. Sounds like a bit of minor cleanup that just got sort of overlooked
---
They aren't overpowered, but without them most pig mains (including me) just wont play her till we can play with combat straps.
---
Rank 1 PS4 gameplay. Pretty good job so far.
---
Hmm, I guess you're right, my point still stands for the shape tho
---
crying about toxicity is hilarious man, did those words hurt your feelings?  Do you need your safe space?  Learn to take shit and give shit out, its fun.  
---
I've met my fair share of killers who get off on making sure the other side doesn't get to do anything.

Wait they didn't even blind you? What rank is this; 57?
---
What actions were taking place during the game from the survivors that constitutes bullying?
---
Reminds me of the time 3 people spent the entire match chasing me and clicking flashlights at me instead of doing gens.
---
Like I'm more confused and amused than angry.
---
Nurse is harder to use  but she still got that insane ass potential. Nurse is one of my secondaries and i can confirm
---
Is no one going to talk about no mither and self care being ran together? This build triggers tf outta me. 
---
What is noed? As I am still a noob
---
As a Killer main, I can confirm the opposite: The queue times are super low, I almost instantly have a match in the evenings. Also playing at red ranks.
---
Didn't they say they want to change something about the matchmaking? Maybe they did? I don't think 50% of the survivor population started to play killer.

What's the point of running bitter murmur as a p3 doctor? I would assume more times than not everyone at least has madness 2 showing you their location with the doctor auras and all you have to do is shock therapy that area and find them np. Not criticizing, I'm legit just curious about why you do this.
---
How will I save you?
---
Tru but being able to go around and insta down people immediately by pulling tier three outta nowhere many times per game is incredibly powerful. And having an add on that you can use tier three for practically the entire game? No words need to explain that
---
Start another one. Survivors dcing ruins the entirety of said game and makes it so you still have to play the rest.
---
I highly recommend Puppers as a great source of entertainment and skill. He's very genuinely nice with a smile always on his face. You can tell he's having fun and he doesn't let the stupid stuff that can happen in matches bring him down or trigger him (which is something I personally always look for, as I don't find people that QQ a bunch or rage DC to be entertaining or fun at all).
---
His skill level definitely shines more with survivor though, so if you're looking to learn loops then that's good. I've personally found that I have so much more knowledge on how to properly navigate maps and jungle gyms now. Looping used to be my biggest weakness and I often found myself playing much more stealth so that I wouldn't handicap my team. Now if I see a killer heading my way it's like "Bring it on Leatherbuns!"
---
The only potential downside for what you're looking for is that while Puppers uploads 2 video's a day normally, they are always pulled from his streams and not content directed towards teaching (like how say, HybridPanda or Monto will make videos with the sole purpose of showing/playing tailored builds). The upside though is that Puppers streams 6 days a week, usually 6+ hours. So if you end up checking twitch out then I'd say it's 100% worth checking his channel out. 
---
You don't need to spend money. She's 9k shards.
---
Love it
---
I say, consoles must be a complete shit show. I like it. 
---
And if the killer(correctly) slugs you?  
---
Then the perk becomes wasted.  
---
And if it's Nurse? or Hillbilly which outputs map pressure incredibly well? or even Huntress or Spirit?  
---
In my opinion, as you've presented here, there are way to many factors to count for and in a sense the perk is situational because of all those factors you need to consider. Every second chance perk in this game is situational and not necessary. Lets say the killer slugs you. What will you do then? Use unbreakable? And if he's got a hook near him, what then?
---
I don't "have to defend anyone" you belligerent asshat. I choose to because I enjoy the content provided. Currently working as a nurse saving peoples lives making 100 grand a year plus bonuses. The fuck are you doing with your life? We live in a capitalistic society , earning money is the measure of success in our society , who the fuck are you to say that them earning money in a way you don't see as "legitimate" makes it any less "earned".
---
Newsflash fuckface most "professional streamers provide their "content" for 8-12 hour 6-7 days of the week every week. Their success is entirely based upon the fruits of their labor. Just because you don't see it as valid doesn't mean shit. The end result is all that counts. They couldn't give a shit about you or your entitled attitude.  Maybe once you actually grow the fuck up and get to participating in the adult world you'll understand. Until then I guess keep being a twat and calling people on the internet "thots".
---
Imho, the bottom part about survivors, whether fair or not, is all extremely susceptible to abuse. I doubt any model will be deemed acceptable by DbD team, because it can possibly circumvent their profit model.
---
No one can hide from one that has no life muaha 👀😈

Meyers is the best man gives you that thrill of the chase man compared to others.
---
Delete this
---
It's just that most killers play in a "I down, I pick up" playstyle which makes decisive really shine. Against decent killers however, the perk is kind of useless by itself.
---
HAHAHAHA

she ded

Just use purple (franks?) Mix tape and the purple cold dirt add on and thats about all you need to know about legion.

I love legion. I love playing him. I never play killer except for dailys and have been playing him a lot but I'm still not good. I dont get those 2 hits a lot probably because I'm still learning. Legion is also my favorite to go against, right behind the nurse. I just think he's fun all around and I usually survive against him. I dont understand all the hate. 
---
damnnn 😂  cut me deep ! Lol I play this in my free time 😒
---
Touche.
---
Pipping is damn easy for survivors as well. If you arent getting gens done because you keep unhooking, you're probably being too altruistic. It's not a bad way to safety pip, but if you wanna pip you gotta understand that sometimes that guy is going to have to wait and/or die on hook.
---

---
The perks aren't bad, though. They're stupidly OP, and make the killer bad, but the perks aren't bad.
---
By doing a small amount of research. 
---
doesn't tell the location :|
---
Toxicity in survivors is basically t-bagging and flashlight spamming the killer. What op is inferring is that people who play Kate are generally very toxic.
---
Toolbox and medkit are not OP, but they are the unsung heroes.
---
Anyone else notice that pretty much no killer runs NOED at level 1? I hadn't seen it in a long time, then I grouped up with some friends and played level 10-15 killers and saw it almost every time.
---
Yeah that's what I'm saying. A tier list reflect how good a character is in this case Nurse if she is played to perfection.
---
To be honest, I never looked into how to pip as a survivor, I always assumed things.
---
Adding to the group thing. It takes, at least, 80 seconds to repair a gen without a toolbox or perks helping you. With a second person it's only 44 seconds. It helps but you also have to take into account if the killer finds you both that's two people not doing anything

I use them to buy cosmetics as cosmetics aren't too important for. I buy the characters with real money through steam as I get more value out of buying vs the time it takes to grind to get both of the characters.
---
But it truly depends on what you value more. 
---
If you're a new player and you don't want to buy all the characters or but want as many perks as you can get, then you can just spend them on the shrine. 
---
This has been happening a lot the past few days for me. It was really bad last night on PS4. Was duoing with a friend (both rank 1), and we usually find games within a minute, but we only managed to find one in about an hour last night.
---
That scream tho xD

If the concept of a mimic, doppleganger, pretend to be survivor killer was under it for the 20th time it would have been perfect.
---
As for the scare crow id actually love to see a killer use crows correctly. Aounds like a great idea
---
I'll be honest, when I play killer, I usually slug ds almost always unless they're right under a hook and I still manage to kill all four in most games. To me, DS is situational.  
---
I also hate the perk in general but that doesn't have to do with anything.
---
Definitely... seeing that loading screen come out of nowhere makes my heart warm and fuzzy lol.
---
They just shake their heads and hook me anyway.
---
Guess that's what I get for running DS...
---
&gt; what the play styles are to begin with
---
There are a ton of possibilities based on what perks you choose, but some common ideas are stealth, objectives, altruism/healing, evasion, survival, and aura reading.  Check the wiki too since they describe all the perks.
---
When the exit gates are powered, both gates will be visible to you for a few seconds.  It's helpful to look around when the last gen pops so you can at least see which direction you should be running in.  For the hatch (aka the black lock) there are a couple things to know; first, it won't appear until 1 more generator than there are living survivors have been completed.  So if 3 people are alive, you need to do 4 generators before the hatch will spawn.  The hatch only opens when the match is over/when one person is left, but when it does, it makes this weird sound so that's how you find it easier.
---
&gt;I’ve seen suggestions on taking them to 99% and then sabotage right as the killer is about to hook
---
This is very satisfying to do when you can actually pull it off, but it's kind of a waste of time in most situations, you're better off spending that 30 seconds working on a generator or a totem.
---
&gt;another survivor called me toxic for carrying a flashlight
---
lol, that's silly.  Flashlights are best used to blind the killer when he's carrying someone so they can escape, but you can also use them to remove the hex traps that the hag puts on the ground, just shine the light on them.  Also, "farming items" is kind of useless because you get so many in the bloodweb and you can only carry one at a time.
---
She got taken off the hook as soon as you stepped through that window too didnt she
---
If the doctor has the add on Restraint you can't really see the illusion its only there for 1 second so the point of having bitter murmur and NOED is that if they get all gens you can see everyone for 10 seconds if its Tier3 and with NOED you can basically find everyone and down them and get a easy win. I only take these add ons when i don't feel like trying so ill take Ruin,Murmur,NOED and sloppy of thanatophobia or Distressing with the Restraint so i always see where they are in case i need to slug to prevent hatch escape and ill take moldy electrode since i can shot people for farther away and not have a huge wait time so i can stop looping
---
Time to sort by controversial...
---
Sorry, still waiting on dedicated devs. 
---
Aren't we all
---
Im fuckin dead 😂😂😂
---
Hiding next to an open hatch waiting for the last survivor
---
the oerks arent even op.
---
Ruin: Useless trash
---
NOED: would be OP on Nurse except for the add-ons which make your blinks more crippled than a giraffe-ape hybrid with an extra chromosome and 3 legs, meaning it's super-easy to just cleanse all the dull totems. 
---
And yes, a Nurse that runs either is garbage BUT the perks also do jack-shit if you can't at least blink somewhat competently. 
---
Listen here you little shit...
---
*cries in bugs*
---
I finished a game yesterday with 317 deviousness total, iirc i got two kills that game too.
---
I once played with legion on the swamp map with devour hope tier 1. There was this one jate who kept pointing at lockers, so I frenzied, hit them and then saw that there was no one in the locker (if there was someone, their location would have been revealed because legions power goes trough lockers). Anyways, I never downed her, I just let her be in the location where I knew she was, she tried it multiple times after, anyways, I managed to get my 5th legion stack, got to the kate, who probably tought I'd just deep would her again (she didn't even bother healing) and I just downed and mori'd them, one of the most satisfying mori's, thats what you get for lying to me
---
If you seriously think that you need on any killer, especially on Nurse you're a dogshit player, you don't even need to slug as Nurse to win, she's just really fucking good at it. 
---
Who would win: the stalky boi (myers) or the stalky girl (claudette)
---
Nurse has even less use for Ruin than other killers. If you feel that Ruin helps you as Nurse you are just insecure and/or bad. 
---
Its a meme build.
---
1. Not even in your other post did you even ask for solutions. And its just called discussion, we cant exclude possible intelligent animals and extraterrestial beings.
---
2. At rank 10, you should be using nurse's anyway. It's not much benefit to you for the slot perk that is uses.
---
3. RNG is awesome, if there werent any, you think the survivors wouldn't find a way to manipulate it? HAH!
---
3.5 Genrushing is just literally playing the game the way it should be. Using this term like its a bad thing is ridiculous in every sense of the word. You want survivors to not do objectives and try to escape? 
---
I play both sides and find it pretty darn fair.
---
Yes. Some loops and jungle gyms do require skill, as long as they aren’t see through you have to predict where the killer is going. 
---
I’ve screamed like that myself many a times. Is this a YouTuber? 
---
As a killer main, I can't imagine this being an unpopular opinion. If anything, give survivors more bloodpoints overall, their bloodpoint gain is just weak. Disconnecting is a trash thing to do and everyone who suffers from this should be compensated. If I remember correctly, survivors also don't gt bloodpoints for a fellow survivor leaving, but killers do, this is pretty BS in my opinion since it more often ruins the game for fellow survivors than for the killer
---
Why would any killer that’s good get less use of ruin, like look at spirit or hag they’re both really good and people put ruin on them, but when it gets to nurse people say that they’re bad or insecure I just find it very odd.
---
The killers within the tiers are just in alphabetical order, not ranking. 
---
This is what Agitation - Iron Grasp - Mad Grit was built for.
---
Nurse is the only killer that needs it imo.
---
To be fair two flashlights blinds faster.
---
Decrease the power gauge depletion one hit: When you knife somebody normally it drains your power, this reduces that effect. 
---
Refill the power gauge makes your bar fill faster.
---
Decrease the cool down duration reduces your "AAAAAAGGGGGGHHHH" animation 
---
Decisive is fine both sides have their crutch perks.
---
That last image is what I look like IRL everytime I get hooked
---
I guess you're right in that sense.  
---
In response to your build, most killers will probably just think you missed it :/
---
I like your name u/Moneycraftkid420
---
No Mither's OP bro - David main
---
Throw in Self Care, you're showing you have no fear. I respect that.
---
This is hilarious!
---
Why the fuck can't we have nice things like these in Europe?! What do I have to do to get one of these in the mail?
---
If you’re on PC, keep at it. If you’re on PS4 or Xbone, move along. 
---
The legion sort of reverses the roll of the killer/survivors in a chase. The survivor has to rely on their juking skill and ability to outplay the killer rather than running around a pallet. For most of the killers they have to rely on mind games in the chase to win, now the survivors have to mind game the killer to live. 
---
I’m going to guess you just insidious camped as nurse, which is really sad on its own honestly
---
*Distant scream of a survivor’s leg being chomped hard as fuck*
---
Me: *drops everything as I experience dopamine levels that shouldn’t exist* ffffUCK YEAH
---
What "juking skill" is there exactly?  
---
Running around in a circle *correctly* is the whole point of a chase. There is no mind game involved whatsoever.
---
More than one person going for a flashlight save *is* the mistake. You're tying up three people (one on hook and two with flashlights), meaning survivor progression is down to nothing.
---
True. The issue I have with DBD fanart is that the in-game models tend to have some messed up faces (LOL), so either they draw accurate, but ugly characters, or different, but pretty characters. 
---
I love running NOED Nurse at red ranks. If I've been doing so-so the whole match, but then get a 4k because of NOED and hook dives, I get moist at the anticipation of the rage I'm about to get in post game chat.
---
Yeah, I was pretty stoned when I made the account 😆
---
Solid meme daddy like
---
A friend of mine likes to call it We're Gonna Farm Forever and i hate it
---
The killers within their respective tiers are all in alphabetical order, not ranking. Just FYI.
---
Mario?
---
* &gt; most of the map doesn't provide any cover
---
And that is also why survivor LOS is important also, because if there are no real places for totems to hide, there aren't really many places to lose LOS against killers. I swear some maps there's just heaps of dead zones that don't or barely work just crouching behind. I honestly would rather no survivors play immersed and urban evade all around the map either. It's unfun gameplay. 
---
The crows on the locker will do that
---
Not when they locker hop
---
Tyyyyyyyy 😊
---
So just go to the side where the moon is?
---
Let us know if there are! I'd happily pay for one/postage
---
This is actually pretty cool, some balancing and it could work
---
Wouldn’t change anything aside from they would tunnel you down every time instead of just sometimes. Chases would still be unwinnable as survivor. 
---
Thank you so much! Me and some users were talking about providence stun time being too long when it was 7/8/9s. 
---
Oh wow, this is amazing! Gave me a good laugh, thanku
---
I've got a clip of this exact scenario in haddonfield where I had JUST hit the ground and was about to run after jumping out the second story window and I was downed by the trappers 100 foot long ax thing. I looked up and there he was, still wiping his blade in the fucking 2nd story window.
---
I hope so, would definitely watch
---
You can sacrifice, mori, have them dc. 
---
Honestly though, Spooky is more metal than the spirit will ever be.
---
Glad I'm not the only one who screams like a 5yo girl at Myers! I think its universal.
---
I didn't realize flashlight clicking was toxic until someone told me. I just liked hearing the clicking sound
---
Lmao, they were still too bad to stop you
---
*gg*
---
Koreans are better than anyone else at pretty much every video game. I learned this watching SC2 and I've only seen the idea reinforced over time watching other games. 
---
I wish there were more english speaking streamers that could break down the Korean gameplay/logic like there are in other games.
---
23.
---
Myers is the only killer that legitimately scares the shit out of me. 
---
Ah damn, I thought it was for all healing not done to yourself, rip. Thanks for the tip, I run botany when I don’t run we’ll make it because face-camping is meta 
---
Same for me, but ALL day for 3 days and got 4m BP and unlocked every teachable from the free survivors.  I think I have 250 streamers.
---
I get what you're saying, but all you're doing is trying to make yourself feel better "getting back" at the killer. Acting like that isn't going to change their behavior or re-evaluate playing like a douchebag. If anything it's just going to make them behave like that more.. but you do you, boo.  I play both killer and survivors and there's just shitheads on both side, I try not to get salty and just say GGWP regardless of how the game turned out, or if anything just don't say anything and move on to the next game. I can't control or be responsible for others behavior how they play, only mine. 
---
Agreed I like your response!
---
Really often you can see who's going to be the next killer in the tips. I mean really tip about the pig and I was playing against her and that's just one example 
---
How do you have that special “camerawork” where it pans and isn’t locked on your character?
---
I think it's programmed to recognize whatever text formatting the comment chain OP used, and read from the wiki page for that phrase. 
---
In this case there is (obviously) no wiki page for "NOOOO...". so it ended up reading from the wiki homepage. The text it put under "Info:" is the current shrine perk table on the homepage.
---
That was me, it helps to start consciously trying to play less immersed. It'll suck for a while but then when you see improvement it's great. I'm still potato but can loop much better than a couple weeks ago. 
---
I could have sworn they said they fixed how players and totems spawn, but last night I literally spawned with a Hex Ruin at my feet. I then got tunneled by a very angry Myers, but still managed to escape.
---
He needs to be taller imo 
---
Weird... Has it been like this since level 1? 
---
They’re like cockroaches omg
---
This sub isn’t made for witch-hunting 
---
[deleted]
---
that would be the connection spike
---
Yeah, that's going to be a no from me dawg. 
---
Yeah, they will think I missed it, untill they pick me up again and I don't struggle again. I would also use decisive strike if I get hit by NOED because screw NOED
---
Fool, the only way to get out alive is to play the basement lottery.
---
Once you and the killer are in the basement, the lottery begins. If the chest has already been looted, you die. If you loot the chest and pull out anything but a flashlight, you die.
---
If you manage to loot a flashlight, your absolute safety is guaranteed until the end of the trial. This contract is binding and can only be revoked if you fail to leave for an extended period of time.
---
&gt;I don't know, I'm not getting paid to know and grow this game. As it stands now a lot of the new character stories are pretty duckin' lame, **it's not that hard to write an interesting backstory to make people like and want their DLC more.**
---
I have now come to realize that you truly dont know what youre talking about and are indeed talking out of your ass. "youre not getting paid to know this game" but you also think its "not that hard to write an interesting backstory." Okay. Anything i say to you will go over your head because your trapped in your own naive world of imagining how this game could be better when you really dont get anything about how it or the industry works. Have a good one bud. 
---
You mean when the totem is put next to a generator/on a hill 9 out of every 10 games, and broken instantly making you have 3 perks?
---
It’s unacceptable really. I’ve stopped playing since this.
---
Depends on which killer you're playing, because a 3 gen strat, with a totem near by, can drag a game out for seemingly forever, but not guarantee a win. You might end yo hitting someone, but then they'll just run away from the 3 gens, and you're stuck either chasing (and losing a lot of progress on the gens) or hanging back while they heal up.
---
Even with Doc, a 3 gen strat can be hard to win against a coordinated team.
---
fix ya flair, it's supposed to be personal
---
I only got two perks once since I prestiged.
---
Name: Shadowborn 
---
moderately 
---
considerably 
---
tremendously 
---
You have a keen vision in the darkness of the night.
---
Your Field Of View is moderately/considerably/tremendously wider than normal.
---
Field Of View gains do not stack.
---
"Shining in the darkest dark, his eyes pierce the night and sting your soul."
---
Unique to The Wraith until Level 40, at which point its Teachable version can then be learned and taught to the other Killers.
---
Find out more at: https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Shadowborn
---
It's spelled the way it is on purpose, my guy, for humor or something.
---
Can't play killer without BBQ. Killer is to farm. The rest is nice tho
---
oh okay, just wanted to make sure, friend. reminds me of an episode of the office lol
---
There was me and another survivor who hadn’t left yet while the last person was hooked. Thought my team mate would go look for the totem while I did the save. Ends up I get left for dead by both of them and they watch me die on the hook not moving from the exit the entire time. 
---
Alright cool, me 2!
---
What do you think of the Shadowborn perk? 
---
Neither was this post, I was just sharing something annoying
---
And this is why Myers is my favorite killer in the game. They got his ability to match him perfectly with the movies. You're just doing your own thing, minding your own business. Boom, Myers. Will he just look at me or will he stab me right away? 
---
Pallet breaker confirmed 
---
What do you mean? NOED is a great perk that should be used by every killer.
---
I only consider teabagging annoying if I've been getting pooped on all game. It's like... yeah, you won. Thanks for the insult to injury. I won't say anything post game, though, because I understand they are trying to get a reaction.
---
Now, I also find it extremely tilting when I'm not playing particularly well, and I'm not even able to pick up someone i downed because it's a SWF flashlight squad that is extremely hard to catch, and coordinate super well to heal their friend who is on the ground if I don't pick them up.
---
The latter, however, isn't toxic; it's just me getting outplayed and getting frustrated. I won't punish a survivor by face camping because I'm not playing well, but I also won't leave the hook area if 2 or 3 of his friends are buzzing around it.
---
All bets are off once the gates are open. I'm a survivor main, but I realize that's essentially end game and if I was unlucky enough to get caught, I fully expect to die. 
---
They should be consumed, I know I am not the founder of the idea, but it would be too much trouble if you actually kept them. You can't keep your narmal addons, so no reason to keep these
---
So is 5 Blink Nurse. The difference is that Nurse wiuldn't need any Add Ons to be viable.  I don't know what they tell uou but I don't have like 500 Frank's Mixtape stored up
---
Sloppy butcher is lagging many games with the constant blood squirting everywhere it needs to be temporarily removed from the game imo
---
So fucking relatable haha. Right down to the scream an all. 😂
---
Wonderful editing. 
---
I mean disconnecting during the loading screen isn’t a rage quit, we just don’t wanna play against an unfair offering so we just avoid the match altogether
---
That is why he is fun. And he makes Survivors be mad.
---
Actuaply I'm a Rank 2 Billy/Hag main.
---
No
---
I run into them a lot for some reason. The one and only time a fellow survivor ratted me out to the killer it was a Kate. :( 
---
[[Shadowborne]]
---
I totaly disagree, the perk is pretty unfair. Miss 1 totem and boom, free insta downs. At lrast with other exposed perks, special conditions have to be missed and the exposed effect is temporarily, but getting all totems in a game is not always easy  especially not when playing solo.
---
Yeah running around in a circle takes so little skill.  Especially with pallets/ DH /DS and Adrenalin.  
---
Not yo mention Insta Heals and SWF
---
It hurt me deeply... because I laughed at my own pain. ❤️
---
He makes survivors mad because he takes all skill and says: "Screw that. I'm just going to hit you with two unavoidable hits and then tunnel you to death and make it so the whole chase mechanic is ignored. I'm fun :)"
---
i only use ruin when it's combo'd with haunted grounds at this point tbh
---
When the meme ripping on you gets more upvotes than your idea lmao
---
Imagine complaining about Dead Hard and Adrenaline.  
---
And how many insta heals do you even encounter? Almost none.
---
It honestly works too often. You don’t even need to do the sandwich, perhaps do some laundry, clean a little, you know, something that you would rather not do and see if the amusement was worth it in the end
---
This looks like my first time facing a myers lmao
---
Rank 1 killer here and if thats true im honestly ashamed. 
---
I didn't say that, and besides you don't even get to see which offering the killer used if you quit during the loading screen.
---
You don’t start getting 2 per Bloodweb until you hit 25.
---
Oh man, that was really satisfying. I wonder if the Killer player went on her stream afterwards. Them complaining about Franklin’s was hilarious. I really hope that BHVR sees this video and decides to remove her from the fog streamer list. Fog streamers shouldn’t act like this at all.
---
I was joking. I absolutely hate the perk and think that a perk which guarantees a kill or two if the killer played like shit is an awful addition to the game.  
---
Just like Rancor which is a worse version of NOED
---
Maybe because killers use it as a crutch to get to Rank 1 and then stop using it once they get there?
---
I don't even run Ruin anymore at rank 7. No point in playing with 3 perks after 1 minute of action. I think hex perks are super overrated, specifically Ruin. If you're against survivors that are good enough to necessitate Ruin, it'll be cleansed within a minute. If Ruin is still up after 5 minutes, you probably aren't going to need it against those survivors anyway. 
---
No.
---
End of post 
---
Instaheals and dead hard aren't really to hard to deal with tbh, most survivors aren't very good very good at mechanical timing to begin with making it really easy to bait out their dead hard.
---
Im only a rank 1 killer cause I only play Legion, and its easy af to rank with him. I honestly belong somewhere around rank 5-10, cause I usually only snag 2 kills a game
---
I have come to realize you and the some others don’t really have anything to contribute except attacking people instead of discussing/properly refuting their ideas with rational though, is it perhaps naivette on your own part?
---
A chase against Legion though is literally unwinnable though. You can lose other killers, but the Legion can just exit the chase and stare at the ground using bloodhound until he gets to where you stopped to mend and down you. Works 100% of the time. 
---
On PS4, it's Myers. 3/5 killers are him. Oh, god. It's boring at this point. I am going to stop using him for a while. 
---
Just use a medkit
---
[[Shadowborn]]
---
thank you to all the killers that during the double bp event weren't so scummy &lt;3
---
Running around a pallet "Correctly" is the same as hugging the wall and throwing it down when the kill gets to close. Also legion is very jukeable when in their frenzy, they don't see scratch marks and can easily change directions without leaving a trail for the legion to follow.
---
Nurse doesnt play by the rules of the game, so not exactly fair to compare them.  It wont take to long to amass a bunch of mixtapes, if you could see what I have on some of my killers...on my huntress alone I have over 150 Iridescent heads and over 200 infantry belts just waiting to be unleashed but with all the changes they have made to the killers game in the past 6 months, they are super OP now and not needed. I like the challenge :D
---
Could add tiering to exhaustion. Exhaustion add-ons give tier-one exhaustion, which ticks down like a regular timer, then tier-two exhaustion which comes from utilizing survivor perks. 
---
i am not aware of a ptb, but i'm *actually* out of the loop
---
Thats not true.I used to get them from level 15 onwards.
---
Act like what? Not one person in this thread has pointed out the acts of bullying during the game. Using perks is NOT bullying.
---
Playing doctor with the skin that has electricity running along the weapon is a good way for that slideshow experience 
---
If it was the last game before double bloodpoints happened and all that were played were streamers, but other than that no
---
I don't mind his titles. I wish he didn't spoil the ending of the game though in his titles though.  When you upload 5-6 games everyday, you can't get creative everytime. You just go for normal titles that describe the game little bit. 
---
It is absolutely positively 100% true. You get 2 per web starting at 25. The only exceptions are milestone levels: 10, 15, and 20.
---
Well I’m calling it right now. Heard it here first.
---
Which is why I say get rid of the Deep Wounds aspect of his power and let him keep the vaulting...?
---
I like this idea as a buff to survivors, I would also like the swf and survivor lobby to become one and you’re able to invite people from one. Don’t know why they’re separate 
---
Whats wrong with the lf addons?
---
Is finding an immersed Claudette trying to blend into a corner an acceptable excuse to face camp?
---
Survivor
---
Killer
---
Killers have the potential to be so much more toxic. Spamming moris, face camping, tunneling, etc. are all so much more toxic than using an item the way it was intended to be used (pallet stunning, flashlight stunning. Etc.) All survivors can really do to be toxic is teabag, and I say this as a killer main with ample time on both sides.
---
It’s still unimaginative, either way. I like the idea of athleticism as a power but it would have to be more interesting than vaulting over shit. 
---
Ok I guess.Thanks.
---
Haha, damn. I couldn't get nearly that much BP. I'm not good enough tbh
---
I see your point.  
---
Still Legion without Mixtape takes 5 Hits to down someone
---
It only gives you those tips the first two or three times you face a killer btw - after that it's back to the generic tips.
---
Eh, yeah. If it was that one swamp map with the big house and a generator..nevermind. I'm bad at describing it. I only got 1 kill in my total of 2 insidious nurse games. I thought people liked jokes
---
That looks awesome!
---
Why did you put the title in quotation marks? 
---
Usually we know a little bit on what's coming before the ptb is released. Usually the changes are reviewed on a Thur during stream then the following week it is released. Or the week after. Point is I dont think mid chapter changes have been officially discussed on stream. 
---
I think the 1 vs 4 does it. Everything feels way more personal. Tbagging and face camping is directed to a single player. In Call of Duty you have teams, so it's harder there to shit on a single player. And this community is pretty toxic, most guys think they play better than everyone else.
---
&gt;Doesn't matter what single individuals define as a loss.
---
You are doing that right now, lmao.
---
A lot of killers mains specialize in 1, maybe 2 killers. If you recognize the name you'd have a really good idea of what killer you're about to face.
---
Hmmm. Yeah maybe. And with the holidays barely behind us it could be a little further out. 
---
Ruin is necessary in high ranks for everyone but Nurse, and NOED is op regardless of who you play. I consistently play at high ranks, dull totems never get cleansed before end game, and you don't even know it's active + survivors are busy with gates, AND she gets +3% movement speed. Stupidly OP.
---
Are you a troll or just that ignorant?
---
Wraith on PS4 = instant DC for me. Have yet to encounter a wraith who was not taking advantage of this sloppy bug since it’s appearance. It is very frustrating.
---
I play on PS4 and all I see is Billy’s and spirits.
---
I played killer with BBQ and used streamers.  Most of my games were 50-100k, but some were closer to 150k.
---
my favorite part is that shroud of separation never works. I've spawned next to 1-2-3 other people after a hidden offering and we all go "well shit.." and then in the post game lobby realize it was a shroud. They're literally just "I HAVE A HIDDEN OFFERING!" mindgame offerings, they don't actually do anything in my experience.
---
[Leave the sub again](/spoiler)  
---
This is great! The detail on your Hag is amazing, and I love the detail that she's standing in her own trap!
---
I would greatly appreciate that as well, the source link isn't working for me either. Not that it would necessarily help since I can't read Korean, but seeing the other maps would be very awesome!
---
I’m guessing the whole point though is to get killers to leave the hook as a camping deterrent, so there has to be a timer for that.
---
Poor guy might not ever kick again 
---
Yet with every other killer there is counterplay. Legion doesn’t have counterplay when it comes to winning chases and your idea wouldn’t change this. Unless the legion is complete trash and you manage to hide you will never escape them without them choosing to leave, no other killer has a guaranteed down every single chase. 
---
distortion was nice until I realized you couldn't regain tokens. Hiding in lockers when they don't have iron maiden is the better alternative. 
---
This is exactly why i dont run lithe lol
---
Spirit and Hag also have no reason to use Ruin, it takes a slot away from better perks.
---
On Nurse I have exactly 1 semi-offensive perk which is Knockout, everything else is tracking-related, Nurse has no use for gen-based perks, as she applies so much pressure (especially when tracking-focused) that Ruin will crawl into a fetal position and cry in the corner.
---
Not even just unimaginative, it wouldn’t change anything. Legion would still inevitably catch you, they just wouldn’t do it using deep wounds. 
---
It was probably an easy win, but this is still super annoying. 
---
Hag traps still get me sometimes.
---
yeah as long as it doesn't break as much as it tries to fix.
---
As a killer I've never hit a survivor through a window that isn't right in front of it.  Didnt casually throw it in, that's just facts.  Survivors dont get hit unless they're directly on the other side of the window in 100% of my games as killer.
---
A couple of them don't even work properly 
---
You ever play league of legends? in that game you can get told to kill yourself and other various slurs (racial and sexual) by 9 other people, your allies and your enemies, during the game.
---
I don't know why the hell I did, but I played lol for about 5 years of my life and regret every second of it. It sure gave me thick skin though. It isn't that the dbd community is wretched and scummy (which it is) it's just that video games bring this out in people. I suggest quitting the game for good, honestly. I only ever play with 3 friends anymore. it's not worth the stress and misery. 
---
Nope, I'm all game for unhooks when the gates are open, I have to try, unless NOED pops. It's every survivor for themselves.
---
Then use the blood points to get maps lmao
---
4 man fucking DS and adrenaline and they died during the end game Christ almighty and their dumbasses still have the audacity to complain XD
---
I don't use Ruin on anyone but LF (because I don't have any real perks on him) and do just fine in Rank 1 and I main Doctor, not Nurse or Billy.
---
And how is a perk which you can literally prevent from activating OP? Me and my friend never have NOED activate against anyone but a competent Nurse (who 99% of the time won't run it) because it takes about a minute for 2 people to get all totems if they know the spawns.
---
So at least DD. Got it! 
---
okay, you have my interest...
---
10 FPS and a typical PS4 killer. Sigh. This looks like gameplay of mine from yesterday. 
---
The only thing I can hope for is to get a pc at tax time. So fucking sick of all the bullshit on PS4. 
---
Was a joke don’t really get why everyone gets so offended by this
---
You got a point. Although, the suvivors I got were overreacting imo.
---
I recommend you watch ScottJund's(DamnNoHTML) video about Legion as it shows my point about "why play legion" very well.  
---
Maybe then you'll see why I think Legion is complete garbage.
---
Removed - Shaming other players
---
Yeah, after the gens are done theres really no reason to leave the hook, just secure the kill, survivors should accept this as a free escape or... Try to rescue, just dont complain if you get hooked too. 
---
Wait 20 mins for match
---
Killer dodges
---
I feel that. Should’ve seen it coming tho. Bet he didn’t let y’all farm points either 
---
maybe because noed is shit and only works on incompetent survivors 
---
If you are just trying to get a single kill out of an unsuccessful game, camping would be justified. Many survivor mains don’t get it because they don’t play killer. They just want to blame someone for their stupidity. Let them be, survivors will be survivors.
---
Not in my opinion, but its  not like I can stop you
---
Been that situation already. Had a standoff against a survivor at the hatch and the gate was behind him. 15 mins of me standing still waiting for the lil shit to jump. He realized I wasn’t dicking around and took the gate 😂
---
You don't have that many? What the hell did you spend all those 2x bloodpoints on? Viable killers? Stocking up on items for your survivors? Psht noobs.
---
That would never happen
---
Rank doesn’t do anything right? I don’t see the point of pips if there are no incentives. 
---
This is on pro. Sorry I didn't specify. That's why I'm so done with this shit
---
It's tempting but I hate DCing cuz it screws over the other survivors
---
Thank you for this. And if you get hooked in the end game it's also likely that it's because you and your team exhausted too many palletes. I get way too many games where survivors don't even loops me and always preemptively throw the pallete down. I'm a killer who always hovers around the red ranks and it's astonishing to me that no one even attempts to save God palletes. 
---
I live the survivors sliding. I actually dont want this fixed. I get a laugh whenever I see someone skateboarding around the map.
---
Because of her ability to easily counter loops. Plus; the Mint Rag, Rusty Shackle, Make Your Choice combo is *meeeeeeeean*
---
The pig usually scares me because I usually don’t see the puppets but I’ll hear her roar and basically shit my pants 
---
Just throw worthless fuming tape like add-on for everyone EZ.
---
PS4 pro 
---
Spirit also completely counters loops
---
No it isn't. If it doesn't work for you, that's a *you* problem.
---
Why do you care what survivors say to you? If you want to camp after the gates are open, do it.It's their stupidity for not leaving.Play the way you want to play.Survivors will always complain about something when they lose, regardless
---
I'm not even safe in this subreddit 
---
Fuck that generator in particular
---
I tried scratched mirror myers with monitor&amp;abuse for the first time last night and I felt so bad for the horror I inflicted on the 4 claudettes in my game, but that was seriously the most fun game I've ever played. 
---
What kind of gens you doing that take 15 mins?
---
Not completely, as phasing is all about prediction and guesswork.
---
Plus, Spirit doesn't have as much map pressure as Hag.
---
My favorite is after you get the hook the voice in your head starts to laugh maniacally as you turn around and watch the survivors scatter
---
Yeah, they'd of course be consumed as usual.
---
It mainly stems from SWF.
---
And the way that communication allows them to circumvent a lot of parts of the game 
---
I have to disagree. We shouldn’t force killers to play killers they don’t want to.
---
The sound is satisfying and I was this years old today when I learned that it was toxic :(( I don’t want to be toxic I swear
---
I would scream so loud
---
I can use her, and I do fairly well. I just find her to be quite "meh", is all.
---
She's not a bad Killer, just not as good as those above her.
---
Wow that’s insane man. My FPS has never been that bad on the Pro. But that hemorrhage bug with the Wraith probably has a lot to do with it. I’ve seen numerous complaints of it tanking FPS but only against Wraith. 
---
How dare you not let the swf group hook swarm, heal, cleanse remaining totems and then escape?  Didn't you get the memo? We're allowed one hook afterwards we must go stand in a corner for the remainder of the match. Least that's the impression that I get.
---
Wow, you sniped his ass
---
Also, no one is asking for BHVR to live tweet when and what they're working on bugs. They haven't said a single word about it. That's the thing. Just two words from one of their community managers, and I think we would be fine. The programming team would be fixing bugs. The programmers also write code for new characters. They work closely with artists, producers, designers and whoever to help create the new characters. I'm saying that they should focus their efforts, and not just bugs because there are balance issues, matchmaking issues, etc., on making the game that they have right now playable. 
---
I don't understand this complacency on this studio that has yet to show us any progress towards fixing the game. They haven't said anything. Obviously, it would take a while, but even still they haven't done anything. How is it unfair to "yell" at bhvr to fix their own game? It would certainly not help anyone if all the players were silent.
---
Could easily just make a new code for these crows though. Make them completely different from the other crows, and it would still work.
---
Yeah this wouldnt change much. With bloodhound you can still chase them over 16m because of how long/bright blood stays on the ground. It should be inside his terror radius.
---
And yet, this wouldnt change anything. This would just make the chases longer but it wont add any skill depth to it. It would still be painfully boring to survivors but now with extra 40 seconds. 
---
Amazon prime 
---
I understand the killer at this point. 1 gen left and you’re on your last hook? Bit of a dilemma. Claudette is still a POS
---
It's such a big deal for Huntress though. Countless times on multiple different streams, I've seen people think they're safe behind a truck or something being healed and they get got
---
&gt; Muh Bloodpoints
---
I mean all things considered you're not really going to be milking extra bloodpoints with "Killer blind" points, most times in that situation you'll be maxing out that category from chases and pallet stuns.
---
Besides nobody calls milking bloodpoints toxic, it's when survivors do it to add insult to injury. Killer is in a chase, gets pallet stunned, then has to break the pallet or get looped around it. Sure the flashlight can be useful in that situation but honestly it's more annoying for the killer than anything else and you can just spend that time running away.
---
&gt; muh definitions
---
It's listed there under "very unpleasant"
---
eh they would get noed at that point
---
Yeah rank 1 survivors definitely play like shit on purpose a lot of the time lol. I watch some of these killer streamers get such easy 4ks like damn, these rank 1s are playing worse than rank 15 but they KNOW they're doing it lol
---
If were going to argue semantics about that here then technically the killer being on the map in general is toxic since I as a survivor can't fight back and they're trying to kill me which is harmful to my characters health. 
---
But without the killer there is no game so I'm not against it. Therefore, just because someone doesn't like something doesnt make that thing in particular "toxic." See what I'm saying? Toxic has become some sory of buzzword because instead of them manning up and saying they dont like something, because it'll make them look like a cry baby, they use the word "toxic" so a bunch of cry babies can agree with them. Weird how ome word changes everything.
---
This was literally just posted.
---
Holy crap I you can blind that far away?
---
Honestly, while some of the balance changes over the last 8 months have made killer bullying less common (or less viable) it is when I started running into groups like this which kind of ruined the mood of the game for me while I was still learning how to play.
---
I loved being in the shit ranks, because matches lasted a while, avoiding the killer was scary as hell, and chases were intense and nerve wracking.
---
Eventually it just turned into survivors clowning the majority of the cast, gens being popped every minute, and just an overall very stressful experience as a killer.
---
Even now, it isn't uncommon for me to play survivor and pop 3 to 4 gens before a Rank 1 killer can get a single hook, though instances of just running them in circles forever is less common.
---
Yeah I know, sorry forgot to add “flair” and I’m a little slow so I just reposted 
---
Sloppy Butcher with Windstorm, even on PC, can really lag the game.
---
Yup, I got scared by Myers too. [confirm](https://clips.twitch.tv/DreamyAthleticSharkImGlitch). &gt;.&lt;
---
How do you grab them? Sometimes I do the attack move when they arw working on the gen but it hits them? Am I missing something
---
Slugging could sometimes be the right play, not even counting ds into it. If you're that mad about getting slugged, run unbreakable.
---
Sometimes I'll switch up the routine by leaving them on the ground if I know someone else is nearby, but I'll always pick em up after I'm done with everything else
---
It also has to be boosting with SWF in some of these cases. One thing that helped me rank up fast, against a SWF, is to pick out the weak link and murder them super fast. This might cause me to lose 2 or 3 gens, but dealing with 3 survivors is infinitely easier than dealing with 4, especially if you control where the last 3 or 4 gens will be.
---
existence is toxic 
---
...implying it isn't already.
---
I didn't expect it to work at all lmao
---
Why not? What's wrong with it?
---
connection is fine, my internet works (and i assume the killer's internet works too)
---
its the game that doesnt work ;(
---
Come on that clip was funny as hell. 
---
Cows with another post! I like it!
---
it just wastes time. why not just take the ds and move on, instead of letting ds users win by letting them get picked up? especially when you complain about ds.
---
Lol, I'm watching Infinity War right now
---
***\*AHH'ING INTENSIFIES\**** 
---
I've never seen this on PC so what are those question mark boxes?
---
You shouldn't assume they're always getting picked up, sometimes the slugging pays off. It's definitely high risk, but also high reward. 
---
Had to use freestyle to sharpen up the game. Its so damn blurry on Ultra settings and they only have the presets!
---
Kick was blocked at the line 
---
It was funny, but back before a lot of the balance changes, that doc would have 100% dropped that survivor, and probably never have gotten a hook all game.
---
My only point was that this game is at it's best when survivors fear the killer. For a long time, there was no reason to fear anyone but a good Nurse or Billy.
---
I played against him once and he accused me of stream sniping because I found his traps at shack and "brought in a key" to avoid NOED and Blood Warden. I came in without an item and had no idea who the killer was lol
---
Console.
---
i’d rather get rid of the ds and knock them down again instead of sluggin, lettin them get picked up and having them escape. just me tho
---
When it gets a bit too quiet for awhile I always assume it’s Myers lol
---
Ha that’s a lie. Gens don’t take 2 minutes
---
"OH NO! A MILD INCONVENIENCE!"  
---
I've noticed the same of people who play intentionally troll-y and/or have names meant to imply that they're really good at outplaying the killer. 
---
I'm red-green (protan) colorblind, so maps like any of the Coldwind Farm maps, or Haddonfield, were practically free wins for survivors.
---
Survive with Friends
---
&gt;if you've been losing rank a bit. 
---
Not true. It happens until you get any survivor to level 10
---
Ooooo damn I’m sorry man!
---
I hate SWF players like anyone else, but as far as skill goes these players destroyed the killer. It was their creed that cost them the match in end. This could have easily been a 3 escape match if not for that. 
---
Personally I prefer videos where the killer is actually good and destroys SWF. Here, they played themselves.  
---
Didn't he score more than his entire offense?
---
Focus
---
that’s where you’re wrong, kiddo!
---
Let me know what we could improve on
---
No tips gameplaywise, because every killer can be boiled down to m1 + gimmick, at least for me (except huntress, I like having a ranged attack), but have a tip that will help you in the long run. Try to recognise the maps, learn the patterns in which they form, learn totem spots, or just look around, use the surroundings to your advantage, and have fun doing it. The last thing you want to be is another pinch of salt in the dead sea 
---
People can’t stand to lose. A pip is a win for a survivor in my book. Escaping is just icing on the cake.
---
I had someone do this for me last night, people like you keep this game enjoyable
---
i run it when i see a flashlight crutch sweat squad
---
Umm, no it doesn't. It's a lot faster than chasing them for another 2 minutes
---
Apparantly its minutes not seconds 
---
Just sucks cuz everyone else escaped so he still didn’t even pip lol
---
Close the app then open it again should fix the bug
---
DS should have bonus bloodpoints associated with it, and let you use it three times a game.  
---
It's all good. Because of the overlay, I'm now back to slaughtering people. I just wish BHVR made this an ingame feature, like most online games do, rather than require me to use a 3rd party program that sometimes doesn't work, depending on patches.
---
What is the boat generator?
---
Buy leatherface so that you can get bbq and chili!
---
Most killer perks are bad I think. Very situational or completey useless. Bbq and chili shouldn’t have like a half dozen different counters. Totems shouldn’t be so easily destroyed. Killers don’t have anything that can destroy a survivors perks. 
---
Inconsistency is what keeps the game somewhat fresh in my opinion. Insert Forest Gump reference about chocolates.
---
I went up about 8 seconds the past two weeks
---
Every single character bio is complete trash, they're all written like 16 year old girl fanfic. 
---
In the words of our greatest president ever
---
Wrong
---
It’s really not. There are so many counters to it. Hell now u can just dip into a locker for a few seconds and the killer can’t see your aura
---
This is so sad. Can we get a good Freddy rework? 
---
It won't show the killers name if he has set his status to offline though. Seems to happen a lot. Also, your status needs to be set to online as well. 
---
Not if i have knockout ;)
---
You mean joining the dark side. 
---
Try again
---
Or have Iron Will
---
Yeah. Not playing on console ;)
---
I wheezed so hard laughing to this video I gave myself a headspin! 
---
Great edit! 
---
No they dont because its not worth a perk slot
---
To be honest, I do get frustrated if I get pooped on all match as killer, like if I'm Myers on Coldwind Farm, the survivors are super coordinated, and I simply cannot find anyone until it's pretty clear I'm going to lose badly.
---
As survivor, I honestly never care if I win or lose, UNLESS it's my teammates sandbagging me, or the killer face camps me for no reason.
---
Nope that’s pretty normal and stupid in my opinion. A coordinated swf team can end a game way way to fast. It’s no surprise we see so many complaints of camping when the killer only has enough time to find one guy before the match is over
---
step 1. buy leatherboi 
---
Step 2. camp everyone you hook
---
Step 3. down and kill all the dumbass survivors that try to unhook anyway
---
step 4. success
---
but when i play any other online game i can connect fine
---
whats so special about dbd apart from the fact that it doesnt work?
---
pls idk computers help
---
Calls support...
---
"My game is broken.  I'm literally shaking right now"
---
"Sorry to hear your upset, now what's the issue"
---
level 1 cook: looting chest
---
level 100 mafia boss: pharmacy user
---
To be fair it is related
---
What map?
---
Almost nothing would change. The reason Legion is so BS is because he can down you with his Frenzy
---
Agreed. I don’t mind the face camping at rank 1. I just accept the death and buy time for my teammates. Gens get done, everyone else escapes, killer gets entity displeased lol
---
Omg how did you do It? I've had it for weeks now!
---
That didn’t work, but reinstalling it did

---
Flashlight spamming is rapidly flashing the flashlight on and off to make a “clicking” sound. It’s not the flashlight that’s toxic, it’s the player using the flashlight that can be toxic.
---
Which ones in particular?   
---
Single digit ranks is definitely where the wall is for survivors, imo. Killers are now more capable of handling mind games and have their own tricks, so you have to mind game their mind games and do weird shit that would probably just get you killed at low ranks. 
---
PC
---
In lobby
---
When I try to join a game as survivor, I get stuck in an infinite loading screen, when I try to join form a SWF lobby, I get dc'd from the host. Killer lobby will DC me after a few minutes.
---
To reproduce, literally just try finding a game.
---
You are a madman
---
One day on a bus ride back home, Claudette got lost in the woods. 10/10
---
recent pip and score changes specifically punish camping hooks, but that seems like it's one of the main advantages to Insidious.
---
I've also used it successfully in the basement house on the Myers map with two staircases up, or in the asylum map to stand upstairs and watch the central hook (because people don't look up ever).
---
It's great for finding that last survivor or baiting them to the right place.
---
One of the highest selling games on steam,  with a constantly updated cosmetics shop, and a new paid expansion every three months.

I'm sure they could afford to push one back for a month to actually make their product functional.

Just because i got so many upvotes i decided to upload it to my youtube even tho it's short :) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMeT\_VknsoA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMeT_VknsoA)
---
I think you're heavily underestimating just how many new players quit because they find the game confusing and frustrating.
---
Depends. Half the time you don’t have to do anything as long as you position yourself behind the gen so the killer can’t barely see you are on it anyway. But if he is an alert killer I’ll gladly make him think I’m heading west just to sprint back to the gen after 4 seconds. With as fast as a gen finishes losing 4 seconds isn’t that bad. Hell losing ten isn’t that bad
---
I played a match as killer where there was always a survivor (or two) sabotaging hooks in the vicinity of my chases. So many struggle escapes.
---
That said it was such a unique style of play that I wasn't even mad. It was a welcome change of pace IMO.
---
You know hooks respawn, right? Also, this is kind of suggesting people should go be toxic to killers.
---
I think it's best to. You can use good addons and offerings, boost your BP generation without emptying the locker of your preferred killer.
---
Plus if you can do good as leatherface you can do good as most other killers.
---
What hes saying is that theres no counterplay
---
It’s kind of nuts how bad they’re handling everything lately
---
yeah just gonna drop this stolen ass meme here btw hope ur man gets cancer
---
you need to heal with a buddy. the daily is bugged, only seconds of co-op you get are from healing with someone. 
---
Hooks take like what 2 minutes to respawn? Youre dropping hooks every 10-20 seconds?
---
With 15 charges I drop 9-10 hooks/game, but heres the catch the killer cant hook you, in his frustration to catch you, go after the hook "bangs" he loses 3 generators being done.
---
IF your survivors are total dodos and spend their entire game just crouching then yeah youre fucked but besides that it works very well. 
---
I still don’t get how the idea of a killer whose power only makes it so he can’t hit you for 8 seconds was ever pushed
---
Yeah but it's not really worth it and most survivors don't bother. 
---
Autohaven. I want to see Wretched Shop?
---
Hangman's Trick exists. Rip sabo squad.
---
Glad you took it in a positive way. The fun of survivor(maybe killer too, IDK ) has been sucked out so much that the game has definitely got a lot more repetitive and boring. I dont think just adding new maps, which the devs are trying to do, adds a whole lot of fun in the game.
---
Just cosmetics
---
You sound like a self entitled crybaby, killer having a virtual map? And everything is nerfed against your favor? Grow up. You are the kind of survivor teammate that'll promote slugging and not being beneficial to the rest of the team by actually playing the objective and working on gens. Despise your kind as a survivor because objectives are progressing slowly giving the killer a better chance to win and love you guys as a killer because sabos are definitely not viable option when trying to win as a survivor, maybe against newer players but any experienced player doesn't fall for it anymore.
---
Which is a testament to how weak the killer is that their location is revealed and they give zero shits
---
r/expectedthanos
---
That’s how Mafia works.
---
if you find a killer running that perk these days lmk. right now i havent seen it in probably 50 games ive played over the month of december 
---
And you’re a dumb n-word Loooool
---
No because they would just get in a locker. That's the point. 
---
Covered this in my other reply.
---
What if the crows in the game when disturbed would follow you and reveal your location or do a failed skill check ping, kind of like a stronger version of the spies in the shadows perk or whatever it’s called. And make a bunch more crows. Would kind of be like Doctors shock. Maybe you collect crows and they “attack you” and slow you down. 
---
that perk is worse than surveilance
---
I don't understand. You reward the player who snitches on another?
---
I was in a similar situation. Two people were in the basement, I hid in a locker intending to unhook the other two once the killer left, and the guy who got downed first ratted me out, so the killer ended up with a 3k rather than 0 kills. 
---
Can someone please inform me why survivors do this? This is a **TEAM GAME**.
---
There are ways of being toxic that don’t involve snitching to the killer, you realise? 
---
If slugging is such a big deal, run unbreakable. Slugging is one of the only legitimate counter strategies to DS since a killer has no way of preventing it going off once they pick you up. better to have one survivor out of commission while you go chase a second than have no guys out of commision and continue chasing the guy you already caught unnecessarily.
---
How did you make that cinematic part? 
---
Where
---
Believe me or not, this was recorded at Rank 1 \^\^
---
Is on console. Ruin is great among us peasants. Mostly because BHVR won't give us the optimization they have been promising for years.

ohsht

I meant that theres way more than a 4:1 ratio. Like on ps4 is probably double that aka 8:1

wait only the first chest will be a medkit

the rest will be everything else at 80% faster rate like a mafia boss

&gt;a perk for killers that are so afraid of flashlights that they'd rather annoy their survivors
---
So if I saw 2-4 flashlights in my lobby, I'm not allowed to use Franklin's because it's annoying *for them*. Let's just ignore if dealing with those flashlights is annoying for the killer. 
---
Is Lightborn the same? You're effectively neutering flashlights unless they get it nearly perfect.
---
I'm just trying to understand where you're coming from when one of the main concepts of the game ,killers adjusting their perks to react to what they see in the lobby, is considered try-hard. 
---
This sub is obsessed with Jen
---
I had a nurse blink down to the basement while I was searching through the chest. Surprisingly she let me go, but all I got out of the chest was a green key :(. 
---
Nurse: You have no terror radius. Your teleport distance and charge speed is increased considerably, and no longer makes any noise. You may not attack immediately after teleport, but your fatigue time is reduced by 50%.
---
Billy: (Since someone already mentioned plowing through pallets) Holding down the action button allows you to automatically vault while chainsaw sprinting. Immediately after the vault, your speed is reduced to 100% and your turn speed is increased immensely for 0.5 seconds. This does not interrupt your sprint.
---
Huntress - Hatchets that hit pallets break them. After the first pallet, the hatchet continues traveling normally. After hitting a second pallet, the hatchet stops as normal.
---
Leatherface - The first time you collide with an object and would begin a tantrum, your move speed is not lowered. Instead, your acceleration increases moderately and the number of chainsaw swings you make is reset. The second time you collide with an object, you throw a tantrum as normal.

Doctor - While in madness level 2, survivors will suffer Surreal Hallucinations at random. Moving hallucinations of the Doctor will spawn out of LOS from the survivor and move towards the survivor. These hallucinatory doctors have a terror radius equal to your own. At madness level 3, the hallucinations are more frequent. Surreal hallucinations may not spawn for a single survivor more than once every 30 seconds at tier 2, and once every 20 seconds at tier 3
---
While at madness level 2 or 3, a survivor will lose the ability to hear the Doctor's heartbeat at random for 3 seconds. This may not occur more than once for a single survivor every 30 seconds at tier 2, and every 20 seconds at tier 3.

Only when i hear bae humming
---
Omg OP is cows? I used to watch him all the time but he just suddenly died for a longass time and now he's back? You damn animal..... Love ya.
---
Honestly I thought he already had 2 by default wtf?? Having 1 by default sound painfully awful
---
SWF wait times are always longer. But there's also something borked in matchmaking right now.
---
Okay
---
You might say that she’s particularly distressing?
---
Survivors that constantly click their flashlights while you chase them are 100% the most toxic teabaggers I have ever witnessed 
---
Ya the ranked system in this game is pretty garbo. The fact that you can go against a bad killer who cant catch someone, do 5 gens across 4 survs, and leave without enough points for a safety pip is stupid. There are games where is you play for rank you basically have to let the killer get you to get anywhere
---
It's also pretty pointless since matchmaking is full of mixed groups and you dont actually get anything for your rank. They could probably take the ranked system out of the game tomorrow and no one would notice. 
---
It feels more precarious but honestly, it’s closer to the only escape route. 
---
I feel like we might be going in circles here. If you feel like Franklin's is such a shitty perk, and you have valid arguments for that opinion, then it can't be 'try-hard'. In fact it would be anti-'try-hard' since in your eyes you're actively hindering your chances of winning if you run it. 
---
Granted, 'try-hard' is one of those nebulous insults around here that seems to wildly vary from "rocking full ultra-rare addons + Ebony Mori / Thick mist" to "Someone who doesn't meme around and treat DbD like a party game". So I don't know, maybe it's just crossed communication here.
---
So...you want as many points as someone 1v4-ing while you are working with 3 other people against one person who can't even hear footsteps? Is that correct?
---
Ah
---
It's like the devs don't undestand their own game, totally agree with you as another killer main.
---
You sound upset. Maybe ill get you in one of our games, will you rage quit just like reading two paragraphs is too hard for you?
---
Hard when that’s not an option on the PS4 but I guess if one gets so heated to Friend Request me just to tell me off I’ll explain then.
---
I lose.
---
Omg that is longer than i've been getting. For me it was like 5 to 10 minutes
---
Made a Nea DC because she missed her DS. (She also dropped a purple flashlight because of Franklin's Demise)
---
But there is a difference between something like Prayer Beads and Franks Mix Tape levels of power versus Black Box or Tampered Timer/Amanda’s Letter. 
---
fix the fucking framework of your game first!
---
Oh okay, well that explaines a whole lot, thanks for that. But it seems like the devs don't care at all.
---
Look, you are real sweet thinking about Killers...
---
But Killers already have enough to do in games.
---
They certainly don't play it at Rank 1, that much is for sure.  
---
flair perk of choice checks out
---
This is so adorable, you’ve done such a great job! :D
---
Are you implying Self Yeet is annoying? The dude can’t even heal, just go bop him again. 
---
Is the link working for any body? Im trying to load it but it just.... makes no progress
---
That's great. I responded to that in my other reply indirectly to your reply. Can't wait for your response.
---
Atleast you're not freddy
---
Do it 
---
Might as well take every streamer off the list then if you want to think like this. Most if not all streamers have toxic attitudes and feelings towards the other side.
---
I can win chases, but I like doing other shit to make it fun which usually ends up in me losing the chase lol
---
Wait did he just say "this is my favorite map"?
---
literally had a game against wraith with sloppy yesterday. Also had the damn infinite splurting blood glitch. Nearly dced for the first time bc of how fucking bad it was (if it didnt crash my game first)
---
Right, but in my situation, I did absolutely nothing wrong that match. Did gens, didn't tbag, be useless, bratty, etc- there was no reason to snitch on me. Yet he did.
---
There is absolutely no reason to snitch on someone who is simply playing the game normally. You are both impeding your and the other survivors' ability to win.
---
You seriously shouldn't assume that his partner is automatically deserving of that just because someone else snitched on him. Chances are the other guy is more deserving of it. What if he was innocent? Don't take silly chances like that.
---
Especially, you gave him the hatch in your initial reply. You go so far as to not only let the cheater go, but also give him the hatch? At least kill both of them, dude!
---
Rant over. It hits a serious spot in me when it comes to betrayal like that.
---
Lies! Check his pockets for pebbles!!!
---
Yeah it's a great information perk but the tier 1 does seem better because you know sooner whether they split from the gen but I think the seconds interval is increased so it doesn't spam the notification considering how annoying that would be so in that sense tier 3 would be better. Idk it's a food information perk but I feel it could have been designed a bit better
---
EDIT: As a survivor, whatever, do whatever you want. It's still not justified, but can you not do it to innocent people? It's a harm to everybody if you snitch on someone like that, even if he does deserve it. Just let the game be.
---
Would you prefer that I copy paste my reply multiple times in the same thread?

Facecampers are the reason I bring Borrowed Time

---
...Yeah? Everyone is in the game for the same amount of time. I don't see why killers "deserve" more bloodpoints than survivors. It just makes it so that during bp events everyone plays killer and nobody wants to play survivor.
---
#NOW TRY OUR NEW FLEX HOOK 
---
Nah you go ahead and grab that item... *laughs in demise*
---
I guess what I've been trying to say is that trying to counter other players items by changing your build proves a lack of confidence in your own playstyle and is kinda Try-hard-ish.
---
Edit: I just noticed that the killer in the video had Franklin's equipped before the game. Still a bad choice imo, but not necessarily due to a try-hard mentality.
---
r/unexpectedmario
---
You should of run Open Handed with Plunders and Ace in the hole. You can see chests farther away!!!
---
surprisingly its hard
---
But they changed the range! You can use both on level 3 (72m both)
---
I used to play Feng Min. I've been thinking about giving every Feng Min the hatch (unless they're Toxic AF) 
---
Devs confirmed to be even more stupid than we thought 
---
I believe you can do it
---
Killer population seems to have taken a nosedive. I'm at rank 2 and usually takes forever but I'm constantly being matched near instantly. That said, as a killer main I get tired of constant SWF toxic groups so I will sometimes leave lobby if its obvious (3x flashlight claud's etc)
---
Both? You have better eyes than me then : ) 
---
Wow another glitch, never seen one in this game ever :o
---
I have no clue where lmao, is she behind the green staircase? 
---
I heard that it still notifies him. Can't confirm but all my friends are telling me it does even though I thought it didn't.
---
You’re currently cold 
---
Ruin doesn't help that much at red ranks unless you camp over the totem anyways. I'm lucky if I get one hook before ruin breaks and having it last all match is exceedingly rare. Sometimes its gone in the first 20-30 seconds. One of the things that has helped me is learning when to break a chase. There is no point in letting one survivor loop your brains off for half the match, just try and get one good hit in and move on if they keep evading you. It's pretty rare that all the survivors are stellar runners in my experience, so catch who you can and circle back to catch the ones that unhook them later.
---
r/suicidebywords
---
Honestly one of my favourite perks on both sides as it prolongs my favourite part of the game (on both sides); chases. I don't think it's as strong as most people claim as it's a one-time use. It only gets op if the survivor is too strong or the killer too weak in chases.
---
It's part of the game bud can't do anything about it, it's difficult at times but it is fair. No point in complaining, I actually like playing against swf as it is a bit more of a challenge and you can really destroy them if they are super altruistic. You can either have all of them in basement or the game over with in the matter of a few minutes depending or not if you find that first player down quickly. Play off their altruism. The pig thing though can be a pain in the ass, part of the reason I don't ever play as her lol.
---
I always try to run it. 
---
Essentially you level up twice as fast, not always of course. Definitely would recommend new players getting King to 30 and switching to Claudette. WGLF is awesome imo. 
---
See, this is the thing. People aren't posting every encounter. you have 1 in 20 people posting every 10th encounter that actually stood out to them. You know why it seems like an endless torrent of people posting about toxic behaviour? Because there is an endless torrent of toxic behaviour.
---
And once again - securing your kill is not wrong nor illegal. If killer camps you, you most likely deserve it. Don't cry about it, survivors have this game easy enough already.
---
The meta now is annoying and overpowered add-on killers like legion spirit, wraith and nurse
---
Most are pretty bad, just because they get destroyed so easily. I think Ruin can be quite good barring an atrocious spawn (which will happen occasionally, but usually not). As long as you can get a hook before a gen is done, Ruin has usually given you enough momentum to pay for itself.
---
NOED can also be quite powerful, as it requires the survivors to cleanse all dull totems prior to activating the last generator, and that's BEFORE knowing you're using the perk. That alone wastes a little time (although likely not enough to justify the slot). When it does proc, survivors are rarely in a position to cleanse it immediately, and it can swing a losing game in your favor when utilized properly. That said, I don't like using a perk slot on something that won't be used until the endgame.
---
Haunted ground is good, but usually not good enough to justify two slots devoted to hexes.
---
As a killer main, this game easily has the most toxic community I have seen. The number of people that take the time to message me just to say something shitty after the match (PS4) is crazy! Even if you turn off messages you still have to deal with survivors waiting at the gate and teabagging incessantly and holding the game hostage until you come look at them leave. Just leave the damn gate so we can all move on!
---
NGL, but that was a horrible play at your part to not use the wall to your advantage, more importantly, that was a really dedicated team of survivors, if that person had DS, you would not have been able to dribble them, so be thankful for that. 
---
I'm glad to see survivors playing this game to the best of their abilities, without abusing some of the cheaper, broken strategies, DBD feels very inconsistent to the idea of having a game where things feel JUST right in being challenging, you're either getting destroyed or taking down survivors like a lawnmower, so when I get games where I bust my ass really hard to take down the survivors, and win, or hell, they get the win by fair and square play, and a few good mindgames, it really does make me feel fulfilled.
---
I feel like a perk that would deny the survivor the hatch would be too much. Yes, it’s a survivor sided mechanic and it allows them to easily deny you a 4K, but that’s not always the case. Slugging the third survivor to get the fourth is a good method, or just hoping you find the survivor before they find the hatch. As a survivor, the hatch is my last hope and to have it snatched away easily would leave me vulnerable when trying to do gens. I don’t think the hatch should be heavily nerfed because of a perk or nerfed heavily in general, just a perk that makes it harder to get the hatch, but not too hard. This perk specifically counters hatch camping when a survivor stays there and aims to go through it as the third survivor dies. It’s niche, but like Bloodwarden, it would be very useful when it does trigger and you are able to make use of it. 
---
Sad that these survivors are in their 30’s and still act like this in games. It’s a reflection of who they are in real life.  You only have to watch their streams for a little while to realize they are unhappy people. 
---
I don't agree with the OP but I do agree with it if you have deliverance equipped, would be a nice buff to it. If everyone's dead it gives you a prompt to escape the hook just before the death if you didn't use it earlier in the trial.
---
This happened to me(PS4) last time I played nurse as well... also couldn’t see my hand when teleporting. Made things very difficult as I couldn’t judge how far I would travel
---
Well, technically there's also Legion...
---
But we don't talk about Legion.
---
Here's my build. First two I always keep on me at all times - Hex Ruin (to prolong the game and give me time to build up to EW3 before gens start going down) and Monitor/Abuse (to be more stealthy and sneak up on survivors - this works so amazing on smaller maps). Second two I swap from time to time. BB and Chilli OR Tinkerer (so I know where they are but Tinkerer works better since they are focused on the last 15% of the gen and I have M/A to decrease my terror radius and sneak up on them), and Play with your food (for the movement increase).   
---
On larger maps, not gonna lie, Myers suck. I hate playing Coldwind Farms, but smaller maps with a lot of turns, it's a beatdown. 
---
Good killers won’t slug a DS user unless they know there’s some benefit; such as getting another player downed instead or if you can finish off the game. 
---
Don't @ me like that 
---
Many times over. Nothing triggers me like show off survivors...
---
This is why you face walls whenever you pick up a survivor 
---
Wow I guess me and you were there 
---
I’m assuming sweaty means coordinated team? I like to play with friends, so am I sweaty?
---
If they spawn in a bad located sure. Otherwise no.
---
/end thread 
---
I think I reached rank 4 as my max killer before the reset. I too prefer staying in the greens ranks 8-13 or whatever it is. Game is more fun that way. Once you start reaching 6s and below, it's too much lol. But to be fair, if you are playing as survivor, ranks 15-20 you'll be playing with idiots who only care about themselves.  The ranks in the middle are balanced for both. 
---
It's a twitch meme, and It used in the end of ironic messages :) Basically
---
You should draw meg next I’d love to see it :)
---
I thought Kate and Clown were the only one
---
Wow. Ok thanks. I thought that might be it but I wasn't sure.
---
Ye I'll continue for a while atleast. I will be posting them on my second channel if u wanna keep track! [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLTKBkZvnscYPDGqpAnbvzw/videos?view\_as=subscriber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLTKBkZvnscYPDGqpAnbvzw/videos?view_as=subscriber)
---
sure ! i’ll try c:
---
I just bought legion and he is probably one of the funnest killers I’ve played in a while. I understand the hate he gets but his ability can make chases quite interesting 
---
Rare empathy for me is better but it can depend on what you want to do in that game. 
---
I feel you man I’m right there with you
---
I was rank 18 when I got back from a long break 2 days ago and now I’m rank 11 killer and I feel like I’m always failing to meet potential, I think for me personally I need to play other killers to get better perks and learn them to learn more mind games 
---
I uploaded something like this but as huntress lol was two of them at the gates that wouldn't leave and I got the Laurie
---
I personally run Bond on all my survivors. Despite the shorter range, the map info it provides is invaluable, particularly in reading where the killer is, when it’s safe to take on a gen, when not to rush in for a save, etc. 
---
However, if your playstyle is particularly altruistic (maybe you head in for a save before a person is about to get downed), Empathy is the way to go. Empathy is a real necessity if you’re a flashlight hero.
---
I think that's just the light lol
---
You do realize you have the 3 unique perks of the survivor/killer you chose from the beginning, right? They are level 1,but better than nothing.
---
Also there's a skill check simulator on the internet where you can practice them.
---
You were a small group, why not introduce them in kyf so they can learn before jumping straight into madness?

---
1) No one new knows anythin about skill check simulator
---
2) You only get one perk per every 5 levels of survivor????
---
I dont have those perks, only insidious. Is that a good one? Xd
---
How do you manage to keep tier 3 unlimited? I dont have that add on either. But dont add on get deleted after every game? So you need a lot.of those add.ons then
---
It looked like me last night with dadddddyyyyy
---
I Don't Know what You all think but when i look for games with friends it usually takes a few attempts to actually find someone to stay 
---
No, i was looking at her cosmetics in the shop and went to rotate her and noticed the ahem, physics
---
No, see, that would require them to give a shit about fixing the game. 
---
Oh ok. Cool. My team and I try and play fair with out body blocks. 
---
i personally like empathy’s infinite range even though it is conditional, although i can easily see why people prefer having bond considering that it’s constant 
---
*when you sneak down to the basement then all of a sudden scream at the top of your lungs*
---
I actually do this
---
Low bloodpoints most of the time but eh :P
---
So if it doesn't affect you, then DS is fine to be OP as it is right now?
---
1) now you know and can tell them :D
---
2) the teachable perks you have the moment you select a survivor/killer the first time. So you have 3 perks right at the start and get the rest as you level up. To unlock these teachable to all characters, you know the drill: either get them from the shrine or level up each char to level 45.
---
The thing with the 3 perks in the beginning they changed. Idk what update brought that. 
---
I consider it camp when the killer leaves little to no chance of rescue, with no attempt of chasing another survivor. Now, the “end game” situation where the gates are open and there’s someone on the hook, I get it. But the dumb part that I see a lot is playing defense in the beginning and middle of the match. I think killers see there’s 2-3 gens left and start shelling up because they think they’ve already lost or something. I don’t mind getting wrecked by a killer if they’re being dominate but seeing them getting kills with the laziest “tactics” makes me salty af. It’s like when a survivor pallets stuns me once and thinks they’re OchiDO lol 
---
Turns out I had to configure/reset my IP address
---
I think the hag is a good one. Hex perks in general change up the game enough to keep things interesting on other killers even if you aren't into her gameplay of trapping and teleporting around the map. Hex: Ruin is a staple of most builds for a reason, and Devour Hope is my personal favourite perk in the game.
---
Clown is not a bad killer, he is kind of just a consistent, laid back killer. He doesn't really do any big plays, he just chases people down and his hard to get away from. His perks are pretty mediocre, I wouldn't get him before the others.
---
Spirit is a blast to play. She is really hard to get rid of because her power is based on her turning invisible and moving at rapid speed for a short period, but all the survivors also turn invisible. Of all killers in the game, I think spirit is the one that most rewards skill and gamesense. I liken the spirit to being a nurse that is still powerful, but doesn't break the game. She has a couple of good perks. Haunted grounds is awesome for protecting your totems, though, if you don't have the hag, you may not have totems worth protecting with a second perk. Spirit fury automatically breaks a pallet that stuns you every so often and that can be great if combined with endurance to give a nasty scare to the survivors. If you don't feel like the hag, this is who I would recommend.
---
Last is.. the legion. The legion is simply a bad killer. They aren't an especially weak killer, they are just badly designed. You would likely find some fun at first dashing around with them, but quickly you realize that the legion breaks the most important mechanic in the game, the chase. Legion isn't really escapable by a survivor if you have any kind of skill, so once legion starts a chase, it is just a question of waiting for legion's cooldown to go down after using their ability to take down a survivor, it just isn't very good for either team. Their perks are pretty mediocre too. Legion isn't worth it unless you have all the other DLCs. 
---
Well I'll be damned
---
I agree the grind for new players can be overwhelming. Starting off with one perk slot is a pain but usually remedied after just a few matches worth of BP. 
---
Though it’s only a start, be sure to do the killer and survivor tutorials for some easy BP to start off at least. I can’t recall how much they are worth but I think they can at least get a survivor to a playable level. Other than that, I recommend every new player start leveling Claudette or Meg for their teachables. Feng is also a great survivor to start playing with as her unique perks are very helpful as you learn the game.
---
Touch. 
---
Oh thanks. 
---
Yea you can work around them to a certain extent but it kind of defeats the whole purpose of the killer if you have to work, around them, but I love the cosmetics for them though, expcecially Frank 
---
More specifically Deep Wounds was changed so that it only ticks down outside of a chase, but if you aren’t looking at the target while following them it won’t trigger a chase, which means they will bleed out. That said doing this will likely mean you won’t get more than two kills assuming they do gens as you still have to follow around the survivor in order to down them like this. 
---
Trump is my president and the face of my country, doesn't mean I go onto r/politics and circle jerk about it every week. I can't stand him and he has an actual impact of my life unlike a DBD streamer.
---
oh oke nice, did u reach rank 1 with myers?
---
You know the perk is bugged and are still choosing to use it. Thats abusing a bug, pretty toxic.
---
I know what you mean by that combo on a newbie, but that killer still doesn't break any rules nor being toxic.
---
It's annoying yes, cause you see he was a newbie and at the end he gets 2-3 kills.
---
I for one don't see that as a problem or nearly close to what toxic survivors do in a match. I play survivor, mostly with friends, and I couldn't care less if I get Mori-ed by the killer or that he uses hexes. 
---
By all means, I'm looking and hoping in a match for Legion to Mori me, I love it :))
---
He was in treatment mode, could've just jumped once you found the angle...
---
No problem!
---
I will do whatever I feel is necessary to win.  Blow me.
---
Who needs bloodpoints when you become the great Ace Vischesti: Looter of chests and gifter of gifts.
---
His ability makes chases the same exact thing every time, the opposite of interesting
---
I've never had such random mismatched matchmaking games as today, it's really weird. I started taking screenshots because it's really wild. 
---
Your channel doesn’t even appear when I search for it. I also logged into the link I was provided and it just said something went wrong. 😕
---
I just want everyone to have fun man, I’m sick of how divided this community is. It’s been bad for a long time and I just wanna do my part in making it better for everyone. I don’t need a 4k to feel like i won. If i played my best and had fun, that’s a win in my book.
---
&gt;Hating one of the biggest parts of the game that keeps it popular. People want to play with their friends, and bitching about it won’t change anything.
---
As if its popularity has anything to do with my opinion on it? Everybody fucking knows the real issue with SWF: voice comms. Anybody who brings up people "playing with their friends" is just trying to distract from that. Full stop. I'm not going to let that go. 
---
&gt;Good god what kind of baby are you? You want everything handed to you on a silver platter.
---
Calling a stranger a baby because you don't like what they're saying? How immature. Also, I don't want anything "handed to me on a silver platter". Wanting a fair game that this game was actually balanced and designed around isn't wanting anything "handed to me on a silver platter". Get over yourself. 
---
Then that's a one time scenario, that happens at the beginning of the match due to that particular killer's skill. It's nothing like survivors assuming the killer has a mori and completely changing how they'll play the entire game around it. 
---
&gt;You don’t need to see exactly how many keys and flashlights are going in, or if everyone is taking the same survivor skin, or any of it really.
---
Too bad the devs agree with me, and, shocker, actually designed how the lobby works to give killers that edge. The game is a 1v4. The 1 is designed in this game to know what they're going up against, items and all. Also, your little speech about killer power in this game is laughable. A good team can literally run circles around the killer and have multiple second chances due to their perks and playstyle. Don't give me that shit.
---
Also, nice on calling me a baby yet again simply because you don't agree with me. 
---
&gt;It’s less about disagreeing and more about being an obvious (and correct) conclusion about your character.
---
No, it's because you disagree and because you're just being salty. Your "conclusion" about me is drop dead wrong and, again, extremely immature.
---
Pig isnt that bad. Noe if she first downs you and doesnt pot a RBT on, play carefully. She knows what she is doing.
---
Then you didn't trap anyone if you were playing pig because a trap gives 500 bp
---
Seconded.  The Hag plays well with Ruin and Devour Hope.  If you can run a trap queen game you can delay it enough to always hit the Devour Hope Mori criteria. 
---
You have a really good sense of humor 
---
I would have thought Detective Tapp is harder to spot than Claudette? I was gonna P3 and max one but now not sure which. 
---
Myers is the only killer that will scare/give me anxiety. Beginning of the match I will always sweat and look over my shoulder waiting for a myers. When I see another survivor hit and no music to follow, i get such relief.
---
Hold down the power to charge. Charging increases the distance you blink to at a steady rate until you reach the maximum range (at which point nurse clenches her fist). After blinking, you have about a second to choose to blink again, strike, or do nothing. You can become fatigued (when you slow and hang your head after a blink) while charging the second blink.
---
If you try to blink to a point within terrain, I believe you are "ejected" to the nearest empty space.
---
Nurse moves slower than sprinting survivors normally, so it is imperative to use the blink to catch them.
---
The only way to get better is to practice and gain muscle memory. Her entire game plan is precision and reads, so there aren't a lot of how-to's and tricks to get better.
---
But im still guessing you did have the fear of get caught and your dead im guessing? The day before i wrote this i saw someone on their first chase just die due to rancor. And the killer didnt deserve it because everytime I 360 the killer runs in the opposite direction because their so bad. And it's a legion so it's kinda shocking that i can 360 them. Just gets alot of undeserved kills 
---
That’d be a good joke.
---
You can grab in treatment mode too
---
Literally a post on the front page yesterday about it
---
Would be fun if devs can make a new gamemode like: let's pretend we are in a abandoned castle. The obkective is to escape(obviously) but not by doing gens over and over again....but doing something else like finding a plug and connect it to reset the power and find the exit while meanwhile you can hide( also, it would be nice if we can have new hiding mechanics like hiding under a bed or make a pile of junk over you while you peone to hide).   
---
For this, we'll need a bigger map.
---
In my opinion it would be nice a new gamemode, not just gen-hook camping.... It would be immersive and interesting.
---
LOL yeah so dumb for a popular team-based game, LOL.
---
This was probably the worst chapter they’ve ever released imo. The only redeeming thing being Jeff looks cool. It just sucks cuz spirit was such a well designed fun killer and now we have... legion 🤢

Considering how long it's taking to find games, I'd say that the poor console optimization is indeed causing people to stop playing the game. Hell, I'm one of them. I finally decided to give the game another shot last night after not playing for a month, got major frame drops every time I took a swing as a killer or got hit as a survivor, turned the game off, and have no intention of trying again. Games take way too long to find just have a frustrating experience that's out of my control because the frames consistently drop to single digits.

Dead and Daylight, is what I thought the game was title. Sorry my bad. It's dead By daylgight (DBD)

Not the content 95% of this sub is interested in. Believe it or not, most people aren't on this sub to have people RP as tabloid media digging up dirt.

Brother may I have a new meme
---
It tends to happen on console when you try blinking right after getting stunned.
---
Literally a post about her on the front page yesterday
---
They drop a nuke on Ormond?
---
I feel like hiding the rest of the game when there are 2 survivors and the hatch is available is worse than a dc. Survivors are a team, where is the teamwrk?
---
I didn't know that, seems awully broken to me, one more reason to hate the doc...
---
Legion!
---
It’s all subjective, we build our mental images of certain survivors/killers based on those one or two particularly bad experiences. I personally never see toxic Neas, for example, but I’ve been farmed and sandbagged by multiple Claudettes and Kates so when I think of a toxic survivor, I think of them. But there’s nothing to say any particular survivor is toxic or not, it’s just memes, like Dwights and lockers.

Wayyyyyyy easier with good add-ons like an instant chainsaw other than that it can get pretty difficult especially in red ranks same thing with Wraith hard to play without add-ons. Im a killer main but I've been recently maining survivor and I've went up against sum pretty bad billies mostly because they didn't have any add-ons. I have also went up against some good billies without an instant saw or sum and they kicked my ass. I was never into Billy when I was a killer main so I am a little inexperienced, so on that regard I hope I helped.
---
Those are MY HOOKS!!!
---
Devour hope is fun on pretty much any killer. Might not be powerful, but it makes a fun game for all involved so long as you can keep your totem from being destroyed. Devour hope is the only way I have found to mori people wihout survivors crying about it.
---
What rank are you?
---
Everyone was okay and gg eachother and then the killer starts saying really unnecessary stuff like "4 ds" you were asking for it.
---
I also see two Claudettes

level 100 mafia boss: pharmacy, plunderers instinct, ace in the hole, open handed
---
If their in Tier3 not really but the illusion last so little it doesn't really work in your favor but with the add on it last about 3 seconds and you get a notification 
---
Nice job ... just put some camping gear near her and you nailed it. 
---
Billy struggles on tight maps (meat plant, lery's... duh) but that doesn't mean you can't utilize his power. Rev it up to get survivors to spin, but let the button go before sprinting. You can hit it again if you think you can land a sprint, and it'll be partially charged.
---
Use sprint for it's speed to apply pressure to gens. Just crossing the map crazy fast is worth a lot.
---
Don't be afraid to use sprint to close distance after an m1 hit or decisive strike
---
That's why I slaughter everyone. No risk that I got the wrong person. 
---
I find it cute that you somehow protect survivors when you're a killer main while I do the opposite.
---
Survivors are mostly the cancer of this game, especially in SWF. I'm playing with friends and solo and I feel sorry for the killer when I see what the others do to him/her. All the hate and mean words thrown at the killer because s/he tries to adapt to a bunch of children doing the most idiotic things by using in-game abilities. 
---
When I played killer today I actually got a message from a survivor (dunno how s/he saw my id before the match) asking me to play NORMAL. Like wtf...now we ask killers what perks, addons and style to use so we can feel safe and not die? This must be a joke.

That one worked! I’m subscribed and enjoying the content! Thank you! 😁

What about the shooter?
