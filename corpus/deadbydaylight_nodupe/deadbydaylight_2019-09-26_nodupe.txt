You already got the max amount of bloodpoints avaliable for the objective category in that match)(8k),bold is a different category

---
---
More deserve this.
---

---
***And I shall enforce it.***
---
This is really good holy shit.
---
Looping? Healing? Do you want the survivors to stand still and let them hit you? If you're this sensitive maybe don't play the role of killer lol.
---
If you look in the patch notes it states in "known issues" that there's a problem between the killer vs survivor timers.
---
they updated it, there are going to be servers in aus upon release
---
Nothing like a grab animation deciding halfway through that it would rather be a weapon strike. I have lost a few kills to this bullshit as well Thomas.
---
When i am a killer and someone teabags, aside from exit gates, i feel so humiliated, it like them saying “you suck i pro, you will never catch”, so I focus all my game on them and camp. And I don’t think I’m a toxic, well, toxic, but not a moron.
---
EVERYONE AND THEIR MOM WANTS TO PLAY DEMOGORGON CUZ THEY THINK THEYRE ACTUALLY GOOD
---
Do you know how averages work? 2 ranks 1s, a rank 7, and a rank 19 give you an average of 7. Sounds fair to me
---
oh, never heard of that. sucks
---
Thank you
---
Eh what? No they wouldn’t. Ds and borrowed are a thing
---
I swear bhvr just hates the pig for some reason..
---
Either way i would be fine with, its just a trade off. I just feel bad for someone who may join the game too late and not be able to get a skin that ends up being their favorite.
---
Maybe a timed system? Like it gets added to the shop a few months afterwards, so theres still a limited time where you can use an earned skin, and by the time others can buy it you have more season skins to choose from.
---
It was just a shitty example of how 1 or 2 low ranks could skew it badly
---
It’s because the only viable killers are nurse, spirit and hillbilly with ruin.  Maybe if all the other killers got buffed you would see more diversity.
---
Feeling is about the same on the other side, against well coordinated bully squads killer sometimes feels hopeless.
---
Just gotta take your licks and keep going, or take a sabbatical and play something less intense for a while.
---
I GOT FACECAMPED BY A LEATHERFACE BECAUSE I LOOPED HIM ON A BUSH AND HE FACECAMPED MY FRIEND I DID A GEN RIGHT NEXT TO HIM AND HE JUST STARED AT ME WHILE I WAS.DOING IT AND THEN HE FACE CAMPED ME AFTER I TRIED TO SAVE MY FRIEND I KNOW I SHOULDNT HAVE TRIED TO SAVE HIM BUT I DIDNT WANT TO LEAVE HIM BEHIND!

You somehow forgot Hag. Dont forget Lisa.
---
You fucking deserved it you toxic degenerate
---
I mean once end game starts that means and exit was opened and if you just opened that one, what were you doing for the rest of that time if the killer wasnt near you?
---
That was a Fox film, not Disney. Fox had the F4 and X-Men rights until they were bought out by Disney which recently just happened
---
Look at his fitness, its obviously clown
---
Rank error???
---
Sorry but playing high ranks as killer is nowhere as hard as it once was. The power role is definitely in the killer players hands as long as they're competent. I rarely ever lose on R1 PC and I mostly just play pig/GF/myers.
---
*laughs in bloodwarden*
---
if you get in a game with a SWF all with the name "lets farm" you should farm and not be a ass
---
Yes because that's a very viable and good perk lmao
---
That will teach ya
---
i watched the same think today i was playing surv against the clown in the swamp and one of the guys dc ... and the clown as kind of bad " having a time tracking surv etc " so i did some looping and gens and finally the 5 gens are done i go look for him to let him get some points etc etc ... let him drop me and the guy carries me to the gate and im ok m8 tks ...
---
i exit the gate go to spectate the other surviver still in game ... its a fucking claudetteZy  fast jumping over a pallet to draw the killer since there was a open hatch right to is side ... the guy waited for the clown and then decided to run to the escape while butt dancing  half a second before jumping in and the bar still had 20% or something 
---
is Killed like that it was hilarious 
---
i commented whit the killer maybe its a new stealth mechanism that after you open the gate every butt dance you do takes a second off the bar and the surv cant see it
---
I hope one day people will have a stronger mental.

Entity looking out for bullied killers indeed.

What killers are you playing that you still allow yourself to get bullied on? Sorry but if you're still getting bullied at this point in the game you're probably just terrible.
---
you’re*
---
The one time sale won't keep servers running. Imho no cosmetic should ever be free or "free" until a year has passed since its release.
---
I mean same could be said about everyone playing spirit/nurse then.
---
Though I wouldn't consider it toxic - It's still just people refusing to let go of toxicity from previous games and resulting to playing OP shit against people who had nothing to do with the toxicity they received in the previous games.
---
None of them, girls fucking suck at sucking dick,
---
He would be the only killer in the game responsible for actual deaths, so that would be pretty bad ass.
---
I realize it perfectly.
---
It always takes 8k blood points to "fill the bar".
---
If you start fully red, that sounds like a bug, check if you always end the game with 8k in "Objectives" as well.
---
Congratulations if that is the case.
---
Then your title stands. The perk is designed well, and is functioning completely normal.
---
Lol as if you know what happened, get rekt. Some of us don't even care as much about tbe points as long as i kill people i find toxic in my match, I've probably DCd the same way to show survivors the points aren't that important.
---
Just run Spine Chill if you hate Prayer Beads, tbh Spine Chill mega underrated.
---
This man gets it.
---
Jane Romero with head on and bbq chili
---
The EGC is desynchronized between the killer and survivor.
---
You got it backwards in your replies. You can play a game perfectly as killer and still lose badly if the survivor make no mistakes. The outcome of the game is completely in their hands.
---
why are you downvoted? 
---
The Killer is 1v4, his/her perks need to make said 1v4 at least fair, hence they need to be strong
---
It can get very dark...not wrong about that
---
I dont know what to tell you. The system of averages isnt perfect, but it works much better than either of the 2 systems weve had.
---
 The changes we just got mess up actual SWFs. A group with 2 rank 17s, a rank 15, and a rank 10 should face a rank 14. Thats enough for the killer to not be looped silly but give the survivors a chance. Now they face a rank 10. 
---
New players will be driven away by this, more so than killers who were driven away by bully sqauds.
---
 This is an unhealthy solution that doesnt fix the problem and instead just makes another problem to cover it up. An averaged system works 80-90% of the time, instead of working none of the time like it does now. 
---
Really, the issue here is deranking. The average system is perfect until you consider that red ranks can become brown ranks with almost no effort. The new system doesnt fix that, youll just be facing 4 deranked survivors instead of 1 deranked and 3 red ranked
---
Oh god no... I’ll check it out
---
I think I'm biased because I'm a developer, not in gaming but I think I'm just more lenient in general because I don't think most see the bigger picture of what is being implemented.
---
They completely remade the matchmaking and lobby system in a game that's over 3 years old and it's a huge change, I think people need to understand that it won't be perfect straight away and it will get a lot better pretty soon.  I think the mild inconvenience is worth the overall QOL improvement it will become in probably &lt; 3 months.
---
What the hell is that face
---
Dodging a lobby when they all run flashlights
---
I'm just going to be honest. You and all the people commenting on this dont know shit about code or the difficulty of specific programming tasks. The shit going on is unacceptable. If you release a console game it is supposed to be optimized for that console. That framerate shit going on on console is unacceptable. They have the same hardware to test their console versions there is no reason why it shouldn't function properly enough to be at least playable!
---
It's not entitlement dumbass it's called when you buy a fucking product it's supposed to actually be usable. I'm so tired of people defending shitty developers and whining to everyone about how hard programming is and that they are doing their best when honestly if you program in high level languages and cant make a functioning product YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS being in the industry whatsoever.
---
You can optimize fucking mesh in a night if you know what you are doing and that's what needs to be done! The framerate drops from the killer's ISNT because of the stupid code it's the models! Models are way easier to optimize than code.
---
If youd take time to crawl out of BHVR's ass you could learn these things instead of trying to make shitty software products a standard..
---
The spirit is one of those killers where it's more so her addons that Re o erpoweres than the spirit herself, like Myers. A nurse with no add-ons is a lot more balanced.
---

---
Anti-alising is forced changing it to 0 wont do anything not to mention for most people it will already be set to 0 if you were playing on low,, tried that on stream last night it changes nothing.. Game still looks shit,
---
Ooh! What are the other cosmetic descriptions, this looks cool!
---
Happened to me too.
---

---
i would say Adam 'cause we are rare and we need more players maining him, he's underrated
---
but imo, if you care about some advantages, then Kate 'cause she's the quietest female
---
As a pig main you should PM me those if you feel comfortable with that 🙃
---
Are you blind? Trapper is def the gigachad, just look at his overly sexualised overall
---
Well if we're talking within the context of the clip, He is saying this is why people play the OP shit.
---
Also - I did say I don't think it's toxic to play a certain character.
---
Honestly don't know how to feel about his switch set as it's pretty great besides the weapon but , it's free for all switch owners which is great if you have it on the switch but the other consoles (not including PC they got plenty of exclusives) get nothing.
---
Also didn't react to the squeak of the locker, so... I'm thinking they were being distracted by something.

I don’t get why killers sometimes just sit there and take it. Why not force them to leave? That’s what I do
---
first off using iphone how many people don't know android winning second off thats cold
---
All the angry comments are from people who aren't killer mains.
---
 Nice meme 10/10
---
I haven't played since before the August 13th rank reset, so I'm expecting to get treated like a newbie!
---
There is a bug currently relating to this issue, I played against a killer that popped a BPS, we ended up winning and after the match, it said they dc'd. I messaged them and they said they didn't leave and got their points.
---
So I assume that is the same thing that happened here.
---
Really hoping a legion was involved.
---
P l a u g e
---
Probably lunged instead of short attacking
---
Do people know that of you sand to close to the opening through a window the killer can still hit you right?? So even if you've crawled through the window, if you close enough to it still the killer can hit you
---
Also because it's almost impossible to guarantee that even distant gates don't have points where both can be seen. As it is, it sometimes favours survivors, sometimes favours killers.
---
It's a bandaid fix for your exact issue
---
Literally counters Prove Thyself which everyone complains about :|
---
I honestly feel it wasn't that needed but it's nice to have I still feel he's kinda mediorce in my experiences and just going against him in general
---
I don't think so.
---
Just looked up chipmunks getting head *shrugs*
---
What? I did watch it. I’m not saying he did sit there and take it. I’m saying that there are some killers who do that, and I wonder why they don’t just force the survivors to leave. “So you didn’t have enough time to watch the 15s clip I guess” why don’t you not assume that I’m directly referencing the clip next time?
---
I never cleanse a hex totem if it’s just Thrill of the hunt, I know the Killer just wants the BP and I respect that.
---
Just don't tunnel forehead.
---
THIS NEW MATCHMAKING SYSTEM IS STUPID. I'M SO SICK OF PLAYING WITH MY FRIENDS AND ME AT RANK 15 - 20 AND MY ONE FRIEND AT RANK 10 AND NOW WE GET WITH RANK 10 KILLERS. 
---
IT RUINS THE TEAM ASPECT OF THIS GAME.
---
I even play killer myself at high ranks so seeing them try and pretend like killer doesn’t have the upper hand right now is just sad lol. You’re not suddenly 4king because you’re good at the game, playing killer just got way easier
---
They need to make sure they are balanced and make three unique perks and keep the killer from crying, they need to ask permission so they won't pay a fine, there are several more reasons why they can't add everything people want, so please stop whining about not having a cool character. I want them as much as you do, but for god's sake be realistic.
---
Maybe a stupid question, but why? Kinda new to the game
---
Honestly I play huntress and I hate iri head? It feels so much better for me to have more hatchets.
---
how to depip 101 right here
---
Uh... X-Men was rebooted with First Class.

F4 was rebooted because the Silver Surfer one was garbo, and they probably would've lost the screen rights for the series if they didn't make another movie.

No, that’s not what I’m getting at. Spirit has addons that have no counter and Nurse has loads of them that have virtually no counter. 3 blinks shouldn’t exist. Prayer beads shouldn’t exist. And as survivor? At red ranks, even if there’s a 2 man voice chatting swf, the killer is at a disadvantage

Cause wraith=bad

This man is speaking facts.

Or unless they run franklins demise &gt;~&lt;;

THANK YOU. people will break their own backs defending bhvr for not doing their jobs. it’s exhausting. i literally bought the game because the nurse looked cool as fuck only to find that i can’t even play her. that was over a year ago and nothing’s changed.
---
Did that take you all night genius?
---
Survivors have ways of completely ignoring killer game mechanics. Trapper places a trap? Disarm it. Ghostface staring at you? Break from stealth. M1 killer trying to chase? Throw a pallet. Makes it so killers can’t use game mechanics and win. Darn.
---
Is it really worth dropping prove thyself though since prove thyself gives such a boost to gen speed and BP gain? :0
---
Really bad meme tbh.
---
Yeah.. after every match the error “disconnected from host” blah blah occurs. Sometimes we end up in our party sometimes to the main screen. Connection times are terrible, killer party times are terrible.
---
what does "BM's" mean
---
Inner strength is soooo good! I just recently started trying it!
---
Somehow I don't run into those overly altruistic SWF groups you are talking about. At least not often. I run into the SWF groups that fan out to 4 different generators the second the game starts and manage to loop me until 3 generators pop at the same time.
---
Nothing you said disproves anything I said. If the survivor play smart and make no mistakes, they win. 
---
You can pressure them and hope they make a mistake but in my experience this does not happen that easily in high ranks. Or you become a godlike nurse player.
---
I also really don't care for the tone of your post.
---
Bad Manners

Well I play legion so that’s what I do 😇😇
---
I only saw the End Game Collapse Event 2 Times today, in both cases it ended that way. During the first Game i thought it could be a Ping Problem, it happened as the Timer was close to the End anyways, but the Situation in the Video is quite Gamebreaking, to say the least.
---
Furthermore, i have a strange graphical Issue since the last Update arrived and my Mouse Sensitivity is resetting itself to like 1% after each Game.   
---
Of course this has to happen just a few days before the Bloodpoint Event .\_.
---
Lost me a game bc i thought the last survivor went to the gate across the map, I didn't even get in sight of the other door and they escaped
---
What is a battlepass?
---
Th X-men movies we’re making money. Not a hard concept
---
I'm not mad or flaming or anything I'm just so sick of shitty developers getting defended by people who literally have NO IDEA what they are talking about.
---
Yes it did.
---
It’s really up to you how you play. A lot of people act like the killer isn’t supposed to have fun. You took advantage of a situation the survivors put themselves in and won in a legitimate fashion. Survivor mains are extremely entitled, and I say that as a survivor main.
---
I've mained Pig since forever and never had this happen to me. Is there a video of it or anything?
---
Most people dont deserve the salt but still get it. You had a plan and played it out nothin wrong with that.
---
The survivor feels the windows pain.
---
It's just that the game didn't save. That happened to me a lot.
---
I was wondering if these people existed. Weird how you came at me for not knowing anything about coding when I never said I knew anything about it? Whatever though, you’re upset, it’s cool. 
---
Idk how long you’ve been around the game so on case you don’t know, this game was PORTED to console after being RELEASED on Steam like whole year before that, where it was in early access before THAT. Do you know what early access DBD was like?? I can’t *EXPRESS* the hot mess that was. But I loved the idea, I loved the gameplay, and apparently so did a lot of other people. Was it a shitty port? Yes, I still have nightmares about the input lag for skill checks, but man has it come far since then. 
---
Now, after starting off with 3!!!! killers, seeing this game with (I don’t know off the top of my head) killers and all the licensed shit they’ve been able to get ahold of, incorporating so many new mechanics that, even if minor, basically changed your whole way you had to think when you play, yeah maybe I’m a little bit up their ass. They’ve been consistently delivering on content for a fun game l, why shouldn’t i be?
---
They were even kind enough to listen to all of us bitching about disconnecting and hitboxes and everything to take a chunk out of however much cash they made off the game to invest in dedicated servers like we always wanted! Like holy fuck, I have to wait an extra 3 months, *MAYBE* longer, for something that I bet the Devs never imagined would be necessary when they made the game and that we’ve been asking for forever??? Sign me up! They didn’t have to do that, they just could’ve said “nah sorry we don’t think it’d work”.
---
But uh yes I do believe complaining about that could be interpreted  as entitlement.
---
YEET
---
No, it's awful, only effects 3 players and gives one a free botany knowledge, by the time you have enough stacks for it to so something everyone but the obsession will be dead, any other slowdown perk is better
---
I don't think you understand that counters to killers need to exist, trapper is underpowered, but without counterplay there is no game. How do you counter nurse? Stealth? Stealth doesn't work when perks like bbq and chilli exist.
---
no, they are just entitled survivors, play however you want
---
Hooooooly cow these perks are OP. I’m guessing you’re a survivor-main.
---
how?
---
When you activate night shroud your terror radius will be zero and you will have no red stain. While in night shroud you have the ability to stalk people and expose them for a certain amount of time and 1 hit them. But if they stare at you for long enough you will be taken out of night shroud and it will be put on cool down. There are while signals on your screen from where the person that is revealing you is. Idk if this helped but good luck
---
Yeah I know I was confused too.
---
Guys this is a clear /s how'd he get downvoted?
---
Yeah jotaro should be the one saying that line lol.
---
That’s not the same thing lol, that’s the counterplay to those killers. Not saying nurse is impossible to beat because 99% of people aren’t perfect which means she’s beatable, but there realistically isn’t any other killer who could do even half as well as her **without** addons. Addons make her completely broken true, but even without them, her power completely breaks the mechanics that literally every other killer has to follow.
---
Some survivors get mad just for you out playing them. I run make your choice and devour hope and still get *called out* for camping and tunneling.
---
OH SHIT WHAT A BEAUTIFUL *IDEA* 
---

---
Ah, ty
---
If plague or huntress were my sleep paralysis demons, I would be looking forward to it :)
---
Adrenaline, balanced landing, dead hard, spine chill/,self care or inner strength , bond, and DS are probably the most common ones you’ll see . I personally run adrenaline, balanced landing, bond, and self care.
---
Borrowed Time (Bill), Dead Hard (David), Adrenaline (Meg), Decisive Strike (Laurie). That’s pretty much the standard. Otherwise you’ll run into mixtures of builds using Quick and Quiet, Object of Obsession, Balanced Landing, and now Inner Strength and Fixated. Still might run into Self Care as well but definitely not as much as you used to.
---
That's why they added the locker blindness.
---
Absolutely no salt deserved.  Just shitty survivors who just want the game to be fun for them but don't give a shit about whether it's fun for you and executing basic strategy.
---
Pig buff we need you already!
---
Well, BbQ has plenty of counterplay (lockers, the one jeff teachable, going towards the hook). Also, nurses *can* be juked. It takes a huge amount of skill on the survivors part to create 50/50’s where the nurse has to guess or miss, but it’s possible. Inb4 “Oh, good nurses never miss” that’s just untrue.
---
You can't play against her like M1 killers so idk why the pallet thing matters especially when she already gets punished by being stunned after blinking every time which more than makes up for it.
---
  You deal with nurses by reading their movements and avoiding line of sight.  If you can't read their movements at least break line of sight which makes them just guess if you still get hit it's on you for being predictable. 
---
getting into a locker gets you killed by every killer I have no idea why you thought that was a remotely decent argument.
---
Like I said running away with line of sight can really fuck over nurse especially if you add shit like  Iron Will &amp; Dead Hard into the mix(which are both EXTREMELY common so it's not like a what if scenario). 
---
 The big problem with your list too is you're acting like the person playing nurse is making no mistakes but the survivors are apparently idiots? what?  It's the same with people like billy, huntress, demogorgon, etc.  If you are preditable you will be beaten by the killer with their power despite it being able to be mindgamed.
---
If what you said is true nurse should be getting 4k every single game in no time flat no excuses.
---
Her power IS strong but nowhere near "Broken" what's broken is her ability to teleport 25% of the map with 2 low rarity addons.
---
As someone who owns no DLC and has only seen a small amount of Legion gameplay in videos:  what exactly does Deep Wound do from the survivor's perspective?  The wiki just says "bleed out timer" but doesn't explain exactly what that means as far as gameplay mechanics.  What advantage does the killer get from it?
---
You'll get hit with the survivor rule book no matter what you do. I kind of get where the survivors were coming from, they put themselves into a bad position and there was no way out for them, so they had to hang there and watch a timer tick down. That is no fun.
---
Now, unless this was during the endgame colapse, you could have played for more bloodpoints or more rank gain if you try to hunt down the missing survivor.
---
If the other 2 get unhooked, you can now hit them again which gives points for your Chaser emblem and you can hook them again which gives points for your Devout Emblem.
---
But if you decide that 3 kills is plenty and you don't want to give them up, that is your decission, sucks to be on the other side though. I know I get a little bit mad if it happens to me (but I am terrible at looping / escaping)
---
Do what you want, facecamp the hook if you really must.
---
The reason camping is frowned upon is because it's a waste of time for everyone involved. Nobody is getting bloodpoints and you are actually losing ranking by standing around the hook.
---
If you just play for fun though just do whatever you want, who cares what people say.
---
Calm down, buddy.
---
Make sure you’re getting as many bloodpoints as possible. Remember staying to close to hooked players when not chasing someone will make you lose emblem points. Try and get around eight hooks a game. Also this is the strategy I used. Stalk up to 99ing just before tier three then save it for the obsession less save the best for last tokens lost.
---
Int3r4ct on YouTube has a good guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkDyYBg5oYw
---
But basically when you're in your power you have no terror radius and no red stain. The red stain shows where you're looking at as the killer. People usually turn their camera away from the way they're headed to make survivors not see this and get them by surprise. If a survivor is looking at you, even if you go behind cover they keep revealing you in your ability for .3 seconds. Leaning to stalk is a lot faster than stalking while not leaning. If you crouch then lean you can still lean while standing. good to stalk someone who is injured getting them to around 85-99% to then stalk them when they're healthy to then 1 shot them (85 because at that point if you're chasing someone and they're looking right at you you can fully make them 1 shot before they can reveal you). Add on wise chewed pen + the yellow recovery add on take off 14 of the 30 seconds it takes for it to recharge normally.
---
Iron maiden
---
yeah i'd like some fuck too please misses huntress daddy
---
Why bond and self care? You could run borrowed time and help your team
---
I’m dyslexic
---
There have been reports of the projectile collision being off. They might have it worked out by the time it launches, it will still probably be different from what we are used to though, since those killers are going from pretty much 0 lag on projectiles to whatever the ping will be from them to the server and the other player to the server.
---
WHAT TIME DOES BLOODHUNT START???
---
It's extremely easy to counter BBQ and chili what? you literally just need to enter a locker or be within range, not to mention there's actual perks outside off the default game mechanics that completely counter the perk.  You ask for counter play when it already exists.
---
Ok move on to the next match

Ahhh I see. Even though the killer tunneled and camped, I still felt bad thinking he didnt get the points lol
---
I gues she did after all. Good.
---
I kind of agree with you, but I think another problem is the bad matchmaking and the rank reset.
---
You get matched with people way over or way under your skill level all the time and it ends in a stomp most of the time. That is not much fun for the stomper and decididly less fun for the stompee. 
---
It also makes for a terrible first impression for new players. If you want to see this taken to the extreme, take a look at Deathgarden, the other BHVR game on steam right now.
---
If your unhooking, you're almost certainly going to end up in a chase.
---
The longer you last in the chase, the more boldness bloodpoints you'll get.
---
Gens are kinda shitty for BP, A full gen solo is 1250. Stunning the killer once with a pallet is 1000.
---
The bloodpoints you gain are during the game and not after like WGLF. So they still suffer from the cap.
---
What? You think I just sat there? Lol
---
staying in a lobby and running franklins when they all run flashlights
---
Watch out, I heard Plague's a spitter.
---
Only through the ashes can you be reborn
---
If youre on steam right click on the game and click properties and click the button that says something like "check game files" and it will fix the issue, atleast for me it has
---
There isn't always a locker around/iron maiden exists, the jeff perk has 4 uses and being near a hook seems to be the safest. It's just not always possible and when nurse finds you, unless THEY make mistakes, you cannot get away.
---
I dont think you understand. A "new killer" will never be placed with high rank survivors with an average system. The only way thats possible is if the entire team deranks, and guess what? The new system can be beaten if the entire team deranks. You have essentially proved your argument wrong, because if an entire team deranks, then they will face new killers no matter what. 
---
You cant stop people from deranking without dedicated servers, so no matter what system they put in, bully squads exist. This "fix" fixes nothing that an average system does not, aside from fucking over new survivors who are trying to have fun. 
---
SWF is unbalanced, just like everything is in this game, but it is also the center of this game, and you do nothing but fuck innocent survivors up while doing nothing to actual bully squads with the new system. You are the one being dishonest if you cant see that
---
Fuck franklin's, I would never do that to even a swf, i don't like wasting their white wards if they use it
---
You guys are unepic. We all can agree that Wraith is best girl with those legs.

Because the way reddit works, is usually people post things that reference the post. That's why I (falsely) assumed that you were directly referencing the clip that this thread is about. My bad.
---
Thank you I tried it with my other controller and it works fine! Sorry it took me long to reply I just remembered you
---
The tv is leaking!
---
Well, why should the game always be in the survivor’s hands? In every other case save a good spirit, it’s in the survivors’ hands.
---
Just to piggyback, since you were awesome enough to list which characters give what perks. 
---
Decisive Strike is in the Shrine this week.
---
Which is completely okay that there's not always lockers around, you seem to just want people to turn off perks?  it's GOOD that it isn't 100% guaranteed that is good game design.  It's BAD game design for something to either have no counter play or no use.  Also it's not bad that someone gets revealed by BBQ because it draws the killers attention away from the hook &amp; the other THREE survivors to get the objectives done.   DBD isn't a 1v1 game.
---
Both are great. Don’t make cringe comparisons though. Personally I just like Susie more because hair, and her jacket is pretty cool. Reminds me of like 80s-90s vibe.
---
I was on the topic of the video, just not directly referencing it. Sorry for the hostility.
---
I'd love that also, alongside all the things I've bought for cells. At least cosmetics.

Happened to me too. I had to sabotage 2 hooks but it changed to a spirit ritual

Thanks for.the info.
---
Hey, have you ever been booted mid-match also for "no network connectivity " even though your ISP is fine?
---
So in order to use that effectively, you'd have to hit someone and then get the heck away from them as fast as you can?  That seems somewhat counter-intuitive.  Maybe just because it's different than how I'm used to playing.
---
I thought I was being meticulous on the name tag hah.  
---
Glad you caught it.
---
insta healed are not in any way comparable to nurse.  They are comparable to free exposed status effects like haunted ground, noed, make your choice, etc however it doesn't require a perk slot and can be used whenever you want.
---
I'm not mad man I'm just a programmer tired of shitty software with shitty code that I could bang out in a week as easy as taking a shit on the toilet in the morning. 
---
I'm 21 years old and I'm entirely self-taught. I have a family and I am FAR from married to my job. But as a software developer of literally anything digital, It pisses me off when these guys are making fucking millions of dollars pissing out spaghetti code.
---
It's like these guys are better at buttering up copyright owners than coding. They have the marketing they have the product idea they have the name they have the deals they have the licensing THEY HAVE THE ASSETS to finance a better programming team and turn this into a billion dollar idea. Deving dedicated servers IS NOT a 3 month project for a TEAM of developers... it's just utterly bullshit, nor is it an expensive one.. it should cost under 50 fucking grand.. BHVR is using our money to indulge, fuck, and get drunk all the time while they slack on their work. They made it big! They don't need to care about you guys anymore, because now that these dev's are associated with this game....they can get a DEV job wherever the hell they want now.

And how do you do that? If you are at a T wall, what do you do when she hears you and has two chances to teleport towards you.
---
I only play killer for rituals so of course I never kill anyone.  Got called trash the other day for not killing anyone but no one left with under 20k bp

Perks aside I'd love my fave L4D survivor in this

That was susposed to be a reply to the guy who said his Ash is at level 1.

Whups.

Guys this is sarcasm, dont be so dopey.
---
Its definitely supposed to be unbalanced.  Killer SHOULD be winning at least 70-80% of games.
---
Isn’t that how it’s supposed to be?
---
That was a survivor doing killer dailies, no killer would say that.
---
Video named "Depressing Clown Match" shows why no one plays Clown.
---
-Signed, a Clown main
---
Power Idea: Think of it as the opposite of Shape/Ghostface. 
---
This Killer would move at normal speed (115%) but their speed would reduce to 100% while their power is active. If a survivor looks at you while in the range of your terror radius their screen will distort. While they are looking at you a meter will begin to fill. If this meter completely fills the survivor will take one state of damage and the meter will deplete to 40%. The Killer will also receive an auditory notification (scream) revealing your location. Not looking at the Killer causes the meter to deplete slowly, considerably faster if you are outside of their terror radius.
---
Mind blown if true. I thought the Nurse's pillowcase was because after realizing what she had done (Strangled all those patients and staff to death in a fit of insanity) she tried to commit suicide out of guilt, and Doctor's electroconvulsive gear is something he wears to help conduct electricity for his abilities.

Oh thank you for the response! I love playing plague so this is good to know
---
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY SOME PEOPLE DOWNVOTED YOUR COMMENT

Yeah i roleplay a lot too lol, especially when i pull a cunt move like not letting the hook farmed guy go, i say "the entity made me do it" and wash my hands of the whole affair.

Oh ok. We'll make it is a good perk for you to use for now then
---
FOR THE PAST 20 SURVIVOR GAMES ON PS4, ABOUT 16 HAVE HAD KILLER DCS IN LOW RANKS AND IM TIRED OF IT.
---
I would like a sith robe for Dwight!
---
They're generally superior to p2p.
---
Simple. Don’t fucking go to T walls. Routing is different against nurse, but just as important. Just like u don’t run into the open against an m1, you don’t vault against a non-fatigued nurse
---
Haha that was so good to listen to lol, fun chick.
---
Meh, it wouldn’t hurt to bend the rules once in a while. 
---
Also tony could totally use the recognition.
---
Mind game her, I know crazy it's almost like you need to react instead of mindlessly running around in a circle and being rewarded for it.
---
Well...duh. 
---
How/why do you think red ranks are red ranks? Because they’re bad or use sub-optimal options in the game? If you’re ranking up then the competition is naturally going to get better and you’re going to run into builds that reflect that. It’s like going from amateur racing to pro racing and being upset that the other drivers have the best allowable engines. 
---
Everything said about playing against experienced users, strong killers, meta builds, etc., can all be said about survivors. In fact, it can be said about virtually any multiplayer game. I’m going to get the “you’re just a killer wanker main” response, but I’d be saying the exact same thing if a killer main were complaining about red ranked survivors that run DS and loop them all day.
---
Feng: “Parkour!”
---
Huntress: “You drunk.”
---
He's not really op, if anything goes wrong it can be hard to come back from. The only thing that's "overpowered" is no red stain or heartbeat while you can freely run around. But pig can do that aldo in chase without a cooldown. She just can't run at full speed while doing it. I felt like I was don't way better as him too when I started using him, I'm a huntress main but he's easily my 2nd killer 3rd is Demogorgon 4th is spirit
---
Even at green ranks (as a killer) I feel like I need more pressure so I use Ruin. The only way you won’t find top tier killers is if you see a killer who wants fun and tries multiple killers or a killer main but beware killer mains are just as deadly as top tier killers. Even if the killer is Legion or Bubba.
---
Anyway back on topic I don’t play a different killer unless they have Ruin, and BBQ unlocked at minimum plus they’re respective required tracking perk like Nurse’s or Whispers depending on killer (half the roster require more than BBQ) I just use it for Bloodpoints while I level others so I can diversify my own selection. I farm with Spirit ;)
---
No point in talking about red ranks with him, the way he seems to be displaying his argument he acts like green rank or lower and just venting from being bodied by a nurse
---
Also some perks you could run for him could be: Whispers (let’s you hear whispers when survivor are in a radius of you. It’s more accurate at tier 3), Spirit Fury ( to auto break pallets when you get stunned after you break 2 pallets), Hex: Ruin (to slow the game down especially since newer players won’t know the locations of totems and break it fast. It’s also good because ghostface doesn’t give much map pressure), and Barbecue and Chilli (to see survivors farther than about 50 meters after you hook a survivor). These are some good perks for him that I think might help but most of them are hard to get because they are teachables.
---
That's not a response, that's like saying just cleanse the totems once noed hits.
---
I knew Ash was trash, but for the love of the game, you know ya boi had to support👌🏽
---
It's more about stalling than it is about downing. You dont want to hit one person with it, the goal is to hit multiple so they waste time mending because of they dont theyll go down
---
Dude it’s hard to be scared of a killer you constantly play
---
4 people with flashlights is 4 people without toolboxes and insta heals, I’ll take trading out a perk for that every time my dude
---
so some killers leave "unsafe" pallets behind to lure survivors to a kill point. others like me just break them all and call it a day
---
I don't loop killers, never have in my 2000 hours, sometimes it gets me downed faster but it's more fun that way. How would you mindgame nurse?
---
"WAHHHH NOED IS OP CRUTCH PERK D,:" \*adrenaline, decisive, balanced, self care, key, tea-bagging\*
---
At first I hated Hag her height sucks but when you’re teleporting every 20 seconds and hitting a survivor it isn’t so bad ;D Hag is one of the unique play style killers at least out of all the defensive killers so I can see why you main her. I want to see who I’ll settle on maining myself, but I think I’ll just be toxic for awhile like tombstone myers and prayer bead spirit.
---
At least I piped lol
---
Hallowed blight for clown and legion would be sick
---
*its
---
I just got done with a game where someone was teabagging at the exit gate when the killer came. The person got hit to the dying position and someone intentionally bodyblocked them from getting out, enabling the killer to grab and hook them. (was there last hook chance). The guy was being a dick, but still played the game and helped. The guy messaged me asking me to report the body blocker.  I know a lot of people hate teabaggers, but intentipnal body blocking actually affects gameplay. I decided to report them, the body blocker was the only one in the wrong right?
---
Maybe they did? Like I said I assume all survivors at least are 18+ because killing kids is a real trouble issue in most countries, but I think *maybe* because it's a kid doing the killing and not getting killed herself (especially since she's 16 which is basically an adult) it might be more lax
---
Look while I appreciate you putting my wife as S tier. The hell is going on with the rest.
---
yeah but wraith OP nerf
---
Fuck yes i would get legions so fast
---
So much effort just to troll the community. I hate your work but respect the effort
---
*Laughs in pc*
---
well, you see wraith in his current is immensely overpowered and easily 4ks due to his intense stalling, map control, and the best chase power in the game
---
Depends on how you do it. If you read that they're gonna need to drop it to survive the pallet then it's good, but charging it up specifically to break the pallet after it's been dropped without any charge up add ons is a bad idea
---
So what? You can see the bing bong boy from a km away thanks to his silhouette. Let's say he sneaks up on you, he has to uncloak just to hit you, find a window/pallet and start the looping, he has no way to catch up.
---
The time it takes for wraith to down a good survivor is abysmal, and with no map control he just gets fucked over. Obviously, he's a nightmare for new players but tier lists aren't based on low ranks to be honest.
---
If you got problems with him, get spine chill in your builds, His stealth ability becomes useless.
---
Bruh, not complaining, but she could use at least a addon rework, cause if a nurse has good perks and she is good in general, u can get caught in a bad position and that’s game...
---
&lt;3, everyone but you took this so seriously. i can’t believe no one realized this was bait yet
---
FUCK PEOPLE WHO THINK SURVIVORS SHOULDN’T WIGGLE CAUSE YOU’RE GOING TO GIVE THEM HATCH. OFC THEY ARE GOING TO FUCKING WIGGLE IF YOU DON’T MAKE IT OBVIOUS YOU’RE GIVING HATCH AND IF A LITTLE WIGGLE TICKS YOU OFF AND YOU DECIDE TO KILL INSTEAD YOU’RE JUST A CRY BABY ASS BITCH.
---
Would it even be possible to make the frames better on 8 year old hardware without making the game look like literal dogshit?
---
yeah but invisibility 👀👀
---
that's exactly what I said
---
GF is my absolute favorite killer to face.
---
How the hell is your flair bill nye the science guy on a dead by daylight subreddit
---
Shirtless Dwight &amp; Steve
---
I play as bill, and you can edit flairs
---
Sometimes I teabag to be friendly and kind of tell the killer “GG” but that’s just close to him, like I stand in front of him, let him hit me so he gets a little bit of blood points and then leave
---
Personally I find myself playing against him almost as much as the hillbilly. At least hillbilly is fun and chases. Ghostface either feels incredibly weak or incredibly frustrating.
---
Half the time I will stare him in the eyes and get marked but the other half he can go a whole match without getting a Kill.
---
Playing as him feels ridiculously tedious and Goofy to the point where I think it's the Ghostface from Scary Movie. Constantly peeking around corners and moving left and right to look at survivors. It's basically a game of peek-a-boo and not in a fun or creepy way.
---
I almost always get him on maps like Memorial Institute or Haddonfield and half of the time my team just feeds him stalk.
---
 He also reminds me a good bit of Legion since they based Legion off of him originally from what I can tell. Just another dude with a knife behind a mask. 
---
I don't hate him or anything like I do Trapper or Legion but the best way to put it would be that he is inconsistent and frustrating. Half of the time when I see that it's Ghostface I lose motivation to finish that match and give up. Kind of like a lot of survivors do when I'm playing solo and it's a killer they don't like.
---
Either way thanks for reading this and please don't be too mean if you feel the need to comment. It's just my opinions on a killer. Could totally use some advice or tips if you have any to make playing against him more fun
---
Anybody got a link to what these cosmetics will look like
---
Doesn't distortion counter iron maiden? My point is there is a counter to BBQ which you implied didn't exist.
---
[removed]
---
Yea, I was agreeing but some ppl see a person agreeing or summ (I know this by experience) and just start downvoting, and I’m like “bruh I was agreeing” and they r like “no u r complaining” so that’s why I now specify that kind of stuff
---
I’d kill for more Freddy skins. My boy needs them.
---
The last perk is kinda OP
---
Distortion doesn't counter iron maiden because Iron maiden isn't an aura
---
This is a troll right?
---
Bbq on demo. Use shred mostly and teleport often. Watch the BloodPoints come in
---
Enduring IV.
---
HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT BABY DWEET LIKE THIS!!!
---
I literally thought about this yesterday
---
Ah, my bad I don't run it. But it would directly counter BBQ as well instead of lockers.
---
I don't think some countries want to have kids killing adults. Not everyone is America in terms of violence.
---
Leatherface definitely murders hooks, it's frankly where he shines the most at due to his power being an AoE instadown, but I personally don't enjoy having to play like that.
---
Obviously wraith is the strongest killer, like, do you see how fast he can go, even faster than hillbilly with death and doom engravings
---
that would be fucking scary just seeing that approach you silently
---
True.
---
Yeah, I run no add-ons for the most part. I use the chainsaw for sniping (thank you, BBQ), pressure, or if I’m way behind in a chase. 
---
For a pallet, almost never really find it helpful.
---
Nah, just learn to counter loop or leave them and not waste your time. Catch em later.
---
Yes, I aggree that bbq is definetly counterable, it was my mistake if I implied there wasn't one.
---
It's arguably one of the best survivor perks. I'd get it.
---
yes this is perfect accurate and correct, most definitely
---
Give survivors another objective.
---
Mad Grit is a clutch perk?
---
also its a 4 v 1, there is a reason why survivors run 2nd chance perks.. so they can survive
---
its the same as why killers use ruin and BBQ, because it slows the game down and gives the killer information about survivor locations. Knowing is half of the match
---
Thank you, for the tip
---
Dude clown should be a-tier because of his belly jiggle makes him seem faster also nice bait and catch
---
either you get them all or you leave a really obvious one right in the middle of the map so anyone can get it at the end.
---
Yeah but with infantry belt you carry 3 instadowns
---
I would upvote twice if I could.
---
And Entity forbid they have some new animated menu (snow theme, hallowed blight, looking at you)
---
He needs a sunglasses cosmetic and it would take them literally fifteen seconds to make.
---
I was rank 16 and they didn't all immediately disconnect, they disconnected one by one. I got some chases on and like 2 hooks before I mori'd the first Claudette, then they started dcing.
---
I hate it when a survivor doesn't understand that I'm trying to give them hatch. When I hit a tree or other object, it means stop wiggling. When I hit a hook and don't hook you, it means stop wiggling. When I pass by a hook and don't hook you, it means stop wiggling. I'm not going to give you hatch if you wiggle free, and I'm not going to let you wiggle free in the first place. Just sit there and accept your fate or end up dying anyway.
---
Nice try, but I'm no deviant
---
Thanks for the tip i appreciate you.
---
What would he even do? We already have nurse, and he’s too tall.
---
You would still be able to catch up to people trying to make distance and deal with loops, you still have a base phasewalk movement speed of 176%. It would be a trash add-on but you could use it to farm points on rank reset.
---
It so accurately mimics the mindset of a rank 20, it’s hard to differentiate between a shit post and a shit player
---
was this in a public match? if so. uh oh
---
Really Chaos u were supposed to put the video
---
I see how this works... if we upvote, you get free karma, if we downvote, you are right.
---
Here's a good tip for chasing, get right up to them and do just a quick hit because if you face the general direction it will auto lock on them
---
Waiting for their friend healing going to body block the killer etc
---
Someone’s never played Odd Egg Surveillance Demogorgon. See a gen turn yellow? Tunnel time.
---
Pair it with the right perks, but as someone who got head on’d about 3 times today playing demo gorgon, I understand that it’s really good against killers and situations when you know they are coming.
---
So example with me playing the demo, I would use my portal to get to a gen that was obviously being done, so that gives you A LOT of time to prepare with that killer, so she hopped in a locker, I searched around and she rammed right into me! So if you know the killer is coming there is not a lot they can do
---
As a PS4 player, I can confirm
---
Do you know when we will get double blood points on PS4  in the USA?
---
Exactly, the hit boxes aren’t too big, they plan to make them bigger
---
That killer has dogshit internet, or you do lmao. Yikes.
---
Instead it’s a Behavior dev standing over you, nerfing the pig again
---
I agree, we need something different.
---
I've been playing a lot of Leather face recently to get his perks and that just doesn't sound fun to me.
---
According to the wiki and I believe a tweet the double BP is the 26-30
---
Don't do that, it can be interpreted as "lol look at you even if you downed me I would still win"
---
EVER SINCE THE SWF NOT KICKING YOU OUT OF THE PARTY ANYMORE THERE HAVE BEEN 400% MORE SWF TEAMS, AND IF YOU DIDN'T FUCKING KNOW SWF IS BROKEN AND SHOULD HAVE A DEBUFF PENALTY TO LITERALLY ANYTHING DEPENDING ON HOW MANY FUCKS ARE IN THE SAME TEAM. HOW ABOUT YOU STOP BEING A VIRGIN BY TEABAGGING THE KILLER FOR PLAYING NORMALLY WHILE YOU DEGENERATES CHEAT AND BREAK THE GAME BY USING 3RD PARTY SOFTWARE TO GAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE IMPOSSIBLE UNLESS EQUIPPED WITH THE RIGHT PERKS WHICH IS THE DEFINITION OF CHEATING! AND INSTEAD OF HAVING INFORMATION PERKS, TEAMS JUST PUT IN PERKS THAT HELP IN A CHASE LIKE BITCHASS DEADHARD TRYHARDS AND HEAL EACHOTHER INSTANTLY, DO GENS INSTANTLY, INSTANTLY FIND RUIN, INSTANTLY "RUIN" THE GAME. WINNING AGAINST A SWF ISN'T EVEN FUN ANYWAYS BECAUSE OF HOW ANNOYING THE GAME ITSELF IS GOING. HOW ABOUT YOU SWF PUSSIES MAN UP AND PLAY THE GAME THE WAY THE WAY IT'S MEANT TO BE PLAYED, BY YOURSELF, UNBEKNOWNST OF EVERYTHING, YOU DROOLING, COCKEYED, MISSING TEETH LOOKING, DILDO SITTING, NOSE PICKING, BUSH HIDING, FLASHLIGHT CLICKING, DIRT LICKING, TOILET DRINKING, PET TARANTULA OWNING, BROWN TOOTSIE ROLL LIKING TROGLODYTES!
---
When I do that I msg them and make sure they know I meant good
---
Bruh bruh bruh moment
---
Isn't he more powerful than the entity in most web series adaptations?
---
I ran Mad Grit on the Demogorgon once and got an easy 4k because the Survivors all gathered at the hook of their friend who did an Insta Heal in front of me  and I still downed them before they got to the gate hooked them and they tried to save them knocked out one injured guy and then plowed through the rest with Mad Grit and got called out for it lmao.
---
(everyone else ignore this comment)

(psst, use landscape)
---
i bought her, myers, and ghostface 2 days ago
---
If huntress had a cosmetics that let her throw those big ass, skyrim-looking-ass greataxes like the ones here, I'd main her in a heart beat.
---
Yeah you’re a fucking troll, a 2 year old, or a low rank idiot. Holy shit
---
Very aware, but was replying as an idea to the above :P
---
honestly really curious how much karma he lost from this
---
Then they’re just kinda stupif
---
Is that what's going on? Been taking about five to ten minutes to find a game on pc today
---
BRO DO YOU EVEN PLAY THE GAME LMAO ITS THE NEW KILLER AHHAHHA
---
Incase you can't tell from the video. Second Wind didn't activate because there was a sliver of healing left required.
---
How dare survivors not play by killer rules and run shit perks so they can get an easy 4k
---
Pic or it didnt happen
---
I have seen Leatherfaces at the start of the go straight to the basement to catch survivors going for the chest and then camp them to catch more. I was once the only survivor to get out because of that.
---
Git gud lmao 
---
/s
---
Iron Maiden should let you see their aura for a short duration, so you can actually find them and kill them. It wouldn't be too broken because survivors could just circumvent it by not hiding in lockers.
---
It feels like a 50/50 when trying to hit a survivor after they vault out of the window, without any **noticeable** lag involved. I'm willing to bet it is indeed a very minor lag, probably the difference between a yellow and green connection.
---
I hope rng helps you in that regard from the shrine. I got BBQ that way then got clown with shards and bought spirit and ghostface at the same time.
---
You're fishing with prime bait and you are doing good
---
D-disrespect? Are you serious? Dwight is such a good boi that he transcended the boi list and was only second to the cutie with a bootie. Also why do you think nea is at the bottom of ew.
---
Fair enough i suppose, but if they're healing to go save a friend that means the killer probably isn't around. I'm not saying the effect will last forever, just while in that area. It's used for trolling about 95% of the time, i think at least something small should be added to help the killer.
---
I mean, my flair is because during Howling Grounds I mained Wraith. Guess which fucks always blinded me?

Just got out of jail eh?
---
&gt; These survivors may very well be acting this way because every killer they've gone against in the night is as toxic as they're being. 
---
Bad comparison. The survivors are teabagging this guy, not using a legit gameplay mechanic. But the survivors call it "toxic" when killers simply use a strong character, i.e. Nurse, Spirit or Hillbilly. Or they call it "camping" when the killer sees them swarm the hook. In the end, there's no satisfying them. And it's not the killer's fault that gens can get done too fast for most of the characters to be viable.
---
Hex ruin adds like 20 seconds avg. Its pretty lame if survivors just push through it, the reason it works is because people waste time searching for it which adds risks and a lot of the time its wasting 2+ people time.
---
If they slow the game to compensate for ruin being removed then low rank survivors will get pounded, if they don't and rework the perk high rank survivors will pound killers (tbh they already do but high rank killers can get their emblems other ways)
---
If you would like to call it that yes.
---
Yes, me too! Glad, I'm not the only one with Premature E... ohhh, nevermind 😯
---
I just have endless killer dailies. Forever. Complete them, trash them, the same ones keep cycling through. I am a trash killer.
---
It's annoying and repetitive???? At least make the chase interesting by moving to a different spot.
---
cursed seal sounds amazing
---
That's not even a year.
---
EZ
---
That's kinda toxic, you should've just let him kill you
---
if a killer afks or is that bad and doesn't injure anyone then hehe sorry bad benevolent emblem
---
That's the game unfortunately. You're at the mercy of if the killer has shit internet or not.
---
No one ever uses actual hatchets for memery, so don't feel too bad. I just like to talk shit.
---
The title is a joke about the MIT guy having bad handwriting who gave them the manual on how to do everything, which is why she fucks up and hits the flamethrower instead of the rockets. The meme is because she messed up hit the wrong thing in panic wile X keeps yelling to hit it.
---
I understand the reason though since sometimes killers will mori them or close the hatch on them. Usually they wiggle to 99% and then wiggle off when the killer approaches the hatch.
---
Survivor gets the hatch and prevents getting bm'd at the end. Everyone wins.
---
dwight ez
---
Tenacity so it still feels good while being a slug
---
The wraith would be as good as spirit if the speed boost he got after uncloaking wasn't negated by the drop in speed from uncloaking.
---
Who thought it would be useful for him to speed up for *one second* after a two second slowdown?
---
There were quite a few injures though... and I healed them.
---
I miss the days when freddy was F. Good memes
---
Ah, I see, thank you.
---
What does console optimization mean?
---
And in the movies Freddy is more of a goof than scary in my opinion
---

---

I like clarifying a bit to much :P no worries.

Don't get me wrong, it is a bit better, but it's still a bunch of rng slot.machine horse shit.

Or you could make it more lore related by making a "rage" where you (the killer) increase terror radius and redstain...

It doesn't work for everyone. But for most people it works. Myself, and  All my friends (10 or so) have reverted their game's back to the original state and it looks like it was before the last patch.. I can confirm that this works for most people and it's worth a shot. Sorry to hear that your one of the people it doesn't work for. Good luck on fixing it.

On top of that, I hope his sleeves roll back down when he’s washing his hands

Congrats!

BRO ME AND MY FRIEND WAITED 10 MINUTES FOR TO LOOK FOR A MATCH  AND ONLY ONE OF US GOT IN THE LOBBY AND THE OTHER ONE WAS STILL IN QUEUE
---
There are not enough killers to go around.
---
“sorry the killer chased us out”
---
That’s awesome, nice work!
---
For him being too tall: Whenever he steps through windows, he can kinda hunch over and bend his head down. A bit of a new animation
---
*Sigh* my race is dying out
---
Basically, C and D tier list killers are the worst. By this I mean that if you go against a good survivor team, you’ll probably lose. 
---
A and B tier killers are good, and you have a fairly good chance of beating a good survivor team, but you’ll probably lose against a great survivor team. 
---
SS and S killers are the best if you practice with them. You have a strong chance of beating a great survivor team.
---
Yeah, but what about picking up survivors and hooking them, wouldn’t that look kind of silly?
---
I miss when legion was s
---
This community is great as everyone has opinions and its great to add my input to help those or even make some laugh.
---
SAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLT with your fries?

Man, I would buy this game seven more times if they pulled this off.  Sadly, I think the IP is still in copyright hell at the moment.

Youve clearly never watched Otz if you think trapper is bad

*”I like your hair. Want to die?”*

She is and isn’t fair , in high ranks any mouse one killer gets shit on but in low ranks no one knows how to counter her , her beads add ons can be red and her blood seeing can be  purple but overall she’s balanced . You just need to learn how to play against her . You may
---
Say she’s unfair now but if u play trapper or clown in red ranks you’ll barely get anywhere against good player who can loop really good

I mean, TO BE FAIR, a lot of survivors at least let you hit them when they teabag which means extra BP for the killer.
---
Which jadon we talkin part 3? Or would there be skins for the other movies :o
---
Nah man.  You're objective is secondary to making sure survivors feel good about themselves
---
Dead hard is probably a better perk than Sprint burst but it definitely doesn't make you a bad surviver.
---
The memes on this sub are terrible
---
Nurse can be pretty fun to play with, it's pretty cool when you land a perfect blink, or do a 360 swing to try and hit whoever you just saw, like you said, HUGE learning curve, and also HUGE differences too, on PC you can move your mouse to your heart's content, but with a controller stick, your movement is pretty limited, making it harder to play with her, the whole "stun" had to exist to make her a "LITTLE" balanced to verse, but just a little bit...
---
Hmm looks legit very cool!
---
I personally use lithe over sprint burst, but I just needed whatever perk to fill the meme in. And I perfectly understand that WoO is bad. I'm just garbage at the game haha.
---
Exactly what I was thinking.
---
I was also making a joke, too bad I damaged your ego
---
Hmm well you wouldn't have to play like that just only if they leave u no choice like unhooking without giving you a chance to leave. 
---
Hey can i recommend you watching some recent leatherface matches by fungoose on YouTube? You will see what i mean like thats how you should play leatherface its so smart and deadly.
---
Thx take this 🏅🏅🏅
---
Skate 4 confirmed
---
Slenderman would be pretty sick, and it would be interesting to see how they integrate his power into the game.
---
I like “The Slasher” as the name. I also thought about “The Curse”
---
I would hope so but from everything I’ve seen on the PTB when people were playing it, it hasn’t fixed it (or correct me if I’m wrong and it might just be that the lag from the killer is affecting it making it look like hitboxes are the problem?)
---
Used a splinter earlier to try out Michael for the first time and only got 1 kill and the whole team was tea bagging me every chance they got. How can they be that proud of beating a no-perk baby Michael?
---
Much better thank you leave this community better then when you entered it!
---
Pointing and beckoning at the killer is ok right? 
---
You are the best / Come join the fun. 
---
I never teabag (other than hello to other survivors) So many players drop and palette and teabag. They also DC after they are knocked down.
---
Yep
---
Devs r too busy spending that  dlc money
---
You’ll main will be buffed and balanced... eventually
---
Didn’t realise  Tony Hawk was already added to this game
---
r/uselessnobody
---
None of them.
---
Has nothing to do with consoles. There are games with 100x better graphics with snow, lots of moving objects, etc. that run smooth as hell on console. Yet jpeg Gens and ground with barely any texture causes major lag. Yeah that's not on the console, that's on the shitty game optimization.
---
Usually doing the objectives, today felt different decided to be a hero since the whole lone wolf playstyle was screwing me over more than it helped.
---
1st match saves both the Dwight and Quentin as the wraith was tunneling me, got put into a dying state but not carried so I crawled to the corner of the map behind a tree thinking I'm gonna bleed to death when this Quentin decided to pick my sorry ass up so I returned the favor by healing him.
---
Both of them died 3 minutes later, luckily for me the hatch was close bye for an easy escape.
---
2nd match a lot of back and fourth, done some heroic shit to keep my random team alive from the roaming HillyBilly couldn't save everyone as 1 of our dudes got sacrificed but the other 3 manage to get the generators done then we proceed to the west exit gate had the fucking thing at 80% before getting hit by the chainsaw charge.
---
Got hooked but my team came back and saved me even managing to get the gate open for me while the other 2 acted like rodeo clowns for the HillyBilly.
---
Can’t wait for the new chapter with Tony Hawk as the survivor and Eric Sparrow as the killer.
---
Or go with underground 2 and give us Bam as the killer
---
That’s a new one. I will be cursing people with this plague for years to come.
---
Fav skin seaside psycho 
---
Add plague doctor/WW2 plague skin or better clown outfits
---
I can confirm I've been in that situation as the killer although I'm shit at Spirit and Nurse and usually too tilted to even focus as other killers. 
---
For me, it's 3-gen doc or Red Paint Brush + Swing Chains Freddy. (RIP Old Red Paint Brush, you will be sorely missed.)
---
That’s enduring requiem
---
How's about "The Mamma's Boy"
---
I always do this even if they have noed, blood warden mori, etc.
---
Well I wouldn't say call First Class was a reboot. They still made The Wolverine, X-Men Days of Future Past and Logan afterwards.
---
Yeah, also, I'm oblivious as fuck when it comes to seeing survivors, so when they click the flashlight I know there is another one
---
The art is from Mortal Kombat X, but it kinda looks like it could be in dbd.
---
What are you considering as a win??? Cos I don’t think killers should be getting 4ks 70-80% of games.
---
You need to explain this better
---
Lucky you lol
---
What do you want changed? It’s a full heal. She was injured and slightly healed when you started. It’s the perk. 
---
Should adrenaline pop when the last gen is 90%? I would love that in a lot of matches, but it isn’t how the perk is supposed to work.
---
mhmm.  You want to just chill and use a fun/different build?  Go against a spirit/nurse/camper/tunneler.  Run meta perks?  just a killer trying to have a chill game.
---
You don't understand how many times walking to hatch leads to BM, killers are mean also, not just survivors, people seem to strangely take pleasure from merely causing other pain.
---
It honestly depends on the rankings, if it's a mixed rank group then yeah in some regard but if it's a group of red ranks then it's not really going to make a difference... except queue times... ._.
---
wow
---
Something similar happens in DBD sort of. Kicking pallets or spamming your ability for deviousness if it's someone like Hag, Freddy, Trapper, etc.
---
Plague is A tier when people cure themselves. This is assuming you are going against a team of survivors who know what they are doing. In which case, they won’t cure themselves. Otherwise, she’s just an M1 killer. Sure, she can one hit down survivors, but it takes a while to get them all sick.
---
Myers is at the top of the B rank with Ghostface. Basically, I’m trying to say that they are almost A tier, but different reasons keep them down. In Myers’ case, his low mobility and low map control prevents him from being A tier imo.
---
Freddy is a lot better than people give him credit for. He has great map control, has an ability that helps him end chases (his snares), and can do a lot of mind games. At the very least he’s at the top of the A rank, but I see a lot of potential in him.

I had a team of Claudette players in a swf last night with brand new parts. Map was Autohavens and I was a Hillbilly. First chainsaw was the ender for the game. They stayed near the hook, rescued way too early and they tea-bagged at every pallet. Stupidity to do this with a Billy who has a charge add-on is high. Match ended in 5 minutes with no messages. I swear these people are as intelligent as Ochido.
---
As a legion main I can check the records and hmmm
---
Mmmmhmmmm. Yes a legion was dispatched to deal with these survivors at this time.
---
Back in my day the only SWF was Kill your Friends, so I'd say it's a buff from 2 years ago.
---
I don’t think it’s aids, probably some digestive disease
---
bruh 2 seconds xD wtf
---
I want to go full Lakeshore Strangler on the person playing as Ash. Not only because they’re a dickhead but because they’re using my boy while being such a dickhead.
---
wat
---
Nothing in my last comment puts any words in your mouth. It points out base issues with your response, without referring to anything you said.
---
Now it has a ranking system complimentary to every other competitive game. I think they should create a non-ranked casual queue, but I’m very happy with the changes, and I’m a survivor main.
---
She’s my main 😍
---
I’m not good at using discord but there is both a switch discord and general discord for the game! Also enjoy the low ranks and take the time to learn the basics as you will get better people will get a LOT better so enjoy the learning stages!
---
Thank you so much! I will definitely check out that Discord. Have a great night!
---
You’re too late, bud.
---
I hate how demogorgon moves and I guess they need for slenderman to move but he should teleport...
---
Ultimately, you would have died whether or not he was able to carry you to the basement. There's not really a good reason for killers to hook the last survivor in the basement, so what happened to you was just odd. You did the right thing by not struggling even though you ended up dying anyway.
---
Play both sides. It will give you a feel for how both play, and how to play against both.
---
Play the tutorials and then try both killing and surviving to get a feel for which you prefer. Survivors are mostly the same except for their special perks (which you can get on the other survivors as well), but different killers will give you vastly different experiences. 
---
Find one you like and dump your blood points in them only after you’re thinking of sticking with them for a while. Beyond that it gets less general...but if you have any specific questions, keep asking!
---
Ask yourself why am i losing. Are you chasing survivors for too long? Is it hard for you to pressure generators? Maybe finding survivors can be challenging?
---
I know I'm going to give a generic answer but it really is up to you. Your current load out that you have above in my opinion is good! You have something to slow down gens, apply pressure during a chase and a perk to help track them afterwards :)
---
The two things i would change (again its up to you) are:
---
1. Deerstalker is a great perk, but it depends on you as a person and how you play. If you often leave people lying on the ground for a medium to long period of time to chase other survivors or check generators and you have trouble finding them when you come back to pick them up, deerstalker is a very good perk. However, if you usually pick them up fairly quickly, I would then just ditch it and replace it with a perk you feel could help you in an area that you lack.
---
2. This is up to you so i cant offer to much advice but again, look at how you play and maybe devote a perk slot to something that would help you in an area you may feel you aren't the best at.
---
I know i repeated myself a lot there but hopefully I was even able to help you improve a little bit :) Good luck!
---
It’s totally up to you. 
---
Personally, I break all pallets right away unless they’re “unsafe” or only create a short loop for the survivor, such as many of them on the new map. In these cases, it can be mindgamed fairly easily for that second hit, as long as the survivor doesn’t abandon it. Once they are down, I’ll break it, but that’s just me. 
---
It just depends on your and the survivors’ playstyles, as well as the killer you play. Many killers (like Trapper, Hag, Doctor, Huntress, etc) May be able to bait survivors into a dangerous pallet situation, using their power. With Hatchets, traps, and mindgames, a loop can sometimes become more of an advantage for the killer than the survivor. 
---
Oh, and if you’re a nurse, you should never really bother breaking pallets other than for points.
---
I don't care for it.  It's kinda a waste but I'm fine with it if you don't run say Ruin.  
---
Wouldn't kick it out of bed, wouldn't invite it in first though.
---
PLAG
---
Tony Hawk survivor confirmed?
---
Pretty decent, but I’d swap out Monitor. Phase walking lets you get the jump on survivors anyway so there’s not as big of a need to lower your terror radius
---
And until then, this is the best solution
---
Wow, this is the nicest post ever.
---
I'm not very good, like... at all, but I've been patient enough (except for when I didn't play for a year lol) to have prestiged a character and hit level 55 - I havent yet said "fuck this" because I changed my mindset from "goal = escape" to "goal = not die quite so soon."
---
Do generators, and if you unhook someone at a bad time, take the hit for them.
---
I'm a big fan of urban evasion.
---
I have no advice for being a killer.
---
Have fun!
---
I did the tutorials today! I like the Killer, but I've heard you can get banned for playing as them too much, and it’s hard to find a match on the Switch version. Thank you for being so nice!
---
DIPSHIT KILLERS WHO PLAY BORING, UNFUN MANNERS THAT GET GRUMPY IN POSTGAME FOR NOT GETTING ENOUGH POINTS BECAUSE THE SURVIVORS JUST GAVE UP AND DECIDED TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT MATCH PISS ME OFF.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
ALSO TRYHARD FUCKERS WHO TUNNEL AND THEN GET MAD AT YOU IN POSTGAME FOR CALLING THEM OUT LIKE THEY SHOULDN'T FEEL ASHAMED FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO PLAY A GAME IN A WAY THAT'S FUN FOR SURVIVORS.
---
I'VE DONE EQUAL AMOUNTS OF SURVIVOR AND KILLER AND PRIDE MYSELF ON ALWAYS BEING FUN.
---
This is fair. I have gotten hatch bm'd before multiple times so wiggling is natural instinct. If they intend on giving me the hatch, I would of course stop.
---
/r/uselessnobody
---
Okay then let me rephrase I meant top level play
---
Why tho?
---
M&amp;A might make Spirit worse because that's less Terror Radius to hide your Phasing
---
Cry cry cry
---
Ah yes uber jason would be dope
---
Thank you so much! I played as Steve Harrington from the Stranger Things DLC, and I was having trouble escaping from the hook. I will have to work on that. Thank you! Have a great night!
---
Why would a killer complain about free hits?
---
Ruin attacking as killer. No reason the killer can hit me and I can’t hit back.
---
I’ve never been one for deranking, but it’s my only choice if I want to teach my new friends how to play. I can’t teach them what to do or expect them to get better when they die 6 seconds into a game.
---
But we already have Claudette and she kinda looks like Clem lol
---
Thank you! I have tried both, and so far I am really enjoying being the killer, even though it’s hard to find a match.
---
Yes.
---
Every time I give a yellow rank a chance they dc for any stupid reason.
---
I’m crying rn. This is amazing
---
No.
---
He does not belong here
---
It’s to prevent blood warden from activating
---
80% of the time lmao
---
Wrong side
---
Clem may have been in the series longer, but who do you think would come to people’s minds more often? Also, I love the idea of possibly whenever Lee heals two survivors, the next hit that would put him into the dying state is instead put into the deep wound state, and he has xx/xx/xx seconds to mend
---
Source? I see nothing on /r/LeaksByDaylight.
---
What why?
---
So basically you had no comeback so you just said the same thing again? Lol.

---
wasn't this posted a few weeks ago but with more effort? Like the other one had dbd music in it and everything, this is just a clip.
---
thats what i ment, was bullied badily in a game and then out of nowhere everyone died to the end game timer
---
Mofo, i saw it online and posted about it. TF am I gonna be on a search to credit someone. Thank you very fking much!
---
Yes. It's way smoother imo.
---
I would swap out make your choice for ruin to slow the game down
---
Currently end game timer is glitched where it doesn’t show correct time
---
You guys seriously want this joke character in? People think he's scary?
---
That's like getting upset when everyone runs away when you show up to a gang knife fight with an M16
---
Why
---
Maybe after healing someone, he doesn't go down if it's a protection hit, but instead gets the deep wounds effect.
---
A true hero
---
Haha he really did hit the nail on the head, never thought about it like that
---
Im on the other end, Im a rank 7, the 3 other survivors were ranks 8, 15, and 18. Forget the rank of the killer tho
---
Monitor isnt doing you too many favors, you can swap this for a more tuned perk for your playstyle!
---
That's quite an accurate description
---
Cringe
---
I don’t play on Switch, but that sounds like a BIG lie lol. I play killer almost exclusively, don’t listen to that. 
---
If you like killing - give them a try and see which suits you best. Maybe avoid Nurse, she has a really high ceiling and will be miserable to use if you’re not good with her (she is maybe the best when used correctly, though). Trapper is a solid one to try, Billy too (and he has a high ceiling too). I main Billy so I can give you tips there more so than other killers that I’m not as apt at.
---
I would have to uninstall due to my nightmares in middle school flashbacks coming back 
---
(Though I bet they’d be pretty cool, imagine not having a weapon and you get hurt over time by looking at them)
---
Wtf are you talking about?
---
I don't talk to people to use "comebacks." That mindset of yours just shows how immature you are.
---
I feel like these people have somehow optimized their brains to not even CONSIDER the circumstances. They are winning, therefore they are powerful, therefore they are good, and they want to revel in it by bullying as much as possible. Doesn't matter how one-sided the match was.
---
I get BMed every game as a Wraith. As though beating a Wraith is anything to be proud of.
---
Thanks for the tip! I’m actually hoping Surveillance pops up in my bloodweb, since I think Surveillance can benefit me.
---
Killers must be banging out to some tunes
---
Yeah, I only recently saw the lore of the killers and found it funny how they explain everything except his main mechanic \[and the mask I guess\]
---
Yeah whenever a survivor dies on 1st hook in early game i get a bit upset cuz that makes the game take a lot less time, so less time to play.
---
Aww think of like a infected perk that when your downed  and about to bleed out you can bite the killer to stun them and then you get healed to injured and can run away
---
It comes off as a very ESL ATTEMPT at being Very Smart.
---
Every damn time
---
This sounds like a roundabout way of saying "Don't hold the devs to their word"...
---
Like really, I do all of what you've listed here and yet I still want the dedicated servers sooner than they seem to mean. I've bought every DLC character whether I actually liked the particular character because I actually like this game more than any of the others I play despite it not being what I play most and would like to support it as such. I have participated in all of the PTBs since The Spirit, too. So maybe its time you stop clutching those pearls and admit the entire summer has passed without the servers being implemented or them at least giving a meaningful update on the situation. I could see this reaction early on but now its just unsightly.
---
I'm not sure what put you in such a state to be making such assumptions without a logical reason but I hope you get that worked out.
---
Thank you for the reply! I tried out the Demogorgon today, and he was pretty cool. I still haven’t gotten a hang of the portals yet though. People have told me that nurses on PC are all really good. I also really like the look of Trapper. I will try him out tomorrow. Thank you!
---
Yea
---
It's a lot easier to stand there and NOT teabag for that. I give the hit, too, but never teabag Killers.

---
Make teabagging inside the gates spawn a Trapper trap on them.
---
Will probs get downvoted for this but here goes, teabagging isn't necessarily being toxic, same way saying to someone in a game "get shit on" isn't toxic, its more like shit talking, in DBD especially where you cant talk to people until the game is over, a survivor can never be as "toxic" in game as they can out of game, it takes a real weak will to see someone teabagging and immediately think omg what a toxic asshole, I tend to see it as more of a challenge to the killer, if I chase them down for 3 gens and do poorly in that game, I failed the challenge, equally if they get downed quickly, they'll look like a fool to me and themselves
---
Could implement a bit of Doctor, and create illusions that also fill the meter.

I love it when they are injured and on death hook and they still tbag. Like what are you trying to do? Celebrate your own death?

Gonna have to disagree there is still some good frame drops and the obvious graphical issues. I play on an x as well

Yeah but with BL i never get that fantastic moment where i SB, it ends, and adren procs straight afterwards to give me another speed boost.

honestly pigs ambush should be able to fast vault things with demo it made sense considering his ability is called shred but vaulting would really work with ambush it would be a great way to surprise people

You lose the argument so you use the same reply over and over again. Real mature, yep. Wrong!

But that's not the case, though, lol. I said, you didn't have a comeback. As in an actual reply to my counter point. That has nothing to do with immature insults but good try.

I still think it’d look kinda silly to have someone hanging over his shoulder that is too thin to carry someone over.

“Similar but different enough” -BHRV Probably.
---
It would 100% be "The Operator" and not "The Slender" but i'd love this honestly
---
It might happen. Just gonna take like 3 years if they game is still alive at that point.
---
IMO I’m not a big fan of Ruin. It’s very hit-or-miss for me. I’m hoping Surveillance pops up in bloodweb, since I have Piggy at lvl 43.
---
If Sans can get in Smash, then Slenderman can get in Dead By Daylight !
---
NOED (No one escapes death) is pretty good too!
---
Damn dude getting hard downvoted because people here are Babyragers, even Otz the new god of this sub has stated "dont let it get to you" but people cant actually take on board good advice it seems
---
this is right below that post of a dev saying a rad skateboarding killer would be cool
---
We need this so bad lol
---
I agree. Far more map pressure having them on the ground near the hooked survivor as opposed to bailing on the hook to hook the slug.
---

New Tony Hawk game with DBD survivor customization is the real reason.

You can run add-ons with Freddy that prevent seeing him when he teleports to gens (plus the fun add-on when all gens produce blood at the same time for a real mind fuck). One of my favorite to use when a 4 stack SWF drop in. Try that out and tell me you wont finish the match with a smirk lol.
---
That is why i play basement bubba and pepole write me because i camp lmfao
---
I think something along the lines of Hag would be interesting. If he gets close enough while in a similar to state as ghostface's stealth he can trigger an ability that forces the survivor to stare at him and trigger some other possible affects.
---
Give one reason not to 99 when the situation calls for it
---
...i own pig and still haven’t done this...
---
Still new to the game. What's tombstone?
---
was an old event flashlight
---
really? thought it was super easy and it's fun to use too.
---
are these memes coming back again? ~~I thought the Wraith + Invisible C*nt combo was addressed as overdone the other day here on the subreddit~~
---
I take it you said the same thing when Ghostface was really wanted? Yes, Slenderman is scarier than him to most. So your opinion, man.
---
The actions of some dumb kids should restrict the incorporation of a popular horror icon in media? I'm sure the people who continue making games with Slender and even the 2018 movie are crying from shame from poor taste, right? C'mon man, you know better.
---
*spiderman pointing at spiderman meme*
---
Oh, that.
---
The Best Friends had a disastrous/fun couple of runs before they broke up.
---
An amazing one at that too
---
Because your gameplay quite literally shows that they upset you because you reacted the way they wanted you to??
---
IF YOU’RE GOING TO FORFEIT WITH A KEY JUST DC AT THE START AND DON’T WASTE MY TIME.
---
I would honestly be down. I’ve always liked the slender man  game. It was when the internet began shaping its culture. Unfortunately, they kinda ruined him. But maybe dead by daylight could make him relevant again
---
That’s a nice watch bro
---
i know, but they’re locked for me in kyf
---
And I thought two killers was bad. Yikes
---
Can’t lie that one did run through my mind haha
---
Whatever, there is no reason to downvote someone for agreeing, I’ll just stop commenting
---
Why’s this getting mass downvoted, but “fix matchmaking’ for the 36th time in a day goes positive, this isn’t even a bad meme lmao
---
If we are talking add-ons then basically every killer is S Tier+. I assumed we weren’t using add ins or items.
---
Likely it was a build paid for by a fan, a lot of streamers are doing this now,  for $10 they'll play exactly what build you tell them to play. Don't be a douchebag.
---
Give them slender sickness lol
---
It’s fucking awful. And it’s incredible it took them this long to do it
---
YIKES! They literally just finished explaining how it's not an issue with consoles but how the game is clearly poorly optimized, then you disregard the entire post and act like a dick. Yet, they're the "immature" one.
---
Ghostface is cool and actually scary, being an aggressive person who loves to murder. The lore they did for him in DbD is really fuckin' good too.
---
Slenderman isn't scary because it's a shitty Somethingawful post that people decided to try really hard to be scared by.
---
consider this: your skill level is below average and good killers actually consider this normal gameplay
---
Yeah join the dbd discord...everybody is friendly and helping each other out...they are sharing friend codes and doing custom matches to learn the game together.
---
they should really just add two-killer game mode
---
100% yes. Much smoother and a much better killer experience, you’ll have to start the bloodpoints grind again but that’s not horrible.
---
r/unexpectedtf2
---
A murderer who specifically goes out of his way to show as much of himself on security footage and brazenly takes photos of himself with his dying victims, then goes out of his way to write his own articles about himself in the news is pretty disturbing and interesting, yeah.
---
But but I have to be mean to people worse than me!!!
---
Having a smaller terror radius is worse if you aren’t using a gen grab build, swap it out for Ruin or Corrupt.
---
You probably don't know who you are talking about... this man is an angel.
---
1. There is no situation where you should 99 a gate and leave it.
---
2. I did. If someone is in a chase, the killer gets a free hit on them if they have to open the 99ed gate.
---
Can't relate :/
---
bold of you to assume I can do really easy things
---
Now that I notice, there are a couple DLCs missing on the switch version. We don't have quentin nor freddy, neither leatherface. I haven't been able to find remember me on any of my killers' bloodwebs. But I will take a screenshot and reply with it if I ever find it
---
...who is this?
---
Frankly it'd be nice if moris didn't exist at all.
---
It’s in the game but with a different icon, please please post a picture if you see remember me or fired up
---
Strange how they decided it was strong enough to be a ultra rare, then went back and were like "nah just make it part of his base kit". Not saying I agree with it being a ultra rare because it definitely wasn't. I really like what they replaced it with though.
---
1000 blood points for destroying totems though...
---
I was carrying Bill to a hatch when two of his teammates dc’d and the other was killed. He wiggled off and blinded me with his light, so I went to the hatch and closed it in his face, afterwards I moried him.
---
I know which is why he scares me more than any other streamer when he does get angry.
---
Just get better and stop expecting everyone to hand you victories on a silver platter
---
1. A lot of endgame situations and helped greatly by 99ing. Let's say someone gets hooked, you can try and save them with all the time you need because you havent started the timer. 
---
2. If someone's in a chase they get hit open the gate and they're out. You could also have a teammate body block etc.
---
Downvote for "nobody:"
---
For real, I like the idea of iron maiden but I think the expose status needs a real hard buff, maybe like 30 seconds, and then it may not even be worth to run because people could just see a survivor scream out of a locker and just think “oh this guy has Iron Maiden, guess I’m not gonna go into a locker”
---
Oh okay
---
A good killer will not down and pick up someone JUST hooked. Especially if there’s another injured person nearby. Also if your being chased by the killer it’s your job to be a good teammate and not loop the killer around the hook.
---
Keys are by far the fucking worst to find. Especially when a teammate steals it, then they get hit.
---
You can destroy it before it's active by destroying all 5 totems.
---
I’m really not wrong. Trolling more falls under behaviour like body blocking another survivor in a corner or throwing down all the pallets on the map etc etc. If you go and look and some of the live-streams or videos where the devs talk about survivor playstyle in the game one of the sentiments that’s often repeated is “playing survivor is suppose to be stressful because you don’t know if your teammates will play selfishly or help you” (paraphrased). Therefore leading the killer to someone to get them off of you really falls under that “selfish playstyle”. I don’t agree with people playing like that and it’s not nice but it’s absolutely not bannable.
---
Yeah, I've started to have a love and hate relationship with Clickers and overly altruistic flashlight Survs. Had a "Clicker" in a recent match (dude even had a macro so he could spam it more "efficiently" or whatever). He went near me and started clicking so I hit him, he went away, I went away, then I immediately returned and there he was, blindly running in my direction (I suppose he didn't thought that I was going to go back). He got downed and ragequit right then and there. He tried to make the game harder for me and just made it easier.
---
Regular people can do that even today. I highly disagree with a narcissist killer who admires his work and himself to be more interesting than an extradimensional creature who hides his true form just so he could feed off human victims' emotions.
---
Lmao same. Last time it happened to me I was running PWYF on Myers and my obsession was the clicky claudette following me around all game, giving me endless stacks the entire game. I made sure to thank him for feeding my speed all game afterwards. Then he wound up in my next match(same killer/build) and did literally the exact same thing then D/C'd when I downed him once.
---
Do bones?
---
He likes to do meme builds.
---
The copyright dispute for Friday the 13th is still on-going? That's the reason why the game Friday the 13th can't receive anymore content updates.

waiting
---
Yeah both issues are really constant for me. It's very annoying.
---
I blew air out of my nose with force
---
I hear a salty survivor main
---
It's a known bug. It desyncs and just stays paused for the survivors so they can randomly see it stay in one spot for a while then a massive chunk will disappear out of nowhere. I was wondering why so many people have been getting killed by the collapse lately, turns out it was this bug.
---
It's listed as a known bug in the patch notes. Why they still pushed it through is beyond me but it is known.
---
Iridescent saw would just be a straight downgrade if it didn't stop on survivors. It gives you no turning bonus meaning your basically gonna fuck off into the night while your downed survivor crawls away and everyone else jukes you.
---
In your mind how does “free down escape” not = crutch perk?
---
The weird thing is when I play killer I have no problems at all. I get to fill a lobby in about 30 seconds after I search a match and I’m in the game fine.
---
Have the original model. Same thing happens to me but it also happens with MK11 so it’s my PS4
---
That is the most wholesome thing I've ever read.
---
anyone know exactly when it will go live?
---
WORST THING IS DIDN'T UNLOCK ANY PERKS ON THE FIRST WEB
---
I’m going to send this to any teammates that do this for me after the game

and your forgetting one thing... nurse is incredible hard to play and learn so no she’s fine

Fantastic artwork!

I think "the deformed/disfigured" could work better than just slasher. Great art though
---
F. Green Map with add-on or Rainbow Map.
---
G. Detective's Hunch.
---
there is a reason I only play spirit and try hard Freddy once I get to purple and red ranks to punish idiots like this
---
Funny, that's the exact thing that happened to me :)
---
It cost me 2 games that I was the last one alive and wasn't able to time my actions soon enough.
---
I'll try your solution and edit this comment with my response.
---
Exactly. I don't even main killer, but 4k is easy to achieve in 75% of games, even red ranks, if you use your ears and have half a brain to mind game.
---
All survivors can hope to do is loop, and not mess up or get stuck on terrain. They are very underpowered to what they once were.
---
The problem with lots of killer mains is that they expect 4k every game. When that doesn't happen, they whine that the game is survivor sided. The same people who cry and get any decent survivor perk nerfed, while at the same time gleefully using iri heads, infinite ew3, ebony moris and other crutches. Hilarious.
---
That logic doesn't make much sense, if I complete every ruin skill check should I be able to walk out through the exit gate? Difficulty should not lead to capability if it's unfair.
---
Meanwhile, the Killer can see the timer progress, which is absurdly broken.
---
Oh they do act that way but then one of them ends up dying 1 inch from escaping! I FUCKING LOVE IT WHEN IT HAPPENS!!
---
Remember, unless there's a lot of luck in play, your chances of unhooking yourself are slim. I recommend not doing it unless you're over a quarter bar in and no one is near you. (Unless you're being camped terribly, then go for it lol)
---
He be looking extra juicy today
---
Why isn’t there an F tier for Legion?
---
I play on console and you can do normal 360's there as well, his ones were just bad sorry
---
Eeehh i don't really see it as rewarding bad killers. I see it more as an opportunity for a killer to make a comeback. Plus it takes up an entire perk slot that doesn't get utilized until the very end. A lot of killers already have a means of one shot anyways, so the killers that usually run it don't have one shots. It's pretty easy to counter it by getting bones. Even if playing with randoms, the 1000 blood points rewarded, incentivizes a lot of players to do the bones when spotted. This is especially true if the killer has hex ruin, so people will do the bones they come across when looking for it. If upon endgame the killer has NOED and downs a survivor, it understandable to not go for the save. Because, it's also that guys fault for not getting bones as well. Unless he got paired off with a bunch of chumps and ended up doing all the work, but that just happens sometimes. That's just my opinion on the way I see the perk.
---
Another reason why dedicated servers can’t come soon enough

---
Hey, here's an idea, instead of jumping to conclusions and assuming that he camped because he happened to be running a perk, how about you actually watch the video? I commented the link to it earlier, but here it is, in case your in a hurry: https://youtu.be/vhhpvy04ng8
---
So just wondering, what's the hole meme about Claudette hiding in the bushes? I'm a new player and have been using her exclusively and I run everywhere, I hardly ever Crouch walk.
---
Its console
---
I remember when there was a dbd tournament and it failed terribly because everyone played the nurse, no one stood a chance because when you take away perks and addons, nurse towers above everyone. Does that not show a problem with her stance above other killers?
---
I was going to downvote you for being obstinate but then I realized this might be that irony thing the kids talk about, so I cant tell whether or not to upvote
---

---
Though that was sans
---
I think the biggest part is the slowdown. The vision bluriness is stressful for newer players but gets easier with time. So if he throws it on a loop, and you run through it several times, he'll catch you faster. But most people see the cloud and run to the next jungle gym until the clown is out of juice.
---
I know. I’ve gone against so many red rank teams with a rank 16. I’m sure they used to go against similar rank killers who don’t understand time management or letting go of a chase, which would make games probably impossible against red rank survivors.
---
Yee lmao
---
It's a window, not a wall
---
The most recent nerf I can think of is her dash no longer counting as an M1 (ie no more noed, etc off dash)
---
As much as I love old freddy, new freddy certainly isnt bad.
---
His teleport gives him a lot of map pressure. Pair that with PGTW and discordinance and he becomes pretty mean.
---
His trap are good for stopping loops. They slow the survivor, and he doesnt slow while placing them.
---
His dream pallets can also really screw up loops leading to easy hits.
---
He puts people to sleep passively which allows his sleep-based add ons to work more effectively.
---
Old freddy was underrated as hell, but if they had to rework freddy, this is the best way they could have gone about doing it.

Something about him makes it hard to catch him.

I'm willing to call perks "crutch", when 3/4 surivors have them in any given game above rank 10. You might not notice if you never play killer. Or suck. Or both.
---
Do you play survivor or killer. Since I found that when playing survivor the frames are higher for me as well

---
ruleset #2 needs to be default.  I agree with most the other changes.  
---
  
---
Changing dash audio would be detrimental imo, though.  As of now the sound can be used in mindgames at pallets and such, while the only time Im not getting a sneak attack hit is when they have sprint burst, and run the perfect direction.  
---
I wouldn't mind if they gave her another jigsaw box though.  I feel like I see survivors get it off first try too much.  This would need more balance testing though.
---
BASEMENT HOOKS CAN BE CONVERTED INTO A 4K WITH CORRECT PORTAL POSITIONING AND TIMING.

If you don't see a problem, keep doing it. Just don't come back here when you and your friends will get banned.

"We will nerf the pig again"
---
Been happening to us all night
---
Lol I wanted to see the Mori but to make it fair I only used it in death hook, I got no excuse for the noed tho 😔
---
It punishes survivors for only focusing on the gens, cleanse the totems.
---
No. There is a Bloodhunt, but it has not started yet. It will start tomorrow at 11EST I believe.
---
you mean you are afraid your hatchets won't hit anymore when they're 5 meters off on the survivors screen ?
---
It's not me disagreeing. It's you being wrong. You will always have plenty of time to save someone from off hook unless they get hooked halfway through the collapse.
---
Nah, you're good bud. I was more like that than you were lol. But yeah, we can agree to disagree with our opinions :)
---
I wish this was really a thing tbh
---
I think it also forces slowvaults, so it's an antiloop basically.
---
He can be fun and easy to pip with plus, if you like the go hack some ppl!
---
Also here's a few "try again" perks for survs:
---
Adrenaline
---
Unbreakable
---
Dead Hard
---
Decisive Strike
---
Now please tell me why is NOED, a perk which survs CHOOSE to get hit by, really that bad?
---
It's practically mandatory on her tbh
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
1. Because she is easy to look over especially if she’s wearing her brown outfit. 
---
2. Most people that play her usually just hide from the killer the entire match.
---
3. There’s a Noob3 video where he gets chased for literally 20 mins and the Claudette on his team wasn’t doing anything but hiding.
---
She's pretty fun on occasion
---
THAT’S BECAUSE A.) YOUR VIEW ISN’T HOW THE GAME SEES IT- THE KILLER IS THE HOST SO WHILE YOU COULD BE 5 METERS AHEAD OF THEM ACROSS A VAULT, ON THEIR SCREEN, YOU’RE WITHIN SMACKING RANGE.  MOST OF YOUR PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED BY LATENCY. ALSO, YOU CAN STOMP THEM BECAUSE THEY’RE RANK 20 YOU FUCKING BRAINLET. THEY HAVE MAYBE 5 HOURS IN GAME AND BARELY KNOW HOW TO REPAIR A GENERATOR. TRY ENCOUNTERING A META SQUAD AND SEE HOW WELL THAT SHIT WORKS FOR YOU.
---
This hurts me as Legion main :(
---
I think a huge problem may be that there is very little people queueing as solo survivors. That may explain the first problem. The second problem is just a strange glitch.
---
A tier list post? Daring today I see!
---
THEY JUST UMMM. I DONT KNOW. BUT THEY MOAN LOAD IM SURE. RESPONDING TO YOUR FRIEND.
---
I still have his voice in my head. I love it
---
It's good but I definitely don't agree with Freddy being above billy
---
Flashlights don't even work properly half the time
---
It would also be nice if instaheal medkits and toolboxes didn't exist at all but every side deserves some op playtoy to releave some stress
---
BBQ is irrelevant in chases, which is what you're complaining about.
---
As people have said, break LoS. Nurse needs to know where the Survivor is to be effective. Walls and stuff hide a Survivor's exact location.
---
Iron Will helps lose Nurses. Combine with Urban to make it easier to ditch Nurse altogether mid-chase.
---
Oh, is that why bloodlust will literally destroy my frames so bad I do a 360 and the survivor is gone like a fart in the wind? Makes sense
---
YUP
---
Usually the problem isn't the reset, it's the duration MYC lasts (in my experience).
---
Running Sloppy + MYC, they typically aren't going to sit there and heal, which means they will also likely be playing more stealthy. You have to factor in hook return time + survivor find time + chase time
---
But I do see your point. I think it's too situational though
---
Same with me with hatch. I died because I was trying to save but kamp killer

&gt;  3-gen doc 
---
Every time I run a 3 gen build a survivor lots a fucking key from a chest and then 3 out of 4 of them escape.
---
Basically they are, not sure the exact word, additive I believe? In other words using them on a x2/x3 event does not provide a bigger bonus, the reward is still the same per streamer if you had done it during a normal game.
---
Games not suppose to be easy for survivors. It's always been that way. Why fix something that's not broken just to please salty survivors. 
---
Survivor main. Noed is pretty useless in most cases. Just gotta play smarter. Noed doesn't guarantee the killer a single kill. It's really locked based.
---
Who is she?
---
Same thing happened to me and all four of died. The killer was streaming and on his timer was ahead of the survivors timers
---
Once a survivor knows you leave the hook for a generator or survivor they always do this. It’s awesome because if you know another survivors location and down them before the unhooked survivor and saviour have time to get distance it’s another easy hook vs camping. Sure it’s just playing the game right but sometimes you may have to return earlier like when you lose a chase meaning you know what to expect even sooner by getting back to the hook faster.
---
Survivors
---
Dedicated servers are not here yet, the fuck you talking about?
---
That's true my friend
---
noed counters a body block. the timer is 4 minutes long twice as long as a full 100 to 0 hook. the timer gives you more than enough time to get the unhook and out. And if the killer doesnt want you to get someone they arent getting out tbh
---
No he did it in a public match. You've been able to get multiple killers in kyf matches for ages and bhvr has even said that they dont care what you do in kyf matches
---
You must have not played a lot of games then.
---
That will teach them to survive with friends 😡
---
Every survivor: Runs adrenaline and gen rushes like crazy
---
Every m1 killer: runs noed because it is literally the only way to have a chance
---
Every survivor: wow, fucking noed OP
---
Wish they'd fix the fun bug where a killer dcs and survivors lose their bloodpoints...
---
Can you give me a version about survivors with multiple second chance perks, instaheals, keys and toolboxes?
---
&gt;  It's such a crime to repost or not credit someone when I didnt know either.
---
Then where did you find it?
---
To be honest, if someone tapping crouch upsets you, you need to harden up and stop being so sensitive. 
---
It's a little bit of non-verbal trash talking. It's harmless. If you're getting upset over it you need to learn to take a step back and take the game a little less seriously.
---
Came here to say this hahaha
---
That's  pretty presumptuous of you
---
exit gates should always be opened as soon as possible. egc is longer than a hook state so either you saved him or you didnt and have time to get out
---
They don’t sleep upon hit only it’s also timed. Trust me he’s a high tier killer for his mind games and loop prevention plus general map pressure.
---
Although yes, it would be great to have Slenderman in the game, i don't see what his addons would be named like.
---
Sounds like an entitled human character main. Who wants more ways to escape and for all his HumAn ChAraCters to all level up together so it’s easier for him to get all the god tier perks.
---
No one should complain about NOED when one survivor can: have borrowed time and can survive a free hit, DS someone if/when they do get hit, pop adrenaline, and get back to full health and get a speed boost.
---
They all thought of healing right at the exit gate so whateves
---
NO REASON FOR NAME CALLING BUD ITS A SIMPLE CONVERSATION IF YOUR SHORT TEMPERED ASS CAN’T HANDLE A SIMPLE CONVERSATION ABOUT A GAME DONT EVEN BOTHER WRITING PEOPLE 💯💪🏼
---
It doesn’t force slowvaults, mediumvaults are still possible which is why Clown is on the weaker side. If the bottles made it so the survivor could ONLY do slowvaults then that would change Clown significantly and for the better.
---
Why does everyone get so butt hurt about the nodding and teabagging. Is everyone who plays this ten? YoUr bEiNg ToXiC
---
Yikes
---
They increase your gains by 100% of the BASE value
---
When there’s a Double Bloodpoints Event, You have BBQ, 3 Bloody Parties were used and you earned 32k you’ll get
---
32k*[1(base)+1(event)+4*0.25(bbq)+3(bloody party)] = 32k*6 =192k
---
Huh, tomorrow is gonna be a fuckin' nightmate, aint it?
---
It's always the fking meg and claudia
---
Meh.
---
This is a masterpiece
---
If you had shown a video of them teabagging, flashlight clicking and moonwalking at every opportunity to taunt you, then that justifies gloating about killing them.
---
But all I see here is a jaded killer main who takes out his frustration on all survivors. You killed three people, big deal, no one cares.
---
Double points if you're the only doing gens the whole game and then you get chased and hook then the game comes to a standstill for a good minute.
---
Imagine a game where KILLERS can't actually kill anyone.
---
I'd rather they un-cower on the original plan and implement moris as a base skill, but make them require one hook to be available, take a while to attempt, and be interruptable by nearby Survivors.
---
The offerings would just boost them back up to their current level, with Cypress upgrading to Ivory and Ivory upgrading to 2 easy Moris.
---
New Freddy is the king of mind games and game slowdown (with the right add ons). Equip him with perks that help protect gens (PGTW, Thrilling tremors, BBQ, Ruin is my build) and he becomes an unstoppable force of nature
---
If you hurt enough random people's feelings for something inconsequential, your penis will grow larger!
---
why do you assume it was a legion maybe it was a ghostface i mean if anyone is gonna get 28 stabs in on someone its the guy who can sneak up on you
---
If people act that badly to me then I just ignore them, even if it means the match will last longer because I'm not chasing them out of the match while they teabag. I just leave and go find any pallets I haven't smashed or anything, because getting a reaction from me is what they want, it's the same when I stream. I had people calling me a dumb whore and a slut, and all I did is say "have a nice day" and carry on with my matches :)
---
This mentality is so stupid it infuriates me, but hey i guess that's on me for letting it get to me, right?
---
Cuz fuck people with depression or anxiety, they don't get to play my game cuz I need to taunt others in order to feel superior, and if that gives them a bout of "the saddies" that's not my fault. 
---
Also fuck new people just trying to learn the game who don't have the same warped nuanced view of the game and the "friendly banter" that I do. Fuck em because even though teabagging has been established for years as a disrespectful toxic thing, in *this* game I do it as "friendly banter", so they need to figure that out themselves.
---
I don't need to worry about how other people perceive my actions or how my actions truly affect people, in my own head I don't think I'm a bad person at all and that's just it, I don't want to think any further about it so I just won't and dump it all on other people to work around me, instead of just not teabagging like a decent human being. I *need* to do it, and if you don't understand that, well fuck ya.
---
//rant
---
I can't wait til inner strength starts getting combined with head on decisive strike and borrowed time.
---
*Fixed a bug which allowed ambush attack*
---
Imagine Pig going from stealth to leaping off a pallet at you.
---
That's so cool it'll never happen ever.
---
Yo I’m down to play
---
I've never seen a Claudette doing this but I guess that's the point.
---
Just add them to your mori lists boisss
---
But they also fixed Crashes and Broken Matchmaking?
---
the very reason i switched to console. to save my space bar from utter destruction and because my family can hear it in the dead of night
---
I’d make it so the EGC starts as the gate gets touched, because 99ing them is straight up exploiting
---
Because the Devs are trolling after the Stephen King thing
---
Gerbilessence:ps4
---
Yeah, that's the only problem with slendy for this game. Can you imagine him getting in a chase? Hitting someone with an M1 attack and then running after them? He's more of a psychological horror monster than a slasher.
---
Survivors now have a choice. If they don’t want to have a hard time, don’t queue with someone 10 ranks above them
---
She couldn’t make it...
---
The Laurie shade never ends... XD
---
The lawsuit wasnt lost it was never against GUN. Its against the director and script writer i believe. They stopped all new production of anything friday the 13th and thats why uber was never released
---
I actually like in game Laurie
---
It’s a hot girl summer
---
I like her perks more, lol!
---
I teabag back.
---
Then like 10 seconds later I down them in one hit. Ghost Face is fun.
---
Backstory is a little bit shit but I feel he’s a decent killer
---
DS in the shrine this week
---
Vaulting feels really unsafe lately. There were definitely a few times when I jumped over the window and was almost around the corner and still got hit through the window, and my internet is fine.
---
It you really think the old system was superior to what we have now, I'm sorry to hear that. Not gonna try to convince you otherwise.
---
Yes, thanks for the reminder, need to get it for my Daddy David and his incessant altruism!
---
Tbh I think she should have tier 1 myers lunge. Its so bullshit that she doesn't even have to do a good blink to get a hit because she can just blink and twirl around while swinging and it will hit someone
---
Sounds amazing to me damn good job
---
r/suddenlygay
---
Yeah well it doesn’t matter who i pick when i have to wait a fucking eternity in a lobby. I mean Legion isn’t my main anyway they’re like iirc my 3rd behind Freddy and Doc.
---
Im a simple hag main. I see Lisa receiving love, I upvote.
---
no but fr nice bait lmfao
---
Thanks, I’ve been working on this post for a while, so I really appreciate the compliment!
---
New killer: The Mamma's boy
---
(I know it's breaking the “the &lt;killer name&gt;” rule but it's worth it, it's the perfect name)
---
Yes, all the time. I’m also getting a ton of “disconnected from host” when escaping a match, and not getting the 5000 survival points for escaping despite running out the gates.
---
Because vacuum pallets were fair and fun. Wasn't it fun when every pallet in the game was totally safe?
---
lmfao I still think people would go towards that direction with leave me alone just to get the killer on that other survivor...people are just sneaky like that
---
It would probably be a general amalgamation of different Jason appearances rather than one specific movie. My bet is he'd probably look most like his Freddy vs Jason appearance though.
---
I honestly have no idea what you’re saying
---
Well no because Then you'll have normal lunge and Berger movement speed because you can go evil within 2
---
His paywall argument is almost null and void in my opinion. Non licensed killers and survivors can be purchased with shards obtained in game. There are only6 licensed chapters (Halloween, Saw, Nightmare on Elm Street, Stranger Things, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Ghostface) out of 13 so far. Perks for the licensed killers and survivors appear sporadically in the Shrine so can be obtained without real world purchase IIRC, albeit they do appear rarely. Cosmetics are optional and do not affect your progression.
---
Idk if it was worth it man, my right thumb gets so exhausted mashing X (on PS4) after like 20 seconds, I’ve not been able to last the full minute quite a few times before.
---
I never saw it as anything else but an ear, an eye and a finger.
---
They do fall asleep when hit, it is also timed
---
What killer would Kars play?
---
could be lag or lag switching. did it happen again or to any of the other players?
---
after the metal gear solid torture segment my thumb pressing x for a bit in DbD is nothing
---
Dud, I have like 15 more of them, I just want to use them
---
Never got chance to play old Freddy but did see a lot of videos on him personally I absolutely love new Freddy the mind games you can do are pretty insane especially with new oblivious status effect can punish rushes first time iv ever hit red ranks and was all on Freddy
---
 they were lag switching through the whole game
---
I mean too be fair, clown and legion are already fucked enough. Lets not take this away from them too
---
He had the mirror
---
an idea for the way he would hook people and what his power would be first lets start with the way he can hook people: Sam can place survivors inside of his long candy sack. the way a survivor would wiggle off is they kicking and punching as hard as they can to rip open the sack and get out of it, this will be the way to get back up for the survivors
---
not running ruin, actual clown gameplay.
---
same, just same. i cant help it, i probably can but i dont want to help it haha
---
-ya AWAKEN, MY MASTERS!
---
Instead of chase music, static
---
Am I a complete idiot or are some of the people who let Mikey stalk them forever early on actually geniuses?  Sometimes, early in a game, someone will just stare at me and let me get all the way to Tier III and I'm like, "wow, what an idiot."  Then later in the game I've got no juice on them and I'm like... is this person actually 200 IQ?
---
Had a SWF that each bound the flashlight to scroll wheel. So it was rapid clicking...
---
Nono I'm not criticizing!!! It's funny!
---
Go for adrenaline
---
Looks like a major desync. 
---
If this was lag switching, you would've gone from healthy to downed or even hooked.
---
*waluigi
---
That sounds like a better experience 🤣
---
Always go for teachable if they're in your bloodweb
---
It wasn’t made up. What was made up was them trying to say they couldn’t add content period. 
---
It then came out they had a deadline to send in content to the files (not even release it - just put it in there) and it be allowed. But, instead, they worked on an engine upgrade that caused more problems then solved. 
---
They denied this deadline for months till other developers of a puzzle f13 game came out indirectly and basically said they were lying.
---
*Laughs in blood warden*
---
Lag? Lag switch? Hard to tell tbh.
---
wow really miss piggy got another nerf. WTH BHVR??
---
I've seen him angry, there was this toxic group of players using glitches, otz got mad, there was no face cam but he gave up his mission and started murdering players.
---
Not in High ranks because your totems get F*ckd before exit gates open
---
[The Cirrrrrcle of Liiiiiiiife!](https://youtu.be/GibiNy4d4gc?t=95)
---
Will I have to rely on rng for the other perks to reappear then?
---
watch fungoose, he plays all killers including clown with no addons. 4ks. Although his at 7k hours at the game
---
Ha! Twilight reference.
---
&gt;exit gates should always be opened as soon as possible. egc is longer than a hook state so either you saved him or you didnt and have time to get out
---
You are just forgetting one "little" detail... The distance between the exit gates and someone hooked. You have to run all the way from an exit gate to the hook, consuming time from EGC. Once unhooked, you both need to run all the way to the exit gate, also consuming time from EGC.
---
Often time there isn't enough time to do all this and 99ing% an exit gate is the smarter option.
---
Ah thx for the reply!
---
so in the specific case the killer has someone downed and gets them in the last half of egc and you are still there yeah your fucked
---
*You could have left but you decided to stay and vandalize my shit*
---
Greed never goes unpunished in the fog.
---
Short explanation: rank doesn't matter, no need for meaningful system
---
I NEED DEDICATED SERVERS! YOU ARE TOP 15 OF STEAM AND YOU DON’T HAVE THEM! THERE ARE SO MANY SHIT GAMES WITH DEDICATED SERVERS AND YOU THINK ITS OPTIONAL? ANY LAG SWITCHERS OR HIGH PING KILLERS ARE ON YOU FOR BEING CHEAP AND LAZY!
---
For most perks yes the III is better than the II or I
---
But if you have the legion discordance I is better than discordance III (don’t ask why just roll with it)
---
It's rare, but we do get really good Nurses, and from what i've seen it's not all that different of an experience to face them.
---
Good advice.
---
I play ps4 and have played with no headphone, crappy headphones where sound isn't represented well because it all just blares out at the same level and I've played with decent headphones that you can usually tell where the sound is coming from.
---
The differences between all 3 is amazing but with good sound gameplay improves a lot. I'd say more then half the clues and awareness in this game come from sound especially as killer.
---
AS A RANK 18 KILLER IM SICK OF PLAYING AGAINST GREEN OR RED RANK SURVIVERS AND THEN BEING BULLIED CAUSE IT WAS AN EZ GAME
---
The killer can't see it?
---
Bruh she’s thicc
---
No, obese, not ‘thicc’.
---
im okay with it. i dislike lerys though
---
it was just self defense
---
Yessir
---
Well considering she’s literally fictional I’m gonna say that she’s thicc as fuck
---
Oops I'm a dumbass I ment to say the offerings are for the endgame collapse timer :0
---
Thirsty over a disgustingly obese literally fictional character, PepeLaugh.
---
I, II, III are the Roman Numerals for 1, 2, and 3 respectively. These are the levels of the perks most the time they are better than the lower level versions. But in some cases with Discordance it’s better at tier 1 look [here for info on killer perks.](https://youtu.be/-ReYFH5x0NU) he hasn’t made a video on survivor perks however.
---
It's not the add-ons. Her base power with no add-ons is pretty fucking broken.
---
Or break through windows as well, goodbye shack window.
---
Wow you’re pathetic. You realize you’re not supposed to shitpost irl right?
---
this would be an amazing addition to DBD and i would love to see it come, but there is 1 thing.
---
it would absolutely kill they're game.
---
think about it, people want jason vorhees, they hear about the game, and check it out.
---
then they see its in DBD and see how much popular DBD is the friday the 13th and they go play that instead
---
just think about that...
---
The term just refers to someone who doesn't really attempt to put any work into a chase, and instead relies on bloodlust to catch the survivor. At least, that's my understanding.
---
Thanks
---
Well, that appears to be what your mother did when she produced you.
---
Also, found the horny indian Pepega.
---
trying to insult anyone else when you use spambrigade twitch emotes is pretty sad lol
---
I wasn't standing over hatch. I was standing next to a hook looking at hatch while within the hatch sound radius. I just don't give the hatch to people who struggle. However, I give them a last chance to stop struggling. Also, when I give people the hatch, I don't wait for them to struggle free, I just drop them on top of the hatch. This is something most killers do.
---
It's a meme build my dude, and you're talking about the nicest dudes in the bidness, if you watch his streams he likes to scare people or surprise them, and the idea behind this build was to jumpscare people with a 🤡 , which is funny because that's what clowns do.
---
why the operator?
---
Good answer. The second worst part of a bloodhunt is the 101 posts everyday about this and half the people giving the correct answer like you and the other half claiming it isn't right.
---
I never see people cure themselves against Plague so I dunno how useful that one would be but the rest are all very interesting and cool ideas!
---
trying to get involved in arguments that don’t include you in the slightest in completely lowercase with no sense of grammar is pretty sad lol
---
This is on switch right? Been happening a lot to me
---
It only goes so far in giving you knowledge. However the actual hands on practice is a whole different story. I'm in a similar boat as op I really only play survivor when I have a daily I want to do  or on the rare occasion a friend decides they want to play a bit. Complete babydwight.
---
Asking for a friend
---
Interesting, thanks
---
r/twitchselfpeomotions
---
I'm on board. The main problem with the game in my opinion is that there is way too much riding on the first chase. You usually win or lose depending on its duration. If 3 gens pop after the first hook, the game is basically over.
---
Okay **dood**
---
I wouldn't know how to upload it as I don't have an imgur account
---
Meme: Choke hold on black kid (idek lmao)
---
Context: Unknown
---
What are the lobbies like I'm concerned it'll be arse in certain areas?
---
It sounds good in text and looks funny in pictures and youtube but that's as far as it goes. Being chased by 2 killers is not fun in any way. It's broken as all fuck. There's no where to go and loops don't exist. You can get a pallet stun on one but the other is just gonna put you on the ground right after.
---
you're a lot smarter than me then
---
I would 100% buy this
---
Ty😊
---
You were not kidding this man single handedly made me hate the title
---
It gives information more often
---
Not my fault you're unoriginal. 🤷‍♂️
---
Yeah I like it a lot, feel like some of the perks could use a bit of tweaking but the general concept for each one is really creative.
---
Someone is telling you big fat lies... I play killer 95% of the time it can be weeks between survivor matches for me these days and I've never been banned or suspended or warned.
---
Don't need one.
---
God dammit I got hyped, then I realised we still don't have an 11th or 12th chapter lol.
---
If the killer have NOED. They do it to disable blood warden and escape
---
That’s the reality. Survivors doing *unnecessary* toxic shit and wonder why the killers do the same in return...
---
This wouldn’t be their first time in a video game either. They’re already on Friday the 13th: Killer Puzzle. If we can get Tony Hawk why not them. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Is it viable strategy tho? I though you waste too much time on it. Actually first time I hear about bloodlust players
---
I can't tell if you're stupid, or a troll.
---
Probably both.
---
I was around the corner when a Hag did this to me. She was no where in sight for a good 10 seconds.

Open the mystery box and find out, if it’s a key then it’s fate,
---
Who's gonna be the killer?
---
could be some kind of clensing like with the plague
---
Balanced Landing and Haddonfield. The ruin a killers day starter pack.
---
Ugh, there's just something about a fellow survivor on a hook that gets me riled up enough for me to die for them everytime. 
---
Steve, here i come.
---
Toxic doctor loves Gideon meat plant.
---
It can be hit or miss jump scare myers is another good example of this.
---
I love lerys for all the window vaults unless bamboozle 😩
---
Just dont bother replying on stuff like that. They're are just salty
---
Yeahp. I tried my hand at Demogorgon for the first time yesterday, and it took only that one game for me to go to the next game with a tryhard Pig. Painful.
---
I made this meme using the dwight/dweet joke, other than that it's original. There aren't many running jokes in the dbd community so why is it you have to try and shit on the few jokes that there are?
---
Oh shit you’re right why did I think it was better?
---
"bUt ThEy ArE jUsT cRoUcH sPaMmInG"
---
I've literally had toxic survivor mains vilify me on here for watching my teammate die on hook because I recognized his gamer tag as a cunt who got carried by a swf and bagged at the exit gate. These toxic little fuckers legitimately said "all he did was bag, he didn't ruin your game by denying your chance at survival" fuck survivor mains in general. This is why I run Noed, devour, nurse's, and bbq on nearly every killer I play. 9/10 they're just going to go out of their way to ruin your game, and be little fat balls of cancer. 10/10 I throw fun out of the window to ruin their game if I even get a hint of swf. 3 people join at once, at least one of them is P3, or spent money on a customization, and someone's bringing a flashlight? I'm dropping demogorgon and bringing out my P1 hag with gen pluck add ons.
---
It's funny actually, im sure I've teabagged my teammates more then ive ever done to a killer
---
Spirit is a good enough killer that she shouldn't need noed. A good spirit will have the game done before it's even needed.
---
Who?
---
Allot of people really seem to hate the idea of crossplay with pc players. So I propose all console players should be crossplay then. we currently have 5 different communities being split up (PC, Mobile, Switch, PS4, Xbox) if they can at least combine Xbox, Switch, and Ps4 into one community that would definitely speed up que times. And for some communities (Switch) might end up having the lower player base after a few months, so I think it's fair to let them play the game instead of lobby simulator.
---
Take this idea and add even more Slender in it: The killer can go completely invisible and reappear while not in direct line of sight of a survivor.
---
This could allow you to suddenly appear from behind a tree and spook 'em.
---
It'd also be cool if he had no TR at all.
---
Maybe to offset a basic attack wouldn't do damage but would fill the static "meter" by 75% (3 hits to down, every hit generates distortion for the survivor and any already generated "static" would also be used (e.g survivor with 25% would take damage on 1 hit).
---
"Have you added nothing to the conversation"
---
"Nope, not at all"
---
It's clear the level of intelligence i'm working with here. It's okay if you simply don't understand..
---
been maining legion from the beginning but even me just learned a couple of useful things. thanks for the post
---
I say that because a lot of ds users are Laurie's besides iam rank 4 as killer I have atleast 1000 hours
---
One thing I want to know thought, survivors with controllers aren't really different than keyboard survivors, so while PC nurse would be stronger than console Nurses, what's the difference btween controller survivors getting wrecked by pc nurse vs pc survivors getting wrecked by a pc Nurse?
---
As a console player I would hate this because I already play against people with a mouse and I never win because it’s impossible to bait a attack and dodge and it’s really boring. If it was cross platform about half console players would probably stop playing.
---
Sometimes my game disconnects during the match and now there's a bug that when survivors try to leave they get disconnected. I believe we will have to wait for dedicated servers in order for BHVR to be able to track intentional disconnects. As of right now, they can't differentiate between intentional and someone's internet going out. That's why the disconnection ban is set at, like, 40-something percent.
---
Ohhh imagine Jay or Tim as the survivor, that would be dope
---
This is the point I've been making since this change was announced. It doesn't fix anything because people will just derank.
---
I always give up, at third hooking. Or endgame. No use in a fruitless endeavour
---
Nurse is not very good on console and much harder then PC. With console controllers you can't get that same fast point and click knee jerk reaction that she needs.
---
I've only ever encountered 1 decent nurse on console myself. The rest of the time I hear that screech it's usually followed by me and my friend talking about how we almost always survive nurse encounters.
---
I don't try and bully killers or discourage them from learning a new killer most times I assume they are trying her out or have a daily but I still play to escape. Keep in mind I don't play much survivor as well when I say this.
---
I've had nurses give up blinking and just walk at me because on console I just zig zag and run erratically because they often can't turn and swing fast enough. 
---
Controller limitations suck sometimes.
---
You can ask my roommate but I scream my ass off about how the survivors wonder why everyone runs Ruin
---
Sounds needless, just remove her pointless nerfs
---
Balanced Landing on Haddonfield is probably the strongest survivor setup in the game, it can be an infinite if done properly.
---
This is me everytime. A Nancy schooled me when her adrenaline popped and turned on the jets
---
How about cross play between Xbox, ps4, and Switch? Que times would be sped up immensely I imagine, and the Switch community might end up being the lowest player base in a few months, so them being forced to play lobby simulator would suck.
---
nevermind, im retarted. good point
---
"Fans of a game say they would agree to be in the game if asked" Is this really a surprise?
---
I guess it could work
---
But who's the Monster gonna be
---
The Look See
---
D-strike is a pretty solid anti-tunneling perk
---
I've had this happen to me, I think it has something to do with the killer dcing during the end game, killing any remaining survivors.
---

Funny thing is the only salty person was the this guy who opened the door right after finishing the last gen and left right away despite having a teammate hooked
---
Because of your amazing art I say that they have to add Jason
---
There is no difference for survivors. A good PC nurse will wreck anyone.
---
How dare he play as Ash
---
It honestly does. Then i watch pc gameplay and it's so smooth lol
---
mam' this is a wendy's
---
Not cool man, I would like to not have to shit my pants constantly
---
"Oh no, a killer with the ability to stop me from infinitely looping them at extremely unfair loops. Broken and overpowered. Rework please." Maybe if so many survivors would stop being toxic little cunts then people wouldn't be so inclined to play a strong character, and would focus on having fun instead? Reap what you sow.
---
Survivor only DLC just like Ash and I’m sure Tony Hawk will be. But their cat Lucy would be a great killer I’m sure lol.
---
Yeah OP didn't make the artwork. It's from Mortal Kombat X.
---
Right, so why would it be bad to have PC nurse wreck console survivors if console survivors are the same as PC survivors in terms of skill? I'm sure there's also lots of controller survivors on PC as well.
---
Maybe you just stop pressing m2?? That stops the chainsaw

It isn't always accurate, but it is a pretty good tier list most of the time.
---
Ahh crap its back. While ago was a way for people to do this. To my knowledge they banned people over it until it was fixed.
---
Getting matches with 2 killers was bad but now 3...
---
And just in time for bloodhunt hope this is an isolated incident.
---
Sounds like a glitch, his feral frenzy ended then he immediately swung during the exit animation
---
That would be cool if they got in contact with The Look See
---
Does four seconds really make that much of a difference? I’ve never used it so I wouldn’t know, but I’d think they’d stay there until you show up, idk why one would leave unless there’s ruin and they want less skill checks
---
Hell, frame rate drops happen when you go into bloodlust or tier up as Mikey. They happen for survivors when using exhaustion perks. #SaveOurConsoles
---
I think that Tony Hawk tweet was most likely a joke, since Tony Hawk is known for skateboarding, not horror.
---
Oh, I’ve never played
---
MOST PEOPLE IN THIS GAME ARE BITCH BABIES
---
You’re welcome, might wanna remove it before you get flamed by the mob on here
---
Spinechill any aura reading perks.
---
I have no idea I don't use it but that's why they recomend tier 1
---
I want this, and Cindy, and both would scream utterly random and hilarious shit while getting chased. If they're in a match together they'll have different lines than when they're on their own.
---
No, adrenaline will appear in every bloodweb until you buy it, DS won't.
---
I've had a friend chased of a gen while I finish a totem because the gen can mask the noise easily.
---
That's because he's always running Iron Will
---
Wonderfull art i realy thought it was real
---
Only lit totems notify the killer.
---
???
---
I don't really care if it is good or bad, I'm stating the difference for the above. You are reading into my post a little bit too much it seems.
---
The thing is that even before all her nerfs, she was still generally considered a low-tier killer with no defense against pallets, a power with highly inconsistent results due to RNG, and an overtuned endgame and tunneling potential.
---
These changes to seek to not just get her where she was, but actually improve her abilities while sanding down some of the annoying parts of her that people didn't like and began the spiral of nerfs in the first place.
---
S tier - killer
---
F tier - survivor
---
Hijacking this thread since you are coming from PC: How bad does it feel on the switch? framerite wise? I don't care about bad graphics I just want to have a smooth gameplay experience
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d9g7nb/are_freddy_and_bubbas_perks_available_on_switch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
The screenwriter of the original Friday the 13th won’t allow anyone to produce new content regarding the franchise. That’s why F13: The Game is pretty much just on life support now.
---
That would be good but they already have a game... I don't think it will ever happen :/
---
Looks like the blind broke him out of Frenzy but he didn't have to go through the stun animation.
---
I thought you didn’t get blood points for saboing after the gens were done.
---
I found it really works best paired with quick and quiet, dance with me and now inner strength. That was you can head on if they try and grab before a heal finishes and if you get a stun you don't leave scratch marks for a few seconds. It is a bit of a pain in the arse at times to get the timing right though.
---
This may seem bad to say, but I don’t think that should’ve been a legion teachable, for huntress it’s better.
---
Ah ok, I interpreted you explaining the difference is because you didn't want PC Nurse to go against console survivors with this line "Because you are not going to be able to do anything against that shit."
---
Self promote elsewhere, you’ll get slaughtered in comments here
---
I don't mind playing against him. I'll take him over a Legion or Spirit any day of the week but I hate playing as him.
---
I only run Iron Maiden when I actually use a BBQ build. Pretty much makes it so I have to know where you are at some point.
---
All I can say is blame the last guys for being assholes. It's cut throat for the killers, we have to do literally anything we can to get the upper hand. The devs made this game as an online horror game, but the result is a toxic cesspool of infinite loops, try hard flashlight warriors, and face camping legions.
---
Pig is C-tier only for those who doesn't want to put in hours. Or those who think that tunneling trapped survivors is the way to play her.
---
&gt; a power with highly inconsistent results due to RNG
---
That's one of the main confusions about Pig. RBTs are a minor part of her power. Her main power is dash attack.
---
I think it would be very difficult to implement him into dbd due to how he works as a paranormal entity. You gotta take into account the fact he distorts electronics when around, causes camera screens to get all static-y and he also has teleportation and sigma radiation (as I’ve read). 
---
Though the devs could just change him up or remove some things to fit him into dbd. And that’s IF they get their hands on the license, I heard victor surge (creator of slender man) is kinda aggressive with the license.
---
Whenever someone complains to me post-game, I send them the same response. 
---
A 15 second recording of a crying baby. If you find yourself getting that on console, you found me.
---
Nah, it's a known bug that is causing the end game timer to desync between players. The timer will look fine to the killer because they are the host.
---
I wasted 2 seconds of my life reading this. Gee thanks a lot!
---
Lmao why not just run around a truck?  I don't get it, it worked for me.  Serious question, was that nurse just bad?
---
This is gonna be awesome wtfff
---
lol people really believe shes fine. Once you learn how to play her the game has no challenge. Its easy 4ks with no effort every game. She's broken with or without add ons. Spirit with prayer beads is also totally broken. 
---
I stopped playing killer all together because it was boring. Unless you're going against a really good swf squad or have intentionally crippled yourself there's no challenge. And the solo survivor experience is such shit that I quit the game all together.
---
Depends on how safe the pallets are. If there’s long walls both sides you’re gonna have a bad time. It’s viable to blood lust and mind game the hallway pallets in Lerys and most pallets in Hawkins for example as they’re unsafe as fuck.. short walls, easy to lunge around them and hit.
---
If you play survivor, DS is a good one to have.
---
Your connection to him is trash but you assume it’s a lag switch. Smh. By the way this goes agains this sub reddit rules as shaming players definitely without evidence as it’s just lag, get used to it.
---
Yes you are wrong it is clearly an example of trolling and has a report option in game.  You revealing survivors locations to the killer with the intent of getting them killed is unquestionably trolling.
---
Your use of the quote about selfish play is twisting the context to the point where it becomes deformed.  Selfish play that is acceptable and within games rules include playing only to survive yourself and not going for saves or performing altruism.  It doesn't refer to intentionally killing survivors by ratting them out to killer.  Keep trolling if you want but it is reportable and bannable if they report with video footage.
---
Didn’t they say they were gonna work on it in like... March?
---
Has anybody asked about it on any of the dev streams?
---
So PC for this game is definitely the better platform. The only thing you may want to think about is there is no account sharing between platforms, so you'll be starting over again from scratch. May not be too bad if you start today with the blood hunt.
---
She isn't very hard. You practice a little bit and you'll be capable of killing 90% of survivors. She doesn't take "immense skill".
---
Why do so many people not know how to use Bubba?
---
He is far from the worst Killer.
---
I'm not sure dedicated servers will help a lot with this. Instead of DCing people will just kill themselves on first hook.
---
And potentially useless because the general rule for good survivors is just to not cleanse.

That's what u get for pointing flashlights at exit gates!
---
*You’ll get your lobby when you fix these damn servers!*
---
Honestly I may sound like one of those complaining bitches, but Demogorgon is getting OP now.
---
You literally remove a pallet in a chase whilst getting an ability that has by far the quickest cooldown ever
---
A natural and temporary speed-up that a killer gets during an uninterrupted chase (that means no pallet breaking). Survivors hate them because the killer gets faster for a bit. It’s just a part of the game.
---
If you whine on reddit threads:
---
Stop. You aren’t funny
---
I think you're right my dude
---
They would have to change too much about slenderman to make him fit in this game. Just another killer idea that is better off in another asymmetrical multiplayer horror game. Much like Jason, Freddy, and Pennywise.
---
 This game restricts killers too much. Or in this case, forces slenderman into movements and actions that are completely out of character. It would be odd to see him do anything but stand in place, even if you had his shadow tentacles do everything.
---
Then what's the point of having an ability that doesn't stop the chainsaw if you're just gonna stop it anyway?
---
First time?
---
When did the subreddit become so heavily killer sided? Did all the free weekends bring in a bunch of really whiny and bad killers?
---
This. If you stay at unsafe loops for too long BL will get you. Got to know when to leave.
---
I only bothered to slog through the toxicity that was the high ranks just to get my rank 1 killer achievement, it makes me happy that these toxic survivors normally only come across nurse, spirit, and billy in the high ranks.
---
It makes me Very Happy.
---
I was trying that just last game but they would unhook and run to a loop anyway, I do fine as bubba, wraith, trapper etc, yet they were looping the shit out of me with this freddy, i knew right away i just need to get familiar but i did so well as old freddy and never saw the problem, ironically, the reason why i have trouble with new freddy is why everyone hated old freddy, im applying methods from basic killer play to a killer that needs their own play.
---
I would get rid of whispers. Spirit is very dependent on sound, especially when phasing. You don't need whispers groaning in your ears when listening for survivor footsteps and breathing.
---
Heathens will be given no quarter. Kill them all, and let God sort them out. Except baby dwites. They should be spared from the crusade.
---
My build was after P1 so yeah my perk selection was shithouse, i dont evem have BBQ on him yet.
---
Then he had noed on.
---
*end credits*
---
It takes longer to break a pallet using shred than when normally breaking it, it just allows Demo to be more aggressive in a chase
---
I've been experiencing these issues also :(
---
Why do you act like a dick
---
Upvote for Honesty. No egg though.
---
Come thru Radiation!
---
For some killers like Billy, quickly starting up the power, letting it go repeat, will lag the game like crazy
---
Stun seems to have taken him out of frenzy and could've been coupled with Frank's mixtape. Wouldn't have happened if he just kept running for the exit, play stupid games win stupid prizes.
---
So what kind of mind games does he have? is it because you arent seen until 16m?
---
HAHAH I imagine the survivor face like "say sike right now"
---
Sorry but I've got to scream it...SNAAAAKEEE EAATEEEEEER TADAHN TADAAAAAAAAH!
---
Why do people always think they are experienced enough to review a competitive game after playing it for literally like an hour. The dude has 2 perk slots and no game sense. No competitive game is really fun at the start because everyone is better than you and you don't know how to play properly yet
---
Bloodlust was introduced as a bandaid mechanic for troublesome map tile designs that created infinite loops. [Here's an old video showing infinite loops in the early days of Dead by Daylight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAixJzL3o2M) to give you an impression why infinite loops was a problem and why the developers had to implement a bandaid mechanic to react quickly to this issue.
---
Since then, many map tiles have been redesigned (removing one window from jungle gyms, changing the harvester, permanently blocking specific windows) and additional balance changes were made to prevent infinite looping (slowing down survivor vaults, Entity blocking windows after too many uses within a short period). There are only a couple of infinites left in the current state of the game and I think (correct me if I'm wrong please) the majority of them are only accessable with Balanced Landing. 
---
That means that the initial reason behind the introduction of Bloodlust is (almost) not a thing anymore and, as pointed out by u/Macden7601, it's now mainly used to describe players who "don't attempt to put any work into chases and rely on bloodlust to catch a survivor", which is why people start to request that Bloodlust has to go. The game changed significantly over 3 years, many things have been fixed, the developers have more tools to prevent issues like infinite looping, but Bloodlust is still in the game even though it's technically not needed anymore.
---
Do you run Prove Thyself?
---
Do you play steve by any chanse?
---
I would main the hell out of him
---
Earlier in this same video Otz talks exactly about how BHVR buffing medium vault speed completely killed Clown's already questionable viability.
---
I would love slender
---
Yeah, you got down voted hard lol. Haw dare you have opinions on reddit :P
---
As for finding survivors with Killer Instinct and downing them with M1+NOED, that doesn't sound very reliable. You'll get one survivor guaranteed, sure, but as for the rest..? From my games running NOED, on bigger maps, the moment they know you have it, it's getting cleansed. RIP.
---
Still, you gave me an idea. NOED on Legion might cause enough confusion when paired with Knock Out.
---
Had a game like this, we all finished gens we were all running around with the Spirit which was friendly knowing she had lost, I even found a purple flashlight in a chest for once, we got near the exit so if she decided to hit one of us we could escort him to the exit, timer was at 20-25% remaining, then it happend we all died and the timer rushed to the end, Feelsbadman
---
(Btw you can see if it will happend to you or not, when the timer start it will freeze for a solid 10 seconds then start so yeah, if you see it don't fuck around)
---
ALSO ON PC, IT FUCKING BLOWS THAT I CAN FIND A SURVIVOR GAME IN TWO SECONDS BUT NEED TO WAIT FIVE MINUTES ON AVERAGE SO REACHING ANY KIND OF RANK WITH KILLER IS FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE
---
He probably panicked and laughed at the same time
---
Her base power with no addons takes a lot of practice and has a lot of room for error and counterplay. Add a blink distance addon and third blink addon and you remove almost all of that.
---
I JUST WANT TO STAY IN A FUCKING GAME ON XBOX PLEASE IT'S ALL I ASK
---
I don't think the answer to him being in the game is technically never. I just think Jason himself is just locked within a stalemate of legal possession. If I remember right it had something to do with a battle for who actually owned his rights and each side has merit so no one can use him until the lawsuit finishs determining who actually has the right to give him out and recieve money from his licenses. So I'd like to believe that both parties in the lawsuit would like to see him in the game and get the rolaty money but the courts havent determined who the royalty money would go to. So not technically never, but not likely ever.
---
and then you all just stand there awkardly staring at each other
---
Even just making her Rules Set No. 2 add-on part of her basekit would really go a long way for her.
---
GET OVER HERE!
---
I am not refusing to read anything. I just don't have to be up-to-date on this stuff. It's on them to be and fix it. For me it is only to enjoy the game that works properly. I didn't sign anything that would force me to know these things and thus can't be blamed for not knowing them. So yeah, stay in school, kids. Maybe learn how comas and dots work.
---
Meh
---
Welcome to another episode of "Shit that only happens when you are the killer"
---
Slow... They called you slow!
---
-Huntress: *throws axe*
---
-Survivor:SIKE,YOU TOUGHT!
---
The fuck ? You serious ? They haven't fixed a pretty substantial part of the game. Who am I to blame then, wise guy ? Myself ? Not my game, not me developing and fixing it, receiving money for the work. So yes, I will blame till the sun explodes if it stays in. Make me not do that, I'd love to see you try other then by fixing it.
---
Games have bugs. Every game, ever. Always have, always will, and it’s absolutely on you to keep up with these things, otherwise you risk looking ignorant when you hop on reddit and start bitching about bugs the community, and devs, have known about for a considerable amount of time.
---
What do you mean? I teabag for friendship. I teabag everyone and everything.
---
I'm not the original poster but I want Rules Set #2 to be base kit, and personally the new Rules Set #2 should be one of the most evil goddamn addons in Dead By Daylight.
---
You're locked to one trap and it's a hard limit. You can't stack it with Last Will for 2 traps. NONE OF THE BOXES HAVE THE KEY meaning the trapped survivor is doomed to eventually die unless they grab hatch. 
---
Fits with Amanda's lore and feels worthy of ultra rare status. Only problem is it's a pretty "Toxic" addon like a giant middle finger to the trapped survivor, especially once they finish the last box (Likely with little time left) and it not having the key and they realize they spent all that time checking boxes for nothing and they're about to die.
---
Well that isn’t racist
---
Credit to some random Facebook person.
---
How would a dumpster stop Slenderman?
---
Combine it with Sloppy Butcher, Thanatophobia, Red Paint Brush and Swing Chains and it might not be an entirely awful "oppression" fun build, but it's still pretty awful. 3% is just not nearly enough. Old Dying Light was already not a popular perk, and it applied a 25% debuff; you'd need to hook non-Obsession survivors 8 times until you get that same debuff from new DL, and tunnelling the Obsession out of the round is *a lot* easier and faster than getting 8 hooks. At 8 hooks, the round is regularly already near its end. And then even that debuff is still not terribly impactful. You do obviously get an effect from new DL from the very first hook, but again, it's negligible.
---
Oh okay lmao didn't play that much against her so I didn't know it was beneficial for her if you cleanse
---
Well they never denied the idea and If the lawsuit is finished within the next 2 years and bhvr still updates content for next 5 there’s actually a good chance he could make it in
---
If I am ever a killer. I always ignore people that closely want chased. They always seem to eventually fuck up and I get them anyway no chase required. But i am a survivor main and only play killer for DR
---
As long as we're sharing ideas, I think a good rule set #2 rework that would really fit the theme of the saw movies would work like this.
---
The trap is immediately activated when applied to a survivors head
---
Jigsaw box skill check sizes are reduced by 60 percent
---
Jigsaw box search times are considerably increased
---
If a survivor misses a jigsaw skill check, their trap immediately goes off, killing them.
---
It would make the traps significantly deadlier but a survivor would still have a chance at surviving.
---
Oh, I never realized this was a bug. I just figured this was a way to add pressure to the survivors.
---
Nursein a snarky British accent:"Paaaletts? What's that?"
---
People complain about Prove Thyself? Why? It literally only makes a difference of 4-7 seconds.
---
Only Claudette? Do the other survivors not have the same reaction? :D
---
Claudetteeeee
---
Did people got left on the hook a long time and got sacririced? That also decreases your score if you don’t unhook them.
---
&gt; How does "putting in hours" make you any better at her, specifically? She has an extended lunge attack out of stealth and a time waster you can put on people, and that's it. She's an incredibly basic killer.
---
Watch Scorpionz for an answer. If you'll conclude he's an average Pig main... then we have a very different view on what "getting better as a killer" means.
---
I never understood when people say this. It's capped at 60 on pc too unless there is some way I'm unaware of to remove said cap.
---
I actually have a few concepts to how he would work, but it's really hard to explain.
---
Basically, he has a fear meter, and the more it fills up, the more of his abilities he can use.
---
You fill up the fear meter by getting close to survivors, by hitting them, by downing them, and by hooking them. 
---
But I can't really explain everything
---
The only idea i can get behind.
---
That would be amazing!!! What would be the killer's power though?
---
Is DbD on Switch good? I might get it later.
---
I didn't have it in other games either, only DbD. My fiance had it til I got him a gaming monitor. I had it until I changed the resolution settings. Only other thing I can think of is updating the drivers. But I do know that it is not an in game bug, it is a problem with windows. It's been around for years with other games due to windows.
---
It doesn’t work on 2 gens at the same time?
---
Sleep paralysis but instead of the above you have to listen to Survivor mains whine about camping, Killer mains whine about SWF and the general audience whine about... well everything.
---
that happen to all the players in the game live on stream
---
Think about if you loop him, you won't be able to see where he is. You will struggle to run the right number of loops which makes this one tricky for optimal survivors
---
Along with the typical mind games, you can use his snares to cut loops short, and force early pallet drops, or potentially get hits through pallets you wouldn’t normally get, which is all good and well, but the real mind games come with dream pallets. Corralling survivors into parts of the map where you’ve set up dream pallets makes them question just about every loop they go through, they’ll start panicking, dropping pallets early to be safe, you can snowball into complete map control, and destroy every safe loop the survivors have, in just a handful of chases. Combine this with gen protector perks for maximum game slowdown, and you’ll rarely lose. He’s really just a force to be reckoned with if you know how to manipulate the survivors into whatever traps you’ve set, and snowball the momentum into easy hooks
---
Shit talking is toxic. And you can definitely tell when a survivor is or isn't trying to taunt you depending on the context of the situation. Don't be delusional, it's not a challenge if someone teabags you.
---
"Now who da FUCK did that?" - to the Huntress
---
I actually asked this same question to the devs on twitter in august, and they said they were NOT losing it. They were continuing development and all that...
---
Here i was hoping for a good FT13 game.
---
But either way the killer is going to walk over there and the survivors will either be there or not, it being highlighted for an extra 4 second doesn’t make much of a difference
---
I might do another poster explaining in detail his perks and power, I'm not 100% sure at the moment, maybe make the survivors trip to the floor while you chase them? Or also he could vanish behind a tree and appear behind another object/distracted survivor
---
Yeah I usually get confused why people say this also but pc can also increase it with optimization console still doesn’t have it even though it was promised last December so pc players could go clown and just throw a crap ton of bottles and frame the game but I think it could work in public matches also
---
Digitally I think it said it was 8 GB. If you get it physically though, all your system memory/microSD card stores are the patches.
---
You forgot the shitpost flair. Do your worst. You’re outnumbered 4 to 1.
---
I have a question though, how did flashlights turn into a toxic item? Isnt it just a mechanic survivors can use? Last time I checked flashbangs where never toxic so why are flashlights? Btw newer player here.
---
Gotta remember that rank though mate. He’s rank 15 in the pic, so honestly noed would be really helpful
---
Iridescent head rework: breaks pallets at full charge, takes considerably longer to charge.
---
I love The Game! It's my favorite map next to Red Forest. So many safe pallets for survivors and super fun with the doctor! My spirit totem build is absolutely deadly on this map!
---
I chase who ever I find as a killer main. Very rarly do I ignore someone unless someone is closer. Also as a killer main I’d like to note something here. I don’t see camping and tunneling as viable stats tbh but when I hook someone and the entire lobby is flicking around the hook I don’t get why the survivors are quick to call me a camper when everyone is literally running around the hook. Also when it comes to tunneling sometimes and most of the time in my case at least it’s just coincidence that I find the hooked survivor first. He’s bleeding and making noise. It may seem like your being tumbled but if I see that your taken of the hook and I see blood on the ground I’m gonna follow it. And if it happened to be the guy on the hook then sucks for you lol
---
Ps: this isn’t even directed at op and kinda a waste of 5 min typing this up xD. But saw someone underneath saying something about it so I figured I’d chime in
---
Exactly I guess I meant if he does get in it wouldnt be until later later and who knows it might be a small revival of the game at year 5 haha
---
Lol what a noob
---
Nay heathen. This is not a shitpost, this is a rally. Draw thy swords. We meet in the bowls of the meat packing plant.
---
Good luck «4v1ing» a 5 blink nurse with ruin, noed and a mori, buddy.
---
I mean great idea and all but if your friend uninstalled because of toxic people in games he must not play online games at all
---
Ruin would be a waste. They'd pop it within 30 seconds and it would have very little effect. If anything, I'd run corrupt intervention, or pop goes the weasel, which I don't have either.
---
I don’t do that I make a hit list that if tbaggers from past games are in my game I facecamp them with bubba and let everyone else go or use omega blink toxic nurse
---
Pink haired neas with flashlights who tbag whenever you look in your direction.
---
I love watching them die

I made this.
---
The Slender
---
Weapon: Black Tentacle’s
---
Speed: 105%
---
Terror Radius: 16 metres
---
Power: Urban Legend
---
Press and hold the power button to channel *urban legend*. While channeling urban legend, any survivor that looks at The Slender will quickly fill his power bar. Survivor’s screens are filled with static whilst looking at The Slender. Once the power bar is filled, The Slender will be able instantly teleport to any survivor that he can see, completely depleting the power bar. (This works if you can see the survivor *or* their aura). 
---
Special Attack: Instead of lunging forward, the slender charges his tentacles before unleashing them up to 8 meters in front of him, damaging the first survivor they hit. Perks and items that influence lunge range instead affect the range of these tentacles and their charge time.
---
Perks.
---
Hex: Immense Growth. The more they accomplish, the further your power grows. When a generator is completed, gain a token. The totem associated with this perk will not appear lit until it has accumulated 2 tokens, but can still be cleansed.
---
1 Token- whenever a dull totem is cleansed or a generator is completed, all survivors scream.
---
2 Tokens- whenever a survivor would scream, their aura is also revealed for 2/3/4 seconds.
---
3 Tokens- Greatly decreases the difficulty of generator skill checks, but will put survivors into the injured state if they fail the skill check. This does not result in any generator regression. (Does not affect injured survivors)
---
4 Tokens- You gain a 1/2/3% haste status affect when moving towards a generator that is being worked on. This hex totem’s aura is revealed to all survivors.
---
5 Tokens- grants you the ability to kill survivors by your own hand. 
---
Prey on the weak. The weak and defenceless are your preferred prey, and you are skilled at dispatching them. If a survivor has been injured for at least 120/90/60 seconds, they will periodically scream every 30/25/20 seconds unless they are being healed. This perk does not affect any survivor that has stunned you in the last 60 seconds.
---
Leave no trace. When you hit a survivor who is inside the exit gates, that exit is blocked to the survivor you hit for 10/15/20 seconds.
---
pls
---
It's context heavy
---
If I lost a game cause I over-committed to chasing someone who read me like a book, if you were a gen monkey all match and went down immediately when I went to get your stack, teabagging at the exit makes you look like a fucking idiot
---
On the other hand, if the guy I chased all match does it, it's intrepreted as a "gg fun chases" if they didn't die, or "suck my chode exdee" if you were camping them and they made a getaway after you were obviously made mad
---
If it's done before or at the very start of a chase, it's a gauntlet being thrown down. Like "oh, bitch please, you wanna do this?" from the killer
---
Or it's a means to deliberately get your attention if they're like SWF and they have friends who aren't that good/ are taking care of ruin and need a tiny bit of distraction
---
Between obviously good players it loses all sting- it's almost a colloquial greeting. But only after the game has wrapped up- usually if the survivors are being stomped. Like "i may be dead but i will go out partying" (killer usually plays along)
---
Doing it right after something ridiculous or silly happened, usually a big fuck up from the killer- it's kind of just funny. Spirit unphases and goes to lunge, but flushes themselves down a hole they got baited into. They slowly look up, and see the survivor teabagging with the inflection of a shit eating grin.
---
The MOST COMMON time teabagging happens though is when the killer is dishing out shit. Unfair add-ons and losing? Face-camping/ tunelling for no reason? If the survivors break free they will teabag you to hell in back just to spite you. If you can't take it don't dish it.
---
**But in most cases** the person teabagging is dramatically over-estimating their skill level. You **almost never see** legitimately good survivors teabagging outside of like obvious sarcasm or inside jokes with the killer. It's USUALLY the shitters teabagging from the safety of an exit gate while the teammate that ran the killer the most dies on their first hook.
---
Probably both
---
Yes
---
I don't think he's trying to be funny
---
Not bad
---
To be honest im just a little sad that hes been made more boring you know? its another M1 killer that puts shit on the ground, but thats ok a few more hours and im sure ill come around, thanks for the advice by the way.
---
Omg what are we looking at?? I don’t see what everyone else is
---
Have You thought about 2 Killers Chasing 1 Survivor? Theyd all die... really fast
---
Perhaps it is considered an in game bug, but it's still only happening from windows settings. It can be fixed by changing text scaling and whatnot.
---
The funny thing is, killers do it too, they just don't realise it.
---
Every time you've closed the hatch and nodded, or fake mori'd over and over again, or followed the survivor until endgame timer runs out, or slashed on the hook, or trapped survivor in a corner to spam your ability, or body blocked the basement, or carried survivor over the hatch and done a little dance you're doing exactly the same thing: You're taunting/bragging about winning the interaction. Exactly the same way survivors teabag when they reach the exit. It's nothing new. It's just more common with survivors since there's 4 of them.
---
I might get downvoted for this but I feel like that should hit, at least in real life it would
---
Always happy to help a player trying to improve, good luck in your future matches brother
---
Yep, saw it, doesn't help.
---
Inner Strength still requires a totem and staying in a locker for quite a while to work tho
---
Exactly, it should trigger from a health state changing.
---
Devs Have said, Custom games Do not Get You banned, If You Are Not Hacking.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/58556/high-dpi-monitors-w-text-scaling-causes-mouse-input-issues
---
Also this one. Either way, seems to directly relate to windows and monitor settings.
---
I really want a pirate killer. A skeleton with a sword or perhaps a pirate with a thick beard and a parrot on his shoulder. Maybe it could even take place on a ship or a port or something idk seemed cool and I love pirate themed stuff
---
It's more of how extremely helpless he had to have felt. He told me he didn't like games that punished new players so severely. It's sad when a fanbase is slowly destroying the game they based their community off of because they want to take pride in bullying new players out of it. I can almost guarantee that this isn't uncommon.
---
Jeff is pretty much just another edgy teenager, and ever since Sundance Rejects reminded me of his "backstory" I just can't take him seriously.
---
Rake, well, it's a bit too late to have the "feral monster" type of killer.
---
It has to be a creepypasta killer that stands out, fits the game, and doesn't make people cringe.
---
this is actually a pretty good Idea... it would make nurse less annoying to go against and her addons wouldn't be as broken anymore
---
Isn't active for 90-95% of the match
---
Can be countered by Survivors touching bones (No excuse now that survivors have Inner Strength)
---
Probably only going to get 1 Survivor with NOED a good amount of the time unless the Killer built for end game or Survivors majorly screw up
---
Survivors have Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Unbreakable, every Exhaustion Perk
---
I disabled scaling, I forced the game to run in fullscreen. Bug is still there.
---
&gt; Balance is favored towards survivors 
---
Wat. Obviously you've not been part of the community very long. 
---
Survivors haven't had a single buff since I can remember. Every balance change is always a nerf to survivor. The only time survivors catch a break is when they release new DLC which includes strong perks (which they nerf in a few weeks), or when they accidentally bug a perk and it makes survivors better until; it's fixed (wake up).
---
Survivors are forever nerfed. Killers are forever buffed. Yet still people think survivors are OP. 
---
Eventually they'll just remove windows and pallets and killer mains will finally think the game is balanced.
---
Bbq and chilli and we are gonna live forever at the ready
---
Is it legion?
---
Hex Ruin is the perk the hag (flesh and mud dlc) gives you for killers
---
&gt;t I tried to look at the main page and scrolled down through a fuck ton of shitty reposted memes
---
[x] Doubt. 
---
Someone literally just asked 7 threads ago.
---
&gt;burn all survivors to the ground
---
so you're saying you want to be toxic now aswell and play try hard against people who play normally ?
---
By that logic devour is a waste they'll pop it in 30 seconds
---
Thank you kind sir!
---
My favorite is when I jump from a 2 story house window start falling down and still somehow my ass gets hit
---
These are creative ideas, but to be honest the learning curve is pretty steep for this game as it is with three currencies, killers with unique powers, learning their addons as well, all the perks (along with the teachability system), all the status effects... making each killer a seperate game mode would all but ensure attrition of new players.  I think the formula as it is works nicely.  I have my nitpicky things about balance and so on, but the game doesn't feel fundamentally broken or unbalanced to me as it does to others.
---
If you think about playing killer, Leatherface DLC is the only one I'd consider mandatory. BBQ &amp; Chili is a perk I use on every killer. Every other DLC is optional, depending on which killer you want to play.
---
OTZ IS THAT YOU?
---
You say that, but since it's implementation have perks not been released with bloodlust in mind. So removing bloodlust world mean a complete rebalance of the game.
---
Moar like fan FART!
---
You make a hit list of toxic survivors? I'd honestly take note of this and just tunnel them hard all game.
---
My favorite time is playing Legion with Franklin's Demise against 4 flashlights. They get so angry they can't just spam click their flashlight at you.
---
I thought this was common knowledge ? If you blind a frenzy legion it knocks him out of frenzy without a stun penalty,
---
Phenomenal!! I'm hyped. (If it ever were to happen)
---
Did they fix the instant execution that ppl love to do? That’s why I stopped playing
---
Why? For me game with 5 streamers plays exactly the same as a game with a single streamer. And same as a game with no BP offerings at all.
---
Any blood point offerings that get put up stack with the 2x BP. Burn them whenever possible. Max out your categories where possible. Accept the fact a lot of killers save their Moris for blood hunt.
---
Desktop
---
That last part I didn’t know 😳
---
Okay. I sent you a link for application specific mouse input lag. That might help? I hope so.
---
It’s not uncommon to see 4 BPS put up with an ebony mori.
---
What add-ons/perks do you use on try hard Freddy?
---
I agree with much of what you say, but I don't think I'm missing the point, as I think you're misrepresenting a lot of the complaints that go around in this community.  I genuinely do see a lot of complaint about survivors just, you know, winning.  Yeah, teabagging is dumb and I never do it.  But killers gloat too.  This is a problem in video game communities (and youth generally), not players of one role of one video game. And the whole drama of the game is the survivors are the "good guys" in horror movie terms, who are fragile but through teamwork overcome the trial.  So I don't see what's so upsetting about mashing "crouch."  
---
Body blocking hooks and decisive strike are genuine parts of the game.  I find them frustrating when they happen to me as killer, and ditto for flashlights, but that's because they hamper my progress or goals just like getting hit or hooked does for survivors.  But when the entire game is the killer trying to stun/immobilize/end the game for the survivor, I just don't get why stuns bother killers so much.
---
Your kind of people is always first to comment, thanks for not answering my question. Kinda wish you guys had such hateful passion towards those low effort and reposted memes.
---
Must cleanse, need those 1500 boldness points 😍
---
&gt;  Accept the fact a lot of killers save their Moris for blood hunt.
---
Why? Do Moris give more points? I never really noticed that and I have a stack of Moris for my killer that I never used because I always use BP Offerings to get more BPs...
---
I will just play my normal game. Farming is boring. The only change will be using "global" BP offerings (Bloody Party Streamers or Gruesome Gateaus) more often.
---
I block toxic players on steam and before a game open the profile of each survivor and see if I blocked them already. If I did I mori them, it's pretty rare to meet the same survivor twice though. The few times I recognized someone they were nice in the previous match so I made sure they got hatch on next one.
---
The 8 pages!
---
I’d say it’s to end games faster and get into the next one.
---
"my kind"
---
If you look at the other thread posted literally less than an hour ago, I actually answered the question. It doesn't hurt one bit to do a quick search or just look through a few threads before making an already answered question.
---
They don’t, they generally give you less as they hurt your chances of getting more points in chase and brutality. It’s all about the killjoy factor.
---
\~Let's be toxic\~
---
If you took the time to read the patch notes for 3.2.1 hotfix patch then you will read that at the bottom there is a "Known Issue" of EGC timer not being consistent between host and players.
---
While I have not encountered your issue, I know it exists because I read the patch notes.
---
I'm not talking about words. If  you don't understand what I'm talking about then you are part of the problem.
---
I've thought about what powers he could have, since he's a straightforward slasher killer in the films.  He does get stunned a lot and rebounds, so maybe he could have a perk that acquires tokens every time he is stunned, and after so many tokens x happens (exposed status effect, something else).  As for his power, projectiles are obvious but we already have Huntress.  I'm trying to remember the films more clearly to come up with something.
---
I wish totems were replaced with 2018 plants.
---
His power is sending his parrot out to locate survivors.
---
I'm glad you understand what I'm talking about. I deeply enjoy dead by daylight as a game, and when I come across good players it makes me so happy but as of recently, they've been far and few between.
---
THIS NEEDS MORE UPVOTES, AND TO BE POSTED ON ALL SOCIAL MEDIA! Ahem, sorry bout that.
---
I'd like H20 and part 2 myers, shirtless myers is stupid xD
---
"Someone stabbed you in the stomach? just dont get hurt" this is what you sound like
---
You’re the problem, that’s a reasonable response I gave you but you’re being a dick about it. If you honestly get emotionally hurt by what happens in a game then you need to grow up and get a reality check,seriously.
---
Lmao he’s so cute, just stops, looks around and is like NOPE.
---
I was just saying to my friend ''I hope a dev sees it'' xD
---
That's not farming for me. I don't let survivors do gens standing near them. I don't let them unhook/heal each other in front of me. I'm playing normal game. Going for 12 hooks is not farming.
---
I haven’t gotten less then a 3k with Freddy since his rework, at red ranks, his slow down and his terror radius are incredible, and he can go from one side of the map to the other in 5 seconds with no stun.
---
Again, it isn't a learning curve issue, it's a community issue. Not everyone has the same experiences, but when a 4 stack uses their new friend to get lower rank killers, and they go out of their way to completely ruin the game for the new player they're playing against because they think it's funny, I can see why he didn't want to continue, and it's ignorant to say that type of behavior doesn't effect someone's first impression of the game in a very negative light.
---
OP isn't talking about the chat, it seems, it's more about how people "treat each other in game". I agree though. It's a game so if people pressing certain keys upsets you it probably says more about you than other people. The issue is everyone expects other people to change their behaviour but in reality more people need to stop being so emotional over something that is not controversial.
---
Ah yes, shit talking isnt toxic. Great logic
---
103% they where for the 3 year anniversary.
---
He'd have so many cosmetics
---
DbD is more horror-themed than actual horror. More focus on gameplay, less on spectacle or eww factor
---
It is a gamble tho. 
---
especially with fucking prayer beads
---
exactly ! I see survivors complain about NOED a lot on the forums but just cleanse the dang totems ! you get 5K bonus BP !
---
2018 plants ?
---
ladder scene is still one of my favorite scenes just for music alone
---
It’s not broken, if they wanna play swf with someone who isn’t good at the game then that’s their problem, but a low rank killer shouldn’t have to suffer because they wanna play swf. It’s better how it is now but all the swf are complaining because their swf buddies can’t stay alive for 5 seconds
---
oh ! must have happened during my 6 monthes break xD
---
What is toxic in this game, in your opinion? Genuinely curious.
---
Oink.
---
One day
---
Yes, it will always be broken. Because when you have someone with 5 hours in the game on same team with a 2000 hours veteran, there's no way to find a "fair" match. 700 hour killer? He'll probably be destroyed by a veteran, but he'll surely destroy novices.
---
i agree my friend ended up getting ddos after the game cause the guy got mad that he did not win
---
I don’t see what can happen in game that can upset someone. The killer treats you as if he was gonna kill you and survivors treat you as if they’re you’re their sworn enemy, simple. Shouldn’t be a bond between killer and survivor.
---
Dude did you come from the future or something!? Dedicated servers were "supposed" to come out during summer but it got delayed. There is no ping bar in the lower right corner and it was not added in 2.7.0
---
This is true, but I’m talking about those who aren’t in swf who get paired with swf
---
Since I play on console, I have no endgame chat.  From what I hear, I'm happy about that.  It would be demoralizing to be ridiculed non-stop when you're trying to recreate.  I guess playing on console, you are always just guessing the disposition or intentions of other players so it's possibly easier to let things roll off your back.  Not that I don't get really frustrated in the heat of the moment sometimes, but it's very easy to leave it behind when the match ends.
---
I’m talking about those who get paired up with ppl who play swf
---
I shouldn’t, it’s not the Jedi way
---
lol, is this a joke?
---
Survivor: Prove Thyself, WGLF, Self Care, Botany Knowledge, medkit w/ extra charges
---
Killer: BBQ, Thrilling Tremors, Corrupt Intervention, PGTW
---
There’s a de sync between the killers timer and the survivors timer, it’s a known problem
---
I think it's ignorant to assume everyone has the same level of will and is motivated by the same things.
---
Like I said, in a fighting game a GOOD PLAYER who could have beat me HONESTLY, beat me by spamming one move.
---
Learn to deal with it or lose. Those are your options.
---
Hmmm how so? I don’t think so unless I’m wrong
---
Those are the perks that are called "meta".
---
As everyone else says here, the two most important killer perks on a DLC are bbq and ruin.
---
DS is on shrine so if you play enough before next Tuesday you can buy it for 2000 iridescent shards and won't have to buy the dlc for its sake.
---
I don't get it. What are you agreeing with? You're saying the person who ddos'd you shouldn't have gotten upset? Or that toxicity is justification for going completely psycho?
---
Isnt that the dude who got humiliated on stream by the old flashlights?
---
\*fakes a window vault\*
---
Feng: YOU UTTER FOOL!
---
\*vaults again\*
---
\*gets grabbed\*
---
Huntress: no u
---
saying that OP is right and ppl need to take the game less seriously lol sorry for not being clear enough
---
There's a difference between a friend teaching you beneficially, and a group of randoms exploiting the grouping system to ruin your game for amusement my man. There's also a difference between a fighting game and an asymmetrical objective based "horror" game. You might have the motivation to keep pushing through the abuse from someone you know, but assuming you're better than people who want to move to a game they enjoy instead of put up with a bunch of little shits is kinda ignorant in itself. Not everyone has the same amount of patience. Some people want to play a game because they want to have fun, not to put their gaming experiences on their resume.

This is from MKX and it’s Jason’s ending from tower mode.

cute boi

There’s pop goes which is good too

Decisive strike is on this week shrine, so if you don't care about Laurie and Myers you could just spend 2000 shards to get the perk
---
Babydwights rise up

His power isn't really that great, yesterday I actually played vs one which doesn't happen often and even getting hit by that bottle isn't really gonna disable you or anything.
---
I had some major difficulties yesterday, every match I would DC or someone else would during loading. Happened for around 8 matches/lobbies in a row. I restarted and it seemed to help. PC BTW.

---
Heathens will be given to quarter. Kill them all, and let God sort them out. 
---
(Also you didn't read the part where I said new players are to be spared)
---
Another weak link has left the game 🤣
---
I think the game could use a unranked mode.
---
who said they would add all the Jasons and all the survivors?
---
For real tho?
---
Pretty sure you get banned from twitch if you twerk on stream
---
Bodyblocking in and of itself is not reportable, so absent any other information in your report it would just disappear into the ether.
---
As for griefing:
---
&gt; ## Griefing: Intentional Gameplay Abuse
---
&gt;
---
&gt; * **Working with the opposite team to gain an advantage or grief teammates**
---
&gt; * **Targeting specific users repeatedly in order to ruin their game experience**
---
If your account of events is *what you personally witnessed* then the killer would need to be reported too, since they "worked with the opposite team" by both downing the survivor and by hooking them. I say "personally witnessed" because:
---
&gt; You may only report things that happen directly to you or in a game that you were in.
---
&gt; Reporting for other people is not allowed and these reports will be discarded.
---
If you didn't see the events at the gate then your report is invalid.
---
The above is all according to "the letter of the law". **The moral aspect is entirely apart from that.** Would you report a killer and survivor if they were given the hatch? Would you stay in the map if *you* were given the hatch? Would you refuse to participate in "farming" even when everyone else in the trial signals for it? Would you let a survivor walk out untouched after they displayed "bad manners" if the only way to hit them involved their own team intentionally sandbagging them?
---
If the answer to the above examples is "No", then you're a hypocrite - but being a hypocrite doesn't mean you should or shouldn't report players. "They deserved it" is a moral argument, not a legal one.
---
Last survivor can just hide in the locker and you can't do nothing about it.
---
Nvidia graphics cards, you can apply filters to the games so they look brighter =\]
---
For some reason I have been able to get 4ks with Wrath quite a lot, maybe it's just because they underestimate Wrath so much and try to troll, til you hang em up in the basement, Wrath is really great for snowballing sometimes.
---
for changing perk icons nah so many ppl do it. but for tweaking the brightness to make it even brighter then the game allows idk
---
Playing killer that’s only truly viable with one add-on can be just a very shit experience.. (Old clown main)
---
The 1/2 terror radius seems like a strong point of his build yeah, and mostly i use the teleport to chase survs towards a gen and teleport while chasing them so i can head them off.
---
WHY DO SURVIVORS FEEL SO ENTITLED TO GET THE HATCH WHEN THEY LOST?
---
That's exactly what I was going to suggest. I do it myself. I'm a rank 10 survivor and there is no way I want to get destroyed by the red ranks, especially as I only have around 70 hours played compared to peoples 100s and 1000s of hours. Shit I still can't loop for the life of me, I can only hide. (not a sneakette).
---
Yes they did, you need 1 recycle at least now, and executions and recycles are the same reward so theres no real point executing early or else you will either cut the game short with hunter dom or the scavs will go uber stealth and wait for time out.  
---
Only dumb fucks insta execute.
---
Dude! I'm on ps4 and every round as survivor after the last person escapes it shows the killer dc'd. Now, my gf and I play SWF in same room with 2 tv's and sometimes it'll show they gave points to the killer on one account and on the other account it'll show a DC. I have no clue what the deal is but damn, right before double blood points. I just started noticing this yesterday
---
How you gonna tell someone their feelings aren't valid?
---
Who made you philosopher in chief, knower of all things nirvana?
---
You are most definitely a problem in life, and probably the game, too.

Ohhhhhhh thank you! I was looking at the top of the hooks thinking what is there like an eye or something?
---
well that is good it was annoying waiting 5 mins just to die right away
---
I think this is my only upvote for a 6ix9ine post
---
Does he get huge points for just being in chases, or chasing in frenzy, or is it that you just chase a lot of people?
---
Yep well we found who to the toxic one is. Shows that you’re to immature to take shit from people.
---
This would be great
---
Haha yes! I can honestly say that I genuinely get the shit scared out of me if The Demogorgon traverses behind me somewhere (and I'm not paying attention) and I'm not playing any detection perks and right before you get hit, you hear the big ass hooves stomping up behind you
---
lol, console
---
well they still are working on it after all hopefully it will be improved
---
Had this happen last night, also on PS4.
---
5 blinks is trash. Change my mind.
---
I lol'd way too hard at this
---
they are just waiting Friday the 13th the game to die so they can ask for rights to do that
---
Lmao I thought you were the other guy telling me to kill myself. Getting mixed up now. I was responding to him as if it was you. Small little things like a teabag or a sandbag isn’t much though. I mean I don’t think it is but I guess some people do
---
We get 39.99$ nintendo switch version instead
---
lol what a dick
---
I'm not sure what it is about the Demogorgon but he's the one killer that scares the hell out of me when I'm being chased by him
---
bro i'm so over these freakin concepts psyching me out
---
Get out!!
---
Just take my money and make this chapter
---
Lol no problem - no need to apologise! Haha. I entirely agree with you in that case.
---
I never understood the toxicity. My friends and I played together, but hey we werent even that great but never treated the killer like shit.
---
Literally I could feel this post. No matter how many times I’ve successfully vaulted and get whacked by the killer it never fails to make me go ???
---
also bamboozle
---
Things like this. This post is why people continue to do it. It's a game it's fine to get upset at a loss but you have to move on to the next match or take a break. Making posts about how upset you are and they should be better well do nothing but feed them. Ignoring them and only commenting on things you enjoy or issues with the game is what will get the community to be better. That's my two cents anyways.
---
“People were mean to my friend so I’m gonna be mean to everyone else!!!” 
---
Mature.

11/10 would main all day. I don’t even play survivor, but if my girl Breda is in? Switching territories boys and girls.

I'm gonna be honest when I say I lost patience with you survivors. I'm not saying this isn't going to spread toxicity, at this point, after going against so many toxic survivor mains, I'm convinced the majority of you are irredeemable.
---
To be honest i can see BHVR never abandoning DeathGarden, they didnt abandon DbD after 4 years, theyre persistent.
---
Some people just can't deal as well. It's cool you've got thick skin but you're still making excuses for people's shit behaviour. The problem is people being toxic, not people complaining about toxicity.
---
Ngl that was satisfying
---
Yes it's annoying as fuck
---
Im actually happy that it became a passive ability. Its been more fun for me
---
You're a nonce
---
Yeah it tremendously increases friendly ghosts in your life!
---
I had an anxiety attack just witnessing it. I can't imagine your live terror.
---

But Disney bad!!
---
I don't mean to support teabagging, but why do people get so annoyed by teabagging? In every online game people taunt the other side, and no one gets so trigerred like people do in dbd. In other online games there is literally taunt buttons,  it doesn't exist in dbd so people teabag.
---
Killer FOV really be like that sometimes..
---
It’s been said like two comments before mine XD
---
Because giving people shit is so mature on its own?
---
Also, your double downvote strategy shows you have an alt account.
---
Nice.
---
That probably explains the times people have teabagged then died to entity. I’d always thought they were just doing friendly teabags and giving me the win :(.
---
How often are dlc released? I just got the game a week ago because of the stranger things dlc and it’s all I’ve been playing
---
Rules set #2 should be base with pig. Add-on should be reworked to notify the killer when the survivor fails the box and % decrease change of getting it off.
---
removed we do not tolerate that kind of thing on this sub ever
---
September 26th 5pm PST pretty sure.
---
I got downed by a Myers yesterday through a window + about a yard and a half of running straight away from the window I vaulted. I was so confused.
---
Yeah trapper is their jason
---
Hey, I saw that! There was a point where someone ran the infinite again, but did a slow vault, but he still missed the hit and Otz got angry (and I got really scared xD)
---
What rank are you currently playing? Atm, I play a lot of Clown because I think he has a lot of potential because you can make loops shorter or cut them off completely. I'm Rank 5 at the moment. Still experimenting with perks on him
---
Trapper already is Jason for them
---
Salute, Claudia
---
I listen to Spotify sometimes on my tv when I play on ps4. I use empathy/bond to know where the killer is. I’ll turn it off if it’s a stealth killer
---
&gt;  The issue is everyone expects other people to change their behaviour but in reality more people need to stop being so emotional over something that is not controversial.
---
Slashtreet boys would be complete...
---
Yeah, but legion can stab you multiple times without you going down (in frenzy)
---
happened me yesterday
---
I thought 3 was the max now?
---
People being toxic in game is apart of game play, seriously it’s a bit of BM and people are acting like it ruins their whole entire day. Like seriously, little kids have this sort of behaviour. It’s not having thick skin it’s just being mature. We aren’t talking about post game chat where some people may take offence for people being cunts btw. But either way shouldn’t let it affect you is what I’m saying like some guy on this exact thread just told me to kill myself, am I gonna let this little degenerate get to me and annoy me, course not. It’s laughable
---
Lol I downvoted you. And I'll probably do it again.
---
gg ez l2p
---
As Well as inner strength
---
Just say you killed him. **JuSt SaY iT!!!**
---
Did you just say the demogorgon has hooves
---
Toxicity hasn't really spread on mobile yet,maybe because post endgame chat is not a feature yet.But recently,I have been seeing some farming survivors who just unhooks their friend RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME which ends up killing them.I feel the pain those guys went through for that.
---
Feel like some killers go out of their way to make people not wanna play dbd then complain about queue times. This community blows me away.
---
I'm mad I'm actually laughing at a 6ix9ine post.
---
It used to be that people felt shame for showing weakness. Now it is encouraged. Don't get me wrong, if you're struggling there is nothing at all wrong with seeking help. But over a game? Cripes.
---
Whenever You Go to A Match, Reset The lobby After the match, Everyone leave lobby and create a new one and itll work just like the old lobby worked, thats a bug that you cannot find 2 matches with the same lobby or someone will leave out of the game..
---
Mostly survivor, but I also have played killer. I did read most people experience frame loss as killer. Maybe I'll have to kyf as killer to see Ann's choose the lab
---
Are you taking the piss? You just told me to kill my self. You think people are gonna upvote that.
---
It's more of a terror game.
---
How old are you, seriously? Do you have any manners, respect, or even empathy?
---
What's wrong with having so much shit IRL that shitty people like you make games unplayable due to the sheer agony from being shat on every minute of every hour when you're incapable of imagining someone else's emotions due to being so far up your own ass?
---
Seriously, do you have anything to say besides, "They're strangers, they can't hurt you unless you're weak."
---
Lmao ima take the bait, if one side wins 70-80% the other side wins 30-20%
---
Imagine complaining that people use borrowed and ds.  If the killer isn't a scumbag both of these perks are useless.
---
Does anyone else find it somewhat ironic it’s a map he’s trying to find?
---
I mean, sure, that’s more correct and i still want Prayer Beads to instead only make the wooshing noise non-directional, but versus a regular Spirit you really aren’t gambling. They’re still real people that make mistakes.
---
How is dropping a pallet scummy ?
---
They just announced that dedicated servers were delayed to autumn 2019. You are just talking out of your ass
---
Otz has gotten 4ks with clown. And fungoose has lost matches lol idk why people like to act like 1 streamer is a God and the rest are just meh at the game. All the big ones are pretty damn good. No one 4ks every single game.
---
Google "Marble Hornets"  it's probably the best Slenderman experience(?) It's a video series that came out in 2015 I think. Genuinely scary.
---
and they wont do it due to the friday the 13th game
---
but if one of your teammate heals, you fucked, or heal aswell
---
The 2nd perk seems really strong on high terror radius UP doc, and makes ruin/lullaby even more deadly and i love it.
---
His 2nd power seems a bit strong on mindgames and forces precise pallet drops or drops and run, and we know from spirit experience, survivors are gonna hate it... i love it tho.
---
Yeah i thought thats why they made their own jason
---
Wait so does shred just break pallets now without the add-on? Is this real life? The Devs actually implemented a buff to a killer????
---
yes there is. search for a game and you will see it.
---
Nice cropping?
---
His 1st power also seems a better spirit, o have a question tho... what it happens if time runs down and u are bellow something? Like a dropped palllet, a wall orlike a pile of tires?
---
Clearly one half of the dev team is strictly Survivor and the other half is Strictly Killer and they don't like listening to each other. /s
---
What the FUCK. You are so ignorant my dude.
---
Level up ur hag and nurse to lv 40. Use ruin nurses sloppy with any other perk of preference. Without these perks u r at a disadvantage
---
A: That's like saying you get emotional over a hand open and closing when you're really being pummeled by a fist.
---
B: at least you stopped calling me names, so maybe you can learn respect and sportsmanship one day.
---
C: Why do you care if people are upset when they can't enjoy a game that's easily accessible? If you truly thought people were weak, you wouldn't have said anything and just been happy that it's one more last post by someone too sensitive; instead, you're telling people how weak they are and how much better you are by comparison. That attitude is the issue.
---
You can just add the flair. Dont need to repost
---
maybe like, the more you see it the more "crazy" you get, the more "crazy" you get the more slenderman you gonna see, the more slenderman you see the more a "bar" charges, if the bar completes it's like you're getting hitted, only way to tier down is to do something like Freddy, ou need to collect pages which spawns only for you if you're "crazy"
---
I feel like some survivors go out of their way go make new players uninstall the game because they want to be toxic 4 stacks.
---
You have 70 hours and are already rank 7?
---
I WISH !!!!
---
It’s piss easy to rank up in killer.
---
omg this looks amazing! do you have this in a higher resolution? I'd love to use this as my phone background
---
I personally don't think it would fit well. Maybe it is just the way I perceive slenderman as quite meme-y. But they did add ghostface I suppose.
---
&gt;  While charging blink be able to see the aura of healthy survivors within range of what you currently have charged
---
Are you crazy?
---
Double Bloodpoints are coming today for the weekend. I would highly advise you to level up some other killers to get some meta stuff. Focusing too much on one killer is bad, I did it with Wraith when I started and then I found myself in a similar situation like you.
---
Did you not pick some stuff up from the Shrine? At 70 hours you definitely should have enough shards for multiple perks.
---
I don´t see what is bad about NOED. You don´t need to "rely" on it,  treat it as insurance. It definitely is better than Iron Grasp IMO. And if you don´t have good perks, why not use it?
---
Sloppy Butcher is another good perk that could help you. The more times survivors have to spend healing, the less time they spend doing gens. Although that does not help the early game, it does slow the mid-game down. Even if you lose 2 gens very early, you can often manage to make the rest of them hell.
---
Yeah, blinding a legion will break him out of frenzy without making him go through the stun animation. I first learned this when a survivor blinded me when I hopped across a pallet and smacked her only to see her go down. I was so confused at first.
---
Happened same for me. Whenever i try to have fun with a low-tier killer, like Legion or Clown and using fun perks, i would get a sweaty and toxic rank 1 gen rush team. I even receive messages on ps4 after that and they spam the "follow - unfollow" option on my profile so i have endless notifications on top of my screen when i play the next game. This is so fucking annoying. So after that i make sure to play my Pig with anti bullying perks: Franklin's, noed, Haunted Grounds, and a mori, even though i hate this. People shit their pants and yell at nurse and Spirit yet they play really trash whenever it's a weaker killer. Then they wonder why we get HillBilly Nurse and Spirit with the best builds every time at red ranks. So hilarious but so sad. 
---
At the same time, at BHVR's: *refuses to give Pig, Legion, Clown, Leatherface, and Wraith what they truly deserve*
---
Here we have, you average reddit killer main.
---
Perhaps its time to git gud my dude
---
I don't wanna speak for the parent reply, but for me post game chat is toxic. SWF that complain about getting mori'd even when it was just one; they say trashy things.
---
There is also the issue of bullying a killer at low ranks when you're a much better survivor than your rank is, but whether or not that is toxic is gray, since it is kinda set in stone via rank reset anyway.
---
If you lost on purpose so you can play with the less skillful survivors/killers at their expense, it is toxic. I hope the most recent skew towards high rank killers helps with this issue, too, but I don't see it being fixed outright.
---
While I understand the concern, it seems the best thing for new people is to go in solo, maybe have their friend watch them via discord stream or such and help out that way till the person is more comfortable. However both have their issues as we may even start to see people de-ranking on purpose to accomplish the same thing they did before, not that they were not doing it already.
---
I am not talking about how players message each other. Words are words, they mean very little. I am talking about the behavior exhibited throughout matches.
---
&gt;Also we already have trapper
---
I'll probably never understand this argument, like how is Trapper similiar to Jason? Bear traps were never Jason's main weapon. Also we have Billy and Bubba, which are way more similiar.
---
I picked up what I could at the shrine, but most of them were survivor perks like iron will and DS. I grabbed Shadowborn today but I'm not sure how great that is for me.
---
I guess I'll give noed another shot instead of iron grasp. Sloppy butcher doesn't proc on my hatchets I think?
---
I'll definitely grind for double BP this week, thanks.
---
Is this a Rose McGowan cosmetic ?
---
People with amazing internet that rivals streamers and pro players and wired connections still have severe connection and optimization issues with this game. Especially on console. Obtain a grip.
---
Just keep playing him. You'll get bullied for the first few games then it all clicks
---
Show me where this is documented as being a widespread issue
---
A bloody nose would be far too hard to see in game due to size of the affected area. That's not getting into seeing it on Prestige cosmetics.
---
Wow very accurate look-a-like. Lol just some funny glitch I came across
---
Stop. Making. This. A. Fact. Template. YOU FUCKING IDIOT
---
&gt; Don't hate the player. Hate the game.
---
Sure. Because there's no way to be successful in this game without using toxic mechanics... You nailed it.
---
I present to you:
---
THIS SUBREDDIT.
---
I wish this would happen.  He’s all that’s left to make the complete set of horror icons.  Getting Jason would be like when we Smash Bros just got Banjo Kazooie lol
---
Never mind, I'll delete the question....Not sure if you read my post, the team mate I saw INTENTIONALLY sandbagged him. I was at the exit gates and witnessed the whole event.When I clicked the report button, it's CLEARLY listed under griefing... I quote "-Blocking other survivors intentionally to put them in harms way (sandbagging)." This is what happened and is against the rules. Crouching up and down is not. Though it's dickish like I said. All of the questions you asked me is not bannable, as it isn't griefing/trolling. If the farming foesn't affect the other players or they all agree beforehand, even that is not bannable. As for your last question I wouldn't personally, as bming doesn't bother me much, but if they officially screw up, then they're going on that hook LOL.
---
rules.) And no, in this case the killer obviously wasn't working with the survivor the whole match. Stupid of me to ask, should just research myself next time. Thanks any way.
---
Exactly the kind of response I imagined.
---
Get your dial-up ass internet comments out my inbox.
---
WOO is great when you're playing with below average teammates who can't conserve pallet usage.   Love to run it during rank reset.
---
It’s just the way you’re like humans have emotions and all that but talking about bad manners in a match. BM can be annoying and all that it everyone does i

---
Would r/croppingishard work here or is that just for no cropping?
---
A community for a game where you slaughter innocents
---
All torn apart of FMAB 3...
---
Read further down, of course there is a way, but why wouldn't you use the best way? What's stopping you from using what the developers themselves put in the game?
---
Thats definitely a leak of Tony Hawk's perks.
---
LMFAOOO i love this xD
---
This bug appears today.
---
Wait what are toxic mechanics? First time I ever heard someone say this
---
This would be beautiful, but your a Legion main so it sucks.
---
If this is how you act, you are part of the problem of toxicity in this community. Never turn on someone just because you disagree with their opinion. This is absolutely childish. Only constructive responses make progress and prevoke further understanding on the subject, turning the "it's just words" card shows how apathetic you are towards other humans feelings. Words may be words but they also hold deeper meanings and intentions than the speaker might think they do. So choose words wisely.
---
Your replies go to my inbox you stupid cunt.
---
I’ll ask again, can you show me where this is documented as being a widespread issue? Especially since this sounds like such a game breaking bug for so many users(And it’s been around for yeaaars apparently), it should surely be on BHVR’s bug report forum? I’m sure you’ll find it easy for me.
---
As a killer main i think NOED sucks, its a waste of a perk slot and it should even be in the game at its current state, however NOED is in fact the perk that better portraits DBD as a game, i know this is strange but hear me out.
---
DBD is a game where "Death is not an Escape" right? And you should not be able to escape it, which makes NOED, the most "game defining" perk, cuz thats the core ideia behind the game.
---
But, even at its state it doesnt fullfill the role cuz it doesnt allow to kill survivors (im not saying it should, it would just be a DH that doesnt need to be stacked like that).
---
I think the best ideoa would just straight out remove it, tho it plays so much in the game fantasy thats its a sin to say so...
---
But its a shitty perk, its a waste of a perkslot, u should want to finish the game asap, b4 objectives are even completed, playing for that late game its just, no, NOED will mostly liekly get u a down, if u even get one, and then a facecamp and thats a fact. And its nor even guaranteed to work, cuz survivors can just cleanse dull totems.
---
Theres no way to change the perk and still make it fullfill the perk fantasy, so i  dunno, either keep it the same way and everyone will keep on complaining, or just straight remove it and everyone will complain anyway
---
OH BOY, WHERE DO I BEGIN? IS IT THE LONG-ASS LOBBY WAIT TIMES? IS IT THE FACT THAT WHENEVER IT'S JUST TWO SURVIVORS LEFT, YOU CAN REST ASSURED THE OTHER SURVIVOR IS JUST JERKING OFF ON THE HATCH OR RUNNING AROUND LOOKING FOR IT WHILE I'M TRYING TO DO A GEN? MAYBE IT'S THE FACT THAT I KEEP SEEMING TO HAVE AUDIO BUGS BUT NO ONE ELSE IS GETTING THEM? OR HOW BOUT HOW I HAD A HUNTRESS HATCHET ME LEGIT RIGHT AFTER I COULD CONTROL MY CHAR? OR MAYBE I SHOULD BITCH ABOUT HOW I'M NOT GETTING ENOUGH WEDDING RINGS OFF MY BLOODWEB? LIKE, COME ON, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO WOO THESE KILLERS IF I DON'T HAVE A TRIPLE DIGIT STACK OF WEDDING RINGS? IT'S NOT LIKE I'M AN ITEM HOARDER AND I DO NOT HAVE A PROBLEM, I JUST NEED THINGS LIKE THESE 91 PURPLE KEYS, JUST IN CASE I RUN OUT. SO I NEED WEDDING RINGS SO I CAN MARRY THE DOCTOR AND THE DEMOGORGON!
---
This happens to every survivor when i hook them as doc haha
---
Hehe, last time I played 3 gen Doc survivors told me to kill my whole family after the game. They for sure love playing against this.
---
I'd love to see something among those line. Make it so that the gauge charges tremendously faster if the killer is standing still, and this could be hell of fun to play as, and against.
---
It sometimes feels that way lol.
---
I think that they aren't good survivors and don't take input from players that are. There are so many small balance changes that the community wants and the devs think that it will break the game lol
---
BEFORE THE PATCH I WAS RANK 14 OR THEREABOUTS AND WAS CONSISTENTLY GETTING MATCHED UP WITH RED RANKS. AFTER THE PATCH I'M NOW RANK 11 AND HAVE BEEN GETTING MATCHED UP WITH GREY RANKS, EVEN SOME CLEARLY NEW RANK 20s. WTF DEVS
---
New Survivor perk: Just A Fucking Gun
---
Duude, thats the worst thing you would say to someone
---
Don't worry, ILY too &lt;3
---
Kill it before it lays eggs
---
People bind keymacros to spam the flashlight 100x per second and follow you, the killer - so while you’re doing your thing a really good looper is around the pallet spamming *click* 100x per second to annoy you
---
Probably wouldn’t happen because of the terrible game “Friday the 13th: the game”
---
&lt;3
---
Wow! I'd love to see that lol! This is the first time I ever encountered the glitch! Huntress's aim was good enough to axe off my hair 😂
---
Bruh key bindings, my struggle is down scroll wheel
---
I've been trying to show you why those words are exactly what you should not do, but you're just doing your best to make yourself and me look like an ass.
---
Please, post the screenshot. I typed a string of toxic words to mock you for mocking someone upset over toxicity. You got your panties in a wad, and here you are typing emojis like it means something. At least if you post the pic, people will see what I said despite it being removed.
---
A: So you see why your point is useless? Character models and community behavior are literally two different things! Yes! That is the case! Also, what do you know about mental harm? You shouldn't be certain that cyberbullying in general is a harmless fad.
---
B: What? Do you even English? If you knew what respect and sportsmanship was, this thread would have been a LOT shorter.
---
C: That in itself is both immature and wrong. Saying someone is immature for having emotions is basically the same thing. You're being pedantic in a straw grasp argument, its not gonna work.
---
Finally, the only thing stupid I've said was when I was mocking you. It got me nowhere, sadly, but it showed that you can be toxic even as a "keyboard warrior" that nobody knows. I'm calling this one quits, though. You clearly have no desire to make the community a better place for anyone, just lording *your* superiority over others as they struggle to cope with what might be yet another shit show in their life.
---
well sadly it's just an overpaint so this is the max resolution ^^
---
 Spelt “Myers” as “Meyers” and I took that as a sign of disrespect. I was loving it till that part but then you can fuck off &lt;3 love u
---
These are all really good. The one for spirit would be really cool to see in the game.
---
Not sure what you mean, every pig I face puts it on my head and then tunnels me slugging me every time I try to remove it.
---
Seems like a good buff for the pigs I play against lmao.
---
JUST TAKE MY UPVOTE
---
That doesn’t even make sense you thick piece of shit.
---
So what I’ve gathered is, is that this bug doesn’t actually exist and it’s just your third world internet. 
---
Also your replies go through my inbox where all my messages are curated you weeb cunt.
---
Ah, I see my mistake
---
No, it's not the best way, I wasn't talking about those. Multiple things were written down. But they are a toxic way of playing which exist and the devs put them in there by design. My point still stands. Although we can make an argument about tunneling. If you can find the guy who is easy to down, even with DS it's a no brainer to get him out and reduce the gen workers by 1.
---
For the love of God please no
---
You truly have no understanding of the point I'm trying to make. You seem to be the troll here.
---
I know. Did you read, I said top 2 are op but the rest are trash for looping.
---
I’m not not a homophobe but yeah I kinda agree
---
It just means *some afflicted state, I just said* bleeding nose in keeping with the lore, but of course it can be revealed to the player in any way, it's not really important - think plagues sickness or Freddy's dream state.
---
You talking bout' the bloodhunt?
---
&gt; My point still stands.
---
Same as mine - if you have a choice and choose toxic way, that's not devs fault.
---
Ironically, Jane has quiet breathing compared to other female survivors, alongside Kate.
---
Yeah. I'm a new player. I'm either chewed out for my doing well OR because of how I managed to get some kills.
---
I understand not every player is like this, but I've had come across more unsportsmanlike players. 
---
This is a game. It's supposed to be fun.

Well since M&amp;A Is needed on on the best spirit build (prayer beads)  I thought I would make the best build for that
---
Basically the old effect of the Rules where survivors can't see Jigsaw boxes until after their traps become activated becomes the norm for Pig.
---
The guy who made that lawsuit is a human scum ... And greedy fuck if you ask me. Friday 13th was AMAZING horror game. Frankly i would say even better than DbD because of multiple objectives and killer feeling like a threat while being extremely fun to play.
---
Yes and that’s not anywhere close to toxicity kid.. that’s just someone trying to enjoy their game.. Why would you want someone to not enjoy playing the game they way they like (and the way the game was intended to be played might I add lmao) just so you don’t have to try at this game? That’s sounds toxic to me

What do you expect from 12yo kids?

where did it say, in their message, that it was a widespread issue?
---
Know when to slug as Huntress. I've won games as Huntress without must haves with her besides Whispers. I don't run Ruin on any builds as it's unreliable and running without it tests your skill and game sense.

My main build on Huntress is BBQ for bloodpoints, Whispers, Shadowborn, and Iron Maiden. It's not really her sttongest build but I don't like the default fov and I like the faster hatchets out of lockers. Whispers is really needed to not waste time and BBQ aura read is nice especially for testing cross map hatchets but I'd prefer Nurse's Calling or Deerstalker.
---
Lol if all else fails I just DC as killer before anyone can escape. I used the toxicity to destroy the toxicity.

---
thank you &lt;3
---
Haha I do this when I play killer. Especially if I know which one the survivor is in but there’s Multiple next to each other. I’ll just look at each one and slowly walk to the right one shaking my head. 
---
And then I usually get smacked in the face with Head On as karma for being spooky.
---
You are correct.
---
I found a good way to play DbD horror is without the UI. Can't tell who's hooked or injured, all you can see is skillchecks
---
That would be such a challenge.
---
They’re both tanks in their own rights and so similar. There’s almost no perks that could be given to him that fit that aren’t already in the game with Agitation and Brutal Strength with, guess who! Trapper. If you’ve ever played F13 they’re basically the same guy. There’s even a bear trap maining version of him and the movies are so much.
---
If Jason was ever to come to DBD I think he’d be a lot different than any of us expect because trapping is out of bounds, along with brute “strong guy” perks.
---
Just look at Hillbilly and Bubba. That mess seemed easier to work with than Jason could ever be.

---
I *replied* to your post, how could I not have read it?
---
As you've deleted it, it's difficult for me to quote your original text. You did not state that you had personally witnessed the event, only that it had happened in the game and that another player had messaged you about it. This is why I specifically mentioned *personally witnessing it*, so that there could be no doubt.
---
My quoted text is from the most recent "Game Rules" post on the official forums, [here](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system). Please note that it dates to 2018, whereas your quote looks very similar to information from 2017.
---
&gt; *All of the questions you asked me is not bannable*
---
I suggest you are wrong. Survivors and killer working together is bannable, and those examples are all situations where the players are "working with the opposite team to gain an advantage", one that they would not otherwise have enjoyed.
---
Still, why debate semantics when we could always just ask u/not_Queen_bhvr for the official stance? It could well be that they're *technically* against the game rules *as-written* but (with the possible exception of farming) are given a blind eye because they're not necessarily "malicious".
---
Breaking the law to make someone feel good is *still* breaking the law.

His comment has been removed as you are right he was being uncivil. But still you two try to settle things without name calling thank you
---
It says targeting specific players to ruin their gaming experience? That’s what was happening.
---
That's Tapp's
---
Not really sure why you think your 5 upvotes are some gods gift that you weren’t being an ass?
---
Did you forget Microsoft hate Sony?
---
This was literally made for DBD. But is DBD made for 13th? No. The way it handles the game, no. Not at all. They don't deserve Friday the 13th.
---
Detroit become human, i really recommend playing it :)
---
??
---
Removed for name shaming
---
I totaly agree with you man. 
---
Friday 13th is real horror game. And total winner over DbD in horror genre. I just hope Behaviour would make killers strong and intimidiating ... I dont feel any rush or fear when killer closes in, because it is just random dude in a costume ... Thats it basicaly ... Demogorgon is only Killer which funnily enough feels truly scary in this game. Each time he roars, you look around if he did not jumped to you.
---
The red vision and music should be removed to killers to be any kind of threat and make it more horror like. Just like with Friday 13th ... But then again a lot of survivor mains would not like that.
---
Also happy cake day.
---
Wish they could do stuff like this. But knowing them it would just break totems somehow. 🙄
---
Step 1: Play 1 game of pig because Amanda is bae
---
Step 2: Get bullied
---
Step 3: Play another game of pig because I love pig
---
Step 4: Survivors teabag and talk shit in the end game chat
---
Step 5: Play huntress with Iri head, belt and Mori
---
Step 6: Win game in 2 minutes with 5 gens up.
---
Step 7: laugh at their whining in the end game chat.
---
I did! I'm trying to avoid eve ru thing on it though. No spoilers
---
*table slamming intensifies*
---
You got salty that you got looped instead of leaving them to apply map pressure lmao, GG
---
I thought this was legit and then I realized it's the mkx background... good try, good sir. It looks very good
---
No, I'm saying that if I was I'd be downvoted, but go on I'm vaguely interested in you usurping what I said which was completely correct.
---
Yes please!!!!
---
Yes. That video is legendary. He is also from BHVR
---
No. On the switch it’s a basic perk available for all killers.
---
I mean Fortnite somehow made it work. I know it was a bitch and a half to get sony to join in but they managed to do it in the end. Although Fortnite is way more popular, so I can see your point.
---
Always when I pass throw their office, there is always the KFC bike...
---
I have, dude tried to bamboozle me and I thwacked him
---
Why don't u upgrade it?
---
Nope I was making out clearly that things like this are within patch notes and it is better if you check them first before asking reddit or anyone else.
---
And FYI, there's a separate category at the bottom of the patch notes that read "KNOWN ISSUES". Totally Missable.
---
Kapp.
---
I love how if you like anything that comes from Japan you're immediately a week and talked down by a stranger how you should go out and socialize/get a life/insert stereotype in a forum about games.
---
It's like going to a library and calling people nerds with no life because they are studying.. like.. okay..
---
I agree Idk what op is trying to say when a lot of people play for fun and not to win, the only time i tunnel or teabag is when they bm me first, so it is the players you can’t expect the game to make it impossible to down the same person twice or run good items otherwise every game will be boring
---
"Voice chat would have helped this game"
---
Yeah ok sure
---
Lol
---
Why tho? It doesn't change the repair speeds and Endgame Collapse speed, and those are the main factors that determine the maximum match speed. If you slug everybody in the first minutes of the game, it won't really prolong the match time either.
---
Redhead's Pinky Finger?
---
Wtf :0
---
Definitely. I should add this.
---
Yet it takes him literally a millisecond to get his shred up and ready to go, compared to any other ability a killer can use to destroy a pallet, it is incredibly broken (I won’t say OP, I think it isn’t a bad change, but broken for sure). Plus the roar barely takes any time, it is 100% faster than brutal strength. You know what it’s probably similar to spirit fury without enduring speed overall.
---
Thank you very much for the answer
---
I had this happen as well against a spirit, I was slugged and maybe five feet from the exit gate with no spirit to be found and ~10 seconds on the timer, I crawled more and boom dead
---
Imagine if they changed Spirit's visible animation to just a T-pose
---
 yo man i am on the look out for the skill check sound effect i have downloaded your file but i can find it anywhere could you help?

**Survivors keeps disconnecting**
---
9 out of 10 games i play as killer there is one or two survivors randomly disconnecting, one game even 3, all at the same time and i don't know how to stop it from happening, i already uninstalled and reinstalled the game 2 times and i don't know what to do, its really hard doing killer dailys and is actually ruining my experience with the game on pc, i have the game on ps4 and it doesn't happen there."

Yea Switch should be fine, like I said their specs shouldn't affect you. The only bad thing I can think of right away would probably be all the Switch killers with bad ping if they're traveling or something since the Switch is portable. But maybe that problem can be solved once they add dedicated servers. And I'm not saying to add cross play first, for sure get dedicated servers ready, then add cross play at later date.
---
I don't think so, mainly because there are other characters that they would rather add than ones from the same shows over and over again.
---
You can just slug them if they do so, or even hook them again if you'd like, somebody still will have to come for them so you would be able to keep your pressure while not being worried you would be called "trash tunneler" or some other shit
---
Default controls:
---
L to sprint, and complete skill checks.

R is to pickup items, and interact.

Good point.

The only issue I am encountering are the two people who questioned me when I gave him:

Hmmmmmm.

You seem like the type of person that takes all the credit for a group project despite doing absolutely  nothing, and you have the nerve to get upset when people ask you research and credit the original poster of this concept. You didn't do well in school, didn't you?
---
Youre bragging about shitting on grey ranks. While you're green. Okay buddy.
---
The game was so good and so promising. Thats so sad
---
$$$
---
All these situations are absolute tell tale signs of lag in DBD. Do you use an Ethernet cable?
---
Not a fan. What’s the killer supposed to do if, after a survivor gets unhooked, they run into the same person? Leave them alone because otherwise that’s tunneling? 
---
Also, what about the games where there are multiple players with the same skins? Not super common with skins, but it happens pretty often with the default clothes.
---
Don’t give me hope
---
You're great for having control over your emotions and not promoting this behavior in any way. I'll make sure to watch your stream once in a while. :)
---
Yea I agree. I only posted this because I’m still triggered about johnathan or hopper not getting added.:’(.   I still love playing Steve though!
---
So once you start the chainsaw you are sprinting for the rest of the match or what?
---
im actually yellow, idk why it said i was green
---
Wouldn't work.  Both killers and survivors have their idea of fair play.  Maybe survivors could vote for themselves, but even then I read stories here about people looping the killer while gens are being done and post game getting flamed for "not doing anything."
---
But I'd imagine what would really happen is survivors would say a killer is toxic for killer/perk/addon choice; while Killers would do the same for item/perk/teabagging.
---
We got Bill though! I guess more left 4 dead paragraphs never hurt.
---
If it glows, it goes.
---
Imagine being “distasted” and getting proximity camped and tunneled. Going back to first phase of entity book over and over and over and over again, people are going to troll you by knocking you and hooking you right back up and survivors are going to farm points off you by unhooking you so many times. In a perfect world maybe it would work, but so would the way dbd is right now would work in a perfect world.
---
Oh god no. Those events brought the worst out of people lmao

You almost got me, not even gonna lie. You almost got me.  I woulda been that stupid guy who woulda been like "OMG IT'S HAPPENING" but luckly i was not that person

You're just making excuses for why it's ok for people to be assholes, but if someone gets upset about that they're the problem.

How can you get so twisted up?

Steve was a nice addition, Nancy seems a little out of place though, she only really did anything important in the first season. It should have been either hopper or Jonathan instead of here.

I'd be down with it. Give console players an option to be queued with PC/KBM players. Give a bloodpoint boost of they are as well.

The lawsuit is.  Thing new with F13 can be done until the lawsuit is settled.
---
Nah, I have before but wasn't the biggest fan cause 1 I dont really have friends lol and 2 it just didn't have enough for me to do but the water was astounding and best water graphics I've ever seen
---
This please, BHVR
---
No shit, your point is....???
---
Many times with the Shape. For me the most satisfying Mori's usually are towards the end of the game. That one survivor who has run riot, on the home straight without being hooked. Then out of nowhere they have a knife in their gut.
---
You will play for fun whether the game was competitive or not. The question is why isn't the balance better for the people who care and become frustrated with its "toxic" mechanics.
---
Yeah that sounds dope or maybe being on the boat and it tilts from side to side or end to end forcing players to move with gravity
---
They removed them because it fucked with a bunch of textures on some maps and it was too much work to keep fixing them.
---
The Demo suffers a 2.25 second stun when breaking the pallet and it takes 1 second to charge up Of the Abyss (yes it takes a full second, anything before that will result in a normal lunge which does not break pallets) totalling 3.25 second if he is right infront of the pallet, thus any travel time is also added up onto that.
---
Breaking a pallet normally takes 2.6 seconds, you are literally factually wrong. It is not faster than a normal break and certainly not faster than brutal strength.
---
If you tunnel, you'll get fewer Malicious and Chaser points...
---
I’ve based my tier list on my own experience with the game and where I feel each killer lies. Killer strength goes from left to right, the strongest killer in the tier first and weakest last. As always with tier lists, certain positions are debatable and nobody will ever fully agree. I’ll explain why each killer is where they are. These positions are based on using these killers at red ranks with no more than green rarity add-ons and below. 
---
(SS, Killers who are so strong that their power ignores basic game mechanics) 
---
Nurse: There’s no disputing her position. She has her own category in SS. A killer who can ignore every survivors defences and additionally has strong traversal and chase potential. 
---
(S, Killers who are considered the strongest in the game and debatably fall in between balanced and overpowered)
---
Spirit: Falls just behind Nurse, mostly due to power cool down and the fact that she is restricted to the physical plain. She is one of the strongest mind game killers and trying to survive a top tier Spirit becomes a guessing game. 
---
Hillbilly: He has both very strong traversal and a built in insta down. He also has the ability to break pallets faster. While he can be limited by maps, he can still deal some serious damage and pressure. 
---
(A, Killers who are considered the most balanced amongst the killer roster. These killers have the potential to do well, even at red ranks) 
---
Demogorgon: The Demogorgon has a bit of everything, and it all comes together to apply pressure on survivors via teleportation and stealth, the ability to dash forward and close a chase faster than other standard killers, the ability to fake a shred, and cause the survivor to mess up and the ability to shred pallets faster and play around them more, making them less of a threat. All of this combined makes it a very solid killer that can be very strong in the right hands. (Based on playing it exclusively since release but position may change as more survivors get used to it) 
---
Hag: Her traps are incredibly strong, if not annoying. They give her mobility and hits in the chase. Placing them correctly in chase heavy areas will result in fast downs and due to the nature of her power, defending areas becomes child’s play. The only way to disarm traps is to flashlight them or manually disarm by running over them. She forces survivors to move around more carefully which can waste extra time. She is very strong in the right hands. 
---
Freddy: His ability to teleport straight to generators, mind game his teleports and use it to get ahead of a survivor in a chase and smack them is incredible and fun to use. It gives him mobility while also applying pressure and halting generator progress. Both dream snares and dream pallets are incredible for the chase and it is debatable which is better, but ultimately they can both be used smartly and result in hits other standard killers may not have gotten. 
---
Plague: An underrated killer. The common statement is “just don’t cleanse”, but a good plague player will know this and use it to her advantage. Perks like Enduring and Spirit Fury will help deal with those who are broken. Discordance will also help locate multiple injured survivors. Should they chose to cleanse, She will temporarily become a stronger Huntress, hence why I’ve positioned her higher and the fact that she is not as limited by the map and is also 115% ms. Survivors who stay injured cough violently, puke and leave a green trail. Several healing perks will be disabled and they can spread their sickness to others. 
---
Huntress: Her ability to throw several ranged projectiles from a long distance makes her a strong but balanced killer. Her limits are movement speed, map selection and her ammo count. This forces her to be smart with when she does and doesn’t use her hatchets. When used correctly she can down survivors very quickly, when not used correctly, she can waste both time and resources. Cross map hatchets may give her an edge over plague but these are usually rare.
---
Myers (excluding insta kill add-ons): A difficult one to place. His power has the potential to down all four survivors in one go, but this requires several factors to be in place. Stalking is inevitable but survivors can try to hinder your stalk as much as possible with line of sight blockers. He can save a stalk and activate it on someone’s back, preserving Tier 3 duration and cutting a chase short. His terror radius manipulation makes getting around the map a little easier  and his slightly faster vault speeds can give him an edge in a chase. 
---
(B, Killers who have potential to do well, but are hindered by aspects of their power that are either lacking, or easy to counter) 
---
Pig: Her ability to manually enter and exit stealth while lowering her profile makes her a very effective stealth killer. Her dash is great for closing gaps when sneaking up on survivors and can even be used in loops (although it is hard to make it work at times, hence the placement in the list). Her RBT’s are a time wasting tool, not a killing tool. Survivors who remove the trap on the first box have hardly suffered any time wasted, but two boxes and beyond is where traps get some form of use. On the occasion you may get a cocky survivor who thinks they have plenty of time to remove a trap who ends up getting killed by it, but this is fairly rare. She is a stealth killer with a time wasting tool. Traps don’t create enough pressure and her stealth isn’t perfect, but she is still good in the right hands. 
---
Ghost face: a difficult one to position because while his stealth is arguably the strongest in the game (full movement speed with no TR or red stain and the ability to attack out of stealth), it is very easy to counter by looking in his direction for a short time. His power also has a very long cool down, meaning he can’t manually decide when he is and isn’t stealthed as much as Pig can. His main advantage is the ability to stalk and insta down, but if you’re caught, you’re severely hindered and are limited to basic attacks and small mind games with crouching and using night shroud in the chase. 
---
Doctor: His ability to afflict survivors with a pool of debuffs or effects and locate them easily makes him great for an early start in initiating chases. He is able to stun survivors mid chase to prevent vaulting or pallet dropping but this requires very good timing and will not always be effective vs good survivors. Survivors will usually power through the madness effects apart from having to snap out of tier 3. He is limited later in the game when survivors will not reveal their location as much as they did prior and stunning survivors will not always work in certain loops or areas. 
---
Clown: The Clown has an amazing chase game with his gas bottles, but the main thing that pulls him back is map pressure/presence. Survivors know they are safe to do as they please when he is not nearby. He has nothing other than his chase game to keep him going and even then, survivors can still play around gas to an extent. If the player is not good enough with gas cloud positioning, they will suffer. 
---
Wraith: Despite the changes made to Wraith, he still suffers from having a very basic power. Once he successfully hits a survivor from stealth he is forced to either chase them down like a standard killer, or recloak and hope he can get the drop on them, which could waste more time than it could save. He suffers greatly from not having a secondary power or something that helps him further in the chase to close that gap. 
---
Legion: After the rework, Legion has become a standard killer who can track survivors easily and keep them injured, but has to down them as a basic killer since their power no longer downs. Deep wounds helps to slow the game down slightly but it also poses not threat. Deep Wounds are made out to be deadly if survivors don’t react fast enough, but with the changes made, survivors don’t have to react at all. The timer for Deep Wounds pauses when in the killers terror radius and the timer ticks down slowly regardless. An aspect of their old power has been rendered useless and only serves as a slight time waste. 
---
(C, Killers who suffer greatly at higher ranks and are in need of buffs/updates, but could still manage to grab a kill or two if played optimally) 
---
Leatherface: The main thing keeping Leatherface afloat is his ability to insta down with his chainsaw and also hit multiple survivors with it. Many use him for meme basement builds for this reason. He lacks in map pressure while the other chainsaw wielder is the complete opposite. He’s a very basic killer who can be looped easily and the only advantage he has being looped is his ability to break pallets a bit faster with his chainsaw. 
---
Trapper: A standard killer with a power that can be easily dismantled by survivors who keep a track of where he is and what he’s doing. When survivors do get trapped, there’s a chance you’re far away and they will get out on the first escape attempt. They could go as far as sabotaging your traps, rendering them useless (this shouldn’t be possible) or just continuously disarming them as you go around trying to place more. Other than his traps he is as basic as a killer can be. Loopable and hard counterable. He needs serious changes to make him as competitive as higher tier killers at high ranks.
---
The idea of my stream is to promote a happy and chill zone for people to avoid toxicity so it means a lot to hear you say you're interested in such a thing :D! Make sure to say a hello when you're watching and I'll say a hello back :&gt;
---
Is that really a thing or just another shirtless Myers reee?
---
Um, holy fuck.
---
Quite literally please.
---
Probably too, yeah. Also you can get more of those if you're chasing the "Desired" survivor, too.
---
This was fun for me at least. Both survivor&amp;killer. Animation, sounds. It was really cool
---
That's mostly because the stun he receives from doing so is 2.25 seconds long whilst the pallet breaking animation takes 2.6 seconds. However this does not factor in the time it takes to charge his power, which takes at least 1 second for shred to activate and a slight bit more to reach the max range of shred (if activated at the exact moment the lunge becomes shred, you go about half the max distance)
---
Yeah sounds awesome and then he yells gotcha bitch or here's polly lmao
---
I do NOT want to see what the Spirit looks like phasing towards me 😰 My boxers couldn't handle that image
---
This is adorable I'm saving this for my screensaver
---
Seems to be a bug where the timer and the actual time remaining do not align. Usually the bar does not move at the start spot you actually have the same amount of time to escape but it is harder to tell how much.
---
Yeah this one would be sick
---
What the cinnamon toast fuck
---
That is an admirable quality, but I do not agree with it, as some bullies must be shown how they treat others before they can begin to see the consequences of their actions.
---
Bamboozles not bad either
---
Microsoft are actually willing to crossplay. It’s usually Sony who are reluctant.
---
Unless you wish for me not to use it for free I'd understand
---
Really tho

can u send me a clean version of this template??

Freddy not G tier? Wow, this game is going places

Fucking love it, hope BH hooks you up with this idea
---
I dont suffer from frame rate drops either its cos I'm on xbox or I just keep the memory low
---
If only iyt got cleansed this fast in my survivor games
---
Even when I do that one of us has to restart our game because it doesn't work.
---
give me 10
---
No, fuck you, I want Chad.
---
Yeah I want her to.
---
I love how these comments have so many upvotes lol
---
I feel like I make this exact same comment on literally all of these "hitbox" posts and no one ever listens...
---
Seriously, getting hit like 1/2 of a foot past where you normally would at a window is pretty low latency.
---
First of all that's beautiful, and kind of makes me want "Before the Entity twisted them" skins for Killers, similar to the Wraith skin we just got. 
---
Also, to truly appreciate that picture let's have some [contrast.](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/deadbydaylight_gamepedia_en/4/4a/Plague_Concept_4.png?version=bae81326f89fbbacb03ac0cf8549cc25)
---
It's telling you the killer is gonna DC in your next game
---
“Why is my sensitivity shagged?” Best question ever.
---
bahahahaha yess
---
Oink!
---
Aww q.q of course you can use it ^^
---
I get their intention is to annoy you but tilting the other person is a legitimate way to gain an advantage in any game. On top of that it might hide other sound effects cause youre so focussed on the clicking. Just ignore it.
---
I'll buy it from you if you feel that way. It's looked decent enough for me after what I've watched.
---
I'm not good enough with nurse but there is a specific pig combo I will switch to if I need to blow off steam.
---
It’s called fashion sweetie
---
My childhood scares, hell yeah
---
To be fair, they only said "Don't play if you are going to dc" basically, which is true for anyone. Low rank or not, you don't get better by bailing out ASAP.
---
Kind of random, but I started watching this guy on twitch called Scorpionz. He is a pig main at red rank and has convinced me that Pig does not need a buff. He uses no add ons because he believes her add ons make her way OP. He also avoids running perks that he feels abuses a killers power. I.e., he said he wont run Make Your Choice (might have the name wrong, but if so its the one that exposes a person unhooking a survivor) on Demogorgon because he feels it's a really good killer design and the perk would ruin it.  Definitely worth a watch if you like Pig.
---
Pretty good job so far xD
---
When the power turns on.
---
Just being on the other side doesn’t automatically mean you’re safe, killers can hit survivors who are up against the window.
---
Thought this was real for a minute e
---
Why the downvote tho?
---
People create those models, if it doesn’t please you then you should consider making your own. Or buy them from the dev’s, they have a site that they use for it.
---
I started playing killer yesterday, are you enjoying playing her?
---
It’s true that you can but we’re only human and prone to emotion, hence the purpose of postgame shittalking you know?
---
This happened to me today too while i was dicking around in custom games, 10 seconds left and it went of early for some reason
---
Idk man, play, ghost bitch, pig, clown and wraith are all in really higher spots.
---
If theres anything otzdarva proves jts that trapper is way better than clown, wraith, bubba even ghost fuck and then like.
---
Just requires a skilled hand.
---
is someone crouching repeatedly in a game the same as being stabbed in real life? fuck no, one cause actual physical pain so kinda stupid comparison
---
what downvote? I didn't downvote you. I know someone downvoted my question for unknown reasons tho...
---
If I’m just going to slug/hook the survivor anyway, then how does it eliminate tunneling? With or without your idea, I’m going to down the survivor I find. If it happens to be the person I hooked, I’m still downing and hooking them. It doesn’t do squat about that. 
---
What it does is incentivize the killer to go after other survivors and that will show up mostly in a scenario where the killer has the option to go after one or the other - but even then, if it’s 50/50 I’m going to down the survivor who’ll go down in 1 hit instead of engaging in a chase with a fresh survivor and letting the other heal. If anything, this’ll incentivize me in proxy camping because now I really won’t want that survivor off the hook with a buff. 
---
So if it’s not going to eliminate tunneling, all it’s doing is buffing the survivor for...reasons. There are plenty of reasons a killer might be hitting the same survivor (they’re just bad), I don’t see a reason to buff them and the whole surviving group as a whole just because there are users that’ll actually hardcore tunnel.
---
Yeah the end game timer has been fucked this update. Just doesn't start but your time is still ticking
---
So the youtube videos featuring future cosmetics are made by hand and not extracted?
---
I don’t know man, weird people haha.
---
But seriously if it’s not on the steam workshop, there is a site where one of the dev’s posts the models. I think it costs money. Sorry, I don’t remember the name of the site
---
Do it. Embrace it.
---
Im about 99.9% sure that's to do with the remake, i dont know how to do spoilers or that so wont say anymore!!
---
I wish. I’m on Xbox anyways
---
 is thisbBloodwarden tier 4?
---
Is that Meg’s texture I see?
---
havent done cloth simulation yet :P ill do it for video..also  made sure to clip  her toe
---
I like pigs.
---
It would be interesting if there were exactly 8 pages on the map and the survivors had to think strategy and coordination to avoid wasting all the pages. Kind of like pallets.
---
Would be difficult to survive with grey rank survivors on your team tho.
---
people like you are the reason i want to kill myself every day.
---
Well that would be even worse cause the guy who did have the license was scammed and will probably not be giving it to anyone anytime soon because of it.
---
Indeed it is, my buddy likes to bm me with it before getting me off the hook or to mark my dead body for the rest of our friends to see 😭😂
---
why is this nsfw
---
I understand slugging is useful in general but to counter ds it's just a detrement you can bite the bullet and kill em in like 30 seconds if your good as apossed to waiting 1 minute on them or trying to ""'slug""" while you don't even know were any of them are and then someone just heals the downed teammate and now you got no more books and they got a bunch of gen progress. Also I don't fucking use enduring do I, what am I fucking Billy main, I don't even have enduring unlocked how am I supposed to know they fucking nerfed it. My assumption that alot of ds use object is based on how most people only use Laurie for object, so if you see a Laurie it's doubtless they are also using ds with object because you might as well: object plus ds is actually a good combo to run if you want to run the killer for as long as possible. It's he prime distraction build. So most Laurie's run both and half the ds users are e l i t e Laurie mains. But also just from personal experience alot of people use the two together just because most people running ds are running a distraction build of some sort to allow their team mates to do gens for as long as possible. Also iam not a shit killer because I don't run enduring so don't even try to say that in response. Also slug all the time when only 2-3 are left and I know were they are.
---
nvm found gmod models, can I use those?
---
I mean, even a bad killer can get one knockdown or two in a match, and they’ll likely camp afterward. Besides, this is more focused on toxic survivors bullying the new baby killers who just want to learn to play
---
My one argument on this is i think a normal spirit in great hands is harder to face than a normal  nurse in great hands..... Now nurse is easier to play for the masses but you give the right person spirit they can clean house.
---
IMO nurse really becomes an issue when you add Blinks, i think you take away alot of that utility (which the devs are supposed to be working on) she's not going the best killer in the game. And Spirit Will be , even without the anal beads, because you can do so much with her mind gaming
---
He is merely using his right as the creator of the thing to try and reclaim what he created.
---
The fact is, it's a messy thing and most other cases what happens is the person holding the IP just cuts a check to the person who created it to go away; which isn't what happened here, which is why it's in such a legal limbo.
---
the game is 18 plus fucking idiot
---
No, it's just you want the game to be something it's not and won't be. DbD devs don't want the game to be super-polished perfectly balanced e-sport title. If you want that type of experience, you need to look for another game, because DbD will always be disappointing for you.
---
do models for gmod work on sfm?
---
They are so cute.
---
I want these all year long
---
Can’t lie teabagging with ghost face is a lot of fun against cocky survivors.
---
SHIT, I THOUGHT IT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY MAKE MY COMMENT ALL CAPS. NOW I CAN RAGE ABOUT THAT TOO!
---
What
---
I'd also give your left nut for this!
---
Friday the 13th game was lame anyway so i think Dead by Daylight can take good care of that license anyway
---
This post deserves more love.
---
It's not Victor Miller's fault he got fucked out of his rightful proceeds.
---
$$$ to hopefully help optimise the game
---
Having followed it a bit, yeah he has every right. It's a law that says that after x amount of time, a creator can attempt to take back something they made, or at the very least be compensated for the 'value' of something that they may have sold not realizing how much it was actually worth.
---
Now, I personally dispute that Miller made 'Jason', as much of a character as Jason can be, because Jason wasn't the one in the first film..he was the mcguffin, the reason for the film's events taking place. The 'character' that we know as Jason wouldn't be really developed until the sequels.
---
Hag's higher.
---
I know. Its just annoying me that this happens with every other post. Lashed out a bit.
---
I've noticed this too.
---
otz is an amazing player but you also have to consider the average player also, I wish I had his level of intelligence when making plays.
---
10/10
---
That has been happening to my boyfriend for the last several patches. He fixed it by completely uninstalling and reinstalling the game. Never figured out what was causing it though. Hope this helps!
---
So when can we have friendly banter between competitors? What type of thing would be okay for people to convey that they think theyre better than you in DBD? I should be allowed to take the piss out of someone for missplaying, this is the equivalent of someone in league of legends spamming laugh, its actually crazy how childish and weak minded some people are, fuck my karma, if you cant handle someone teabagging you youre either bad or easily tilted its that simple
---
can't you see the link?
---
I do t think DBD is going under anytime soon
---
no its actually from makehuman.. since this one required having full body mesh with head i decided do make a seperate mesh and morph it on plagues basemesh to get the outlines.. i couldn add other survivors textures since it would create a visible line near neck and torso area where they meet since they will have idfferent colors.. none of the survivors have full body skin mesh whcih is exposed in this skin.. So the skin textures not from DBD .. but eyes and mouth are Nancy's i just recolored it to green
---
UwU r/dbdgonewild UwU
---
“Anal beads”.....
---
She is a very strong killer and had Nurse not existed, she would be up there and people would probably be calling for even more nerfs than they already are. In the right hands to me, a Spirit and a Nurse are very close, Hence why they are so close in tiers. The main factor that sets Nurse higher is her ability to completely ignore obstacles, Spirit has to walk around it.
---
I mean... That really isn’t doing much but playing more into their hand. That’s what they want.
---
O now I can
---
In steam right click DBD, go into properties, go into files and verify the files. It does not take too long and it usually happens if you have a slight disk error in your pc. Mine does a similar thing but its not a big issue. Just down loading things is a pain for most things lol.
---
Oh no no no no. That is terrifying 😭
---
Okay was think of a steve i risked my öife for because he was really nice
---
Proof of how shit BHVR are at playing/balancing their own game: They not only think the Nurse's mechanics are acceptable in a game that is built around chases, but they also think it's absolutely fine that she can increase her blinks with add-ons, to as many as 5.
---
It will be like how bubba is a shitty billy because we have spirit
---
I can dont if they can dont tbag at the exit gates and make me feel bad for not getting many because am bad
---
Why should you ever mock someone anyway? Its not gonna do any good and will only make your opponent feel bad especially if they had a bad game overall. Stop trying to defend trash talking lmao
---
Not cool.
---
tru
---
Except the only thing that is similar to the two is black hair and female. Their powers would be completely different.
---
mm he is another one with full face mesh intact i might be able to do it.. whose face texture should I borrow :P Quentin's ? heheehe
---
I never run into those kind of Megs lol. They're always "special".
---
No one denied that
---
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
---
Emotional pain can be worse than physical. Not saying getting stabbed is the same as getting mocked but it follows the same logic.
---
I said " I just saw a survivor sandbag another team mate at the exit gate". or something to that extent. So one can assume I was at the exit gate. Lol, that quote I posted is actually within the game itself when reading up on the rules and bannable offences. So no I don't believe it is outdated. 
---
Yes, I agree, killers and survivors working together is  wrong and bannable, however in my case it was not. They were clearly not communicating and working together the whole game, so the intent was not there. The only thing intentional was the sandbagging. Yes the killer downed him, then picked him up and hooked him. What else was he supposed to do in this case? How is the killer in the wrong too?
---
I don't see any semantics at all. Survivor A bodyblocked survivor B for teabagging, not allowing surbivor B to escape. I now know for certain this is against the rules. If somebody intentionally  blocked your exit while the killer was in a room with you and that killer downs you, are you disputing that is within the rules? It's very simple and clear. Admittedly, I do feel silly for asking if I've done the right thing by reporting the sandbagger now, just because someone teabagged. Ironically,your last quote applies to the sandbagger, he broke the law and let the killer have the teabagger to feel good.
---
Is that a game dev, community rep or something? I might just actually shoot them a message with regards to what is legal or not out of curiosity. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. I don't really care, but it'd be nice to have the rules be 100% clarified officially.
---
Affect, talking bout maturity and telling people to kill themselves. Very parallel points.  Didn’t affect anyone just showed pure immaturity from someone who is demanding respect
---
They need to add 1 or 2 Warhammer 40k skins.
---
I wanna throw up all over her for some reason🥴
---
I would say that this is a relatively good list! I have a few disagreements with it however. First of all (and before anyone says anything i am a pig, plague and wraith main who has made rank 1 but i like to float around 8-10) wraith does not deserve to be in b lol. He is imo the second worst in the game. He has a lot of fun builds and some of the best add ons in the game, but he suffers greatly from no map pressure and no chase game, but he can get the first hit extremely easily. I think he deserves C tier with Bubba. Secondly, i feel that the trapper placement is a bit off to be fair. Now don’t get me wrong, his ability is extremely bland and fairly easy to counter, however the amount of map pressure a trapper can have with essentially shutting down every common loop on one side if the map is ridiculous. He can usually get the survivors in 3 gen or 4 gen situations extremely easily and is all around fun to play. The final issue i have is clown should in my opinion be a bit lower, due to having no map pressure, most survivors knowing to drop pallets early, a only mediocre ability, but he has some very solid add ons and perks as well as pretty decent mind game potential. Everything else about the list i love and keep up the good work!!
---
Meg is an "Energetic Athlete, able to outrun most Killers" (https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Meg_Thomas), of course she's good at running
---
No problem man! Good luck!
---
People who use the term "crutch perks" seriously are scrub as *fuck*.
---
In my opinion doctor is at least A tier simply because of his anti stealth capabilities
---
I'm saying that's how it is NOW.
---
Not anymore. In the hotfix they put out yesterday they changed it so Demo can break them without add ons, while changing the add on that allowed him to originally
---
Went against a Freddy tonight that absolutely demolished us tonight. I had to just hit continue and turned off the game.
---
i mean... the descriptions hardly matter for characters, but i get what you're saying lol
---
It doesn’t eliminate me going after them and downing them. As I said, I’m going go hit the injured survivor instead of the healthy one, in the event I’m at a point where it’s 50/50. It’s not eliminating tunneling in that sense. And if I see an unhook, return, and the unhooked guy is the only one I find - welp, guess they just got a buff for no reason. 
---
If your counter is “just slug him then”, that’s A) still buffing him because now he bleeds out slower, can move, can be healed without losing a health state, and his aura is gone, and B) doesn’t do anything for the survivor who feels like he’s being tunneled. 
---
I’m incentivized not to let that guy off the hook because if I catch him and hook him again, then I got nowhere in the game. Anyone who is freshly unhooked might as well not even heal because they won’t lose a health state by getting hooked.
---
It’s just an unnecessary idea. It’s like if I said survivors should get a speed nerf if they’re involved in a chase for x number of minutes, because of all the meanie survivors who will loop bad killers for an entire game. Or instantly losing a health state for going from crouching to standing too many times in any given span. It’s fine as it is.
---
I don't wanna play this game anymore
---
Yeah I run spirit fury/enduring Nurse, what's up?
---
True. Killers still do it tho, that's my main concern.
---
Queue times are no different than PC for me, connection/latency is just fine
---
Omg so beautiful!!!
---
I play on mobile. No thanks.
---
I believe anti stealth is overrated when his actual chase capabilities are limited since his stun does not always work. Chases are where the game is decided and while finding people faster is great, it only aids in getting chases going.
---
You are absolutely spot on!
---
Freddy is better than Demogorgon imo. He can end chases faster and his snares are unavoidable unless you want to run away from the loop area which would cause you to get enter unsafe zones.
---
That would be cool! But the glitches would be unending.
---
when I told him he has to avoid mindlessly looping against the nurse he tried to flex on me by saying "i haven't looped a killer once in my 2000 hours" which is either a pathetic lie or just proves how bad he is at the game and his opinion is pretty much invalid
---
Good point
---
Keep that mindset and read another post about "bad manner players" or "baby dweets" and just ignore everything anyone suggests that will help evolve the game. The more people that don't care whether the product is polished or not, the less action towards removing the mechanics YOU hate.
---
I'm an asshole for playing Nurse. But the Devs should be cherished for creating such a fun experience... by keeping her the way she is for so long cuz I mean they only design 4fun and I guess maybe it flew over their head that it might not be balanced to skip the main mechanic of the game - chase.
---

I've only tried it handled (as if there's a situation I want to play it on a screen I'll just use my PC). I can honestly say frames and graphics are more than fine. Absolutely no complaints there. That said, I've heard from others the games performs well in handheld and poorly docked. 
---
On PC I ran 60 FPS on a 1440 monitor.
---
After thinking about it more, yeah I think you might be right. I might've lost track of one of the killer dailies I had between refresh. I've had survivor dailies turn to killer dailies.
---
i play him sometimes he's really fun :D
---
I want his power to relate to his dead mother speaking to him
---
Assuming it starts at 11:00 AM EST, which is in 1 hr 49mins from now
---
It's not some much F13 the game losing the licensing as everyone losing the licensing. I'm not totally up to date on the legal mumbo jumbo but some timer ran up in 2017 and no no more new Jason material can be produced. No movies, no camoes in games, no cosmetics in his own games. Nothing. Until the deal is settled there will be no Jason in anything anywhere.
---
ew
---
Bruh what
---
I mean...if you need a $5 loan, I gotchu bro.
---
&gt; The more people that don't care whether the product is polished or not, the less action towards removing the mechanics YOU hate.
---
I don't hate any mechanic in the game, though. Some of them are unfun (hint: most of them are "competitive" ones).
---
&gt; I'm an asshole for playing Nurse.
---
Just for a fact that you're playing Nurse? You're not. You can play her in a non-toxic way. Just as any other killer.
---
DS is on the shrine this week.
---
This isn’t a new argument, it’s a reiteration and reminder of a common, timeless one. People bm weaker killers while complaining about only facing strong killers, it’s very hypocritical of many survivors that literally showcase themselves why high-rank Killers only play strong ones like Nurse, Spirit and Hillbilly, because anything lower than them leaves you with no plausible chance of winning or having fun.
---
Yeah bad was for the meme
---
I have mixed feelings about playing R1 survivor. On one hand, the lack of variety is a **complete** bitch, but on the other, at least half my teammates aren't DC'ing all over the fuckin' place.
---
hi
---
I mean, he would probably be a bit similar to spirit as he does teleport. But who would the survivor be for the chapter though?
---
Idk it sorta looks like a rabbit with Down syndrome but it’s still cool! Good job
---
Thanks ! :)
---
Idk to me it feels those games are the most fun to me since the killer wants to max out his points he’s going to try to interact with everything
---
Not_Queen retweeted it ;)
---
Terminator was already unlikely, but with death garden here it’s near impossible. And I’m honestly fine with that, I would be ok with a solo survivor Sarah Connor but I just don’t think terminator would fit in well.
---
I'm pretty sure Slendy is even older than Marble Hornets.
---
But yeah, there have been representations of him actually moving.
---
thanks &lt;3
---
Honestly I kinda want an original killer and not another licensed one
---
or just cleanse 1 totem, work on 1 gen and repeat :)
---
You can still have fun even if you died ?
---
Maybe Slenderman? Pennywise for sure though.
---
The plague never looked so good before
---
If it’s the first gen, then it’s best to get close enough for them to be in your terror radius and go for a grab before they all know you’re playing Spirit, Monitor does nothing in that scenario. Her power is a free hit machine, the time you could potentially save by using Monitor isn’t worth it when you could use any generic Spirit build perk in its place because of how quickly you can end chases, even on indoor maps.
---
I would say in my personal opinion I prefer Freddy over billy. Freddy has so many tools at his disposal and fake pallets are great.
---
That legion's pallet break is 3 times faster
---
survivors using their only means of evading the killer? TOXIC!!!!
---
I dont watch a whole lot but from what I have seen the 3 you just listed are 3 of the best killers there are. Including Tru3. Idk or really care who is better at what.
---
My only point was idk why people hype up 9ne streamer like they're so much better than anyone else.
---
I enjoy otz the most becuase he us the most fun to watch imo. There's nothing more to it than that.
---
Pennywise shouldn’t be in dbd, change my mind.
---
Use noed its better than nothing. People get salty about it but personally I dont care that much as a mainly survivor player. Level up your other killers during the BP event and youll be good. Plus if you play them while doing so you may find other killers you enjoy.
---
Amazing work, keep it up
---
What are you playing on atm? My gf had the same issue and she was playing on a laptop. For some reason when I launched the game from her account on she was able to do both. Maybe try on a different pc? 
---
Hope this somewhat helps :D
---
When Vommy Mommy was just Mommy.
---
Are you saying someone teabagging you causes you emotional pain? if so you may need to speak to someone
---
Why not call him The Operator? His name from Marble Hornets
---
Oh got it, yeah December is the next one, then March 2020 and then November 2020
---
But then, you soon have a full team of No Mithers without the few benefits it would normally gives.
---
... Which is of course why you should just run No Mither from the start.
---
Viable only if you can waste time ... a.k.a looping around a hooked survivor or last man standing.
---
Better that than essentially a gatling gun huntress lol
---
I mean just by charging it he can force pallets earlier
---
Remind me bot was just in time! Thank you so much!
---
even if the killer is considered low tier, it is still very easy to see why something like that for Legion isn't base, they don't lose any momentum in a chase when vaulting+breaking a pallet, being able to base kit break it would be too good.
---
*all 3 other Survivors escape*
---
I see this as an absolute win !
---
Because idiots will buy it.
---
You don't know the half of it ;)
---
IF YOU BRING A KILLER TOWARDS THE GEN I'M DOING THEN DROP A PALLET TRAPPING ME ON THE SAME SIDE AS THE KILLER THEN YOURE A CUNT.
---
Aight, they gotta make this real in December. I dont even need a survivor I just need Crystal Lake and Jason
---
People that still doubt Nurse never experienced how strong Enduring, Spirit Fury, Bamboozle, Brutal Strength is on her yet.
---
I always imagined spirit Naruto runs when phasing
---
What does that even mean?
---
This and Pennywise would make me complete
---
Damn, you roasted the hell outa me lol
---
Considering I don't see Dead by Daylight stopping anytime soon, maybe when the lawsuit finishes up this will finally become a reality.
---
On the rare chance I play nurse I enjoy the challenge so yes. I do enjoy playing nurse
---
Id imagine watching the killer over your shoulder and some maneuvers would have higher potential on m&amp;k.
---
I got this with Quentin before. I tried it and I definitely ran the killer around for 2 seconds but it didn’t count. I ended up getting it but I think it was after like 2 minutes of being chased.
---
This is a good one
---
Damn girl, you puke with that mouth?
---
That’s kinda hot
---
I would love to bring my mediocre PC huntress v console players! A good PC nurse is in a whole different league. Console players would hate the game.
---
&gt; The greatest danger is that once a player discovers such an exploit, she will never be able to play the game again without using it
---
So you're telling me that there're no killer mains with 5000+ hours who doesn't play Nurse or Spirit running most OP builds and playing in a most effective way? And there are no survivor mains with same hours who doesn't play only as a 4-man "gen rush spec ops" swf?
---
&gt; especially in a competitive game
---
Maybe you need to look at the 3 years of changes in this game and think about is this game really competitive? And does it look like devs want it to be competitive?
---
Yucky
---
There is no amount of yes I can use to describe how much I love this.
---
Memeing dud.

Oh I get it now, the joke is that she would hide the whole game until the exits are open and just run for them. Thanks for the explanation.
---
I FUCKING HATE SURVIVORS JESUS FUCK
---
HVR as a company has 20 years of experience, but all they're doing is making shitty movie licensed games and every now and then they make their own shitty games a la WET or Naughty Bear. DbD's base idea was pretty interesting and they could've made a great game, but they never did anything with it and on top of that no one there knows how to code or optimize a game. Please, literally kill yourself if you think BHVR isn't one of the worst devs out there.
---
All are cool but Insanity needs to be every 30 seconds
---
If it's slower what's the use of breaking a pallet with the lunge?
---
You weren’t the only one 😌
---
Yeah pinhead is definitely more likely
---
I am a plague main now suddenly
---
I only play my Switch in handheld and it's made any of the optimisation issues a bit forgiving as opposed to playing docked. I guess the fact DbD runs at all on the Switch is nothing short of a miracle considering the years of optimisation issues it's had, lol.
---
Yet you're still here

"But sir, ancient Egypt was an unimaginably savage and cruel place. Horrible diseases, no medicine, no human rights, constant looming threat of war and destruction. What could possibly compel you to use this one-way time-travel machine to go there?"
---
I've been playing non stop for a week and haven't gotten cakes bexcuse
---
Thank you for the review, gamergod88.
---
Yes. I can be unhappy with the status of the game, but still love it.
---
It's not like I have a choice of any other asymmetrical horror game. This is it. I love this game. I want it to do better. 
---
Be better.  It's currently not doing that. For either side. Things only get worse as history repeats itself for both side's issues.
---
You can do that exact same thing with balanced landing though
---
The ultimate twist would be to finally do a Friday 13th chapter but make the killer be Momma Vorhees.
---
Yup! That'd make sense.
---
Except 8 addons isn't exactly enough.
---
Unless BHVR does their classic thing and make an "Iridescent Page" or something.
---
I remember when I first started playing, with time and some YouTube guides you'll get there I'm sure. We welcome all free weekend players
---
Im headed to work for 12 hours rn, this hits me hard. Every bloodpoint start day i have a stupid long shift or I'm away from home.
---
It's Predator/Yautja logic. Sure, you get only one kill, but you get the most prized one.
---
Or, not even. I remember once downing a Survivor at the opened Exit Gates after he ran me for 5 gens, but I found the chase so thrilling that I didn't even feel the need to claim my prize and just let them go.
---
Sometimes, it's not about killing everyone or making the most bloodpoints.
---
XD Thanks. Hopefully the others I make get better lol
---
smh artists not using their free time to earn (the exposed status effect for 45 seconds)
---
Devs thought Legion was a good idea to release in their first state and that a killer capable of putting you into a lose-lose-lose situation while standing next to you would be ok, AND at the same time still somehow made the killer rather underpowered at the same time.
---
Even though they swiftly changed him, they somehow released Ghostface on the PTB with virtually a power that was so easy to disable that it might as well have been non-existent. Current Ghostface is a decent killer now, but even then his reveal mechanic somehow feels unfair for both him and the survivor simultaneously.
---
at this point it is easy to believe any nonsensical thing the devs do for balance.
---
Kate is Nea done right ;)
---
And that's also OPs
---
Hahahaha I’m rank 5 but thanks for your concern
---
Say you're chasing someone and a pallet is dropped, you have shred charged up but the survivor is already behind a wall. Instead of having to walk to the pallet and break it you can release shred on it and break it that way, which in this case would save just a smidge of time in travel distance (shred moves at 480% iirc) and breaking as you already have it charged up.
---
Another use is when someone is looping you through a pallet that isn't dropped, if you charge up shred and release it with some decent timing, the survivor has one of two options. They either drop the pallet and have it instantly destroyed (they will also be stuck in an animation and shred can destroy a pallet before the kicking animation would normally be initializable) or they get hit through the pallet and stun you afterwards.
---
This last scenario can happen up to 11 meters away from the survivor (max shred distance) thus it allows Demo to be somewhat more aggresive, but only on certain loops and with decent timing

No you misunderstand, she *didn’t* make it
---
Job well done sir, have my upvote
---
She was perfectly in the light and the explosion. *Mwah* Magnifique
---
Good luck
---
The reason you shouldn't go for the save is because the killer is just going to tunnel him or rip you off of him and hook you
---
Too easy to see lol, devs are like “they keep asking for a bright blue and white uniform, fuck it”
---
No
---
He's hot, I *have* to kill him
---
I HAVE THE SAME ISSUES PLAYING WITH SUVS OR KILLERS, I HAVE TO WAIT 10 OR MORE MINUTES TO FIND A MATCH AND WHEN I FOUND I HAVE TO PLAY AGAINST RANK 1-2 (MY RANK IS 8).
---
Oh I see, thanks for detailed response
---
If the killer uses franklins demise they can pick up the ak and Mori survivors
---
I went through this at first but then I started playing survivor more. Its dependent on the perks and learning how mind-game &amp; loop. Then you can become a ballerina too!
---
We are like the Entity we pop up to extreme emotions... Your hype was delicious

Slenderman isn't in the game dude

The fucking "Huuungh" in the middle made me ugly laugh.

I love playing him and I normally hate playing as the killer

Have you heard the tale of how one of the flashlight nerfs happened? BHVR said flashlights were fine and killers should just play around them. McCote did an interview with some high level Asian players where he restated this and the players look around the room and had a quick laugh at his buffoonery.
---
They said, "Want to do a KYF?" McCote played Hag and got completely fucking destroyed, including with flashlights. A couple weeks later flash lights were nerfed.
---
A lot of people say this about a lot of games, "the devs don't understand their own game," but in DBD I think it's mostly true. It's an entirely different game when you're talking about high skilled SWF on comms, and I don't think they play that game a lot.
---
Especially when they put their metal hats on your head!
---
The games fun because it’s not balanced.
---
Yeah. It just seems to happen less often than with SB. Might just be personal experience but SB seems to almost always end right before adrenaline activates.

Awesome job so far mate! It looks like you’re gonna draw the “hello” shot from the trailer

Hey, windows can be useful! If you have to choose between a pallet or window, and aren't sure if the pallet has been used yet, it could mean the difference between and injure or a down. Also, not entirely sure, but I'm curious to see if you can detect fake pallets with doctor/freddy using WoO. WoO gang rise up!

Good tips man, if you had to pick the best perk build to run on legion for a try-hard win what would you pick?

I really want the devs to do this for the Halloween event, you should tweet them about it

First match of the day I run streamers as killer and I literally don't hook after I down an unlucky Survivor twice I let them heal in my face then after they wash my ruin they go to rush jeans and tea bag with instant and anti hemorrhage then go to the gate and tea bag. Got to love this community

Implying Prayer Beeds for Spirit isn't already broken OMGLOL!

I'm wondering if survivors timers got reverted back to displaying 3 minutes instead of 2, I've seen this a couple times now. But that does look like less than a third of the bar left so who knows
---
Anti-Aliasing got added, you have to go through the files to change them. BTW you can only do that on PC. There are tutorials on youtube and google if you want to see how.
---
Plz

Happend to me 3 hours ago (CEST 13). Can't find anybody.

It takes like 6-7 minutes to play a killer match.

I love this design! Very well done. Would be so awesome to see this ingame :D

Like freddy but worse

Next you’re gonna say the god combo of no mither and self care is impractical
---
This is awesome my friend!
---
Hex: Bitch you thought
---
im new to the game, i keep on seeing people say "noed" everywhere, what is that?
---
It would be, IF people didn't use those means to be the absolute worse. 
---
I mean I personally don't find it fun to curbstomp with ease on killer or survivor because I ran the best of the best stuff. There's no challenge in that.
---
Running 1 or 2 strong things? Fine, but when just for example:
---
You're Freddy and you run Pop Goes the Weasel, let's say Discordance, BBQ, and I don't know a really strong perk that's good for him, let's say Ruin, plus his chains/ropes add on?  And you do this mostly every game? 
---
I fail to see the fun for either side. You've not given yourself a challenge because you're basically a brain dead killer at that point who doesn't have to work anymore because your perks and add ons are doing it all for you.
---
And the survivors on the other side definitely aren't having fun against that. 
---
It's the same as loading in as Freddy and your RUIN getting totally shat on right off the bat. The survivors pump out all those generators and they're done. 
---
How is that fun for either side? The Freddy now didn't get to do anything because the team he was against? Didn't give him a chance. 
---
And the survivors just sat and held their M1/console trigger button and played generator simulator instead of the horror chase game it was meant to be. 
---
So I'll agree to disagree.  This game could be a fun party game if the people who were playing it weren't using the means BHVR had given them to always be at their most overpowered or powerful at all times.
---
It's the greatest gift
---
I don’t get why they don’t activate rancor if hatch is closed but noed gets active. seems dumb imo,
---
i dont think this perk is worth using unless you are playing huntress
---
Thanks, i was also wondering what happened to my graphics
---
Uh
---
If you're on PC and not afraid of editing files, you can put this:
---
&gt; [/script/engine.rendereroverridesettings]
---
&gt; r.DefaultFeature.AntiAliasing=0

at the end of engine.ini (you can find it at %LocalAppData%/DeadByDaylight/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor)

I’m keeping my eye on the lawsuit. As soon as it’s resolved I expect t this to happen The F13 game hemorrhaged its player base and the Devs long ago said they wouldn’t make new content even if the lawsuit was handled. They moved on. The franchise owners will want more money. 
---
I really want this too. So many horror icons in DND but no Jason. And I want to see what BHVR would do with Jason’s kit. Not to mention so many cosmetics, one for each movie.
---
Add Inner Strength 💪.
---
Just say "deviousness points" also you mixed up nurse and wraith in the description of the blindfold. Otherwise some really cool ideas here. I really like the expired bleach and cursed seal. Also the broken prayer beads would make for some funny and light-hearted gameplay, good work!
---
I wish he actually would snitch blendette out👀

I’d expect that those would be cosmetics. I would buy Jason 7 in a heartbeat.

Don't counter toxicity with toxicity, friend.

Wah

Bubba is the worst, Nurse is S
---
Yes please!
---
Thank you. I did miss the patch notes and wasn’t aware.
---
**sigh**
---
***Unzips pants***
---
My dude, 3 gens is about 80-120 seconds in ideal survivor conditions.
---
If you subtract the time to find the first guy you chase, the first chase doesn't need to last that long.
---
I’m colorblind I only really use it so I can actually see the gens that matter in a better color and the yellow when they work on it is just a bonus.
---
ONG YOU KILLER MAINS
---
This has been in the game for all of the 2 years I’ve played.
---
Megs are 9/10 potatoes.
---
While huntress lullaby rarely gets it's full use, it would be way to strong as a non hex perk.  At 5 stacks it can work as a good alternative to ruin for the mid game, if you don't lose the totem before you get there
---
Even entity was displeased.
---
Why would you want to struggle if you're last survivor?
---
Omfg she’s gorgeous
---
Points bruh. A full struggle is like 500 points. Lol.
---
When you’re the last survivor it just kills you so you can’t waste the killer’s time. 
---
I do wish they’d change it to let you go through phase 1 if you haven’t been hooked though, so you can attempt to struggle off or use deliverance
---
Console players would get demolished by mouse-keyboard players and I am no expert, but wouldn't it be bad if a killer with uncapped fps chases a console player with capped/bad fps?
---
I try not to but they do it anyway sometimes, though an exception I make is scoops Steve
---
Ya know maybe killer wouldn't be such a struggle against optimal teams if gens took longer...
---
Maybe survivors could actually get bloodpoints if they got more BP for doing the obj and even more for going out of their way for altruism.
---
OMG YOU SURVIVOR MAINS CANT EVEN NOTICE SOMEONE WHO PLAYS BOTH SMH MY HEAD. Go back to your try-dead-hard red ranks and teabag. (/s)
---
This is very true for red ranks, basically godtier survs smurfing on meg.
---
Unfortunately because she's a free character ppl above red ranks use her casually and give her a bad rep
---
personally i dont really care too much for jason being in the game the only horror icon i really want in the game is pennywise and then my whole dbd career is fulfilled
---
She is about to trip oh shit oh fuck
---
I didnt think id needed to add a disclaimer, but I agree that the better control of m&amp;k is exaggerated and you can do well with whatever controller you practice with.
---
Is this EDP445 lmao
---
I don't like the idea of an iridescent add-on having a huge downside that defeats the purpose of the add on. Besides iri head obviously.

There is no dc ban tho wym. I agree with everything else tho
---
Oh then thats why they should mention that
---
She could push me out of a chair and sit on me and I’d say thank you.

Definitely, it falls under what the player is good with.

Mate you ever played nurse on console?
---
I
---
Look bro, he looks tasty, hard to resist
---
Yes I have.
---
Woah woah woah. Gibby first, then Slendyboi.

Its ok if you dont care. The reason why people hype up one streamer like they're so much better than anyone is because they FEEL that said streamer is indeed better. It doesnt matter really, just banter on reddit

AHHHHHHHHHHHHH

I don’t know why this made me laugh so much

I DID A GAME WHERE (NO EXAGGERATION) I GOT PAIRED WITH A RANK 2, RANK 5, AND RANK 1 (I'M RANK 11). I FIGURED I WAS FINALLY GOING TO HAVE GOOD TEAMMATES. CUE ME, FROM START TO FINISH, COMPLETING 3 AND A HALF GENS WITH 0 HELP (LITERALLY NONE, NO COOP AT ALL), 2 SAVES AND FULL HEALS, 4 TRAP DISARMS, AND TOP IT ALL OFF WITH ME RUNNING TO THE EXIT GATES, TRYING TO LOSE THE TRAPPER AT A LOOP SEMI CLOSE TO IT, ONLY TO GO DOWN TO NOED. I GET HOOKED, AND NEA GOES DOWNINSTEAD OF LEAVING. I USUALLY DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT ANY PERK, BUT THAT ONE IS INFURIATING AND GIVES UNDESERVED KILLS.

This generation. Last generation it was the other way around, when 360 was the top of the heap in the "console wars". People keep forgetting that.

You have gained my respect

I've done it once on playstation and made a new friend from it, I dont recommend doing it every game although.
---
thank you ! :)
---
Hello people, this is my first time uploading a tier list, with roughly 1.5k hours in the game. Here are my reasonings:
---
N/A: Nurse - Nurse is barely functional on console, due to the low sensitivity. This means you almost *never* go up against her, and whenever you do, how she performs is entirely dependent on the player's skill. She could destroy you in less than 5 minutes, or walk away with but a single hook. Thus, I consider her impossible to accurately place.
---
S: Hillbilly, then Spirit - Both of these Killers are ridiculously strong and quite easy to use, making them the most frequently encountered at red ranks. Both have tremendous map pressure and can get easy hits. Hillbilly just pips Spirit due to being easier, having no cooldown and having an insta-down.
---
A: Freddy, Pig, Demogorgon, Hag - Apart from Pig, all of these Killers are quite similar. All have powers which grant them great map pressure and soft-counter loops. Freddy is strongest due to his ability to take away all confidence and co-ordination from the Survivors. Demogorgon is above Hag due to the higher movement speed, in-built micro-stealth and the equivalent of Hag's Mint Rag at base.
---
Pig is in here due to her ability to shut down many loops, at-will stealth and game-slowing traps. She's better than Demo and Hag because the latter two can often get gen-rushed, but Pig rarely does.
---
None are S Tier because they all have somewhat reliable counters, or have limited use of their powers.
---
B: Plague, Myers, Ghostface - Again, all these Killers are quite similar. All have a focus on 1-shotting. Plague is best here because of her free tracking with Vile Purge, and long-range damage with Corrupt Purge. Myers can get stuck in EW1 for a bit and has limited use of EW3. Ghostface is just an easier-to-counter, but stealthier, Myers. None are A tier due to being easily looped.
---
C: Leatherface, Doctor, Clown, Trapper - The "not good, but not awful" tier. LF has great defence of hooked Survivors, meaning basement hooks are sometimes free kills, but struggles to land his power at times. Doctor is good at throwing Survivors out of their comfort zones, but doesn't really excel at anything. Clown is excellent in chases, but that's it. 
---
Trapper is really inconsistent. Often he gets destroyed due to have to spend an age setting up a stupidly easy-to-counter power, but occasionally he can build momentum really quickly and shut down matches in moments. Tends towards the former.
---
D: Legion and Wraith - Killers whose powers hinder more than help, most of the time. Legion gets good first hits and tracking, but the stun and low Frenzy speed kill his follow-ups and mobility. Wraith, without his absolute best add-ons, has a power that does nothing of value.
---
F: Huntress - On PC, her power is so strong that she needs significant weaknesses to not be OP. So she's slow, easily looped, has no map pressure, loses time reloading her hatchets and has the biggest base terror radius. This brings her down from a 9/10 to a 6/10.
---
On console, you have to aim with an analogue stick, making her hatchets *much* weaker, yet she has the same drawbacks as on PC. As such, she ends up as a 3/10 Killer. Not devoid of potential, but honestly not worth the hassle.
---
Thank you for taking the time to read this :) What are your thoughts?
---
Same thing happened with my Trapper. XD

---
OH NO SHE'S HOT
---
I hate that sm, I don’t even like playing the killers I get them on and I’m deffo gonna get bullied lol
---
I think if they get dedicated servers right, and game states are centralised, that'll be the only buff survivors ever need.
---
I for one would recommend you to play all of them. Also, balance it by playing survivor every now and then. For one, you get a better understanding of the game since you know what both sides have to offer but also it's good to just relax. Survivor is generally more relaxing than killer because you have less on your mind
---
When the new players start going against this don't blame them for uninstalling. 
---
Shit is wack.
---
No One Escape Death. It's a killer perk that only activate when all the gens are done. If there is a normal totem on the map it will become an Hex totem. This perk allow the killer to down the survivors in one hit. But the counter is to basically get rid of all the totems before it happens :)
---
Some will farm while some will play normally. You can’t please both sides so just do whatever you feel is best. I personally play normally as killer unless I see that survivors want to farm.
---
The bottom part is skins that could be included in the DLC  like the Left Behind one. I also realized that Level Headed is a really bad idea, and I already know what I would change about it, but I didn’t feel like remaking this.
---
Ooh, that's a good one. Will try out, thanks.
---
It’s rly strange, when I get face camped it’s usually by a doctor or a ghostface, and I’m unsure why...
---
I 200% agree with Dwight’s doppelgänger
---
Yep cause leatherface isn’t on switch. Neither is Freddy or Quentin
---

There’s also a bug for literally cleansing totems. I’ve disconnected at least 6 times for cleansing a Hex. And twice for cleansing dulls.
---
Probably the same 1 dude who comments literally everywhere wondering why no one replies or even upvote/downvotes it
---
Even then it doesn't look like they are doing bug fixes anymore, i mean the offline bots are litterally broken, they just stand around doing nothing, really sad
---
Play fast and hard as a survivor.  Get in chases, go for saves, do totems.  Sitting on gens/rushing gens is an ineffective way to earn xp.
---
As I said, using Ruin is at the mercy of RNG, as any Hex perk is.
---
The fact is, Hexes are used for potentially game ending perks, or at least ones that are going to extend the game. You shouldn’t be relying on Ruin to last through a match fully anyway, and the spawn points are far more fair now than they used to be.
---
Yes, sometimes you get a bad spawn spot, and sometimes you get it somewhere nobody can find it
---
Yeah i like it aswell
---
I just put up my christmas tree 😊

---
It’s a known issue.
---
The thing is, killer doesn't have to follow the same survivor that is god at looping. Actually, it's better to break a few pallets and get back to patrolling that chasing the same survivor for too long (but killers actually still get a speed buff if they choose to follow the same survivor for too long anyway). As survivor you don't have a choice on the opposite, you can't really just stop the chase and start doing something else, and that's the problem I see. If killer absolutely wants to kill you, they will do it - unless there is a huge skillgap. As a survivor you are punished for killer's decision to tunnel you.
---
I'm not saying my concept was perfect of course. But I still think game design wise there could be done something that prevents you from being killed in the first minutes of the game without real possibility of counterplay.
---
Wow really? Who could have ever known that
---
Woah there bubba
---
*sigh*
---
Here we go again...
---
I can't stand fungoose. He has a really obnoxious "sports caster" style and acts like he's good when he really isn't. He only wins because he's either abusing the strongest options a Killer has or is playing against potatoes, and then he acts like he used some unique high-end tactic when you're just using OP purple addons against Rank 15s.
---
Probably doesn't help that my first exposure to fungoose was someone on Reddit shaming me for not being at Red ranks, who wrote (and I quote because me and my friends have made this a copypasta and we have the comment on demand to copy-paste at will):
---
&gt;Keep being shit and being hardstuck purple. I'd say I'll see you in game but you're far too low ranked to ever be matched against me on either side lmfao. Like I said, go watch a fungoose stream and you'll quickly (or maybe not, seems you have double digit forest gump IQ) understand how terrible you are.
---
That could be the case. Idk. I have watched all the big DBD streamers and they all make mistakes here and there. I just go off who is more fun to watch
---
Happened to me too yesterday I had maybe 30 seconds of it to go.
---
I would start ripping that portal a new one right after so he never comes back
---
MOMMY
---
fungoose almost always gets a 4k.  The difference is that he drops his rank on purpose, because apparently, killer queues around rank 1 are so long that it hurts his stream.
---
Killer gets lonely. I don't mind letting the last leave most of the time if I feel like i've made my point and there's nothing else to prove. I could kill them, but I rather use the moment to give them a pleasant experience. You might just even make a new Steam friend.
---
I mean, yeah, but take Nurse for example. She can just eat your DS and slap you afterwards.
---
I wanted to make a perk that made escaping the basement a lot safer. For example, if a killer activated BBQ while you’re leaving the basement and he only sees one survivor leave, he may think you’re in a locker and will waste time by searching. Also, you could be healing nearby after leaving the basement and you won’t be seen by Nurses Calling. I feel this perk would be a better idea if the seconds lasted longer
---
Otz almost always gets a 4k my man
---
Edit: my point is they are both good. we should not have to bash one to praise the other.
---
I think the problem is specifically survivors doing asshat things **whilst being perfectly safe from any retribution by the killer**.
---
If you decide to slam all pallets on me with four people circling me, instead of doing gens, I'm entirely fine with that, because that's a fair number of pallets less that will bite you in the ass later on.
---
If you do the same thing in front of an open exit gate, with all four survivors up and several insta-heals available, that's toxic.
---
Really, the only real way to be toxic in this game (as a Survivor, towards the killer, because let's not start talking about Traitorvivors), is after the match is already decided, ergo when the gates are open. Before that, anything the survivor does can still be in pursuit of their agenda to win. Teabagging to draw the killers attention? There's a literal taunt gesture in the game, so that's definitely fine. Flashlight clicking? Sure, it's annoying, but if the survivors insist on trying to draw the Killer's attention whilst wasting small bits of their item, power to them.
---
But doing it at a point where it serves zero purpose past pissing off the killer, is toxic.
---
ToXiC lOoPs On ThIs KiLlEr, LOL MiNd FuCkeD
---
Lol. I had a game last night as killer where I slugged the last two survivors (Dwight and Scoops Ahoy Steve.) Felt bad for scoops ahoy so I dropped him on hatch and hooked the Dwight. I got a "two scoops for the killer" from Steve and "I fucking hate you" from the Dwight
---
in my experience, if you use it correctly you can zone the survivors pretty well, and it's been very helpful.
---
Game automatically kills you when you are last survivor because no one can save you anyways.
---
It kind of does, the healing/toolbox system works on what they call "charges."
---
You haven’t ever faved off against an amazing huntress. She’s better than Billy and easily takes 3rd place.
---
Then why does she have the lowest pick AND Kill-rates on both PS4 and Xbox?
---
She's too inconsistent, and suffers from low sensitivity.
---
are the buttholes not visible until he ports to them?  could he place a portal at both exit gates and the survivors not be able to remove them until he ports to them at the end of the game?
---
I always hate this sort of retaliation because often the people who criticize the game are the ones who care for it the most.
---
It’s actually around 890-891
---
His perks are still good and honestly he's not terrible. He just has a lot of bugs and design oversights that make him far weaker than he really should be. I think he's a good Killer to learn the game with, and unlike Leatherface it's actually possible to win high rank games with Clown as opposed to Leatherface who has little redeeming quality at high ranks.
---
Your comment is so ironic.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d9kr9b/unable_to_play_killer_due_to_survivors/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Maybe you have to already own them since they're basically a discontinued item now
---
I usually look for the hatch before they find it. I never let them out of it. I only let survivors escape without a fight is when I get my ass kicked.
---
mods of subreddits don't have the ability to shadowban users though.  It's done by actual reddit mods.  And is almost only done to advertising bots.
---
That used to happen to me all the time. The game was barely playable for me even after verifying files. As said above, it could be a disk issue. It was time for me to get a completely new pc anyways and I haven’t had that problem since.
---
&gt; As in, all decisive strike, body blocking, insta-healing syringe (etc, etc), constantly mocking the killer Survivors who try to make it solely unfun to play against. Which is only made worse as there is only one person they can even focus on doing this to and four of them.
---
Just to take a stand here, those are all fair game mechanics and there is no toxicity in employing all means you have to win the game. (There is the issue that certain 4stacks of items are kinda balance breaking, but so is Ivory Mori. It's still within the intent of the game though, because it means that matches CAN be strongly biased towards a side, same as how some killers are better on some maps.)
---
Nothing of that is toxic and people should stop, even jokingly, referring to it like that, because the only outcome are people like the one you responded to, who take that shit serious and get all antagonistic about 'protecting survivors from unjust killer main redditors'.

---
Surviving as a solo Q is team dependent, so I'll agree that's tough. It's not only in your control. However, pipping IS in your control, so if it isn't easy, I'd say you're around your proper rank.

Level headed would be busted strong if people just broke the totems to prevent NOED every game.
---
I've played Clown at pretty much all ranks but I haven't been able to play Killer much as of late due to crappy dorm WiFi.
---
All I can say about Clown is that I also play a lot of Legion (a Killer that most people consider to be worse than Clown.) I can consistently get 4ks as Legion with brown addons. Meanwhile as Clown I've had plenty of games where I got genrushed to hell and didn't get any kills even though I was using his best addons (Flask of Bleach + Probably Ether 15%)
---
That might be more of a testament to my skill with Legion as opposed to Clown's strength, but I've played Clown far more than Legion (due to the fact that Clown is older than Legion) and I think it says a lot that I do better with "the worst Killer in the game" than I do with Clown.
---
I'd put freddy in A tier personally other than that this is pretty average list
---
So why doesn't Overwatch or Rainbow Six Siege make it so the highest rank can queue with the lowest rank?
---
Well actually, they have, sort of, in the past the restrictions in Overwatch were more loose, but then they got tighter because it is better for the health of the game.

Up until the latest or the previous season of Rainbow Six Siege, there were 0 rank restrictions. So a Diamond could play with a copper and you'd play against the average, but they changed that for obvious reasons; the diamond stomped on the High Silvers/Low Golds. So it changed it for the betterment of the health of the game.
---
So are you saying these two MASSIVE developers are wrong? Are they in the wrong? It seems your logic is flawed, just like the amount of "..." you put in your paragraphs.
---
If you don't care about rank then that is completely fine, but you will be punished for playing with a low rank because why should you and your low rank friends be gifted free wins (And ranking) while the killer is given free losses? Yeah that sounds totally fair and definitely not imbalanced!
---
Oh just as a side note, deranking is against ToS and is 100% reportable and bannable! So go on, I support you to derank so we can have your inconsiderate ass banned. Thank you very much!
---
Health of the game &gt; Anything else.
---
pretty much ruin bbq, and 2 other perks you feel comfortable with preferably game slow down perks or info perks then use add ons with those perks and make a strat like maybe paint brush and swing chains or use black box in there or use pallets with pallet town map offering. Freddy is a nasty killer and not to be fucked with people are just now realising how powerful he is with all of the things he can do, naturally slow the game down, put a cross the map pressure and a power that can actually help in a chase.
---
Time to finish up getting Steve to P3!
---
I hope so. That feng skin is so dope.
---
No. I'm sorry some people are bloodthirsty illiterates, but I wouldn't for a second take a comment like that as being sincere, and I'm not about to put in overtime to make sure my comments are idiot-proof.
---
Dbd is one of the games that people for some reason refuse to believe skill is a factor.  I love to compare dbd to fighting games.  Its all about predictions, reactions, mind gaming.  And not to mention like you said the more mindless m1 killers are easy to deal with and someone like nurse who gets severely punished for doing poorly but rewards for doing well
---
Unless it's like one token it's busted.  Can you imagine combing that with Prove thyself?  
---
Prove thyself is a 10% bonus, now imagine if both survivors had an additional 20-30% extra?  
---
 [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Resilience](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Resilience)  resilience only provides a 3/6/9% bonus for remaining injured.  Compare that to your idea with breaking totems, which is something every survivor should be doing anyway.
---
This is the Scooby Doo version of hooking through the belt loop.  It's not a bug; it's a feature confirming Fred and Old Man Whithers as the next chapter.
---
I wasn't actually trying to 4 man them, I just wanted to hit them 4 times while they were uh intoxicated? Never played Clown before so I have no idea what the debuff is called
---
Couldn’t agree more.
---
Now if you'll excuse me i have a turkey to jerk
---
Worked, it's active now.
---
Look up some beginner guides for killer on youtube. Trial and error only goes so far in this game
---
I can't fuckin' see that man.
---
Bloodhunt started
---
I wanna know the full story about ace.
---
Alien Queen (or just a regular alien if sizing is an issue) and Ripley, by far. Throw in a derelict spaceship map and it's golden.
---
A+ Meme
---
Usually every match unless they flashlight click and teabag at pallets, or if I had a really bad game where all 4 escape, my reasoning is if they don't let me have a kill I really shouldn't let them live next game. Then my mentality resets or I take a break and come back to it a less murderous killer.
---
If I was going to play Jason I would play the Friday the 13th game
---
He seemingly teleports in the movies, although we have a few teleporters already.
---
He could have innate enduring and brutal strength?
---
I was streaming it but didn't have twitch set up to save the video. Furious I didn't. Two survivors hid for 35 minutes to get me to disconnect because one of their dumbass survivors dced immediately and another sucked so bad he claimed I was tunneling him. 
---
Still waiting for Bhvr to get back to me on that. Doubt they will. Playing killer has driven me fucking insane. I have removed people from my friends list who do this shit and launch into it. I play survivor way more than killer, but the level of toxicity that survivors show is fucking insane. Killers have to ha e a specific loadout to be toxic. These assholes get away with fucking everything. 
---
No more playin with people who say gg ez, teabag, emote spam, last second switches or toxic builds. I can't in good conscience play with people who make this game suck so badly for killers. 
---
I have ptsd and was having a really bad week and those two survivors who held the game hostage? Sent me into a panic attack/mental break where I just completely broke down that night. People don't fucking get that other people have lives and while you should seperate games and stuff, it doesn't work that way all the time and sometimes shitty stuff happens. I just don't get how people can think repeatedly doing shitty stuff in a game is fine.
---
That would be neat. I like the organized set of PIII LVL 50 cards, though...
---
never, unless I feel really bad for them
---
Lets make it happen BHVR, take this man's left nut.
---
Pennywise sewer?
---
I'm personally waiting for the Huntress. I want to know how she grew up without a mother. Did she struggle? We're the skills taught to her enough? Did she mature? Or did her loss traumatize her into the mindset of a child for life?
---
Time to farm everyone's pants off.
---
Gens that take less than 30 seconds to pop? In *my* Dead by Daylight game? *It's more likely than you think!*
---
They need to start hiding the totems better not making them more obvious than they already are lol
---
Spirit is great for higher ranks because of her mind game ability, and Nurse is by far the best killer for almost all ranks, but has a high skill cap.
---
I’d recommend leveling both and getting nurses teachable “stridor” on spirit.
---
I disagree it’s hot
---
Could be tough for killers though, they look pretty easy to spot
---
The difference is that Overwatch has a ranked and unranked play option... If you CHOOSE to play ranked then you are trying to rank up and of course should be held to a ranked standard... DBD does not have this and therefor is ridiculous to hold casual players to a hardcore rank up mentality. Especially when the majority of players are not in it for ranking up...
---
And if you think something being reportable and bannable will prevent people from doing it you are naive...
---
Either create and Ranked play and a Casual play or these changes should be reverted and will hurt the health of the game in the end
---
Now I am sad.
---
Doctors want you to hate them.
---
Try renewing licenses
---
P e r s o n a l l y, I think that Lee would be a better fit. The entity captured Lee &gt;!right before he turned!&lt; . That way it doesn’t mess up the timeline with currently alive characters being abducted.
---
Where is she from
---
is that Monto?
---
Anything that's not Spirit/Nurse will lose against a good coordinated team of survivors so it's really difficult to make a discussion or even a tier list..
---
That said, solo queue is something else and i think stealthy killers are definitely above the other M1 killers(Nurse/Spirit/ Billy excluded): Wraith, Ghostface, Pig, Myers.
---
I agree with Clown and Leatherface being the worst killers, i would also add Doctor
---
Killer tier lists are pretty over saturated at this point. Like who are you? Why should I care about your opinion? This has been done to death by people that are actually relevant, not every player of dead by daylight needs to have a fucking tier list lol.
---
Same. Always same.
---
FUCKING DEAD HARD DOESN'T WORK 70% OF THE TIME AND WHEN IT DOES THE KILLER LAGS AND HITS ME ACROSS THE WHOLE FUCKING MAP. WINDOWING A KILLER IS POINTLESS SINCE THE HITBOX INCREASES THE ASSES OF SURVIVORS TO BE THICC AS AHOY STEVES EGO WHILE VAULTING.
---
To quote Johnny Bravo: "Whoa mama"
---
Then it's useless!
---
Love it! Heck if I had a yard I'd put this out front in the 31st!
---
But it's still significant gameplay-wise. You're still basically advocating a Killer nerf. In particular, a higher-rank Killer nerf/means of self-defense against toxicity.
---
Think blood hunt started
---
Guys this is a shameless repost from a year ago
---
I think we did -- A pretty good job so far
---
Attempted, the victim made it alive and is all well.
---
I took into account balance. Since it’s not a hex totem a survivor has to deal with it all game. You can no longer take it out of play. It would still have it uses.
---
$$$ for pockets.
---
People keep buying DLC and cosmetics; why put effort into them?
---
Thanks, I didn't even realize! The last year has gone really fast, lol.
---
I don't blame anyone for using in-game mechanics. As long as you don't cheat or exploit, you can play any way you like. If you feel you need to tunnel to win, go ahead. If you can't imagine having fun without playing extra-sweaty, go ahead. Just don't say devs forced you to play this way. It's you who choose the way you play.
---
99% of the time unless I have a daily to mori a survivor and all I have are cypress moris.
---
Exactly. But don’t forget what this post is even about, dude.
---
Otz says that they shouldn’t be surprised to get a ton of Nurses or Spirits for playing in this way. 
---
What do YOU do after playing a team like this? Do you feel incentivized to continue playing the Killer you got destroyed on and mocked the whole match? No!
---
You either stop playing for a bit, or, you go Nurse or Spirit. That’s the whole point of what he said that’s literally the ENTIRE point I was trying to explain. The mindset of someone in that position. If they play something like that, Killer will too. Some Killers just decide to never stop.
---
So, again, you missed the point the video, and myself, were trying to make.
---
So you're saying because you suffered, other players have to suffer?
---
I vote for useless. My first thought was that most people don't heal anyway. The threat of this would be more like a nail in the coffin.
---
* RBT overhaul
---
* Faster teabag
---
* Oink emote
---
If they can ever get him into the game! No clue what his power would be.
---
This is why I'm glad I got 25+ on all killers instead of a huge amount on just one. I would get so bored playing only one killer for 140 games.
---
I want to know more about Ghostface as in my opinion he's really interesting and I find his backstory the most believable. For survivors I'd say Ace as we barely get to know him really besides that he gambles
---
Ayyyy bloodhunt started
---
I want a chance to fight back. If I need to take overpowered perks and killers to have a chance for a pip, I will gladly do it.
---
When does blood hunt start?
---
I see, its still a very nice concept overall.
---
I like it
---
I want to read about a bunch of Legion angst. If only because I'll know BHVR people had to write a bunch of edgy teens talking to each other 😂.
---
IM NOT SURE IF ANYONE ELSE HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM BUT SOME TIMES I WILL ESCAPE A TRIAL BUT I WILL STILL LOSE MY ITEM EVEN THO I ESCAPED
---
no not at all but I am saying I think suffering makes people learn faster in dbd bc whenever I've seen lower ranks play it devolves to 1 of 2 thing camping or just tunneling at least that is how it was when I first started and I would be lying if i said it was bc good SWF groups I became better bc honestly I don't remember but losing is just a thing most ppl hate and SWF are good at making new players lose right? idk all I know right now is my friends are gonna have to learn now
---
Make it spawn on a dull totem at max stacks so its then able to be taken out of the current game. If they do dull totems before it hits max stacks then up to devs either stays on stack right before max or perk disables.
---
Yeah they did, probably they were as confused as me lol
---
This is really cool and having a skin in game like this would be amazing... But shes Babylonian so shouldn't she have darker skin? She would very much be not white considering where she is from.
---
Don't feed the troll
---
Yep that's what it did this last time.
---
Maybe we can get them in clean state at highest rank, morphing with each upgrade til they reach their Killer state.
---
Don’t purposely play like a piece of shit just to ruin the game for others. 
---
I M O, we shouldn’t use moris or at least do it on death hook. Gets you less BP and you’re fucking over the survivors who could’ve gotten more points. 
---
Both sides should always prioritize BPS’s over puddings/cakes. 
---
Survivors shouldn’t farm others for WGLF stacks.
---
Survivors should drop pallets when you know for sure that you’re gonna escape. Also wait at the exit gate for extra points for the killer. Heal each other at the exit gate. This is the one time where purposely stalling the EGC benefits both sides.
---
Adiris is a godess with or without the deforms
---
Switch demo and hag. Perfect
---
She's definitely not my fav but she is way better then rank F, more like B or C.
---
Oh it was a thing? I just came back to the game after 2 years, I didn't know this happened before. Yeah I hope it's an isolated incident too, I don't wanna get banned for something that is not my fault D:
---
Well, thankfully theres only so many killers that try their hardest to make the game unfun for survivors. Otherwise we would spend even longer in queues.
---
I think its more that when something gives you so much success its hard to ignore it if you want success. So thats why you see a lot of "toxic" builds cause others just dont have as much success as the top builds. 
---
Having said that its just what you like as a player and if you like to play a certain way people may not like it and thats fine l, just dont flame or be toxic to them. Be nice.
---
Having a unranked playlist helps alot with this issue too i think.
---
It did say she was sexy as fuck in her lore
---
I feel very, very afraid.
---
Oh boy,
---
Pig to C tier
---
Bubba F tier
---
Huntress A tier
---
Billy A tier
---
Breathtaking work as always. This would be an amazing skin, I would main the fuck out of Plague if something like this came out. With the facial rig they made for Spirit to make her vomiting/chanting animations, I bet something like this would be doable.
---
Human Plague, Nurse and Spirit bhvr pls
---
It is, just played a game and got the double BP
---
They didn’t need to last generation. They don’t even need to this generation, but they want to as it’s what’s best for all of us.
---
The Witches’ Mori would probably be clawing the survivor while they’re downed, just like in L4D... Maybe on Hate 3 (4?) you can kill them?
---
Yea no they tried to get his copy right. Failed.
---
However I'm looking forward to some original content
---
I would absolutely buy this
---
That a great idea but then it fall into NOED territory... just do bones to counter it. This thread is about the perk not being tied to hex totems.
---
The software i used to create base mesh only had 2 skin tones.. i darkened it as best as i could here i thought this looked ok.
---
Does it start today? I haven’t had time to play all week so I haven’t been keeping up with it.
---
What a queen 👏🏻
---
Ghostface can teabag back
---
Plague pukes on you
---
Myers just stalks you
---
Yea it is... just had to Express my thrill
---
Distressing is not necessary on Doctor, unless you want to max out Deviousness with 2 shocks or you are going for a TR build along side Unnerving Presence.
---
I'm using bubba with same setup but I'm using sloppy butcher so survivors are forced to heal giving them bp but that's only if you're nice lol
---
The shit de la shit
---
That's basically the perfect build for Max BP gain so yeah it's pretty good
---
Now I am imagining a Hag cosmetic that makes her look like Freddy...
---
exactly what i was going to say
---
What the actual fuck do you mean you fucking acustic child. Your first point lacks any evidence and literally is just saying "no fuck you your wrong" well done. And my problem with slugging isn't finding people it's that by the time it happens they will pick up their guy, if you leave someone for even 10 seconds while everyone is mid distance away they can have 1 guy go get the downed person while the other two just do gens. Also "chronic tunneler" bitch I use myc you utter bafoon. And I hate ds because you loose fuck tones of time and pressure no matter what you do, it's 2x more effective than any other perk in the game with little to limit its impact let alone counter it.
---
Yup. lmao
---
I felt pretty indifferent about SWF I rarely got that one godlike group that kicked my shit in and whenever I got to play against them I usually found it really fun and learned something new
---
You're fucking nuts but I'm intrigued
---
I often do this as a solo queue player, its called "outplaying a camper". There is little
---
Oink oink!
---
Almost as low effort as survivior players getting easy wins in a game clearly unbalanced in their favor
---
An eye for an eye makes the world blind. Really though being toxic doesn't help toxicity
---
They hurt the game for people who love to play imbalanced match ups. The fact you are arguing for the game to be imbalanced AGAINST killers speaks volumes to what kind of person you are.
---
This is a comment that I said to OP and he/she has not replied to it, yet replied to others because they couldn't come back with anything else, I expect the same from you:
---
"Yes but there's ranks in DBD and they are an indicator of skill, that to me and to everyone else, is a competitive matchmaker.
---
It's not unranked like Quick Play or Casual in OW or Siege, so what is it?
---
Ranked."
---
Argue yourself out of that. We only have ranked. If you don't like it, I am more than glad to get rid of people like you who are inconsiderate for the balance and health of the game.
---
I GOT STEAMROLLED FOR A WHOLE NIGHT AND WHEN I DECIDED ENOUGH IS ENOUGJ TIME FOR MYERS RAMPAGE I GOT SURVIVORS FUCKING 4 LEVELS ABOVE ME AND GOT STEAMROLLED AGAIN
---
Had a guy yesterday teabag after getting a pallet stun on me. After I caught him he disconnected. Wtf.
---
ME AND MY BUDDY HAD THE SWEATTIEST KILLERS AND THE CROUCHIEST TEAMMATES YESTERDAY - BUT THE DAY BEFORE THAT WAS AWESOME!!! RAGE
---
Second wind and inner strength are both great, fixated is good, everything else is... meh.
---
Damn when was the last time you actually played survivor?
---
Otzdarva made me a wraith main
---
Damn that chapel had a rave party in it
---
Till Monday
---
I just finally understood that that means 10/10
---
Imagine putting trapper in the shit tier.. lol. He only struggles against a swf group, adept your traps based on how the survivors play. He can turn a match around in seconds with some good trap placement.
---
Guys chill it a meme like we've done a pretty good job so far
---
does beast of prey even give bloodpoints? shows how much I know lol
---
Whyyy do people say mind game with spirit? More like guessing game. You’re screwed if you are injured. Maybe just maybe not leaving scratch marks is at best sometimes a counter.
---
That's pretty dumb. Who on Earth has heard of a killer that uses a claw device as a weapon?
---
For me and my peon brain, wraith is way too spooky and way too unpredictable. He may be weak but my bladder is weaker.
---
MORI TIME ASSHOLES
---
100% agree and surprised you didn't get downvoted. Is he a badass 100%, does he belong in a horror game, no.
---
Bbq and chili is the only one that can increase the maximum amount of blood pointsas they are awarded post-trial, invest in perks that will improve your gameplay, as the others help you reach the limit
---
Time to pull out the ebonies let’s go
---
4 is the number between 3 and 5. Meaning he is at least the 4th best killer. No, calling Freddy pizza wouldn’t have made more sense.
---
Also if you can find a second person within 5 fucking seconds of downing someone at mid game your playing against actual fucking bots.
---
Distressing, Thrill and Beast or Prey only increase how much points you get TOWARDS THE CAP
---
You're better off just running STRONG perks and doing well
---
[https://youtu.be/j2K8SILr3ls](https://youtu.be/j2K8SILr3ls)
---
Iron Grasp and Agitation is a very strong combo. I recommend using Mad Grit instead of monstrous shrine with those perks. Never use monstrous shrine.
---
Funny i thought of that too, I can just imagine being on a train or bus or something, turning on phone hotspot and playing DbD on the go
---
Head splitter
---
Spirit is fucking bananas my guy.
---
Super fun, but takes a bit of setup.
---
Not a complaint, just an explanation.
---
&gt;A "camper"? WTF is he supposed to do when 3+ survivors are camping the hook? Go patrol empty gens?
---
I didn't say he was wrong for camping but he was camping, wasn't he? How else would you call that? Bonding?
---
&gt;The survivors are the campers, they force him to stay there. There are 0 reasons for him to go away, why would he?
---
Agreed, he could've tried to hit the unhooker twice but he tried to go for the grab.
---
&gt;And "outplaying" lmao
---
It is outplaying. They played that perfectly and everyone got out.
---
Straight into my homework folder
---
Dang, I’m really tempted to give a stat block for them a run! Should I be able to finish it, I’ll be sure to give you credit for the idea :D
---
Clickbait, no chat in comments l
---
Why does the evidence lie within what I said fucking explain why iam wrong instead of just saying iam wrong. Ds doesn't even effect tunneling any different than normal play because ds will be activated and used to the same extent as both. Ds is an issue because the only counter play has counter play in fact the counter play to slugging is rather easy. The ds person is downed while 2 are on gens one waits till it's clear to res the downed, the killer will probably find one but by that time 3 people will be healthy and on gens, atleast if your facing red ranks survivors. If anything the fact you can't understand basic counter play makes me question your knowlage of survivor in general I mean your flair does alude to you being a pig main so maybe you don't play survivor that much
---
That’s the game...of course the killer will kill you if he wants to. And to say there’s no counterplay to tunneling - whether intentional or not - is just false. There’s Borrowed Time. There’s Decisive Strike. There are multiple perks to help you run. Multiple perks to help you heal. You could also *not get hooked*. 
---
Tunneling isn’t something inherently broken in the game. It’s just a tactic that people on the receiving end don’t like. Same as killers not liking getting looped, blinded, “bullied”, etc. I don’t see a reason to introduce a game mechanic over an occurrence that is not only not broken, not inherently wrong in the sense of the game.
---
Do the offerings work as post trial or not?

---
THIS IS DEAD BY DAYLIGHT, WE DON'T HAVE FUN HERE.
---
Why the unnecessary bm on the meg?
---
I want to argue your counter points I really do but you won't fucking make them lol. By just saying well actualy your evidence proves the contrary point without giving evidence that it actualy does makes your point invalid.
---
what spine chill does :
---
-informs you if a killer is running any form of aura reading add-on depending  on circumstances
---
-informs you if a killer is running aura reading perks depending on circumstances
---
-lets you go for unhooks more reliably if you dont know where the killer is, lets you heal after unhook way safer.
---
-basement rescues become alot easier
---
-not being the first one to get found if you want to work on a gen early.
---
-lets you cleanse totems safer.
---
It definitely has its uses and by no means is worthless, I dont know what some people are smoking here. If one person in swf is running it it can give an almost unfair advantage, and solo play also lets it get a bunch of value.
---
It's still a dick move to steal someone else's work and not at least credit them.
---
I'd still be a dick if I tried to pass the Mona Lisa off as my own, and that was made in 1503.
---
Why? Nurse is trash
---
Despite how sneaky I’ve tried to be with traps, against the best of the best survivors they’ll just assign someone to follow me and disarm my traps once I leave, and look around for any I’ve placed elsewhere and do everything they can to disable my power, then get on a gen whenever they can. There’s also the teeny issue of survivors getting out of traps due to good RNG or teammates. You might get the odd trap snag here or there but against very good survivors it gets incredibly boring and frustrating. Against average survivors however, you have a decent chance of doing some serious damage.
---
Why is clown at f?
---
SWF groups are op, and a good killer has nothing he can do vs a good SWF group, especially in a big map like this one
---
Not entirely sure why you're defending it so much, there's nothing really to defend, SWF is known to be op, survivors in general are better off than killers and have been forever. It's a known trait of the game, but it's still a fun game, the clip is more meant to show the absurdity of it
---
DEADHARD IS ALWAY'S BUGGY WITH LAG, SADLY EVEN LITHE SEEMS MORE USEFUL SOMETIMES.
---
Lol he uses the same build for the bad example. Awesome clip, and I appreciate the feedback from this
---
I wanted her to let go so I can get the Feng quicker before she DC'd
---
Wondering that too..
---
Dead hard and even lithe are strictly better. I'd run head on before that doggy doo doo perk.
---
On my BP Michael build, I’m running Monitor and Abuse, BBQ and Chili, Whispers, and Ruin. I try to take advantage of Tier I to get some early game hooks, but as soon as survivors catch on, I throw out the stalks. 
---
Goddamn, there has to be so many killers in queue as I’m now waiting like 5+ minutes for a match on PS4. It’s usually instant while survivor takes forever. It’s always the reverse with respect to the PC experience.
---
I didn't know I wanted this, but I do now.
---
I have done a similar thing with a level 1 wraith no perks no add ons and i mad it to rank 7 and then survivors caught on to my bs and i stopped pipping up and stayed stagnant. I hope it goes really good for you though man!
---
He’s displeased you used the boar axe on huntress
---
&gt;Not entirely sure why you're defending it so much, there's nothing really to defend, SWF is known to be op, survivors in general are better off than killers and have been forever. It's a known trait of the game, but it's still a fun game, the clip is more meant to show the absurdity of it
---
I am just saying, as a solo survivor, I do this **very** often. This has little to do with being SWF and more to the skill of survivors involved.
---
JUST WENT AGAINST MY FIRST LAG SWITCHER FML GAME GOT LAGGY AF WHENER HE WAS CHASIGN SOMEONE YET FINE WHEN NOONE WAS BEING CHASED
---
She struggles on Lerys and some of the Hawkins stuff. Otherwise she’s pretty damn good. And yes, the maps that she can throw over loops she is just as good as spirit. 
---
I think billy struggles on the same maps she does, so I have to give the nod to huntress. 
---
Even hag can challenge billy.
---
Ok
---
...that was the joke
---
So what this addon do is that gives you the ability to keep going IF you want so, imagine someone dropping a palette at you  and you just chainsaw it and dont stop, so you get the kill, or you down a survivor and keep chainsawing to a nearby gen and down another one, but you can just stop whenever you want
---
I do that all the time in solo play.  Funny how some thing only swf play like that.  I know how to win :D   The game is just like a horror movie, gang up to take down the killer :P
---
"Well first off your timing is off she's more bartazyien, second we need this to make another"
---
unless there is a perk you really want instead of the teachable. If you get the teachable you might not get that perk you want again but you get a chance at a perk you want. imo never go for teachable unless the perk it competes against is undesirable
---
Plague and Micheal both have solid one shot potential. Myers with T3 and Plague if people don't cleanse (most solid players won't). They don't have inherent map pressure but they do have solid kill potential due to their powers, Myers also has added bonus of stealth in T2/1 and Plague has solid tracking with purge and the potential for Corrupt Purge, probably one of the strongest abilities in the game.
---
Freddy does have solid map pressure and good anti-loop, but IMO his anti-loop is beaten out by simply one shotting, any mistake will kill a survivor. Hence why Myers, Billy, Plague are higher. And in regards to Billy, his saw is solid for both one shot potential AND map pressure due to speed of traversing the map. With mindgames, being expected to read opponents and win mindgames is kind of the expectation at high ranks for all killers, Billy isn't much of an exception there.
---
I think Demo is solid and could compete with Freddy for top of B, but I don't think he beats out the others in A by a clean margin. He has better map pressure than Freddy with about the same anti-loop, but lacking the sleep/mini-stealth mechanics that Freddy has. Combined with a minor bonus of some tracking with portals.

Pig is personally one of my favorite killers so I may be biased here, but Pig has 0 TR on a button press, which in itself can be really solid for catching survivors off guard and getting gen grabs or like you said, easy first hits. Combine that with RBTs for game slowdown, whether it's good or bad slowdown is RNG dependent, but it's guaranteed slowdown regardless.
---
Listen, I get it. You tunnel. It's ok.
---
I'm currently rank 3 survivor. Usually I'm rank 1 by now but I've been having a ton of fun with Demogorgon. Unlike you, I can provide a screenshot when I get home if you'd like.
---
Still waiting to see your rank.
---
There are several things I feel right now and none of them are good, but take my upvote
---
not even a hour into the event already had a mori bobba that camped every hook lol jesus who camps with mori that man had enough
---
I've had it say 2 seconds before, but I always have to complete the entire 120 seconds for it to give me points.
---
I don't, unless there was non rage quit DCs. If it's a normal game, I play it like a normal game and kill whoever I'm able to get, but if there was something entirely accidental, I cut them some slack.
---
WAHOO!  Time to unlock those Nancy and Demogorgon perks
---
indeed.i just had a "do 3 gens" survivor daily turn into a demogerkin daily.
---
I went against a group of 4. 3 of them red ranks and swf (checked profiles pre match and saw they were friends) round started rough so I placed some obvious "diversion" traps. That took attention away from the real ones, you need to learn placement and how to push them toward your unsafe zones. Dont put traps in basic tank 15 spots. If you play survivor you KNOW where you'd go in a loop, you also probably know where you'd expect a trap. Put it somewhere else on that loop and you'll get them so often. Trapper has the ability to have pressure all over the map even while chasing someone. Your ghostface rating is wrong too, you need to put some hours into them to figure out their niche. I'm a shit nurse but I'm not gonna say she's shit just because I dont have the patience to learn her.
---
Way too strong
---
I'd pop a couple squats if I was going against a THE CLOWN too lol
---
Holy shit you actually used the meme right.
---
STOP MAKING ME REGRET BEING NICE
---
I HOOKED YOU TWICE IN THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES. I SLUGGED YOU THE THIRD TIME I CAUGHT YOU BECAUSE IT'S NO FUN DYING SO SOON IN THE GAME. DON'T "GGEZ" BECAUSE YOU EVADED CAPTURE THE REST OF THE GAME.
---
Totems should be removed from the game imo. There is too big a gap between survivors on comms with spawns memorized and survivors that actually have to look for totems without sharing what's already been checked/cleansed.
---
The spawns themselves are also not good and there's not a great way to fix the spawns to make them more random and less visible.
---
The difference is, you as survivor you are eliminated from the game, and if killer decides to tunnel you, unless there is a huge skillgap they will eliminate you eating Decisive and hitting you through Borrowed Time. I mean, everybody had those games, you probably had them too.
---
Nurse finds you, she downs you, hooks you, pretending to be somewhere else after (no visual and no Terror Radius) and then actually coming back as soon as you were unhooked she does the same again. And so you're dead with like 2k bp if you couldn't loop you or 8k bloodpoints if you somehow could.
---
As a killer tho, I am the one controlling my game. I can get looped or genrushed at times, but mostly I know exactly what I did wrong and how I could have played it differently and learn from it. As a survivor you can loop better to stall the killer for a longer time, but in most cases you are essentially sentenced to death if the killer desires it, you are just buying more time for your teammates.
---
could be solo players not everyone in solo queue has 1 brain cell
---
Yeah. I think I just loaded up for like 10 mins. And I got a dc
---
Is it even a child or is he far away?
---
Yes, actually. Cochineal pigments stain the shit out of everything, too!
---
Ordering anything over 100 bucks on Ali seems like too much of a gamble.
---
If you use those take advantage of it and basement hook them
---
But why? [Same post but different](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d9ig86/oink/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
Is there a difference?
---
Sorry but yes.
---
So many killers. If this continues, I’ll get on my survivor as I have a BP farming build with them.
---
I told ya, Adiris is the hottest DBD girl, even the way she walks is cute.
---
So OP is Luigi
---
My post contained the sentence "try to not trigger anyone" ofc there would be at least 1 of these comments, its the part of the fun.
---
If the killer bm's me on the hook, I'm making them wait every second.
---
Yeah if they were to do someone like hag, everyones gonna need to do a double take haha
---
Offerings will affect your base score. So if you play a pudding or party streamers, you will double your score, along with BBQ which will also double your base score. 
---
So let’s say you get 30k as a base score, it adds another 30k for BBQ stacks, another 30k for pudding/streamers offering, and another 30k for the Bloodhunt event. This gives you a grand total of 120k for one game!
---
Who was in the swf?
---
So much this. I hate running around farming with the killer for 15 
---
 boring minutes and would much rather just play the game.
---
Thank you! I thought it was a bug only I was getting, so I was annoyed thinking I was missing something.
---
I WISH WE COULD UNLEARN TEACHABLES.
---
then 18+ version please.
---
I quit farming like a year ago.  Just gets way too boring and takes too long.  I'd rather just play my games straight win or lose.
---
Farming is incredibly boring, and you should be getting 25k-30k bp per game as killer even without farming. I mean if 4 or 5 of us bring bloody party streamers I’m down to farm otherwise I want to actually play the game.
---
The one and only
---
Just imagine a series of chapters with 2 killers and survivors each where the killers are each one of the current survivors and the survivors and each one of the killers.
---
So like Trapper and Nurse and their respective survivors, Hag and Doctor and their respective survivors, etc.
---
First Bloodhunt match: One DC, one mori, one slug, and my dumbass 🎉🙌🏻
---
A lot of fan art in general doesn't look like the source material. I get it's a matter of creativity and personal taste but it's something that's always bothered me.
---
Can finally get good at nurse
---
Errrr. She is from Babylon. Couple years and miles of your mark.
---
This is clearly the finished product other post wasn't.
---
What's with the dodgy looking toe poking through? I zoomed in and it looked like a bollock.
---
Oh hey it’s me I’m pink power ranger! Me and my friend were SWF and it showed us as you DC’d after we left that’s so funny,
---
And really you’re going to say ‘broken’ with noed and bbq with a cake? Don’t pretend like you weren’t trying to be greedy coming up in this sub with ‘broken’
---
it would be cool to have these skins but half/half so half normal, half corrupted
---
I mean, what else does he expect them to do? The one advantage survivors have over killers is numbers, so in the end game when the gates are powered it makes more sense than ever to take hits and help your teammate get out. I run Bond and do this for randoms pretty often when I play survivor so it doesn’t really prove anything. 
---
“I just want to play against normal survivors.”
---
Uh, yeah, we all want to play against “normal” (read: “not as good”) survivors, but you can’t win every single match. They played smart, it happens.
---
Chapter XIV: White Noise
---
Even if they dont slug you, most killers dont expect you to have Tenacity. Can't even tell you how many times a killer has lost me because they walked away after downing me (to break a pallet or something) and couldnt find me afterwards because they didnt expect me to get that far. Combine that with Unbreakable and you've got a wonderful combo that you can run alongside some other good perks. You'd be surprised how often it can help you out.
---
I see. No offense tho. Good work.
---
I would love the “normal” skins of killers to just be new survivors and demented versions of the survivors to become killers. Imagine Nurse, Doctor, Hag, and one of the Legion gang being chased by Feng who’s like 8ft tall and a monster.
---
I’d pay.
---
I believe in their hotfixes about as far as I can throw Santa Claus
---
Me and Claudette with the obscene name, he was Black power ranger but he changed it :,( I’m super triggered
---
Depends how many BPS are used
---
If more then 2,i'll just farm
---
*sweaty
---
Nooooooo!
---
I'm aware of that, but you lumped up what I consider entirely legitimate playstyles together with very obvious toxicity. Which is a big issue from my PoV as well, because it creates ground for people to claim that killers are crybabys, because they're referring to legitimate strategies as toxic, and thus the entire topic is void.
---
I was not talking about the OP, or the very valid opinion contained therein, I was talking about that specific, quoted paragraph of yours.
---
None taken man much love.
---
Yeah that would be pretty cool. Only problem is explaining why the entity makes people taller hmm
---
This is why I'll never get the Switch or PC version.
---
i feel it. idk i try not to kill just for the sake of bp farming plus alot of new people to the game now. lol but idk maybe i just think of bp weekend as a way of being lazy, and talking to my chat
---
"in low ranks"? - See you in high ranks..
---
I do this sometimes if I notice that my survivors are really new and don't really know how to play yet. I don't see why it would be frowned upon, especially for double BP weekend.
---
Replace distressing with ruin to slow the game down, just a little bit and you're good
---
They become taller as they become twisted versions of themselves in life. Hag was a little girl at first so even she probably grew and she’s not very tall in the first place.
---
Much better
---
Some people like it, some people dislike it. It’s not gonna get you into trouble so the worst that’ll happen is someone gets mad at you for doing it, but who cares?
---
idk why it made me laugh lol
---
Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding!
---
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!
---
You're this subs one millionth matchmaking is broken post.  You win a years supply of Shasta Cola!  I just want to thank the wonderful people of Shasta for sponsoring this event.  Remember folks when you're sick of Coke and Pepsi think Shasta.  Shasta....mmmmm mmmmmmmm that's tasty.
---
I dunno about same rank, but they are close enough.  Besides only players who are really bad at the game are in ranks 16-20.  The game isnt that hard to play once you understand how to loop, do gens and hook. Very simple mechanics.
---
As a killer main, they have good reason for don’t, I feel gross playing nurse or spirit
---
That’s awesome
---
Those child-bearing hips though
---
Not even gonna try and hit anyone body blocking?  I mean at that point you're not gonna get the Borrowed Time Unhooked player nor the person you hit unhooking, you might get lucky and down a body blocker, especially considering they were all packed together tightly?  
---
I feel like he zeroed in on the injured survivors, even knowing that they were probably going to make it to the exit gates instead of scoring some hits and another potential down.   It's easy to say when we're watching after the fact too, though.
---
Still no dedicated servers but implementing a battle pass?
---
Yeah, I can already see the ensuing backlash.
---
Facts
---
I let people escape when they stay still when i hit them. Or its a baby dwight or a claudette helping me kill one of her teammates.
---
It must've gotten easier considering I'm rank 9, soon rank 8 now, there is no way I'm that good lmao
---
What is wrong with Superman or Spider-Man?
---
I haven’t laughed this hard in a while. Thank you 😂
---
Lol and insta med kit SWF isn’t toxic? Please. And the cake is for everyone not just me.
---
forgive me for asking but, who is this?
---
Shiiiiiiit forgot about that :/
---
I watched this game, happened a couple hours ago. It was definitely a 4 man swf, you could yell by the way they played. One of them was running object against his ghostface, the amount of times he legitimately gets stream sniped could lead one to think this was a 4 man swf stream snipe and the game played out like that. True got stressed out. That game would have stressed anyone out.
---
Tier 1 Myers with the chainsaw is so OG and hilarious. Always worth a repost of just those images.
---
Also I’m not complaining about you and your friends play. I’m saying the devs literally said yesterday and it’s not supposed to average out SWF ranks for killers anymore and clearly that’s exactly what happened here.
---
Isn't DbD 18+ already?
---
Slenderman is basically the closest we've gotten to a modern horror icon, and he would draw in a bunch of new players to the game.
---
Jason only used traps in the remake from what I remember
---
Just a little bit
---
Yeah but this is 18++. Big difference. I would know, there’s an extra +.
---
I wheeze so hard whenever i see it, by far my favourite picture ever to come out of dbd
---
If you ended up in the match you're okay its people who are doing it that got in trouble.
---
Paulie esther on youtube has old videos of the last time it happened showcases a love intrest between the trapper and pig.
---
when does the funny part start
---
That's why it'd be two killers and 8 survivors
---
That is awesome. Ez mil
---
Not even kind of. It's a cool skin, but it's just more in line with the "Junkyard" theme.
---
Honestly I thought I was about to get shredded, my heart rate was through the roof
---
I'll play like normal from now on out, since it seems bad killers are hitting the gen to imply "Lets farm" when actually they just want easy kills.
---
ight imma head out
---
I just can’t think of how Jason would fit into the meta without being boring.
---
Maybe he could be a second projectile thrower like Huntress.
---
What if he had a machete and a harpoon gun.
---
You hit a survivor with the harpoon and they have a limited time to struggle out before Jason slowly reels you in and grabs you.
---
Stridor is good on Spirit
---
I agree
---
Her lore explains it.
---
This is the only game that makes my heart beat through my chest
---
True, I usually just hook twice and let them escape if they're not toxic to me
---
Thanks for rendering.
---
Everyone is getting leveled for me this weekend lol. Running doc with survivor pudding and bbq and chilli all weekend to get as much as I can
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d9m8i2/i_found_a_bug_where_bt_doesnt_trigger_more_in/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
So not sure if this extra info is useful, but before the clip started, I went into a locker for DS and stunned the killer, then went for the save. Not sure why BT didn't trigger but I hope this gets fixed.
---
Getting Nancys teachables and then finishing up P3 Steve. Currently P1 lvl 50
---
Why is her toe standing through her dress?
---
That would be awesome.
---
That's fine, its staying up.
---
people care about rank too much on this game, this isn’t league or overwatch. Just get your bloodpoints and go next match or even better take some notes on why you couldn’t 4K and incorporate that in your next game.
---
Speaking of, is that ability not on the Xbox one version, because I tried it but didn't break the pallet.
---
WHY DO MY TEAMMATES ALWAYS HAVE URBAN EVASION?!?!
---
I see EDP, I upvote.
---
Wish granted, Adi doesnt wear a shirt as is.
---
BBQ ftw
---
You could’ve been the only killer available man, there’s probably other systems in place like their adjustments for shorter ques, if they removed those patch fixes our wait times would be even longer then they already are, 
---
You are missing the point which is you got a balanced match, 2 randoms and 2 SWF.
---
You are complaining about matchmaking yes? It is not always going to be perfect so adjust and play or move along and name shaming is against sub rules sorry you are new around here
---
And who said anything about toxic? Can you not put words in my mouth you do not speak for me
---
This is some top tier meme right here.
---
He is just protecting his box.
---
I run Small Game every game now because of how common hex: ruin and noed are
---
Jesus I jumped.
---
Don't you dare disrespect the entity
---
She's gorgeous but I wouldn't want this skin in the game. It would just be really jarring seeing her puke in game lol.
---
Look everyone! Somebody who can actually use this template correctly! Give him tour upvotes now!
---
Niiice, Coincidentally I asked monday as a day off, so my stonks will see an increase.
---
Who plays at average ranks? :) jk
---
Getting 3 done in 80 seconds requires ideal conditions, but getting 3 done in 2 minutes or less is absolutely achievable in most games just through good survivor play without toolboxes/comms/perks.
---
I've not really done much to Steve so far. I want to max Nancy out with all perks as I've got Jeff and nea so far.
---
dang that sucks dude
---
If the bathroom gen (I think thats where they are) is done then it's basically a wasted portal to nowhere tho.
---
cant relate
---
I will get Steve and Nancy to 40 for their teachables and then dump all my points into killers.
---
You should look at that otz thread in the front page.
---
I'm struggling getting into killer games as I had the same plan as you haha.
---
Yeah. Things like the massive cooldown on certain killer perks or the deviousness score on some killers are a giveaway.
---
Then they have useless survivor perks and an over-nerfed MoM.
---
It's just a mess
---
Sloppy, ruin, tremendous?
---
Nice mate. What killers do you main? I switched to survivor but I'm switching to PC next week so I'll probably go back to killer.
---
Jokes on you that my fetish !
---
Indirect Huntress buff
---
reading the responds. i feel it gets boring  aswell . i normally get 2 hooks and then just slug most of the time. but ill let them escape.
---
Probably get Nancy to P3 50 all perks then dump my bp into my main Killers for some add ons
---
In before someone calls you a tunneler
---
Inb4 it’s Haunted Ground and now you’re fucked.
---
look at that smug son of a bitch shaking his head
---
The red stain is unnecessary at least. You could actually be jump scared by a few without it. And it's unfair to the killer anyway, makes it difficult to mindgame at loops, which are broken to begin with.
---
More bp for bbq, but ruin 2 is actually better than tier 1 whereas bbq isnt. Tough choice, your call
---
But normally, when the killer picks up a survivor on their shoulder, they normally put their arm over the survivors back, and his arms are too long to do that.
---
That's my plan but not the killer part at the end.
---
Reminds me of someone from the Papa's games
---
cool, no one panic and start running. just like every normal day
---
Sure "Killer Main" If you would really know how the game works, you would know how to counter a nurse.... but i guess getting gud isnt an option \`Hmmmm ?
---
Ye just play normally, I also had a spirit who I ran for 3 gens. Then she started hitting the generator so I was like, oh she wants to farm.
---
Got on gen, she ripped me off and I was like it's okay she wants hook and stacks and then she tunneled me off it till death, after game she was like "Enjoy dying? farming idiots."
---
I mean I wasn't farming to begin with, just running from the killer? lol.
---
I hope I don’t come across you as a survivor
---
Yeah guy tried to sound like a survivor main who doesn't ever play Killer. Then proceeded to laugh at me and constantly BM me on the hook. Told him he'd be famous on Reddit and he was just like "Hi Reddit!"
---
has to be bbq, but yeah that sucks
---
Anybody with half a brain can hit a skillcheck regardless of the sound que. Only thing you need to do is fucking look at the centre of your screen. Also it takes 5 hooks for it to do that and if the gates are not powered after 5 hooks, you were propably losing already
---
I can feel how scarred she must've felt
---
Haha you are literally arguing for unbalanced matchups by screwing SWF groups into going against high rank killers even if there is only one high rank player on the team.
---
My personal situation is that I'm a rank 3 survivor but I have a lot of friends that play that are in the 12-15 range... There are not near my level but we have a blast playing together, and to be honest we usually get smoked because they aren't the best and we don't try to be... But now we go up against rank 1-4 killers everytime and they just don't enjoy the game anymore... Video games are about having fun and in my opinion all games are more fun with friends, but this change very obviously discourages playing with friends no matter how you look at it.
---
And I'm not really sure what you want me to argue myself out of.. You didn't really make a point but stated the obvious that there currently is only a ranked system and the point that was made is that maybe there should be a ranked and unranked or casual game mode for people that want to just have fun.... And if they don't want to split the board then they have to have a balance between ranked play and casual fun so that everyone can enjoy the game... 
---
And players like myself discussing possible solutions aren't the problem, it's toxic pieces of shit like you that can't just argue your point but have to attack the person because you really don't have a leg to stand on.
---
Was pretty obvious by the looks of your teammate
---
Idk bout this list mane
---
She’s perfectly counterable I hope you realize that. Or you know *get gud*
---
This is the type of enthusiasm I want, but can't seem to get.
---
Survivors can suck sometimes, but at least they can't actively ruin games like pos killers can
---
would be great if they could finally make some seasonal map changes
---
I said something about toxic. You really need to calm down.
---
What about the Demogorgon's arms though? His arms are like as long as Slenderman's. I think even longer
---
I got debunked
---
You’re right, I guess I’ve just not seen the gorgons carry animations
---
the pig. I just got her. I've been grinding for a few days now. I'm at 900k. I'm grinding bp for the pig because her perks and abilities. favorite killer so far.
---
I mean you're spot on... Clearly there is no easy fix and there is no way to please everyone... But like you said left as-is will hurt the game. My friends are already moving on to Borderlands 3...
---
Doing gens, you?
---
If you see her charging her blink just run towards her and flashlights stop her blink and she can still be pallet stunned mid blink
---
Boo hoo ;(
---
Yeah nips are much horrifying than serial killers brutally murdering people, I can agree here
---
Summer is already over, nice promise there
---
Eleven?
---
You may play both but you have little understanding into playing killer if you think Huntress Lullaby would be fair as a standard perk.  The only reason more people don't run it is because it can be taken away at any point.  Remove this weakness and this becomes among the best perks in the game.  This isn't balance man.
---
Does that mean we’d get naked Freddy as Hag?
---
I struggle with the pig. I just don't have the patients haha.
---
Are you on console or PC?
---
“I fucking hate all the killers in this stupid fucking game.” now that’s a fucking mood.
---
I AM SO SICK OF CLAUDETTES. HAD ONE THE OTHER DAY THAT KEPT LEADING THE KILLER TO ME AND TEAMMATES WHEN WOUNDED. AFTER WE ALL DIED FOUND OUT SHE WAS RUNNING EMPATHY AND BOND TO PURPOSEFULLY DO THAT. EVERY TIME I SEE ONE IN A LOBBY THIS HAPPENS. FUCKING RIDICULOUS.
---
You aren't acting like the person Mr. Rogers knew you could be.
---
Terrifying, i know. Just the thought of a small, pink, mostly useless pink nub gives me the creeps.
---
THE TOE LOL
---
Smol font
---
Console. I only have one perk and I've gotten 2 4ks lol. Did you play on pc or console?
---
It’s almost like it’d be super frustrating to have to go against that on your first Nintendo switch™️®️©️ dead by daylight game....... while you learn the controls.....
---
Same here buddy, I used to play wraith because he looked cool, got bullied and tbagged so I switched to ghostface because I thought it was like the "next best thing" for a stealth killer but even than I got tbagged. So currently I'm resting on Hag and she's been quite fun to play.
---
it says they have to be hit inside the exit gates, it becomes a mind game where you try to bait out a hit outside of the gates and then run in, it gives killers a chance to get a kill on someone who they normally wouldnt have and it discourages survivors from being toxic and teabagging in front of the exit.
---
Offerings and perks aren't Toxic, behavior is...
---
Keep disrespecting Trapper.... you underestimating him gets me my 3k.
---
Well not ALL. Just every single person so desperate for a 4K that, WITH NOED, they lie and pretend they don't play Killer.
---
Like what worthless piece of shit does that?
---
I never said im professional.
---
Love the pig, I'll keep my fingers crossed to a slight buff on her but if not it won't stop me from bear trapping heads.
---
So yes, these bonuses will stack but know it’s additive, not multiplied, if that makes sense. 
---
So a perfect 32k game with...
---
* 4 stacks of WGLF/BBQ (another 32k)
---
* Cake/pudding offering (another 32k)
---
* Bloodhunt (another 32k) 
---
This would give you your max personal earning of 128k BP in a match.
---
If other players use bloody party streamers, you will get 32k for each offering. 
---
If anyone uses a Gateau, you will get 32,960 BP for each one used (since it is 103% bonus). 
---
I honestly can’t recall the percent bonus for envelopes so forgive me for leaving that out. 
---
Please anyone, if my math is off, let me know. XD
---
I wasn’t rude to you. I said nothing about you. This post literally has nothing to do with you, just your rank which you have no control over. It was all about the matchmaking. Somehow you made this an attack on you.
---
Oh you know it man, thats one thing that happens every BP event.  Dont forget the player rules, Farm or I DC and No Moris or sacrifices.  lol
---
that one time I tried using Nancys perk to get healed in a locker AND ALMOST EVERY TOTEM WAS GONE #TotemsforNancy
---
You’re welcome!!!
---
Yeees
---
Doctor would love you looking solely at the center of the screen
---
Her addons are broken, base Nurse is fine
---
Freddy still has the best lung in the game, amazes me every time I use it.  Its pure dream magic :D
---
First off, if anyone is prepared for a skillcheck they can easily miss it.  Second off, your second point is completely wrong, you can have 2 gens left and still have 5 people hooked
---
Right, but the EGC is already there to stop survivors from teabagging endlessly at the gates. My worry is more it discouraging survivors from going for saves. 'He's probably got that new perk, even if I unhook them. I've got time, but it's added danger. I wont bother.'
---
Ah so it adds to the total, not multiply
---
We want justice BHVR!
---
Haha some killer just asked me to farm and I said no because a similar situation happened to me. Some people just seem to get off on making people miserable.
---
I think making trapper start with all his traps would be a fair buff or a good starting point anyway
---
In before someone calls OP a camper
---
"sends a picture of his daily being done, telling me thanks"
---
I find that pretty funny, and come on man...never trust anyone in DBD.  Its everyone for themselves in the end
---
Nice design but probably not gonna happen
---
that's if the huntress can aim, there's plenty that could hit survivor that's right next to them
---
It takes *what feels like* forever though to convince them "hey, pal just farm."
---
If I see a p2 or p3 in the lobby I'll usually try to find them and smack a gen/pallet. They're like my liaison to let the other 3 know it's all good
---
This format is getting a little worn out now
---
What system were you on? I'm on PS4
---
A large portion of the playerbase have played for awhile, and enjoy ruining the game for newer players who could use extra BP to catch up. Yes, I'm one of them.
---
Just had this this happen to me R.I.P
---
Gotta maximize them bloodpoints.
---
those aren't survivors, it's a swf
---
It’s necessary. Hag, Freddy and Demo don’t have to go around and pick up traps. Not just that, but their traps are arguably more deadly or offer more utility AND can be quickly and easily replaced. Bear traps can be easily disarmed or even sabotaged. Starting with all his traps should without a doubt be a thing.
---
When someone tells me they hate playing killer and need help with a daily, it's not funny when they then laugh at me, bm me and act like a human pile of garbage
---
I do
---
That’s not very cash money of you
---
My killer queues have been the same during the few hours of the Bloodhunt as without it in NA purple ranks atm.
---
What I’d love is if we had “The Mantle,” with respect to lore we got last Halloween.  Vigo is a survivor, but his experiments on the killers seems to push him towards someone the entity could use to kill.  He wears that cloak, so it could be a survivor-esque killer that has cosmetics as all the survivors wearing the mantle and twisted into killers.  I’d love to see a monstrous take on the survivors.
---
lul I hope this is sarcasm
---
To be fair, I just ran into a swf named "let's farm" and the entire group proceeded to blow through gens and flashlight click me the entire game. Then at the end got told that I wasn't farming. I'm literally running a build for farming and running a limited on bubba. If I wanted kills why the hell would I nerf the only thing leatherface has going for him? Not to mention how the hell am I gonna get bbq stacks without hooking people? 
---
At the end of the game I literally could have secured at least one kill and instead I went after someone I hadnt hooked. 
---
Yea, makes sense, I'm totally not farming at all.
---
I imagine that they'd be a little easier to see like this, so only do this when I'm survivor plz bhvr
---
She doesnt need a nerf. Some of her addons on the hand do.
---
it really depend of the map. and this is only a fanart it probably won't make it in the game and even if it does it would be only for the Halloween event ^^
---
sure she is couterable, but its so extreamly boring to just throw away everything you know about playing survivor and start playing a boring playstyle. and she is S+, with argument. atleast nerf her lounge and make her S..
---
not more than they already do ^^ those Dull are harder since theya re not white anymore.
---
I get bored playing just one killer so I usually go through a rotation and play them all except Nurse because I am in red ranks and suck as Nurse
---
I actually ended up going for Ruin, but I got BBQ in the next skill tree anyways.
---
Tony Hawk killer holy shit yes
---
sorry i see a totem i cleanse :P
---
Yeah lots of people don't prestige anymore as people just buy the outfits haha.
---
Before we complain about Killers we should fix swf \^\^
---
Planning to p3 steve, it'll be my first prestige survivor despite all being 50
---
You get BP by playing you don't need to farm....
---
I get the frustration but think of it, if matchmaking was spot on based on rank youd be sitting in queues for hours, the game doesn't have 50k people playing and some ranks have waay more players than other ranks. 
---
For me a red rank matching with a brown rank, that's an issue but red rank matching with green or purple i think that's okay.
---
You coulda stopped after the first sentence
---
Basically they could just give the trapper a hockey mask cosmetic and call it a day.
---
Smashing Pumpkins? I love it.
---
Which would come first? Dedicated servers or optimization?
---
I am very glad you didn't! That was a delightful video.
---
And this is what we need
---
thats so much bm
---
Good luck with it mate. I've prestiges Claudette P3 new P1 meg p1 tapp P1 Myers P1 doc P1 and I think that's it.
---
No .
---
He does not belong in a fucking horror game, he is not an original character, and the dlc survivors are in a Horror genre. Some people just don't get it I suppose. Wahhhh I want my Tony Hawk, like fuck off
---
The gen in the video itself isn't even done, that's what he put the portal there for.
---
Want to P3 my Bill, mainly.
---
It really does sound nice being able to play DBD on the go. Mmm...
---
i play dbd mobile on beta, well its very nice since i cant play on pc. the bad news is, survivor is fucked if not having iron will. the auto aim will just moving killer head to the injured survivor even survivor is hiding. hiding is pointless
---
That doesn't mean you're not still a babysurvivor.  I played a swf lobby full of them yesterday they were all rank 2,3 or 5 and played like rank 18's.  Your opinion on killers being a joke to pip up with but survivors being hard makes you sound like you were in that group.
---
I mean this is all i want when i say nurse needs an nerf.
---
I like to call it a videogame, anything is possible as long as you an imagine it.
---
I’m pretty sure capcom can’t copyright the name David King or shirtless men. I’m pretty sure it’s just coincidence as they have no other similarities
---
Of course, you are completely right. But if people are mad because they died, logic is disregarded and they will find something to blame you for. That‘s all I‘m saying with the post (which wasn‘t meant to be that serious). 
---
Completely agree with you though, if everyone just bitched gens and totems etc. and went for nothing else, the game would be dead by now.
---
Ash wouldn't work with that system either because on a TV in the original Halloween his movie can be seen playing.
---
Oh I was about to say Scream mentions Michael Myers aswell
---
Your asking me to Fuck off??? HAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH your the person complaining about potential new content in the game seriously how pathetic do you have to be its not gonna hurt the game at all your immersion won’t be broken buddy let people have fun you fucking party pooper for Christ sakes
---
Shut up nerd I have like 1.5k hours, I just meant I feel like it’s easier to pip playing as killer than it is as survivor.  It’s not that deep.
---
Maybe different universes exist, there is one where Michael was an actual killer, and there is one, where he is just a character in a movie, if you read too much into a game's lore you can find LOTS of plot holes, such as this one lol
---
What compelled you to make a reddit post about this
---
Ok fair point. I am mostly wondering about how BHVR would work around the conflict in game
---
So what you could have said is Freddy is S tier. Gotcha.
---
Why are you expecting players to farm, it's not like you absolutely have to
---
Maybe they don’t have any, or used them all, stop acting so entitled
---
That’s fantastic art!
---
Deliverance makes second wind take 3x the amount of time before you heal though
---
Killer kills me *surprised pikachu*
---
I am one of those ppl, along with my brother, when we use either a BPS or birthday cake we get mori'd or 1 hooked.  On the killer side, we get zero hooks all game.  People play different when they see BPS, like a shark in the water effect I swear :(
---
Yeah its taking a little while for me too but im getting like 100k-120k a game so its worth the wait lol
---
Honestly I’m most concerned for Demogorgon.
---
Getting Steve and Nancy to 40, then getting their teachables on my man Jeff.
---

---
instead of making a rage post, you should take note on how you let 4 people escape that way it doesn’t happen again and guess what, maybe YOU can then climb the ranks

---
In before someone calls OP an incel
---
Nerd lol.  I see you're taking the intellectual route with your response.  Again playtime doesn't matter.  A potato that's played for 1.5k hours is still a potato you know?  Your opinion just kind of lends itself to that of a babysurvivor so it's difficult for me to imagine you as a particularly strong player.  Also it is quite easy to pip up soloqueue.  Randoms suck so you usually end up carrying the game anyways.  Just play to pip.  If you get out cool but if not you just got to make sure you do enough across the categories to rank up.  It isn't hard.  I'm a primarily soloqueue player myself.
---
I was thinking something like stalking + madness power, if you stalk them to max level survivors screen will be distortioned af + illusions
---
Yeah, it just happend to me. I completed a sabo ritual only for it to not give me bloodpoints and switch to a savior ritual. I lost a good toolbox too D:

So it has been started, but hot damn, I am a boss with Freddy lunge.  I dont know what it is, maybe due to his height, I  dunno...but I like it and hate it
---
Those are perks not offerings silly
---
Now this dude definitely gonna have to go into witness protection smh
---
Woosh
---
MY DAAILY RITUALS KEEPS BUGGING AND EVERY TIME I COMPLETE ONE IT GIVES ME NO BLOODPOINTS AMD SWITCHES TO A DIFFERENT ONE. ITS HAPPENED 3 TIMES NOW, AND THATS LIKE, A LOT OF BLOODPOINTS.
---
Lmao the game is killer sided as hell which is why it’s so funny when he says this game is unbalanced. I actually can’t stand this guy, entitled as fuck, overall just acts like a nine year old whenever the survivors do their only objective, survive.
---
Someone finally used the meme correctly.
---
Thats the guy who runs small game, detective's hunch, and always has a rainbow map
---
When a killer claims to be a survivor main who hates playing killer asks you to help him get his dailies done, then decides to laugh at you, bm you and send a picture of their completed daily, I THINK that gives someone a right to be pissed
---
Entity magic is my best bet
---
How do you farm in DBD as killer?
---
I’m at work but I plan on spending a few hundred thousand on Bubba to hit P3 50.  After that I’m undecided.  I want to prestige my Ash, Freddy and Trapper and need to unlock more perks and add-ons for most of my killers.
---
I haven’t even touched my Stranger things.
---
Bug or hack?
---
Yes they do, as a fictional character. I know this because I watched the Dead Meat kill count .
---
Why though, you'll get less bp overall if you just rush through matches that take a long time to get.
---
I’d tongue punch her fart box
---
Wouldn't mind tbagging if the game was balanced. Fun part is that they have the time to annoy you and easily win, bubba is the only killer that can punish it
---
THIS IS TOO RELATABLE, I AM A SURVIVOR MAIN AND HAVEN'T HAD A SURVIVOR RITUAL SINCE JULY!!!!
---
I knew she was gonna be hot
---
I’d like to go one comment without someone trying to dismiss anything that I quote from Tru3, just one.
---
so you are camping killer huh, usually killer wont get enough distance to grab if killer chasing surv that want to rescue. even good survivor wont go to rescue if killer chasing them. or maybe you play in low rank?
---
anime girl art of quentin is (sadly) pretty rare though
---
but i didnt
---
Press L1, not R1
---
If everyone is gonna be intoxicated you should definitely use some stealth killers like Myers and Ghostface. Jumpscares galore!
---
Myers and buba?
---
I still wanna know what happened to our boy Benedict.
---
In the trash
---
Ah, I must have missed the part where moris were only usable once you reached above rank 10. My mistake. And I must have missed the part where the game was balanced a limited consumable item that you're under no obligation to use, particularly one that absolutely thrashes the typical game flow with no option for countering it by the survivors.
---
As to "self-defense against toxicity", that statement is just so asinine I'm not even touching it.
---
Use the bp event to just stockpile scratched mirrors.
---
This is my attitude every game. It's all about the fun!
---
If he was that good of a person, he wouldn't get this much hate. I personally hate sheeps that think he is a god at everything he does or say
---
Turn on the game
---
Everything you said is true.
---
what if they just gave her one blink, period. Would fix her and she would still be better than good.
---
And the classic brand new part addon
---
In my experience most of my games last about 8-15 minutes and end in a 3-4k with 1-2 gens left. It's universally stacked against survivors and most killers run Ruin, NOED, BBQ, and rather a mix up on the fourth perk but almost always Sloppy.  
---
Most survs run Adrenaline, DS, Self-Care, and an exhaustion perk of some sort. I rank 16-11 at any given point of the month. I escape maybe 15-20% of the time via the gates and about 5% of the time via hatch. Killers mostly tunnel or go for the easy prey and if you loop them even a little they will camp you and often beat on you at the hook until you die.  
---
There's an average of 1 DC every 2 games and it's not uncommon for 2-3 to DC about every 5 games. Most DC's happen if they are downed in under the first minute before they can accumulate any BP.
---
Yep. Just played a couple of matches already

---
awesome thanks guys
---
Remember kids don't drink and drive
---
Groovy
---
Yeah, Ash talks. Plague does as well, but she’s speaking ancient Babylonian or something.
---
Anytime I hear the killer open a locker like this I know it’s time to sprint for it.
---
Yep. Me too. It would be interesting to have him show up as a killer or something.
---
Jeff is the best mate. Not many use him now though.
---
yo do u have a youtube ot something you will post this on?
---
this person finds dc'ing toxic, I think we found the pinnacle of sensitivity.  Like, it may be toxic towards other survivors, but to the killer? What a man.
---
play what you like the most. dont follow trend because they are get 4k. i usually play trapper and pig. not because they are good with 4k and ez win. because is it funny to see they trapped in bear traps and seeing them desperately for escaping reverse bear traps
---
Oink

THIS WEEK A LOOPED A GHOSTFACE FOR FIVE GENS, I FLIPPING VAULTED AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW AWAITING A JUICY BALANCE LANDING AS I'D YET TO USE UP EXHAUSTION AND THESE ENTITY BLIGHTED HITBOXES HAD ME HIT MID FALL... NOT EVEN BY THE WINDOW, WHEN I ALMOST HIT THE GROUND?!?!?!?
---
TO TOP IT OFF HE HAD NOED AND CAMPED ME BY THE HOOK. I KILLED MYSELF ON HOOK TO STOP PEOPLE SAVING ME FROM THAT NONSENSE. THE KILLER SAID GG EZ AT THE END OF THE GAME AND TO TOP IT OFF I DEPIPED AND TERRIBLE BLOOD POINTS BECAUSE THE ENTIRE GAME WAS SPENT RUNNING AWAY FROM THE SPOOKY BOI.
---
PLS
---
Yeah but in that time you can have 2-3 survivor games so I'm just grinding them haha.
---
Thing is, all killers have the same lunge, but Freddy's model is so small that his lunge's hitbox doesn't sit right with his small model, same thing with Hag too
---
yeah, it's supposed to come soon. maybe in the mid-chapter?
---
that's pretty spooky, not gonna lie
---
Some people dont want to farm cant say i blame them
---
Jumpscare Myers, Ghost face, or Wraith with no bell sound

Time to go twirl myself into some friendships! I'll do this with clown so his jiggly tummy really helps sell it lol
---
And that’s exactly what hooking them does. Except with hooking, killers don’t have to worry about losing their downed survivor, a friendly picking them up (thus saving a health state), any perks that heal survivors one state up, the downed survivor crawling out the exit/hatch, and also has a shorter clock which forces other survivors off gens even faster. 
---
Yeah, map pressure is good.
---
If there are 4BPS+, I willingly farm just for the points.
---
i’m personally scared to use my 3 bps on spirit. people see the hint that they are playing against one and they just dc. the thing is if i’m using a bps or a cake i wait and see if the survivors are going to gen rush, if they aren’t i will extend the game slightly so at least the game would be worth it
---
Wow that’s awesome
---
I stopped watching Tru3 when I realized he constantly makes excuses regardless of who he's playing.
---
Next killer is Pennywise confirmed.  
---
Active Ability: *You'll Float Too*

One could only dream

based and scoopspilled
---
I would definitely trust a spinning clown as weird as that is lol have fun! 😂👋
---
Yeah I agree. I have all his outfits and every perk (bar the new ones) on him. His hair glitches sometimes and whenever I get hooked I swear the yelling is louder than it used to be.
---
but looping is an absurd mechanic to begin with. it's literally a Looney Tunes gag. and it wouldnt be impossible for survivors at all, they would simply have to use better timing at corner pallets. further, half the loops are see-through, giving killers no way to counter those by mindgaming.
---
Guy in the back is the PC playerbase.
---
Nurse is a
---
 Fucking joke dude
---
How do you know they're toxic before equipping the mori hmmmmm?
---
Did the event just start?
---
Peanits is not a dev tho, he is a CM if I am not mistaken.
---
The Hair gives him EW 4
---
Hmm. I just made 2 Feng mins very happy as doctor when they used BPS and I farmed very nicely with them and refused to sacrifice even when one offered themselves. So, your logic is fallible
---
Oh, well good to know it was mostly a meme.then
---
Lol!  Come on man.  You don't believe this it's you trying to salvage the troll.  She has no way to instantly stop anything like Trapper lol!  That shit is gold man.  Remember that line for your next Nurse is bad attempt  because that one is legit funny af.
---
U got some of that money for me bud?
---
That's awful, if I hit a gen it's for completely good intentions, like somebody has to be having a bad day to want to act like that
---
Shoutout to the toe sticking through the drape
---
nea is deadass baby, change my mind
---
&gt; It's universally stacked against survivors
---
What do you mean by that?
---
And yeah, 8-15 minutes is what a typical survivor loss looks like. Most of your games are like that because most survivors aren't good. I'm not saying you're not, but if you have 4 good ones you should be hitting 3 gens in 2 minutes most games unless you get screwed with spawns.
---
I actually recommend ignoring totems and leaving the first guy on hook the whole stage if it means you can get those first 3 gens done. It's a huge advantage for survivors.
---
It's not a fucking troll, dude. I feel bad if you run into so many trolls that you keep accusing me, but it's gone far enough.
---
There's no way to do this currently, and I don't have a source, but I believe they mentioned that it's not on the roadmap for any time soon during a recent live stream.
---
 yeah I get that now that's why I keep my sweaty perks on me now
---
That’s hilarious 😂
---
Jake for Iron Will because Bill sounds like a dying moose when he's injured
---
He probaly won't read this. Shit happens. Just move on
---
This would be more accurate if it was a group of Red ranks when you're a rank 20 killer.
---
Idc that he won't read it but im still basement camping that guy if i ever find him again.
---
You have to be this is like saying water isn't wet.  Nurse is the best killer in the game and it is a uniform consensus.  If you're not trolling than you literally have no understanding of the game.  Again did you just get it?  You sound brand new.  A practiced nurse player will demolish survivors in their games through rank 1.  She bypasses all survivor defenses and turns the chase mechanic upside down.  She can blink through all your walls, windows and pallets.  Once a nurse player has learned how to control blinks she becomes ez mode for killer.  Again what rank are you?  If this is legit you need a lot of help learning the game still.  Watch YouTube vids.
---
F
---
On the flip side I've had 2 killers hit gens and shake their head to imply farming and then get all their kills doing that, lmao.
---
If you want to farm me, you're going to have to chase me now.
---
And that's the great thing about it. Whether I'm playing survivor or killer, a good match can get a nice adrenaline rush out of me. I think the only other game I've experienced that even comes close is Skyrim with the deadly dragons mod installed.
---
1. Myers with monitor and abuse is fun
---
2. Trapper always gets people panicking when they step on one
---
3. Pig can be entertaining and the reverse bear traps add to the game
---
4. Insidious Bubba if you want to throw a random troll game in there
---
Great, you have to specifically learn how to counter 1 killer out of the 14 or 15 in the game 😴.  Oh playing stealthy?  Good thing i don’t run urban evasion distortion and iron will every game.    UNFUN for survivors, every.  Single.  Game.
---
Top left: death

Bottom left: famine

---
The effort to main Nurse is different for every person, if someone REALLY wants to main nurse, they can get it done in about 2 - 3 weeks of gameplay, not that much effort to get such a high reward as to get 4Ks in every single match you play. And, the looping mechanic is different for every killer, all the effort that you put into learning how to loop goes to waste if the killer is a Spirit or a Nurse, nerfing her won't do any damage to good nurse players, what the devs need to do, is remove the high reward of a low risk killer, Low blink cooldown and bigger lunges are both of the things that help you if you aren't precise with the blink, if you get bodied by a good nurse, that is understandable, but if you die because she didn't risk anything going after you, that makes the whole game really unfair and unfun to play, which is the point of the thread in the first place
---
These wait times makes it feel like no one is playing...
---
Generally speaking the higher the rank the more often I see others using BPS.
---
I do tend to go easier on survivors who play 100% offerings.  I only really go try hard if they’re all using tool boxes.  Good time to bring an Ebony.
---
well I don’t think it’s that considering noed effects all survivor and rancor is only the obsession.
---
the best gaming experience
---
and the circle continues
---
yes but why
---
Do you play against Michael the same way you play against Hag?
---
What about piggy and Billy?
---
Do you run from Doc the same way you do Huntress?
---
Of course you don't. Every killer is different and takes different skills to counter.
---
If you're not having fun playing the game the way it's meant to be played, perhaps you should play something else?
---
these posts are best kept in drafts
---
At least you've stopped calling me a troll.  Nurse can only go in straight lines, and doing unpredictable moves such as cutting line of sight and backtracking can allio anyone to survive. Alongside distraction plays and a good bit if teamwork, you can get out of a match with your life and only moderate work.
---
Shouldn't it say pig buffs? As in that's too hard for them to do since they only ever nerf her.
---
I think you’re taking the joke here a bit too far, both sides complain plenty, not just killers.
---
This is SO CUTE! Happy Halloween!
---
I think the skin tone looks perfect. I’m not Iraqi, but my family is from two countries over, and this skin tone is about right for the average modern day Iraqi. I don’t think they’d have been much darker back when they were Babylonians.
---
The susie main can ingest 10 lasagnas worth of Susie's from the dead by daylight series weapon
---
Because every time I use a BPS I either get some camping dbag with a mori, or a gen jockey hit squad with maxed out toolboxes. Sod’s law.
---
Nah, i use WOO as well for looping.
---
Morltha, please wait until class ends to pack up your books!
---
5 blinks isn't even that strong.  
---
I don't think I ever saw someone run it, and when I tried I got stressed out for spending 90% of the match looking at the ground.
---
While they're at it they should turn off Bubba's chainsaw in the menus. So annoying if you're trying to watch a video or somerhing while you queue and you just hear this low, constant rumbling
---
they gotta keep their precious red rank that matters so much /s
---
What you don't seem to realize is if you use your power in the beginning to get to gens then you have to walk at regular speed once you actually see them. They have plenty of time to react to the vacuum sound.
---
All i can imagine is the mayor from cloudy with a chance of meatballs whispering “ it’s your choice...

Finally someone who isn't wanting to play farming simulator during the blood hunt
---
You are allowed to do whatever you want within the game, but that doesn´t make you any less of a POS when you leave multiple survivors bleed out on the ground until they die instead of playing normally and hooking them. Or do similar tactics from the survivor side. 
---
No, I wouldn´t do "whatever" methods I can to secure a win, I care about having a fun game and I won´t camp a survivor or slug the entire team, because I know it´s not fun for them. So no, not everyone is like you.
---
If you run into face campers often id suggest using borrowed time. A way that seems to work for me when im playing SWF is to just swarm the hook and try to bait the killer into swinging and then have someone else get the unhook (using borrowed time).
---
Make us work for it, you get the pre-entity skin by getting the Adept achievement.
---
Yeah, and all that does is annoy you at worst.
---
ToE
---
yeah this. it's so fucking infuriating to unhook someone and they self care for .83091278540912 seconds so now you don't get it. Or someone comes to help you heal so now you don't get it. Or someone gets slugged and they recover so you don't get it.
---
Especially since you can only get 2 uses of it per a game max.
---
Tip if it helps though, if you run we'll make it, it will still count even tho using a medkit doesn't for some reason
---
Doc, Huntress, Billy, Piggy, etc are *variations* of the same formula.
---
Nurse is an entirely different formula
---
This has happened to my friends and I in about 90% of the games we have played over the past few days. PS4 as well. It really sucks losing items and the 5000 points.
---
As the victim? Nothing, really, you cannot do shit. Just live with the knowledge that he is a dumbass who lost thousands of points for the game because of 1 kill.
---
As the rescuer? Don´t rescue and go do gens. If you see that somebody is camping, the biggest punishment ever is just going to do gens and progress the game.
---
Yoko as killer?
---
As the victim, bring perks that will either help you avoid getting downed in chase (usually exhaustion perks) and d-strike/unbreakable are good if he tunnels you. Steve’s perk Camaraderie might help too. 
---
As the rescuer, Borrowed Time is a must. After that, maybe Steve’s perk Babysitter to get the attention on you. 
---
Also just work on looping the killer so you can waste more time and help your team get gens done quicker.
---
I’d just keep struggling on hook so the killer has a longer chance of finding you
---
Michael.exe
---
Thats awesome, keep it up!
---
Was he on death hook
---
Gens taking longer makes facecamping a viable strat.

As for being the victim, just hope someone takes a hit for you. Also the killer may try and get one of your saviors that took the bait hit to begin with, really all depends on the killers playstyle. Hope this helps.
---
Thank you very much :)
---
NAT is specifically an issue if you have multiple routers not setup to interact properly. I get a similar error occasionally and is an issue with my network typically.
---
Do some network troubleshooting (reset router and modem) and see if the issue persists.
---
The hooked survivor could have DS but if u go for the hooked he is downed
---
OK thanks
---
Iirc she was a child when kidnapped, she's just been wandering the fog for that long
---
ah yes, it is time
---
MGS4 amirite haha
---
That poor cat :c
---
i wish if she looks like this in normal, and she turns into vommy mommy version when she obtains the red puke ... but she is too beautiful to be in dbd
---
Demogorgan, his portals are a bit wank, but the lunge is fun to use
---
There's no hypocrisy in fighting fire with fire. 
---
Than* btw
---
It would be way too strong on doctor if you couldn't cleanse it, especially 3 gen impossible skill check doc
---
Wow, I would DC and deny their BBQ stack if they did that, that's scummy
---
PC, I haven't played in a couple weeks, but on PC killer queues are usually longer during bp or events it usually because its easier and more profitable.
---
To be fair, Jason is just a rip off of Michael Myers.
---
injured survivor without iron will = fucked in this dbd mobile. cannot hide at all because notification arrow ( grunt of pain ) on screen and aim assist just make killer camera towards the arrow.
---
Multiple universes were mentioned in S1. &gt;!The Upside Down is basically another dimension/universe and they were able to travel between their world and there.!&lt;
---
No reason they can't cross over to a dimension where Michael is real.
---
Fuck shit up
---
This vine is a classic, good taste.
---
You hit them, let them heal, let them do gens and kick then gen every once in awhile, you bring them to pallets and let them stun you, then you smash the pallets and get points from that.
---
Once they're trusting of you, you can hook them (not kill them) and they'll know you just want your BBQ stacks. Don't do this right away though you may scare them.
---
Generally I'll look at them, at the hook, back at them, then smack the hook. Then they'll nod yes or point at the hook or something. Just so they know I'm going to hook them
---
Can't find me if you can't see me 😂
---
See, but here you're assuming I do any of that stuff.
---
Slugging everyone and letting them bleed out is boring gameplay and IS a POS method. Not to mention it robs you of BP and doesn't always work that well anyway. Same with camping.
---
If you 4k a match and only have 10,000 bloodpoints to show for it, are you really winning?
---
Could you imagine a legion running around while you're exposed, or non addon hatchets being able to down you? Sure charge attack's are a little different but the functionality is the same... being able to come from that far back [sometimes even from a stealth position] and insa-downing a full health survivor is not good gameplay imo
---
I don't mind giving them the BBQ stack and that's what I thought she wanted but after she tunneled me off hook both times and bmed me in the afterlobby. It was clear she was just an idiot.
---
I ran her for 3 gens, so I guess she had no faith in her ability to catch me.
---
2 people DC's, I'm gonna guess this was warranted toxicity.
---
You just stay away from the basement I guess?
---
Got it
---
Good thing I main Frank then.
---
Also, to Susie mains out there, don't try to do it just because this guy said you can...
---
Just make entity progression speed halt whenever the killer is within like a 10 meter range 10 seconds or so post hooking. It wont hurt someone who is setting traps but if your literally just sitting there then its gunna hurt and at least force you to make distance giving room for a save.
---
This makes my Evil Within tier up
---
You don’t have to farm, but bringing an ebony Mori is pretty scummy during a blood hunt. 
---
It’s also detrimental to the killer because they will probably get less bloodpoints than if they played a full regular game.
---
But Wraith *needs* those to be even slightly viable.
---
I just went against a really sweaty Myers but before that we had a trapper that hooked us all twice and then helped us get points so it was a good time.
---
That sounds like most Double Blood Points events I have been in the last 2+ years. BPS events are no fun, the salt and sweat dials are cracked to max
---
These would be awesome for the next hallowed blight
---
I don’t know why people don’t play her really. She’s pretty decent, especially when you get a group of survivors who cleanse all the damn time.
---
I’m a survivor main and I’ve stumbled across many people who just cleanse all the time, even if it hasn’t gotten to the point where they’re injured and can’t heal.
---
Also have seen a plague wreck face because one survivor cleansed and she was able to down three out of four members of the team with her corrupt bile (Was hella pissed lol).
---
This is what happens when you cleanse and have three people on a gen.
---
Dammit! I've never got this daily, and I main Myers!!!!! Sad day!
---
Damn just wanted to post the same thing lol
---
i slugged someone after i accidentally hit him off of hook. i felt bad. i put a bps
---
But they could still hear the hatch and close it
---
i wasn't bashing anyone.  I'm saying, i've seen plenty of games where otz has multiple survivors escape.  He plays at a higher rank, though.  I've almost never seen anyone escape in a fungoose game, but he plays at lower ranks because in Australia, the rank 1ish queue times are too long for him to stream without just sitting in queue for the majority of time.
---
Yeah then I dc as soon as I see it I done it earlier someone brought a gateu cake and the bill decided to seek me out and give it the old click click so I immediately dc then apologise to the person that brought the cake and explained that I am not going to play this match with clock clicks so therefore everybody suffers because of one person
---
But again, there will always be people who are salty about some perk combination. It feels shitty to lose to some stuff, both from the killer and the perspective side. This game, due to the asymmetrical nature, and the theme, is even more prone this. And again, there will be people who will hate you for playing something they hate. But again, if you are playing normally and not slugging or camping or whatever, why bother caring about them? 
---
Understand that while it´s not your intention to ruin people´s day, you still might ruin their day. I have a couple of bad games, mood drops, and yeah, then even a doc with couple meta perks would be the final nail in the coffin to ruin my day. But why does that bother you?
---
I always bring I key if I'm playing with randoms my lovely ;)
---
And never forget the times where you could break gens, and when sabotaged hooks we're broken forever
---
Her toe is peeking
---
I hate that I knew it was coming yet I still jumped
---
Yeah, I'd rather not. I bought the Switch version so I can play on my Switch. If I want to play on my PC, PS4, or Xbox then I'll just use them, lol.
---
Killer: *goes anything but nurse and spirit*
---
Survivors: *5 gens, 4 man escape and all of them teabag at the exit gate* lmao play a better killer lmaooo gg ez
---
Killer: *gives in a mains spirit and nurse*
---
Survivors: nErF sPiRiT wHy dO i OnLy SeE nuRsE anD sPiRiT iN mY mAtCheS? sToP pLaYiNg sPiRiT aNd nUrSe, yOU cAnT wIn wiThout cRuTch KiLlErS
---
If I remember correctly, Pig's Dash and Demo's Shred don't activate STBFL but FF does and works with everything except exposed. 
---
However, if you have NoeD and hit someone in FF, it tells the person that you hit that they are exposed but because it's FF they don't go down xD
---
The consistency is shoddy to say the least.
---
Haddonfield, Yamaoka, Asylum.
---
fuck me I hate that goddamn map
---
That's what the animation should look like when you use Pop Goes the Weasel
---
I prefer Ghostface. He's been a lot of fun to use. Kinda like a Myers/Pig hybrid.
---
i feel that
---
Great job!!!!!!!
---
All we need is a lawn mower based killer and its a direct counter to claudette
---
Certain people will use anything to attack others. In your examples, it's them finally having it easy, so instead of being grateful and returning the favor, they attack you to feel better because they probably get shit on most of the time by killers not interested in catering to them. It's like how many will tbag at the exit line and run out without giving you a hit. They rarely ever survive, so they finally get to feel like they've won and want to gloat.
---
You're forgetting a VERY important factor: With Surge, you save time.
---
You down somebody, 0-a_few gens blow up. You now do not have to walk to the gens, don't have spend time in the kicking animation, do not (possibly) have to walk the distance from the gen to the hook if your next PoI is on the other side.
---
I will gladly take getting a free kick on two distant gens, over getting one 'strong' kick that has me use 15 seconds on doing so.
---
Of course this is entirely up to playstyle, which differs from player to player and killer on killer, but it works perfectly well for my playstyle of controlling which gens the survivors get to work on, opposed to Pop Goes the Weasel, where I constantly got frustrated by having to rush over to a gen to kick it before the timer expired. (Admittedly, I haven't used the perk since that timer was buffed.)
---
But hey, whatever lets you kill the most people, roll with that :D
---
(And I yet have to see players actually going out of their way to counter Surge. Albeit it's fair to assume that will come at some point, **if** the perk sees enough use.)
---
It's almost 5am and i should be sleeping but instead im laughing at this comment
---
I'll agree with you that most killers obey the laws of pallets, I still argue they treat them vastly differently. That still doesn't affect how you counter them though, since different killers interact with pallets and windows in their own unique ways.
---
Each killer has their own counter. Nurse is no exception, even if it requires a different strategy.
---
Play stealthy. If you have to get in a chase, hug walls, juke, play unpredictably, and don't stop running until you break LOS.
---
Understandable.
---
Personally i hate Legion the most, but Ghostface just bothers me. I cant have any fun as or vs him.
---
Same i wanna die
---
Expected nothing less.
---
Yamaoka, Lery's and the new map.
---
I really like the new variations of school.
---
&gt;My cpu is a bottleneck.
---
What do you have? If you have those other specs surely it's not an Intel Atom, right?
---
Dota doesn't seem to use more than like 3-4 cores, so I don't know how you'd have issues.
---
The 2700 is 8c16t, which is nice to have, but Dota should run on as low as 4c4t.
---
Main reason I hear is not enough pressure especially at low ranks since people rarely cleanse she’s just a basic attack killer at that point plus by time you’ve actually broke someone either your ruin is gone or a gen finished especially if there good at looping
---
Run Deliverance, Decisive, Head On, Dead Hard, (and possibly a firecracker for good measure)
---
Wait for your team to approach to try and save to distract the killer. Kobe your ass off the hook with Deliverance. Hop in the nearest locker. Any killer dumb enough to facecamp is dumb enough to grab you out of the locker and get hit with Decisive. Get back in the locker, doublestun that bitch with Head On. Blind with a firecracker if you have one and fucking RUN cause if he wasn't pissed before he sure as hell is now.
---
One time I ran this build, after I hit the doublestun another survivor with Head On realized what was going on and hopped in the locker right after I got out and hit him with the triple stun. Instant DC lol.
---
I've noticed this on XB too. It's super annoying!
---
Sheltered Woods, Preschool, Lerys
---
Something something crying survivor main something something salt
---
God
---
Well than what if the killer just pulls the plug (dc)
---
Well otz also plays some pretty crazy meme builds too lol and on non meta killers at that. If otz is really going hard for a 4k he will get it 9 times out of 10
---
Damn! Right next to a gen too. That really sucks, man!
---
THANK YOU :)
---
👁️👄👁️
---
I play as her on Xbox. She just isn't that great at better ranks.
---
I wish killers/other survivors weren't ending the matches in less than 5 minutes during the event. I ran into the sweatiest Billy who downed everyone (granted, my teammates were kinda dumb) while I finished a grand total of 1 gen.
---
This seems to be happening on all platforms... It's annoying as fuck... Had it happen to me multiple times yesterday while playing both Survivor and killer. Mid match the killer would randomly DC while carrying someone, or a survivor would DC while at the gate.
---
Traper best boy
---
Me: I feel like I am gonna get a 4k 
---
This Bulid: I'm bout to end this man's whole career
---
The single note of the Halloween theme is my favourite part
---
May we boop the snoot?
---
It's not like it's going to get much better either. I think they really pushed it too far going for 1080p docked.
---
If you know how to play the game you should know exactly what I meant.
---
Good choice. :)
---
Oh I didn't say we survived. I was nailing my skill checks but ended up taking hit or saving my team since they kept blowing up everything. We did die
---
Haddonfield, Yamaoka and Haddonfield
---
You can get the perks from DLC killers through the Shrine with in game currency, two Killer and two Survivor perks appear in there each week and can be bought with the Shard currency you get by leveling up. It's only 2 perks per side each week so you're not going to get them all right away, but the option is there and with time you could grab a lot of good perks from it.
---
None without new maps replacing.
---
Any solo player can remember totems spot just as well as people playing with their friends, you mad because your NOED won’t spawn?
---
^^^^
---
This.
---
I don't mind if people don't want to farm with me, but at least give people a chance to earn bloodpoints rather than bringing in an insta down and a mori every round. I would understand of the killer got more points for it, but since they don't, it surprises me every time.
---
I'm not even getting the extra BP for playing him I just do it because I like getting bullied by SWFs
---
Yeah I know all of this but I'm talking about Claudette herself ? Keep in mind that I play the game ocasionally and none of my survivors have any prestige. From what I'm seeing, the  ability to heal herself without any object seems really powerfull, I don't know the english name of that Perk but I suppose you know which one I'm talking about right ?
---
Nevermind, I searched in on the Wiki, it's Self-care.
---
Instead of regressing the progress of the generator, the killer just fucking yeets it out of the map
---
Ok so if mindgames are enough, why do we need to slow down gen progression?
---
By endless, I didn't mean literally endless.... just a very long time.
---
Yamoka, ormond, and gideons
---
Pig is too RNG with her RBT’s and the dash/crouch’s gimmick is only really good for first hits.
---
Hillbilly can be looped like most other killers if the survivors are even half decent.
---
Bubba is good at destroying pallets and that’s it. The distance the chainsaw has to make in order to down you gives plenty of time to get reach a vault or pallet.
---
Legion’s power doesn’t assist in the chase other than getting an easy first hit. Recovery from frenzy gives survivors plenty of time to reach a tile or loop which turns him into a shitty M1 killer. Deep wound is nothing more than a mild inconvenience for the survivors.
---
I already explained Huntress and Nurse
---
New survivor, Sauron.
---
Yeah I noticed that, from the few games I played, the others perks were really situationnal while Self-Care is usefull pretty much whenever the hell you want so I'm already using it.
---
I always find that after 11pm est seems to get me lots of matches as a killer.
---
Sprint Burst, Inner Strength, Fixated, and Quick n Quiet is such a fun build. You can walk around kind unhindered with fixated and the sprint burst when you are about to be chased to get away.
---
Eh,maybe with an ultra rare addon like Myers.
---
People give you reasons, but sheeps too blind to understand them so, bye
---
There is a football fields worth of middle ground between farming and crutching out ebony games to deny bloodpoints.
---
When killer queues are upwards of 10 minutes, it's better to just play survivor matches
---
I’ve seen it occasionally but no one ever really expands on it. I saw one person who did like 6 survivors-killer concepts but didn’t expand it further.
---
this is why, DS, insta-heal, borrow time, exist
---
Swamp, Gideon and lab
---
There just isn’t any hype around her tbh. She’s a good killer but she gets overshadowed by better killers. Her perks are okay but nothing meta which further decreases the reason for new players getting her. I main Plague and I feel the same way how much other people feel. Lower rank killers have more play time than her (Pig, Bubba, Doc). Plague just doesn’t have any hype, despite her being the most unique killer in the game imo.
---
Here comes the trapper 🎶  you better watch out for his traps 🎶
---
Here comes the trapper 🎶 you better eat some ginger snaps 🎶
---
Isn't freddys dress addons kinda the same thing
---
Yea with my luck, I’m the only one who burns a streamer
---
Rotten Fields can go die in a fucking compost bin right alongside Badham and Haddonfield
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
That's not efficient. The way I do it is way better. No waiting. And you don't even know when your vacuum starts every time. You don't even know where the survivors are so they can easily hear it.
---
He's not gonna be, it was the Devs messing with people who are constantly watching their twitters trying to figure out what Killers/Survivors they'll be releasing next.
---
Lmao have you ever played swf? It’s more about having fun then winning, plus what is you complaining gonna do? You think the devs will just remove swf because of totems it’s not that big of a deal NOED is a stupid perk that only trash players need
---
Hey lady, nice cans!
---
Run Decisive every game and learn how to loop well.  Do this and all you need is a farm to punish the absolute shit out of those babykillers.  Make the act of camping and tunneling you fun as pulling teeth.
---
Get ds from shrine. I suggest leveling someone else even though claud is level 6, it's not that far.
---
Imo bill has the best teachables but if don't feel confident playing survivor I'd say go for mighty dweet. Bond is an amazing healing perk and prove thyself is really good.
---
Of course!
---
Oooink
---
If you're going for no reachable perks then Self-care would be the strongest perk Claudette has.  Empathy may be alright for tracking injured team mates. But you only need rank 40 on each survivor to get their teachables. Hope will help you open exit gates faster, we'll make it will help you save and heal others without borrowed time, and the other perks are a bit of a wash. Use the wiki and find "All" to see non specific teachables
---
You fine man its a bunch of salty survivors don’t mind them lol. And before anyone asks i am a survivor and killer main lol. And i just wanna say that hey man farming is farming. Everyone got a good amount of BPs you dont have to escape lol
---
Douche move dude.
---
Why can't we just play as _this_ instead
---
Bullshit.  They dont have the licensing.
---
So basically you get mad when people use things they are meant to? Nice.
---
are you crying now? i have shoulder for you boii
---
People will still be able to play SWF if we remove totems, which is what we're talking about, you embarrassing fool.
---
Well there’s always 5 totems per match. If you mean lit totems, it’s still 5. Just run 4 hex perks with one of them being haunted grounds. Haunted grounds is the only one that lights 2 totems.
---
You just give us killers a bad name. Seriously, if you can't take the heat, you shouldn't be at the rank you are. Just let them leave and depip that way, specifically if someone offered bp offerings.
---
That's such a scummy thing to do, dc because you don't like being clicked at. Being a distraction for your team is a tactic, and as a killer, the best way to make sure you don't get stomped by those who are playing that way is to either ignore them or be capable of downing them quickly with the killer you're playing.
---
Funny enough: By the time I wrote this she was still level 6 but I then finished a game which leveled her uo to level 10, I saw what was available in the shrine and already took DS.
---
I'll see what I can do for Bill tho.
---
For the love of the Trapper, please mark this comment as NSFW or something mate
---
Killers need a cosmetic slot for totems....  I'd pay 3-5 dollars for these in the store, no problem.
---
You moron, are you saying you want survive with friends removed?
---
You missed the point
---
If I care enough I look at name history
---
Already got We'll make it, lucky me,
---
And Hope as well, she's just top low to equip 4 for now.
---
Nice
---
I doubt they'll do a mimic killer, but it might be interesting. They'd have to be fairly weak in other areas to compensate.
---
However, if we got a Kate Lloyd survivor, I'd definitely have a new main.
---
Yupppp
---
You're the one coming on here complaining more than anything. Also complaining about decisive? Lol
---
That's when lag comes into play
---
He called me a cunt lmao
---
We don't all use any methods possible.  Some of us enjoy outplaying our opponents.  For instance I wouldn't be caught dead with NOED on any one of my loadouts just like pre rework I wouldn't run Decisive or MoM on my survivors.
---
Doubles bloodpoints event will help you level whoever you want so don't worry.
---
So you’re just salt because you aren’t as good as some survivors? Wow.
---
Nobody cares
---
First and only match of the day before I had to leave for work, had 5 bps. Lol
---
What is the build, may I ask?
---
 Really? that's so cool!
---
Alright.
---
Not mad, i simply dc because i don't wanna use Nurse
---
Lullaby sucks. The only one it would really help is doctor. When you get to the point of silent checks, it might as well break anyway
---
Yeah I meant hex totems stupid me lol Someone had 3 hex or totems that lit up i didn't know if that was possible
---
She’s a great killer but against survivors who don’t cleanse she basically doesn’t have a power. You’re just an M1 Killer with instadowns. While effective, it’s pretty boring to play as
---
It's not so bad on Xbox, the messages aren't as frequent. I think it can be as bad on PC, but that's because they have lobby chat abs that's easy to say what you want and then be done.
---
New update
---
Joke’s ~~on you~~ on his teammates it was Haunted Grounds
---
What about solo survivor queue?
---
A distraction for your aye right thats what they are doing it for
---
I looped a Demogorgon today for 3 gens. Got tunneled and camped. Still got 20k.
---
Its scary when you find a good Clown...
---
Shout out to the P3 Clown yesterday on Xbox who never hit anywhere but the middle of your back
---
I just play as normal.
---
Had a clown slugging everyone earlier, they all quit except me - He was really confused for some reason...
---
probably new update, likely the low ranks and grouped with the red ranks
---
I feel for ya but you got a solid 3 days afterwards to go balls deep my friend. Worry not.
---
Well yes he is older but Marble Hornets is what popularized him, as well as what brought together the whole game and notes dynamic.
---
Myers is evil in purest form and bubba’s a demented cannibal
---
I'd rather ruin make gens longer and remove the red skillchecks alongside the good = stop progress for a bit
---
Must be rough for them 😬😬
---
We all have an experience like this.  Me and my friends were playing a pre work Legion and we were destroying him.  He got his first hook as we popped the 4th gen.  He then made it very clear that he wasn't playing anymore and wanted to farm with us.  We felt bad because dude really was getting his teeth kicked in and felt we'd hook him up with some points.  He slugged us all then proceeded to hook everyone.  1 got out with a Kobe.  Postgame he said yeah I wanted to farm but then I changed my mind.....dude none of us wanted to farm you were getting destroyed so hard we felt bad and figured we'd donate points your way.  Imagine being so trash at this game you have to trick people into farming.  Haven't done it since.  Any killer that attempts in game I just gen rush and leave.
---
Any killer with BBQ is great for this event. 
---
Personally, I rather play Nurse and have total control over the game's pace. Even if I end the match in less than 10 minutes, I still get 20k+ bloodpoints. If the match drags out for a little, easily 25k+.
---
The gain per hour is higher/faster with a killer that you can finish matches whenever you want.
---
Haddonfield and Balance landing.
---
I will have a busy grind, but since demo is already p2 level 50 it should be fine, and everyone else is p3 level 50 so I got 4 perks to choose from, more chance for bbq.
---
And id say it is quite a bit different. I play on Xbox, so I'm basing things I say on that. Pc frame rate is a smooth 60 fps compared to Xbox, which can some times feel close to 60, but won't be consistently smooth (they're still working on it obviously). Something to say though is that pc survivors at high ranks feel harder than Xbox survivors did at high ranks, and you go against nurses and huntress more consistently as a survivor overall on pc than you do on console, Also slightly lower amount of hillbillies on pc compared to console.
---
I bought a pc for dbd quite a bit ago, it was definitely an improved killer experience in terms of frame rate at the time, but with the updates they do to make console run more smoothly, I'm not sure if it'll be worth the purchase soon. Also hillbilly steering feels bad for me on mouse and keyboard so if you play hillbilly on console id suggest a gamepad for him.
---
Haddonfield, Yamaoka and Ormond.
---
Trapper: I let my father die and collapsed a mine on all his workers.
---
Myers: Literally evil incarnate.
---
Legion: wE sHaNKeD a jAniTOr
---
Oh I’m farming, but will make it seem like your gonna die, and I’m definitely gonna drag the game out for extra points. I don’t understand why other killers will go all ham and end the match in 2mins, drag that shit out and get some points!! 
---
I read where others have stated that they wanna play like normal and get the match over which is fine, but during a DBP event drag that shit out some because come Monday it’s back to normal business. I think some people are just wanting to be straight dickheads and want to ruin the game for others and this when people will be dumping bps or cakes, we wanna get the most out of them and not have them wasted because a shithead teammate DC and then the killer decides to be a asshole! 
---
When I’m playing killer, your all my bitches and I’m dragging that shit out and will make you think your gonna die, but some times they do die and sometimes they escape but I make sure my survivors are having fun.
---
She’s from ancient Babylon, not the Egypt you are talking about .... different regions but very close
---
Cute!
---
If you play with all those things, expect a dc, that's all i'm saying. You well know this game isn't balanced AT ALL and if you don't, well, you obviously don't play killer enough
---
Walking around at Spirit’s base movement speed is the waiting. You‘re supposed to not use your entire power in order to minimize downtime, and you don’t need an optimal gen grab scenario at the start of every single game. The idea is to use half of your power immediately after spawning in; walk while it recharges, and repeat, it is much more efficient than never phasing until you’ve hit someone.
---
That is. Some like annoying killers, but when they lead you around, they're distracting the killer which is a valuable thing to do for a team, especially if your survivor teammates aren't the best at looping. But okay, you'll be a worse killer overall if you can't handle a little click, just try not to ruin everyone else's experience in your rage state.
---
As a main killer on PS4, I got 40 cakes and 40 BPS, I'm totally farming these 4 days.
---
As someone who used to main survivor, it's literally so fucking boring already to do gens. People will just give up playing survivor I feel.
---
You got it all twisted dude; these are all just pictures of the First Horseman; Conquest.
---
While [Conquest](https://imgur.com/a/h6FIEp1) is a cool guy, [Famine](https://imgur.com/a/1TUkjm5) and [War](https://imgur.com/a/04dnBv3) deserve a little recognition too.
---
What were you asking?
---
Nurse, I main spirit so I can run even the best of ones for multiple generators. Nurse it depends on the map, positioning, and overall skill of the player.
---
Thank you mate. I'm playing on a PS4 and the frame rate as killer are shocking. I want to switch to PC gaming anyway as I've been looking into it for a long time. But dead by daylight is a main game I play.
---
I've been playing more survivor recently as the frames are that bad so I'm hoping on PC I will have a lot more fun.
---
I've found a computer but I am really bad with technology haha.
---
How did he get all those bloodpoints?
---
I have a video of me using traps as myers in KYF way back when there was a super rare glitch
---
Uh oh they all use flashlights
---
Yeah
---
whats the deal with shelter woods? i almost never get it, almost as rare as cowshed
---
Ahh I thought you meant the entire thing where he just dies lol. Yeah I got the timing about right to give them about 45 seconds of room but if you do that they usually suicide. The standard wait time is about 15 seconds before they suicide and go to next match.
---
Ah, my bad.
---
How old do you think Rin is?
---
Corrupt Intervention sounds good on paper but doesn’t translate well in practice. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a bad perk but it’s not something worth buying a DLC for either. Infectious Fright is her best perk but it’s only good on certain killers or if you’re running a slug build. She’s a OK killer with OK perks. Nothing to rush for.
---
I had that happen to me one time last night. I escaped and it took my toolbox, gave me zero for survival, but still showed I got two pips. When I hovered over my rank, I could see that it didn’t give me the pips. On restart I got my pips but my green toolbox was gone
---
Free hits and sabotaging gens. How can swf kill that
---
i coverd it with extra piece of cloth :P
---
Yes I opened my phone and boom new dlc
---
Killer had noed, Survivors knew but still tried to save me cause I looped the killer for 4 Gens, I saw them slowly crouching closer to me but I suicided on hook so no one else had to go with me
---
He's like Hitler, but even Hitler cared about Germany or something
---
Fast af boii
---
Awesome dude. That's a decisive strike if I've ever seen one.
---
Will try this. Thanks
---
Ive seen this before a few times and went thru it and reported it to the devs, but reporting is worthless in this game. 
---
It’s very obvious when they are teaming, I start rolling on the recording and submit it all but I know I’m just pissing in the wind because nothing will be done about it.
---
If you get a decent pc, it'll definitely be worth the switch if your experience feels impacted by low frames on ps4. You'll just have to worry about earning everything back, which could be a hassle.
---
Double blood point event
---
This just happened to me too! Was healing at exit gate. I thought maybe lagswitch.
---
It's not about the balance landing, the map itself sucks, It's a fucking pain in the ass.I take anything on this game, 1 min game and totem broke? Ok, I'm bugged? Ok, toxic survivors? Ok.But Haddonfield? "Fuck This shit, I'm out".
---
gave a killer $10 psn for farming after going against the top 30 sweatiest killers back to back. it's just a nice change of pace that benefits everyone.
---
I usually don't have a problem hitting greats though, and those are smaller than DS i think
---
Isn’t the legion and the huntress the most “Human”
---
Thanks. Havent played the game for a while.
---
All of the cold wind maps or haddonfield. Can't stand them while I'm playing the killer.
---
On PC, it’s easy to talk shit in the post-game chat. But aside from that, it’s not too bad. The occasional profile comment or steam message, nothing major though. It’s easy to delete/block people anyways. 
---
Some people have constant -rep comments on their steam page, but they usually deserve it, running lots of toxic stuff.
---
Expect a dc if you all of those things
---
It took away a purple flashlight, even though I put on black ward because it was my only decent flashlight. So I shouldn’t have lost it either way. And it took away a commodious. It’s getting pretty frustrating
---
I think she's a college freshman? Not sure
---
The game is unfair, deal with it once you'll get bored of playing survivor and it will be dead lol
---
Well, I do keep saying "good" survivors...
---
Suiciding is a misplay too, of course. I don't let people's tantrums spoil my future games. They'll never learn how to play if you baby them.
---
I'll never understand reddit voting, you have a totally valid point about the queue times, if you're playing on console then your killer queue times are probably a fraction of pc times because killer is harder on consoles.
---
WAHOO!!
---
I actually like you're idea a lot, seems solid and would be a lot more informative than just "oh it's not dull so I must protect it".
---
The 4th one is my favorite
---
It’s Hawkins lab that lays for me.
---
Imagine being new at the game and trying to argue about balance
---
Played 6 games already and every single one was every survivor burning Surv Cakes when I burned the only BPS and then being toxic and teabagging and flashlighting constantly.
---
Fun!
---
Wow, this is a great guide. Tysm for mentioning bloodhunt etiquette. Most people forget.
---
We barely farmed. It wasn't fair at ALL
---
I want to start a campaign to harrass the Devs until they make this happen
---
Na I think I'll be a toxic cunt when I see a toxic cunt
---
They may work as intended but you can still get bullshit hits from the killer’s perspective.
---
He looks like he acquired an infinity stone
---
Hope I run into you :P
---
Seems fair right seems even enough to me
---
Spirit, of course.
---
Spirit Fury is a very good perk for all killers.
---
Because you are one. You lied just so you could secure a 4K and then taunted me. You are literal human garbage. Scum of the earth
---
He's going mortal kombat on that gen
---
I don't think I've ever been mori'd as scoops. Maybe it's just cause I play with my friends and they're lower ranked?
---
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts
---
And I looked, and behold a pale horse
---
And his name that sat on him was shirtless Michael, and hell followed with him
---
They added Tapp
---
Hop and Tapp are different
---
It's not just rough, it is IMPOSSIBLE MATHEMATICALLY.
---
Console optimisation when? Cant play plague on a big map because the frame rate just gets so low.
---
Tbh I tend to unintentionally 3-gen since I'm stupid and get baited often, so I end up lurking in one general area all match lmao
---
Though in all seriousness, I don't think there's anything wrong with 3-genning - when your back's against the wall, it's best to keep what few cards you've got left close to your chest, right? Killers have to kill, and if that's the most efficient means of doing so you have available to you at any given point I say go for it. We all want that sweet sweet W after all.
---
You only get salt if you camp at all
---
THANK YOU. Can't believe someone is actually defending him here. At least you are sensible enough
---
It’s a grown ass dude! But now I’m seeing him as a kid 😂
---
I run Nurses really good. Bring on 5 blinks
---
Why wont you let me heal you
---
If I wasn't desensitized to this game that would've scared the shit out of me. That's something straight out of a horror movie. Good God.
---
*runs to the corner of the map*
---
This is legit the best idea i've read for a licensed killer
---
🤡
---
Console player.
---
Well, how'd it go?
---
Messing up 3 people even though someone is doing their job is ok?
---
Man Killers are toxic assholes
---
Almost everyone in the lower ranks is in it for the BP to unlock characters. Survivors get much much less BP than killers even if both parties do equally well. It's not a tantrum, it's a business transaction and I don't blame them. Same reason people DC if they are downed too early.
---
I don't playing pig so this is just going off of what I remember, but didn't it work for exposed but not for most other abilities
---
tbf Pig can be pretty op, the devs are doing their best to balance the game
---
at the start of every game my sensitivity feels like max but setting hasnt changed number
---
Can I get the source to that?
---
Amazing guide! 
---
I loved that you added the gestures to show friendlyness, many people just dont know :)
---
Dude, you're gonna have bad games. Get over it and move on instead of ranting on reddit
---
This is so cute, can we nerf her 50 times.
---
Same the point I’m trying to make is that tier lists are stupid as they are opinion based but to make this easier nurse and spirit are the best and then everyone else
---
She’s beautiful, but what the hell is with her eyes LOL
---
Got tunneled by a legion
---
Do you mean worse for killer?
---
Then you don't play at red ranks, i don't believe you at all. I can't believe you have never faced a team that stomped you even if you have played good and mindgamed them HARD, hooked them many times and they still managed to get out because of stupid perks that give them 600 chances to get away while the generators melt below their hands
---
Why not a t-posing, shirtless Myers with a chainsaw doing a flying kick?
---
Spirit, maybe being on console makes a difference but the nurses I go against are pretty crap
---
See I actually am on pc, but last night I had a few matches of near instant queue times
---
#OH NO SHE'S HOT
---
LET THE 3 DAY GRIND BEGIN!!!
---
Yes should clarify. Just a salt post
---
Ouch
---
If only
---
Depipped and went back up to rank 18
---
NAT error unable to connect to server 🤷
---
Yeah i think the survivors late at night are usually going to be larger groups; so later it's easier to find games as a killer vs survivor.
---
Pig, Ghostface: First Time?
---
I've had a few bad spots before. Only 2 were really bad though
---
They can die on their second hook if they want, just gimme that bbq stack bro ;-;
---
I found out last year that EDP lives here in my city. It was weird seeing him just casually walk in front of my car.
---
Nice, man! If u like her, get a full black skin for her, she looks nice and hides her a litle bit more.
---
I would work on fixing the difference between the killers first otherwise you run the risk of making a stalling mechanic that is simply unbeatable on the best killers.
---
Thanks for stopping by but it’s not the fact that people disagree, it’s the fact that most of the people who responded were extremely rude as I said in my original comment which you chose to ignore so you could give your unwanted 2 cents
---
Yep I feel this 😂
---
It all comes down to the killer. Some want to farm, some don't. You can never go into a match and expect the killer to farm with you no matter what, most of us just want to play the game instead of spending 20 minutes being bored and farming.
---
This. I only played a good Nurse a couple times. 
---
A good Spirit is pretty common.
---
At least the killer knows how to share.
---
Yeah, lets keep the game unfair so you can win easy as a survivor cause you don't wanna try anything different. Get over people ranting, move on and play killer, have fun buddy
---
Do you also run No Mither?
---
I'm definitely hella farming and oinking at survivors this weekend , that said I'm always more of a chill killer. I let noobies win chases and like scaring people with oinks but not actually pouncing
---
What was their reasoning?
---
I'll definitely do try that out, I'm currently working on leather face atm to get bbq, I really enjoyed playing as her though!
---
On Xbox you always get messages like “reported” it’s the funniest shit
---
That's not at all true. You get salt for winning. Angry people are angry when they lose.
---
Or stop with your soft feelings and don’t let the actions of others dictate how you feel about a GAME.
---
God if this ain't relatable lmao
---
I'm fairly new (picked up the game during the free week last week) so maybe this'll fade with time, but I've noticed I tend to start actively trembling while waiting in queue as a Killer
---
Like, uncontrollable jittering in my arms and legs, takes a while before it calms down and goes back to normal again
---
I love Huntress but man I got real bullied during that free week and it makes me so hesitant to even bother with playing her sometimes
---
Try to get into a SwF. Mine only plays on weekends, so week days are really rough in this game. I still manage to pip but rarely escape because everyone crouches in corners while I get chased, if I'm the first found its a gg.
---
Usually I wait to see if the killer indicates if he wants to farm (i.e. hitting a gen) instead of trying to make him farm. Otherwise I play the game normally. I know it sucks to not get the most amount of BPs, but unfortunately killers do decide our fate as survivors. :c
---
Play a different game, come back after awhile. Sounds like you are sticking with DBD to much and letting it get to you emotionally
---
Yep I get them quite a bit as well too. Whenever I get a friend request I know some bs is gonna ensue
---
𝓦𝓱𝓸𝓪 𝓫𝓻𝓸 𝓽𝓱𝓪𝓽’𝓼 𝓭𝓮𝓮𝓹
---
Borrowed time as the rescuer, Decisive strike as the victim.
---
Sprint burst can help when u get rescued too, so u can get some time from the killer.
---
Lol, I made it to purple ranks, I have been matched with all reds though, I played almost exclusively killer until recently
---
Or just having the screen blurring instead of terror radius, and also some random spálening siluets to make survivors paranoid
---
As if a survivor calling a killer toxic Wowwwww glass houses eh?
---
Had infinite tier 3 with instant mori once. Got rotten fields... i lost.
---
Why?
---
Looks fuckable
---
Also I literally just said haahhahah like it’s not that deep
---
Plot Twist: Bubonic Plague is in her system already, she just isn't manifesting physical symptoms yet. :(
---
I just hope they'll get bored of playing survivor so they can actually understand the situation
---
There are a lot of new people playing at the moment - I've had my share of games where I'll have someone follow me the whole game, or not be comfortable enough to come unhook me. If you are looking for more stability, then perhaps try LFG.
---
Damm, I would realy like that!
---
What the fuck is that rank 17 survivor main doing here.
---
That last idea would probably be disgusting against Huntress lol
---
She threatens a hatchet during a short-wall loop, survivor crouches out of reflex, stunned for a couple seconds and she closes the gap to M1
---
Nasty
---
I play both, surv and killer and Im like almost always nice killer, more than often I let people espace and have fun but during bloodhunt killer q is really long for me and I'd rather play 2 games as surv instead of waiting for killer match
---
The lower the quality, the harder the wheeze.
---
oh no i most definitely have been completely curb stomped by some survivor teams, but it's never been cause of d-strike.
---
As if this would work with every killer... lol
---
Now that’s a gem
---
Nah, i dunno when or where, but devs said that no-one is underage in dbd.
---
Duuuuude
---
To be fair, she did cut her toe off (Check out her lore, or in-game model) as a sacrifice, so everyone would look there.
---
Ok but can it be the scorpion king instead? I'm talking the OG half scorpion half The Rock CGI monstrosity.
---
Except bubba, he's just a potato
---
I would imagine that he would be called something along the lines of The Faceless
---
I’ve started to realize that lol
---
What was the killers rank?
---
I feel like not as many killers want to farm nowadays, I had a leatherface let us farm the other night because we were all messing around in the one gen room on Hopkins Lab and he chainsawed us all but ended up letting us live, it was nice. I might consider playing as killer and farming a little cus I have BBQ and that's basically a party streamer.
---
and my ax!
---
The huntress fuckin butchered soldiers in the woods and kidnapped children, legion stabbed a guy and acted like an x fan
---
the one man BHVR been listening to, kill it before it grows
---
Not really. I play it maybe a day or two out of the week. It’s honestly been going downhill since the plague. Now they are just rehashing killer abilities and new skins. On top of this broken rank system.
---
9
---
I mean Nea doesn’t smell *that* bad
---
4k.
---
Pipping doesn't matter fo me i think the rank system needs improvement
---
Yamaoka, Lery's, the Game.
---
It's too early to tell what the DBD playerbase will be like on Switch in the coming months. Xbox playerbase is fine for me. I rarely wait for more than a couple minutes, even in off peak times. I'm in NA if that matters.
---
Sorry, quitting because you got hooked first and aren't happy with how fast your teammates run to you is a tantrum. At that point you don't even know if you're going to win yet and just don't like that you got hooked.
---
Even if we want to think about it as a calculated BP-farming decision, you don't know if you're going to get good BP and escape yet. It's just your first hook. For all you know, you could waste a bunch of time waiting for another game and loading just to get an even worse start with a worse team vs a meaner killer.
---
Im a survivor main dipshit.
---
I've been playing with BBQ and survivor pudding (some kind of high multiplier) for most of my games, so sometimes I'll even get 92 k. I'm super excited to see how that'll stack with the bloodhunt.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d9ow5w/was_the_2_killer_glitch_patched_with_the_most/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

The Mummy’s power could involve somehow turning into a sandstorm or something close to it!

That is how percentages work
---
I just escaped and didn't get the x2 bonus, wth?  
---
Is this a bug on PS4?
---
I salute you kind sir, people like you actually encourage more new player to try and play more cause its fun and not just tryhard and bully players that are not that good
---
Reds that were probably trash, since you can get there by just hiding the whole game
---
Well I don't run ruin, the whole point of it is to add time artificially. If they haven't given up already they won't with what I mentioned. Especially with good skillchecks not being a detriment and greats giving you a slight bump like without ruin. It'll still benefit people who can land greats while not screwing everyone who gets goods. Overall the timing would probably be similar to now with greats.
---
I don't get why killers complain about losing hex ruin so quickly. I'd say it typically lasts for at least a minute and I've done games where we got 3 or more gens done before we found the totem.
---
Even if it's found quickly, that probably means that at least one person stopped working on gens specifically to find it.
---
What I noticed is that if they’re in the killers terror radius at all they just nope out
---
Dont forget sprint burst had a 20 second cooldown in the early early stages of the game and no exhaustion
---
She looks amazing! I love your renders. &lt;3
---
Never because of d-strike, lmao yea alright dude
---
The only problem with decisive is that sometimes you accidentally run into the person at the end of their timer, which can still be avoided by remembering how recently they were unhooked.
---
You get salt of you do anything a survivor deems unfair, end of. 
---
Most of the time you get salt for punishing stupid plays or bad tactics. Survivors don't like being shown that they aren't good at the game.
---
Bloodhunt (or double BP) is nothing but a Bloody Party Streamer enabled by default every match. Thats it. It doesn't "double" anything other than your base points.
---
So:
---
Base points = 32k.
---
BBQ = 32k + 32k (base points).
---
Cake = 32k + 32k (base points) + 32k (BBQ)
---
Bloodhunt = 32k + 32k (base points) + 32k (BBQ) + 32k (cake).
---
Total= 4x32k = 128k.
---
I’m guilty of that but when I would use Empathy lmao
---
If you got 32k then it would be a perfect game, so yes. But likely your bbq stacked up with whatever the base was to make it 32k
---
But I have work in the morning :(
---
Ew, pre-Ryzen AMD. Yeah no wonder. AMD really struggled ever since Intel took them over like 15 years ago. Even the 8c CPUs, piledrivers/etc. are complete garbage for most things. Just get a Ryzen or something like a 9400F asap.
---
Is your BBQ max level? That's the only thing I can think of. If it's not max level, then it's not +100% BP.
---
Because they can't stomp out killers every match now
---
yeah, never cause of d-strike, i'm not so reliant on tunneling the unhooked survivor for it to have a major effect
---
Coincidentally my ass
---
32k + 32k (bbq) + (32k*1.03) Gateau + 32k BP event = 128960
---
I play Xbox and I have definitely not been chased around by Mike wozalski with Shrek's face. 
---
That would be utterly terrifying.
---
They’ll probably just suspend people after too many disconnects
---
*stonks*
---
Here's the thing man.  I think almost everyone would have objectively defended you if it weren't for the use of hyperbole hating on all killers because of the actions of one baby one.  If your post had been worded a bit differently you'd see more comments like mine.
---
Ahhhh, I see. Thanks for answering!
---
Mixed bag really, some were quite good, others played like yellow ranks. Both sides have problems though pal, try playing survivor for a bit
---
I genuinely enjoy being nice to people as killer. Don't get me wrong, I still kill / do my objective, but a fun game for me is one where I can spook/scare survivors and make it fun for everyone involved. If I can tell I'm stomping them I'll let them get a few more gens done before I start downing them again so they feel like they accomplished more.
---
Everyone on here is like "do whatever the fuck you want, fuck everyone else, no rules!!!" and sure, that's true, there are no rules and you can do what you want, but people should WANT to make it a fun experience for everyone, it's a game 🙃
---
Really ? It’s taking me seconds because of this blood hunt
---
Double bloodpoints is just for your match score. Calling it double bloodpoints is sort of a misnomer. Think of it as a free bloody party streamers every game.
---
This goes for all bloodpoint offerings as well. If you get two bloody party streamers in a game that you get 30k in, it just gives you that 30k and additional 2 times. During blood hunts you get it a third time for free.
---
I feel that on a spiritual level. I've got a lot of hours in the game but I rarely ever played killer. I decided to change that though since the Demi came out. It sucks how people treat each other on here, especially newer players. I hope those toxic fucks don't turn you away but I wouldn't blame you if you did. They're unbearable.
---
Sort of reminds me of Team Fortress 2. It used to be known as a game that you could run on any computer back around 2010 and nowadays I get worse performance with my RX 480 and i5 6600K than I did with my GTX 460 and AMD 955 back then. They added so much crap to the game that it runs terribly.
---
Your editing makes me upset. Why do you have other clips in a clip of you playing?
---
You can see the exact moment panic sets in, glad it didn't last too long.
---
I played vs it a few times, but only on Coldwin Farm
---
Yeah, the only hard ruin skillchecks are the owns that spawn right next to the beginning.
---
So you'd rather play on your overpriced Fisher Price tablet at barely 25fps than get an nvidia shield or just stream to your phone with controller (60fps mind you and it'll STILL look better than the Switch's version)?
---
Problem is that, if you keep going for different people,you'll never win. If they are all good loopers with decisive strike, you don't win. You don't have the time, you really don't.
---
The thing would be amazing, and they could totally do it, but the mimic power would have to be more of a side thing to whatever his primary power would be, as it wouldn't be strong enough. He could use it as a way to drop terror radius and sneak up on the survivors, but he'd need something else, too.
---
Nurse ultra rare: Ojomo's last breath. Reveals the auras of all injured survivors within your terror radius when charging a blink
---
I've been getting the opposite, 4 streamers and a pudding =(
---
Yeah, sounds about what id expect from ya.
---
i have that too
---
A lot of games have done this as well. In Street Fighter V, if you don't DC, you have a symbol next to your name that shows you're a trusted fighter meaning that you don't DC.
---
I don't think a Symbol would be the best idea because people would just lobby dodge then. Considering it takes time to find a lobby, it would be a gigantic deterrence to the community. Rather, I like the idea of longer queue times, low priority, and straight up bans.
---
In DotA 2; the worse behaviour score you have, the longer you have to wait to find a match. You're also more likely to be put in low priority. When both of these don't work, straight up bans have been given out [in some cases, life time bans]. 
---
This may be harsh but, in reality, ruining the game for 4 other people simply because you're angry is justified. I put my free time into this game to relax, hangout, and rank up. However, I was stuck on rank 8 for what felt like forever because I would have 1 good game and 2 bad ones where people would insta-DC after their first down. I ended up becoming friends with random people I met and I always play SWF now, because I simply enjoy it more than worrying if someone will DC or not. It has gotten THAT bad, and I truly believe that banning these people who constantly DC over and over will make the community a better place.
---
Oh.. great. I love getting facecamped when I bring a party streamer in. Hard pass for three days.
---
I've been trying to farm. I'll take a survivor to a gen and hit it until they wiggle out and theyll just run off, it's kind of frustrating. Then theyll pretend they want to farm until they're close to the hatch , like listen dude you could've gotten the gate if you didn't try to slip by me and escape.
---
WHY NOT 2 KILLER AND 1 SURVIVOR. I JUST WANT BRENDAN FRASIER
---
Okay but you are toxic
---
OHHH YES PLS
---
Bloodpoint bonuses don’t multiply; every 100% bonus only adds 100% of your base to the total. So you get 32k for the match, then another 32k for BBQ, then another 32k for the bloodhunt.
---
My queue is 2-5 minutes as killer in low green ranks.
---
The creepiest is hands down Nea
---
Spirit is the most viable, Demo is probably the most fun, and Ghostface is the most rewarding.
---
in her lauch trailer she seemed to have green eyes so i put that color here :P
---
Bubba ultra rare: Pretty Mask. Putting a survivor in the dying state with your chainsaw resets the duration of the chainsaw
---
Honestly if you switch to survivor you'll be able to fit in four times more games then you would as killer. If you have leveled up people use bp perks, it'll even out
---
^(its actually my birthday around that date, I guess BHVR knew.)
---
The new NOED is lookin cool
---
I would hate if someone running WGLF caused my Exhaustion timer to start/reset.
---
Why is that bbq is a great perk and has the upside of more bp
---
Oh I know , I just had a Gateau cake I forgot about and figured I might as well us it lol
---
If you nerf Ruin then the entirety of red ranks collapses. It's necessary for the game at that point because otherwise with great skill checks gens get done in like sixty seconds and by then you maybe might have found one person and begun a chase.
---
Let it be until that problem gets fixed.
---
A killer that punishes you for looking at him, number 1 rule for Slender Man is "Don't look behind you".
---
A killer that gets an advantage if you look behind you like you would with any other killer would be dope.
---
You lose a LOT of info if you can't look behind you.
---
Alright sir imma need you to come with me to the toxic side of this community
---
Yeah I guess... Still that's so stupid
---
my problem is i look at him but it wont reveal him, I had one case i was looking right at him behind a thrown down pallet at lery's, NOTHING, Like his whole body was in front of my survivor and it wouldn't reveal him, (And no he was not using add ons to make the detection area smaller)
---
Micheal myers.
---
He has the creepiest movie and motive.
---
Hes also the most realistic.
---
It is frustrating to go against a good team, but we have ample evidence that there are other outcomes than all four survivors escaping.  Killers get sacrifices all the time.  I think there's a perception that only a 4k is a "win," but I think a 2k is probably the best outcome as everyone had more fun in that case.  Even so, 4ks happen.  A lot.
---
If survivors are able to use all their perks, pallets, and other resources effectively, that just means you got outplayed.  Meanwhile, I'm willing to bet they regularly make mistakes and you're savvy enough to exploit those mistakes.  That's why the game is fun.
---
Wasn't Lisa like 16 when she was kidnapped or am I just making stuff up?
---
100%!
---

---
They won't leave then, they'll just flashlight click and point until you find a way to M1 yourself.
---
Kind of new, how is this possible?
---
I play survivor as much as i play killer, the difference is ridiculous. Too easy to play survivor and i don't even use ds, it's funny. I keep the killer for a minute and 2 generators go and that's the end of the match already, because he doesn't have the time to catch the other survivors or even find them before i get saved and start a generator
---
Still the damn point. YOU asked for help. I helped you. You repaid me by killing me, bm'ing me, laughing at me and taunting me
---
Happened to me yesterday. Got juked so many times, I eventually cornered a pair that were hiding atop the combine and managed to sacrifice one
---
The subreddit is controlled by mostly killer mains, while post-game chat and BHVR forums are mostly controlled by survivors. It just reminds me of when I posted here some tips on survivors on how to deal with all the recent killer buffs, and got told to get off my high horse :/
---
SWF saved the game for me. I seriously hate playing this game solo, it's the absolute worst. You don't know if your teammates are going to insta-DC, kill themselves on their first hook, or body block you so you get hit by the killer.
---
Fuck you
---
No please, i already can see a lot of troll doctor builds for impossible skillchecks.....
---
Console is the same as PC tho
---
I've heard of the increased queue times thing, and putting repeat offenders in a pool with other repeat offenders. It still allows people to play the game, but penalizes them for their behaviour.
---
Oh sure does suck that you can rank up off of baby killers now
---
This is a great idea.  Or some character that has animal based powers/theming more generally.  Think like ESO's Warden or even the theming of Bloodhound in Apex (not animal, but kind of ranger-y/nature-y),.
---
Late night killer is fun because you almost exclusively get SWF groups and it's either meta squads that really challenge me or casual friend groups I can roleplay and take it slow against.
---
How did it happen?
---
I’ve become a survivor main because of the queue times. Ever since the ST chapter released, there have been 7 minutes of downtime between every killer game and it’s just not worth it.
---
I second this
---
It was a huge help for Smite after all the links were worked out. I would love this implementation.
---
He was probably pushed to do it.
---
Damn, never saw the worm one!  And only heard of Manhattan.  Yeah, he gets supernatural in VI I believe, with the lightning thing.  I'm sure there are some good choices from the movies I haven't seen.
---
I get constant messages on Xbox sometimes even off up to 3/4 survivors. Luckily Xbox is super strict for aggressive dms compared to PS4 so a report goes a long way.
---
I'm not tunneling either, i would lose every game if i didn't leave them on the ground. Problem is when they have those items and they also decent at looping. it's not possible to get more than a black pip and that happens pretty fucking often lately.
---
Which killers? The DLC? If it’s that then they are, all of them
---
You're*
---
I agree it's usually a good challenge. can be frustrating though if you're a bit overtired and aren't trying as hard by accident.
---
Nurse. But I go against Spirit A LOT more. Thats literally the Console Killer. Every game is spirit or hillbilly. Nurse is rare on console, but they will do ANYTHING for a 4k.
---
You seem to complain about DS a lot. Do you tunnel?
---
Did you give the last survivor the hatch at least?
---
Mine is a mix of both images, Killers using BPS/Cakes and OP shit with moris and then being like "WTF??" in the afterlobby after 2 people dc
---
Why'd you stay while she was fatigued?
---
I usually killer main the Pig, she’s pretty realistic, running at people with a knife and putting a trap on their head 😂
---
On Xbox red ranks, most nurses will literally demolish everyone.
---
T-posing Myers
---
Glitched Chainsaw Myers
---
Shirtless Myers
---
Kung-Fu Myers.
---
That plus invites to party chat with an ensuing “pussy” comment.
---
Yep lag monster is in the game and the devs never told us
---
Right, I get this... but I also hate NEEDING to play swf. I don’t want to give the killer a sweaty tryhard match... but it’s the only way to play now. :/ 
---
Even when I’m play killer, it’s redonk. Waiting 15 min for a game just to have high experience players stuck in rank 15... like me. 
---
Rank system needs to revert back to the original, or be taken out completely.
---
you didnt address his point though
---
WoO isn't as bad as people say. Sure it isn't top tier, but it can heavily extend chases. Say you runnin, the shack on left, jungle gym on right. WoO tells you the shack pallet has been used, the jungle gym still has one. Thanks to that perk, instead of going down because you expected a pallet and one wasn't there, you can always extend a chase as far as possible.
---
This is fully me as killer. Just obliviously walkin around
---
It really feels like i am the only killer available at the moment who is willing to play according to bloodhunt rules
---
Not really. 3/5 killers (I am one of them) ask the survivors if they'd like to farm.
---
I can agree with Whispers and Borrowed Time but Kindred and BBQ as base abilities are too much.
---
Legion since you'll be trashed and just want to run around. These guys out here are doing builds and as an alcoholic I'll say after I'm buzzed strats are out the window
---
It's a known glitch that's listed in the latest patch notes. For some reason they released it knowing this was an issue.
---
First game I used a cake I got face camped by a nurse. Feels bad man
---
This is beautiful. I love Adiris. Whoever did this deserves a blessing from the priestess herself.😌💙🙆‍♂️
---
I once played with a fellow survivor named something like “XxXShadowSlayerKillerXxX” who in the lobby told us to be gen jockeys as he flawlessly ran the killer around the map. He died after waisting the god pallet and disconnected immediately
---
&gt;Has the update make more appear at higher ranks
---
Yup, since even just 1 person in their party being high ranks, puts them into high ranked games.
---
An add on that makes the spirit silent whilst she is using her power, so you don’t hear that whooshing sound
---
doesn’t even make sense to Mori u literally get less BP
---
I got several 4ks in a row with spooky wraith and I think he’s pretty good
---
Yes, level 3.
---
I wish i was as lucky as you are :( I bet you are playing in NA servers
---
I've rarely gotten salt on Xbox. Only from Ghost Faces, spirits or 4 man swfs. I play about 60% survivor 40% killer.
---
So cute! How do I upvote more than once 😂 oink oink
---
All my friends just find their lobby but i simply can't
---
thanks. I appreciate it.
---
zzzz
---
Yeah. I'm probably never gonna Prestige Trappy boi just because of this lol
---
Blinking, scratching, yawning, taking a quick drink and sneezing have all made me miss skill checks WITHOUT lullaby. Not to mention spotting a stealth killer nearby. You either have less than 5 hours played or take Adderall when playing survivor if you've never missed a skill check.
---
I love christmas
---
Really? Maybe we're different regions bc I rarely get salt. (Both survivor and killer.)
---
I got salt as a survivor from another survivor that I was a sell out when I just stopped trying to escape after a spirit with rancor, NOED, and an ebony Mori killed the last person and found me (the obsession) and killed me, this was on PS4 btw
---
First I'm gonna say that dbd wiki is a thing 
---
Second, Prayer beads is an add on for spirit and the key. For spirit it removes her phasing sound and for the key it adds 15 seconds of use
---
So the only way to get over the 128K is to have more than 1 party streamer i guess?
---
I am, yeah. It's kinda evened out, somewhat over half my games are farming, the other half are sweaty and un-fun.
---
\&gt;making sense instead of being angry
---
no thx there's a twitch streamer in my lobby
---
yeah unfortunately nobody else had a bloody party streamers and i dont have bbq on legion yet &lt;/3
---
I'll never understand the \*clickety click\* when they are in danger.
---
Wait! You mean exhaustion doesnt cooldown when I am running?
---
I'm on PS4 too.
---
Megs face is the scariest thing to me
---
Demogorgon is huge and strong, pig Isn't, so...
---
Are you on Xbox or Ps4? That might've actually been me because that sounds really familiar.
---
PS4 has the most weirdly obsessive messages. Mainly just because if you set your account to friends only the person has to go out of their way to navigate your account and send you a friend request with the message they wanted to say to you attached to it. It would take so much less time to just play another game but they do that instead
---
Because you basically *have* to run it to get BP at a reasonable rate, and not every killer has a lot of synergy with it.
---
That’s a stupid idea, BBQ is good as it is. You make it so Killers are forced to tunnel survivors to get the bonus percent bloodpoints which is a bad idea.
---
The changes along with the WGLF are terrible, the perks are fine how they are.
---

the downvotes are so funny because it's actually so accurate. I wouldn't say 99% though lmao
---
So you're all saying play normally, as a killer trying to farm at this event I hit a gen while carrying a survivor and they run away, do you really want to discourage farming ?

I really hope the copyright fight gets settled soon, it would be great to see another Jason move/more games. I was really disappointed with how the F13 game kinda fell apart. A lot of things contributed to its slow death, but the legal wrangling didn't help.

Most killers aren't that bad though. I quit the game about 8 months ago for numerous reasons, but one of them was that killer was so easy it was boring. I was consistently getting 4k's every game with almost every killer, even pre rework freddy, at rank 1. People are genuinely bad at this game, and then they come on here and complain about how OP survivors are. 
---
I played the game when survivors were genuinely OP, and the entire game was stacked against killers. And I did okay most rounds. After the numerous killer buffs over the years the game has just become easy. People are whining because they are bad. You can easily do extremely well at rank one. The only thing that ever gave me problems is 4 man swf's who were actually good. Which wasn't even 1 in 100 matches in my experience.
---
Survivors definitely shouldn't tbag unless the killers a douche though. I've always thought that.
---
To be honest, and I don't mean to sound like a jerk when I say this, but there is nothing wrong with wanting to try in a video game. IF you want to tryhard and rank up, then that's perfectly normal. You want to improve, you want to get better, and the best way to do that is to take it seriously. 
---
If you want to play SWF but don't want to try hard, then you don't have to! Go in there, have fun, and make the most of it. I've had tons of games as killers where survivors just dicked around, and I had a blast joking around with them
---
Check this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bhslsa/all_dbd_audio_files_v12_spoilers/
---

---
Some lovely unrelated content.
---
It's happening to everyone, even on survivors.
---
Nah it wasnt me then, still weird though.
---
Hahaha I find her adorable, I’d marry that 😂
---
imho all hex totems should look like dull totems for at least the first 60 seconds of a game and then slowly light up over the next 60 seconds, so after 120 seconds it would look like it does now.
---
I can also see why some people argue for hex totems just all looking like dull totems for the whole duration of a match but I'd prefer to introduce a solution thats in between both extremes first to see if that isn't enough of a fix already.
---
I think it was to make sure the Jane made out.
---
I do but occasionally, if they complete the first 2 generators the first minute, i force a kill. If you play killer you would know that you can't go for different hooks all the time and you can't tunnel all the time, you would lose miserably
---
Shelter Woods, Azarov's Resting Place, Yamaoka Estate.
---
I can justify mori's on streamers
---
You can’t perform actions for a few seconds after the Doctor shocks you. If he times it right he can stop you from being able to vault a window, drop a pallet, or vault a pallet.
---
I just cant find one lobby. Been playing for 3 hours and got into 3 matches
---
hag cuz jump scares and frustrating camera flick when traps are tripped
---
Came here for this
---
Loses all heartbeat and glow, exposed and can mori any survivor, hair grows to 1/4 the size of the map.
---
wait what's the wiki link
---
I think to be sure that hag didn't pick his friend up.
---
Good to know that you're a good player who is not toxic about it though, it gets hard playing killer sometimes lol.
---
Looping is a way for the survivors to interact with the killer and have a chance at survival. It's not absurd as this is an arcade horror game.
---
When you're at Tier 3 insanity you get that popup. You scream and reveal your location unless you "snap out if it." Jump in a locker to have it slowly go down.
---
Just search dbd wiki
---
It may have to do with your connection or rank then.
---
every time i see this guy lose he pitches a massive fit
---
I just wonder why are people downvoting u lol wtf
---
That stump behind Bill’s leg kinda looks like it has a Hillbilly’s face on its right side.
---
I think they all lagged out because it didn’t make the dc sound when they quit
---
Maybe he read the wiki and thats why he asked for the dumb down version aka "Explain like I am 5"
---
BBQ is great. That's why I'm not hurting the functionality of the perk at all. I'm improving the functionality of *every killer who doesn't have BBQ or who doesn't want to run it*.
---
No, this doesn't force the killer to tunnel for BP. It forces them to *win* for BP, which is a different procedure entirely from "making sure the Scoops Ahoy doesn't make it out alive".
---
WGLF is absolutely not fine. The perk does literally nothing other than boost survivor BP gains from "abysmal" to "decent".
---
Im rank 14, and my con ection is pretty decent. I have fiber 200 mbs
---
Jesus, what platform are you on ?
---
Sometimes it just kind of happens to be where I am. As killer, I try to chase Survivors literally anywhere but around my hex totems.
---
Same.
---
I meant more so that they’re going in opposite directions lol
---
You can't depip before rank 15 unless they changed it or some weird bug happened.
---
PC
---
This idea has been beaten to death, mimic killers would be destroyed by a swf group and would become a lower tier killer than bubba.
---
Yes sir. It lasted 11-13 minutes i think
---
I had a Spirit slug everyone today. 3 of us brought bps and we only got a total of 25-30k bp I think.
---
Oh good learn to play, please, the demogoron is garbage ! Dont cleanse his portals, if he missplaces them, do gens, jesus !
---
implying people aren't monsters
---
hmm maybe the region you connect to on steam is wrong? maybe go into the folder where dbd is installed and try running the exe as administrator. Sounds like a weird problem
---
As a main spirit, the best you can do is keep seeing it at all time, and when you see she is still, run for the nearest window or pallet and jumped how quick you can, since while she is phasing she just only run
---
I severely doubt it would become the best perk in the game, lol
---
The game's great, it's the assholes I'm matched with (fuck you Dr. Bryant :D) that drive me up the walls.
---
Actually yes and because we arnt used to it, it gets annoying realy quickly, the plauge wont shut up !
---
So we had a short discussion about the awesome Slenderman concept, seen [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d9al79/this_would_be_a_dream_come_true_whoever_made_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
*I wanted to expand on this very cool concept, and see what mechanics would be interesting to play* ***against*** *as a survivor, I feel most of the interesting mechanics we see are reserved for playing as the killer, and I hope that can change:*
---
**Slenderman** would have to have some attributes similar to that of The Doctor, with a touch of Nurse. Slenderman has the ability to blink directly into the line of sight of a survivor, at a certain (fair) distance in-front, he remains absolutely still and staring at his target for a short period.
---
Being caught in the line of sight several times allows for a "tier-up", **but** he *tiers up the survivor* (rather than himself), during this pre-tier phase he is unable to do any direct melee damage. Tiering up the survivor causes S**lender sickness**, (think doctor paranoia), survivor's nose begins to bleed indicating they are now vulnerable. *This idea is interesting because it in terms of looping and escaping it calls for survivors to flip 180 degrees quickly to avoid Slenderman's gaze.*
---
Until this first phase of sickness, he has been extremely hard to see / distorted (?) - once your nose is dripping blood, you are now vulnerable to his brutal methods.
---
As tier's begin to grow, false alarms begin to fire off - **Slender paranoia** sets in as survivors are unable to determine exactly where, or indeed *which* distant staring figure, is the actual killer. Finally all survivors are caught in his realm, the fates of others, hooked locations, damage status, etc, become cloudy and uncertain.
---
*Well what if you play SWF you ask?* Survivors vision is distorted (blindfolded) as they are being **escorted** to the hook - Slenderman keeps his methods secrets (as the survivor hooks themself?!) and his lore remains intact.
---
What is this, Friday the 13th: The Game? LMFAO!
---
Why is everyone asking for a Friday the 13th chapter when it’s a game on it’s own
---
? you couldn’t break gens back in the day
---
This community may have a weird fetish with Michael Myers, but at least they recognize him as a slasher GOD
---
Level 5 and managed to get an ebony? Now that's lucky
---
It just gets more getting used to. Her strongest addons aren’t that great like no noise when she’s using her ability it gives nothing else compared to her other purple that gives her four moderate enhancements. Still nowhere near as strong as just instantly killing full health survivors like tombstone Myers. Sure he’s slightly slower but damn.
---
In the triple BP event we all ran WGLF with 5 bloodpoint offerings. we got like over 400K
---
She’s hard to play against. Fair. 
---
She does NOT need a nerf or a rework. You just need to learn how to play against her.
---
Might I suggest you try to play her yourself and learn from other survivors.
---
I’m not amazing with her but I’m pretty good, I still get slapped around like an little bitch by some good survivors.
---
Will try that out tomorrow, thanks! :)
---
Tony Hawk is more likely to get in this game
---
I'm also curious
---
A diavolo/doppio killer or Kira yoshikage killer would be freaking awesome
---
That just makes WGLF even worse, which is actually kind of incredible as until this post I was incapable of imagining a way to do so.
---
I really like the hex pumpkin totems!
---
See the entity thought you meant “stalks” instead
---
Great post! Thank you! Couldn't agree more!
---
how in the hell are those purple ranks
---
i thought they are just a bunch of yellow ranks that watched no0b3's montages and think they are good at the game
---
It hurts so much
---
Guess it depends on which server youre playing in. If its NA you are fine, if its EU you are fucked
---
That’s why I run sloppy, bbq, dying light, and thrilling tremors 😎
---
You didn’t say that he was face camping you. Lol. Did he stand there and stare at you until someone tried to unhook you? 
---
Or did he leave and come back just in time to see the person unhooking you?
---
Either way is shitty, but tbh I’d be blaming whatever team mate decided to try and unhook you directly in front of him or within his terror radius.
---
It was on the Level 3 Bloodweb I believe.
---
Why stop at Dying Light? What about STBFL, PWYF, Rancor, Remember Me, Dark Devotion and Furtive Chase.
---
Happy Early Halloween to you aswell :)
---
There's this weird thing called a "job" that most people have during the day. You work for them and they pay you money. 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job
---
thx that means a lot !
---
A perk that goes from doing *nothing* to doing *something*, with a more natural version of its current effect being put into every survivor without needing to allocate a perk slot.
---
thx :)
---
Im not sure anymore but I think you could switch abilities
---
i wish !
---
You say you’re new to the game but you also claim to be a red rank killer and survivor, only one of those things is really possible
---
And here it takes me 30 levels to get BBQ up to 3 &lt;/3
---
Lmao pretty much. They were just very lucky with their matches i think
---
YES pls that would be awesome
---
i always wondered why killer like Nurse or Plague don't have different colors cosmetic for their powers.
---
Doc I think.
---
Though anything you are good at and have max BBQ on is better if you don't have perks on doc.
---
It's a stressful situation, needing to fix generators to escape a supernatural serial killer orchestrated by Cthulhu, I'm surprised Bill hasn't had a heart attack yet too.
---
OH YES!!!
---
The perk BBQ &amp; Chili with bloodpoint offerings
---
Thanks. i have no idea how to make use of my cake day. I kinda wish i had a legit place to post maybe my youtube channel or twitch since i never get views, id hope maybe i could for my cake day, but so may people spam theirs all the time, it would just get removed.
---
anyways, Yeah. I have yet to play any of the new content for dbd, but i was at pax when they announced Ash and i was unimpressed.
---
Ft13th DOES have music but only after you're hit or you SEE Jason and you start being chased...like melee proximity...then of course, the classic "jason sound effect", as i dont know how to really describe it in text lol...
---
I would love to see, as ridiculous as it is, Jason-X too lol.
---
Graphical glitch. Was a bug.
---
Bug.
---
You implied 100% hitting, I was just saying with 5 stack of HL, I probably fail 1/4 even if I'm paying attention and know that HL is up (especially when they are the early target zones)
---
I’m confused can you elaborate what’s happening
---
Gotta love killers with no real internet connection too.
---
Honestly I couldn’t even read this reply. The grammar was pretty bad. But if what I think you said is correct, a survivor can only be a hooked a max of 3 times. The second hook they go into struggle, the 3rd they die instantly.
---
You know what.
---
I'm proud of you too.
---
Wrong Flair.
---
Lery's, Lery's, and Lery's! FUCK LERY'S!
---
Yeee
---
Oh trust me man most players acknowledge that she is one of the two a killers in need of nerfs, wether major or minor.  The nurse is overpowered and unstoppable, but only in the right hands.  You're not gonna pick up nurse and destroy first game.  She takes a lot of practice, so you at least have to give nurse players that.  Spirit on the other hand can destroy too, however not much skill or brainpower is needed.  This is why she's thought to be such a problem, even though a good nurse is worse for survivors than a spirit in terms of counterplay.
---
Also it’s not rng if he dies
---
Any killer with BBQ but preferably the one you are most confident with.
---
Who is this Behavior Official?
---
Ruin is fine how it is. It’s the totem spawns that are the problem. Ruin is being placed out in the open the majority of the time.
---
I almost always do unless the match was particularly ruthless.
---
Top left, true neutral. Top right, chaotic evil. Bottom left, lawful neutral. Bottom right, chaotic good
---
I just got Nancy to p3 aswell :) totally worth it. Being my favourite character in the show is literally the best gift ever. Her p3 is really cool, but I dont like her pants. Cant even see the blood :/
---
Bloodhunts usually bring out the worst in the community, other people going out of there way to ruin the fun of others, more so than usual.
---
Shame really, as it could be a time for the community to come together and just enjoy the game, have some fun and enjoy lots of blood points
---
If the ruin spawns where the killer is, survivors know that the killers spawn at the furthest point from them so it's guaranteed they will find the ruin if they go to the other side of the map.
---
Idk man, I like the excitement of finding a lit up totem. Plus it looks cool.
---
Man I hate DS.  
---
In this clip, your DS is used AT THE END OF THE MATCH because they didn't tunnel otherwise it'd be used up.  The killer's reward for playing fair?  
---
Getting DSd at the gates.  
---
I swear, DS needs to be reworked again if it keeps getting used like this.
---
I had once the totem in the middle of the map, nothing covering it, on asylum.
---
Behaviour should really think twice before placing these totems, seriously...
---
First I never said it would become the best perk in the game.  I said it would be among the best perks in the game.  There is a difference.
---
Second I question your knowledge of this game if you can't understand how strong a guaranteed, unremovable Huntress Lullaby effect would be throughout entire games.  Any good killer would have a field day slowing gens to a crawl.  There is a reason the devs made it a Hex perk.
---
Th-their all in a corner?
---
Yeah that or missing people pages as well
---
Trapper with a chainsaw looks terrifying ngl.
---
Last night had the gate opened but the bar would just not move at all, i havent played in a few weeks is this a new one or has this bug been going on awhile?
---
Then you're just gonna have to accept you're gonna get ds'd
---
I’m sorry what
---
I don’t care if Killers farm but that doesn’t mean that you have to go super try hard with pink and purple add ons every game.
---
Why would they have to be weak in other areas? Mimicry is a garbage power.
---
SWF exist.
---
As a main killer, that's fucked up man, u shouldn't lie to farm and kill everyone, a man should honor his word.
---
Now I am kinda happy that glitch is in the game
---
Sometimes as Doctor people DC as soon as they hear the first scream, even with party streamers on bloodhunt.
---
I had a survivor accuse me of hacking because they weren't even remotely sneaky (hiding on a hill by a hook isn't stealth) 
---
In reality, i haven't played since right after freddy's rework and I got pushed all the way back to rank 17
---
obligatory comment here, sorry. she could puke on me anytime 😩👌🏼
---
Exhaustion used to go down while running back in the day, but a bit ago they changed it so that it only goes down while walking or crouching. It was a good change, being able to extend loops even longer from a lucky exhaust cooldown was terrible, plus vacuum pallets.
---
Supposedly it's because SWF would destroy the killer and Solo players would be fucked. "Balancing issue"
---
However, I personally disagree since you can say the same thing to Stealth Killers
---
I'm still wondering how the myers with a chainsaw bug even happened, i mean, why is there a chainsaw and a myers model loaded in the same match? lmao
---
Bubba is a Lalafel?
---
These are sooo cool.
---
Thanks a lot buddy :)
---
That's pretty accurate.
---
From the score he got around 24k bp at base + 24k bonus for the event + 24k probably from using BBQ and chilly and getting all 4 hooks + 4 double bp offerings (streamers or gateau) = 24k x 7= 161k
---
Hag gets me on jumpscares
---
Myers because he hit tier 3 every time JUST before he finds me
---
Cant hate ghostyboi, he just wants friends to take selfies with
---
Fuck claudettes
---
I think it was a thing where you could bug the game into giving you the ability of one character and the look of another. IIRC it only worked in KYF, but I might be wrong.
---
IMO Nancy's p3 is amazing, it looks awesome on her! Great job!
---
Well I did do part of my plumbing apprenticeship and my favourite colour is green. Luigi confirmed.

Tru3's idea of "balance" is killers 4king every single match. He bitches relentlessly otherwise.

Getting good perks for Demogorgon, Enduring for my Leatherface and maybe some points for the survivors.

Plague: bruh I got sick
---
Entity: YEET
---
But why, he’s a weak ass killer.
---
I really don't understand, the game has a huge playerbase according to Steam Charts so why does it take forever?
---
They did a great job on both of them. Nancy and Steve's P3s are phenomenal, definitely my favourites in the game.

There is this weird thing called "timezones" you should learn about them!

She walks like a super model

Killer. Takes forever

The big problem with Clown and the thing I always cite when people ask me "What's one thing you'd change about Clown?" is this:
---
&gt;Clown's 15% 2 second slow slows him down by 15% for 2 seconds.
---
Clown's slow addons (Flask of Bleach / Ether Vol%) and cool-down addons (feathers) are **literally mandatory** to play him because of this design oversight. And since you are literally forced to use one of his two addons to make his power to work this gives him very little build variety.
---
I think most of the time Clown is better than Legion in theory, since Clown can get two hits at a modest rate while Legion can get a first hit very fast and spends a long time getting the second hit. It might just be that whenever I play Legion Survivors lose brain cells since "Legion low tier" or "Legion annoying" but I find that I get the second hit as Legion at about the same speed it would take me to get a hit as Clown. Henceforth the time saved on the first hit results in more time saved overall.
---
I dunno. Clown just needs some buffs, 'tis all.
---
As for emblems they really penalize you for not running Ruin. You often won't pip in general even if you 4k if your Ruin is found too fast (or in your case if you don't have it), since the time that generators aren't finished contributes to your emblems.
---
Pre rework Legion intensifies
---
There used to be a glitch where you could make the game think the killer power was an item by switching menus from survivor and killer, and you were able to equip different killer powers onto different killers, I think that’s how it worked
---
Yeah, I have no fun as Survivor but I've gotten pretty good at Sudoku and Scrabble playing in between games.
---
You know you could just go to setting and turn it off so you can’t get messages from non-friends.
---
Legion, doc, demo
---
&gt;Killer. Takes forever
---
Welcome to bloodhunts. The killer population gets way higher than usual.
---
The issue with survivors having to make mistakes is that for some killers who have to rely on survivors slipping up can play perfectly but Survivors can run so many second chance perks that make it so a Killer still has the possibility of losing.
---
That's definitely true. Last night I had a match as Legion on Rotten Fields in red ranks and the gates were powered within 4 minutes to my best estimate. It didn't help I chased the wrong injured kate and got a DS into Adrenaline combo.
---
Matches like that are just a loss, the only way I could have won was if the survivors made awful errors. I see it the same as facing Spirit on Shelter Woods. Sure it's possible to win, but it's much less about how you play and more about your opponent making mistakes.
---
It's best to remember there's a lot of chance that goes into each match, so some games you just have to work a lot harder than others. Otherwise I can go to bed really frustrated.
---
OK you're sort of right I'll stand in the corner and face the wall
---
Nah she probably threw herself down them once she saw you were playing nurse. 
---
For real though, I’m guessing this happened during the mori?
---
Edit: it was probably the dc actually
---
found the guy who doesn't have a job
---
Scoops. Scoops Ahoy. *heheh*
---
That actually scared me
---
Did an oopsie, meant couldn't
---
Just equip Hex: Memeless Mode
---
The game literally runs at 22-THIRTY* fps on the Switch in docked mode. It looks like total ass and I don't think portable makes it any better tbh fam. If you had a good PC and router why don't you get a shield and just stream it to it at 1080p60?
---
No I murdered them all, because I’m an epic gamer
---
UGLEH
---
Lmao amber alerts for dcers
---
plenty of reason tbh, i find a lot of docs use noed and camp. Also people with bad pc's cant handle the FPS drop.
---
I meant: As a main killer speaking, thats fucked up...
---
U should at least honor ur word.
---
That just confirms what most ppl say, main survivors are toxic, even if they are playing killers.
---
I just hope u stop doing that to people and grow up.
---
I use Lcontrol for crouch, Lshift for sprint, spacebar to drop pallets+skillchecks+etc., wasd for movement, and I put drop as R. I almost never use it.
---
"I don't like something, so everyone else should change to better suit my needs!"
---
You're the one person out of 159,650 members that thinks this, I dont think it's gonna happen chief.
---
I hate toxic swf. They all swarm a hook, seconds after you hook someone, and if you down any of them you're a camping tunneling pos that should commit don't breathe apparently
---
Freddy and Leatherface are missing along with his maps.
---
Exactly! I don't want to have to buy Myers and level him up again on 2 platforms. One was enough
---
I play killer less than I used to because of this. It's stressful and takes away all the fun I used to have playing killer.
---
The old Dying Light felt like you had tunnel the Obsession and that wasn't enjoyable for either party, but locking it at the current stacks would be nice. If I remeber correctly, STBFL locks the current token number if the obsession DCs or dies so it shouldn't be too hard to add that same mechanic to Dying Light.
---
Wow, such empty . . .
---
It was the mori on the stairs :D
---
Hillbilly myers is in my nightmares
---
Killers earn more bloodpoints than survivors so more people play Killer during blood hunt, resulting in longer wait times.
---
Wrong. Her base kit is broken. Its like if old legion was broken AND good.
---
God every time a Shred missed just ruined it for me, I can't stand how horrible the turning slowdown feels then how abruptly it goes from slow as hell to whiplash after recovering.
---
Well more like a game you find in an online arcade.
---
nothing special? just everyday toxic player. i thought gonna be epic or funny moment tho
---
I don't blame em. I've just been rushing gens every game. 3 killers have rage quit so far, 1 even wasted their own Gateau lol.
---
Trust me. It won't work.
---
Pretty sure it still made noise but obviously Killers wouldn't hear people working on them further.
---
I’m not a big fan of the better killers so it’s more of a challenge for me to have fun. A challenge I certainly don’t enjoy. I mainly play Legion and Pig because I love Saw and love the Legion concept but they aren’t the best so there’s nothing much I can really do against good survivors
---
Join the scoop troop
---
so are you crying that make you post in here? i mean u DC from a game because get juked lol
---
I wish, I’m just getting the usual campers and tunnelers.
---
Every time I get these matches today so far has been nothing but face camping tunneling killers.
---
I'm just sitting here like yo, everyone trying to get points. We can all walk out of here happy but you just wanna be a cock sucker instead.
---
How thicc was he?
---
Why did you DC?
---
He would have a perk where if a survivor escaped your grasp, (decisive/wiggleout) can just straight up mori them if you catch them within 30 seconds 
---
What do y’all think?
---
grow a pair and move on. the fact you even posted that here is evidence it upset you
---
Not really, especially if the guy doesn't DC within the first 1-2 minutes of the game because most of the time a gen will be done by then with another one almost done if they are decent at hitting greats or ruin is found early or just about done if ruin is till up and they can't hit greats all that well.
---
Is he wrong tho?
---
You deserve it, you are a quitter, you only think about yourself and not how it’s going to affect your teammates, just delete the game because we don’t like people like you!
---
leave it to r/dbdgonewild they will *modify* this image
---
Well you left game so that would make you guilty.
---
Try not to dc then. I bet you’ll get less of these types of messages
---
i had sort of the same issue today, the bar was going down but i couldn't see where it was on the timer since it stayed full for the entire endgame.
---
Just got bill at 10 with Wglf at level 3 feelsgoodman
---
I solo like I'm part of the Goonies.
---
Feels bad when you save a couple other players from the hook, only to have them flat out ignore you when you need healing, or worse, 99% you and then teabag you and run the killer into you.
---
Then I play opposite games, where it seems like I'm just soloing the gens by myself, and I have no idea what anyone else is doing.  Besides pulling each other off the hook right in front of the killer.
---
With kindred, it's even more depressing, since you can see everyone else and they can see each other, and yet not a single person is doing anything but hiding.
---
You shouldn't have DC'd in the first place
---
Tecnically huntress is kinda human, she has a motherly side on her but shes so animalistic she cant treat people as humans
---
Damn. When was there a triple?
---
No, you could literally silence them at 99%. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teY7FEYLaZY
---
When there are no events, killer lobbies are longer too. I guess you make a good point, but it's still unfair that one role has to wait 10 minutes and the other 10 seconds don't you think?
---
you should remember that game was made to be fun and enjoy. if you dont have time for waiting match game ( thats make you not having fun ), i think u should play survivor since almost instant match.
---
Yep, and the devs won't fix them anytime soon. I love wraith but if I play him I know I'll lose 90% of the time. 
---
I don't want to be forced to play Spirit or Nurse just to have a chance.
---
Basically there was a bug where you could quickly swap between killers/survivors and change their ability/item or one of their perks.  It resulted in Survivors being able to carry the Chainsaw as an item and they could then drop it for a Killer to pick up and it would override their existing ability.  Thus you could have the Trapper/Myers/etc. with the Billy chainsaw - I think it was the only item that actually worked with other Killers though.
---
Also once it started catching on over Christmas, Killers started using it so that they could have Bond as a perk.
---
Survivor lobbies are terrible too if youre not at green ranks or lower
---
Dude her base kit is not broken legion was so much worse. I don't play killer at all tho so maybe in not the best judge
---
Honestly, its gramatically correct. Read "The Witcher: Last Wish." It'll be a great first read for you as your first book since the Netflix show is coming soon... Its ok. Not all of us can process thoughts as well as others.
---
Same happens with killer sometimes. Ill use party streamers and get the sweatiest survivors.
---
The shred always feels too short or it doesnt hit when it should.. its really weird
---
I don’t think it does, unfortunately, or it would make sense to pop as you go.  I know I’ve cleansed a hex after a dull before having to use IS, but I can’t remember if I needed to try and use IS more than once during those matches.
---
Audio cues only and maybe some auras
---
It would be nice if there was some way to play casually, but as you play the harder it gets and it forces you to try hard and forced you to use better killers to win.
---
I loved the chainsaw glitch, just 
---
“Huh I hear Billy but I don’t hear a heartb-“
---
“OH JESUS”
---
Whats Wglf?
---
I use doc with infectious fright and bbq&amp;chilli, usually someone DCs in the first minute, and I don’t camp or tunnel when I play killer.
---
Im a main killer and I love to farm when BP are up.
---
I love it when a survivor DC and then message you calling you trash.
---
If only...
---
WAhhhhh, i need validation
---
While I think the battlepass is coming in the next mid chapter update, the post you’re linking to is talking about the Archives. The Rift is the battlepass coming to the game.
---
Wraith: I killed my boss for the lives he tricked me into taking.
---
I mean... it isn't good to be mean to other people but also, you are kind of a lil bitch if you disconnected because you were doing poorly.
---
If that's the case, maybe the lesson is that both of you are awful.
---
We’re Gonna Live Forever
---
if you dont having fun, just quit. game was made for fun. you dont get kill? doesnt mean you not having fun. you playing competitive to get higher rank? doesnt mean you having fun in higher rank too. just remember why u playing game. remove stress? or just having alot time to wasted. just enjoy it, mostly survivor waiting at exit gates because want another bloodpoints for chase or protection hit btw
---
Spirit has almost no counter play. You will die against a good spirit if she wants you dead.
---
We're gonna live forever
---
When you finished charging up the saw, it would sometimes radically jerk to one side if you were turning. Some players got used to this and made it a part of their playstyles. Others saw this as a frustrating bug and learned to play around it. Depending on what you did, this will either be a godsend or will require to relearn billy curves
---
As survivor, it seems that the matchmaking always adds me to them when I solo queue.
---
Also the game's kind of a mess so trying to go back to the code for it etc. would be a challenge.
---
Yeah lmao I thought this was ghostface or something stalking them
---
I’m with him
---
What are you voting for?
---
It's a 4v1 situation for every person that wants to play as killer you need 4 more people that want to play survivor. So if everyone wants to play killer then there's going to be long wait times. If you are driving down the freeway and get in traffic you become part of the problem. If less people wanted to play killer there wouldn't be this problem but it's something beyond the developers control at this point
---
So what’s your build as a killer? What add-ons do you use? I’m very intrigued. Better not be anything actually good.
---
?
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/px2nUvq](https://imgur.com/a/px2nUvq)
---
i was a survivor too thats the funny part lmao
---
Rancor is used at the end of the game, you should be out the door or about to be out the door anyway. Plus, the game would (or rather should) recognize that the killer used the mori part of their Rancor perk and they would be unable to use it again if a new obsession is picked.
---
I simply suggested a change to a possibly overlooked problem with a single perk, but sure, we could sit here and talk about every single possible example of "what if this happend..." with every obsession perk if you want. 
---
As for one person being gone, I have been playing for years and let me tell you that losing one person changes next to nothing unless everyone else is an absolute potatoe.
---
That's what I'm saying, they make you play survivor. I don't want to play survivor anymore I'm just bored of it...
---
I just wasted 9k on spirit :(  still worth it imo
---
H0t
---
Thanks man - I would like to really commit to this game since I've always wanted to play something like it (and we all know how EVOLVE turned out...), so I'm trying to learn to take the losses on the chin - especially in these early days where I barely have a build to speak of c: 
---
In fairness my matches have (for the most part) generally been much better since the 'fix' this week - I can even get sacrifices sometimes!! Tho earlier today I had a real stinker of a game with a Claudette who worked in tandem with a loop-god of a player to make me really miserable lol
---
It is what it is tho I suppose, just trying to laugh it off and enjoy the game regardless c:
---
No harm in doing so, if you're worried about being insulted turn off the chat (or ignore messages if you're on console)
---
*eeeeeeh* he is pretty much just a M1 killer if he cant use his chainsaw which... is alot of the time
---
Could you imagine BHVR getting the rights to use the last slasher movie icon of Jason fucking Voorhees in their game that includes Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Ghostface, and Leatherface, and then scrapping the entire thing because they can't think of a power?
---
Wouldn't happen lol. If they had to they'd reuse Trapper's traps or Huntress' hatchets and mix them up like Billy and Bubba already are.
---
Yep, but with just jumping you will make it very difficult that she hit you
---
I wish they would add cosmetics for items. Like traps or bear traps or totems. I would buy the shit outta some pumpkin totems
---
Lmao I was playing killer and all the survivors were throwing and when i played survivor all the killers threw
---
Very good did laugh.
---
Jason as the survivor
---
There's an option in the sub to hide the meme posts.
---
Honestly ranks mean just about nothing, I've gotten purple ranks plenty of times and I have no idea how to actually play or loop, but just by playing a lot you'll rank up anyway. Red ranks is a different story though
---
Shes not meant to be run around like other normal killers. You cant see her and she cant see you. Its tough but if she messes up, it could be devastating to her
---
Well he's gotta have his classic "ooh ooh ooh... ah ah ah" noise in there somehow, so the teleport idea would be a dope way to include that
---
Shut the fuck up, I can talk about my favorite movie whenever the Hell I like.
---
Yea if this is a common occurrence I’m out once those gates are powered
---
I don't care for the meme posts either, but I just sort by new to find the content I'm searching for.
---
That’s weird, should be looked at.
---
Did you Kobe close to struggle phase? I've only ever had this happen to me when i was just about to go into struggle phase.
---
Yes. Sometimes theyre less common than ultra rare offerings
---
Right. I left off at 65 during the event for my pig so that I can have some for my survivors. RIP to those though since I forgot my cakes existed on my survivors and I prestiged the ones that apparently had them.
---
ghost face because i still get exposed when i reveal him
---
I feel it. First day of college for me today, of course they release double blood points. Luckily I don't have class tomorrow.
---
Some Macmillan and Coldwind maps because I’m tired of getting them every other game
---
Depends on how good they are with them. Ive been up against many more good spirits than nurses, but even against a good spirit, you can still enjoy the game and get your BP. A good nurse seems to be on all 4 survivors asses at once and the game is over rather quick
---
Yeah im leaving this shit sub too
---
Seems about right.
---
well i to be honest, it depend on what make you fun or other player fun. what you mean not have good time? like what specially? if you just got juked hard and loop hard, isnt it you learning something like to use new strategy? u should more relax while playing game you know. not getting stress about it
---
You buy Clown for his perks, kind of like Leatherface.
---
Upvote for 16 bit.
---
I feel like it would just be really annoying as survivor to clense like 5 totems just to get ruin but that's just because I play survivor mostly and you could just use thrill of the hunt if you wanted to gaurd it so much.
---
Level 13 Nightmare and level 23 Quinten. I described the game exactly as it works...
---
The same goes for all other BP offerings. Let's say you bring a yellow offering, it will take 75% of your BP score in that category (So in your case that's 6K) and add that to your BP gained.
---
Lerys, Gideons, Hawkins underground.
---
Spirit is the best. Ghostface is fun. Demo is a bit of both.
---
Clicky clicky
---
I may be wrong but I'm pretty sure if you kobe on your last possible attempt then it counts as you going to second phase.
---
I am also confused, is it just because you got autodiadact as a perk?
---
So mobile is the best?
---
I was just 5 off once as Wraith. Got a perfect game with him the next day using no perks or addons. At purple ranks
---
Amen
---
To be honest I used to think killers saying pallet looping is toxic was a myth. Then I stopped playing for like 2 months and got deranked to 13 as survivor and my god the number of times I’ve been face camped while killers swing at my body just because I looped them for a bit too long is insane. 
---
Don’t worry, the only killers who think it’s toxic are the bad ones. The only time looping is toxic is if you do shit like run to the Ironworks window or run to Myers house with Balanced Landing every time the killer chases you.
---
I was doing a daily kid
---
wtf 👀
---
It's also more efficient emblem point-wise to spend 15 seconds on a totem than to spend 15 seconds on a gen
---
It’s not toxic but then don’t get mad when they face  camp you🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Game should be called Bully by daylight. It's an actual joke how they can mock you and still win
---
Adiris: Sumerian for Karen
---
I'm just talking about wait times. My friends and I will spend 20min looking for a single heckin game.
---
You almost made me think this is a concept of a Dying Light DLC
---
Did you really scroll through my posts to find something you could post a snarky comment on after getting butthurt DAYS AFTER you ran out of shit to say in another post? Big difference here is I'm complaining about the state of the servers, which yes, everyone is complaining about, meanwhile you are complaining that the big mean mr. killer didn't allow you to fix a specific gen you wanted. But please, don't let that stop you from being a fucking moron and making another ridiculous comment.
---
Imagine assuming I’m personally offended lmao.
---
What can I say? ;)
---
its ok, dont be stubborn about it. you should know your limit. dont push too hard. it will only hurt you. pray more, eat healthier food, you will exit your depressing phase. dont play game if you not enjoy it. dont force it. you should try plant vs zombie or insane aquarium
---
Well its kinda wierd to facecanp me just cause im playing like your supposed to
---
Freddy is easy S tier, Ghostface is easy A tier or even S if your extremely good at him
---
They wont buff it because low ranksurvivors cry too much
---
Spirit left her soul right there
---
Upvoting this for visibility and everyone else should do the same.
---
Hot damn she can give me the plague anytime she wants
---
Uh...
---
Finally spirit is balanced
---
Love this
---
I saw a Micheal chase a survivor through a window, but after vaulting started to t-pose for a good ten seconds.
---
I came here for comments from sensitive killers clutching their pearls.  
---
Was not disappointed :D
---
I JUST DID THAT TODAY TOO GORLL IM TRYNA GET P350 😭😍❤️
---
Proud of you! 🙏🏻
---
Are you ok?
---
You don’t depip for the killer dcing lol
---
Why did you teabag?
---
Hmm 🤔 why did you teabag to what purpose did the teabagging serve?
---
haha, maybe he got teabagged by survivor &gt; try tunneling and facecamp him &gt; got DS &gt; DCed. i can see the plot here. lol
---
When does the bloodhunt end?
---
Full vid on my channel:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu\_DH\_GgU10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_DH_GgU10)  :)
---
All toxic SWFs I've found had Streamers in it, I try to not judge before playing but when it's 4 cunts talking to eachother at all time each with a high qual toolbox and stuff, it's just annoying and toxic, even more when they tbag and do emotes at all times
---
It's even worse when you are a survivor that gets matched with a SWF trio, the assholes will abandon you so you can get chased by the killer and if only you and one of them survive, they will fo their best to let you die and go for the hatch
---
Looks like shit learn how to Centre things
---
I feel you man, give me more time and I'm sure we'll share the same opinion lol
---
But I will not have won until I’ve defeated you in every parallel universe.
---
Demo
---
Take off the fact that she is broken, she is also very used. I'm 100% positive that most survivors are really bored to play against her at least in EU. I literally see her every 2 games
---
oof they blocked you. ig you better get ice for that burn?
---
It’s adding that make it longer with your setup it will be quite short
---
Part of me kind of wants the Scorpion King. Watching this buff scorpion chase me around sounds pretty terrifying. 
---
Also yes, yes, yes, we need a Brendan Fraser survivor.
---
You’re too kind! 
---
Thanks and glad you like it. (:
---
That’s an amazing idea actually, thanks for this
---
i was so upset i fell into a deep depression and lost all my friends
---
my family disowned me because they couldn’t handle the alcoholic life i’ve taken on
---
i drink at the same bar every night but the regulars all hate me for some reason
---
Oh wow, there was a lot more to it than I remembered.
---
Dude, hell yes. With all the hidden stairways and everything. Make it a Red Forest Map, have the mansion, the "game" room, the barn, the whole works. That would be really cool. 
---
Who would the killer be though? It can't be the grandma, we have the hag already.
---
I would argue that you would need perks that give you alot of map presents so you can have control over most of the map for the duration of the game
---
ifunny.co
---
It's a tragedy 😣
---
His friend would have been killed, but he let the killer down him and used his ds so he had time to crawl out.
---
Oink???
---
I also got hatemail for winning as killer, but also *losing* as killer.
---
The first time I played Huntress, I knew I was going to lose.  They were obviously an organized SWF group.  Still, I tried my best.  Didn't camp, didn't tunnel.
---
When they had completed all the gens, I managed to hook a survivor, and they kinda swarmed the hook.  I downed another as they were unhooking, but they were all just surrounding the hook again trying to lead me away while it's obvious their two friends are nearby.
---
I thought, fine, I'll chase someone even though they're all grouped together nicely.
---
They all get away and then proceed to wait at the exit gate and click flashlights and teabag.  Meh.
---
Then I got multiple PMs from them along the lines of "lol get wrecked tunneling proxy camper."  Like, what the actual fuck?  You fucking won, and you're still being that toxic?  Jesus Christ.  I almost quit the game after a few incidents like that.
---
Turned off PMs so I don't have to deal with that BS.  Yes, I'll miss the good messages between rad players, but those were few and far between compared to the toxic idiotic messages I tended to get.
---
And no.  I never camp, and never tunnel.  I often even let groups go if it was a fruitful and fun game.  Always tend to let the last survivor go.  Even if they were teabagging and flashlight clicking.
---
I think the most toxic players seem to be the players who "only" play one side or the other.  But maybe I'm imagining that.
---
*Muh.*
---
No it doesn’t. I’ve watched people get downed right after using DS. You didn’t answer my question, ah ah!
---
Thought I was the only one lmao
---
That hag be ***w a l k i n***
---
Real reason here: They don't play her because they don't know how. Spirit was also not played on release, everyone was god awkful at her and now she is meta so..give it a few months
---
It helped his friend as it bought him the time to crawl out. Also not just that but if it weren’t for the ds, one of them was going to die.
---
r/OneProtectRestAttack
---
I'd choose Daddy Myers. He may not be as threathening as the others but as soon as people see his ripped body they'll just become paralysed in awe and excitement.
---
Exactly
---
Yall liked my first suggestion pack soo much, I decided to create another one!
---
The version of Freddy we have in the reboot one, but I would kill to have the Robert Englund version. You could do both pre and post burn versions. It’d be dope.
---
1 in 50 in my experience. Killer seems to attract the most desperate and helpless of incels. Survivor is harder and attracts a more altruistic team based type.
---
I think It’s less about that and more about how annoying and toxic the people who say that can sometimes be
---
Be more careful next time! You nearly clipped into the backrooms
---
I get them every now and then. Sometimes they arnt very good.
---
you can grab them as they vault
---
This is really good art
---
Oh it’s def your fault if that’s the case lol. I’m actually good w pig for some reason, I honestly don’t know how😭 but legion is complete dog shit. And cmon man you seriously can’t complain about losing when ur playing w these killers. I get where ur coming from though. I personally love playing leatherface, always have and always will, he’s by far the killer I have the most experience with. But the problem is that he’s unbelievably shitty once u reach even purple rank. So I understand wanting to play certain killers just cuz they’re fun to play as, but you gotta remind yourself that once u reach them high ranks.. they’re just not viable anymore. And the ranking system is fucked up now so it honestly doesn’t matter what rank u are it’s all about luck as of now. But seriously man please main an actual decent killer
---
i cant stop staring at her big toe clipping through the dress at the bottom
---
I don’t see what the devs could do that would not make ppl leave. There is honestly nothing they can do about swf

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

Killer because Survivors would be forced to use No Mither which makes some perks useless or pretty pointless to use in most situations
---
It’s a shame there are no Dustin addons considering the close bond he had with a Demogorgon.
---
I’m sorry, little one.
---
*mori’s rank 20 dwight in front of the hatch*
---
do you? i mean you complaining right in this thread with a little threat. like "if you not give me, i will do this". get it? hahaha
---
How do you get downed after a 5 second stun and not run to a pallet or window? you must be playingat yellow ranks..
---
I usually play with bbq and ruin and the other 2 depends on the killer i'm playing
---
Sucks how mentioning old Enduring always makes people downvote and spam the comments. Had the exact same thing happen with another one of my memes, stay strong OP!
---
ah. That is where we disagree then. Personal opinion is that 80% of games should not be a 4k, that just seems absurd, coming from someone who mainly plays killer. (Mentioned for perspective, not entitlement)
---
I’ve fixed it to say his estate, but it is what I meant
---
Literally locked me in here while I was destroying a shrine--then the killer went afk and we just SAT here.. I'm still here... Why is this a thing?
---
Can't just throw names out there my guy.
---
and I'm dead. my soul has ascended. you may have my upvote lmao.
---
the fact that you waited for both of them so you can get behind them even tho you were injured it's so cute
---
Playing against Ghostface is fun as shit when you’re smashed.
---
^Also ^can ^I ^come
---
Did you post this on twitter?
---
Thoughts on those cases:  killer can grab 1 the rest scatter.  Head on, if one does it, the rest get pushed out.
---
Triumphant GRU with run deliverance, back to sad GRU with everyone steals unhooks from you
---
Nah fuck this. I get that the system ain't perfect and they are trying to fix  it. But this post is bullshit. A level 7 killer feels right to me In this situation. 
---
Like what are you complaining about? 
---
It wasnt a rank 4 nurse?
---
A rank 2 billy? 
---
If you wanna post about a broken matchmaking post a picture about broken matchmaking. 
---
This is just fishing. Its embarrassing.
---

---
They can add an action speed debuff based on how many xSWF there is. It would make it harder for the sweaty players and for the people who just want to play with friends and have fun? Why would an action speed debuff matter to them if they’re just looking to have fun with friends
---
I don’t want to play a killer just because they’re good. I don’t see the point in that. I want to play a killer I like and that I enjoy playing. Problem is, survivors just seem to like being assholes for no reason
---
It doesn't do that.
---
Unlike killers, all Survivors are basically identical in terms of function, so prioritize playing those with perks that you like. Personally, I play a lot of Claudette, because I enjoy the healing focused playstyle her base perks allow. However, once you have unlocked those perks on other characters, you can honestly just play whoever you think looks the coolest (Steve all the way my dudes)
---
You can grab them healthy only when they are doing gens, totems or unhooks. You can only grab them from vaults when they are injured.
---
im removing this post, but before I do I want to say 
---
EREDAR LORD OF THE BURNING LEGIONNNNNNNNNNN
---
The only thing that gets an adrenaline rush from me is hearing the word Adrenaline.
---
What do you mean?
---
Uhm because some killers know how to bite through DS or slug and wait it out, I’m rank 4. Not everyone plays like a yellow rank, seems to be your only argument but honestly you must just play like a yellow rank killer since you’re so booty hurt about DS. Yeah it’s a great perk, but it’s avoidable and if it was OP they would’ve taken it out of the game, instead they nerfed it and made it fair.
---
Wrong. They can be grabbed from gens, unhooks or totems when they are healthy but they need to be injured to grab them from vaults.
---
Lol I can see so many ppl quitting because of that. And because ppl won’t have fun losing every game. That change would hurt the game really bad
---
It has to be a safe hook rescue most people farm even when the killer is camping so it negates a stack.
---
I'm not complaining, i'm simply letting you know( you, the ones that use those broken perks and item) that i will dc if you do.
---
you can grab them off generators and totems and lockers at full health, you can grab them while vaulting only if they're injured
---
Read my post again, I'm getting 3 or 4 WGLF stacks and not getting anything for them.
---
Killers certainly don’t have easy games. It always seems like survivors want easy games where they always wreck the killer. Why can a 4xSWF just jump in and bully every killer besides spirit and nurse? You think that is good game design?
---
Mapple Rook would only help survivors for NOED
---
Next patch:
---
****- The Undetectable status has now been applied to Wraith and Ghostface. 
---
-The Pig's terror radius is now reduced to 24 meters while crouched (previously 0 meters).****
---
lmao ggez dont let the door hit you on the way out
---
This game is a mess right now
---
Thanks I appreciate your understanding! And he was face camping hard in the basement. There was no way around it. :(
---
Ok buddy
---
They can’t it all depends. I highly doubt you lose every time you face a swf. You win some and you lose some it happens and ik it sucks but you move on. If they did that change many ppl would say fuck it and quit game is already a nightmare for solos so that debuff would hurt them as well if they are in a lobby with swf and that means they would prob say fuck it and leave to. We all deal with swf it sucks but in the end we do improve dealing with them and they can’t really do much to them because in a way without swf the game would not be anywhere close to what it is today. Also other killers other than those 2 can survive rank 1 I was a rank 1 Myers for example it’s just a little harder they need to buff the killers not nerf swf
---
yes just like i said, "if you not give me that, i will to this". its okay bro. dont let your pride hold your sadness. just chat me if you need friend to talk about your problem. maybe i can teach u many thing :3
---
Don't flashlight wraiths after midnight.
---
Oh, I stand corrected.  Hard to remember all the weird bullshit that was in the first year or so of the game's life.
---
Don't you put that evil on me.
---
At least he's good for farming bloodpoints.
---
Keep crying  :)
---
And in the post game chat you say "what where you doing while I was being chased for 5 mins?" and they are like "doing gens, what about you noob?"
---
The most wonderful time of the year: when survivor mains won't farm with you because it's boring and squander all the bps
---
I just think the notification that it gives survivors after hitting one skillcheck should be removed. Idk why it notifies them in the first place.
---
The only one insane enough to play dbd with a controller? You are.
---
&gt;survivor is harder and attracts a more altruistically team based type
---
ah yes, I sure do enjoy my great altruistic survivor teammates who farm people on the hook, urban evade around the map, disconnect or immediately kill themselves on the hook after being downed and also can’t last in a chase for more than 10 seconds.
---
I am a solo survivor and I agree that it would fuck us over. Maybe I’m just kind of tilted that a 4 man SWF can bully and destroy most killers in the game. SWF is currently a terrible game design that harms killers AND solo survivors
---
Uhm.
---
Yes. The person in the basement becomes a noble sacrifice and you gen rush the shit out of the facecamper. Or instead of going for the person in the basement, they should have gone for you instead. 
---
Or if you’re all unhooked, heal up and rush the basement as a team. Depending on what killer it is, he can’t hit all of you. But there are options so that this kind of thing doesn’t happen.
---
and chests
---
only injured
---
pfft I already have him P3lvl50 with all perks on him. but great job tho!
---
The Huntress is now Undetectable while winding up a hatchet. 
---
The Pig's Reverse Bear Traps may now be unlocked by Key items.
---
Except lobby dodging isn't a bannable offense nor is it a waste of offerings/add-ons lol
---
And then you get an infinite loading screen.
---
I agree something is wrong. My wife loads into lobby while I stay on the invite screen. It’s been happening since the new killer dropped for me.
---
In the end the game would not be as popular without them hell its thanks to swf why this game has so many license killers and etc when this game first came out it did not have many ppl and lobby dodging cause ppl just wanted to play with friends. In the end swf is strong but you can survive with other killers it’s just harder they just need to find a way to buff them. Ik I was a rank 1 Myers shit was hard but I managed
---
As survivor? I don’t think it matters.
---
It's not fair and not counterable, you can run into a locker with it and killer is forced to take the stun. That stun can cause the killer to lose the game, if you are at the red ranks you would know this. Leaving them on the ground is the only thing you can do, do you not realize it? Going for different hooks EVERY TIME, will make you lose since they can sit 3 minutes on the hook and you have to find someone else which is not a guaranteed thing. But if you find someone else, he can loop you for more than the time it takes for a gen to be completed. Math is not an opinion, m1 killers don't have a single chance against a team of survivors that is at least decent at the game
---
does Fuming Mixtape offer extra Regression or whats the point?
---
At least you're honest about it lol. Sometimes people act like asses and deserve the punishment, other times the killer is having a bad day and just wants someone to take it out on. But often they just like to be dicks. Nothing wrong with that, without the dick to run from the survs don't have a job :P
---
A actual good buff to fuming mix tape
---
Everytime i use a cake the connection gets lost.
---
I’ve been getting all my stacks.
---
I believe it to be a different timeline/universe thing. My proof? Bill. In the world of Left 4 Dead, literally the *entire world* is covered in zombies. Feng Min was part of a competitive esports team, which was probably set at around the same time period as Left 4 Dead, but there were no zombies in that universe. There’s also the fact that different characters from different time periods can interact with each other. In one of Benedict Baker’s journal entries, he describes seeing the character Nea at some point. With Baker being trapped in the realm of the Entity at around 1896, there is no way that this world that the Entity has made is in any way shape or form dependent on year it is on Earth. There’s also the fact that Laurie Strode is still her young self in the Realm, but then the canon Halloween 2018 happens. I’d assume that the Laurie trapped in the Realm is a Laurie from a different timeline than that of the timeline that Halloween 2018 takes place in. Basically, to sum this all up, this is a video game, bottom text
---
You're right, it's more like 70% sweaty tryhards, 20% actually good killers, 9% baby killers who are honestly fucking trying, and 1% surv mains just doing dailys
---
I'll walk the rest of the way and wait
---
Oink????
---
This is stunning! pun intended!
---
"Demogorgon is strong" now that was a good joke partner
---
honestly, I think they need to stop ratting on killer perks. is someone exposed from NOED or Devour Hope? Pay attention and notice when someone gets downed (not grabbed) in one hit from a 2 hit killer.  
---
huntress lullaby? boy, that skill check didn't give much notice. 
---
can't see where your friends are hooked? holy cow, are they rocking seal?  
---
smart survivors won't be inconvenienced much, and new players will pick that up fast, and it will encourage situational awareness.
---
It’s because it’s ***w e i r d*** and cool. It’s fun to speculate things about this game imo
---
🥺🥺 nobody’s getting basement hooked on my watch!
---
I had one match with 3x bps + envelope today. Someone dc'd during loading screen :((
---
at least you will hit alot ( since they usually body blocking and healing ). if not, then u should can chase them without trap ( yes taking longer time ). swf should be match with higher ranking killer. buff only make not SWF hurt
---
Yeah, I think something got massively bugged by that matchmaking update they did.
---
Yeah the game trailer is scary I felt really uneasy the first time I seen it
---
Waste a bunch of time? Takes survs like 20 seconds to get a new game. Killers take like 5 minutes lol. It's often survs will just all DC and send the killer back to the lobby to wait and all 4 will be back in a lobby and a game by the count of 20
---
K thanks. Also GREAT CHRIST I got so many downvoted for asking a fucking question.

Every match ends with "host disconnected" and has to load for like 30 seconds, and then my player XP doesn't update

Having the same problem, playing on PS4 also.

I've had this happen a few times myself, I get "Do co-operative actions for 180 seconds". The both changed to, like, ghostface and legion ones. I think the system is having a bug with them, others have had it as well. I'm sure that it will be fixed soon enough.
---
Definitely not Legion cuz I personally don’t think he’s fun(please don’t bombard me with downvotes) out of Ghostface and Demo... maybe Demo, they are both really fun but I just think Demo is a little more satisfying, especially if you’ve seen the show. ( again, please don’t bury me in downvotes )
---
Who is the leader?
---
so EDGY :( . i mean , if you have low skill play, doesnt mean its all wrong. just increase your skillplay. i mean DS only 60s and you said its so powerfull. damn idk how bad your skill play. are you a slave by experience? haha
---
Ye buddy
---
He wants the flashlight
---
You know why? Because old Enduring was awesome and some people don't like being reminded of how awesome it was.
---
The thing is there are unfortunately a lot of scumbag people that would fake it and kill everyone lol. I would love the idea though but it'd get abused I think.
---
She’s just trying to steal your beans by intimidation
---
but...but... I was the killer....
---
I was kinda joking on how he is the spookiest, for me without a doubt would be hag. I just call him that because of what he wears. Also he’s kinda like an insecure Myers with the way he stalks
---
yep so basically if she decides to tunnel you u are a dead man.
---
I will do that but if the survivor was doing nothing all game or running the killer to me I’ll struggle my ass off
---
Moving with a newborn baby... :-(
---
Won’t be able to take advantage of his blood hunt at all.

He’s a wonderful, beautiful boy. And he loves watching Dead by Daylight... but he never likes to give daddy time to play.

Someone offer a bloody party streamer for me!

---
I'm playing in EU and I got 4 games in a row a spirit (my rank was 3-4 at the time) and then it got me so mad I wanted to go to reddit
---
Well that's exactly what I mean. You don't need the cursed notification as an experienced survivor once you know what to look for. Huntress lullaby and ruin as far as I know are the only ones that give you this and it's pretty obvious already when you're starting to feel the respective perks as a surv
---
Hell yeah, also sorry what does Jefes mean? I know very little about Evil Dead
---
I've played her myself she is pretty easy if u get used to it after a 5 games its only listening and easy guessing thats it
---
Honestly I would say the main reason people do it is cause they figure since they're dead they'll let you die too. It's super uncool of people to do.
---
The Entity planned on nabbing her father, but her rage was great enough that it chose her instead.
---
wow you guys are getting farmers? all I get (PC, rank 2) are slugging nurses and spirits. tryhard killers x-x
---
Micheal is a fun killer to play, so is the new demigorgon
---
I'm seeing this as I'm waiting to find a lobby as Legion.
---
Weird. Also yeah lobbies have been weird, I'm wondering if they brought back bugged 3-man lobbies.

Hey! I'm using a controller on my pc as well. I play EVERY other game on my kb and mouse, but playing this game with a controller just feels right! So, nice to find another! :D

Bull. Shit. My roommate got so much salt for doing well that I had her turn messages on friend only. Gamers in general can't take a loss, but this community is next level salty.
---
yeah and thats why you need tor un with her long distances, but there she has the overhand cause if u are injured ur bleeding and making noises ( if you dont play iron will) so she can basically watch the floor or use her headset to track you down + if u run she sees the scratchmarks. there is not really a way to play against her you cant predict everything she does but she can predict what u do.
---
*cries in console*
---
“Jefe” is Spanish for chief. In Ash vs Evil Dead, Pablo (who looks up to Ash as the mentor/leader of their little Deadite-fighting group) calls him that pretty often.
---
Yep that happens to me as well
---
Ya last night I had to do coop actions for 180 seconds, then went to check its progress and it was a doctor one lol
---
BNP does only 25% of a gen lol that’s not a tryhard add on
---
i wonder, where did 4th picture come from. i want to see the video lol
---
Yeah I like Myers, as well as Demo, both really fun killers, but I am not sure if their teachables are that great. So the question is, go for the killers that I probably won´t play as much for their great teachables, or go for Myers and Demo for their solid-but-not-amazing perks...
---
killers aren't even farming for me. nothing but slugging nurses and spirits (even if everyone uses a streamer) :(

Hey!!! As a Dwight main, ...
---
...
---
Yeah, okay...
---
I lean forward as I lunge as killer
---
Swf isn't a problem, just run discordance and nurses calling
---
And most importantly: farm
---
But if they missed their DS the person on the ground still would have made it out...
---
Lol, good one.
---
But I gotta disagree gameplay-wise. I believe it's one of those "in the wrong hands" situations.
---
I mean, I suck at playing Clown, but it doesn't mean everyone else does.
---
It depends on the type of player you are. Me, I'm more of playing for fun and occasionally taking it seriously when the time calls for it. The reason why I like playing fun killers like Pig, Micheal, GhostFace, and sometimes Demigorgon.

It's just Reddit points. Make a funny somewhere and you'll get back to it

A) Spend 200 USD to buy a fancy streaming machine to play DbD
---
Or 
---
B) Spend 20 bucks to play DbD on the portable device you already own?
---
I mean, seriously.
---
I had a game earlier I was trying to play like normal and 2 of the other survivors actually were body blocking me so the killer could catch me.
---
This makes Meyers look like such a psycho animal when in reality he is a tame killer.. We better be seeing Meyes with a chainsaw next Halloween film.
---
What?
---
I got lucky after that doctor match. Had the clown of Christmas spirit right afterwards with a literal Santa outfit on. Wanted to farm with us even though none of us were expecting it. Real cool guy everyone left happy and maxed out. That was a 275k bp match.
---
Well I don´t have any serious ranked goals in this game, so I might probably go for Demo or Myers (or Hag sounds fun too)...I already have the S-Tier perks from Shrine anyway. Thanks!
---
They're just saying Legion isn't the only killer that's rather normal. Arguably ghostface is even more normal since Legion is multiple people in one.
---
No problem. Happy hunting
---
Open handed, kindred, bond, left behind because I'm a solo player
---
That seems fun, but it would have to be like super super super rare.
---
Yeah I'm basically getting the same amount of BP as normal, just with the occasional BPS being thrown out.
---
Guess I could either shelve WGLF or try and be the first or second to die.
---
judging from your username and my new main’s average sacrifices we might be kicking hard ass
---
I think they who use it wrong got it messed up with:"intended game mechanic"

I usually go for Deliverance, Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time and any of the following as a 4th perk. We'll Make It, We're Going to Live Forever, Adrenaline or Self Care.

thanks for the link! I'll experimenting with the add ons a bit more :)

Yeah, really disgusting. Playing survivor was a terrible experience in this event. 
---
Then I tried playing Wraith. Got quite a lot of SWFs exploiting the fact that he isn´t a great killer and being toxic. 
---
Said fuck it, switched to Spirit. Lol, easy games since then, easy BPs.
---
There's also alot of people who play the game who don't use reddit so if you simulatinously mash ready in the lobby people are gonna find it annoying
---
Not sure if it’s true, but I’ve heard the Xbox community is the smallest of the 3 main platforms

Huntress is no longer, this is the only Mommy now

Killer lobbies will take forever during this event over the weekend. Since you get more BP as killer, more people will try to play as them. That’s why I’ve pretty much just committed to a survivor farming build as I can get more done than just waiting for a killer lobby.
---
I died on first hook because they were all hiding in lockers for the entire time I was hooked. The killer was rank 19 too!
---
 I was accused of hacking by a rank 10 survivor, I got super lucky on some locker check and snatched him right up. My killer rank is stuck between 16-15 so having someone who should know better accuse me of cheating just made my day.
---
lol, a cream of the crop Nurse player makes most PC players quit out of frustration.
---
Everything seems fine to me. All my stacks are working, I'm leveling up, etc.
---
Omg a girl gamer
---
Can you explain these bloodhunt rules to a new player?
---
It's also not fun having someone intentionally let you find them just so they can DS you. It balances out.
---
You are bad at baiting me dude
---
Nah he's right.  Most people just use it as a BS excuse.
---
Demo is the strongest of the 3, but ghostface is also pretty decent. Pretty much anything that isn’t legion is a good buy
---
REPOST ALERT
---
😍😍😍
---
play normal or farm, I would assume is what OP meant. but farming is lame
---
well just the teachable are nice because they are pink offerings so they arent exactly common nuff to get them often
---
I dont know if this was patched but dying light would crash the match after a couple hooks
---
You're drawing a lot of conclusions, homie.  Chill.
---
Hitting skill checks even when she has the lullaby maxed is pretty easy.  I don't think I've ever missed one.
---
Have you played Huntress much?  By the time Lullaby would have reached 5, most totems are cleansed by then.
---
Combined with ruin, though, I can see that being a huge pain in the butt.  But again, it's usually cleansed before it becomes a hindrance.
---
Some of them are trying even harder than usual cause they hope to fuck the survs out of their meager BP as best they can and still cash in on them sweet sweet BPS and Gateaus. I'm losing my shit watching all these tryhards get DC's before first hook losing stacks cause survs can just go to the next game in 10 seconds and they gotta wait at least 5 minutes lol.
---
Is it me or since the bloodhunt started, matchmaking has been completely broken? It seems that it has reverted to pre-patch - I am a green rank killer, anywhere between rank 12-10 at any one time. The last 6 games in a row I've played, I've been matched with mostly purple ranks and **at least one red rank.** Behavior, I bought the game 3 weeks ago, give me a fucking break, *stop matching me against people with thousands of hours.*
---
Yeah that’s what I’m thinking, would be sad I’ve got over 40 days played on it :(

Sprint Burst + Vigil for the free chase escape every 32 seconds, plus it helps with any other of my teams exhaustions. Spine Chill so I have a little Killer knowledge, and Iron Will. Because Iron Will.
---
I'm following you. You're now my bff
---
Wow, he did what he's supposed to do. What a total asshole.
---
I used to be a survivor main but I find it so boring now because I’m in yellow ranks from not playing a lot and rank reset, I find I just get teammates who don’t know how to play the game lol
---
I find the bugged shadow people that randomly spawn in game after sacrificing someone genuinely creepy.
---
I would love some sort of lore or spook-based events like that more.
---
I started with Freddy (he had the most offerings to burn) and would dump the BP into another killer (ex: clown) until I ran out of offerings or clown eventually had decent perks I could run him. Rinse and repeat. Basically it's a good weekend to play your weaker killers/survivors to get as many to level 40 as you can.
---
okie dokie, I was gonna play normal anyway because like you said, farming is really lame.
---
This man gets it
---
Ivy: (Throws Toolbox)
---
The Huntress: *(CONFUSED SCREAMING)*
---
I should have edited one in 😅
---
At least give us add ins for speed
---
It won’t help all the time but idk what kind of godly sight you have that allows you to see hiding survivors all the time.
---
Dh, we'll make it, bt, and sc. Good all around build, great for pips also.
---
Are y’all forgetting about ghostface
---
10/10 would wear this ❤️
---
Why do you think it’s a bad idea?
---
Well how’d you die to a rank 19...
---
"wow dude you killed our swf, you're so shit" Every SWF group ever.
---
I have. It's visible in the post-match screen. I don't know if you actually keep the "Lost" pip or if it's a visual glitch, but it does seem like it remains lost even when you return to the main menu.
---
Yeah and so do I, I've been playing for ~2 years now and since the nerf on ds it hasn't been OP like it was before.
---
Except hes not. You can literally "lag switch" by starting a download through steam/xbox/psn mid match. All it requires is a trigger to hog the bandwidth. HUGE in StarCraft:Brood War days.
---
It’s definitely a visual glitch cause I’ve never lost a pip over a killer dc
---
It's the most efficient way to get bloodpoints and kill survivors, at least the killers don't have a built-in Mori. ;)
---
On a serious note, yes, the developers might need to add more creative ways to kill survivors, but i think the gen rush is more important.
---
Plunderer's, Dead Hard, DS, and WGLF. I like looting and getting extra points for saves and protection hits. The other 2 respectively are for extending loops and to prevent getting tunneled.
---
I don't know Q-Q I spent like an hour on it. This truly tragic.
---
Gotta remember which Developers we're talking about here.
---
I will buy the DLC and play Brendan and point out all my fellow survs and fast vault constantly if you all just promise to mori me every fucking time. God I hate that guy XD
---
If the survivor isn't being toxic, and appears to be a poor solo, I sometimes give hatch.
---
Guaranteed hatch if the rest of their team was potatoes.
---
God, the grind to unlock teachable BBQ is rough. My Bubba is only level 24 and it feels harder and harder to get him to the next level. But I really want BBQ to become teachable within the next day or two so killers I actually like to play can run it for the Blood Hunt.
---
Maybe they could do a fictional documentary on Hag
---
Dude what are you even talking about now?  Of course it's usually cleansed before it becomes a problem.  That  is the whole point of this post.  Lullaby is a pretty bad perk because it's a hex the survivors know about from the first skill check and the risk of losing it is there.  The entire point OP makes with this thread is removing this from being a hex perk meaning there is no removing it.  If the killer gets hooks the killer gets Lullaby tokens.  No removing it.  That would not be balanced.  You even going to that basically made my point for me so I'm confused on why you took it there.  You may have not missed skillchecks from Lullaby ever (you're just a God I guess) but the average survivor would be fucked against 5 tokens of Lullaby without a means to remove it.  It's a hex because the devs knew the effect was strong and the survivors needed a counter option to remove it.  High risk high reward.
---
If the team is extremely altruistic in the end game, you can go from no kills to 3 or 4 kills easily.
---
Amanda's letter + Mori
---
You could, yes.
---
Oh, interesting yeah I think it could be cool
---
I had the timer not show progress and kill my teammate lol
---
i used it as a joke (my friends do that) and it blinded way faster, i would know i do have 1700 hrs and can consistantly hit flashlights
---
Wait what people like you exist?
---
I'm pretty sure it's a normal gen kick, with his other leg glitching out? Could very easily be wrong, though.
---
That one’s a pain. (:
---
I feel this so hard.  On a spiritual level.
---
Imagine being 13 and trying to talk trash to somebody rofl little boy
---
What are your pc specs
---
My point was how are they gonna find out about the universal code bhvr arnt gonna promote it on the news feed it isn't the intention behind the game :/
---
A very nice horror btw
---
I don’t get it, why use a survivor pudding if you’re try harding the double bloodpoint event with ending the game so quickly, with a survivor dc. Unless your teammates were just a mess.
---
everyone's getting sweaty tonight.  They aren't even doing it right.  Look at that killer score.  Let's not even mention the 20 min killer queues...for 26k points?  No thanks.
---
imagine stalking my account 
---
fucking creep
---
Even with traps everywhere as hag teleporting to survivors you still can’t hit survivors when this happens. Hope it gets fixed.
---
Holy fuck. Can we please get this as a skin??
---
YES!!!!!! Followed back!
---
How demo his lunge needs a bigger hit box I think or is it good ( I don't have him) and his ability can be used only once and that's it for it pretty much cuz if he's non a chase someone closes the portal
---
viewing information available to the public is not stalking but I get it, your 13 and don't really understand anything and you aren't even old enough to play this game LOL
---
You should just be able to connect your controller and use it
---
Borrowed Time, Dead Hard, Unbreakable and Slippery Meat. I like helping others but 90% of the time I have to help myself.
---
It’s so bad, I wish this video was edited but it isn’t, I’m amazed I hit anything.
---
How does one get that "ghost face portrait" thing?
---
Edit:spelling mistake
---
Why didn’t you leave in the first place?
---
old enough? think im more mature than you lmaoo
---
Niice
---
**say sike right now**
---
I bet you face camp as bubba
---
Exactly, first guy dc'd on a gen his internet mustve gone out. He catches me, hooks near a gen, about to get unhooked, then he teleports and kills the guy that was supposed to unhook me.
---
Remember the times when killer shack had 2 windows instead of 2 doors? I remember. I don't want to remember though, those were really dark times....
---
^ This.
---
New bug
---
What woosh?
---
I got the joke.
---
My response is a joke back where I start to form a rebuttal, but then admit I’ve got nothing and he’s right.
---
So woosh to you, sir. Woosh to you.
---
Happened to me yesterday. As well as the timer being frozen.
---
“I died to a good spirit! 😭”
---
Do you run around in the beginning ?
---
Mine is every survivor team gen rushing like mad while im over here with my newly prestiged demo
---
How... do people play like this
---
What rank are you normally?
---
I actually laughed out loud
---
God that looks like shit. Unfortunately I had to quit playing on my Xbox (Elite) as the game would literally shut my xbox down 3/5 times just on the start up loading screen. And when it did load I wasn't very appreciative of the F-16 trying to escape from within the Xbox. Weird how NO other game causes these issue's. Hopefully one day I can afford a decent PC and play the game where its properly supported.
---
She is about as good as mikey. However she is really boring to play cause even with 1 hit downs you are literally only m1. Other killers are just more fun.
---
What’s your social security number?
---
There needs to be an indicator of who is in a swf group so killers can dodge lobbies, I’d rather dodge lobbies than get bullied and not have any fun.
---
we live in a society
---
I messaged all the survivors, and apologised, I left soon after this I couldn’t take it anymore.
