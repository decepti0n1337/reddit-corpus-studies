Hag would be terrible.  Her food is so red I could mistake it for still being alive
---
---
---
Not even funny tbh. Kinda wanna petition tier lists.
---
Myers is one of the killers I actually enjoy playing against because he is one of a few that genuinely jump scare me. Him and the spirit.
---

---
I'm expecting ghostface to be another one that joins them in the jump scare factor.
---
I never ran killer til i had mine at 34 so he could be a legit rank 19.
---
Well, idk if he could or not
---
I think hundreds would be higher because she hunts and cooks food ..... and people but still most of it is animal meat
---
Fair enough! I mostly just meant if you‚Äôre having to level up other Killers to get teachables for the build or anything :) Good luck with him!
---
Deerstalker, overcharge, the trapper perk (something presence) and distressing
---
Spirit is a very good killer, fun to play as. Her teachable perks are good too. 
---
I'd recommend that one c:
---
yeah, a disappearing sword is SO boring
---
Should you have posted that:
---
No---&gt;‚óê&lt;---No but in white
---
Thats.. really sad lol
---
Thanks for the feedback! I might try the second build, tho the late game Freddy sounds fun, despite hating noed haha
---
Make the fence the killer and the ball the pallet and this is me every time
---
Nobody said the same couldn‚Äôt be said about killers. It‚Äôs the fact that you had to post it as if this guy making a meme about what he experienced is an attack on your character
---
spirit seems to be the new DC killer since legion is a little better to handle.
---
Freddy and nurse are in a similar boat. They are hard to learn, and strong once learned (nurse =mechanical, Freddy=strategy). Somehow everyone is willing to learn one and not the other.
---
Freddy does need a rework of sorts, but only because he's a pain to go against as survivor.
---
the big difference was me sleeping him after 10 secs
---
Yeah I know the sleep is a major detriment, didn‚Äôt think about that
---
I‚Äôd kill to play this version
---
 That's fair, but I wanted to use him because he is the one we got in DBD
---
Honestly, I can't tell if you're making fun of me or the guy I'm making fun of.
---
Regardless, Billy needs to be able to toss his 2nd chainsaw, then he'll be mid tier.
---
You‚Äôre dense af
---
Maybe when &gt;!Ghostface!&lt; comes out
---
Those cosmetics are always there unless BHVR pulls them...Battle Passes are timed and have you grind out or pay out to advance it to the stuff you want. Long as you have a job...you can always pick a day/week to buy something and no,predatory tactic with Fear Of Missing Out FOMO where you pay to make SURE you get those tantalizing rewards at the end of the Pass...
---
Here's a video of me bullying a poor defenseless bing bong boi who just wanted one friend to stay for his basement sleepover party, please upvote.
---
Like fucking hell mate, you're pure distilled concentrated evil.
---
it can help with spirit as sound right now is buggy. you think they are in front of you and you come out to swing and nope they were on the other side of a small wall.
---
And I thought freddy had an ugly face.
---
Didn't know they gave huntress a lazer pointer.
---
Not like I'm complaining or anything.
---
No worries, I got everyone basically maxed :D lots of hours as a survivor haha
---
Was playing Bubba for a chainsaw quest and got shit on by a survivor because he got hooked during EGC and then farmed off, and DCed on hook. Dropped off such great one liners as "Bubba only takes 5% brainpower to play" and other fun stuff. I told him I had fun playing with them, they wrecked me, and I sincerely wished him a nice night to which he replied "The feeling's not mutual." :( I just don't understand taking a game so seriously that you have to be a raging doucher.
---
Ohhh, okay! I've never actually gone up against him as a survivor, only played him as the killer...
---
Congrats, nice job! :D
---
Not quite tbagging but trapper can spam trap setting on a survivor
---
I mean, put aside the entire diddling children parts (which is honestly something you should never put aside, but just for the sake of argument), the Creeper isn't all that interesting a killer.
---
Honestly endgame is the money maker. 
---
 Bbq or nurses calling to find.
---
REMEMBER me to save time
---
Blood WARDEN to make butt dancers suffer 
---
Then throw some noed on there for extra salt from said butt dancers. 
---
The perfect build combo' d with a nice purple block and kerosene can and beautiful and zesty ebony to top off the dish or maybe just a black box with purple block to get those REMEMBER me stacks in quickly. This dish is sure to have your guests full and extremely unhappy giving you plenty of 4 mans and bloodpoints
---
I have legacy... only got 1 complete set though. Guess.
---
The licensed ones
---
Rage, yea
---
Deerstalker is useless with him.
---
Bad sportsmanship or bad connection. Hard to tell which sometimes.
---
I did the math and wake up with resilience, spine chill, and leader adds up to about a 22% increase.
---
So who's gonna report this?  i gotta go to work
---
In my opinion the best plan would be to get all of the teachable perks that you want first. 
---
After that, choose 1 character (be it either killer or survivor, tho you can take 1 of both if you want) and get all the perks that you like/want on them. 
---
Then play that one/two characters and use them to get points with which you'll prestiege your Pig/Megan.
---
Eh nvm, I just got nurse's from shrine, and I actually DO have whispers. Can barbq be replaced with noed?
---
I knew the DC was coming but it was still delicious. 
---
Also side note, the Wraith getting chased by your other 3 teammates looked hilarious.
---
i am confused by everything in this sentence
---
Season of the Witch was the best ......
---
i got it months ago ;_; congratulate meeee
---
i also got 100% trophies for all dlcs and such
---
peeps gots ta use da bathroom
---
Use jigsaw piece offerings lol
---
My tip is use BBQ and chili. I dont have him myself but I got the killer perk last time it showed up in the shrine so I'm good.
---
Technically enough to be the difference between life and death, adrenaline would probably be good to get to the gate earlier in place of resilience
---
I feel sorry for you then *nods head*üíÄüíú
---
Happy cake day btw
---
RNGesus is moody sometimes :c
---
Anyone else do this on purpose?
---
Why play a game you‚Äôre not having fun in?
---
Highly doubtful
---
Why leave and fuck your whole team ?
---
Ok, sounds like I must try this hahaha. I think it will be epicly fun! I just spend a million into him and got more of the standard meta perks, but I‚Äôll def give this a go tho :)
---
If the first box doesn't get my trap off, then I make the hard read and beeline for the box that is the farthest away.  So far that strategy has paid off the past couple of pig games.
---
Bruh it sucks going up against him but playing him would be OP
---
ngl I was [laughing my ass off](https://youtu.be/66I78hXXwvk)  when I saw all them behind me and the DC was the cherry on top
---
I can't wait for dedicated servers &lt;3 Hopefully that fixes a lot of issues cause the dcs have gotten so much worse than before especially in lower ranks where they don't have as much as a punishment for dc
---
and 40% X 3 unhook attempts at the least are good odds.
---
I‚Äôll always upvote a good Huntress snipe. Nice one.
---
This is how i feel about every battlepass
---
Jendenise... yikes
---
Oh boy. I'm done replying. I will sound like a broken record if I try to continue this.
---
It‚Äôs not a need at all, hex‚Äôs don‚Äôt need to be stronger
---
I 100% read that wrong. 
---
You‚Äôre right. Not like I can retract my statement.
---
100% agree
---
Booooi that‚Äôs when I pull out my tent and get to camping
---
Unrelated but this is exactly my friends in smash
---
Try playing at rank 6-8 without ruin XD the ignorance in your statement right there tells me your a survivor main
---
I totally agree, just playing devil's advocate here and addressing the issue. 
---
It's still a matter of how much you can slow Survivors down, not remotely how much you can halt them in their tracks. Because they will always have more momentum than you and more  trump Cards than you. Killers are also condemned for their tactics no matter how sound they might actually be.
---
I think the endgame build for him is too gimmicky to be viable. I like to run BBQ/Ruin/Sloppy/M&amp;A.
---
I understand your point is toolbox balance im just saying you cant balance a game around those who just play for fun and dont use perks and methods to their advantage.
---
Honestly the only advice I have is to stay near the hooks, then you will maybe be able to use his chainsaw to catch at least 1 person.
---
Yeah it is. I really do like that I can see the auras of the characters who are in the dream world. It's pretty funny as well when a survivor is obviously going up against Freddy for the first time as well
---
I play hag at red ranks without ruin since I use devour hope. I never have more than one gen done before someone is hooked
---
Yeah that's the unfortunate part of having four sets of eyes watching you every match.  I main killer so I know how bad it gets but you gotta let that shit roll off or just leave before chat pops up.
---
Doubtful
---
His song just plays while in radius, and you can't tell where or how close. Getting out is partly Rng dependent. And Freddy is the worse one gen situation to go against. There's just not much counter play, and whatever counterplay there is can be altered greatly based on add-ons. Do you keep working on the gens once you start the transition hoping to get a skill check? How long? If he has add-ons he can just grab you.
---
And also, playing as Freddy, there are certain situations you can get in that'll guarantee you a win, which I can't say for other killers.
---
Also fun fact about his lullaby, since you can't tell where Freddy is. As Freddy, after hooking someone, you can go pretty far from the hook, and people will think you're face camping them.
---
Sorry this is the best fucking thing I‚Äôve ever seen on this idiot subreddit
---
How do you get bloody items? Is it from prestiging?
---
It's called knowing how to quickly end a chase or when to give up and go for someone else. The only time I have a bit of trouble is immersed survivors, but they cant do gens if they're hiding all the time
---
When a player unhooks themselves without Deliverance is generally the accepted term. Coined by Monto maybe? Idk. But statistically it‚Äôs a 4% success rate so that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a big deal when it happens.
---
His power is pretty weak.
---
Way to make me feel special, haha.
---
Save the Best For Last strikes hard once again.
---
Hey gamers üòéMilf Hunte- I mean, Crusader Kakyoin here to debunk this slanderous rumor. Again.
---
No. **No one can deflect the emerald splash.** This is doctored footage, probably made by Jotaro because he‚Äôs mad I‚Äôm banging his mom-
---
I mean, mad because hes a rank 20 killer. Did you know his grandpa is a bigger gamer than him lmao!!! üòÇ 
---
Peace out gamers!
---
I get that completely. Like if you want to use a flashlight, go ahead. It's in the game for a reason. Blind me at the pallet. Attempt a flashlight save. They're parts of the game. But having a toxic group teabagging with them and giving you no chance is the survivor equivalent of facecamping as bubba
---
Leatherface for BBQ &gt; Hag for Ruin &gt; Anything else
---
You doubt me? I‚Äôm a level 20 killer with maxed out noed and almost maxed the rest of my perks.
---
Every now and then I‚Äôll run my hex build. Devour Hope, Ruin, Thrill of the Hunt, Third Seal. My favorite one by far is Third Seal. Watching people get one hooked because nobody knows where they are is my favorite.
---
Well aren't you just a wonderful person?
---
Chucky. And I don‚Äôt wanna hear anyone say it wouldn‚Äôt work cuz he‚Äôs to small and he can‚Äôt pick ppl up have some imagination people!
---
If you really don't have anything better, then yeah.
---
They started around the same time too.
---
Lol ruin is a must that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs one of the most used perks the statistics prove it‚Äôs a must otherwise people wouldn‚Äôt be using it as much as they are

People always say xenos wont work but we seriously need a alien.

I usually try to pay attention to the aura of the gate, tho I agree it is a nice convenience.

I feel like the opening speed could use a buff, it's just so negligible.
---
this rin, this doc and this leatherface are so cuuuuuute &lt;3
---
They should also ban people that make a picture and call it a meme without any editing
---
This game is a crutch.
---
who never did that
---
An alien would be amazing. A predator would actually kinda work, but seeing as they're currently making a Predator online survival horror game, I doubt that'll happen.
---
I'm actually thinking about what kind of aliens would work, now, but I can't think of much.
---
I diiiiid have a suggestion that had decent approval to make it more appealing and fit more synergy in his perks :\^)
---
If you'd like to skim through my dusty google doc. I like getting some positive discussion going especially about perks. There's a reason many of us stick to a handful of perks- because the others are so bad, even in the situation where they're supposed to be good!

I had a Freddy the other day that didn't hook a single person.  I'm not sure he even hit anyone.  When the match ended I said "they really need to buff Freddy" because I didn't want him to feel bad.  But his reply was "no I'm just garbage" or something to that effect.  I felt really bad for the guy.

* Platform: PC
---
* Type: Ingame bug
---
* Description: Wraith still has to wait for his bell-stowing animation after canceling his cloak before he can attack. This was meant to be changed in the last mid-chapter update, but it isn't working ingame.
---
* Steps to reproduce:
---
1. Play Wraith, and be uncloaked.
---
2. Hold the cloak button until the bar is almost full, then release it.
---
3. Attempt to attack immediately after releasing the cloak button.
---
* Expected result: Wraith immediately end the bell-stowing animation, and attacks.
---
* Actual result: Wraith cannot attack until the bell-stowing animation ends a few moments after he cancels cloaking
---
* Reproduction Rate: 100%
---
A Xenomorph cuz they would be a great addition, and maybe if we're lucky we could get a space ship map.
---
Warms my heart.
---
The way I play him is to have something for endgame but the real deal is to never pet them finish all gens. I run bbq ruin and another gen perk like huntresses lullaby or thantaphobia. From there I just gen patrol.
---
If I knew it. I wouldn‚Äôt have stated it.  And beside a few toxic people here. A lot of people actually agree with me surprisingly. If people would realise that it‚Äôs a team game and not to sabotage the other player.  Then I wouldn‚Äôt need to think of ideas like these.
---
it has saved my ass more than once. it's situational as hell but when it saves you, you become eternally grateful
---
I'm glad everyone can agree with Plague. She basically doesn't have an animation at all...
---
A true power move is blocking the hatch so they have to do the gens, then closing the hatch AND opening one of the gates while bodyblocking the switch of the 2nd one.
---
All points are yours! :D
---
**TLDR; Don't recycle daily rituals until you collect today's from the main menu**
---
**Platform: PC / Type of Bug: Menu**
---
Found a bug today on PC. I was waiting in a lobby and realized the daily reset had gone through. I was unable to complete yesterday's daily ritual because it required me to mori a survivor with a level 1 killer. I decided to reset this literally impossible daily ritual. However, because I did so before collecting my 2nd ritual I was unable to get the ritual for today from the main menu. I even tried completely leaving and resetting DBD but still only have the ritual I got from recycling the first one. It seems like the game read that I got a new ritual today already because of the one I recycled and because of that it didn't give me the 2nd ritual I should've received today. I finally joined the DBD community last month so I'm doing 3 years worth of catching up. Really need those extra blood points. I contacted DBD support through steam reporting the bug so hopefully they can fix it. Until then just make sure you collect your ritual for the day before recycling.
---
beautiful theme
---
A specific person told me that the only reason they are Rank 1 nurse and get 4Ks is because survivors don't know how to use pallets.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Mind you they routinely 4K and had posted a very whiny 1k End Game Screenshot where 3 had insta heals and MoM claiming it was a sub 5 minute game.  The one survivor that died had the lowest score of 15.5k....  
---
But the game is hard for killers.
---
but sometimes he doesnt bing bong
---
he just: 
---
you know
---
He always Bing Bongs. There is no question about it.
---
Aliens would work. They can crawl walls and ceilings so meat plant and lerys would be so good. The mechanics would need to change and I said this in other threads but I'd be willing to pay twice as much for a alien if it came with new mechanics. The predator game though is blocking him right now and it's a shame I really feel like that game is going to flop because of it being exclusive and its developers track record.
---
r/gamingdetails
---
That really depends on the head count and what jobs they're letting go. For example Dedicated Servers is a wayyyy different skill set than art. If DBD were to kill the Dedicated Servers, or cut back on the number of killers they needed then either group would be at risk. Some companies pay a lot to get the best talent in, then find out they don't have enough work for them/change priorities and don't have a spot for them any more.
---
Another random example (I guess I'll still use DBD) is the complete Freddy Rework.  When DBD sat down to figure out how much work they needed to do for the year and how many people they needed to do what tasks, they didn't count on Freddy being a failure. Rather than say too bad, they found the bandwidth to update him while sticking to their promises. I've been through 3 lay offs in the tech field (2 in gaming) and they suck bad. But they aren' t always because of bad leadership.
---
Freddy should be S tier here. Those sounds are the only good thing about playing him and they are so satisfying
---
That's a beautiful tag friend ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Same, spirit main here, I run Devour and Haunted Grounds, so according to op, I‚Äôd be basically running 2 perks, yet I‚Äôve never had a game where more than 2 survivors escape (one had a key and the other followed him through the hatch). With her map control, I‚Äôm always either in a chase, hooking, or I‚Äôm another chase far enough away to get another stack on devour. If they find one of my totems, it‚Äôs only 1/3 chance it‚Äôll be devour anyways lol
---
Borrowed time is not a crutch, and this game would be worse without it. Noed and MoM reward u for things that you should be trying to prevent from happening that‚Äôs what makes them crutches
---
Hmmmm I dont think that's very applicable in this scenario
---
that guy has the logo on his hat
---
Honestly I just use spine chill and about half of the time the killer doesnt go all the way to the gate they get close enough to look at the controls and then go to the other gate. The only problem is they will know you are around if they see the lights.
---
You‚Äôre missing the point though.  It‚Äôs to do with the fact that they know that they would be able to stay on the hook where it‚Äôs actually safer. Than staring at the killer that is staring right at you as the survivor unhooks you knowing that the killer is going to smack you back down giving them an extra few seconds to run. Or better yet.  Throwing you back on the hook for them to completely ignore the survivor as he literally just in hooks you again.  And boom.   Dead. The thought of it being a perk is useless.  You have deliverance.  Why would you need a perk to stop other survivors from personally fucking you over?
---
I‚Äôd rather you be doing gens instead of purposely unhooking me for the killer to kill me instead of still chasing you.       Did nobody read this post properly?
---
No BT does not stop tunneling...
---
Your so condescending
---
Yeah I see where you‚Äôre coming from. Maybe they should put queue timers on disconnecting players say 5 min penalty
---
Freddy is easily the worse killer so you're obviously playing against some carefree survivors because when I play him I struggle alot against average survivors. The rework does look like it's basically changing his whole power making him easier to 4k but more steep learning curve.
---
Its called you pick and choose who you chase. and every single 110 killer has a good power to help in a chase so that doesnt matter.
---
That's me. Thanks for noticing üò∏
---
There's a thing some streamers do at rank reset where they play Freddy but don't sleep anyone, they just watch survivors hide behind trees waiting for Freddy and his lullaby to leave, it's kinda funny ^_^
---
It is only possible if the gens are done, it will not happen if you close the hatch while they are up.
---
That's why we stand in the middle of hatch, bodyblocking them so they can't jump in, don't close the hatch and FORCE THEM to do the gens. Once the last gen pops and the gates get powered, that's when we close the hatch and go for the doors :D
---
NO ONE ESCAPES BURGER KING MYERS!
---
You're right, why did I think that was a trapper perk in my head?
---
nvm then
---
Wait, youre saying that in a game where two sides are playable, and each have broken elements that whenever one side wins the other assumes its because of said broken element? Its like its every type of game in existance!
---
Hex totems will most likely be changed and as they should ..at the moment it‚Äôs a 50\50 if it‚Äôs destroyed within the first minute and if it is that‚Äôs game over pretty much.
---
All we need now is a Wraith cosplayer making fun of him.
---
Ding Ding Ding!
---
I mean, lowing devour early game definetly sucks. But it happens
---
Lmfao. Imagine getting this worked up over a number 3. Fucking golden.
---
Super excited for this, but I mostly just can't believe this game has been out for 3 years. It's amazing what this game has turned out to be, and I can't wait to see what Year #4 brings.
---
I think spirit buffs are the last thing we should be worrying about dude.
---
Far more boring than twirling a big pocket knife in your fingers.
---
Happy oink üê∑
---
It would be cool that it allows you to see the hatch when it's opened
---
They used to be standard and then stop development. The game would be done, bugs/bad balancing/ bad characters. On going work cost money, so if they want to sell a pass they don't give any kind of in game advantage AND I still get extra stuff for not buying it? That's fine with me. Not every game can sell like Overwatch.
---
Chuckles likes traps. That is all that is stated.
---
Candyman. Such an icon and would be great if Tony Todd allowed his face to be put on the character. 
---
Most of the Hellraiser movies are garbage. His abilities are inconsistent movie to movie. Power would be pretty much made up and cause arguments from fans. 
---
Leprechaun franchise is mostly comedy with gore.
---
Chucky can't carry survivors to hooks.
---
Everything Xenomorphs do is biological drive or instinct. It wouldn't carry survivors to hooks or be influenced by the entity to play by the rules of the realm. Its drive would be to only kill immediately or use them for reproduction.
---
I assure you it was bugged in normal games. One of the reason why I didn‚Äôt use DS much before the rework was because of this bug. Totally unpredictable as to when it would happen. My other favorite one is when you get the skill check noise but no skill check at all. And it still eats DS even if you don‚Äôt click anything.
---
&gt;Save
---
GIRL that's your opinion what would you expect people  say. :/
---
I want to help out
---
Just find the hatch first before the killer closes it.
---
What do you mean grindy? It would just be for playing the game. Maybe I‚Äôm just misunderstanding but I don‚Äôt see why it would be a grind.
---
okay
---
Well then I guess you now have beef with this guy 
---
:D
---
I mean it's all for meme purposes in the first place, it's not about actually doing the math on what gives the least points, it's about "denying" them the actions.
---
Wanna take hatch? YOU CAN'T D:
---
Wanna open the door? YOU CAN'T D:
---
Now what exactly does it mean to have a legacy sim?
---
LMAO
---
Pretty sure they just pulling their plugs to keep items. People are abusing it since release
---
Lemme tell you about my God Spirit build- only once has two survivors left (they had a key and both left). 
---
The perks are- Haunted Grounds, Spirit Fury, Devour Hope, and either Make Your Choice, Barbecue, or Monitor and Abuse (prefer make your choice). Here‚Äôs the plan- never camp. Ever. It doesn‚Äôt matter if two or even three gens get done before you hook one survivor, you‚Äôll snowball. First, hook a survivor- don‚Äôt worry about your totems yet, a lot of the survivors I‚Äôve played against have thought ‚Äúa Spirit with a Hex Totem? I bet it‚Äôs haunted grounds!‚Äù They‚Äôll leave it alone- that is, until you‚Äôve insta-downed after getting three stacks. Now, they‚Äôll start looking for your hex, but here‚Äôs where the plan gets juicy- they only have a 1/3 chance of finding your Devour, so by the time they get the right totem, you‚Äôve had plenty of opportunity to instadown in the meantime. Plus, if your Devour DOES get found, that‚Äôs where your MYC comes into play. As soon as you hook a survivor, haunt to the furthest gen you can. Then, stay in that general area where your haunt ended, and once they‚Äôve been unhooked, haunt back and you‚Äôll have two instadown survivors- borrowed time won‚Äôt active since your whooshing towards them does not count as a terror radius. Spirit fury is for during a chase, should you not be able to fake a survivor out and they manage to loop you, at least you won‚Äôt totally be screwed over, but if you want to replace with Barbecue and Chili, go for it! Hope this helped! (I know ranks don‚Äôt exactly matter, but I‚Äôve consistently been able to reach red rank if it helps )
---
Ok so we were on the Daycare map and he took me inside to the kitchen to show me how to make a Chicken. He cooked it in the boiler downstairs lol.
---
tbh it is a good perk now need a small buff i used once and it saved my ass after the killer was closing the hatch and i was camping an exit gate
---
How long can you have fun with this game? Is it worth it?
---
Fun is indefinite with Bing Bong
---
Sadly 9% doesn't mean much when the killer is closing in.
---
I think they should change the animation of the Doctor, I think he would make a fondness on his bat, like a mini masturbation.
---
It‚Äôs borrowed time. The counter is not to tunnel people off the hook.
---
I play survivor 70/30 &amp; I can tell you that camping is beyond ridiculous. Having said that, I need to thank you guys for your straying from that path. Also, it is abhorrent when survivors DC. It ruins the gameplay, screws over the teammates, &amp; makes it much harder for the killer to get their points. It‚Äôs just terrible all around.
---
Sounds like Borrowed Time. 
---
If they were recently saved by someone with Borrowed Time, they have a period of time where they ‚Äúeat a hit‚Äù and go into Deep Wound.
---
It's borrowed time. After legion was released the changed the Perk to inflict the deep wounds effect.
---
You need to wait 7 seconds without add ons to hit anyone that easily gives time for a survivor to go to a safe location his ability also doesn't help in chases and you can easily get out of the dream world plus he can't apply alot of gen pressure because of the previous points. That's why I struggle with him and hope that at least explains why he is bad.

What is that meter at the top? Haven‚Äôt played in a while
---
I would still like to apologize to the Claudette who got insta downed by DH and hooked when she had played well all game. However spirit wants them bbq stacks and being the last one will not stop me. *I‚Äôm sorry little one*
---
I played exclusively Kill Your Friends for awhile and I always picked Dwight because I thought he was a lovable doofus. Even without knowing the game or any of the memes, I instantly went to the lockers. 
---
It's like you play Dwight and you just *know*.
---
Did you mean invisible?
---
True, and every game shouldn't shoehorn in microtransactions and battle passes. Yet here we are.
---
I don't think they getting kicked. Me and my friends never had this issue and we play alot. It's always random survivors who "losing" their connection as soon as they get downed. DC rate is really high these days, i guess people just realized there is no punishment since devs said they not gonna do anything until they introduce dedicated servers.
---
Yeah it auto corrected it
---
This is wholesome content I love it this is what I want when I'm playing.
---
If I know for a fact I pipped and the killer isn't an asshole I'll give myself up at the end.
---
Look at the emblems you‚Äôre getting and that‚Äôll tell you what you‚Äôre doing ‚Äúwrong‚Äù.

As soon as they start punishing people for disconnecting
---
Bloodweb is already 80% useless garbage, like yes, I'm gonna lessen fog as a survivor or thicken the fog as killer. All luck offerings are useless too, as they don't help with chests, only Kobe. Or offerings to get bigger skill checks on medkits/toolboxes. Or toolbox sabotage ad ons, probably 95% of survivors will never use them, unless it's daily to sabo 3 hooks, or swf group doing a meme build. One more map offering would change nothing.
---
I remember a game as Myers where I was giving a Dwight the hatch cause the poor fucker had been sandbagged countless times. I took him straight to the hatch and waited for him to jump in. He took one deep look into my eyes and slowly Shook his head in a negative manner. I whispered softly, "why? This can be your glory. Your revelation. Why turn away on it?." He slowly waddles over to a hook and takes a long, thoughtful look at it. He slowly turns back to me and says, "Dew it. "
---
Well they could easily use the same method which the post talks about, seems like a necessity at this point.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
They're more of a scripted show than a live Q&amp;A
---
As snarky/sarcastic as that sounded, I was 100% serious. 
---
I‚Äôm going to assume it‚Äôs the chaser emblem consistently if you‚Äôre playing doctor.
---
I had a killer send me an apology message after they pulled me out of a hatch once. I guess that counts as nice.
---
Only if they have Adrenaline.
---
Oh bot Dead By Daylight is going to become a day care with all these babies.
---
Yeah, NGL I really like Plague but her animations are kinda lame. Her cosmetics are so dang pretty and then? We get crap animations. I guess you can't win 'em all?
---
Lol its a perk called Adrenaline
---
omg
---
If they already used unbreakable, it could have been Adrenaline. Closing the hatch does activate adrenaline for the last survivor, which would have healed him from dying to injured state.
---
I've even had a 4 man SWF have 3 of them all lose connection as I'm chasing the one that didn't lose connection. Trust me when I say they lost connection
---
i hadn't even thought of that. that meg must've felt slick.
---
hahahahaha ur right
---
Thats fair, none of those builds have much chance of being beaten if you're at least OK at the game. Good to see not everyone thinks just playing the much-hated NOED means youre scummy.
---
The Pig a higher tier than Legion even tho theyre the same üòî
---
but legion should get a different hit animation
---
how about they wipe it across their bloody smile? or if everybody gets a seperate animation per mask, like susie nervously wiping it off on her long shoulders and joe quickly swiping the blood off by placing the blade inbetween two fingers.
---
Thanks man
---
I gotta agree with that too. She‚Äôs waaayyy too amp dependent right now and usually ends up being weaker than she should be. Also she‚Äôs a tall fit woman who looks like she‚Äôs running.
---
You want to punish killers for dodging a lobby of SWF that they could have gone against before? Who t-bagged and made them have a terrible time? Sounds like a survivor main to me lmao
---
I mean, technically Bubba is easy to play. It's just that his power sucks in most chase situations, so when someone is that unlucky duck that gets hit by the chainsaw's furthest hitbox pixel, they probably feel that the game fucked them over.
---
High risk High reward
---
Get ready for tier 3, I‚Äôm gonna load up volume 2 because of this
---
UwU
---
The killers job is to kill and the survivors job is to hold out as long as possible.  However the in between goes down is up to the players. I for one love end game collapse as a survivor. If my teammates are trash the hatch spawns REGARDLESS of how many gens are done. And if the killer finds hatch first, they deserve it. If I'm able to escape through a gate- which wasnt even possible pre patch- cool. And if I'm not, gg better luck next game. What's the alternative? It not dying in 3 minutes it's a half hour hatch standoff.
---
rip
---
I honestly just like it for opening the doors faster. Quicker they open, the faster I can abandon my team to their doom.
---
You're right I made it up
---
‚ÄúHey, you! You‚Äôre finally hooked. Must‚Äôve been trying to open the exit gate like that Claudette over there‚Äù
---
Not familiar with nightmare addons. Wat do?
---
Fhaaa-loop!
---
I get that but I just went friendly killer just to get a daily ritual done, it was the chase one, and I still got 10k points, one of them gave me a free sacrifice for being nice but still, that‚Äôs a low killer score lol
---
Old Meg and Claudette looked cool, I was hoping we would see them as new survivors :(
---
...but why not?
---
Imagine being angry at an endgame killer like Pig running a late game perk
---
Your sacrifice will not be in vain soldier, this information will save the lives of many
---
Hey, I'm amazed it took 4 minutes for 3 people to do 5 gens and escape with 21k+ points.
---
I do this if i didnt bring in a key/toolbox with good addons
---
Yes
---
His power isn't making him able to attack a survivor (well technically it is), but if you use his power like that you are playing him wrong. Freddy benefits from survivors' mistakes, and at the same time he forces survivors to do them (reason why overcharge is unironically a good perk on him)
---
He has a more strategical playstyle rather than an aggressive playstyle. He can stall the game and slowly defeat an entire team by keeping the most survivors you can in the dream world
---
I usually see this happen unless it‚Äôs a 3 person DC and the killer lets the last one escape like a good boi ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Have you ever done this with a mori tho, its so much fun after a toxic game
---
I really do love both of them but Hybrid is sucha potato. Watching killer vids I'm like "C'mon... you ain't see that survivor? You knew you didn't have that hit. You should have checked your totem after hooking that guy"
---
Interesting. I actually thicken fog as a survivor (to decrease visibility from the killer) and lessen the fog as a killer to track survivors on the map.
---
You mean Sheltered Woods? Yeah I personally don't enjoy that map as a Survivor either
---
&gt;He can't apply a lot of gen pressure
---
DUDE that's like the best thing he can do and he does it amazingly. The devs aren't reworking freddy because he's bad, they are reworking him because people can't adapt to a new playstyle
---
I need chinese ganster freddy to shoot his gun up my arse
---
Excuse me, but where the f r i c c have you seen a bubble butt on Wraith?
---
If that's the only goal, why do you get more BP for doing thinks like healing, evading, and repairing? Even lore wise, these people don't actually escape their hell.
---
People dc on hook to get a double depip so they dont rank up that fast. If they dont have many points and its early game they will take the double depip over 0-5k points. That minimal BP loss is probably worth staying away from facing the same 2-3 killers every game and increasing your lobby time by 5x or more.
---
bbq, sloppy, nurses, noed
---
Yeah, I can agree with you there. But yes the trailer was a nice little tease for us!
---
Ebony memento mori should not be in this game because it's so vastly overpowered.
---
Thanks guys
---
Reason why I have messages from strangers turned off
---
A man of culture as well I see
---
Playing last couple nights, only takes a couple.
---
They could just unhook fail 3x times and not struggle, its easy to die or not get saved. But that only results in a single depip. Dcing is 2 depips :)
---
Mr Bing Bong would like to have a word with you
---
FUCK YEAH YOU TELL EM TAPPY DUDE
---
Can they invite you?
---
*a wild surveillance has appeared!
---
You go out of cloak if you get hit by a pallet though, also the cloak at start is a recent thing, you used to have to cloak at the beginning, telling everyone that they were playing against a wraith.
---
Omfg hahaha that‚Äôs trucking funny !
---
they mean like when you buy a full cosmetic it saves int he outfits area and you can put the whole thing on at once, they want it like that for prestige too :o
---
You still would be able to, the whole outfit means you only need one click to swap the three skins at once.
---
One thing you can do when you blind early, is go for a chain blind to trigger the stun. Right when the killer starts moving hit the eyes again and it will stun really quickly.

---
Lmao
---
He‚Äôs also not behind a paywall like Bubba - making him more accessible for players
---
Yea fam
---
Piggy and wraith tho
---
It‚Äôs tough because it‚Äôs definitely near impossible for survivors but I don‚Äôt think it should be a freebie either. 
---
I think it would be interesting to make it so when one survivor is left, the lights on the Exit Gate do not show progress. It‚Äôs a clear giveaway to the killer so could make it a bit more fair, as killers can still counter and guarantee that last kill with Whispers.
---
Because only one person can get on it
---
I mute my game when he‚Äôs doing his mori lmao
---
Im even more amazed the killer would complain in that scenario, for the survivors to rack up that many points the killer prolly would have anywhere between 28k and max points. Not bad for a 4 min game right. Kinda sad some people complain but dont even realize the points indicate a totally different scenario.
---
Only one person can get on it
---
Rin just sounds cuter, i dont know why call him doc instead of herman tho i find that name funny xd
---
Good! Good! More to the Clown army...*coughing intensifies*
---
Wait what's the rework?
---
As a killer main. I dislike him because he‚Äôs just kind of bland. His ability is very surface level, there‚Äôs not much to it besides walking towards a survivor and holding M2. And in my opinion this makes playing him very uninteresting.
---
Hahahaha, yeah. For some reason, I can't just type 'gg' and move on. I just want to talk after a long game.
---
This is why bellboi is actuall BESTboi
---
You don't have to use all of your power every time, in chase it's better to use it in small bursts to get better effects and more tries.
---
Her add ons are really strong and Spirit is the 2nd best killer overall, she's fine.
---
Accurate doge
---
The Clown is the one that bursts out laughing every time he hits a survivor. If anyone is having the time of their life it's him.
---
Good luck c:
---
Meg is megs lost cousin tho
---
1. These are all really bad 360's
---
2. They probably think they dont have a way to avoid your hit in a few seconds anyway so as a last ditch effort they try this tactic, even though its probably gonna fail. Like trying to pull yourself off a hook, its a slim chance, but possible, so you do it when you have no other options
---
He only killed people in his way and that bothered him other than that his main focus was annihilating his family
---
How exactly do you do that? My friend's computer is pretty bad and could deserve an FPS boost, lmao.
---
**insta-disconnect**
---
Oh lawd you are so tilted right now. How do you play this game without crying?
---
I honestly think that Tenacity is the best generalist anti-Slug perk for the average game with the average case of one-off slugging. It doesn't have the clutch potential of Unbreakable and Flip-Flop, but it lets you hide and lets you get to people to pick you up while picking yourself up.
---
I‚Äôm only pointing out that the shit goes both ways, and that nobody here can deny it.
---
Its decent most of the time but then there are moments when only 1 survivor is alive and it gets soooooo smooth as killer, dont know if it's just me
---
Roasted
---
I just realized how powerful the pig is with the endgame collapse.
---
would just saving my traps until the end game collapse be a horrible idea?
---
One of my questions is why you picked trapper as killer. Instinct since hes the staple of the game?
---
Excuse you, are you denying the existence of big bong bois big asset? Thou shalt not talk about him this way. You need to repent from your sin!
---
Jesus Christ. Why the duck do you guys like this so much???
---
Amanda literally lives in a meat packaging plant. She can cook a mean ham.
---
still dont get it, how is huntress op in making survs to lick her balls
---
Please tel me this is bait
---
I picked him because I thought the bear traps would be a good tool to use. Played as hag for one round and it was alright. Want to get Michael at some point though. Just trying to get the hang of playing as killer first.
---
Borrowed Time is an extremely powerful but well designed perk. It discourages both camping and tunneling but doesn't actually benefit you in any way, in fact it can often get you targeted over the person you rescued. In a lot of ways, it's the exact opposite of a crutch perk.
---
I'm on the side of keeping it the way it is. When the game is down to the last survivor it is a race to get the hatch.
---
Before the end game collapse, a killer could find the hatch first, but they would be guaranteed a loss because if they left it, then the survivor would jump in, or they would camp it and it would be a hatch stand off which the survivor would usually win.
---
Now it's just a race to the hatch. The first on there will win. Survivor finds it first? Great, they win. Killer finds it first, the survivor still had at least a small chance to escape by opening a gate.
---
I think it's a great idea, rather than how it was before when it was nearly a guarantee for the last survivor to win.
---
What about pig I think she can be up there if nurse can
---
Trap the loops not the gaps
---
you have sexy hands
---
I do something similar as survivor. If the killer is having a shitty game I wait until all 3 survivors leave and walk up to him. Either you hit me for points and put me on hook or the entity will do it for you.
---
[deleted]
---
Well his official nickname is chuckles, one of the official dbd shirts refers to him as ‚Äúthe chuckling killer‚Äù
---
Or just crouching to avoid the killer which is literally in the other side of the map chasing someone, meanwhile i just watch the scene from the hook
---
If the game starts with only 3 people, I usually avoid the common tactics like proxy camping and 3-gen patrol, and give away the hatch to the last survivor. 
---
If to add insult to injury, someone DCs, I'll just let them farm and escape. It's not fair.
---
But if someone DC's in a 4-man that has been going for a while, that's not my problem. I can't just pretend like they weren't there from the start. They made generator progress and likely wasted my time in chases.
---
Apparently almost 1500. Now if only he was better :(
---
They need to rework him
---
He used to be incredibly good, now he's quite a potato.
---
&gt;DarkSouls
---
Ah, *this* guy again
---
Is being able to hear Wraith‚Äôs heartbeat while he‚Äôs invisible a feature or a big? On Xbox, haven‚Äôt played for a while so I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs part of a rework or not.
---
This game causes people to be rude to one another. Streamers promote the behavior. And the devs let the us fight about it.
---
You mean Nurse wants to bang bing bong?
---
That's the point. Ignore one man's if you dont want to deal with it
---
Poor baby :(
---
Freddy being the worst killer is a meme perpetuated by people who try to play him a certain way and are then surpised when they do poorly. Freddy is easily one of the hardest killers to play, up there with Nurse and Spirit, but in a very different way. He's probably the most passive killer in the game. He's all about stalking and ambushing survivors and can lock down several different survivors at once while also keeping constant track of exactly where they are on the map. He is very easy to abuse due to the dream transition and due to the prevalence of perks like Self-Care, Adrenaline, and Mettle of Man, which all counter him in different ways, but if they just focused on a few key areas they could make him feel so much better to play and more difficult to a use without completely trashing his old kit. If they do completely change him, there is a good chance I won't come back, because right now Freddy is the only reason why I'm still playing.
---
Chuckles is gay because he likes traps and traps are gay
---
I would do that but then I'd miss all the good messages too
---
 PREECH
---
I really just dont see why people praise that perk like it's a God tier perk.
---
Trapper is a tough killer to do well with. I would recommend Wraith. Pretty fun add-ons and is much easier to do well with than trapper.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll try out the wraith
---
You can only use exhaustion perks once per chase ever since the nerf, so I don't see the problem...
---
I'm a new player so I need all the bloodpoints i can get lol
---
Well yeah I can get that blood points wise. But people just praise the aura like it's a heaven sent gift.
---
*sobs quietly* There is a special place in hell for monsters like you!
---
I'm not a survivor main and I think this is a terrible idea. You only want 1 dead hard per match? They would be useless.
---
Yeah but usually survivors get chased multiple every game. 
---
Since exhaustion perks are used to extend chases it should only be fair that survivors can use them once.
---
poor Freddy gets his own tier at the bottom everytime
---
Useless? 
---
Just one well timed dead hard is enough for a killer to completely lose the game. It's literally one of the most broken perks rn and this idea is just to try to find a way to make it slightly more balanced.
---
You're going to get downvoted by killer mains too, lol. This is a terrible idea.
---
Hi, I would like to help out. However, I don't have any way to screenshot it. Can I send a list where I keep track of what I found instead?
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs really necessary at this point. As far as I understand it, whenever dedicated servers do arrive killers will be waiting in queues too. So even if they do get into a lobby and then end up dodging/quitting out of it, that lobby will remain intact with all of the survivors and it‚Äôll just search for a new killer for them instead. And hopefully that doesn‚Äôt take long. 
---
Oh, also just as a head‚Äôs up, if you get disconnected within about 3 seconds of arriving at a lobby, it‚Äôs most likely the game doing it rather than the killer leaving. A lot of people don‚Äôt seem to realize so I figured I‚Äôd throw that out too. I know a lot of them do dodge after seeing who they‚Äôre against, but it‚Äôs not the case 100% of the time you‚Äôre kicked out.
---
I don‚Äôt know much about playing killer either but some advise is to trap and pressure one side of the map so that you have an advantage with the gens.... I hope I explained that right. Err... it‚Äôs like forcing them to come to you and making them fearful of the grounds they run on.
---
I told him to do asmr with his sexy voice on a stream and he said no :(
---
You missed, blendette
---
Yes, a horrible idea. The traps don't activate after the last gen is done, so, they can escape wearing them.
---
You‚Äôre out of your mind. 
---
Delete this.
---
you wrote out the sound perfectly
---
I had to drop her after someone said she looked slow.
---
To be honest, my SWF queue times on PS4 have not been bad at all these past few weeks, nor my solo queue times, Killer or Survivor. I‚Äôm also intentionally sitting between ranks 10 and 15 for the good queue times though, so... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
As long as you‚Äôre not at a high rank, I don‚Äôt think queues should be too bad.
---
Luminosity6 and ohtofu are all I watch these days. Lumi is smaller but a damn funny streamer. And I love the way tofu explains the game. And both arent toxic shitheads
---
Talk about making getting faces for leather face even more hard lol. Once dedicated servers come out lobby dodging won‚Äôt be a issue anymore
---
Left behind is completely worthless now that the hatch automatically spawns no matter what when you are last survivor.  A High rank Plunderer's Instinct is better than that just because you can look through boxes to get a key fairly frequently, and still have useful items in the session, and reopen the hatch if the killer closes the hatch.
---
The only time mindgaming is relevent with freddy is with dream transitions and tricking people into thinking you're doing something else. otherwise his kit just opens  up a whole new play style and strategy, playing freddy feels like playing a ressource management game, the only others ones that come close to this is pig and plague.
---
Nothing urks me more than when survivors use spine chill and I‚Äôm a stealth killer. *sad oink* *sad wraith elephant sound* *sad Myers heavy breathing*
---
Oof
---
The only time I see it is when someone uses noed or camps the hook.
---
I'm a killer main, hell I'm a *Freddy* main and I still think that this is a terrible idea.
---
Killer main?
---
I'm not sure how much each does. But recovery adds up in a game. 4 recoveries of time are done instead of 3. 
---
However, recovery is still ass for add-ons on Spirit, especially considering the Amulet exists. Having that move speed means you get to your target quicker meaning you won't need as much duration to catch them and having less duration needed means less time needed to recover. And that takes up one slot.
---
Move speed and charge speed add-ons are her best add-ons all around.
---
"We're all brothers and sisters in the post-game lobby now, Meg."
---
Are you mad over my opinion bruh ??
---
2 levels away from getting piggy to tier 3 ;(
---
Lmao maxed out noed... I cant..
---
no one who took the time to learn freddy thinks he's weak. he is a pain to play against, so i agree he needs a lil rework, but not a complete overhaul.
---
Wraith is definitely not fine. He very sad
---
Look at Adiris what a queen
---
If I‚Äôm gonna be a trash killer i‚Äôm gonna be a trash killer correctly. Noed, sloppy, discordance, and my fourth which i switch every once in a while with two pins to add more effects.
---
7 seconds and lightweight knocks it down to 4.5 I think. Not 100% sure.
---
They were big for a while and had a drop off for a bit. They were pretty bad then too.
---
MoM and Adrenaline suck but what's wrong with other perks?
---
Thank you!!
---
Nice! I like how you did the eyes :)
---
Keep it up, I would love to see how you do Doctor and Spirit!
---
She can grab our of the locker, to my recollection. And that only helps temporarily. She will down you shortly after. 
---
Also, breaking line of site only helps a bit. A good nurse will either predict where you are or just float toward you at that point if uncertain or tight corners like the pier on the swamp. She doesn‚Äôt have to get in a chase, she just needs to regain line of sight. That is why she is like legion. You could juke the old legion, but the second you are sighted, you are done. 
---
She is entirely too strong. This is coming from someone who transitioned from PS4 to PC just to play nurse.
---
Lucky lol. I'm almost ready to prestige my Spirit again and I haven't seen it once :')
---
It basically makes myers a standard m1 killer, as it removes the moment speed buff he gets from EW2.
---
You get a lot better at hitting greats the more you play and it makes a big difference with ruin. Just go for greats and practice them.
---
that is very B I G hair.
---
So that‚Äôs why people call him chuckles some times. Guess that‚Äôs sticking with me too.
---
No issue on my end that ive noticed. Maybe a bug happened to you.
---
Im working on the spirit right now!!
---
Also Freddy is a newbstomper probably moreso than any other Killer.  Newbies have no clue how to deal with his mechanics and get themselves killed.
---
That black lady one looks amazing.
---
Rip :(
---
i bet Evan makes mean pancakes with chocolate chips and blueberries
---
That‚Äôd be dope! Frank and Julie wipe it off on their mask like in the trailer
---
Meanwhile on my journey with Trapper from base to P3 I have not seen bbq a single time.
---
March June September and December would be 3 months apart and all this year.
---
Dead by daylight is easily the most toxic game I have ever played by far. Even stereotypically toxic games like Rainbow Six don‚Äôt come anywhere near the caliber of angry survivors players when you play the game normally.
---
You mean meg
---
as a survivor and killer player I can only say fuck no. the 40 second cooldown is essentially obligatory because it resets when you get hooked, which means your using it once per chase. that is not OP
---
I barely have all the teachable perks up to Feng rn (and Jeff‚Äôs perks)
---
In all honestly this was a joke that fell super flat, i don't even play killer
---
Was she true to her word?
---
....THATS MEG?!
---
Was
---
The point was not the chase or when to break off, but 3 gens popping in the first minute or so, typically before or on the first down. 
---
Ruin only delays about 10 or so seconds on an experienced survivor or a gen tapper. That is nothing with toolboxes and BNP‚Äôs. 
---
By the time you get into a chase, 3 gens pop. That happens frequently. 
---
A gen rush is like a Red Mori. It gets the game done way too fast and only one side is having fun.    Many complaints about gen rushing are just survivors doing their tasks, but actual gen rushing does occur a lot nowadays in SWF. I see it when I play both sides. As a solo survivor, it is frustrating because it means I get camped if I am caught or I don‚Äôt interact with the killer enough to pip.
---
Killer main here, this would just make it way to hard for survivors to escape. 
---
 perks like that have there place and while some may need to be changed or updated removing them completely seems a step to far in my opinion
---
Even so, I want her as a desperate survivor. We only have one black girl, we need more diversity.
---
Thanks. It goes deeper into real life issues I think, that‚Äôs why I liked it .
---
I meant seperate
---
I meant seperate.
---
pig got that widow maker booty
---
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
---
Haha yeah she does!!
---
Agreed. Left behind has no value anymore.
---
It's because he's always smiling :)
---
Correct, they nerfed it. I still use traps though because of the +500 BP bonus per set trap.
---
Ok but the Nurse is hauntingly beautiful and should be higher. Also the spirit is hideous.
---
Legion can‚Äôt insta down with frenzy wym
---
That‚Äôs why it said technically
---
Oh I‚Äôm dumb lol but does deep wound count
---
Technically
---
I have no one to play with. I que solo. I tell you what though last night, it was a hard night for killers.
---
Mount Ormond suprisingly.

I have no idea which is why I asked. I just started and wanted some peeps to play with but idk if I can
---
That's stupid.. I hate killers like that I've had a few do it to me.. i just left the game since they didn't want to try and kill me.
---
Solo queue life, nothing new here
---
Please stop it's not even funny anymore
---
Oh cool really, will do
---
Dwight was born in a locker and he will die in a locker.
---
Well damn, that map can be a nightmare for some killer (especially Burger King Myers), congrats on your 4K!
---
No. We dont need to punish dodging. They will be stuck in a lobby with people they dont want to play with. Then they will get punished for dcing. I dont get what it is about this game that makes people think if you arent having a good time you HAVE to stay and deal with it. They need to punish early game dcs. They dont need to punish if you do it after being camped the entire match. Why dont they find a way to punish people for that stuff.
---
Yeah, trust me, I got a fuck ton of hate messages too. Just ignore em or block messages. Congratulations on platinum!
---
Thicc thighs save lives
---
It's not crazy different. 
---
Now it needs to be protection hits, however(dont quote me on this), it can be any attack, such as a hatchet or a chainsaw.
---
You will also use MoM anytime you enter the dying state, not just from injured, allowing you to survive chainsaws and noed
---
Adrenaline cucks dead hard and one of its best utilities of dodging insta-downs
---
Damn. I like it.
---
Really? His perks aren't that bad. I struggled with "where did they go?!" fuck that trophy
---
New blood's good for any game, though.
---
Nice, I was told I could do either, so I'm going to do whatever the shortest queue times are. I bet they did that in an effort to try and make queue times shorter, hopefully that's the case.
---
Maybe. Like I said, Im not sure.
---
The Bubba buff we need, chainsaw chucking.
---
I think its better. Promotes altruism and is more than just a nerf, it's a rework
---
I feel like he gets so pressured from being live and playing it idk. Not seeing survivors tho that has happened to everyone shit in some videos dbd youtubers will miss someone damn near right of front of them them everyone will point it out like how did you miss that lol
---
lol people who disconnect because they got downed like it happens every game
---
I wish they didn't butcher the menus so hard, now it's super delayed just cause that's all they did to "fix" that 2016 Christmas Bug fiesta.  Main meny QOL improvements would be amazing. I'd love to have this look back with responsive navigation.
---
I was honestly worried they'd need it into the ground, but everything you said (if true) sounds pretty fucking badass... Or rather Badash?
---
1. Free bonus BP
---
2. A lot of information to use against the survivors.
---
I'd say pretty much everyone hates him, survivors and killers. Survivors hats him because he's only good at camping and killers hate him because he's pretty shit. People just buy him to get BBQ
---
Cheers
---
Ehhh not every game. Don‚Äôt exaggerate.
---
thanks, fix my pc
---
Can we get rid of the Entity blocking windows too while we're at it? And bring back Exhaustion recovery while sprinting!
---
Is it Jake? ;)
---
So long as the Hatchet thrown is in the same Zipcode as a Survivor, it's safe to say it'll hit them
---
Yes because there is a such thing as ping.
---
it hitted because we are on the fog
---
Calling them vacuum pallets literally proves why they shouldn‚Äôt exist
---
Resets often
---
I like you. I don‚Äôt like surviving against you (I‚Äôm a noob). But I like you.
---
Didn‚Äôt noob3 play against them?
---
finally
---
some good fucking tierlists
---
Edit it and repost it, and I'll give gold.
---
Resets too much too often
---
ouch
---
Toolboxes exist and are usually the most prominent thing in chests, as far as my experience goes
---
Question since I don‚Äôt play killer much: does it still show the aura of a survivor if they hide in a locker when someone gets hooked or are they hidden from the killer at that point?
---
Meaning you're a boss ass bitch who should be respected.
---
I thought Freddy was gonna be "Can't down."
---
Hiding in a locker completely hides your aura from the killer and is one of the best counters for bbq
---
I liked your editing in this one! The timing with the music was really well done. I enjoy this style of editing, but that's just me.
---
I apologized for being curt. I just wanted to share my thoughts on what might have been cool to see. I like your editing in general and hope to see more of your work here in the future!
---
*this post was sponsored by the killer mains gank*

how about we take this somewhere a little more private üòà
---
Wraith is hardcore depressed
---
Wake up isn't good 'cause it's EXTRA N I C H E, and, even then it's not that useful.
---
You learn to search for the doors icon when the last gen pop and it's easy to remember the 2 locations.
---
The speed boost is trash.
---
There are 3 other guys that can open the door before you do.
---
Chainsaw is mostly for pressure and getting around the map quickly. It's what makes Billy top tier; the hammer is what's actually for downing people.
---
BL shouldn't have the stagger reduction outside of when it actually procs, it just enables too many god-awful loops
---
You're almost definitely right.
---
It's the exact same thing they did last year. We got the Clown in mid-June, and the Spirit mid-late September.
---
Most likely scenario is a Ghostface release on the 12th of June, a Wednesday. 
---
All of Year 3's Chapters were released on Tuesday/Wednesday (time zones vary, my Steam says Wednesdays)
---
A lot of killers these days will ditch a lobby because they recognize/just played against someone who dcs constantly for any reason, and they don't want to be bothered dealing with it.
---
Ya i definately welcome perk ideas as a whole but i feel like more emphasis has to be put on reworking/buffing the already useless perks, rather than more bloodweb fodder
---
No it wasn‚Äôt a match disconnected. They all just dc‚Äôd. Not perfectly at the same time, but all together in unison
---
Yeah it's getting old at this point
---
Ive never heard of that, I just know that people do it as a meme. Look up the narnia juke
---
Unless you're talking about ramen flavoring packs.
---
and then u get a salty text
---
No. Vacuum pallets enabled loops to last way longer than they should've in the first place
---
From what we've seen over on r/leaksbydaylight, &gt;!there appears to be two separate tracks the player can progress through, one free to all players and the other most likely behind a paid 'Pass'.
---
Every few tiers, you'll unlock a cosmetic from the store. Unless it's all placeholder for now, there likely won't be anything on it like Bloodpoints, Shards or Cells.
---
Assuming it will all be cosmetics from the store in the final build, I'm completely fine with a battlepass.!&lt;
---
Throw some cajun spices in it. I'm getting hungry
---
I was back to 20 on Xbox it been that long. Got to get down below 10 before it‚Äôs added to gamepass.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Personally, I'm most interested in "new goals for players"
---
Something about this guys videos seem staged. In some videos it feels like he is in a discord with guys on comms playing KYF. Because if you watch closely as he is talking the survivor seemingly does what he is saying or "responds to him". There have also been videos where he would flat out say he knows someone or its his friend. Then the player proceeds to play like shit and make him look good. Many of his videos have "potatoes" that seems highly unlikely. yeah I am hovering around rank 13 Killer and I notice in my games the survivors and SWF play me MUCH harder then the ones do in his games. It all feels like fake entertainment, occasionally I think he catches wind that he is a fraud and then he starts uploading videos of survivors just barely escaping. But you never see him post a video of him getting his ass rammed by SWF. This is why I favor Tru3 far more, then man shows everything and even streams. Something Monto isn't going to do for good reason.
---
Rip my Main. I agree with those who say he‚Äôs in the similar boat as Nurse. If people would just LEARN HIM. Also when you learn how to play him properly, you learn how to counter him properly. Same can be said for all killers.
---
Dang that‚Äôs nice.
---
But yeah I‚Äôm worried about how long queue times are going to be. Once people do their 15 matches they‚Äôll probably stop
---
No point, in my opinion. Totems don't take very long to cleanse anyway, and aren't a huge part of the game. There's only five max, and that's if you go around and personally cleanse all of them. Could be a little bit helpful I guess, but not nearly helpful enough or relevant enough to warrant a Perk slot.
---
no. You just remember it 'cause it was clutch. 
---
But clearly it actually happens like 5% of your games.
---
Hi, yes, where‚Äôs the plague?
---
Damn, Iron maiden got a buff!  seems a bit op /s

I do it to get reunited bp
---
the only use of No Mither! is to challenge yourself as survivor when you reached a very high skill level for loops, OR, when the rank reset arrives and you want to give a chance to new killers.
---
I think a while back I saw 10, but is only visible to the killer for 7 seconds, and lightweight 3 knocks it down to a total of 4 seconds
---
There should be a base aura reading radius reduction added to sole survivor for when no one is dead yet. Like 10m.
---
(is these sentence understandable ?)
---
smh. Please reread the post.
---
Pig=upvote
---
I don't get the advantage of object of obsession, except if you are the god of looping and want to carry your team.
---
Op, just edit your post and say survivors should not be able to use perks at all
---
Marge Simpson Requiem
---
Does anyone else find it a tad annoying how Monto begs for likes nowadays? I'd rather him go back to spamming "just a little bit" and using ruin in every build then hear him cry and say stupid shit for a like. I mean if I am watching the video I'm gonna like it.....but if you go out of your way to beg and annoying me I'm gonna dislike it. Namely the moment you beg for the like in the first place.
---
yes but read what you wrote. There is not point in the survivors staying since you said they already won.. There is a point to killers camping. Whether it's a dick move/hurts their feelings is irrelevant. May not be the smartest thing to do as a killer but at least he is likely to gaurentee the kill.
---
Short answer: we don't know
---
Long Answer: He has a power meter that (may) work in a similar manner to Evil Within. He also has the power to escape the dream and attack people in the real world (Survivor auras turn yellow). Beyond that, no idea since we have about three seconds of footage in the anniversary trailer to go off.
---
Could be good if the killer has thrill of the hunt but other than that I wouldn‚Äôt really see to much of a use in it
---
Memers are immature and zzzzz
---
I honestly don't understand why would anyone put Freddy in the same place as the Nurse. If you play her on rank 1, she has a potential to get a 4k easily while you can't expect Freddy to get more than 1 kill against a skilled survivor team. Freddy is my favorite killer, but they are reworking him for a reason people...
---
Tenacity is not "garbage" tho. It does its job but since sluggin isn't quite used by killers, it's a niche perk. Still less niche than a lot of perks...
---
Man, don't you have something better to do than be pathetic on the internet? What, so used to being pathetic irl that you gotta let strangers know it, too? Lmfao. 10/10.
---
Use bags. Trapper's biggest weakness is the time it takes to move out, pick up, and put down traps. Bags let you hold more than one. Put traps down at loops + windows, and bait players into them. Hide them in grass and keep traps unexpected. Always try to keep 1 trap with you when hooking so you can trap potential exit routes. Otherwise he's your classic M1 killer. Practice mind games, winning loops, and rely on your pre-existing survivor knowledge to understand where they want to go.
---
If you're looking for perks, brute force isn't a terrible way to go. Ruin, Spirit Fury, Enduring, Bamboozle, but those require having leveled other kills (Spirit Fury is in the shrine right now).
---
Iron Grasp + Agitation can make for a fun basement trapper build. Your only goal is to get someone in the basement and then trap the entrances/exits. This gives you an early warning when someone tries to enter the basement and helps you to cut off their exit (they won't have time to get rid of every trap out of the basement).
---
Hope that helps!

[Does rank reset?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bsqs5f/does_rank_reset)
---
You asked that question an hour ago. You sound like quite the "cute little noob" yourself.
---
I've had plenty of matches where I died opening the gate like 95% of the way before the killer got to me and thought to myself, man if I had Wake Up I would've lived...
---
...then I put on wake up and either never make it to end game or someone beats me to the gate.
---
Dwight' evolution
---
This LOL, STW is not fun to go against
---
I would love to be able to just yeet a trap at a survivor as trapper.
---
Nice try, but this is a completely factual and artistic representation of Ranks 12+.
---
Reported for misleading flair you slut.
---
I really wish I could explain why I said this but honestly it would sound like r/thathappened so all I can say is delet this
---
Same here. I begin to notice with 2 of them left.
---
Agreed
---
1. The Killer's ability to close the hatch is counter-balanced by the fact that the hatch *always* spawns.
---
2. If the Killer has closed the hatch, the Survivor has already lost TWICE. Once when they failed to get all the gens repaired, and again when they failed to find the hatch before the Killer.
---
3. If the Survivor finds the hatch first, they instantly win. The Killer equivalent of this would be the Entity instantly killing the last Survivor when the hatch is closed. Instead, the Survivor still has another chance to escape.
---
4. The doors could do with spawning further away. That said, in certain circumstances, the Killer CANNOT stop the doors. These include any match on L√©ry's and when the doors spawn on opposite ends of Azarov's.
---
5. BHVR tried speeding up door openings in the 2.7.0 PTB, by dropping it 15 seconds. It was too powerful against Killers without increased mobility, such as; Trapper, Myers, Leatherface, Doctor, Huntress, Freddy, Pig, Clown and Plague.
---
6. If you have a perk that shows you where the hatch is; you instantly win, unless the Killer finds it before the third Survivor dies. As such, no-one would try to repair a 3rd gen, since the hatch only spawns after the third sacrifice when less than 3 gens are repaired.
---
7. Overall, if you want to give the last Survivor a free escape, more power to you. But they aren't entitled to it. Almost 3 years of the old hatch system has lead people to believe, even if only sub-conciously, that the last Survivor should always escape. If the Killer has got 3 kills before the gens are done, founf the hatch before the last Survivor and found them on the door before they can open it; the Killer has *earned* that win.
---
If it bothers you this much, a key is basically a free out anyway.
---
Thanks for the tips! I‚Äôve actually done pretty well so far with the trapper.
---
Hahahahaahahahahahahaahagahahahahahahahahahahahhaaaaaaaaaaaa.
---
THE KILLER COULDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THE HATCH! 
---
SHORT OF SLUGGING (unreliable) OR A HATCH STANDOFF, THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO TO PREVENT THE ESCAPE!
---
What do you mean by animation? You want the killers attack cooldown to be longer...? Why?
---
I‚Äôm relatively new to the game. Only a handful of hours into it. I wasn‚Äôt aware that people disconnecting is such a popular thing in the subreddit. I just thought that two people disconnecting from the match after getting bonked once was a bit odd, so I posted it.
---
Sorry for adding fuel to the fire, man. Didn‚Äôt realize how common it is.

---
**‚Äùhehh.. .nuthin perssonal, kid.‚Äù**
---
Free double bloodpoints lol, along with instructions on where to go next after hooking someone
---
Because it's not decent, just straight up bad. In exchange for playing 98% of the match with only 3 perks you gain the ability to open the Exit Gates **2** seconds faster.
---
By playing the match with only 3 perks you are already severely reducing your chances of even reaching the endgame.
---
And if by some miracle you do manage to survive till endgame because the killer decided not to tunnel or camp you or w/e, your ability to make use of this perk still ends up relying on you to: 
---
* Not be on a hook
---
* Not be chased by the killer
---
* Be the first person to reach the Exit Gate
---
Then and only then will you be able to save those precious 2 seconds. 
---
The devs could literally buff the perk from 15% to 100% and I'm stilll not sure if I'd want to use it over something that directly benefits me during the match like MoM, DS, DH, SC, BL, BT, Deliverance, Lithe, or Distortion.
---
Pressing ALT-F4 will unlock a special hidden character perfect for your needs.
---
Same thing for pizza Dwight
---
I find it pretty funny the times when noob3 and peppers play with monto
---
Just look around when the last gen pops lol
---
Rank 4 solo survivor on Xbox. 
---
When I was ranking up I ran Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Self-Care, and Dead Hard. 
---
If it helps you, great, but I personally think Stake Out is a waste of a perk slot. Sure it helps people who can't hit Ruin skill checks, but it's not gonna help you get any better either. I've learned to just power through Ruin at this point. I'm not perfect, but I'll get more than 5/10 great skill checks. 
---
At mid ranks - which I'll considered 13-7 - the important thing is to just **be busy**, I really don't know how else to say it. There are times I didn't escape and I'll get more points than survivors who did just because I was doing a bit of everything - kiting the killer, fixing gens, saving people. 
---
Adrenaline is nice, but it was just too niche for me. It's saved me when I've been slugged or being chased by the killer with one gen left, but those situations have been rare for me. And especially in mid ranks, *a lot* of killers are running NOED.
---
Huntress y‚Äôeats children
---
One day, in the far off future, we will have the technology to grant this wish.
---
no that would break her. good huntress can already get you around every building you turn into
---
You do know that Monto only mostly uploads his best recorded gameplay of where his build that he's doing or whatever gimmick he's doing does well or is entertaining to watch. Nobody is gonna want to watch a video of Monto getting facecamped because of his sweaty haters that get him in the game or ones that tunnel him where he can't make great plays that are entertaining to watch. Same thing applies to his Killer builds. As longest as his Killer games are entertaining, he doesn't always upload gameplay of where he 4k's every game.
---
This is 100 percent up to personal preference. I personally love spirit, as she is amazing, and pig because I find her fun, but just look at the killers and go with what you think you would want.
---
I'm guessing yes it did
---
Hatchet -&gt; melee attack can basically be a insta down in certain conditions.
---
once upon a toxic huntress (literally watched it 5 mins ago)
---
but this isn't a screencap of it because different names
---
That‚Äôs not an instadown. That‚Äôs a hatchet and a melee.
---
Saw. Because Pig is love and has 2 good perks.
---
As long as Wraith has water wings, I‚Äôm down.
---
If the survivor is going from healthy to down in 1 second why does it matter that I clicked twice.
---
The fact that you‚Äôre even trippin off me asking for a build is pathetic lmao 
---
You could have kept scrolling, but instead you chose to waste time telling me something I don‚Äôt give a shit about ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü•¥
---
All good, hope you are still having fun regardless.
---
Because that‚Äôs not an insta down. That‚Äôs a quickly ended chase based off of the survivors poor positioning.
---
Solid Oinks.

More importantly, you saved the flashlight

Bro, simple, don‚Äôt face camp, it‚Äôs really not fun for anyone and you just make everyone hate you.
---
Random question I didn‚Äôt ask Tuesday. If when you load into the game as a survivor, three survivors have left on the loading screen, leaving just yourself, two gens to do, and the killer, will the hatch start off as open at the very beginning?
---
spine chill for the Win that's why I run it for gate opens like that

---
Honestly I don‚Äôt hate wake up, but imo oddly I think it lost some oomph with the end game collapse, as revealing to the survivors in chase know that a gate would be opened for them and where it was was pretty nice. Now tho the EGC starts and you know it‚Äôs open.
---
I think buffing weaker perks in large batches is the next big thing I want to see done.
---
If the killer is speedy, you're a little screwed.  Spirit, Billy, and sometimes Nurse will not be having that noise.  It's kind of up to the luck of the draw, if Killer has LOS of two gate doors, once that first light goes on, it's kinda over.  Then it's a waiting game til the Collapse.
---
I was playing Michael earlier with tombstone and tuft of hair so unlimited EW3 and insta kill EW3 caught 2 people and killed them then caught the 3rd instantly DC'd his friend also DC'd right after. Smfh just take the L. The had 1 gen left too.
---
But people run adrenaline all the time and never get to use it. Much more popular than Wake Up but it‚Äôs the same concept in that you often never get to use it and play with 3 perks all game.
---
I was playing myers today with a tombstone and hair tuft so OP EW3. They did 4 gens before i caught anyone but i insta killed 2 people and the 3rd person who was teabagging earlier DC'd while i grabbed him to kill him then his friend did the same like 3 seconds later.
---
The freddy in the real world image is from meg's perspective, the yellow survivor aura is visible to her, not freddy.
---
I think once game starts it's pretty concrete. If killer DCs it counts as escape so you keep what's in hand, if survivors DC it doesn't do anything to you, you either survive and escape to keep your stuff or die on hook and lose it.
---
Did your friend live? Saw they had unbreakable
---
Ruin+Noed on these Ranks..oof
---
I know but what i meant in the post was if someone brought a brand new part they should get to keep it but thinking about it now that idea sucks.
---
Yea no way they'd let you keep your stuff if you're the one that DCs, otherwise everyone will bring pink/purple stuff in game and once things get ugly they'll just DC and keep everything.
---
Wait for them to fix audio, then post this again.
---
Why would you repost this from this subreddit
---
What‚Äôs up with the audio
---
I'm at Freddy number 10 currently, but I still think that his power is so clunky and has so many crippling situations that he'll benefit from the rework. Could it be fixed with a series of tweaks and updates? most probably, but instead we're getting a new power that I'm confident will still be just as fun.
---
Give me bikini amanda and speedo michael and freddy.
---
Exactly but i did some searching and i think they do lose things after a patch cause they used to do it to keep their stuff but its fixed now.
---
There is random sound occlusion on every map. Some worse than others eh: the new cold wind loops block sound completely.
---
Brilliant
---
I would kill the first person I see if it got me bikini Amanda.
---
*looks in mirror*
---
FUCK.
---
Only with a purple or red/pink key also like to add that opening an exit gate has been changed so its 30 seconds to open one, this is why remember me was changed instead of making the exit gate take some ridiculous amount of time to open it only goes up to 16 seconds so with remember me at max stacks it would take around 45/46 seconds to open a door. Blood warden is used a little bit more because of this since you can hook someone when the timer is low and its gonna get you a good number of kills because they cant get out.
---
Yup, and you need audio as Spirit so I would just wait. Stridor does not solve audio that is missing entirely.
---
He did. We weren't a SWF so kinda felt bad for not trying to heal him but then seen the unbreakable. He said he had to dead hard to get out.
---
Well they decrease it even further
---
But adrenaline allows for amazing plays if you have Comms, eg team mate is hooked I told my friend to go for the save because the doc was face camping so he ran in. Took a hit and then unhooked him. I popped his adrenaline and we all got out because of it . The difference between adrenaline and wake up is that adrenaline has a lot of situations were it can benefit the whole team while wake up is a niche perk
---
fuck
---
On a side note: it might also be seen as *those toxic survivors refusing to leave*. I've seen a lot of such posts here
---
I agree, t bagging can be bm. Pallet looping is part of the game, find ways to counter it. Flashlight saves, using flashlights at pallets is part of the game. Flashlight clicking or multiple flashlight saves can be bm. I don‚Äôt get your point? Why does it matter whether survivors are scared of killers? Killers have good perks survivors as well. I think it‚Äôs all a matter of skill. I don‚Äôt agree that survivors are OP tho.
---
Yeah, I run it on a couple survivors because it's nice to be able to see the gates and it's meant the split-second difference between opening a gate and escaping or getting killed a decent handful of times. It's not super strong or meta but it makes for good tense plays from time to time, which makes it fun enough to earn it's keep imo.
---
I guess I'm just showing my age but I also have a potato computer and run dbd on lowest settings and it looks impressive to me.
---
Not an issue in CS:GO even on pings 100-150.
---
I still gave you a helpful advice. Adrenaline fixes your problem. it makes you save and allows you to look around. don't get used to having wake up, because you'll never get rid of it this way
---
You're not exactly proving OP wrong here. All you're saying is "it used to be the other way around", which makes it seems like you think this is.. justice.. ? then. If you're not trying to say this, please let me (and others) know.
---
As for the 
---
&gt;BBQ and NOED are not overpowered
---
I completely agree. Neither are super problematic if you know how to spot and counter them. Noed is simply "cleanse all totems" and bbq and chili is a very simple "relocate approximately 5seconds after someone got hooked". 
---
That being said, I do agree with OP that the survivor's equivalents are significantly worse. Wglf is basically a wasted perk to farm BP. Hope is wasted in general
---
Agreed. It would make chases very unfun if they have sprinto butsto. About to get a hit? Nah new vigil buff popped that exhaustion. I think for vigil they should do it where for every team mate around you get a 20% speed buff stackable to 60% gives you more options if a killer is playing very aggressive but the killer will be able to figure it out. Plus it forces you to stay close to your team if you want the whole benefit. Maybe my numbers are weak so if it was stackable to 100% and you automatically counted for 25% this would allow for some creative builds that actually work .
---
Man those second clip survivors were boosted. That was so easily avoidable
---
From Happy Deathday? How would they make him different from legion and Ghostface? Cause you can't incorporate the Groundhog's Day stuff from the movie, which is it's defining feature.
---
"Comedy"
---
Drop Botany Knowledge and Stake Out. Replace one of them with an Exhaustion Perk (probably Balanced Landing), and the other with another Perk of your choice. I‚Äôve found Decisive Strike to be really helpful at lower ranks (I wouldn‚Äôt play at rank 15 without it personally), and Windows of Opportunity is always nice if you‚Äôre having trouble making chases longer.
---
Self Care is a touchy one. I personally don‚Äôt run it because I find healing myself to take too long when you could just do gens, but if you‚Äôre not great at looping for a while, you should probably keep it on and heal up so you don‚Äôt immediately go down. If you choose to take it off, again, just pick something that fits your playstyle. Recently I‚Äôve been running Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, Windows of Opportunity, ans Decisive Strike (surprise lol) but it ultimately comes down to taste.
---
Spine Chill, Mettle of Man, Borrowed Time, and Quick &amp; Quiet are all pretty decent at around that rank IMO. (And Diversion :p)
---
I run spine chill. It can 100% help you avoid chases. If you are getting into chases you need a couple of pallet slaps. Two hook rescues and two gens completed will make you pip you need to heal 2 times as well and heal your team mates. Just try doing two of each.
---
I like how it has nothing to do with DbD besides that logo
---
Put traps on random/unexpected places. Experienced survivors will expect traps on loops or common paths :)
---
Quentin cus he‚Äôs a cute little gremlin. Nah, he‚Äôs got the best prestige clothes and I actually get decent usage out of his perks Wake Up and Pharmarcy
---
Nurse, because I initially played without buying DLC so she was free, she was the one that scared me the most as far as appearance and she looks like a Silent Hill nurse.
---
Jake! Because he‚Äôs cute, duh :p
---
On the Killer side, Spirit. I won a tournament that gave me a free Chapter as a reward and I wanted Diversion, so I got Shattered Bloodline. I knew that Spirit was considered one of the better Killers, so I decided to give it a shot, and I absolutely sucked with her. I fell in love with her aesthetic, though, and a few YouTube videos later I realised her mindgame potential, and I‚Äôve stuck with her ever since.
---
I really don't think that people would find it strange that the killer with the ability to lay down beartraps would be called the trapper
---
Pig is so rare these days cause ppl just play the better killers...respect dude.
---
Its from the dbd launch trailer 
---
link : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGhIXLO3ul8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGhIXLO3ul8)
---
I like just bought the pig but yeet
---
So, should I delete this or something?
---
I love Piggy üê∑ and am happy to die by her hand anytime
---
either between ash or david and I just find them to be cool dudes
---
I only have 2 perks cause I just bought her
---
david king because he looks like Logan with his beard
---
I‚Äôve seen it off and on because my fiends I was playing with thought I stopped running it suddenly. Other bugs to know about right now:
---
- DS not working despite hitting the skill check and even hearing the acknowledgement noise of hitting it. 
---
- Killers AND Survivors are getting stuck INSIDE pallets with no way out unless pallet is broken again. (so if it happens to you as Killer, your game is over)
---
- Balanced Lansing still only proc‚Äôs like 50% of the time and now its back to delaying and procing too late. 
---
- I had Adrenaline not proc in one game tonight despite not being in a deep wound or broken effect. 
---
- A friend‚Äôs Deliverance also didn‚Äôt work in one game tonight.
---
Pig because I like being able to sneak around and jumpscare the shit out of people, also I enjoy using up all my beartraps early on since it'll usually keep the survivors busy for a bit. There's nothing as satisfying for me as ambushing a group of survivors working on a gen and watching them scatter. I mean, I also enjoy Pig for other reasons but that's entirely unrelated
---
When I play Killer I instantly hook the person who kobe'd again. 
---
Same goes,when I play survivor,because no one should care about it.
---
That's me everytime there's ruin
---
When there's not tho...
---
It's NOT a event item. Its a diffferentrarity Map offering . They canstill be used,but are retired and will never show up  in a bloodweb
---
I got bbq lvl3  for Doctor in level 20
---
I main Ace because i made him Pink Guy, more or less
---
for killer i never really just had one killer as a main but the three most leveled killers of mine are Legion, Spirit and Hillbilly so i guess those would be my mains
---
Fucker got what he deserved.
---
why thank you for the admiration.
---
"Year 4" will be from June 2019 - June 2020; just as "Year 1" was June 2016 - June 2017, "Year 2" was June 2017 - June 2018 and "Year 3" was June 2018 - June 2019.
---
If they stick to the same, "one Chapter every (approx.) 12 weeks as in Year 3, it could go: 
---
Chapter 13 - 3rd of September 2019.
---
Chapter 14 - 26th of November 2019.
---
Chapter 15 - 18th of February 2020.
---
Chapter 16 - 12th of May 2020.
---
I think it was pretty much just doing matter of the wrong place wrong time.
---
The Entity was taking in Frank when the others followed behind.
---
Interestingly enough just like with Rin The Entity doesn't seem opposed to changing its plans on the spot when it knows this is an opportunity. Remember The Entity initially planned to take Rin's father until it saw she had a lot more rage and hatred in her that it could use to its advantage.
---
It was most likely the same with the other members of the legion it is only initially planned on taking Frank but 3 other candidates who were easily manipulated and controllable by Frank came along so it pluck them up too.
---
Well I'm not have the impression that they are fused into one body like some people as the Devs  seem to be talk about them during the development stream more as group of four individual people who alternate between going in trials rather than one body constantly switching forms.
---
As long as he has to find people (which is already harder to do his shit dreamworld fog) then cant even do anything until they're asleep, he will be the worst killer. Wraith gets the sneak up AND can hit them within a second. Pig doesnt have to wait at all and has game slowing traps. Doctor can deny pallets and vaults and has unmatched survivor tracking, freddy cant even see as well as base killers, let alone find survivors like doctor can. Doctor can know full map away where all 4 survivors are just because of the fake doctor auras lol. 
---
And best slugger? Are you fucking kidding? Lol he cant even stop someone from finishing a heal until they fall asleep 7 seconds later rofl. Sure he can find them after slugging, but Deerstalker can do that too and doctor also can always find slugs.
---
I dont think it's an intentional mechanic, just a side effect of their shitty coding when it comes to players disconnecting.
---
How many times have you been slugged? How many times have you had a gen explode letting the killer know where you are? Extreme outliers don‚Äôt make a perk worth running over other perks that cover situations that aren‚Äôt extreme outliers
---
No, not that one. That one has a colored mask, this one is white.
---
For killer it is the hag and the spirit. It is fun to mindgame with the spirit and to zoom around the map, and the hag because she is a mix of nurse, the spirit and trapper.
---
Survivor is Kate, because Kate.
---
Legion is next! I might do survivors not sure yet though
---
Isn't Haggonfield killer-sided?
---
Hag-gonfield.
---
You should have recorded this lmao
---
They really should buff wake up, espacially considering the endgame collapse update. Maybe decreasing the time to open a gate by 50% instead of lousy 15%
---
Thank you. Since I‚Äôm not the best looper I think I‚Äôll keep self care. I was running botany knowledge because I thought it helped you to heal others and yourself faster but I will swap it out for balanced landing.
---
Which is exactly why I've used terms such as "small suggestion" and "neat idea" instead of just screaming some bullshit like "KILLER IS SO FUCKING OP THE DEVS ARE BIASED BUFF THESE PERKS SURVIVOR IS UNPLAYABLE", and I doubt timmy is implying anything different.
---
I'll ask this again. Read the goddamn post.
---
Well it really depends. If it was a close game, a free hit is cool. But when the killer got shit on, they probably just want the survivors to leave
---
Now thats oddly adorable. I'll refer to Trapper as ''Chuckles'' from now on. As well as I will call Hillbilly ''Snuggles'' for no specific reason
---
When you complete generators and they whine ''gen rush'' lol.  
---
Sorry you can't handle a loss.
---
I did, and I asked a question. Why do we have to buff what is considered weak? Why does everything has to have its purpose?
---
Usually when survivors were better than me, I take off a hat and do some moonwalk for them. But me is me, and those occasions are pretty rare tbh so I don't get a lot of frustration.
---
It is tho, you need to pick them up from lockers
---
Only if the last survivor hasn't been toxic all match.
---
Definitely a time zone thing.
---
My Steam (Oceanic region) says that the past six Chapters were released on Wednesdays.
---
The Saw Chapter was released on the 24th of January, 2018.
---
The Curtain Call Chapter was released on the 13th of June, 2018.
---
The Shattered Bloodline Chapter was released on the 19th of September, 2018.
---
The Darkness Among Us Chapter was released on the 12th of December, 2018.
---
The Demise of the Faithful Chapter was released on the 20th of March, 2019.
---
The Evil Dead Chapter(Paragraph?) was released on the 3rd of April, 2019. 
---
All six dates are Wednesdays. It makes sense though, because Australia is almost a full day ahead of North America (where BHVR is based), so it would've likely been Tuesday for them when the chapters are dropped.
---
Regardless, when I made my original post, I was referring to my own time zone. I will make sure to clarify that now.
---
r/UnexpectedQueen
---
Not a bad idea.   Unfortunately head on rarely works that buffing it isn‚Äôt even worth it at this point
---
Cause some people like variety? Not everyone enjoys running the same 4 meta perks their entire DBD career?
---
Dying faster to find a new game?
---
I used to get frustrated when I lost games really hard. Until I realized that it's actually just the awful balance of the game because it's intended to be fun and casual, *not competitive*. I've since switched to Nurse and losing is actually more fun than winning now, oddly enough
---
Finally that trapper tee-shirt makes sense. It says "the chuckling killer" which I found odd since I'd associate that more with the clown. Are those weird grunts in the lobby supposed to be chuckles, and is that why one of his head cosmetics is a weird twisted mouth sharp tooth clown mask?
---
Its not like we didnt know, this is just an ordinary inside leak.
---
Spirit, for killer. 
---
The way she looks, sounds, ability, speed. She‚Äôs, to me, the perfect killer.  So many different things you can do with her. 
---
Jane and Kate, for survivor. 
---
Both have pretty mediocre perks but I decided to main Kate because of her tattoos and sounds she makes. When Jane came out I loved her. She looks the most like me.
---
She‚Äôs so damn fun to play. Good job!
---
your typical reddit killer OMEGALUL
---
If you don't already know which killer you should use for this, then you don't even have the brain capacity to down anyone to camp.
---
yep although I don't find any use the of crouching cept like the start of the game
---
Before the Remember Me nerf I ran:
---
Remember Me, Nurses, Thanatophobia, Wildcard. Red Paint Brush and either Class Photo or Pill Bottle. Spend the whole game beating the obsessions ass and then when you get your full stacks of Remember Me you can dispose of them, which MUST be done before gates are powered. Use Paintbrush to sneak up on survivors and put them to sleep because by the time you‚Äôre detected it is too late. Class Photo helps you then find all other survivors. Basically just spend the game keeping everyone one asleep and injured and you‚Äôre good. NEVER tunnel someone until they are dead on hook. USE THEM. Someone was farmed in front of you? Put both survivors to sleep (assuming the rescuer isn‚Äôt already), slug the farmed survivor and chase the new one. Someone usually will come pick that person up. That‚Äôs a total of 3 people not doing Gens, which bought you massive amounts of time. Discordance helps you find groups which is ideal. Surveillance is good for patrolling when there‚Äôs only a few survivors left and also gives you and idea of where people are and keep going back to. Nurses boosts your Aura reading which is one of the best things you can do for Freddy. Thanatophobia isn‚Äôt the strongest but buys precious time because people are always so desperate to heal against Freddy if they are asleep and not in dream state. 
---
I force survivors to trade hooks. Don‚Äôt camp, and don‚Äôt tunnel (other than to smack the obsession and make sure they are already dead on next hook early. The point is to buy yourself time to prepare, and not be afraid of Gens getting done. With End Game it‚Äôs harder, so I make sure I know where either hatch or the remaining survivors all are before gates are powered or last survivor standing. 
---
The last wildcard perk slot changes depending on how I feel or what I‚Äôm planning. 
---
Here are some of the good ones I switch between:
---
- BBQ (any extra aura reading is great for Freddy), 
---
- Rancor (used to dispose of the Obsession quickly but a risk. If you plan on running a Rancor &amp; RM combo you MUST make sure you find the Obsession ahead of time and are near them already when the final Gen is finished or you risk them getting away and to a gate in time. And therefore the whole plan is a waste)
---
- Iron Madien (Good for low level/rank Freddy plays. Everyone is always trying to hide in lockers from two specific killers. Freddy and The Doctor. This helps you to at least find them if not get that down with the exposed status. Not always reliable at high rank.)
---
- Make Your Choice (Great for forcing hook trades. But I prefer to drag chases out personally because points)
---
- Monitor &amp; Abuse (Like extending aura reading, ANYTHING that lowers a Freddy‚Äôs terror radius is helpful.) 
---
- Pop Goes The Weasle (If you‚Äôre getting Gen rushed too fast, this can help you buy time to get your obsession stacks) 
---
- Dying Light (Another good one to combo with RM. but you must kill your obsession before the final two Gens are done for it to really be effective IMO.)
---
There‚Äôs more but you get the picture. I frequently use Discordance in my wildcard a lot right now.
---
Maybe it's a weird psychological test to rule out tough survivors. Chicken is associated with cowardice = an easy kill. Beef is associated with being strong and tough = seasoned steak/survivor. Maybe I'm thinking about this too much.
---
I always thought that too! Hope they make that a thing, the small touches make a big difference. I was so happy when they made it easier to switch between characters and disabled accidental last minute switches.
---
I'm on PS4, is it cool if I just screenshot each item and compile them into an imgur?
---
Wow me
---
wasted
---
Best feeling after having tbaggers and you kill all of them but leave one just to toy with them and close hatch right infront of them. Ahh karma is great.
---
Throw dying light on there for extra seasoning.
---
Too late my dude : \^ P
---
Johnny Vs Timmy Vs Spike isn't really applicable to a perk equivalent of Silvercoat Lions.
---
Mark Rosewater himself, the guy who came up with Timmy Johnny and Spike, notes that boring designs that speak to no one can exist and shoild be avoided.
---
Johnny wants a perk that lets them express themselves and do things that force people to notice them or lets them otherwise feel unique. No Mither is a Johny perk. Stake Out is a Johny Perk. Wake up doesn't express anything interesting about yourself.
---
It also doesn't help Spike prove their skill or Timmy feel something. Spike wants adrenaline for the insane value. Timmy wants hope because ZOOMIIIIIES. The opening gate .5 seconds faster is a spike effect that isn't good, and the speed boost is a worse version of more Timmy Esque speedboosts.
---
The perk exists for nothing, for no one. It isnt just that it is bad, No Mither is awful but shouldn't be changed as its this game's One With Nothing. But perks that don't have any hypothetical value or home or identity are just a wasted design.
---
I use it for my Ash build. It helps me figure out if someone is worth a risk to save and I also like knowing where the killer is.
---
Those are not exhaustion perks, my man
---
I completely agree with speed and charge time add-ons being her best üòÅ.
---
Can relate
---
I'm not complaining, and as I said, I don't use hope. What op is pointing out that killers have identical perks, but with a little addition. That seems kinda unbalanced and could merit a change. Don't get upset right away
---
She would've easily escape there but nooo, she had to teabag. Classic
---
Myers - Stalk and Insta down multiple survivors quickly
---
Ghostface - Stalk and Insta down a single survivor... and teabags
---
Myers was always gonna lose.
---
Good choice on playing as her!! She‚Äôs my absolute favorite killer to play as.    She is full of mind games, don‚Äôt hesitate to mess around with faking phasing and what not. 
---
What my consistent build is, is Ruin, BBQ, Surveillance, and enduring/monitor and abuse. Although, enduring isn‚Äôt the greatest perk on her because she is anti loop, I enjoy it because if I‚Äôm hit I can either a) pretend to phase and b) quickly phase after the stun and catch up with any survivor. 
---
Monitor is great and I won‚Äôt bother saying why, another person in your thread already mentioned it and it‚Äôs spot on. 
---
Bbq because well, bloodpoints. But since she is a fast killer you can get to the other side of the map in a jiffy. 
---
SURVEILLANCE IS ALMOST A MUST. She is wicked when it comes to gen pressure!! Have that, discordance or pop goes the weasel. Maybe even all three.  
---
I love using prayer beads and mother-daughter ring. So fast and so quiet. Nothing makes me more excited than to pull people off of gens. 
---
Pretend to phase often unless you see survivors not falling for your tricks. More often than not they panic and will quite literally run towards you if they think you‚Äôre phasing. 
---
Don‚Äôt get stridor. Once you practice, hearing footsteps, breathing, and injured survivors will be a breeze. Stridor almost makes it seem like survivors are closer to you than they appear. 
---
I suggest going on YouTube and watching game play on her!! She is so fun and amazing.  Good luck to you!
---
Cool concept, but GIMME THEM TOES
---
It's actually very common in csgo to get killed around a corner because of ping
---
In all honesty, a couple of the perks that are considered garbage or low tier authentically let you escape a number of games.
---
Like, I've only run it a couple of times but Hope has saved me more then once and my friend who liked running garbage perks when we played was saved countless times by it.
---
Yeah, a 7% speed boost REALLY isn't much. But those times where you BARELY get hit dropping a pallet, or BARELY get hit vaulting a window. Hope would have gotten you through without taking the hit. It also somewhat counters NOED's I think 4% speed boost.
---
Cherry blossom is perfectly fine, Yakuyoke makes it so she basically doesn't have a cooldown if you use the power in bursts, Wakizashi Saya makes it so you can completely mess up your power, end up miles away from the target and still get a hit because of the speed boost.
---
Yeah prayer beads are nutty.
---
d a r n
---
Good job! Pig is really underestimated by survivors so it is really easy to catch them off guard sometimes. Especially if you pretend not to see them when crouching past then going in for the kill!
---
Not really, even 2000 hours Huntress mains complain about buildings like the buildings from Haddonfield or Springwood, where survivors can loop them for 1 minute, especially if they have Balance Landing, just to finally get pallet stunned. Also, even Huntress mains like Scott Jund said to not chase survivors on buildings like Fractured Cowshed as Huntress, because with your 110% movement speed, they will loop you for 5 gens.
---
This belongs on r/quityourbullshit
---
I main meg because when I got the game for free on PS4 my friend said she was easiest to start with. Got her urban evasion and used sprint burst.... 
---
now ive become a lot less immersive and lot better! 
---
And pig because im in love with amanda young..... and im a bi gal who wants to smooch her
---
Adam in his black suit for a stealth option, Kate because she is a sexy badass and David with his red jeans and vest top cause he is always down to clown with the killer. 
---
Plague because she is just fun and Freddy because he is the man and someday he will be great again.
---
Can you explain why not hag?
---
ILL TAKE 10 OF THE SHAPE ONE
---
Honestly, Hope is perfectly fine. It actually is a really good perk for end game, having that extra 7% movement speed is tremendously underrated. The only issue with hope is that it gets overshadowed by much better perks. 
---
The buff that you suggested is way too strong, it would turn into a thoughtless counter to NOED, nobody would care about totems (exacerbating genrushing) they would just run hope. Not to mention how much it would hurt Billy, Leatherface, Myers, and even Ghostface. It would basically be a perk that makes you immune to these killers powers and would fuck over any other instadown perks too like Rancor, Hex: Devour Hope, MYC (this one especially because if your able to stay away from the hook in the end game then that's great. Most of the time you have no choice but to camp the hook in end game). Overall it would hurt too many killers unfairly and would hurt perk diversity (and possibly killer diversity) way more than it would help anything.
---
My idea for WGLF has always been 1 of 2 things. 
---
1. Either it stays how it is, but adds the We'll Make It effect (in which case We'll Make It would need to be removed). In this idea, WGLF would reward you for playing altruistically by letting you heal faster and it would reward you with extra points for doing it safely.
---
2. It stays how it is now, but it goes back to the way it used to be, letting each stack grant 50% more BP up to 200%. This idea could work because it would give survivors more opportunities to get BP. As we all know the BP gains as surv suck, so this would make getting points a lot easier, at the cost of not having any other effect.
---
The only problem with your idea is that Breakdown has the same effect. Plus honestly, I don't think many people, myself included, would care that much.
---
Hopefully when they inevitably change the system to punish DCing in an effort to fix the health of the game, you either get over your entitlement or bounce.
---
Survivors with good hearts will just leave instead of waiting for a last hit.
---
Wow look at all those killers. Not a single survivor insight
---
Honestly I think DbD has a good balance for an assymetrical competitive game, I have fun playing both killer and survivor. Rarely play Nurse because meh. But it's all a matter of opinions
---
Well, purple add-ons should be strong, but not broken, and I think her purple add-ons are strong, but not too broken, beside of Prayer Beads. But you right, Wakizashi Saya can carry Spirits who are not on point with phase walking and prediction.
---
Now this does put a smile on my face
---
The meaning behind a t-bag is still that you're putting your balls on the other persons face. :/
---
True true.
---
Thats kinda like identity v, the "the main menu" is a interactive room within a mansion where u physically move a character to each game function. Its pretty neat
---
Same here, can't get past rank 10 with Freddy, but can quite comfortably reach higher ranks with other killers.
---
no
---
He gonna be the ultimate t-bagger because hes so fast at it
---
I get where you're coming from, it does make sense. I guess it can't be that way due the asymmetrical nature of the game. 4 survivors = the power of 1 killer (theoretically). If all 4 survivors ran those perks with the suggested buff, then the combined power of the survivors would be greater than the killer. It's a tough balancing act, but it's also a delicate one that can tip too far to one side if the developer isn't careful. As a survivor I like you're suggesting, as an overall player I feel the balance is fair as it is now. Good suggestion though.
---
Buy license dlc
---
Tegen you can buy the other characters with shards
---
Well, let's call it crouching in quick succession then. Just replace my mention of teabagging with that.
---
Survivor mains, bitching that it's too hard to open an exit gate when the hatch is shut, while simultaneously shittalking perks that would speed up opening an exit gate. I love it.
---
Tru3Talent. He is really good in my opinion as all killers and survivor. By watching him he's taught me alot.
---
Montos Spoopy Spirit Builds
---
"Let's just undo balance changes that gave killers an extra kick in the balls when they were already struggling, because I can't get over a nerf from a year ago!"
---
If I may ask, how did you transfer this gameplay recording if not from YouTube or Twitter ?

---
I would say knowing who u face is a good start. Knowing what a survivor will do in certain situations will help you outplay them as spirit. Whether they fall for the fake phase, whether they go for pallets or walk away when u do phase. Things like that.
---
Standing still on top of the hatch as cloaked wraith and kicking it shut when the survivor is almost there
---
Or let us create our own. Pick-n-mix your favourite clothing items into sets to easily switch between them whenever you please.
---
You can use her crouching to try to mindgame survivors in certain loops
---
Had a game as plague and a survivor hid in the left one of those two lockers by the downstairs gen. Around the gate that opens once gen is done.
---
I couldn't get him out... Open the door, see him staring back at me and then just close it right back up...tried numerous times. 
---
He sat there all game until EGC got him. On PS4.
---
Yeah, like it fits the idea of wanting to be unique, but it lacks the expression and showiness. Like someone sees "Pop Goes the Weasel" go off and they're like "oh shit, don't see that every day and this gen just became a lot harder to finish," someone gets a gate open with "Wake Up" and everyone goes "eh, they probably would've got that anyway." Hell, people see someone's aura with it and they probably don't even realise why.
---
Adrenaline is but my question was about why the hell to nerf exhaustion perks when they aren't gamebreaking like MoM and Adrenaline
---
Trapper and Dwight.
---
Trapper simply because I grew tired of people trying to loop me. Now instead I use traps to do all the dirty work for me. I don't really chase survivors, just kind of lead and push them into traps. End time is prime time.
---
Dwight because I liked his perk build I made initially with him. I've also found a good outfit that works to camouflage him better with most maps. But importantly, he's fast with Gens and easy bait for killers when my teammates need a distraction.
---
Hybridpanda is pretty decent.
---
Suicide booth
---
You forgot clown UwU
---
A can hear the leather
---
&gt; Because it's not decent, just straight up bad. In exchange for playing 98% of the match with only 3 perks you gain the ability to open the Exit Gates 2 seconds faster.
---
I also think that it isn't a great perk but it does more than that.
---
It also shows you the exit gates constantly which can be handy if you are getting chased at the end and it also shows fellow survivors when you are opening a gate.
---
I don't usually do it for youtubers but it does go a long way for liking the videos on thier channel. If it weren't for YouTube being such a shitty website, they wouldn't have to beg. He probably noticed that when he said it, people actually did it so he started saying it more. And at least he's only saying like the video with a funny saying here and there instead of what every generic YouTuber saying "Hey guys, remember to like the video, click that subscribe button, hit that little bell to get notifications and let me know what you think in the comments down below!".
---
I legit think he works hard to make content. I watch him a lot with my girlfriend and I really fucking like how he always explains the perks AND add-ons in the beggining of videos because I don't have to explain them for her.
---
He puts work in to make a decent video, the least I can do is like the video no matter if he asks for a like.
---
the suicide booth from futurama

Thanks for your input. I agree Hope is underrated and I've seen how strong it can if you know how to loop well. As for your suggestion of the buff being too strong, you've still got to take into account survivors might not always be healthy when the exits are powered (yes, I realise Adrenaline exists), and players might still break totems anyway to save TEAMMATES from a potentional NOED. Not to mention survivors never really bother breaking totems anyway. Devour Hope and Haunted Grounds will NOT last until endgame so they're out of the equation, and MYC and Rancor aren't really that meta right now. This would really only be a threat to NOED, Leatherface and Myers (since Billy can easily end a match before endgame). Maybe this could be a bit more balanced if the timer was reduced to 90 seconds or even 60 seconds, but I get where you're coming from here.
---
As for WGLF I kinda feel stupid for not realising Breakdown had an aura reading feature until you just told me, so fair play. Your second suggestion does actually sound pretty good though since survivor BP gain is pretty shit, and getting stacks does kinda force you to farm survivors so it would be nice to just receive a better reward at the perk's expense.
---
Again, thanks for the response!
---
They don't need healing perks when they rush gens with Adrenaline üòÇ. 
---
In plus, I think I put We'll Make It and Botany Knowledge pretty high.
---
David; because he‚Äôs the first one I‚Äôve played. I learned the game from practicing and just using him. Now he has all the perks and prestige three times! 
---
Bing Bong; because he reminds me so much of my friend haha
---
I kind of wish they add the old freddy so you can choose
---
Freddy does not need to wait if you use range addons.
---
The time it takes to walk up to them is the time it takes for them to fall asleep.
---
With that you can also get a more reliable first hit than the wraith because with wraith as long as you stay near a pallet or have sprint burst he is not gonne get a first hit (yes he can bodyblock but he can not bodyblock everything)
---
While with Freddy they do not know where you are coming from and if you use the transitionmindgame then they will just give a free hit and sometimes waste a pallet in the meantime.
---
You can not say that the Doctor is better at tracking than Freddy, maby at the start but he needs to shock them while they can just snap out of it in a few seconds.
---
With slugging they usually won't even get the chance to heal if you keep track of where they are.
---
Freddy is a direct upgrade from the doctor if you play him right.
---
Piggy because she was the one who got me into DBD (i'm a huge fan of Saw series), also i main Myers and Freddy (i'm a sucker for the movies). Kate (because she's lovely, stunning and she gives me Miley Cyrus vibes), Ace (charming guy), Adam (a shame he's a fictional character 'cause he's hot), Jake (i like his lore) and Laurie (after Sidney and Nancy, she's my favorite final girl)
---
Only Freddies do that, everyone else doesn't. Freddy deserves to be buffed!
---
IconicCrux meant changing your desktop resolution manually before launching DbD, using your GPU control panel.
---
Make the other killersssssss
---
A lot of people tag on tenacity because Unbreakable is better, and most people don‚Äôt wanna use TWO perk slots for perks that rarely last for more than the time it takes for the killer to break the pallet: it‚Äôs most useful when you have No Mither, but then who is honestly going to pick you up?
---
I‚Äôd give you gold if I have any so instead have a seal of approval from David King himself.
---
I feel your pain brother. Get a 4 man Mori kill to really piss‚Äôem off lol
---
I hope the rework makes him less annoying to play against.
---
Same for default outfit and various outfits that were given for free (e.g. L4D skins).
---
It does start that way, but with practice, he gets easy rather quickly and is well worth learning.  Just use the chainsaw at shorter ranges for landing hits.  If it looks like they're about to turn a corner, don't bother using it unless you know you can beat them to it.  And I wouldn't bother using it during loops at all until you're really comfortable with it.
---
If you think you're about to smack into something, let it go, the stun duration will be far shorter.  Some maps will just straight up handicap you (hospital) and others will let you go flying to the other end (corn fields) and there aren't many things more gratifying than landing a hit on someone from an across the map chainsaw sprint.  
---
His map pressure is probably second only to nurse or a decked out hag.  Trapper is easier to play, but I highly recommend learning Billy.  He's easier to play than you might think.
---
I, for one, am perplexed.
---
Agreed. Thought this was weird.
---
Same deal with the Legacy gear, as well as the default outfits each character comes with.
---
Idk I know it‚Äôs not powerful and I don‚Äôt run it often but I think it‚Äôs really neat
---
I can hear the DC noise now
---
Spirit is also considered one of the best killers, and can actually end chases without even chasing. She's not one of the killers that are struggling normally against competent survivors due to lack of pressure. Her add-ons take her from good tier to god tier too
---
Nurse: Because I find her power very rewarding. 
---
Jeff: We have the same name.
---
Spine Chill it's actually amazing + it's a great counter for Spirit
---
It's a 50/50, but if I don't check on it, I won't even have a chase going. 90% of the time I don't spawn on it, someone else will be right by it anyways
---
I thought it was just me lol
---
And what if someone's pc crashes and it's not because "oh look at the map"? Should you still get banned 30 mins?
---
For a moment I thought the Shroud is used there to get the Black Box Obsession to disconnect thinking it's a Mori. A Mori is definitely better with that setup than the Shroud, though - even if they do get woken up, you know their approximate location and will find them quickly enough, usually.
---
Agreed on Discordance. It's a better tracking perk on Freddy than Whispers or BBQ, I'd say, yet BBQ obviously has that neat BP thing going for it, and Freddy usually needs chase perks too direly to have two slots to invest into tracking. Or you use Class Photo and don't need any tracking perks.
---
The one thing I find annoying with Discordance is that it gets worse as you level it up. It's a lot better to know if one survivor got off the generator every 8 seconds than every 12 seconds. It's 4 seconds lost information at rank 3 compared to rank 1. Wish they would fix that.
---
We don‚Äôt have to. They said it coming in the next content update.
---
That‚Äôs not very cash money of you.
---
Survivor: has adrenaline
---
I love using that with the spirit With surveillance &amp; Corrupt Intervention, &amp; ruin, they slow the game down a lot. Just keep an eye on your totem and I get at least 2 insta kills almost every game,  4th perk either BBQAC  for bps or NA for brutality, The Spirit is the best killer in the game, 4 me anyway, I can‚Äôt remember last time I lost a match, had 4 man sacrifice for 4 games in a row earlier &amp; finally got my first perfect game, 8K all 4 categories, 221 points away from 100k bps.
---
Lol nice, should be kill meg lol
---
Hell... yeah... POOLPARTY MYERS!!!
---
Dbd will never be accepted in China lol, would need a complete rework, even Identity VV has been suffering censorship in content.
---
Yeah, as a killer main, it really comes down to the hatch. Once I close the hatch, 9/10 times it‚Äôs game over for survs, despite the door changes.
---
Yeah the grind was horrendus though so I don't blame you. I was at the point of presting my trapper (And close with wraith too) but I didn't want to lose all my perks I took sooo long to get. I'd say now I regret that too, but I lost the legacy I did get anyway.
---
It can be done its just hard. A tactic is not to look for the hatch and instead camp a door so you start opening it the moment the endgame begins.   
---
Someone in another thread put it best in my eyes. Your not supposed to escape easily, at that point your losing, 3 people are dead so it should be a slim chance you escape and survive. You still have a chance its just difficult and the way it was before it was more in survivors favour which doesn't make sense because the killer is winning so they shouldn't be handicapped. Plus I find the hatch often spawns close to the last survivor, in a game yesterday it spawned under my feet lol.
---
But then the killer isn't doing well, and thus I don't think they deserve the merciless they absolutely didn't earn
---
I mean it's like adrenaline. It's only good for end game
---
I‚Äôm pissed they haven‚Äôt reworked freddy yet, he‚Äôs my favorite character as far as who he is. I saw they reworked the legion, still sucks if u ask me. &amp; I‚Äôm still hopin ana praying for PINHEAD
---
Yeah nah. 
---
Ignore his stall, tracking, stealth and mind games. Cause "lol 7 seconds".
---
Progress halts to a crawl while in the dream state. To wake up and remove the 50% action speed penalty, you need to be hooked, which Freddy controls, be healed from the dying state, which a good Freddy will return to his slug and sleep both, be woken up by another survivor, which a good Freddy will go break chase to sleep both, or fail a skill check, which gives away your location and sets progress back. It can be easy to wake up, but it is just as easy to resleep them.
---
Once he finds you, you aren't losing him. Or at the least not easily. Plus if they are awake, they don't know where your at unless they hear the lullaby, which doesn't give away your location. But he can always see you, and if you're sleeping he can either see your aura or has a better built in Whispers. 
---
The fog, combined with his short height and the dream mist, gives him better mind games than most killers. This is ignoring his transition mind game. Also, who other than Nurse can consistently land a hit in 7 seconds? Cause every single killer outside of her needs the right situation to land that hit. Also, if you're not attempting the mind game during the transition if you plan on chasing them, you're doing it wrong. Mindlessly chasing one survivor and ignoring the others will get your ass handed to you.  
---
He is one of if not the best killers in all categories BUT chase, and he has better chase than killers like Trapper, Bubba, Plague, Wraith, and Doc. And you can argue a non-tier 3 Michael as well. That makes his chase mid tier at worst. He has better built in stall tha the rest of the cast, better stealth than the rest, and better tracking than the rest.
---
He ain't bad chief. Not bad at all.
---
Yeah, the kindergarten I worked in didn't really look like it was designed to be one, so much as repurposed into one, though I think that fits perfectly with a horror theme - Children play somewhere not really suitable for children, shit goes wrong and now you have a haunted place
---
I‚Äôm finding myself give the hatch less and giving the door more now. Something about Hag slapping the door down feels great. Sometimes I pretend to slam it shut in Bayonetta‚Äôs voice ‚ÄúNaughty Door.‚Äù
---
Pig and Hag. Pig for the stealthy aspects. Hag is fun to play, especially with the new Collapse. Nothing gives more joy than watching the last surv run over a trap, only for me to then teleport to them. It‚Äôs little moments of joy that keep me playing.
---
Even if we take away the prestiging, we still need the teachables, which is 16 characters to level 40. That's 440 levels for teachables alone. Even if you only prestige one character, that's another 10(They're already 40 from the teachable), then another 150 just to get to P3 level 50, and probably another 60 past that to get all perks, amounting to a grand total of 650 levels to get everything on one survivor. You could sort of cut it down with the ones you purchase in the shrine of secrets, but even if you get insanely lucky and get all three perks from one character, one week after the other, it's a minimum wait time of 3 weeks
---
The grind is absolutely insane on either ends. Killers having it worse doesn't make survivors have a good time
---
Killers with a soft heart and a low ranking like me have the problem that the survivors don't understand that they should use the fcking hatch.
---
Hag is pretty fun.
---
Doctor is not as great at bp farming as you think, Sure he get's a ton of Deviousness bp but after that he's just a regular killer in terms of Bp capability.
---
Godlike survivors would stomp a godlike freddy. The time spent transitioning alone, if you hook all survivors three times, is 84 seconds, which is kind of ridiculous
---
Lol well... ok, well OP... you *did* say beef.
---
She used to be one of the best killers in the game, now she‚Äôs just a mid teir killer which is really disappointing. Almost every change they have done to her has been a nerf, and she has not gotten any love in a while.
---
Yes stop playing on a toaster with Micky d wifi
---
So, know that this has happened, vhickenor beef?
---
Then combine it with Dead hard, Adrenaline or BT and you start to realize why the perk sucks so much.
---
It can be done but it is more killer sided honestly
---
Before EDC when i would get toxic 4 man even though im hooking and booking, i would down all then sit and not hook a single one, bleed the fuck out on the ground idc about the extra 4k sacrifice points.
---
My friend playing dbd with me for hes second match ever. Has no idea of any of the Dwight  memes etc. Decides to swap to a dwight becausw he was looking through the perks and realized  he could equip prove thyswlf and leader to buff me while he hides in a locker in range to trigger the perk. Rather then say helping on the gen.
---
Fucking dwights
---
You should have said Wake Up gang wake up
---
Killer is Freddy and Doc, but I like Pig and Legion post rework as well. Though I try to play all killers.
---
Survivor is Ace cause he's so damn smooth. Quentin and Tapp will be added once I get some more teachable because I enjoy NMOES and SAW. 
---
Huh, I guess I am a sucker for the SAW and NMOES DLC.
---
The mobile version is just a port, exactly like Fortnite
---
I can't be the only one that moves their head and shoulders forward as I am lunging at the survivor in game.
---
It gives me more range! :D
---
Look at his cute chubby belly c:
---
You aren't really supposed to take up long chases with Hag unless you have the chase area trapped. Hag is far more effective if you literally just teleport to 99% of your traps as soon as they are set off. You massively increase your map presence and get far more hits. So the point is that you're not really going to want to see people in the distance with BBQ and then slowly make your way over to them ( because remember, she is a 110% killer), but just lay traps in smart places and then wait for people to walk into them. Of course you can slowly go round and patrol gens, but if your traps are in smart places, you should have little-to-no downtime.
---
&gt;So does literally everyone think he sucks or is it just a meme?
---
Here's why he sucks.
---
A. His power is easy to negate and counter.
---
+ Self care? portable counter to his ability.
---
+ Gens? Your literal objective as survivor is a way to wake up.
---
+ Other survivors can wake you up.
---
+ Adrenaline / Insta heals wake you up.
---
B. His power actively gimps him in certain situations like defense.
---
Freddy is the worst killer for defense,
---
+ Have a hext totem? well hope you find someone before they find it because they will have more than enough time to cleanse it before you can sleep them.
---
+ Survivor running to the open gate and you have NOED? Well hope they're asleep already because you're shit out of luck.
---
+ Have a hooked survivor near the open the gate? well good luck preventing anyone from rushing the hook and rescuing them.
---
+ Endgame and theres only one survivor left? hope you find the trapdoor before they do because you can't grab them out of the animation and they can get a head start on opening the door before you can sleep them.
---
+ Have a injured survivor on the ground? well guess what? a healthy survivor/2 can literally heal the injured survivor preventing you from interacting with the downed survivor forcing you to sleep them to stop them.
---
+ The game can't distinguish between awake and sleeping survivors, so if you go to swing at a sleeping survivor the game can auto lock onto the awake one and make you miss your attack, on top of that the game also registers the "miss" as a hit forcing you to do a cool-down animation extending your time even longer. 
---
Freddy as a concept is cool but their execution was horrible and freddy is legit worse than other m1 killers because his power is literally "turn me into an m1 killer"
---
Yeah he‚Äôs cute üòç
---
So find the hatch before the killer does. If you find it first, you win, if they find it first, they probably win.
---
No thanks, survivors have enough in the way of fucking over the killer they don't need more.
---
I mostly play in psvr cinematic mode and have accidentally headbutted my wall when lunging once or twice
---
I love putting them into dying state with just enough time to grab-n-hook, Iv been meaning to make a video of situations like that,  start with that, then would be the survivor that forgot about the pigs trap killing them right before he escaped,  then would be the one I just got like an hour ago, exit gate open end game counting down &amp; having a pallet show down right in front of the exit, survivor with full health state &amp; both of us new I couldn‚Äôt hit her twice b4 she got out, there was 1 other survivor there that was injured so there trying every technique they can think of to get out and I realize I gave here a window and she jets to the exit, I said to my self DAMNIT, then 1 step from escaping BOOM endgame entity impale. I was a happy lad, then 1 of my favorites the exit hatch open and last survivor in the lead I saw her jump I hit the attack hoping to at least get points for 1 more hit. But NO grabbed her at the last second lol, I headed toward the closest hook spinning in circles all the way there. That would be a pretty good video &amp; Iv been wanting to make it but I‚Äôm to damn lazy lol
---
One more question, what sample size do you want? Is there a specific amount, or is anything good?
---
Mixture of low rank / it being a (Albeit toxic) legit strategy.
---
It is meant to be difficult. You failed 2 of your most important objectives, failed to get free escape, and you have only one chance left that is very difficult to achieve. If you fail 4 objectives, you should be dying.
---
As expected from a blind fanboy, have anything else to say as equally stupid as the last?
---
Because after you hook someone, 9/10 you want to lay a trap down by the hook to slow the rescue meaning the aura will be gone by then. Also hag is only 110% so even if you saw someone on the other side of the map, you still gotta gangster lean all the way over there and there‚Äôs no guarantee they‚Äôll still be there, especially because your primary mode of transportation is traps. 
---
It‚Äôs still good for bloodpoints, don‚Äôt get me wrong and hag can actually get a lot of points in many catagories, but more often than not, you either can‚Äôt capitalize on the info or are busy setting a trap to receive info.
---
You said "crybabies" look who is crying now cause sometimes people dc come on dude get over it if someone dcs and ur a killer just finish the match quickly and if ur survivor it's the same,dcing doesn't destroy the game so chill.
---
100% post game bloodpoints.
---
she doesn't benefit at all from BBQ (yeah, having 4 stacks is nice) because she's hella slow and you already have traps to find survivors (you'll better use MYC instead of BBQ), also you'll waste a perk slot 'cause you won't start walking on the other side of the map as Hag only to start a chase with a specific survivor
---
Museum sounds good.
---
It's almost as if this game is 4v1...
---
The buff is right next to him
---
It can get worse, the max is -157% in game resolution and oh boy
---
Freddy Krueger because he's an incredibly versatile yet difficult to play character killer with a very unique playstyle. He's also laughably underrated and a good Freddy can surprise a lot of survivors who are expecting a free win.
---
Tru3Talent is not good. Anytime he loses, he just shouts SWF on Comms. I watch and compete at the highest level in tournaments, and I have never seen Tru3Talent present or come close to winning. I can name about 50 players who would eat Tru3Talent for breakfast.
---
Tru3Talent is merely a streaming outlet for new players. The level of maturity and intelligence in the stream is akin to an elementary school class.
---
Zubat, ScottJund, ScorpionRulezMK, FunGoose, I would recommend FunGoose for the best educational, he has over 7,000 hours on Killer and 4K 39/40 games at Rank 1. I 4K about 75% of time at Rank 1 and those mentioned above are much higher than me. 
---
TheEntityLeftHand (aka Lefty), the list goes on, but True3Ass, Tru3Ass blows...
---
What about iridescent head on huntress and readhead's pinky finger on clown?
---
Finally balanced, like it always should have been !
---
Nice first perk. And your headed toward some good times Friend! I‚Äôm a spirit main. BEST killer in my opinion. I never lose with her with the build I got, using pudding or Party Streamers I get over 90k bps every game, last 4 games I played I got 4 man kill on each. Last night I got my first Perfect game 8k bps in all 4 categories, 200 points away from 100k bps. If u have trouble with her message me &amp; I‚Äôll throw tips ur way
---
I main Jane, and we all know the reason why
---
The pick them up and let them wiggel of, just to let the entity take them, disturbe them opening the exit gates until 1 1/2 Minuts are over ! Most toxic dicks cant take, what they dish out, so the dc, Laugh my ass off every time !
---
David because he has all perks and Ace because *slicc* cosmetics. Occasionally my P2 Claudette to flex and goof around.
---
For Killers I play usually Myers, Pig, Wraith and Trapper, because I'm crap at aiming (so Huntress, Clown, Billy and Nurse) and I'm pretty good at stealth, but after a lot of stealth games I just want to eat pallets and steamroll survivors head on (pun intended), thus Trapper. 
---
Also when I started I just played Hag and Doctor and got tired of them. Still have a special place for Hag. Doctor not so much.
---
Don't enjoy Legion and Bubba, don't have Plague and I play Freddy or Spirit every now and then to give it a try, fail miserably and come back to my mains.
---
Would like to level my Feng cause I like her sounds and get Plague to try her out. But I'm grinding for Spirit Fury on my lvl 50 Trapper.
---
It's too situational to use it in as a staple build.
---
This happened yesterday, except the pig didn't know about the nerf and waited for a survivor to crawl out :(
---
You need to double pip
---
she thicc
---
That‚Äôs some high-level Photoshop work.
---
No problem for the input, but I do have to say that I think you're very heavily downplaying how strong that hope buff would be.
---
&gt;Survivors might not always be healthy when the exits are powered (yes, I realise Adrenaline exists).
---
First of all multiple survivors being injured when the gates are powered is not that common, however even if it was you just undermined yourself by mentioning Adrenaline. Adrenaline doesn't just exist, it is extremely META. I play killer every day and I always assume that every survivor has Adrenaline and I'm very seldom wrong about that. Hell, I rarely don't use it as a survivor too. Adrenaline is one of the best perks in the entire game period. The instance that someone is still injured in the end game is already pretty rare but it would be non-existent with your version of hope.
---
&gt;Players might still break totems anyway to save TEAMMATES from a potentional NOED. Not to mention survivors never really bother breaking totems anyway.
---
This is kind of grasping at straws here. If a perfect guaranteed counter to NOED existed in the form of a perk that required zero effort to activate existed then everyone would just run it. If you get downed by NOED, then it's your own fault that you didn't run Hope. Also, let's be real, randoms solos aren't that altruistic (as in going out of their way to help the team outside of getting points from saves) As for SWF you bet your ass that every person is going to be running it. Totems outside of hexes would be pointless.
---
Another thing that is important to address is that without any sort of side-objective (getting rid of NOED) survivors wouldn't have to worry about looking for dull totems and they would just power through gens even more than they are now. If nobody did totems before then they certainly won't now.
---
&gt;Devour Hope and Haunted Grounds will NOT last until endgame so they're out of the equation, and MYC and Rancor aren't really that meta right now.
---
Two things
---
1. You're not entirely wrong about DH and HG. However, it guarantees that will not have any presence end game. I've had several games where survs were rushing the gens hard and I got my 3rd stack in end game and you started seeing people shit themselves and start dropping like flies. Same goes for haunted grounds. Nobody finds it or touches until end game and KABOOM (this is admittedly more rare than DH but still). Sure they are rare, but these unexpected twists are really fun to play against as a surv and they are incredibly exciting when they work as a killer. Hope would just shit on that completely and guarantee that nothing fun and expected like this could happen at all in end game.
---
2. It's not a great argument to say that because certain perks aren't meta then it's okay that this will hurt them. It only goes towards making them EVEN LESS meta. The MYC thing is extremely rare in end game but hell combo that with blood warden and a good hook spot and you don't have to camp the hook AND you have an opportunity to down someone faster too. Rancor may not be meta but it would be useless with your Hope buff. Everyone would run hope (I make no exaggeration when I say everyone) and therefore the instadown capability of rancor is gone and all it becomes is a mori perk that nobody (except for maybe spirit) would use. This causes even less perk diversity for killers because why combo STBFL and Rancor when rancor doesn't do anything. 
---
&gt;This would really only be a threat to NOED, Leatherface and Myers (since Billy can easily end a match before endgame).  
---
Billy CAN end a game very quickly but it's not fair to him or any killer to have their power completely deleted in the end game.  You agree that it affects Myers and Leatherface but do you not see that as a problem? That two killers who aren't as strong as billy have their powers deleted in the end game? That is not a minor thing at all. 
---
The real reason behind this idea is to counter NOED and while I think people throw more of a hissy fit about it than necessary I understand that is annoying as hell. However, you can't just have a perk that hurts several other killers by deleting their powers regardless of whether or not they were running NOED. Hurts perk diversity by making several other killer perks useless and creating two perks that every single survivor would run without any exception. All of this plus hurting killer diversity because coming back in the late/end game is a big part of playing anyone who is not top tier. This doesn't always mean NOED but it means playing the long game and having a back-up plan. This buff would remove that option from so many killers. It prompts you to ask the question "Why am I playing trapper when he is kinda weak mid-game and he can't do anything late game. Fuck it, I'm just gonna play Nurse."
---
&gt;  Maybe this could be a bit more balanced if the timer was reduced to 90 seconds or even 60 seconds.
---
A timer isn't what matters here, it's everything else I've listed above.
---
I understand the desire to nerf NOED but it's just better to slap a totem counter on the HUD than go down a very slippery slope with this perk.
---
Sorry for the text wall, woke up too early and I have DBD on the brain lol.
---
Don't run insidious on Freddy. Yeah he can make use of it more than other killers, but it's still a gimmick perk and not worth the perk slot, especially when there are already so many perks that Freddy has trouble fitting into his standard build.
---
They will make Enduring not affect it in the next patch, so no.
---
There is no way its going to be cosmetics that are already in the store currently.  It will very likely be all exclusive stuff and MAYBE the new killer or survivor (if there is one).  Likely with bits of premium currency  like every other battle pass in the history of battle passes does.
---
I remember the first time I played against the pig (which was on The Game, coincidentally). I was on a gen and she crouched around the corner; I screamed a little while yeeting myself out of there with Sprint Burst.
---
Protection hits count as body blocking, taking a hit during a rescue, pulling agro, things like that. Its things altruistic players do already
---
I main Dwight, and for killer it‚Äôs Myers because I love him as a character overall and he has a great spooky power - I occasionally play the Pig, Hillbilly, and soon Legion or Freddy.
---
Thats nothing, I manage to get a skillcheck after failing one while the character is still covering his face and I'm not holding the "repair" button
---
Dwight looks like the singer of one of my fave bands so I picked him lol
---
Agree to disagree I guess.
---
Nurse, because even an experienced survivor can't dodge a good blink. With other killers I can't land a single hit on good survivors.  
---
Jake, because of his beard .
---
No. I am objectively correct by many metrics. To bolster this, why don‚Äôt you tune into one of said streams and compare and contrast.
---
And the questions they do answer are all some variation of "Can you answer this lore question no one actually cares about"
---
From these comments, its seems like you guys were just as toxic all along but just didnt have enough ways to do it.
---
Altho killers always had more way to be toxic that actually affected the game.
---
Loads of killers (not all) be like "you used flashlight to save your friend so ill facecamp you for 2 min where neither of us play the game, toxic ass survivor!"
---
Except if they pissed me off. Closed the hatch then watch as endgame claims them
---
Dwight is a cutie &lt;3
---
üê∑ *oink oink*
---
An awfully bold claim. I've watched his streams and daily watch his videos. I don't think he is bad at all and if he doesn't do good in a tournament doesn't mean he is bad at the game. Once again though agree to disagree.
---
There's a lot of survivors that insist on blaming everyone but themselves for dying.  Of course there are times where teammates are really stupid and/or sandbag but usually killers eventually outsmart them in a chase.
---
In his defend, some smart Spirits runs Devour Hope because they know that survivors won't break the totem, because they will think it's Haunted Ground.
---
Gotta love the depth of mind games in dbd.
---
I should link you to some footage of him facing some very high level survivors who no life the game. On over 10 occasions that I have seen this, Tru3Talent immediately announces, ‚Äúnothing I can do here to win and just accepts defeat.‚Äù 
---
I have never seen a top killer like the ones I mentioned do that. Rather, they adapt on the fly to create a potential snowball move and work tenaciously to capitalize on survivor mistakes
---
&gt;Was gonna show her at the end how to get up there but she just cucked me
---
You spent all that time up there spamming the flight and tbagging, her attacking you is not cucking you.
---
Killers have Hook vacuum because we can't hook survivors from the side, we have to be in front and the vacuum helps us reach it. They'll remove Hook vacuum when they let us hook from all sides.
---
You miss flaired this post.
---
Uh some got triggered, no i don't face camp anyone for using ingame mechanics, like perks or items, but to absue them just to rob the others of fun, killer and other survivors alike, deserves the same threatment, period! That's how it is, I us the same now, close the hatch and let the endgame kill those toxic garbage people. If you shit on others, don't complain about getting shit on. If you play normally and don't get out of your way to be so annyoning as possible, I can't care less about how you play.
---
It's not supposed to be easy. That's how it should be. Figure out where the hatch earlier in the match, so when the last person is being chased you can be right on top of it.
---
Okay.
---
Is no one going to mention the fact that he has a trapper trollface icon in 2019?
---
It's the objective, the only "Gen rushing" in the game is an incredibally situational instance in where a Swf used to all take in BNP's and do 3-4 gens in the first 3 minutes of the game. Thats not even possible anymore though
---
Oh that‚Äôs right. I had three red emblems and one silver.

I think clown is pretty underappreciated

Not remotely bold. Any competitive player who routinely plays high level tournaments does not take Tru3Talent seriously.

Your logic isn‚Äôt sound. Your opinion or frequency of viewing his content is inconsequential. Objectively, he performs very poorly at any high level, competitive play. I have observed his ‚Äúchase‚Äù and ‚Äúmindgame‚Äù mechanics, and I routinely observe mistakes.

In our defense the last time they literally DID say there was a major optimization patch being released. They lied but they still did confirm it rather than imply it.
---
No they leave
---
I'm feeling personally attacked and I dislike this feeling.
---
I think it's not meant to be easy. If the killer got 3k, isn't his fault. He deserves the edge.
---
I feel like I need to show this to people who say Ruin is OP. Learn to hit great skill checks and all it becomes is just a minor inconvenience.

Platform: All

Type of Bug: In-Game
---
Description: The Pale Rose boat AND the Ormond lodge have huge desync issues involving tiles spawning incorrectly for the survivor. This winds up having the survivor run in place on the hosts point of view (usually Killer unless you're playing KWF) and from the survivor's point of view it looks like the killer is lagswitching, but the victim of the bug can still see the killer actively hitting something invisible and other survivors move around.

---
Steps to reproduce: It's completely random, most of the time on these maps I don't see this issue
---
System Specs: N/A
---
Nno one is forcing you to run those 4 perks. "Winning" as survivor is very easy. And it can be done very easy without the 4 bets perks. I always run WGLF, Botany, Dead Hard and Spine Chill. And I am doing fine.
---
i recently made the plunge and have all the characters now. getting to experiment with all the perks has been fun, and i get bored of the game less than before.
---
Your solution to DCing is to ban half the player base and make queue times even longer?
---
I use it on Doctor purely for those BP gains. BBQ + Distressing + Pudding/BPS is a surefire 70k if you play decently.
---
Someone delivered themselves off hook while, not just myself, but one other person, were within spitting distance of saving them. Rank 17, am I right?
---
Pro tip: don't do it in the first place
---
*boi*
---
I love Pop Team Epic too!
---
Good lord, 58k BPs sounds like a dream compared to the dinky little 7-10k I get in a quicker match as a survivor (20k in a longer match but even that seems like barely anything).  
---
  
---
I will definitely be giving that a try, as soon as I prepare myself for the onslaught of shit talking because you're right. This community is toxic af sometimes haha.
---
Survivor: ‚ÄúOh yea? Think you‚Äôre gonna pull off a sick chainsaw like that and get a hook for it?‚Äù
---
My girl has lots of good looking cosmetic that mix and match very well üëåüèª
---
Old man is my only reason.
---
Oh I've been in a game where I spawned with a survivor next to a gen with Prove Thyself. We immediately got on the gen, nailed several great skill checks and after less than 30 seconds the gen popped. No less than 5 seconds later another gen popped. Apparently we spawned in 2 groups of 2 on the 2 gens the killer wasn't able to check in the first 40 seconds. Poor guy.
---
Don‚Äôt do this. We have the opportunity to make a Pig/Myers ship and we should take it
---
YES
---
Chases are not meant to get away, are meant to lose time, so it's hard to escape. Plus, you need a medkit to heal or self-care. In my case, I don't use self-care and medkit are for a limited time.
---
Second, a good killer will know you have MoM if you try to protect the other survivor, so he will try to down you so you can't heal and therefore activate MoM.
---
Its a hard thing to do, but you get treated like you did regardless.
---
Or do, because play what you want.
---
Or on the other hand, if the two gates are a decent distance away from each other, find a door and wait for the killer to check it if you can, then as soon as they leave jump on it.  Depending on the killer it‚Äôll take them awhile to go to the other door, check, and go back.
---
The problem is when they ignore going for the save until the last 20 seconds. Sure, there's a hooked guy and you *can* interrupt one and start a chase, but that's still 40 seconds x2 which is a full gen worth of time. Bonus points for the survivors if you check the wrong gen or the hooked guy has Deliverance and told the survivors before the game that he had it. The problem for killers comes when survivors take their time for saves and just stay on gens. I'm sure there's videos out there of "optimal" survivor teams who slam out the gens way too fast.
---
Oh thnks, maybe I'll try it then
---
If you think that the only use for a chase is to lose time, then you wont like MoM at all, which is why you think it's impossible to use. You can get on a chase to allow your teammates to heal before escaping so you can heal yourself. You can get in a chase just for fun until you go down. You can get in chase's to allow teammates to finish the gen you were all just on, and then escape once the gen is completed.
---
And we care because...?
---
That was sarcasm my dude.
---
THIS
---
Is god
---
Hey pal, let the guy watch who he wants to fucking watch.  It‚Äôs of no concern to you.
---
I would fucking love to posses a locker
---
Mashup of my favourite killer and JoJo's? oh lawd
---
My dumb ass thought the legion at the end was another survivor, lol.
---
It is annoying. I think the double pip is too much on either side, but if you're gonna do it for one, do it to the other. It should've stayed 4k. That could already be difficult sometimes with hatch escapes. If they really want to base it off of pips, it should be 1 pip for both survivor and killer for the achievement. That would mean you didnt technically kill everyone or escape as a survivor to get the achievement, but it would take effort on both sides
---
We'll see.
---
I have a better solution:
---
\-Disconnect during a Match 1x-No Penalty
---
\-Disconnect during a Match 2x-Banned for the Rest of the Day
---
\-If you get banned for a day 2x then you are banned for the rest of the week
---
Not every killer does it, but a lot of killers like to check the area around the hook if they didn't see all of the survivors. Waiting until the last 20 seconds (meaning you won't likely be at the hook until there's 10 seconds left) means any time the killer spent not immediately rushing to a gen is wasted. Plus it maximizes the chance of finishing your gen before running to the hook so the killer can't regress it if they pass by. If you just started the gen there's not much of a point in waiting though, but if it's half done or more, you can finish it before even starting to go for the save and have plenty of time unless you across the map (in which case you shouldn't be going for the save anyway, especially solo)
---
I‚Äôve noticed I do this too lmao, just like turning the controller in old racing games.
---
If that was the old killer selection roster, it's much more immersive and frankly better than what we got now.
---
I'd rather have longer queue times than Idiot teammates who completely ruin a game by disconnecting within 1 Minute and ruining the game for everyone else
---
There are people with Devotion 11. Giving "legacy" for Devotion 1 is... silly.
---
Old DS could be countered with Enduring and juggling. On top of that, unless non obsessions were nowhere near a hook, you'd likely only get hit with one.
---
MoM can't be countered by anything, and everyone can use it.
---
I hate getting tunneled but for me I completely understand if I have dying light on me. It‚Äôs such a bad perk and promotes toxicity though they really need to change it up to be better without needing to be a dick to make it useful
---

This is someone else's, don't know what happened to my template but it should be the same thing :)
---
also 
---
1. I main nurse/huntress so spirit fury is useless
---
2. my playstyle (mindgaming every loop) kinda makes a spirit fury play really difficult to make, i only run into like 2 pallets per chase because i keep the survivor around the same pallet, fair point tho, just not a perk for me
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter, 99% he won‚Äôt be able to open gates.
---
Its not suicide, he went to Narnia
---
this is a copy paste from another reply btw because a lot of people asking about spirit fury
---
"This killer is playable if you have these specific Very rare or ultra rares!" Should never be a thing.
---
why did you mark 'lol' on BHVR??
---
A lot of the people are open about working on it before DBD, there's even a few easter eggs regarding.
---
The original narrator of the DBD spotlights was the same voice of the announcer in naughty bear, and 'Lazer Bears' on the back of Feng's shirt is a reference to a level in the game.
---
It's because these people are tiny dicked losers who escape maybe 5% of the time. Nothing you do will justify their shitty attitude so you might as well justify it by being a dick yourself.
---
Trap sliding make it happen
---
G-string with some maggots on the thighs.
---
You don‚Äôt depip if you dc rn, sadly.
---
I swear 99% of survivor mains on PS4 send me hatemail for killing them
---
Well, I just thought it was funny is all. So, I marked it with a "lol."
---
i havent gotten around to using surveillance and stridor is basically shit whispers imo, lookin back at it tho ive probs put blood warden and bitter way too high
---
It doesn't in the shop, because you're not forced see what you could have gotten if you had paid. With a battle pass that would be the case every time you level up. If all cosmetics are also available in the shop it would possibly be better. As you're not having the same feeling of missing out.   
---
So the way the pass is made could change it. I've never seen a battle pass without nonexclusive stuff. Of course, I don't know if this will be the case or not. We'll see how it turns out.
---
Get the teachable unlock by leveling up cannibal. Then level up pig and hope rng bless you
---
Unlock his teachable perk at level 35 and then you will randomly find it in other killers' bloodwebs.
---
100% Facts, did that during the 2x bloodpoint weekend and man I felt like I wont the lottery
---
vacuum pallets were stupid but I do miss reverse pallet stuns.
---
Literally same, I've set my settings so people can't message me anymore
---
Trapper.  Chainsaws are cool and all, but there is something special about hearing the trap snap on someone from across the map.  Even better when they go for a hook kill.  Like I'm going to leave the tall grass conveniently undefended.
---
&gt;Before anyone asks I gave up on the game late October last year and have barely played since, this is why the legion and plague perks might seem misplaced due to me having no experience with them... (But still knowing what they do)
---
This is a comment i set btw
---
and i stand my ground on lullaby, maybe a couple perks down tho behind pop and counter intervention (i think its called lol)
---
"lose time" means "making the killer lose time so the others can do gens" not "Useless activity".
---
Get leatherface to level 35.
---
Bbq ruin make your choice noed = unfun to play survivor nuff said
---
Burger King Myers is a combination of Vanity Mirror (Reduced Movementspeed) and Tombstone (Reduced Movementspeed). You are not allowed to stalk and are basically stuck in tier 1 with reduced movementspeed, which makes you even slower that survivors.
---
You're clearly just bad at running chases if you think MoM will be impossible to use. I take roughly 10 protection hits a match.
---
unfortunately shadowborn is one of the perks i actually felt strongly about, its literally just shit monitor and abuse, sure monitor only gives you like +half the fov but along with that the smaller terror radius means youre more likely to find survivors at their gens instead of nearby pallets
---
I personally don't have any problem against MoM, I just immediately break chase, go do a little pressure on gens and immediately go back to the aura and finish the job. They never expect that, they expect you to keep chasing and forget about the aura thing.
---
So many Billies man
---
this man has 3000 iq
---
Why‚Äôre you making this personal?  I said nothing about whether true was good or bad or whether you‚Äôre really a red ranks player or not.  You‚Äôre preaching to someone about why a content creator they enjoy watching is bad.  You‚Äôre not going to convince him to not watch him or to watch you instead or anything.  That‚Äôs like telling someone their favorite color is shit lmao.  Get off the internet please and thank you.
---
Sorry but your team lost, I know it‚Äôs hard to accept that after have two years of ‚Äúoh my team sucks, easy escape time‚Äù the hatch is now a first come first served, who ever gets it first wins, failing that the doors are just luck based.
---
Lullaby is actually really really good in low ranks where people cant find hex totems, usually its gone within a minute before youre even able to hook someone and it just has no impact at all
---
Honestly if they just made the dreamworld a little more eye-friendly, removed completing gens/exit gates/whatever else while Freddy watches impotently, and self-care checks waking survivors, he'd be in a pretty good spot.
---
Oh! Of course didn‚Äôt even look at the addons that closely. Ive always known that build as either fat Myers or out-of-shape Myers. But yea, Burger King Myers makes sense too. Thanks for clarification
---
sometimes during a chase as killer i‚Äôll jam my foot on the ground like i‚Äôm driving a car. i have no idea why
---
Nea, she's badass and relatable in a lot of ways for me.
---
great explanation
---
I mean im busting if we get it ...
---
Oh that's grey thnks
---
To each his own perception I guess. When I play surv I pick a flashlight for my own security as I can blind while a pallet gets kicked...
---
But for that I'm being dodged 70% of the time or facecamped by the almighty "oooh you got a flashlight you toxic scrrrrrubz you deserve to be camped"
---
Freddy is kroken or some shit for them
---
No
---
You could cleanse all the totems and if every survivor runs MoM it is 4 time a health state and NOED can only be used at the end of the match so I would say that MoM is much more powerful
---
MoM can effect m1 killers with those killers not having any kind of counter.
---
With NOED you can cleanse the totems and make it null and void every game it's in if you're willing to try.
---
It is most likely that we won't get a survivor or map. But they could pull a surprise on us, you never know.
---
Sad to admit I do the same. I even start the match telling myself that I won't do it this time...
---
It's digital, but I use some photomashing, and the background is mostly filters over a photo. 
---
I love when digital work doesn't look digital, you can zoom in and spend long times trying to understand how the effect was done.
---
now its like billy and leatherface, "the stalky bois"
---
Ahh that is a shame, a Scream map could have been cool but oh well just Ghostface is fine! any theories on release date yet?
---
Lol I do lean in
---
No rules that say I have to agree or like his bad playstyle.. thank you but next
---
Blonde and a higher resolution.
---

I have to study some blonde hair...
---
That's how it's supposed to work yeah. But killers get fog thickening in the blood web for some reason.
---
myers cuz i can jumpscare people and thats pretty fun and viable so win win
---
They wrote for the anniversary stream they'd be talking about Ghostface without saying it was a chapter or anything so it's most likely going to be a killer only chapter.
---
 *cries in Sidney Prescott*
---
Im in this picture and I don‚Äôt like it
---
Thank You!
---
Go get the person running for them... duh
---
Black Box + Dying Light + Green Mori Freddy always makes me feel so bad to play, but that earlygame -25% to gen repair speed makes it necessary.
---
Before he got changed he could also do the classic:
---
‚ÄúBing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing‚Äù
---
A small sacrifice for salvation.
---
I am... A changed man.....
---
*Capitalizes Sudoku*
---
Because they can DC with no consequence. This killer downed me right off the bat, fuck him I‚Äôll dc and join another game instantly.
---
Can‚Äôt get made at them for it. BHVR allows this bullshit. You want to get upset with anyone, yell at BHVR. They‚Äôve already said they won‚Äôt address it until they get dedicated servers. So until then, this game will be an unplayable DC fest.
---
That‚Äôs what I chalk most of the comments in this sub as ‚Äî trolling. I‚Äôd like to believe people wouldn‚Äôt think some things they say. 
---
I‚Äôve expressed my displeasure with the proposed change and lack of problem with 1 MoM, but even the bad survivors have realized the power of MoM. Keep trucking through.
---
Ohhh thanks
---
As a survivor, I think the killer earned that shit if he closes the hatch and no one can get the gates opened. People need to stop being so angry and just move on to the next game.
---
I understand it may feel like that but it really comes down to Gen pressure. Maybe try watching some high level killers on youtube and learn from them
---
https://youtu.be/zN9ceXXRmc0
---
You advertise your twitch in your username, which is basically an invite for killers to tunnel, mori and camp you.
---
I didnt say this was a comparison thread but you should quit your whining MoM isnt that OP. When i play killer against MoM i focus on another survivor after it activates or just continue chasing. Its an entire perk slot and doesn‚Äôt even activate against M2s. 
---
I genuinely do not have fun playing survivor against nurse/billy with those 4 mentioned killer perks so saying ‚Äòkiller is unfun‚Äô isnt unique in dbd to killers. I bet you theres just as many sweaty 4 mans with MoM DS balanced and adrenaline as there are sweaty killers with op builds
---
Nurse be packin'!
---
Those 2.5 seconds could be the difference between life and death. No really, there have been situations where I died but wouldn't have if I just had 2.5 seconds more to open the Gates.
---
Its from The Hills Run Red, its not bad.
---
I laughed at the D: its truly sad lol
---
I get that its very annoying, but saying it doesn't have any counter just shows some Killers dont even know what perks do. Most Killers complaining about MoM I've talked to didnt even know about the aura reading. At least read the darned perk.
---
I can't kill a dwight D: they are too innocent
---
This game and Mordhau I physically move in my seat while trying to land a lunging attack
---
Chainsawed 10 feet through a window, chainsawed around a corner, chainsawed through a dropped pallet. Just console things.
---
WElp sorry kiddo, but those killers a scrubs, end of story ! I havea thick enough skin to not let shriek like this influence my experience with the game. See you in the fog have good !
---
i regularly don't mind killers that want to win, but oh god billies are so sweaty. If you loop them for 30 seconds they'll either DC or tunnel/camp you forever
---
Luckily I don't have anywhere to go today, but it'd be nice to be able to actually get in and play soon before my friends get on and want to play League or something. Hopefully, with as much talk as is going on about it they'll realize people can't get in. Unless of course it's just a minority of us, but I'm hoping that's not the case. It'd be great if they extend it though!
---
Man, I love when new killers and survivor (perks) come out (and maps!)
---
It's such a thrill to find out the new things that have been added to the game and how they can mix-up what the other side can normally do/expect to happen in a match!
---
Thank you squat?
---
lol..
---
You made me laugh lol
---
The close application button
---
It brings me joy
---
For survivors, claudette and not because of her immersion abilities, i just love her outfits and i already have all perks on her. Now i'm working on giving Kate some cosmetics and leveling her up
---
For killers, Freddy and Spirit. I figured out how to make freddy work, and i can say that he's better than, at least, Wraith and Leatherface. Spirit is just a "balanced nurse", and i love the way she plays and how funny her mindgames can be
---
I play at red ranks every day and sure not every survivor does it but my point still stands, there is a counter to the "downside" of the perk. 
---
Breaking chase is not a reliable thing most of the time. I know very well that sometimes you just gotta bail on a chase, but because of how fast gens can be done MoM is gonna activate in the late/end game most of the time where you don't have a lot of freedom to bail from a chase. 
---
Hell if MoM activates mid or somehow early game then fuck em, I'll let em go away cause I don't have to deal with it for the rest of the match and that's fine. However, that isn't the reality of it.
---
Once again weak killers shouldn't be punished for using their power. That's the whole crux of why this perk is badly designed.
---
Practice
---
you lucky son of a bitch
---
For me it's when I'm picking up a surv I'll tilt my head down Ward and move it up with the surv instinctively. I don't know why I started doing it
---
But...but.... I've been using insidious freddy for a long time üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
(Now I know how OC creators feel)
---
I feel you there. I got somewhere to go at 530 tonight. Sucks if they don't just reschedule or give compensation to those who were trying.
---
Being survivor, it's so much fun to just run around and try to avoid the killer. That thrill of not knowing exactly where they are (even with my perks that tell me the general vicinity, they still sneak up on me). It's as close to being in a real life horror movie as I want to get!
---
Being killer, my favorite thing is just playing as The Pig. I love the Saw movies and Amanda as a whole, so having an entire killer based around them both is just awesome. I keep hoping for Jason to be released, but I'm definitely not holding my breath. Still, a girl can dream!
---
I don't play for your amusement. Thanks for the salt.
---
Yep, same here. "Verify Integrity of Game Files" came up with nothing, so I'm betting it's on their end.
---
Noed used to last 2 minutes, and that's why hope has that timer too. I think that removing Hope's timer would be really nice
---
WGLF needs easier ways to earn tokens tbh. Also, maybe WGLF and WWMI should merge into one perk?
---
Won't stop the devs from TRYING it. There's so much money to be had in China's mobile market.
---
yo if I had an award I‚Äôd give it to you. 
---
This is the funniest comment I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
DID SOMEBODY SAID "NO MITHER BUILD" ?!
---
Oh man, good luck with that.
---
That sounds so smart actually
---
But I mean instantly as they spawn. 2 of them
---
Same lol
---
Ha thx it‚Äôs a real bitch
---
My favorite thing about this game has to be the killer's ability to nod furiously. Say what you want, that is the best feature in this game, hands-down.
---
omg i love the comunity of dbd sometimes
---
That Legion: angry as fuk
---
Despite how I feel about the state the game is in right now ... the battle pass coming or ridiculous balancing.
---
I do have to say I appreciate the way the devs communicate with us. It is probably the best effort I have seen from any company indie or not. 
---
The gaming industry as a whole would be a much better place if all of them were just a little like behavior.......as long as they dont code like behavior.
---
Tried a repair of the EAC service, but it didn't work.
---
Jumpscare Myers would be proud of you.
---
Hit 'em with the hot loading screen DC
---
I didn't argue against the purpose of this perk. Hell I run it too cause I like to tank the killer, doesn't mean I don't think it's poorly designed.
---
Again let's make one thing clear: you can't counter the extra hit. Outside of playing a killer that doesn't rely on their M1 you are going to get hit with it at some point in the trial. You have no counter to that as a killer. That's my problem with it, plain and simply. Using the aura reading is not a counter, it's just an option of what to do after you lose a down. Bailing on a chase is sometimes a good move, but it's not this all-holy black and white "counter" to the perk like you say and it's not always a good or viable option to leave someone.  
---
Nuance is important to balance in this game.
---
did you seriously rage quit because your Ruin got instantly destroyed?
---
Lmao with freddy you don't chase the first person you find. If you do that you are just a bad freddy and the devs are reworking him because of the huge circlejerk
---
I put in a ticket so the rover team running it know the issue
---
Ruin, BBQ Chilli, STBL, green add-ons - Complaining about survivor perks.
---
They have to do something. You can just bloodlust players at a pallet right by the door until the timer ends.
---
I actually pull backwards when running as a survivor. I'm not quite sure why. You'd think leaning forward would make more sense.
---
Same lol. I thought of this like a month after he released. I stopped using it though cuz there are much better perks. It's not too good against good survivors
---
That would be nice but different licenses :/
---
Wait a minute.  
---
Resilience +9%  
---
Spine Chill +6%  
---
Leader +25%  
---
Wake Up +15%  
---
This should be a 55% increase, right?
---
so i slightly exaggerated it? doesn't make my point more valid. 95% of all games all 4 survivors have exhaustion perks. to my over 2.5k hours most of which is maining killer it never was a problem. i don't see why would people only use them once per game. i don't even understand why exhaustion doesn't recover when you simply run outside of chase. no SP, DH, Lithe ever fucked my game. while Adrenaline and MoM on more than 2 people constantly does.
---
I can why you‚Äôd think Hillbilly is the second best but he‚Äôs actually third. Because he can get looped just like any other M1 killer, the spirit if played well can‚Äôt. Not to mention her ability to catch survivors soon after injuring them, especially with STBL
---
Someone in the dream world gets in a locker, and Freddy has the ability to immediately transport himself to that locker (like the Hag)- except the locker is Freddy-ified (with green stripes and all). The locker sprouts mechanical arms like in Dream Warriors and pulls the survivor out. That would be badass.
---
got my 4k, but it feels kinda weird, like the aura of the survivor shows up after 3-4 seconds instead of 2.
---
i honestly rather stick to enduring/fury combo, since enduring is getting buffed soon. (devs mentioned it in the stream)
---
Idk what to tell ya then
---
Your trying to nitpick here. Everyone knows what I meant. Freddy and wraith all have  to use their m1 attacks to do anything to the survivors. Billy has a reliable m2 attack that let's him bypass the perk, as does huntress, and spirit and nurse are so strong that if the MoM causes you to lose then you already fucked up pretty substantially. 
---
What makes MoM a unique case us that it doesnt just make the chase longer like any of the exhaustion perks. It straight up punishes you for doing nothing wrong and rewards a survivor for not doing anything that requires it (see deliverance as an example).
---
Buffed? wtf
---
Does "really good survivors" mean they just spaz out right before you hit them?
---
i cant even login to it, get the same error
---
Fair point
---
Even knowing what was bound to happen, I jumped when he just jumped out and slapped you xD
---
Initially, I had no idea what was causing the noise- I was thinking it was his belts. But after watching the show, I finally realised it‚Äôs his man-girdle causing the noise (and yeah, his man girdle is mentioned in-game, but I didn‚Äôt notice that).
---
same exact problem
---
insidious has a delay for some reason
---
Yep, I also can‚Äôt get it
---
Adrenaline is supposed to fuck over your game. They have to complete all gens to get it, it's only once per game, and they give up a perk slot for it. MoM is cheap and that's why it's being reworked.
---
Good to know, you've added so very much to this post with your opinion, ty for your edgyness edgelordAvn
---
You guys think its worth prestiging i have everything on level 50 but its like i dont get anything just a bloody cosmetic
---
Guess I can just go die for even suggesting removing a pointless mechanic...
---
The "horror" factor has definitely worn off at this point...but even after thousands of hours, scratched mirror Myers and prayer beads Spirit still make me shit myself.
---
i'm not saying the perks shouldn't exist. all i said was i don't understand why would anyone wanted a change to exhaustion perks. that's all. holy shit.
---
They probably have mettle of man they deserve it
---
/s
---
As opposed to survivor, which uses big brain pallet looping that has a bare minimum of 140 IQ.
---
Me: alt tabs when I get grabbed as the last survivor
---
Ahhh relaxing.
---
For real. If you can loop, billy's an M1 killer with map control.
---
So you're saying that low tier killers are bad and high tier killers are good. That has nothing to do with MoM.
---
*It straight up punishes you for doing nothing wrong and rewards a survivor for not doing anything that requires it (see deliverance as an example).*

I mean it's literally the opposite but okay.
---
Same, I'd prefer Billy over fucking myers
---
M&amp;A is way better
---
That was a journey, OP. "I love solitaire," had me wheezing lmao
---
its obviously not going to be very fun for a survivor if you tunnel them from start of game to death, they will get very few points and often there isnt anything they can do to stop it, so they just end up feeling helpess and annoyed for wasting 10 min. 
---
Similarly it often isnt the best plan to just tunnel one person and forget the other three, if you put no pressure on rest of team they will power through the generators in no time, so generally unless there is some reason to single one person out such as they have a flash light and interupting you killing others/teabagging and want to put them back in their place, its best to try and avoid as when you do it, noone wins.
---
You‚Äôre right.
---
I know being toxic is bad, but I‚Äôve hit rank one before, hated it, stopped playing for a bit to drop, and I can‚Äôt get out of rank 10, the camper rank, and most of the killers there are toxic, and I really only play toxic if they were first.
---
It'll exclusively work for pallets instead of for all stuns but it'll halve the time now.
---
It's a behavior as old as video games. My mom and dad both had ataris as kids, they would juke back and forth playing asteroids. It's just your bodies natural instinct to follow through with motions.
---
New band
---
Tunneling helps you get rid of players faster from the game. Which can help you win by removing the number of people you are dealing with. However, it allows the three you aren't chasing to work on gens without worry.
---
If you dont tunnel and instead go after new people each time, you disrupt those people who were working unobstructed. Plus, then the hooked person has time to get help healing, which takes more time from other people.
---
For your time and applying pressure, it is best not to tunnel.
---
Also; it fucking sucks to be tunneled. You barely get to play the game and make almost no points, making the game a waste of time. It is definitely an aggressive, player vs player game, sure. However, it is still a game. Completely ruining it for another person when were all playing to have a good time? Not super nice.
---
So yeah, a fake rule made by survivors, but still good to follow both for you and for them.
---
People really post to a sub they‚Äôve never been on. 
---
There was literally a post yesterday about this. That‚Äôs how common it is. 
---
Yes, this idea is still terrible. Yes, it interrupts gameplay and gives even more power to survivors. No, it will never be implemented.
---
In some scenarios, tunneling to get a survivor out of the game is the best pressure that you can apply. 
---
Also OP, you can do whatever you deem is necessary to win as killer (except cheating lol) although obviously some strategies may be more detrimental to you than others.
---
Thank you x
---
This is true. And definitely far more annoying. I hate OoO
---
I absolutely hated hatch stand-offs on either side; I just found them entirely un-fun.  And while I agree that a killer getting 3 kills shouldn't be easy, I still feel like the exit gate spawns could be made a bit less random so that they're not without eyeshot distance of one another
---
As a survivor main I hate people like that.
---
instructions unclear, just got hooked then immediately unhooked in front of the huntress üôÅ

Am trying to teach myself how to play Max and get Chainsaw hits; can confirm the hitbox is BS.
---
I'll get 'Ghost Hits' (hits where I bump into the Survivor, it plays the successful hit animation, but the Survivors doesn't go down and just runs away) nearly as much as I'll hit and down Survivors I can't even see.
---
Anyone else having this problem, I tried reinstalling and verifying, and its already 11 edt.
---
yikes sweaty, can't we all just get along
---
It's happening to everyone.
---
Great rank system
---
You're really complaining about him using op perks when you're also running op perks?
---
I find (and not reprimanding you or telling you off, just sharing my thoughts) that answering toxicity with toxicity only creates more toxicity
---
In any scenario (whether I'm killer with toxic t-bagging survivors or survivor with camping/tunneling killer) I just let it go and move on.  I used to get super upset and things and wait for post-game chat to cuss people out and yell at them for being stupid, but I've come to realize not only did that not accomplish ANYTHING, but it made me look like an ass.
---
Nowadays, if someone's toxic, I ignore them.  If it starts getting actual toxicity (harassment/slurs/etc.) I just report them, downvote them, block them and move on.  Being toxic back does nothing to make the issue go away, so I'll just be respectful and hope others do the same :)
---
Huntress: I like throwing axes, it's a good ability that I can pull off at least a 3k with without a single perk.
---
I just watched a guy do a Gen on reddit
---
Patch notes:
---
Fixed an issue where Ashley Williams' functional shotgun did not render properly
---
Fixed an issue where pressing the action button when playing as Ashley Williams and pointed at the killer would not fire his shotgun at the killer, killing them and ending the match
---
A fellow man of culture

Thanks, now we wait for devs to see

The game is makin up for those times when you do a gen and don't get a single check at all.

For quentin pls
---
Plus he wasn't even camping! 18,000 points is like 16k\~ before the disconnect modifiers? That's a lot without any sacrifices and without the last of your brutality scoring.
---
The horror, I love horror movies. I grew up watching Friday the 13th and Scream and all the classics, at the time, they scared the shit out of me. Now i've just kinda embraced it, planning on going into sfx work, and this game lets me play out little scenarios in my head for fun.
---
It was one of the first things I tried with Freedy after the nerf.
---
Trying to be a hero rewards the camping killer, thus inciting them to do it more often. There's your problem, here's your fix.
---
Oh man I don't think you're gonna like when I tell you I'm a Legion main... ^_^;
---
And honestly, I don't mind facecamping as much as others seem to?  Like I'm not having fun, but I'm willing to just hang out with the killer while my team does their job and gets out.  I actually hate it when they facecamp my teammates rather than when they facecamp me because I feel bad that my teammates can't play the game
---
Aw, darn. Makes sense tho
---
I'd still take Red paint brush over insidious, I can mind game while moving and it works against better players too. But that's just imo.
---
You manage to take a hit and get away and heal up 10 times a game?
---
True. If they want to facecamp and get one kill while the rest of us get away then more power to them I guess XD
---
dam David you lookin' fiiiiiiiine
---
yep, it doesn't work, good try though.
---
The current meta for survivors has you wasting the killers time for as long as humanly possible. This can be done by not being seen in the first place, but you're going to have to up your chase game regardless to succeed in the long run. 
---
Golden rule: Every second wasted by the killer trying to catch you is a second gained for your team! Play around that fact by adjusting your perk build and your playstyle.
---
It's been like that since yesterday, you're a tad late to the party.
---
This is true for me when I get jumpscared pallet stunned. I legit jump a bit
---
That's all I needed thanks
---
Happens when the survivors have 30 pallets to hide behind + escape items + left click hook saving + escape perks + windows + 1,25 simple objectives per player, the killer is not a threat in this "horror" game lmao
---
Aren't you lucky.
---
Ew. That doesn't sound at all fucking enjoyable either.
---
So no thank you, I'll stick to my hiatus.
---
"piece of trash perk" Genuinely the strongest perk since the original DS but okay. lmao

---
You can if you like, but the 2x bloodpoints are really nice and if you can land long range hatchets then bbq is really good
---
Firstly, I'll do whatever the fuck I want in my own thread and you'll sit there and read it and not much else.
---
"It's an entire perk slot." So was the original DS. Or did you think that was fair and not a big deal too?
---
I specifically referenced M1 killers in here, so you can take that Nurse and Billy counter point and shove it up your ass.
---
There is no killer perk more powerful than Mettle of Man right now.
---
dream transition addons, and not the godawful one that makes it even longer
---
How did that one guy get 15 extra points? You should also clarify how you DCed because a lot of people are (not surprisingly) saying you DCed after your Ruin went down.
---
I love the EGC. Before the new hatch mechanic i had to wait until the last inmersed Claudette decided to escape through the hatch. Now i don't care i she escapes, i just close the hatch and wait.
---
Thats no buff. You're back to full time on DSing
---
Exactly what I do. However, I somewhat contradict that by running Ruin too. BBQ, Devour Hope, Ruin, and Haunted Grounds. Pick your totem.
---
Yeah I imagine I could hear the irredescent button just coming slowly and slowly poor dude
---
i have a timed batch file ran at 7am each day to back up my save lmao. That tells you how much I trust their system, I lost my progress twice back in the day but because I kept backups I'm solid.
---
this is a personal attack
---
I like it in that it got rid of hatch stand-offs and rather made it a race to find it
---
As I've said numerous times throughout this thread, I dislike the Exit Gate spawns that are just right next to each other and leave almost no chance of escape
---
The 360 is horrible design?
---
Don‚Äôt know man, just never crossed my mind
---
I don't find tunneling a really smart strategy: you can be lucky and find the worst survivor of the game, tunnel him and get a kill in the first 2 min, or you can be unlucky and instead of the worst survivor you find the best one and you will end your game with only one kill (if you catch him of course) because during the tunneling the other survivors have the calm and the time to finish all the gens. In the first situation you've just ruin the fun of a survivor, in the second you will end with a smashed keyboard. I prefer hook and use my BBQ.
---
That's like asking survivors not to tea bag. Unfortunately there's toxic gameplay that's never going to stop. What I'm getting at with the pic is that there is a counter to face camping which means the killer should depip. Survivors can be too altruistic and all go for the save so the face camper gets more kills than they should, sometimes even a 4k. To stop this, simply do gens and the killer will likely depip.
---
A perk that (very easily) extends a chase vs. a killer perk that shortens the chase are not at all comparable. The killer is one person. As one survivor is being chased and extending a chase beyond what would otherwise be intended, the other three are railing out the objectives uncontested.
---
Time-related perks for killers and individual survivors are not comparable.
---
Description: Autoaim on Legion while in frenzy is completly ridiculous. I hit objects (trees, barrels) 90% of the time if the survivor just circles it while im in frenzy. Also had a situation where a survivor was lagging and I wanted to lunge at him but it interrupted my lunge because of the stupid confirmed hit animation after which the survivor lagged forwards and actually lagged out of range of the normal m1 hit animation (without Dead Hard). Especially crippling if I stun myself for 4 seconds and loose my power for 20 sec after a "missed" hit.
---
Were you saying "not to me" like your lobbies aren't 40ping or that it doesn't happen to you? Cause my reply was assuming you meant those chainsaws never hit you, in which case oof my bad.
---
Same. I updated my ticket asking if play time will be extended or adjusted. I'm sure I'll just get a generic or ambiguous reply (if at all), but they have to make a change somewhere at this point I'd think.
---
Dark lord Chuckles the silly pig.
---
It wasnt intended to be in the game, it only works because moving the camera and turning at the same time makes the character super rotate, it looks dumb as hell and it only works against the newer players that dont know how to deal with it
---
No idea what makes you think I haven't already done that.
---
*Careless Whisper intensifies*
---
Hopefully! We are already two hours down in time.
---
My blue wig ass thanks you
---
And then there are people like me with overcharge as first perk for freddy
---
Pretty much every m1 killer
---
It's the echo from your first post.
---
Good luck with that.
---
normally i give hatch if i downed last before gates were powered but ever since collapse i couldn't help myself to wait for them to crawl over to it only for me to close it, the fact they always just stop moving all together is priceless
---
I always lean forward when playing killer, not only for extra reach on lunges but to also see farther away. When im playing surv i sometimes check the phone while doing gens or totems lol.
---
Killer main here, bad idea.
---
As killer I always lean more forward and stare at the screen constantly, keeping my eyes open never blinking making sure that I won't miss that pesky survivor poking their head out or tbagging me from afar.

Class Photo?
---
It's a shame, I'm trying to do this for my friend but he is worrying about the whole thing
---
Team work is essential. If you get found waste as much time for the Killer as possible by extending the chase as much as possible through loops, pallets, chase perks, etc. If you can juke her (make her lose you) even better.
---
If you see someone getting hit either in your line of sight or through the survivor icon at the bottom left of the screen do gens ASAP.
---
You should be either being chased or doing gens 90% of the time. Of course you need to walk through the map and maybe hide eventually, but try to focus on gens or chases.
---
When all gens are done opening the gates takes priority over everything else, if you unhook someone and the gates are closed she's going back to the hook.
---
Thats general advice, now you can look up more specific guides.
---
My personal advice: run the perk Kindred so your teammates know when your are being camped or facecamped and pray for them to focus on gens. Do not kill yourself on hook, that just helps the killer.
---
Your question was meant with malice and anyone with a brain can tell your a troll. LEAVE ME BE. This community is full of toxic streamers, I just so happen to not be one of them. I literally just started this channel and im very friendly but i also don't take sh\*t from noone! If that makes me "toxic" So be it! Your "question" was not needed i want just trying to share my new channel with reddit. Nothing toxic about my reaction either.

&gt;  when it's time to stop the chase and heal
---
Lol do you just hand signal the killer to stop chasing you? 
---
I‚Äôm actually curious now, you have a twitch or youtube channel? I‚Äôd love to see how you manage to take a hit and convince killers to stop chasing you *ten times* in a game.

When I get facecamped, I just see the auras of everyone squatting around me :(

Console or PC?
---
He‚Äôs more like the fourth best. Hag is third. This is a post from the forums by a user named Poweas, but it sums up why Hag is the third best in the game. 
---
‚ÄùWhy I think Hag is better than Billy. Hag can spread pain when the survivors are across the map quicker than any other killer in the game, not even Nurse can. She is way better than Billy in chase. She can dominate with Thanatophobia, she can control 1/2 of the map without addons 3/4 with her green range addon alone. She is ridiculously mobile with her traps, joint with Billy. Her map pressure is off the chart and she's everywhere. With STBFL, she's unstoppable. She can control 5 gens at once. That's massive considering Doctor is limited to 3 or maybe 4. She's unpredictable. If you're good enough with Hag, you can even take on SWF, as I do, and still win (Yes I'm that good with her). She's unloopable and amazing at mindgames. She can snowball WAYYY better than any other killer, even better than Billy. I don't need to expand on that, it's common knowledge how good she is at snowballing. She can injure 3 survivors and down 1 in the space of 20 seconds, and with STBFL, maybe even 14 seconds. She can pressure survivors into healing and gets a major advantage if they do. She can sometimes bring the game to a crawl, if they are pressured into healing. - ‚Äú
---
I‚Äôve had the trouble, mate.
---
As am I , I can‚Äôt find a match I‚Äôve been sat here for the last 10 minutes also. Servers must be slow.
---
When I'm running Haunted Ground as Rin, I usually assume survivors to assume me assuming that they assume it to be Haunted Ground and me therefore running Devour Hope, so they cleanse it and get fucked in the ass.
---
Wait until they finally choose to patch the achievement. Merciless is ridiculously hard right now, it's not up to skill, it's up to luck.

So let me clarify. When I say killer gets punished for playing the game here is what I mean. Killers have to hit people, no exception to that. M1 killers can only use their m1 to down people. Mettle activates by getting hit. Survivors are going to get hit and killers are going to hit survivors. Both of those are natural parts if playing the game. So it ends up punishing (I detailed what I meant by punishing in my last comment) the killer for playing the game and rewards the survivor for just playing the game, neither of which I think are solid design.
---
There are two things you forget about MoM.
---
 1. The hit also slows the killer while boosting the survivor. SB gives you a head start but doesnt slow you down as a killer (unless you swing and miss but that's your own fault).
---
2. MoM can be stacked on top of an exhaustion perk to waste even more time. 
---
3. The once per game thing doesnt mean much when it activates mostly in the latter part if the game, which as I've said before is more often than not the deciding factor in how a match will end. No matter what killer I'm playing if I can get rid if mettle at 3-t gens then that's awesome, it leaves me room to snowball late game. The reality is that you have to either play a killer strong enough to get pressure quickly (in which case mettle doesnt hurt you that much anyways) or the survivors have to make some big mistakes early on (which you dont really have control over.
---
SIDENOTE: I'm not saying that your skill doesnt matter with killers and that it only matters what killer you play, but there is a difference between the capability and consistency of trapper and wraith vs Nurse, Billy and Spirit.
---
Was Legion powerful before his rework? No. But don't doesn't mean this sub won't downvote the fuck out of anyone saying legion statistically had one of the lowest kills per game. This sub is very sensitive when you make recommendations to tiers
---
thats not from a dev thats just straight from the community forums
---
i meant to me when i get the rare 40ms no chainsaw sucks me in. but i rarely get anything below 80
---
And no, I cannot test this, as I am yet to buy the game for PC (I am playing the 3 day free trial) 
---
However, kiddos', I used to be a P3 Freddy on the PS4 before I sold it, sadly no character transfer tho...
---
Yup, pretty much any killer who's power doesn't help them close distance fast
---
It has been a mess on PS4 since rank reset, sometimes works sometimes it doesn't. It happens randomly to random players regardless of rank.
---
Last week I couldn't play for 2 days. Could play for 3 days then happened again the day after. This week I havent had any problem.
---
I know people that have had this issue as well.
---
Nobody has time to be hopping in lockers every 30 seconds or so..
---
i actually am okay with any type of slugging. i just hated he needed to do that in two men game. bitch move
---
This is great, survivor version pls
---
Also, did your girlfriend play life is strange or something? Because Chloe is a character in that game that's edgy
---

Next save it, then go to properties on Gameusersettings.cfg and set it to read only so the game doesn't change the file automatically
---
i see you're a man of culture as well
---
If a team or person has been toxic I like to down the last person, carry to the hatch, drop them making them think I‚Äôm giving it to them, then slam it shut. Now that they are pissed I walk them to the exit gate and pretend like I‚Äôm letting them leave, only to down them again as soon as they get it open.
---
People don‚Äôt want to play survivor right now.
---
We all hope you will stick to that hiatus
---
Because she's a hard worker and helps people with their problems
---
You can‚Äôt blame him, he probably is trying to keep his rank at all costs
---
With this system, the way to get Merciless is to intentionally make the game long. For example, get a 3 gen strat.
---
As Trapper, grabbing Survivors out of traps will cause you to miss out on Chaser and (if they were healthy) Malicious points.
---
As Huntress, you miss out on Chaser points if you get hatchet hits outside of a chase.
---
I want to run brutal strength, enduring and sprit fury on pig. Maybe even throw in bamboozle to make the ultimate anti loop build. But I don‚Äôt have brutal yet
---
I literally tried all of the fixes before checking Reddit. Wish I had seen everyone was having issues. I hope they get this worked out!
---
Gotcha. Yeah even at that ping I get hit by some bullshit chainsaws. That's just hit boxes for you though.
---
Loved reading this.

---
Forgot to add in, 
---
Once in game set the resolution down to 0 again
---
You can't show me a single stream where a killer gets dommed back to back to back by MoM.
---
The only way MoM makes killer unfun is if you're trash at chases, which is like 1 in 10 killers. You're practically guaranteed to get one hook per survivor before it even procs, which half the time is all it takes to get them out of the game.
---
Plus there are many killers that can get the one hit down, plus there's NOED &amp; you don't even need to get 1k to walk away with the most points.
---
Gladly will, I'd hope for it too since you're probably an ass survivor and would die a lot to me.
---
If anyone reads that first comment and thinks your in the right, they are just as dimwitted as you are. I didn't ask you to comment, you were never going to follow anyways, plain and simple. Yes i get angry when i know im doing nothing wrong and someone decides to be a dick for no reason. Stop trying to create a narrative that im such a terrible person, this is laughable. And i can see there wont be us being amicable so i'll dismiss myself.
---
No, because the act of disengaging doesn't secure you any pressure on the map, so like I said, horrible idea.
---
If it's worked, it's because you went up against bad survivors or you got a lucky Ruin spawn or something.
---
We need speedo Quentin
---
I can hit my shots like a fuckin maniac, soooo when bbq comes out into shrine I'll get it
---
You starting shit with me literally proved my point.
---
Whichever I feel like, and uhh, the playstyle where I hit survivors, down them, and then hook them? The fuck kind of question is that?
---
...he does look like Bruce though? Old Bruce yeah, but it's still Bruce.
---
I initially picked nea because she reminded me of Chloe from life is strange, but now I play Jeff because he's Jesus
---
Asks geniune question
---
Op curses in response "you're the one starting shit"
---
ü§îü§î
---
Survivors should be punished for lobby dodging? That is, DCing in a game that they don‚Äôt want to be in? (eg. 5-blink ebony mori nurse). Don‚Äôt you think if a survivor would also leave pre-match if they knew what they were getting into? 
---
But you‚Äôre more concerned for the poor killer that has to go against someone that t-bagged them?
---
I‚Äôm having the same issue as well. For about a month now finding survivors has been taking much longer than it usually did. Maybe there aren‚Äôt enough survivors or there just might be more killers than usual.
---
Summer vacation is starting for most students by now so hopefully there‚Äôll be more people playing DBD
---
Yeah, I thought I'd go for some remaining adepts after the rank reset, but I only managed to do the Trapper and decided it wasn't worth it for the other ones. You have to be lucky the survivors don't do gens early and then hook everyone as often as possible. So you're reliant on survivors being a bit potato so they don't rush you and go down early in a chase. That's how you get the gatekeeper and chaser emblems. Then you have to rely on them again to not kill themselves on the hook to get the sacrifice one. If you're too good and kill them all quickly, you can't get the chaser and sacrifice emblems. It's pretty stupid and I hope they change it back to needing 4 sacrifices. No idea why they changed it in the first place.
---
i don't think i ever had a Billy with ~40ms tbh. had Nurses, Spirits, even Huntresses maybe couple times. it does make huge difference. getting Billies in green ping would always resolve in pretty normal hitboxes too unless some lag spike but then everyone feels it.

Ugh. I've hated Billy ever since release. 115% movement speed killer with no downsides to his M1 game, PLUS having an insta down ability whenever he wants, PLUS doubling as an insane map pressure ability that doubles his speed. The worst part about billy to me is he can just follow right behind you until he's riding your ass, rev up and get a free instadown unless you happen to be right next to a pallet. I've always hated billy.
---
Then I consistently face survivors with the big dumb. What I would do to MoM is remove the speed boost after being hit and make it an Exhaustion perk so it doesn't stack. Or make it increase Killer hit recovery by any %.
---
Why are you beeing soo toxic?
---
I love supporting new streamers but you just proved me there is no point in supporting you
---
But why bother arguing with a toxic streamer that cant even tell when he is acting wrong?
---
You cant grow a channel with such toxic behaviours
---
I've caught myself doing this and there's always a brief moment of awkwardness if I miss the lunge until I lean away from the monitor back into my chair.
---
that's very good. that is literally my build on Piggy when i don't feel like thinking and mindgaming. anyone else but billy having this build is a-okay to my survivor experience.
---
I'll use an example from a game I had once upon a time versus a Spirit. A Claudette broke Haunted Grounds, then immediately DC'd. Spirit found me cleansing a dull totem, downed me, hooked me. An injured Nea unhooked me, Spirit came back to the hook, Nea &amp; I ran in the same direction, Spirit ignored her entirely - though we were both injured - downed me again and hooked me, let the Nea get away. That is tunneling. We were both wounded, it would have been just as easy to go for the Nea, but she only wanted me.
---
Another example, I was in a match versus a Pig, back when you had to do 2 gens for hatch to spawn. Two teammates dead, me &amp; a David King left. I unhook David while trying to get a gen done, and instead of letting me heal him, insists on Self-Caring *right under the hook.* No surprise, he was downed again &amp; died. That wasn't intentional tunneling, that was a survivor being stupid and paying for it.

---
I loved the old scoring method. I took about 6-10 months off the game and this makes no sense any more wit the emblems. I don‚Äôt get why killing everyone efficiently and effectively would punish me.
---
You‚Äôre totally right, it takes the perfect situation to even be able to have a chance at Merciless.
---
Good job blacking out the player's names.
---
I guess you're right there. A solution could be to remove the speed boost and make it an Exhaustion perk, or even increase Killer Hit Recovery for X% for X seconds.
---
Excellent point. A good nurse your done for lol
---
Yay my main likes borscht
---
the smoothest criminal
---
Thanks
---
I try not to go after people who were just unhooked but rather their savior. They'll run off to usually heal which is good because you take that person and the person who saved them off of gens.
---
Of course every encounter is going to be different. Sometimes the person who was unhooked just runs into you, or they're the only person you find when you go back to that area.
---
Because I, too, am a pale woman with a history of crazy-colored hair &amp; a love of street art.
---
Even though I pretty much never run any of her perks.
---
what's there to keep? he was red ranks(2 i think? it was red 100% cause i am rank 4 survivor and my teammates were late purple). i'm currently rank 4 on my killer and play maybe 3-4 killer games per day. pipping as killer didn't change much unless you camp/tunnel.
---
I don‚Äôt know what it is, but no one in my games on PS4 knows how to deal with Spirit. She‚Äôs my go to when I want a quick and easy win.
---
Good old Narnia Juke
---
He probably was really desperate to keep his rank or wanted to get to rank 1
---
Sigh this sucks
---
I wish it was :(
---
When I first started playing I loved nearly shitting my pants, It‚Äôs just not the same no more
---
Wanted to chill a bit playing killer ‚Äòcause survivor was a mess but rip :(
---
Battlepass cosmetics lookin nice
---
Did you even check my channel out? LMAO 
---
BTW to anyone reading this, HIIIIIII my name is Stephanie.
---
Honestly, I have no clue what to do with the perk. Maybe if it had a bigger downside that made it not hurt late game as much. That or find a way make it affect top tier killers more than m1 killers, but I have no clue how you would do that. The proposed nerf is interesting but I'm curious how its gonna play out. I dont want it to be useless but it needs some changing, IMO.
---
Disagree, at least with Legion I know when I can get out of his power. Waking up is still too RNG to ever be enjoyable. They both have bullshit lunges so it‚Äôs not like either of them were fun in the first place.
---
Yup you were and I digress.
---
Prayer Beads: am I a joke to you?

Good to see a post FINALLY saying something along thr lines of "this game is great" rather than be like the majority of the posts saying "fuck this game."

its okay, now you know so you can call him that from now on

What did you bring upon this hallowed ground*

Werent you leaving this argument?

And hell no i didnt check

You lost me when you told me to fuck off

And oh boi a gamer guuurl "LMAO BTW" i hope you dont stream much because we dont need any more assholes streamers like yourself
---
The world needs more people like you :)
---
This one is from hills run red. Happy death day would probably be stupud.
---
It‚Äôs awesome, honestly. Just have to take the hits when you‚Äôre already through a window and running. I like to think it balances out in the end. 
---
Again, once you get those perks you want the grind and stress disappears.
---
Don't forget to bring Remember Me just to spice it up a bit more
---
I‚Äôll save a purple key for you!
---
I know i was making a genuine question! Finnaly you are starting to see!
---
It's wasted on me lol, I'm terrible at the game, but I love it nonetheless
---
I do that too. In game when I get a hit I make my character walk backwards when downing someone. I don't know why but I guess it feels In character or something.
---
I chuckled.
---
You wouldn‚Äôt even stand a chance against me, but that‚Äôs not the point of your op. The survivors had 3 get out of jail free cards or ‚Äúcrutches‚Äù as you toxic scumbags called them. Adrenaline, mom and ds. 2 of them are now nerfed to complete worthlessness, and from the amount of bitching killers like you do adrenaline isn‚Äôt that far behind. I can tell you are solely one sided since you clearly think the devs are ruining this game for killers but In all reality they are doing the complete opposite. They are making it so much easier for killers to win games but because you‚Äôre butt hurt because of a perk now this game is unfair? The end game collapse, the buff to hex ruin, the nerf 2 survivor perks constantly, I‚Äôm waiting for the day when survivors can‚Äôt even use perks anymore because it‚Äôs to hard for a trash killer main like you to do anything because it‚Äôs unfair and the game is unbalanced.
---
Welcome to the Fog! As others said, hiding is sometimes necessary but don‚Äôt be afraid to do gens. What you‚Äôll see a lot of in early ranks is a team of terrified people all just crouching everywhere, too afraid to do anything.
---
While the survivors are mostly just cosmetic skins for veteran players, who you choose early will matter since they will have only their unique perks. I strongly suggest Dwight, honestly. His perks encourage team synergy and Bond is invaluable to new players. Feng and Meg are great choices as well as they have tools to escape the chase. Claudette is often the go-to in the start because of her high immersion and ability to heal herself. While I don‚Äôt disagree that she‚Äôs very good, I think Self-Care is often a bit underused in low ranks, simply because if you haven‚Äôt been able to practice escaping a chase, you won‚Äôt be able to use it. I much prefer Bond for finding teammates and it gives a map awareness that will make learning the game that much more comfortable. 
---
Also I am sure you know this but I see it every rank reset so I‚Äôm just gonna say it... fast vaults make a noise notification for the killer. Shutting a chest prematurely notifies the killer as well. I see so many newer players do this and it makes me nuts lol. 
---
My last tip, which people may or may not agree with. If a killer has Ruin (causing that annoying red skillcheck meter on Gens), don‚Äôt necessarily be afraid to tough through it. I feel like it‚Äôs an important skill to learn honestly, as you‚Äôre only going to encounter it more and more. I think staying on it is especially helpful if you are with someone. Often times, all 4 of us get on a gen only to realize the killer has Ruin and then everyone but me leaves to search for it. Now it should definitely be looked for and cleansed, not saying you can necessarily ignore it for 5 whole gens, but if you have the teammates together, it‚Äôs a better use of time to commit to the gen before looking. The killer wants nothing more than all 4 people scrambling around not doing gens. Don‚Äôt be afraid to be the gen jockey and lessen that burden a bit for you and the team. (:
---
That's great.
---
I'd do something better, personally.
---
This just happened to me 10 seconds ago. did we get the same killer today üòÖ
---
They both have beanies, their voices are nice, and I like their perks.
---
Right now, I'm working on getting the Pig to P3L50. I already have Legion and Michael there. Thr main reason I want to get to P3L50 is because then I have no reason NOT to get every perk.
---
so true
---
If I run Rule Set 2, I always put an indoor map offering. That way the trapped survivors have to pop a gen and screw themselves or waste a lot of time searching for the boxes
---
why not run bbq? how can you pass up on extra bloodpoints?!
---
The two exit gates are always on the opposit sides of the map right. So when the killer isn't at your gate open it and look out for him/her. When you see them running over to you or hear the heartbeat hide or go to the other gate and just repeat until one is open. 3 minutes is more than enough time for that.
---
Hope is the best perk of all time. Change my mind
---
Uh maybe your addons affect your  playstyle and that's maybe why you are experiencing issues with freddy
---
He's still weaker than most killers, even when played well. You can learn to play a low tier well. And before you say I should play freddy more, he was my killer I got to rank 1 with. But a god tier freddy and a god tier huntress, there's just not much comparison.
---
Its dbd no one gets along with the other side
---
Pig and Myers are so much fun. Some of the best in the game for it. Try Myers with all the plague perks. Super fun. Maybe throw in blood warden.
---
No I‚Äôm saying that about 70% of survivals was in some part because of Wake up!
---
why are you looking for excuses? it is clear with current pipping you won't get a pip if 2 people disconnected upon being downed no matter what you as killer or survivor do. your best chance is to get a safety. on red ranks that is. the Billy i faced was a cunt with over 1.5k hours with his whole comment section being -rep tunneling/camping braindead Billy. and so with that what he did is got 1000 more bp refusing at least one of two remaining people who actually saved his black pip by staying 7000k points. 
---
don't get me wrong. i'm a red rank killer main. i understand why killers do what they do sometimes even if it's not pretty. but this i don't understand. it is a bitch move and bullshit cause he wasted too much time looking for me and actually slugged twice cause first time i picked the Claude up. second i just got bored and let him kill me cause i ain't doing that shit. honestly, i could have let her die cause that Billy wasn't good enough to find or catch me without wasting too much time. both times he hooked me is because i tanked his chainsaw while unhooking Claudette.
---
"FACE PALM"
---
Stop talking about killers that have a one-shot or don't use M1, obviously this isn't applicable to them, you fucking moron.
---
I don't need to justify my own personal experience with evidence of SOMEONE ELSE playing. You're dumb as fuck.
---
I don't care to prove that the perk is busted to you. The devs commenting and saying it's going to be changed should tell you enough, as well as any reputable streamer saying the perk is complete bullshit, since you care so much about streamers. Shut the fuck up and get a grip on basic balance of the game.
---
Read my post! Once you have all the perks you need/want you can stray a bit and try other builds. I still run it with Billy if I do all turning add ons or the doom add ons.
---
This was fun but i have to go now, bye.
---
Why dont you like fucking myers i would love to have sex with him
---
Slower killers like the hag or spirt.
---
I'd still put him a solid step above the likes of Clown, Trapper, Bubba, Doctor, and Plague.  Huntress is number 5 in my list, Freddy's number 7.
---
I'm in game
---
that hatch should reopen if the last survivor is in chase for 20 seconds or something
---
Is the PTB out?
---
I mean, his real name is Max.
---
Fair enough, I'd agree on everything except probably plague.
---
Did it just load in or is there anything you had to do?
---
Slugging the last two survivors then letting them finish the generators
---
Just loaded in
---
&gt; ^^" ^^hurr ^^durr ^^i'm ^^super ^^funny ^^and ^^original "
---
Yah I just got in also
---
Can we get Fleshpound in DBD thanks
---
When people make that comparison, it's less about the strength and more about the learning curve.  Nurse requires muscle memory, while Freddy requires a playstyle that's not really used by anyone else in the game.  Strength-wise Nurse is no doubt the strongest, but I'd still take Freddy over half of the killers in the game.
---
I thought I was the only ridiculous killer here.
---
Oh wait the beta code I received isnt working and its not on test build
---
The virgin Billy main
---
Needs BBQ to find survivors

Needs spirit fury and enduring to deal with loops

Needs good add ons or will DC after a loop
---
The chad Myers main
---
Uses M&amp;A like a CHAMP
---
Strides around the map with big dick energy
---
Will fucking bamboozle the shack loop
---
No add ons: terrifying, using good addons: FUCKING terrifying
---
Why is the killer the asshole here? Because your teammates d/c'd? Why is the expectation that the one who didn't literally queue up for co-op mode face consequences of your teammates' actions?
---
lmao
---
im screaming XD
---
I never face camp unless it‚Äôs a extremely toxic player or a toxic 4 man, I hate when i survivor will block someone else to try and get the killer to get them. I will let the blocke run away and face camp the fuck out of the blocker.

Freddy makes the best use out of it for 3 reasons:
---
1. The obvious is he's an m1 killer, so he has no choice but to build up stacks when playing the game.
---
2. He is the best at not losing stacks. As long as you know who your obsession is, when you find them, just sleep them but don't hit them. This way you'll save stacks, and also slow the game down by having that person asleep. Most other killers just have to ignore the obsession and give up a free hit while getting nothing in return, but Freddy can make some good out of q bad situation. (Bonus points that the obsession cant force you to hit them if they catch on)
---
3. Freddy has an easy time getting the first hit, but struggles with the second. STBFL helps greatly with this.
---
I love using the perk, it's so satisfying getting your full stacks and is super great in certain situations, like people unhooking in your face, and basement parties
---
well aren't you a little angry~~~
---
Yup... Use the prayer beads for added jump scarey-ness.
---
I love the whole fake-phase pallet stand off. Seeing people run away and then run back to the pallet bevause they think I've phased. Omg it makes me laugh every time. 
---
I love this killer a lot.
---
for real!
---
&gt;you still gotta gangster lean all the way over there
---
I love you.
---
Oi don't you be calling me out
---
40 meters. They‚Äôll appear in white if you can teleport, red if you‚Äôre too far away.
---
I like the jumpscare Myers build. I just need the perks for pallets then that build will be godly!
---
She literally bodyblocked her from leaving by running in circles she's the idiot.
---
Bbq ruin, youre also pretty damn meta main
---
Meg got blocked by Kate
---
Oh I love doing this, it shows that I'm really excited about the match c:
---
40 meters without addons.
---
Oh I know how to be effective with Freddy... not being able to attack a survivor for a good few seconds until they finally fall asleep isn't fun. And when a survivor is a sleep, you bet you're gonna get pallet looped to oblivion. The only thing he has going for him in the chase is his extended lunge hitbox, because they lengthen his claws for the animation.
---
Cool.
---
Catch ya in the fog!

I doubt they call it the battle pass that would be lame
---
Shouldn't take your teammates for granted. When you see the chance to escape then go for it, you don't have to flaunt your flashlight in the killer's eyes.
---
If she didn't use her flashlight at all and just kept running, she could've easily escaped with no complications.
---
Where is u/Glen0ck when you need him
---
You know what thats actually not to far fetched lol

I'm aware, doesnt change the fact meg was flashlight spamming and wasted time she had to leave. Again, not Kate's problem to allow a meghead to fs spam lol
---
At high rank, it's play Billy or Nurse or get shit on. That's just the reality of the game. Can't blame people for wanting to have a hit of fun playing a video game. Playing Michael in high rank without good add-ons is not a fun game for a killer.
---
It's weird reading some of these comments because some of you all are outing yourselves as either boosted survivors or really bad ones. If Billy's instadown is your issue with Billy, let me introduce you vaulting or running perpendicularly or even hugging a tiny pile of junk while he revvs up. Billy is good because he can move across the map at great speed and find chases with little downtime. If you're not getting M1'd to death against Billy, you're doing it wrong. The only exception is instasaw Billy.
---
Should have censored names, this will get removed
---
True. I actually don't use the ambush dash because of the sound cues. If I hear someone working on a gen and I'm going in for the kill, I'll uncrouch and rush them.
---
Right!
---
Thats with monitor and abuse and red paintbrush

Yeah but the survivor can just let time run out if they decide they don't want you to have the kill. Because somehow dying to the entity isn't a kill, so survivors can basically troll the game by making no effort, it's the hatch camp with no winners and the survivor controls the outcome.
---
The hatch was implemented to allow for the final survivor to have some chance of escaping. 
---
Survivors abused this mechanic and turned it into a free win/incredible time waster. So it needed a change. 
---
With this new mechanic, although killer favored in most situations, survivors still have the chance to escape. As much as I hate 50/50 situations, it is the best way to implement their original idea. 
---
Stay by a door and hope for the best. 
---
By the way, the killer will always take priority over the survivor when it comes to hatch closing/escaping. The killer will always win.
---
Tbf, the killer ain't gonna find him now.
---
Would you mind enlightening me on exactly why L√©ry's is so painful as Nurse?
---
lmao did everyone die in the basement?
---
A tale as old as time.
---
NERF FREDDY
---
hillbilly = billy = bill = will = william
---
I would‚Äôve hit her on the hook.
---
Use the transition to get into a position where you can hit a survivor once you become real. Freddy is invisible 5 seconds into the transition  for 1 whole second before becomeing visible for 0.7, becomeing real after. With sheep block this becomes 0.2 seconds of visibility before becomeing real. After you get the first hit fuck off and apply pressure to other survivors while keeping a close eye on the injured. Once the injured comes out of dream world transition them again and get the down. Sometimes if you lucky the surv will get out imidiately leading to a faster down. I recomend watching pyruses guide on the dream transition.
---
Closing the hatch on the last downed survivor... then teabagging the last down survivor as Pig.
---
Is it you db?
---
It wasn‚Äôt that great but I did enjoy the game, no idea BHVR worked on it. Seems the folks over there really enjoy some slasher flicks.
---
Yet another instance of this community taking what its content creators do or say and blowing it way out of proportion or context.

---
Unlike teabagging, closing the hatch grants more points.
---
Who else but a Claudette honestly.
---
Eh I suppose. It's all semantics to me.
---
Yeah I kind of feel the same about the perk. I'm interested in seeing how it plays out on a PTB.
---
Also that might make bringing in Wake Up worth it. Right now with how close the gates are to each other you could bring Wake Up and it won‚Äôt make a difference, you‚Äôll still be dead. Personally, I think Wake Up needs a buff to the opening speed, then I think it would be worth a perk slot.
---
Yeah, if I think the killer will get to me within the next 5 seconds, I'll stay, otherwise I'll leave
---
Imagine this was his rework
---
THANK YOU! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Every BLOODY time.
---
If the trap is activated it does, just not if you put one on after the final gen pops.
---
Yeah, she definitely looks nothing like Jamie. Not surprised though, I‚Äôm sure her likeness isn‚Äôt cheap.
---
No, I mean - There's a 2500 deviousness point bonus if you kill all survivors. I didn't get that bonus
---
I can't find match as survivor, but as killer i can easily. Mb script is broken?
---
I'm not talking about the hook versus disconnect bonus. I'm talking about the 2500 points you're rewarded at the end if all survivors die
---
No, I like the thought of it as a reward for certain actions. Just getting M1'd is not nearly enough criteria. Taking body blocks for a teammate, as the devs were theorizing, is however. But it shouldn't be three hits if that's the case.
---
If i cant make it out alive NO ONE can
---
When can we get a knife controller that swipes and lunges with us??
---
That sandbag though
---
Weird flex but ok...
---
I‚Äôve been playing against a bunch of Freddie‚Äôs lately on PS4. Shits annoying
---
That's a rollercoaster of emotions... but highly deserved.
---
The only insult in that entire slew that you listed was the last one where I called someone a moron, which was entirely deserved. Grow a pair of nuts, you sensitive dumbass. lmao
---
How does my talking down on Nurse and Billy have anything to do with being good at the game or not? I'm talking about playing killer and saying Nurse and Billy are stupid (Nurse far more so, Billy isn't really that big a deal), and you're correlating that to my being bad at killer? Are your parents directly related?
---
I just think it's important because a lot of redditors on this sub misinformed everyone saying that Legion had gotten a rework, and even today most people talk about "Legion rework" and discuss it assuming it was a rework, when 1) Devs NEVER talked about reworking Legion, McLean said they were looking at modifying some aspects of Feral Frenzy 2) It ended up as that, a variation of Feral Frenzy and speed increase for balance purposes. And still today I have to argue with people that believe Legion got a rework and are dissapointed because they thought he was gonna get a totally new power or something like that. That's why wording is important to me.
---
PTB should air in less than two weeks, or in around two weeks,  if I'm not mistaken.
---
That is true.
---
Tbh i rarely have that much problems with mikey in high ranks. But i rarely face against very sweaty swf's so i would consider myself lucky. 
---
That being said billy feels like the one killer i cant get away when i do play survivor. I usually stay close to loops to i force him to m1. Dunno whats so hard about billy.
---

This tool is completely safe, light, and allows you to save screenshots in seconds. Also allows you to easily draw arrows and such on the screenshots. Both my parents installed it and they told me it's the best productivity tool for them since coffee. I recommend it for your digital life in general; not just this experiment.
---
It's stupid why would you stand there to let me live, when your job is to kill me? Killers who think like that are stupid. "Oh I am a nice killer" no you are a stupid killer.. your job is to kill people not be nice.
---
blame? i called him a bitch
---
Can you close it while invisible?
---
Yeah well I'd rather go up against her than instadown chainsaw bois.
---
Most spirits I play against NEVER phase during the pallet stand off... So I just crouch away until I see her move, then I haul ass. Running back to the pallet is risky and stupid imo, idk why people do it. 
---
They could do what I do or run a certain distance and double back just in case.
---
And yeah, prayer beads are a little op. I do think it needs a nerf, like making her ability cooldown longer, reducing passive phasing. Something like that. It's probably her strongest add on.
---
Claudette for invisibility
---
Doctor cause I enjoy annoying people
---
Deep wounds is a condition where a survivor must mend themselves within a certain time period (I think 15 seconds) or suffer being downed
---
This thing... I‚Äôve done it before
---
There will always be bias towards either sides. Billy's unfun to go against because he's strong and can easily snowball off a single down. The reason he's unfun is because it's PvP and the harder the game, the more unfun it gets. Only problem is if you play a weaker killer, the game becomes unfun for you. If you play a stronger one, it becomes unfun for them. Someone's going to lose
---
This dude is grossly over exaggerating things.
---
The Kate did the world justice. Love to see it. Go Kate!
---
Some people never change no matter how right you are. But making fun of this isn‚Äôt good for anyone, i will personally leave as i see no point of playing if another player can just buy more rewards.
---
I mean, he used to be really bad because legitimate infinites existed, so I don't get why you'd hate release billy. Now? Sure. Back on release? Why?
---
You‚Äôre a toxic scumbag and complete waste of human anatomy, are you sure he‚Äôs the sensitive dumbass? You‚Äôre literally bitching on Reddit about not being handed a win in a video game you self entitled prick. Clearly he‚Äôs correlating that you‚Äôre bad at killer because you‚Äôre on reddit bitching about a perk that makes the game a little harder for you, I‚Äôm sorry your mom and dad are brother and sister and you‚Äôre used to having them give you everything in the trailer park. But sorry buddy the world isn‚Äôt the same way they can‚Äôt give you you‚Äôre cousin Bertha like you want anymore.
---
Honestly
---
There aint nothing better than hearing how a survivor shat his/her pants cos you played mikey so well. That is what sustains me.
---
Oh, yes, absolutely. I was just making a joke about the absurdity of how good you need to be at meltyboi to get kills
---
I think it was dumb to change it now that escaping is the deciding factor in pippin essentially. One game I had 3 other categories full and died. Safety pip. Not that I care about rank by why make ranking up harder in a game where rank simply doesn't matter at all.
---
Don't forget to use red paint brush with it!
---
For me it feels like either the doors seem to always be too close to each other or two far, I play killer and survivor about 60K/40S and even as killer it feels very unrewarding just handed the 4k because gates are near each other and hatch spawns below you
---
He‚Äôs a pizza guy and I‚Äôm not trying to blend into the environment to have an unfair advantage
---
also, killer pipping didn't change much. i'm a red rank killer myself. also a red rank survivor. and getting a pip as a red rank survivor is MUCH fukin harder than killer.
---
Scratched mirror, Lery‚Äôs, M&amp;A,
---
Much pants shitting to be found
---
The values are multiplicative rather than additive.
---
Dang, I replied to you but my internet is so shitty that the reply got lost.
---
No, AITH only affects add-ons and Plunderer's only affects main items, so both are independent of each other. I'm just keeping a "with plunderer's" and a "without plunderer's" folder, both using AITH.
---
Here is some extra helpful stuff I found from playing with my partner:
---
1- Shiny coin (offering that adds 2 chests) stacks. Therefore, near the end I got an extra friend to help us and we had 7 chests per map. Much more efficient this way! Perhaps I could add you on Steam and invite you over next time I KYF with my partner? Nine chests per map would just be BEAUTIFUL.
---
2- We chose Lampkin Lane because it's small and straightforward to search. Killer takes one side of the street and survivor searches the other. We use Myer's house (where the basement usually is; has a pumpkin on the front porch) as a reference point. If you have a better idea of map, I'm all ears.
---
3- Perk setup depends if other people are helping you in your KYF match: 
---
* Without other survivors and without Plunderer's: Object of Obssession (reveals killer aura to make it much easier to go to him when he finds a chest), AITH, No Mither and Resilience (these two combo together; pretty small benefit but oh well).
---
* Without other survivors and with Plunderer's: Object of Obssession, AITH, Plunderer's Instinct and Open-Handed.
---
* With other survivors, no Plunderer's: Like the first one, but change Resilience for Empathy.
---
* With other survivors, with Plunderer's: Like second one, change Open-Handed for Bond.
---
Prayer beads are straight up broken and have no counter play past gen tapping. Spirit by herself is really strong, but her add-ons turn her into nurse 2.0. Having her turn into fucking sonic and zoom up your ass while you can't even avoid her because you're moaning and groaning like a second grade prostitute leaves very little skill involved. I've hated her since she first came around, and I'd easily take a billy over her any day(And especially bubba. He's not even in the same realm as either of those two)
---
Ash looks like Ash.  What are you talking about?
---
I agree. Although, I think it's less "fear of missing out" and more "fear of being overwhelmed" lmao. Maybe they should have different passes for different sides. So one for survivor, one for killer, and then another one that combines both. I dont know. I still dont know how to feel about the battle pass in general. I'm more hyped for a mobile dbd and ghostface at the moment.
---
Again with the insults, I see. Apparently you can't read as I said you were arguing with people as well as insulting, you illiterate fucking halfwit. (I can insult you, too!)
---
The correlation between you talking shit on said killers and having no skill at the game is the obvious fact that you clearly can't use these top-tier killers, as well as the fact that you can't handle having to hit a survivor ONE extra time. Otherwise, you wouldn't be talking so much shit.
---
Maybe you shouldn't use a discussion community if you can't handle other people's input without whining.
---
Speak for yourself.
---
There are 2 reasons for this.
---
1. This is a recording, it smooths out missing frames.
---
2. Vertical Sync @60fps, apparently skill-checks are easy mode with no input-delay &amp; 120hz+.
---
Plague isn't super abusable and even though she's boring she's not really like game-breaking. Imo she's more of most people would think of clown as annoying but not super annoying (although I personally fucking hate clown because his fog makes me I'll irl)
---
Two things - Firstly, the treshold is lower for survivors specifically because it's harder
---
Secondly, you're asking him to throw away his safety pip so you can keep yours. This is the most selfish shit I've heard all day, and I honestly am glad he chose not to be selfless towards someone so entitled to their safety pip that they disregard anyone else's
---
Also, you are still saying he's the guaranteed SOLE reason why you got fucked up(Because you put way more emphasis on your hatred for him, than your own teammates), even though two people disconnecting is about 100x worse than anything other than omegablink nurse
---
That skill check tick moves like butter here. I'm used to it moving in 30 degree increments on my busted ass PS4.
---
The solution is to play Doctor at high rank and then nobody is having fun.
---
The ignorance here is astounding. They make BUCKET loads of money on their current cosmetics store.
---
There is ZERO need to do a battle pass outside of wanting even MORE money on top of the truckloads they already have.
---
Still. June September December March. Very clear patterns very doable.
---
Ah, I've been doing all of this in public matches because I still want to get bloodpoints and shards
---
I can get you another set of 50, maybe 2 more sets of 50
---
Agree with this one, I often say things like  ‚ÄúAw that‚Äôs really nice of you to say‚Äù
---
And ‚ÄúGg wp really a good team‚Äù.
---
You would be surprised how often they realize they went too far
---
He‚Äôs a troll bro. Let him go.
---
He seemed way more unfair back then, not to mention he was hands down the best of the three starting killers. I was also worse at the game of course.
---
Why Did The Caption
---
Need To Be Formatted Like This?
---
For killer I would use shadowborn, Deerstalker and Stridor. For survivor I would use tenacity, buckle-up and maybe resilience.
---
What‚Äôs his xbox name let me send him some love
---
Claudette?
---
Immersed.
---
Ok my last comment, firstly u didn‚Äôt say everyone and I just want the game to have equal opportunities for everyone without pay to reward mechanisms. Is that so hard?
---
you literally called me stoned because i disagreed but ok
---
Yeah there is and it‚Äôs called don‚Äôt get hooked. Bam so hard
---
Billy is fine as long as he's not using his power to camp survivors the whole match. Some Billy players just drop everything and go back to the hook so they can tunnel. They're like dogs hearing the sound of a can opener. It's ironic, because everything I hate about that playstyle is pretty much Hag in a nutshell. Hag is probably my least favorite killer in the game because everything about her just says camp.
---
A double hit.
---
Because it's for flavor.
---
Since everyone is talking about Wake Up, it does two main things against Freddy.
---
1) It "counters" Remember Me by allowing you to open the door that much faster. Opening a door 15% faster isn't much when it's 20 seconds, but (prior to the changes) it's quite a bit faster when opening the door takes 50 seconds. Not really worth taking the perk for that (Showing others that you're opening that door is the big part of the perk), but still.
---
2) It's flavorful for up against Freddy that you can "Wake Up" out of the dream easier.
---
They do this all the time; The reason why Laurie has perks that counter being the Obsession is because Micheal Myers's perks require an Obsession to function.
---
...multiplicative is more than additive?
---
You realize there‚Äôs already unofficial gameplay of the new killer right? It‚Äôs Ghostface
---
Damn, alright, thanks.
---
OG Fleshpound is the thing of nightmares
---
I think you got the "blood in your mouth" trophy and are confused
---
nope it was this achievement I ivory moried a nea at the start of a game and it gave it to me
---
This was already posted, by me
---
Type of Bug: Ingame / Visual
---
Description: The hatch spawned and my friend was searching for it. He heard it, but the hatch wasn't there. There was the sound of the hatch, but the hatch itself wasn't appearing, neither the prompt to jump on it.  
---
Couldn't reproduce the bug, and this is the first time this happened to me  
---
obs: Someone DCed in the first minutes of the match, maybe this have something related to the bug
---
Spine chill. 
---
Seeing your character just standing there for no good reason. 
---
They know you have surveillance. 
---
Blind luck. 
---
Plenty of ways.
---
Feng and spirit cuz they‚Äôre best girls :3
---
This, Myers, and Hag gets me. I have hundreds of hours in the game and these never fail to spook me. One of the few setups that actually scare me and instill paranoia.
---
No facecamping for flashlight clicker?
---
D.I.S.A.P.P.O.I.N.T.E.D.
---
Obstacles and LoS breakers *should* give an advantage, I say that as someone who plays both roles.
---
...But the corn feels borderline broken with certain characters. If you wear prestige, or anything dark green or brown, it is disorienting beyond belief. I literally strain my eyes trying to keep track of them since it all blurs together, but as soon as they exploit the spins and circles you can't even use scratches because they scrawl everywhere and give no indication where they went.
---
And I'm not a new player, I've been playing for over a year now, but fighting three teams who knew exactly how to abuse the corn in the row was the most frustrating thing I've gone through in a long time. They can be right in front of you, spin, and by the time you turn around to catch them they're just *gone*.
---
oof and yeah I'll do that
---
Oh I know, I was just referencing a meme.
---
If you deliberately run into the nearest cornfield and spin in circles because you *know* corn blindness is a thing, you're cheesing, don't @me.
---
Yeah insidious pairs nicely with pill bottle. Too bad we're going to be losing that Freddy though...
---
Yeah that's the reality of higher ranks. Either pick broken builds on killers or play hillbilly/ nurse. I hope so much they will focus on making it so other killers are at a level of relevance as them.
---
I love for whatever reason playing clown but God damn, unless you get really lucky they will have gens done in a moment's notice.
---
As I understand it, a battle pass only gets you cosmetics, no gameplay advantage. So what‚Äôs the big deal?
---
Sadly they got the terminator license and put him into Death Garden, that game has like 10 people on at a time at most. Such a waste of what could have potentially been a really interesting chapter.
---
The virgin killer vs the Chad survivor.
---
*happy oinkys*
---
Maybe but he still has tier 3. Unless hes playing hag I dont remember seeing noed on the shrine. Its been more than 3 months since it was up there so they play enough to not have a tiny BP number.
---
Situational empathy is hard, I guess. Still not cash money on you but it seems like you aren‚Äôt about that action.
---
They can hear the phasing noise as long as they're not in the Spirit's TR when she starts. I believe they can also hear the whoosh if they leave the TR and she's still moving towards them.
---
This is all in the scenario that the Survs have, let's say suboptimal gamesense and decision making, to be generous.
---
In chess we have an idea that you shouldn't play riskier or easier moves against weaker opponents if that move is worse, because if they fall for it, yeah congratz, but if you know the best move there's no reason not to just play that. Just play the best move and it'll serve you regardless of the skill level of your opponent, and save you the case where the weak opponent actually finds the best response and now you're screwed.
---
Yeah I think it should be more than a crap shoot but also I think both NEED to have a chance to win
---
what I love doing against tbaggers is baiting them into thinking I'm letting them have a freebie then just close it Infront of thier eyes
---
There really not even worth it I would rather get some dbd funko pops instead.
---
Same for Freddy. Works every time.
---
I am that Spirit. It‚Äôs extremely effective
---
I made this meme 6 months ago.
---
i love to play as both but absolutely fucking hate to play against both.
---
Honestly I think overcharge is a similarly great perk for Freddy, survivors will try and wake themselves up at the cost of significant generator progression.
---
Is it useful? Not really
---
Is it annoying? Fuck yes
---
Does it limit survivor options? In some ways 
---
I enjoy the build
---
Literally unplayable.
---
Gotta go fast
---
What do you mean brother, teabagging doesn‚Äôt ruin a killers game it‚Äôs just BM, face camping is game breaking, and just generally not playing the game right wether you like it or not. If you face camping you aren‚Äôt going for 4 kills like your suppose to
---
Time to get serious lol.
---
It‚Äôs useful to me because 
---
1. I‚Äôm usually the first one to the end gates and opens them
---
2. It tells other survivors what gate is being opened so they can make your way over there.
---
3. Sometimes time is everything, opening a gate two seconds faster has helped me and over survivors more than once in a match
---
It‚Äôs useful because it usually tells your team this gate is being opened, get over here. I use which is Adrenaline, Self Care, and Lithe, I do switch out other perks and use Wake Up!, because I like helping my team know where they need to be when the gates are powered.
---
So basically you've never played or read his ability...
---
What you did is similar to me saying stuff like 
---
"Nurse isn't even your average m1 killer, Totally jukeable with her slow power charge, and you can hear her coming with that huge terror radius. Basically the spirit can do what she does better but she doesn't walk slower than survivors.
---
Freddy on the other hand can sneak up to people and mind game them to get an easy hit every time, and then he can casually follow them to down them at his own leisure and break the gens in the mean time.
---
I mean her powr is basically her having to beg the entity to keep up with survivors
---
It depends on what you mean by powerful. Some people play to pip and others play to kill. Legion always sacrificed killing power for potential upside in Chaser &amp; Malicious emblems if Survs aren't separated constantly.
---
But then it‚Äôs weird because i‚Äôm maybe less than 24m away when surveillance proccs and they can‚Äôt see or hear me phasing but after 2 seconds they are off the gen
---
did freedy just 1 shot Mr.X
---
Prob 90% of all my playtime is Freddy, but better than a good Nurse, no, not at all
---
Well thats your opinion and I respect it. Mine is that billy is too good for how easy he is to learn and to master compared to others, I find that annoying
---
I can see Battle Hardened being such a meme perk. I can just imagine the flashlight squads flashlight blinding the killer after letting one guy go down, and instakilling him. "GG EZ GIT GUD SCRUB. SUCH A BAD KILLER YOU GOT KILLED, EZ PZ EZ PEZ GET REKT KID"
---
Determined To Kill will likely turn into a moonwalker perk.
---
By the end of the matches everyone has a brown nose
---
Thanks for hiding the names! Still funny seeing this the second time
---
You seem to have no understanding of the term "nice" at all.
---
Oh fuck yeah I agree with that, I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve been downed by a baby billy just because they had insta saw
---
I‚Äôd love to know what the mods think when it comes to over saturation of content.
---
Shit you right about the moonwalking. I mainly put the timer on the ‚ÄòMori‚Äô perk so as to make the bullying less easy.
---
Alert is trash?
---
Oh, yeah, I don't know why I though AITH worked for items also. My bad.
---
I would love to do that, but I'm on PS4. Also I don't know anybody that plays DBD (always played solo) and given the nature of my schedule it's difficult for me to coordinate with other PS4 users, so I'm just doing it in public matches, running Plunderers and AITH and trying not to depip.
---
Azarov's Resting Place should be easy to search, since it has 3 separate areas and is a small map.
---
ok boomer
---
Hag, because you cant teleport while doing the animation. I main hag and I miss a lot of teleport hits because of that, so Im running stbfl now with MaA, nurses and ruin.
---
Hey now... What's all this hate on my girl, The Plague?
---
I thought we liked the puke. What is this mutiny?
---
Yeah I wasn't actually angry or anything, more shocked haha
---
Billies that run this combo aren't confident in their chainsaw game.
---
I'd argue the best one for this, although it's less of a hiding thing and more of a "oh fuck here he comes" thing, is play as Meg with the red jacket and crouch next to one of those red barrels that are on some maps. Not at all a permanent solution, but I've found that killers tend not to notice in their peripherals when they walk past.
---
1. Crows need to be buffed so they appear faster for exactly this reason
---
2. OH MY GOD I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT HOW HARD IT MUST BE TO STRUGGLE ON CONTROLLER
---
Well wait until you get out of Rank 15...then you‚Äòll see it won‚Äôt work 80% of the time
---
Is it gonna work after the rework? Probably not.
---
Insidious is in the majority of my freddy builds. I think it's great, and I mention it a lot too, but no one cares to believe me and just laugh. This guy probably went through the same thing and out of habit feels he'll get flak for stating his opinion.
---
Well, according to the rules it's prohibited, but I honestly don't see nearly enough action taken from the moderoos.  
---
The sub is filled to the brim with minimal effort memes, as well as plain screenshots of t-posing survivors, DC's and "impossible rituals," and I'm not seeing a whole lot of work put into filtering all of it out.
---
You can only take it a few times tho. Red paint still has a terror radius tho.
---
That‚Äôs what I meant. The mods must not think this is over saturated at this point. 
---
I‚Äôve seen one mod ever take something down. Definitely need better ones here.
---
After 2 seconds your terror radius shrinks to 0, the shrinkage is gradual. I believe that's there to give the illusion of you leaving and not make insidious obvious.
---
Me as Killer: Walks through corn
---
Game: ‚ÄúSurvivor Found‚Äù
---
Me: Yeeaah... not really
---
I don't have time for empathy, my job is to kill not to feel sorry for someone being in any sort of shitty situation.
---
If BBQ doesn‚Äôt find anyone the killer feels good about the camp.
---
Facts
---
Removed the following killer : the nightmare.
---
Added the following killers : ghostface, the nightmare.
---
Unless they assume that you assume that they'd assume it's devour and still don't cleanse it.
---
~~Buff.~~
---
Rework.
---
What did you just bring upon this haunted ground**
---
For as much as I like panda and coconut, they both came off really whiney in their videos on this topic, each going with the opposite opinion.
---
I wish but no. I brought a medkit, the basement chest had a medkit and there was randomly floating medkit on the stairs?? So I grab em all and made my nest. Piggy approved after I surrounded her with Medkits x)
---
I cleansed a Hex totem knowing it was Haunted Ground since the Spirit was using her two other perks, so I assumed they were trying to get the adept achievement - they had NOED too though. At least I was the only person who got knocked down and hooked because of it.
---
Haha, is there a link to the full thing?
---
Thank you to the 2 people who gave me gold for this! You rock!

This happened like what? 1 out of 100 games. Meanwhile if a killer so much as moves, survivors shit there pants and scream ‚Äúcamper, tunneled! Not fun to play against! You ruined my gaming experience!! Reeeeeee!!‚Äù
---
You probably smell like beef
---
It is almost impossible to escape as last survivor and the hatch is closed though, especially with how dogshit the exit gate spawns are.
---
Earlier today I was playing as pig and found the hatch hidden in the corner of the map and I crouched down waiting for the last survivor. I closed it right when they went to jump. You can close directly from crouched position.. lmao.
---
Billy and Nurse... the reason, why other killers have a very hard time to shine.
---
If you compare Billy to killers like Wraith or Myers, why would people pick Wraith or Myers over him? 
---
I would love to see a nerf on Billy and Nurse, high rank is either one of them or someone who's super good on 1 certain killer.
---
trash
---
No i pretend to leave the gen go a little away with distressing. The light turns yellow, i phase back even though they shouldn‚Äôt see or hear me behind a t-wall and then they‚Äôre gone before 2 seconds of starting the gen again.
---
I usually start going crazy mid chase as a survivor, I start shoving my head in the monitor like "oh fuck he's so close" and then start shaking when the killer gets a near miss
---
No offence but I hope his rework is more interesting than this, insta downs are becoming too common and ghost face is gonna be able to so I doubt it.
---
You don't seem to understand the term "Serial Killer" and "Objective of the game."
---
I think I might really hate hillbilly
---
Nah.
---
Only your first point made sense lol. Yes, he has a potential for 4k if people fuck up, yes rank 1 is not everything, but eventually you will have to deal with that toxic shit and finally, it's not a band wagon, it's simply an opinion of majority. As I said, Freddy is my favorite killer, but many people see problems with him and he could be way more fun. Streamers I watched made proper legit points why he needs a rework. There is a reason why he's considered one of the worst killers and it's certainly not the fact that only few "couldn't bother learning a character".
---
Monitor and abuse combined with red paint brush will also give you zero terror out of chase. It is definitely like scratch mirror Myers. And a lot of people book it to a gen to wake up, giving you plenty of chances to gen grab.
---
god i wish that was me, nice art!
---
What rank are you? They might have played long enough to know about certain add-ons and are testing to see if you come right back to the gen.
---
Look we get it, you get your ass handed to you a lot by good Hillbillies. It's nothing to be ashamed of
---
Yep, agreed, Freddy is just S tier in fun, lol.
---
Yeah instadowns killers are not really hyping me anymore. I do hope that it is more interesting but this ‚Äúrework‚Äù was just to make him stronger. Because (no offense freddy mains) freddy is trash right now (in my opinion at least)
---
It‚Äôs still game breaking for that one survivor, and if it‚Äôs not a good strategy why are you defending and almost encouraging people to do it lmao. There‚Äôs no excuses for face camping unless you‚Äôre rank 20. You can legitimately get a kill as easy if you don‚Äôt stand in one spot the whole match. The entire idea of face camping is toxic, Boring, and using game mechanics to an unfair advantage against one survivor.
---
When ever I get facecamped, it‚Äôs always like ‚Äúwell. I guess I‚Äôll just spam X for 10 years while you guys get to escape, have fun‚Äù but the problem is yes you directly ruin that 1 survivors game, but in reality you ruin EVERYONES game because you literally aren‚Äôt chasing after the others which makes it SOO boring. Fuck you and your defense, you shouldn‚Äôt defend face camping, it‚Äôs a serious bother and something that should be looked into.
---
Thanks for trying to defend me, but this guys never gonna accept that he‚Äôs wrong haha
---
Eh
---
No lol. Trapper was the only viable killer in the game for a long time, because he could shut down the actual infinite loops.
---
From my experience, Dwights are either completely new to the game and know nothing, or really toxic with rarely anything in between. They both suck regardless of what role I'm playing
---
It only works if they aren‚Äôt sprinting, it‚Äôs still easy to follow their scratch marks.
---
I read scrubbles lines in herberts voice
---
sucks that you haven't gotten monitor and abuse on myers I love being spooky
---
I haven‚Äôt been killed by the Entity yet, but it would be nice to have the exit gates spawn further away from each other for when I‚Äôm the only person left. It sucks when they‚Äôre on the same wall and the killer can just stand in the middle to stop them from being opened.
---
That's a 1000 IQ play.
---
The killer can't find you if you disconnect
---
I remember I got caught in a game once where the pallets were invisible for me (go figure). And the first 3 pallet drops scared the shit out of me because I had no idea what I got stunned with for half a second
---
I agree with many of your points, but would like to point out that sole survivor is godly when properly utilized. When mixed with object of obsession it is an incredibly high risk, but greatly rewarding combo.
---
SONO CHI NO SADAME
---
You‚Äôre taking that role immersion a bit heavy, but hey whatever floats your boat.
---
A really good combo is the typical meta chase build: enduring, spirit fury, brutal strength, and bamboozle. With this, you vault windows and break pallets super fast, and with your choice of when they go down in one hit, unlike with perks or add-ons, you can choose when to pop EW3 at full Spirit Fury and gain a sweet advantage. People always recommend Monitor and Abuse, but Monitor does not help a whole bunch in the chase. Now, if you want to branch out, Myers' own perk is a good choice, PWYF, as a lot of builds lock him at slower speeds (Vanity Mirror, Tombstone) or at a permanently slower speed (Scratched Mirror), so PWYF is a great choice there. Another one of his perks, STBFL, is also a great choice. Dying Light is a meme and not that good anymore. BBQ is great if you run M&amp;A as you can pop out of nowhere and startle people as you approach their exact location. I would recommend removing dying light for spirit fury in your current build.
---
She is pretty bad ass and always makes me jump at least once when I go against her
---
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
I think to buff wake up, survivors shouldn't see the exit gate signs once the last generator is done/hatch is closed and make that a feature of wake up.
---
"run worse perks because I called you bad"
---
Just like in your real life, nobody fucking cares.
---
i feel like its easier to have fun as killer. if im about to down a survivor on dead hook and they squat and point or shake their head, i‚Äôll usually go off and find someone else, especially if i already got a bbq stack from them. this is fun with pig in particular.
---
it's honestly fun and I love the hopeless feeling when your getting chased and there's like 30 seconds on the clock
---
Lol
---
Poor generic skillbilly, thinks tier whoring makes him skilled. If the game held your hand any more a bot would be playing for you.
---
Scratch mirror Myers is super fun
---
The cut at the end is perfect &lt;3

I want them to do a legacy reward thats a lot harder to obtain, They  ruined Legacys value with lack of care of the legacy hackers and the fact that most legacy players lost it. 
---
It would be awesome if after devotion 5 you could chose a single Legacy cosmetic for a single character for every Devotion lvl you get
---
Idk. Its good but bad.
---
As a survivor, I hate it.
---
Makes people way more selfish in a team based game when one is hooked during the Endgame.
---
you need to bring pig up the list
---
Glad I'm not the only one. I always feel so stupid every time.
---
Well, say what you want about that survivor but you can't call them a liar lol
---
Not that ive found
---
@
---
I‚Äôve never played a game with a battle pass before, but I have such mixed feelings on DBD getting one specifically. I can see the pros and cons for each side, but my biggest concern is something like ‚Äúbuy the *premiere* battle pass and you can get 2x BP!!‚Äù being sold. Admittedly there has been nothing so far to suggest this (to the best of my knowledge), however I think it‚Äôs the biggest point of concern for me.
---
Survivor then proceeds to disconnect
---
This is the same persons that some months ago said "tier list are pointless because every killer has a different hunting style so you can not compare them". Like, lol
---
Plague is awesome though lol. Legion is lame.
---
Bitch is too outplayed, especially when referring to Freddy. So why not spice it up with a McBitch?

---
It has never once caused me panic. 
---
its either "Oh he exit gates are right there and the killer is camping
---
or "wow the random just opened the gate across the map and left when our friend is on the hook, fucking amazing"
---
or "Im the last person alive and the killer found me with the hatch closed, Now he is just bloodlusting me at this loop and there is nothing i can do against it."
---
or "Great i have to wait 2+ mins of just sitting here while the killer jerks himself off for getting a single kill so he can nut as soon as the entity kills me"
---
Where? I don't see it anywhere
---
Yeah that‚Äôs gotta suck! I have been playing more killer than survivor since the update, and as killer it is very stressful to monitor both exit gates when they aren‚Äôt close to each other. Still killer‚Äôs favor typically, but I‚Äôve had them on the opposite ends of the map from each other and it absolutely gave the survivor plenty of time between checks.
---
I‚Äôd be very happy if they set minimum *and* maximum bounds on the distance between gates.
---
You play survivor only and it shows.
---
I can see this exact meme format with those words :)
---
As a survivor, end game collapse = get as much boldness as you can before you're inevitably killed.
---
Huntress is very satisfying.
---
I find I only ever face this right as a take an escape cake... every... single... time
---
SWF: You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!
---
Same I'm loving it, although I'm not loving games lasting a couple minutes longer because the killer downed you and is waiting for the end game kill, wish there was a suicide button xD
---
Same! 1,000+ hours, rank 1 killer / survivor, willing to play killer. I wonder what people they wanted :/
---
Op is rubbing salt in his eyes
---
Insidious is weak, but far from trash. It's just situational, and has a bad Rep for being used to camp. 
---
It's built around the game having a scare factor, and you don't get to be part of the conversation about scare tactics if you don't get scared anymore.
---
I just wanna call people Bitch. That's it. All I care about.
---
‚òùÔ∏èthis
---
My favorite build is Jumpscare Myers (Version 2)
---
Hex: Ruin, BBQ&amp;C, Monitor and Abuse, Nurse‚Äôs Calling
---
With dead rabbit and J. Myers Memorial add-ons 
---
I learned this build from another user on this sub a few months ago when I was looking for a jumpscare build. Ever since then this has been my go to build. It‚Äôs so much fun.
---
yea because why else would you be posting this
---
If I didn't know any of the names for the killers, I would have guessed that Clown is "The Chuckling Killer"
---
This.
---
Remind me again what does BM stand for?
---
Nope I would just rather play a killer with an interesting power, standing in place holding a button down to fill a bar is not fun at all.
---
Probably fresh-ish players instead of people who know every little exploit/balancing issue.
---
It is a vanilla gameplay experiment after all, but I'd say it's a bit invalid if you completely disregard players at higher ranks.
---
Im joining rn
---
Honestly, that sounds neat for like 5 minutes till you'd rather just click with your mouse to open up menus without needing to wait to get there.
---
Haha
---
While I haven‚Äôt played as or against Freddy that often (I play on console) I will say the first time I heard that lullaby so suddenly, I pissed myself.
---
I've been using Insidious on him since I bought him and unlocked it. Definitely a crutch but very handy, especially due to his vision being darkened and foggy.
---
I've done Adept Laurie recently and yes: when combined with Object it's incredibly strong. However I honestly contribute that strength more to Object than Sole Survivor. The main problem with the perk is that it encourages poor, selfish play for very little tangible reward. If the perk had more of an immediate use it would be far better but as it stands currently it basically reads "let your teammates die in order to use your perk and get the hatch for free."
---
I mean, I mostly play survivor, and if you don't think playing survivor is brain dead easy I don't have much else to say to you lol. You can play with literally no perks and basically be just as strong as a survivor running most of the perks in the game. It's not the same for killer
---
They shouldn't have changed it except for removing it when a survivor is opening a gate in endgame collapse.
---
Ah
---
100% me as well, except I play killer. This is why I wish this game had a casual/for fun mode, and a serious ranked mode.
---
Strikes a Pose like a JoJo I see, Micheal has good taste
---
Best thing you can do when more than 2 survivors escape is clicked the arrow next to the chat box immediately after the game is over and hide the chat
---
If you win just write gg
---
I think it's more referencing that his default mask looks like it's smiling/laughing. This nickname was made long before The Clown was probably thought up
---
oh sorry for repost will delete
---
Freddy is actually really fun imo. Fun is subjective but pig and Freddy would be way higher if it were my list.
---
The entire point of the end game collapse was to fix two things:
---
1. Hatch standoffs.
---
2. Survivors refusing to leave matches.
---
They aren't going to change it back to hatch standoffs.
---
I don't I simply making the point that it's the role you are meant to follow. What kind of serial killer lets his victims escape? because he's nice?
---
I personally agree, she is the coolest and best designed. BUT, that doesn't mean that super cool complex killers are always good. Legion has a cool complex power on paper, then its absolute garbage. Huntress, has one of the most basic powers, yeet a thing. It's my personal favorite, has insane skill ceiling, and is very rewarding to use. While having some very cool complex killers are good, its refreshing to have something simple every once and a while, though I would love for some more variety, instead of another insadown stealth killer. Plague added quite a fun, complex power that added new mechanics, that gave you the choice of being instadown and easy to track, or to make plague be insanely powerful. She is another great killer imo, even if she isn't the most powerful, unlike spirit who I would argue is better than Billy in certain situations.
---
Deathgarden is being revamped and the new version of DG comes out May 30th. It‚Äôll probably be just as good as DBD.
---
Nurse can get 4k if people mess up too. Nothing special with her here. Opinions aren't immune to bandwagonism. Freddy IS fun, your complaint has been that he's bad. Which streamer was it? I'm genuinely curious, the streamers I've seen have no clue how to play him.
---
What were those legit points of why he needs a rework? (Also genuinely curious)
---
Says the person literally going ‚ÄúReeeeeee!!!‚Äù Right now.
---
Why is huntress that low? She is so fun and satisfying when you can consistently get those cross map snipes
---
Yes because that‚Äôs the only counter to bbq
---
I prefer to watch killer but i can also watch survivor if its not someone 360ing rank 20 killers.
---
There‚Äôs no skill required basically. There‚Äôs no outsmarting, no different play styles. This makes him good for beginners or survivor mains that want to try switching. But anyone who plays killer often will get pretty quickly. 
---
Because you can‚Äôt keep the chainsaw ready there‚Äôs only one way to play him; you get close then m2 and hope they don‚Äôt get to a window first.
---
Well, last year was a terrible anniversary with nothing... iirc they didn't even mentioned their second anniversary.
---
It was mad boring:
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/2_Year_Anniversary
---
* Auric Cells Raffle
---
* Cosplay Artwork Contest
---
* Video Contest
---
* The Escape Tournament ---&gt; was a huge shit show with hackers and BS ruling change last second.
---
* Huntress Mask Sweepstake
---
* Blood Hunt
---
Not true.  You still get DSed if you go after the only survivor in front of you if they just happen to be the injured one.
---
But he said not to
---
I'm not suggesting the return of hatch stand offs, and while I do believe its reasonable to have punishment for the 2nd survivor, the current state of the hatch feels clunky and weird though
---
Or people that play console where nurse is impossible to play well lol
---
Prestiging your survivor and killer do the same thing. resets your progress on the character and gives you a bloody piece of clothing. it doesnt increase the chances of getting ultra rare addons and items.
---
I guess so, really weird
---
As a Freddy main, I reject this. This is t a Freddy compliment, this is a legion diss.
---
Mmk
---
UM excuse me, sweaty. That is THE Wavesplitter.
---
When you have a toolbox as well as resilience though, it is sexy times.
---
If your character has shitty perks available, needs more items/add-ons, or you enjoy the looks of prestige outfits, go for it. It's been said that prestige makes rarer items appear more often but I saw a Reddit thread that showed the effect was non-existent, or so minimal that it might as well be non-existent.
---
Yeah they seem to be on a nerfing streak.
---
You should've gotten the 2500. I believe there may be a problem if it's the last living survivor who DCed, though.
---
It accomplishes what it set out to do 100%.
---
People are getting to hung on up on whether it's "fair" for the last survivor in a 1v1 scenario. That ultimately doesn't matter. Games will now end within a timely manner. No more hatch stand offs. No more corner crawling survivors in a thick mist swamp. No more forcing the killer to swat survivors out of an exit gate. 
---
I'll gladly take all of the above if it means some people get made they get have to wait, at most, 4 minutes for a game to end.
---
Fucking survivor mains amirite
---
I agree gates close to each other are too easy for the killer and hard for survivor but the gates on opposite sides are almost impossible for killer and easy for the survivor
---
Bad manners. It's a catch all term for deliberately provocative toxic behavior
---
I feel like you were just as bored making this as we were reading it.

---
Mostly survivor because that's all Peach plays. Occasionally Pat plays killer when Paige has to go do something/is dying but it's mostly her playing survivor. I also don't really enjoy watching any other streamer so survivor it is.
---
I know that most of you want exclusives. Don't be sad. Players with real exclusives are tunneled, farmed and facecamped. Try ask somebody who own legacy, why he doesn't use it. 
---
Players are jealous and they do everything to ruin your game experience if you have rare cosmetics.
---
Seriously, Rule Set No. 2 is kinda of a joke for being an ultra rare. There are WAY better addons to choose from.
---
I believe it provides more immersion or something.
---
Haven't even played against a spirit yet, only been playing for a couple of weeks at most... Sounds even worse haha
---
If you stream killer lmk your twitch handle :D hard to find killer streamers sometimes
---
But how will you know i am the king of reddit
---
Yeah, usually I walk around corners right into him and then I can't escape because I can't tell if I'm getting further away from him and am safe or not.
---
If I smashed the survivor team I will generally let the last escape, but only if it is a Dwight
---

Terminator isn‚Äôt a horror movie though, it‚Äôs an action movie. He wouldn‚Äôt fit Dead by Daylights aesthetic at all. He‚Äôs too futuristic and doesn‚Äôt have the look of a Dead by Daylight killer.

---
Screenshots of each data point. One would have to be one hell of a troll to go through the trouble of faking dozens of screenshots for no good reason.
---

---
Yes, as several people are doing already from my previous iteration of this help appeal, and did for the bloodweb experiment too.
---
Nea killer jokes are just not even remotely funny anymore.
---
That's what I'd advice to do if they do an addon rework.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of killers in this game, you don‚Äôt realise how many sometimes.
---
Zombie specifies that he doesn‚Äôt mind not having credit for his work but I think it‚Äôs a bit bad that OP put his own watermark on there to take credit for himself

You can literally pull up any screenshot from a yt video lol

---
I'm a rebel, I use No Mither and Tenacity, do you think I fear?

That's good to know, I have a hard time learning what characters can do if I don't play them myself, so Myers is gonna take me a minute to learn.
---
Roughly 12% of the US is black. 17.6% of DBD characters are black. How is that not diverse? Are you just using the word diverse to try and justify more black characters?
---
Look if you want more black people in game that's fine, I want the old Meg too. But diverse means *everyone* has variety, not just only black people.
---
Yes, you should. If your computer is having trouble, take some time to figure out what's going on and try to fix it. If it's a known problem with your computer and it keeps happening, you should try to resolve it before playing a game where four other people's fun relies on your stable connection.
---
The worst part about this is that Zubat is one of the few Billies at high ranks that I've faced that are extremely good at Billy that it's hard to mind game them that him running this is overkill. Like, he's one of the 2 Billy main Streamers that I know that make Billy look effortless that they're pretty much look like they're playing on auto pilot.
---
"clearly can't use those top tier killers" Wrongo. lmfao They're just boring as everloving fuck. Anyone that plays the Nurse is flat-out gross. She doesn't even play DBD. Her power is to ignore the mechanics of the game. And it does not take a lot to learn her at all. Even a fuckhole like you could, I'm sure.
---
You know, having to just hit the survivor ONE extra time is the same logic that applies to old DS. Hey tell me, do you think old DS was fine too?
---
I can use this website for whatever I want, including ranting my own opinion without being open to a dumbass's like yours. And there's absolutely nothing you can do about it.
---
I really dont see the issue with it, especially if its just cosmetics. If you dont want it dont buy it
---
There was never a specific rule on horror movies, just that they are called ‚Äúkillers‚Äù. Just in the first movie alone he racks up more kills than most other licensed killers get.
---
Yeah not like she can even do it well
---
"makes the game a little harder" Survivor main spotted, let's observe to see its next course of action.
---
You wanna say I'm a toxic scumbag but you're talking about fucking animals because I called someone a moron. Okay. lmfao
---
sorry about that! I thought it was optional. I'll use it going forward
---
this is terrible advice... Often times counter intuitive strategies are the best, like literally walking backwards, or staring into a fucking wall, yet they are common practices at the higher ranks.   
---
I will also say I personally do not think tunneling is ever a good idea. Getting someone out of the game is usually the result of a desperate attempt to land a single kill, ruining the fun for someone while you have already lost. Other times, it is a strategy meant to eliminate one of the survivors, bringing them to an instant 3/4th efficiency, however, as survivors do their most efficient work while each doing single generators, and being able to do this as you are not contesting any of them, which would force them to condense, slowing down their efficiency (2 people working on one gen is not twice as fast, it is closer to 1.75x speed). This means that by tunneling, you are guaranteeing that in the time you could have hooked two people and allow 1-2 gens be completed, you have only hooked 1, and have allowed 3 gens to be completed. At this point, you could camp one of the remaining ones, guaranteeing the last two a gen each, which would mean that at best you average two kills per game, while never actually playing a game... So you would be consistently deranking, while never actually playing. Seems like a waste of time and money to me...

&gt; When performing a fast vault or leaving a Locker in a sprint, you leave no Scratch Marks for **3 seconds**.

That or Lightweight

he actually looks like the virgin from "Virgin vs Chad"

Well he looks like a trapper cosmetic and I don‚Äôt remember any sort of power he would have, but a wendigo on the other hand THAT would be awesome

I said *some scenarios.* I don't condone tunneling at all, and I hardly ever do it unless I see it as necessary. Most of the time, tunneling will cause you to lose the game, as you have said. But lets say...I don't know, you're playing as Myers on cowshed vs a good team of survivors and 3 gens have popped after you only got a handful of hooks (which is entirely plausible because you're playing as Myers on cowshed). You have a survivor in struggle and you have your tier 2 at 99. You see someone going for the save so you tier 3, slug the unhooker, and then immediately go after the unhook to kill them. 
---
In that situation, if a killer wants to regain control of the game, then tunneling that unhook and killing them is the *best thing to do.* Of course, this isn't always the case, which again, why I said in some scenarios. Most of the time, its much more efficient to hook then immediately look for someone else.
---
It is optional of course, because during regular gameplay it sacrifices a  perk slot that could be helping the player survive. But in your case it looks like you're in KYF with your wife, so there is no logical reason not to use it. Sorry for not clarifying this before.
---
Did you get the extensive comment with tips for a more efficient KYF? I edited the post and added your name there after it was posted, I'm not sure this generated a notification for you!
---
This is awesome! Great skin choice for Billy.
---
True that except with Adrenaline. The game needs to get to endgame for the perk to even be useful.
---
I‚Äôm not talking about fucking animals, I‚Äôm talking about your main form of enjoyment when your not bitching on reddit about a video game ‚Äúlmfao‚Äù. And you‚Äôre completely wrong on the survivor main only you dumbass. If you knew anything about this game or the community as a whole you would know that most play both sides, the arrogant toxic scumbags like you only play one and have a linear view. But to clarify in case you don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm saying since your IQ level is at an all time low. I play killer a lot I‚Äôm a clown main you stupid fuck. Purple rank clown main, so try again kid.
---
Sorry Meg, but Feng is my waifu.
---
Nurse 
---
Spirit 
---
Billy
---
Then everyone else
---
Just add and take away 8 from the base terror radius (32m). ;)
---
Bootleg companies be like: \^
---
I dont think adrenaline is OP I actually think it's a great situational perk like new DS. I'm just making a point that what he said was silly.
---
PS4 
---
Menu
---
The Rituals missons dont seem to reload 3 each day. Ill do all 3 on one day. Then come back the next. And none will be reloaded.
---
Ill eventually play a couple sessions, then only 1 ritual will load.
---
A Wendigo for sure would be top tier. Really love those folk lore creatures
---
I love it when I manage to be chased for a while. Even when I get caught in the end, I feel like I did a good job when my team has done like 2 gens in the meantime.   
---
Too bad I usually don't last more than 20 seconds lol
---
There's no way it's that bc it's happening mid chase
---
They don‚Äôt.  Whoever finds the hatch first gets the advantage, the difference being the survivor just gets to straight-up leave and the killer has to patrol before securing a kill.
---
Yup gold chest are coming next! Find one hidden in the map with either a Bush, skeleton key, or ranger medkit, shield potion, next chapter Killer leak! 
---
Oh wait we already have them and always get a brown medkit or brown flashlight or brown toolbox and it takes forever to search thru it and doesn‚Äôt make a cool noise when Near it.
---
the idea is that we don't want to see BEhavior treating games as a service. They have done a great job allowing us to purchase licensed dlc as we see fit, without gatekeeping powerful perks and such behind paywalls. If they create a battlepass then that could be the first of many business decisions that make them like the many other very shitty companies ruining the gaming industry
---
lovely
---
It's such a good match when that happens, as a survivor you can't even be mad. It's like why yes Mikey, it would be my honor to have my ass handed to me on a silver platter.  
---
Also someone please grab my inhaler cause all these fucking jump scares got me wheezing.
---
His name is ProGame.
---
You gotta pay fort the estate somehow
---
I'm a killer main but I can't help but concede that it feels *good* to pop a gen in half a minute with 3 people on gen and Prove Thyself. I'm a monster on so many levels...
---
OH HEY THAT ME
---
Just give us a perk like pharmacy for flashlights tbh.
---
Do they disappear when a gen is done?
---
They could be running poised aswell
---
He's wrong. With leader alone the bonus is 25%.
---
I have no idea how he got his answer but I don't think he did the math right.
---
I've never thought about using fred like that. I can see why that would be a funny loadout
---
I'm in the same boat. there are dozens of us!
---
I got leg cramps once by forcing them when lunging lol
---
Thats not tunneling. If you down the unhook, then confirm some damage on the other thats just not being an idiot. You are applying pressure to other survivors while punishing them for an unsafe save. Tunneling occurs when you actively ignore other, easier, hits in the name of following one person, even if they are not injured
---
then you are letting toxic survivors get under your skin. They call anything toxic. It takes serious effort to be considered a fair killer, and you really can't get there if you are trying to rank up. But yea thats the general def of it. The thing you described isn't tunneling tho. What are you gonna do as a killer, let them both just get away? Thad be fucking stupid
---
I wonder if they downvoted you cuz they didn't get the sarcasm or if people are dumb enough to call stealth toxic, lol.
---
Yeah he's saying basically the same thing as you. The smaller weapons from Freddy and Legion look shorter but really have the same hitbox as something as large as the Trappers machete.
---
But technically nurse is already dead, so how would you kill something already dead?
---
Hag's is S-Tier from a survivor's perspective. The way she hops into the locker for the pull is very animalistic &amp; interesting.
---
It's a bit too late for that now friend.
---
128 kbps ruined the soundtracks :(
---
I was thinking the same about you. Games where survivors are left to do gens and nothing else while killers just face camp are boring games.
---
Yea I'm on the dbd subreddit, what of it?
---
How were u able to chat before the game started
---
Its because survivor is way easier.
---
Me, obviously.
---
&gt;Basically, every time I want to be nice in this game, the community makes me think twice about it.
---
I can definitely relate. 
---
The other day I was trying to give a survivor hatch because all 3 of his teammates DCed. 
---
So I downed him, took him to hatch, and he DCed instead of jumping through. He then calls me an "idiot fucking killer" because he was trying to get his chest searching achievement and he didn't care about hatch. 
---
That was about a week ago and I haven't given anyone hatch since.
---
I wanna know and you got two different answer as replies.. darn.
---
While that's true, a good Nurse will catch up to them fast anyway, while Wraith/Trapper/Freddy etc have to run up to them, hoping they don't find another spot to loop.
---
I got enough boyfriend's memos thank you very much. I want more J Myers memorials or at least the flower.
---
You find the game boring, so why are you here? I never understand people going out of their way to put themselves into a situation they dislike, then they complain about it.
---
That's what I'm saying man. The fact of the matter is that some (if not alot) survivors consider that tunneling, which is what I was talking about in my original post.
---
I've got an odd error where after first launching the game, if I queue as survivor I will go to an infinite loading screen (pre reaching a lobby). I have to close the application and relaunch it and it will normally work after that.
---
The issue does not occur if I queue as a Killer, it reaches the lobby as normal in that case.
---
Has anyone else experienced this?
---
[Here's a higher res picture of it Eirri's Twitter](https://twitter.com/EIRRI/status/1131907241336950784)
---
I just love this art so much! Artist did an AMAZING JOB!!
---
Your pretty boring if you are complaining about this lol
---
&gt;You find the game boring, so why are you here?
---
I only called face camping games boring I didn't call dead by daylight boring. Its very simple, don't put words in my mouth.
---
Survivors : \*do something\*
---
Killers : ***TOXIC!!***
---
Luckily nobody gives a shit about what you think about Billies or the perks you use. 
---
It's obvious you have a made up idea of how Billy should be played but you have no actual clue how Billy needs to be played.
---
This art style is so similar to the Arkham Asylum character bios and I love it.
---
But there will be no final Killer
---
Yeah ghost saws are absolutely infuriating.
---
"You asked for a 4k, but I only gave you one!"
---
Your literal words are "boring game, boring life". That's your words. If you meant face camping and don't want any confusion, then put some effort into a full sentence.
---
It would be cool if the entity wasn‚Äôt like a normal killer and had a perspective of looking down at the map and could control things like a board game
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It's not a shit combo, you just need to be a better survivor. Drop pallets early and don't go for stuns like a dumb ass if you know he's got it.
---
This usually happens when a survivor pulls the plug to DC, and it doesn't register immediately. Did they eventually drop from the match?
---
I feel ya there haha, I just feel like a lot of survivor streamers are toxic:P
---
Behavior also made a Drake and Josh game. You know what that means...?
---
Oh
---
thats mostly because mistakes you make as a Survivor arent as punishing as when you make a mistake as a Killer.
---
Thats probably why most People prefer to play survivor
---
No they plated the whole thing out and escaped :)
---
Screaming while you lunge also gives you more reach
---
&gt;Your literal words are "boring game, boring life"
---
On a post about bubbas face camping and survivors just doing gens. Yup my comment is about the posts topic, not Dead by Daylight as a whole.
---
Keep being ass pained over nothing though lol
---
Man was as salty as a pretzel for no reason other than we wanted to SURVIVE.
---
No one played toxic (except him)
---
And played a basement bubba build with a mori and noed.
---
But guys remember, flashlight = mori
---
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never a good reason for a Killer to disconnect.‚Äù
---
[sees this shit]
---
*DONG*
---
oh no, I'm a killer main and there are plenty of things that are toxic, but this is not one of them
---
You can't play him like a generic M1 killer, which (I think) is why most people say hes bad. Because they play him like anybody else. This rework will fuck him in the ass.
---
I've done that in IDV
---
It may not be, but it is still effective if you‚Äôre being mindful of when you need to be stealthy and when you need to be more aggressive. Stealth gets such a bad rep because many people mindless hide without doing anything to progress the match.
---
She wasn‚Äôt sandbagging. She was BMing, it just messed her teammate
---
Cause they want an easy win if it gets to that, I‚Äôd guess.
---
Don‚Äôt try and hold Freddy back he needs to spread his wings and fly
---
I hate that the fountain also heals survivors, makes no sense
---
The Hag is drawn heavily from wendigo lore. She was half eaten and ate her captives becoming a cannibal. She just also happens to be a witch
---
Clearly. I thought that implication was there from the beginning, but apparently not.
---
Where are you coming from....?  Just please stop this rework is so needed.  I want to hear why he shouldn‚Äôt get this rework.  BVHR may not be the best developers but youre acting like they aren‚Äôt trying their best to make their game better.
---
Look dude it's nothing personal. I have my opinion and you have yours, which I do respect. Let's stop the childish insults and put it down to a bad judgement on both sides. There's enough toxicity in the game without us having it on reddit. Good luck in the fog.
---
He‚Äôs been in his f tier cacoon for too long..
---
This whole thing started because you kept talking about how DBD wasn't diverse enough!
---
If you didn't want to talk about diversity then don't use it as a reason to change things.
---
To be fair, I'm waiting for that one moment where I carry the last survivor to the hatch, close it when they are almost there, then mori them. 
---
It's a rancid thing to do, but you gotta do it at least once.
---
Lmao your "opinion" is to harass me over a position I don't hold even though I repeatedly told you that you're wrong.
---
But sure I'm toxic because I say face camping is boring. Lmao
---
Imagine MoM being a perk that makes you take a hiatus.  I could never. 
---
I play an M1 killer and do I rarely get hit with it end game where they escape.  Keep more pressure on people. Let them waste it mid game. 
---
No offense, but you said you play Freddy? No wonder.
---
Maybe you could start considering meme guidelines as well?
---
This. *Fucking this*. Shrouds mean fucking nothing, and Black Box is fucking pointless.
---
Well, can't say I didn't try. You're your own worst enemy.
---
Because hes fine as is.
---
I would try to email them again, maybe you have a screenshot or some proof for your legacy to show them?  I hope you get it back but its not looking too good since its been so long already.
---
Dont play console I've just heard shes the best, arguments for Billy too.
---
overcharge pairs well with huntress lullaby to force failed skillchecks and massively stall generators as they both stack, works well on freddy.
---
I think it should only be that high during the EGC, otherwise that wouldn't even give the Killer a chance if the last gen was next to a gate. But it should definitely be higher normally; maybe 30% max, but not 50.
---
It's always good to have low expectations but instantly declaring him "gutted" on arival without having actually seen **anything** is stupid.
---
It also doesn't work against most good, experienced killers. So it is completely unviable at high ranks, at least during chases.
---
HES CONSIDERED THE WORST KILLER IN THE GAME AND HES ‚ÄúFINE?‚Äù
---
Lmao picking an argument over nothing, and raging because you were wrong was you trying?
---
If i had a dime for everytime someone on this sub said 
---
&gt;Freddy is not as bad as people say
---
I would have a lot of fucking dimes
---
Look at it this way: it *is* impossible to kill the last survivor if they find the hatch first and escape through it.  The killer finding the hatch first doesn‚Äôt guarantee them a kill, it does guarantee the survivor an escape if they do.
---
Your actually pissing me off. God, I just wanted to say that I thought the black girl would make a good survivor. But your taking it like I should take into consideration every race on the planet when this is just a fucking game I have no control over. Like, holy shit, I said diverse ONCE.
---
It‚Äôs a really good strat, but god is it boring to play. I‚Äôve never seen so many immersed Survivors... as soon as they realise what you‚Äôre doing, they just stop touching gens I swear. Only reason I stopped playing Trapper tbh
---
You're the problem with dbd. Keep spewing your ignorance and toxicity üëç
---
Also tier lists are almost 100 percent bias. Nurse is only the best if you are good at her. Otherwise spirit and Billy are both better and easier to use. I assume hag is the best because she can do what nurse does, just with setup beforehand. Billy may be better but I dont play Billy, I just know what he does
---
The only one prolonging this interaction is you. I only got toxic after your continued harrasnent and I don't care how you feel about it
---
You can do this with many perks. Doesn‚Äôt make them good.
---
uninstall and killer can never find you
---
One of them doesn't require grinding.
---
But well gg ez is a kinda relative thing. If I get gg ez when I get only 1K or something like that, then well, I kinda had it coming, next time I'll try to be better. If I'm get gg ez from the last survivor, I'm like: bruh
---
I‚Äôve never bought a character with shards or cells, but I‚Äôm fairly certain you don‚Äôt get the extra outfit that way. 
---
Such as Tapp only having his jacket outfit, and not having cop uniform.
---
If PC is an option, it‚Äôs probably the best version of the game, though the PS4 probably has the largest community.
---
Sorry my comment hurt your fragile survivor main ego. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
On steam you can only buy the bundles (killer + survivor) so for example if you buy myers you'll get laurie. If you buy them ig then you'll only get the killer and you have to buy the survivor with points too.
---
That's dumb. The killer used a whole perk slot for that exact situation. They should be able to use their perks.
---
Once you figure out survivor, it‚Äôs not all that hard. It can just get frustrating finding a decent team, killer that isnt boring to play against or decent connection. If you fuck up, you still have 2 more chances and your team can carry you. I‚Äôve escaped so many games that I didn‚Äôt deserve honestly.
---
Killer, it‚Äôs all you. You fuck up, GG. Unless you‚Äôre playing potatoes. This is my experience, and I do main killer. Also why survivor main streamers suck ass on killer whereas killer main streamers normally do OK on survivors.
---
look at my posts, fam.
---
Really?? I thought she was some type of witch. I can see how Hag would relate to a Wendigo.
---
basic bitch billy, and the no nuts nurse.  
---
Type to eat nothing but dry, unflavored oats in the morning, every day.
---
The fact he tried to agree with a sarcastic statement you made to make him look foolish and ended up making himself look more foolish is incredle.
---
You have some solid arguments
---
Ora!
---
Yeah, and that wastes as much time as a trapper setting up. If you play him like that he is probably better than other killers, even wraith and LF if you are really good, but I dont think hes very good. He isn't the worst imo, but he still needs a buff and his rework would need to try to make him worse. I'm only worried that he will not feel like freddy with his rework. I doubt he will be worse. Look at legion. His is better, just not fun.
---
Low settings are actually the most useful. Less grass, killer redlight visible through walls etc.
---
i also see you have nothing to say on my arguments so get rekt, boiiiiiii
---
What rank are you?
---
I don‚Äôt ever buy anything that I won‚Äôt touch right away. If it was me, I would absolutely wait until I had a PC. The game goes on sale multiple times a year, I would just grab it later.
---
He is good against Rank 20 survivors but he is bad at red, purple and green ranks. ;)
---
What‚Äôs your rank?
---
Killers also tend to be much faster than the survivor though, so they can find the hatch much more easily just because they don't have to worry about being caught, alongside default speed and abilities that would help with getting across the map.
---
Most likely ingame currency, not blood points but the glowy yellow one. Sorry I've never used them so I dont know what they are called and don't care enough to look it up lol
---
They worked about two weeks ago when i tried it
---
The game is truly special. I payed full price and I own all the DLC. That's about 75 euros added up, and I've played over 1000 hours. Don't listen to the people who screech "game is shit", those are people who've played religiously themselves most of the times. 
---
The game has it's problems but the good outweighs the bad.
---
I'm actually working on a Killing Floor chapter concept featuring the fleshpound!
---
Perk 3 is already a Nea perk
---
Half right. Half wrong. 
---
People who are good at the game and understand the ability of Nurse, regardless of their personal skill, can still see that Nurse is the best. You‚Äôre either very new to the game or incredibly stupid if you don‚Äôt see the Nurse as #1. 
---
The only time tier lists become bias in at like #6-#15. And that‚Äôs only if you consider Myers any lower than 6, not sure how you‚Äôd do that but it happens. 
---
There are objective facts in this game. Top 5 killers in this game is an objective fact. 
---
Hag isn‚Äôt the best on console.
---
Because the point of hag is to hit survivors who walk into your traps not chase them around the map. So her info and map awareness comes from traps. If you go chasing people around as hag you will definitely get owned.
---
Nothing will top the first one for me. I think that's the coolest shit.
---
 The only thing that annoys me is the first person view with it. The fabric on her arms look a little weird
---
From what I‚Äôve heard/seen, it‚Äôs the fact that his power doesn‚Äôt help in the chase. Huntress, Nurse, Plauge all have range, while Clown and Hag all have powers that actually hinder the survior. Freddy‚Äôs power has none of that. He has no way of defending gens/hooks since a survivor must be asleep to be attacked.
---
His power, personally I like it and I preform decently well at mid ranks, however its mainly at high ranks that he struggles at for the reasons given.
---
What I do with my time is none of your business. I work and play video games and school and have time to do so (also people with time don‚Äôt usually have jobs to have money and people with money don‚Äôt have time because jobs, but there are of course always exceptions and such) . Battle passes are more for Free-2-Play games because they do ‚Äúneed‚Äù/WANT that extra money since their game is free and give free characters (still use in game currency to earn and purchase those characters but it‚Äôs still free new content ex: paladins and Smite). DBD I already paid for. And people actually do spend money on cosmetics, and the DLC of course. A battle pass to me, (in terms of dbd) means they are being money hungry (because we already paid for their game and possible dlc packs).  If they really wanted to add something to the game, maybe add new modes üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (and it looks like I‚Äôm saying that aggressively or snooty, I think the current game mode is fine, if we get new modes, cool, if not, fine)
---
Sorry. I just think it's deja vu tier (even lower). Killers pick up survivors and even if they wouldn't - you can usually tell whether or not a survivor is recovering by looking if they're standing still.
---
It's the nichest of niche.
---
&gt;Yeah, and that wastes as much time as a trapper setting up.
---
Not really but even so you get more out of it. Aside from that I see your point about him being less fun, I'm just concerned he'll be worse and less fun.
---
A few perks that would help would be  Hex: Ruin (of course), Nurse‚Äôs Calling, Monitor and Abuse, and Sloppy Butcher.  Something along those lines will get you good results but you want to remember to try and use your frenzy to injure as many people off the bat and then chase the last person you hit usually.
---
I use bbq, nurses, ruin and sloppy. How about you?
---
well i am going against pretty much only red ranks or 5-8 ranks
---
Me uncrouching as pig as I approach a gen being worked on
---
I think you forgot to tag this post as shitpost
---
8, but going against rank 3-8
---
It was sarcasm dude lol I wouldn‚Äôt come to this subreddit if I thought the game was shit
---
&gt; Usually they do disconnect thinking it is a Mori if you swing a few times after downing them.
---
LOL. Good going.
---
Yeah, the Mori is the obvious thing to bring, it's funnier with the Shroud.
---
I see the connection: they both love children
---
That's because Killers are focusing more on what's further out moving in the distances than what's directly on our peripheral edges.
---
I said I dont play console. I know nurse is the best, shes just garbage on console except for people that are real good with her, from what I understand. You dont need to be a dick and assume I'm bad at the game because I assumed that with everyone I know who plays on console say that they have never played against a good nurse, and that they go against good hags regularly, that I put hag above her. Yes shes still the best but I have never heard of a actually good nurse. Dont be a dick over a difference of opinion. I have 2k hours on the game I think I understand it pretty well.
---
he also have some great pluses, people quite never can flashlight you to save a survivor from a grab if they aren't in dream world, he slows down the game quite a lot if you put everyone to sleep, he can locate pretty much everyone, he gets a nice move speed boost to chase, you can play some mind games right before putting someone to sleep. i really enjoyed playing him.
---
True, but I still think the survivor being camped should receive blood points or something. Technically, they are contributing to the match by distracting the Killer. Alternatively, split up the escape bonus and tie it to generator progression: grant 1500 points for the first three generators completed, 1500 for the final two, and another 3000 for escaping.
---
Killers can abuse maps just as easily as survivors can.  Is it more situational?  Of course, but when a killer abuses a map it‚Äôs much more difficult to deal with imo.  For example, Impossible skillchecks doctor on the game.
---
he probebly lagged out, no 1 brings 2 amazing adons to dc, but its the same way aroud too, if 1 survivor dcs and killer still get the other 3, he doesent pip
---
Thank you! Just wanted to make sure it was possible. Also you have to pay for the pig, the nightmare, the cannibal, and the shape. No way around it right? Because I see it only has options for the yellow currency and not the red one
---
*Skull of Dire Ahamkara spam intensifies*
---
I made a Terminator survivor+killer concept a few hours ago, got flames because ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a horror movie‚Äù and ‚Äúsomeone else has the license‚Äù bruh it‚Äôs a concept post for fun
---
Funniest thing I've spectated in forever, lol!!! I really thought she was going to make it ;\_;
---
IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU AS A FRIEND, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU A TROPHY!
---
If you buy it in the Steam/Playstation/Xbox store: The only thing you get instead of buying in ingame with shards/auric cells  is an "exclusive" cosmetic item (until now only a top for survivors, but it's only a recolor)
---
Yeah, there were definitely a few words exchanged between her and the killer after game, lol.
---
I would say he crashed, he has good add-ons
---
\*when you don't read your power description on the killer you just bought\*
---
Get better at killer. I play huntress, and let me tell you, that learning curve almost made me kill the game. But, once I got good, those long range snipes are sooo satisfying, and the most fun thing in the game. Trust me, killer is so worth learning. Nurse gets boring though, so don't play her. I suggest huntress and spirit, but play who you find fun. I know several freddy mains and hes real bad. They have fun, and that's what matters.
---
It's almost impressive.
---
His power is very annoying imo.
---
The dream world is just... yuck.
---
I mean.... it‚Äôs so easy to get out of sleep is the issue my guy.  The chances you get everyone asleep at the same time is so slim, and especially against SWF it‚Äôs close to impossible to win with Freddy.
---
My guess is that they will have another test for people if they don‚Äôt reschedule it.
---
(Chuckles) I'm in danger
---
Correct. Those are licensed Killers. That means that BHVR had to pay for the right to use them, and we have to pay to play them.
---
Yeah, a mechanic that would maybe reward the hooked survivor with the points the killer is losing. That would at least feel like it wasn't a waste of time for the hooked survivor. Good suggestion.
---
I just wished I knew about this sooner, hope there is another test on the way so I can try too participate.
---
Yep. Rancor became a staple in my builds and i just wait to kill him last. Pairs well with STBFL ironically. If you run bbq, you dont even need to mori the man, just use your instadown for the hook
---
Freddy is all ready the best killer in the game even without perks.
---
Can confirm. Before the pip changes, I was consistently getting to rank 1 using mostly Clown. I took pride knowing I was one of the rare Clown mains at rank 1 on PS4. Of course, the old pipping numbers allowed leniency with your loadout.  I didn't run Ruin 99% of the time, and still managed to pip consistently despite having 1-2 gens left at the end. With the new system, I have yet to get to rank 1 using Clown. But that's because I usually stop playing once I get to rank 8 or so and then the reset comes. I have to run Ruin or I'll get steamed before more than 2 hooks, constantly changing perks to figure out how to counter most of what I've been dealing with that night. I still have fun, still pip, but it definitely requires a little more concentration to get even a safety pip.
---
If he becomes OP and then gets nerfed to a fair level I‚Äôm ok with that.  He shouldn‚Äôt be nurse but having him around the tier of Huntress to Billy would be fun (I just bought him so I‚Äôm gonna try him out and level him up before the rework releases)
---
fuck you totally called me out. I totally flinch every time I lunge and it's most certainly a weakness
---
They just need to fix the ranking system.
---
Damn I wouldnt play anything else if were were blessed with such a killer.
---
i don't see the point of your cynicism
---
I think it kind of sucks we will never see Jason due to the legal issues and f13 the game. I know the trapper is practically Jason but to me it‚Äôs just not the same lol I want to see all the horror icons in one game together:(
---
Yeah I'm currently leveling him for all the perks right now too. Tbh I expect him to be around doctor Myers and pig tier. Not great but still viable at most ranks.
---
And literally no one cares what you think, you don't represent the opinion of skilled players
---
Weirdly enough I have the opposite problem, but then again I try to play solo altruistically and my team always fucks me over so ig that's the real issue.
---
There's always been chat on PC
---
Not cynicism. He‚Äôs just shit. ;)
---
What, nooooo, Freddy mains clearly don't know the truth and are delusional. 
---
Sure, Freddy has good stalling, the best tracking and information, also has stealth and strong addons, but those 7 seconds. Yeah, you can use them to mindgame, but 7secondsfedoramanbad, it is the truth.
---
I hope I don't have to write I am being sarcastic, but it is reddit, sooo. Anyway, sad about the rework, he is so unique right now, but hopping for the best.
---
Nea's Mori is the purple flashlight
---
After match yea, is that not mid-match?
---
That just means someone else gets fucked.
---
If they are going to camp, *someone* gets fucked.
---
I know I can't change your mind, I'm still going to complain that the band wagon is getting rid of a character I enjoy because if their inability to adapt. You likely have a favourite killer, imagine what it's be like if that killer was mis understood, everyone complained enough to make the devs give that character a complete overhaul. Would that not bother you that they'd effectively deleted a character you enjoyed?
---
No it is before the match. In the lobby while readying up
---
To get Merciless killer you have to 2 pip.  Doesn‚Äôt matter how as far as I‚Äôm aware but you have to get a double pip.
---
Do you know when the next patch might be?
---
You literally said you must be dumb or new to assume nurse is bad. I said nurse is bad on console. That's it. I wouldn't call saying dont be a dick being a butthurt kid.
---
This is what endgame was made for
---
Oh ok, just making sure.
---
You know those fake doctors that pop up? The doctor can not only see them, but he can also see their auras across the map. Those doctors only spawn a few feet away from survivors so they are a plain as day giveaway where survivors are and they spawn VERY frequently. Freddy does not have even remotely as strong of tracking ability until he already has found them. They only time the dream aura reading is useful is if you somehow lost the survivor. If you slept 2 or more people then sure it can help you know where the others are while chasing one person, but that person will wake up LOONG before you end your first chase. 
---
For the slugging, survivors get to 95% on their own unless you pick them up, but you aren't if you're slugging obviously. So other survivors will very easily be able to heal that 5% before they get put to sleep lol.
---
True, and I apologize if that is the case but it's worth it imo. Also I haven't seen a non MoM obsession in a long time.
---
This is awesome!
---
Have fun wasting time if there is only one survivor nearby lol You just gonna sleep him and run full map trying to find someone else while they go wake up? That's a huge time waste, much more so than it is for that survivor. If you KNOW there is more than one person there, then yea sleep both, but most of the time that would be entirely guesswork.
---
It's fine I misspoke (misstyped?) Also your flair implies otherwise lol.
---
If it's a baby billy just 360 his saw
---
K what font is this
---
B-B-But double blocks is NEEEEDED on freddy, because then otherwise there will be SEVEN SECONDS before you can hit a survivor. SEVEN SECONDS!!!111!
---
A year ago, I don't heard anybody to defend Freddy when developers announced Freddy rework, now, it's too late because they already finished his rework probably.
---
Black box is freddies worst addon, just use class photo to find your obsession
---
Freeedy
---
The doctor looks swol
---
Spongebob font
---
From what I've heard, he's gonna be completely different. So it won't really be a buff or a nerf.
---
And his mask just would be a pair of swimming goggles poorly strechted on his normal mask
---
There were people complaining about Freddys rework happening, but they were the true Freddy mains who knew that he wasn't a bad killer. I imagine many Freddy mains were trying to convince other people that he isn't bad, hence more people complaining about his rework now.
---
3 gen anything is strong but its boring 20 minute matches of not committing to chases and you eventually will lose unless the survivors  get bored
---
I've played the game to death. I'm happy to get a battle pass for something to do.
---
This game is fucking amazing value for money. Hundreds if not thousands of hours.
---
Most tripple A games give you 8-15 hours and cost full price
---
Oh yeah 100% the pip system makes this a pain in the ass. But if you don't care about it then you'll be fine anyways.
---
&gt;survivor has UnbreakaBILL and a key
---
Dwights Pigga
---
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just bad on console except for people that are really good with her.‚Äù 
---
So my statement was ‚Äúyou must be dumb or new to assume Nurse is bad‚Äù, yet here you are admitting that she can be good if you‚Äôre good with her. 
---
Nurse is bad on PC too if you aren‚Äôt good with her. 
---
Going back to my statement ‚Äúyou must be new or dumb to not see the potential power of Nurse‚Äù. 
---
If you see the potential power of Nurse regardless of skill...you do not apply to being new or dumb. Not hard to understand.
---
Guessing you saw the WatchMojo video?

---
Some games you hook every survivor two times then they escape, why perfect rotation isn't a good idea
---
Long time ago
---
I'd prefer if they did. Basically, have Coldwind function like the other base maps.
---
I apologize, I read it in such a way I felt it was aimed at me. Also I dont really know what goes on on console so you probably know more than me and are right anyway. I dislike being wrong but at this point I feel like I'm the one being a dick.
---
Glad to know i'm not the only one
---
Hell yeah. I main Spirit and Freddy
---
People bandwagon on the hate because they don‚Äôt know how to play him. As a freddy main I tend to get 3k/4ks.
---
Ik the delay has been there forever and when getting chased by a killer it's been a hassle but that is super rare. Now with endgame though it makes a huge difference when your survival entirely depends on your fellow survival leaving the map.
---
Errrgh shame it‚Äôs a DualShock looks awesome though.
---
Doin gens you?
---
Yeah, everything was for sale. Prices varied and I cant recall exactly how much this one was but around ¬£80.
---
You have to put /s after your sentence. Otherwise it's not sarcasm. duh. How else would we know??
---
I think we just disagree on what is greedy. Oh well
---
The power does not give you a boost in movement speed. What are you on about?
---
completing all the gens and opening the gate isn't failing to complete the objective...
---
When I brought up the idea of EGC making the encounters killer sided I meant more commonly then not, it is TOO much in favour of the killer with the timer going that it doesn't lead to any engaging gameplay against smarter survivors since it isn't worth it to go for saves, body block, secure both gates, and make sure everyone escapes as much anymore with EGC active.
---
I also never said make it survivor sided either... give each party equal chance of killing/surviving all the way through, though obviously dependent a bit more on the # of survivors left.
---
Using perks is toxic.
---
Using items is toxic.
---
Killing survs is toxic.
---
Sacrificing survs is toxic.
---
Escaping is toxic. 
---
The only non-toxic move is not to play
---
You see. Rather than going for hatch when theres an exit gate. Go for the damn exit gate
---
The majority of pigs addons are pretty worthless, it's sad
---
I'm kinda confused. Cause on twitter they say it is just the prototype.
---
https://twitter.com/GoodSmile_US/status/1132101496366096384
---
Either way, looking forward for chubby Trapper.
---
I play the game like once every 8 weeks thanks for the tips tho you gatekeeping dork.
---
it really seems like that is the case, people do tend to like to hop on the first train they see without even thinking about constructing their own opinion
---
I bet the entity itself smiled at this one.
---
To each their own. Thanks for the feedback.
---
And if the killer does happen to find them... they dc faster than u can cum after jacking it to a p

not the power per-se but the add-ons
---
1. only at the end so you can waste as much of their time as you can for team to do gens
---
2. yes
---
3. die on hook instead, no reason to punish the killer because you don't like their choice
---
4. no, its their objective to kill you
---
5. no you might as well either try to escape, or die with your points
---
6-14. ok now you're just being facetious...
---
This isn't about what people should or shouldn't do, this is about a counter to it
---
YOU WHAT
---
I think I plan on collecting during regular gameplay. I‚Äôll try taking a screenshot on PS4.
---
What are you talking about?  If you find the hatch first as survivor you just jump in.  How is that not straight up leaving?
---
"Quality game" Boy, I'd cut BHVR some slack if you knew what was good for you. At least they're genuinely trying and communicating with their fanbase. One of the main reasons I got lost out of TF2. None of the devs were speaking a word. And believe you me, they are NOT doing the "Minimum amount of work" Get the fuck outta here with that BS. Just how ungrateful can you actually be?
---
Usually I get annoyed with people using titles like "Leaked Footage of Freddy Rework".
---
But this is too fucking beautiful.
---
Perkless Freddy sounds like a ‚Äúnightmare‚Äù good luck my friend
---
Aren't you one of the mods on the Last Year server?

Omg, I‚Äôve been doing it wrong *all along*! Sarcasm can not be implied by tone or syntax. It must be blatantly stated and labeled as such, right!? You weren‚Äôt sarcastic either as there was no **/s**!1!1!
---
(Side note: This is getting really meta.)
---
Sometimes you gotta take the L. Plus not every survivor is gonma get the message its why you've just gotta deal with it sometimes
---
Pi–∑–∑a.
---
You‚Äôre probably right :/
---
I love how your comment has more upvotes than the post itself
---
&gt; second grade prostitute
---
honestly  at  first  i  was  like  WTF.
---
I love spirit's locker grab, she just gently caresses the survivor then grabs them
---
Who?
---
I mean the conversation isn't about moris, but sure. Make them require the surv to be hooked twice before you use them, EZ PZ. 
---
Moris are a bit different in that they are offerings with a certain degree of rarity, but sure nerf em I don't care.
---
Oh? I dont find rancor toxic and it's quite avoidable as a survivor. I only find obsession 50 percent of the time and rarely mori. As people said just be immersed.
---
i read this in the spongebob narrator voice
---
Why is either team doing objectives as fast as possible not okay?
---
Seems there is no use talking with someone who lacks empathy and kindness. Have a good day.
---
Ash is so fucking loud, that was the joke XD. Quentin is probably the quietest dude. I never run calm spirit, just iron will. Iron Will on Jake or Quentin makes you damn near silent. Calm Spirit really only matters when Killer's run Crows which is few and very far between. I wouldn't run it.
---
I would buy that if the hatch was close and would happily sacrifice myself if that was the case but the hatch wasn't in the shack, also once I died he left made no effort to look for the hatch.
---
When teammates try get you killed by bodyblocking or throwing a pallet on you when the killer is behind you chasing
---
That bad yeah lol
---
I get no fucking skill checks EVER whenever I have four stacks of Stakeout
---
Read Discordance's quote in the spongebob narrator voice
---
This ^
---
I run it for doctor tbh. If I need an extra perk, I just throw it on in case of a doctor appearing. I can‚Äôt stand my character screaming the whole match.
---
the hag is literally anorexic
---
I find rancor annoying because I'm usually the one who does the chases (my teammates rarely last 30 seconds). If I'm the last one being chased, RIP me despite not having an obsession perk.
---
Regardless, I wouldn't say that makes someone a "dick" for running it, though I would see it just as annoying as Mettle.
---
Blowing up gens with reduced skill check will make you lose quite some time, the hooks is true, thought i never tend to camp so i don't mind it, counter with self-care and medkit is a valid point, but all killers have counters, the fog doesn't affect in anything imo, chase help there is the add-ons as i mentioned before. he has counter-points but he has pro-points, just as all the other killers
---
I get the frustration but blame BHVR. They allow it
---
It's a sad age when we have TL;DR on two sentence comments lol
---
Does that actually work?
---
Yeah if the doors stopped spawning within eyeshot of each other that would make it more fair for the lone Survivor if the Killer gets the hatch closed.  Kind of renders the point of EGC moot if the Killer can just watch both gates with relative ease and the Survivor can't do anything but wait to die.
---
lol, i left an apology at the end for this horrendous mistake.

You really like using red herrings and adhodminems because you can't accept the facts being presented to you. There is no lack of empathy and kindness.. this is just a lack of intelligence and commonsense coming from you. That's why the only two things you can continue to claim which are false is that I lack empathy and kindness.
---
Hey boss, people talk about the strengths of killers without add ons. 
---
Add ons make killers viable. If you‚Äôre running around with the best add ons then no shit the killer is gonna be fine. Hell, Trapper is good with his best add ons. 
---
For future reference and I saw you say this earlier in your argument, rank 5-8 still isn‚Äôt hard. Try doing consistently well against the rank 4‚Äôs*. 
---
You won‚Äôt unless you have a million of his best add ons. He‚Äôs shit without them.
---
I think she‚Äôs using the new PF Flyers cosmetic.
---
Honestly, this guy gets it. I'm a p3 dwight, and if the killer even breathes in my direction, I just have to DC. Seriously, killer should just be removed from the game. They ruin a game that is all about chilling out and doing gens with friends.
---
I know dude I still laughed hard
---
Ah yea, just so few docs these days. I usually run a combo of Balanced Landing, Self-Care, Adrenaline, Quick and Quiet, MoM, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, Iron Will, Hope, Bond, or Unbreakable. Depends on what I'm trying to work on and who I'm playing with.
---
If I play solo, I run selfish perks like Adrenaline, Self-Care, Balanced Landing, and Unbreakable, subbing in Iron Will if I'm having a bad day at running killers or dead hard. If I want to be super aultristic I'll run Borrowed Time and Bond so I can find and heal the homies, bringing in a medkit and taking off Self-Care and Unbreakable.
---
But if I play with the homies I never run Self-Care and just run toxic perks like Hope, Adrenaline, Balanced, and Quick and Quiet. Fuckers will never catch you.
---
lmao, fair enough
---
That‚Äôll teach them to get off those gens
---
the games costs 20 bucks, about 60 if you include the chapters, the games with accepted battlepasses it either counts as a direct DLC and gives an assload of content, or the game is F2P  like DotA or Fortnite.
---
Nah, he‚Äôs more difficult but not impossible, Your goal first and foremost should be try and get as many into the dream state as possible. Do t worry about people running away as once they get a certain distance you can see their aura till they wake up. Just try and stop people from healing each other, doing gens, or healing themselves. If you play right, the game will be slow, but if you play him right, you can control almost the entire match.
---
Detective Tapp
---
There are legit reasons to dc also there are unlegitmate reasons. If we have op perks we dont blame the player for using them. If we disconnect we blame that person that did it and never the real reasons why it happens. I dont get it. There are a few things that will make players dc let's punish them instead of fixing the issues. Makes sense.
---
No, but I call The Nightmare Fredward.
---
Run this with Discordance/Surveillance
---
Your points are literally "I have no reason to give hatch to people who can't win solo against me" that's called being an asshole.
---
Those don't happen as much as they used to, it's usually Dead Hard or hitting someone from the rear as Sprint Burst activates that's responsible.
---

Brutal's really not worth it.

---
Unlike most other Nendoroids Trapper came out fully painted for their first look. They usually show off their first prototypes in greyscale format. Their final product matches the painted prototype upon release. I have 40 Nendoroids currently and haven‚Äôt had any issues with differences between first look painted protos and the final product. I am looking forward as well, hopefully he comes with a hook that can hold other Nendoroids.
---
Eh? It doesn't matter how good you are with the chainsaw, you'll still have to follow the survivors into loops.
---
Read the tag dude, it's a Shitpost
---
Why are you the way that you are?
---
I kinda like this version better than the actual movie.
---
i do that all the time when lunging with wraith and when i hit the survivor i just swing my head backwards in relief
---
I think you're wrong in that there are many players who don't want to play in a way that's unfun, but there's also a level of responsibility that no one can refuse.
---
This is an opportunity for survivors to play in a way that will attempt to stem the amount of tunneling (a pretty unfun strategy) that killers do. You're also correct in that adrenaline also makes NOED more viable as well, as if all the survivors are just going to heal fully when the last gen pops, you might as well make that full heal inconsequential. However, if no one runs adrenaline, more (but not all) survivors will be injured at the end of the game, making NOED less useful. If everyone runs adrenaline, then NOED becomes a necessity as every survivor will have to be taken down two health states come late game. Your arguments of NOED only further illustrates that adrenaline encourages perks and strategies that are unfun and lessen variety of gameplay.
---
Lastly, if neither side gave a damn, then why am I here?
---
No Meg used to be the black chick on the intro. You can see it in the video.
---
TL;DR: don't use TL;DR in comments
---
I need it.... and the Sombra one
---
Just like to run around and play tag and try not to  ruin everyones fun.
---
Also, no need to go through the effort of noting down the items (and now add-ons) in text format, we are already way too grateful for the screenshots! I can note them down later and save you the trouble :)
---
How is this toxic? Shits just a meme, dudes having fun with it.
---
It is ok. But DbD still has not managed making the best strategies also the fun ones, which every videogame should do.
---
the virgin freddy  v. the Chad David
---
I know what it is thanks. Everybody ignores the issue though.
---
Plague is decent, but I think they expected the survivors to cleanse and it would make her a lot higher tier
---
Probably because the post was so low effort that the sub knew better. Didn't know we had it in us tbh.
---
But no SKRRRT &gt;:(
---
Your clown suggestion is just a nerf that turns him into huntress but worse
---
Holy perk build....
---
I'm not upset at all. I enjoy the game and let everyone play as they see fit as long as it's not cheating or breaking ToS. My point is in regards to the comment about not getting points for tea bagging but you do get points for closing the hatch. Closing the hatch is an action leaving through the exit gates is an action. Letting EGC kill the last survivor is a choice, tea bagging is a choice. PS We're all a little mental.
---
With Switch and Mobile ports coming, it'll be 4/5 soon
---
Flair checks out.
---
If you own the killer then don't buy their perks from the shrine, buy spirit fury tho
---
This literally never works unless you're going up against rank 20s now. You fought potato Survivors, period.
---
BHVR: "Freddy buff in here!"
---
Community: *crawls in for maximum diddling*
---
You're one individual in a large community of players. Even if players do have a sense of responsibility (which I don't agree with) it ultimately won't matter cause there is a much larger player base that just doesn't care. I was someone who "boycotted" DS by not running it before it got nerfed. You know how much it did? Absolutely nothing. 
---
I don't have a responsibility to the community. The developers do. Not much more to it.
---
You attach yourself to the game too hard. It‚Äôs not that deep, fam. Letting someone escape because of a bad game is t a bad thing. Get over yourself.
---
The players decide the meta but the devs shape the game. If there is a problem in the meta then it is the developers job to figure out why it's a problem and seek to fix it.
---
A good Freddy is really strong actually. It‚Äôs impossible to be stealthy because you never know where he‚Äôs at. Nobody can body block or flash light save. He essentially has BBQ all the time for those he‚Äôs put into the dream state. If there‚Äôs two survivors left, he can slug and easily find them because of his aura reading. The downfall is waiting 5-7 seconds to hit someone. But guess what? The good survivors it‚Äôll almost always take that long for the first hit anyway.
---
Hopefully you come across them more, the game gets old fast otherwise
---
To be fair, with Frank's and/or the correct perks, he could be very unfun to play against. I say this as a console P3 Legion.
---
But without Frank's, correct perks, Ruin or his exploits or cheap tactics, he was weak. He was easy to genrush because his core design is weak. His power was meant for one purpose: Spreading damage. Which doesn't help you win chases.
---
Easy to injure, hard to down. That was the design for Legion. But this doesn't work in a game like this where time is important for the Killer and Survivors have to go down ASAP for Killers to get the ball rolling and keep a Survivor on the hook at all times.
---
I look forward to this
---
Omg this is adorable.
---
How it's on me when I didn't see anyone defend Freddy a year ago ?
---
I‚Äôd be all over a Huntress one in a second if she gets made!
---
Another one who claims I am attached to the game, get good and maybe someone wouldn't need to let you survive. If you are so pathetic that you think you are entitled to a hatch for free. 
---
and when you are told that stupid apparently the killer is an asshole. lmao when you are desperate for a free because you think the killer who is meant to kill you owes that to you.
---
Yeah I misunderstood I thought you meant the 1v1 situation with a hatch close, not when the door is open.
---
but.. pig! pig can spook too!
---
I want the chibis on top to be flairs
---
I feel the same way sometimes (coming from an Xbox player), but then I was doing that the other day, saved someone at the end game, had only been hooked once, and another player snuck around after the others left to save me. Borrowed time right to the exit gate saved my life.
---
Hopefully this means less reposts? I won't have to see "That's it, I'm getting me mallet" and "Please don't eat my ass spirits" three times every week. At the very least cut down on all the teir lists like other subreddits already have.
---
How many tendies per hour is the job? I prefer 6 but I'm willing to negotiate.
---
Let's be honest.. wtf is 40 meters in this game??.. Jeff's perk doesnt fir in my build.
---
No, just no
---
Because you dob't expect it
---
Good shit üëå
---
Ofc hatch wasn't nearby, the hatch was only going to spawn once you were dead. So for him there was no point to start running around before you killed yourself, you only made him wait unnecessarily.
---
"Look whos shittin in the tall grass"
---
Well yeah you were around the basement when it happened. Trap the window and doors and they can‚Äôt get out before you reach them. And if you have the honing stone and they step in it, their fucked.

Yes I am aware of that now, when I wrote that comment I was pretty new to playing as killer and was a rank 17. Currently rank 11 and grinding bloodpoints for teachable Ruin.
---
I'm curious why I got 2 replies like 2 weeks later haha.
---
That‚Äôs fair. To be honest I just threw 40 meters up there because I don‚Äôt actually know the average distance between survivors most of the time. I obviously don‚Äôt want each survivor to be able to benefit from this at the same time. Maybe if I knew the average distance that gens spawn between each other, I could get a better number up there
---
Adrenaline isn‚Äôt the problem for killers that tunnel
---
OMFG I WAS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE NAME OF THIS GAME FOR THE LONGEST!!!!!!!! It was just a faint memory of my 8 year old self murdering fluffy little bears!!! Thank you so much! I‚Äôm not even subscribed to this sub I just felt like browsing
---
i feel like Slippery Meat would be OP because people can just bring a flashlight, blind you at every pallet and boom, gone. this would make Lightborn meta though
---
my only gripe with the 1v1 scenario is like you agreed with the doors spawning side by side, being to killer sided, but otherwise I'm not to against how it works outside of that instance.
---
STILL looks like trash tho
---
The fuck you build lmao
---
some pretty good ideas here and none of them sound insanely op which is usually the case when people make perk ideas
---
Dude I wish I could get in a game with 2 killers who are just having fun. That would be amazing.
---
Oh yeah your right about the hatch spawn, good point.
---
Freddy is really not meant for chases, but more for ambush and juggling survivors. The more survivors that are asleep at once, the better. With his built-in aura reading and tracking, spreading damage is very effective with Freddy as he can have a psuedo-Nurse's calling built in. With Freddy, you need to choose your victims wisely when they are at their most vulnerable. If you've got more questions, I can help!
---
&gt;Runs successful company
---
Well he kinda burried it along with the employees, so you might say he successfully ran it into the ground.
---
If I have a bad game, or maybe the killer plays a certain build that I disagree with and I get salty, 99% of the time I just leave as soon as the game ends, whether I win or not. No gg's, no salt or hate, just silence. Its honestly easier than doing g anything else. Killers seem to feed on salt, so I'm not going to bother giving it to them.
---
However I will stay and talk shit if the killer tunnels and face camps for LITERALLY no reason. That shit tilts me more than noed and ruin on a nurse.
---
Upvote for the correct use of the word ‚Äòtoo‚Äô.
---
The survivor finding the hatch and jumping into it before the killer finds them has nothing to do with EGC and has always been a possibility long before it existed so I don't see how they correlate with one another.
---
I like the idea of No One Left Behind being an exhausting perk. I think 20 secs is a bit too short but I think that could be a great perk.
---
Quick Haunted Grounds tip.
---
I dont know if it's a bug, but a patch made hex totems all have a clearance check so it does not spawn in front of survivors at the start of the game. Haunted Grounds does not do this. If you see a hex where you spawn, or have the Bond perk to see where others spawn in relation to the hex, that hex is likely haunted grounds.
---
No thanks, the amount of times Ive been left last alive because my teammates have no common sense? Im super good there.
---
AHHHH!!! GET AWAY AHHHHHHH!!!
---
Yeah I've been on the receiving end of Blood Warden haha scary the first time it happened.
---
That's sorta the cool thing about the two perks I mentioned is that it can make the game feel tense again. I know everytime I see Blood Warden pop up I'm in for some trouble.
---
Sole Survivor is definitely not balanced. I really like the NOLB change. I still wouldn‚Äôt use it, but some people would. At least it wouldn‚Äôt be useless anymore.
---
Thanks for just adding to the problem. It-s much easier to just brand someone as evil.Survivors are the devil right? Nevermind fixing the bullshit survivors have to endure. And yes, I do realise this is reddit and this post will be downvoted to shit by baby killers... you're just proving my point cheaters. LOOSE THE TRAINING WHEELS
---
still a 5 second stun and if the killer immediately downs and picks you up, the 20 second difference between tier 1 and 3 won't matter.
---
I love this
---
yeah i've noticed he scratches the locker and sparks appear before he grabs them
---
i saw the red sress cosmetic, felt like i was about to be molested by a 600+ granny
---
Imagine being this upset over DC jokes
---
Slippery meat would 100% need a cooldown and lower count. With the amount of pallets on any given map that would be insanely OP especially combined with a flashlight. This would make any other scratch mark perk obsolete.
---
I also think 20% is too much for sole survivor. Gens already go at a crazy fast rate.
---
Those perk icons go along with ascending?
---
NO. No more exhaustion recovery while running.
---
Issa joke post
---
Doesn't mater witch killer you're plauing you can just camp your way to victory. Don't forget your ruin, sloppy and noed. Right fellow redditors???? Keep wondering why people dc on you.
---
If you didnt get the joke clap your hands
---
*entire comments section claps*
---
skillcheck nightmare has no weakness
---
A Nurse's Calling is very good, yes, and if you don't intend on leveling Nurse up anytime soon, I'd say go for it.
---
Other than that, is kinda depends who you're playing as to what Perks you should be eyeing. Barbecue &amp; Chili, Hex: Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury, and Bamboozle are all also pretty good for just about any Killer. I really like running Surveillance and Hex Perks on high mobility Killers. Aside from the "meta" Perks, it just depends on who you're playing and your particular playstyle!
---
Yeah noticed after I posted and read the rest of it lol. Just too lazy to correct myself. They should have dc lose you 4-8 pips. Have an honor system like most games. With the reset. If you dc 1-3 times it‚Äôs 2 pips. 4-6 times 4 pips. 6-9 it‚Äôs 10. And if you dc 10 times. You get rank 21. Where you will only play with other rank 21s or if no game is found within 10 minutes, puts you against normal ranks.
---
karma always strikes back
---
Yeah, forgot about the cooldown. Probably would change it to be more dance with me where you have a static duration but with a cooldown of 40/30/20 seconds
---
The only thing I dislike is when a MoM player has an instaheal and tbags. Its also worse when they all come to body block you so you have a terrible time getting to the hook
---
I somehow doubt that the skill gap between east asia and na is anything insanely noticeable. Dbd isn‚Äôt league of legends, but what do I know. Maybe everyone in east asia is just somehow superior at holding shift and running around a pallet and holding the w key and pressing m1.
---
Also to your point about everyone playing nurse and billy, the changes had nothing to do with that. Nurse and Billy are arguably two of the best killers and their popularity shouldn‚Äôt be surprising because it‚Äôs been that way for awhile.
---
We‚Äôre all playing the same game. DS changes and the inclusion of MoM effects everyone playing, if the devs find it necessary to fix it they will. If not, then they won‚Äôt. Maybe just, I don‚Äôt know, use hex ruin and don‚Äôt tunnel if DS is making you lose lol.
---
It's not about the joke. It's about the way the whole thing is seen
