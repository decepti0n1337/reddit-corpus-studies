Should be good enough to play without a swf right? And tunneling by everyone's definition is focusing on strictly one person the entire time, purposely giving up mid chase to get the unhooked person. Sad that people still want to cry and bitch about everything on this sub 
---
---
---
My choice for toxic build on Legion when I get the teachables and then get those perks to 3 will be nurse's calling, Thanatophobia, either ruin or NOED, and discordance. 
---

---
Right now I use Discordance, mad grit, Noed or MYC, and Insidious when basement guardian or hangman's trick when i'm not
---
Totems should not also feel like a game on its own. Perks associated with totems are powerful because they can be destroyed, except NOED, it does the job alert free and strangers will not come to help if you're hooked because why take the risk when there are fewer pallets and a rampant hillbilly on steroids at 119% is lingering around. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Some games you cannot find a totem for the life of it, I've had games on Fractured Cowshed where the entire game Ruin was active and survivors asked me where the hell it was because they couldn't find it, it was a couple of months ago, so even before they tweaked the spawns. 
---
Not every game should guarantee a perfect Ruin totem spawn. One thing that could be tweaked is how the totem gets lit, e.g. the first person to get a skill check will activate the totem making it lit. This, in turn, will prevent survivors from having a valid reason to destroy a dull totem they encountered, and if they did it first before any skill check appeared then Ruin would still be at play but spawned elsewhere. 
---
Hmm, fair enough, cause I remember playing legion and having fun, but I also recall a LOT of DC's when I would do well.
---
bUt NeA iS tHe KiLlEr DuH /sArCaSm 
---
What an aggressive username for someone who feels they need help as a survivor. 
---
I don't like playing Legion either. I wish I knew the future, and the devs released the killer, and survivor separately instead of a bundle. I would of bought the survivor only.
---
I am garbage.
---
I enjoyed my time as legion, just was confused at the amount of hate he has gotten over time.
---
Not entirely sure. It would probably be too punishing for the killer. Pallets etc wastes a ton of time already. Killers shouldn't really have any "weaknesses". More like a ability that the survivors would have to take into account while playing.
---
The jumpscare part might be fine, depending on how long manequine mode lasts and how long the transformation sequence is.
---
Though I feel that there are two sets of options and one of them will most likely be ignored depending on which is worse. I.e if manequine doesn't last long it will only be used so you get the jumpscare power. Or if jumpscare power is the worse one, people will go back to a doll box to get manequine back right away.
---
Doubt people would mix.
---
Leather face rules. Much more fun than Hillbilly. There feels a real air of aggression to everything he does. I really hope that there are cosmetics coming for him eventually!
---
Ahh, but if there is three dcs you just let them have it huh?
---
Alright here is a cool gamer tip to avoid getting banned for insulting people. Just **don't** insult people!
---
The dlc will come out soon after the ptb. I don't know if you realize this but it's been a simultaneous release across all platforms except for the clown dlc (because they had issues with)
---
Mainly since BHVR wants to discourage un-fun behavior.
---
A survivor has little to no fun if they are basically dead if they are the first one caught in just a straight kill = win system. Since we HAD that system before emblems and there was still a lot of complaints about it. A straight kill = win system means the best strategy will be to camp and tunnel, to get survivors out of the match as fast as possible. It creates boring, predictable games.  
---
Not just that, in your post here
---
" it's just that they are way too lenient and render the ranking system a farce, leading to wildly uneven matches"
---
is exactly why they ARE changing the pipping system. To make it so that those who perform regularly and get good Emblems get higher ranks. Those who regularly perform poorly won't get into those higher ranks anymore. 
---
"but I don't see why we need all that complexity for something that is ultimately exclusively about match-making."
---
Because as much as people say they don't care about rank and pipping, from the large outcry as we see from these changes, from when the emblem system was first introduced, and from even before the emblem system that people actually DO care about rankings despite it being mainly just a match-making tool. 
---
Since people do actually care about rankings, BHVR is trying to discourage un-fun behavior (camping/tunneling on the killer) and encourage good behavior (actually saving your teammates and healing them) through it. 
---
Ace mains are *quaking.*
---
Update: I’m rank 3 and almost rank 2 :)
---
Huh?
---
Chests are untapped potential tbh
---
Very helpful. Thanks
---
This is the one I was waiting for!! So much detail lost in gameplay. 
---
It’s a pretty extreme contrast, mainly because of the “difficulty.” Survivors get people trying it out who can’t play him/her well and get comfortable thinking that Legions trash. Then you have those people who are good enough killers to use him/her which usually immediately enrages survivors. 
---
Yeah on her right foot. 
---
In this picture it's hidden by her... loincloth? Dress? Whatever one would call her modesty garment, it's blocking the missing toe. 
---
Shes a lady. 
---
Whoa whoa whoa shes a lady. 
---
Touch a fountain and shell know, 
---
cause she lost one of her toes. 
---
Shes a lady...
---
IME, Trapper and Michael are the least tryhards. In reverse, Pig, Wraith, LF and Huntress are the most toxic.
---
Survivor wise, Jeff, David and Jake are usually nice. 
---
It could have been that one player some time ago that said if someone were to mess with the hex totem they'd attack lol. 
---
Yeah, I remember being called "one of the best legions" that person had seen, and it was about a month after release, so maybe I was secretly decent and that's why people dced but it could've been they were bad.
---
TBF everyone has stupid definitions of toxic, even patrolling a hook once and getting lucky gives you a pretty decent chance to be called a camper, and making the smart play and going to for an easy instadown gets you called a tunneler.
---
Yes they do, Survivors just don't seem to be able to accept that.
---
Alright, thanks
---
Worst thing is that all three leveling systems are pretty redundant and reflect time played, not skill. I wonder if they'll move to using Devotion and get rid of Rank for matchmaking once the dedicated servers go live. Level would then just be used to scale the size of the bloodweb.
---
I don’t really dislike playing against Legion myself based on my own experiences with Legions, but from what I hear, people hate Legion because survs “can’t counter” Legion and because they’re annoying/boring to go against. Also they hate Frank’s Mixtape. I’m on console and am lucky enough to have not encountered Legions w/ Frank’s Mixtape, but I’d imagine it isn’t fun for survivors.
---
This is actually a really good concept. 
---
I'm hoping that one day the devs will make the hatch only spawn once the third survivor has been sacrificed. This will stop survivors camping the hatch or looking for it when the third survivor is hooked. 
---
I don't plan on giving up yet! Just planning on tomorrow being a unique piece compared to the last 30 days in celebration of keeping this up for a straight month, somehow.
---
I recall one time I ran that considered op combo at the time, it was the mixtape and another item, I got a 4 DC after only like 5 minutes, so yeah people don't like it too much, but it's one of those things where I feel people forget the annoying things they do to others, so when something annoying happens to them they freak out.
---
Ooh, I know! Have a small chance of a survivor getting something like, say, a bomb from a chest that detonates and puts them into the dying state or that stuns them and alerts the killer of their location?
---
Pallet, windows and vaults don't work to counter him, so it's hard to lose him unless a survie sprint bursts away then urban evades into a bush and prays for coverage. I understand what the devs were going for with him but damn if he wasnt poorly executed.
---
I'm very excited for the release of The Purge though. 
---
Why do people hate legion for?
---
I played a game not that long ago where I found myself chasing the same three people over and over again.  I had eliminated two, then found myself chasing the last one again when this thought occurred to me:  Where the hell is the fourth guy?
---
I broke off that chase and started looking around the map.  I checked the perimeter, I checked the larger structures—no fourth dude.
---
On a whim I went and checked the basement.  Popped the first locker and what do you know, there the guy was.  I have no concrete proof of it, of course, but my suspicion is that he went straight for the basement then popped a locker and just sat there waiting for either an open exit or the hatch.  I tossed him on the hook and left.
---
Last person got the exit.  They made no attempt at all to come get the guy in the basement.
---
You're my hero. I only played DBD on the computer until it potatoed out and then I switched to PS4. I'm glad they release same day but I hope it isn't that buggy--I want my vomit mama.
---
Does anyone else think her face resembles[Elizabeth Moss](https://imgur.com/gallery/Jzuasek) ?
---
Psssshhh
---
Kill them in one hook }=] mu hahahaha 
---
definitely the old one!
---
Or have it to where the chest clamps down on the survivors arm injuring them, and they have to perform a difficult skill check to escape.
---
Not being sarcastic, that's pretty awesome; you're looking past her sickness and disfiguration to see the gorgeous person underneath.
---
Also IIRC in her lore she was stated as being renowned for her great beauty before she got sick, so, in fact, she was canonically very pretty, at least to most people during her time period.
---
I can understand the annoyance around him being a massive counter to the basic playstyle of a survivor, thanks for the contribution to the post :)
---
Most likely a health mix of both. I’m sure you’re a decent killer, so take Hag for example. Survivors expect Hag to chase them.. but that’s not how you play Hag. So when someone plays her properly and teleports everywhere they’re either seen as a good Hag, or a tunnelling camping Hag. I’m sure once Plague settles in the Legion hate will die down, hopefully anyways.
---
Lol I do the same thing as killer.  If I know one of their members is pure useless I'll fucking slug second from last just so I can find them kill them and give the other dude who was actually trying to complete objectives the hatch
---
I’m glad someone got the reference in the title. 
---
We should be on the design team fam!
---
If you have an internet connection you can lagswitch in a p2p game. 
---
Yeah, I hope for the hate to die down, because I wouldn't want to have people just dcing all the time so plus because I play my aesthetically and gameplay wise favorite killer.
---
I feel bad knowing that’s you now... sorry I thought it was a rando streamer or something
---
Why monitor and abuse on this build? Can someone help explain?
---
Wait, the Nea was in on it right? 
---
Because if she wasn't that's teaming and banworthy; you and the Dwights would have been working together and ruining the Nea's chance at playing a normal game.
---
I see what you did there. 
---
I’m with ya there, I have a soft spot for Susie just because I’m a cosmetics whore and I like the outfits. But the hate, sometimes isn’t worth it.
---
I like the idea of the chest travel mechanic, brings in a great jumpscare opportunity, there could also be an add-on that makes it to where survivors can't search the chest for a little bit after using it, and if he's hiding in a chest when a survivor opens it then they get injured. 
---
Why so rude though?
---
As with most killers, players simply don't understand how Legion works. Almost every match I play against Legion, the other survivors know it's Legion and still want to work on the same generator with me not realizing he will see that and come over to us. I rarely play against a Legion that doesn't have that perk activated. 
---
When we spread against him, the odds of escaping are much greater. 
---
Personally, I don't mind him at all and after playing against nothing but the Plague this past week. I look forward to seeing him again. 
---
Yes. That is the definition. Don't you realize that you are also one of the people complaining? Don't compare swf to tunneling, they are completely different from eachother 
---
well, yeah, nothing is, Nurse is probably the single-most broken thing in the game
---
If it's gonna be clean, I'd love something like that Tranquility Lane part of Fallout 3, where everything looks perfect and the people are peachy... But instead of a clown, the killer would be some sort of 60's breadwinner housewife equipped with a roller pin as a weapon.
---
Killers can be pretty toxic. On multiple occasions, I’ve had a killer bring a survivor over to another and mori them directly in front of the other survivor. One time too, I’ve had one who slugged me, let me crawl across the map to the hatch, picked me up right before getting the hatch and dropped me next to the hook a few feet away and just continuously let me crawl to the hatch, picking me up and dropping me and then finally hooked when I was about to bleed out. That being said, it doesn’t happen very often. But to say they can’t be toxic is quite a stretch.
---
Pedophilia? Yeesh, I'll probably unsub from his Youtube channel if that's who he really is. Also, I was making a joke but thanks for the 19 downvotes.
---
The post is about survivors doing it and the comment I replied to was asking what it was so I explained it. 
---
Basically, not giving them much attention. Juust enough they fear you
---
*Dwight laughs maniacally*
---
I've always loved simplicity in things, so when legion came out as just a teen with a hoodie a knife and a mask, I was hooked immediately.
---
But you can hide from doctor? It's just a little bit harder, but still not impossible. But his chase isn't much better than any other killer so his tracking ability doesn't matter as much.
---
Legion breaks the chase, they get guaranteed downs. Feral Frenzy can also reveal survivor auras, and he has a smaller terror radius. A legion with monitor and abuse has amazing tracking ability, and breaks chase, and is frankly, annoying.
---
this looks like a meme base
---
Missed opportunity to put Louise as Feng.
---
I think if you wear the TTV symbol you should expect a harder time
---
I aaaaaalmost did, but it's Louise lol
---
People really hate that guy 
---
Breakdown, Deadhard, Dark sense, and Calm spirit.
---
I mean, pug has like 7k subs, probably making $30k+ per month. Doubt he needs extra incentive to play the hell outta this game.
---
Papa Jeff
---
I understand why.
---
Yeah, it’s stupid. They’d rather quit and get nothing than lose and gain something. They could get experience on how to avoid/juke/lose a mixtape Legion (and maybe escape the match), but they’d rather learn nothing and quit.
---
No. A doctor with terror radius perks and addons will have you screaming from halfway across the maps
---
Haha. If only that were actually true.
---
Nope. You're made up rules are the same as mine. Made up and fake, I dont tunnel, nor did I say I did. Because unhooking in my face and me downing them isnt tunneling that's you being stupid.
---
A trapper buff that should be cool would be to not have to pick up a trap to reinstall it. Just offer a "reset the trap" instead.
---
Having all traps in hands is not something, thats way too powerful and break the trapper mecanics... Its part of his gameplay to find trap to think about his map pressure... imagine hooking a survivor and surrounding the hook with all traps you had in hand at start ? Naaaah.
---
Maybe the thing is to find something around the action of putting/taking a trap. Like giving a 5 /10sec speed boost after setting a trap, kind of like a Devour Hope. Or I dont know, after putting 3 traps you got the possibility to sharpen your next trap so it gonna be an insta-down one... Or adding a "trap effectiveness" status, the more you trap sucessfully, the more the entity rewards you with additional buffs...
---
Something interesting and giving more depth in the gameplay... Maybe ?
---
Ugh I stan mein fraulein. 
---
I wil end it.
---
GG on rank 1 for killer and almost rank 1 for survivor! I don't think tunnelling is the issue, as long as the killer isn't camping you then the reason you get tunnelled is because your team mates are shit at rescuing. They're not timing it/pulling it off correctly...That's my controversial opinion which I stick by \*shrug\*
---
oh ok. hope you he figures reddit out and we'll be seeing the both you around more. &lt;3 
---
look at my posts. Then you'll understand
---
that's.. what i said
---
haha yup i did it on purpose 
---
ahhh okay thank you!! 
---
Yeah I'd be pissed if I was sandbagged and the killer let everyone else free. 
---
i’ll definitely give this a watch, thank you! &lt;3 
---
Not hard to figure out what you main lol I get farrrr more bitchy messages from killers than survivors 
---
you completely missed the point. funny that a lot of killer mains are so alike x
---
Sorry if I misunderstand but I don't see how looking past her sickness and at her physical beauty based off genetics is anything meaningful (in a positive or negative way). Like if he was looking at her personality, character, or humanity sure, but thats not whats happening here. 
---
yup. looping: toxic. doing gens = toxic. escaping = toxic. how dare you make the game challenging for me toxic scum
---
Because if you are actually entertaining, people will find, people will tell their friends, and you will rise up. It might not happen overnight, but thats how success in anything works. Im sure if you ask any successful streamer if they started out by putting their twitch in their username, or by posting their link at the end of a game in chat, they would all say no.
---
Yeah. It's prolonging the game for no purpose,
---
Franks Mixtape and Cold Dirt build. It allows Legion to down people in under 20 seconds with absolutely no skill required and no counterplay available for survivors, that's the main reason.
---
As the one Freddy main alive, thank you very much.
---
This tile was created by daddy Dwight ( ͡ ͡° ͜ ʖ ͡ ͡°)
---
Flashlight saves interrupt the 1V1 that occurred wherein the killer won. Add in SWF groups and it's easily toxic.
---
The killer is no longer the aggressor it's the survivors. 
---
Exit gates are powered. Before that, he hooked a Feng when we had a gen to go and just stayed in this position. When we asked why he said, “maybe I should go on Netflix.” Like...ok? 
---
When playing killer, I’ve met a lot of nice survivors who have apologized for being toxic, and it saddens me because they’ve just been skilled players who have been shamed to feel toxic. I always tell them what they’re doing is not toxic and any killer who has labeled them as such are just sore losers who’s sick of their shit getting pushed in, and will call anyone toxic if they get outplayed. 
---
I feel like you would see way too many baby trappers just running hex ruin and then trapping the shit out of it early game. Some of us can power through ruin but if you got unlucky with some that couldn’t that would screw you. 
---
Maybe start with more traps or have them more centrally located might be a better fix.
---
LOL!!! Are you pressed or nah? You're garbage, you should honestly just uninstall the game if you're a killer main and have trouble killing survivors. 
---
This subreddit can be a joke at times. If you say anything they dislike even though it often makes sense they'll downvote. I don't take downvotes seriously regardless. For example, I purposely said "let me guess...killer main?" to see how many people would get mad, it's sitting at over 100 downvotes. ez trigger. I'm willing to bet they all assume I'm a survivor main too, funny.
---
I'd say "grow up" but unfortunately they're a majority here which is sad lol
---
No you're fine and right. I just need more sleep.
---
The stingray was me doing a gen and minding my own business.
---
Welcome to the hell  where we torture people who just wants to enjoy a game
---
I personally don't find t-bagging and emoting toxic at all it's just BM.
---
However holding a game hostage, repeated flashlight saves, x4 DS users are examples of my view of toxic survivors.
---
Que up Killer against a 4-stack and you will find what it means to you.
---
Uh. I'm guessing there was a spelling error here? 
---
I hope you're a monster and use BBQ for even more
---
I play survivor.
---
Except losing the killer is generally more on the killer head due to scratchmarks and bleeding, its why i mentioned that its more on the killer shortcomings then on the survivor. Its not really skill expression, your not really expressing skill, its just showing bad tracking. There is a reason high rank players never really lose people and almost always chose to disengage from the chase.
---
There is literally like 10 different videos explaining exactly how the killer is not a power role, even with the pallet reductions and vacuum changes, good survivors will still always win against a equally good killer, its a bit of a paradoxical problem killer cant really be the power role when a single survivor can literally control the game through looping (and having survivors with the bare minimum knowledge to do generators), but survivors would be proportionately more unfun if they did have to completely rely on their teammates.
---
Bricky and Tyde tend to explain the issues of How killer from a core mechanical standpoint is not the defined powerrole. Despite the fact the video is a bit outdated (Ie Pallets were somewhat reduced and Vacuums removed.). 
---

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB1fLYPme5c&amp;t
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB1fLYPme5c&amp;
---
Ardetha also has a video in regards to it but his is more focusing on the issue of Nerfing Freddy and how easy it is to waste time.
---
This may just be my rounding up post on the matter, we are tending to go back on forth in regards to the looping issues. First step before anything would be to fix gens, change the minigames, making fixing gens as fun as being chased, then extend generator times so that killers have more leeway to work with, so that running one chase wont result in 2 or more gens being completed.
---
I stopped a long time ago.  The point is everything I wrote above.  Stop getting so defensive, child. 
---
Survivors are only toxic because of killers. Period. You’re welcome.

---
YOU’RE NOT MY SUPERVISOR!
---
He’s still there...lol
---
I feel that’s with most multiplayer games that you fight against each other haha. 
---
just need the spiry next ;) 
---
Ok? Just asking for help.
---
Why do people post when they get rank 1? It’s not hard at all I get rank one every season and I mostly don’t even take the game seriously. If they keep things the way they are in the PTB when the update finally drops THEN you can be proud of hitting rank 1.. they are making it way harder to do.
---
I can imagine a super clean, hazmat kind of clothed, psycho bug exterminator with burning bug spray but for spraying the survivors :s
---
You can be the most entertaining streamer in the world, but if you have 0 viewers and the only way for someone to find your stream is to randomly pick your channel out of hundreds of others, you're never going to get big. You can stream for several hours every day for months and never even see a single viewer pop in. The successful streamers in DBD right now have all been playing since the early stages of the game, and their popularity grew with the game.
---
Turning things political for no reason on a gaming subreddit is bad form. Based on the downvotes, you haven't made a good look for your side of things. Oh well :)
---
The point is they don’t know how to play against him ... therefore they hate him. 
---
Get close to them before chase, the whole reason you take it on every killer.
---
thats is an amazing idea
---
i love this
---
Just added her!
---
you give up the whole trial just to tunnel and kill the streamer.
---
Stop
---
love it! thanks!
---
Use that time to record him
---
They probably had to wait a long time for a game and walked away or took a shower. 
---
Already am. This is ridiculous and I refuse to give up my points. Lol mama didn’t raise no bitch 😂
---
Bruh whenever i scroll 😵
---
I managed mine without a mori (more like I used them all trying)
---
What do you mean?
---
&gt;So whenever you just try to take away the fun thing survivors get to use and use the fun thing the killer gets to use it's not fun for one group.
---
So you and the other survivors get to bring items because you find it fun (and the killer doesn't) but the killer doesn't get to bring a way to counter that just because you don't find it fun and the killer does? That's extremely hypocritical and prioritizes survivors' fun over the killer's. 
---
Are the exit gates close? Do you have a chance of escaping?
---
So can we give data just from our end screens? I can start saving them and sending them to you. 
---
Tldr: After one DC and killing me, the Nurse took a shine to the David who was earnestly working through Ruin even though the totem was directly beside him. What followed was some adorable farming where David would not allow the remaining Meg to also die. These crazy bastards finished the last 4 gens with Ruin and Thanataphobia active. Nurse then carried sweet baby David to the hatch and let meg out the door. Post game chat was so sweet &lt;3
---
this subreddit is the only one i care about dont worry 😂
---
Did you remember to report in-game? 
---
You don't seem to understand that my point is that tunneling people off the hook is being an asshole, and you're a dick if you do that
---
Been trying to play clown lately I think he is one of the weakest killers w/o add ons but gets carried really hard by bleach and cigar box, really hard to play him w/o bleach though imo
---
I just automatically assume every group of survivors is gonna give me a bad time so I equip stuff to ROLFstomp them, if it turns out they’re not as good as I expected or just messing about, I’ll ease up. 
---
Ace in the Hole and Technician. 
---
can we include builds as a whole? because i always love the magpie build
---
I love being called a camper when I hook survivor and see 3 other guys just crouching around or when BBQ shows nothing and they already revealed that they do not know how to counter it earlier in the match. Am I supposed to just go for a lone walk and think about my life? 
---
It's sad, because I go out of my way lately to not be a toxic killer, but I still play to win and I get called out for being a tunneler, camper, tryhard, sweaty or whatever else you can imagine really often. 
---
The best non toxic killer from the survivor perspective is the one that does not kill anyone and is blind to survivors mistakes.
---
and then you see "GG EZ baby killer" in post game chat. 
---
&gt;She's beauty, she's grace  
---
&gt;She's gorgeous, she's grace  
---
🤔
---
it's bannable if they are doing it to hold the game hostage(which they seem to be doing) using it to get hits on people trying to leave the basement or to run out a deep wound or RBT timer is fine
---
Refusing to chase and camping the hook sounds like camping to me...

DBD is a chase game and should stay that way.
---
Stealth is heavily punished, generally by giving the killer a free hit for being found, and there are multitudes of information perks to make stealth useless, not to mention Doc and Legion making it impossible to stealth at all.
---
Also, once you are in chase, losing the killer is nigh impossible unless they fuck up horribly.
---
The chase is the most fun part of the game anyway, if DBD was just hide and seek it'd be boring as shit.
---
Trapper main big *dong*
---
Without addons Clown is certainly quite weak. I think the likes of Doctor and Legion are worse without addons but Clown definetly needs addons to be played. For this tier list the subsections are basically "literally does nothing", "bad", "okay", "good"... etc.
---
It's not like Wraith or Nurse who have addons that cause more harm than good, but he does have some dead addons.
---
So what should they do? Run in a straight line and wait for bloodlust? Sounds so exciting and fare. Pallets are there for a reason. Don’t even compare them to noed, it’s completely different.

Yeah nah. It’s been about an hour and the exit gates only powered after he had been doing this for a while. He messaged and said, “watching Netflix. Goodnight.” So yeah. This is ridiculous and kind of mildly annoying now. I don’t know why devs didn’t make it so they can’t do this if it’s against the terms. 
---
There's no downside to it, you get a ton of points to pump into other characters and you drop in rank for more comfortable and less frustrating games. Its so funny having a 24-28k BP's game, and still de-pip.
---
You can also not be a scrub and not use noed, just saying ;).
---
Doing gens, you?
---
*Before heading into a Clown match*
---
I don't think pallets should be removed or any shit like that. I am just saying that both survivors and killers deal with annoying shit. 
---
That was painful to watch
---
You won't get banned, but it is very irritating getting people like this as team mates.
---
A killer with OCD?
---
So from pointing out something that happened to everybody Im salty? You just exposed yourself
---
He doesn't need a major buff, he's not as bad as people here would have you believe. He just needs a few tweaks.
---
Why didn’t she vomit on them?!
---
So I've never played the game, just see stuff that hits r/all. Can the villain player like.....not see them jumping out of a locker two feet to their right? What's the field of view like for them that they don't see that?
---
From your fingers to their ears, here's hoping they do.
---
I would say watch some gameplay of each one of them and see which one looks the most fun to you. 
---
Yeah, I could see a few tweaks being a good solution. 
---
Trap daddy here. 1 and 3 are solid. They should absolutely be implemented. I think trapper should be able to step in his own traps. The rare occasion when he does (even if I’m the one playing) is comical and makes the game that much more interesting. It’s also epic when trappers do that while carrying someone. Again, rare, but adds zest. 
---
Traps should not down instantly. But the time stuck in them before even having the option to struggle free should be 10 seconds or more. I feel I only catch trapped survivors about 60% of the time. I agree survivors struggle free WAY too easily. 
---
Lastly, I think if anything, his movement speed should be buffed. If he just moved a bit faster (3-4%) it could make up for the time he loses setting his traps. It would also give him a better chance of catching a trapped survivor. 
---
Glad I’m not alone on this lol.
---
I always try to be the wholesome team mate who gets hook saves, contributes to gens, savors pallets etc. I feel like a dick for doing that to my team.
---
This literally happened to me yesterday or two days ago. Were you the killer lmao?
---
Sometimes I play matches where I am on gens and rescuing but not caught/seen by the killer. But you won’t find me in the locker of the basement!!!
---
Why did they check some of the lockers twice?
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
why the hell didn't she just poison the lockers? lmao
---
When I first started playing I wouldn't realize the killer was afk and would go running like a maniac everytime I entered the terror radius. (Of course not looking behind myself). Then, out of the terror radius, think, "Phew, good job, I eluded the killer!"
---
Until a fellow survivor began pointing, ushering me to follow, and led me to the obviously afk killer.
---
Depends on the add-ons.
---
On twitch his name is Puppers
---
If you think you NEED to run ruin, you are not a good killer.
---
The killers play in first person so their view is a lot more restricted
---
When I crouch walk though, she finds me, *cause she's coming back, to smack me again becuase I was just saved off the hook!*
---
I get so many salty messages from survivors, and wouldn't you know it. Only the ones I hook/kill do it. If one or two get out, they're fine. But the ones who I get are you "u suck fukin tunneling shit!!!!!" 
---
I tell them I'm playing a violin for them. That, or I just respond with a bunch of hearts.
---
No, no, no, see it's only fair that they play a particular playstyle and everyone has to just bend over and take it with ONLY the counters to that playstyle banned. Don't you know how fun works?
---
A YouTuber by the name of "damnnohtml" made a video about tiles btw, you should check it out 
---
I will draw survivors(eventually)! And no, it was not my first time playing legion. I am a pretty decent one if I say so myself. But my true calling is playing feng(I'm level 50 bloodweb). Thank you again!
---
The new "shut 3 gens down for 2 minutes" perk is going to be so good on setup killers like trapper and hag

&gt; If you think you NEED to run ruin, you are not ~~a good killer.~~ playing billy or nurse.
---
I’m not saying ruin is so good that you’re gonna get spanked without it but if you’re gonna say a killer like trapper or clown doesn’t benefit heavily from having ruin up then I don’t know what to tell you. It either slows gen repair down, forces survivors off gens to get ruin or gets broken immediately anyway but the first two scenarios are huge to actually get momentum swinging your way as an M1 killer who can quickly end chases early game like a billy or nurse 
---
No lol 
---
That's what's lovely about Reddit, however I wish it would change. There are no reprocussions for what we say. What should happen is I'm tracked down and beating to a pulp but weaker people in charge believe in anonymously browsing Reddit. So in that case there's nothing you can do. But you SHOULD be able to amiright. People can't just say horrible things without fear of reprocussions. 
---
I’m not a hardcore gamer, DBD is maybe the only game I play a lot of, but I’m fascinated by how the player base seems to have created a bunch of made up rules you have to follow or else you’re toxic, or a camper, or not playing right, etc.

[How to run an generic tiles as killer] (https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ)

This is bullying
---
I was just browsing the store and saw it
---
That’s not toxic thigh that’s playing the game. 
---
I d/c occasionally when I see I’m playing against a Legion cuz I’m just like— there’s no fun to be had this match. 
---
Ok. 
---
Rank 1 Freddy players are nasty. His kit essentially gives him free BBQ and Deerstalker (aura reading). This allows him to slug when it’s convenient for him. On top of that, he’s guaranteed to slow the game down with his 50% action speed reduction and failed skill checks.
---
It doesn’t end there. The dude is INVISIBLE. Like completely. This negates flashlights, several survivor perks, and survivor stealth tactics. Even if you’re asleep and can see him, he has a foggy dream world, a small physique, and a nice lunge attack. This is Freddy with no perks equipped.. lol
---
I imagine the people begging for a buff are just poor killers in general. He’s fine. Seriously.
---
MERCY BELONGS TO THE LORD!
---
Dude how long do you guys play until you recognize every perk and offering by just looking at it?
---
Can someone fill me in here?
---
You can definitely respond to defend yourself but know when to let it go. You’ll have more fun just moving on to your next match trust me! 
---
Not for her, she can just disease all of them 
---
I was just thinking about that 
---
DBD is currently using version 4.20, and both 4.20 and 4.21 works fine for me. Earlier versions than that does give an error though.
---
Bloody party streamers give 100% bonus blood points for everyone in the lobby and they stack. 
---
the red offering is an ebony mori which allows the killer to kill(Mori) people if they've been hooked. 
---
:]
---
Thats okay Hex ruin spawns in front of a survivor so it gets destroyed 95% of games before the first gen is touched
---
You forgot about Overwhelming Presence. 
---
Also, why the hell should a killer have to deal with instablinds if it's the only item anyone's ever gonna use given those rules?
---
Fantastic. I'm sold. Giving them the option of using the key on the golden chest or the hatch is a great idea too. The more I think about it, the more I love it. Really good idea. I wish the Devs read this thread.
---
You like it?
---
man she really is the definition of "pretty from a distance"
---
I zoomed in to look at her and instantly felt nauseated from all that pus....
---
They really need to work on hex placement - you dont even need to try memorise where they spawn on most maps because they are so obvious and almost always in the open
---
Pretty sure they added it purely so killers arent forced to use Hex ruin to give themselves a small chance of winning at higher ranks
---
Good point.
---
A proper sabo squad is incredibly rare but a fucking nightmare to be against. No matter where you are, you get a down and any hook you go to breaks in your face. It's not like flashlight saves where they have to be right on top of you to pull it off either. It's just like being DSed on every single pickup.
---
What the heck?! Why are there so many lockers?!
---
OMG this is so brilliant love it
---
Crazy that the huntress model file is now so obese that this is a thing!!
---
On the other hand this is why she always gets stuck on corners and sniped by pallets
---
Wooow. That was crazy. I wish I was half as good as you!
---
Just watched some TruTalent and he was talking about how that was what was rumored among the changes for Plague. I heard it somewhere else on this subreddit too I think. Either way, IF it is true, I seriously hope they don’t do that. 
---
"Alexa, play what's new scooby doo by smash mouth"
---
#I THINK WE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR
---
It happens on both sides. Imho toxic is when players explicitly do something to taunt the someone else a number of times in a trial. 
---
For survivors that means teabagging, emoting and flashlight spam during chases or from a safe distance (like exit gates).
---
Looping, SWF, body blocking, flashlights, any perk combo (yes even DS) and hook sabbing are all valid game strategies, regardless of how annoying they can be and I would not consider them toxic at all.
---
Same with killer. Any build (including NOED and Mori's), close patrolling, picking off weak or careless survivors and dribbling to the hook are valid plays. Activites like repeated hitting on the hook, facecamping, camping slugged survivors to cause a bleed out or taunting survivors with the hatch before hooking would all fall into the toxic category for me.
---
Killer Be Killed.
---
Diversion, definitely. IT'S PEBBLE TIME BOIS
---
A bit shocked if other streamers are like this when I stream I tell my squad welcome to the stream without dropping my name and it’s not my username either and I play to win and help my team I never even considered playing these other ways sooo thanks for the idea 😈

Heheheh totally thought about that heheheh._.

The killer has super good add - ons tho so its kind of a counter.
---
Did you read my whole thing? Did the people who upvote it read the whole thing?
---
A legion that does not moonwalk or look down with THAT????? Completely bamboozled me. It was actually fun match though so I'm not complaining.
---
Or neither lol
---
we didnt bring insta blinds btw and we usually don't but  I think it's perfectly balanced because it's not that hard to avoid without franklins or lightborn
---
Image deleted
---
*What’s up with that?*
---
Admittedly thats all he can do without a mori and the best addons for insta-chainsaw
---
LF only purpose is to give us awesome perks to use on the killers who have useful abilities
---
without the best addons hes just a slow guy who stuns/ultra-slows himself when he charges his ability to destroy pallets
---
Explain report?
---
The numbers are increased, that's all. Thanosphobia at Tier 3 adds up to -24% action speed if all survivors are injured. It's like Dying Light now but better.
---
You don't fix what isn't broken.
---
overwheling presence isnt that bad and the killer should follow the rules since I believe that the 
---
killer addons = fun and good
---
survivor flashlight = fun and good
---
but if a killer has franklins its no fun for survivors and the killer just ruins enjoyment for survivors
---
Damn didn't know we had people using politics as an insult when this doesn't involve it at all on the sub being a prick
---
I dont know why but as the killer carrying the final survivor the hatch is infinitely more enjoyable than just winning
---
Its pretty broken.
---
Just another toxic, loser, player, right up there with the facecamping scum I run into all the time on PS4, it’s been bad lately with campers and now you have assholes doing this basement blocking bs! I report the basement blocking but since it’s console I doubt anything will happen with them! The devs are full of bs on the banning crap, if that were the case allot of the trash on here would be gone, I’ve run back into the same asshole killers multiple times, and they are still doing the same bs like this! 
---
Yep. Pedophilia, witch-hunting, cheating in-game, ban evasion...
---
This sounds like a shitty Discord to be apart of. I'm glad I don't associate with any of you.
---
Or even worse, it's some guy that has a facecam but never talks unless they're pissed. They occasionally lean in super close to the facecam when they swing at a survivor, and it's so awkward.
---
Yeah it gets worse lol i had it as a rank 15 killer facing a SWF of ranks 3-5. everyone had the best toolboxes or flashlights witht he best addons, DS, etc it was pretty un-fun when i was just trying to do my stupid leather face daily and had to put up with the instant gen rush, constantly being blinded and t-bagging in the gate by trolls.
---
On the plus side i did kill the one guy with [T.tv](https://T.tv) in his name
---
r/whoosh
---
Very nice, thank you!
---
r/whoosh 
---
Yeah that is helpful, thanks.
---
I'm guessing you asking to know all the perks own via teachables/shrine of secrets. Other than viewing the killer themselves for the checked mark(this means you've unlocked it for all killers) this will not be possible with killers you don't own (I mean checking teachable perks). I have a main killer so every teachable I unlock on another killer I immediately spend bp to have it on my main so that's how many perks I know I have.
---
How is it broken?
---
Russian Mama!!🥰
---
She's good, I hope don't Nerf her like Freddy and forever fuckin broken
---
I always find it hilarious that no matter what tier lost Myers is always in the exact middle of it
---
Also I would switch Spirit and Huntress, i think the Hag is given waaaay more credit than she needs, I like this list! 
---
Borrowed time wont work if you cant unhook them to begin with. He wouldn't let anyone get in.
---
I’ve seen it only somewhat countered by nurse on a stream once. She just kept dragging them towards the basement and re-caught them fast enough each time they wiggled off. I forgot how the game ended up.
---
You're all good, don't worry :)
---
https://youtu.be/MK6TXMsvgQg Do the Benny Hill Theme instead. Much better  
---
They would have to change other things about her powers otherwise she’s just gonna be a scuffed huntress. Wouldn’t surprise me if they change anything with the amount of garbage they’ve put on the table lately.
---
Feels like they have 1 dev on the entire team working on everything.
---
What
---
yeah. Rank 20-16 games takes ages to find. I used to wait a good 7-10 minutes before the first survivor joins. you just need to be patient and remember the wait times will get better
---
Legion that does not moonwalk or look down with THAT?? Completly bamboozled me. But I had very fun match so I am not complaining.
---
I got hatch, i survived. My 1 friend in the swf survived with me but he died so i could get hatch.
---
This was reddit worthy.
---
Forget literally everything you know about playing any other killer. You essentially have to re-learn how to play the game. Nurse is different. Thats what makes her the hardest and thats what makes her the best. Lots of mind games with survivors, predicting and knowing their every move to counter with the correct blink. Tons and tons and tons of practice. Nurse isnt a killer you pick up at rank 4, and expect to get to rank 1 with instantly. You're going to try and fail a lot.  
---
I'm not saying the perk can't be fun/have meme potential with friends. I'm just saying it's pretty weak and could use a buff.
---
I’m still tweaking it, but this is coming from a console player so maybe that’s why people are complaining about Huntress’s spot. 
---
Was he in the basement?
---
Yup
---
I need matches to help me get to rank 15. And I need rank 15 to get matches.
---
It's a vicious cycle.
---
Exactly 
---
I quite often find myself unintentionally running the killer to other survivors, unless you gave me a reason not to do so I will do everything in my power to keep the killers attention on me.
---
You should feel dirty &gt;-&gt; DS and adrenaline 
---
the best campers are the ones who don't realise you're in a swf and run insidious and then complain post game that no one saved anyone from hooks. too easy to gen rush their asses
---
Eat my fuck bitch
---
Jesus
---
Ok chill I don't even play the game 
---
[removed]
---
&gt;a nice lunge attack
---
Freddy has the basic killer lunge range. It only seems longer because the lunge is a bit ahead of his claws, to match the length of other killers' lunges. 
---
Y tho
---
Yeah they said her foot was like black I beleive, since im assuming that was the starting point of the plagues infection. Ya think her foot would be the messiest part? Oh well its no biggy lol
---
*has T.TV in my name when I stream*
---
Oof.
---
Then I don't know what to tell you. That's entirely his ball court. A coordinated save would be best because he'd have to down the first person going for the save and then when he's picking up that person, another can go down and go for the save. If there's no coordination then it's fubar.
---
Freddy would be fine on his own if there wasn't so many damn bugs and ways for survivors to abuse how his power works. Fix that, and give him something for the chase, and he'd be fine.
---
I think she’ll be my new main cause I like her thematically but I do think she seems a little too strong right now.
---
I think a good nerf would be making it to where the vomit would give you the speed boost from a hit. If aimed properly you could still get off two hits. Just an idea. I would like for her chanting aura to always be on and maybe a grey add on removed it for those that didn’t like it?
---
Stupid. It's called stupid. 
---
you will definitely learn as you go 
---
oh shit yeah, don't get me wrong it's painful. just remember early green ranks are the best balance between good and bad survivors
---
I'm already rank 1. I just got my first 4 kills. But those guys were struggling. I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to save my blinks and not lose distance as bad with her?
---
He was not running insidious, he just decided to be a dick. He was running bbq; ruin; noed; blood warden;
---
Yes he’s a trash killer. To be even remotely viable in red ranks, you need to have stacked perks and add ons. He’s the most disrespected killer by far. People literally do gens in his face. It takes 7 seconds by default just to be able to attack. His power is to literally let him attack a survivor.
---
Any decent killer can play a good freddy game. I’ve had plenty of 4K at rank 1. I’ve also been completely shit on many times. Anyone who tells you Freddy is decent hasn’t played the game long enough to understand how shitty is mechanics are.
---
*consuela enters the chat*
---
*consuela is typing...*
---
as a killer i frown upon camping but simply searching nearby for a little bit and finding a survivor is not camping. (not saying he wasn't camping I wasn't in your game so i couldn't tell)
---
I mean I do ok, but I want to be at a level where I can fight off toxic survivors. I just find myself getting the blink penalty a lot. I also lose distance against the aurvi iors. I'm looking to close that gap. I'm ok with blinking, its just the distance I lose because she is slow as hell. I just played rank 1 and got 4 kills. But I'm not sure those guys were try hard either. 
---
#Show me Rank 1 Freddy 4K, then you may have my permission to Die. 
---
I just want to be able to hit them when its time. I lose distance with them because of her speed. But when I've caught up, I'm decent at hitting blinks shots. 
---
It was only me and 1 other with the other dcing and us not running borrowed because me and him usually run the killer and never get caught
---
The idea isn't to make it have no cooldown, it's to make it so you can use it while having an exhaustion perk and give Head On a normal cooldown like Quick and quiet has.
---
Prayer beads 
---
Gimme that ass
---
if you’re rank 1 you should know the answer to that question. 
---
How are you gonna close distance without blinking? 
---
Oh that’s STFUAMQB
---
Jesus fuck, you can just tell this dude is like 12 and is recounting his favourite Fortnite streamer's "advice". 
---
In kill your friends they are locked now too, you can see them in the item section but can’t use them and say locked... 
---
Yeah I agree with you 100% I don’t like reduced movement speed.
---
a
---
Wait how do you this, I’m tryna play during school
---
Any new killer should not be nerfed unless they become stronger than the nurse is already...
---
What’s wrong with having more strong killers? You don’t need to nerf them. 
---
Hillbilly, nurse, spirit... should they be nerfed? Hell no, In fact, the other killers should get buffs to make them to par
---
However, especially new killers, they don’t need to always be low-mid tier killers... why can’t they be strong? 
---
What do other killers have in their abilities that give them chase power? I’m not counting perks because Freddy can have those perks through shine of secrets or teachables.
---
I'm pretty sure it's A. Say that just based on personal experiences with the Perk- generally when I run it me and my friends can all yeet off hooks much easier. So I'm going to assume it's the higher percentage.
---
I once ratted out my entire team to a Doctor because they did a three man gen without me after they didn’t teabag with me since we spawned together.
---
I have never had that mori type. Only yellow green and purple. 
---
My friend does that.... way too much. 
---
Now your just making sh*t up. 
---
The Killer’s FOV is small but it definitely seems like there might be some shenanigans going on here. Yes, maybe this is really low rank and the Killer just doesn’t have very good awareness, but I don’t see how you could rush leave a Locker multiple times and not have the Killer notice. They can hear that, so why wouldn’t they at least do a quick 360 turn to check out their surroundings instead of just opening a Locker and going straight to the next one and opening that and so on.
---
I don't have ttv in my name and still get 0 viewers :)
---
I'm essentially saying hard work pays off, and those who deserve success will recieve it. The fact that you don't think thats true kind of blows my mind.
---
Or when he randomly replies to one of your comments and you think you have a connection. 
---
Had a T.TV Claudette call me a tunneler when I hooked her, walked away, noticed that she got unhooked, and saw her obvious ass but not her rescuer. So I put her on to hook 2 and don’t knock her down again for like 7 minutes. I 2 or 3 hooked just about everyone that game and last guy got hatch. 
---
Not if he has add ons that make it faster. And I was hooked by the closed gate. It was only opened after Dwight unhooked me and I was instantly put back to sleep. 
---
New offering: 
---
I will take 1 color from each different rank, a request to the entity for this match. Won’t stack. 
---
What I find funny about these TTV survivors is I've had some try to claim I was stream sniping them. Like first of all, I got zero interest in your stream while I am playing and secondly if you despise stream sniping don't make it easy for people to do.
---
I swear, 90% of friendlys are Myers or the Pig
---
Those angry eyebrows are funnier than the actual joke.  I’m upvoting just for that.
---
Curious, what platform are you playing on? My sister and I play and her games have crashed randomly at least twice each week (we only play weekends). I have seen some people legitimately DC (rage quit when they get downed, etc.), but I wonder if some of those are just the games. We play on ps4, if that matters at all.
---
I'm my opinion it just has to do with more of the moment things , for example I myself always disconnect against legion .... Also I'll disconnect if the connection is far to laggy to enjoy the game ( PS4 PLAYer ) I'm rank 2 so I've seen it all ...but that's just my opinions ...only way I'll disconnect ...Also killers seem to disconnect way more at the ranks I'm at for reasons far dummer than survivor 
---
It's not deceptive, just treat it like the basic lunge range. 
---
&gt;The Trapper is mid tier
---
In fantasy land. 
---
She could have just puke on lockers to check if anyone was in them.
---
I mean, fuck you for your perks, but JESUS HUNTRESS, BREAK THE FUCKIN PALLET YOU MOOK!
---
checked again in the files cant find any masking textures .. Need to check that in game. you can also see her toe even though cloth covers it u can see all 5 digits..
---
90% of killers are below average and it’s the same with survivors. I’ve even seen survivors with little or no composure and inability to navigate the map and adapt to suit a killers play style at survivor rank 1. It literally goes for nothing. The best players recognize each other within minutes of a game starting. Too many people panic and play like their life depends on it and it shows at all levels of play.
---
Are we playing the same game because DBD has one of the worst communities if you want civility...
---
You’re right, good points!
---
I was just thinking about the solo survivor running this perk.
---
I'm sorry for your experience. As a killer main, it happens quite frequently.  If you need to, you can disable the messages and invites I believe.
---
It’s got to the stage that when you find ruin isn’t being run that’s when you think ahhh shit
---
Yeah as solo survivor it's best to not touch the perk unless you want to hope you or your team mates have good luck.
---
May be he is trying to unlock mask by face camping :P
---
You aren't wrong, but can you change the world? Most likely no. But can you change yourself to see if that works for you? Yes. You can't make people click on your stream and enjoy themselves when you are a boring and unoriginal person, but you can try to change something about your stream to see if that works better for you.

We were all playing survs that didnt give you masks except the p3 dc claudette
---
Meh, Id put her with trapper. Sickness doesnt do enough, you have to go out of your way to get corrupt purge and insta heals on fountains are broken. 
---
I am so sick and tired of people thinking when a hunter has noed they have the right to be toxic  To the killer.
---
Dwight's homeland
---
MY experience playing , survivors seem to just disconnect with the Blanton tunneling ect ...long as I pip I don't care if I die or not it's part of the game ...but when a killer is clearly bad and needs to camp or tunnel and call it " strategy " it's lame not fun ..... Killer's on the other hand seem to always disconnect when they keep losing chases , or that one person they camped get away .. pretty sad ... moral of the story stay at your rank lol survivors my not be that smart ...but Killer's are fun to play against ...rank 4 and down lol once ina blue 
---
You may not understand how small the chances are that someone will click your channel in the first place. Anyway have a nice life i guess.
---
i just straight up blocked him. just thank god the others weren’t spamming me too or i would’ve actually screamed
---
I agree. Don’t be mad at noed there are only 5 totems in a game. Just find the darn things while looking for gens. I open boxes just to get them open too even if I have a good item. 
---
If your team sucks at that and get one hit in the exit gate being cocky that’s their problem. 
---
Totems man, they can make or break the game. 
---
Just cleanse them anyway. Plus you get points. 
---
I had someone message me for basement camping with insidious and bubba. 
---
My reply was along the lines of
---
Are you telling me not to use a perk the way it was specifically designed to be used? 
---
I’ve tried that. It gets tilted a lot. But are you talking about like an actual pull out table or one to drape over?
---
Plus I am more comfortable with a controller. I do it for both surv and killer. I like it more than mouse and keyboard even without back issues. 
---
I just want advice. 
---
Thank you. 
---
No, just because someone is running ruin does not mean they are bad at the game. It is a counter to gen rushing survivors and it helps slow the game down. There is a meta in nearly every game also, there will always be perks that are better than others.
---
Blame the devs for deciding that perks should be bandaid fixes to problems with game design. That and certain perks have synergy with specific Killers. It just makes sense to run BBQ on Billy/Nurse because they have the map control to take advantage of it. 
---
Killers run Ruin because it's the only thing they have that can slow down Survivors. It has a million down sides to it as well. The OP's attitude just reaffirms why most Killers stick to top tier. 
---
you are probably fun at parties
---
Yeah, those types of players suck. Happy hunting!
---
They get a ping every time the survivor enters or exits quickly, but the killer's FOV is too tight to see anything but the inside of the locker while checking one. That's why she stuck around so long, she knew there was a survivor because she kept getting pings, but couldn't find them because the survivor was slowly entering so if they didn't see them enter it's just a guessing game of which locker is she in now?
---
hoooooly shit i was thinking this earlier, its always the same killers as well. it becomes so tiresome 
---
I don’t know what “losing too much distance” means. 
---
the attention to detail is incredible. beautiful work.
---
You get a upvote because you are right people will complain anyway. Especially over something stupid.  Your sarcasm is respected. 
---
This guy is just low-key complaining about ruin lmao
---
maybe he just wanted to play with you :c
---
That was the little funny in my rant,  nice catch. 
---
What does that have to do with what he said at all 
---
You don't technically ever require a perk. A perk like ruin just helps the killer a lot. 
---
You can actually be entertaining and then share vods or clips on forums like here on reddit. That way it will actually give people an introduction to your content before directing them to your channel. Having ttv in your name is like trying to be a popup ad, it won't make people stick around.
---
Basically lol
---
Puke on until broken then hit them down. As survivor you don't get the injury boost.
---
Speculate? aren’t you tired of the same thing over and over? Make another perk that slows the game down... add a bit of variety 
---
Spamming people with around 25 invites does not usually mean they want to play with you.
---
Also: Calm Doctor and Coxcombed Clapper/Ghost Wraith get participation ribbons for this meme
---
I do like variety, but I always expect similar perks always being ran. It is quite rare to not see certain perks on survivors and killers such as ruin, ds, Sprint burst, and adrenaline.
---
*as a killer main* sometimes you just really don’t like someone, how they play, how they loop, or if they are just toxic, I don’t do it very much at all but when I do, it’s because I want to ruin that very survivors day, just. An eye for an eye, they ruined your game, you ruin there game, most of the time, *since I’ve already got rank 1 and don’t care about rank* I give the last person hatch, either because people dced, and I want to give them something for not dcing, or they genuinely made me laugh, or it was a good chase, at least that’s what I do. 
---
God this made me anxious
---
Because the monster wouldn't see them going in the lockers
---
It might be a problem with your game files. I'm not very well versed in computers, but you might have to reset your computer without the DbyD files (or just reset your PC if you are okay with it)

 When are we getting her

That's 9:16, not 16:9.

---
Obviously. That's a completely different point than he's talking about,  which you can CLEARLY tell. He is most likely talking about a killer who downs someone while having multiple gens left,  hence him saying you could get them all done? Killer mains favorite thing to say is "what was I supposed to do?" Um,  go after someone else. Also there is NO way without BBQ and Chilli killers just assume someone is near for a unhooking,  that's as well one of my favorite excuses. Nice try. I assume they are trash at the game if they camp,  it's annoying. After it happens to me multiple times,  I'll DC and loses 2 pips instead of the 1 I'd lose during them camping. 
---
And that is strike 3 for these devs. Their games out 
---
Explain
---
Basically if they have sprint burst or something like it, they take off and I lose the while chase because she can't catch up. At that point it's a 50% guessing game in the direction they went. I'm trying to keep the gap at a closer distance. 
---
That is completely different and would require huge changes compared to just simply nerfing a perk.
---
You could miss it because that is a possibility 
---
It is broken because it let's the survivors have a second chance and loop the killer for another long amount of time.
---
Would that 5K BP even matter?
---
Can’t be assed because I’m sure everyone else has already explained and I’m tired because it’s 4:00 AM, so here’s [a post explaining it ](https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1483235412203579810/) 
---
But no hag 😞
---
It’s still Freddy though so the only reason you even got off the hook was because it was Freddy if it was any other killer they would have stopped the unhook
---
Enduring certainly isn't a counterplay, it just softens one of the effects.
---
What's wrong with a second chance
---
More like to loo up with the new survivor for the thiccness 
---
Fair enough
---
It just helps the survivor a ton due to giving your other friendly survivors more time to get gens done.
---
The first blink is for distance. 
---
The second blink is for accuracy. 
---
It’s better to be blinking and miss than walking/not blinking. 
---
Okay honestly this killer is stupid as fuck
---
Enduring is not a counter to DS. 
---
It’s that simple. 
---
Then why dont killers just not bother with one person who is clearly bait and go after the ones who are getting stuff done
---
r/dadbydaylight 
---
Oh wait, I’ve already put it here a few months ago.
---
Thank you for that useless input to this thread.
---
As a Dwight main, I aspire to have this level of power with lockers...
---
It's a slight counter but I dont see the way there nerfing it to be an effective strategy 
---
Then the same thing happens with the other survivors, but without the ds part. If you just rub away from that survivor the whole time, then you likely aren't going to win the game.
---
Made it to red ranks for the first time! Woohoo!
---
Well if you hook twice and then kill you get a little more than just hooking the final time. :)
---
Anything that makes the survivor use exhaust on hit. It really messes with their game plan on how to loop you. 
---
I really can’t tell if you’re trolling with your overall post. 
---
Ignore that guy who doesn't know what he's talking about. The unfortunate truth is that a lot of people would buy views and follows to get attention, then phase out the bots as actual people started watching them. It's not hard to do, it just takes time and money. 
---
Thanks for your useles input on my useless input.

God i love this. Only topped off by perma t1 meyers + the game offering.

Anxiety
---
???? Why would you wanna get less points just to use an item that shows a boring animation you've already seen a hundred times?
---
Billy is Overrated, but she isn’t better than Nurse. 
---
If that happens I immediately assume I'm escaping by the hatch. Let the shit show go on, all I need is 2 gens.
---
Do you get sick if she vomits on the one you're in?
---
There might be more dbd players near that airbnb so the Killer was closer to you so you had a better ping
---
Lol in the end they wasted their time to be shitty.
---
The other day I ended up in a few matches with this same guy and afterwards he sent me a friend request that I didn’t see until 2 days later. I accepted it then the next day he sends me a message “you’re trash at DbD lol”.
---
Like? Who has the time?
---
Someone had to say it
---
Knock out. 
---
Hag or Spirit are both very strong killers, with pretty good perks, especially the Hag. I would pick between them. The new killer is kinda cool, but i think she is weaker than either of these two, and her perks aren't stand out good.
---
I believe this is called identity V
---
I'm really new to playing killer and I got my first 4k yesterday!

Lol the Mori could be aggressively scrubbing their faces off with a sponge. No but this is a good idea

If you are American take legal actions against the dev's - get ez moneys /s

No identity v looks different

How do you do this?

Somebody trying to 360 me and failing. Or somebody trying that dumb window trick where I vault a window and abusing my FOV by getting right behind me and trying to go back over it so I don't see them, but then they realize I have Bamboozle. I love turning around and seeing the survivor moving back and forth a little bit, trying to vault the window in vain.
---
I played a game today where two ppl disconnected after being downed in the first 2-3 minutes or so. Then, a third person got hooked, tried to unhook and just gave up on survival. Can you give me 20 secs to get over there - before quitting? So impatient.
---
This is how you summon Nea-lzelbub. 
---
When you hit a cross map hatchet toss and hear the squishy sound. 
---
So taking the penalty is worth it? I thought it was longer the more tou charge and the more blinks you do?
---
Lol, same thing happened to me a couple weeks ago. But his viewers were calling him on it lmao. Good to know all twitch viewers arent just there to echo the streamer.
---
I get the feeling that the Legion was at one point a super ambitious killer that turned out to be too complex or just didn't work out for the game so had to be scrapped, but they didn't have enough time to go back to the drawing board. What we got was just some last minute idea that got slapped on so they could push it out the door.
---
Based on the teaser trailer, the name of the chapter and the design of the killer, I get the feeling that it was supposed to have a disguise based ability, like a Team Fortress 2 Spy, but they wouldn't be able to do literally anything if the survivors had any kind of communication, which is why it was eventually scrapped late into development.
---
i play rank 1 and it depends from killer to killer. the way i see it theres two different killers. one is only rank 1 because they grinded and used boosted killers like billy, leatherface, etc. or two, the actually skilled killer, who is good no matter what killer they use. i suck at nurse, but i still get 1-2 kills with her simply off of strats and tactics i use with every killer (i.e. moonwalking, mindgames etc.) so depending on who you get freddy is good. that being said, he does need a buff because the amount of people that are skilled enough to play him, or have the time to get his good addons is SEVERELY outweighed by the vast majority of the community that cant learn how to play him because of his HUGE learning curve, which would be straightened out by a buff :D
---
"Don't promote yourself in an environment where people may be interested, instead, realise you don't have many viewers, do nothing, and give up!"
---
Boy, you should work in advertising.
---
The goal isn’t to fatigue. You can blink twice before auto fatigue. 
---
You close distance with the first blink, then try to get the accuracy with the second blink and if you can’t hit, don’t swing. 
---
When the killer swings, and smacks the hell out of something. The noise it makes gets me every time and I love it when the Hag hits something metal. You know that shit had to hurt. On Killer perspective, it's really hilarious when you're chasing someone and they think they have the skills, and then they run into a wall and it's just a moment of "gotcha bitch". 
---
If people are urban evading around the map then that’s a huge waste of time. They also can’t urban evade at a trapped loop. I’d say urban evasion hurst hag less than calm spirit hurst doctor.
---
sloppy butcher lol, such a pain in the ass for survs
---
no
---
Twas just a joke m8

When they started a cult, like crouching, nodding and circling a barrel of fire

"We already have to pay John Carpenter to follow The Shape everywhere"
---
*cutaway to exactly that*
---
Oh you use spectrum too? It blows I hate it
---
Oh. Jokes fall flat to me lol
---
Nope they shouldn't be able to actually, it breeds toxicity more and more. People should be found and face consequences for what they say, just like irl. If you say some rude, racist hateful shit to someone you get your face smashed in, like you deserve. Same goes for online. 
---
Fair enough, I’m still somewhat new and thought hag was the most OP until I figured out survivors can just crouch by them or burn them lol
---
Would it be too much to ask for a legion?
---
Ok. That helps me a lot. Thanks for that tip man. 
---
it depends on the kiler tbh. theres definetely a fine line and i think alot of people will agree w me here. theres skilled, like flashlight saves and pallet looping, and then theres toxic like tbagging after EVERY pallet drop, or bullying low ranked killers by depipping. you just gotta ride the line. its okay to tunnel if youre having a rough game, or flashlight save the dwight that got caught in a locker, but it is NEVER okay to tbag a rank 20 after a pallet stun
---
Yeah, the second blink matters just as much as the first one once you realize what each of them are designed to do. 
---
head on will change things hehe

When hair rubberbands across the map.

When you and another player from your SWF (I never do this when I'm solo) are getting chase and you throw down a pallet...trapping your friend with the Killer.

The "Hi!!" T-bag survivors do when we see each other at the beginning of the match.

Definitely gonna be easier, and guess I don’t have to get good with the nurse rn then since I think I have an ebony mori and thanks for that, thought that once I hit the notification it will notify the person once I replied. 
---
I would assume it would be like the opposite of spirit when phase walking, I assume it might be a false terror radius that does not have any association with any of your perks (i.e coulrophobia, unnerving, overwhelming) and it likely would not increase madness. but thats just a guess. also it probably does work for freddy
---
Technician, is called technician since you have more chance of hitting great skill checks since if u missed one the explosion might not proc or is it because feng min is asian?

Don't you know the majority on this sub expect the killer to do anything but try to kill them?
---
Scrubs are the majority, and that is why youre downvote bombed for saying something that imples they should have to try to win.
---
Because survivors are usually entitled bitches who don't like to lose.
---
Like i said, scrub majority on this sub. They dont wanna use the tools given to win, and expect you to do the same.
---
haha that's adorable, I love that the killer defended your honor in a way...after he killed you XD
---
Yeah, using the tools provided to win is being a scrub. People too oblivious to find totems arent just bad or anything, and thats not the correct choice....
---
This is why I never play without headphones.
---
Then don't play it?
---
I was probably stalking someone really good and they didnt know,
---
Tonight I was called 'retard' and 'camper' repeatedly for being near the hook when the only other survivor was right next to it. When I asked them to explain why I should leave when I know the other survivor is there, they just spammed 'drink bleach'.
---
Sick
---
I'm surprised if playtesting is something they do
---
You sound like Dwight Shrute.
---
Dude this faggot literally goes around this entire sub crying and moaning toward anyone who doesn't sit around and play EZ mode survivor all day haha. He's so fucking triggered that hes raging out on Reddit over a video game LOL.
---
Booooooring
---
The
---
Couldn't the plague just vomit on all of the lockers?
---
Looping is extremely toxic
---
Sure
---
Well we pretty much have Gacy
---
WikiHow I'd hazard a guess at
---
Yeah, I'll give you that the killer has options. I guess when I play as survivor, if a killer is camping me, it doesn't really make me any more salty if he is hitting me or nodding while he does it. So it all just kind of registers as camping to me. But I could see it being extra toxic to do so. 
---
And yeah, I think your second point really hit on what I was getting at. I think it just feels worse to deal with toxic survivors as the killer than it does to deal with toxic killers as the survivor. The former is people making fun of you for being bad and the latter is people making your game less fun/playable. Both are bad, but the former just stings a bit more, you know? 
---
So I think I may have perceived "is more annoying when it happens" as "happens more often" which is wrong.
---
The "happens more often" is definitely just because of the 4:1 ratio. Well said.
---
Mecha-hitler
---
Holy shish! autodidact time! 
---
Fucking bet
---
Freddy can be very strong in the right hands. However, 7 seconds just to attack a survivor is way too long. I say change a couple things about him and it will be good, no massive buffs needed.
---
All I could think of was every time I’ve ever stepped into my own trap. (P3) 
---
Except adam was the first person he saw to get into tier 2, then he looked at me for a second before i sprint bursted away. It’s possible he looked at Laurie and Adam some more, but Nea was on the other side of the map doing a totem. Is that all really enough for infinite tier 3 only 1 minute into the game?
---
Personally I always thought when a killer hooks you and keeps hitting you is toxic af...like its just so unnecessary? It's equivalent to a survivor t-bagging
---
Thanks for the input 
---
Poor plague xD
---
Nowadays devs are so scared of making killers scary because of all the backlash they'll get from survivors who just want an easy to loop punchingbag of a killer.
---
In the instances you describe though if a killer acts that way it is detrimental to them winning. Like freddy throwing a game to kill one survivor or pig following one to make sure they die. They are applying 0 pressure and are just ensuriing the death of one person. On the other hand survivors can be toxic in ways that are not detrimental to securing their win.
---
It does, they're one of the few killers who can use it properly. 
---
Yeah 100% this, maybe second hook depending on if they are really good at looping and might end up being a problem later on. Depends on how the game is going but I’d probably start using it by the time they get around 4 gens done. 
---
Idea sounds boring imo. At least hatch keeps the game going and not just croych in the corner for a minute
---
I'm my time playing, I have gained a sense for when survivors are about to save. I immediately head back when I get that feeling. It is rarely wrong.
---
Don’t need NOED if they all die early. Ezpz 
---
Alright, Ill try to give that a go, thanks for the help
---
 alright chief, imma head out
---
But have you ever seen 2 people run into the exact same trap in the same min trying to save?
---
500 for me, I loved it, got some great times outta it, still sad to see it go though.
---
Getting in or out fast both do ping unless you have Quick and Quiet (which she didn't)
---
I know your perception as killer is wonky at times, but wowie. That's just...yeah. XD
---
I believe you only get sick if you exit or enter an infected one.
---
we all trash talk this stupid fucking game because despite it being pretty fucking stupid we love it and want to see it reach its full potential.
---
I never understood the boring as fuck, I found them super fun, I will admit it's not too fun getting moonwalked by a legion but that's more the games chase mechanic design and less on legion.
---
They didn’t have a lan cable and I left mine at home. 
---
But why 
---
Jack the ripper. I'd go around and only kill females keeping it true to the stories.
---
According to devs and patch notes, ALL terror radius effects apply to the new terror radius.  It's not a false TR, simply a relocated one. 
---
I've recently been thinking it would be nice if an injured survivor who stepped in a trap got an additional consequence, like having the Deep Wound applied and requiring them to mend.
---
I mean the survivor is going in the same time the killer is checking the locker, making it harder to hear, and it’s not clear where the sound is coming from 
---
She's fine imo.
---
Pebble.
---
As long as the “vomit effect” is active, you don’t get sick until you come out of the locker.
---
I doubt the disguise bit.  That's something they've always tried to stay away from.  Of course, it's BHVR, so it's not like that means much (clown, Plague for example).  Then again, those two were not supposed to happen due to not wanting to be offensive towards players, whereas the "survivor disguise" has always been turned down for mechanical reasons (ineffective vs anyone is swf, too effective vs just random). 
---
Because usually these kind of players tend to t-bag, flashlight click spam, be full swf all equiped with annoying perks not to win but just to be annyoing, if you hook them by 3 time they dc before, they exploit infinites, etc etc etc.
---
Are they skilled? Yes.
---
Is that attitude toxic? Yes for sure.
---
Do they deserve to die for massively disrespecting the killer? Yes they do.
---
Turns out PreSchool is the 5th Best Killer Map and Haddonfield is the 5th Best Survivor Map.  However, 5th Best Survivor Map still is actually still Killer Friendly with Survivors having less than a 40% Escape Rate on it.

This looks like something definitely on your end.  Your ping stays bouncing between yellow and red.  There's also a history of keyboard/mouse control apps causing issues in games from time to time (I've got lgs also, but no profile loading on dbd).  I'd first try shutting off lgs and any anti-virus.  If that does nothing, flush your DNS.  Try using a different set of dns servers.  If all else fails, try reinstalling dbd.  Also check your firewall and make sure the recommended steam ports are open.  Also, try running it with ALL your extra programs shut down and see if it works better.  Sometimes the timing with an event or whatever is coincidence.  Sometimes a patch will break a compatibility. 
---
This assumes players are capable of being polite.

Do you have it as a more solid white without the greys? This looks like a really good icon

*Happiness Noise*

Head on, Quick &amp; Quiet and Dance With Me. Leave no scratch marks for 3 seconds when exiting a locker.

When I'm really immersed and into the game, looping the killer hard, get hooked, unhooked annnnnnd I'm floating Jesus nurse
---
Because this game has a great concept, caring, no, loving developers and a caring community
---
they've been rebalancing audio again to match it more to before the engine update and to improve on it. its still very wonky for some people and takes quite the adjustment

yea a perk any decent killer can easily bait &gt; free 150% ms every 40 seconds. N we the clowns lol

Which if you are starting out streaming and have less than 5 viewers those initial views are what counts and will separate you from the other 99%.
---
Hard work is good, but is no the end-all, you just need to be slightly above average, and not deficient in any of the following -charisma/humor/attractive/skill and you can maintain the viewership. This also translates rather well into the workplace where you can climb by just being an average worker that people like.
---
If handwork was truly all that mattered we would be living in some meritocratic utopia.
---
Arenaline is godly. I've played with it and against it and I could assure you that it's useful. 
---
Rank 1 is saturated with average players at best.. this shouldn’t be the case 
---
Survival isn’t indicative of map favor. 
---
If all players from all ranks were pooled, of course it’s going to be “killer sided”. 
---
Some people play online games solely to make life miserable for other players.  It's been going on since the days of EQ, UO, and Shadowbane.  It was going on in MUDs, it was going on in BBs games before there was an internet.  These types of people (who could literally sit on  top of a noobs corpse for 12+ hours and kill them every time they rezzed (original term: corpse camper).  This is why I laugh at every attempt to add punishments for camping.  Those folks don't care even a little bit if they get punished.  They wouldn't care if they were getting NEGATIVE blood points.  The only people getting punished by that crap are folks who get stuck to a hook by other Survivors.  There's no real reason behind it, aside from that's what they consider entertaining.  And every complaint, every half assed perk, and every ineffective punishment that gets added because of it just adds to the entertainment value. 
---
The game has core issues that make it toxic, which all stem down to lack of counterplay.
---
Killer tunnels you and previous survivor used all nearby palettes? Darn.
---
Survivor loops you hard at killer shack, 3 Gen's pop and you ain't running NOED? Darn.
---
Lose ruin before you can even walk to it?
---
Flashlight saves and you can't move your head cause you're mid animation?
---
Killer slugs you through the window?
---
So when you're good at these mechanics that cannot be countered, people get frustrated and mad. 
---
I'm annoyed Claudette's being associated with toxicity in the first place. Survivors are skins and in my experience people are shitty regardless of whom they use; it's odd that it's just Claudette who gets a bad rep. Ever play against a team of bodyblocking Neas that teabag? Feng, I have no idea why she'd be considered toxic.  Leatherfaces that I've seen usually just hide out in the basement and they're hilarious.   
---
Seriously, basement Leatherfaces are some of my favorite games. They're dicking around but it could actually be a risky but useful strat. Survivors would get curious then venture into the basement, I've seen two get murdered this way. 
---
Ironically toxic or not, it's still toxic. I like both monto and noob3 and im aware of how they play. 
---
First person precision on a controller will always be inferior to mouse.  Any killer that needs a lot of it will suffer. Maybe if you found a controller with a trackball abd got really used to it, but that's the only real option.  Joysticks just cant match mice for that purpose.  You can filet a fish with a hatchet, but you'll always be better off doing it with a knife. 
---
But with dbd it is really special, it is like families that argue all the time about unimportant things but in the end, are loyal and love each other till the end
---
Thanks 
---
I love the sound when they miss their swing and smack a fence.    
---
+1 wood collected.    
---
Best thing is when they run into a dead end/corner and the killer blocks them for a second and looks at them like a disappointed dad.
---
I always get a chuckle from these posts. That middlefinger to the survivor
---
Fuck me... I played against TrU3Ta1ent twice.. once as hillbilly, and once as nurse (he was a survivor both times)... I cant find the billy clip anymore, but he put the nurse match on YouTube... I still go back to it from time to time to watch it... dunno why..
---
I disconnect if it’s a op nurse main, survivors unhooking me in front of killer, or if I’m getting tunneled the entire game. 
---
She looks like she just got out of Yamaoka's Haunting and contemplates smacking Tapp's ass, because that wouldn't hurt him that much AND alert him, thus triggering a chase, but he's too dummy thicc to pass up this opportunity, so she's kind of debating whether to do it or not
---
It was a dark time in history lol 
---
Dead hard mains are dead hard looking at this post 
---
I really think strong add-ons should have nerfs. I mean, nurse loses blinks and Billy needs more time to charge the chainsaw. Why not her?
---
these are insightful stats, but i feel like they don't tell the entire picture. they don't really account for playing vs specific killers in general, playing vs specific killers on certain maps, and they don't really account for the variation in survivor skill level you see across the community. i think those are very important variables.
---
i feel like, in a loose environment like this, you don't really NEED a "scientific method" to determine how it feels and plays. sure, it's anecdotal evidence, but play a map enough times and you eventually get the gist of what it's about.  
---
for clarity, is the escape rate metric measured by how many people on average make it out per match on a particular map? for instance, say a map has a 50% average escape rate, would this mean 2 people on average escape each game?
---
regardless, just by looking at that graph, you can see coldwind has all five of its maps rounded into the top ten. i think that in and of itself is pretty telling just how much it needs a rework. i didn't even account for the corn in my OP, which i'm sure also gets on people's nerves.
---
Doctor: “There will be no fun”
---
I had the same problem yesterday. I’ve been playing on console for a while but bought the game on steam over the weekend. I had no problem getting survivor games but didn’t manage to get a single killer game. 
---
&gt;Seriously, you're getting upset for survivors trying to give their teammate more time. Try playing survivor and get over yourself.
---
That sounded polite to you? She could have offered advice without being a turd
---
Imagine being that garbage of a human being that you have negative karma.
---
This dude is literally only asking for help/tips for ranking up and improving at the game. 
---
&gt;!Btw, who uses LOL in caps, and all that emoji😂 spam is cringy as hell!&lt;
---
This idea is far too creative for BHVR to even begin to consider. 
---
I feel you. Bodyblocking's the bane of my existence. I can't say I have the best advice on how to deal with it, my strategy is to use Sloppy Butcher or the RTB since I am a Pig main so the person that's being saved will be out of the picture regardless.   
---
I wish people could actually try to be helpful to you instead of being an asshole. Our community has enough toxicity
---
Why complain about people playing stupidly? 
---
When you finally catch that flashlight looper on coldwind but then three gens pop as soon as you pick them up
---
Why would the killer even check them three times? I don't get it lol. 
---
I'd be fine if stun extended that far in front of locker, but it's that far out on like a 90-100 degree angle from the locker.  That's just too much.  A little leeway to the sides is fine, but this is back to the whole "getting pallet stunned while standing in the next loop over" type crap. 
---
Brutal Strength, I feel unstoppable
---
Popping in just to say I'm glad things are working better for you now. Good on you, my dude!
---
When you finally catch that flashlight looper on Coldwind Farm but then three gens pop as soon asyou pick them up
---
Still,Huntress needs 115% imo.
---
Leave asap, it's boring. Unless it's double BP
---
That's a new one to me. I've endured a lot of racism from other players and never heard of them getting banned. I've been eating the N word for breakfast when I started playing killer. You must've done something pretty shitty. lol
---
I've killed him twice and he's escaped on me twice. Survived with him once but the legion dced after a 1 gen chase with me. 
---
I think everyone needs to read this ^ 
---
Would do well on the ‘Scroll of Truth’ 
---
People complain because the map is too big, takes too long to patrol, survivors seem to have an edge. But I'm liking them as well, althgh I needed time xD
---
BuT mY aBiLitY pUnIsHeS vAuLtInG
---
I love being stabbed and chased by legion lol, idk if it's because I play on PS4 but I find him fun to play against :) 
---
Who the fuck calls the killer the monster lmao 
---
Ah, you said your wifi at home, which implies no cable.  Also, Blops probably has servers, I imagine.  Back when I had 3 mbps dsl, I had to give up killer in Dbd, but could play f13 just fine.  This may solve itself when dbd finally adds servers.  Your connection may have some issues with little micro disconnects or getting periodically overwhelmed for one reason or another.  If possible, testing with some other peer to peer games might help figure that out. 
---
I was the same, but one time I snapped and hated the survivors. Now I laugh whenever they get angry 
---
Was gonna send that in, thanks for saving me the effort :D
---
Looks fun, finally decent movement speed like PRAISE THE ENTITY. I just wish the mori was different
---
thank you for this reply!
---
I just got the red mori and ive have had it once before. It was my understanding that cypress was the weakest one then there was a better one then ivory and ebony ones. But i see that isnt the case. 
---
Because Nurse is Nurse and Billy is Billy.
---
Wraith is pretty bad for that too :/ i just want my pebble, bell ghost
---
What a muda Item
---
No op you gotta personally insult the killer like an epic gamer
---
Yes, Escape rate means what % of Survivors don't die on a Map.  Stats show Killers at all levels have the advantage.  Even at Rank 1 Killers have higher than a 50% Kill Rate.
---
No idea how you can say a Map needs a rework when Survivors are only having a 40%-45% Escape Rate on it.  If anything, Coldwind should be used as an example of how to make the other maps more fair since 50% Escape rate would be a perfectly balanced map yet not even 1 map reaches this.
---
That only happens to me when they dc
---
Its a little bit of both imo. If you are a trash killer you can still be a trash legion. Don't always assume if you spawn in a match with him it will be bad. Playing as him people still arent super easy to get. They are easy to slash but they just get away and heal usually. Playing against him ive noticed that i can still get away if i lose him in a chase by confusing them not really out running. Out running wont happen outright. 
---
That isn’t map specific. 
---
He probably was behind someone and they didn't know until tier 2. Once you start running if you don't cover yourself he can get half a tier with you just running away. 
---
I took every adept killer from PS base package (up to Doc) in the first try. Just take ebony, it's like EZ mode ON
---
Nothing wrong with a bit of stretching in the morning
---
noooo :D
---
I don't really mind the ttv, i enjoy rewatching my matches with another point of view.
---
However, it kinda hurts me when i hear them shittalk. I don't mind some cursing, I do that alot. But there is a line between what you can say in the heat of the moment, and what is just insulting.
---
It's kinda sad that ttv has such a bad reputation. I used to stream dbd sometimes and i felt the need to advertise myself a little with a ttv, but on the other hand, i kinda felt scummy for doing it.
---
I find misses intimidating. Like when you know they are right there but missed. Had a freddy chase me around a truck and he slapped it and it made a ping noise. It gives me the chills. 
---
The thing is we are deeply involved in social media now,upto the fact that distinguishing between online and IRL activities seems difficult for us ,being called out for whatever reason online sometimes affect us in our real life 
---
And of course people who have thin skin are always gonna get upset , but undermining a person because of being upset is still not okay but I get what you're trying to say
---
Seeing as the range is so big, i am fairly certain that you can sit in the lockers at the bottom of the basement stairs and save your teammate. 
---
What Trapper players use noed? I main Trapper all the time and I usually get 3ks and 4ks. I think Trapper is fine to be honest with you but it wouldn’t hurt to have him carry at least one more trap by default
---
Shut the fuck up, it ruins the game for everyone in the lobby.
---
I've had 3 people instant disconnect when they found out it was the Hag with black ward offering. I guess it depends on your predictions and how often they come true, like e.g. The Nurse can either be a god or bad so people tend not to disconnect because they can unhook each other like 10 times and still get some points. the Hag will place a trap at each pallet and window you use and then instant teleport to you or your friend in the basement across the map. She's just unfun to go against. the Legion from my experience is not that bad but he does ignore windows and pallets for the most part and it's quite annoying to deal with but not impossible so I don't understand why people dc against him. 
---
a mori will only count if they are on death hook
---
Easy saying that but if survivors are running that meta that screams out i need all the help I can get haha 
---
Obviously.  Behavior also didn't release data for Kill Rates on Thursdays, or Saturdays either.  If you want to see something specific contact them and see if they include it on their next Developer stream. 
---
From the Data they released, it can be seen that every single map favors Killers and that Escape Rate is almost identical from Rank 15 through Rank 1.  With such uniform statistics there is no reason to think that Map Kill Rates would change in any meaningful way across maps.
---
If you have any data at all to suggest otherwise then feel free to show.
---
I definitely don't think it'd make him OP, I'll hand it to trapper, he can for sure be underestimated by survivors sometimes though. I've had plenty of games where I figured I'd get recked but instead ended up with a 4k because my trap placement was underestimated. BUT in terms of being a viable killer he is way too dependant on traps for map pressure. If I'm playing trapper and I see someone before I'm satisfied that I've put enough traps either it's gonna be a trapless game or I know I'm gonna have to miss out on an opportunity to chase.
---
You shouldn’t be getting matched with those survivors though.. is this ps4? I’m rank 1 killer and don’t have any issues at all.. occasionally you’ll run in to a team like that but you can’t win them all 
---
Lery's is slightly better for scratched mirror Myers
---
A fun add on I found that scares people is doing wraith boneclapper so everyone hears it, but also doing the add on that removes your terror radius and stain for a couple seconds after you de-stealth, it’s cheap so it’s fun
---
Honestly, it's fine. I use it for the BP doubler anyway, if I see auras that's a plus. You're being a whiny killer. Stop it.
---
You’re the one who said it was cancer.
---
Killer main here. I notice a higher chance of a dc with legions trappers pigs and doctors. Usually just one with anyone but legion. I myself hate playing againdt all four. Trappers seem to get 4k more for some reason and doctors are just assess on skill checks. Legions rip people up sometimes and pigs never fail to sneak up on me when im doing gens. 
---
Ur a whiny killer
---
Actually there was Robert Hansen in Alaska, who would kidnap and rape prostitutes at gunpoint, before take them to a shack in the Matanuska Valley which was only reachable by boat. He would release them into the wilderness and then hunt them down like animals with a rifle and knife. Even when one teenage prostitute escaped (she was 17 when he raped and kidnapped her) by running away and flagging down a passing semi-truck the police believed him over her, allowing him to continue until mutilated bodies were found near the Knik River and a criminal profiler suggested Hansen as the killer. He murdered 21 people this way.
---
I would personally hate to see any real life Killers in this game, but there were definitely REAL people and REAL situations that seem like they belong more in Slasher film than real life.
---
Ooohh... burn. \s

Ah ops whiteknight.

It's not a shit post umad
---
You did say almost; I suppose I was just clarifying that there were real people and events who would fit right into a Slasher film. I can fully agree a Killer with a gun would almost certainly suck (unless MAYBE it was a muzzle-loaded gun of some kind).
---
(ps- okay, I admit I was worried for a second when I started reading your reply, but I gotcha &lt;3)
---
To add to this, vaulting a pallet he's just vaulted is more effective than doing the same at a window, due to slight differences in animation.
---
Nope, still not mad. Unlike you, I'm not whining about trivial stuff.
---
I have to disagree with you there. I don’t use ruin on Trapper or Hag and I get pretty good games with the
---
.
---
I think there are a lot of variables to what causes BM. 
---
Obviously some players are considerably more likely to do so than others, depending on their temperament. But it can also depend (from my experience) on what Killer is played. 
---
For example when I play Myers, I very rarely get any sort of negative reaction. Yet if I play Doctor or (especially) Legion - there’s a considerable increase in salt and BM. 
---
I imagine a detailed experiment taking into account all of this would take a great deal of time! But good luck nonetheless. 
---
Yeah but he can’t stream dbd now because of the latest ban, and the 3 bans he got on pc forced him to switch to ps4. So the ban/bans did do something
---
Yeah it's not really new as in only just got the game I mean like.. they're still in the process of learning because once you get to a certain number of hours you get to this point where you don't get mad or anything anymore because you're just over it. Like you're toxic for the entire process then suddenly.. it's all gone lol
---
Sometimes I wish there were official pictures of the killers in their human years before being butchers for the entity. Like Evan before he became a human cheese grater or spirit with a pre-blue-goulash look.
---
I’m rank 12 and I’m seeing it with rank 12-15 and even some before that at lower ranks.

I thought this was legit Claudette fanart until I saw the wikihow at in the corner. I was legit impressed

I don't know much about the process but don't VPNs/New account a way to work around it?

Mirror Myers on an indoors map is the quintessential slasher movie experience in videogame form, IMO. 
---
Amazing
---
There *is* a missing toe! 
---
Don't feel stupid, I couldn't think of what to call the toe next to her big toe. :P
---
(Thanks for all the amazing renders BTW &lt;3)
---
May I introduce you to my good friend - Herman Carter? 
---
Freddy's perks alone make we kinda want to buy his DLC. They're not super powerful or anything but they're so cool! Like I've seen Bloodwarden pull more value than it should because most people don't immediately run out through the gates they've opened! Situational as hell, but really cool anyway.
---
Unless you're ridiculously low rank, I hope you enjoyed your depip.
---
I'm serious, I've played it where I've gone totem hunting solo, and by the time you're done, 3+ gens are done and you literally can't pip through gens + gates at that point.
---
Because some people just want to have fun? Not everyone goes off just bloodpoints. Heck if they did half the subs posts wouldn’t exist! Personally I would see how they play before using it or not but I bet that Meyers that mori’d me and a guy the other night when only 2 loaded in would Mori thw fuck out of them :) and that’s okay too.
---
Personally I feel all the Killers have some sort of emotional depth, but Spirit without a doubt is the most emotional, and I like how her expression changes so violently. In her bio near the end it says
---
"She would make him (her father) pay, in this life or the next.
---
A dark fog slowly veiled her eyes, but it could not subdue her rage."
---
She clearly was flicking through a torrent of emotions as the Entity took her.
---
Anyone know when the plague is released on console?
---
But because she doesn't have the conventional, movie star good looks, people call her ugly. Same thing with Meg. How conformist can one be?
---
I love BBC
---
Nurse’s Calling is a crutch because it counters Self Care
---
If the devs made this an actual in-game thing it would be lit
---
Yes, they can be, not all of them are though.   
---
I've learned to just dodge those lobbies, this is pretty much what I do: 2+ friends, I dodge; 3 private profiles and similar names? Dodge. 2 friends + 2 private profiles or private friends list and flashlights and toolboxes? Dodge. 
---
I might become more "flexible" once I improve and get more perks, but for now this seems to be working out a lot better.
---
You can buy them with a million blood points??? I thought only iridescent shards or money were the options.
---
Nurse’s Calling is clearly a crutch because it counters Self Care
---
You might, im just saying its optimal to run ruin on them. 
---
Personally, I would hate a Killer who was a real person and I hope BHVR will never add one.
---
Firstly, most IRL killers were just messed up sickos. DbD's Killers all have unique abilites or powers and I can't think of any interesting powers to give to people who were infamous for raping decapitated heads or turning people's faces into lampshades.
---
Secondly, even those killers who didn't, did kill REAL people. Breathing, thinking, living fellow human beings. It'd be ridiculously insensitive to the memory of those people to try to immortalize their killers in a video game and let players play as them for fun.
---
I wouldn't be opposed to adding Survivors who were real people that survived horrific situations (although I would prefer we get fictional characters from BHVR, the community, or a licensed franchise AND adding an IRL Survivor would come with it's own myriad problems) but adding a real life Killer just seems tasteless. There's no benefit I can think of besides shock value.
---
hahaha I love this!
---
I only swf when I play with my boyfriend but honestly.... we sooooo do not strategize and just play as we normally would lol.
---
Thanks
---
I think the kerosene tank should at least do its blindness thing for 120s like the SAV so its at least decent for the hook, but I guess blindness is just a redundant status effect overall.
---
Also can we just talk about the fact that Clown could be amazing overall if he didnt have bottles made of sugar glass, a belly hitbox of mercury and this leftover smoker-lung-slow from his PTB.
---
Killer needs to pick up her glasses
---
A crusade? Can I get an incredibilies?
---
You are not supposed to vault the window back when doing the window tech
---
Not gonna lie, I'd shag Dwight
---
Like a lot of killers, at base his power is annoying and not very effective.  With certain add-ons it goes from meh to broken immediately.  With cheese, it's borderline broken.
---
Plague will be about the same.  
---
  
---
They could've made legion's "power" just the constant ability to vault pallets instead of what it is and it'd be pretty much just as effective and not as annoying.  He'd literally be better without a real power, just m2 to jump pallet.  How sad is that?  
---
Maybe they wanted another killer that wasn't as subject to loops to ease up on r1 nurse spam, but yeah, they also didn't learn from Freddy that killers whose powers shoot themselves in the foot just don't work. 
---
Oh. Can someone translate this to real English? 
---
Maybe for me I like to use Spirit Fury, Enduring, The Breaking pallets faster perk and Nurses Calling. It’s been working out pretty well 
---
*Note: Sorry for repost, I made a typo in the original image and it bothered me. Couldn't figure out how to fix it, so I just remade the post.*
---
All in all I think the ultra rare add-ons aren't very good (Iridescent seal just has too many draw backs and the Incense just doesn't do much, since vomiting survivors are broken survivors who you are either chasing or who are going to cleanse at a fountain ASAP) and the add-ons that affect infection on objects just seem sort of odd to use.
---
It is unclear whether or not the increased movement speed "while charging" Vile Purge only includes the short time during which you are slowed down at the beginning of the activation or if it also includes when you have it fully charged and are holding onto it. If it also works when fully charged this would improve map movement and therefore be excellent. It's also unclear if this doesn't work during Corrupt Purge, seems like it could since both powers slow you down in similar ways?
---
The increase movement speed and duration of Corrupt Purge both functionally serve the same purpose - increasing the likelyhood of you making use of the power by either making it last longer or helping you find survivors faster.
---
The best thing seems to be to use the emetics to increase effectiveness, followed by using the Rubbing Oil to make it charge faster in a chase (seems really weird that this is a unique effect.)
---
How the hell would anyone play dbd on a phone and not be a half blind potato?  I like the general IDEA, but Jesus. 
---
Lmao what reality are you living in. If someone says something racist and someone else "smashes their face in", that violent person will go to jail. That's assault. Have the self-control to not act like a total ape whenever something displeases you.
---
That takes one full enitre vomit on a survivor, which is much harder to do than landing a hatchet.
---
I personally main the pig, and what i find useful is whispers, ruin, surveillance, and a fourth random perk, I find surveillance very useful when down to the last gen. you get great control and knowledge on which gen is being worked in thus know where to crouch and ambush, thinking about it, pop goes the weasel works great as a fourth perk as it will regress the worked on gen instantly.
---
Just my two cents :)
---

I’m afraid this is the best I can do, rank 4 but with pretty shitty perks. (Sorry for poor quality)

Im going to name famous people rather than actors -

Dwayne The Rock Johnson as the Trapper

Yodeling boy as the HillBilly

Gal Gadot as the Nurse

Conan O’Brian as the Clown

Amanda as the Pig (shocking)

Christoph Waltz as the Doctor

Brad Pitt as David

This IS the original creator...

You missed "unique add ons which change how the plague plays." It has one in it. One. The rest are basically number adjustments :|
---
Nope lol
---
I sometimes play with Technician when I'm feeling saucy.
---
I'm not sure about the numbers of how long things stay infected and what the add ons add to the time, but i'd wanna use the object add ons.
---
With Whispers, if you're near a gen with whispers on but can't see anyone, spit on the gen and walk away. They either start it and get infected or waste time waiting for it to cleanse itself. In chases and Loops you spit on windows and pallets cos they're gonna use them at some point in the chase.
---
Add ons for Corrupt Purge seem too luck based on weither or not you're near a corrupt fountain when you need it or you have to walk to the other side of the map to activate it.
---
= i am going to dc every legion who runs thanataphobia with ruin cause i cannot be asked to play that slug of a game with that killer for more than 9 minutes in a row
---
No actual tutorials, but I do have a few of myself making the images. It can give you a good idea on how the program works. 
---
title is r/comedyhomicide
---
I still find it hilarious how killer mains insist that the game is survivor sided, when this infographic came out BEFORE killers got some buffs (like the NOED change, for example).
---
I feel like the numbers would be different for strictly 4 man SWFs, but by reading comments here, you'd think they were in literally every single game on the planet.
---
They are not infinite anymore, that's right but there are some structures that feels sooo long to take the survivor if they loop you without any skill just running in circles.
---
The nightmare of course. Legion is cancer
---
It’s honestly not that effective against good survivors anyways. I only use BBQ for the BP modifier.
---
Could you explain this a little more?
---
The fact that the devs still seem to think this is a horror game.
---
Fake kyf
---
Honestly the most hilarious shit in this game that makes me CRY of laughter is watching other survivors trying to snap out of it and failing only to hear them constanly scream. Even typing this is making me giggle on the inside.
---
Ikr, I don't get why people watch bbc, solo-girl is where it's at!
---
They mentioned how before they released Spirit they were working on creating better emotions on faces that could change, and showed lots of spirit expressions. I never expected them to just jam them all on one animation.
---
Haha sorry mate! It's just that David has such a broad back (with the default skins). It feels like you're huge compared to other survivors!
---
As a survivor I get dodged (solo as well) 8/10. Do I complain?  No. You know why?
---
Cause I also play killer and I know the pain of SWF :) Play some more with a killer and you'll feel the same.
---
I’m a rank one killer main, spirit and nurse. :) thing is that I never joined in with a swf. Thank you, next.
---
I'd say survivor and killer are equal toxic here
---
I usually give everyone a gg and a compliment.
---
Unless they play Hag, fuck the Hag.
---
Not for any particular reasons, I just get irrationally salty at Hag players.
---
Even if it was a fun and enjoyable match I’m still gonna be a mildly salted that someone played Hag. 
---
There are times when if I know I'm about to depip due to having an awful game and the group of survivors have been toxic, I'll do it. Why not? Already going to depip, might as well bring someone with me. Also, if a survivor spawns on my ruin and cleanses it, they will get tunneled to death just because. When you have every teachable unlocked , you dont need the points, why would you care? Legitimately no incentive. 
---
Survivors don't have ANY iframes against her corrupted purge whilst being unhooked, meaning that if she vomits in you whilst you're being unhooked, you'll 100% go down before you can do anything.
---
They added in the invincibility to prevent that kind of thing for everyone else, I think it's just bugged for her and huntress.
---
Yep ranking system is garbage.
---
i get like 2 a bloodweb lul
---
I call that bullshit, if you're rank 1 killer and never stumbled upon SWF you're full of yourself.
---
I'm red rank too and it happens way too many times. PS4 here.
---
Lol did you not read my comment? I said I never queued up with swf. Reading comprehension y’all.
---
A wave could easily be seen as "I'm over here, you fuckface"
---
Golden reasons, take my orange internet point!
---
I just dodge if I see red ping. I'm done chasing teleporting Megs.
---
I hope so too. I hate the crybabies who want a nerf when they simply ....suck at battling that killer
---
This just in, using flashlights and doing 360s are toxic.
---
Because they're fast, ye gotta think fast
---
I can confess that I used NOED back in the day when the true inifinites were a thing but ever since it turned into a Hex totem I've not used it. I don't want to be carried by it.
---
Killers are so delusional. Of course you're going to 4k against SWF. The very fact they're playing together means they're going to be altruistic. You know they're going to save before 2nd and you can make guaranteed plays around that fact. There's very few SWF teams who will prioritise generators over trying to keep a friend in the game. 
---
Especially now that survivors have been hit with like the 16th wave of nerfs, killers have it pretty good. Your hardest 4ks are going to be against survivors who just run gens without any regard for their teammates. 
---
Lol i must have a ton of unlucky games &gt;-&gt; I'm good at playing killer but I'm mediocre at survivor 
---
Funny thing is, that killer is almost a carbon copy of Hel.
---
Sounds like you won't stop playing this game :)
---
If she has a brother, we'd ought to be scared.
---
If you buy a killer you should know their ability. Otherwise it’s a waste of shards.
---
When the David misses a skillcheck and I tbag at him to express my disappointment and he unloads his whole flashlight in my face like "nah fam, suck my peepee".
---
Also when I run into a wall and get downed and I spin and the killer just looks at me and moves left and right. We both know I fucked up.
---
Honestly, lately I'm missing chill killers. Like man idk nod a bit or something, it feels like I'm playing against an AI.
---
I was on the hook during it and I was so confused lmao. I was the meg with the white jacket. Had no idea what was happening during all of this. 
---
I run NOED. I don’t camp, tunnel, or “go for that 4K”. I run rank 10-15, have fun with my potato survivors, and simply use NOED as a farming deterrent after exit gates are open. Get off my map or get on a hook.
---
I think Jake? I never hear anything bad about him after the saboteur perk got nerfed lol
---
For killer I don't know ;-;
---
Pointing into an occupied locker intensifies
---
Waiting aswell! Excited for killer or surviour? 
---
How many times I've been able to hide from Clown thanks to that.
---
Sue me but slugging and facecamping under the right circumstances have tactical advantages and aren't inherently toxic. Facecamping the first hook with 5-4 gens left is dumb and toxic sure but slugging when two are left and facecamping with 4 alive and gates open both have tactical advantages.
---
I’m waiting for the survivor Jane Romero since I’m a survivor main. Wbu?
---
I feel like that’s just a common sentiment in a lot of multiplayer games. It’s easier to deflect rather than actually accept that you suck and should train to get better. And this behavior is further strengthened by the fact that since these games are online, you’re pretty much anonymous and there’s little chance you’ll see them again. 
---
They can’t do that! Shoot them... or something
---
Same here! When it's a trapper my Survival chance, that's already pretty slim, is halved.
---
Run straight, run backwards, run straight. RIP Console Nurse.
---
Lol what? If the game was too easy, he deserves a higher rank. Imagine dominating a match in a game with an MMR system, and gaining less MMR than in a hard match. Thus keeping the dominating player at a lower difficulty and letting the struggling player advance. 5/7 logic right there mate.
---
When that teabag develops into a frenzy of nodding, ultrafast teabag and running in circles and you know the whole match is going to be a shitshow.
---
LMAO this is great
---
Don’t lie, you are waiting for that booty :p 
---
You do realize that you're not alone in a lobby, right? If you believe the killer is constantly dodging lobbies because of YOU, maybe you should change your getup a bit?
---
Maybe we need a bow down one then lol
---
Oh my god haha, that's amazing.
---
I was a killer in a game like this last night.
---
Stab one, they mess up a pallet fro, stab them again, basement, bamboozle our the window where TWO MORE are hiding just to the side of, stab, stab, down another, hook outside just as the other is unhooked, start running back, the unhooked runs right into me and I down them again all in the span of the first 2 minutes.
---
I may have been playing Clown, but those laughs were sincere.
---
Some say she’s still checking lockers to this very day. 
---
No, there'd be so many ragequits
---
That's fine IMO , my issue is with tryhard swfs that have deranked and have at least 3 players. If i had to dodge lobbies with 2 friends, then I'd be pretty screwed :P  
---
It is because SOOOO many Killers have this mentality that if they do not get 3 or 4 Kills then they lost and it is a sign Survivors are overpowered.
---
I cannout count the number of timesI have seen a streamer get looped some, complain for multiple minutes about how Survivors need a nerf because they are so overpowered and yet they still end the game with 2 or even 3 kills.
---
Mine goes up by .2 but if its wraith I go down to 0% of surviving lol
---
Is there something on my face
---
Saved.
---
Best way to learn is to play, esp since it’s still in PTB.
---
When you're the first girl out.
---
I am guilty of doing it to newer players, the tunneling. Because they're SO AFRAID and will start running away from the jigsaw box as soon as they see me. I even do the clumsy exaggerated big turns when in a chase with them and they don't realize and just keep running, until that beartrap goes SNAP!
---
Hm, I can't think of something toxic with a bow, then again who bows these days xD
---
The first three killers are usually the most lethal ones
---
I'll remember that
---
Oooo Quivering! Thoughts?
---
Umm, no? you're not the only one? It's kind of her idle animation, pretty hard to miss :/
---
Hilly Billy, on the runway you... sawed the competition in half, but during the team acting challenge you've... built some walls between you and your teammates... I'm sorry, my dear, but you are ^(up) for elimination
---
Next week probably
---
I know that this is a joke but are there really anyone who thinks its hard ti get to rank one?
---
As killer its easy af as survivor its harder a bit but still pretty easy
---
Ez
---
The thing you didn't mention is that, it mostly matches you with people of equal MMR. And if you continuously beat people at that specific MMR, yours will skyrocket meaning you will get matched with increasingly harder oppenents.
---
Thats why in LoL, some smurf get like +40 or more LP or even skip certain divisions.
---
I keep re watching the video. its so amazing
---
When you scroll, you get a stroke
---
Killer. The plague looks incredible

---
Well when gens only take 80 seconds the killer needs more time, so yeah
---
Trapper: I’m not even mad, I’m impressed, a whole wheel of cheese?!
---
I have this suspicion that some people rely on the hatch too often, but don't understand the spawn mechanic behind it, so they end up wasting time prioritizing searching and stealthing over sitting in place doing a gen.
---
Skills
---
Cut to the confessional and Hilly Billy is absolutely stunned
---
The biggest thing working in your favour while she has the normal puke, is the fact that if they over-commit to a chase and use it over and over again, then they lose so much freaking time that they practically shoot themselves in the foot. They can't stop a loop with it, they can't down you easily unless they break you and combo a basic attack afterwards, which is easier said then done on some loops vs a competent survivor.
---
You can do it if the trap is in the middle of the pallet. Good Trappers put the traps slightly on one side of the pallet, then you cant do it anymore.
---
It usually isn’t meant in a bad way. No sarcasm no toxicity
---
I saw monto in a deathgarden beta game once, being an Australian you don't get to see much streamers/ youtubers except for Devi with his monto builds every game. 
---
Monto didn't put me in the video tho :(
---
Oh lol yeah true. Didn't think of that, man...that's sad :(
---
Guy on the hook must have been so confused, lol
---
Tbh moris kinda fuck you out of alot of points later in the game.
---
Or you bring a build revolved around OoO and it's a Scratch Mirror Myers/Freddy :p
---
She do looks like Claudette.
---
Do you think she’s weak?? Easily one of the top tier killers in the game. With prayer beads she is #1 in the game. I like to play with the brown add ons and no ruin. It’s fun! 
---
There's little punishment to disconnecting. That's why.
---
Things would look different if there was a more punishing ban system for DC'ers. 
---
'The one who stands behind the gun, lives forever'.
---
That combo is good if used far away from any short of loop, sure they don't get a speed boost but entering any loop zone prevents the combo from being so potent in the first place if you are at least half descent at using it as survivor, she even has a cooldown before she can attack after the vomit and during that cooldown she is also slowed a bit which makes it possible to do what i mentioned above if you did not waste time trying to circle around her to avoid the puke (small jukes left and right will do so you don't catch all the vomit, but you should focus on heading towards any loop and not wasting time). As for the corrupt purge, yeah it can be hard as hell to avoid on some maps, but not that game breaking, you would realize that if you played a good few matches with her.
---
I saw one claudette do the same for me once. She got trapped on the second trap though.
---
Most likely the emotions she felt when her father killed her.
---
Nothing official, but based on previous PTB-to-release cycles, it should come on the 19th.
---
Dead hard...such a try hard perk
---
I have 800+ hours on PS4. I started playing on PC a month ago. But I am not playing on PS4 anymore but I have all my stuff unlocked only there. Feels bad to start over 😶😑
---
Would a dc count tho?
---
What a wild ride
---
What about those ones do you like? Jw
---
It's just a meme about invisible Claudette. She is ridiculously good at blending into the exteriors of most maps and so there are jokes about it.
---
Also there is a meme about No0b3 who was being chased and Claudette who was meanwhile doing a gen for 20 minutes
---
not if they DC in the loading screen, otherwise I think so
---
Ok, one day after my birthday. That’s one hell of a gift if it’s true though.
---
It's not just that you have to almost double-pip; they made Iridescent Killer Emblems *much* harder to get.
---
So to even PIP at red ranks you have to play absolutely perfectly.
---
WAAAAAH! I mean yeah, thats what she does...
---
Would also go great with that crazy Benny Hill song
---
Legion, dear god legion. Freddy is annoying, even if he sucks, he’s bound to have NOED. He’s a terrible killer but he’s annoying af.
---
so many lockers wtf, time to start running the legion perk thats about lockers
---
Freddy is fun anyway. He’s not very good but his gameplay is something new
---
Flair checks out ??
---
its*
---
Literally nobody in the community besides the campers want this to be a part of the game. It's unfair, unfun, and unskillful. Consistent complaining by the community would force the developers to implement a real answer to this plague on the game, and the only thing stopping that is "progress cucks" who just keep telling others to shut up about it. Look at dedicated servers......we bitched like crazy and it happend, and this would be no different.
---
Believe it or not, but i dont run NOED. Its a wasted perk slot imo. But cleansing a totem doesnt take much time, just destroy them and you are fine. I know, on some maps it can be hard to find all of them, but come on... 
---
You are so right... Wow... The subtitles of this episode have a typo...
---
If the hatch kept the game going there would no such thing as a hatch standoff. The current hatch either brings the game to a halt which can last upwards to an hour of just standing there and waiting for the killer to swing, or it's as anticlimactic as it comes with the survivor jumping right in as soon as the third survivor is sacrificed with the killer having no chance.
---
The hatch as it currently is, is terrible for the game. 
---
My suggestion brings the game to a conclusion. A 90 second final hunt where you either escape or you die. There is no hatch standoff, and you cannot hide for long. Eventually you are found within a minute, and it's up to you how long you can loop and out-mind-game the killer. Most of all both sides have a fair chance - something that the current hatch does not do at all.
---
funny you are the one sounding uber toxic, not the killer.
---
"both are toxic" 
---
*streamer with entitlement and alot of viewers acts extremely toxic setting a great example in the game.*
---
I know and i hade noed too, just showing the hipocrisy from survivor who complain when they have so Many things themselves
---
Seeing them is is nice, thanks. Personally, I'd run Ashen Apple and Devotee's Amulet.
---
As someone that refuses to remove it from absolutely every Killer i'm fine with the nerf. The information it gives you is *very* useful.
---
Also the fat stack of points is hard to pass up anyway.
---
No.
---
I just wanna have fun. I'm not messing with quad flashlights or people that switch at the last second. I don't bring asshole perks and that excuses me from dealing with asshole survivors.
---
I have to disagree. I'm a rank 1 killer myself (granted, much better at surv but that's not the point), and can honestly say that I generally enjoy my games regardless of SWF or not. If you let it get into your head that you're gonna have a bad time playing against them, then yeah, you're gonna have a bad time, but if you just play the game with the "hey, I got this!" Kinda mindset, you'd be amazed how well you can do, even against SWF :)
---
I love the AHS meme hype right now in this sub
---
I expect every killer main who runs NOED to use it. They’re the ones that suggest running it after all. 
---
Yeah she played on PS4 and I think she mained Quentin. She streamed once for a charity event.
---
If I'm face camping, one of three things has happened:
---
1. Exit gates are open, and I'm protecting what will most likely be my only kill. 
---
2. You BM'd me, so I decided it was worth taking the loss to make sure you die.
---
3. You clearly sandbagged a teammate. I'm a surv main myself, so when I see clear, intentional sandbagging, I tunnel down the sandbagger/camp them so they know not to pull that shit again. 
---
switch out "hide" with "toxic", then this would be correct!
---
I seen this and immediately regretted it, we loaded into the institute and I was a hillbilly..... ya it was bad for me lol was going to farm and be nice until the obsession decided to t-bag me at a pallet. Rip meeting nice console players yesterday :(
---
Adre, SC and Flashlights literally aren't a valid to point to complain about and DS is getting gutted sooooo
---
I don’t understand why all these memes have self care in them. When I play killer I love the fact that people waste their time healing. Makes it easier for me
---
Oh, I used those examples specifically to highlight ways in which killers can behave that have no strategic merit, and are therefore usually done solely to try and ruin someone's game/mood.
---
Nodding at someone after downing them or hitting them on hook is not any more detrimental to one's round than teabagging at a pallet as a survivor would be (and both can arguably even serve strategical purposes, in a sense of psychological gameplay: disctracting or frustrating the killer, trying to get them to chase you or make mistakes; demotivating the survivor, encouraging them to kill themselves on hook or even disconnect, and such).
---
Unfun? Only if you don't like salt heh + camping can actually be a very legit start, doors are opened you know they are SWF, you got a guy on the hook at that point its either camp and secure that kill or get none.  
---
Nah but seriously what is so hard to just smash the rest of the gens and let the LF (you can save from every other killer at any point of time which is quite the design flaw) have his one kill? It's a game so maybe just accept that you sometimes can't win?
---
What is the show/movie that gives the scene?
---
It's sad that these same stale memes get to the top while stuff like this gets ignored. Good job op.
---
I mean the fact this kind of stalemate is even possible is complete garbage from a design standpoint but your comments are WAAAAY more toxic than the killer waiting that long.
---
You won t get away that easy if i am dyng on hook while you wait for hatch to Open i am taking you with me
---
How do you know?
---
*you've yee'd your last haw*
---
I'd say the only changes he needs are maybe some add-on changes? I don't know. Nothing major. 
---
How much people bitch about Legion when Killers like Hillbilly and Bubba are just as cancer
---
Hilly Billy... your killer couture had us screaming, but your performance in the Slasher Rusical was no thriller......….………........ You’re safe.
---
Have mercy pls
---
When I've done that it was either me begging for mercy or an apology if I thought I did something toxic-y.
---
Usually when I do it I mean it more as a gift haha. There was a match where one didn't load in so the other DC'D leaving two of us left and the leather face kindly let us farm. When the doors were opened and it was clear they didn't want to hook I quickly went to each chest and brought them the item inside. The leather face got a map, medkit, and toolbox. They nodded furiously and then I left. 
---
Head on apply directly to the forehead
---
Hilly Billy your look on the runway today was .... killer. Condragulations you are the winner of this weeks challenge
---
I thought everyone knew that. 
---
(Doctor huntress and leather daddy main) looks in Horror, you monster
---
That was weird. I had to watch a couple times to see what happened.
---
The plague bit of her face switched. I never noticed that
---
Serious question: why are people so afraid of flashlights?
---
Legion. I can actually win against Legion but with Freddy it’s pretty much guaranteed to be a loss
---
That's awesome looking!
---
that is not me talking in the video...what is wrong with you? That is the Twitch streamer that was playing the survivor...I am the killer in the video....
---
Thanks  :3
---
see you in hell, glennjamin
---
Well yeah, if people hate NOED so much they should easier to find totems. Only downside is of you play against a Hag and you can't tell where anything is...
---
:o
---
The emotions are not meaningless. When she appears sad, she is mourning her mother, and when she appears angry, she wants revenge on her father.
---
Well then
---
Depends on if I like you or not. &lt;3
---
Depends on if the killer you lost to had noed. Not sure how, it just do
---
I think we all truly do
---
Freddy excels at slowing the game down.
---
Once the new patch hits, try Thanatophobia + Sloppy Butcher, and Green Dress addon so survivors don't get skillchecks. If they want to selfcare it will take 2 minutes.
---
It's not even the flashlight mechanic itself that sets me off. It's just that, only survivors who think they're altruistic gods epic trolling killers bring flashlights at high ranks.
---
Idk, I like using it on both, but Lerys feels harder to pressure because no 2 story drop hits/its bigger. 
---
Hood man bad
---
I never run it because I never find the totem anyways. Its either found at the start or never

I agree. I think Cara Ricketts would fit that bill nicely.
---
She was one of "the Twins" in Far Cry New Dawn btw.
---
Survivors: Nerf killer, we want killer with slow movespeed
---
Also survivors: Legion is boring to play against
---
The killers FOV is in first person and looks like you’re looking through binoculars, you have no peripheral vision while playing killer
---
Hey sorry for dumb question but im out of the loop lol. Why is the running joke that dwight loves hiding in lockers?
---
So every other perk makes perfect sense and is rational?
---
This gave me heart attacks :)
---
r/accidentalrennaisance
---
Could be really good 🤔
---
Mad lad
---
The first probably wont happen, the second seems plausible and the third one happens when they are downed so button might be changed when they are hit into injured for that to work. I dont know of course I am only megan
---
How are they just as bad? Curious
---
Yes, in the most noble of ways
---
3 killer, 7 survivor. I can get to rank 1, but hate it up there. At this rank I see more than just 3 killers
---
I dont get it then
---
whens release?
---
I said Legion is cancer, not the game
---
[Here's your answer] (https://youtu.be/oExzT4O0Ap8)
---
The only traps that can stop you now are the ones with DICKS
---
"JuSt Do ToTeMs" especially when you are solo and you have to do gens, make saves, get chased, AND do totems. Yeah its easier said than done. And 99.9% of the time survivors dont do totems so you as solo are left to do 5 totems. And with improved totem placements it can be difficult. Finding the first 3 are fine. The last two are always hard and take a lot of time. Time in this game is important. Doing totems isnt as easy as you think.
---
i know people hate him but he's just so fun
---
I like endgame Freddy alot
---
Your escape is no one else’s responsibility.
---
But say the dad was corrupted by the enity, or something to explain his rage and murder intent would he mind be at peace while his daughters would be nothing but rage, and then when they meet on the new battlefield
---
That and the worst survivor we have is 
---
“Oh I gamble a lot”
---
And let’s not forget the villain
---
“I pray paint walls” 
---
It would be better for a survivor to be a bad person but not excusing the killer for being bad 
---
ah, a man of culture! my respect
---
But sc is toxic and op. Healing for 32 seconds and wasting your time is op. Duh. /s
---
Thank you good sir
---
Or as I like to call it: Stockholm Syndrome 
---
To each their own. Huntress is strong, but to me Spirit (a good one) and screw over survivors in a chase more than a huntress can
---
I'm almost to 9000, definitely will be getting Spirit
---
Oof. I unsubbed yesterday from his channel, glad I did.
---
Yes, you added the music!
---
I don’t camp and I don’t care about it at all. It’s legitimately the smart move to do occasionally. 
---
I think he needs a buff, but something minor like adrenaline not waking people up (and healing them) or people not waking up when getting out of the dying state and/or being able to pick people up while someone else is healing them. 
---
Overall, he is like every other killer (except nurse and spirit), he is good in the right hands but can still be destroyed by swf. I believe people saying he is underpowered just don't know how to use him well, my particular play style with him (being mostly ambushing) works very well for me most of the time, which is why he is one of my best killers. I'm just praying the rework they have in mind doesnt change his ability to the point where it isnt comparable to the old one, because then the way he plays would be lost. 
---
I love it! Especially in lower ranks, every killer has some sort of hex. And it’s always a good idea to do the dull totems as well. The perk will also train you as to where totems typically spawn. 
---
Do survivors not see your animation that comes with starting a phase walk?
---
Even if this isn't endorsed, isn't it against the rules?
---
Yeah I’ve had dead hard fail more times than I can count 
---
You dorky kids need to stop crying about Legion and get better at the game.
---
A few weeks ago legion was the "worst killer" in the game
---
well if you noticed it recently, scratch marks were brightened in the PTB which a lot of pc videos would be on this month.
---
I like her power and now that I've learned how to use it, I'd say it's pretty powerful!
---
Same
---
Yakkity Sax
---
Well you succeded XD
---
If the enemy is better than you, it's toxic. 
---
I didn't have to pay for doctor, hag, or Huntress. Aren't they free?
---
So basically
---
https://youtu.be/-lHogdeVbdQ
---
Iridescent Stome. Trap in High Grass next to Pallet. Claudette runs into it, I hook her 4m next to it. I dont reset the Trap. It'll do that itself.
---
I come back to the Hook, trap still inactive. Rihht in front of me a save. I don't want to tunnel, go for ashat farmer. Claudette runs to the Pallet - rihht as she walks over the trap, it resets itself.
---
Nightmare. Legion is *miss* *miss* *miss* *hit* after 360ing several time. Or just juking out. Stealth isnt an option  considering they have a thing to show where survivors are. You cant juke or hide. So you become a W gamer
---
One is cheap, but it's a decent chunk of change to buy every DLC
---
*ds requires an ounce of skill*
---
Oh god thanks for the laugh!
---
Wait, you are not joking?
---
Getting the chapter day 1
---
aaronplaystv was banned for DCing ages ago.
---
Most annoying is when it procs and you get the exhaustion and you character does that glitchy wiggle on the floor because on the killer's game state they hit you before it activated, and on your screen you activated just as they hit. 
---
DS can be tough on console honestly 
---
She should’ve puked on them
---
Some sounds survivors makes when getting hit, especially Dwight when he goes like " AUGH-h-oh-oooh"
---
I think anybody that plays both sides a lot would know how delusional that sounds. Survivors cry toxic at the drop of a hat.

By my measure, toxic killers are like a once a month occurrence. These are the people that nod/hookhit/facecamp even when losing gens or hold the last survivor hostage. No matter whether I'm a killer or survivor, most of the shit talking is coming from the survivors, win or lose. Toxic survivors are more like a 1-3 games a day occurrence, and by that I mean teabaggers, flashlight clickers, people that spam quick actions, people that wait at the gate/hatch (still crouch spamming and clicking), and people that talk shit in chat.
---
You can. You'll be perma-banned from the first game to catch you, then if you proceed to use m&amp;kb on another online game and get perma-banned from that for the same reason, Sony will perma-ban your PSN account 
---
Don’t you mean this week?
---
Conversely, smacking a Myers or Huntress in the teeth with a pallet is still one of the most hilariously satisfying activities one can partake in.
---
“You *will* wear our membership jacket Jeff...”
---
Almost nothing affects mending 
---
On the bright side of the killer change target, he can't be called out for "tunneling"
---
He is, while simultaneously being the most broken.
---
Lol they say it's bannable but nobody does anything about it anyway. It's impossible for the console to tell that it's kbm when you're using an adapter, so no one gets punished for it. 
---
Besides, the PS4 is technically kbm supported, its just that there's only a small handful of games that actually utilize it.
---
They don't talk about the skillcheck usually, they talk about continuing a loop so you can benefit the most out of it. Still, great that they are changing it.
---
Nope, the PTB started last week on Wednesday and most of time they release the chapter to the public two weeks after the PTB. So probably next week!
---
Swf
---
damn thats gonna be interesting
---
I like to play street fighter on it and it's fine with max brightness 
---
Gonna need a source for that one
---
would help if ya said which survivor
---
I thought it was one week. Oh well, one more week of waiting. Thanks for the info! :)
---
I have had less trouble lately with hem, people seem to be taking the "just cleanse totems"  to heart and now i find cleansing it more reliable as a team, even with randoms.
---
jane’s hella disgusting, i’d even take laurie over jane
---
Op seems to be on a dislike spree here with any comment they don't like. Keep at it you wonderful being.
---
Imo he's not good and simultaneously the most annoying to play against
---
One time I got 5 stacks on Lullaby with Unnerving omega-terror radius Doc on Shelter Woods.
---
I still haven't recovered my hearing.
---
I thought so as well, but it happened 
---
Because they aren't fun to go against at all, due largely in part to having no counterplay, which comes from having no downsides. And I'm not the only one that thinks so evidently. 
---
Sorry you need your hand held to understand things. But I'm not a crossing guard so please don't inconvenience me with having to tend to you. 
---
Thats false. Overwatch, Destiny/Destiny 2, DBD (now that the ban system works on console), and cod games all have systems that can detect if youre using m&amp;kb. OW and Destiny/Destiny 2 are very strict on the rule. The others are pretty strict but rely more on other players to report it
---
has never happened to me, unlucky
---
Oh god yeah 😂
---
wtf claudette
---
is it possible to be a worse teammate?
---
Mmm, I don't believe so. I'm pretty sure it works the same way as just plugging in your KBM to a PS4 through the USB ports- it works only on a small, small handful of games that have it enabled and the home screen.
---
I could be wrong on that one, but usually KBM adapters have you plug the controller into the adapter, which is what fools it into believing you're still using it- as your controller is plugged into the system.
---
The way the game is right now, dc punishment should not even be a passing thought as long as most of the following are a thing:
---
*Killers trapping people in the basement or other places until they dc, know this is used to wait out BT at some cases, but trapping someone for a minute and more should not be a thing, they can tweak it accordingly.
---
*Spawning on parts of the map that get you stack (rather rare but still happening)
---
*Getting stack on something while playing. This mostly goes to killers, and yes the survivors can do gens and escape, but we should not be left at the mercy of randoms that have all the time in the world.
---
*Games that start with 3 or less survivors, nobody wants to play against a killer at such a disadvantage.
---
*Survivors reaching spots the killer can't get them on until the killer either dc's or goes afk hoping the survivor has not done the same and actually escapes at some point.
---
Ikr I literally figured that out the other day I was shook 
---
Doesn't matter how good or bad he is, or if I survive without being downed once.  As a survivor - He's simply boring at best, annoying at middling, and obnoxious at worst.
---
Hahahaha
---
"..., you?"
---
I bring mine in to give to someone else because I am so bad at them and when I prestige I like to use up as much as I can from their items and offerings. 
---
Well that's unfortunate. Although it's good that the community is learning how to counter shit. DS was completely unable to be countered by the killer but most other perks can be
---
So you repost your OWN video to get more upvotes? Pathetic. 
---
Not going to paste the whole description but this is from the Amazon page and it seems like it's for getting ahead/advantage in a a game. 
---
"The TAC Pro's mechanical keypad and mouse bring PC style controls to PS4 and PS3 systems. Designed specifically for FPS games, features include keypad or analog stick movement, and programmable user profiles. "
---
A lot of the comments are basically ''Why use mori and not let self entitled survivors get their bloodpoints with the token they chose?'' - Like bitch it's a gamble. You're not entitled to have the killer work with you and let you use it just like the killer gambled mori it doesn't mean they can complain too if they don't get to use it x'D
---
??? Where are you getting your numbers from? I was absolute trash back when I played OW on console (First FPS on console and PC) and I still made straight gold, and from what I know on the PC scene, majority of the player base is Gold/Plat, and with what I remember from the PS4 scene, the higher you go, the more KBM users you see.
---
Internal cooldown that isn’t exhaustion. Hell, single use would be better 
---
That's not what I'm saying at all, actually. 
---
Wow this is so realistic (for being modeled from a game character!) i thought it was a super high definition render of the Wraith. I’m super impressed!!!
---
I'm aware. This comment was meant to be a joke. 
---
This. \^ &lt;3
---
Please see above meme for my opinion of you 
---
Ty for the tip fam--Will consider!
---
No 
---
us plebs with our superior fps and extra content ^_^
---
This is under key features too 
---
"Officially Licensed by Sony. The TAC Pro emulates DualShock analog input and as such will not respond as a 1:1 mouse on games that do not support native mouse input"
---
Im going off of a lot of the complaints I see as well as whats reported in the few trusted youtuber videos out there
---
Yep. It can be really inconvenient if you do it over a Pallet, too. The Trapper has to actively risk walking into their own traps or take the long way around. 
---
When you hear breathing behind you and you fearfully pan the camera over to reveal a myers stalking you.
---
And you're getting down voted because you're a crybaby bitch that keeps crying about character that has weaknesses that you don't want to learn how to counter. Cry more. 
---
Finally other people in this sub realizing sc bad perk. 
---
I think they're just trying to be helpful but in a backhanded sort of way. *Shrug* Just noticed they tend to favor survivor complaints instead.
---
If only there was a duo killer mode... I could Hillbilly chainsaw those guys for you.
---
I know. Good luck with that.
---
But the timer ensures survivors have to spend time mending or fall down. This seems like it's no different from a regular hit. 
---
Healing points is an unfortunate side effect, but without the instaheal in the fountains only complete idiots would use the fountains because it wouldn’t be worth it. Killer could trend towards boring if that happens.
---
My only real issue is the fact that being hurt (infected) from the green puke doesn’t give you the speed boost like when you get injured from other killers. That’s a problem, cause as you described it’s too easy to just keep vomiting and then smack them with the regular attack
---
Well, I'd be tempted to think Myers hates him too, but then I remember how utterly lack he is for emotion. 😅
---
*Cries in alert*
---
More annoying than Hag? More annoying than spirit? 
---
I just dont see it
---
As to the second point, Corrupt Intervention will block 3 of the 4 gens in your example.
---
WGLF stacks
---
You're interpreting too much into this. The gear sphere is nothing else but the representative icon for Survivors, like the triangle skull is for Killers. The icon is derived from either side's main objective.
---
Sure. But it beats running around the map not healed because someone else wasn’t around
---
There is literally no way for them to know that someone is using a mouse and keyboard and I highly doubt even a single person has ever been banned for it. 
---
Đêm juicy wglf stacks? Honestly I don't know, I try to finish what I am doing before I unhook if I am playing survivor 
---
Yeah I get what you're saying. Those debuffs are usually removed when healed, whereas my version would persist while the deep wound stacks remained. If they devs can think of a better way to fix moon-walking I'm all for it.
---
When I run into the unhooked and the unhooker I usually down the unhooked and leave them and chase and down the person who unhooked. This is way more optimal. You have the unhooked downed not doing gens, have the unhooker getting chased and downed, and if the team is willing to help then you have 1-2 people coming to pick up the unhooked. Essentially making progression come to a halt.
---
If someone wants to be a camper or tunneler that  is not more optimal. They will say well this is my job or whatever but just like in the real world just because someone has a job doesnt mean they do it well or optimally. I also like the WGLF guy to get punished vs the person who they unhooked. It's not their fault the guy unhooked at a bad time.
---
I think you've got the two mixed up
---
Legion, because even if I die I at least get to say I died to someone who doesn’t look like a sausage left too long on the grill
---
Unless it’s Frank.
---
Frank can choke.
---
That’s not true. Many killers go into a game with their strategy being to proxy camp hooks and wait for an unhook. These are the ones who may not be standing right in front of the hook, but they are always watching it and just patrol a certain range. Some may just call this camping though, I’m not sure. 
---
Whaaaaaaat?
---
Claudette is one with the shadows
---
I don't get why people complain when there's 3 killer whose powers are literally just being able to one hit you. 
---
Yes, but pc has access to it on the ptb. OP was referring to when it would come out for people without access to the ptb
---
Both of them are XD, claudette and killer insidious. Still sick one
---
Yeah, selfish care is the definition of a crutch perk. Its absolutely unnecessary but a huge portion of the survivor playerbase cant imagine playing the game without it. Some of yall are still stuck in 2017. 
---
When killers complain about it it just betrays their lack of ability. 
---
Let me in! LET ME INNNNNNNN
---
Oh yeah, most high tier PS4 OW players who use KBM admit it. They can't get banned on PS4 or XB1 because there's not really a way for the system to tell if you're using a controller or not. Imo I agree though- they should just let people use whatever peripherals they want.
---
I'm not top sure on how XB1 works (I own a PS4 myself) but I think even with the console supporting it, I'm not sure if the OW game itself supports it on the console. Because I think both PS4 and XB1 are KBM supported, it's just a matter of the Devs taking advantage of it. (Could be wrong about the XBOX side though. I don't keep up with that scene in any way, shape or form. Just basing it on what I know from PS4.)
---
Legion, for certain. I get too many dipshits who think they can disrespect Freddy and end up fucking the whole team over.
---
Theres been quite a few cases of bans for m&amp;kb. They use the same system to search for m&amp;kb usage as whats used to search for modders and hackers. They search for unusual statistics that shouldn't be possible such as camera movement speed and such.
---
Look at those smiles, they love her salt.
---
I love when that happens cos it's the days I get paid xD
---
How many guaranteed safe pallets spawn on the game?
---
Once you figure out the number you'll see why Game is a survivor sided map. You can easily loop most killers for 4-5 gens on Game.
---
It's over Amandakin. I have the high beam
---
I’d say adrenaline was a still a powerful perk. It can save your ass in a chase, and if I’m at injured at 2 gens it lets me pump out those 2 gens and I know I’ll be healed for it.
---
I need more lore stuff like this. And I would love if this was a thing. I always want to get that toolbox!!! Does anyone have any screenshots of where the other toolboxes are on other maps?
---
&gt; I'm one of the killer mains who despises NOED
---
&gt; 
---
*"I'm not like other girls."*
---
I think it says in his power description that he's immune to having his aura seen in tier 1
---
Ok. I just walk around as the Trapper.
---
ya, but I mean... if youre hiding outside of his terror radius you probably arent going to survive anyway because you arent doing anything...
---
Quick and quiet comes in so clutch a lot of the time! Great sneaks there
---
Same!!!
---
his tummy is satisfied 
---
Lol. I still am
---
I don't know truthfully, I never ran into a trapper and killer queues were impossible.
---
Also, the chapter will more than likely release a week after the ptb ends.
---
Say it again for the people in the back!
---
No, seriously, it's tiring hearing that I'm a dickhole because I'm punishing survivors for what they aren't supposed to do--Which is being overly altrusitic. I'll try to go after the person who unhooked the survivor instead, but sometimes it turns out to be a David, and well... The other person is nearby.
---
sometime this week or next 
---
some people have said 19th 
---
sorry i dropped it and random ran away with it 
---
The entity: No you aint.
---
'Poof" 
---
That's cool. You're a rarity, in my experience anyone bothering to bring a flashlight is going to use it as much as possible and as annoyingly as possible.
---
Dead hard is by far the easiest countered exhaustion perk.
---
wglf stacks or dailys
---
Bloodpoints. Even if you mostly play survivor, killers get more bloodpoints. 
---
Hey, or lack of friends to play with lmao.
---
First of all, there is a meme about Claudette being the "sneaky" survivor, since her default model is the hardest to see (and on a map like swamp, she's almost invisible).
---
There's nothing wrong with stealth, on the sole assumption that you're actually being useful, i.e. gravitating towards an objective.  
---
But since there's quite a lot of killer perks and addons that reveal survivor locations, most experienced players tend to just run around to save time. And time is everything in this game, since the faster you complete gens, the lower is your team's probability of dying.   
---
There are exceptions of course, like Nurse or Spirit - it's better to hide from them because they're really, really good at chases. But vs. Wraith or Freddy, you can't hide from what you can't see. 
---
Stealth is a legitimate strategy. It's just that looping is better, and if you're not getting into many chases, you probably won't be good at looping, and will go down quickly when you're found out. Not "if", but "when".
---
I may have gone too much into detail, but I hope this answers your questions. 
---
I will try, but on Ormond it is behind a boarded hallway. The boards has some graffiti on it. And there is a very small gap where you can see something golden. On Yamaoka it is under the outside floor thing.
---
DS is not hard on console... It is just as much of a bitch as on PC. 
---
u/v_redditbot
---
Oh my God Tapp the Pigs right behind you!
---
You can see that with LoL, Dota, CS series in general. Nature of semi-competetive multiplayer team games.
---
Sometimes I'm not in the mood to play against SWF and it can be hard to tell whether or not a lobby is. 
---
That's not really helping your case here, bud
---
Lol
---
Wglf
---
I burned one Smoking Sphincter (or whatever it's called), for the rare chance of playing Freddy with no perks or addons. Can't say it was fun, but definitely unique! The massive, eye-scorching bloom in his dream world was kinda irritating. 
---
use something that needs the controller also plugged in to emulate it 
---
or else you run the risk of being banned from fps games for "cheating" yet modded controllers with extra bttns and shit are ok. you can see how salty people are from watching youtube videos of people reviewing things like these for console and the comments are spammed about it not being fair 
---
it might be Officially Lc by sony but that doesn't mean "Games" are ok with it 
---
I actually run into people saying that shit btw I'm on console. I'm not scared of some childish game. And like I said I'm trying to state that both sides killer and survivors r both equally toxic. It depends on how I play. I don't run only survivor as the game gets boring doing so so I run killer. And nice English who taught but putting terrible 2 times is not proper. Stop tryna turn the post on me u r the one being toxic look how your talking to me lol I'm just letting u know how I play and u don't believe me just like a toxic player they lie there ass off cause they lost. Ur one of the people that ruin our community by dividing the players into 2 different categories. So stfu and stop trying to manipulate what I'm trying to tell u.
---
u/vreddit_bot
---
I find female survivor players to be the most toxic. Jakes, Davids, and Jeffs are mostly chill.
---
For killer, usually Nurse/Billy/LF.
---
"low quality"
---
"an hour"
---
Honestly I die too often because Adrenaline uses my exhaustion and I don’t have any defense against NOED killer. I wish it didn’t heal you off hook so I could stop using it. 
---
When you get the “bing” noise it’s usually always right in front of you behind something 
---
Honestly, I understand why people dislike him but he’s not nearly as bad as everyone thinks. Yes Legion is a twat but they’re manageable 
---
This is a renaissance painting. 
---
You're right it makes more sense on paper to simply kill them off however I applaud the man for playing killer the way he does.  I'm a killer main myself and I feel like there is a right way and a wrong way to go about playing my games.  I try my hardest not to tunnel people recently unhooked.  Occasionally I'll find a more potato survivor who was just unhooked almost immediately and I'll usually slug them so they can get another chance myself.  I think games should be fun and competitive for both sides.  While tunneling at times is the easier play I just feel like it's a crutch approach to playing the role of killer.  There's room to play fair and still fucking destroy your opponents.  Especially with where the games balance is right now for killers.
---
Yeah, the emblems don't work well on the PTR right now, but I'm sure they notice and will change it for the final relese. After all, that's what the PTR is for. In general, I think it could be a good change to make ranking up harder, since at least in my experience you rank up very fast even if the games don't go that well.
---
I mean... at least if you suicide, there is still a chance of changing your mind at some point. 
---
Maybe even a mental thing for your team, he struggled at the end, sure he died on hook, but at least he didn’t dc in despair
---
Either way... dcing, even if you don’t like the killer, is a shitty punk ass move.  
---
Sprint burst doesn’t depend on the killer having precise connection.
---
Yesssssssss my dude. And also, if the unhooked survivor is dead on next hook, why shouldn't the killer try their best to hook them again and eliminate them from the game? It's a huge advantage to have less survivors in the match.  
---
People saying "don't tunnel" may as well be saying "don't chase, down me and then hook me".  
---
It's so childish, and I hate seeing fellow team mates spewing toxic abuse at the killer in matches where they feel they've been "tunnelled". I always step in and try to explain this point of view but some people just don't want to accept responsibility for losing.
---
It seems silly, but you could try quicker cooldown addons such as cold dirt, along with anti pallet perks (Enduring, Spirit Fury and even Brutal Strength if you want to be ‘that guy’, also, mindgames.
---
Fuck these edgey pubescent fucks
---
Need a Monkees song like the Scooby chases
---
It's even more hilarious when they put Borrowed Time in there, just stop camping dude holy shit.
---
You're not wrong, but ever since the exhaustion nerf, I just don't think it's good enough. I will always use DH over SB.
---
Legion main #9000, here to explain to us legion being weak doesn’t mean he’s ungodly poorly designed designed, unfun to play against, and terrible for the game as a whole for numerous reasons. 
---
That's... What I was saying too? They didn't say anything about the PTB, but like I said before, according to the post I read previously, they mentioned it being released on all platforms at one time. 
---
Add me: Rex4Fun and let’s look for it
---
Member when self care was viable? I member. 
---
At this point in the games balance if you're finding yourself getting shit on as killer you're either not playing properly or simply up against much better opponents.  Survivors are about as far from OP as can be at this point.  The updates over the past 8 months saw to that.  Playing killer is fun again.  PS4 swf queues have been broke for ages, it's the reason I play as much killer as I do at this point.
---
I only tunnel in specific situations like if someone gets unhooked In front of me by a healthy survivor with DS if would be stupid you go after the DS as it is a waste of time
---
What was he even thinking playing out-of-character like that? Vest Tapps should act like the beacon of justice even if it costs their lives. Now I need to ask him to return his badge.
---
^Source: ^Am ^a ^Tapp ^main ^myself.
---
That’s the smart play... bonus points if you smack the rescuer and still hook the guy again. 
---
If you take people out of the game early, it’s a huge advantage....  
---
So strategically, it’s the best thing to do, especially if you have a known survivor or two, also trying to save the person. Because now you also know they are wasting time. 
---
I guess I just don't think that so called "tunnelling" is an unfair tactic (so long as the killer isn't camping, that is) \*shrug\* If someone is unhooked, sprints to the nearest vault point, does a quick fault, sprints some more and then hides in an obvious place to heal, and the killer follows those very obvious auditory and visual clues to where they are and downs them again and takes them out of the match then I'm afraid the survivor has only themselves to blame. Complaining about tunnelling is in my opinion something that less skilled or experienced players will do because they don't understand how they could have played better to avoid being found by the killer.
---
This lol. Outside of high rank swf all the cards are basically in the killers hands at this point. 
---
Done!
---
You’re the hero we need but don’t deserve 
---
This wasn't about Survivors OP, but about Killers getting insulted in post game chat no matter how you play. 
---
Exactly, the fault is with the rescuing survivor for unhooking their teammate at the wrong time.
---
Hmm thats weird, it still shows as 100 on my ps4
---
This doodle will now be corrected: "Bing Bong". Your doodle has now been corrected. Thanks and have a great day.

The exterior wall of a map and and the location of major structures (ie the Coal Tower, or in Lery's in the central room) is static. There can be some variations at major structures (X window may be open or closed, Y pallet may be here or over there) but they're much more static than the random assortment of walls you'll find.
---
Lery's randomization is mostly in which doors and which windows are open or closed. For the Game it's boxes and the small wall segments. The overall layout of those two maps is probably the most static of the maps, but where pallets are and what areas you can access through where do still change. The Game also feels extra static cuz there's only the one place for the Basement, where every other map has two possible places.

I'm a nerd who plays on console so maybe this is just part of the new map and I don't know yet, but how the heck did that locker setup happen? I feel like six lockers set up next to each other like that is not supposed to happen.
---
I wanna farm you for WGLF stacks
---
Yeah I just randomly send a GG or wp or some love ya ! 
---
And more than often I get a positive reply , we all should try that! It makes the other person think to themselves that "I think I am overreacting about this situation" 
---
It's a good tactic which promotes postivity
---
Honestly, I hope they update Leatherface's potential faces. I'd kill for an Aceface.
---
The issue with Legion is that he's basically guaranteed at least 1 or 2 kills, but he'll never get more than that versus competent players. It makes him irritating to play against because the whole team won't get out and there's no real counter play inside a chase.

UwU edgy boy Feng Min knows where you live UwU

sometimes my friends and i have to equip our stuff at the last second to get a killer not to dodge us. this is even in lobbies with killers that are red rank. like, how did you get up so high if your afraid of a tool box &amp; a med kit. 
---
Thats why both sides shouldn’t see each other, will kill lobby dodging 100% 
---
Holy shit

Hehe hillbilly is for 9 year olds confirmed
---
From what I can tell, that locker set up is legit. Every time I've been on that map so has that tile.
---
And when you approach.. *Bing bong!*
---
Yeah... No. Don’t characterize people who play a role in a game as having a personality disorder, that’s a seriously messed up assumption.
---
The real reason why a lot of killers act like dicks is because the game creates and perpetuates that behavior. It causes a ‘you vs them’ kind of feeling. Survivors experience the same thing, it’s why you get a lot of BM from survivors, like teabagging at the exit gates or behind pallets.
---
This is ALSO a common behavior in multiplayer games as a whole. Example: Overwatch. Sombra canceling your well timed ult feels toxic as hell and extremely personal, but she’s just doing her job. &amp; a widowmaker that’s constantly shooting you in the head &amp; sending you back to spawn does NOT have a personality disorder. You don’t either, if you feel personally attacked. Multiplayer games just do that to people. 
---
Yea it’s unfortunate that it’s unfair to the rest of the team.  I won’t argue you there.  But I’m not gunna run around and mend/heal for the whole prolonged, interminable trial.  That’s a chore.

I think a reworking is in order. Perhaps if more ppl d/c’d they’ll rework him faster.

---
Exactly how I feel. In the end, it's just a game!
---
It doesn’t make sense. Please don’t lend credit to a harmful suggestion that people who play a role in a game have a personality disorder. People are just competitive by nature &amp; DBD is a frustrating experience that amplifies that.

you can test against your own IP address or any site, I use google for the stability, or use this persons method, just test your ping before hosting, idc how its done, this is a simple way I use.
---
Yeah that would be the place to do it! It would be way better if you could gather the info in the format I describe above, but just sending screenshots helps out alot too!
---
It’s fine, just needs to use more lube
---
niice, just looked at that video. thnx for info

Fucking perfect

This is so sad. Can we press F?

&gt; don't have enough skill to dominate everyone high rank
---
I mean his ability is basically "I don't want to bother learning how to play killer", if you ever want to get good I'd recommend trying someone else, unless his ability is changed or improved.

“The monster sees in 1st person, not all around”
---
&gt;Am I the only one to notice this about Spirit
---
Do you genuinely believe that?  
---
That no one noticed something that obvious? 
---
I posted the results, see my latest post!
---
That's weird.
---
Oh did not realize that been using them the past few weeks wondering why even on the swamp maps they still weren’t having problems finding my traps in the dirt.
---
I love it.
---
Speaking of Scoobert Doobert, I could definitely see Legion's walk cycle in tandem with this https://youtu.be/yUz9kFm_zbc
---
They can’t be looped while in frenzy and you can still stun them with pallets it only gets rid of them once the pallet is down, you can’t use it as barrier anymore. While in chase your timer isn’t going down (moonwalking should be fixed) so you can still lose them once their power runs out. 
---
I’m not saying it works every time but I’ve escaped plenty of legions and majority of the time they stab and move on to the next survivor so they just slow the game down since everyone has to mend. I’m rarely downed by a moonwalking franks/dirt combo and rarely go down from deep wound running out.
---
"Gens? What are gens? I'm pretty sure the only objectives are to t-bag the Killer and sandbag Survivors before hopping out that trap door-thingie." -Claudette Morel, probably

Got more kills when I tried no blink nurse then I do in a normal nurse game 😂
---
y?
---
Most popular- Claudette and Billy

Least popular- Quentin and legion

"The guy on the hook must be confused"
---
Happy microphone day
---
Lol it’s a joke. In the previous post yesterday (this same gif but without music), someone also commented the guy on the hook must’ve seen the guy get in and out of lockers. And then a guy commented that the monster doesn’t see in 3rd person and got downvoted for it
---
not surprised or shocked at all.  With that being said, I want play Bill more now, forget the Clown though haha
---
That's pretty good, I wish I'd thought of it!
---
Also: r/dadbydaylight
---
How do killers want the survivors to play?
---
Simple. 
---
Killers do not want to play ONE game of 1v4. Killers want to play SEVERAL games of 1v1 where they are faster and more powerful than the other person, and where the other person isn’t getting any assistance. 
---
They don’t want Survivor teams that can coordinate and work together, because that’s no fun to them. The second they get a whiff that they’re up against and actual team, they’ll camp, tunnel, and play all the lame, dirty tricks they can to ‘secure’ a kill. Or they’ll simply DC. 
---
When people make these memes and still include flashlights, self-care, and now reworked DS.
---
honourable mentions to Dead Hard, BNP, Borrowed Time, and Unbreakable
---
Not just every survivor
---
The only thing that’s needed to reduce complaints against Legion is counterplay. No one likes knowing there’s literally nothing they can do to not go down once in chase. Literally anything in terms of counterplay would suffice.
---
My idea: being able to vault windows/pallets at the same time. I know it wouldn’t make sense visually, but it’s something. It would involve skill and mind games faking out vaults trying to time it up with the Legion to avoid getting hit.
---
&gt;I'll continue to do what I want
---
Being a phaggot. That's what it seems like. 
---
I'd rather dc and get into another game with hopefully no legion in it instead of playing vs something as uninteractive as legion.
---
That's funny the first time you see it, not the 50th
---
How do people always recognise who it is? Twitch?
---
GO BACK TO THOMPSON CITY WHERE YOU BELONG.
---
At higher ranks you just get killers close enough to start sniffing your hair before they make the swing.
---
Mid ranks you do it once then they start doing it.
---
Fool I got reversed
---
Did the discussion end or something? He makes a good point.
---
Yeah, it's not about winning/surviving.
---
You can win against a 3 gen hostage doc with unnerving/overcharge/distressing/sloppy butcher/double calm add ons. Will it take 20+ minutes? Yeah. Will you win? Yeah. Are you having any fun during it? Not in the slightest.
---
Same with Prayer beads/Iridescent Head/Omegablink &amp; ebony mori. Can you win? Most likely. Are you having any fun in the videogame? Most likely not.
---
Players like this must be in a different rank bracket than I play in.  The vast majority of the Claudettes I've played against have either been mad on gens or really effective dedicated unhookers/healers.
---
Oh yeah and abusing DS is okay ain't it?
---
YAFP
---
You still get into chases normally, can interact with them, hit them, down them. You can counterplay them. Legion doesn't interact with you, your input in the chase doesn't matter. You will go down after the first hit no matter what you do, you're on a timer.
---
DS is getting reworked so it's not even relevant anymore.
---
SWF and you all use it. I seen it many a time. Also looping is bs
---
They must have set their fov as like 10
---
Please explain. What makes you think that it's double standard to complain about Legion?
---
Proxy camping in certain situations is fine imo otherwise it can hurt you since you aren’t putting pressure on the survivors. 
---
So say I have 3 gens close to each other and one gen way off on the other side of the map. If I down someone by the 3 I’ll hook the survivor right in between the 3 gens and just let that one gen go. That way I’m forcing the survivors to 3 gen themselves and stall the game while being able to make it hard for them to make the save. 
---
The more pressure I can put on them the better so me walking to the other side of the map makes it easier for them and that would be considered proxy camping even if I’m patrolling the 3 gens close to each other at the same time
---
Hey, just because Legion can be super annoying doesn't mean we all suck! :\[
---
Also can we stop with all these Legion-hate memes? I think everyone knows that they have a sucky power by now; and if they don't they can ask.
---
Sorry Bubba &lt;3
---
Overwatch is an prime example because theres more cases of bans for m&amp;kb because of the games competitive nature. Its happened with cod, destiny/destiny 2, as well as others.
---
Is joke
---
Doing a good job so far. 
---
I hate to be this passive aggressive but iyou perceive wraith as bad because you dont ( or I assume) don't play him much, even with out ultra rare add-ons I can consistently get 3-4 k's.  Wraith is viable, so much so I got to rank 4 with just him without noed and without ultra rare add-ons, infact I consider the combcoxxed/ghost build to be fun option rather than necessary. But if you can counter feel free, I main wraith and swear by him, but please consider my arguments and opinions
---
So people dont like that legion is basically the nurse? The nurse is a guaranteed 2-4 kills as well
---
Ahhh, then let that be for the toxic survs
---
Most likely next Tuesday but hey if they’re ballsy enough it could be tomorrow or Thursday but I highly doubt it
---
Don't think the ptb is over yet. Normally comes out a week or two after it ends.
---
They dont line up with how you worded them oof
---
Don’t do gens and run in a straight line. 
---
Lol wow I have no words
---
Cause y'all complain about OP killer but while being toxic at the same time
---
Nurse is not toxic lmao
---
Delieverance is a lifesaver when the killer is gone but nobody wants to save me.
---
Now that I've played, learned, and seen more in this game, I think Self Care is actually not very good. You could just bring a medkit.
---
I run both
---
Urban and is my favorite perk in the game lol (and I main killer for the most part)
---
no, even in this case it's best for the killer to, on principle, leave the unhooked person alone, instead going after the good Samaritan (thats what u GET, nice person!). or, best of all: just hook everyone once for BBQ, never more. everyone wins. happy happy fun time
---
Urban Evasion, Empathy, Kindred, and an exhaustion perk (Lithe or Balanced Landing for me)
---
I think you have the hurt feelings record of 2019 so far, OP. I don't think I've seen such a big survivor freak out yet this year
---
It's not unviable, but it feels like a huge time sink, especially when sloppy butcher/mangled add-ons are so meta. It's a lot of time you could've been using saving someone, working on gens, or finding totems. People don't like it because it comes off as selfish, I guess.
---
That said, healing is useful and being uninjured is pretty important, especially when running the killer. It's a tough balance.
---
It's definitely not as strong as it used to be . The amount of time you waste healing yourself , especially If the killer can inflict mangled on you, makes you waste so much time to do it .  If the killer is tunneling you most of the game it wont help in a chase .  Takes alot of time away from the gens . If the killer (picking common perks ) has like sloppy and thanatiphobia you'll be self healing yourself stupidly ridiculously slow.  
---
If you are being serious, ignore this. If you are being sarcastic, sorry, i don't like running around a circle for 5 minutes to then run around another circle for 5 minutes.
---
Good to know because that scared me to death and I don't wanna experience that again.
---
I don't always have enough BP and/or the bloodweb hates me and/or chests hate me
---
!!! ikr
---
I never ran it and probably never will, I don't see the appeal. Medkits are a dime a dozen on the bloodweb, and teammates are alright enough at healing when and if the medkit runs out.
---
I'm not dedicating 25% of my perks toward something I can get out of an item.
---
thats not the best strategy... for being nice!
---
:thonk:
---
well, I do understand that it takes a lot of time. that's why i only do it in specific situations where i'm not better off doing something else
---
She is strong but still not as good as a person who knows how to use the nurse so I think it’s fine. 
---
I main Feng min (she is bae) and I run
---
Urban evasion, self care, lithe(or dead hard) and unbreakable or borrowed time 
---
unless you have botany also self caring without a med kit is slower than just letting someone else heal you.
---
this is why some people have leader so the healing is done faster.
---
i stopped using self care due to amount of times my survivor would stop to "self care" as i was attempting to drop a pallet or rescue someone off the hook.
---
try a couple games without it see how your playstyle changes if its better there you go, if not change it back nothing lost 
---
haha I had a conversation with a buddy the other day where I was just finishing a match and he walked into my house and I was said "man I love this game" and he goes "really? Because you complain about it a lot and seem like you hate it" and I was like "also yes"
---
Winner Winner Trapper Dinner!
---
Ok.
---
omg the gays in this thread are living
---
someone said maybe the 19th, so i'm saying DEFINITELY NO LATER THAN THAT. /obsessed
---
Should be next week. I've been hearing it'll be next Tuesday.
---
Lol you’re not wrong
---
Most of the time, I don’t tunnel and such just because I don’t really care to win, more so have fun and get bloodpoints
---
But if I’m actually playing to win, it is the smart play 
---
Killers are toxic to other people too?
---
How does the game having something that is unbalanced and unfair to play against has anything to do with some people being toxic? We're talking about game balance, not community toxicity.
---
You have to get good with Nurse before you start getting kills and a nurse can still be mind gamed, hidden from, and juked at most ranks. Legions rarely get 3-4 kills vs decent players, but 1 kill is practically unavoidable.
---
LETS GO ACE MAINS!!! We aren't the least popular survivor anymore!
---
BOO
---
Alr thanks for keeping me posted!
---
Who’s the artist of the picture? 
---
Actually vaccines bring plagues of autism you degenerate snowflake /s
---
This is basically it. Every heal, self-care or no, costs nearly half a gen.
---
Right after rank reset, when high ranks are really sweaty, I see teams who never heal until adrenaline pops, because avoiding healing each other generally raises your chance of surviving, ironically enough.
---
That said, self-care is definitely still meta if you want to stay healed, and most people do.
---
Soon(tm)
---
Looping and ds are part of the game.  Looping wastes the killer's time and ds is so overstated.  As a killer main, ds just buys a survivor an extra 10-15 seconds before another down and subsequent d/c. 
---
It was my first time seeing it. 
---
What? Dude you missunderstood me xD Im a nurse main, i used the second part to justify me playing nurse over other killers, because i don't like getting ran around a shitty box for half the game.
---
&gt; your input in the chase doesn't matter 
---
That's exactly how it feels to face 4 skilled SWF Survivors with Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, and Insta-Heals. Sure you might get a couple of hooks, but the Survivors get two more tries after being hooked. Not every SWF or toxic SWF is like this, but you asked for a comparable feeling while playing as Killer and I'm providing one.
---
Yes it is, and here's hoping Legion will be reworked soon too.
---
Min and Rin being statistically most popular feels correct 
---
People have complained about nurse forever, and then behavior turned around and made a nurse than any idiot can master in 2 games 
---
I perfer If I heard nothing when slugged. Maybe after like 20 seconds the music stops if u arent being carried?
---
*Cackles in Urban Evasion*
---
Others have already replied stating what these are but I'm assuming you're pretty new to the game; you definitely learn to recognize them as you go on. I'm only 200 hours in but I already know most perks and offerings in the game by their icons. Since they normally (somewhat) depict what they do, it's not too hard to associate them with their corresponding function.
---
Thank god you used the right version of You're
---
Judging by my knowledge of Yokai, she is probably an Onryo, which are people who died with intense emotions and when they die their soul can't pass on and instead transforms into a vengeful spirit. IE, the Grudge. In any version of the movies you watch, she is brutally murdered by her husband. The Spirit was slashed and stabbed by her father, so she's going through the varying emotions of shock and surprise due to being killed by her own dad.
---
Not sure how survivors play on PC but on PS4 they are 99% nice. I just run up to one and teabag them and they immediately start healing me. It's much quicker than healing myself and if I dont see a teammate I can work on gens or go find a chest real quick. 
---
I also suck at chases and get downed pretty easily so honestly rather have perks that can help me escape otherwise what's the point of self care for me. 
---
even w borrowed time an unhooked survivor doesnt wanna be immediately chased after an unhook
---
I run adrenalin in a SWF and Self-care in solo.
---
Nurse's calling being in play has always made it less viable, and deep wound has further reduced its viability as a perk. Same will go for playing against plague since her vomit can put you into broken state, unable to be healed by yourself or your team. 
---
I also have that perk that's gives you nicer stuff in chests. I'm lucky in that I get yellow and purple med kits quite a bit so any I don't use i bring into the next match. 
---
No that's really not what happens, you can get into multiple successful chases before adrenaline pops, you can chainsaw people to make their instaheal irrelevant, you can be really good at chases and make their 2nd chances mean nothing. 
---
Is it less enjoyable than playing vs some potatoes with bad perks? Sure. Do you not get to interact with the survivors? Not even close, chases will take longer but if you are better than them then they will lose to you.
---
With Frank's mixtape Legion you might as well stand still for all of that matters when you get in a chase with them. You can be a brainless potato and still down the best survivor player in the game that is playing with the best items and perks on the best survivor map once you get one hit on them. Your skill when playing against Legion means nothing and that's why it's the worst experience in DBD besides infinite loading screens.
---
Swf care is literally shit right now, and has been for a while. If you wanna heal yourself bring a medkit. 
---
Literally never worth it to take self care over another perk because in the time you heal yourself you could just do a gen and find a teammate 
---
*You talkin some mad shit for someone within Frenzy Distance*
---
***\*Pulls out Cold Dirt and Frank's Mixtape\****
---
So every perk is broken, because they all make no sense
---
Kamakazi bomber build. 
---
Dead Hard. Empathy. Tenacity. Unbreakable. You setup with empathy and when a survivor is picked up you kamakazi at killer and try and waste as many hits as possible. When you finally get downed you just hyper crawl away and by the time they come looking for you, you are long gone. 
---
I'm still confused why this hides him from Spine Chill and Premonition.
---
The point still remains that you actually have to ‘take’ the perk to use it, and you still have to be in the right place, and the killer still has to head to that hook. Those are any guarantees you can always have. But if you’re giving up generator time to set up some safety areas, then you should be rewarded as such. 
---
With every single ability there is in the game, there’s always the “What about when a team is swf?”
---
But you can balance a game based on that alone when so many people like myself rarely play SWF. 
---
Nevertheless, sure, a team of swf with option two are going to be hell, but that team wouldn’t be gen focusing either, and that’s going to hurt them, plus they’d  be giving up a perk slot that may be more useful to them. 
---
Right now though, sabotage is vastly underutilized. It’s ‘supposed’ to be an option in the game to save others, but as-is unless you got someone super dedicated to it, it’s a big waste of time. Because even with the buff I mentioned, you ‘still’ need to be in the right place at the right time ‘and’ have the perk to make any use of it. 
---
Ye 😂 no blinks I managed 2 kills. Normal game I get 1 usually. I suck at nurse 😂
---
I just wanted to shitpost :'(
---
Yeah definitely new, about 2 months, but still. Even killers I regularly use, I'm reading the add on descriptions. 
---
***Strongly Agree***
---
thanks
---
Because killers are scared of anything that isn’t a default Dwight 
---
I do my best not to use noed and all I get in return is teabagged at the end of the match for running a decent killer build, so every now and then I just go huntress with noed, if i'm gonna hit you at the exit gates you're damn well gonna be crawling out of that bitch, I hace no time for toxicity. 
---
Since both parties need to engage into it id fully agree. As far as doing something else goes, its your "risk" and the other can/might do so too, so i wouldnt add toxicity to the survivors "toxicity score" here either. 
---
Those comments from the survivor tho? What the fuck? How can anyone deny that they are a complete piece of shit? Bonus toxicity points for accusing them of being a Trump supporter/human garbage (why repeat an insult?), thats some realy low shit.
---
They confirmed in a stream a while back that Luck never affected chests. 
---
&gt; also, why is camping &amp; tunneling considered a viable game strategy in the view point of the devs, but being a stealthy survivor isn’t? (going back to the new pipping system where survivors will need to chase the killer in order to effectively pip)
---
Okay don't act like the system they're testing is only unfair to survivors lmao I've seen mountains of games where the killer gets a 4 man 4 gen and doesn't pip
---
lol that doesn't mean anything 
---
it takes a decent amount of vomit and a bit of a chase since they get sicker when they run
---
...Yes it does. It directly contradicts your claim. I don't know what you'd call 70 games per day every day if not experienced 
---
I would like to play with you because I’ve never met a good urban user 
---
Most popular killer - myers
---
Most popular survivor - claude or jeff
---
least popular killer - legion
---
least popular survivor - laurie
---
I wanna say it does from the times I've ran No Mither as a joke.
---
Haha yeah, but that is where Bond would come in isn't it? 
---
2 minutes blocking 3 gens is great on a lot killers, especially those with setup time. Infectious fright is good on plenty of killers and you can build around it. I don't know the time on Dark Devotion, it might be useless if it's too short.
---
Maybe you're just used to playing a certain way, I see a lot of promise with these perks depending on their final versions. 
---
Also having another perk combo with distressing is always fun
---
new legion perk: bloodhound's ultimate
---
Wasn't Legion supposed to disguise as other survivors, but they changed it last minute?
---
yeah it's quite sad because they're  one of his better and more interesting add ons, it's not a boring numbers add on and it rewards diligent survivors and punishes people for not paying attention. 
---
Or being on a dark map, like hadonfield/yamaoka's estate and preschool which are all very survivor sided maps.
---
Prove Thyself now has a 10% repair speed boost on survivors working on a generator in a 4 meter radius. It only effects repair speed and cannot be stacked with itself.
---
I think that you missed the point that 99% of people complaining about legion just need to get better at the game. If you coordinate as a survivor and use team work you shouldn't lose.
---
WeirdMadMan
---
Awesome!
---
Thanks for the update and conducting the survey :)
---
Idk the ability to inflict a health state seems pretty strong and combining this with the duration of it just increases this strength for me
---
I guess well have to wait and see though when it has its full release
---
There should be a survivor perk that lets them know how many totems are left. 
---
Yes she can inflict a health state if the survivor is puked long enough but that’s like saying the legions ability can inflict a health state. It’ll come down to those corrupt purge. I think it’ll be best if the survivor never cured himself.
---
3 months ago* this was before people learned of the bullshit that legion can do. 
---
Indeed
---
Saved just for this purpose. 
---
I play killer because I hate survivors and was born to serve the entity 
---
No i mean her ability levels up to make her a huntress as well
---
do you find you actually get use out of unbreakable? ive always avoided using it because it seems unlikely i’ll get slugged 
---
Can’t mindlessly pallet loop him? Legion takes nigh zero skill to play and is mindless to play. 
---
Ping isn’t always the best indicator of lag though, I’ve had green ping in lobbies and then gotten into game and teleported so bad I couldn’t even get to the gen I spawned next to
---
I main survivor just because I mainly play with my friends and I started off maining Meg because she was the first one I picked when we started playing before we "got serious" about leveling and learning the game and all that. So I used her for a while then Claudette because Self Heal and now I'm on Feng because I think I had to use her for a daily and just kept with her because she had a good set of perks on her. 
---
Now I do play Killer ever-so-often to do daily's but sometimes I'll play Killer just to play Killer and I'll usually go with Hag, because cancer, or Huntress because shes actually really fun to play as. Or I'll play as Wraithe just because. 
---
ngl I find that people who wear the bright cosmetics have a higher chance of turning out toxic. Especially if the whole group is wearing coordinated neon outfits, you know you gunna have a frustrating game
---
I don't know why they have ZERO downside like basically every other super strong addon in the game. It's fucking insane. Like what the fuck do you do? Gen tap?
---
prayer beads are annoying, not scary
---
That's what the beckon gesture one means ALSO* xD
---
That’s so overdone though, using the Scooby-Doo theme at least is specific to the locker use and feels more unique and interesting 
---
&gt;self-care
---
excuse me what the fuck
---
That’s the corrupt purge but it relies on survivors to cleanse themselves, what I’m saying is the survivors don’t really need to cleanse themselves unless they want to be stealthy.
---
It’s a strong 2nd chance perk. You don’t use it every time but when you do it’s awesome, nobody expects it. 
---
Sometimes I run the god combo of adrenaline dead hard unbreakable and ds but it gets a lot of hate and a lot of killers get owned so I change out ds for resilience. 
---
When I first got the game, I planned on maining killer but then I started playing with friends, so here I am.
---
Yes, survivor mains cry their eyes out because they can't pallet loop and t-bag like loser fucks.
---
Get better at the game or queue with 4 players and Legion wont be so difficult for you.
---
Pepperidge farm remembers
---
I suck with first person. And Wraith is definitely another scare the shit out of people killer. Hes so fun.
---
So what exactly did the survivor do that’s toxic? If the killers gonna stand on the hatch I’m not gonna stand there doing nothing when I can open something fun in another tab 
---
Recently I tried playing without NOED, which wasn’t too much of a problem in and of itself, but considering how fast games go without it and ruin, its no shocker how many people use it.
---
I really want to start playing Jeff soon. I love him.
---
I'm so tired of those wait times every time I want to play with my friends.
---
Freddy main because I love sleeping someone, hitting them, letting them go and think they’re safe just to sneak up and finish them off. (Monitor and abuse is nice for this tactic)
---
:D
---
Welcome to art. 
---
Ooh a freddy main that's fun. I never get to play with Freddy
---
Oh, I get 4ks frequently with Legion too, but that's because the survivors are stupid and clump together and hook dive. Survivors get cocky and hand the killer kills. Most survivors aren't nearly as good as they think they are. That's why I qualified my earlier comment with competent survivors. Those won't just hand out kills for free.
---
I don't remember the last time I had a 4-man escape vs Legion, but that may because so many survivors DC as soon as a Legion downs them.
---
Lmao 
---
finally people be woke
---
i haven't used self care since they fixed Iron Will...
---
We’re a rare breed apparently lol
---
No one cares about you having "fun".
---
You aren't having fun because it is challenging. 
---
Get gud / l2p
---
Get gud/ L2p
---
So I decided to have some fun today and went on a Mori-Spree with all my Killers that I play. The following is a (crudely edited, I know, but I just made this on the fly for the hell of it) short compilation of my favorite kills from today's massacre. 
---
Yeah you're not supposed to have fun in a videogame, nobody plays games for something as silly as "having fun".
---
There is nothing challenging about Legion, he's braindead.
---
You are just being a troll and not giving any valid arguments, I'll just hit ignore.
---
The proper way to do this is with Nurse with a 5 Blink set up, but you don’t hit anyone. You just mind fuck the shit out of them all game and you have ruin so the game actually lasts 3 minutes.
---
Yes, nothing like equipping 10 perks to deal with core game mechanic issues.  Good thing killers have so many more slots than everyone else. 
---
Just run Bond.  Most OP perk in the game.  No lies.
---
&gt; You can join your fuccboi Facebook groups and cry together on social media. You can make as many shitty low-effort memes that you want. But Legion's not going to get changed. Deal with it. Adapt. Stop crying.
---
Truly, this is all that needs to be said. 
---
Legion's here to stay, and no amount of bitching about how un-fun he is (we tried that one before with Freddy) is gonna change the fact that he's a part of the game you're just gonna have to get fuckin' used to.
---
Yh him and Jimmy fallon are the worst and really fucking irritating 
---
Yes. Yes i did. 😂
---
I mean, I stream DBD every once in a while and I always go to the other peoples stream after a match and GG's them or shoot the shit for a bit. I'll even follow if they're kind or sound interesting. I don't advertise but I want to at times...it's peoples attitudes like these that put me off on it. 
---
I can say for me personally-I go to their stream after matches and just say Hi. 
---
Lmao Looping is bs! Read that without laughing a little. 
---
....okkk....
---
Someone hasn’t had their vitamin gummies today. 
---
Nuse has been in the game for years and people have been complaining about her for years too. People still complain about her, Legion is just a newer bs addition and he doesn't even take any skill compared to the nurse.
---
I’ve done this with high and low frames and can confirm it’s better around 45-60
---
"uninteractive" 
---
lmao what does that even mean you are so stupid it hurts. 
---
You're about two chapters behind that revelation.
---
Cool picture by the way.

[legon bed giv mi 3 karma xd](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ay9qhx/when_you_make_a_new_original_meme_and_then_check/)
---
There is a golden toolbox in all maps tho.
---
I don't think there is any map without it.
---
It's just more of the mainstream Survivors have finally figured out that just getting gens done and leaving is the simplest way to beat every single killer in the game, and it's the one thing killers can't actually do much about.  No reason to heal when you can close out a game in 4 minutes or so, unless you really need to get someone off a hook right now. 
---
3k is not losing. 
---
Nea karlsons map doesn’t have one
---
[**P E W**](/intensifies)
---
My basic build tends to be Iron Will, Bond, Balanced Landing, and Adrenaline. That, or, if I'm in a mood to be lazy and try and avoid chases, I run a gen jockey/immersed build: Urban Evasion, Stake Out, Prove Thyself, Iron Will/Bond. 
---
I like my altruistic unhook build for when I was going for the unhook yourself fifty times achievement, always rushing the hook: Borrowed Time/We're Gonna Live Forever, Deliverance, Botany Knowledge, We'll Make It. 
---
Challenge Mode: Resilience, Tenacity, No Mither, and Iron Will. 
---
I also like doing random perk wheels. Can always come up with some interesting combos out of that. 
---
Hmmm... 
---
That's an...interesting concept :))
---
But they will end up in the broken status if they dont clense themselves 
---
It means that what you do in the chase doesn't matter as opposed to 90% of the cast minus Nurse who also ignores the mechanics of the game just like Legion.
---
Your skill in the chase doesn't matter, Legion jumps through pallets, windows, is faster than you during his power and doesn't even have to hit you more than once because of the moonwalking exploit.
---
You can use google or a dictionary if you don't know what "uninteractive" means, we live in the age of free access to information c:
---
I'm sorry, but if you can't get away from legion "the worst killer in the game" that just means you aren't good at the game.
---
I feel like this man does not remember the full Sabo squad slug parties of old. 
---
Which is not to say Sabo couldn't use a little bump these days. 
---
lmao
---
Lol oh right right my bad! 
---
That Incredible Hulk look tho. 😂
---
She is, I just wanted people to guess before they saw the results 
---
That’s what I was thinking could be the problem with my idea. That and how the game would register to hit boxes clipping through one another.
---
I was running a crouch-centered build (John's Medical File + Video Tape) and got quite a few ambushes that game. I also placed all 4 traps and I mean... yeah they didn't *kill* anyone but...
---
You can't look at an average 3k Pig game where the Killer gets ~7000 in everything and only 3280 in Deviousness and go "this is fine."
---
You just aren't good at the game
---
I don't understand how it's still a problem either
---
"You can't just mindlessly pallet loop him"
---
Yeah I'm sure it takes a lot of brain power to play Legion.
---
You get potato survivors and potato killers at high rank. Rank doesn't really mean much in this game.
---
Honestly I think adding an in-game totem counter would fix a lot of the problems with NOED.
---
Peekaboo Myers is the best way to play this game as a killer, tbh.
---
You do not understand what devotion is or how it works
---
I usually run it or stake out if I don't feel like trying to fight against Ruin skill checks. Given how prevalent Ruin is, it isn't the worst, but if you can't hit the skill checks, it's probably good for you to run. 
---
Dwight's perks are another one of the reasons I love him. He's great for altruism and teamwork. I like mixing a his perks with Claudette's.
---
good keep doing it. Feed me.
---
I love when low skill kids just go ahead and disconnect because they know they aren't good enough to win a game against a weak killer.
---
Someone make a meme about when Wraith's fake uncloak to have the survivor throw down the pallet.
---
I’ve gotten to the point where I just stand in the pallet while invisible and let them throw it on me. Gets straight to the point rather than have them tease me with it then throw it on me anyway :(
---
They're a lot of fun to play as, give them a try. 
---
Poor Freddy, guy probably needs some time off that’s all. 
---
They only blocked her for like 15 seconds max... not exactly grounds for a ban 
---
As someone who vehemently hates facing Spirit... I'm gonna go cry now.
---
On its way sir
---
So neither is an add on...
---
He is not even good unless you run Frank's &amp; cold dirt. 
---
I know because at rank 13 killer I struggle to get my BBQ stacks let alone a 4k. Killing is much easier even on wraith. Without Frank's there's literally no killing with frenzy so it's more of a slight inconvenience to the survivors. Hunting down with bloodhound &amp; sloppy take a lot of time and if you reenter a Chase now they an loop you like a trapless hag unless you waste more time breaking chase. 
---
FeelsBadMan
---
Once I started getting to high green ranks and above I found out I can't bring an item, wear bloody clothing, or enter the lobby with someone at the same time since the killer might think we're SWF and back out.
---
If out of some miracle the killer doesn't dodge the lobby, chances are they will tunnel/camp the 1 or 2 survivors they deem "toxic" and just make the game really boring to play, which sucks after waiting 10-20 minutes to find such a game.
---
what?
---
If the Legion is being played by a potato that can't use their ears then sure. 
---
They can just wait for a second so that you drop the pallet and then continue as usual.
---
&gt;You can allow them to strike and restrike you in frenzy so they suffer their stun, and then sprint burst to gain light years of distance while they literally stare at the ground, and when they look up you will have left no scratch marks.
---
The Legion can skip all of that and just not strike you again. Look at the ground and you bleed out. They have scratch marks and blood and your yells of pain and footsteps to follow.
---
Who cares that you dont leave scratch marks when you are bleeding, and a lot of legions run bloodhound.
---
&gt;your team has ample time to finish 3 gens in the time it will take the legion to down you.
---
It is not about winning the game. I can win the game against 3 gen hostage doc and have an absolutely miserable experience even if I don't die. The fact that Legion's power ignores the chase mechanic makes him terrible to play against and renders your skill useless.
---
&gt;Any killer, when played to the best of their ability, will eventually down any survivor regardless of survivor skill level.
---
Yes but you know the difference there? Both parties skill matters. You can loop them and have a meaningful chase as they don't ignore all of the chase's elements. You both have the chance to win the chase.
---
I never understood why I'm able to heal people but I can't heal myself without a perk. It's the same fucking injury! Bhvr should choose: or I can heal anyone (including myself) or I can't heal anyone without a perk. 
---
You know it got buffed, right? If everyone is running around injured like you say, that’s a 24% penalty. You’re asking for 30-40. So you can’t call that pitiful.
---
You get offended I say your assumption is close-minded and then you follow it up with a close-minded assumption, ironic. I’ve been playing since launch so you can try something else that actually holds any regard over what I’m saying, which you’re generalized as being, “bad.”
---
Yes, Legion is bad, but that doesn’t mean he shouldn’t have counterplay. Bad character design doesn’t justify giving free downs, hooks, or sacrifices.
---
Imagine is there were no hit scans in OW for example. Pharah isn’t one of the best heroes, but if she didn’t have counterplay it would be bad character design.
---
A character being considered bad =/= There shouldn’t be counterplay.
---
Part of me thinks you think those terms are synonymous.
---
Okay.
---
They blocked her until she left.
---
Flashbacks!! Just happened to me on my P3 Quentin with Bubba.
---
 No. The chapter normally comes out about one or two weeks after the ptb ends.
---
tfw I have the same survivor taste as boomers. Feels bad man
---
Genuinely terrifying. Also great fun to play as
---
ya the ptb dropped and no one said crap about him. i know nothing was promised but just a reminder to know they are still on it wouldve been enough, the man didnt even get a passing mention. 
---
I think a totem counter would help both killers and survivors.  A counter would encourage survivors to use time to look for remaining totems and give them an idea how many they have to do.  It gives information to survivors and gives more time for killers.
---
You kids are autistic and want every game to be ez mode for you. Go suck off some clickbait youtubers that told you Legion is broken.
---
So pressing space bar to drop a pallet and running circles around boxes is skill? Running around the see through walls on the farm map is skill? 
---
Just get better at the game and stop complaining. Use team work. You obviously don't.
---
No one cares that you didn't have "fun" while you got raped playing against legion. You just aren't good enough to adapt to the meta. Any competent swf group can easily beat a legion.
---
Gimp is booty beans
---
New DS might help.
---
Pretty much sums up playing DBD on ps4. It's a struggle. I'm hoping they add crossplay so it can fix the killer problem, hopefully.
---
Honestly I don't know if I went against bad survivors or some shit, but I got 3 4k while using his base perks and I'm at rank 1
---
tO BeE fUnNy probably 
---
Next week
---
ye, because she left after 15 seconds.
---
You cant know how long they would have Blocked her if she didnt DC
---
If everybody is injured. How often would that happen then? Even then, it wouldn't be as significant as my proposition would be. gen rushing could still be prevalent if multiple people are on gens.
---
Depends on your play style. If you like focusing on the objectives and escaping then it might not be as useful as if you were focused on keeping your teammates alive and saving them when need be. 
---
You should only have to restart the game, friend. A lot less work. 
---
Source: I buy a fuck ton of Auric Cells and have had this happen a million times. 
---
This. All you need to do. 
---
why not? Isnt this insanely funny and entertaining? /s
---
Op was unclear. Yes that's a new map and that locker setup always occurs on the new map.
---
No i also looked at her face
---
Here's a list of all the general complaints and rules I've collected from my time browsing this subreddit as of late. Hopefully it's helpful. 
---
1. Run in a straight line. Do not attempt to run the killer around (looping) and waste his time. 
---
2. NO PALLETS. I can't stress this enough. 
---
3. No Flashlights, ESPECIALLY not to blind a killer as he picks up a survivor. The killer won his 1v1, this should be respected and you should not attempt to help the survivor escape by any means. (Includes Bodyblocking.)
---
4. No DS. You think a survivor should be allowed to struggle away from a killer? Not in my dbd. 
---
5. Don't play stealthy around the map (immersed) , it's hard for the killer to find you. By extension, no UE. 
---
6. No Toolboxes. Generators get done too fast. 
---
7. If someone is in a chase, STOP DOING GENERATORS. You should instead wander the map and look for chests, or maybe join in on the chase as well just for laughs. Continuing to do the gens is gen rushing, you shouldn't be so focused on the objective. 
---
8. DO TOTEMS, but don't cleanse Ruin too early. You should do all the dull totems so that you won't complain about NoED, but if you come across Ruin and at least 3 minutes haven't gone by don't touch it. 
---
9. No Adrenaline, or Borrowed Time, or Self Care, or Dead Hard, or Sprint Burst. Essentially if you look at a perk and it is useful in helping you win the game, don't take it. These are crutches, and are not to be used. 
---
10. No add-ons, especially insta-heals. 
---
As other's have said, likely next Tuesday (19th) barring any complications. Pretty standard to release the chapter 2 weeks after the PTB starts. 
---
They will probably shut down the PTB at the end of this week and will be putting up the PTB feedback survey within the next couple days. 
---
The issue is playing AGAINST them.
---
Please make all killers, I need that and I didn't know
---
Lmao next you're gonna call us faggots! You're definitely under 15 years old and as for skill you want to lecture me on skill while you run like a headless chicken with Legion! Give me a break! You're the one who wants ez wins that's why you play Legion so you don't have to be looped for ages because you don't know how to counter them. Of course anyone can beat Legion because he's weaker than Freddy without his mixtape and cold dirt. Everyone hates Legion because he's unbalanced and brainless. 
---
Him being the worst doesn't mean that he shouldn't have counterplay.
---
You are not giving any meaningful arguments besides telling other to "learn how to play". You're not really adding anything to the discussion and it makes you look pretty stupid.
---
Others tell you about game mechanics and how the situation usually plays out, you just say they should learn to play and that they are bad and are just crying because they're bad. You sound really childish.
---
I main killer because i have no friends
---

---
Shut up 🙄 my method still works 
---
45% of players are in red ranks...
---
...yeah rank 1 is meaningless.
---
Yikes no need for hostility. Just trying to save you time bro. 
---
You probably are gay, but that is beside the point. 
---
The real point is you are begging the developers to make the game easier for you. 
---
You obviously just need to get better at the game.
---
Oh right, I have done that a couple times, true!
---
Try meg. She’s great at chases with the perks she has. Aside for that, whenever you hear the terror radius, hide in a locker or in thick grass.
---
Basically people are lazy then, cuz by farming this game for bp you'd make enough to probably get an entire extra bloodweb that'll give you another Mori or op add on
---
Yeah but I mean, c'mon, it's No Mither.
---
The current system is bad because you'll safety or rank up even when you lose.
---
The updated system is bad because you'll depip or safety even when you dominate.
---
This is one of my favorite  dbd posts lol
---
Not really fun to play against, which is the entire problem.
---
I find this argument amusing as this has been true on the opposite end for a long time. Unless you play nurse and maybe huntress depending on where you are. Your chase is really only just following the survivor hoping they make a mistake or waiting for bloodlust.
---
It is equally uninteractive as the killer is often able to do nothing but just wait until you run out of pallets/windows and have to go somewhere unsafe. And the argument has always just been "if theyre good in the chase you just have to go find someone else" so yeah this very same complaint has been there on the killer side for years and in all honesty it's always going to be 1 way or the other.
---
Killer is either too strong and you don't actually have a chance in the chase or it's not and he may as well be an AI
---
It's  spiderman! 
---
He really isn't. What gets me steaming is people comparing NOED to surv perks. Survivors can completely destroy NOED just by rubbing totems, what can killers do to destroy *their* overpowered perks? Nothing. Before the Decisive nerf, Killers had to eat shit or play dirty to counter it.
---
Really, there's no reason to complain about NOED. If a zero-perk Quenten could destroy it, I think a P3 Squadette running meta perks will be fine.
---
Holy cow Australia? This needs ages till it arrives here uwu do you know where not_Queen got her's from?
---
Yeah I thought Legion was something new visual design wise but since everybody on this sub uas made their opinion clear I feel like shit whenever I try to play Legion, because I enjoy their design but I know I'm a cunt.
---
yup
---
My guesses are:  
---
Most popular - Meg and Hillbilly  
---
Least popular - Adam and Trapper
---
eh everyone says you waste time healing yourself, but if someone else is healing you that wastes 2 survivor's time even though it doesnt take as long. i only run it when i play solo though because randoms suck (even tho i'm usually the random lol and everyone else is swf) i've also learned to just play injured for a while instead of healing myeslf immediately.
---
Wasnt me I have auto open and extra traps. Just the satification of hearing 4 people get trapped at around the same time is priceless. 
---
Not true. Even without Frank's you can down a survivor at around 30 to 40 percent of the mend bar left. You just have to exit the chase.
---
lmao in what world is borrowed time op or toxic? Just don’t be a facecamping little bitch. 
---
Aaaaaannnnddd you gave up! Congrats on the big boy argument , you won -7 karma!
---
Y'know, it says a lot about how fucked rank really is when almost half of the players who responded to the survey are red ranks. 
---
A full month straight of meme posting, people. I decided try to something new for today in celebration of that.
---
Maybe I'll stick to memes, but I had fun working on this little skit about how funky it is for a killer to vault a second floor window
---
Dang... y’all weren’t gentle at all XD
---
exactly what I was thinking
---
Ace in the Hole, Plunderer's Instinct, Pharmacy, and Streetwise.
---
I think the devs have just given up on him honestly.  So many good ways to fix him.  Sadness.
---
It'll come back dw it might take a few levels but it will come back
---
Rule 1 as a trapper: You are **always** too fat.
---
You can mind game most of the tiles in the game and if you are just brainlessly running through them like a bot then they are just playing better than you. If all you do is rely on eventually getting enough bloodlust to catch up then you're pretty bad at the game. 
---
Go watch Zubat or ScottJund play killer and even when playing against very good survivors they are able to outplay their opponents almost every game. The game really isn't nearly as bad as it used to be with vacuum pallets, double the number of pallets that it used to be. Multiple changes have made this issue go away and except few problematic tiles the game is pretty balanced.
---
You only really leave chases if survivor enters a really strong area, like multiple jungle gyms put together. That is not the matter of killer/survivor strength but bad/good rng. That multiple jungle gym area could have also been a dead zone with no structures or a bunch of z walls and L/T walls. RNG screws both sides from time to time and is the nature of the game.
---
If Tapp is on the hatch and the pig downs him, he wins.
---
Watch some youtube videos. It's easier to see how it's done instead of trying to explain it. No0b3, monto, puppers, and tru3ta1ent all have good content u can watch 
---
So T H I C C H
---
And why shouldn't people who are good at chases use it? That argument is so fucking dumb. It lets good loopers loop for a solid extra minute, as where bad loopers get that extra 15 seconds. Just because bad loopers use it doesn't mean good ones don't
---
Being called a freak for doing a funny LF basement build that killed just one survivor. 
---
I like how she tried to blame her viewers for her complacency. 
---
Ive ignored insidious on my wraith bloodweb for so long and it wont stop reappearing so yes
---
getting a 4k as the Nurse proceeded by being accused of cheating/hacking ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Across the map chainsaws are probably the most satisfying thing in dbd
---
I run BBQ to bandaid that, I usually get 17,000 at a minimum in a good match even with poor Deviousness
---
r/bullyingcoppers
---
Yes, but saying that DS wastes max 15 seconds is a massive understatement, unless literally every survivor you face is a potato
---
Next tuesday is my estimation and alot of other peoples
---
Whenever I play him on Kill Your Friends I run the add on that makes his Bing Bong silent. Its lit
---
I know... it's been bugging me forever. ahahhaha
---
So be a Dwight or hide between Jane Romero’s legs
---
Get better at the game you complaining shitter lmao
---
Wraith is hella fun tbh
---
This last Christmas, my BF and I played a game with a huntress that wanted to slug me and find him to make sure he didn’t get the hatch. We had a key. She left me, he found the hatch, helped me up, and we got out. In the chat afterwards she said “SWF can go kill themselves....have a merry christmas tho” 🤣
---
You should have extended it by having the killer float standing still for a second in the air like a needle then fall in a perfect straight line. Then die.
---
Amen to that!
---
I main killer and love Legion with Clown being a close second. When I do play survivor, for dailies, it is Claudette but I will switch to either Bae or MILF 
---
On his stream yesterday McLean was asked about it after he said Legion changes were coming, I believe the person said something like "legion before Freddy?" and he replied with a very soulless yeah. It sucks.
---
^
---
I haven't really played Clown much. I probably should because he seems super fun.
---
Me: has 8 flashlights and only uses them when they’re all I have left 
---
Brutal strength and spirit fury man. They work wonders on any m1 killer. From my experience at least.
---
Daddy Myers is always a pleasure
---
DS is feast or famine.
---
If you go down in a dead zone, within dribble distance, next to the hook, next to a fall like a hill or basement stairs, next to a tight corner where the killer can bodyblock it or the killer has enduring.
---
If you go down next to a decent setup you might just get slugged.
---
I know how this sub feels about ds, but I've never really had much problem with it and I main killer. There are so many things you can do to avoid it. My only change to DS would be to add a notification when someone has a non-obsession DS, as that one is pure guesswork.
---
The sudden fall made me laugh, tbag def was needed or maybe even the survivors just kicking his head
---
No offense, but you could have answered this yourself by just going to the next bloodweb. Why on earth start a new thread for this sort of question?
---
Someone at rank 1 disconnected at the start of the match because I was Nurse. I farmed with everyone else because of it for 10+ minutes.
---
Turns out they stuck around through all of it until endgame chat to bitch at me for playing Nurse, claiming they always DC against nurse.
---
Keep in mind this was a month after Legion had already come out. I don't know why they dc'd against nurse or even why they stuck around watching everyone farm without them, but it was certainly amusing.
---
Gain distance to pallet or window or vault. But sometimes killers (after using once on them) will bait knowing you have it and wait for you to waste it. So you gotta know when to use it. Knowing your surroundings helps. 
---
Is this a Captain Planet crossover I'm not aware of?
---
Bro, that’d make a good background.
---
huh?
---
It’s not phrased like that it sounds like a rant 
---
Every single time I try to use dead hard it won't give me the option to activate so I've just given up on it, I wonder if it's a console thing?
---
They were just on sale for basically nothing 
---
What do u mean huh?
---
Killers are able to see the survivors because it makes sense in a slasher universe. If they couldn't, it will completly lobby dodging AND kill some killer perks that are only useful in some scenarios.
---
Fake, my boy Clown would just bump on his belly :(
---
No
---
The only thing that's true is toxic is a buzz word used by sore losers with paper thin skin.
---
Get over yourselves.  Furthermore there's a distinct difference between discriminated against versus being offended....
---
Fucking millenials.
---
I'm guessing you're on Steam
---
But I can only be one toxic person. SWYF brings an entire SQUAD of toxicity.
---
Looks absolutely amazing OP! You killed it 
---
Look how they massacred my boy Freddy 
---
I play Legion. Not the cancer Legion you talk about though. I dont use the OP addons and I dont do the turning away thing or anything like that. You guys gotta realise just because some people play cancer with a killer, it doesnt mean everyone does.
---
Interestingly enough, in Zubats stream today he as nurse went up against a survivor named Nurse=DC. 
---
Plot twist though, he did not DC.
---
You might be right. This is just speculation since I am a console peasant so I haven't tried the perk out yet but it looks great to me.
---
I like to say I’m in the middle but I definitely play survivor more. I love the adrenaline rush. I main Feng because she’s cute as hell, but I’m also considering switching to the new thicc queen when she comes out.
---
When I play killer, I main spirit or Michael. Both for the spooks factor, but especially spirit for the mind game potential! 
---
Pig is designed for NOED though.
---
RBT + NOED is awesome.
---
Also, what's really a bad play? Using Noed or ignorantly  bum rushing the exit gate every game anticipating different results?
---
We know the answer.
---
Its on the new map that comes with the new chapter
---
then l2p
---
There are still some huge flaws in the design of map which is the core of why survivors have been so good compared to killers, that and their ability to control the game's length. They haven't changed the design of all the problematic maps (Coldwind Farm for example), and they only touched the length of games with the healing nerf. But I don't run self care anymore so it doesn't really affect me, and I still feel some games are underwhelming when beating killers because I know there's no counter for what I'm doing when looping (on some loops/maps).
---
Yeah cause survivors apparently have rubber legs... 
---
Suiciding on hook is the same but you save some points
---
Enduring + Brutal Strength + Spirit Fury = Drop that pallet, bitch. I fucking dare you. 
---
What about the survivor that keeps derping to the exit gates? 
---
Shouldn't they have to learn?
---
So many closed perspectives. 
---
NOED is literally the only thing that keeps the game from turning into a fearless derpfest at the gates, plus gives the killer incentive to not hook camp yhe last survivor provided they catch one.
---
Yeet
---
Yes, you are. 
---
They still can fix gens tho
---
wym l2p issue
---
That's more accurate. Clown is Fat. Trapper's a beefcake. 
---
She’s in the window in the green house
---
It can be a fun perk still! Don't let me stop you from having fun, I'm just saying that power wise it's not that strong if we're talking about how strong it is compared to other exhaustion perks.
---
Other perks are stronger than it is so chances are it won't be run too often over the others. If it wasn't an exhaustion perk it would see much more use. Give it a normal CD like quick and quiet or beast of prey.
---
Killer mains too. You can't compare this trash to the Babylonian Priestess coming out. They just don't belong. Edge Hot Topic teens.
---
True
---
It’s a little better than dcing at least...
---
I bet you're the first one to cry about "toxic" behavior too.
---
Reddit survivor mains are fucking dense eh?
---
"BOLD +1"
---
Exactly this. Billy is super good in the hands of a good killer, but most Billy players, myself included, and garbage
---
yeah, i noticed that after i posted ;( big oof.
---
I actually had fun against a legion, don't know how but I did
---
Self Care is more than viable and flashlights were LITERALLY broken. They used to be fucking instant lol, they are still strong anyway so
---
Particularly during the locker opening animation. Locker doors pretty much take up your FOV completely. 
---
I play freddy as well but with freddy I manage with blood warden ruin brutal and enduring since I don't have spirit fury for him yet
---
Anything but my whole stock, please.
---
Should've ran balanced landing 
---
One of the best clips of DBD I’ve seen haha
---
Good idea man, wont get implemented sadly but hey thats the devs
---
"What if I went to the next bloodweb without getting it and it never appeared again because I passed it?" It's a fair inquiry, this game has a weird leveling system
---
That honestly shouldn't make any sense because most other killers that can suppress their terror radius with their base kit earn a lot of Deviousness. 
---
Your logic is hilarious, I've never had a random refuse to heal me unless I've trolled them or something. You're wasting a perk slot.
---
fedora man bad
---
It makes sense. When a new killer is released, they put the new map in higher priority so it comes up more often. Likewise, they released a new perk that uses lockers, so why not put a thousand lockers in one spot on the new map as well.
---
I don't have a vomit phobia but the new chapter kinda grosses me out I'm hoping I'll get desensitized to it.
---
As a killer main, it's easy to counter hooks being sabod out from under you. But yeah 3 is probably too much. I just think the perk as is, is worthless and your change makes it a little better but still really bad
---
He’s not complaining like a little bitch, you on the other hand are an asshole. 
---
Yeah I've had many random refuse to heal me so I just think the guess I'll die meme 😂
---
Trapper main, because I'm better at predicting other players mistakes than I am at chases.
---
Hey, i like them cause they can guarantee a nice amount of bloodpoints even during a bad game. Give them distressing and they can easily fill up deviousness, brutality, and hunting to nearly max. about 600-700k of the bloodpoints i have stockpiled is from using them.
---
Says the person who went out of his way to complain about something that isn't even that bad. 
---
Learn to play issue. Instead of crying and begging the developers to make the game easier for you, learn how to adapt to the meta and get better at the game.
---
I mean, they are not trying to vault it back
---
He wants you to explain your idea better because it's not very clear.
---
Also stalking a survivor as Myers without terror radius behind a tree and then seeing them sprint burst away as soon as they notice you
---
I think both Trapper and Wraith are in need of new animations. I'd love Trapper to put his strength to use in some way, particularly if he went for a Jason Voorhees style kill. 
---
You found her!
---
Sprint burst is good for juking killers, but I don't think many people know how to do it the way I do. It's a pretty unknown secret technique but I promise it's more successful than dh
---
I have a secret Sprint burst technique for juking killers
---
just use Pharmacy 
---
Its not fun for the person playing, or the people who have to play against it..... idk where you think skill comes into play in this scenario. Franks mixtape on legion is just nurse with amazing guided blinks.
---
Empathy has infinite range. Bond is barely better than tier 1. Also I have zero control over what another player does. They have no obligation to heal me. Additionally, if someone messes up a skill check, I’d rather it be me. That way I’m the one causing my death rather than someone else. Both have their merits but I prefer these for solo queues
---
I’ve never had an issue with this... especially since it’s a video game and not real.
---
I also don’t care about gore or sexuality in video games (like mortal kombat or doa) they are still fun. 
---
I do feel bad for you though if this is genuinely an issue :( 
---
What part do not understand
---
Next week 
---
Kate main here, I'll literally square cash you $5 to make me a good Kate wallpaper for my s8+.
---
He needs some shore leave. 
---
Survivor: nea 
---
Killer: hillbilly 
---
No, all stuff boughten with bloodpoints will be reset when transfering to the live servers. (Which is why everyone used their best items and offerings on the ptb.)
---
It doesn’t transfer 
---
She was carrying the Claudette and Ace got the stun off.
---
Ehhh... nothing special
---
Quality!
---
Love when i pull off this kinda jukes like i'm always like "how did that just fucking work??"
---
I don't have a fear of vomit , I've seen a girl at work vomit last week and I didn't care, but watching gameplay of survivors vomiting from getting vomited on really freaks me out :(
---
is that a problem?
---
Sadly, you're not wrong.
---
Other than Hex perks, which are designed around being counterable, what are some other strong killer perks that have a clear counter?
---
it's not solely about trusting randoms to heal you; it's about even finding the randoms in time which gets harder and harder depending on how many people are left.
---
"hex-still-single"
---
Oh really? *oink oink*
---
Nothing wrong with using NOED
---
Yup. 
---
Like most Killers on PS4 she just seemed to enjoy standing still and watching people die.
---
Some bastards don’t believe me, but idc, it’s nothing to be prideful about... I just really love the game. Some people master prestige CoD 100 times and nobody bats an eye. Prestige over 20 and people call you a liar
---
Great timing, that smile 🥺
---
Hillbilly, Leatherface, start your Chainsaw engines.. and may the best killer... win!
---
I got a 4k and the survivors called me a baby killer 😂
---
I completely agree, I think killers should be rewarded in some way for competing against swf and however many there are (ie blood point multiplier starting at ×1.50-x2.00) or they should get an in game benefit until a overhaul comes in. Also, I think there should be system that loints out which players are swf so people can actually identify them.
---
&gt;Stealth Killer
---
&gt;Snow-white Mask and bright blue jumpsuit
---
poorly designed, yes but counterable
---
It's earned the Moniker "Selfish-Care" because of how wasteful it can be and there are generally better methods of healing. I've run We'll Make It and Autodidact before and people have legitimately run away from me to use it even when the killer's in Chase with someone else. 
---
i think [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt_EoamFuVJ/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=1tcb4q4qqsc3x) is potentially the original post.
---
I do get a bit nauseous from it but after watching the new killer’s mori a few times I’ve started to grow desensitized. It’ll take getting used to. If it helps, the puke is not at all detailed, looks like someone took green and yellow paint and just painted straight lines to make it look gross. I think it’ll be okay once you get used to it.
---
Or maybe some of us prefer to self-sufficient and not drag our feet to find someone to heal us. 
---
I love this community the stuff they come up with does make me smile. 
---
Uh huh. That's why you're going to send that pic around, right? Cause you're such an adult..... LOL
---
I usually just pick them back up and reset them if someone does it to me.
---
Do we have go through this again boi....
---
Claudette looks like out of a comic, dope shot!
---
"jUsT uS3 B0nD 4H3@D lul"
---
Well, Bond ain't gonna save me when the killer gets a 3k.
---
I mean I thought it was a sense of humor but whatever you wanna tell yourself my dudes! 
---
So much salt over a silly little meme (that I’m not actually sending anyone lmao)
---
I mean brutal strength isn't necessary, but it isn't exactly a waste to use the other 2 perks since that one chase mechanic is literally the survivors best defense against looping on every map and killer by default.
---
Uhhhh... I somewhat new and this is a pretty big comment thread thingy... are you talking about me or the guy who said "blah blah bitching lmai blah blah"?
---
Legion bad
---
I dont have any phobias but my mother, who sometimes watches me play, has a horrible fear of clowns. So I just try to avoid looking the killer’s way when I know it’s a clown as much as possible. Vomit makes me nauseous but its mostly the sound of someone throwing up, so that’s gonna be an issue but I’m almost over it considering Ive been watching videos of the Plague for a bit now.
---
There's nothing sufficient about taking an extra half gen repair time to heal.
---
Thank you , that definitely gives me hope. It's mostly seeing Claudette or Dwight puke but I think I'll just have to play stealthy around the new killer and avoid getting myself sick ;)
---
Aw fuck, i cant believe i’ve done this
---
My bad, i thought i was replying to the right dude, im big dumb. 
---
Bond, Wake Up, Sprint Burst, and now, Poised. I'm a gen jockey, so I normally do this, with Stake Out and the like sometimes thrown in at the expense of Wake Up. I also do a chest build often. Pharmacy, Plunderer's Instinct, Ace in the Hole, and Small Game. 
---
Lmao that smile in the end 
---
Im dying 😂😂
---
It's surprisingly effective on Trapper's maps lol
---
Here's a bit of a balance to it, though, if you'd like to hear. If a hook has been damaged and a Survivor is hooked on it, said hook's durability is restored to 0%. 
---
Great job, I see no problem with the editing! I hope next Monday you make another lol
---
But it would also nerf NOED a bit too
---
No no you are, I just scrolled down and saw this and was like "ayyyy did I say something rude... I'm sorry!"
---
How fucking entitled can you get. Im not here for you. Im here to have fun. If your setup suggests i wont have it or youll try to ruin it im out and you can suck my dick. You have no right to play with me. You have the chance to, but only if i agree.
---
Just as the same is true in reverse.
---
Killers have a perk for this already tbh
---
I think we have to teach him in baby steps
---
Im so confused
---
I need to stop smoking 
---
"Wait, perhaps we can learn something from his experience."
---
Kid, the only thing you go through is your autism medicine. 
---
No need, it's my bad, I'm still new at this
---
The counter to Nurse’s being ”don’t heal when in terror radius” and Spirit Fury being ”don’t try to stun the killer”?
---
And we can't have that, now can we? God forbid killers don't get rewarded for letting the survivors get all the generators.
---
yes that is the point
---
You literally just copied someone who did that already
---
That's super cool. This is why I made this post. So many people play what they do for entirely different reasons. Not once have I thought about someone loving Trapper because they're an engineer.
---
And you're definitely right about Trapper. He's really good if you play him right. Not top tier necessarily, but nowhere near terrible.
---
Killers also have to play around the possibility of perks. That's how the game works.
---
And people wonder why most wraiths prefer to stick near the hook and go for injured survivors. I kick a gen after a hook usually (Wish I had pop goes the weasel) and by the time I walk back there’s usually an unhook going on
---
That was a joke... I didn't reported you... It's because you said "Ecin" instead of "Nice"...
---
when I take it I take it to use it as a ruin if I don't have a ruin
---
I ain't about to judge anyone for who they choose to play. If you're not being an asshole, play however you want. Legion sucks to play against sure, but if you're good with him, do it. You deserve to have fun too.
---
---- The Point -----&gt;

---
You
---
Yeah I bought it for that reason because I stream DBD almost none stop so I have to get a nice frame for it and hang it on my wall. 
---
I dont think the devs put this out but there is a "toxic lobby" for toxic players and players that get reported alot. If one of your friends was reported multiple times then you guys was probably qued into a toxic lobby where matchmaking doesn't matter.
---
I disagree. How a killer acts in a game doesn’t change in a meaningful way because of survivors’ perks.
---
Repost
---
i use Bind perk to see where survivors are when im being chased in order to innocently redirect the killer to them. (innocently, though)
---
I don't often use Freddy.
---
Looking at your comment history I suggest you take a chill pill dude. It appears to me that you are a very toxic killer main and you seem to get overly emotional abd aggressive when someone even mentions "Legion is (insert word here)"
---
Ok
---
You mean you created a toxic match
---
hhmhmhmhmhmhmmmmmmmmmmmm, ok
---
As Wraith if you really want to you can take the addon that makes breaking pallets faster, and use Spirit Fury + Enduring to actually secure hits.
---
good luck keeping it if the new ptb ranking stays the same
---
Lol. Had to be clown
---
Huntress one took me awhile but only because I was on console and it used to be 100 downs on console instead of 20. Then again you could also be on console and just seemed to get it way easier.
---
Oh yeah because playing against Franks Mixtape Legion is fun and fair. Interesting
---
That's not low quality, you actually put effort into this and it looks good!
---
Wanna try out 5 day membership?
---
Ok. So I could've gotten 3 achievements at once with Michael? I got the 4 Mori one as well as the Evil Incarnate.
---
Hopefully dedicated servers make it so at the very least if the killer leaves then the lobby doesn't break up.. but yep ps4 survivor you have to look like a baby dwight, fresh out of a locker. No items or prestige.. 
---
Yep! That would he a huge help!!
---
Even just showing the Exposed status *before* getting hit would be a fantastic change that doesn't effect NOED that much, since apparently it's "currently in a good place."
---
Ah, totally excused then. They all look the same when staring down a flashlight barrel.
---
Yes
---
That’s what i was asking 
---
I'm sure he'll stab his way out of it! 
---
Use team work to win or just keep getting raped and crying about a mid tier killer.
---
You obviously suck ass because any competent player doesn't rage any time they go against legion.
---
You obviously suck at the game.
---
Default Dwight it is! Or pizza Dwight 1.0.
---
Swap out Bloodwarden for Rancor, and remove Than. 
---
Rancor will let you Kill the Obsession if they survive to End Game (you can't gain Remember Me stacks after the gates are powered, so you don't lose out from having the Instant Down), provide you Survivor locations when every gen is popped, AND unless the Obsession is asleep they won't see your aura so you can actually hide the perk from them. The location ping will mesh well with Remember Me, by helping you sleep all the Survivors still around when the Gates become activated. It's also nice during mid-game too as it can help you find awake Survivors.
---
Bloodwarden only comes into play if they open the Gates and only lasts for 60 seconds. Ideally Remember Me will keep the Gates from ever opening.
---
Enduring and Spirit Fury will help you disrespect every pallet and end chases faster. The major area that Freddy struggles is being able to quickly end chases and break pallets, since his power slows down the game and lets him strategize Survivor locations and movements, the only two other things a Killer needs.
---
Than is a slow down perk that is most effective when multiple people are injured at a time. Freddy works best by sleeping multiple Survivors at a time but by injuring and downing them one at time, so as to deny them Wake Up via Self-Care and force them to find friends to Wake Up (revealing the location of at least two Survivors to you) or by forcing them miss generator skillchecks (regressing their objective progress for you).
---
If you don't want to give up the extra slowdown, Swing Chains or Jump Rope will help more than Than does (even after Than's upcoming buff, Swing Chains will be stronger than a maximum Than) against sleeping Survivors and they're only Rare add-ons.
---
A good killer would have taken you out, first.. 
---
you can sleep soundly knowing you're part of the problem
---
It is bannable. Also very toxic
---
Clearly they don’t want to do that. Doesn’t make them lazy- they just don’t want to farm. Plenty of killers will ignore it. It’s not fun- if a cat and mouse chase happens organically? AWESOME but like hell im gonna do it with someone because someone brought bps. Idk why people get off trying to tell people how to enjoy the game. It’s not even tips on getting better it’s just - this annoys me don’t do it- 
---
It actually is a smart decisions dor everyone if they end up chasing A healthy survivor.
---
LOLMAO
---
It says it should take 2-3 weeks for international buyers. That’s the only one I could find and it has pretty positive reviews too. If you don’t want to wait I would suggest asking others on the DBD forums because I can’t find any more DBD hats.
---
Rofl 🤣

Only change I want is for her to not be able to just tap and instant release her vomit so that I can actually attempt to dodge it, especially when its able to down.
---
Ah, fair
---
Nah, people like you are the worst people in dbd 
---
I get a match in less than a minute. Hell, it's surprising if I need more than 1:30. PS4 isn't dead.
---
She doesnt have to wind up her vomit like huntress does hatchets, she can just insta release so it's not really dodgeable
---
The unfortunate thing is that because the communication gives survivors such a huge advantage you cant blame them for not wanting to play against it. We are not at a point where most killers will have more or less have a chance against a well coordinated team.
---
They can tell the rest of the team where the gens are, where the ruin is, as soon as the killer is seen or starts chasing somebody as well as where they are going. And if they are really paying attention they can tell the team what perks the killer is likely running so they can play around them. If a guy gets spotted while healing you can guess its probably nurse's if they turn around after hooks and make a beeline for a survivor its prob bbq. If they have spirit fury they tell the rest after the first pallet breaks so the rest can drop the pallet early and never activate the perk again. 
---
You get so much power from simply communicating that you would have to willingly submit to an unfun game if you play it as killer. And until the game is balanced around hyper communicative teams there will always be a reason to dodge even a suspected SWF group since it would be like playing survivor if you knew the killer was gonna use an ebony mori before hand.
---
Please... tell me where Oh so "whine" about Legion... Go right on ahead bud
---
Coven was the best AMHS of the day
---
Fam, you cannot possibly be this stupid right?
---
I agree with you. I used to play Legion before I realized how annoying it was so I know what chases are like. All this guy mentions reference potato killers. Even with Iron Will, they need to start mending very soon after a Franks double hit. It's mend or be chased with the timer not being long enough to find ample distance. I can see that strat working on Yamoaka or Mount Ormond in certain spots, but with the stun it's not like he can't see you running away and guess where you went when you used LOS breakers or Jukes.
---
Even without Franks, he's still annoying. It just takes another hit.
---
Getting 3x BP is will make you better tho lol. It's dumb not to do it.
---
Anyone can be this stupid, fam.
---
Auto haven Wreckers map. Did 3 gens by my lonesome, was the obsession, only got hooked once. My teammates 3 genned us and I had to finish the last gen. Unhooked Bill, as we were the last survivors and escape through the door. 
---
Meg's tennis skirt right? I thought I was the only one who noticed how awful it looks and it has been that way for months.
---
Another survivor running DS who thinks he's the shit. Boring.
---
I mean, I sometimes use Small Game in my “rotating” perk slot and I’ll stop and break any totem I come across running between gens. I like to think it’s a pretty streamlined way to handle it.
---
I don't know how often they update this but if you check on it from time to time you'll know what's going on: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/11/activities-and-livestream-roadmap#latest
---
i also immediately didn't agree with it when i read on reddit that the Plague causes survivors to vomit. it's NOT a phobia. it's common sense. i'll do anything to avoid vomiting when i feel nauseated. it's like torture. i dont have Steam. hopefully the vomiting has no vomit audio. i thought it was odd to include vomiting in mortal kombat x too. thats nothing to do with being a warrior. lol. its funny, because of course survivors get slashed and hung, but violence is expected in video games, as long as it doesnt go too far like mutilation (HATE god of war), but vomiting seems to go too far. if DBD was real, i'd never wanna play against Plague. even more than the usual killer. haha.

Reddit forgets that the downvote isnt a disagree button, it's for downvoting content that doesn't contribute to a conversation.  Sorry, clod.
---
No it won’t. It’s currency, it’s not a tip on how to play, it’s closest case to being something to make you better is buying perks- which doesn’t help if you don’t know fundamentals. I.e noed wont help anyone who can’t find people by not checking their blind spots and getting looped all day. 
---
If a killer breaks a pallet that is a free blind which gives you a chance to juke and escape the killer. Flashlight saves are also possible
---
also you talk about self care like there’s no benefit to it, such as getting healed?
---
Another hit or like 5 seconds on dropping chase/looking at the floor, yeah.
---
*"Let's punish players for trying to progress in the game!"*
---
How 'bout no?
---
My two favorite things in one video;-;
---
when I feel like playing killer, it's usually the spirit. I felt very drawn to her backstory, especially because I actually can imagine how tragic it is and how infuriating it must be to basically have your future path / life choices ripped away by the effects of other people's decisions and actions (namely, her father). her story and the associated feelings &amp; thoughts of any form of revenge or consolation make me feel quite connected to her.
---
when I play survivor, it's either jake or Jeff. some aspects of jake's life are surprisingly similar to mine, and I feel as if I basically would be jake if I was a survivor in the game. his perks are what I would use / benefit from myself. 
---
and Jeff, well, I play Jeff because can sympathise with him and because I tend to hide my more vulnerable traits as good as I can, and I don't want anyone to know that I love to draw, paint &amp; read theatre plays. I don't even know why I do that, but as soon as Jeff came out and I read about his character, I felt connected.
---
that's it :)
---
Maybe I'll put Rancor back on. It was fun mori-ing people anyway.
---
My issue with the perk is that I find it hard to read the location popups - Bitter Murmur shows a clear aura, but the Location reveal just covers huge spaces and makes it hard to see.
---
31 custom memes, good job buddy it must be a bit of work
---
Because most teammates you encounter are either brilliant and do everything that needs to get done, or they're all absolute horseshit and no work is going to get done, there's no in between and no point in risking it either.
---
In a lot of ways Killers are the ones to blame for looping:  
---
\-Killers keep getting and using perks that make it easy to locate Survivors: BBQ, Whispers, Nurse's etc.  As a result, it is often very easy for Killers to locate Survivors.
---
\-Killers are faster than Survivors 
---
\-Actually losing a good Killer is often extremely difficult
---
\*\*So to add it up, Killers are faster than Survivors, have an easy time finding Survivors, and it is very difficult to actually lose a Killer during a choice due to scratch marks, noises, blood, open lines of sight, etc.  If people do not loop then what is their alternative once being chased? It is like Killers are basically saying "you can run me around for maybe 10-15 seconds, but anything more than that is unfair. I am supposed to be able to quickly down you and you should have no way to either make it a long way or escape from me.
---
You shouldn’t have to waste a whole perk slot to know how many totems are on the map.  It should be something both killers and survivors know.
---
I always get games almost immediately at that rank on PS4...
---
I get that. :\\
---
It takes some time to get used to the vague indicators, especially when they're some distance away, but it's really helped me out on Freddy, since it shows EVERY person, not just those near the gen. I might be biased towards liking Rancor because I've been able to catch people hiding in nearby Lockers with it, but I really do think it's a good perk for Freddy.
---
Also being able to Mori people *because* of their D-Strike is immensely satisfying.
---
Cool gameplay
---
Not cool tbag
---
This is my favorite DBD meme format
---
The fun thing here is people calling me a thief or a reposter, i dont frequent this sub reddit that often, nor did reddit give me the waening that it was already posted, if it was then again im sorry, just  wanted to share something funny, now people comming here calling me scum, lowest of the low, etc is not a good thing. And i never claimed the video was mine
---
I got a little excited. I only ever do it in the gate after being cheeky.
---
No I did wait. In fact the killer was Michael that said in the post game chat that he was playing in his friends account because he saw the game on YouTube. I waiting and I saw the Laurie constantly t-bagging at every pallet. By the second gen he got no hooks because of constant ds and flashlight saving. That’s when I started using the object + bond. Yes I know it’s a bad thing to do but I have well over 600 hours on killer alone so I know that feeling. And a newbie vs a rank 1 ds team is honestly just unfair.
---
Maybe don't jump off right in front of the killer?
---
Fire Up actually got a buff...
---
maybe hood man not so bad?
---
Ha, I only lost *some* respect. In the end, you're still ahead here.
---
I could see how it was an in-the-moment thing after watching this. Awesome clip, thanks for sharing!
---
Praise be to the meghead.
---
Yeah, I saw the others doing it tho and it's hard not to join in. The killer tunneled a no mither guy before any gens really got done, so they weren't the best either.
---
15% is nothing late game since most of the pallets are gonna be broken.  
---
Also having 3% from the first generator means nothing.
---
Yeah I feel like I see an inordinate amount of Huntesses compared to this. 
---
It was just the same thing except the salt cookie was a actual cookie with too much salt 
---
I think he’s saying to add this to counter facecampers so you can’t jump off and expect to get away
---
OP, i can’t give you any advice except to run Dead Hard, or wait for your teammates to try and distract the killer
---
Love this! 
---
Yeah, if the game was well optimized it would be a good idea but sadly we aren’t there yet
---
https://nm.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9i64z2/the_clown_is_a_man_of_chivalry/
---
there you go. Like I said, he just straight up stole it
---
Thanks!
---
I know how that feels. 
---
lol imagine thinking this perk could possibly be balanced in ANY universe. Deliverance is in no way meant to counter camping and it would be absurd if it did.
---
Enduring is meta.
---
uninteractive isn't even a word you stupid fucking faggot LMAO!
---
Not sure what you're talking about, because I've definitely had people in my matches try to do that.
---
I was being chased by the Plague around the underground part of the temple. I was injured and she was catching up to me so I randomly jumped into a locker. Oddly enough, she didn't grab me right away. She vomited on the locker and then she lingered around the area, and then proceeded to try and grab me. Needless to say, not grabbing me right away was a big mistake.
---
Head On's my new favourite perk. It's definitely a semi-infinite deadly weapon.
---
21% at the last gen. Yes, math is hard for you.
---
well the "joke" seemed like a very serious answer. If you want to indicate sarcasm, use "/s" or make it seem very obvious that you are joking.
---
Unpopular Opinion: Freddy doesnt need a rework, any rework or buff will just be a nerf to him most likely.

This isn't Myers like I asked for in the other thread, but I still appreciate it immensely.  
---
Seriously, never thought I'd help inspire a meme. Way to exercise your creativity, Zombo. 
---
It's 21% at end game.

Thats a pretty sick idea, I'd do that

Survivors; Jeff and Quentin. I absolutely feel for Jeff and we're similar in some aspects of story and tastes in art/music; the moment he released I was like "yes, he is my main." Quentin is my secondary and is my fave licensed survivor, I really like his character in Elm and feel he needs more love. Both characters seem to be the type of introverted players who aid other survivors and vanish. Being a solo player, it's really my type.
---
Killer wise - Myers, I've always been a bit of a practical joker and like to keep survivors on their toes - I've never had an unfun game versing Myers myself. Also my favourite slasher film franchise. Non-licensed is probably Doctor for similar reasons, but he is much less sneaky.
---
Pretty sure it's 6% from the first gen. 
---
Also, it's 21% after the last gen.
---
Dude. A Legion player with two brain cells to rub together can down one of the best survivor players if just given enough time no matter what the survivor player does because of how the Legion's power works. The Legion can vault windows and pallets and is also way faster than survivors when he uses his power which also has a short cooldown. It literally just comes down to waiting for the power gauge to fill up and then just vault over anything the survivors throw at you.

The invite is invalid, can you make a new one?

I mean, it's a camper, of course you can't expect to jump off and get away unless they let you or you're doing some god-tier play.

*How to not be a toxic survivor in Dead by Daylight*
---
Don't run. Just let it happen.
---
I had a thought for Myers with his super speed pallet vault. 
---
I may do something in its favor in the future. Won't be as time constrained with that one, so I'll try to add sounds for it as well. 
---
Clown just seemed to really fit the "fall flat" feeling though. Aesthetically, I really like him
---
Amazing play. Thumbs up. People being mad at you for T-baggin but don't yell at the toxic juggling killer \*thinking emoji\*

I love playing against Spirit so much. I really enjoy the loop mindgames and falling back on the scratch marks I just made; it’s a trick I’ve fallen for many a time when I’ve been chasing an uninjured survivor.
---
I wish I lived in a world where I didn't have to put /s at the end of my comment because people don't understand that I was clearly joking. You are getting the r/woosh for that one. Inexcusable.

---
 When we getting balanced landing for killers?
---
From what I've been told to me repeatedly on noed related threads is that totems are supposed to be survivors' optional objectives, so the first part point is kinda iffy.
---
I'm not talking about the number of gens left mate, I'm talking about auras of the generators.
---
It's not about being stupid, it's the fact that the only point of doing the totems is Noed, and going into every game assuming that every killer has Noed being the only reason for doing totems is awful design. 
---
It's easy to say just do the totems when in many situations you don't get enough time to be able to get on the totems. I've had tons of games in which I've ran a new/bad killer (which usually are the ones running noed) and then got downed with Noed. I had 0 opportunities to get on totems.
---
Noed should have an indicator before someone gets downed with it, show the exposed icon of the perk the moment the gates are open. That way if you are in a chase with the killer you have a chance to adjust to bonus speed and instadown and play loops safer/drop pallets faster. As it is right now it's not really clear.
---
I dodge as Survivor all the time. If the game isn't at least under 200 ping I won't play.
---
It's better for it to be uniform. Both sides can dodge if they so chose. It's annoying as hell to have to go through 10+ lobbies sometimes if you're playing SWF but I guess that's the trade-off for the advantage you get.
---
I play a lot of solo queuing survivor. My team mates just all quit and then I get downed within two minutes and hooked. I don't like Legion.
---
The point I am trying to make that you can use Hill Billy's chainsaw sprint more often than LF's thus getting more points from it. While Bubba's has more narrow use, especially during chases that are not in the open. Greater risk of tantrum too.
---
Even tho Hill Billy's is not great, it's better.
---
;w;
---
I legitimately don't see the big deal with the teabagging. Why do so many people label it as something as "gratuitous."?

So you downed 3 people before they finished one gen? Sounds like good stuff to me
---
Yes, DC and report campers. That'll sure fix your problem.
---
That's just unfortunately how it be for some of the near pure M1 killers. Need 3 perks to at least make pallets not a painful experience.
---
Small Game IS A Totem Counter, Do You Think Anyone Uses It For The Killer Notification? No It's For Finding Totems To Stop NOED(Nothing Against You If You Do Use It For The Killer Notification, Its Just Not It's Main Use)
---
That's it! I'm playing on remote play. No one will ever fear me if I'm wearing default clothes, no items or offerings, and playing on remote play.
---
You can kinda strategize and let 1 gen get done after you put one on
---
I'm not trying to fix it lol. 
---
this kills the man
---
Make an MMR system with a ranked mode with BP, Iri Shards and cosmetic rewards. Ban most of the OP stuff, if not all consumable items and addons.
---
Then have a casual fun mode where everything is allowed, even the old stuff like Moon Bouquets.
---
I showing the amount of totems on a map
---
It is viable, but could be replaced with a medkit. Ironically it made me a better survivor playing without self-care 
---
Yeah totally! Sometimes I play against flashlight using fireworking tea baggers and they get mad I facecamp their friend I hooked when the gates are open already like haven't you guys heard 1 bird in hand is worth 3 in the bush
---
F
---
I main trapper because of 2 reasons. 1. 2 of my favorite RPG had various traps but I always stepped in the bear traps. 2. I like the concept of trying to think ahead of survivors to get them to step in them. I also play a bit of survivor to help me get a better idea of what survivors do or if I'm playing with my friends.
---
Rank 1s only hard to get games as survivor. Itll be tough for killer when the new chapter comes out though.
---
hood man not so bad? hmmm. tell me more.
---
I think the whole proxy camping thing being a dickish way to play the game doesn't apply in the situation where there are 3 gens left and they're all next to each other... Again, that's a mistake on the part of the survivors. Anyone who plays survivor knows how frustrating and difficult it is to repair gens near the end of the game when they're all close together, but any time that's happened to me I've cursed myself for allowing it to happen rather than blaming the killer for staying in proximity to the gens. 
---
Not without using small game. Killers have to use thrill of the hunt to keep track of their totems and how many there are survivors would need to use a perk to find and track how many there are
---
Idk if it's "toxic" or not, but it's annoying as fuck to be going up to hook someone then someone else runs in and insta-taps a hook down, and you have no warning or way to counter it. 
---
Camping isn’t a reportable offense. Annoying as fuck and horrible to do. But not against any rules of the game. The devs even see it as a strategy which I find stupid but it is what it is. It’s always been here. You should of seen true face camping back in the day. Where you didn’t even get a chance off the hook. 
---
Cause I'm supposed to be able to tell if you're being sarcastic or stupid or not. You deserve the r/woosh. 
---
Exactly. Why allow the injured survivor time to heal themselves and create more time-consuming work for yourself chasing an uninjured survivor. It's in the survivor's interest to do that, but you're not trying to benefit them. It seems so simple to me yet so many people insist on getting angry and upset when it happens. They need to play better if they don't want that to happen.
---
ETIAM
---
Sit under the hook and wait for me or you're toxic :c
---
Now if they fixed blood points and what depips/pips you maybe I wouldn't care. But jesus christ. And from what I hear it's all gonna get worse.
---
I’ve had it happen to me as a single player as well. 
---
Is that on console? On PS4 it can take forever to find a lobby so I play whatever one I get. 
---
Fair point! 
---
Is that Comic Sans?
---
Can I flashlight blind the hook?
---
Oh I see it now constantly. If that's not taking the game hostage I dont know what is..
---
&gt;Ruin in order to *Slow the game down just a little bit*
---
FTFY
---
It is not toxic, this is one of your objectives. Being toxic is doing things that not expected by gameplay, like tea-bagging. Flashlight saves, pallet blinds, sabo hooks up to 99% - these are all parts of the game.
---
I just find survivors doing stupid plays in general to crack me up.
---
Interesting :)
---
Agreed, Id say shes round about Trapper tier.
---
You have 3 options:
---
1. Slug them and go for another survivor
---
2. Wait for 3 minutes
---
3. Use hangman's trick perk
---
It appears you don't play against me then.
---
Also ranks should only reset every 2-3 months. We shouldnt have to fight against trash campers and when we finally reach the top it resets. Lol. Like wtf. 
---
IMO Trapper is the worst killer in the game, so I'd say shes like C tier from S+ to D.
---
This is your brain when you take advice from reddit killers
---
Nobody really likes to play against him. He's not very interactive and ignores chase.
---
Blood Warden is the type of perk I'd love to seem more of in the game. It's niche but when it works it creates such a unique great moment, you can't even be frustrated at it.
---
Only if you are ready to get reported and want a -rep comment on your steam profile ;w;;;
---
Legion maybe hated but hated with style
---
Amen to that. 
---
Damn idk how you didn't smash into the rock but that was amazing. 
---
Awhhhh thanks for the compliment bud, means a lot. Ill admit, I've said things on here I shouldn't have said and I honestly regret it. I don't know if I still have it posted but its something I complained about with gen tapping on ruin... I was new and I didn't understand how slow gen tapping can be. And in conclusion I got what I deserved to say the least.
---
SWF should be unranked, and should be put into a SWF/KYF hybrid. 
---
I mean forcing the pallet throw doesn't take long if you are aggressive enough to show the survivor you aren't afraid of getting hit by it and catch up to them. You will drastically cut down on nearly every loop in the game, and if they don't throw the pallet well then the other outcome is you just hit the survivor. Enduring and Spirit Fury nearly completely negate the downside of getting hit from the pallet and at best lets you do a follow up attack to down the survivor right there. If survivors try playing around spirit fury then you are still cutting down on loops as they will be preemptively throwing down pallets before you even get there to avoid getting caught in spirit fury.
---
At the moment, I’m using:
---
We’re gonna live forever
---
Self-Care
---
Urban Evasion
---
Borrowed Time 
---
I’ve been thinking of changing it, and try to use a build without self-care
---
Wow I have totally never seen this posted in the subreddit before
---
My same thought, I said “okay!” And kept going along for the ride lol
---
You absolutely should have known better than to barge into a teenage girl's room.
---
How the fuck does Franklin's Demise help with an already sabo'd hook? 
---
You do realize there are lots of ways to speed up sabo right? It doesn't take "a lot of time" with the right set up. 
---
Lol I can’t if I’m on the hook my guy
---
In the end, I ended up with 20k bp just for one sacrifice and it was a pretty quick game
---
It seems every time I run this perk, the obsession basically throw themselves at me, lol. Every other time I find a survivor, it’s the obsession.
---
It's A "Meme Perk" Because People DON'T USE IT, &amp; Because Of That No-One Uses It To Counter NOED Because It's A "Meme Perk". If It Counters NOED, &amp; You Don't Like NOED, Use It. I Used Unnerving To Deal With DS &amp; It Worked(Kinda, But It Did SOMETHING). If The Devs Put In A Perk That Counters NOED, It Would Be In The Same Boat As Small Game With People Not Using It Because It Just Hard Counters NOED &amp; Might Deal With Other Hexes, But You Could Just Run An Exhaustion Perk In It's Place &amp; Outrun NOED
---
You're a shitter that disconnects because you aren't good enough. Didn't even read your retarded response. Get good at the game and stop crying.
---
You morons think that every killer should have the exact same mechanics and play the same way. The meta in games changes frequently. You just clearly are shit at the game and are unable to adapt.
---
Don't get caught, ez pz. 
---
Small Game isn't a "meme perk" and honestly neither is Unnerving Presence. Small Game is very effective but the problem is that maps in general are huge and it's very hard to track all totems and legitimately impossible to know if your allies have done any.
---
Calm down, Laganja
---
Take my upvote 
---
They might be trying to force you to give up your stacks. I just ignore them (and they literally can't be hit by Freddy unless he lets them, lol).
---
I think it should be nerfed so that if the guy unhooks in about 10 or so meters of the Killer he doesn't get Deliverance. That way you shut down mindless hook rushing. But the devs want to keep rewarding the bads. 
---
sometime hood man no stab small people 
---
We need 2018 Michael, too, and a Burger King Mask for the meme. 
---
Because while most of the people you face can or will be assholes you also have a game where the Developers actually care and try even if they make mistakes.
---
I literally had a game where I cleansed 4 out of 5 totems and then got downed by fucking NOED.
---
Sounds wholesome. Probably runs a tight ship in the kitchen though...
---
I do try but sometimes I get trash teammates who bring the killer to me 😂😂
---
Care to explain? I’m curious why you think it’s OP
---
Adorable! 
---
That's why I used PWYF, that way I get extra speed if they wont leave me alone.
---
At what point does chasing a survivor become a waste of time
---
holy crap this killer needs some game awareness 
---
I don't mind the Wraith's animation so much but I do agree that Trapper is in bad need of an update. Either a Jason-like kill like you said or perhaps something involving a bear trap. I remember several months ago hearing a streamer suggest that they'd like to see Trapper's mori having him place a survivor's head into an open bear trap and then stomping on the back of their head to close the trap.
---
The fix to the "killer problem" is more survivors playing killer
---
Yeah dude, if survivors played differently killers wouldn't camp to mitigate losses lol
---
Eh, Killers Already Have TotH, Give Survs A Perk That Has Totem Tokens(That Doesn't Do MUCH Else, Because Survs Already Have Enough Ass-Pulls). Like, Make It A Gimmick Perk, It Does One Weird Thing, But It Still Works
---
Perhaps lol
---
Best killer in the entire game. 7/7 would hood man again.
---
&gt;It's A "Meme Perk" Because People DON'T USE IT, 
---
Thats not how that works. People dont use it BECAUSE its a meme perk
---
&gt;But You Could Just Run An Exhaustion Perk In It's Place &amp; Outrun NOED
---
Just outrun the killer who moves 4% faster than normal 4Head

**NEW KILLER:  THE HONKER**
---
**THE HONKER WEAPON**
---
*NIGHTMARISH BILL*
---
Your bill is filled with the razor-sharp horror of a million nightmares.  Seriously, even your tongue has teeth on it.  You use this without mercy, inflicting terrible wounds on every being in your path.
---
**THE HONKER POWER**
---
*WINGS OF EVIL*
---
Use your wings to fly quickly around the map.  While airborne, your movement speed is increased by 100%.  The flapping of your heinous wings can be heard within 48 meters, and you occasionally make a loud, loathsome honking noise that can be heard throughout the entire map.  You cannot attack while airborne, and must transition to land to strike.
---
**THE HONKER UNIQUE PERKS**
---
*VICIOUS APPROACH*
---
You move with preternatural speed when not in view.  During a chase, if the Survivor is not looking directly at you, instantly teleport to within 3/2/1 meters of the fleeing Survivor and honk at an obnoxiously loud volume.  The Survivor becomes Startled for 2/4/6 seconds, during which time they will scream constantly and receive a 3% movement speed increase.
---
*SEETHING ANGER*
---
The mere presence of Survivors fills you with an unexplainable yet tremendous rage.  For every 12/9/6 seconds you chase a Survivor, gain a token.  1 token: striking a Survivor applies the Mangled status effect.  2 tokens: your attack applies the Mangled status effect and does double damage.  3 tokens: your attack does double damage and applies the Broken status effect.  Tokens are removed when the chase ends, or you strike a Survivor.
---
*HEX: TERRIBLE HONKING*
---
A horrible, nerve-wracking honking echoes all around you.  Survivors suffer a 6%/12%/24% action speed penalty as long as the hex totem remains standing.  If a Survivor destroys the totem, and you are within 64 meters, instantly teleport to its location.
---
**NEW SURVIVOR:  EARNEST P. WORREL**
---
**EARNEST P. WORREL UNIQUE PERKS**
---
*OBLIVIOUSNESS*
---
You are blissfully unaware of your surroundings.  Once per trial, activate Obliviousness to completely avoid damage for 1/2/3 seconds.  Automatically succeed all skill checks for 10/20/30 seconds.
---
"I never knew when to quit. Just ask my fourth grade teacher." – Earnest P. Worrel
---
*DISTRACTION*
---
After performing a vault, by pointing, feigning interest, and referencing the relative position of a nearby small animal, you can momentarily distract the Killer, causing them to avert their gaze for 2/3/4 seconds.  Causes the Exhausted status effect for 50/40/30 seconds.  You do not recover from Exhaustion while running.
---
"Is that a rabbit over there?" – Earnest P. Worrel
---
*OUT OF CHARACTER*
---
When the Exit Gates are open, see the Aura of the Killer when within their Terror Radius, and the Auras of all Inured, Dying, or Hooked Survivors.  Additionally, receive a 3%/6%/9% bonus to movement speed, and a 10%/20%/30% speed increase for actions in the Altruism category.
---
"You'd better stay away. I know jujitsu, kung fu, karate, tai chi, and I saw 'Hulkamania' three times. Once in slow-mo." – Earnest P. Worrel
---
The Entity Will Start Eating When You Get 6 Items, At Which Point It WILL Eat A Perk. If You Get A Perk The Entity Will Immediately  Eat The Other &amp; Continue Eating 
---
When you can face camp someone on the hook and kill them and cause them to depip whenever you feel like it. It's in your favor 100%. Can a survivor eliminate a killer from the game causing them to depip?
---
You were right.
---
*Even the straight people want it*
---
Lobby dodging isn't toxic nor can you get a ban for it. I lobby dodge a lot as survivor on PS4 because the pings can be so bad, it may take ages to find a game but no point playing a game with ping over 200 then the lag just gets me killed.   
---
As for killers lobby dodging its just crap luck if you get a few who do it back to back but its not like its the same killer over and over. If you have had a run of tough games as killer and you get a few flashlights or Claudettes come in maybe you will dodge that for an easier game for a bit. As long as its in the lobby stage it doesn't matter only bad dcing in game. 
---
Don't worry, all the clown has to do is swing through the window and he'll still hit Ace.
---
PWYF requires too much work for too little (and too easily lost) payoff. But that's just my take on it.
---
Sprint burst is light-years ahead of dead hard 
---
I personally dont have this problem on PS4. If it's late at night then I do but If you play around 4 when people are getting out of school/ off of work that might help. Also on the weekend queue times are usually pretty good. It's not always perfect but most of the time I get into a lobby in less than 5 minutes (I would say usually around 2) during those times. Hope this helps a little!
---
Must be your birthday
---
The question is why do you capitalize every word?
---
Perfect but the only thing I'd personally change is adrenaline with iron will 
---
If I get a hook when or before it gets destroyed I'm fine with it. Anything more is just gravy. The lack of time at least two survivors spent on a gen is big though.
---
Yeah but like.... it doasn't even matter its 21%... the last gen is done. The 21% will do nothing because the survivors will exit before those 21% even make a difference. Aka you need to lose the game for the perk to start working.
---
Small game is just training wheels for you to learn totem spawns. 
---
If you learn the locations it doesn't really do anything for you.
---
People who use Keys have big baby energy 🤷‍♂️
---
Nice. 👍
---
It'd help so darn much, I've had so many situations where I could survive the chase if I was given an indicator so that I could adjust to the bonus speed and instadown.
---
I didn’t notice it at first but the Claudette clicking the flashlight is top tier
---
What a chad
---
Because getting blood points is a punishment? You can find items in matches as well. I can't see this being a punishment unless you crutch on items. 
---
Eh, I Just Like Typing Like This, Looks Clean To Me
---
I detect a survivor who is upset they got murdered rather than sacrificed in their last game
---
That'd basically be worse thrill of the hunt. 
---
You only know the number of totems without anything else. Not worth wasting a whole perk slot. Make it a game mechanic.
---
I agree with his point but that alone makes him seem like an idiot,asshat or both to me.
---
Both
---
Finally made it to rank 1 survivor with a friend's help(she has over 2k hours),I'm only 180 hours in,I guess that's an accomplishment?Even though I feel so boosted lmao
---
Tyde puts trapper&gt;Pig and freddy. Not that it matters but I'm rank 11. In fact, I've heard rank 1 survivors were worse and while I'm not taking that as fact, I'd say Trapper is God awful.
---
Well now I take comfort knowing that I'm not weird or alone in that 
---
Ok I'll rephrase. If the killer is an asshole he has the option to control the game and make everyone miserable. 
---
Don't you have a pallet to go teabag at edgelord?
---
It's always hilarious when I spawn in with my other 4 teammates and we all start furiously t bagging, nodding and flashlight clicking at each other 
---
21% plus something like Bamboozle or Brutal Strength or Tier 3 Myers.... Not to mention stuff like RM, BW, and NOED exist.
---
Just a toxic survivor man ignore him.  Obvious swf you went against which is how the rank 3 made it in there.
---
I just told you, its a meme perk. 
---
The actual counter to NOED is Hope, not Small Game
---
God I wish that were me
---
Because you're countering a perk that has potentially no use until end game with an ingame mechanic.
---
If something has a counter it should either be through another perk or a player's initiative
---
Hangman's trick vs Saboteur
---
This perk counters the rather immediate respawning of hooks giving more effectiveness to the 99% strategy.
---
BBQ vs it's multiple counters
---
This takes the players being resourceful and I did going into the terror radius or hiding behind the gen or in a locker.

Alternatively you can have perks like Soul Survivor or distortion
---
Endgame perks tend to be very high risk high reward when you allow something like that to be countered too easily then it ruins the point of having them in the first place.
---
This is why I never advocate for something like a easy brain dead counter to adrenaline or hope hell is why I even think wake up should be a lot more powerful.

R:  “WAAAGH!”  (slashes at him with katana)

no, the killer can not control the game. give me a scenario where the killer controls the game (I can only ever think of one example and that's body blocking the last 2 survivors in basement)

Fedora man bad
---
Honestly real talk ik for a fact my survival rate on ormond is like 0% idk why but i just never live

First off, if all you're concerned about is rank, you're not playing right.  Also, the other three survivors can complete gens while the killer camps you, and if he gets 1 hook and 1 kill only, he depips as well.  So yes, survivors can cause killer to depip.  I know being camped sucks but as of now it's considered a viable strategy.  However, killer does not have favor in the game.  Besides nurse, killers are completely reliant upon the mistakes of survivors and capitalizing on them heavily.  Killer requires significantly more efficiency because he has to kill 4 people.  One survivor (especially on certain maps) can occupy a killer for at least a gen.  If you are sick of being camped, which is understandable, try other tactics such as stealth or utilize the plethora of strong loops.  The attempt at the rhetorical question was not effective, obviously survivors can't elimate the killer, and the killer's ONLY objective is to make sure you DIE.  Sometimes you get killers who use lame methods, but you will not see that at higher ranks, because killers lose if they camp excessively.  And if you don't already don't give the reason to canp.  If you teabag, click flashlights, point, sandbag teammates, etc., you likely will not be camped.

Juggling is toxic now? Man I’ve heard it all
---
I would love this feature. As a killer I fee slightly bad for running NOED but still sometime's it's needed to counter toxic swf. (I strongly believe it should go back to tier 3 noed that gives exposed)
---
i like how the guy with someone 14 ranks higher than them on their team is calling you, a level 13 killer with one perk, trash. 
---
logic is never these dickheads strong suits. they are the same people you accuse you of camping and tunnelling no matter what you do.
---
Although torment creek is quite a mess, it's not as bad as it used to be and it's not even close compared to maps like Haddonfield, mount Ormond resort and disturbed ward. These 3 maps need to be fixed for killers side. Azarovs and suffocation pit needs to spread out the gens out a little bit because 3 gen strats are pretty easy there for survivors side
---
but that's when you pull a sneaky yellow mori or a sneaky devour hope
---
Why? That'd make it too easy for survivors. 
---
Yeah, I just find myself at an automatic disadvantage when I am in a game with a 3 man swf. They know how many totems they have broken, and I don’t know at all. 
---
The requirements for keys are more challenging to reach than for moris.
---
This is a lie.
