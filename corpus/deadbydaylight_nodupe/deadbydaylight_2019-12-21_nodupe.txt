Maybe he was just having a bad day or drunk, etc. Not everyone has to do well every single game. Sometimes I play decently. Other times I'm terrible.
---
Ew anime
---
Settle down tiger, it's just a joke. Most people understand that Freddy has the exact same lunge range as the rest.
---
Rank 8 rn
---
I've already made my point dickhead. Billions$$$ + POTUS = not stupid. The other chap said he is stupid because of antivax, climate change and history muck ups.
---

---
What, are we supposed to go back and forth and waffle on about who has the biggest dick? Well guess what. It seems we have and it turns out to be YOU.
---
Better?
---
Rank 8
---
DUDE FACTS LMAO it‚Äôs so annoying
---
:o same
---
teabagging is just for fun, stop taking the game so seriously, i do it as survivor and have it done as killer, it's just a mechanic, like how survivors point at you, it's all in good fun.
---
Thats how its supposed to work, lol.
---
I basically just flashlight-clicked every killer until someone actually got *a n g e r y*, then proceeded to throw every pallet. I died, but got my challenge and the time it took him to kill me got my team the win, so overall, not too bad.
---
Damn you got me Chum. Lock me up and throw me in prison. Hurry before I stop caring
---
How do I 4k as survivor?
---
I adore Feng's sweater.
---
Glad to see that bug back again lol! BhVR patches it and then it comes back, just like the rest of their bugs...
---
Or be hag and leave everyone confused how such a little tater tot can carry a beefy boi like David
---
Mate you need to chill. This was just a joke.
---
Yellow Qs are instant, green is ok and purple/red are an eternity. Way more baby killers than baby survs. Deranking is pretty hype rn.
---
Tome 1 ends on January 7 so it'd make sense. Bit weird that there's going to be 0 downtime, that's a great way to make players feel like they're burning out, especially since it'll be the last chance rush to get the last levels.
---
Hanukkah pennywise Hanukkah pennywise
---
&gt; Survivors will just bang out Greats once Ruin is gone and complete the gen way faster due to the bonus.
---
That's a fair point I hadn't thought of.  I guess without ruin that skill check would have to be without a great zone, like when sealing a demi portal
---
When I first started playing Jeff I was confused as I thought that a female character had spawned next to me, but I saw no one. Then I realized that the breathing sounds were actually Jeff's.  
---
Goes to show how incompetent these devs can be. There's no reason to pick anyone other than Claudette. They have the opportunity to balance visual and audio elements so that big characters are quieter and shorter characters are louder yet Jeff and Jane are both fat AND loud.
---
Its heen timed and tested. Using only normal success checks the speed is signifficantly slower to tap. It is a strict disadvantage.
---
Its maybe only used in multiman genning, though that then compounds the effective value of ruin by so much its also a strict disadvantage.
---
Map doesn‚Äôt really matter to me unless it‚Äôs lampkin, I got adept billy on lerys
---
This is why DbD is rated 18
---
Yeah, and it will also do the exact opposite. What comes around is all around, as they say
---
**Stop!**
---
Oh that sweet revenge, even as a survivor main I loved this.
---
Recently I read tapping is as fast or slow as landing 3 "good" ruin skill checks.  That isn't very significant, is it?
---
Dark sense challenge just derank to 16 by afking 60 times. No one does gens at 16 so their all yours champ.
---
It's intentional, the tooltips for the Hag note that they "disorient" the survivors. That said, I wouldn't be averse to getting rid of it, but she'd need to have her slow and reduced lunge after teleport removed to compensate - the camera flick is actually a big part of why she can get quick hits after teleporting.
---
Surely you'd be thrown in prison before being locked up? 
---
I don't really want to talk to you. You scare me. How did you know my name is Chum? Stalker.
---
This guy needs an Oscar.
---
look behind you when your being chased psycho
---
It‚Äôs also not fun getting looped :/
---
GROOVY.
---
I would buy Dwight's sweater.
---
Who hurt you?
---
I hate the toxicity in general, but at lower ranks, it REALLY is just so shitty. Playing backyard football and acting like they're in the NFL.
---
Teabagging is ONLY for saying 'what's up' to a fellow survivor, DAMNIT!
---
Lmao took me too long to see Freddie‚Äôs but I love it

Great execution!

Thank you!

Trapper on the crapper
---
This is beautiful.
---
I'm good at Stealth/hiding. I'm decent at Tracking.
---
But I am just APPALLING at evasion or catching.
---
I really think it's practice and putting in the work. Cause damnit, I'm STILL better than I used to be.
---
What is RBT?
---
Just take my silver in hopes that I never have to read "daddy Jeff" again.
---
Man yes. I'm nowhere near a "good killer". However I've been practicing alot lately with Plague. (Aspiring Plague Main). I got into this one game that was super fucking tense. Like I was constantly chasing and hooking them. They were being super altruistic and it was just a very good/close game imo.  However by the time the last gen popped I had everyone 2 hooked except a Nea I believe. On the way to check the gates progress I ran into Nea and hooked her. By that time the gate was open. Meanwhile Nea gets unhooked and body blocked all the way to the exit gate. She tea bags me at the edge while I just puke at her. I thought those guys would feel the tense rush that I had just felt. I wanted to message all of them and say GG! However before I could I got a message that just said "GG EZ baby killer." Man that was a big letdown. I just felt so disappointed for some reason. After that I closed the game and did something else.
---
Dwapper on the crapper haha
---
Thanks homie, no promises on that daddy Jeff thing though
---
I can only hope
---
Oh sorry! Sarcasm is hard to detect through words that's why reddit invented /s
---
WOW! I play a lot of Doctor, and that sounds fuuuuuuuuuuugging GREAT.
---
Can't wait for salty dicks to STILL disconnect, because wahwahwah, why not all Killers play exact same, but hey: I'm here for it.
---
Same I'm rank 4 killer but a rank 16 survivor. I can mindgame loops but I cant run them.
---
16 is too close to 13, and the 13 was probably with the 7.
---
I understand why gen-tapping exists. 
---
Sometimes you get absolutely fucked and get like 3 skillchecks in the span of 7 seconds, losing a lot of progress thanks to Ruin.
---
If you got banned it means you‚Äôre a dick head and deserved it. Not feeling sorry for you
---
Just don't be mean to people and you won't get banned lol
---
I run Dark Sense, Dead Hard, Lightweight and Hope, I was about to pull this off easy with out need to to do the challenge, it be easy once I get to it.
---
You also said ‚Äú watch them complain about maps next year for no reason‚Äù
---
same thing literally happened to me last night, like bruh when i see 2 people going for a save im not gonna let it happen lmao
---
You could with the numbers already posted but Deliverance is probably easier.
---
My survivor experience is: Run towards next gen, forget that it's a trapper and run right through a random patch of tall grass, get trapped and spend the next 4 days trying to escape while the trapper downs someone, hooks them, bakes himself a nice mincemeat pie, eats said pie, then wanders on over to down me and throw me on a hook.
---
It was confirmed on a dev stream that Freddy is the only killer with a longer lunge because of his short arm and weapon so they cheated and just made the hit box or lunge bigger than it looks.
---
Any build that helps other M1 killers work quite well or that punish survivors for being injured. There are no perks that are particularly outstanding on Legion or synergise well with his power unfortunately.
---
I tend to use Monitor &amp; Abuse as it allows you to get closer to survivors and can also be useful during the Frenzy as it increases your T.R. 
---
Enduring + Spirit Fury is always a good combo in the sense that it can allow you to instantly recover + break a pallet which will usually net you a down with Legion. Only issue is that higher ranking survivors will know how to counter it. 
---
Infectious Freight can work quite well with Legion as it can allow you to have slugging opportunities since survivors tend to stay injured against Legion. 
---
Discordance works really well on Legion though survivors tend to expect you to use the perk since its a teachable so usually I do not run it.
---
Im All Ears could be good on Legion since it can allow you to mind-game survivors easier after they vault and since they tend to be injured, you can insta-down them if you read their movement using the aura. Can also help with keeping track of survivors during Frenzy.
---
Blood Echo seems to be an alright perk on Legion as it exhausts all injured survivors. A bit niche but might work well on him.
---
Ruin or Pop are both excellent choice for Legion. Pop can be really useful as his frenzy can allow him to use it for distance to quickly pop a gen before it is complete. 
---
Thanataphobia is a common choice for players but personally I would not recommend using it. Its one of the weakest slow down perks in the game. I would much rather use a perk like Pop as it gives you more control over gen regression.
---
but jake‚Äôs my favorite :(
---
I was waiting for someone to do this!!!!! Thank you
---
[fixed](https://i.imgur.com/nZmU5Ja.jpg)
---
I tried doing the first iteration where you only needed to stun a killer twice; after the first pallet stun the killer would start respecting pallets because they probably knew I was doing the challenge. I also ended up wasting a few pallets trying to get the stun instead of buying time for getting gens done efficiently.
---
Yea did you raid Area 51 or sum
---
If you need help with your ban I suppose you would have to issue a ticket to BHVR support service regarding it. Not sure about response times regarding BHVR support but if your temp ban is taking longer than it should be I imagine BHVR should be quick on helping you out.
---

---
Maybe he was just fucking around.
---
That's no fucking hatchet
---
She's out here throwing Axes
---
If you end up in a situation where the gates are open and you can't get someone hooked, just stay away from the gates; I've had so many asshole survivors stick around for a long ass time just so they could teabag at the gates. If it bothers you, just face a corner somewhere and leave until the game ends.
---
Have you ever failed a skill check while healing Jake?
---
We all know his only good perk is iron will...
---
I mean yeah,trapper is good for this challenge but it might become a problem at higher ranks,especially it's a SWF.It depends on the basement's location aswell.
---
I think they‚Äôre supposed to be different weapons of the same set.
---
Thank you
---
When you play SWF the matchmaking attempts to find a Killer who‚Äôs rank matches the highest of the SWF, so in your case it was you the rank 16, not you rank 19 friend.
---
As there are few low rank Killers the matchmaking has a limit of up to a 6 rank difference in order to find you a Killer.
---
The Killer was rank 12 which is within the 6 ranks limit based on you being a rank 16.
---
It's the arm that stretches, not the blades, didn't you see the first nightmare?
---
I support horny trans Kate.
---
I actually do this when I play killer. Survivor main, but I play killer because it's just easier to farm as a killer. Normally I stand there when I see a survivor and nod my head and swing my weapon to let them know I would like to farm. Just an easy way to get good blood points.
---
Englund Freddy can. Pedo Freddo only ever killed people with stabs and that one self-knifing, so we're not sure he actually has any interesting dream powers.
---
From what I remember the matchmaking is anywhere between the killers rank -6 and +6. Since you're in a SWF your group is counted as rank 16 after that change where it only goes off the highest rank player so 16 to 12 should be normal, then the "killer's rank -6" applies which brought in the rank 7.
---
to be fair, if a killer gets a 4k from NOED, that's like clutch level. sure a kill or two at endgame might happen and that's cheesy, but pulling a 4k out of it? bruh either killer turned into a genius at the end or the survivors went braindead because that is a major shift of momentum from just being exposed.

DEVS FIX YOUR BROKEN LAGGY MESS OF A GAME. STOP WORRYING ABOUT DC PENALTIES WHEN THIS GAME HAS ALOT OF ISSUES TO BE FIXED FIRST YOU BUNCH OF IDIOTS
---
What? They were supposed to be training you or you think facing people online is somehow them agreeing to train you?
---
That's an incredibly strange perspective to take into a match. You're playing with randoms, yes? You just seem to be whining about getting matched against people better than you in the chat. If you want advice you can come to this sub, but try to leave the entitlement somewhere else.
---
Are they supposed to be the same sword? I know that'd be cool, but I just assumed they were different katana.
---
Change not = nerf/buff its just a change and how can someone be doctor main his abality is to let survivor scream and let their gameplay get annoying the doctors effect are just annoying but not strong
---
I'm just too used to morons who have no idea how to play blaming everything but themselves for their loss.
---
I had a crazy thought that the doctor rework is all about making survivors ability to hide way harder
---
This is literally ash's lore
---
Just chase them out problem solved

Nah I hadn‚Äôt played much after a rank reset so I was like rank 17 and none of them had more than 1 ‚Äúmeta‚Äù perk, if even that. She didn‚Äôt have DS and the rescuer didn‚Äôt have BT. She just didn‚Äôt know what she was doing
---
That's a shit ton of moris being handed out. Them poor baby dweets
---
Gens take 80 seconds...not 40
---
Weve all been there man :( I'm sorry
---
That's another issue. I'd be happy to discuss that point as well, but that's not the point. Wether it's fun or not does not determine if it is balanced or uncounterable etc. It is obviously still important (and probably moreso than balance, 'cause people will play fun unbalanced stuff, but not unfun balanced games) but still.
---
Solo survivor with OOO is understandable and ok to go against. But ofc the killer will complain about it if swf got a team8 give nonstop info what the killer is up to the whole game. It pretty much remove the suprise and horror aspect of the game. Just ignore them bud and keep learning. Spirit take a while to learn but once you get good with her you will really stomp these type of players and later on have them cry in post chat
---
Actually went up against a calm spirit user as doc the other day.  They ran me around for a fair bit cause i couldnt track them as well around the walls in the game. Made for a very fun match though.  My hats off to the person.
---
This looks a lot like the City Hunter ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City\_Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Hunter)). I wouldn't know what episode its from though.
---
...yes, maps are also items. That's exactly my point y'all don't even remember maps and they'll find a reason to complain about them too.
---
I just reply with "would you like some fries with your salt, sir?" They usually never respond back
---
Imagine being viable in 1 of 4 platforms...this comment was made by sport gang
---
Is it just you and him? If you played together with either the purple or red one then you will Always go against red or purple rank killers
---
So is it already over? Did we really just test this for TWO days? Where all the rage babies can just take a break, play Last Year like all the streamers, and then keep going?
---
"kinda" he dummy thicc.
---
A random one from each survivor or a maximum of 12 charms on the gates and gens. It would be packed
---
The Jeff Gang approves your message.
---
I would agree to disagree
---
Rank 13 is just 1 rank behind 12 so this matchmaking makes sense
---
I thought you meant the actual maps and not burritos. There‚Äôs nothing about burritos that are ridiculous so I don‚Äôt think people are going to complain about them
---
Yea we don‚Äôt need two killers in one game
---
You can‚Äôt balance guesswork, they aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive.
---
I agree. Hawkins and Sanctum have been very killer sided maps. Though it‚Äôs refreshing for killers, it can be quite annoying for survivors
---
No winter event. Instead enjoy this Doctor who will be less annoying to play against but no one will play him anymore for this reason :D
---
Play time's over
---
Well I already do pretty well with the nurse, tryna branch out but I can't find a spirit build that fits me
---
Um what
---
Billy is pretty strong on the game map.... if you run insta addons
---
He wasn't exactly all that hot either in the first place. I never understand his fans.
---

---
I'm good at hiding, getting gens done, finding totems, and going for saves. At the point that I get caught and chased, 70% of the time I'm done for in no time. It makes me feel more empathetic to survivors who run me around and loop me, particularly when they 'gg' me in post chat, because I know they were on the edge of their seat hoping they wouldn't get downed just as much as I always am.
---
They don't visually do anything, the weapon's hit box is large than the actual weapon.
---
It‚Äôs from a loading screen on DBD mobile
---
I mean I don‚Äôt care what you do honestly. It‚Äôs your game you do you. If I‚Äôm not having fun I can hit ‚Äúquit game‚Äù and move on with my life.
---
Nah they're fair and balanced as all things should be.
---
So another basic meta build. Original.
---
I love it when people say they are going to block you and pretend that means you won‚Äôt get matched up with them ever again
---
Can you do a Jane one?
---
Sanctum is so fucking dark, though
---
I refuse to run ruin entirely on the bases that if I need a perk to make games last a reasonable amount of time than the game is flawed. Sure gens get done stupidly fast but I still won't dedicate a perk slot to the same damn perk every game. I like trying new builds and random shit, and I'd like it if I wasn't punished for not taking it.
---
In my experience, it takes 2 matches max to find a killer who will let you stun them. I got a Pig to do it with me even while she played everyone else normally. Show them you're submissive, and then point to the pallet you are standing next to. I think they'll figure it out quick. Also, take a goofy character. I think killers will be less threatened by a Detective Tapp or Dwelf than a Blendette or Meg
---
I suppose they should remove every unsafe loop, Huntress's ability, Freddy's Teleport being cancelable, directional red stain and such then, since those all have guessing components?
---
I would hope this was rhetorical but btw you absolutely can balance guesswork. The amount of instances a guess takes place turns it more and more towards conditioning vs. reading that, the risk and reward ration also massively affects wether or not it's relevant to guess right in the first place.
---
You very gracefully ignored another point btw: If Spirit's power is not interactive or intuitive, what about the multiple pallets on *every* map, large or small, that have zero outplay potential, less so than Spirit's power?
---
Play Nea.
---
Perfect Timing considering he's getting a rework.
---
It worked correctly though lol.
---
That‚Äôs pretty much what happened to me. Someone was t-bagging near the exit game because they thought they were safe but I was using NOED (I know I‚Äôm going to hell or whatever) and got them hooked and they freaked the heck out about how big of a jerk I was lol
---
Just in time for halloween!....wait a sec....
---
Yeah that happens to us all. It's like all the good survivors somehow transfer over to some secret server when I solo queue only to come back in force when I switch over to killer.
---
That‚Äôs exactly why ppl shouldn‚Äôt be cocky and teabag at gates
---
I feel scared
---
Your welcome, people dont realize that not everything they believe is fact, cheers m8
---
Thats incorrect, it takes around 138 seconds to tap, and 5 good checks with ruin ups the time from 80 default to around 93ish. Break even is something like 9 checks.
---
Scott Jund is always menioning during his Huntress games that when a survivor is working on a gen their hitbox gets taller than the gen. Never seen what he was talking about from a survivor's point of view until now.
---
Yes I‚Äôm still in ‚Äòbaby‚Äô ranks. Still doesn‚Äôt excuse camping? Your message didn‚Äôt really make sense.
---
If yo Jeff ain‚Äôt either full fifty or bloody I ain‚Äôt talking to you
---
Congratulations, you played yourself.
---
Take a break.
---
That's....nowhere near the same thing. Wtf lol
---
*assuming it just depends on your connection ohlmao*
---
Story of my life.
---
Honestly the normal meta perk builds would work the best. Yui's perks are too situational to have much impact and are better in a swf. Either go with an immersed build like Sprint burst, Iron Will, Urban Evasion and Spine Chill or like Dead Hard, DS, Inner Strength and something else.   
---
Imo Any Means Necessary is too slow, and killers usually just break the pallet after you drop it. Break Out is good in a SWF, not solo, and Lucky Break is good with Iron Will, not without it so you could probably fit it in a immersed type build but not really past that.
---
u wanna sit on the nitty gritty or just get the point that I never said we need to give them anything positive in response
---
Touche!
---
You must be a very aggressive player or a low ranks player
---
I have been getting quite a few rank 5 players and I feel like I am nowhere near their league. Usually I get just one per game, but this whole match felt really unbalanced.
---
Is this common to other players? Am I exagerating a bit and there isn't that much of a difference between rank 5 and rank 13?
---
You did fine
---
it is the law
---
Personally I never tbag unless it's at asshole teammates. ORRRR I slow crouch and stand as a sign of respect to the killer, it's not the high paced  ' f u' crouching. Idk on console theres no end game chat so that's how I communicate.
---
Spirit main here. You dont mind game a spirit. She mind games you.

True if they don‚Äôt cleanse before they do gens
---
you know you don't have to play as a specific character in order to get their teachables...
---
Send in dms... I‚Äôm curious
---
It's totally the devs' faults because shitheads keep DCing. Ok.
---
vvv aggressive rank 10, I get that it‚Äôs really good and would be even more helpful on Jeff but I find the perk really boring and don‚Äôt care to level up Jake
---
What‚Äôs the role? Being immersed?
---
I used streetwise to make my toolbox last much longer and it was great
---
I know you can get teachables on the shrine, but if you want a specific perk playing the character is quicker than waiting on the shrine.
---

RANK RESET JUST MAKES ALL THE CUNTS COME OUT OF THE WOODWORK AND ALL I GET NOW ARE TUNNELING CUNTS ANS INSIDIOUS CAMPING SPIRITS. GO FUCK YOURSELF IF YOU ARE THIS KIND OF PLAYER WHILE IM JUST TRYING TO GET BACK IN MY COMFY MID TIER PLAYER PLACEMENT. BUNCH OF CUNNELING TUNTS
---
the gameplay is subjective on which side is better. And for tension survivor for shitty teammates or killer for how bad it is gonna feel
---
no like play on your main but spend all your bloodpoints in the other character's bloodweb. 
---
ya feel me?
---
if this isnt on redbuublee soon, it should be
---
Ye, I know that's the most efficient method. Especially if you have any of the BP increasing perks.
---
How
---
Props for doing as well as you did against the fucked ranks you had to go against.
---
This is what no mither seems like to killer mains
---
the rift is eternal. unless u mean to get to level 70. i'd be level 100 by now if they kept count
---
fuckin lol
---
Calm Spirit if you face a Doctor is kinda nice.
---
killer is better, you get to feel like the star. yeah youre the star arent u? youre the pretty girl everyone's looking at
---
How about a daily and weekly challenge? Weekly ones could be stuff like doing a certain amount of gens or breaking stuff on the killer side. Then daily ones could replace the rituals and have it be stuff like you said, do a more in a match, kill the obsession, escape,  thing too crazy.
---
Why should other people's connections matter though? Isn't that the point of dedicated servers? (also why are you talking in italics?)
---
Technically, when you are working on a gen, the hitbox is the size of your character when they are standing. So even if they hit a clear foot above your head, it will still get you.
---
I mean, in lore a knife makes sense, but I kinda thought maybe another bottle. Like one from the carnival game of knocking the bottles over but the bottom ones are weighted. They would need a different mori

Hes the best in my heart

My thoughts exactly!

I don‚Äôt know how mods don‚Äôt take more of these posts down ever. This sub is so over-saturated with screenshots like this.

We get it, and we all know, matchmaking is fucked up; but complaining about it does not fix it.
---
I don‚Äôt mean to be an ass but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any possible way you haven‚Äôt seen one of the million other photos like you‚Äôve just posted.

So what about the posts with rank 16 killers against red ranks?

The guy said that in the ending.

Still, this don‚Äôt justify the ‚Äú‚Äùinvisible‚Äù‚Äù trap being unfair and still don‚Äôt justify him calling otz toxic for doing so.
---
They didn‚Äôt played well because otz avoided. The dudes knew how to flashlight save, they were playing really coordenated, the knew good loops and some mind games and etc. they didn‚Äôt play bad, also the fact that they were swf and there were a bunch of low hanks with a hank 17, to me it‚Äôs pretty clear he was smurf.
---
I don‚Äôt think their play stile and strategys weren‚Äôt toxic. Just the things I listed, in my opinion.
---
*escape animation starts*
---
100% agreed.  I'm not even a high rank killer.  I'm lvl 15 right now.  If I'm playing to actually get a 3k at least, I have to run it. If I'm just messing around I'll use something else.  And I'll get maybe 2 hooks total and say never again.
---
Agreed.

Best way to ‚Äúcounter‚Äù teabag is to just avoid the gates, they will waste their time and probably feel annoyed they had to leave without you seeing them tbag them

Doesn't the oni have a true katana while the spirit carries a wakizashi?

He is no longer the Trapper... But is now the Crapper!( He needs to get smaller tho to fit his new name, watch Samination)

When does the hatch spawn and should I take time out of my game to find it ahead of time as killer? I'm tired of losing my last survivor to the hatch but I also don't want to slug every time
---
I run ruin, nurse's calling, stridor, and discordance. 
---
I have a hard time finding people so I need all the detection perks I can get. 
---
I have fun with my friends playing Iron Maiden/BBQ/Discordance/Nurse's, but it isn't so much optimal as it is me having way too much fun punishing people for using lockers. I don't recommend it unless you just want to fuck around.

I was lucky to get the gens and pallet ones. Basement one I don‚Äôt see happening cause people will catch on and either avoid the basement or disconnect. I also hate playing like that, I just want to play normally and not be forced to use what‚Äôs considered a ‚Äútoxic‚Äù build. I don‚Äôt like playing like that so not expecting to get that one or the other basement one. I may give it the old college try but not going out of my way for it. But I agree, there is an odd mixture of really easy ones with some tougher, more luck based challenges.

This comment was made by Billy gang.
---
There was a thread a while ago discussing this topic where I saw some ideas about adding a new *necessary* objective.
---
Imagine something like fuel cans/batteries/gears that spawn around the map which have to be collected and optionally placed in a gen so it can be worked on. 
---
Instead of adding another "Hold M1 for an hour" this would force survivors to move around the map while avoiding the killer which in my opinion is one of the most fun things to do in the game. Survivors get to do something fun and the killer doesn't have to worry about 3/4 gens being worked on as soon as the game begins.
---
Give fake out a longer cool down and you have yourself an amazing survivor, this is a really cool idea and I would like to see this get into the game

Even if he dies during gameplay in Left 4 Dead, Bill's cigarette keeps smoking. The only time his cigarette has ever gone out &gt;!was when he canonically died at the end of the Sacrifice comic.!&lt; You can see this in the finale of The Passing DLC map by &gt;!going to where Bill's corpse lies, leaned up against a nearby generator with his trusty M16 nearby.!&lt;
---
Demo boi can Mori me all he wants too.
---
Freddy is just about the best killer in the game that doesn't require mastering some crazy movement skill (Nurse, Spirit) or putting 200 IQ hag traps. Enjoy him now before he gets nerfed. Arguably the best build on him is Make Your Choice, Surveillance, Pop Goes the Weasel, and then a flex perk like Ruin (I personally like devour hope in this slot) 
---
Leatherface is garbage against good survivors, one of the worst killers in the game. I should know, he is one of my most played. I like Play With Your Food, Bamboozle, Tinkerer and Ruin on him personally. Use the charge bulb and grease add-ons as much as you can. The chili add-ons are broken and do nothing, and the speed and noise reduction add-ons are useless.
---
Myers is a very versatile and fun killer to play. I like running Monitor and Abuse, Infectious Fright, Ruin and Surge on him. Dead Rabbit is the add-on I use the most. A tip is to not be afraid to go into EW3, don't save it too long and then not get to use it. Infectious Fright and Monitor and Abuse pair very well because Monitor lowers your terror radius outside of a chase making you have like an 8 meter terror radius in EW2 then when you are in a chase and pop EW3 and down someone, your terror radius is bigger for Infectious to proc.
---
Ghostface is who you should play if you want to actually sneak up on people. I run Make your Choice, Devour Hope, Haunted Grounds and I'm All Ears (or Pop goes the Weasel) on him, but the most popular build is Ruin, Thanataphobia, Nurses Calling, Sloppy Butcher. The reason I run what I run is to maximize the time survivors are Exposed, making chases super quick and keeping them on thier toes. I'm All Ears is a wonderful perk in general, but it synergizes especially well with Ghostfaces inherent stealth to make it extremely hard to escape and predict him. Pop goes the Weasel slows down games very well and I tend to get a lot of hooks with this build so I prefer it over ruin.
---
Shhhh
---
Myers weapon looks inaccurate in that picture. I thought there was some controversy surrounding the size of his weapon? I cannot remember if it was the films themselves or when Behavior was creating the character in DBD. I want to say the license holders used an abnormally large blade for Myers knife to make it that more menacing. Like the blade itself would never be that large in actual real world.
---
I used bond and I cant tell you how useful it was. Thank You!

Yep, I mean it feels bad but mistakes are a huge part of the game, and just because you did good earlier doesn't mean you can't make a critical mistake. it's part of why i love dbd so much

i had a pretty rough streak of games vs survivors that i had no business being in a game against(thank you match making) well then i had a lower rank flashlight clicking, teabagging blendette. i took all my frustration from earlier on here and tunnelled the shit out of her(i actively sought her out and ran her down) attacked her on hook, soft camped(i didn't face camp, but i also stayed just out of range for borrowed but close enough to make my way back there) during the end game he asked "why tunnel so hard?" i said "toxic survivors don't deserve to escape. i didn't care to win or lose. just needed you to lose" lets just say i went on a win streak after that and felt so much better

IF I LOSE THE GAME BECAUSE OF CAMPING IS MY PROBLEM NOT YOURS

Yeah but that goes for anyone

It's pretty neat. Especially since every time you get hit you'll usually lose chase meaning every pallet stun is a free 5% speed boost.
---
Before I saw the full image, I thought it would be Claudette on the toilet
---
I don't think you're expected to ever stay 18-20 as surv. Like only when I hit rank 16 did i even gain the ability to depip I noticed? So once you're out of those super low ranks it doesnt seem like anything but a reset will get you back in there.
---
Everyone complains that there‚Äôs no penalty for reporting and BHVR does nothing, but times like this are literally the only time people are using the report button lol like BHVR just can‚Äôt trust the report button because the games community is such ass.
---
Did anyone notice level 4 is shaped like an eye
---
I don't think the reports literally do anything at all. If it's not cheating, hacking, being a bigot, or holding he game hostage. There's a 99% chance you won't get banned.
---
Real talk, has anyone noticed Yellow rank killers getting purple - red rank survivors? A bunch of my friends have this issue where they're low purple or red rank and they face rank 16 or 15 killers. Like... game?   
---
How is that acceptable at all?  
---
And yes, the people who have to be toxic af (You can't judge too well in game but in match chat it becomes clear) and shit on people for being a "baby killer" just don't make any damn sense. You beat someone who is a much lower rank than you. How is that fair, fun, or proves anything.

I could never do that. I'm too much of completionist to just stop halfway on their perks

WHY ISN'T THERE AN OPTION TO PLAY THE GAME WITH 1-3 FRIENDS BUT ONE OF YOU CAN BE A KILLER. IS FRUSTRATING THAT YOU NEED 4 OTHER FRIENDS TO PLAY A CUSTOM LOBBY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY MATCHMAKING.
---
WE'RE MOSTLY 2-3 TOGETHER THAT WANTS TO PLAY THIS GAME BUT WE WOULD ALL LOVE TO BE A KILLER SOMETIMES. WHY ISN'T THERE AN OPTION TO PLAY LIKE THAT FOR FK SAKE!!!?
---
But my lockers need me..
---
&gt; ecause the first survivor to get hook is gonna kill himself basically throwing the game for everyone else. 
---
Hey genius, what do you think happens now when the first survivor gets found\downed and DC's right away? 
---
Honestly I think all you guys crying about "survivors will just kill themselves on first hook" are just kids mad they can't DC anymore without getting a penalty and your fragile egos can't take that you're gonna get downed and hooked and there's nothing you can do about it unless you're willing to take the hit.
---
I wish there wouldn't be tryhard killers with ebony moris and powerful add ons (see iridescent head huntress) in low ranks
---
You're welcome! :)
---
When was this?

It's possible. Now if we're talking impossible try finishing 4 gens with dark sense. Now **That's** some bullshit.

‚ÄúGg ez baby killer‚Äù

It‚Äôs not in the sacrifice enemblem

Yeah, down vote me if you want but *fuck* this idea. I've long switched out Ruin for Corrupt, but nerfing it will just make the problem worse. Unless you want to delete the killer population then yeah, these are fucking fantastic ideas.

Nothing toxic about people dcing just to screw over others.  Nope.

I did the whole survivor side today
---
Other comments have said this, but during EGC killer has nothing better to do then camp your ass.
---
On top of that, I immediately stop feeling sorry for anyone who runs DS or Adrenaline, and you should too.
---
I think they are adding it so that when a survivor DC they leave a husk behind that you can sacrifice and claim all your points
---
Accept what? I think you misread my comment in the wrong tone. Im not complaing , nor do I care really. "Gen rushing" doesnt bother me. It is what it is to me after two yrs of playing. Devs dont plan on fixing it or making changes to it.
---
Unemployment is a bitch.
---
I've used it myself, and I just personally don't see the use of extending the time between notifications. In all the situations I've been in when discordance came into play, more information would've been better at a more consistent rate. And not to mention- you'll still know if they're on the gen no matter the time, since once someone hops off, the color goes back to red regardless of the time between noise notifications. If you like discordance 3, that's great! I've just seen more people like tier 1 in my experience, and I think it should be reversed.
---
Had someone do this to me when there was a hook right behind that hook so I just walked past and ignored them as they did it, t bagged and then realized their mistake took a hit, took another, got downed and then they all got killed.
---
I'm sorry Sensei, but I must go all out, just this once.

---
well....at least the angle is nice lol.
---
What's so weird?
---
My Jake looks like Guy Fieri and all I do is get tunneled
---
Shock grabs aren‚Äôt guaranteed. If the survivor stops the same moment he goes for a grab he‚Äôll hit them
---
but stay in treatment so he‚Äôll have to switch to hit them again.
---
I hate how everyone follows streamers in this game like they are gospel. Play the game yourself and develop your own meta and opinions. 
---
Even worse is when I do what I think is a fun or cool build and someone in post game is like "nice otz build ;)".
---
"unplayable". Boi you obviously weren't around when we had 30-60 min timers.
---
Accorsing to my friend, yes she was. Poor waifu :c
---
I've never understood why people have so much trouble learning to loop. Most people that are good at looping use Dead Hard, so start with that. Then while at a safe looping area with a pallet, keep your eye on the killer. The goal is to just stay on the opposite side of the obstacles than them. If they move left, you go right. If they go right, you go left. If the killer fully commits to one side and doesn't change their path, just keep running the loop in circles until they're close, then throw down the pallet on that lap. Use Dead Hard if you won't make it or want to be a little greedy and milk the time out of that loop. Then, depending on what the killer does next, make your next play. If they break the pallet, run to the next safest area. If they decide to go around the loop again, continue to use that same area for loops. Watch the killer, and stay on the opposite side. You can now slide across the pallet to escape them, but be careful the killer doesn't fake you out. Just practice each game and you can master looping in like a week.
---
It doesn't go for the high level characters I actually play
---
These are the people who DC'd every game, and now that you can't do that they are doing the next best thing. Look at them, point and laugh, and be glad you aren't as pathetic as they are.
---
I recently had a game where I played completely fair, no camping, no tunneling. Everyone got away (kind of expected it cus i got corn map) sent a nice gg to the survivors after to be nice.
---
responses: Calling me cancer, saying im a cancer killer, kill myself etc.
---
im only rank 16 and barely have any perks. Why are people like this?
---
Freddy doesn't have to be close at all. Please refer to my earlier video post.
---
?
---
Throw all the pallets you can and hope you run into someone using the endfury build.
---
The only other feeling that beats it is smacking them right in the face after you know they screamed ‚ÄúOh shit!!‚Äù at their screen.
---
And it's 5 party streamers.
---
Freddy. He doesn't get looped, slows down the game, and has map control. One of the few killers that isn't weak.
---
It‚Äôs a shame he‚Äôs not dropping an Upper Decker.

Sad boi days

If I'm not mistaken that's a survivor perk in the bloodweb for legion

He looks 30 years older. And 30 years of Meth-er.
---
I can't believe you made Rin-chan angry!!!!!!!!!!
---
You can't depip in the brown ranks.
---
Upon closer inspection: *what*.
---
What is the reference?
---
But you can counter it yourself. Give the killer a reason to leave the hook and he will. Don't do unsafe unhooks and he won't be able to tunnel.
---
Deranking is really cancer these days.
---
I‚Äôm sorry if someone already did this I got this from a friend of mine and thought it was cool so I put it on here
---
Yes and sorry for the bad quality
---
I'm sorry, I didn't wanna have to, but I did! I had to save my Feng!
---
It completely depends on your playstyle and what perks you run along.
---
Personally I'd take Head On over Sprint Burst any time of the day.
---
Was this friend of yours a fellow redditor on the subreddit? If not then no one is buying that crap rofl
---
The killer behind you noticing that you saw ruin:
---
No I met him on ps4 also it doesn‚Äôt matter if I took it or not I‚Äôm not asking for upvotes I just think it‚Äôs interesting
---
We Deceit now?
---
Accept that? Right.. so you understand that asserting something with confidence doesn't make it anymore valid, right? We get it, you want to be able to camp, tunnel, and play like shit and still win, but sorry bubby, you'll have to git gud.
---
Don't even bother trying to loop, just wait at pallets and drop them when the killer comes. Eventually you'll learn the timing to stun killer, then use that time to run to the next pallet. Eventually add one loop once you are comfortable. Also ignore people who say "don't waste pallets" you are simply using the resource the game gives you.
---
This is me, but if I really don't like the character I just point blank will not play the character. It's annoying to flip between characters but it's worth it to not have to listen to some of the more annoying survivors, or look at some of the less fortunate survivors.
---
Sprintburst can give you alot of distance on a killer, Head on is more situational but can turn around the game if the killer walks by a locker with a carried survivor, it's a pretty rough choice but I'd say of you're looking for longer chase times choose sprint burst, if you're looking for a more of a butthole clenching perk that can make you feel like Jesus go head on
---
Yeah you deserved that one
---
Wait, who owns that giant club on the far left? Also, what about trapper's traps?
---
you got it wrong most people on this sub are the baby yoda who pretend to be the jacked yoda.
---
I did it in two tries with dark sense, bond, prove thyself and iron will. Make sure you're keeping tabs on your teammates to make sure you're jumping on their gens, and try to play stealth/stay away from chases.
---
No. Sometimes hits don't always register and that messes up feral frenzy
---
I'll keep that in mind when, and if, I get there. I appreciate you letting me know.
---
Me, a Jake main.
---
Eww spirit..(give me upvote) jk... that‚Äôs what I meant she has to mind game at pallets nurse can just go trough them.
---
This is another thing I forgot to add. I was right next to a Meg earlier and for the life of me I somehow missed point blank.
---
I see to much salt in here than I do anything to discuss.
---
I think it's fine as it is. It can be annoying but it adds a skillful component to a mostly skill less killer. If you could just keep attacking over and over it would be annoying to face as a survivor as it becomes a forced hit that you can't dodge or juke.
---
and theyre not even the guys with toolboxes to lose
---
I chuckled at billy sitting there but when I scrolled over to the chat and read it I fucking spit all over my phone dammit
---
Probably why I hate playing against him haha. So annoying.
---
I actually like calm spirit, and sabo for the memes.
---
So essentially you want moris to get a minor buff of sorts? Now that‚Äôs a new one.
---
I understand that and that's why I said that missing a strike should bring you down 45% maybe even 50% giving you the chance to miss one hit at least. the only issues I have with this is again on console the frame rate can hinder your ability to even keep up with survivors who are decent and then there's latency issues if some have a weird connection. I understand though where you're coming from I don't want old Legion where you can miss 10 times and somehow hit them on your last chance.
---
If you're more of a immersed player, Sprint Burst. If you like to meme around or are skilled at evading the killer or confusing them, Head On.
---
Well first game as survivor ended up being a rustle shackles hag. So I'm just not playing tonight because everyone is tryharding as fuck
---
I think its just lag switching.
---
Its what the entity wants, you'll eventually become a bitter killer who brings moris and evil perks to make life hard for survivors thus making them bitter and starting the cycle over again.
---
Really though, I never feel bad running moris and such. Brings smile to my face if I upset survivors... less its a group of babies then i do
---
Honestly yeah. It should just be an offering that you use as a glorified sacrifice animation. They should have zero actual impact on the game imo.
---
that's her best feature
---
Waiting for the killer to catch up is wasting the pallet, especially if you haven't been hit yet. At the very *least* you can run a simple loop till you get hit, use the speed boost to get to the next loop, then drop that pallet on the killer.
---
Wasting all the time at the beginning of the game means nothing if you turn the entire bloody map into a deadzone.
---
He trapped all around the hatch
---
Imagjne not having Michael here as well
---
legion just needs a 100% rework because the whole power is horribly conceived of and implemented
---
The Summer BBQ and Moonrise event cosmetics from last year. They disappeared from some people's inventories and BHVR said they were working on a fix to restore them to those who lost them.
---
Legion should a redesign tbh. His kit is just lazy imo
---
Honestly me rn
---
Look at what gens are the furthest from your spawn point and walk in that direction. Someone probably spawned there. You can hear gens being worked on or that have been worked on from quite the distance so you don't enter the jungle gyms they are in.
---
I'm doing this thing where I've leveled my Claude up to max with all perks, so when I unlock a new perk I play a couple games as her, then go to unlock a new teachable. Get all the good perks on a survivor first, then the trash ones after so bloodweb rng doesn't screw you
---
Imagine losing a chase because you bumped into something

How much self-loathing and hatred must you have for yourself that the only way to feel even the slightest amount of emotion anymore is to inflict suffering on others and to ruin their fun time. Face campers are sad human beings who should be castrated for fear they reproduce

I mean right now I am rank 7 killer and only ever go against red ranks. Its kinda bullshit. I haven't seen anyone above rank 4 in like 4 days.
---
When killers think that most survivors actually think that way LOL, it's like self fed delusions that keeps your stupidity fueled.
---
I usually do
---
How r u not rank 12 1200 hours? Maybe play something else
---
You hope to the entity the next trial won't be the same.

&gt; also said Wraith is one of the best killers in the game.

Lmao.

TRU3 said hes Viable so hes ***BROKEN!!!!!!!***

i sware to god if they nerf the doctor im literally too bad to play with him as it is don't make my life harder

From how I‚Äôve seen things ‚Äútake this with a grain of salt‚Äù I have had less killers bitch when I‚Äôve played survivor and had more survivors bitch when I‚Äôm playing both,
---
From how I see it people don‚Äôt opt to admit mistakes and decide to either blame the game or the killer resulting in a back or forth fight over a literal video game.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to clown survivors, I‚Äôm more or less clowning those who are saying one thing but not actually doing it, if you get what I mean,
---
I‚Äôm writing this with fuck all sleep so sorry if this comes across as rude inconsiderate or inconsistent I‚Äôm tired and need sleep lol.
---
I do have a mori saved on my main killer, but i never use it cus i feel like id be punishing those who didnt wrong me.
---
Imagine calling Demo boi an animal. Oof.
---
Who says ace has the best cosmetics?
---
False
---
It's so bad. My friend was getting super pissed because freddy was hitting him through windows from several feet away.
---
Looks like all my solo matches
---
That would defeat the purpose of a mori. The solution is punishing DCs. Why punish killers because some survivors are little bitches.
---
"Swf unbalanced and extremely frustrating."
---
99% of swf:
---
But why not the good it...
---
Me
---
If you are getting facecamped just kill yourself on hook and find a new game you big baby.
---
Imagine having to go to the lockers that reek of sweaty survivors just to use your power  
---
This post was made by the not orphans gang
---
Well you know what they say about men with long knives...
---
Why have Moris when things that were broken since launch have been fixed like bnp and insta heals. Same concept just for killers. It needs a change cause you shouldn‚Äôt be able to kill someone within the first minute of a match like gens shouldn‚Äôt be done in a minute of a match.
---
eugh her hair is so dry and damaged from that bleaching
---
This happened to me because some STUPID LEGION WITH NOED WAS MAD, BECAUSE YOU RAN HIM AROUND FOR 3 GENS AND UNHOOKED 3 PEOPLE FOR YOUR ARCHIVE.
---
Git gud
---
People must be loved my pallet eating combat pig build. Pallet stuns for days.
---
Yes I do
---
All decent players will agree face camping is a poor "strategy" and only hurts the killer in the long run. All you can do is hope your teammates will pick up on it and bust out 3 gens to stick it to the killer. 
---
I'd also like to add that people who tell you it's "just a game" and that you shouldn't be upset by it are just lacking empathy and have probably had someone say that to them. People have shitty lives and hop on their gaming systems to get away from their day to day bustle, so it can be VERY frustrating to get online and end up feeling even worse. I've seen so many suicide posts in here this year, so don't let people convinve you it shouldn't matter and is just a game. 
---
There are a lot of decent and caring people in this sub, don't forget that OP. People who are kind and considerate keep the game going, but I understand it can be hard to hold your head up when it feels like you're being pummeled match after match.
---
furry
---
Weapon bonuses:
---
All wepons receive a bonus to (Range) status after a survivor vaults an object (window or pallet)
---
Status (Range) increases by the entire map for 10 seconds after vault
---
If you're going to do a gen make sure it's in the open and easy to see. The last thing you want is to get grabbed because you couldn't see them coming. If you aren't able to afford such a luxury then just make sure to keep your eyes peeled and to always be watching your back. 
---
For Ghostface I would recommend getting used to being injured because he gets *very easy* one hits. He's also a bastard to loop as he can get rid of his red stain at will making it damn near impossible to know where he's coming from. 
---
For Micheal just make sure you stay out of sight from him for as long as possible. Besides that he is just another M1 killer who you can loop the same way as all the others.
---
All other lvl 4 challenges are reasonable though.  These three suck because they depend on everyone else. Killer respects pallets? You ain't getting fight back. Survivors dc? You ain't getting six feet under. You get hooked/tunneled or lead the killer in a chase for a long time? You ain't getting dark senses.
---
Id make a survivor joke, but they all dc'd.
---
BM?
---
I can relate very much
---
May all your totems be ignored by survivors as well friend!
---
Left is hot.
---
I mean it 
---
Im a p3 dwight main.
---
Left os hot
---
Fix your stupid ass game that obviously way favors killers and people wouldn't disconnect. I'm still going to DC on stupid shit like insta-kill Myers, don't care about the penalty. Fuck you Behaviour.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but 1200 hours is more than enough to learn how to hold w and look at the killer
---
They'll never be able to have it discern between DC and crash, because otherwise people will just task kill or unplug their network connection. One can hope for better game stability in the future, but this feature has been long awaited, especially by killers. It was wonderful.
---
&gt;!roflcopter!&lt;
---
I don't have the challenge yet, but I tried to help someone doing it by using a map and the marker addon. Marking any gen that was going well.
---
Hahaha I do this, I level my characters up to level 50, you know get all the best perks unlocked then move on to a different character... so far I‚Äôve got Claudette for self care, Bill for unbreakable and borrowed time. Feng for Lithe. Dwight for Bond. Laurie for Decisive Strike. Meg for sprint burst. I think I‚Äôll move onto jake next...
---
Watch people realize how shitty this game is and play other games when they get banned and not care.
---
streamer name?
---
Or Frederick
---
Then don't play if it ain't fun. If they still havent touched the shit and huntress has been out forever same with moris they prolly wont get changed. Nobodys forcing you to play. I have over 1k hours as well and after you get over the addicting aspect it has you see just how unfun the game really is sometimes from both sides.
---
He meant like how the oni has to collect blood instead of being able to use it whenever
---
I don't even play the survivor I'm trying to get perks from lol, I just level them up while playing my main
---
I have 1100 hours and only hit 1 once, and red ranks in general twice. I'm like rank 6 right now and it's the best rank I've had in months.
---
Second this, I'd buy it in an instant!
---
THATS WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY üòÇ 
---
pound it, dude
---
Bubba is your answer
---
I‚Äôve been here since the beginning through its ups and downs, I‚Äôve had two banned accounts which were from 2016 and 2017, I‚Äôve been around for to long to give up at this point and I‚Äôm frustrated that another dark period might be yet to come.
---
That's just the devs for you. I've been here since consoles released moved to pc two years ago. Quit playing cause of how stale and boring it became. Spent a lot of time and money into it, but it just doesn't have the drive it did before.
---
What sucks about it is that its just one more way to punish survivors (aka, cannon fodder) for a game that favors and is obviously built around catering to people who play killers. Still gonna DC here when I see a bs killer build, don't care.
---
bad manners. Nodding your head no. Smacking someone on the hook. Etc.
---
I'll provide a total count once I finally complete the challenge.
---
Oh no, he‚Äôs hot
---
Last time I had a team who was sabo'ing all the hooks I just started slugging everyone. Got a 4k, they all through a fit in the chat after.
---
More BlinkingBat awhhh yiss

DH is used for distance at higher ranks. No good player baits a hit unless really needed

Ok
---
nurse is doomed on console. someday BHVR might finally greatly buff her on console without changing her on PC. but thats only according to me. it's not something i know of that they said they're gonna do. avoid nurse on console, avoid the pain. she's by far the worst killer on console. she's very very very slow and has a terrible power.
---
As a killer main it pains me to see when other killers don‚Äôt just drop the survivor if that starts to happen.
---
I thought this was just a server or latency thing. Is Freddie's lunge actually busted rn?
---
"I understand now. Peace was never an option."
---
Animation for blinks are bugged on console. Its random and i haven't been able to replicate it consistently in kyf yet
---
I'm sorry I didn't make it ;-;
---
Right, Spirit's is technically a washizaki.
---
Ok I get it it‚Äôs supposed to be difficult but it isn‚Äôt difficult gameplay wise for me, since what they do is disconnecting so I don‚Äôt get the challenge.
---
I really don‚Äôt understand how devs didn‚Äôt see that coming, it‚Äôs almost like they don‚Äôt know a part of the community is really toxic
---
A random Jane did this right before I‚Äôd be dead on hook, I wiggled free right as the last gen popped and I managed to keep the chase going while the exit gates were being opened. Then everyone helped body block so I could make it out alive. Right as I ran through the exit gates the killer DC‚Äôed. I couldn‚Äôt even thank the Jane for saving my ass bc of their message settings so Jane if you‚Äôre out there I love you
---
I wish :(

5 games, somehow that ended up being less than I expected. Unfortunately I'm sure the bans will do nothing to deter this in the future.
---
The first thing I thought as soon as I saw this one was playing legion, I got it in one game!
---
Hahaha love this üòÇ
---
Also... *Have mercy*
---
Megs would already be halfway across the map before you can even point at them
---
No problem dude
---
Yeah, but he's not worth counterbuilding in his current state.
---
If you keep failing ruin skill checks, I will aggressively point for you to go away. üëÄ
---
Yeah, did all that. I'll have to contact support. Thanks!
---
Agitation and Iron Grasp I think helps tremendously with that
---
I had a game like that. Couldn‚Äôt touch a single gen because I kept having to pick them up out of the dirt. I got an iridescent benevolent emblem, and one of these idiots has the audacity to say I did nothing the whole game.
---
I got this in one match while playing EW1 Myers. First hits were very easy lol
---
Freddy long arms
---
it's not uncommon for weaponry to wear out, and even when well maintained, often all that remains is the blade. so, the rest gets replaced.
---
People are just suiciding on first hook, they should make it if you fail all attempts the spamming space is removed and a thirty second countdown starts.
---
Did u chainsaw walk and or perimeter camp
---
This is my moment!
---
notice how nightmare isn't in the first picture. he's actually hiding behind huntress.
---
How could you do this to me
---
In one of my games against Freddy, I was starting to begin the vaulting animation at the shack and Freddy was just entering, he swung and the vault animation was about to end and he downed me. I got sooooo pissed. I know how to feels. Even the Freddy didn't agree with that hit. He hit the window and left me. 4 gens left, all other survivors were healthy
---
I was a Jake main until they nerfed the bloodpoints for taking down a hook into the ground. Sabo essentially became worthless after that imo.
---
Depends on the killer and map
---
No *points*
---
Hell I'm in red ranks as survivor and I have no right to be here. My potato ass cannot loop long and still cannot do ruin skillchecks reliably. I'm boosted af
---
i do have both of those and still its not enoght
---
Not busted, but freddy does actually have an insane lunge. He's known for covering unreasonable distances with his attack. When going against a freddy, any space you would normally ha e between you and any other killer, you'll want to double it when being chased by freddy.

Not gonna lie it because if the ranks
---
That's true. I'm just saying a lot of people are saying to change the numbers, or make it a totem perk. But 100% regression rate only hurts the survivors if a gen is almost done when kicked, and isn't immediately worked on again.
---
Bad bot

Fix your game and people wouldn't need to DC. Bottom line.

I did not know Spotify had this feature and was greatly surprised when I saw it

i wont buy any future archive that's for sure

Whatever downvoted this is dumb
---
I play on XBOX one and I had a really good game, the first guy I managed to kill was a pink hair nea, and before the game was even over, he started messaging me, and typed "KYS Fa**ot Ni**er", he typed each letter individually so the bad language software wouldn't realize what he was doing, I obviously reported him
---
I live in NYC and the queues are barely better, probably around 10-12 minute killer queues.
---
Calm Spirit pisses me off because I love Infectious Fright
---
No they're reworking his power to be more fun for both sides. They talked about it at the end of the dev stream the other day
---
There was one sword missing in the house they updated it to two missing. So they are part of a set.
---
You do Jeff and I'll take back all the things I've said negatively about mc
---
That seems really weird. Is this intentional? Do all killers have different lunge distances?
---
Or the opposite, where someone else is going for the saves and you get 3 gens done yourself, and hide when the killer comes instead of running off like a moron... if you‚Äôre good at hiding it takes up a lot of the killers time too. But if you don‚Äôt get chased you were ‚Äúimmersed‚Äù and did nothing. I‚Äôm not going to play dumb just because you‚Äôre reckless and we all don‚Äôt need to go to save you as soon as you‚Äôre hooked.
---
Really depends. 1 million get you very close tho
---
Idk if you're sarcastic or you're serious
---
Iron will, no mither, spine chill, and this is not happening. Stay as stealthy as possible and so skills checks on gens.
---
Yea since when did your own app diss you
---
No, because I need a basement 4k not a camping 2k
---
I would say use other perks to help with great skill checks. Bring a toolbox with add-ons to make great skill checks larger or use one of tapps  or Adam francis‚Äô perks to just stay around the killer and then get a normal skill check and turn it into a great one
---
Trapper doesn't to be close either
---
Oh then idk why.  I have no problem playing a good "bill hilly"
---
For killer it‚Äôs leatherface no question and for survivor it‚Äôs whatever you feel survivor perks get changed pretty regularly so up to you
---
Uuurnnngghhh
---
Yea it's has been a while I think. What was the last time? Legion release?
---
Ok, then stay and shut up.
---
Because Bubba has a reputation for basement camping probably
---
Buy the Leatherface DLC. For survivors buy the Halloween DLC
---
Yeah was also thinking Laurie for ds
---
Probably cause he's a tiny boy. Has the same hitbox range as the other killers, so it seems like he's reaching farther than other killers are. 
---
 
---
 Think of all killers and survivors as moving boxes. They are all the same shape and size. Each box is invisible. Inside each box is a 3d image of the killer or survivor you are playing as. Now because freddy is smaller than say, trapper or Myers, means nothing. Because his box is the same size, his attacks will technically hit the same distance without him fully moving the same space.
---
Still gotta go get survivors off the bear trap unless you're running that one addon that downs them
---
I sharted my pants
---
If you need help with better perks I‚Äôd say look up their teachables on YouTube to get a better idea of the ones you‚Äôre looking at . I‚Äôd say a good solid chapter is the Spirits imo next to maybe Ghostface again in my opinion just for play wise anyway
---
If lobbies were instant and filled within a minute like they were in 2016/2017 (for both sides) the dc penalty would probably have more of an impact.
---
Dudes.... dudes... the PS4 though? Kill me. I hate going for saves now because everyone doesn‚Äôt. Like it‚Äôs tragic af. I either have to get myself off or just leave them if I want a win. 
---
Someone else is running the hunter? Oh do a gen.
---
Someone is getting hooked? Oh, hide in the corner.
---
Like I know we get camped. And we decide instead. To all be at opposite sides of the maps.
---
But even if there is no heart beat. And we can see the hunter In the basement with that person. We shall neither save nor do gens with the other three while that person got the middle gen done. 
---
But I‚Äôll still save you with them camping boys. I‚Äôll still  heal you under the blasts while a hunter chases someone.... ... because this. Makes us a team. 
---
But no really y‚Äôall make me want to buy a pc for this. You can 360 a hunter on ps4. We can be great! We‚Äôre made for this my beautiful meat beans! Rise! And even if we fall a bit. We can still rise more.
---
Me at red ranks when a yellow player fucks up a gen:  
---
*Don't worry, I have spine chill. Just keep trying, it's hard at first but you'll get the hang of it.*  
---
*Oh, and max David first.*
---
Its all about practice, if u watch good streamers/youtubers play the game on rank 1 you will pick up certain habits. And in no time u will prolly be red or atleast purple ranks too and i can tell u not every rank 1 killer is a god so just keep playing and improve
---
Telling them to ‚Äúhit gud‚Äù when they are trying by also going against new survivors but because everyone is toxic no one keeps playing anymore
---
Roughly 1.500.000 if you don't prioritize anything and focus on the cheapest routes. If you grab something you want along the way, could be a little more.
---
You can always bring a tool box. Also maybe run Bond, because skill checks count if you‚Äôre healing.
---
*Laurie, David, and Meg*
---
I just meant when in general when it shows you your year, I don't allow myself to be defined by one genre
---
I just played my first game today, so i‚Äôm confused what this means. How will you know where you‚Äôre going and don‚Äôt bump into things. 
---
Do you mean they frequently look behind them? or that they are literally walking backwards essentially with eyes fixed on killer.
---
This how I feel I don‚Äôt hoe stay feel like I enjoy the game anymore most the community is just toxic talking and acting
---
*"this is strategy just deal with it 4Head"*
---
With one of his yellow / green add-ons calm spirit is effectively useless.
---
Sabo is such an underappreciated tactic. Man I love it.
---
Are they artist renditions or the in-game models?
---
Both are pretty problematic i say they could both do with changes. mori could atleast be that you need to hook every survivor atleast once before you can mori someone and keys should maybe only open the hatch for the individual
---
Good choice sense ds was just in the shop so it might be a while till you can buy it with shards
---
I love the long hitbox addons, you hit so many people through windows.
---
Was it in the shrine?
---
Imagine using your power
---
This post was made by the pig gang
---
I just run stakeout with basically anything and be sneaky around the killer for tokens- takes a bit if your flinch happy about the radius but still a good option
---
So which survivors do you consider annoying and less fortunate?
---
Trapper on a crapper? 
---
That I gotta see
---
@rin
---
NOED. Doesn't count.
---
*The Oni on a Poni*
---
So far, I‚Äôve been running spine chill to get a better sense of where the killer is, especially when I‚Äôm on a gen. It‚Äôs helped me get a bit more distance when found by the killer so that way I can make it to a pallet. I‚Äôll have to try windows of opportunity!
---
Moris and Keys are both shortcuts for reaching your objective earlier than you should. Both are a problem. 
---
Keys have two requirements: Do some gens and wait your some teammates die to claim your reward with other 1 or 2 survivors.
---
Moris have two requirements: Hook the survivor once and down him again at any point.
---
I like to be one note
---
Bro I dont know what you're doing. But I see too many people save, to the point of everyone going for it. Or you can just be that guy and not compare yourself to the baddies who dont play as a team. If a game bad, next ones different. Or play swf. I hover around 4-6 and dont see this problem. I also save everyone so it's not that big a deal.
---
Killer's don't like going to Flavortown
---
If it was lifted, why would he play on an alt account?
---
Idk but this is an old ass post.
---
Imagine being so map reliant we half to DC at the beginning of the match
---
*This post was made by every other killer gang*
---
Mimic killers would be too weak because of SWF. You could have a system where you point if you aren't the killer or something. It wouldn't work
---
Use Stakeout from Detective Tapp, the great skillchecks you get from that count.
---
Exactly what I said. I don't find her fun. I'm not getting this power she's supposed to have, even after playing with her nonstop. I tryhard my ass off and watch 4 people run through the exit gates when I could have done better with anyone else, even the friggen Clown.
---
I'm kinda new to the game sorry that the concept isn't good
---
you're a dick lol
---
Yeah I think that's just a big that happens
---
Shockingly, yes. When I practice something, and refine my technique, and look for ways to do it better, I get better. Again, what world do you live in where that's not how it works?
---
üëèDaddyüëèMyers üëèButtüëè

No, it's balanced. Some killers shouldn't be punished just because they happen to have a shorter weapon and/or are short like Pig, Clown, and Ghostface.
---
I messaged you if you wanna talk about receiving salty messages. I too am on Xbox and it feels like it happens every game.
---
I think their point is, they challenge themselves to play the character they‚Äôre leveling (where they might have shorty perks) instead of farming bloodpoints on their main (with good perks) and leveling someone else
---
Nooooo not my cute baby dwight
---
No I play both
---
Iron Will then never put another point in
---
Why's he unzipping? Doesn't he know we want to see his beautiful pecs.
---
That‚Äôs like a mix of all my matches. They will wait to the very last second and have the already damaged one go for a save while the hunter is chasing them. S/O to that guy. He  is ballsey. But the other Two suck for making him do that. And while it‚Äôs not a big deal for you, it‚Äôs annoying to the rest of us. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying everyone on PS4 is bad, it‚Äôs just they don‚Äôt play the same on PC. We do have it a bit harder, but we can pull through if we try.
---
(But six matches of people doing stupid shit and not using their stuff is annoying) 
---
But they will learn. We all just get to bitch about it cause it‚Äôs annoying.
---
*angrily gurgling noises*
---
True ok, nice flair BTW
---
They need to make a alternate kill style were he‚Äôs like 50 feet away and just stretches his arms and stabs them lmao
---
I'm not even upset at flashlight people anymore because of the archives
---
I know a ton of people are trying to do their challenges
---
Unless you start clicking, then it's personal
---
Stop being stupid, time doesn‚Äôt make you better. What don‚Äôt you understand about skill/knowledge. People spend years trying new skills in life and get no where with it, but some pick them up in a matter of days. Are you a robot by any chance? You seem to believe there no human input and error in anything
---
If you get the match cancelled message then the offering is returned back to your inventory, and you have to reselect it when you queue again.
---
I used to have this problem, I put myself in the killers shoes and wound up mind gaming myself. In reality you aren't facing a red rank killer who's gonna moonwalk or play loops perfectly.
---
Not worth the small chance that you get a doctor
---
You could just... not run bond?
---
I'm ngl, pretty shitty for him to say, but I didnt expect that and it made me laugh

It's only useless if you suck

Go fuck yourself with Meyers' pipe.

Completely agree. Watching others taught me so much in the start, and the pallet thing is very true, especially when there are windows you can use to extend the pallet life even more. Another great way to be a great surv is to play killer. It really teaches you how other killers think, and makes predicting their plays much easier
---
Yes. A shitpost mori based on what reddit complains most about each killer.

I‚Äôm referring to the movies....

blighted huntress with the hound mask got me like
---
OwO
---
I didn't even notice her the first time I watched the video when my friend sent it to me lol
---
Ohhh I see, I'm glad I haven't experienced that, that's really shitty.
---
I got it on first try and it wasn't that hard. Obviously it also depends on map size and basement location. Mine was done on Wretched Shop with basement inside shack.
---
Like I said, if survivors notice you are trying this the entire match, they might troll you on purpose.
---
this is what swf SHOULD be, a bunch of friends laughing their asses off
---
I‚Äôve started to give up on humanity a little more ever since I joined this subreddit... But you guys are right, it puts Jane to shame.
---
Lmao gen rushing I think there playing the game
---
I wish people on the dbd reddit didnt see a new meme and immediately copy it.
---
So they nerfed from 15 to 10 and level 4, which "should" be harder, is just 5.
---
Cool. Not complaining, just... surprised?
---
Got this first try as spirit in hakins. Just kept slugging.
---
I have. But a mori based off what people complain about would be hilarious. A freddy mori that shows freddy killing from way too far away. A huntress mori that has her throw her hatchet to the side of the survivor, and the survivor still dies. A leather face mori where leqtherface just stares at you till the entity suddenly grabs you (facecamping)
---
i think you're just unlucky :(

Dude congrats! How did you do your six feet under?
---
Probably.

---
Sweaties come out late at night.
---
**The Return of The King**
---
I'm also surprised, I'm glad they removes 2 flashlight blinds while someone is being carried in one match, from level 4. Usually you can get one flashlight save/blind during pickup before the killer starts min/maxing and looking at every wall.
---
No i get that, i was reffering the fact that you have to place them, and smart survivors will undo them if given the chance. It's overall a 1 use only move
---
Yup it's obnoxious af. That would be a great perk for a solo survivor and would be a lot of fun to run with object or obession even if the killer could still see your aura
---
Something that made my loops last a lot longer than they used to is not panic vaulting. Looping around a safe pallet? Bait the vault over the pallet and the killer will double-back 9 times out of 10 (in my experience). Looping the shack? Don‚Äôt immediately vault through the window and look behind you, in case the killer is going around to cut you off once you‚Äôre through it.
---
If the killer is anywhere on the map after hooking a survivor, they are camping. 
---
If the killer goes after a survivor that had previously been hooked, regardless of how much time or how many other survivors he has hooked, the killer is tunneling.
---
No matter what you do or how fair you try to play, survivors will always complain the killer is camping/tunneling.
---
Hangman‚Äôs trick should give you oblivious when sabotaging a hook or trap. Just like demo portals.
---
I'd say maybe 15% play this horribly and it's rare for all 4 to be bad all at once
---
I'd prefer survivors waste time and tbag at every pallet drop. They could be getting way more distance.
---
This game is killer sided.. hahahahahaha
---
Ok buddy hahaha nice one
---
I‚Äôm one of the demo player left
---
I can't get through the agitation challenge, I only have it on level 1! It makes me so mad aaaaaa

God, I feel this on a spiritual level. Literally every game I've played today I've had a killer tunnel or camp for no reason. Killers think they're just entitled to ruin someones game as they see fit and complain about anything survivors have to stop it, eg DS and BT. Just got out of a match where a ghostface basement camped me and the rest of my team for no reason and to make matters worse they were one of those people with 'direct all salt here' on their profile. They know what they're doing and there's literally nothing stopping them from doing it. Devs honestly need to step up. It's going to kill the game.
---
Nice photoshop. Bill would never replace his cigarette
---
Looks like Steam sales are going to be present until Jan 2 so it means two weeks of shrine. I recently hit jackpot so I can buy 2-3 DLCs. I want to decide which ones to get after seeing all shrines before 2nd. Is that logical? Also what DLCs can you recommend? (I got bbq, pop and DS so far, so I'm not sure about getting these DLCs)
---
I honestly wouldn't have a problem with her traps if they didn't force you to look at them. Like damn bitch, I know you're there, I heard you already.
---
They definitely don't. Every game I've played killer's gotten up to 20-25k points for facecamping while everyone else only gets like 8k points. Not only is there no downside, it's just straight up encouraged considering there's no downside
---
I don‚Äôt think there is any reasoning behind the colors, there is only 3 color rarity‚Äôs anyway which are common uncommon and rare, which colors don‚Äôt matter but what tier stripes they have matters.
---
Sadly most Streamers rely on teabagging/gesturing/BM‚Äôing in order to ‚Äòstand out‚Äô and gain more views.
---
**i feel something**
---
Hehe boy
---
A survivor with a key can hide in a locker all game, do nothing, wait for his team to die, and still get the hatch with the key, you inbred hypocrite clown.
---
Why do you think his knife is so big?
---
Actually most people on this sub are pretty noob, given what their opinions are
---
BHVR needs to stop it. It's such a shitty mechanic and the devs have just decided to downright avoid talking about it. They need much heavier punishments for camping and tunneling
---
*when you open your mouth eating spaghetti*
---
What are you, brown ranks?
---
They either arent streaming or they'll say lag/hotboxes are fucked
---
Yea but if you place one after tp you will always have one they can‚Äôt touch
---
Usually the case with most online multiplayer games
---
The comment literally said 99% of swfs are like the video above. As a killer main i can PROMISE you that at rank 1 that is NOT the case and therefore, while funny, the above comment is wildly inaccurate.
---
I don't understand why you didn't walk through the closer doorway.
---
Luck is kinda worthless just because deliverance exists. Why have a chance to escape hook when you can have a 100% chance to.
---
Wraiths mori
---
Some maps, yes. My friend uses this strategy while we run Nancy's inner strength perk. Let's us see any totems he's ran past so we can get quick heals.
---
Game is definetly killer sided if you're solo queue. In terms of power, killer's in the middle, SWF are way up above and solo players are way down below. It'd ridiculous especially considering any survivor nerfs just kick solo queue down further and swf just stay right back up where they are
---
Because I clearly didn't see a pallet in it when looking trough the window, which meant the other one had the pallet. If this shit wasn't invisible.
---
Wut uhhh anime is that brother
---
I don't understand, all I saw was you reached madness 4. You now only see illusions of the doctor running around the map.
---
No color doesnt matter but some tier 3 perks are still green because the devs believe they are weaker than very rare (purple) perks
---
Sh\*t went from 0 to 100 real quick hahaha
---
I actually finished it with Doctor in one go. Just added STBFL and smacked the survivors a lot.
---
Aah. I've only recently started playing as a killer more often, so looking through windows for pallets isn't something of a second nature to me yet.
---
it pisses me off when they say "oh i guess ill just let all 4 survivors escape then."  As if camping is the only way they can win

[Laughs in Ghost Face main]
---
So now, instead of playing against Nurse/Spirit/Billy at red ranks, I see nothing but Spirit/Billy. Nice.
---
This is such terrible advice. That *is* wasting pallets. You might survive for a little bit playing like that, but you will still eventually get caught and you‚Äôre fucking everyone else over in the process because there will be no pallets left for them to use when they get chased.
---
True! Got a loosing streak? Than take a break
---
**dip dip potato chip**
---
Archives bring the worst in either playing killer or survivor. They made it that u need to play like a d&amp;ck to get these archives done. I immediately understand if a killer has the step on trap thousand times archive or the basement hooks. I wouldn‚Äôt mind helping but let me remind the killers when there is a Double Blood Point event, they bring Moris and Rare addons and their reasoning is...‚ÄùLet me play the way I want‚Äù.....so, some of the can literally f&amp;ck of :)
---
You saying this makes me giggle, not because you're incorrect as I honestly believe you probably are correct, but it's the fact that there are so many good/utility perks that are green and the % that are useful that are green heavily outweight that of purples, kinda funny nglüòÇ
---
Nea's forever
---
Clicking the flashlight is also toxic IMO.
---
Konosuba. Her name is Darkness, and she's a masochist.
---
If a survivor did that they would get idle crows and be found and hooked.
---
yea that's what im saying but its just devs being devs.
---
You're just bad mate
---
I hit rank 1 easily as solo. It's not hard at all, I even did it perkless and with no mither to have a challenge. It's ridiculously easy
---
Even when I play swf I rarely use any "meta perk" and I go with plunders or no mither and self care to meme around. I, and the people I play with, still pip even when we do that
---
This game is far from being killer sided my dude. I'm not even that good as a survivor like other people are, I'm pretty average tbh. The nerfs you're talking about are because how the game was back in 2016. There are still things that are broken for survivors favor from back then
---
If you have no idea what are you talking about you shouldn't have those opinion and just play the game. God loops still broken af and stuff like the keys and moris still a thing and the first ones can be saved with an add on, found in the trials and used several times
---
Gens are still done way too fast and everyday more people learn how to waste killers time by looping making every 1v1 scenario sided towards survivors since you can't pressure gens if a chase last 1min and the gens are done in 80s.
---
Solo or not what you said is factually wrong
---
True that
---
sloppy isnt really helpful on freddy (in my opinion)  but its a bit better on spirit. definitely would replace it.
---
This subreddit but most people here don't seem to even be playing the game much
---
Everybody gangsta till Michael joins the chainsaw gang
---
Aight, thank you.
---
Should you mark this NSFW?
---
One one hand, it definitely is.
---
On the other, if you're on the site to use this number combination you already better not be at work
---
I bounce between purple and green, and I almost never get matched with green survivors. Always red and some purples sprinkled in between. I was trying to learn Pig the other night and I lost two ranks because I kept getting 4 man red rank SWF squads. They were at least nice though.
---
The very first time I saw it I cracked up enough that I actually had to stop playing for a minute. I hadn't realized that would pop up and I'm certain they thought they got a good blind and got away as I went afk for a good bit to stop giggling.
---
No problem! Id suggest ruin.
---
I always stop and slowly turn to them, then slowly turn back and resume when I wanna joke around.
---
What should i put there? No hex perks if possible, hate those.
---
Because everyone would toggle it and swf would never find a lobby
---
Konosuba. I highly recommend this show, it's funny af.
---
I‚Äôve seen shredded pieces of paper more put together than this team.
---
Completely understandable. In that case id suggest nurses calling.
---
The basement one took 4 games, and twice I lost it because a dickhead survivor kept wiggling off my shoulder and hiding in the corner of the map to die by endgame collapse rather than give me the hook. You know who you are Jane
---
Alright, thanks alot.
---
Honestly though, this is the absolute truth lol. I've already started saving up ebony moris on my nurse and spirit and I've barely cracked 100 hours on killer. If they want toxic, they'll get it.
---
Sloppy good on freddy with Nurse calling, but better change sloppy on thanatophobia or ruin
---
True, but I‚Äôve also seen it in game as well though not *nearly* as much
---
That's true. I just love seeing other people who like the game.
---
Well I mean they did a pretty good job so far.
---
I appreciate it very much. My title doesn't contain any rant, just a "TIL" because I was actually surprised. 
---
These repetitive challenges are better at a low number indeed.
---
What‚Äôs the rework?
---
Same but only 800h
---
Imagine getting this with spirit
---
Same. I feel like a god until I hit rank 6 or so and then I'm like... how am I still pipping?!
---
well not with that attitude he isn't
---
Well done m8
---
favorite: piggy
---
least favorite: bubba
---
My favorite is Billy. 
---
Least favorite a tie between Spirit, Hag and Freddy.
---
They might buff the tape now that the range addons are not a thing
---
However, legion did get left behind
---
Favorite- micheal 
---
Least- doctor
---
Nurse got nerfed. You can‚Äôt obliterate as easily anymore.
---
&gt;my problem is getting the consecutive great skill checks
---
I don't think they need to be consecutive? That or I did it without realizing it...
---
anyways Stake Out is very helpful for the challenge. Hex: Ruin skill checks also count still.
---
Yea on this subreddit most people are friendly and all but once you get into actual game you see what majority of community is
---
The bonus charge time made it impossible to stop windows and gave survivors enough time to run away from the zap zone.
---
Range addons made it easier to play against you if the survivors knew what they are doing 
---
Also, the best range add-on (thanks to the power of mathematics) wad the yellow one
---
YEAH, I LOOP
---
L- Drop every single pallet I see while being chased
---
O- Have an existential crisis if I hear the killer but don't see them
---
O- Run to where the other survivors are
---
P- Vault every window aimlessly and end up blocking all
---
Favorite is trapper having to worry about where a trap could be is fun
---
Least favorite is doctor and clown cause I know I'm about to get tunneled the entire game
---
nurse‚Äôs calling is good on spirit. just get within range and phase over to where the survivor is and boom, it‚Äôs a free down. it‚Äôs even better with m&amp;a if survs expect you to have the perk. for myself, i‚Äôd replace sloppy with it.
---
A lot of things can be in a toxic context. I just think cheap playstyles or the particular way things are intended to be can be toxic. It's hard to explain but basically you can just tell if it's meant to be BM.
---
Its fuckin good gum too
---
I can give you some tips if you want:)
---
Yeah I was talking about in game, it‚Äôs never lit or has smoke coming off of it I game for obvious reasons I guess, I still feel like they could make a tiny bit of smoke come off of it that goes to the top of head head model so it wouldn‚Äôt give him a disadvantage but still would have it lit. Also they could have it lit a dull orange.
---
I wish bad dbd players could stop bitching about other players being better than them. It is like that in any multi competetive game. You are bad=you get your ass whooped. Thats why you want to be better, to win. You really want that free win dont you
---
On Freddy i suggest Surveillance over Discordance, and Surge over Sloppy, but thats still a pretty solid build. Also MYC is super strong on freddy, especially if you hook them near a gen.
---
An oni with a eboni
---
Nothing is toxic if you don't let it bother you.
---
This wouldn‚Äôt counter genrushing at all, it only effects gens not being worked on. This perk would only make people want to stay on gens or tap them so they don‚Äôt begin to regress.
---
**Most underrated comment here**
---
Have you ever heard of exaggeration? There‚Äôs a 99% chance that‚Äôs what the commenter was doing
---
40 seconds would be allright I guess. 20 seconds is just too short IMO.
---
I‚Äôm tempted to farm all game with them with traps in the killer shack and then noed them all in the end and hook them. They won‚Äôt want to dc because they‚Äôve gotten a lot of points. I also wouldn‚Äôt mind if that was the end result if I was survivor because the killer was nice enough to farm. And if you play trapper they can max survival with traps so escaping doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
Light mode ree
---
Hag. Trap stairs/around shack. Interrupt altruistic saves.
---
It still doesn‚Äôt register hits sometimes, even when you recieve bloodpoints for protection hits.
---
But yeah, it is a bit better now.
---
That's what I'm using it for. Survivors can still hear a chainsaw when oblivious. They can't hear the 90 foot woman though, and when they're broken and on the other side of a wall they are dead as dead. But my idea is more Furtive Chase + Nemesis. I see who unhooks and where they go, but they don't see me.
---
:'(
---
Suffocation pit, ironworks, wretched shop, fractured cowshed, shall I go on. Look up objectivity.
---
fr tho, I had a trapper daily and I never play killer so I had no perks on him and Im also rank 20. Got matched with a toxic sfw that kept teabagging me and flashlight clicking. Ended up getting 2k with one DC. In end-game chat they called me an animal and told me to kys. Love this game
---
Earlier I had to get a kill as huntress by my own hand, so I said to myself "I'll bring a 1-kill mori and pick whoever is the most annoying"
---
Yui with 800 flashlight save attempts who pulled her teammate off the hook 2.3 seconds after I walked away from it? Sorry, you get the axe.
---
well not 'cheated'  but just 'so close youd get pissed off'
---
I am confused
---
If you have an accidental DC in your game, you shouldn't be rushing back into a game instantly anyway, you should be looking into your internet stability. I agree that 30 minutes might be too long (15 minutes sounds more reasonable), but the last thing I want people to do is to try immediately again without doing any preventative measures.
---
Praise be to our teammates who loop the killer on and on.
---
I mean you can see why they called you a cheater, anyways if you didn't do anything wrong no need to be afraid then cuz the devs can check that out
---
Yeah I'm currently prepping footage from the entire game so I can send that to the devs. The whole situation really confused a lot of people, especially myself, and I don't want to risk anything.
---
Outside of being completely false (if you think killers are the ones deciding the outcome of a match you haven't played past rank 10) DCing just because of a personal preference ruins the game for 4 other people and saying that you don't care at all about their enjoyment already excludes you from the discussion.
---
Stop blaming the killers and survivors instead blame the developers for poorly designed challenges.
---
[Undetectable](https://i.imgur.com/wTUormO.jpg)
---
Hmmm I don‚Äôt know how to really improve this my imagination sucks :(
---
Farming is actually stupid to do because overall if you play 2 non-farming games you can get the same amount of points you'd get in one long ass long prolonged farming match.
---
Its a pretty known bug. I think it happens with sprint burst as well. Youv got the evidence that you disnt cheat so you shouldnt have to worry about gettin banned
---
They‚Äôre called challenges not farming time. I get the developers are shit it‚Äôs been a running theme for this game for years now hit boxes, perks, nerfs, buffs etc . I get the devs suck but just cause they are bad means that challenges turn this game into a farming sim?
---
Oh so if the object of obsession is looking in my general direction and I have undetectable I can see them through the wall and they can‚Äôt see me?
---
Literally
---
A lot of Challanges from Level 4 were changed, you can see the old leaked ones when you search for them.
---
Hey how do I audition for this pro team?I'm only a rank 10 but can I please join this pro team?
---
Imagine getting hits 
---
This post was made by pig who just got cOUNTERED WITH SB
---
I made a basement hag build for that but we‚Äôre putting points into my doctor as he‚Äôs getting reworked.
---
I haven‚Äôt noticed the time running out and got into the match as doc
---
Bbq, distressing, devour (destroyed at 0 stacks), Nurses Calling. No addons, red ranks.
---
Clown map with the basement in the middle. I‚Äôm like ‚Äúfuck. A good map...‚Äù
---
But then I thought it might work!
---
I have met many bugs this match, many more than it‚Äôs normal. For example, 2/4 basement hooks broke and I couldn‚Äôt hook people on them. It bouced me off and canceled the hooking animation
---
I had 3 basement kills, closed the hatch and the last person knowing what I‚Äôm doing, ran to the corner of the map over and over again just to fuck with me. Like gdi you‚Äôre dead anyway, stop being a dick
---
I eventually got her to the basement, she wiggled off and entered the locker. She tried to head on me, i got the grab animation which got canceled by her entering the locker, then i opened the locker which got canceled by her head-oning me (good fucking job BHVR, dedicated servers working great)
---
With like 10 seconds left on the EGC timer, I managed to get her on the basement hook
---
Oh god looks like I need to hit up jake.
---
Pretty good job!
---
*RIM-SHOT*
---
Yeah I remember seeing footage of the exhaustion bug literally years ago, didn't think it still existed in any forms. As you saw in the clip BL didn't activate it, looks like the game just responded really poorly to a hit and for some reason didn't turn off the speed burst I got from that. (The teleporting suggested that my client was trying to make me run at normal speed, but the server thought I should be running faster)
---
100% my swf.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the unhooking right under the killer without BT.
---
I think leave it as it is if you badly want a DLC perk get that DLC
---
I get to rank 1 every reset too, dude. The problem is your solo queue experience is 100% up to the teammates you get, not your own personal skill. I can run the killer for 10 straight minutes and there can still be 5 gens cause my team has either been looking for ruin or idling in a corner every time they hear the heartbeat (and this is rank 1 before you ask). It's basically a 1v1 while SWF is a 1v4, and as you would know it's pretty hard to do 5 gens by yourself. Besides, it's hard to play the game between the 20 minute queue times and the facecamping and tunneling killers (every game I've played today I've been camped and/or tunneled. No exaggeration). 
---
The game is 100% killer sided if you're solo queue. SWF are the power role. The killer has the middle ground. (Not to say I've definitely gotten some solid teammates as a solo player but it's so rare it's basically nonexistent, ngl.)
---
I feel dumb that I didn't buy demo on sale (PS4) .. But I play Tapp for sure
---
I had the power of 69th upvote!
---
........so stop doing that
---
Yeah the bugs been around i wanna say since the last mid chapter but im not sure. Its not super common thankfully but still shoulda been fixed by now
---
pvming makes the game fun for me. If you ever give osrs a chance, try to go for chambers of xeric (raids1). People learning sometimes go in with really low stats, but the rewards are really high.
---
Sounds logically right
---
These 3 problems create the sensation of gen rushing.
---
Because Exhaustion Perks always allow Survivors to get to ridiculously strong loops, and toolboxes allows Survivors to repair gens stupidly fast, you don't have enough time to down Survivors.
---
Yea there also is a grab 3 in tome 3 and grab 2 in tome 4. Grab 2 gives you more points
---
If they are poorly designed and are ripe for exploitation they are going to be exploited.If you tell me that I can instead farm something and finish it in a tenth of the time it would normally take , I will do just that.Players are not at fault for not wanting to spend their time efficiently.
---
I'm struggling still with tier 3 ü§£
---
uWu *notices bulgy wulgy* w-what‚Äôs this...?
---
I'm jealous of people who enjoy running non meta perks. I just can't do it.
---
Me with every survivor except Jake tbh. I just level him up and get all perks cause I like playing him for his skins
---
"You don't have to camp me" "oh, you want me to just let everyone unhook you then, entitled survivor main?"
---
No, I just want to play the fuckin game, dude. Sheesh.
---
Yea as long as your undetectable and their looking at you. You will see them
---
it happened to me once i got M1ed by a Freddy. Once Adrenaline popped, the infinite haste status disappeared....
---
Not taken alone, but when all 4 Survivors have them? They are certainly too omnipresent.
---
Especially when the cooldown is only 40s and resets upon being unhooked. 
---
Tru3Ta1ent has recently shown how you are better off bouncing between Survivors, rather than chasing them in a more traditional sense. But Exhaustion Perks counter this, due to the tiny cooldown.
---
SLUGGED 2 SURVIVORS WHILST DOING THE 4 IN THE BASEMENT CHALLENGE. WALKED AROUND THE ENTIRE MAP LOOKING FOR THE 4TH. FOUND HIM JUST AS HE WAS ON THE VERGE OF BLEEDING OUT. 
---
CLUTCH.
---
HE STRUGGLES. 
---
I REACH THE HOOK. 
---
HE DC'S AS THE ANIMATION PLAYS.
---
TIME FOR A 19 DAY BREAK FROM THE GAME. SEE YOU WHEN THE RIFT FUCKS OFF.
---
Hoping my video will speed up the fixing process. Thankfully it looks like there's no way to intentionally trigger it
---
Which is the shitty part, it's a problem that can't really be solved without completely revamping the game mechanics. Besides, what are these methods we're supposedly ignoring, then?
---
Sabotage hooks. Many skillchecks, netter chance to land a few greats
---
Yes , it's very frustrating . The devs should make it so when the survivor DC's it still counts , cuz unless you go against potato survivors chances are you are not gonna complete this challenge .
---
Favorite: Michael, Ghostface (in moderation), Nurse (console)
---
Least favorite: Spirit, Clown, Plague
---
Haha oni on a horse. I too understand the joke my fellow gamers *dab*
---
I find the pilot one really nice, I even bought him for that reason.
---
But it's not enough. Exhaustion perks give too much benefit for too little effort.
---
Sprint Burst - Probably the most balanced, due to forcing you to walk to avoid triggering it. But, it basically hard-counters most Killer abilities. Simply increasing the Exhaustion time would be fine.
---
Lithe - Simply have it not trigger on medium vaults, that way the Killer is rewarded for properly rotating the Survivor.
---
Balanced Landing - Are you on a hill? You are now invulnerable to most Killers. Simply increase the distance from which you must fall to trigger this, plus it cannot be activated off of a vault, as this compounds the already slow Killer vault speed.
---
Dead Hard - the Killer can successfully block a pallet/window and DH allows you to PASS RIGHT THROUGH THEM and use it! Have Dead Hard retain the physical collision to stop this and on-the -spot DH to avoid hits. Now DH is only good for gaining distance.
---
Tonight on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Basements!
---
Exhaustion perks are what make gens seemingly too fast, as every chase becomes too long.
---
Your name is ironic considering you didnt look at the image for more than 3 seconds before making a throw-away and flirting with her üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Throwback time to when the game was not even a year old and I used to run Meg with Sabotage sprint boost self healing and botany knowledge.
---
Yes
---
Borrowed time or We'll make it.
---
Killers can see the glow from further away, depending on map visibility. Can't see it while stealth
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôve said the in-game reports/‚ÄúDid you enjoy the match?‚Äù functions serve no purpose anymore. If you don‚Äôt make a full report in-game and also make a Ticket on their Support Website, nothing will likely happen to whoever you were reporting unless they were full on Hacking/Cheating/Exploiting.
---
Too many people report for petty things like ‚Äú‚Äùtunneling‚Äù‚Äù or ‚Äú‚Äùcamping‚Äù‚Äù so a lot of reports must go ignored unless you really want to make the effort to do all the steps. Chances are you won‚Äôt fill out 2 forums on a different website just because some Trapper proximity-camped you, but if a Wraith is speedhacking youll likely do it.
---
Zimbabwe Bubba
---
Exhaustion perks are a crutch. I haven't used a single one, outside of playing an under-levelled Survivor forva ritual, in over a year and I find chases more challenging and much more thrilling.
---
I have to always be away of my surroundings and my position so I can make it to a pallet or window.
---
If I can keep a Killer occupied, it's because pf my skill not some BS perk I've brought with me.
---
Are Spirit and Demo still missing their lunges?
---
No one gonna play leaving gen at 99% expect u play SWF. IF you do  all generator 99% progress and the killer is smart play PGTW ,Thrilling Tremors, or overcharge. 100% your swf team gonna to lose anyway. No one gonna leave gen at 99% anyway.
---
Lol do you do know what triggers it, like is it only from interrupted grabs? :0
---
Yes thats exactly what I mean. You see nothing wrong with the emblem system in general?
---
My favorite is Ghostface, he's so fun... But a good hag, I'd rather dig my own grave
---
Bruh why your perks looking like they in the 14th dimension
---
At the green-brown ranks, maybe.
---
Try playing at red ranks (which I'm now stuck at, thanks to the new rank reset!) and you'll see how difficult Killer is.
---
Watch this video to see how Survivor-sided the majority of maps are:
---
https://youtu.be/B17QdQ2db1w
---
*AGH! YARA YARA!*
---
I'm not saying that, I'm saying you can get on anyones progressed generator to finish it, so it's not some ridiculous 0-100 gen thing
---
Plague, I just love being a constant insta down.
---
Same
---
&gt;A lot of Challanges from Level 4 were changed, you can see the old leaked ones when you search for them.
---
Most of the level 4 was changed... They used to be all Master Challenges.
---
I dont get it if this actually happens, so what if they have clips lol, play the game however u want camp every game and get 1 sacrifice everytime who gives a shit
---
Ruin is overpowered? HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAAAAAA.
---
1. Most games, it is smashed in LESS THAN 60 SECONDS. Then it's gone. For the rest of the match.
---
2. Learn to hit great skillchecks. Then Ruin basically does nothing.
---
3. At the red ranks, most Survivors just power through it and the perk does basically nothing.
---
Steve got hooked!
---
Neebs would be proud
---
its cute do more
---
*I went into my perks and selected Dead Hard*
---
*I walked up to a killer and took a hit*
---
*If I press my button I'll run fast and avoid damage*
---
*I pressed my E key and was EXHAUSTED ON THE GROOOOOUND*
---
*I'm not a fan of this system!*
---
*Dedicated servers are bullshit...MAAAAAAAN!*
---
I spent 10 minutes trying to basement hook some running to the edge of the map fucker. When I did get them there it didn't count because of a dcing fucking Yui.
---
Love this trend of taking a good meme format and posting your autistic anime faces over it
---
inb4 "genrushing? you mean doing the main objective?"
---
With the current ranking system, I don't think it's possible. They might adjust one value and people will be all in purple ranks again. Even now, I find myself pip more when I die than when I escape
---
and for killers, it should be changed even more.
---
you're punished for doing too well on both sides. Looping for 5 gens and getting camped and killing all 4 survivors with so much pressure they can't unhook eachother will both earn you a depip, even in green ranks. It's like the game saying "oh, I gave you too weak opponents, lets give you even weaker ones!"
---
You have a very bland definition of hot shit.
---
Exactly! I don‚Äôt see why people think it‚Äôs toxic
---
I agree. After the exit gates are powered, there is no such thing as "camping" in my opinion. If there is NOED and I'm the one hooked during endgame collapse, I just kill myself, when everyone is at a save distance to the exit gates. It's not the end of the world if I don't escape after getting so far. The risk of getting others in trouble is way too high, considering I'm most likely to die either way. I think the best option for the other survivors is to just leave (or look for noed if they really, really want to save).
---
When there are only two people left, I'm injured and the other one is on the hook, my rational reasoning is to either wait for the hatch or to leave through the exit gates (if they are open). Sometimes they ask "Why didn't you get me?"... well, we're both almost guaranteed to die if tried.  So, if I'm the one on the hook I kill myself, too, and hope the other one gets the hatch.
---
you can change your perk icons
---
Ironic you've been downvoted.
---
You don't know whst a mind game is. You're saying its closer to a lottery system when it is not.
---
But you can pet the crows with Calm Spirit‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs S tier and we all know it
---
Obviously not your fault but why didn‚Äôt you stop
---
Haha you said autistic! Comedy!
---
First time?
---
Clearly this meme is great
---
just try to finish that t4 rift quest dude and you will understand how hard finish 4 gen. Even though you can get on anyone progressed generator, they will finish it without you there. ( When you chase by killer many gen already done of your friend) Basically if they finish 2 of the generator without you to turn on the finishing move at the generator. The quest already fail. And like I said "who is gonna wait you to come and doing finishing move at generator?"
---
If I fuck up I just crouchcrouchcrouchcrouchcrouchcrouchcrouchcrouchcrouchcrouch

the problem with dead hard is the massive delay that got introduced with dedicated servers.

either be a sneaky boi or a fast as fuk boi
---
They finally made the game balanced
---
Use an "Everyone spawns together" offerings if you're worried about it also. Or use better together so they go hey, that person's doing a gen let's help.
---
Apparently the pig I tried to boop didn‚Äôt get the memo. It didn‚Äôt end well for me.
---
Decisive strike upon getting DS'd, eye for an eye.
---
You do realize they probably didn't get all the gens, right?
---
How did I not notice
---
I gave up on that challenge. Wait times are too long for me to die so quickly.
---
You're not taking into account the challenges... You get a lot of points for completing them.
---
Holy shit I remember that video, 11-12 me wasn't quite the same afterwards.
---
I would be funny if it stunned you both.
---
I understand what you're saying, but I don't agree with it. Agree to disagree I guess
---
It really does. I'm going to go out and answer my own question and say they won't make ranking harder as less players will be at red ranks thus leaving players to deal with longer loading times. But no, I agree with you. The whole system needs an overhaul.
---
my friend got this on wrecker's yard (map with an easily accessible basement) and not hooking anyone in the basement until they were dead on hook
---
makes it way less likely they're going to dc. much harder of course though.
---
I don't know, the survivor ones look pretty brutal. 4 gens with Dark Sense is basically impossible without some coordination. Killer looks like a walk in the park and I'll hopefully be able to reach the epilogue after I come home.
---
A good Hag can seriously take advantage of this too.  There are some traps that I place that I don't ever intend to teleport to, I just want to interface screw your camera.  Have fun running into a corner.
---
I wholeheartedly agree with you (from the other perspective).
---
I may have 1000+ hours in this game as survivor, but if the killer spots me, I'm dead in less than 20sec. I can't loop for the life of me. But I do gens, I save and heal people etc. So, if I get a match where there are others that run the killer around and I can do my thing with doing gens and saving the chased survivors from the hook, I still pip, even though I was downed ridiculously easy. I'm not having fun, knowing I let down better players than me. :(
---
Just make it so when a person Dc‚Äôs more than twice a day he will gain no bloodpoints or rank progress for his next 3 games
---
Put on iron will and you'll get to red ranks in no time
---
If you use self care long enough can you get your confidence back?
---
Every game camped and tunnelled
---
Get out of Rank 12 and it won't happen as much. It's also easy to pip too
---
Bruh but of humans are animals... then are we zoophiles ourselves
---
I'd rather it start on say a tuesday and end the following tuesday that way people have a whole week to play and get double bp
---
Are they doing the miku leek dance?
---
sick catchphrase
---
I don't think that's the case. Some people are better at different play styles.
---
thanks
---
So I'm new to pc dbd, I played ps4 dbd for a little over a year. In the 2 weeks of pc I've been playing all I've seen is long killer wait times when I'm rank 18 slowly working to where I was on ps4, and the dumbest matchmaking I've ever seen, is this a common thing? I always get paired with groups like this or low green ranks and even seen a red rank on the small amount of killer games ive played. It makes me not even want to play killer on pc and just play survivor with my friends because I have the skill and the matches are fun, but I need certain perks to stand a chance against these kinds of survivors and i dont have them yet.
---
honestly its not really that noticeable until you are up close. you wont be putting out an unnatural glow from across the map
---
What‚Äôs the harm in it? If you‚Äôre so desperate to sink your sweat into a ToXiC match, then do your gens and move onto the next one. You literally lose nothing. Furthermore, what rank are you? I‚Äôve played almost 24 hours of DBD this week and haven‚Äôt had a single farming killer.
---
&gt;I'd rather it start on say a tuesday and end the following tuesday that way people have a whole week to play and get double bp
---
Bloodhunts ruin DBD for as long as they last. It wouldn't be wise to make these events so long and devs know it.
---
Thank you for the info
---
No, it's not explicit, it just shows mike in the beginning process of taking a leak.
---
Maybe im trying to be too optimistic but it may be system thinking you are good than average rank 18(like a smurf basicly) and putting you against higher ranks.
---
I didn‚Äôt realize playing a normal game is considered sweaty and toxic lmao. I‚Äôm also rank 6 rn I haven‚Äôt had the time to play that much. And that‚Äôs good for you I‚Äôm glad you haven‚Äôt I unfortunately have. And I don‚Äôt want to spend 10-15min to get into a 30min farm session when I bought this game to actually play it.
---
It's not that deep, I was talking about the Release date vs the Cake day
---
It should count if someone dcs
---
Ghostface for sure... it seems at green ranks its ALL you ever see (atleast on ps4) i very seldom go against any other killer so its tiresome playing against the same one over nad over again. favorite to play against is probably Huntress (who i actually used to hate) because i can juke and loop them for days until they get frustrated and either dc or just leave me alone for the rest of the match lol
---
I so badly want to be a good huntress but struggle with the hatchets
---
np
---
Elf Dwight Says‚ÄùFuck off You cunt I‚Äôm runnin Obsession in the locker ekksdee(Does day Ekkksdee)
---
It just takes practice, I used to be doodoo and now I'm still doodoo but not so doodoo lol
---
I got the dark sense one in my first game at rank 4 survivor. Might have gotten lucky but none of the tier 4 challenges have seemed that difficult for me. Just my 2 cents.
---
It was a good game, I enjoyed it, but they did wipe the floor with me and my build, and it's possible but this has to be at the most my 10th game as killer on pc, I couldnt see how skill could already be considered when I'm not that far in the game yet. I'm more upset for other new killers that may be going through this and just not having a good time with the game, so I wanted to see if anyone else is dealing with this since I'm new to pc and ps4 wasnt anywhere near as bad
---
No numbnuts, I mean the ID number for the doujin lol
---
How do they ruin it?! Farming happens I'm still leveling killers and survivors for perks!
---
i feel called out because i have leveled every surv i have just to get all the teachables.
---
For real. The "hook __ survivors in the basement" was fine but the "sacrifice" and "have __ survivors in the basement at once" challenges just promote boring and frustrating play.
---
This is what I joined Reddit for üëÄüòÖ
---
By now I know most tiles and the overall layout of the maps (I mean I still played quite a lot), but my biggest problem is the "start looping correctly" part... If the killer is just holding W while chasing me, alright, I can run around for a bit, but when they start mindgaming I'm completely lost. I'm bad at reading and predicting others. At the same time I learned that I'm bad at looping, since I wasted a lot of pallets in my earlier times. Now I'm EXTREMELY shy to throw a pallet, even if it was the right choice from the other perspective.
---
I'm just very insecure about my abilities and that is easy to exploit. :(
---
Uhhh....
---
*canned laughter*
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a connection issue
---
People don't have unlimited time to get out of their way and grind for some of those man. Why you angry.
---
No
---
You mean having to charge the ability to charge your charge ability
---
For me personally I find variety in survivor games to be the key in keeping my enjoyment. Simply holding m1 or running the entire match gets boring so quickly.
---
So you have time to sit in games and farm for the same challenges you can do in game? I get every situation is different I‚Äôm just over farming. I‚Äôm not even angry I just want to play the game. They are challenges for a reason.
---
Writing this while getting facecamped in the basement by a trapper at 5 gens. So I can actually test your theories on camping. 
---
BT: You can only tank 1 hit with BT. Killer will just get right back on you. Not to mention you actually have to get unhooked first (which i can't (cause I'm being facecamped(in the basement)))
---
Baiting the killer away: literally doesn't work if they want to camp. They'll just sit there and look at you. They aren't moving, just like the trapper down here with me. 
---
Doing gens: only works if your team has half a brain. Surprisingly, 3 gens popped then i died. Killer still has 2 gens worth of time to find and hook another guy. Not that it matters for me cause I'm, y'know, dead.
---
As for tunneling, body blocking only works with a SWF that you can plan and organise with, DS only stuns the killer for 5 seconds then they're right back on you, and 'not getting down away from loops' has the same energy as 'just don't die lol'
---
Sure, the methods you listed work, but they're just not reliable. If the killer wants you dead you're going to die, especially with 3 teammates that don't know what they're doing.
---
You better take it all back.

---
May not seem like much, but this is an accomplishment for me. I started this game about a month ago despite owning it for a year or two, and gotta say, its been overall pretty fun. The hardest challenge was probably Six Feet Under (4k in the basement), which I managed to do after hours of playing with the Hag. The easiest was probably the Spine Chill one for me because it was a Killer that legit just... never found me until the very end where I escaped through the exit gates. **I m m e r s e d**.
---
In the future, BHVR, if you're reading, please make challenges that do not promote toxic playstyles such as camping the basement please.

During A Killer Queue? My Killer Queues are literally 9 seconds. Meanwhile my Survivor Queues...Ooof
---
Like I said I‚Äôm not even angry but I don‚Äôt have a lot of time to play this game either so when I do I actually want to play the game.
---
His Wicked Wares Outfit is pretty neat. Chad Confirmed
---
When it comes to this new system it's just a ladder and everyone's going to end up in red ranks. If you get to a new color treshold by the end of the month you just get set back 1 rank.
---
I easily have to wait 20-30 minutes some times on killer queue. But sometimes survivor queues are the same. Guess it's just the flow people playing different things.

So she does something and makes you think she‚Äôs doing something else. Are you too dense to realize that‚Äôs exactly what a mindgame is?
---
From my experience with people on this sub, most fall under the 1st category. Based on their opinions of the game at least.
---
The pallet was undetectable, yes.
---
Nah, about as far from the servers tho. England...
---
That‚Äôs a legion
---
Dude, it isn't you; DBD chugs on any console and it sucks as killer, it's half the reason why nurse is hardly ever seen.
---
It honestly depends on how someone defines a "legitimate strategy". Facecamping *could* be considered legitimate because it guarantees a kill. Is it a *good* strategy? No, you're saying goodbye to three generators. Is it still toxic? Absolutely.
---
You win reddit today.
---
I feel like you were in one of my games cause I was camping basement hard on Hag for a while.
---
Thanks bhvr for listening criticism since you're so out of touch from your own game making challenges and bad changes all the time forcing the community to call you out
---
Thanks for being so honest on stream too, showing us how oblivious you are towards balance. At least you *kinda* listen even if you reply to cherry pick questions in the Q&amp;A, avoiding any question we are actually interested in
---
Thanks for saying you guys are focusing on "balancing towards fun" which is a totally dull statement since fun is subjective
---
And a special thank you for the balance team who thinks the deep wound effect was a brilliant idea. Especially the guy who is in charge and made the flashlight change only after McCote got humiliated on an event in Korea
---
McCote is the only one I would thank, as well as not queen and the art design team. I don't have any respect to the balance team or towards the 'community managers' that cannot do their work
---
*footage gets corrupted*
---
Thanks for the answer, I've had my Xbox since day 1 so I was starting to get worried as it never chugged as hard as it has been ever since Oni came out
---
Oh Neptune. That's my bad, I saw it at like 144p and just saw the white mask and short killer, and assumed it was Ghostface. I really should sleep now...
---
Rank means nothing, there are enough people that deliberately stay at 16-15 (survivor and killers alike) that have way more skill but it's just easier to get BP.
---
I'm around rank 8-7 with killer and go up against red ranks all the time, and I can tell you not all red rank survivors are the great players you think they are...
---
Looks more like Kaid from rainbow six siege
---
I got my adept nurse on farm so xD
---
It‚Äôs just the overall poor game performance on console. I get the most frame drops while blinking with nurse, throwing hatches with huntress, shocking with doctor &amp; on getting bloodlust.
---
The game's about murder. 4 people getting hooked and it's by a killer. Not Stranger Things simulacrum lol it's gonna get brutal and I wish it wasn't so personal. IMO it seems so much easier to tell somebody GG rather than to complain about some nonsense in a game that I already played
---
Yeah i'd say 7/10 times it's used for distance, BUT, if you're a real good survivor, they will always time their dead hard amazing and save their ass, even if it isnt for distance. I'd say i've had a lot of times where i dead harded, not for distance but because the killer swung and it has saved me on countless occasions (that's if dedicated servers don't screw you over :p)
---
Could be the new map. I haven't played on xbox, so I can't compare to how it is usually compared to fairly recently on that platform; all I know is that PS4, I don't know if PS4 pro is any better, struggles sometimes.
---
I guess you can practice skill checks
---
Also why didnt you go for the other door it was closer
---
The community here would have you believe it's too easy to rank up, and I don't really disagree. Most people who play a ton will be able to reach red ranks (1-4) before rank reset, and I say this as a noob who plays a ton.
---
If you do find yourself getting stuck at a rank though, it's probably going to be 16, 12, 8 or 4 because that's when the pipping requirements get higher.
---
Why are you not collecting rewards?
---
You need to literally AFK to lose pips. If you move, you safety pip. If you do the bare minimum (1 or 2 solo gens, 1 or 2 unhooks, run from the killer a little), you pip.
---
Got it with freddy in 1 go
---
I said in another comment that
---
- I looked trough the window and saw no pallet there, which meant the other entrance had the pallet.
---
- Turned out the pallet was invisible so gg me
---
- I didn't know someone was there but if someone was there I could've gotten pallet stunned, was my mindset
---
I just stop and look at them when they fail the skill check and then proceed to gen tap
---
That's awesome
---
Yo is this a meme that I haven't heard about yet? Had the oddest experience a few hours ago where a Bubba sat in basement with Insidious (their only perk, at level 1) the whole match. Revved his chainsaw to scare off my friend then simply waited again. I didn't know he was down there and hid at the bottom of the steps when I heard a heartbeat and nearly jumped out of my skin when I was slapped with a chainsaw from behind. 
---
"Ah frick, I'm dead" I thought, but the kindly Bubba simply escorted me off the premises and plopped me at the top of the basement stairs. He then retreated into his cozy basement for the rest of the match while me and my 3 friends left. All in all, a good match.
---
Yeah then you could say that t-bagging is a legitimate strategy if your plan is to take away the killers focus.
---
That was back when hooks didn't respawn and you could ruin the game for the killer by making the basement hooks the only hooks on the map
---
Another thing : if the killer spotted you hiding they don't have to be cheating. If you make any noise that YOU hear, the killer can hear it too (locker opening sound, grass moving, footsteps, breathing too, ...). Not even talking about Nurse's Calling or Whispers which help a lot.
---
There was a box always where is a box there is pallet
---
And the pallet was invisible.
---
/r/PerkByDaylight
---
What does SB mean?
---
You wouldnt see pallet from that angle
---
Congrats buddy. I ain't that far behind you
---
Sprint burst
---
I would've saw it propped up
---
Use The Hag for it. She is an amazing camper and can proxy from very far away. STBFL would be a great perk to take for quick downs when somebody tries to save in the basement.
---
I would've saw it propped up, I had an entire view of every angle of that opening to the shack
---
why? :)
---
Notice from which side claudette dropped the pallet
---
I'm in this post and I admit it. Was gonna make a sorta lewd joke but chickened out.
---
What does it do if against doctor?
---
I don't get it
---
He was my starting character
---
Nice
---
Like 80% of people who I have checked their profile has a VAC ban tbh
---
What's blood market?
---
I know matchmaking is a little wonky right now but I'm not seeing an issue if you were red or purple rank on another platform. You obviously have the skill to get that rank so why does it matter If you are white rank at the moment when you've been red rank before. I'm obviously going to get a lot of shit for this comment but c'mon. This subreddit is already cluttered with these posts.
---
I get that glitch multiple times a day. Sometimes it will open the bloodweb on Steve and show Ghostface crouching there
---
I use it more for the auras
---
I am not great at it, but i consider myself pretty good. When the camera is looking in front of me i memorize and choose a path for myself, then immediately flip it to see what is going on behind me. The thing is you already need to be familiar with the terrain, or else it is difficult no matter what.
---
Freddy's dream world helps you see this map alot better. As survivor and killer.
---
I mean, I can take a photo if you want. I'm in Aus, rank 1 solo survivor (rank 2 if you want to be exact, still red ranks tho)
---
It's certainly not that many. But there are patterns. Billies too often have VAC. Huntress is just the most compatible with conventional hacks.
---
I‚Äôve never seen it
---
This exactly. I'm around 6-7 killer and 4-5 survivor and I've seen some pretty bad red ranks.. hell I've 3k'd red ranks and the white rank that got put into the game survives.
---
I stated I had fun with the match but lacked because of not as many available perks at my disposal, my main point is why does a white go against purple, not for just me, but for other killers, all I've seen are green, yellow, and purple ranks and I wanted to see if others are experiencing the same because I dont want noob killers going against survivors like this and having a shit experience with the game so early on
---
The chaos
---
haddonfield may not but my landing is
---
Yeah I heard it was just addon changes, omega blink, 4-5 blink, nerfing the range addons and adding ones that remove blinks in return for speed (which are fun as heck to use btw) I just can't seem to get more than 1 kill without having to slug, tunnel, proxy camp, unless I'm running the 2fast3quick addons and Play With Your Food. I like addons that change up the playstyle, hag and myers are fun examples. But the power change wasn't necessary imo, I could get some really fun solid games without addons before the changes, whether I got kills or not (I'm stuck in greens for a reason &gt;.&lt;)
---
I practiced for hundreds of hours and I was still bad at it. I liked using lithe a lot and it gave me bad habits. Now I'm using Windows of Opportunity and Dead Hard and I'm getting better and better. So I would say getting the right perks is also really important until you get really good at it.
---
I did it in four games. I did 5 gens nearly solo. It wasn‚Äôt a farming game.
---
What is an ASMR?
---
Pop helps tho
---
I get your main point and i do agree it can be frustrating for "real white ranks" aka new players. I want to say I absolutely mean  no disrespect in my first comment and was just giving opinion or thought on the post. I do hope match making is adjusted for new players

You should be able to make it. I feel I won‚Äôt be able to finish the challenges tho especially the blinds
---
No way!! Hahaha nice escape my friend you must have been laughing
---
Probably, but it was intended to be a katana.
---
True that pilot one IS miles better then the rest of them
---
However, they make up for it with height simultaneously, as they are shorter and harder to spot over loops.
---
that's so wholesome
---
That‚Äôs honestly dope
---
If they go for a ranged hit you can use it when they pull back for the swing, it takes time but once you get it down it is really helpful and you take the guessing game out of when to use it.
---
oh she gobbling
---
Sadly I got knocked back down and bleed out to death since he slugged me and the other guy.
---
In my experience the survivors will try to hit their great skillchecks at some point, but there's a huge risk of being punished for that by pressing slightly too early. In most of my games it's explosion galore due to this

---
wait. yall running kindred even though it's a swf???
---
Rank 1 means the players are better, so the SWFs will be better so most of that 1% will be in rank 1. Also do you check every survivor every game to see if they are a SWF?
---
I did mine tonight after getting really lucky AND unlucky.  
---
My entire team was down to the huntress - but I was avoiding the hatchets. They were getting beaten while I was minding my own business on the generators lol  
---
I got them all out of the basement (although they went down quickly after) and 3 of us ended up surviving! It's one of my proudest moments in dbd - and all I had to do was ignore the huntress while she murdered everyone :D
---
Bro no worries, i'm rank 3 and shit at looping, I just use stealth. If they find me i'm dead lol
---
I know, I've never had such nice teammates as these ones who threw in as many coins as they had and let me give them presents, or the team before that that brought in brand new parts to hand to me so I could do gens with Dark Sense. This batch of challenges has been the nicest survivor experience so far for me.
---
Darn you... *angerly upvotes*
---
If that's the case than it seems reasonable. Guess I need to not jump to conclusions when I don't have all the info.
---
When you watch so much Monto you actually start thinking his name is bam bam...
---
Is it not 0?
---
&gt; Calm Spirit if you face a Doctor is kinda nice.
---
&gt;thats calm spirit not iron will
---
You don't say?
---
Errrr yeah you‚Äôre the toxic one, ever think maybe they didn‚Äôt want to farm and just wanted to get out of the game?
---
Wait what? Really? I need to run Calm Spirit in all my builds now!
---
I just afk and derank passively when doing something else. Fuck BHVR if they want to screw SWFs by forcing red lobbies on anyone in the party then ill just afk my pips away.
---
You act like this is happening every single macth...I play both sides and as survivor during the last double bp event I counted and one killer out of thirty wanted to farm and playing as killer well I make the rules of that match soooo...
---
Lol. I would love to go against you as Nurse.
---
Should have Dead Harder 4head,
---
But really man that's so aweful
---
2 dc with 4 generator up and tht trapper put you in the basement...... What an unfair piece of candy!
---
&gt;Just don't understand why a perk with a very clear downside doesn't have much of a positive to it at all.
---
Challenge perk. That's it
---
No need to buff it, maybe just extra bp for using it but that's it
---
No you dont, just relax, it was simple mistake. Take a bath, scrub it with bleach so that its cleaner. 
---
But if you still somehow say stuff like that then just,
---
Drink the bleach
---
If they just wanted out of the game, they could've just went straight for the exit gate. It was open, it was the only reason the endgame collapse started, and she clearly knew where it was due to her teammates. She also just had to not participate in the farming session by lobby dodging, and look for an actual game elsewhere. All of these survivors had plenty of opportunities to just not farm, but they never bothered to take it. They also refused to assist with the only one farming, and the killer never mentioned that most of them didn't want to farm so I could treat it like a normal game.
---
Imagine having to reload,made by plague gang
---
Favourite: Pig, because she‚Äôs cute
---
Least favourite: Is either Doctor, Clown, or Hag. 
---
(Screaming sucks, get sick from gas, trap anxiety)
---
I think the people who are on the dbd subreddit are the type of people to say gg and leave the lobby
---
I'm at red ranks too, but I told my teamates that I had it and one of them 99d his gen for me to finish it. People can pe nice sometimes, even in this game
---
Demon weeb on a sheep
---
Yeah they obviously didn‚Äôt want to farm. It‚Äôs not really a ‚Äúfarming session‚Äù if only one survivor even wants to do it, just leave your teammates be next time
---
All I‚Äôm saying is that the devs indented it to be a katana
---
I‚Äôd be dancing too if they were playing Madonna
---
Oni on a poni

---
I am a man of my word
---
*GG EZ*
---
I feel like the problem isn't survivors vs killers as much as a whole lot of people are just mean. I've gotten facecamped while my team does 3 gens and in the postgame chat the killer accused us of being a SWF and genrushing. It goes both ways lmao.
---
Ok maybe they were just grateful to get a game, either because of queue times or killers dodging because they were swf it‚Äôs entirely possible they‚Äôd been waiting ages for a game.
---
Why should they have to disconnect during loading just because they don‚Äôt want to farm?
---
What does this even mean?
---
You are complaining about ranking differences, if you wouldn't have trouble you wouldn't be complaining you would be playing...
---
\- Everyone knows the ranking system is FUBAR but ranks don't mean skill (they should, they just don't).  
---
\- Just play the game, suck up your frustration and get better, always get better. Killers will always have trouble around good SWF groups, that's when you gotta play smarter, 4-man random is just hack-'n-slash, 4-man SWF is where your skill really gets tested. But in the end it's not ranking that makes a difference it's your attitude and the will to change routine that makes you a good killer, not whether you got  higher ranking.
---
It was a fun game but challenging, especially cause I was memeing and decided to use all hex, it was a 2k but what do you expect
---
I‚Äôm surprised you didn‚Äôt get hit when you vaulted the window
---
Wtf no
---
Fair play with the 2k. How did the survivors react?
---
Alive by Nightfall
---
With all the mistakes (on the eyes of some) BHVR still does far better job at balancing their game than suggestions we see from 90% of this sub so. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
---
Deep Wounds is, indeed, a brilliant mechanic. Shortly after implementation I was pissed at it because I couldn't see people mending with Nurse's Calling but after playing a bunch of survivors, I agree with this mechanic 100%. It made DBD far more enjoyable without affecting gameplay too much. 
---
DBD is in good hands (unless you are a sweaty player on either side).
---
While fun is subjective, mechanics that cause boredom for the majority of players are quite easy to single out.
---
it's an exploit. They made a survivor lobby with one survivor and one killer. The killers was "SWF" with one of the survivors
---
its the opposite of "Dead by Daylight", my mediocre banter xd
---
no buffy no mither. Don't kill our memes
---
Yeah a 4 min match... seems legit
---
You look like the evil Santa in the 2nd Santa Claus movie with Tim Allen.
---

How can genrushing be an accusation? "You did the things you are supposed to do how dare you???"
---
I remember ages ago not long after I started playing saving up all my points just to level Jake and unlocked Iron Will as a teachable so I could have it on my Nea. I got it and it was great, I was so happy. Next day it was in the fucking shrine.
---
Me but with Yui and Any Means Necessary

I don‚Äôt know.

I'm starting to feel your sole purpose in life is to be a headstrong, ignorant, arrogant, asshole. I'm not getting frustrated, the all caps was meant to draw your attention to the words so your dunce brain could maybe understand my point seeing all the select words instead of reading everything. I even pointed that out in my reply saying why they were cap, and its not championing for the newbies, that's not my point, if youd read and take in information and maybe get to processing it, cant say how developed your brain is, its showing small iq, but my point was to see how others people's matchmaking are and see if they are as bad as mine or if mine have just been an anomaly lately. If you keep calling me out I'll have no choice but to challenge your swf group in custom games cause I feel that's the only thing that might make you see my point
---
It's STABBY GANG my good sir
---
Myers has that big dick energy
---
As I huntress main I can agree the the lullaby radius is what really does it directional and 45 meters it‚Äôs simply too big not saying it needs to be changed but she is a high A to low S
---
Ikr, I've never understood being a toxic swf when the killer is fair. If they camp and tunnel, by all means I'm an asshole cause it's not fun, but when it was a good game actually leaning towards survivors side, you've won, no need to salt the wound for added satisfaction
---
Spectator mains rise up
---
Glad to see his spirit wasnt broken, ego may need a bandaid lol
---
Is racism your first?
---
Tbh a buzzcut looks better on him rather than the plastic tarantula he normally wears on his head.
---
I WANTED TO PLAY RIGHT AFTER MY BREAK BUT I HAD CONNEXION ISSUES THIS DAY SO I WAS WALKING IN WALLS WITHOUT KNOWING AND ALL ACTIONS WERE TAKING LONGER FFFFFFFFF
---
I definitely recommend watching Ussylis on YouTube! He‚Äôs probably one of the best survivor mains out there.
---
The worst thing about this is they charge 400 Auric cells to get that hairstyle on David, when it obviously takes no effort.
---
Yes, but disconnecting while loading is still faster than 5 minutes. It doesn't take long to load up DBD again, nor is getting back to the screen. They could all be in a different match in less than the time required to do all the gens and open the exit gate. And you can't call a farming game a match, because there is no real danger.
---
Yes, but if they weren't looking to farm, this does not excuse them not leaving in the loading screen, harassing the killer, and camping the hatch instead of running out immediately. If they didn't want to farm, Meg would've left immediately, Bill wouldn't have let himself get downed or struggled when I tried to flashlight(which is obviously faster than struggling). Meg never had to take hatch, as we all know the collapse only starts when a escape is opened.
---
Yes, it is a smart idea to do the gens first, but throughout the whole time, the killer just stood there doing practically nothing, and never gave him BBQ tokens. If he wasn't trying to farm, he would've attacked them before they even done a gen.
---
Same kind of people who accuse the killer of facecamping for chasing all three teammates around the one hooked survivor.
---
Nobody cares. I rather take a farmgame than a sweaty ass slugging billy with instasaw. So what
---
Tbf you get more salt from survivors cause killers can just straight up deny someone the ability to play the match. Killer on the other hand can still play the game no matter what survivors do.
---
When a group of survivors purposefully go out of their way to run gen rushing builds and are set on making sure the game ends as soon as possible without thinking about how unfun it is for killers I'd consider it pretty toxic, especially considering how broken gen speeds are even with ruin.
---
Also you don't scare crows which is kinda nice sometimes.
---
I could have something to admire while I'm being basement camp. I love it
---
I feel horrible, but I de-pipped for the main purpose of getting six feet under done faster =\[
---
and the fact that you only get one kill, one chase, two hits and generators are finished fast
---
I really don't think it is a challenge perk. I don't know why people keep saying that. David King already has a challenge perk: WGLF. No bonuses in-game (so you're at a disadvantage) but you get BP rewards post-game. No Mither is not a challenge perk, it awards no BP, it's just a weak amalgamation of Unbreakable+Iron Will with a major drawback that cancels out any usefulness it may have. And there's nothing challenging about it that you can't also accomplish with just not healing yourself. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
By the way, poor David. He literally only has one Perk to help in trials, and it's so bugged it may as well read "Use while running and injured to exhaust yourself for 40 seconds".
---
Oh I do.
---
Have you seen what a joke is?
---
Elephant clown that was supposed to come out ages ago is the MEGANUT cosmetic.
---
It may well be quicker but that doesn‚Äôt answer why they should be the one who have to disconnect for wanting to play seriously.
---
I‚Äôve said the meg should have left and she‚Äôs an idiot for not leaving when you didn‚Äôt but that doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt toxic for deliberately getting her killed, also yeah it‚Äôs quicker to be flashlight saved but he doesn‚Äôt get points for that and there‚Äôs also an achievement for wiggling out.
---
Honestly judging from you original post it sounds like you just got angry because they didn‚Äôt let you get your flashlight saves even though only the killer knew about them.
---
I'm not very good?
---
Baseball bat Doctor I see you are a man of culture as well
---
It has a model done so I bet it'll be next mid chapter
---
I don't think I'll ever get the "finish repairing 4 gens in a single trial". I'll get the basement one easily, even though it may take a few tries because at Rank 1 I know survivors will DC (I'm on console so they aren't getting punished yet). I'm off 2 weeks for Christmas Break so my main thing is to get to tier 70.
---
Why should they?
---
TWENTY EIGHT STAB WOUNDS
---
&gt; play the game how it‚Äôs supposed to be played 
---
They were obviously reffering to the "Survivors rule book for killers"
---
Faiely easy. I only play on weekends and even then I play a lot of other games but I have no problem getting to red ranks on both sides. Even before the rank changes.
---
But I thought all SWF's where complete sweat squads? ;)
---
I don't think that's a racist question. The only issue with it is the spelling errors and if English isn't your first language I wouldn't even care about the mistakes I think it's awesome that anyone speaks two or more languages.
---
Oof. A friend sent me a screenshot recently of a game be played and if you added the ranks of all the survivors together, the number was still lower than the killer.
---
Ranks 3, 3, 3, and 5 vs a rank 15 killer.
---
Needless to say the killer didn‚Äôt get to do much going by the bp gain and the fact that everyone escaped too.
---
Same tbh. I'm survivor rank 4 and I always get paired up with rank 13's. You can be the best player in the game, it doesn't matter if your teammates don't do gens at all. Then you get tunneled because you didn't go down in 5 seconds. Finally you end up dead with a depip and fuck all points because boldness caps out at 8k.
---
I only have about 800 hours in game and I'm already burnt out. Playing DBD actually gives me a headache at this point.
---
I once played with survivors who literally thought I could be banned for camping.
---
Exactly, you get even less if you used an insta down
---
Cos it‚Äôs a wakazashi
---
Gallows are worse. At least the guillotine is relatively painless
---
Got me to 40 when I leveled my clown, maybe I just got lucky I guess.
---
I mean when only the last hooked one is injured and he is targeting injured survivors, that‚Äòs kinda tunneling, isn‚Äòt it?
---
What was funny in my case, was that i play only nurse and huntress (wilh basic perks too) so it was funny when i destroyed them, i mean slugging was necessary, but still im proud of myself to win against full meta perk team vs me with sloppy, thanatophobia and nurse's on 1st lvl
---
Nothing to see here, just the normal freddy lunge.
---
Look, you‚Äôve asked if you were the toxic one and when multiple people have said yes you‚Äôve got defensive.  
---
We could go round doing if‚Äôs buts and maybes all day but you deliberately got one of the other survivors killed, that makes you toxic in 999/1000 scenarios, including this one.
---
Does that make you a toxic person/player? No not necessarily, we all make bad judgment calls.
---
Should just do away with single-trial challenges altogether. Want to make em grindy, then make em grindy. But don't make them RNG nonsense that make people farm, or run wonky ass builds and throw the game trying to do them.
---
It's like they learned nothing from the Pustula event, or any past event for that matter. People just don't play normally when you tie rewards to arbitrary objectives, they'll just take the easiest route to do them (which is usually cheese and/or ruining games for other people).
---
Just stop it.
---
Fuuuuuck I always just went for the unhooker xD
---
Caption is hilarious.
---
Favorite is billy for the most part and least favorite is spirit.
---
I also really like him cause he posts videos of him losing and explains what he did wrong. You see people like Monto and Tru3 almost only posting wins, which is perfectly fine, but I think also posting losses shows that no one's perfect and even the best players can have shitty games.
---
I don't get it. What am I not seeing here?
---
I was playing rank 7 survivor yesterday and only got like rank 17-20
---
Sometimes you can get Brutal Killer just because of that ;)
---
Think it might e been a joke but it is 2019 after all

Callum and Rayla do race swap role play in bed
---
Spirit mori where she mindgames your soul
---
Charge your power which is also entirely useless because survivors can literally 180 it every time and you can;t even use it on loops.
---
The Oni is the worst killer in the game rn.
---
Its cause shes a stoopid old lady with a prosthetic hip
---
Forever freddy not OP lmao sure
---
Nice. I used to hate rank.1 because, even though you get decent teammates, you used to get tons of spirits and now people barely play her anymore and I love rank 1 now.
---
Ok boomer
---
I hate it how people want everything to be tediously easy nowadays...
---
Huntress‚Äô hatchets are broken asf. People know that and yet they play her, why? I‚Äôm genuinely looking for someone to discuss this with me. Discuss, no arguments please &lt;3
---
I speak 4 and English isn‚Äôt the first, what did I spell wrong?
---
Also this Tome we have now is Trapper oriented so most of the challenges has to be done using his perks. So if he wants to farm it's okay to assume he wants to get a certain challenge done.
---
Who are callum and rayla and what on earth are you talking about
---
Miss two ruin skill checks? Walk away in shame.
---
Everything was spelled correctly you were just missing a few words and added an extra word. That's amazing you speak 4 languages!

To be fair, if even the quietest person in the world gothit with a hatchet in the ass, they'd probably scream too lol

Oh shit
---
Please pm me if you do others. These are helpful.
---
All the better to not do gens, when those survivors get out of the entity's realm, it will make them rich if they get enough of it
---
Well thank you :) 
---
I did have haunted grounds, got 1 instant down with that, none of the others though
---
How are they broken? If ur talking about the hitboxes they sometimes are too big sometimes go trough survivors and I think that needs to change.
---
Wheres huntress
---
You're welcome.
---
Cool you got 1 down from it, I love killing people for "Cleansing the Ruin".
---
Thats the first time I'm drawing with color and most of the time don't really know what to do... It still kinda works out though :D probably won't be finishing it this year
---
Ever played against Forever Freddy? That's boring.
---
Fix one of the problems I described and the game will be more skill-based and fair.
---
*laughs in Oni that can track everyone by blood basically*. I hate Calm Spirit users, use it and bet you getting the full shaft from me, straight goin in for the kill
---
Favourite: Myers
---
Least favourite: Huntress
---
Running it with Stake Out instead makes it mindlessly easy, unless you get a stealth killer. No injury necessary, and the enhanced skill checks count even if they‚Äôre only good.

So I have about 1300 hours on PC and played on Playstation for like 10 hours when I visited a friend. Like rank already doesn't really matter on PC, but Playstation that's a whole new level of ppl not knowing what they're supposed to do. No offense to anyone who actually knows how to play the game, but 90 % of red ranks on pc are not even close to playing optimal and on playstation I saw things I'd like to forget.  I always thought it was a meme tbh. So your argument is a bit invalid, imo. And even if it was valid, matchmaking has been so fucked since rank reset, because their new system has been implemented that poorly. It seems to think that red rank survivors are purple ranks and get matched with 5 - 10, only had 3 or 4 matches out of thirty where I got a red rank killer. And as a killer it's kinda the same, only a little bit more consistent, out of 50 matches around 10 full red ranks and one white rank, 50 % of them played at rank 1. Like two things this subreddit has to start understand or the ppl that play this game is that for one they shouldn't care about ranks, because the competitve system sucks and that BHVR has a very good Art team, but their balancing is let's say on par with LoL. Please just have fun playing this game, try new builds, because if not you will get sucked into that bubble of toxicity that this community has, because there is so much that keeps this game from being competitive and it's not worth your nerves to really care about it. And yes I know what I said might sound toxic, but I realized that and stopped caring after I realized all of this and just started playing for fun and yes it's more fun to win, but it's not fun to be tilted about an facecamper and then go tilted into the next match get tunneld. Just do your best, struggle as long as you can, run the killer as long as you can and be fine with it, that's just my opinon. If you need an example go watch Zubat or Monto they've stopped caring about made up rules, tryharding etc. They still get to rank one, because they're good, but not because they need or want to. And I could rant about BHVR for a good 4 pages, but there is nothing to gain from that.

Try Ace and Jeff without iron will, or Kate and Jane, and tell me they're just skins.

Okay? Try Ace without Ace In The Hole, Jeff without Breakdown, Kate without Boil Over, or Jane without Solidarity. Are they still viable? The comment isn't about perks, it's about specific perks tied to which character they're from. Iron Will is a Jake perk. But you can use Iron Will on any character, point in case that you didn't even mention Jake using Iron Will as your example.
---
Partially.
---
Only if you want their prestige skins, otherwise, is not worth it at all.
---
Yeah, I haven't used ruin in 3 resets so I love comboing it with other hexes when I use them.
---
This looks awesome, holy shit.
---
Ive been playing jake for that exact reason
---
Do you have to keep it until rank reset for the achievement?
---
fam I don't even have ruin unlocked so I just hope they break my hexes xD 
---
i'm kinda new
---
F
---
I only hit rank 4 on both sides and then gi back to purple
---
"I think we did a pretty good job so far."
---
What bug is that I‚Äôve been playing spirit and haven‚Äôt really noticed anything odd ?
---
Only prestige once you have all the teachables I'd say. The bonus to rarity barely exists til about P3, when it starts to be a bit noticable
---
Sorry, if you might feel offended that I didn't give examples about killers. So here is one, don't get tilted about a four man swf that is flashlight clicking and gen rushing, imo. After losing to them leave the chat and go on with your day. Try to get so good that you'll beat them next time and if you really want to make them mad, do it by playing with their rules. Don't use noed, two hook everyone anmd then kill 'em obiously, don't use op add ons, what will they cry about in end game chat? That your killers is op, when you M1'd them with Billy? When you play Pig without Ruin? Or Huntress? That's how I found fun playing Killer, I wanted to get so good that I would be able to beat 4 man swf's with toolboxes, ds, adrenaline etc. And if that's not how you can enjoy it, honestly dodge them, because it's not worth your time.

Don't forget Sprint Bursting for no reason.

Okay survivor/killer main
---
And now I have a new wallpaper
---
Are trying to get impossible skill checks but don‚Äôt have the perks ?
---
This is a bug that happens seemingly a lot more often than it should. I'm assuming it triggers when you hit a lagspike while a speed boost activates (in this case, the speed boost from being injured), causing the effect timer on it to become much longer than it should or possibly infinite.
---
I got my tier 3 blind challenges just last night.
---
Got the 4 blinds by running up to the killer at the start and crouching and clicking my flashlight. He stood there for around 10 seconds and let me go afterwards.
---
Got the flashlight save by following the killer the entire match until he got tired and didn't pay attention to me. He let me and the 2nd last survivor farm and escape.
---
That‚Äôs beautiful!
---
Billy in S, Freddy in SS, Bubba and Clown C, Wraith B, Huntress A and I‚Äòd agree.
---
Spirit is not fun to play if you have little to no experience with her. Her power is suprisingly punishing to mess up with if you don't have add-ons.
---
As soon as he stopped teabagging i knew what was going lol.
---
And the only reason the tome exist is because of the battlepass.
---
I got something like that for ace when I opened his bloodweb a long time ago
---
Thank you, I don‚Äòt really care for cosmetics and higher addon rarities, so I‚Äòll probably pass.
---
Her lunge is not bugged.. it was nerfed to be shorter sounds are bugged for every killer not just spirit
---
*Laugs in freddy*
---
Dude congrats but this is not the kind of thing to put under the News flair
---
They don‚Äôt
---
The main killer I use is Spirit, but I already have very good teachable like BBQ on her.
---
When i fail a skillcheck i start nerviously and shamefully tbaging in circles crying in pain and fear while everybody is watching me acting as a living failure
---
"Saying goodbye to three generators"
---
Well in my teams a nea will just stay crouched next to my hook, watching me getting facecamped. A claudette will be searching for all the boxes and cleansing dull totems and a meg will go on a 3 minute expedition for ruin while walking because of sprint burst.
---
Thank you, skins aren‚Äòt that interesting to me, but a friend has been pushing me how great it was to prestige.
---
Because abusing bugs like this is against the rules?
---
So you get fucked by BT consistently. Good job.
---
Recently infectious fright has been pretty common especially on stronger killers (nurse, Billy etc.) And since calm spirit hard counters that perk it's not a bad choice imo
---
Do you mean all teachables for the character or all I own?
---
Just the ones you want for now.
---
If it is a critical gen, like the last one, just dont scratch man.
---
That's dandy and all but my point is I think the perk as a whole is a missed opportunity and survivors have no means to combat exhaustion so I thought why not tie the two.
---
Semi-counters Iron Maiden too though nobody runs that.
---
My group I play with, this happens to us so much *laughs* We either nail it and do pretty well, or we fuck up so monumentally bad that it's hilarious.
---
Yes,they do
---
Poor hag and demogorgon got left out for this challenge üò≠
---
No, BHVR did confirm her lunge was bugged. Same for Wraith. I know Spirit got a post-phase speed nerf but this is entirely different
---
The chain shock is an ultra rare add-on, iri Queen.
---
He's losing stances, gaining a complete TR shock on a 60sec cool down, and his Add-ons are getting a rework.
---
You mean the killer with this very same thing got nerfed just this last patch?
---

Any form of damaging attack removes PWYF tokens. The only thing that gets around this is Plague's regular vomit.
---
Cries in hillbilly
---
I miss my squad :(
---
Ever since I let a survivor go and repeatedly just stood still so they could break free then hatch. and they called me bad and said learn to play with his swf spamming me and posting on my profile. Ever since then I don't let anyone escape
---
For real this is not good advice. Imagine losing out on a free hit or down because you got greedy.
---
Yeah, but you realize that i also wont lose any stacks of STBFL. So why PWYF with Frenzy just doesnt make sense to me. I mean Chainsaws trigger Sloppy aswell but Legion doesnt so its not really an attack. Same for Thanato on Plagues damaging Vomit. But legion doesnt count as a regular hit cause they literally removed that.
---
I've completed it and all the tomes
---
Fucking tapp lmao
---
No. All killers have the same lunge, it‚Äôs just Freddy‚Äôs claws are so short that his hit box just goes a bit further than it looks like it does
---
With PWYF you lose it from doing any offensive action - i.e any action that directly injures survivors. 
---
While effects like Sloppy &amp; STBL only apply with basic attack hits. 
---
You still gain Thanataphobia stacks on Legion. Since Thanta gains stacks through injured survivors that remains untouched with the nerf of on hit effects.
---
If the devs altered PWYF to only lose stacks on basic attacks then it would become broken since the effects of PWYF is substantially stronger than STBFL hence there needs to be an easier way to lose stacks.
---
I myself have it done without completing all the challenges. I finished the first 2 and all but one challenge on the 3rd level and was almost done there from playing the game. However there was an error where I had an 8 level boost to start but pretty sure I still would have done it. But I played nearly every day at least for a couple hours. It does take a long time to finish but that‚Äôs why they give you all the cells back, cause if you can complete it you basically can get the next pass for free.
---
This is me but when I blow up the gen.

Dude every online service tracks your data, your internet providers themselves monitor everything you do, AT&amp;T can look into how many times you visited porn sites in the last week if they wanted to they just don't 'casue they don't care...

If you got nothing to hide, you got nothing to fear... Anonymity doesn't exists on the internet, they will find you if they want to!
---
Thing that separates good survivor from a bad one is that good survivor can connect tiles together and spend much more time on a loop
---
Same lunge as other killers. His weapon is just tiny so his hotbox goes past where it looks like it should
---
A second objective like parts hunting to fix the gens would clear that up, maybe they could be in them fancy chests the entity left when he moved to the basement, along with the usual 1 item thats in em of course, killer can't see em so its a winwin, plus who doesn't like free items?
---
Not sure why the downvotes. Spot on. Blendettes same story. Except they will just run to hook instead of staying on gens to pressure a killer.
---
Accurate
---
I flinched when I read the line "punish them for not farming". Farming is not mandatory by any means, and you NEED to respect that not everyone wants to farms, and that you have no right to "punish" them for doing gens. Shame on you.

After a month of not playing I decided to hop into a game as a survivor a couple days ago. after the first game I get a message from another survivor calling me shit. I fucking hate this community I mean wtf. Fun game, shit community.
---
uh, like 4/10. tenacity is pretty situational and only really worthwhile when paired with other perks and even then you‚Äôre not guaranteed any use out of it. poised is okay, neither good nor bad. resilience is a GREAT perk though, but usually i would put on spine chill instead. bond is a much better version of empathy imo, or even aftercare
---
these are just my opinions, it‚Äôs a pretty average build

Twenty-five stab wounds!

Same for me. I was deeply moved and saddened to see his update on YouTube today.

Why are the stats junk?  They just flat dumped the raw numbers of 3 months worth of games.  Killers win the vast majority of the time.  This lines up from what I see on streams as well as my own experience.  But it doesn't fit the delusional narrative that playing killer is hard mode so they're junk stats?
---
EVERY TIME I'M GOING FOR THE 4 SACRIFICE BASEMENT CHALLENGE SOMEONE FUCKING DC'S. I'M TRAPPER, I RUN AGITATION AND IRON, BUT HOW CAN I DO IT WHEN EVERY SECOND MATCH IS SURVIVORS 10 RANKS ABOVE ME OR INSTANT DC?

If I improved then killer would just be even more op.  If you just look at the raw numbers, at high ranks the killer has even more of an advantage, not less.
---
If you can convince everyone too bring coins it's super easy üòÇ
---
I mean who knows if that's all we're getting
---
I don't play in high rank but I might as well me.  Killers are even MORE likely to 4k there, not less.
---
thank you handsome badger, the legion had discordance noed and barbeque and some other perk. he was rank 4, we were rank 6/7. youre the first one that empathizes with me, doesnt shittalk me because i clicked my flashlight. thank you. :)
---
Also Fungoose! Not many people seem to know about him, but he's in my opinion the best player I've been able to find for both killer and survivor. He knows a lot about the game and explains why he's making the choices he makes as he does them.
---
But all survivors are not created equal. Therefore they aren't just "skins." Skins in video games only effect the visual they dont effect gameplay. The voice of different survivors affects gameplay. Therefore they aren't just different skins of each other.
---
Why is the flair news??
---
That flair is to important news
---
Hiting rank 1 happens every fucking day
---
Who runs devour hope and a mori
---
I hope not
---
There is no killer ability that can be combined with on-hit effects like devour, noed, sloppy etc. it worked before that legion could gain stacks with stbfl but last patch it got removed, now there is no on-hit effect with the ability.
---
I‚Äôm assuming you combo SC and resilience for the extra vault boosts, but does SC really give you a speed boost even though it doesn‚Äôt state it in its description? I haven‚Äôt been able to find any confirmation on that
---
True
---
New skin when

If the survivor always stays at the pallet then you'll always be forced to break safe pallets I personally prefer them prematurely running away over staying at the loop

Damn this looks very good.

PALLET GRABS DON'T WORK FOR THE ARCHIVES CHALLENGES

Playing in red ranks you gonna match against a lot of good Hillbillies and Nurses with Infectious Fright, so having Calm Spirit can win a game for you. I run it in my useless but fun "flashlight save" build: Calm Spirit/Iron Will/Empathy/Dead Hard
---
I don‚Äôt get this. None of these perks work with one another. Each one is separate and the while it may be useful for extremely specific moments, I don‚Äôt see how this is designed to work. Maybe knocking off empathy for iron will, given how you‚Äôre avoiding the killer when injured...

It‚Äôs infuriating both as a survivor on a hook and as a killer when I see a random teammate being chased run up and unhook. You‚Äôre being chased. The killer is not camping, he‚Äôs actively hunting you. You are not the person to be doing the saving. Some do it just to get the killer off them, which is inexcusable.
---
While I agree with most of your statement I think you underestimate Empathy.
---
The very difference between Bond and Empathy is that Bond more rounded in terms of granting information as well as survivabillity, as Bond's aura reading is shorter, but obviously also much more consistent. Empathy on the other hand, can potentially succeed the value of Bond with a factor that depends on the amount of pressure that Killers can actually apply. Or are simply made to pressure by injuring Survivors (Plague, Legion, Wraith). Empathy will always tell you who and especially where someone is being chased. Abusing the memory game a bit, Empathy also allows you to evade dead zones where there aint any useable pallets anymore.
---
Bond is all about being well-rounded and consistent but have a rather short range. Empathy gives literally global vision on Survivors, but also indirectly on the Killer, making not just stealthing easier as you're capable to predict the direction of the Killers approach but also helps you in chases are you, as already mentioned, have an easier time to evade chases.

HOW IS IT THAT I WORKED HARD TO ACTUALLY SACRIFICE 3 SURVIVORS BUT ONLY GET BRUTAL KILLER?!
---
it's just stupid that killer perks like noed, ruin etc. and survivor perks like ds and adrenaline are even in this game so everyone can just say: "yes we need to take "\_\_\_\_\_\_" because we were expecting them to have "\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" but yeah, we expect guys to camp and tunnel so we take borrowed time, if they dont do, well sorry but there is no agreement just expectations that both parties use certain perks. If we were to say nobody uses noed, I'd yeet adrenaline out of my perks to have an even game same with ruin and prove thyself. But sadly there is no such thing. Noed is even stronger than every other survivor perk sure its a totem perk but if the killer is at least decent there will be no time to do gens, totems, saves and healing. The role of the killer is strong enough to apply enough pressure to assure at least one of the objectives is not being worked on.
---
Not legion gang, its stabby gang
---
Background: I bring my friend (u/A10WB) into a red rank killer lobby and this rank 3 oni face camps him for finishing a generator
---
This doesn‚Äôt even shock me anymore. Although what does shock me is when I get a positive message from a killer. Now that... that‚Äôs golden.
---
You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain

I would try and help but my cement for a brain would just say: brown rope, gold medal, blue skin, blood red üëå
---
Ppl be makin up their own rules... Smh
---
i did run empathy when i wasn‚Äôt so experienced with survivor and the information helped a lot, and i agree with what you‚Äôre saying. but i just think bond/aftercare helps co-ordinate a bit better. i would prefer to know whether or not it‚Äôs worth going for a save or if i can keep working on a gen, find a heal, etc.
---
Wheres the middle one from?
---
i honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to learn how to play the game/how to loop without an exhaustion perk on, the same way with self care too

---
Nope
---
Darn time for some spirit/ghost face
---
Steve already has that perk it pauses the struggle phase for like 30 seconds if its struggle phase and a survivor is within like 16 meters of you.
---
So pretty much same thing for a killer. Would only work last phase = EGC, would be based off survivors in its proximity. And I never stated it "wasn't a legit strategy" but at EGC camping your guy on the hook is one too. Perks should be (imho) not just improving your characters speed and abilities but also for those specific scenarios where they shine.
---
Blood Warden sucks to get caught in but its a legit strategy. Tunneling is a legit strategy. Camping is too. Pretty much anything that won't get you banned is because anything you do that the devs are ok with becomes legitimate by default.

"We shouldn't implement a system to penalize people who disconnect prematurely (which can lead to the killer losing on deserved kills to trigger the hatch opening) because there are also other problems."

I also play on PS4. I DC for multiple reasons. Toxic survivors as a killer is definitely one of them.

I find after killer matches I get super anxious, even during game sometimes my heart is racing a lot. Its stressful and just unfun to go against the toxic survive with friends.

I play both killer and survivor, I DC if a killer is just going to face camp me, I DC if I get tunneled off the hook almost every single game.
---
I don't know what kind of experience PC players get but on PS4 this game is the worst because there is no post game chat and majority of the people have messages turned off, me included and friend requests because people started sending their hate through that when I would play killer.
---
So if someone has a bad toxic round one game, they take it into the next game.
---
I had a killer want to farm me and my SWF group, but then told us he killed us all because one of us had a pride flag for a picture on PSN "and he dont do that gay shit", he then started being extremely homophobic towards them.
---
So sometimes a DC is just needed when you've had enough bad rounds and just seem to get more of them.
---
Lol it's sad. A quote from Disco Elysium about "evil apes duking it out on the giant ball" really fits here.

So make a good perk totally shit. Nice
---
you're welcome c:
---
&gt;!Yes, I made an icon pack and it's all perk icons randomly swapped to make it all cursed.!&lt;
---
&gt;!The real build is (left to right) Fixated, Sprint Burst, Iron Will, Inner Strength!&lt;
---
Why would you be using sprint burst with balanced landing in the first place one and it doesn‚Äôt help you learn to loop to not have one at all two and three nobody relies on exhaustion perks.. they literally are one of the core mechanics of survivor you don‚Äôt NEED one but there‚Äôs no reason not to have one when it helps you survive....  just as looping is a core mechanic that helps you survive you need both to survive and they don‚Äôt even correspond to each other as you said
---
Argument or substance goes to his reasoning on why the ban or suspension is stupid and what the definition of the word means lol.
---
Steve‚Äôs perk activates when a survivor is close by, not the Killer. It‚Äôs not an anti-camping perk and is in no way similar to a Killer perk that regresses exit gate progression if a survivor is near it.
---
I‚Äôm confused. What do you mean, ‚Äúthis would only work last phase=EGC?‚Äù The entire point of a perk like the one mentioned would be to punish survivors for not immediately opening exit gates and abandoning the other survivors. This is completely against the goals of a survivor, since we get extra BP for making last-minute saves.
---
It‚Äôs literally devour hope for generators go somewhere with that shit attitude lmao
---
Imagine using insidious and just waiting in the basement. This post is made by literally any other killer gang

My gosh dude now your just trying to fight. I am autistic if you are

r/woosh ?

All un leds than 25 seconds
---
Got it, so you wouldn't say he's unviable despite the clear downsides of his power, cus I intend to pick him up.
---
Lord forgive for what i am about to do..
---
Your literally actively punished for using his power. Deep wounds are pointless specially as the timer dosent go down if the survivor is running which makes it no better than basic attacks. The stun once frenzy ends is complete BS especially as it gets longer the more survivors you hit (I think) and a mere 8 second mend makes it pathetically easy to recover from a frenzy hit.
---
Perks ain‚Äôt scummy homie
---
What's a good key to bind stuggle?
---
Just For Some More info I was playing with my rank 4 friend and the killer was rank 3
---
Uh how dare you even use a pallet sir
---
Yes but look, if the killer is reliable on add ons, its a bad killer like wraith. I love playing with wraith and legion but they are weak. U can use thanato with legion so they will heal and with frenzy it will be easier to keep pressure
---
Thank you sir for explaining the joke.
---
Ain't nobody got time for dat!
---
I think it was after every DC you get an increased timer..
---
You're totally right, his reasoning against the ban had a lot more substance than your comment did. The definition of what word?
---
Not entirely it would just regress the gate when a survivor was within a certain distance not opening it. If you ran up and opened it the perk would have no effect. If you 99% it then run off for a save when you get back its at like 50%. 
---
EGC with multiple survivors up is hard for a killer to manage that's why we camp a hook during it so often. Its supposed to be hard on survivors as well.
---
i'm tired so i misunderstood the icons for a moment and thought they killed you somehow. that would've been some serious bullying
---
Why the fuck is everyone thirsty for Jeff i didn't know that was a thing
---
I have not once Heard of any if this but i approve
---
I've seen a mix of everything,I just chose q because it's not binded to anything. space button is really bad though.
---
Right, but if your DCs are like 30 minutes apart, they won't pile up on eachother right? I thought the timer only increases when you DC multiple times in a row, but I might be wrong.
---
he was running both ultra rares so it was quite interesting
---
that‚Äôs not what i meant at all... i gave them as examples of how you might end up not having one in a chase. bro i‚Äôm not gonna argue with you about it you have your opinion and i have mine leave it at that please
---
Just look at those pixels.
---
I only need windows and I can easily use LOS to break chase and still be called toxic
---
I like the ideas! Would be fun for some different game plays.
---
Who knows. People do crazy things.
---
Right because you actually compared having an exhaustion perk to having self care....

i used it as comparison because not running it also teaches you to be better at an aspect of the game that you might not be so good at without?? you said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need one but there‚Äôs no reason not to have one when it helps you survive‚Äù  couldn‚Äôt the same be said about self care? there‚Äôs plenty of upsides to that as well. 
---
as i said it‚Äôs a difference in opinion and i‚Äôm not sure why me saying it‚Äôs better to not rely on exhaustion perks when they can be unreliable (example: dead hard sometimes doesn‚Äôt even void the hit and is often bugged, some maps have no or very little balanced landing spots) is such a problem

Favorite are Huntress, Pig, Spirit, Legion, Clown, Nurse

Least favorite are Wraith, Shape and Ghost Face

1st DC: 60 Seconds

2nd D: 5 Minutes

3rd DC: 15 Minutes

5th DC: 1 Hour

6th DC: 6 Hours

That's how far they tested before stopping.

i don't see anyone say flashlights are toxic. its flashlight clicking that is

I got this on my first try (didn‚Äôt have the challenge selected though üòÇ) with a good toolbox, prove thyself, bond&amp;openhanded so I could watch people work on gens and come over when it was almost finished. Worked the second time too.
---
Did you not watch the dev stream like 2 days ago? It‚Äôs still bugged
---
It says ‚Äúany offensive action‚Äù it is an offensive action. SBFL says basic attacks.
---
Hey remember when the devs said that you could no longer matchmake with people outside 6 levels of your rank? Yeah, what the fuck happened to that? I‚Äôve been placed against gray rank killers as a red rank more and more recently.

this. they teabag at safe pallets to force you to break it rigjt away wasting your time

yea, survivors do have pretty OP perk combos.

On one hand I'm amused by starting an accidental support movement.

I don‚Äôt know why but for me, it seems like Iri Head is the easiest ultra rare to pop up out of any killer, even though it‚Äôs one of the most broken. Most pink add ons only pop up every couple of bloodwebs, maybe every three. But for Huntress, it‚Äôs on 70% of my bloodwebs and mine is only level 40
---
heaven
---
Im on xbox and ive played against some very good nurses.
---
A Gag for the Hag? Shes underage sir.
---
The color is the rarity of appearing in the bloodweb. So even though two perks might both be tier III, they would have different chances of spawning in the bloodweb
---
So what‚Äôs his M2 now?
---
I had to ignore a boop for the archives and it crushed me.
---
That really does sum it up really well
---
Im on xbox and I only died to a Nurse because of very unfortunate Rancor timing, and that was her only kill. She's just optimized so bad it ain't worth it
---
That's awesome!
---
[yawn](https://www.reddit.com/r/DBDGoneGay/comments/eb0gkj/kitten_dwight_for_upleazeno/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
That could work, but my goal with it is to have everyone sick by that point so they'd be 1 shot regardless. I can see how that'd work with any other killer though.
---
If the nurse was running rancor she was bad...
---
It's also funny when it's the crows.
---
What about "Hag with a bag"? :3
---
Took me about a year of gameplay to consider my self a good looper, watch streamers, it actually helps a lot
---
Nah man. Iridescent king from doctor can pop twice or 3 times per bloodweb after lv40
---
Not really no. She hasn‚Äôt been relevant for a while.
---
My huntress would disagree /s. Nurse is miserable to play as because survivors are toxic af but thats a different story. I enjoy practicing my nurse and i can definitely see improvement each game. I only get discouraged when i miss a blink attack only to be teabagged or bullied because i ‚Äúdare to learn a new killer at rank 1‚Äù.
---
This is the way
---
My friend makes the same complaint. I agree, but at the same time, I think the perk is better used for saves than mid chase. I‚Äôm fine with a buff, it could make some cool plays.
---
Being able to use it in a chase would make it better than dead hard. A 2 second charge would have to be tested, but that sounds too strong, because that would require such a short reaction time to even have a chance to counter.
---
Thanks man, yeah I see how bad it is damn
---
So what? I don't get it how is that relevant
---
So your point is that survivors used to be super OP, and now they still are bc you got super unlucky?
---
How about this, "Even Today, at the red ranks, Killers are too powerful. At these ranks, survivors often lose not because of any failure on their part, but because of bad game design.
---
If you go against a GF with recharge addons on hawkins, you have no idea where he could be, its almost impossible.
---
Not to mention perks like Ruin, Thana, Pop, and corrupt slow gens down to a halt, buying so much time for any killer to easily take the win."
---
If you are playing any top tier killer (Like you should be since you didnt mention how many shit killers there are, so im assuming you main someone who is competent in high ranks.) Then you are on fair playing grounds.
---
Somtimes you get unlucky, its bound to happen when RNG is such a big factor in this game, but sometimes you GET lucky. somtimes you are given a huge dead zone next to shack so it makes the loop almost worthless, or you get no pallet spawns, or a map that is killer sided ect.
---
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one
---
Im a rank 11 being put up against red ranks and usually rank 6s

But did he die?

You‚Äôre gonna get gen rushed either way most of the time.

Anal Sodomy at Medium Rate

For sure, but Ruin still helps slow the game-... uh... you know.

What point? It's perfectly on point. Is a challenge perk and make the game challenging with a small upside
---
Thats it
---
Never in my life have I been offended by something I 100% agree with
---
You like to suffer, don't you?
---
fair point
---
I see it like I see Noed, it‚Äôs an easy fix to a somewhat hard problem that you have to work for. I run dying light and thana instead because it also slows down other progression and I don‚Äôt like feeling like one of my perks can be taken out 4 seconds into the game.
---
It‚Äôs all just opinion but I think a lot of the time killers hurt themselves more using ruin then not; when I play survivor it never seems to be that much of an issue so I don‚Äôt like to run it as killer in that sense also.
---
The changed the way it works, I doesnt go down if they're running now. It isnt tied to tr
---
I rarely mess up ruin skill checks. I‚Äôm speaking on behalf of the all players who cant hit them consistently and feels pressured into running away because of some teammate who keeps bm‚Äôing near the fucking gen like an idiot because they messed up once. It happens way too often.
---
I don't doubt their potential to be good killers, but they are just way too unreliable on console. It's a shame.
---
I think the issue is he committed to finishing as the killer approached instead of running. survivors do that all the time and I don't see how it's an issue. take a hit and finish the gen rather than letting it regress.
---
I love legion and I will suffer every minute just to her #Stabbygang
---
I would be fine with getting more bp by using that
---
Doesn't need more side effects tho
---
i thought so! i felt so bad, the guy bled out completely and i couldnt find him at all lol. that makes more sense though, i was so confused. thank you! :)
---
Ash KINDA makes sense. He's a demon hunter with experience fighting monsters like the ones in the Entity's realm. But, well... he was stripped of all his weapons. 
---
Lara doesn't make any sense. She's an overglorified archeologist.
---
And it could be MORE than that is what I'm saying. 
---
I don't know what part of this is at all confusing for you.
---
I had it happen to me yesterday and I swear I got 2k BP for escaping. I could be wrong.
---
yeah i thought it didnt, i was just really confused. he bled out and i felt so bad lol. thank you!
---
*This is the way*
---
Yeah the kind awards don't help it either, guess I have to lmao
---
Understood. I was wondering if I had missed something and didn‚Äôt see it.
---
haha xD
---
Right. Like gen speed and frustration from killers due to ridiculously small FoV and no time
---
Yep. Still a long way to go before it is in a good spot
---
I feel this on so many levels.
---
I thought I was the only one who was experiencing this
---
Wow, that's really amazing! Keep up the good work!
---
I agree strongly with this. Lore wise it wouldn‚Äôt make much sense, and what killer would she come with? 
---
I guess it might be a biased opinion but I don‚Äôt like survivors that don‚Äôt come with killers.
---
I could care less if the last survivor gets the hatch. If I kill at least 3 I consider it a win.
---
Yep, and because of that its not a reward.
---
Rewards are defined as gifts given for service/effort/achievements.

Gifts are defined as things given with out payment.

Now you know why I stopped playing the damn game

‚ÄúEntitlement is strong with this one‚Äù implies yes

Is there any other point to this post other than "survivors are toxic"?
---
He‚Äôs a little thinner than he is in game but aside from that holy shit dude you have a LOT of skill
---
Bam bams stick is gone
---
New hatch is great and means the game ends promptly rather than it lasting forever while someone hides. Youve won with a 3k and frankly just play out the endgame but if you care so much then slug for the 4k.
---
Xbox or ps4
---
the 2 grabs is super easy too, just face a hex ruin and eventually someone comes to work on it, after a few seconds grab them
---
What pencils did you use? Also love the drawing!!
---
PS4.
---
Garbage matchmaking. I'm constantly playing against purple ranks when as a killer I'm in green or even yellow ranks.
---
1. Ghostface isn't that strong. Run Spine Chill and he''l never get the drop on you. After that, he can be easily looped.
---
2. Ruin is usually out of the match within a minute, Thanat adds a max of 13s to a gen, Pop only works if the Killer is getting frequent hooks and Corrupt is literally terrible.
---
3. Certain Killers lack red-rank viability *precisely because* of the 3 Big Problems*. You shouldn't be limited to a handful of Killers.
---
4. More often than not, maps are heavily Survivor-sided.
---
Cause its useless against injured survivors.
---
I never dc. Unless, the game is soooo fckn laggy I struggle to even exist. I think if you dc you should ACTUALLY lose something.
---
I feel like you should lose bp. Like 50k. 
---
Id say lose rank, but honestly, who cares? 
---
People need to actually be punished. The bp thing is a place holder. Idk what people can really even lose in this game besides dignity.
---
Yeah it always was but I wouldnt know how to improve it honestly 
---
maybe get back the old they need to do at least 1 or 2 gens but I dont know how that would work out for survivor teams where people just refuse to do anything
---
i mean, i have never lost a game as he, and he is so fun so yea, buy him!
---
Exhaustion perks require skill to use optimally, they add a layer to the chaseplay rather than take away from it. But sure, I go without Exhaustion perks (or perks altogether) at times too, doesn't mean they're OP or otherwise undesirable. On the killer side there's plenty of perks that aid in chaseplay as well, despite it being completely possible to outplay survivors in chases without them. And they are arguably even more directly a "crutch", since only few of them offer the proactive utility that Exhaustion perks do, most of them just passively increasing your chase stats.
---
Probably because you complain about everything.
---
I've pulled other survivors up in post game chats for toxic crap.
---
It's really unnecessary and spoils the game as their toxicity causes killers to just think fuck it and go toxic themselves.
---
not the best after the nerfs, but still usable
---
He isn't obligated to go easy on them. It is not his fault they DC'd. He may just want to end the game quickly as possible.
---
camp the hatch ? that doesnt work anymore since they changed it mate. you cant grab them when they jump in anymore and the killer can close it . just sucks that it appears when you kill 3 survivors even though they didnt do a single ge, thats what im sayin
---
I didn't even argue. Its annoying but thats how it is sadly.
---
"I pLaY bOtH SiDeS"
---
When it‚Äôs blocked in your country. :(
---
1. You don‚Äôt need a 4K to win as killer
---
2. Closing the hatch on most maps fucks over the survivors because of placement of doors. (Besides indoor maps)
---
3. Hatch/keys and Moris are bad we get it.
---
4. Stop feeling you have to sweat for a 4K just to have fun in DBD.
---
Me and my friends love playing like this lmao

Only give hatch if the survivor deserves it

They are not gonna do it. They already commented on this before and to them it is a viable strat

Face camping isn't reportable, and for good reason. It's a strategy. A terrible strategy, but it is a strategy. You died, but the rest of your team got out. That in itself is the punishment for face camping.
---
Sensitize people, telling them there are bigger man survivors out there who don't tbag and  
---
feel like the game is already enough in our favor to atleast respect the killer players, ESPECIALLY if you don't play killer yourself... and there are many of them who don't.
---
If the killer finds the hatch first it‚Äôs almost a definite win for them at least 95% of the time.
---
And I fully understand why. I'm sorry you did.
---
I didn't even hear the totem be crushed because the chase music started at the same time.
---
They just made a new game lmao
---
Listen for the noise and always be healed. Run from mindgames
---
Its fine where it is, you just need to use it at the right time like all other exhaustion perks, it also helps to run quick and quiet.
---
The people who t bag dont care, your saying this to thin air.
---
Its strange, but i could actually see this being a really nice piece "unfinished". The composition at its current state looks really great, which is why I think you had the impulse to take a picture and show it off. Art is strange like that sometimes, there are no rules to what looks beautiful, but even with a ton of negative space it's really working. I mean, it may look even better finished, im absolutely not trying to tell you how to do your work, just had to comment that I really love it at this stage.
---
If only I could draw like that. Nice drawing my guy keep it up!

In that case would the ‚Äúbad man‚Äù not be Spencer, the asylum warden she killed when she became the nurse?

-Revive from dying.
---
-Revive from injured.
---
-Revive to full after unhook.
---
-Sprint burst.
---
-Ignores Exhaustion.
---
-If killer sets you down as the last gen pops, you get set down into injured.
---
Not only all this, but you can combine it with borrowed, ds, deliverance, dead hard, etc.
---
Can also be used by 4 people.
---
This is too much for 1 perk.
---
Whoever downvoted me thinks im attacking survivors but im not. I just want the perk abit more up to date.
---
bad man was patient
---
his true name unknown
---
Survivors cry when they get tunneled, I'm one of those who play both so I've done it, but killers truly get shafted worse than survivors.
---
I have gotten pretty good pops with it, but only one of them was this close, and I didn't have Shadowplay running so I couldn't clip it.
---
My favorite time with the perk is when I hooked a Dwight in the basement, placed my Hag trap in the middle of the shack, and left, got into a chase hit someone, a trap went off TP to it, swing, down, then another trap went off, but I couldn't get the instant hit because I just swung, so I tp back to the shack as soon as I can, and hit the savior, then chased Dwight and downed him. Everyone was dead in 60 seconds.
---
Then I de-Pipped.

Hi, I've got like...300 hours on just Myers.  I've reached rank 1 with him (Please, no eye contact) and feel like I can give some advice on how to play him. I'm not THE AUTHORITY or anything, but I'm better at him than most.  
---
First of all, your perks aren't bad.  My preferred load-out is Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury, and BBQ.  I used to run M&amp;A but the value of it is highly diminished once you tier up once, so it's a very early game perk that doesn't really benefit you after the first couple of minutes.  
---
Enduring + Spirit fury helps counter one of the greatest weaknesses of Myers- looping.  Ultimately, he is an M1 killer with the ability to potentially snowball the  game inside one T3.  However, if you aren't at T3, you're just running around hoping they mess up.  So just swing through, eat pallets like they are going out of style, and Spirit fury their smug faces into the Entity's embrace.  
---
 Basic killer rules apply here- use moon walking, fake them out, run the loops the right way to prevent them getting to more pallets/force them into unsafe areas, etc.  There are a lot of videos, the one I am thinking of is by ScottJund (DamnNoHTML) who goes over this in greater detail and they are worth watching.    
---
Ruin buys you time (allegedly) and BBQ is for tracking and points.  Addons can be whatever you want but Memorial Page and Rabbit are my go to for an easy game as Myers.    
---
If you're trying to get Myers achievements specifically they are all sorta awkward.  You really need to lean into his T3.  "99%ing" is when you stalk in T2 to 99%, just shy of hitting T3.  Play normally, get close to a survivor and pop it, downing them instantly.    
---
If you are a REAL brave b o i, you can swap out ruin for Infectious Fright.  T3 Downs with reveals of who is nearby can be an unholy death sentence for the survivors.  Although it can be very risky to drop ruin...if it's getting destroyed in the first minute, may as well experiment.    
---
If you are going for Evil Incarnate, just keep trying. Eventually people will stop DCing.    
---
I can answer more specific questions if you have any.
---
That‚Äôs the same killer that face camped me I‚Äôm 100% sure lol

Imagine not chainsawing the pallet twice and completely ignoring it the third time

This post was made by the spirit fury enduring Billy gang

I was facecamped soloqueue at least 10 times last night.  No keys, no bm, no cause including hard tunneled into moris in back to back games.

Killers can be plenty toxic too man.  Players are toxic it isn't a side vs side thing.  Toxicity exists and is a huge problem on both sides.

It depends, blinding on a pallet or to save someone is alright, but I had this friend who kept blinding this nurse every time she blinked, and I felt bad for her cuz she was about to kill me finally and I 360‚Äôd and my friend came out of a locker with head on, he went back in the locker, she opened the locker and got DS‚Äôd the poor nurse had already given up and walked away from us so I just gave her a free kill and let her kill me, I felt bad and dm‚Äôed her ‚Äúsorry for my friend‚Äôs toxicity‚Äù

For the love of god please remove the single trial requirement. I'd rather it was 8 sacrifices than 4 in 1. I cant keep trying to beat this challenge. It genuinelly is having an effect on my mental health.
---
Please test your challenges in future.
---
Nurses ability is Spencer‚Äôs last breath, I don‚Äôt play nurse but ik that, and your saying she has an add-on that says bad-mans breath or something. Would that not be Spencer? because he is considered the bad guy for punishing mental asylum patients and that‚Äôs why I would assume the bad mans breath is is Spencer‚Äôs breath.
---
legion?
---
Neat
---
Or a way to get tokens back eg. Cleansing totems gives you tokens
---
Distortion is when you can't locker dodge it.
---
Face camping has its exceptions where it isn‚Äôt toxic, for example if there is someone around, it isn‚Äôt toxic, if it‚Äôs on the endgame collapse and everyone is been toxic the whole game and everyone is alive, I guess is alright for the killer to secure a kill
---
Body blocking? Flashlight blinding? Taking hits? Your team bringing BR, and you bringing DH, and DS, maybe even deliverance? There is ways to counter it, which literally give you up to 4 opportunities to survive, the killer normally has a motive to tunnel if he does so, and if he facecamps the team Can dead ass just genrush the fuck out of him and if they don‚Äôt want to, they can farm you with BR, the killer hits you, then you use DH, or BL to get to a loop, you loop him and if your DS is about to run out then you go into a locker, the way to play against toxic ppl is to be prepared to be toxic if you need to
---
If you see a 4 man swf and you ask them to do their challenges you‚Äôre either in for a fun game or the sweatiest game of your life. I did this w some dumb challenge like break a gen 40 times and they refused so I killed all but one and forced him to repair the gen until I got my challenge, then proceeded to hook him. 
---
If you play with fire you‚Äôre going to get burnt.
---
1.  That is the very definition of entitlement.  You killing 3 does not automatically mean you should get a 4K.
---
If I carried 3 dogshit trashcan teamates all game and you killed them you didn't earn a thing against me personally.  I don't deserve to automatically die just because my team sucked.  
---
The old hatch was miserable for killer.  All survivors had to do was find it (not even first) just find it and stand on it until they got hit out because only fools engaged in hatch standoffs and wasted that kind of time.  The new hatch is so killer sided in comparison it is silly to complain about it.  You should just leave well enough alone and be satisfied with how they balanced it.
---
This is so fucking cursed man
---
What about killers with no survivors?
---
How to beat tru3 101
---
Not a single argument was posted on that day. Hopefully they implement the bans ASAP.
---
He's still pretty strong if you're not a trashcan.
---
this is wild
---
i jokingly get tilted about it when i stream  but actually being mad about it is nuts like. if you don't want them doing gens in your face then... stop them?
---
What have you done to my child!?
---
Happy cake day
---
I‚Äôd be fine with that considering there‚Äôs 18 killers and 20 survivors.
---
Luckily I already have rank 3 Spirit Fury, just need to find Enduring and that's also the build I was likely going to run. I definitely agree that BBQ is more important than M&amp;A since you absolutely cannot waste time walking across the map for nothing.
---
I'm doing all the standard mind games and correct looping (have 1700 hours) but no SF+Enduring probably hurts too much considering he is just a M1 killer with no real benefit.
---
I wish I had the Scream for Myers build but I don't :/
---
I actually already got Evil Incarnate 
---
The man behind the bush, From the void she kills, Left For Dead, and Skilled Huntress are my only missing achievements for 100%
---
What add-on combos do you recommend?
---
It really depends trial to trial. There are different scoring methods used, both positive and negative for each emblem. The only ones I'm certain about are you get iridescent unbreakable for survivor if you escape without getting hit (maybe it's just without getting hooked but I'm not 100% on that), and I believe its 3 safe unhooks and a heal or 2 for iri benevolence. For killer side, I think if you sacrifice all 4 survivors with a certain amount of hooks (I want to say at least 8) that's iridescent as well.
---
That stupid and if a surv falls for that you play vs potatoes tbh
---
Beautiful üëÑ
---
Not really, happens in red ranks. But okay
---
This is what is done during killer queues
---
The add-on‚Äôs description says that it was taken from a patient known as the ‚ÄúBad Man‚Äù. Spencer‚Äôs Last Breath is just the power while many of the add ons relate to the patients at the asylum.
---
someone build a shrine to this person already jeez
---
Wait you‚Äôre the guy from the other thread about resilience!
---
haha love the downvotes from the salty sweatpants :D reddit is the home to such amazing "people" 
---
Yeah i know they said that still its kinda weird mechanic , the whole hatch. it needs a real good rework which makes endgame more fun or remove it simply and add a different thing to endgame, a more fun one and less who happens to stumple on it wins
---
I like the way you think
---
It's in the game because if it wasn't every single time a killer 3K's they'd 4K uncontested.  That isn't balance.  
---
Also gross about how thoroughly unfun you're making peoples games with the mandatory cheese slugs to cheese the hatch but at least you are objective about it and readily admit you know how shitty the games you're playing are for the opponent.  Most killer posters on here aren't capable of admitting even that.
---
I agree
---
Small buff to distortion: both yours and the guy you're healing / getting healed by's auras are hidden when at least one of you is using distortion and the killer is using A Nurse's Calling, since Nurses let's the killer see both the guy getting healed and the guy healing's auras Distortion should do the same (I actually don't know if Distortion already does this, correct if I'm wrong)
---
I found discordance underrated, with swf it gives the team so much info (bbq, nurses, gengrab Myers) so your basically able to genrush or find ruin safely until all the tokens are gone
---
Fine taste you have there, my friend.
---
I sure hope we get replica weapons or something
---
I have no idea what that means and I haven‚Äôt heard it either. I have 1,000 hours in this game.
---
But only one was missing from that set.
---
Since the Oni nerf Legion is no longer the worst killer in the game :)
---
They aren't downvoting you because they're salty they're downvoting you because they think your idea is tone deaf and biased.  I don't believe it's personal they just really think your idea is bad.
---
Lets all scream it out loud together
---
I'M PROUD OF BEING AROUSED BY VOMMY MOMMY!!!!!

Legion is better

He's probably the most fun killer IMO. He's probably like A, maybe B rank at this point post-nerf. I don't regret buying him at all, and if you're on PC the steam winter sale means he's something like $4 right now.
---
Do you play on PC or console? I play on PS4 and sometimes the lag is a little bad for me but it's usually manageable. I've only lost a handful of matches due to that.
---
When I was still a beginner killer and early yellow rank the Queue times were kind of long for me, maybe 5 minutes max, but when I got into green and purple it started going a lot faster for me. Maybe 30 seconds max to find a match. It could just be your location or time of day affecting how many people are online for you. 
---
Something that has been helping me a lot is watching Otzdarva and Tru3 play killer. Listening to their thought process and watching how they play has shown me some good tips for playing killer. Otzdarva also has some really informative guides for killers and for survivors too I think. 
---
I've mostly just played killer and only tried out survivor a handful of times. I joined a few survivor parties the other day which were supposed to be "chill/have fun/whatever" parties and the experience wasn't too fun for me. Maybe I just got a few bad groups, but I honestly couldn't stand the amount of complaining and whining that was coming from some of the other survivors. I did have a lot of fun just trying to survive and got junpscared quite a bit, but some of that experience was soured because of the toxic people in the party. 
---
I understand killers can be toxic as well so it goes both ways, but it all comes down to toxic people will be toxic no matter which role they choose.
---
GF is one of the best killers in the game, certainly the best stealth killer. Yea sure he can be "looped" on hawkins.
---
Ruin is a gamble, thats why its a hex. Thana stacks up quickly, Pop slows gens down a shit ton if you are competent. Corrupt is amazing, you just suck.
---
No actually, its bc they lack what top tiers have, map pressure, chase potential, ect.
---
More often then not, maps that are survivor sided are nerfed.
---
No mother left behind
---
Let‚Äôs shoot up FSB building in Moscow shall we
---
1. But the survivors not getting done anything and me playing very well should reward them with a safe escape ? kay mate, sad way to look at stuff 
---
you dont carry shit when you dont get a single gen done, you are dogshit yourself then and dont deserve a free escape 
---
Very balanced, much surivor main, many salty tears. get out kid, you dont bring arguments you only cry couse you seem to suck and blame it on your team.
---
Head On shouldn't be directly usable in a chase. From a design perspective it's about deciding to stop hiding, hence a 3-second charge. To have lockers be functional components in chases would be silly
---
My boi, Jake the Snake.
---
*heart attack* **averted**
---
If you are playing a top tier killer, gen speed and 99% of the loops are fair game.
---
Dude that's insane! Amazing drawing skills
---
Yeah but she was added 3 years ago
---
I mean I agree with what you said at the start but saying Lara is a over-glorified archeologist is like saying duke nuke‚Äôm is a average big bad guy with guns; it‚Äôs true but there‚Äôs a lot more story behind them than that. Those games are a bad comparison but Lara Croft has way too much history behind her in video games to be over glorified in any way. 
---
That might be a personal opinion but I feel like it‚Äôs a shared one because I‚Äôm sure I wasn‚Äôt the only one who played unnamed Lara Croft games on whatever console growing up
---
Can‚Äôt find gens but at least we have *infinite loops* /s
---
nah I think if they would think that they would simply give a reason why , otherwise its just salty survivors not liking anything regarding their advantage. If they got any better idead or simply see things different they could argue about it easily.
---
The reason people do it is because this sub immediately downvotes you if they decide you‚Äôre a toxic survivor main or a face camping, tunneling killer main.
---
Ranks mean little mate. Met some insane players who wasted me on Rank 19, met some potatoes who seemed to dont even understand the games basics on rank 2 
---
ranks sadly dont mean a lot in this game. most good killers tend to stay at lower ranks ( 10 ) couse they queue times at red ranks is abysmal for killers
---
Is there any killer that should run ruin though?
---
Demo's DLC is quite expensive and the killer is kinda underwhelming.
---
And it‚Äôs pretty damn new to me because the last time I remember hearing Lara Croft at all really was around the Ps2 hype (besides that eh game that they released a bit ago for her on newer consoles; not a huge fan of it).
---
The third perk is busted. This mechanic should not exist in the game because of how strongly it would be abused by good players.
---
Keep at it, soon enough you‚Äôll make people want to DC vs you
---
...landing
---
Hey this scarred me. Thank you
---
You literally said "when i play survivor, i pip so i win!"
---
Pipping isnt winning, Surviving is winning. You never stated that you actually survive, you stated that you pip.
---
Dude, spoiler, no one here is talking about pipping. I could sneeze and i would pip as survivor, thats not winning. 
---
God loops have always been broken, but killers have shit to counter it at least. I agree that some loops need to be toned down like nurses map, but you honestly cant say the game is largly survivor sided when Freddy, Billy, Nurse, Spirit, and GF are in the game.
---
This is incredible! I love how the colour is kind of subtle, it really makes the blood pop.
---
There‚Äôs nothing toxic about blinding a killer who is letting you continually blind them
---
It happened to me when I was playing trapper in rank 1 guy calls me a hacker on console cause my bear trap mad him go to the dying state instead of injured state I said look at addons but he said look at your internet and he shut it off for 3 hours
---
If I have 3 potato teamates that all last 10 seconds in chase and get hooked rapid attack against you that isn't on me.  I'm not even asking for an escape for myself because that would be ENTITLED I'm only asking for a chance which the hatch provides.  You on the other hand are ENTITLED in demanding a 4K when you kill the other 3. 
---
Lol oh God the survivor main stuff.  Did not disappoint.  You're barking up the wrong tree sweetie.  I'm a 50/50 player I don't main either side and I'm not entitled or biased.  It's because of my killer games where I'm looking at you like seriously bro?  How are you still whining about new hatch?  We close it.  We kill them.  We don't deal with 30 minute hiding stalemates anymore.  But thanks for not disappointing and showing yourself as the proto-typical biased immature sub member.  We don't have enough of you guys around here he typed in his most sarcastic typeface.
---
It‚Äôs a small world friend- you have a very recognizable name anonymous266268823.
---
I don't agree with everything here but as someone who mostly plays Survivor and occasionally Killer, Survs are so exceedingly rude when they have no reason to be.
---
I seem to see it a lot from both sides when Killer has a really bad game; is teabagging at the exit really necessary when it's a 0k game and Killer didn't do anything "against the rules"?
---
Yes.
---
Make sure both killers are ready. One killer stays in killer, the other goes to spectate. Killer ready, survivor ready. When the heartbeat starts saying games starting, the spectator goes to killer. You can do this with as much as you want, but it gets more broken. Like you can down a survivor when someone‚Äôs getting a mori and it would still count as ded
---
I wish I was back to 20 seconds ago when I didn‚Äôt know this existed
---
Well, i would recommend all killers. but id suggest any killer your getting used to
---
Some survivors literally have no idea how the game works
---
Yesterday I got reported for wall hacking because I was playing legion and I had bbq and chili
---
Every time I hooked someone the Claudette ran into a corner and became immersed, but I saw her do it with bbq so I just walked to the corner and got my free frenzy hit and found other people
---
&gt;Then I de-Pipped
---
The true tragedy.
---
thank you :)
---
yeah no for real
---
I mean to be fair I gave you a valid sensible reason why and you immediately defaulted to cartoonish levels of petty insinuations of lack of skill and accusations of being a salty survivor main.  Conduct yourself with more integrity and keep discussion respectable and on topic and maybe others will take the time to explain why they downvoted it.
---
Sounds beautiful tbh
---
Could do one with Legion and its Frank on the Tank
---
Interesting ideas but too weak. A good killer will rarely chase 60 seconds unless you're the last alive. Unless it's 60 cumalative seconds, in which case the perk is too powerful; survivors already have so many second chances. 
---
You won't even get downed 4 times unless the killer slugs &amp; this perk is barely better than Iron Will for the short time you get it, if you get it at all.
---
Survivalist is inferior to Windows Of Opportunity. A 3% boost just isn't much unless we're talking a movement speed boost as in PWYF, which is the single most important attribute.
---
No, no, no. I didn't mean it like that. I've played and enjoyed most of the games, she just doesn't fit in Dead by Daylight. Ash and even Bill make sense, because they're both in worlds where they fight legitimate monsters, and their chatacters fit in with the other Survivors. Lara fights monster-esque things, but her character wouldn't fit. Some characters being in the Entity's realm are a stretch (namely Bubba and Adam,) but Lara would just seem forced to fit into something where she doesn't.
---
I understand why its there, I just don't agree with it. I want everyone to have fun, but at rank 1 every kill counts. Ive given Many, many, many hatches in my day. Sometimes ill even hatch the guy I slugged lol.
---
My psn is L-Deku-L. I'm below a average at surv :(
---
Sure you are a 50/50 player. So am I honey. 
---
Go ahead and flame more you insecure moms-basement-dweller :D makes you only look more sad. 
---
Im not entitled to anything simply say you should get a better chance at getting a 4K which is the best victory if you played really well and not just make it luck depended or be forced to slug to get a chance since the surv only has to find the hatch and is out. 
---
if you dont got any facts and only repeat flame or straight up trying to mix my words up then dont reply to me kid. blocked
---
2 of the perks are already in the game and the 3rd perk needs a nerf
---
Jesus this might be the most entitled thing I've seen on this subreddit, and that's saying a LOT. DC penalties are in lots of games where losing a single player fucks the whole thing up because you deserve to have a harder time fucking other people's game up next time, and the time after that and so on.
---
It's also kinda a huge strawman. The majority of DCs are salty survivors that quit on their first or second down rather than toughing it out and trying to win, or salty killers that DC after being looped by one good survivor for too long.
---
You can not comprehend the level of Heresy I operate at.
---
I highly doubt it. Only way to know for sure is to open a support ticket on the DbD site and ask.
---
My dumbass in the enity's realm doing anything to survive
---
Well, it‚Äôs sole purpose is to aid survivors, so objectively it‚Äôs survivor sided.
---
imagine having your iridescent head be cucked by iron bars
---
post made from survivor who just went against an iri head huntress who had her hatchet be cucked by iron bars
---
Well fucking said mate
---
Do you believe God stays in Heaven because he too is afraid of what he created?
---
This is something that Ghostface should have if he ever gets map pressure
---
Blursed
---
HOLY SHIT THIS IS AMAZING
---
So if you're not having a nearly perfect day in the game you DC a ton? Just don't play at that point.
---
I have a clip exactly like this with Dwight getting mori'd by the Hag in L√©ry's! Hers is especially heinous to watch partially hidden because all you can hear is those liver eatin noises....
---
Thx for the info, don‚Äôt play her that much but knowing that now I think it‚Äôd be a cool Spirit-Oni Nurse-‚ÄúBad Man‚Äù type thing. What do you think would be his motive though? Just being insane? I mean it‚Äôs not a horrible thought but something like maybe where they thought he was insane but he wasn‚Äôt and they locked him up for years and that‚Äôs why he now sows vengeance. Very cool idea tbh.
---
All you got is petty troll responses and personal insults.  I kept my comments to the topic and didn't turn anything personal into you.  So yes if you're going to act like a 14 year old and troll me in your childish responses please by all means block me.  I don't give the time of day to trolls and it is quite clear at this point that you're incapable of sensible discussion.  You just want to insult people to make yourself feel less small.
---
You forgot the noed and insidious chainsaw
---
I wanna hear Claudette scream: "COLO TERRORITA!"
---
Dang it... Have you done it before? üò≠
---
Hmm good argument. Do you think its fine this way ? I think its hard to tell since in some games the last survivor def. deserves the hatch if he played real well but on the other side in some games the killer really deserves the 4 K if he played really well.   
---
And slugging of course counters the hatch kinda but its boring to me as killer and me playing survivor of course
---
Disagree within certain scenarios. If I‚Äôm clicking to get the killer‚Äôs attention off somebody it may be annoying, but not toxic, I just want to take some heat off my teammate.
---
I got this challenge done when the second time was out :( I want to die
---
Tactics are never toxic.
---
If a tactic works against your opponent, then it was worth using. People's perception of what is fair and what isn't is a joke.
---
I played swf four-stack against a Cannibal that ran insidious. He hooked the survivor and hid nearby. I came to rescue, having heard no heartbeat, and he came out chain-sawing and downed me.
---
Some people would be angry for the camping, but it literally worked as a viable tactic. I learned my lesson and moved on.

Description: A few times a week, connecting to a lobby will error out to the main menu with a message saying ‚ÄúYou must be connected to the internet to play.‚Äù
---
All three times this has happened I have tried playing other games, restarting my PS4, Router, and television. DBD is the only program which experiences this connectivity issue. I have to simply wait it out a few hours for the game to decide I‚Äôm actually connected to the internet and join a lobby. 
---
Reproduction rate: A couple times a week, seemingly at random.
---
This happened to me not too long ago, I was also using balanced landing, then soon I was constantly running just like you and it didn't stop until my adrenaline activated. I was PS4 btw
---
So hype for these changes. 
---
Distressing+Restraint addon is gonna be dirty. Hook someone, use blast, and you‚Äôve now got auras on everyone within 40m of the hook. Bring Iron Maiden with it and there‚Äôs gonna be some hurt.
---
No, but transactions digitally don‚Äôt work like that. It‚Äôs a fixed price and companies are greedy sometimes. It‚Äôs be easier for iridescent
---
Just use Surveillance
---
Iron will
---
Same. Kinda curious though, how do y'all feel about hook sabos?
---
Here‚Äôs mine
---
You start with no tokens, you gain one for doing an altruistic action or doing a gen for thirty seconds.  One token will effectively prevent the killer from getting any information on your location and when it‚Äôs used you lose a token.  You can have a max of 2/3/4 tokens
---
GG reposted under discussion instead of rant.
---
Sydney Pesos... Sydney‚Äôs Mexican cousin
---
I mean it is but i don't want to wait 10 minutes for a fucking game and then for it to end in 50 seconds
---
Well then thank you. I'll just wait till they drop the dlc price even lower and maybe bought it then.
---
A dbd YouTuber, No0b3, has a video where he ran the killer for over 20 minutes. Two teammates were dead and there was one gen left. This gen did not get popped after 20 MINUTES and in postgame chat, No0b3 asked what the guy was doing. The guy said ‚Äúdoing gens, you?‚Äù Since then, that response has been used for when people are doing nothing in a game. The video is called getting chased for 20 minutes or something like that.
---
Tunneling is a survivor‚Äôs error, not a killer‚Äôs toxicity. Unhooking a survivor while a killer can reasonably get them is a mistake. If a killer of close enough to a survivor who he hooked to hit him again upon unhooking, then he‚Äôs either camping or proxy camping. You need to take this time to do other gens, not unhook a teammate. Eventually, the killer will learn that you won‚Äôt pip if you keep playing in this way, because of the proximity penalty and because he isn‚Äôt pressuring the map.
---
I mean, it wasn‚Äôt like the killer wanted to get blinded, I‚Äôm pretty sure he/she was trying to get the daily for nurse, and my friend was 100% doing it for BMing, and it was kinda obvious
---
I don‚Äôt think I want to live if I have to run MoM.
---
nerfed into the grave good luck getting 3 protection hits without dying first. Not saying it‚Äôs impossible but a perk should help you not be a chore
---
U forgot about claudette
---
This is gold. Really well done!
---
Wow. This is phenomenal
---
It's actually REALLY fun now! After they fixed protection hits it's pretty decent and killers never expect it
---
Me, who used Splinter Pig before getting the Dlc yesterday, getting a 4k with red ranks survivors in my lobby when I was rank 9
---
Good job! It took me 3 years to get this achievement.
---
Well it isnt really new is it :D The Rework was some time ago
---
They said in a recent livestream they weren't doing one, I believe.
---
A buddy of mine got reported for wallhacking too ... while playing scratched mirror Myers.
---
If I have a good few hours to play, sure I'll sit there on the hook, but I'm sorry I missed the memo where everyone just has the time to sit at home and wait for the timmer on the hook to be done. I have a life away from gaming. Not everyone is living at home in their parents house playing this game. Some of us have limited free time to themselves.
---
Ok what about up to three seconds depending on a time you‚Äôve been in a locker
---
I hung a baby Dwight up once and left the area immediately so his teammates could save him.  I knew these were low level players and I wanted everyone to feel good about themselves and get some points and build skills and confidence. 
---
They. Let. Him. Die.  First hook. 
---
It was game on after that. When the game was over, I sent the Dwight a friend request. I‚Äôm on switch so we can‚Äôt send messages but I wanted to tell him gg.

Why is it BM to flash a killer? Isn‚Äôt that the primary use of flashlights? The Nurse should learn to avoid flashlights, but rather than do that they continued with their failed method. It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to learn to avoid a flashlight beam.

Lol all I'm saying is you don't get to complain about facecamping if you actively play to reward them for doing it.

It‚Äôs not the flashlight part that was toxic, it‚Äôs my friend who was purposely doing it to piss her off, she was just trying to get a hit after blinking to get the daily done and every time she got a blinking stun my friend would blind her and she couldn‚Äôt do much about it since you can barely move your camera when in the blinking stun
---
So spirit phases. From a survivor‚Äôs point of view, she stands still and then teleports. What‚Äôs really happening is she‚Äôs going invisible and walking at an increased speed, a lot like wraith, but she can‚Äôt see any survivors. She can see scratch marks and hear sounds, but she can‚Äôt see anyone. It takes practice, but if she manages to find a survivor, she can lunge out of phasing and into an attack without warning.
---
This is why a lot of survivors don‚Äôt like her. It breaks the basic chase mechanics and can be very difficult to counter. Of course this is perfect for sweaty killers, you strap on some good perks to her, and the survivors hardly stand a chance if they‚Äôre solo players.
---
I 100% agree. He makes occasional mistakes- as does everyone. However he's very very analytical and focuses on details. I like him.
---
Heavy breathing cat is the greatest meme in the whole world. I love and respect this post
---
Because there aren‚Äôt enough players in the game anymore.
---
no, you dont need either, but depending on the killer they can be really good
---
It absolutely isn't over rated. It is easily broken yes. But causing some survivors to completely bail on a gen to look for 1 of 5 totems while other survivors get gens done at sometimes half speed is borderline neccesary for red rank play, especially on m1 killers.
---
r/dbdlfg
---
For bonus points they do it with no Borrowed Time in a game where the killer ran a mori lol.
---
Kinda questioning if there is a stereotype of something related for not helping or farming with a specific Killer. Example: "I dislike or like this Killer and this is why I do / don't help her or him."
---
But her phantasm traps can be burned and it is easier to do so with a flashlight. So really, begs the question the case on why folks dare to ignore her or others.
---
Wow very interesting, thank you so much. I guess thats one of the reasons multiple people have suggested iron will.  Does she still appear on spine chill during phasing ?
---
This is incredible
---
Im thinking you‚Äôre joking right since Inner Strength wouldn‚Äôt do anything due to the No Mither? But there are aspects of the game I don‚Äôt fully understand yet, so many there‚Äôs something here?
---
I was thinking something like Stake Out where you have to be in the killers terror radius for a bit to gain a token. Kind of like a get close to the killer to have them not know where you are.
---
They can get to a further away pallet vs. having to use a closer one. If they just run immediately they have a lot more time and distance before they need to use a pallet again.
---
"the amount of second chance perks" NOED is a 2nd chance perk, Adren is a reward for doing well, you dont need another chance if you are winning.
---
Plot twist: there is no chest
---
You don‚Äôt have to but Enduring is a nice perk it let‚Äôs you challenge pallets a lot more by swinging through than and Bamboozle is also good on certain killers but gets kinda fucked by certain maps
---
Daaaaaayyyuuuumm this is sooo good! Devs don‚Äôt even got anything on this art work. Good job friend!
---
Oni's a tough draw, lots of details to pay attention to. This looks really cool so far, you got this!! :D
---
If you're truly at a safe pallet then you should run away immediately to start gaining massive distance. Since it's safe, if the killer decides not to kick it, just run back to it and stay there. You should be looking behind you in chases to know if you should stay or not.

Description:  Trying to do the tome challenge for 15 iridescent emblems and if you play games in a row after your first game any iridescents you get don‚Äôt count towards the challenge. Every time I want to earn more towards the challenge I have to close the application to restart the game and then play another game. 
---
Steps to reproduce: Seemingly just play a game with the challenge enabled.  This happens consistently and always happen when I try to reproduce it.
---
Not to suggest that you can, but in the report system it lists camping as an offense under Harassment/Unsportsmanlike

(I just realized I'm off topic with this comment but it's too long so ii dont want to delete it. You dont have to read) I only tend to farm when I'm playing babies and theres only 2 survivors left and 5 gens (because babies) but a lot of times I'll sacrifice them a little. Of course, theres been times I fuck up and they're dead on hook. I usually stop playing a message them (ps4) profusely apologizing and usually they're cool about it but once and a while I get really salty survivors who dont belive me and think my whole plan was to earn they're trust by farming then kill them. Why would I apologize then bitch?
---
God we live in a generation where when someone says something to get their point across it comes off as an insult. Guess you took it too personal.
---
Was it worth it
---
Terrible players treat killer as 1v1 instead of 1v4.  They tunnel survivors individually because they never watched the right resources to learn how to properly play the game or figured it out for themselves.  
---
I had a Trapper do this to me last night comically hard tunneling me off both hooks ignoring the entirety of my team including injured survivors in front of him.  Needless to say there was a d strike and more loops in his future as they finished the rest of the gens. 
---
He ragequit as I deadharded past his swing to make the gate.
---
Imagine not humming a dope ass tune that frickin' slaps while you murder some fools?
---
This would look great as a tattoo geez
---
Fine, be that way. Bleed the player base dry because you can't type out a simple "gg" and move on.
---
You can move horizontally, plus what‚Äôs so toxic about someone wasting the killers time? That‚Äôs the whole point of flashlights
---
You should have finished cleansing, that way it might have been somebody other than you that went down.
---
You were talking to me directly and framed it as me being a loser in his parents basement with endless time on my hands for criticizing you.  Just own it don't back off from it lol.  But yeah in the future just try to keep it about the topic.  People like me turn off the second someone defaults to petty personal insults or attacks.  Have a good one man.
---
Based on context I would assume they wanted to do like a 2 survivors vs 2 survivors where you would sandbag each other and try to escape as your own 2 person team. Other than that I have no idea
---
Congratulations
---
Someone who plays both sides equally definitely has less of a bias than someone who only plays one side exclusively. Doesn‚Äôt mean their ideas are perfect but they do have a more complete understanding of the game, as everyone should, than someone who has *never even experienced* the other perspective. It‚Äôs not rocket science. How are people so ignorant they don‚Äôt see the logic in this.
---
Nothing jumpscares me more than a huntress that manages to peg me with a hatchet from across the map over a building in the middle of me running to a hook.
---
They are worthy of running, but its no Ruin.
---
Dude, I‚Äôm not saying flashlights are toxic, can you even read? I‚Äôm saying my friend‚Äôs purpose was to piss off the killer, therefore flash lighting him nonstop, going in lockers using DS and head on, getting cocky and teabagging, after reading that, all of that could be used to waste the killer‚Äôs time, but it could be toxic depending on how the person is using those things, so yea, it might not be toxic as some ppl use them but it becomes toxic once a person uses them in a toxic way to BM

They need to make it either shorter, or make it so dailies give rift fragments or something. At this point I'm not playing the game because I want to, but because I feel like I have to.

Im also confused as well, idk if people bought their way to level 70 or they just play 24/7
---
I find it killer sided, killer can close the hatch, hatch is easy to find if you listen for it.
---
It‚Äôs a bug
---
Ghostface is already really strong this would be too much. But for its own killer this could work
---
The problem is the "facecamping" has also become "proxy camping" and "patrolling" and "the exit gates are literally open already so I have to defend this one hook."  Does it suck to get facecamped on your first hook while no gens have been done yet?  Absolutely, been there, done that.  But survivors complain a lot about perceived camping and tunneling when they're at fault.  Killer saw you run to the hook, or has BBQ or whispers and knows you're close by, why would he just leave without looking?  It really is an important distinction, both whether this is straight-up actual facecamping or the killer knows someone else, and that there's /no gameplay justification/ for the teabags and clicking, they serve no other purpose than being toxic.  They aren't progressing the game state, they're just trying to piss off the killer by doing those things.  
---
I'm not trying to defend literal facecamping either, it sucks and they should feel bad about themselves, but the amount of times I've heard complaints about camping and tunneling that were neither, really make me hesitant to take it at face value.  I've been playing way more survivor than killer lately, I've been tunneled directly off the hook with zero chance to run, and I've been "tunneled" a couple minutes after an unhook without anyone else getting chased/hooked between my hooks.  One's a whole lot more toxic than the other.
---
Dude. I played ten matches last night and I am a rank 13 right now (I peeked at 6 two months ago when I stopped playing.) But all ten had at least two red ranks and the rest were fucking purple.

Yeah I'm a bit confused by the stats on Huntress. People don't perform as well with her, but even on Lerys she can be brutal

How many gens did that cost?
---
‚ÄúOnly killers are allowed to have mains!!!!‚Äù
---
Just meant the state of the game kinda makes it mandatory,  unless your playing rank 20s those gens go quick
---
PIG ON A RIG
---
Oh. Well, close enough, whatever.
---
i know it sounds lame, but being an afk survivor till u die is mostly how i did it, other than getting 100% of the challenges done. i like to run WGLF, Borrowed Time, and Deliverance, and only act when there's someone to unhook. the afk crows get me killed sooner or later but i can usually get some bps. and as far as rift progression, i'd be level 100+ by now if it counted that far (which i think it should, just for the fun of it). i also think they should count how many levels deep you got into every level p3 50 character. i'm curious to know how far i chased the last perk i needed for each character
---
That was fantastic! Well done!
---
Go take a bath with toaster-chan

i guessed oil rig too but just wanted to be sure. interesting. its like a real life video game complex

I played a lot since some challenges took much longer than others, and I generally just like to play a lot too. Since I‚Äôm pretty much done with the Rift, I can just take a break / not play as much until the next Tomb

Honestly those moments are the most fun in the game imo xD
---
The entity is attempting to summon Satan, next killer confirmed!
---
I watch trutalent a lot on YT and I know he mentions certain killers are 4v1 and some are better 1v1. I‚Äôm assuming that meant juggling hitting survivors vs committing to getting one hooked.  So I kept trying to use that context when this survivor said 2v2 lol. I‚Äôm like ‚Äòthere‚Äôs a lingo here I‚Äôm just not getting.‚Äù Googling past reddit and dbd board discussions came up with nothing.

I‚Äôm older so it reminded me of my first days playing mmos and learning shit like ‚Äòtanking‚Äô...‚Äôpulling‚Äô..etc.

I had the same experience playing Pig for the first time the other night. Red Rank 4 man squads almost every match. Some of them apologized afterwards for the match making system and for the Coldwind offerings.
---
I don't understand the problem with this if this is serious, and if it's a joke, I don't get it
---
Exactly, I'd much rather have a super fun game and not sweat for 4K. I'm perfectly happy if I just have fun and I average two kills.
---
Neither do I. I have too much fun playing and when I see, that I was the lowest - I simply apologize if I played bad.
---
Dw, the overpriced skins and shitty battle pass system is much better then spicing up the same game mode we have had for 3+ years.

---

---
No, Bamboozle is too situational because not every map has a super strong window. Enduring, I don‚Äôt see why you wouldn‚Äôt run it. It‚Äôs a solid perk that helps your chase, some survivors get greedy and think you would respect a pallet but walking through can easily net free hits.
---
How is that unfair for the killer. He is being a killer. It's only unfair by the survivors for DC'ing. Unless they didnt mean to then it's just the game being played.
---
Determination and stubbornness as well as a good amount of luck play a role as well, yes.
---
I generally let them go if they Kobe. It‚Äôs just not very often.
---
Ive been seeing a lot more lagswitching on xbox. I've never run into them before but after the rift came out I started to.
---
i tried to think of a backstory, and here it is:
---
*"(Bad Man) Had Once A Wife. And Once, He Went To A Bar. There, He Saw Woman Looking Like His Wife Kissing With Unknown Man. He Got Angry, And Stabbed The Man In A Back. The Woman Screamed, And She Runned Out Of A Bar. (Bad Man) Tried To Chase Her, But She Escaped. With His Broken Heart, He Could Not Enter is House. So, He Decided To Go To Nearest Forest, And Sleep There. He Found An Abadondaned Homeless Shack, And Slept There. When He Woke Up, He Was At Some Building. He Tried To Get Out, But He Was Chained. A Woman From A Bar In A Nurse Outfit Came Up To Him, With A Sad Face. Then He Realized, That The Woman At That Bar Wasn¬¥t His Wife."*
---
bassicaly, that woman was a mckeena moris, and he got into entity after he died.
---
award pls
---
*smacks lips* noice.
---
Besides Nancy, Steve, Yui and Ashe, I have at least every survivor at prestige one. Feng Min and Tapp are prestige 3, Meg, David and Kate are at two.
---
For killers, everyone besides the Oni is at least prestige one, with Huntress and clown, Trapper and Wraith at 2.
---
I'm not sure how long I've been playing in hours, but I started playing this game in March of last year.
---
It's always cool to see. I just can't bring myself to kill someone who legitimately kobes if they weren't toxic.
---
3/10 only cause i like surveillance
---
Yeah and it's 4% chance.  Mix that with it not being their last hook, and how many games played,  it's such a small chance.  I'm ok with it.  I swear I can see disbelief in that mask.
---
She was just helping you out lol
---
Bitch there's no reason to potentially add something that could be new and add more variety to builds considering you almost never see No Mither unless someone is memeing or has one of these quests? That's what changes metas and keeps things from being stale. You need a REASON to spice things up?
---
You're boring and have no vision.
---
He was dancing and then he saw you yeet and just watched you leave in sadness. D;
---
My one regret is that I didn't leave him my key :c
---
I see how you can get that message, but I just stated how this post comes off
---
The last part of the last gen
---
Underage yet has her titty out ü§∑
---
Speaking of Oni on a Pony, I like to hit ponies.
---
Seriously please do finish it
---
If you really like this build just do you. 
---
And to offer suggestions that doesn‚Äôt totally change it up:
---
- Hang mans trick is worthless. Literally almost as worthless as monstrous shrine. You can literally put anything else there and it would be better. 
---
- Switch Bloodhound for Sloppy Butcher. Takes longer to heal, giving you more time to track blood by forcing the survivors to heal longer. You could end up hearing them as well but at the least your buying time if they are insistent on healing, and that can shut down generator progress if you‚Äôre aggressive enough.
---
Otherwise, this isn‚Äôt really the greatest build if you‚Äôre trying to climb rank and take the matches seriously. But if you‚Äôre just having fun then do what makes it fun for you. Just please don‚Äôt be like most of the Pigs I encounter and play like a scumbag. I‚Äôve encountered maybe two non scummy Pigs this year.
---
Definitely survivor, but I like to play killer too. I would say of all those hours maybe 70% survivor and 30% killer. I just like to play survivor more because of a friend I regularly play the game with :)
---
Sike, I don't even have to press Distortion, it's saved on "Remember Me"

At this point I don't even know who is the real killer here
---
ah i misunderstood
---
as a dwight main i can confirm
---
For one I play more killer than Survivor and second that should have not hit at all, 3 it was a joke video so thanks for being Toxic over a joke XD
---
me too. its fun enuff when u actually complete one, but im still against the stressful ones
---
You must barely play this game.
---
Congrats, man.
---
I need advice on how to stop Survivors DCing the second I start to take them to the basement. I can‚Äôt do either Killer challenges because they DC, or if i‚Äôm doing the Agitation one they‚Äôll suicide and then I can‚Äôt get the 6 hooks I need.
---
Imo it shouldn‚Äôt be able to be used in a chase directly. What I mean is if the instance occurs where you are able to head on a killer while in a chase, you should be able to use it. It‚Äôs very rare that that happens. However, you 100% should not be able to hop in a locker while in a chase, and head on the killer mid chase. Reducing the timer would make the perk so op. I already want Head On because of how strong it can be, adding this buff would make everyone want it lol.
---
Remove balanced landing, spine chill and dark sense and put no mither
---
Your attention to detail is really nice, I love the shading of the veins in his arms!
---
u/vredditshare
---
Nope, I'm just really really lazy to equip challenges every time I complete them.
---
Consider running party streamers maybe as incentive to stay.  I did that during my Evil Incarnate trophy
---
Probably he‚Äôs to say I guess when you all walked into traps one after the other lol, trapper is a slower start but probably a pretty balanced killer probably one of the few
---
Now i want a endgame triggering "DAT ASS" Mori for the clown ! DAMIT !

---
I‚Äôve only encountered this twice and I was getting face camped, I feel like the devs were rooting for me to get out
---
Forgot to mention, but really head on is more of an altruistic perk. It‚Äôs more meant for helping other survivors while they‚Äôre in a chase or saving you from being locker grabbed. If you‚Äôre gonna use head on, you should use it to get saves, and help your teammates get distance from the killer or aggro the killer to take the heat off your teammate.
---
Laurie would be expected. Spooky Nancy was a nice surprise.
---
If you OoO you can basically the be informant of your team and let them know where the killer is at all times. That combined with by staring at the killer you can tea bag from wherever you are to try and bait the killer towards you by being an asshole. 
---
As far as stream sniping, being able to see the killer's PoV in itself is already pretty bad considering it's against the rules to do so since it makes the game unfair. That combined with complaining about that streamer's twitch chat after you lose when given every possible advantage just makes them more of a douche.
---
I have a serious appreciation for art, and I respect you for this. This is really well done, and for your first time doing color, the shading is surprisingly really nice. Good job, and I can't wait to see the finished product. Good luck :)
---
a dc would fit perfect in this claudette situation
---
It gives the player endurance (an extra hit). 
---
It used to be OP as hell but they‚Äôve nerfed it into the ground so it takes forever to activate the endurance.
---
I finished it. I didn't really mind the grindy part of it since I was gonna play the game regardless of the pass or not so it just goes up while I do my thing. On top of that completing every challenge and just doing well in my matches earned me EXP fast. In the end I was able to complete it four days before the fourth tome came out.
---
I should mention I'm only an 18yr old with no work yet and I'm out for the semester so I gotta lotta time on my hands to grind lol. It's killer for people that have jobs and responsibilities and I think it sucks for them. It should be more accessible to the average player imo
---
Exactly
---
Yeah absolutely, the learning curve on nurse is insane but once you get there she‚Äôs near unbeatable!
---
Do you think people won‚Äôt play a character because slightly inconsistent in game mechanics? Because let me tell you about a little something called ‚ÄúWake Up glitch‚Äù and ‚ÄúClown Reload Glitch‚Äù and ‚ÄúLegion addon bug‚Äù and‚Äî

The major difference between Survivor BM and Killer BM is that Killer BM completely stops another player from having any fun. Getting slugged, camped, tunneled, or Mori'd means that player is doing absolutely nothing, and then getting booted from the game. Thanks for joining that Killer's lobby... And there's nothing they can do about it either. That's Dead By Daylight for survivors, if they get a toxic killer.  
---
Meanwhile, seeing a survivor character model point or crouch doesn't change your gameplay at all. If that alone irritates someone, then they probably shouldn't be playing online games anyway. Who was it that popularized the idea that any survivor emote is "toxic" anyway? It seems so silly to me that when you're chasing people to stab them and put them on a sacrificial hook, being pointed at is apparently bullying. Like, I'm all for more sensitivity in most situations, but this is one of those times Killers need to calm down and just understand if anything the Survivor is slowing them self down to emote.
---
They don't make it intuitive, that's for certain.
---
:(
---
Do you need to complete every single challenge to get lvl 70?
---
All one of the people still apart of that gang lmao

Their battle will be LEGENDARY
---
No one's entitled to tell others how to play no matter what in the end. As long as they're actually playing that is. By that I mean throwing matches or DCing cause that's not playing the game it's just wasteing time
---
Damn, I originally thought of that lol
---
Don‚Äôt worry my guy, I despise toxic players especially ones that give Pig a bad name, thanks for the tips
---
Try to impregnate him
---
People want BP bonuses for using No Mither, while WGLF is right there and is also coincidentally one of David's perks. Funny how the perks that come from the same survivor work the best together.
---
When I was starting off with trapper I thought I was a genius for ‚Äúinventing‚Äù the killer shack traps. Whenever the window one got saboed I‚Äôd be like ‚ÄúHOWWWW‚Äù ü§£
---
Lmfao nice job mate
---
It's either 50/50 or slightly survivor sided depending on the killer. If the killer is someone with high mobility or a way to trap the gates it's 50/50, whoever finds hatch first wins.
---
If not, survivors have a chance to make it to a door if hatch gets closed.
---
A legend that's who
---
The DCs are lame as shit I‚Äôll agree with you on that. I wish there was a way that if someone DCs the challenge immediately becomes ‚Äúhook 3 survivors in the basement.‚Äù 
---
Changing perk loadouts greatly effects how I play the game as killer.
---
Same thing happened to me i just bought ghost face and im getting fucked so hard lmao but its cool atleast no one has messaged me yet saying ez
---
It‚Äôs about sending a message.
---
You get stunned by the burn once and can move your camera freely after that
---
I think that squidward tentacles would be a great killer in dbd
---
You get stunned everytime you blink, have you ever played nurse against 4survivors with flashlights?
---
*first gen pops before I even had time to get there and I haven't even set a trap*
---
Haha nice.
---
Here's the link to everyone that can't handle the truth 
---
https://youtu.be/3c03hBfakms
---
DS and Head On aren‚Äôt toxic, there‚Äôs counterplay to both (DS less in End Game situations). All I‚Äôm saying is you have more insight about your friend, so yes maybe he is toxic for how he did it, but realistically you‚Äôre playing VS Nurse, she shouldn‚Äôt be getting bullied. If she is, she‚Äôs a bad killer and you can‚Äôt really call someone toxic for simply outplaying the killer.
---
Challenges not working properly? That is quite shocking.
---
Except no challenge forces a whole perk loadout change. Just one perk. They can encourage a total perk loadout change, but brutal strength alone shouldn't really change anything about your playstyle.
---
Why would she have no perks
---
This is legit fantastic
---
Do not do this.
---
Nice!
---
Yeah I‚Äôm on PS4 as well, we do have disadvantages but trust me stick at it if you wanna play killer!
---
Self Care for WGLF.  I agree your other perk options are pretty rough so use WGLF in place of shitty Self Care and grind yourself some bps quick to unlock yourself some more perks.
---
I know right? doesn't happen very often?
---
A fellow clown main and admirer.
---
No but it does reduce the grind drastically
---
No. I like Tomb Raider but it isn't horror. This is a game for horror icons. At least the Evil Dead started as (an attempt at) horror.
---
Claudette is more hated
---
Wow... This looks amazing so far
---
She‚Äôs that good
---
I think I got level 70 3 weeks ago.
---
Windows of opportunity could help you find unused pallets past that idk
---
Exit Surv/Killer menu, Enter Archives, select archive(?), exit to main menu, re-enter lobby. Don‚Äôt see why they can‚Äôt let us change archives while in queue. They‚Äôd probably bug everything out if they tried though, so I guess I‚Äôm thankful they haven‚Äôt.
---
Congrats! I actually got a few friends to help me there. They 99% the gens and I just went running around completing them rofl
---
I‚Äôd say about 4% of the time they Kobe
---
BuT iF wE dOn‚ÄôT hAvE sWf ThE gAmE wIlL dIE

that yui's voice sounds familiarü§î
---
There is also the no mither + adrenaline + self care + solidarity, a much more op combo
---
Use Sloppy over Bloodhound and anything, literally anything, over Hangman‚Äôs Trick. Also if that‚Äôs the Demo perk I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good for Pig, unless you plan on getting no downs with your Dash. Unless I‚Äôm thinking of a different perk, Surge doesn‚Äôt activate on her second attack.
---
Yeah, maybe BHVR had the penalty in mind when designing these challenges but if that is the case they needed to come to console at the same time.
---
She's diewithlivv on YouTube, she's also been a meg once in my past vids
---
You forgot toxic
---
Whoever in the devteam is making the challenges that encourage basement camping or other unpleasant gameplay for survivors should be fired.
---
Literally every game I'm trying to play now is basement camp, damn effective one.
---
Sole survivor? /s
---
"That's...that's not supposed to happen?!"
---
Tier lists absolutely hold the top spot for the most overused meme, so does "so anyways, I started blasting (but I'll forgive that one as it features Danny Devito)." This one's definitely rising up the overused list, and only a few of them are even really funny.
---
Dark sense and bond worked for me
---
What's the youtube?
---
This picture honestly makes me wanna vomit.
---
Didn't touch on that aspect otherwise it would be twice as long, but absolutely. Survivors shouldn't expect basement games or tunneling when challenges are out.
---
PC, I‚Äôve played since Myers was announced. With PC you can jerk your camera far quicker than on console, so all it takes it to be half blinded before you flick your camera and don‚Äôt get burned. 
---
What you do after avoiding the burn, well idk I don‚Äôt play Nurse that often, but on PC getting burned is RARE, like blue moon rare.
---
You‚Äôre thinking of calm spirit
---
I had Better Together and Prove Thyself and shrouds that started survivors together and still barely got that one.
---
Watch this person turn out to be someone who cried about Spirit being OP...
---
I still have bbq at level 1 on Huntress
---
I actually had a whole thread about this a couple weeks ago
---
If you want a sauce I could remake this with the template I made in dbd and get transparent images for you. I'd have to make a transparent image from a screenshot for all 4 people so it may take an hour or two.
---
Just wait for the Scrapped Tape add-on with Restraint. New Scrapped tape will give survivors a Static charge and if they touch another survivor with it, the other survivor tiers up and scream.
---
I got tunneled endlessly as a low level Dwight for literally no reason at the start of a match. No teabagging or toxicity at all. You get kinda used to it. Although it‚Äôs annoying how much this community backs up killers sometimes. Any tactic is ok for killers to use to win, but if a survivor gets gens done fast or pop a gen in someone‚Äôs face: they‚Äôre ToXiC. A killer once let me bleed out because they didn‚Äôt want to give me a chance to wiggle free. All my teammates were hooked nearby leaving not many hooks free. Everyone told me I should have crawled to a hook nearby if I didn‚Äôt want to wait to bleed out. They also said I wasn‚Äôt entitled to a win, but apparently the killer was just because he downed me once??? I shouldn‚Äôt have to crawl to my death just because a killer is too scared of losing his 4k. Despite the high chance of him knocking me if I wiggled free because I wasn‚Äôt even near a pallet.
---
Shame this company has gone down hill
---
Hol up
---
In console, you can‚Äôt really avoid easily, it requires for you to have max sens and the surv to have half bad aim to avoid it, and getting burned while playing nurse is quite often in console, mainly because people try to piss off each other constantly in the game
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/edv58f/whats_a_good_perk_build_for_survivers/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
im probably not making it to 70. im only tier 36 or something lmao i actually like the grind but the challenges aren't rewarding enough for me to buy another one of these archives/rift passes again especially if i have to just play every single day regardless. im sleep.
---
How are people upvoting this? You're literally admitting to ruining the game for 4 other players everytime you play, and advocating others to do the same?!? That is horrible dude play the fucking game right or go play something else.
---
Dont intentionally be an afk piece of crap and brag about how smart you are dude.
---
for some bizarre reason, when the event started i was already at rift level 23. got to 70 super fast
---
Claudette has a complicated image in DbD I think, but it's not all bad. A lot of people genuinely like her, her character is written as incredibly sweet and heartwarming, and when I play as Killer for the most part I don't see most Claudettes as different from any other well-meaning survivor player. I quite like the different personalities and styles of the Claudettes I see.
---
The image of the toxic P3 Claudette came from the Ochido days where she would be played in a way meant to antagonize the Killer player outside the realm of normal DbD objectives. A lot of players can associate that image with toxicity and immaturity: a player who taunts, pokes and prods rather than plays with sportsmanship.
---
Separately, there's an image of the Blendette as a type of gameplay that relies so much on brute camouflage at the expense of interaction and teamwork. Called "immersed," it's the image of a Claudette who spends a disproportionate time hiding in bushes and corners. It's an especially negative association for survivor teammates who feel these Claudettes are not putting in their fair share of the effort and are generally waiting out the deaths of their teammates.
---
And finally, similar to a selfishness of hiding, the concept that Self Care is usually more wasteful in time than completing generators or getting healed by someone else. Obviously new players flock to Self Care because it's an obvious counter to being injured (and who wants to be injured?) but veteran players see it more critically in terms of its time payoff.
---
In any case, I wouldn't worry about what others think about your choices in characters or perks. Pick who you like, dress them up how you want, and give them whatever abilities and have fun. You get to decide who your Claudette is when you play her
---
Not all Claudettes are sweaty assholes, but all sweaty assholes are Claudettes.
---
Ah-ehm... pallet? What are these... pallets?  
---
Also, can you go through walls? No?  
---
Didn't think so.
---
Ds, Borrowed, deliverance, Dead hard, adrenaline. Important to note, 4 people in 1 game can use these. No brainer.
---
I use detectives a lot, so im usually the one cleansing anyway. If I get hit by noed then it's our fault tbh. Ganes fly waaaay too fast anymore for the "cause pressure" argument to even stay afloat. I was just saying Noed is just a bad perk by default.  Hate swf? Not at all, just want the game balanced. I like how adrenaline talk ALWAYS turns into a NOED conversation lol. Not even the same level. Pretty sick of discussing noed tbh, so im just gonna quit lol.
---
Template plz?
---
Really wish Distortion was on a cooldown instead of a token system
---
I like to award the last player with hatch if they played well :)
---
It was a bug
---
They didn't bother fixing it and they just let it slide
---
Well thats cool, I just find mike the most frightening :)
---
Well that depends on who you are chasing :)
---
Yeah, they were probably thinking they'd caught Lex Luthor himself when they hooked you and were trying to exact righteous vengeance for your multitude crimes against humanity.  When, in reality, they just caught Evravon.
---
hey finally a bug in this game goes in my favor lol
---
Be happy goddamn it
---
These challenges were honestly not even that difficult for me, the hardest was maybe the Dark sense one but even then I still managed it on the first game
---
I literally let everyone on my team die to complete this. Got 2 messages bitching me out. But like, how else do you expect me to get all the gens done myself? I want that Claudette cosmetic bros
---
Was it the same door?
---
Don't think I don't see that you glorious bastard.
---
Oh bro I was totally kidding in the message I sent you my bad
---
I never said that you said it was? I was stating reasons for changing a perk and that bbq didn‚Äôt meet what I believe are the requirements to change a perk.
---
Yea, console is a whole different demon when it comes to Nurse.
---
I mean some people will dc if their Ruin is destroyed like it‚Äôs physically impossible to even try to play the game if you don‚Äôt have it.
---
No one is ruining the game for anyone. There is no one exact way to play the game
---
Doing gens, you?
---
it resets your level cuz they are too lazy to make it scale to infinity or make it get the same amount after some time
---
you get faster levels and less rewards for a moment now
---
You good Nancy? ‡≤†_‡≤†
---
Were we in the same game?
---
Nea on a pier?
---
I do and you still can‚Äôt see me
---
Brought to you by the Calm Spirit gang
---
No... the exit gates are practically given yo a survivor. If the killer is 60 meters away from a gate then its free.
---
Yea I was hype for this battlepass but the updates after have made the game less enjoyable with the shittiness of dedicated servers. I‚Äôm 38 rn and if I grind to 70 I might never play DBD again lol
---
Right back at ya. Happy holidays!
---
I think it was since I went back to where the gate was at.
---
&gt; Tactics are never toxic.
---
That's wrong, a person can literally be toxic as a tactic to essentially draw aggro and try to tilt the opponent. It can absolutely work and be effective, and still be toxic.
---
In madness 3 you can‚Äôt repair, heal, sabotage, cleanse, mend and use Items the exception is opening hatch with key.
---
They definitely need to make it shorter
---
Or atleast like make the premium pas get an XP boost. It's so untraditional and I pray to god the next Rift is better, or i'm just not even gonna buy it again
---
I‚Äôve personally been PURPOSELY screwed over by so many asshole Claudette‚Äôs that it‚Äôs hard to trust literally any of them anymore. People play her to be completely stealthy/immersed and literally will just hide the entire game. 
---
If you‚Äôve ever seen Noob3‚Äôs video called Getting Chased for 20 minutes, you‚Äôll get the picture. That specific scenario and type of Claudette player you see in his video happens to me entirely too often and it‚Äôs so frustrating. Add that a lot of these people are also toxic assholes who also do it to troll other survivors and it‚Äôs even worse. Also the amount of times I‚Äôve been intentionally sandbagged by a Claudette is significantly higher than any other survivor. 
---
The two characters and the people who play them that I dislike the most are Claudette and The Pig. (Throw Leatherface in there too for obvious reasons.) 
---
More than 90% of the Claudette‚Äôs I encounter are selfish, lazy assholes with the IQ of a bean. And most Pig‚Äôs I encounter the biggest scumbags on earth. 
---
TLDR; shitty people constantly playing her
---
that's what it already is
---
BUT WHERE IS THE LIE.
---
Dedicated servers are gonna come eventually and hopefully fix it
---
Because shes often awful to have on your side as survivor too.
---
In the low ranks especially Claudettes are notorious for hiding in bushes all game and letting everyone else die while they get the hatch.
---
Then there is the fact that they never get seen, tryhards pick her because shes hard to see so the killer will walk up to a gen with both if you on it, and end up only seeing you.
---
And as killer you get the toxic tryhard p3 claudettes who are annoying, or those that hatch camp and you feel bad for the survivors that did try to do gens.
---
Claudette players often come across as the most selfish players
---
This is really good!
---
Just hit the middle ground of ‚ÄúI have a lot of fucking play time‚Äù rather than the 50/50 killer survivor BS. Pretty easy to not get your opinion discredited if you have 1k+ hours
---
Can the Huntress be Misty then?
---
Is it amusing to laugh at a students budget?
---
By the same token, no one is entitled to tell someone else how to share their opinion about the game. Everything here is just opinions: no sharing of opinion is a force or command on anyone else unless they make it so themselves. Sharing your background experience relevant to your opinion is always important for credibility, and that's why people like that generally do it.
---
So I just don't understand why people sharing their credibility and opinion is a problem on a forum designed for discussing strategies in a video game.
---
You can blame BHVR for putting in basement challenges that reward that type of gameplay.
---
She picked it up every time
---
Well in your case Self Care + Botany Knowledge would be essential.
---
I also personally use Spine Chill in every build of mine.
---
Then, you need an exhaustion perk of your choice.
---
Make sure to use Q&amp;Q.
---
Brought to you by the I'm all ears gang
---
Did this with Freddie and everyone Disconnected
---
DS is a over rated bring another perk
---
Can you cleanse without being broken?
---
Iron will is a must. Try it once and you wont be able to play without it.
---
Botany knowledge/self care for healing. Empathy is pretty good. Maybe sprint burst/lithe for your personal safety.
---
Could go empathy, self care, iron will, sprint burst.
---
I was thinking meg was misty, but that works too
---
curiosity?
---
Imo, for games like this you should have easier way to black pip.
---
They also made a movie that made about 300 million dollars last year.
---
Lol jssteer is my psn
---
That is exactly what I mean I am a killer main not survivor. 
---
He needs to be updated as in improved.
---
Because that means BHVR would have to implement something they couldn‚Äôt make money off of, and we all know how much BHVR loves our money.
---
Fancy meeting you here lol
---
Sounds like they've been working years on it.
---
"Uh, I can play how I want. Don't tell me how to play" after facecamping everyone to death
---
I dont dc over it but im not shaming you if you do lol. Especially if you're one of the poor rank 9 killers fighting rank 3 survivors.
---
The only way the 4 gens in one match one is possible is with an SWF who would be willing to 99 all the gens on the map for you to run around and complete all of them.
---
Iron will, empathy, sprint burst, maybe urban evasion or fixated
---
Same story with Michael.
---
Couple of days ago David and I spawn in, run like 10 feet and boom, there‚Äôs Hex Ruin. I peek around a bit, start to walk away, and Spine Chill goes off. David is in a corner so I‚Äôm like, f**k it, we doing this. Crouch behind him, in comes the killer, BODY BLOCK, David still isn‚Äôt done somehow... I make an executive decision, here we go. As I tank the second hit the totem breaks. Well at least Ruin is go-
---
#*EXPOSED*
---
Oh David, you poor sweet prince. He ran, but he didn‚Äôt make it far.
---
David is a top, and Dwight is his bae
---
*Screams in Demodoggo*
---
I somehow managed to complete it while solo-queing against a Plague, but it was hell on Earth.
---
This happened to me before when a survivor was hugging a infinite the whole game. I teabagged him and tunneled him out of basement then he texts me saying ‚Äúget ddos‚Äù and I was kicked out of the game. He said he was gonna boot me offline but I got the evidence of him saying it then reported it. He got banned and never ended up booting me...
---
r/noahgettheboat
---
No it either bugged or was a different gate
---
There is 1 cheeky more kind of Claud players, the shit players who want to be toxic by teabagging at pallets then dying 15 seconds later and farming hooks
---
Nea on the pe-ahhh.. I'm not sure which has the accent that says it like this..
---
bruh the perk is already weak enough, it just regresses ignored gens, it would probably one of the weakest slowdown perk
---
Watch streamers I recommend Otzdarva he is really fun and nice. Live right now too
---
Lmfao that exchange with jeff over the flashlight
---
You definitely don't need either perk.  They're both optional.  Bamboozle isn't really even that good to begin with.  Enduring is solid but I rarely run it these days.
---
Technically true, but given that head on is a 3 second stun, requires much less skill to use effectively, and lockers are *nearly* at every loop, it would make it too viable for what it is, I think. Of course, it would have to be tested to know for sure, though.
---
My pp when I see kate
---
Can you buy your way to level 70? I looked for a way to get BP and XP with money but couldn‚Äôt find it.
---
As another Dwight main I can also confirm
---
I see no reason why I should respect someone with 1k survivor hours over someone with 100 killer hours and 100 survivor hours when talking about killers. 
---
Context is important and often when people say ‚ÄúI have 50/50 time‚Äù they are explaining a lack of bias when giving an opinion in the ‚ÄúX iS tOXic‚Äù ‚Äòdiscussions‚Äô that pop up all the time on this sub. Play time means nothing if you‚Äôre saying NOED or Adrenaline are toxic or whatever.
---
BBQ: Every site on the web
---
Distortion: VPN, nah mate
---
"Hey let me unhook I have BT and Adrenaline"
---
*glances at perks*
---
*no BT, WGLF and plundering perks*
---
[Here](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hatch#Visibility) is all the info you're looking for.
---
It appears whenever the number of completed gens is one greater than the number of living survivors, or if there's only one survivor left. Note that it's always "there", it just only becomes visible when the criteria is met - so if the survivors have a map there's a sporting chance they'll know where it is.
---
If your problem is the last survivor then that usually means there are three repaired gens and two survivors left - so your goal should likely be to prevent them completing three generators. You can't stop the hatch appearing, but it'll even the odds a little.
---
Bear in mind that getting to the hatch first doesn't guarantee you'll get the survivor - there's not shortage of games where the last survivor just sits beside a gate, waiting for the killer to close the hatch and power them, or the double fakeout where they make the killer *believe* they're at a gate, but they've actually got a key and they'll just open the hatch again to escape after you've closed it.
---
I know right kkrakk
---
I‚Äôm in school full time with two jobs.
---
Its nothing to do with how many bloodpoints you got. just emblems
---
Lucky! I had a match where someone else was doing the challenge and left me on basement hook so they could grab the chest. I suicided and enjoyed watching them get immediately found and hooked in the basement.
---
I hope that one extra chest was worth it.
---
Speaking of Noob3, I was actually in one of his videos. It was posted two days ago I believe. I'm the "baby Meg" who he yells at for "not having any presents". It's the video where he's playing as the dude from Stranger Things wearing the Elf costume. Character name is "Evra" in game. You can clearly see I'm bad at the game, lmao.
---
All dlcs that come with a killer, map, and survivor cost 15 dollars, however, you have the ability to buy the survivor or killer for (I think) 5 dollars, dlcs can also be bought for the ingame currency, auric cells , which do cost money, but they can be used for cosmetics, dlcs are never required, though, so if you want to play the game without dlcs, then go ahead, dlcs are used for better perks, new survivors, new killers, etc.
---
Everything is on sale right now on Steam. Also you really only need to buy characters if there‚Äôs ones you want to play as and even then it‚Äôs mostly killers. The default characters are plenty. Look through the DLC listing on steam.
---
Any survivors and killers that aren't licensed you can get in game with shards .
---
Dummy thicc
---
Yoooo that looks amazing holy crap ! good job üëçüëç
---
I play 2 and 4 man with my family. If the Killer is forgiving and really let‚Äôs me know what they need, I will help them with their challenges. We did it all day yesterday. I would go around and hit them with pallets, stand in traps and take hits so my family can finish the gens. I even got lost once somehow and the entity got me in the end. Was still fun though.
---
It gives my family time to practice and get better while I know the killer isn‚Äôt going to kill them.
---
I‚Äôve been playing Freddy and haven‚Äôt got ruin in the bloodweb and I‚Äôm having really good games
---
...pic unrelated?
---
r/okaybu... oh you already posted it there
---
They‚Äôve got them on switch and pc, just not xbox/ps4 yet, hopefully they come soon, but Ive also heard that with dedicated servers comes different problems
---
Replace hangman‚Äôs trick and bloodhound with ruin and bbq
---
they disconnected immediately after going down once. i went over to flashlight save and they disconnected in the killers arms when i had the perfect angle.  this caused me to get chased because i was directly in front of the killer. the next person got knocked and dc-ed. i got chased and got knocked and hooked. the other person got hooked after. this dc stuff is fr annoying as heck.
---
You can't really explain looping over text. Honestly, just watch good survivors on YouTube or Twitch and watch what they do. Looping properly comes with experience, time, and also requires being able to predict a killer's movements. My best advice is learning how to discern between safe and unsafe tiles and just becoming familiar with maps and where certain windows and pallets spawn.
---
This is one of the negative points people brought up when it was announced: it would just turn the game into a grindfest. Whenever somebody said they'd be against the rift for that reason (or others) people would retort "You only dislike it because fortnite has a battle pass"
---
Haha!
---
Been there, makes me sad
---
Kylo Ren is like the least intimidating dark side user. I'd take Vader over him, but that's just me
---
Should an option as some people might think it looks dumb
---
Clown was voiced by Paulie!
---
BHVR's matchmaking uses a +/- 6 rule. The only exception is 16-20, which has no cap to ensure that they still find games.
---
Both sides are equally as toxic
---
My second game ever as killer put me against rank 8s. Spoiler: I did not win.
---
But that's not even *playing* the game, and you're forcing a 3v1. Dick move.
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks, and gives you too hard a time than is worth it at higher ranks. just play for fun. i'm always rank 17 and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ all 4 of them, i just hunt and hit them only if they're not injured. for perks use BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's Calling, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i often repeat to myself, for example, "just do 1 and 3" (referring to whichever survivor from 1-4 at the bottom left). i'd never play any other way.
---
Matchmaking has been weird and bad lately. If you‚Äôre not having fun, definitely take a break and come back later (hours, days, weeks, whichever).
---
It‚Äôs fine, match making has sucked for a while. Just focus on leveling up and getting all your perks in order.
---
Freddy is a pretty damn good killer so ruin is pretty overkill
---
don't worry they're from commiefornia, everything costs more there.
---
Yah I can‚Äôt wait till it hits consoles, this constant dc bs from pussy survivors is getting tiresome. They need to make it 5mins for the first offense then 15mins for the second and 24hr for the third.
---
DCing in general is not a happy thing, it feels wrong, like it goes against the rules and flow of the game. needless to say
---
At least I gave him a purple medkit! Amirite?
---
People would probably hate her more if they could find her
---
It‚Äôs okay to be tilted but your experience isn‚Äôt universal. You‚Äôre just unlucky. Take a break, come back once you‚Äôve recharged.
---
DS and borrowed are not 2nd chance perks, They are chance perks. If the killer is tunneling, you stand no chance, those give you a chance.
---
Deliverance can be taken out before its even in play, and even then its hardly a 2nd chance if at all. 
---
Fucking dead hard? are you kidding? 
---
Adrenaline isnt a 2nd chance, its a reward for doing your objective, as most people who say NOED is find would say. "they only had 3 perks, so its ok"
---
Actually, causing pressure is exactly what you should do? If you are playing a good killer, and you are a good player, you will get downs and kills. 
---
take infectious fright billy for example, it has no effects on gens by itself, but it gives you so much map pressure it halts gens almost completely
---
I like light mode...
---
You win.
---
You would have to buy the aura cells
---
I like to stand over them, then proceed to half set traps. It's the closest to bagging them back I can get without playing GF :(
---
No one knows more than you about when the next patch will be released.
---
Don‚Äôt forget all the Claud‚Äôs who DC the moment they hit the ground because they thought they were blending in.
---
SB, empathy, botany, pharmacy/self care/solidarity
---
Yeahhhh, the biggest problem I have with it is after people have DC'd once or twice they'll just kill themselves on first hook, which really fucks survivorscause they basically DC'd let's be honest.
---
Plus a lot of things like getting stuck in shit still happens and then the game just dropping you out randomly does too, I am happy for the DC thing being put in but I'd like a bit more polish and thought for it you know
---
;)
---
MY NAME IS... GYOUBU MASATAKA ONIWA!

AS I BREATHE, YOU WILL NOT PASS THE CASTLE GATE!
---
Nope, just was lucky nobody dc and had a good basement game with trapper, where they kept going for saves while being injured.
---
 a lot
---
Grave digging, but it depends on the game. PUBG, for example, had terrible lagswitching. You could unplug your internet cable, run around and kill 4 people, then plug it back in and they would all be dead. And PUBG isn't peer to peer.
---
I was in a SWF and my friend got caught right at the exit gate (we all expected to make it out unharmed). My friend on the ground told us to just go because of the timer but in a split second decision, I decided to slip by the Plague out the doorway so I wouldn‚Äôt be forced out. Improvising, I realized cleansing would heal me and decided to go for it even though the timer was ticking down. All my friends were saying to just get out and that I wouldn‚Äôt get the save in time but I felt so determined. This was definitely the best adrenaline rush this game has ever given me and one of my finest moments for sure!
---
Omitting mentioning the fact that either job is part or full time. Point is, spending that much for internet in my current state is a luxury. Your sense of humor is poor, but that's ironic mentioning poor in my case :)
---
Happy holidays to you too. Also good cosplay.
---
Where do you spend them to get BP or CP?
---
hope this gets implemented
---
That doesn't make sense when the change I'm proposing has zero impact on game balance. It's entirely based around perk variety and reducing the grind.
---
Yep, he nailed it :3
---
I got facecamped 3 times in a row but thought nothing of it because I made myself stay in the game as long as possible to make everyone else escape. Sure I got facecamped, but the Killer De-pip'd and I call that win.
---
Secondly, Myers is not the most OP, neither is he the most OP tunneler.
---
Yes please detect my aura with your perks 
---
Brought to you by the distortion gang
---
I agree. I‚Äôm completely fine with keeping it at 3 seconds anyway
---
Why change a perk if it‚Äôs not terrible or overpowered? Why even change BBQ if they increase blood points anyway?
---
I don‚Äôt even have the ruin teachable and I can‚Äôt be bothered to get it.
---
If they don‚Äôt immediately leave when you approach, it‚Äôs more BPs for you. If they do, then you get what you wanted.
---
Only thing I can think is he was proposing a "Sandbag Olympics" split into teams of two.
---
After a certain amount of time, a developer trial will be held
---
Healing yourself is a waste of time, just bring a medkit for yourself. As for team healing, if you unhook a lot use We'll Make It, if not, use Botany Knowledge.
---
Build should be Adrenaline, Botany Knowledge/We'll Make It, Dead Hard and Iron Will.
---
Posted 5 hours ago, on the frontpage, no comments ... Interesting.
---
Usually happens when ruin is popped 30 seconds into the match.
---
I think the devs are scared to have premium pass bonuses since its already a paid game some people will say its pay to win, (even tho you'd only get Iri shards, they can still buy perks in the shrine) I think the best solution would be to reduce the XP needed to get a rift shard by 25%ish, since most passes give a 50% XP bonus so instead of 800 xp youd need 600 xp to get a rift cell, rather than increase the XP you get
---
Thanks for the heads up blkb7
---
Just type Luminous DBD on YouTube and you'll see her content.
---
Same I wanted to try Billy for my daily challenge and all of them had flashlights and were 8s and 4s
---
B o n k
---
Do think it looks stupid and wouldn't want it forced on me but I don't see how this would be more powerful than just using a headset so I'm all for this as an accessibility option.
---
Your error is assuming that the XP rate was designed with the intent to get everyone to 70 without buying ranks. Why else do you think you only end up with 850 cells at 70 when the premium pass is 1000?
---
Meh, agree to disagree.
---
I think it's more cause survivors wanna fuck killers out of their challenges
---
Thanks! :D
---
Well that's definitely part of it. Especially the basement challenge
---
I sort of agree as I hate when people prioritize heir rank over everything else. Personally I just play the game and whatever my rank is, it is. But there does need to be separation between seasoned players and newbies. Because the lifespan of the game will suffer if newer players don‚Äôt have a new window to be introduced into. If new players jump in and get demolished right away because they got paired with more skilled players it‚Äôll discourage them to keep playing. So for that, having a ranking system is a good thing.
---
I think the better suggest is that it works like devour - after x hooks the killer can mori anyone
---
I‚Äôm a solo survivor rank 1 and that still happens haha
---
seems like an attention grab
---
Ohh alright I was hoping someone knew some inside info or something. I just grew impatient.
---
Wrong. You get all 1,000 cells back as long as you reach rank 68.
---
Sadly knowing how behavior is neither of them are probably going to receive and more changes for awhile. I mean look how long it‚Äôs been since pigs late game nerf and outside of giving her stealth undetectable they haven‚Äôt done anything with her problems
---
Dude go complain about Activision or Epic Games if you want to whine about greedy companies. None of the Archives challenges are locked behind a paywall (meaning you can play all the way up to the final tier and then buy it if you want), original characters are always available to purchase with iridescent shards, even licensed characters‚Äô perks rotate in and out of the shrine for no money outta your pocket.
---
The only thing you‚Äôre forced to pay for that impacts gameplay is licensed killers, and even then DLC‚Äôs go on sale like once every 2 months. If you don‚Äôt want to buy cosmetics, then don‚Äôt, but you look stupid saying that BHVR only does things they can make money off of when they constantly listen to community feedback and improve their game accordingly. 
---
If you had to pay money for the menu backgrounds, or the different chase music, or the menu animations, or any of the other cool little things they‚Äôve continued to add when we respond positively to them, then I‚Äôd agree with you. Only problem is, they constantly do plenty of stuff for us at no additional cost simply because we thought it was cool.
---
Oh okay üòÇ I thought it was something newer lol
---
The chainsaw should instakill on down too
---
Lucky you, none of my friends play this game. They don't know games outside of Call of Duty exist.
---
One step ahead
---
My computer was broken for two weeks and now I'm only on level 50. Someone save me.
---
Yeah it really sucks, I wouldnt mind a full chapter addressing all these problems and bugs. They have a lot of money now too the company and the game is growing.
---
Because making fun of someone using memeatic is now a meme in it's self so...
---
Lol this was made with memeatic noob
---
It wasn't a bug. The game was recording the xp you got from a decent bit before tome released, and when it started that xp was put into rift levels.
---
Dope editing, really enjoyed watching this !
---
I play a mobile game called Identjty V, the devs worked with bhvr to make it last summer, so it‚Äôs the same basic idea. We have a killer called the architect who is the killer with nearly absolute map knowledge. I have way to many hours in IDV but I‚Äôm a total noob to dbd so with the difference between the games he might be insanely op here. 
---
He has consoles set up all around the map, and he can use them to access these monitors above the map looking down. He can also use them to create temporary fences that do the same damage as half a normal hit if they hit a survivor. There is a limit on energy for each monitor (they each have a limited range but together they cover nearly the entire map) and survivors can use the consoles access only the monitor associated with that console and they can spend the energy. As a killer he is the easiest to loop in the entire game because his kit focuses on doing damage from a distance.
---
Like I said I don‚Äôt have much experience in dbd but how strong do you think a killer like him would be in dbd. In Identity V he is one of the strongest killers (and the second hardest to master)
---
I play for 1-2 hours a day with a friend or two.  Currently level 65.  It's possible but I assume as a solo, it's going to be harder.
---
You are an awful person.
---
I‚Äôm just saying BHVR is starting to act like epic and activism on with all this battle pass shit. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I have all the dlc and the battle pass but that doesn‚Äôt mean that I can‚Äôt call them out. Yes they have released all of the maps for free but the problem is that this game is going downhill. We will never have another even Bc the devs have stated that they are gonna our then all into the rift. The problem with the shrine is that it‚Äôs mostly shitty perks and if you want any reliable way to get a certain perk you have to buy the associated character. That being said I still enjoy the game but these practices can still be criticized. This game has been out for over 3 years and there‚Äôs been no priority to add color blind support or support for those hard of hearing. Without these it makes it almost unbearable to play killer as the gen auras are red which are very hard to see as a color blind person. The only ‚Äúfix‚Äù they have added was discordance which isn‚Äôt even a fix, it‚Äôs another perk behind a pay wall.
---
The whole reason for being 3rd person in general as survivor is to know where the killer is coming from. Having the perspective in 1st person would make head on unusable as the killer could just get out of your LoS and yoink you out of the locker before you can react.
---
Because they can't loop, so the concept of ever staying injured is ludicrous to them.
---
They make you earn about 35 that way through the course of normal game play. The Rift only gives you enough fragments for 35 levels+/-. You get 1 fragment for you first killer match and 1 for you first survivor match. After that you get 2 fragments for roughly three matches. You can do one level a day, he has plenty of time to complete.
---
Yeah, but if you had an XP bonus youd get iridescent shards which can be used to get perks from the shrine, which Is why i said it should have been a reduction of XP needed to get a rift cell
---
That would mean that there would be no matchmaking that means a new player can come with everyone and a 2 years experience player can come with everyone to that would just be unfair
---
I swear they recently broke matchmaking more. Consistently I'm seeing yellows mixed in with purples and reds. I guess matches are faster, but it feels like rank doesn't even exist anymore.
---
PS4: gamebreaking lag spikes when receiving bloodlust
---
It's some problems but I can say that on PC and mobile it's not as bad as it is on Xbox and would rather the dedicated servers were on all platforms
---
Body blocking is toxic. The game even has that as a reportable offense. Even though it's pointless to report someone.
---
Yes you can, and there's a special place in Hell for those that do it lol.
---
This hurts
---
I have no solution. But to punish people for being human is overboard.
---
It‚Äôll be interesting to see how this all plays out if permanently implemented.
---
FYI fwiw: i been playing like 4 hours today and I didn‚Äôt DC once as killer or survivor. But some days I have those days where I will.
---
Because just cause youre knowledgeable doesn't mean you get to tell others how to play the game. You're aloud to voice your opinion however you please I never said you couldn't, but if you wanna treat your opinion as fact and tell others how to play the game they paid for just cause you play both sides then you're an ass.
---
I honestly don't care too much because they can't get distance if they're teabagging. On the other hand, a survivor flashlight flickering as they run away is always fun.
---
That first kick from Clown killed me. I wish that was an option in game when you get flashlight clicked.
---
*click* *click* *click* *click* *click* BOOT
---
I think what he means is the close up when Yui‚Äôs face is just like ‚Äúwho tf is this‚Äù
---
$15? Mine are $8 except for stranger things which was $12. Also the maps are free and many killers/survivors can be earned for free
---
This is where the importance of getting first game of the day for each side comes in clutch.
---
Since each bonus is 300 xp, you'll get nearly 800 xp for an average game with it (300 bonus+ 400-500 base xp for a standard game). So almost 2 rift fragments every day for 70 days = 140 fragments or 14 tiers. Obviously it could be a little less or little more depending on your play time.
---
Adrenaline still gives you a speed boost. Better run Inner Strength to ensure maximum uselessness.
---
I mean to be fair, the only purple rank is running No Mither.
---
Because people with 1,000 hours have 10x as much experience. I‚Äôm not saying the number of hours you have defines your knowledge, I‚Äôm saying it does hold some weight in conversation over the basic ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 50/50‚Äù because that‚Äôs used to justify their opinion whereas hours gives you a larger plane of perspective.
---
All DLC that comes with 1 character is $5 (Leatherface, Ash)
---
All DLC that comes with 2 characters is $8 (All other DLC)
---
All DLC that comes with 3 characters is $12 (Stranger Things)
---
No single DLC is $15
---
You get 1 fragment for you first killer match and 1 for you first survivor match. After that you get 2 fragments for roughly three matches. You can do one level a day, you have plenty of time to complete. The Rift only gives you enough for 35 Tiers +/-.
---
better fix than this is to split the queue between people that dc and people who don't dc with pip quotas before you can get to the normal queue. also add escape quotas for survivors and 4k quotas for killers to get out of the dc queue. normal players get to enjoy the game as intended and people who dc get's like minded people to grief over as well.
---
and forced struggle for survivors in second phase must be a thing that way they can't deny altruism for team mates and buy a little more time for survivors but this would deny other people from the hatch.
---
Edit: or better yet dc counts as altruism for survivors (except if you partied together or are friends) and for killers gives progress and blood points equal to how many hooks they had left (except if they are friends).
---
Console killer definitely has a lot of trouble. Not being able to flick your camera fast has a lot of big disadvantages.
---
One tip I play on xbox I started 5-6 months ago and the matchmaking here at the beginning as killer is so god as survivor ok and normal ok I would say that the xbox has the best matchmaking.
---
Magic
---
Michael most OP killer? Funny.
---
I‚Äôm literally level 12
---
Gen rushing is just playing the game. Unpopular opinion: So is tunnelling
---
The killer shouldn't have to be less effective so you enjoy the game, they're supposed to play brutally.
---
Nea on a Marina?
---
My point is if you‚Äôre ‚Äúbullying‚Äù a Nurse it‚Äôs because she isn‚Äôt good at Nurse, and you can‚Äôt blame a survivor for being better than a killer. Why would I not take advantage of a killer I can consistently blind if I know it‚Äôs going to waste a lot of her time? I didn‚Äôt bring a flashlight to NOT use it.
---
that would be great, specially for killers that need lots of practice such as nurse, billy or oni
---
Toxic Fock on a Dock?
---
You could always fade it out and draw blood orbs surrounding him?
---
I didn't even play scummy (I never do). Just to make it clear, this is NOT for witchhunting purposes just a Discussion about disconnecting players.
---
I run Spine Chill, Empathy (to track Killer), Dark Sense and Prove Thyself
---
Is this a new world where perspective is gained better by time than multiple perspectives? Both are good. You‚Äôre ignoring the Crux of my argument. Context.
---
Edit: and in my scenario there is a difference of 5x hours of experience.
---
You cannot play Dead By Daylight without trying both sides at least once, that‚Äôs why the ‚Äú50/50‚Äù is pointless to mention. Guess it‚Äôs personal preference, but I‚Äôm more likely to be persuaded by a ‚Äúveteran‚Äù than someone who‚Äôs played both sides equally, they‚Äôve seen more bullshit.
---
I‚Äôd love to see a cinematic between more survivors, like the previous animation :)
---
YES! dull totems *really* need a reason to be cleansed. right now having only TWO perks affected by them is ridiculous.
---
Yeah but with this logic you're expecting 4 other people to suffer and have their game thrown because you dont want to deal with an annoying match yourself. The needs of the few are outweighed by the needs of the many
---
BUT WHY BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY
---
Because no one cares
---
Yeah, a little oversight on my part
---
Myers? OP? Haha only in my hands.
---
His flesh should be more green
---
That looks amazing already. The finished product is gonna look stunning I just know it!
---
Lol add me on psn to run some games later
---
All I heard from it that pig is now one of the weakest and was one of the strongest on reales and honestly that just changes like nothing the dbd community so often think that killers are only strong with certain perk builds it only changed endgame so they wanna tell me they played pig just because of endgame just use noeds+bloodenwaren that pisses me so off the community even said the same about legion he was buffed and the community saw it as a nerf or oni one fricking add on nerf= he is nothing worth anymore
---
I can only assume that the survivor just always runs with it. Can't really change perks once you get in game.
---
Really strange build. I'm a Rank 1 killer and wouldn't use any of these perks on any killer. I'd rather play perkless than this. Wouldn't be surprised if the killer got flamed in post chat for being a 'baby killer GG ez'.
---
That is for dad mike do decide
---
Is this dbd on mobile didn't even know that this existed
---
Just censor the names moving forward instead of putting up the disclaimer.  That way it truly won't be about witchunting.
---
I made it to purple last season as killer.
---
Got reset to 9 and lost about 7-8 pips because I would consistently be matched with ranks 4-6
---
It is intentional. His lunge is designed with his weapon literally being his hands. Kinda like Hag his lunge just carried him forward more.
---
You do know this is a meme targeting a specific type of person right? Also not my post.
---
It would be nice for the Devs to add deaf/colourblind modes, but they won't. It's work, it requires research, you cannot monetize without admitting you're money-hungry villains, and at the end of the day it will probably be heavily abused like SWF was and is (I dont think that's a reason not to add them, but I bet it will be the Devs official statement if they ever release one).
---
Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Decisive Strike and Borrowed Time
---
I agree! 
---
I think it is super interesting when we see the survivor and killer interactions through lore and not just in gameplay. I wish when Clown &amp; Kate's trailer was revealed it had something more similar to actual confrontation and not just the sound of the glass breaking at the end and Kate being like "HUH?"
---
I'd love to see the trailers be a little longer and show either something like this (the first interaction) or them being chased by the killer or mid trial (like with the legion).
---
Imagine hitting trees every 2seconds (this was made by the leather boi gang)
---
hag and trapper dont need to chase to scare either
---
trapper your always paranoid of a damn trap
---
hag...hag need i say more?
---
That is such an inane statement I'm almost wondering if you're trolling.
---
You DC regularly, and the majority of your reasons are selfish. You regularly fuck up other people's trials in a game absolutely plagued by extraordinarily long queue times. The devs are in the right by giving people like you a harder time doing this.
---
Funny because about two days ago I ran into a face camping Ghostface
---
Imagine eating rocks and cutting it with a chainsaw (made from the leather boi gang)
---
‚ÄúYO! Who the hell triggered the endgame?!‚Äù  ü§£
---
Yes, thats just an gamemode idea
---
Cmon man he stalk boi ;-;
---
Thanks for the information, but I am not that forward in editing, in future posts I will do it. Promise ;\]
---
This challenge was so hard I was so thankful when the last survivor didn't wiggle and I could bring him to the basement and survivor challange escape as claudette wow killer challange:kill everyone at one hook station survivor challange:escape with one perk and no items(if you didn't level claudette)
---
Focus more on healing others and doing objectives and less about healing yourself.  Self Care is pretty much what's being hinted at here and it's a God awful perk that loses teams games.  
---
If you absolutely can't help yourself and feel the need to be fully healed all the time than at least do it in a way that helps the team like Inner Strength or just use medkits.
---
Merry Christmas. This meme is amazing. Take my silver ‚ô•Ô∏è.
---
You can earn rift fragments through playing normally without completing challenges. I got to Level 70 over a month ago lol
---
What was it like before?
---
Well they buffed legion along with the nerfs and the reason the nerf to Oni was bad wasn‚Äôt the add on nerf they nerf the flick that could be done on pc, which took down his effectiveness in almost all loops. The add on nerf had nothing to do with it 
---
Also I played when pig was released and most people said she was alright, I don‚Äôt remember anyone saying she was the strongest ever
---
Imagine having to catch your humans to eat instead of just eating rocks. Made by Hillbilly gang
---
Thank God those days were over old DS was imo the most broken unfair survivor perk.
---
Yea legions trailer was really good. The fact that the pretend survivor was actually a killer was a good idea
---
Matters what they‚Äôre playing on. Console has no chat so u can‚Äôt ask the killer to do so
---
god i wish that were my swfs
---
Nea. Nea wins 90% of the time. A good looper (or 4) is the bane of Billy's existence
---
So you're just a cunt, got it.
---
Trapper meh ,I kinda see what you are saying with hag
---
When you close the hatch, the exit gates open to give the remaining survivor a chance at escaping.
---
Nancy got the knife in the end. We are all dead.
---
Thats some next level BS
---
Dbd isnt going downhill, its always in the Top 10-15 on Twitch(even above Minecraft, Overwatch or Wow)
---
In the Top 20 on steam and gets amazing License deals like Stranger Things, we finally got Servers which (most of the time) allow to finally play the game without much lag
---
I‚Äôll have you know I hit yellow ranks on both survivor and killer and I didn‚Äôt even have to try.
---
Clown: Let me see what you have
---
Nancy: A KNIFE
---
Clown: *nO*
---
Beat me to it
---
Except the strength of Spirit wasn't mentioned. The issues with bugs, however, *were* mentioned. Read all the way through a comment before responding. You responded to something that wasn't even put forward.
---
Lmao that was me trying to get the 4 pallet stuns in 1 game challenge. I put on super bright clothes, changed my name to "need to use pallets", and clicked flashlights at killers at pallets until one of them finally decided to be friendly and let me get my 4 stuns in.
---
I play on xbox so never heard about it but I think its you could basically  dash throgh corners and the dbd community raged so harded because they fixed a bug sigh
---
Bruh if you were selling this id buy it
---
He is yes, the question is which gang does he swear his loyalty to? Teabag gang or Stalking gang
---
No, it doesnt have to do anything with luck
---
Fucking glorious mate. GG
---
Yes, you are ruining it for all other players involved. Nobody enjoys a 3v1. It's not fun, and is quite literally a bannable offense. There is not "one exact way" but there is general rules you are supposed to follow (according to the developers of the game, not reddit) 
---
One such example would be ragequiting. The dev's deem this action unacceptable, and as such have started to implement a DC penalty. Another example would be holding the game hostage. For example a killer body blocking 2 or more survivors into a corner and refusing to hit them. These are actions that technically the game allows you to perform, but even still the devs have deemed them unacceptable.
---
Intentionally being afk just to farm BP and rift tier absolutely 100% falls into this category of possible but unacceptable. The world doesn't revolve around you. It is not ok to ruin the game for everyone else so that you can be lazy and selfish.
---
From all of us who try to make the game enjoyable for everyone, kindly fuck off sir (or ma'am)
---
It's limited use makes it a debatable perk and there are far stronger clutch perks such as DS, Unbreakable, Adrenaline, ect
---
Yeah all these kids derank because they want to bully new players it pathetic. 
---
It‚Äôs constant at lower ranks. I feel your pain.
---
Kids with all purple perks t bagging at pallets and looping killers. Like yeah mate you just start playing.
---
Keep your head up. Don‚Äôt let it get you down. If they start any crap just leave.
---
1 hour a day since the beginning of the rift is actually enough to get to rank 70 way before the rift ends (assuming you‚Äôre also completing all rift challenges). The problem is not everyone can play every single day, and some people don‚Äôt *want* to play every single day, and also some people can‚Äôt finish some of the harder challenges. I think the fix for this is either offering more rift fragments per challenge or increasing the amount of XP you gain per match so you get them faster naturally. Nothing crazy, the smallest boost in numbers can tip the balance in favor of more casual players.
---
Well. He has a beard, a long hair, he's looking after others (if his perk after care is any indication), he's artistic and metal. Personally that tics a lot of boxes for me to be super attracted.
---
I‚Äôve seen plenty of Legacy players (legit ones) run only No Mither or other bullshit builds or simply none at all just because they are beyond caring. The game is only fun for them when they‚Äôre memeing.
---
It's a little annoying that completing every challenge isn't enough to complete the rift pass
---
Did you face ghostface
---
You're either a troll or you really are having trouble understanding what I'm proposing. I'm not trying to be rude, but I don't feel like I've explained it poorly. I'll give it one more shot because I really do think it would make the game better, and getting the community on board is part of making it happen.
---
The devs have talked about how there is a balance in the bloodpoint economy that they don't like to disrupt; it's the reason they don't do double bloodpoint events more often. So it creates a conundrum: on the one hand, players (and statistics) have made it clear that the grind to unlock things in this game really is moderately time consuming, and easing that grind is welcome; on the other hand, the devs don't want to lessen the grind too much, because it's part of the incentive to keep playing the game.
---
The catch is BBQ and Chili, and to an extent, We're Gonna Live Forever. The devs have clearly factored those perks into the game, and decided that the BP economy is still healthy with those perks, but that even more bloodpoints is not. This leads to players taking BBQ every game, because to not take BBQ is to immensely slow down how fast you unlock things. WGLF is the same, but is less popular due to the fact that it has *literally* no in game benefit.
---
This means that the devs are not *going* to increase the bloodpoints you earn by default, as long as BBQ exists currently. Players would earn too much, and it would interrupt the economy.
---
However, if you *take the extra bloodpoints off of BBQ*, there is *room* for the devs to increase the base bloodpoints.
---
So, let's go back over this; devs are happy with current economy, but players take BBQ almost every game. Take bonus economy off of BBQ, and add it to the default economy that everyone gets every single match. BBQ no longer grants extra economy, and players can decide whether to take it or a different perk based on in game merits.
---
Even simpler:
---
Healthy Economy= Base Bloodpoints (100%) + Offerings (100%) + Events (100%) + BBQ and WGLF (100%)= 400%.
---
If BBQ and WGLF becomes (0%), you can increase Base Bloodpoints to (200%), leading to the *same overall value* (400%), but players achieve that 400% without being forced into BBQ every single match.
---
Does this make sense?
---
Maybe so, but you‚Äôre the one crying about bad players losing vs good players? Just get stomped and hope matchmaking doesn‚Äôt fuck you. It‚Äôs not like in this scenario I‚Äôd delay generator progression to bully the killer longer. Would you rather I as a survivor play immersed so this Nurse gets 0 experience vs better players? Isn‚Äôt that how you advance as a player? Playing vs people better than you?
---
Basically if you don‚Äôt like someone flashing you in the face repeatedly, catch them
---
I‚Äôd sooner take the advice of one of those than someone who only plays 50% of the game and is biased toward that side.
---
Uninstall and reinstall maybe?
---
Oi. Huntress. Why don't you use that nasty body of yours to go make us some money?
---
*Ghostface gets exposed*
---
*Sea Shanty 2 plays*
---
BBQ and Chili, Corrupt Intervention, STBFL, PGTW
---
We really don't need more bloodweb clutter. I hate finishing a match and then being forced to spend the little bloodpoints we get in map offerings and no mist addons for survivors.
---
Just die on hook. Killer gets way less points theybwould have during a normal game and no dc penalty for you
---
It doesn't???
---
Kind‚Äôve ironic because half of the legion are girls
---
This has nothing to do with the post but how did you get the perks to look like that
---
&gt;At least we finally have punishments. I don't think they're harsh enough, but at least they exist. IMO it should also take your item.
---
First of all, the DC punishment test is over for the time being (ended on 19th).
---
Secondly, we always had DC punishments but it was too forgiving because it was aimed at chronic derankers.
---
One a quarter, ~90 days to complete 70 levels.
---
This felt like a job after the 2nd level. I reached 70 last night, 12/20.
---
Sc isn't bad "pros" maybe say that but as solo survivor its a must healing without a teammate is realy god "YoU cAn JuSt BrInG a MeDkIt" wow what rather replacing a item spott for 1-4 fast heals or one perk spott for unlimited slow heals?
---
At least he respected the 4%. You had BT, and I think that works if you unhook yourself anyways so you would've been safe, but still funny.
---
True but that won‚Äôt stop these assholes from dcing like assholes
---
Iri head got a killer nerf. One fucking hatchet man, you‚Äôre forced to use up an add on slot on extra hatchets. And NOED has been changed so many times, it‚Äôs in a perfectly fine spot right now like we really still complaining about noed??
---
That‚Äôs how end game collapse works
---
1 rank outside the expected -6+6 range.
---
*bHvR fIx MaTcHmAKiNg PlEaSe.*
---
No, happens with any killer.
---
The issue is is that they‚Äôd have to make an AI for every map, bots can‚Äôt loop, and the two clashing would probably be infinite so
---
That's exactly how "battle passes" are designed, to make sure you keep playing.
---
I'm a Rank 1 Spirit (2k hrs) only player and encourage you to continue playing her. One of the best ways to learn is to practice with a friend following them in phase. Try to predict survivor movement and cut them off. Spirit can easily 4k with no perks or add-ons even vs Red ranks (not against a strong 4 man SWF but definitely against average players).
---
Only in a few regions and by approval only once you sign up on the site* seemingly. I've been trying to get in (US) for a few months now to no avail
---
People will hate her less now that BL got nerfed
---
who made the art?
---
Let‚Äôs cross the bots - maybe they are impossible to adjust for each map . Just being there by ur self should be enough

Yeah unfortunately I don't have the Scream for Myers setup yet :/ but I'm 285/300 now and once I get this I swear I'm never playing him again lol
---
I think you are on my side, still I have to say being mad doesnt give you the right, I waited for the day they got punishments for that, I am happy they did it. (no offense with this comment)
---
I followed this video https://youtu.be/-9JA7o4r0As and used this http://www.mediafire.com/file/engx4gxm8wtlsbh/Geistra%2527s_Sky_Pack_2.0.zip/file fan made pack.

Four friends chilling in the basement, Six feet apart cause they're not gay
---
lol! He tried to throw the pallet down but interacted with the totem as you attacked instead. Talk about bad luck.
---
Or make it so we can have more than one active at once
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs one of spirits main counters
---
Yeah I‚Äôm a killer main it‚Äôs quiet frustrating when I take 15 minutes to find a match and the last survivor I need to hang for the challenge dc‚Äôsüòî
---
It took me a while to figure that out haha. I didn't even see the totem cleansing animation before I picked him up!
---
The DC penalty test is over. It ended on 19th
---
Thanks fam, I thought that since I really like playing Nurse I'd try Spirit too. I enjoy playing Spirit and will definitely practice her more.
---
Oni especially
---
While the survivor part makes sense, I don't think this has anything to do with the pig. She is from the SAW franchise and while first I don't think a licensed character is going to play a role in the lore, she also doesn't have a financial motivation like the person in this lore bit. She also doesn't have a farm or a savings account as the pig is a former heroin addict. Also there are no traps of any sort involved.
---
True true
---
You guys are still trying? Give up on that grid
---
so i can work my ass off to get to 100
---
then i can reset to get there faster for bad prizes
---
give me like a token for 1 free cosmetic or like 1k shards because thats just shitty

---
Pretend you're a farming bubba
---
Ok thats true I never watched saw and you're points are right but I think that the two characters are unrelated exept for one part there both unknown npc
---
I love fun. That's why I hate anime
---
Go to currently playing with, vola
---
Right because you see two ultra rares directly next to each other when they are supposed to spawn at the end every day...
---
I mean I would not consider him unplayable. His ability to injure many survivors can be really useful against lower skilled players who are not comfortable about staying injured and waste time being injured.
---
It also does shorten chase times and makes saves for survivors significantly harder if they are injured.
---
If you are comfortable with playing with a normal M1 killer the majority of the game then he is definitely a decent choice.
---
You will get a good amount of BP playing him from his power. 
---
My build with him is;
---
M &amp; A, Ruin, Pop &amp; BBQ.
---
M &amp; A works decently well with him since it gives survivors less time to react to you and can be confusing for survivors during a chase.
---
Im all ears might be handy as it can allow you to mind-game loop tiles better which is even more effective if you can insta-down the survivor.
---
Blood Echo might see some use on him.
---
Good luck with him if you plan on playing him. Good survivors will take advantage of your Frenzy but if you just want to play casually then hes a good choice.
---
They need to make it so that you can do multiple challenges not select 1 at a time it takes way too long
---
Again, you're just a cunt, got it.
---
If you can't see what wrong with being a serious asshole, then maybe you should reflect on why people might think you're an asshole.
---
Dude this is amazing
---
I play killer for points. Most I've got is 83,000 with Michael once. Billy If no one DC's and no offerings is around 30,000-45,000
---
Imma brave boy!
---
-Jake gets moried
---
Ain't brave enough for this shit!
---
It would save you 1k Bloodpoints to buy a brown flashlight over aregular one if they were made real, letting you go that much further in the web
---
Is the nat type of you or you're friend the worst? If yes then its because of that(I think) and if no then idk
---
#swf
---
Playing killer is terrible. I have a good connection but survivors occasionally teleport, sometimes I grab a survivor when they are leaving a locker but it doesn‚Äôt go through cuz they jumped back in. Sometimes I search the locker and then get head-oned from said locker. If you‚Äôre playing killer for 4 hours a day, you‚Äôll notice them a lot
---
On survivor, not many issues
---
Huh?
---
This is amazing!
---
Its not super common but it happens
---
Play bubba with agitation, iron grasp, and insidious. You'll feel dirty after. Also hope noone DCs.
---
Good point. But she looks more of a corpse now.
---
Imagine your name being used to define a redneck poor guy in the Southwest "the hillbilly" (This was made by a leather face gang member)
---
This post was made by anti-meme gang...
---
Ok, on a serious note I do agree. Memes are fun and all but I come here mostly for discussions and news.
---
Finally some good fucking perks
---
Combing perks such as Iron Grasp and Agitation will usually allow you to carry survivors into the basement. 
---
Killer wise perhaps Hag or Trapper as both killers have an amazing basement defense which will usually work well for allowing you to hook survivors in the basement.
---
God thanks I play on xbox cause im killer main
---
It‚Äôs just a playstyle, one I‚Äôd rather face as killer over an immersed Blendette. At least then I‚Äôm playing Dead by Daylight and not hide and seek. Stay mad though, I‚Äôm just trying to have fun.
---
Oh, someone said on this subreddit that it worked with deliverance so I figured it would work without it.
---
This is so fuckin smart, I love it. Gave me a nice laugh
---
Most accurate guess i've seen on this post.
---
And 23 Utility Belts to go with them!
---
The stranger things dlc has the most characters and it's only with real money available so if you like the characters go ahead buy the dlc
---
The hatch couldnt be closed and there was no EGC. A survivor had to find the hatch before the killer or try to finish the remaining gens before using the exit gate. The killer would have to wait at the hatch and basically stand on top of it. If the survivor tried to jump in the hatch, the killer could grab them (like grabbing from a locker) and hook them. Survivors would then try to bait a hit out before jumping in. So killers would just not hit.
---
Basically, each side had to wait for the other to crack. There was no time limit, so a killer's only chance to 4k was to literally wait possibly forever for the survivor to jump in. Many killers would just go afk. Tricky killers would *look* afk. It was alot of killer head shaking and survivor emote spam.
---
It was boring and frustrating for both sides.
---
Run AGI + IG, play normally and basement hook survivors when they are on death hook. Hope for a small map or burn an offering.
---
Really love the whole rotting corpse vibe for the birthday party
---
I can remember the first time I got 5 stack devour hope and mori‚Äôd everyone. It was fucking amazing
---
Challenge done with a wrong build
---
Tl;dr: get a good map
---
Nah you can get some really sweaty SWF groups.  All 4 with Adrenaline, DS, 1 person with Object of Obsession giving info to the other 3, one with Borrowed for the unhooks, 1 with a key...  Etc.
---
They're not usually that sweaty but I've played against teams like that a handful of times.
---
It's $11 though
---
Am I missing the rhyme?
---
Angry Ghostface Breathing
---
Ghost boi said both
---
Then why did you reply in the first place? When I said "I don't get the joke," I was saying that it wasn't funny. And it was relevant, we had a discussion about the post concept.
---
At least you get level quicker as well now
---
I personally don‚Äôt see it as an issue. I always have a few (teen) thousands lying around collecting dust
---
Camping is fine once generators are done, especially if it's after the endgame collapse has started (Meaning at least 1 door is open.)
---
Other dlc with 2 charachters are around 10$ too
---
Laughs in not pc/switch
---
I play on XBox, msg killer all the time. Recent players.
---
Lol yeah this has happened to me a couple times, I go to flashlight save someone and the killer ends up mori'ing them in front of my face while I run away scared shitless
---
For me self care is the only reason i survive some trials
---
mettle of man is lowkey my favorite perk right now. I know it‚Äôs still really bad but it‚Äôs so fun when you actually get it to work
---
Really? The percentage of a chance of a silent skill check isn't luck? Well I'll be damned I've been wasting a perk
---
Atleast that‚Äôs how I feel, and from prior experiences
---
Plague with a cague
---
How bout this we call a truths as we are all chain saw gang is that a deal?
---
This man deserves everything, he is the best. Ochido on the other hand is a vhode
---
My build is self care,botany,spine chill,empathy
---
Hangman+spirit can be very powerful but with every other killer trash
---
That one works too I guess.
---
Grabs don't work all the time and there is some latency issues which caused problems with the trapper which are now fixed but sometimes killers like Billy or oni will use there insta down and sometimes they will be stunned but will hit over the pallet getting the down. Also there is a problem with staking where it takes about half a second to start and stop which can matter for 99ing
---
I'd kill for that system. The button mashing is incredibly boring.
---
Just farm it.
---
The obessness? Oh no...
---
some of these challenges make me want to pull my hair out
---
Yeah that's why I called it a small buff, maybe ben 4 tokens idk lol
---
I once saw a video where someone played with myers and he could stalk through walls but after ending stalking it getsback how it was but he still got the bp
---
Used to main claudette but after getting all her teachables I realised how much everyone seemed to hate her and how common she was so I swapped to Adam as with a common cosmetic he has you can blend in just as well if not even better. He's also the least played survivor (1.1% main him) and I've got a thing for rare stuff.
---
Sad but not surprising. I hope for the sake of the franchise it does well but they‚Äôre really ringing her dry imo.
---
hangmans trick is so underrated I love it ;)
---
Eh, Iron Maiden could proc distortion
---
What region are you in by chance?
---
I had three yellow and one pink on the same web once.
---
I still got my 4k though \\o/ EGC started up when I hooked one of them, I had my T3 ready and they got greedy.

I might be arrogant, but ignorant I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm just not playing this game for other people‚Äôs content anymore. If the killer isn‚Äôt having fun I could give a shit because I know if the roles were swapped we‚Äôd be in the exact same scenario (Talking killer in a power spot). You can be as upset as you want, call me as many names as you want too, but I‚Äôm not changing my playstyle for anybody. Dead By Daylight is too linear for bad players to try and police experienced players gameplay. I‚Äôve done everything you could possibly do in this game, if I want the killer to hate me, guess what that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm playing. Because in the end it‚Äôs Me Vs You, we‚Äôre playing against each other, and AGAIN, if you find the way a survivor is playing to be annoying, catch them and make them eat their fucking words. Don‚Äôt come onto forums and bitch and moan about how there‚Äôs a way to play the game and make sure everyone has fun!!! Grow up
---
XDDD
---
I feel like it's even worse because Julie and Frank literally share the same outfit.

...do a text post?

Legion = Updoot
---
That's why I liked the saw trailer. When the door opened and Tapp saw the pig and Dwight was so awesome. We need more trailers where the killers and survivors see eachother.
---
Watching youtubers such as Ussylis who has very good tutorials regarding flashlights and proper looping will help you immensely for improving your gameplay.
---
Loop wise the general idea is to run around an obstacle with a pallet a few times and then drop the pallet to prevent the killer from hitting you. Staying close to the walls of the loop will help you maximise its efficiency and allow you to possibly run around the obstacle a couple more times before needing to throw a pallet down. 
---
As you rank up you will hopefully learn to adopt more advanced techniques such as using a window to create distance and breaking LOS while looping to force the killer to look for you allowing you to gain more distance.
---
Most tiles are run a specific way. Watching high skilled survivors such as the one I previously mentioned will show you the best way to run tiles as its difficult to describe how to loop through words.
---
This is really cute, cool an accurate. This sub needs more stuff like this keep it up
---
Or one time with monto he was playing Myers had unlimited tier 3 stalked till tier 3 it played the sound on top of itself  (about .5 second delay in the sounds) then it went down and put him at 99.
---
Susie actually has a 12 inch cock.
---
the high and low ranked survivors in the same game is because of SWF. And there being a lot more survivor players than killers. So those survivors you're getting matched against probably had 10 min queues, and it just slaps you into it to give them a game.
---
Iam level 70 since 1-2 week/s cause im 12 years old and only need to go to school and do homework but im not a brat or toxic like most kids i realy don't understand them

Uff
