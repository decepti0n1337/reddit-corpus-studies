yeah I agree you can rank up very fast with no skill, but you shouldn‚Äôt be disrespectful towards anybody you see in rank one that doesn‚Äôt meet your standards of a ‚Äúskilled survivor‚Äù. 
---

---
I‚Äôve been playing for not even 3 months and i‚Äôm already to rank 3. Do I think I deserve to be there and i‚Äôm as good as everyone that should be ranked 3? No. So there‚Äôs some people out there that didn‚Äôt try to boost their way up on purpose.

I JUST HAD A KILLER FLAME ME AFTER ESCAPING THROUGH THE HATCH FOR "HIDING ALL GAME" AND "DOING NOTHING" AFTER 3 IRIDESCENTS and 1 SILVER AND OVER 15k POINTS MORE THAN THE FUCKING KILLER EVEN AFTER HE GOT A 3K, I'M NOT MAD AT BEING FLAMED OR THE KILLER BEING STUPID, I JUST WONDER WHAT'S GOING ON IN PEOPLE'S HEADS, DO THEY BELIEVE THEIR OWN WORDS?
---
Yeah because that doesn't scream hostage situation XD
---
YET ANOTHER VERY SOLID REASON WHY DEDICATED SERVERS CAN'T COME QUICKLY ENOUGH.
---
It still slows the game down better than overcharge does. 
---
the game process just stops working for no reason 
---
So the problem is that I‚Äôm humble? No, it wasn‚Äôt good game 2 people killed themselves because they didn‚Äôt think I would be able to land hits. When‚Äôs the last time you‚Äôve played Nurse? Just play 5 rounds with high sensitivity and you will get the hang of it. Most give up at 2 rounds.
---
FUCK HUNTRESS THATS NOT THE HATCHET WOUND I MEANT LET ME GET YOU SOME NEOSPORIN.
---
DUUUUUUUUUD
---
That is true
---
Ah, I still don‚Äôt really get what that means but it sounds bad so I think I got it.
---
SOLID BLACK EYES ARE MY FETISH.
---
website
---
...okay? But you can still hit them out. I'm not saying teabagging at the gate is justified but like.. when you stand there looking at them expecting them to leave it's like.. just hit them and they'll go.
---
Well howdy boah.
---
SHE HAS SLITS TO SPARE.
---
Ikr. Then they swarm you with downvotes just because they know they're being called out
---
It‚Äôs the same concept. That‚Äôs all I was getting at. 
---
I get dodged consistently and typically end up waiting 20 minutes per match even when lobby timers aren‚Äôt just trash.
---
At the moment killer is the easier role in most cases. Unless the survivors are a try hard SWF group you really shouldn‚Äôt have much trouble. 
---
The full outfits for Feng and Ace. I don't play the Huntress so I don't care enough to grind any longer.
---
I‚Äôm uncomfortable with how much I relate to this. üôçüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Howdy
---
Just hit them out and move onto your next game, y'all really that sensitive?
---
It‚Äôs the same concept, the issue wouldn‚Äôt exist if either both sides could see each other or neither could. Of course both scenarios can cause problems but the current way does as well so you know, what can ya do.
---
I like this style and would love to see more DbD characters like this.
---
YOU LOOP I TUNNEL THEMS THE RULES.
---
Not taking into consideration the ones who tap their nose on the exit line just waiting for you to watch them leave, not even giving you smack points. 
---
I‚Äôm failing to see your overall point. Yes, smacking them is an option, but being patient and taking advantage of an overconfident survivor is also an option. 
---
basically the game crashes and you have to forcefully Close it
---
Clown is not weak.

It‚Äôs a website I think it‚Äôs www.dbdbuilder.com

Aww thank you ‚ù§ You might wanna check out my profile or DeviantArt to see more of the killers I've drawn :3

Bing bong bong SO HELP ME SO HELP ME
---
Uhmmmmmm. Right [here!](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Premonition) 
---
Don‚Äôt look at the description, scroll down to the trivia part. It‚Äôs totally true, I‚Äôve tested this out.
---
I play at high sensitivity and sensitivity is not the reason for Nurse being hard to play. Its just hard to consistently blink during chase because of how choppy the game feels and moves. On a killer thats basicaly reliant on muscle memory you‚Äôre boiled down to just guessing. Rather just play Spirit and not have to worry about it until the opimtization ‚Äúpass‚Äù
---
He was saying tbagging is a sign of ‚Äúregression‚Äù of social skills
---
CAN WE GET THIS AS A PRE-GAME TIP IN GIANT FUCKING LETTERS PLZ BHVR
---
Huh. TIL. Seems like an oversight on the devs' part.
---
SMOKED TOO MANY JUULS.
---
It's always the people with D-Strike, Adrenaline, some exhaustion perk and Self Care that call you out for being a try hard and whatnot just because you used NOED.
---
PRETTY SAD BUT DAMN SMALL VICTORY AMIRITE
---
DOUBLE PIP DOWN AND MAKES SURVIVORS BUTTMAD WHATS THE DOWNSIDE
---
Right I forgot, Red rank survivors are only allowed five perks my b. No need for anything outside that meta you saw on YouTube right? 
---
My guy, I thought the same way you did ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Lol
---
It doesn't. But if you lack the skill to catch and down them then that's your only other option. Weak ass killers that need noed to feel accomplished in the game always use the excuse that the game isn't over just because the gates are open. So does that only work one way or both? Think about it. 
---
You're making the game fun for them and feeding them an ass load of points. No fun and no points means that they'll get bored and leave on their own.  
---
You have 2 blinks. Your first is to get your distance between you and the survivor, check if you can hit, if you can swing. If you can‚Äôt pull closer to them, predict if they will go back or forward. Give em the ol one two. Rinse and repeat. It‚Äôs harder but I would say it‚Äôs as hard as Dark Souls 3, hard to learn but once you get the hang of it it‚Äôs easy.
---
Lol
---
wow thanks for telling me something I know. Its easier said than done because it runs like shit on console
---
I don't know, I did fine enough eventually, but learning her on PS4 takes way more work than PC. I played back in October, and the frames went to shit every time I blinked or got the stun, making it easy for survivors to lose me. On my laptop, I consistently 3-4k with no frame drops to make chases a guessing game.
---
That is NOT what an acid trip is like. Now, if you saw the secret dragon Easter egg in the game, THEN it was a trip. 
---
Piggy come screeching around the corner. Year of the pig!
---
Played against Legion today at high ranks without my SWF. We all escaped but I didn't have any fun. Mending sucks and Legion is boring. 
---
Just curious, what do you use as the base for Masks? Paper mache? 
---
I‚Äôve always wanted to get into the hobby of Mask Making but never knew how/where to start
---
Haha true
---
WHERE IS ANNA? I‚Äôm disappointed 
---
I was thinking that too
---
This confirms my theory that Michael is a moth.

Comparing an engineering degree with counting is hilariously ignorant on your part.

COOL. I HOPE YOU USED THE REPORT OPTION IN GAME TOO. ACCORDING TO THIS ARTICLE IT'S "MANDATORY" BUT YOU SHOULD SUBMIT A FOLLOW UP TICKET WITH SCREENSHOTS TO BHVR IF YOU HAVEN'T YET JUST IN CASE: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system#latest
---
Ok you didn‚Äôt have to explain this to him you could have just said ‚Äúthank you!‚Äù And moved along,  it turn into a snotty little weirdo and give him a lesson on why nurse isn‚Äôt hard
---
You've yee'd your last haw
---
Legion is a thing and you gotta live with it. Also I play Legion because it's simply fun for me.
---
For fucks sake, I know I'm getting down voted to hell for this but can the constant "Legion is bad boring XD give me karma now" posts just stop? I find most, to not all legions who don't turn around while chasing fun. Y'all complain too much.
---
The I-frames give the perk versatility.
---
He said good nurses are rare. I just wanted to be humble and tell him that playing Nurse isn‚Äôt that hard. You right though. Mostly used this small little convo as an excuse to tell people that Nurse isn‚Äôt hard.
---
I let her escape after I left the throne, patience pays off
---
Oddly enough, that's what I was saying to my friend after he vanished like that!
---
Is this really a thing that happened?
---
Did the original version feature Sayori?
---
And I avoid legions because it‚Äôs simply not fun for me to play against. 
---
In any case, the best legion build is sloppy, bloodhound,thana and ruin(tier 3) no need to moonwalk or bring in ridiculous addons. 
---
Is it oil? I always assumed it was blood because it looked so red
---
I also would like to know
---
They're also a clown
---
Everything is 3D printed, so I have to create a highly detailed 3D model first.
---
Something like that haha
---
People don't really main him do they?  I thought he was for the lolz.
---
Puppers is good for sure, he just doesn't take it too seriously. He gets killed for doing silly stuff, which is actually refreshing to watch. 
---
I appreciate that :)
---
That's lucky. For me, they've been broken as shit, looking completely away or completely upwards and I still get hit with it. Most annoying item in the game right now
---
I love using this after rank reset to make dumb builds for Billy and just chill out a bit.

Survivors talking about gen rushing: GiVe Us AnOtHeR oBjEcTiVe

Survivors bitching about NOED and totem killing: It SlOwS mAtChEs DoWn
---
I swear survivor mains can't get their shit straight.
---
&gt; I've always found these 'discussions' a waste of time
---
Indeed they are. Survivors are constantly bitching about anything that makes killers stronger or that allows them to, well, kill. There's a marked difference between the complaints about killers and survivors:
---
*Survivors aren't supposed to be as strong as they are*
---
Killers are supposed to be strong. They're supposed to be fearsome. As it stands, killers are a survivor's plaything because of stupidly strong tiles and how close they are to one another. 
---
&gt; It's like trying to debate with a climate change denier
---
Oh boy, spotted the leftist lmao. All the further proof that:
---
&gt; these 'discussions' a waste of time
---
Seen all I need to see. 
---
I don‚Äôt care how long it takes for you to get a lobby 10 seconds to an hour I don‚Äôt care, if you are a Claudette, swf, using a flashlight, or are p3 enjoy getting dodged and back to the waiting

Idk why but I really want to experience this bug 1 time haha.
---
Maybe her bathroom trip took slightly longer :&gt;
---
Pig &amp; Myers (tie for me). 
---
Masochist!
---
First to die üòÇ
---
In the #1 situation yeah it makes sense to camp _at times_, namely endgame scenarios like that where your other option is to intentionally "throw" by moving away and letting them unhook.  Chances are that unless you have a gap closer and/or insta-downer, you're just giving up a kill for the sake of being nice/fair/whatever.  
---
That's a concept some Survivor players don't seem to always understand is that the Killer doesn't always have to be nice and let them escape for free.  
---
Upvote for being part of the uwu gang. 
---
I think I enjoy versing Amanda or Myers the most. 
---
They have lots of mind games to be had. (Also Amanda sounds so cute when she‚Äôs hit with pallets uwu)
---
Wait. Waitwaitwait. So someone apparently wins Ace, and... well... I mean...

I will need to consult /r/dbdgonewild to see what happens next.

Alert, Tenacity, Distortion, Empathy.
---
My build isn‚Äôt very good but it‚Äôs not too terrible so guess I‚Äôll just exist 
---
Ruin 1 is pretty useless. But so is overcharge unless you are planning on 3genstratting every game. Sloppy Butcher is by far the best choice out of those 3 but depending on your rank people may not heal against Legion. In that case it only offers tracking help and doesnt aid in stalling the game.
---
That's a poor system, just go stand in a corner and they'll leave? They're supposed to be running from you not running the game
---
Kinda me haha but the last one for me is when I'm in the middle of opening up the exit gate.
---
Those seconds were you don't know if the killer is coming your way.

The spirit then uses her ability to leave her husk at the desk to fool adam and go karaoke with the other killers lol

Btw great artwork, great context, and great pun lol
---
The good old ‚ÄúMy dad is Jagex‚Äù revamped
---
Nurse and Legion, mostly cause I've not really been up against players who use them correctly. Jukes for days haha
---
No It's probably Myers, Billy (sometimes) and Trapper.
---
Because Amanda (Pig) was a drug addict before she got brought into the trials. lmao
---
a lot of the billys ive met have been toxic üíÄ i met one who facecamped me because my outfit looked ‚Äústupid‚Äù
---
Nurse and Myers 
---
Ah, damn. 
---
Doctor, spirit, or even pig maybe 
---
They arent destroyed
---
Stackable 
---
Some people will main anything.
---
Also Legion I guess has an aesthetic/gameplay style that appeals to some.  
---
Yeah I've definitely went up against my fair share of camping Billy boys. I usually laugh it off when a killer camps, they are hurting themselves not me or my team...granted they're doing gens. 
---
gen progression usually stops when i get hooked lmaoo
---
Ah must not run back and grab them then
---
No hag or huntress üò≠
---
Except with the event, wasting time is very much worth it. :/ If a survivor is holding a vessel and using the event offering, they have no reason to leave unless forced out because they are still gaining points from holding it. One of the big reasons the event isnt very fun.
---
I can imagine there being one trial every day, and when they are out of trial, all the survivors and killers just hang out in the woods doing shit like this 
---
Get ready for incoming comment spam of ‚ÄúoMg StOnETOss iS A nAZI1!1!!!!!!!1!!!!‚Äù

That sucks, this is why I usually run Kindred. The rest will be able to see him face camping me.
---
Ive had on multiple occasions where I'll leave, go use the washroom, make cereal, eat said cereal, come back and still be in a hatch stand off
---
There was rumor of Valentine's Day
---
Myers. It's intense and you get to hear the soundtrack.
---
Just the Ace outfit.
---
I don't use Feng and I'm utterly hopeless as Huntress so don't use her.
---
It's cartoon muscles. It's a joke.

ButIkindalikelookingatthis.

They're not calling for it to be broken again they're calling for it to be a lower rarity. No need to cry over literally nothing now.
---
No u
---
You got me there. I mean it doesn‚Äôt really bother me most of the time pardoning some wtf moments. I may be saying it in a way that makes it sound easy but like I said, it‚Äôs really hard and infuriating at the start but once you recognize progress it‚Äôs fine. Every killer is unforgivabing. 
---
r/cursedcomments
---
Am I seriously the only one who could be assed to look at the bottom left of the screen and think about what it means? Everybody is treating the Claudette like she's a salty little crybaby who DC'd ten seconds into the match, but as soon as you look at the bottom left of the screen you should realize "oh, the game over's for her, she's just Narnia-memeing the killer and popping the hatch for the fourth survivor." The killer probably lost a single brown/yellow node's worth of bloodpoints not being able to hook her, though OP managed to cleverly cash in his amusing experience for a fat stack of fake internet points. Only he can tell us whether or not it was worth it.
---
But really, look at the state of the game. Even if Claudette isn't already on death hook, two survivors are dead, she's about to be hooked, and there are two gens left to finish. *This is a hatch game now.* It wouldn't be a hatch game if it were 3v1 with one on hook. It wouldn't be a hatch game if it were 2v1 with one being chased. It would even be worth going for it if it were a 2v1 with one on hook and one gen left - adrenaline is a hell of a perk. But as is, the last survivor has basically no way to reset the game, and no one to buy time for. Anything they do will just lead the killer right back to them. Unless the killer fucks off to the corner of the map to stare at a wall out of the niceness of his heart, hatch is the only thing that matters now.
---
The nicest thing Claudette can do in this situation - and it's what I would do if I were in her shoes - is suicide on hook to pop the hatch for her fourth teammate. Which is sort of what she did, except it looks like she did it with a sense of humor. You don't have to be bitter and cynical about everything you see in DBD. There are enough salty survivors that you don't have to assume the worst from everyone. This seriously just looks like someone trying to be funny.
---
'Get Low' by Lil John
---
I think I understand it perfectly well. The Facade is a technical killer that requires you to swap forms to maximize your effectiveness. As far as ‚Äúwhere the game is going‚Äù what do you mean? Echolocation will detect survivors in lockers as well. Utilize your ability to find survivors effectively. The gear system is very simple, actually. It‚Äôs just a sub item near your hud.
---
ultra rare perks are the best
---
You could do the same thing for the last event too. This isn't like a new thing.
---
The person on the hook.
---
Its thursday tho.
---
‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫
---
I'd love Jack the Ripper but I can't see them adding a killer who was infamous for gutting people with a knife directly after adding a killer that runs around with a knife,  stabbing people. 
---
People complained about it enough that the devs had to state its not a bannable offense 
---
I bought the black skull mask for Susie because it looks great. So.. Yeah. 
---
The worst is when it break your toolbox.
---
New Shirtless Myers emote plz
---
Totally expected you to get blindsided by a cross-map hatchet.
---
Im kinda confused at the answer "None of the characters prior to now have ever met before." Is he saying that the survivors had never met each other in the real world prior to becoming trapped in the realm?
---
Sprint burst at least has a downside if you don't time it right. Dead hard's downside is you take a hit you would have anyway.
---
If we won't get that cosmetic I'm gonna cry
---
I think if every rank 1 survivor was actually the elite and the queue actually only matches you with elite. Most killers would stop playing and you‚Äôd ONLY see legion/nurse/billy/spirit. More so than already. Also queue times would skyrocket for red ranks. The loose ranking system is fine imo. The devs never intended this game to be hyper competitive to begin with, as proof that rime after time they‚Äôd prefer to lean towards ‚Äúimmersion‚Äù based updates. 
---
yeah. To much.
---
A 5'7 dude that streams and talks like he's perpetually stuck being 12 years old told me to DC every Legion game and to rally for the unrealistic expectation that the devs will delete the killer entirely.  Because I'm apart of the soy generation that idolizes unremarkable geeks that sit on their pilonidal cyst'd up asses all day playing video games, I must parrot them.  
---
Yeah it's a Mac. But probably bootcamp or parallels to allow windows to run on Mac Os.
---
I mean if you just don‚Äôt stand by the hatch, the standoff won‚Äôt happen lmao
---
wholesome content we need more of
---
That Claudette has not mastered invisibility power yet.
---
you have an amazing husband OP omg
---
I like to see how long they drag it out. Gives me an excuse to go get cereal
---
Pretty much I mean after 6000 hours I would imagine you would stop caring
---
Dead hard doesnt work if you dont time it right... its literally all about timing.
---
We‚Äôre happy to announce the new chapter: Greed and Gluttony. With it, we‚Äôll be releasing two characters: The new Killer, the Cook; and Quinn, The Waiter.
---
The Waiter comes with four teachable perks, as opposed to the usual three. We hope this change will help further solidify the identities of the different survivors, and we‚Äôll be adding more perks in the long run to make this change universal.
---
Allow Me - Available in the bloodweb at level 35. 
---
You‚Äôre no stranger to picking up after them. See the aura of dropped items within 12/24/Unlimited meters.
---
At level 3, see the aura of pallets within 8 meters.
---
‚ÄúNo, no, let me get that for you.‚Äù - Quinn
---
Regular Customer - Available in the bloodweb at level 40.  
---
You have a keen eye for when a customer is agitated, and know how to dodge. When you exit a chase, you receive a token up to a maximum of 2/3/2. When you enter a chase, consume 2/2/1 token(s) and leave no scratch marks for 1/3/3 seconds.
---
‚ÄúSorry, let me double check that for you.‚Äù -Quinn
---
Tip Your Server - Available in the Bloodweb at level 45. 
---
A good outfit catches the attention of those who want something. Your aura is visible to other survivors within 12/24/32 meters and, when not in a chase, killers within 32/24/12 meters.
---
‚ÄùJust let me know if you need anything.‚Äù -Quinn
---
Closing Time - Available in the Bloodweb at level 50.
---
The job isn‚Äôt over until everyone‚Äôs out. Your allies open the exit gates 6/10/14% faster. For each escaped survivor, gain a 1/1/2% increase to movement speed. At level 3, the hatch‚Äôs aura is revealed to you when within 16 meters.
---
‚ÄúYou can go home. Let me finish up what I‚Äôm doing, and I‚Äôll leave too.‚Äù -Quinn.
---
Quinn is a durable survivor, able to occupy the killer for as much time as it takes for their allies to get the job done, while cleaning up after their messes.
---
Basically, looping: The survivor. I‚Äôm a waiter, which means I‚Äôm running around all the time, constantly dealing with a customer here, bringing food over there, et cetera, and I‚Äôm generally the one keeping people happy. Naturally, this means I‚Äôm always on the move, and people are always trying to get my attention. That‚Äôs translated into a perk set that rewards keeping the killer occupied on your own while your team does what they need to do.
---
Allow Me is a soft counter to Franklin‚Äôs, but also has the side benefit of letting you know when a teammate doesn‚Äôt want what they got from a chest- an allusion to picking up full plates of food after they leave. Also people drop forks all the time and I‚Äôm sick of it.
---
Regular Customer definitely needs tweaking. It‚Äôs generally a bad idea to start a chase unless you‚Äôre a god-tier looper, but you‚Äôre rewarded by making it even easier to gain advantage at the beginning of a different chase. The token counts are so you need two chases for one boost at level one, two for one but you can stock an extra at level two, and theoretically being able to stock another boost at level three. I‚Äôve seen enough customers stomp in to know when it‚Äôs suddenly my turn to grab stuff from the fridge.
---
TYS is basically reverse bond, with the added benefit of making it easier to draw attention away from someone who needs it. If the killer‚Äôs got the choice of chasing the P3 Claudette or the one with a visible aura, who‚Äôre they gonna choose? The downside is you have to leave them quickly, or the killer‚Äôll find two survivors at once which is... not good.
---
Closing Time is the ‚Äúfuck this I just worked a 10 hour shift and I still need to put close up shop, fine I‚Äôll power through it fuck it‚Äù perk. The job‚Äôs done, just need to send everyone home.
---
oh I meant he didn't get any Valentine's cosmetics
---
big fax
---
Thanks
---
Yikes
---
bloooooooooodyyyyyyyyyy
---
Wait, seriously? This is something I haven't heard of. Maybe it's because I'm relatively new to the game, but still, this seems a weird thing to complain about
---
It does not give too much considering it's statistical weakness compared to the rest.
---
The others give speed boosts for escapes. Dead Hard gives a small invincible boost for mess ups to keep a survivor going. It's a perk that doesn't have anything wrong with it.
---
Jesus Chris
---
Even better when you dont even get to use NOED.
---
Okay, this is the ramblings of an insane person.
---
But DCing to give someone hatch is still wrong. That‚Äôs not fair gameplay and it abuses why the devs have a hatch 
---
Suddenly I feel like the F13 copyright suit was justified 
---
Wow, that's just amazing.
---
Well Friday is rising in Europe i thought i ll post it a little early before i forget it again :P Had the video saves for sometime xD
---
She wasn't playing bad, she actually got more points than me lol. (Not even counting the survival bonus.) It's just the fact that she went out of her way to intentionally troll me. She could have easily ran when she sees Dr and got away but instead stood there 5 seconds pointing at locker as he got closer and closer. lol
---
Nea is missing :(
---
It's more fun to fly across the map as the hillbilly and down and pick them up before they can run through the exit after mocking you... "should have stayed a little closer to the exit next time"üòÇ
---
The hotfix they put out today upped the points by a little bit for Killers.  Yeah it's more lucrative for Survivors if you an escape with a relic, giving a potential of 45 points or so for a match iirc. 
---
It's just a good vibes post. I see lots of images of less importance...
---
Dude is insane lol
---
Fair enough
---
He absolutely is he needs a green add on to functional his reload is abysmal without any add ons and he only has 4 bottles by default and now with medium vaulting there isn't nearly as much of a penalty to his bottles
---
Outside with Michael
---
Of course. At the end of the day it's just a game and they weren't being inherintley toxic so it's all good in my books.
---
Adrenaline, exhaustion perks and SC shouldn't be a problem for killers. DS is ass tho.
---
Probably did it so people could get em all. It's unrealistic to get all 9 coins the way it was unless all you did was play. Personally I just did it for the huntress gear (my main when I do play killer) so I'm good on it now.
---
i tried it and immediately got deja vu :(
---
Survivor main here. Do whatever you have to do. 
---
This was funny and nice to look at at the same time
---
That was very unfair for her to do to you. Isn‚Äôt the point to try and help everyone to make it out (if you can)? I wouldn‚Äôt have pointed you out to the doctor, sorry that happened to you!
---
I don't know what this is, but...it's kinda hot.
---
I think affecting the ranking pips isnt enough in general. People would still do it. I wish the devs would implement mechanics that literally make camping a losing strategy. People should die much slower on hook if the killer is still nearby for example. The killer needs to be incentivised to leave and pressure gens and chase other survivors. That's how the game is intended to be played. At very least there should be a bloodpoint penalty for camping.
---
This is bad
---
If the point cost increases by another +100 each time, yeah it's pretty much not possible for anyone who plays only a few matches per day.  
---
Damn see ya in a year
---
There was also a flag (I can't remember what flag it was) that they posted on twitter. And part of the lore for the place that flag belonged to was a vampire or something like that.
---
Considering you literally can't depip past 17 yeah its harder. Its not possible without multiple rank resets.
---
wraith, cannibal, and maybe trapper. Huntress can be fun too
---
Myers or trapper!
---
NO CAMP, 4K, I'M BAD BECAUSE I JUGGLED THE DS LOL

Probably the Entity messing with killers. The same way Freddy in his bio notices "His powers were reduced in some ways but focused in others" or how a guy like the Clown is able to keep up with star athlete Meg.

What about my boi generator Jake 
---
You get it. Most here don‚Äôt. Frame rate can be compensated. I can consistently get 4ks at red ranks with Nurse now. I wanna say I practiced about 10-20 matches until I consistently got blink ranges and lunges. Now I can hop on and off without losing my groove too much. Best thing to do to convince that you have no idea what you are doing is to wear the

WW2 stuff. It‚Äôs great what survivors think they can pull off. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to crouch behind this pole as fucking Kate and she won‚Äôt see me.‚Äù
---
Although, next time it's different SWF and different killer after that, it's how toxicity spreads. Every SWF and every killer players are different, and if you are taking ebony just because previous group bullied you, it's you who are being to blame this time around.

DON'T WORRY, THE PALLET WILL HIT THEM IF THEY ARE ON THE SAME MAP AS IT

I agree with 4 out of the 5, missing Vincentvega

Is that a flashlight in your pants or you just happy to see Kate?

---
Well, fragile bookworm Claudette can also lift David King off a meathook in about two seconds.
---
First of, I was mostly listing a lot of the points I did being made, and most of them are from a survivor perspective, I do not necessarily agree with all of them 100%. I think the hate wagon is a bit over the top, but in its basis still very understandable. I do play both killer and survivor, and I also did play a bunch of Legion.
---
&gt; That's like saying BBQ&amp;C is bad because they can ignore stealth if they hook one survivor. Yes, technically true but it still requires that first hit.
---
No. BBQ gives away the location of survivors that are 40 meters away and are not in a locker. It does not punish you because a team mate got hit by Frenzy and they where less then 32 meter away. Since Legion has 24 meters TR, more often 16 thanks to Monitor, you don't even know if you are in danger of being spotted with his Hunting Instinct or however it is called (esp since it is 40 meters with Monitor).
---
&gt; The skill required for a killer and a survivor is massively different.
---
Thats why I said the skill in a chase. Yes, you can gen rush against Legion, like against most killers, but in a chase, your only tool is to pallet stun them in Frenzy. Something Legion is the best at baiting out with their speed, or by just m1'ing you. If they are not stupid, a Legion has a guaranteed down within 40-50 seconds with nothing you can do about it. The only skillful part of the survivor is trying to maximize this time. Which is something true for most killers, but not with a guaranteed down at the end. The problem with Legions power is that it is designed to guarantee that down, without counterplay (only exception is pallet stuns, but that buys you around 15 seconds but allows Legion to just m1 in the endgame). 
---
&gt; True, but a simple strategy is simply not healing. I find so many people when I play as Legion simply because they keep trying to heal.
---
I am talking about Mending, not healing. Legion forces you to do it, and if they are opportunistic enough, you will do it at least 5 times in a match. Also, just staying injured all match is not a good idea. Legion can just run up to you, cancel Frenzy and m1 down you, esp if a lot of pallets got dropped or they have cooldown addons. Esp nice since they have such a low tr.
---
&gt; You mention that Legion eliminates skillful parts of the chase but then say that moonwalking is "cheese tactics". Moonwalking takes a good amount of skill and trying to do it while tracking a survivor mid-chase is a bitch.
---
Ok, let me rephrase that. It removes all skill from the survivor side. It is literally not counter-able, since you have to mend up. Moonwalking also gets a lot easier with perks like Sloppy and/or Bloodhound. You can also do the budget versions in the form of "looking at them but keeping a bit of distance" or "walking forward but looking down (the only drawback being it is slightly less consistent with ending the chase)".
---
&gt; Code for: survivors actually have to try rather then steamrolling a noob nurse or teabagging at a wraith.
---
I hate dc'ing and don't endorse it, but I get why people do it. While I shouldn't be the one to talk about fun as a Freddy main, Legion literally brings nothing fun to the table that every other killer does not have. Legion does not win a chase because they outplayed the survivor or made a amazing mindgame, they win the chase because they are guaranteed to win it. Their skill decide how much time is reduced.
---
So, tl;dr: Legion only removes elements from the game, while adding nothing. They inflict a debuff that you can not play around in a interesting way (for example, like the pigs headtraps). You best counterplay is hiding against them, but that can be said for just about every killer, however that directly gets countered by legion just hitting someone else with the Frenzy. You might say "Don't be near other survivors" but this is still a team game, you will need to do unhooks, you will need to heal each other up, you will need to coordinate efforts for some trickier saves. And Legion having the 32 to 40 meter radius around them in their hunting certainly make it a bigger problem. Betting to get 2k with Legion is a pretty save bet, even against a really good team, which really shouldn't be the case for any killer. You can play and like whatever you want, but people do have legit reasons to dislike facing the Legion.
---
probably, but still. I thought there was a bigger Penalty 
---
To be fair Nurse can‚Äôt see anything 
---
They gonna buff the perk ?
---
Wheres ochido!?!
---
I‚Äôm guessing these are 3D printed and painted? This is what I‚Äôd imagine all of these cosmetics actually looking like in real life. You‚Äôve done a really good job on all of these! They really stay true to the game!
---
No.
---
I‚Äôd rather face an Omega blink nurse than face a legion of any caliber. There‚Äôs a chance, a CHANCE you can outplay a god tier nurse. There‚Äôs interactivity between the survivor and killer even if it might be minimal in some cases. 
---
Against any tier legion that doesn‚Äôt have a smooth brain, there‚Äôs no counterplay. He hits you, and you go down. You can‚Äôt loop him, you can‚Äôt lose him, if he has franks you might as well just stand still. Even if he doesn‚Äôt moonwalk you to oblivion, he‚Äôll just keep using his power to pass through all obstacles and fuck your ass if he really wants you. 
---
It is unfair and unfun that 3 people D/C against legion, or any killer really. I don‚Äôt disagree. But at the same time, I‚Äôm not going to play against someone who wants to play single player DBD and not interact with the survivors at all. 
---
Hell, I‚Äôd rather get face camped by bubba. 
---
Lemme correct that for ya; *David
---
Here's my guess: Claudette hiding in the locker as Billy approaches (maybe using BBQ to get an idea). Billy looking very thoroughly, Claudette says "if he fucking checks this locker I'm out". Billy sniffs it out, boom
---
Rofl
---
Top left corner next to David is a pair of eyes.
---
Probably an unpopular stance but There is a massive penalty in place to camping and it is already a losing strategy.  Had they ignored the camp and worked on gens like they should have they likely would have knocked out 3 and made decent progress on the others in the time you camped one hook.  The counter to camp exists in gen rushing your ass off. I split almost 50/50 between killer and survivor so not a killer or survivor main for what it is worth. 
---
The entity prevents them from fighting back. That‚Äôs why a survivor can‚Äôt just tear out a hatchet from a closet and defend themselves.
---
Would you be up for teaching us how you did this? It's so good!!!
---
Oh thank you for both!
---
Carded
---
Bubba sure is a pretty lady
---
Well yeah, he grew up on L√ÑMPkin Lane.
---
What about trutalent?
---
Wouldn't this make it harder for the killer too? I mean you can't focus on someone until they die, you'd be grabbing a random person every time.
---
What‚Äôs funny here is that the blame is equally shared between the teammates and the killer. 
---
You blame the clown for face camping but if your team did objectives, you would‚Äôve lived if you really did loop the clown for 15 min. 
---
Leatherface always camps tbh, expect that.
---
Half your team dc‚Äôd. Also not the killers fault.

Just playing devils advocate here

That‚Äôs the sweat from Susie, notice how there are 2 identical marks to the right of Susie.
---
Or make it dependant on a survivor having an item then consume your item on use. Nothing like stabbing a killer in the shoulder with a brown medkit.
---
You can‚Äôt report her for anything lol. Nothing she did was against twitch TOS ( I know because I stream too). And while it may be considered working with the killer, it isn‚Äôt really. 
---
Would you even have an issue If she wasn‚Äôt streaming? Wouldn‚Äôt you just brush it off as another dumbass teammate? 
---
I know. The best way to counter it is bait it, which is easy with Bloodlust and/or on the straight and narrow 
---
I'm used to the disconnects at this point as sad as it is. Just wish people would actually be punished for it. The huntress let me get away though after smacking her with all the pallets and doing gens. Tried to get them to kill me but they refused.
---
I think I got the same people in my game. "Uwu" and "Friendly Player"?
---
iirc, the most popular option they considered was applying the "broken" effect (no healing from injured) when you used DS. I can't remember if it was cleared on hook or not (I don't think so), but it really gave it a feeling of "This is my LAST DITCH EFFORT, do NOT blow it when I can't capitalize on it."
---
What material did you use to make the Huntress' two masks? (the Rabbit and the Kitty one). In game they're made of paper but I don't think that would hold up with a mask that complex.
---
Body blocking survivors in the basement? How is that even possible the stairs are way too wide for that
---
I had the exact same thing happen with the dbd update lol. Thought I was the only one!! Sat there and watched it go 344 days... 358 days.... more than one year lol
---
If you make a hillbilly i will cry with joy
---
I‚Äôm guessing you found a ‚Äúdoing gens, you?‚Äù And the killer noticed and helped you BM him?
---
6 teammates? What?
---
Thank you very much!

I like legion &gt;-&gt; he maxes out my chase bar where as if I play clown even is down in a couple if seconds

Yes.

*You're the saddest teammate I ever met*

*But you can bet before we're through*

*Dwight, I'll make a man out of you*
---
I more than agree with the rank rewards. Most of the time the people in rank 1 don't want to be there because the games are a lot harder with no additional rewards.

üÖ±ill is going to make a üÖ±ig üÖ±oom with his fancy new üÖ±azooka

Nah billy is kicking ass, he has his booze and feet up on the table. i Guess because he has no poker face XD
---
Shit fam you must have no fun at all then 
---
Wow what a salty survivor i always thank a killer who gives the hatch extra blood points.
---
I don't watch games, I PLAY THEM!
---
For susie maybe something a little harder. Excision or knife party? Joke not intended. 
---
Its why I stopped :/ I got 4 messages after a game going "wow you a fucking dumbshit" wow sorry I was being nice 
---
Same here, I always send a thank you message.
---
That survivor blood warden concept would make a great perk for a sort of survivor whose learned how to manipulate the Entity's realm. I like the ideas here and they're super cool o;;o
---
Lobby dodging cannot be punishable. Can you imagine a penalty for leaving a lobby with 300+ ping? EVERYONE would be banned lol  
---
Haha thanks, I really want some form of this blood warden to exist personally!
---
You sound like a blast at parties 
---
a much more shorter way of explaining would be that he makes the games a lot longer because survivors need to constantly stop to mend themselves. those are just my simple thoughts on legion though
---
That's tough luckily I hardly experience that, mostly when I try to play swf it takes long

Hex: Immersion

A hex rooting it's power on Claudette.

Her cowardice will be their downfall.

Bruh half your posts are in a fortnite sub, you're probably like twelve. Don't let your dad catch you using no no words on the internet. 
---
If you don't like people complaining about game design then you're on the wrong subreddit 
---
yeah it was massively cunty of her to do so;
---
 Report in game and dodge in lobby, or play with them just dont bring/use anything. (personally I have a shitlist of people who do that crap +more and just avoid playing another game with them but thats just me);
---
Exactly! 
---
I like the slight imbalance between killer/survivors, gives a little excitement to getting away, but I stopped caring about random Players gaming experience. 
---
Ochido is definetly not debatable. He isn't a good part of this community.
---
There are 4 survivors in a match. I played 2, and I take up 2 of those 8 total spots. Basically each match I had 2 teammates DC. 
---
Honestly my heart goes *crazy* in the loading screen. I think it might have something to do with my anxiety or something. Especially when I'm playing killer. 
---
Im a nurse kinda killer
---
*honestly I just really want a survivor that can manipulate the realm like Vigo could*
---
Bruh, can you at least form an actual insult if you're going to try? It's not fun when you're just flailing your arms around screaming "I'M NOT DUMM UR DUM." Btw, you'll never get good at dodging flashlights if you only dodge lobbies. That's why you'll never make it past rank 10. If that. Toodles, kiddo. Send me a postcard from rank 20.
---
...There's a launch video for Overwatch?

Time for YouTube 
---
oof thats all your 46 iq can come up with? sad
---
I have that exact laptop!
---
Should be reversed. With the recent lobby times
---
people these days smh my head
---
And then everyone says "just do gens". Like yeah I'm trying to have a fun game with friends during my leisure time I'm not trying to hang on a hook waiting for some asshole to stop staring at me while everyone else gets minimal amounts of points for trying to get gens done before my inevitable death. Everyone says it's only low ranks but at least a third of my games at rank 1 will have some camping ass ruining the game for everyone for no reason. They should be punished for more than just losing their 'precious' chaser points.
---
When the gates are open and your next to it your teammates are no longer useful thus the best way to increase your chance of survival is to leave them to die a twitch streamer said this though I can‚Äôt remember his name
---
Is it really an exploit? I mean, if it were an exploit, wouldn't it have been fixed by now? 
---
**Disclaimer: Don't moonwalk Legion, in fact, I don't even have Legion...so chill**
---
He's saying it shouldn't be an ULTRA RARE HIGHEST RARITY IN THE GAME that costs 7k on the bloodweb to unlock because it's worthless now, not that it should be reverted. When you read the post in it's entirety the context becomes clear.
---
I legitimately think the idea of a killer who walks backwards, or at least appears to, could be terrifying. Not for Legion reasons, though.
---
"The nicest thing Claudette could've done is exploit a game mechanic to deny the killer two more kills" okay
---
*Gets pulled out* homework
---
then why are you holding a hatchet huntress

WTF 8 JUST SPENT 200K BP AND none OF MY ADD-ONS ARE THERE!!

It seems like you're projecting a bit given the fact that you haven't even been using proper punctuation.

Puppets isn't angrypug. His content is quite good though, he streams pretty much everyday, also play with monto and noob3 a fair amount if you like them

"completely worthless"
---
Those are his exact words. Even if he's not calling for it to be changed back in the post, he clearly wants it to be if he thinks the addon is, in his own words, "completely worthless." When you use context clues to dig deeper past what is initially said, you can see that he clearly resents the change, and preferred it the old way.

I HAVEN'T PLAYED FOR THREE PLUS DAYS NOW NOT JUST DUE TO SICKNESS BUT GETTING DICKED FOR NOT 1, 2, OR EVEN 3 GAMES BUT SIX IN A ROW WHERE THE KILLER WAS SOME SORT OF TOXIC ASS CLOWN OR GOT AN LUCKY END GAME SMACK. 4 OF THEM HAD THE KILLER TUNNEL ME UNTIL I WAS DEAD INCLUDING TIMES WHERE I WAS THE ONLY ONE GETTING HOOKED UNTIL I DIED, ONE HAD A HAG GET NOED JUST AS I FINISHED THE LAST GEN AND FOUND ME, AND THEN THE LAST WAS A FUCKING HUNTRESS LEACHING OFF A DWIGHT'S ALTRUIST BY LEAVING ME CRAWLING ON THE FLOOR, EVEN AFTER I GOT UNBREAKABLE OFF I JUST GOT DOWNED AGAIN SO I ACTUALLY DISCONNECTED TO GIVE DWIGHT A WINNING GAME. SERIOUSLY I JUST WANTED TO GET LAURIE STRODE'S RITUAL DONE WITH.

After 2 events in a row giving them out killers have learned that looking up slightly makes them immune to them. Crackers didnt get nerfed, killers just got gud.

what angered you? my tag or how I enjoy the clown's belly?
---
Yea I was trying to use a chest build, I figured two chests would be decent items. I got 4 firecrackers (I brought a chest offering) I‚Äôm annoyed by these because they appear in every bloodweb as is for only 3k, idk why they need to appear in chests.
---
Where's hexy
---
13th, nothing else resets
---
As a Clown main Clown is not weak. He's buggy and requires addons to do anything due to some serious design issues but he's not "weak." He has the tier placement he has for a reason. I've been playing him at Rank 1 with crap perks and crap addons (fukn' Kerosene Can and Brown Addons) and I've been consistently getting 3ks and 4ks.
---
He just needs a few small tweaks and bug fixes. He's insanely powerful but like Pig since the community hasn't bitched about his problems he hasn't been fixed.
---
Thanks, I appreciate that. Deleting the post
---
Do you think legion is actually a good killer or why are you lumping them with actual good killers?
---
i never dc (unless my connection decides it wants to die) but if i join a game and its a tunnel legion i will just play normally until i get hooked then i will just suicide since i know as soon as i get out of that hook i will get tunneled again so may as well speed things up and get myself into another game to have fun
---
wait what why? other people might not know
---
I wish my games went like that!
---
Its been a month since his last DBD video, I miss his DAHKTA gameplay 
---
Shit.
---
I know that feeling. When you want to vault a window during killer chase but suddenly hide in nearby locker.

I knew when I clicked on the comments that there would be one about the bulge. I love reddit ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I wish he had made one for Spirit, or an in-depth one like his Doctor guide

---
Meg - Best survivor

My favorite is I dc
---
The way legion plays, you are guaranteed to at least pip, regardless of the skill-level of the survivors. He‚Äôs not good, just consistent, therefore you would see him in red ranks frequently. 
---
MAYBE IF KILLER WASNT SO FUCKING MISERABLE TO PLAY PEOPLE WOULD ACTUALLY PLAY IT 
---
Not ruin 1.  Only affecting 2 people with the risk of losing it early ain't worth the risk vs. Reward of higher tier ruin.  And Overcharge does some work with the 3 gen strat.
---
how about sir rodion?
---
Yeah, had someone connecting from the plains of Mongolia (or somewhere like that) the other night, telling me I have 'shit net'.
---
Yeah gee, sorry I can't give you green ping when you connect from half way around the world. Other three survivors pointed out they didn't have a problem, but the guy was still adamant it was my fault.
---
You can't tell these imbeciles anything because they're too stupid to understand how latency works.
---
But they finish the last gen while he's carrying you, so it becomes worthless
---
Had that happen to me one, I just found the killer and let them kill me. I was mad when I kobed trying to kill myself because it never happens when I need it to. 
---
it's a good idea, but it would make wake up... viable... i think im gonna throw up
---
r/iamverysmart
---
I was thinking of making another post making some perks like wake up and left behind actually viable lol
---
They don't even do that. Most survivors I play against remove it on their first or second box. RNG based abilities are stupid.
---
Most of my post-game salt is from fellow survivors. Especially when some dumbass gets hooked when the exit gates are powered, and expects me to go back for them when there's an EW3 Myers waiting nearby. They'd rather you die trying to save them against impossible odds, than escaping without them.
---
If anyone need this for some silly reason go here
---
To each their own I suppose everyone plays their own way.
---
However there are times where I‚Äôm downed or hooked and my teammates are near the open exits and they try to save me and a lot of them die.
---
Some manage to save me and we all survive but most of the time either only one of us makes it out or none of us do.

I cant wait to hit 2K! It took me a little under a year to get 1K. I started May 18th 2018. And got 1K yesterday

Where's Nea? :3

If they hide in a corner doing nothing for more than 20 minutes, that's considered taking the game hostage. Screenshot and report next time it happens.
---
The majority of streamers play killer for dbd... perhaps you should take your own advice and go and check the twitch page. 
---
Lmao, don't try to justify it. You can still see Claudette easy as shit if she's out in the open, and has the fireflies around her to boot. This guy is a straight up dumbass.
---
I have problems with pallets all of the time. I hate them. I have to basically get under them to use them and then it pushes me to the side the killer's on.
---
Where is tyde time tho the best streamer/youtuber ever /s

Ask the hag.

That's why I dodge lobbies with streamers, regardless of if they're on my team or not. All you are to them is entertainment for their loser followers.

It's grieving so yes, of course you can report them for that.

Or when we popped all the dull totems while a team mate was spinning you into rocks

Enough said I‚Äôm downvoting every single one of your comments and posts for that.

Thats not really his problem the game is connecting people across the planet for no reason, that shouldnt be happening

I say ruin level 3 isn't worth equipping

Yeah, totally my fault for spamming the button it was just unfortunate, Michael at the end made me laugh though with the salt
---
"It's ya boy, uhhh,,, hot dog water here"
---
From this list, ill agree with monto and puppers, noob is alright, nothing against demi. Ardetha is just one big cringefest for me tho
---
So far all of Feng, head and body for Huntress, and Ace's jacket
---
Not one mention of Zubat? he's too sarcastic sometimes but still a good dbd player.
---
Hes the exact same as ardetha tho, only ardetha has less skill more cringe.
---
I didn‚Äôt need a math lesson today. Holy shit my head hurts.
---
Probably based on the lore they either a) became a killer b) succeeded in escaping,  and in my opinion them being a killer makes more sense since in the notes mr blight scientist found from vigo they didn‚Äôt sound very sane .
---
Rank doesn‚Äôt mean anything. 
---
I really wish there was a way to report this. It's completely unfair to the other people in the game.
---
I mean, i dont like either of them. But yeah, that ardetha kid is literally the cringiest thing to come out of the dbd community. 
---
Thank you very much! XD
---
I tried that "strat" once, its so boring lmao. Lucky for me i havent encountered a moonwalking legion as survivor yet.
---
I play on console and not a lot of people seem to know this. They would do jumping jacks for the opposite reason which caused a lot of misplays and deaths 
---
Killed Meg by accident after the Laurie pulled a first hit DC. (Didnt realize she was DOH.) 
---
30 mins later-and after trying to get the other two to do gens (I even downed them and put them by gens before going afk in basement)- BOTH DC. Guys, why??
---
You could risk placing it on the ground teabagging it then picking it up. They'll realise you have an item and could make the jump in logic
---
Wait are you meaning to reply to someone else? Because I didn't say anything about whether his swiping was consistent or not. I'm so confused.
---
the way you draw males and females next to eachother is giving me vertigo with how much their styles clash.
---
the comic is funny and the art is good but i think you should practice having both genders meet a specific art style instead of having anime crossover with traditional.

Holy shit, my b-hole clenched like a workshop vice
---
I'm so confused. No, he was just a person standing still swiping. Idk why people are reading so much into my comment. He was just deranking.
---
When you include "pallet looping", it comes off as if doing that is toxic.
---
The Nurse‚Äôs lunge is shorter than other killers, so if you are used to a different killer and swinging at the limits of the lunge, you‚Äôll miss.
---
Iron will: im usually really quiet
---
Lightweight: i walk quietly and usually scare people when i sneak up behind them
---
Prove thyself: im always trying to prove thyself even if its pointless
---
Alert: if i even hear a tiny sound my ears perk up and i listen to everything very closely
---
the artist name is literally in the lower lefr corner

Wraith and Nurse cute

Although lately monto's been trying to embrace the 'just a little bit' to much. It's better if he just says it instead of cutting to google translate and stuff like that.
---
The cringe is real in all the key players
---
I hate that Tru3 tunnels like a bitch sometimes. Even other streamers like Monto and Noob3 tunnel when they are having a rough game. Sucks.
---
Jake looks mad he got hooked, Claudette seems surprised she got hooked and ace just looks like he‚Äôs in straight up pain 
---
That might be  the problem, I've heard ranks 20-17 can have rough queues for killers considering you're only supposed to go against really low ranked people. 
---
I'd imagine at Rank 16 things would pick up since Rank 15 is now the bottom floor for the general populace. 
---
Damn those are awesome. I have been wanting to make masks for so long but don't know what to make them out of. 
---
No Zubat or Scot
---
0/10
---
That is one cute claudette ngl
---
Good to see the tip I told everyone after all my end game lobby chats when the game first released is still going strong. 
---
You forgot ECH ECH ECH
---
Yeah, I like noob3's survivor gameplay over his killer gameplay, I think ardetha and puppets are the main one's that do their best to not tunnel
---
True, I always tune into shrinewatch
---
He‚Äôs just so boring and it takes absolutely no skill to be effective with him, it‚Äôs bs
---
WHEN I SEE LEGION I MAKE THE NOISE HUNTRESS MAKES WHEN SHE GETS PALLET STUNNED
---
*ANGRY HUNTRESS NOISES *
---
I know that, OP just posted it without credit originally. He could‚Äôve easily searched up the watermark to find the artist.
---
Huntress is good, but you need good aim. Perks are meh, only Lullaby being decent in certain builds.
---
THANK YOU. People act as if killer is just the easiest  thing to do like throwing a blender into a fish tank and it's really not. I've seen complaints about billy being too strong because he can 1 shot. Like have you tried it? Half the time I just swing my hammer because I miss chainsaw 4/5 times if not more. 
---
what's wrong with Fred? he can't cheese out chases, he doesn't ignore pallets and windows, he's very much loopable, stunable and all that. 
---
You should still get Hag anyway cause she's fun, and free if you save up the iris
---
It seems like you care who he watches at least a little bit
---
They can make this shirt but Behavior can't make a deal for more cosmetics :(
---
My goodness
---
I feel like no0b3 is a more serious streamer/YouTuber but he‚Äôs still enjoyable
---
Yup lol :)
---
Big facts
---
* ANGRY HUNTRESS NOISES*
---
I made this wondering if anyone had ever thought of it.
---
SHE TECHNICALLY DOES WHEN SHE BREAKS A PALLET AFTER THAT
---
There are about half I agree with half I don't but I'm not going to say which half because this is the internet, I will say one hybrid definitely deserve to be there
---
Survivors who waste shack pallet
---
it's funny because only a person with literally no skill can enjoy Legion and I'd imagine they look exactly like this lol guy on the meme. skilled and experienced killer mains despise the fact that you can do so many mistakes and still win every chase.
---
Freddy main btw. and I hate playing as or against Wraith after rework but that's like "me problem", I don't like him, there's nothing wrong with Wraith. 
---
I think you and your ‚Äúlittle brother‚Äù should go back to playing Pok√©mon.  
---
HybridPanda, tru3talent, and Monto are my favorites but honestly everyone is okay except for Ochido. Glad that cancer is gone from the community.
---
Probably camping, tunneling, and having survivors DC right before they die so you don't get credit for a sacrifice.
---
This format is so good! XD
---
*Empathy* - I'm empathic (often to a fault). 
---
*We'll Make It* - I like to help others through their issues (or common issues) and, in stressful situations, make them feel safe, even if I have to fake my own levels of comfort. 
---
*Vigil* - I'm not a fighter, but I am a protective person, watching over those I care for. 
---
*Alert* - I like to think I'm pretty perceptive, able to pick up on small details and notice small sounds and disturbances. 
---
*Dorky thoughts on this:* As a survivor, I'm not particularly mechanically gifted, nor am I very athletic. As a result, I'd be average (at best) at repairs and escaping killer's sight. That said, my altruistic, team-friendly nature would be a boon to my friends, but that would likely be at my expense; I'm a rational person, but if my friend is in trouble, I'm going to forgo logic in order to help them, given the circumstances. My only skill/talent I could rely on to help me avoid the killer would be my fear-driven alertness of my environment. 
---
Being introspective like this was quite challenging and fun. 
---
Just learned that Scott is a giant hypocrit, so no thanks
---
Looks like I found all the insecure people with these downvotes
---
Boston Tea Party is starting to have a ***very*** different meaning
---
Legion
---
I got face camped to shit by a Michael and I loved it because he did it because he was mad at me for looping out his EW3 duration. He just stood there and smacked me with his knife, and at some point after hitting me he decided to turn around for a second and I Deliveranced off right behind his back and looped him some more before he downed me and face camped out the rest of my hook time. 
---
As long as you don‚Äôt force a DC by holding the game hostage, you are not toxic by any means. Put my shoulder on that meat hook, you good hearted killer you. Heck I‚Äôll even crawl towards the basement.
---
Hey I just added u on psn, forgot to do it before lol
---
isn't it a thing where community managers supposed to... like see the posts and maaaaaybe like talk to devs of how the said community still reacts after two months of the killer being out? so maaaaybe they'd think of how to maybe rework their power so the community wasn't so bored/didn't DC so much in the games with this killer and people who like *A E S T H E T I C S* of them would have better games instead of constant dcs? 
---
Spirit &gt; Huntress
---
Leader- I'm the one in my friends group who organizes EVERYTHING.
---
Breakdown- I break everything I touch. I broke a broom once sweeping.
---
Ace in the Hole- I'm a lucky dude.
---
Adrenaline- I'm a resilient motherfucker.
---
Can't go back if I never played, so jokes on you :P  
---
But what does this have anything to do with what I was asking?
---
You know people are different and there are like deffiently people with great skill in the game who enjoy the legion and have fun and dont give a fuck about opposite opinion?
---
got called a "gen camper" yesterday as Spirit. is this a thing? am I not supposed to check gens? 
---
Lmao 
---
Like I said, the I-frames are too much. Phasing through damage is bullshit no matter how you frame it. It would still be good because you could still *dodge* damage, but you wouldn't get a free pass by pressing E.
---
No, he was right, that's Reddit in a nutshell.
---
Where's Marth? 
---
I mean, he appeals to the edgy teens who want to just dominate games I guess?  Aka the kids who just go "huhu I'mma kill all these noobs". 
---
Ahh, I see you're point.  Well, I'm pretty sure I'm one of the only players that even bothers with Nurse on console, so I doubt I'll come across one in PS4, but it's not impossible. Although, I think I'd prefer that over other things.
---
&gt; I really think the issue for a lot of killers is that if they don't get at least a couple of kills, in their mind they lost the match no matter what
---
Probably because the game gives you a big ol "Entity Displeased" if you didn't secure at least two kills, which is as close to the "you failed" as it gets. 
---
I appreciate TydeTyme
---
Also apparently they totally weren't doing gens but hatch spawned
---
methinks OP isn't being honest
---
The joke is that he helped popularize the perk/item swapping bug that was around in December '16 when the devs were already gone for the holidays.  I.e. Chainsaw Myers became a thing.  
---
I think it's worse when people mix it up, so the first half of the game are two people playing merry go round on the hook until they both die. Then you're left with 4 gens left and only one other teammate, who waits for you to die doing the 2nd gen and Urban Evansion to the hatch while you hang on the hook 
---
I'm the survivor in the clip. I just roamed around until I reached the "end" of the map. I fell off the edge and then teleport back to the middle of the map. Super weird, glad Skelahtwo caught it on stream.
---
No Panda? I can't sign on to this
---
This is apparently a thread where other opinions aren't allowed.
---
What do you play on? I'm on ps4,  and I reach red ranks every single time. Even when attempting not too.. &amp; I get this ALL the time. I message and tell EVERY good killer we get gg,  because it's so rare anymore and I want them to know we appreciate people who don't just face camp the entire match. 
---
Man, back when it released it was roughly TWICE AS BIG as the other maps. You think it is bad now? It was grounds for an instant-DC back in the day. Nowadays it is actually a decent map for most killers.
---
Nurse couldn't even blink through some geometry on the map, rendering her useless.
---
*its 
---
OMG JUST LET ME HIT YOU WITH MY STUPID CHAINSAW. I NEVER PLAY THIS STUPID CHARACTER, I JUST WANT MY DAILY AND AT THIS RATE I DONT THINK I EVER WILL AGAIN
---
I dont think youll be disappointed m8
---
DBD HAS BEEN SO FUCKING DRY LATELY. THE EVENT ISNT EVEN THAT GOOD AND THE DEVS HAVE BEEN DRY AS FUCK 
---
I think they've done a pretty good job so far.
---
Took me a sec to realize Billy won Freddy's sweater.
---
The problem there is there's very rarely a difference being the obsession makes, other than telling the killer you likely have DS. If there was an existing element of risk/reward (like totems) or some innate downside to being the obsession, then the argument that it should be stronger makes sense. Without any kind of check on it though outside the RARE killer with Rancor or PWYF, there is no downside to running DS, so it doesn't make sense that it should be stronger (ignoring the case where more than one person has DS, without being the obsession). Most killer obsession perks either punish interacting with the obsession (STBFL, PWYF), or only affect players OTHER than the obsession (Dying Light, Remember Me)
---
I understand where you're coming from, and I agree it would be nice if there was an element of risk to being the obsession--but as of right now, there isn't really anything to warrant obsession perks being stronger than others (really just DS, ignoring the other two survivor obsession perks).
---
PS4. It might just be confirmation bias on your part. You're going to remember those games better than games where it doesn't happen so it might feel a lot more frequent 
---
This.Is.Too.*CUTE*

I wonder how the game will look in one year

Demi is kinda annoying now tbh
---
I really want a Poker Night at the Inventory style game with DBD characters
---
LOL, nope not the case at all. I remember games were I actually have fun a lot more,  but it is RARE anymore especially because of this event. I'll admit this event has tripled the amount,  but it's still a constant thing. Like,  who wants to wait 30 minutes to get a match and them get immediately face camped? 
---
It differs by region, Korean users flap when we need help.
---
True immersion
---
Its 132 not 120. Bloodlust one or two is around 120
---
Full Feng, Ace's head and body
---
Lithe - being 5‚Äô 7‚Äù and 105lbs probably helps.
---
Prove Thyself - I like being around other people in scary situations for ~~hugs~~ moral support.
---
Alert - I have a tendency to be twitchy and take notice of small sounds.
---
Diversion - **PEBBLE** jokes aside, I would rather provide a distraction than get myself caught.
---
I tried.
---
Maybe you should re-examine it, then. It's absolutely not constant. That's absurd.
---
Beating toxicity with toxicity?What an epic gamer 
---
Someone here did a statistics study on this and almost all games have no camping. Like, it's fucking math. 
---
He was afk not them
---
MAYBE NOT FOR YOU! I'm not talking about JUST camping. Did you NOT read the whole post? 
---
What is wrong with you?
---
Lol.
---
Lol. 
---
Dang. Hopefully it gets fixed soon.
---
Twitching = camping 
---
Full reach = gone 
---
This legit made me LOL haha thank you for that
---
There are good days and bad days on PS4.  I've had days when I've eaten 6 facecamps put of 10 games.  And this is rank 1.  I don't BM or run decisive.  Today I had back to back facecamps.  And I'm talking with gens up.  There are quite a number of toxic trash babycamping killers on console.
---
The terror radius does a pretty good job of saying they're best, but a flap when someone is near says come get me better than doing nothing ever could.
---
boo hoo
---
killers in 2016 had to deal with cow tree with NO entity block and no bloodlust
---
and they still got 4k's 
---
learn 2 play
---
132 yeah
---
Man, you took this so insanely personally you had to delete everything 
---
I don't enjoy Noob3 videos... He's prolly one of the most skilled survivors out there but I don't know, when he talks, I find him to be pretty rude and condescending, even pretentious. 
---
The numbers just don't back you up. Someone ran data on 1000 games and found almost no face camping
---
"I still need her to tell me how to do that!"
---
This guy gets it 
---
Those aren't toxic at all.  Super fast to counterplay he needs so much stalk to even make them work.  The only toxic build on Myers is a Scratched Mirror Myers who plays a Lerys offering and camps hook in stalk from behind the wall 
---
Thank you! I also like to watch toxic randoms I play with get smashed after I escape, die, or get farmed. 
---
Probably the fact that people hate being stuck with a Gen Speed debuff until they fail a skillcheck.  That or they're tired of the Tunnel-Me-Freddys, since that's the playstyle that a lot of people use on him for some reason.
---
Dude I know what I've played....it is absurd for you to claim we aren't getting camped.  It happens quite a bit dude.  Today was a good day I only got camped like 3 times.  And I didn't play 1000 games today
---
Phone is blowing up and I'm tired. Over it, down vote away. Maybe I'll make one tmrw you can throw your math at. 
---
Dwight is enjoying that too much
---
I don't give a fuck how ONE persons games turned out,  I know how MY repeat with me,  MY GAMES TURNED OUT. 
---
Hey guys camping doesn't exist because this troll says it doesn't.  Also we never landed on the moon and I suspect ants don't exist.
---
80 percent of games have no camping
---
fuck off survivor main. you're buttmad that you're "muh every game" bs has been proven wrong
---
fucking lol
---
survivor mains hate math because it hurts their widdle feelings

Can I have it.

Yeah this happened to me a few days ago too, a Bill kept going back and forth with the same brick window, I wanna say it was like 6 times pretty quickly before the entity made a noise.
---
I honestly don't have *that* big a problem the Pale Rose map, but man, fuck Grim Pantry. I would rather play on any of the Coldwind farms maps than god damn Grim Pantry.
---
Yes that translates to 1 out of every 5 games like I said.  What happened to your out of a 1000 games there's no camping lol?  1 out of 5 games is a significant numbers.  I said I got camped 3 times today and I played about 17 games.  Checks out.
---
i choose to clean the shrine, who knows, maybe BBQ will finally show up if we do it enough times
---
But the same can be said either way. If you're flapping your arms that means it's safe. Not flapping, unsafe. Both can sound equally correct.
---
That's my having fun build :3
---
lmfao amazing
---
you have fucking evidence that 80 percent of games have no camping and you're still clinging to this delusion that it happens constantly.
---
this is why i take literally nothing survivor mains say seriously, it's all victim complex horse shit
---
simply mind boggling
---
hold up are you really bitching and moaning about being camped 3 out of 17 games?
---
fucking whiny ass pussy
---
Amazing! :D
---
I have to go my people need me 
---
Decisive strike
---
Nice try troll.  I'm a dual rank 1 monthly I'm not a main anything.  Why am I even feeding you still lol?  This is exactly what you're aiming for
---
I like the game. It might not be a brilliant map gameplay-wise, especially as survivor, but the interior enviroment, the completely different aesthetic, the two floor concept and the numerous references to the saw franchise make it one of the most fun and interesting maps, to me at least.
---
Also I prefer ANY map that isn't from MacMillan, Coldwind or Autohaven just because you get those ones so much fucking more than everything else.
---
Wait is that a REAL knife 
---
Keep trolling trolling trolling keep trolling trolling trolling trolling 
---
How about you do gens instead of camping hatch bud
---
Yeah remind me how 90% of maps got abusive loops and shit fixed and conditional "if X window is open Y window will be blocked" stuff, but the main building of the Grim Pantry is like 4 windows surrounded by a ring of pallets?
---
Not toxic but, it isn't kid friendly.
---
Lol yup, that too.
---
It's not my problem either. So he can stop telling me I have 'shit net'.
---
Except that in a huge majority of cases, and time spent on a hook, you AREN'T being camped. It's simpler to signal an issue than flap constantly every time.
---
I agree,
---
Yeah, Adrenaline's stupidly overpowered versus Freddy. It's already one of the most meta perks in the game, why should it fuck Freddy over more than any other killer (especially at the end game when he should be at his strongest)? It should only affect Freddy just as much as any other killer, i.e. remove the free wake up ability. Free wake up, insta-heal, *and* free sprint burst effect is far too much. And before anybody argues for "muh realizm", this game is supernatural killers sacrificing people to a spider god. Realism was thrown out the door a long time ago.
---
Huntress=thick=best killer.
---
Transitive property 
---
I swear with the goofy way I play killer nowadays as well people always think I‚Äôm trying to farm lol kinda makes me angry sometimes
---
Remove Legion from the game. He's a failed concept. Needs a rework from top to bottom.
---
Ugh, you beat me to it!
---
understandable have a good day
---
Lol dude the issue isn't that we don't know the strats to beat legion. The issue is that we don't care because the game isn't fun when you're just mending for most of it.
---
Sweaty post number 20184728
---
Google images wasn't super direct for me either (except in letting me know it was "Sally Smithson")
---
but i got xp?
---
Sounds got fixed so you hear them way before they go off now. The winter ones could catch you by surprise more easily because they were silent as fuck. These ones are also way bigger so you can‚Äôt miss when a survivor has one. 
---
Lol. Yeah.
---
heehee
---
The ideal male form, you may not like it...
---
You a survivor main?
---
I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve just never had a friend or good friend in general, but making fun of eachother is what real good friends do there‚Äôs never any malice with it. Again you would know if you‚Äôve ever had a friend, and yes this is very real. Also simply reading the add-on effects would‚Äôve revealed the redundancy, which he chose not to do so yea dumbass seems appropriate lmao. 
---
Well, I learned the hard way that you can't hook anyone on that hook because of the l√§mp
---
I know who you should choose on your next "make your choice!"
---
I WILL KILL WHOEVER DOWNVOTED THIS POST
---
THE KILLER IS THE HOST, THEY HAVE 0 PING, YOU'RE THE ONE WITH 1200 PING BUDDY, DONT STAY IN LOBBIES WHEN YOU HAVE THAT MUCH PING
---
doesnt make sense considering the main screen of the game is 4 survivors hanging around the fire.
---
[Here's an example](https://youtu.be/0lufjMxLopo?t=06m00s)
---
Grim Pantry no Thanktry
---
Well I'm glad you two found each other...
---
This is perfect! Thank you so much my dude!
---
Can‚Äôt believe no one mentioned Edgar. Hands down my favorite dbd streamer.
---
NM! NM!
---
IM USING THE BATHROOM OK??
---
I think that it‚Äôs a little bit you but mainly them. I am looking at it from the standpoint of they are being horrible people and are starting something but you‚Äôre sort of ‚Äúfanning the flame‚Äù if that makes sense. You need to look at it from the POV that doesn‚Äôt force the conflict to occur. I also feel like you shouldn‚Äôt take what they do as toxic because often times that causes you to become toxic too. It‚Äôs a very influential behavior that‚Äôs takes place a lot in this game. My best recommendation would be to (next time it happens) just say gg or nothing at all and go on with your day this stuff really just comes and goes but if you keep having fun you‚Äôll move on. I‚Äôm not saying that they weren‚Äôt toxic I‚Äôm just saying try to not to fight fire with fire if you know what I mean.
---
BBQ&amp;Chilli with either a survivor pudding or bloody party streamer for killer. Just play normally, no camping, no tunneling just play the game how it was meant to be played
---
No problem! From a match I had a couple nights ago
---
Are they trying to get you to go for the save?
---
WHAT ABOUT PIG???
---
Yeah considering how weak he is, it's a nice bonus you get
---
I had a better idea, you ban streamers that promote it.  Bam, gone, never to be seen again, back to being 40 viewer Andys, bye-bye have fun fake reacting to Resident Evil 2.  
---
I had this happen a few days ago! I just had to cleanse totems, rescue from hooks and search chests. 
---
wtf fucking noob killer tried to kill me
---
HERES A TIP, CLEAN YOUR CONSOLE, AND TAKE BREAKS EVERY OTHER GAME BY TURNING OFF YOUR CONSOLE TO LET IT COOL DOWN, ITS STUPID AND SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE, BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS
---
Rank 1 killers that still use NOED 
---
where is ZubatLEL? can't appreciate the people who teach us to play huh
---
As a rank 1 killer I have never been happier with queue times with the new event. I was finding games within 3 seconds!
---
I genuinely don't understand this mentality. If you're not across the map doing gens, then the killer has literally 0 reason to let someone unhook.
---
You have 2 minutes' worth of time to force a killer away from a first hook before the person on it dies. A generator takes 1 min 20 seconds for one person to complete entirely. If you're playing the game properly, then you win on the spot if the killer camps. Why is it the killer's responsibility to baby you rather than your responsibility to play the game properly and collect a free win?
---
I never save someone if they wiggle on the hook, it's been the camping-signal since forever so not my problem they have their own concept.
---
i love freddy and quite enjoy playing legion (don't use franks and dirt also dont moonwalk) i play these when i need a break from my main that is michael. 
---
I thought escaping with it gave you the max amount of 5000bp anyway?
---
im just gonna leave two german names here. TheKller is super funny and Tithi also makes some pretty fun videos. If you want some non german montages check out Frip Frop hes really good at editing.

isnt noed just a counter to adrenaline? I don't see how its the same as D strike

The Claudette is amazing! Hahahahaha 
---
Neato!
---
Darn
---
love those toxic bois
---
Release killers with literally zero counterplay, feel the backlash.
---
I come back to look at the comment at the end of the day and people downvote, jesus christ lol. The ignorance of some people is amazing.
---
Sorry, just if you don't know, it's "dilemma," this really isn't a moral one, and what's happening is called a "Rashomon" so I can't really tell who is wrong here, but if you've played a lot of other games and only had beef with this one person, you're probably doing alright. 
---
After playing that game for 5 years after release I never would have reckoned that I would ever read that this game does something best. 
---
fuck em. also \*Dilemma
---
*ANGRY HUNTRESS TANTRUM NOISES

I found out about the camping signal not too long after I first started playing. I‚Äôve used it ever since. But it seemed like there was this huge wave of newer survivors a while ago who just don‚Äôt know about this or just use it as a ‚Äúit‚Äôs safe to unhook me‚Äù signal so now I don‚Äôt even know what to expect when I see survivors doing this anymore. And it absolutely sucks because I‚Äôve actually had survivors who signaled they were being camped and it actually saved me from getting downed and lets me know I have time to safely do a gen. I wish more people knew about this. 
---
How you like variable hook, ya, now even little person can use? More cost-efficient!
---
You're kidding, right? Tru3 tends to be as fair as possible when it comes to people getting farmed off the hook in front of his face. It's all dependent on the situation. Also, that's a stupid argument to hate on tru3 because of going after an injured Survivor off the hook is the most logical thing. Not the Killers fault that the unhooked did it in front of the Killers face. 
---
Decisive strike is a free escape when you get outplayed by the killer and lose a chase.  NOED is a free down when you get outplayed by the survivors and lose the objectives you are tasked to defend.  Decisive strike adds an additional hit point to a survivor.  NOED removes an additional hit point from a survivor.  Mirror images of the same crutch.  Also in terms of relating it to Adrenaline.  Adrenaline only saves that single survivor using it while NOED downs all survivors.  Slugging with it can grant multiple kills for a game you lost.  There are strong parallels between both crutches and neither is at all necessary once you learn how to properly play the respective role of survivor or killer 
---
Replace noob with anyone else thanks
---
Wow claudette looks cute 
---
Ohmwrecker is lots of fun to watch.
---
Nah I was just joking. I know there is a fan edit of it but I wasn't reffering to that 
---
Why do you think so? 
---
Yeah order of addons matter.
---
If I had a brown medkit + styptic agent + bandages, this is what the game does
---
(16*0.75)+8 = 20 total chagres
---
However, some people might put it in this order: brown medkit + bandages + styptic agent, which results in
---
(16+8)*0.75 = 18 charges
---
It's not a big difference with small items, but if you are going for maximum efficiency then its a problem I guess
---
&gt; Yeah order of addons matter.

Sorry, sounds like some drunk a-holes, that's not an excuse for them to be abusive and call anybody shit like that though, especially when they gave up. Sorry.
---
dbd has never been so immersive!
---
Because everyone's salty about everything. So even a simple choice such as liking a killer (I fucking hate legion btw) means you can get down voted
---
I love playing against Leatherfaces and Billy's. 
---
Absolutely. The map knowledge you gain from it, especially when playing solo, is tremendous.
---
Completely agree. It's a great perk because as you said it does tell you where the killer is most of the Game. Although the perk is rendered useless when playing with friends. 
---
The perk is especially good combined with perks such as WGLF and We'll Make It.

---
Not sarcasm at all.
---
I have the same problem. Thats why I try to not use too many hex perks. After the update where they made better totem spawns I had a totem spawn in the middle of nothing. Just in the middle of the map on asylum. kinda made me feel bad tho.
---
WHERE'S FENG
---
Time for a hog squeezer boys
---
Only a 10 when you have to spend a minute looking for the hatch, only to find the last survivor sitting on it just waiting for the opportunity to tbag you before jumping in. 
---
Mfw I checked the twitch page and only saw Killer main streams. 
---
*thinking intensifies*
---
People do this and then rage in chat that you didn't save them. Well then don't do it your in red ranks common man
---
Uhh... I assume you haven't tried the new Spies From The Shadows? Every time someone disturbs a bird you get a visual and audio notification... It can drive you mad and confuse you.
---
That meta Zzzzzzzz
---
It‚Äôs trapper
---
howdy
---

---
Yes, a killer will tunnel the obsession until down, get decisive striked, survivor will escape, killer will come to reddit to complain, it‚Äôs a cycle
---
Unlucky
---
Imagine someone being good at the game makes them toxic. If youre triggered by someone knowing how to loop/run tile sets well,hit flashlight saves,and yada yada..i think youre into the wrong game m8...maybe try civ5
---
There doesn't seem to be a cap on it, or if there is it's way more than 5K. I've had games where I held the vessel the entire game and escaped with it and received 20K bonus points.
---
but it's not lobby dodging that should be punished is it?
---
its leaving survivors behind when the trial has started.
---
Sure... I have a few things Im keeping taps on BHVR for.
---
0. BHVR's Map making Team is too small, the game needs way more maps, but most team expansion has happened in the Cosmetic Department it seems.
---
0.5 More Map types, New Maps that offer different game modes.
---
1. Freddy Rework is taking its sweet ass time.
---
2. Hatch Rework is taking its sweet ass time.
---
3. DS Rework is taking its sweet ass time.
---
4. Survivors can see outside of Lockers when inside, they don't work like in the first Intro.
---
5. Many perks require serious rework to even compete with newer, more attractive perks.
---
6. So many addons needs rework since they go unused cause they are not attractive enough.
---
7. A Lot of Killer Powers needs to be adjusted, made more fun to use and play against.
---
8. A Lot of Game Mechanics needs a serious slapping to make the game more enjoyable.
---
9. The Community generated Killer project anonymous submitted which we vote on democratically and submit to BHVR for creation, promised so long ago.
---
I guess this turned out to be more of a list of things BHVR needs to get sorted, hopefully this year.
---
wow that huntress was angry
---
waaaait a minute....
---
if someone unhooks behind killer's back that is not tunneling. that is punishing the team for farming cause with dead teammate they will be weaker.
---
why would you need the Class Photo if you want to tunnel? you do realise that tunneling is following one player in sole purpose to kill them disregard others bodyblocking or just doing gens? you don't need Class Photo for that lol. 
---
and Dying Light is extremely viable with any killer. -25% to gens and healing, yes, please. it doesn't lessen the skillchecks, man. you still wake up. 
---
what you called tunneling is teammates' fault. 
---
to Knock Out I dunno. it's good for first down, if everyone in your team is not a potato, you'll get over it. 
---
and Fred is not the best tunneler, he can't be, love. because to actually down someone he still needs to work around pallets, windows and everything, he doesn't have the speedy speed, doesn't ignore obstacles. Legion is the best tunneler cause he can even cheese out the chase just by looking down or moonwalking. like damn, why do you say all this about Fred?
---
the fact that he can't fully lose the chase is different. he still needs to catch up to you with 115 speed and still needs to deal with all the game's mechanics. 
---
he has the potential for long tunneling which hurts him, my guy. cause gens pop, people get healed, people wake up. 
---
Survivor is the same thing generally....
---
That's literally just rude. A game isn't suposed to make people mad or stressed. And Legion and Clown are literally kigs at that.
---
true
---
But then games crushes to much for this to work.
---
72hrs if you are old , the best one tho
---
I mean his proposition would do that as a side effect. Streamers that rely on DbD footage for income woukd be hit pretty hard by a ban even for just a few hours. That means their stream for tonight is over.
---
You seem awesome! If you‚Äôre on PlayStation you should team up with me sometime. 
---
I know right, she's adorable and I love her
---
Poor widdle man doesn't like a game mechanic that is supposed to be partly stressful 
---
Freddy drinking the Thompson moonshine 
---
which means 50% of your team DC'd which may have been a less confusing way to phrase this.
---
She insults her viewers, deranks on purpose, bullies new players. That isn't the things a skilled player does. 
---
It's easy to hit flashlight saves against a rank 10, I bet she can't do shit at rank 1.
---
They probably didn't expect this game to have a bunch of weirdos that really want to see a ghost with a bell fuck a ghost with a pillowcase over her head.  
---
Yeah. I've gotten so much hate and ragequits solely for playing him (wasn't being toxic, no moonwalking, no blood tracking). I also like how there's hate on both sides, like when killers are complaining that Legion's too weak, and survs are crying about how OP he is. 
---
The truth is, he could be quite annoying to play against, yeah. But it truly depends on the person who's playing him. I wish people could just stop whining. 
---
I TRY TO PLAY WRAITH WITHOUT CAMPING BUT SOME PEOPLE WHO CROUCH AROUND THE HOOK GO FOR THE SAVE AS SOON AS THEY HEAR TERROR RADIUS FADE AWAY
---
BITCH I MIGHT BE INVISIBLE, BUT I'M STILL HERE. HAVE SOME GODDAMN PATIENCE AND LET ME LEAVE
---
neat video, but kind of flawed, because it only covers one extremely niche form of camping, while camping has a lot of different other scenarios, what if the gates are already open? what if the survivor has a sliver of hook health left and you're already nearby? what if the survivors are hookrushing right in front of you as soon as you hook? and you seemed to strictly camp ignoring securing 4ks, like when 2 players are left. the specific example of face camping no matter what the situation with leatherface is pretty braindead I agree, but it all depends on the scenario, there are some situations where it IS beneficial, lets do some quick maths, if 5 gens are left, and you have 2 survivors in the basement, there is absolutely no reason for you to leave if you are intending to truly kill as many survivors as possible, the 2 other survivors cannot complete enough gens in time to get gate with the 2 mins it takes survivors to die on hooks because a gen takes 80 seconds, its a guaranteed hatch game, which you can work to turn into a 4k, most gens they'll get done is 2 MAYBE 3 if they're god tier and made of magic.  
---
wait... your own data even shows the majority of survivors died not lived, this literally proves the opposite of what you're claiming... oh... you think bloodpoints is the "real" win condition... lmao
---
What?
---
He constantly praises the people he goes against.
---
He's a toxic survivor main who doesn't deserve the attention he gets. Also WHY ARE PEOPLE NOT MENTIONING HEXY????? YA BOI KEVIN DESERVES ALL THE LOVE HE GETS!
---
When I play killer I do it only for my daily objectives. And I always let the survivors have a good game since I don't bother being a really bad killer due to the first person view :')
---
I agree! It's by far my favorite aura reading perk, specially with that unlimited range. It's incredible how much info you can get from a wounded teammate. 
---
It's not underrated, I think. It's just there are too many good/great perks to choose from. I used Empathy/Bond for a long time, but then swapped it for We'll make it, because I think healing teammates faster helps me to survive better than knowing where injured teammates are and whether or not they're being chased.
---
Shoutout for ya boi Hexy!
---
I DO THAT ALL THE TIME, I DON'T LIKE WAITING EITHER, BUT 1 MINUTE IS A GOOD TIME TO GO TO THE BATHROOM OR GET WATER FROM KITCHEN
---
THAT 1 MINUTE BETWEEN MATCHES IS MY 'ME TIME'. 
---
Are you dumb 
---
How about that final act remove itself if you successfully hurt one survivor or down a survivor? 
---
Pretty sure he‚Äôs screaming.
---
I'm jumping on this bandwagon
---
RemindMe! 1 year
---
Most of the streamers are garbage. Very strange people which reflect a very strange community.
---
Monto is good, Tru3 is ok (but he can be arrogant even though he doesn't realise it)
---
Zubat is a good player, but his sarcasm is repetitive and his token phrase "unlucky" really cringes me out.
---
JenDenise is a self-entitled compulsive liar and she de ranks because she doesn't want to get outplayed in front of her stream on higher ranks.
---
I like Rhyaree because she doesn't take things seriously and is a good player without being a try hard.
---
It does indeed. When you are new at the game and you need to practice maps or get scared too easily when the killer is nearby, then this perk is perfect.
---
I used to use it a lot as well! It just helped me to calm down because I saw when someone lured the killer into my direction, or when they were on another side of the map. Also helps for healing daylies though.
---
But eventually I'm gonna move away from this perk, because I got used to the killer and don't that "fear" anymore. So I can switch it out for balanced landing for example to play a bit more "aggressive".
---
But that being said, I you play Evasion, this is a good perk
---
John isn‚Äôt gonna be happy that Amanda is smoking 
---
not what Ive seen
---
I liked Empathy the best but then I tried Bond and since you can see everyone (in a shorter radius, sure) I like that one slightly better. I leveled Dwight up last you see. He's not Bond material.
---
u/BrickyOrchid8
---
I ACTUALLY NEVER PLAY DURING EVENTS. ANYTHING LIKE DOUBLE BP OR EXTRA POINTS FOR ANYTHING BRINGS OUT THE WORST FROM PEOPLE FROM BOTH SIDES.
---
FUCK IT, I CAN TAKE A 2 WEEK BREAK INSTEAD OF PLAYING VS DOUBLE ASSHOLERY EVENT 
---
I'D LIKE TO PLAY ME SOME DBD, BUT I WAS BURNED DURING LAST 4 EVENTS AND I'M NOT EVEN GONNA LOG IN DURING THIS ONE 
---
People who don‚Äôt look this game up on the internet and just play could never guess that flapping means camping. They do it because in real life, when someone needs help, they wave their arms to signal for help or to flag someone down who can help them. Too many times i‚Äôve sat motionless on the first hook of the game only for every player to sit doing gens and let me die or reach struggle thinking someone else will do it. When your motionless and no one is coming to help you you just want to raise your arms to say ‚Äúone of you, get off ur ass and save me!‚Äù Otherwise ur left with regret and think ‚Äúif only i was able to tell them no one was coming for me so this could be prevented‚Äù
---
This place prefers downvotes cuz it's an extension of the fog.
---
AH YES A FELLOW MAN OF CULTURE 
---
but Mr. Ent gave me a hall pass...
---
LOL. YOU WANT KILLER TO NOT PUNISH YOU FOR YOUR OWN MISTAKES AND THEN YOU CLAIM THAT HE'S THE ONE THAT WANTS THE EASY MODE?
---
OH GOD THE IRONY
---
My main squad is Ardetha, Tru3, No0b3, Hexy and ANGRYPUG. They all have familiar peronalities and that makes the whole group fun to watch.
---
It has been REVOKED!
---
you don't understand, tunneling is more than a single chase, its all the chases required to kill someone, class photo is great for tunnelling because if you find any survivor at all, you've also found the survivor you're looking to tunnel by seeing their specific outline. and I know hitting a survivor after their teammate farmed them isn't really tunnelling, but that's what people would call it anyways so idk
---
My posts get downvoted for saying anything even remotely positive about survivors so yes I'll downvote anyone that defends legion or nurse. 
---
As a fellow gay, I know what you feel bro. Sorry about your experience. Calling someone the F-word requires little to no brain cells. 
---
Oh look, a Kung Fu Panda! Please have my upvote!
---
Big no on Noob3
---
CAN YOU MAKE ONE WITH HUNTRESS THANKS THIS IMAGE IS NOW MY PROFILE PICTURE
---
I WENT TO TAKE A PISS, SORRY MATE, WONT HAPPEN AGAIN!!
---
**whimpering intensifies**
---
I KNOW IT'S NOT A FUN GAME, BUT TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM DERANKING YOU CAN JUST DO SOME GENS AND STAND ABOVE THE BASEMENT TO BE IN HIS TERROR RADIUS TO GET THE EMBLEM, GOLD IN OBJECTIVE, IRIDESCENT IN SURVIVAL AND SILVER IN EVADER SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO PIP/BLACKPIP WITHOUT BENEVOLENT 
---
WAY TOO MUCH
---
It's his girlfriend you simpleton 
---
One time i was just not able to struggle, had DS as well but it just never procc‚Äôd
---
ACTUALLY I'M SURPRISED HE COULD CONNECT TO A LOBBY WITH THAT HIGH OF A PING.   
---
IT USUALLY TAKES A GOOD MINUTE OR TWO TO JOIN TO THE LOBBY AND  THEN I'M DCING BEFORE I COULD READY UP IF THE PING IS ABOVE 300MS MOST OF THE TIMES.
---
I ACTUALLY DON'T MIND THEM NOW THAT THEY AREN'T BURNING MY EYES IN REAL LIFE. THE FLASHLIGHT SURVIVORS ARE USUALLY NOT DOING GENS ANYWAY
---
I dont know, but look at the control tips at the bottom of the screen, literally ps4 buttons.
---
Siiiiiiiiiick dodge, bruh! Did you post it?
---
ITS MOSTLY ABOUT P3 CLAUDETTES WITH BUILT IN FUCKING INVISIBILITY CLOAK STOLEN FROM HARRY POTTER
---
YOU COULD HAVE JUST LEFT THROUGH THE GATE
---
Yes it's my match. That Billy only used his chainsaw to get around the map the whole match. Never used it to down anyone. He was easy to dodge
---
Man sometimes for you to understand you just need to have a life. :)
---
Lol I'm a Michael main and I get rekt by michael
---
Ochido?...                  ...\*Curb your enthusiasm theme\* for every dumb idiot who dont get it... ITS A JOKE! There
---
Agreed
---
"Is vat a morehh?"
---
Zubat is just lucky 
---
Okay, next time you see them, just put an Ebony on and enjoy the salt.
---
No but seriously now. When people are cocky and they Tbag, just to humiliate you, they shouldn't complain when you say something toxic as "gg ez". 
---
Them calling you "one of the worst killers on console" is just a confirmation that they obviously couldn't beat you and are super mad about it. Of course it's not nice to say gg ez in my opinion, but it's not a bannable thing, nor is it harassment. My god, you could facecamp them with Leatherface if you'd be in the mood and you would still play by the rules (your own moral decision though). 
---
To wrap it up, those are just salty survivors and even if I think they won't learn out of it, I think they deserved the gg ez (even if you fight fire with fire there)
---
No, it is power. /s
---
That's pretty perfectly timed to be an accident. I don't think so.
---
But she was probably just doing it for laughs, everybody knows locker DC's have a bunch of stupid-looking glitches. With it happening at the end of the game like this, the killer only lost out on something like 2 maliciousness emblem and ~1750 bloodpoints (after BBQ). All in all pretty harmless, unlike when someone ruins a whole fucking match by going down in the first 30 seconds and rage DC'ing.
---
What if his internet genuinely went down? You can't re-join games you get DC'd from like other titles, so there would be now way of knowing that they completely abandoned intentionally. Especially if you were doing so well.
---
And some of the most toxic players in the community 
---
So much this.
---
When DeviB goes spooky myers on Rhyaree, the world is a better place. 
---
So underrated, I always run it if I‚Äôm not running DS. It‚Äôs so good for avoiding the killer, getting flashlight/pallet saves, healing..
---
Claudette can be pretty much invisible. Here she was not. The LF was completely blind
---
Are you stupid? How is it my mistake if my teammates don't know when to unhook? You got to be damn fucking stupid if you think that.
---
A shame Sat, Cartoonz and Delirious don't play more, I loved watching the 4 of them just messing up and screwing with one another.
---
forsen1 any bajs? 
---
From what I've seen tru3 only goes after an injured survivor if he's doing poorly that game and only when they get unhooked right in front of him (and even then he apologizes saying something like "sorry, but you got farmed mate"). If he's playing from ahead he intentionally doesn't tunnel. 
---
Frank was a customer at the videostore where Jeff was working. He asked Jeff to draw the logo for the Legion (the one you see on the wall in Ormond). So they indeed know each other. Or at least used to.  The entity could probably mess up your memory somehow.  
---
Imagine being scared by pixels LUL
---
It depends on the logic you're using tbh
---
Shes been at rank 1 numerous times m8...try harder to be a hater...
---
I wish. I forgot to add them and now I'm sad
---
I do. I work and play games. I know stress and you seemed to be bitching about two characters who are not in any way different to other killers
---
Totems
---
YOU DO KNOW THAT YOU PLAY AS A TEAM? BLAME THE GUY MAKING THE MISTAKE, NOT THE OPPOSITE TEAM FOR PLAYING RIGHT.
---
KILLER IS THERE AS MUCH AS YOU TO WIN. HE IS NOT YOUR BABYSITTER TO ENSURE ALL 4 SURVIVORS HAVE GOOD FUN. HE'S THE DAMN ENEMY
---
IF KILLERS DON'T PUNISH MISTAKES THEN SURVIVORS ARE GONNA KEEP MAKING THEM
---
ALSO IF SOMEBODY FARMS YOU, HE'S THE ASSHOLE, NOT ME. ILL TRY TO KILL HIM, BUT YOU'RE GONNA WAIT ON THE GROUND UNTIL I'M DONE. GO AHEAD, COMPLAIN NOW HOW SLUGGING IS ANOTHER "BAD KILLER TACTIC" 
---
ALSO. WHAT IS SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND WITH THE RULES OF RAGE THREADS. SPEAK THE FUCK UP. YOU'RE MAKING ME THINK THAT YOU'RE NOT THAT BRIGHT, AFTER 3 DIFFERENT PEOPLE MENTIONED IT 
---
To me nurse is just a bit harder to master because of frame rate drops on Xbox. Also I have my sensitivity set to 100 and I still feel the turning is too slow honestly. 
---
But you don't solve any problems acting toxic nor reduce the amount of toxic players, do you? Not to be an ethics professor of anything, but I don't think this is how it works. It's your right, though. 
---
Did you fix your internet yet?
---
Hmm hmmm hmmmmmm hmm. Hmmm hmmm hmm hmmmm hmmmmmmmmm.
---
I enjoy freddy because those are very rare and hard to come by.
---
I agree. But sometimes I can't tell if its still sarcasm or not. 
---
Man you got bullied recently? If you are so shit you cant deal with the above just derank to 15 sounds like you belong there. 
---
No I‚Äôm replying to you. You seem to think that someone is literally repeatedly swiping at the air for the whole game. I‚Äôm trying to tell you that it‚Äôs highly unlikely someone is doing that, it‚Äôs a bot. 
---
Good player != Toxic. 
---
Even when they're doign their "toxic" videos, it's some of the least "toxic" gameplay I've seen. But then again, I don't consider using perks and items that are in the game as "toxic". 
---
No one is saying that the killer is or isn‚Äôt trying to derank, that‚Äôs irrelevant. We‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs someone using a bot/auto clicker, not someone standing still all game swiping at thin air. 
---
I KNOW RIGHT?! FINALLY SOMEONE WITH THE SOLUTION 
---
I respect your opinion and I am happy that you found a killer you enjoy, but I don't share that opinion.
---
Every time I get a Legion game and see the first guy get hit I feel stressed out already. The problem about Legion is (at least for me), that he is way too fast in the chasing and can vault as fast as you can. That makes it really hard to effectively loop this killer, nor do you have a real chance to escape him if he tunnels you, because he will catch up eventually. If a Legion is also running NOED in the end it's super frustrating, because you made your way through the game with that annoying killer and you get insta downed, just because he ran super fast disabled his ability manually and gave you an easy hit. 
---
Anyway, this is just my humble opinion and I know there are people that can actually counter Legion and I know there are enough people who enjoy him. I simply don't and this is my right
---
Usually by his tone I guess
---
same
---
Because their argument is terrible
---
I mean other similar streamers that were named got downvoted to oblivion, so according to your logic most of the people in this thread care about who others watch
---
The play and pause button in the bottom left corner looks like the video viewer on ps4
---
Then you rarely play against swf.
---
Had a match where they always tried to safe the person I hooked immediately. So, basically I was chasing them around the hook and prevented them from saving this guy (because why would I give them a free unhook if they literally run in my face). The thing here is, why would I be punished by a slower dying speed, if I didn't even intended to stay close to the hook and why would I even get a BP penalty for that?
---
Spirit took Fire Up
---
Play anything else than Legion, i won't kill myself on hook vs you. 
---
I'm not playing vs that bullshit.
---
Happened to me the other night on console. I was the killer amd my internet was pinging high and it said all the survivors left at omce so i finished the match with like 10,000 bloodpoints for 4 dcs. Then I disconnected from the game. Totally not a intentional thing. 
---
No they won't
---
I mean the killers in the game. The game isnt supposed to be easy you cant always win. It seems like some arguements are pretty hypocritical the same people that complain about killer types will loop a killer the hole match. Its the salt of the earth. 
---
I never downvote Legion players. I save all my downvotes for Nurse players ez
---
Maybe I'm wrong, I just think it was sweaty and I think there's a difference between a build only an SWF can **maybe** escape from and one that's more fair to the **four other people you're playing with** 
---
-AND- 
---
I almost wish there was a way to kill yourself IN-GAME because I can totally see why people would resort to DCing in order to let someone escape (That sounds like a really really stupid perk but I look forward to people naming and doing art for it ex: "I'm too old for this shit" with a picture of Old Danny Glover, it'll be part of the Lethal Weapon cross-over with that gun everyone wants). 
---
-And-
---
Frankly hooking the second-to-last survivor would've saved 7 minutes and that's both sweaty AND stupid because **there's no way getting the last survivor is worth 7 minutes of bloodpoints**.
---
-AND-
---
No that doesn't mean the survivors should've just given up, there are four of them to kill and hooking the penultimate one just means you'll probably BOTH have A CHANCE to escape in Sudden Death Overtime **as the game devs clearly intended.**
---
 
---
If sweaty slugging's your thing you guys should probably consider that, I don't think mathematically or salinicly it's worth it: 
---
Again, maybe I'm wrong, you can judge for yourselves: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/377060608 The video doesn't have the killer's name but, yes, there was also tier 3 NOED, just in-case.
---
This game is about brutally murdering innocent people. I wouldn't say it's very kid friendly at all
---

Yes, it was mentioned either in a dev stream or announcement spoiler implying that the characters come from different times, some more modern or ancient than others.

I dunno sometimes I post things I think are gold and it doesn't go anywhere, it depends on the time posted and who sees it and all these other factors, so if you do I hope it does well (I think it's tops) but if it doesn't it's not you, this subreddit is a fickle fog machine.

A FELLOW SURVIVOR IN A MATCH MESSAGED ME AFTER HE DC'D TO TELL ME I WAS SHIT BECAUSE "I SHOULD WAIT UNTIL THE KILLER IS FURTHER AWAY TO UNHOOK." LIKE DUDE, I HAVE BORROWED TIME. I CANT HELP THAT THE KILLER HIT YOU TWICE AFTERWARDS. PLUS YOU DC'D AND RUINED THE MATCH FOR THE OTHER SURVIVORS. I AM NOT A PLEB, YOU ARE!

You sound like one of those insane fighter pilots before they hit a mountain
---
*Peeves about the game itself:*
---
The disparity between SWF and solo survivor. I feel like SWF with voice coms have such a huge advantage over we solo queue bois who have to communicate via finger points and arm waving.
---
In-game physics.  Latency and hitboxes make everything feel weird. It's like you have to do everything before you think you need to, pallet drops dead hard etc
---
*Peeves about the fan base:*
---
The 'whiny toxic entitled survivor main' meme.  There are some entitled-ass killer mains out there, but so much of the memeology portays killer mains as non-toxic zen masters of game balance lel
---
*Peeves about BHVR:*
---
They have a habit of announcing things and backing off. DS Changes, Hatch changes, Freddy rework, "optimization pass" etc. Remember how long we waited for Wraith buffs?  
---
They still haven't ported WET to Steam (But maybe I should also blame Bethseda for that? :thinking: )
---
Hexy and angrypug does, but I'm pretty sure they are not similar to true and noob. Might be just me

knock yourself out, you should be punished for it though with something like a 5 min timer that increases with every DC within a set number of time for screwing over 4 other people's because you want to be selfish and throw a tantrum.

A lot of these perks are really cool, I'd run surveillance a lot because I love having a ton of information. 
---
And could you imagine franklins demise with the already fun combo of plunderers and ace in the hole? &lt;3
---
As if he was the most OP thing in the game. 
---
I think it's moreso that people are downvoting the people who try to justify why playing legion is okay for both sides. Taking the salt out of the equation legion is just purely unfun.
---
Both sides, killers and survivors, as a majority don't have fun in legion matches. He is a braindead killer who is actually quite weak, but has zero counterplay and ensures that whoever he chases goes down with little to no skill. If he had some sort of counterplay then people's opinions would be different. 
---
It happens to me pretty frequently, too. Although I'm using WiFi, I can notice the occasional 2-3 second spikes where a survivor runs into a wall. It will only occur maybe once a game and it's not that noticeable, unless I'm in chase. The shitty thing is when it happens right after I get stunned or looped so the survivors are convinced I'm switching.   
---
To all the survivors I've 2 hit while they stand still ... I'm sorry. It's not you, ... it's my ISP.
---
And why would you do that??
---
Haha egsdee ez duuud
---
Just talked to the densest guy on Reddit AMA!

Actually he does...
---
and lo david's search for some bread started...
---
I think the sound of damaging generators and breaking pallets should be reduced... There is no reason for them being so loud and it's tinitus inducing.
---
Flashlights are still amazing, it takes more than 0 brain cells to use now 
---
Feng.. what happened 
---
Here come the trappeeeer
---
If you're playing SWF with good communication it's almost useless, but if you're playing solo empathy can be amazing. Empathy combined with Sprint Burst and a flashlights let you sit on a generator for as long as possible before running in at the last second for the save.  
---
Wir k√∂nnen gerne auf deutsch weiterschreiben, oder bist du Hurensohn zu dumm um ne zweite Sprache zu sprechen/schreiben? 
---
I would not say it's shit, even if your teammates are bad. The perk still provides all the information mentioned above. How you want to work with this information - up to the survivor who is running it. 
---
I consider myself a good killer, i never T bag as the killer.
---
If he wants the 4K he can get it, who cares about "respect"?
---
I faced some poor Huntress who didn't k ow how to put away hatchets, poor baby
---
I demmand papa jake
---
Only disconnects, exploits, holding a game hostage, hax bug exploits etc can get you banned
---
It's kind of similar to those guys that used to defend Freddy and argumented that he's not a bad killer if you "play him right", and by that they meant tunneling.
---
Pretty cool.
---
You brought up some painful memories.
---
Holy Myers that is AMAZING! 
---
Ochildfiddler
---
why did you record it like this
---
Honestly, any hex totem is not worth equipping ever since their "fix".. well I take that back, Haunted Ground is but i stopped running them since they'd be render useless in under a minute basically wasting a perk spot. So between SWFs and now they just seem to spawn in the most obvious and not hard to spot location.. don't even waste the slot 
---
Good news and bad news for you my friend.  
---
Good News: It seems to be nearly entirely random how much someone is penalized, looking at other posters in this thread you'll get a mix of "Me too RIP", and "I prestiged everyone and got to keep most of my characters" so it's a coin toss how much you'd be penalized for this.  
---
Bad News: It is entirely random. I don't know how many times you buy scratch off tickets, but if your luck is bad then you find yourself getting screwed by the penalty.  
---
With all this said, I wish you the best of luck and hope you come out on top.

The acquiring of any in-game skin through anything other than official channels (ie. codes, giveaways, etc.)
---
The possession of legacy skins without earning them. The cutoff to earn legacy skins happened on November 24, 2016. If a player has obtained legacy skins after this date, then it is considered cheating.¬†

Well, if it's any consolation. I'm still grinding her for discordance. I did want nurses, but the rest was what I noticed as I looked for just tier 1 discordance. She has 2 pages of tier 3 perks and I haven't seen that yet.

I had the same problem in the same spot XD
---
Did they not already do that exact change to wraith already? I remember he got a buff not too long ago and think it was along those lines. Can't remember the specifics though.
---
See my flair.
---
You cucked your teammate hard.If you hid behind the gen you might have been able to save and she would have been saved by adrenaline.
---
How often do you get killers who say something along the lines of  "gg ez" or "LUL u all ded now"  There's toxic people on both sides but I run into a lot more toxic survivors.  I very rarely run into toxic killers.
---
I meant to reply to the comment below this one lol that mentions how LOL punishes dodges and dcs 
---
This is beautiful! Might use it to replace the Nurse bot in a discord server I‚Äôm in!

ur saying blow me like u think i wont

It happened when i played survivor. I watched the streamers VOD and it showed the window blocked but it was open for me. So i vaulted it and  the streamer was very confused 
---
The problem I have is I'm trying to play a lot more killer but I keep getting matched up with p3's when I was at rank 15 like 20 days after the reset

But... what does that have to do with F13. It just sounds like you don‚Äôt like the shirt

You're just supposed to make cofee for anyone, not killing people! That would be illegal.

True, but trust me the numbers would significantly drop.

"I'm not camping, I'm just kicking the gen!"

These are my tactics aswell as someone else further down thread. Good for lower ranks if nobody aint getting ya.

Oh thank you I never knew

you are the only person on this sub with any taste

Honestly, as much as I hate to join the hate legion bandwagon it's true. Mending and 20 second chases with franks is boring. I honestly don't care about escaping that much (ranks bullshit anyway) but I do want to have a fun time
---
YOINK 
---
I have no problem with Freddy
---
Briccy 
---
Boy do I got some news for you
---
I wouldn't say 0, a lot of killers recently have been chill and will just let you survive (but if it's a tryhard legion with franks, GG)
---
‚Äúsorry, i dont speak broke‚Äù
---
He had plenty of time to walk around where you came from while you weren‚Äôt looking, you looked way right before he came around the corner
---
I had that with Nurse!  Wanted Shadowborn, got lvl 1, then the next web, 2, then I got the 3rd!  
---
Bricc?
---
Do what I do, finish a gen and if he kills u suicide and move to the next one
---
Did you go so far away from the screen so it wouldn't be cut by your vertical recording instead of recording closer horizontal? I just need a yes or no.
---
I saw him once
---
I‚Äôm not followed but I saw him
---
I have seen most people do it the other way around
---
I haven't thought about it,  but he really does seem to *punish* some of the more meta perks doesn't he? Exhaustion perks and self care mainly. I wonder if they has anything to do with the extreme hate. 
---
The purpose of the post was not to show amazing gameplay but to show us that he got some justice for getting teased by the Nea.
---
I have an Xbox console friend who is just a swf menace and I just give her all my event items.
---
Man I shitted myself when I had a meg run to me with the legion mask
---
You use them when they are breaking pallets or picking up a survivor, not throw it randomly while being chased
---
Thats correct. If theyre running sprint burst or balanced landing you can easily catch up to them with your power. Also borrowed time and such are basically useless against legion.
---
Go get a life retard
---
It's the second time I see someone posting about this and it happened to me too. Same map, same building, jumping off and then getting hit and teleporting back when killer picks you up. Seems similar to the basement bug where you couldn't get out of the basement.
---
Can I ask what build you use?  :3
---
I‚Äôm all for fairness, as much as can be done in an asymmetrical game. For starters, maybe we can allow DCs when someone is hooked, but their avatar stays and the killer gets the hook points instead of the crappy ragequit bonus. Especially if he‚Äôs been looped like a n00b for most of the game. I‚Äôm not bitter, I promise ;)
---
They can make it so if you‚Äôre in a chase it resumes the normal dying speed. Kinda like how if you have a pig party hat ü•≥ the timer is paused when you are getting chased. Same concept. Or ya know, you could just deal with it and knock them down again......as the game intended. 
---
So if you have both add-ons either lose the add-on on death or lose the add-on upon opening the lock you‚Äôll keep the other add-on. So if you die with both add-ons on the key, you‚Äôll only lose the weaved ring and keep the key and the milky glass. Vice versa as well. If you have both add-ons and open the hatch, you‚Äôll only lose the milky glass and keep the key and the weaved ring. 
---
It's the same thing when a 700 ping killer says ez in end game chat for hitting you in complete bullshit situations lol
---
Tfw you were there by sheer coincidence and book it across the map but the killer still thinks you're there and hard patrols around the hook looking for you.
---
Ace's is the only one that's kinda incorrect, he should be smiling.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I do most of the time

What the fuck? Yes he is

Legion has reduced terror radius 
---
Finally, a fellow member of the Urban Evasion master race
---
No Nea is Susie
---
True only really tunnels if he absolutely has to. He wants to have fun, yeah, but he wants to win. If they survivors are completing gens extremely quickly (to which he admits that nothing is wrong with that since that is the objective) and he is on the verge of all four escaping, why wouldn‚Äôt you? You need someone dead to start applying more pressure. It makes no sense to go and chase a non-hooked survivor around some long loops just to be Mr. Nice Guy. Next thing you know, all are hooked maybe once at best and you‚Äôre getting teabagged at the exit gates. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs arrogance, it‚Äôs just being confident in your ability and many people confuse that. It‚Äôs not like he puts himself above other streamers, Besides, would you not say you have good skill if you made it to rank 1 killer amd survivor with no perks and addons? Reached rank 1 with no mither? These are sizable achievements man. Of course, I respect that if after everything you still don‚Äôt like him, but I just want to add in my thoughts.
---
Finally a Nea that i can get behind.

I love noob3, his content is just great

He is to you. He isn‚Äôt to me.

Hey! MW here. Long time no see, glad to be back here. I'm always thinking what if the Pinhead were in DBD killer member. He's pretty cool character and he don't have his own game right now so...maybe we have a chance to get him in DBD? I don't know.

It's a costume he uses at one point in the first movie with an obnoxious amount of makeup on meant to be used for "polite settings". The makeup makes his face look completely white.
---
What? So you are fine with 30-40 minute hatch standoffs and overpowered perks?
---
When i get somebody being hyper toxic, they DC 99.9% of the time i down them right before i hook them.  I never even get the chance to be toxic back :c
---
hmmm

hatch standoffs only exist if you let them happen... they are a non-issue

His videos are boring, his voice isn‚Äôt pleasant to listen to, and this is more across the board for all content creators; making videos with the premise of ‚ÄúWatch me make this person DC look how funny it is to frustrate someone else‚Äù is boring content. 
---
He‚Äôs just not entertaining to watch. 
---
Different survivor actions have different meanings.  
---
Spamming struggle to wave your hands on the hook means "The Killer is camping me"
---
Not struggling means "The Killer is away and its safe to save me"
---
Clicking Flashlights means "my team mate is trying to save the guy on the hook, go stop him!"
---
Tbaging means "Camp me please"
---
You were just doing what he asked for.
---
End game builds are builds that just give you more strength at end game. You still try during the entire game, you don't just stand there until the end.
---
What does it have to do with F13? 
---
Survivors benefit from group mentality, as the blame can be split amongst them (or put on someone else), while the killer is alone.
---
‚Äúhis voice isn‚Äôt pleasant to listen to‚Äù what the fuck Graeme has an amazing sounding voice you uncultured swine 
---
There is absolutely zero wrong with using every crutch perk in the book, along with teabagging, emote and flashlight spam. That being said, it's not hypocritical to say it sucks to play against.
---
Hatch standoffs happen if both sides want to achieve their objective. A game mechanic that is a competition of who can waste the most time is a bad mechanic and even game designers know it. 
---
If you're running scratched mirror and camping odds are you're so bad at the game that that's the only way for you to get kills. That makes the *player* toxic, not the actual killer.
---
Before she puts it on you or while running through the exit gate? 
---
Noob3's editing keeps his videos at a fun pace. 
---
Monto is fun to watch just gotta skip to the next video before that cancerous song starts playing.

---

It's absolutely insane how much watching Zubat taught me how to play. The way he narrates his thought processes in game, as well as will point out what survivors do wrong when he encounters unforced errors made me learn the game 5x as fast as were I to struggle thru it myself. Also he's just straight up entertaining
---
Looking like she got kidnapped and trapped in a secluded room where she practiced her kung-fu on a wall daily.
---
When I told a survivor good game he responded hang yourself. Toxic survivors are the majority at low tier play
---
His streams are pure entertainment, he deserves more love ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
You all wanted shirtless myers so your getting myers on shirt
---
While running in common
---
Wheres nea?
---
We‚Äôre just entertaining each other at this point, which is more than his videos have done for me so you‚Äôve got a leg up on him in that aspect. I‚Äôm gonna let you get last reply, so hopefully you make it a good one. ‚ù§Ô∏è Take it easy out there. 
---
But at least we can share it for the world to see.

Nurse is the best killer in the game. LF is one of the worst. Nurse is hard to play, LF is easy.

Yesterday I played with a Feng Min and a David who were crouching around and hiding behind trees instead of doing gens or just *anything* when we knew that the killer was chasing someone on the other side of the map. First  I was annoyed then I thought ''maybe they're just low ranks''.   
---
I checked after the game, they were rank 8 and 3...

IIRC, his original Windstorm addon gave him a brief movespeed buff after uncloaking - that is now a part of his kit by default, and Windstorm now buffs his movespeed while cloaked.
---
Yes, you should totally try it
---
Yes the game is intended for you to bolt back to the hook and only commit chase to the one injured guy instead of chasing other people, making the game boring for everyone
---
I mean, that's the point of ranks. But something nice at the end of a season would be appreciated, even if it's just a lump sum of BPs (which would have the added effect of easing the grind).
---
Smart survivors don‚Äôt go there though. I mean it happens often but that‚Äôs besides the point lol.

The only thing that can make me DC in this game is if the Killer holds the game hostage by body blocking me in a corner or in basement or if a Survivir holds the game hostage with a new exploit. In game items, add ons, offerings, perks and characters I dont like isn't enough for me to DC.

If you've seen his youtube community posts then you know that he's pretty darn toxic.
---
Eh IDK. I think there is a slight difference between console and PC. I remember from my time on the PS4 that there were more asshole killers than PC.
---
I don't believe in the whole "both sides are equally as toxic" idea personally. I think it undermines toxicity in a sense by putting it all on the same level, that's just my opinion.
---
In all my hours as a killer and as a solo survivor I have seen so many toxic survivors it's unbelievable. There are more toxic survivors by he sheer player numbers, plus there is much more capability for a survivor to be toxic, as they can be toxic to fellow survivors as well as the killer. I don't think my killer bias is showing too much either cause solo survivor is hell too just for the sheer amount of assholes there are. 
---
I'm not saying killers can't be toxic or even that there isn't a lot of toxic killers, but the sheer amount of toxicity that survivors are capable of and give off is astounding. I say that not as a gotcha to survivors, but like I said it's important to call out a problem from where it stems if you want to achieve anything.
---
PSYCHOLOGICAL TRICK TO FRUSTRATE YOU, ERGO INCREASING CHANCES YOU MAKE ERRORS
---
Yeah, DS feels far more toxic.
---
When joining the lobby, he/she joined seperatly, so I don't think so
---
Wait so the ship and the house on the other map arent strong loops? What did i miss?
---
The ship is very strong with balanced landing ( common used perk) and even without it you can waste a lot of time 
---
Same goes for the hous, where you have a safe window at the bottom and a decent one a the top.  
---
I know you cant stay there all the time since gens are spread but unless its a insta down killer, you can make it over there without being a god at the game
---
Just keep those locations in mind
---
now he plays fortnite and makes the big bucks, proud of him
---
No problem, but you should get a second opinion from someone else, before you repost. English is not my first language and I might have forgotten a mistake. 
---
Legion is in a very weird spot, being both OP and UP. They can end chases very quickly and with minimal skill required, but at the same time, they require multiple hits to down in frenzy, and are pretty worthless outside of it. It all depends on how you play them.
---
Nah, DS is actually more comparable to Ruin. DS wins survivors some extra time, Noed gives killer some extra time. Simple as that. NOED is an end game perk and does not help against early DS at all. 
---
wow, unlucky.
---
Same my dude but it was 100x times worse in Evolve
---
His videos are so well edited they also give me a bit of a nostalgia trips of how old youtube gaming videos were like
---
OMEGALUL

Murder and guts ripping out of humans? I sleep
---
Lady exposes tiddy for half a second? REAL SHIT
---
Im pretty sure its a bug, heck Ive seen some windows not even get blocked...I had to do a double take on those windows. The bug seems to hit maps with combines the hardest.
---
I use his power to catch up, but manually cancel it before I hit someone
---
He was banned :D
---
Lol legion questions
---
have my upvote just for 'stop using no mither' üòÇ 
---
What are you doing in my swamp?....Shrek is that you? haha
---
Typical Claudette behavior
---
Puppers on there but no Panda? Throw this one out and start over.
---
It's really nice to see that despite being a community full of conflict that there are so many people rallying to streamers who have been missed. Very refreshing. 
---
Also #whereispanda
---
-WGLF: I‚Äôm a cocky bastard especially when it comes to my friends. I‚Äôd definitely shout something like that while taking them off the hook. 
---
-Breakdown: I‚Äôm really heavy, and I have a tendency to break everything I touch. Seriously. It‚Äôs uncanny the things that have broken for seemingly no reason when I‚Äôm around.
---
-Dead Hard: I‚Äôd consider myself a ‚Äòberserker‚Äô of sorts. I don‚Äôt take things seriously nor am I really at my full potential until I‚Äôm in a stressful situation and likely pissed off. Like if some bastard slapped me with a hammer or poked me with a knife. Then I‚Äôd probably get pretty serious and start avoiding blows. 
---
-Decisive Strike: As much as I hate that this would be part of my kit, I have to admit I probably would be the person that sneaks something sharp if I were to go down. I‚Äôm a spiteful bastard. 
---
Would love a perk that lets you get just a solid jab on the killer or something. I‚Äôd (attempt to) fist fight a ghost or a big guy with bear traps. 
---
It rewards bad play IF survivors are bad and dont look for 5 totems, which are set out in regular places..
---
If a killer is putting you all on hooks and you dont have time to get the totems then its not bad play, is it? Because you are struggling to get out.
---
If you have smashed 5 gens and had no problems then its your own fault for leaving totems.
---
Im survivor main rank 1, killer rank 1 also when i can be bothered playing it. 
---
Also ds isnt op either, personally i dont use it as i get more out of the other perks i use.
---
That happens alot on that map it's the map itself not lag
---
Only that low effort memes are against the rules depening on the sub. Thus no, thats not reddit in a nutshell.
---
IF IT'S ONE HIT AT THE BEGINNING, IT'S TO STOP THE SCREAMING AND USUALLY NOTHING PERSONAL. CONSTANTLY THOUGH? THEY MAD
---
How far back at you scrolling lmao? 
---
so fucking good. To the frontpage with you!
---
I mean to be fair the survivors are getting chainsaws into their back without the mori anyway. I think leatherface's ability would kill them already if the game was realistic, as the animation would cut them in two 
---
thank you for your answer :)
---
Meg as a man looks like Andrew Lincoln as early/mid Rick Grimes
---
I BOUGHT IT CUS THE SELL, THE GAME HAS BEEN UNPLAYABLE WITH THE LOBBY TIMES SO I HAVEN'T OPENED IT MUCH RECENTLY. IM WAITING FOR THE EVENT TO BE OVER SO I HAPPENED TO MISS IT
---
I‚Äôm so glad you liked my art!
---
Ultimately, the point is if you're doing gens as you should be, the Killer HAS to patrol the map rather than camp if he wants to win. If camping killers is really as big of a plague as this subreddit makes it seem like, then *all you have to do is gen rush*, and you will pip 3 out of 4 games (since there's a 1/4 chance of being the one that gets camped) while the killer consistently depips because he gets one kill and loses chaser points for camping. If that happens long enough, all these horrible campers will be low rank shitters.
---
Like, if I run BBQ &amp; Chili, and I hook someone and see one aura out of three people, you bet I'm gonna sniff out those two dumbasses wasting time. I'm not gonna go walk around the generators so I can see that they're still sparking from the last time I came around and kicked them, my goal is to kill you. 
---
haha oh god please don't try it, nothing I said is true! üòÑ
---
I would imagine that, similar to the current "penalty", that if another survivor is within a certain radius of the hooked survivor that the penalty is not applied... 
---
I typed in "stuck loading screen" into search and found this post. Game keeps freezing mid load :( fucking infuriating
---
Why is everyone getting downvoted today? Am I missing something?
---
Haha yeah, making Franklins synergies with AITH and plunderers was my goal! I want to make a whole build around it someday lol
---
‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è
---
It is. Kinda wish BHVR fixed their fucking game smh. That's mainly why I haven't played in over a week
---
Oh really? I don't think so. It seems like a very genuine suggestion you should try :)
---
That is definitely fair and true, an if we're bringing up things that don't make sense how the hell does the hooks go through your back/chest/shoulder and then you can use that arm at all? Not to mention there's literally no healing that without surgery lol
---
The Doctor better chill out before I risk it all üòõ
---
hmmmm
---
Non SWF teams aren't going to know to do gens. Most are going to move I  for a save when they see the survivor hasn't been unhooked.
---
Heck, even SWF teams would probably move close in the hopes of an opening to save. Camping is too rewarding as it is and definitely needs a bigger punishment. Even a survivor perk that increases repair speed while the killer is in radius of a hooked survivor would go a long way t√≤ making killers think twice 
---
Now kids this is why we don't do drugs!
---
I wasn't being serious 
---
Yeah I think streamers are part of the problem. They don't want to sit still because then they're not really doing anything but that's the game. Frankly if I get hooked I use that time to take a bite of a snack or drink.
---
Then I dont really see a penalty working because when is there not another survivor? If its justified camping then there's people around and if it's just a lazy/shitty killer people will rush up and then stand there until the person dies on hook.
---
I noticed that Freddy isn't wearing his trademark sweater and the Hillbilly is wearing it instead.  Quite confusing but great artwork nonetheless.
---
this guy doesnt watch noob. just because he says hes toxic doesnt mean he is asshat
---
I get this a lot whenever I play Spirit at low ranks, just ignore it. It just sounds like salty people
---
Fuck this kills me
---
Gah I hate that crap!
---
When someone does that to me i just go with it lol. I find it funny and its not the end of the world :D
---
Don't just stare at it, stalk it.
---
Even though he doesn‚Äôt mainly play it
---
I like papa Brick
---
I wasn't being serious when I wrote that
---
Slowing hook progress while the killer is nearby was attempted already. It led to survivors rushing the hook and trying to loop the killer within that radius. They'd have to make it so if you're in a chase them the progress doesn't work. Because survivors aren't special little people who don't abuse things. They're just as bad as killers.
---
I really need his BDSM outfits in the gameüòâ
---
???
---
OH the Baby TUMS!!
---
He's my favorite.
---
That‚Äôs interesting cuz I play since when Nurse was new and I have always used it this way and it just works for me. I guess our experiences do vary a lot then, but it does indeed seem to be a thing which is common knowledge in the region I play in (EU).
---
This movie never gets old. 
---
They shipped from Thailand 
---
Spirit and huntress are on a date. Michael is stalking them and the hag is in the kitchen making... ‚Äúfood‚Äù
---
is that Jake? looks funny tho üòÄ
---
Template pls
---
Myers and Leatherface do it too. Dunno what to tell ya
---
A Jake, Claudette and Quentin. I belly flopped off the world trying to escape and ended up actually getting out with a sliver of bleed put timer left.
---
I once had a teabagger message me mid game to tell me they were gonna "F**k me up!"  
---
Sweetest mori of my life!
---
Well sometimes it happens to me too and even a lot but I don't complain, it's normal that the killer wants to reduce the ennemy team's effectives as quick as possible. It's the goal of this asymmetry. It still easier to rank up as survivor than as killer but still survivors always find a way to complain and shit on killers who are just playing the way the game is meant to be played (btw there's nothing wrong with camping either however it is certainly not a wise choice in most cases as you penalise yourself for doing it).
---
"wholesome" lmao
---
No love for streamdad? His non toxic approach to the game is refreshing.
---
Leatherface doesn't even know what happened. He's just like "HUYYY-- Awww....."
---
Hey, you fixed the grammar! I'm impressed, not a lot of people would do that and reupload. Very nice work!
---
He needs to have the biggest bulge
---
The matchmaking system goes on average of all tanks. Also, matchmaking during this event has been pretty whack. We were a full team of R1s and we went against a R12. To be fair it took us 20mins to get into a lobby so I think after awhile they just tossed us anywhere. 
---
The best thing to do is reverse image search using google! 
---
It's because people get the reason all wrong lmao. You know she deranks so she can play against a wider array of killers right? She's had a ton of streams where she remains in rank one the entire time and plays against three killers for hours (she starts her streams in the middle of the night). I can attest that it's not good for her stream because I've closed out of it after she played against the same billy and spirit 3-4 times each. 
---
And apparently she plays enough killer to be rank one on a consistent basis. Even though rank doesn't mean anything, it's at least somewhat symbolic of time put in.
---
It's fair to critique the way she plays like the others did, but what your doing is straight up slander. 
---
no not really the road map says spring 
---
Because there's any hard counter to Decisive. Riiiight...
---
That mans 100% packin
---
i know it says spring, but there's a new chapter every 3 months and it's been almost 3 months since the last PTB. Also winter is almost over now anyway.
---
Definitely a fan of Tru3, Ardetha Monto (just a little bit) and Noob3
---
Never seen Puppers or Demi before.
---
Heheheheh...
---
A bunch of my friends were doing the gender-swap photo thing on FB, and they all came out looking goofy as hell.
---
I decided to give it a shot so I could laugh at how it would most likely warp me into some type of hideous drag queen who looked like they lost a bar fight, and I came out looking find as f$%@.
---
I'm not trans, and have never considered cross dressing (still don't), but was like... goddam.
---
Yeah, I am just starting to stretch out like that, myself. I don't run empathy but I run other things to help me know where the killer is like spine chill. I've also been running small game lately because everyone and their mother uses hexes like ruin and noed. I don't mind hexes by any means but they definitely need to add some more diversity to them.
---
that is the trade off, either wait an eternity for a match with people with red pings or grab those close by which may include rank difference you wont like.   Id rather take the latter, than sit in a lobby
---
MY MASK MY BEAUTIFUL MASK (check flair)
---
Honestly!!! At one point it was taking us 30mins just to find ONE lobby. And we‚Äôre all R1s.
---
"I hate this goth bitch"
---
*b r u h*
---
Nope, you cannot Dead Hard a RBT. Think about it, how are you supposed to dodge a mechanical contraption prying your mouth open?
---
Ochido no thanks and no Jendenise either she likes to de-rank when games don't go her way, don't need that kind of crap in the game.
---
I was against Cahlaflour the other day and she was nice.
---
As a rank 1 survivor I almost always run it. I got from Altruistic to immersed Claudette when I hit rank 1 or don't play with friends. Once that billy or nurse has that snowball going there is no stopping them. To counter it I run empathy so I can see exactly where the killer is getting chased and avoid it like the plague. I then sit in lockers when BBQ and Chilli happens and get gens done. Most of the time it is a hatch escape for me if I don't get tunnelled right off the bat. Although the emblem system fucked me over because I used to double pip every round by doing totems and sabotaging hooks and doing gens where as now I can't double pip if I don't run into the killer at all.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm so glad you liked my DBD art. I can fix my mistake for my readers.
---
hopefully they are fixing the game engine....really tired of all the game crashes and freezing while loading.  give me that first, as I am tired of having to restart my game every 2-3 matches.  
---
The fact that this community spawns so much toxicity and negativity even though we are all just trying to have fun. It kills me to read this subreddit and the forums because of all the hate filled arguing. Can't even have a discussion or opinion without a million downvotes.
---
This post has been made by ‚ÄúWHEN THE FUCK WILL THEY RUN OUT OF CHRISTMAS EVENT EBONY MORIES‚Äù gang.
---
&gt;You know she deranks so she can play against a wider array of killers right?
---
Link me a vod where she only gets 3 killers. I play at red ranks and I get a wide array of killers. She's no exception. You closed her stream because she played against good players/stronger killers? Guess her stream isn't that entertaining?
---
&gt;And apparently she plays enough killer to be rank one on a consistent basis.
---
You don't sound too convinced yourself lol.... The reason people say ranks don't mean anything is because of people like her. People with a voice in this community. Go play at red ranks vs green ranks... there's a NOTICABLE difference.
---
Not slandering tbh, I didn't say anything false. It is strictly my opinion. Don't try to defend her, it's really annoying tbh.
---
If you think about it, he's basically a Tusken Raider with a chainsaw 
---
Just to slow this post down A LAAAAAAL BIT
---
This game isn‚Äôt balanced so the counter is to play around.  Dribbling, bait, tunnel are ways killers combat the perk.  
---
Awww. It's Ellis, too
---
Just finished a game like that. Got the guy stalking me, too, but they both kobe'd. I let them leave thinking "that was so lucky, go ahead you deserve to live" and instead they stayed at the gate trying to blind me, fast vaulting and t-bagging for 2 minutes straight. Fuck those guys.
---
Most Myers I encounter are really fun. I love when a killer dicks around the whole match, idec if he kills me at that point. Had a Myers match where he would just stare at you though windows till you notice and run lol
---
Thats why I did say pretend, not do it. I had some fun games in the event where a Feng decided to let me go into stage 2 just to get a lantern next to the hook. Got hooked the second time just as the last gen, and therefore adrenaline, popped and would have had a real chance of escape
---
Thank god butchering people is
---
I DID THE SAME AND NOW I'M SAD, I WANT BUBBA
---
Nice. Why this doesn't have more upvotes is beyond me. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what for Europe, but in gamepedia in Russian it‚Äôs clearly stated that you wawe when you want to get saved and stay still when there‚Äôs a killer a nearby.
---
I don't like putting /s  it feels wrong
---
Also I'm going to join the downvote party on me 
---
Oh, again....
---
I matchmake with a friend, I'm rank 2 nd they're rank 8 so not as big of a difference but I still don't get why people do this. The worst we get is they die a lot so I kamikazee hits and die instead :")
---
It‚Äôs not ‚Äúnewer‚Äù. Some people even on R1 think these things are reversed.
---
PRAISE

I only put them there because they are good at entertaining people , just look at their twitch streams and I am aware that they both encourage the toxic swf culture of this game 
---
Totally fair but I know that it's happened to me and my friends. I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt with DCs because it can happen at the most inopportune moment. 
---
And it was a funny clip and I am happy that the guy got his points! Funny title too. I'm not hating hahaha 
---
He is just being an ass
---
Gotta rep my duuuuud Geistra
---
ouch...what do you guys do for that long?  I give up myself after 5 minutes and either try killer or play another game
---
[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aobsqv/i_like_legion/) is currently positive, with a decent discussion going on.
---
Thats what i ment if you capture them again there is no escape from it
---
Or towards the Killer. Might as well be sending me hate mail every time I get 4k 
---
Drag by daylight
---
Real talk though, Monto is an annoying, whiny baby. Played him twice, both times cried in the chat, called me shit killer, was generally a real doucher, etc.
---
Watch streams or videos! But it was during the beginning of the event. I guess it‚Äôs also because it‚Äôs easier to get event coins as a survivor this event as opposed to previous ones where it‚Äôs easier as a killer. And there‚Äôs rly not much incentive to play killer during this event too. 
---
Lmfaooo
---
I WAS A CLOWN AND WON BUT SOME RANDOM AUSTRALIAN LEFT A COMMENT ON MY STEAM CALLING ME A LAG SWITCHER. ITS NOT MY FAULT EVERYONE ELSE WAS IN AMERICA WITH GOOD PING INCLUDING ME. DBD MAKE A WAY TO CHOOSE A REGION!!!

Uh...if u'v ever seen her in them daisy dukes, you know that sister actually has a PACKAGE.
---
Need to give her the old "Crocodile Dundee" test.

Oh I love this! I hope you make more. It really makes me love if pinhead was a licensed killer! I hope you‚Äôll talk about what his perks would be lol
---
I'm a bit of a coward, I admit. I usually gen jockey but sometimes go for saves if the time is right 
---
I'M HAVING THE OPPOSITE PROBLEM, PLAYING NICE KILLER TO HELP PPL GET THEIR COINS, BUT THOSE GAMES LAST FOREVER, THEY KEEP FAILING GENS AND HIDING FOREVER!
---
UwU
---
\*Add's Truetalent and Angry Pug\*
---
Not sure why you got a downvote. Someone holding the game hostage with an exploit seems like a perfectly reasonable reason to DC; I'm not going go to waste my limited time to play videogames because someone wants to go to an area where I can't follow them and go AFK for 2 hours in an attempt to troll me.
---
For an indoor map, I prefer Lery's - Gideon has too much confusion with the two floors.
---
You know what would be neat? An underground bunker/mine map. That could get seriously dark and claustrohpobic - maybe with long corridors that you can't see all the way through? Anything other than another samey outdoors thing again.
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm pretty all of Pinhead‚Äôs perks are BDSM stuff lol 
---
Yeah I noticed that, not sure what BVHR was thinking with the event rewards for killers. Its almost like this was their first event haha
---
I guess on the plus side, spotting survivors holding a lantern is super easy...maybe? haha
---
AAAAHAHAHAHA

Urban Evasion is all I see a need for. QnQ is nice but not really important enough imo.

"Look at fucking peter pan over here. IM FLYINGGG"

they were playing the game when it first came out where it was bugs galore and it possibly the funniest thing ive seen from all 3
---
To be fair, Christianity has never had too many issues with brutality, but becomes extremely fidgety about sexuality.
---
Have a lovely day. :)
---
TBH I found you posts funny but you shouldn't spam post them lol, especially if they are the same format
---
Especially the damn No Mither Sabo Squad 
---
Thank you for this. I have been doing this all wrong. Like I have been doing the opposite lol
---
She helped her pet Legion to kill us all :(  
---
She was pointing to people and flashlighting them out to her pet, teabagging other survs when they went down, pretending to unhook survivors &amp; teasing them, staying at one exit gate in front of the lever to block it.  
---
She'll probably get arthritis when she's older from all of the teabagging &amp; I hope her pet Legion turns on her one day...
---
It's less of a dick move if nothing else I suppose...
---
Doc's hand is up a little too high. BAD TOUCH.

No kidding. Jesus, that sucked

uwu

Thanks for the tag. :) Yeah, Ive never seen it either. 
---
Jeepers! The Nea on the left is terrifying.
---
naw they un-ironically believe it, Jen is pretty scummy but you'll never hear them admit it at all.
---
Playing innocent is a common twitch e-girl tactic.
---
I really enjoy Yoonz, Morf and Photosynthjesus.
---
Yeah, *right?*
---
punish you - punish your team. I'm team A, you're team B. If team B makes a mistake then team A punishes them for it. You is used in English to refer both a single person that you're talking to or a group. You made mistake as a team, I don't care who of you is guilty here, you're gonna get punished as a team (and you being dead or on a hook is a punish for the whole survivor team as it means someone else has to get to you and you are not doing gens for a period of time, or in case of you being dead you won't do any gens at all) I really couldn't care less if you feel personally offended, because I'm playing vs a team not vs a specific person. I don't hold grudges against specific survivors even if they really try to annoy me, but I am also not going to go easy on specific survivor, because it's technically not his mistake.
---
Thanks! Hmm I didn‚Äôt learn how to draw but I can give some of tiny tips. 1. Do not afraid to fail, just enjoy your own art. 2. Draw every day. Practice is the best teacher. 3. Don‚Äôt try to be perfect, try to be yourself. I mean, the art style. 
---
for selling out?
---
Yeah why does the adrenaline look like a cartoon hag that is disappointed that she is being stabbed in the eye
---
I'm going to keep DCing against Legion because high DC percentages are the only thing that get these devs to do anything quickly about a problem.
---
See Freddy and his amazing nerf after mostly everyone that was vocal complained he was weak
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm so glad you liked my art!
---
I can't find them on eBay anywhere? Can you help a brutha out?
---
Yay! I‚Äôm glad to see a positive conversation 
---
Baby....RUTH?!
---
The locker catch is always so satisfying

because descriptions says avoid all damage (i believe)

Nice work dude!

Not to be a wet blanket, but I always assumed that she was a very homely looking industrial revolution type woman. Not ugly, but just word down, looks older than she is from a hard life of struggle and stress.

He dodges them because they're his friends, you mong.
---
He's allowed to play however he likes but he doesn't have to subject his friends to it.
---
Too true. The easy route in these situations is to sling mud back but it doesn't really help anyone. Being nice and making them feel foolish for making you out to be an ass.
---
At the same time people like this will also look for any way to push your buttons and it brings me carnal pleasure knowing you pushed their buttons back.
---
I like the other guys suggestion where kinda like pig it doesn't effect when in chase
---
Well if it‚Äôs like last chapter, we should get teased the new chapter end of February, ptb beginning of March and release middle of March 
---
In bizarro world perhaps. She looks like Caitlin Jenner in glasses. 
---
We need more Patrick Bateman in every sub
---
perfectly balanced meme
---
Really depends on what the other people in the game are doing, which sadly isn‚Äôt always possible to tell.
---
Only in NA
---
They need to fix loading screen crashes first.
---
Yeah no. Get Demi off of here and replace him with TydeTime. Demi is nothing but another cancerous, toxic off-spring. Now before anyone says "Noob3 is also toxic and cancerous" but he's toxic in a passionate way and isn't a total shit talking cunt like Demi is.
---
Because it's a distraction tactic to waste your time? Even if you down them it'll take longer than it should just because of the BL. You want to catch a person like that out naturally. Unless you can hinder them, like if you're playing Clown
---
&gt;_&gt; maybe...
---
Dribbling isn‚Äôt an exploit.  
---
Where‚Äôs Michael? 
---
ok, why are you telling us 
---
I like Legion too!
---
I mean, I don't have him but he seems cool. A fast killer is something nice to have where most killers are just plain slow.
---
I do agree that he is an annoying character to play against but I don't think he is an "insta DC" as I have seen in some posts. 
---
Oh! Fractured cowshed got me really 
---
Nea escaped 
---
I mean technically all perks are set up in some sort of way of rewarding a killer/survivor by using base game mechanics. Yea I know I'm 26d late to reply but wanted to get it in here.
---
I feel like this could be formatted better with a different background and font, so redone entirely but still cute anyway

 I don‚Äôt really set myself a limit, if they are to near jungle gyms or powerful loops I move on,

no that's not true, it should have already been teased, our PTB would be near-ish the end of feb and the release would be on the 10th-14th march
---
I have done, but not sure what will happen with it  :\  There's a longer video here https://youtu.be/XDYWoXli0kc She was chasing after us and I felt like I was in the game with 2 killers!  Her pet had noed to get me down, I should've known XD Nearly had the gate open too.  Then I actually managed to escape from the hook :(
---
What about shinobazu and crunchyeggroll?  /s
---
True, I usually will go a little longer at the start since you still have 5 gens but that can bite you in the ass if two gens pop because of it lol. Sometimes long chases going through multiple pallets early will help you in the end since they won‚Äôt have many safe areas but I just need to figure out when is a good time to stop but I guess that comes with more time
---
this is cutee
---
Just Bad a Feng on Mothers Dwelling who ran Upstairs and instantly jumped back down in Front of me, so I got an easy down.
---
This honestly repeated 2 times and she DC'd on the last hook and called me a noob tunneler...
---
That was on rank 1....
---
btw. Good meme 
---
That‚Äôs definitely what I need to more aware of because I don‚Äôt know all the best loops yet
---
After seeing the clip where he pushes survivors to farm just to kill them and laugh like an idiot at it, I'm never going to like this guy.
---
Bamboozle Legion :D so many people try to vault behind you after you follow them through a window and its hilarious seeing them fail :D
---
My heart goes crazy in the loading screen, because. What if it doesnt load lol 
---
3k is a win tbf
---
Yea that‚Äôs usually when I start going ok I need to just move on but sometimes depending on the survivor I‚Äôll get stubborn lol
---
She could get a ban, or not... I don't know how they work with reports really. But it clearly is a reportable/bannable offense : 
---
GRIEFING: INTENTIONAL GAMEPLAY ABUSE
---
Working with the opposite team to gain an advantage or grief teammates
---
Targeting specific users repeatedly in order to ruin their game experience
---
Holding the game hostage
---
In-game report REQUIRED / Customer Support ticket OPTIONAL
---
sure, I sometimes do the same and it might even pay off if the other 3 act like moths flying to the hook :D
---
You can either leave your item or move your camera up and down to do a kind of nod.
---
Killer Clown icon pack
---
Only had time to grind out 2 coins, so I got Huntress's head and body. Anything else would've felt incomplete, IMO.
---
It's been doing it since 2.5.0 honestly. It happens to me at least once a day, usually when a bloody party streamer is involved.
---
Whenever I play killer I just let them have it, I feel like a 3k is still considered a victory.
---
Crouch down, look up and down over and over again to nod, best way to do it
---
Actually, I really like this holy shit.
---
but what about emote:"come with me"? or to point at him? as killer you can just move your head upside down
---
Last chapter was first teased November 21, so if it‚Äôs the same schedule, we should get a tease in a couple weeks 
---
1.) Moris are quite tricky to come across in bloodwebs, especially the Ebony version (ultra rare)
---
2.) You have to hook the survivor first
---
3.) You have to down them again in order to mori
---
Basically, there are already a bunch of conditions you have to satisfy as the killer, and you want to make this even harder?
---
its so rare
---
I once played against Tithi, he was in SWF with DS, flashlight, and he kept teabagging me, he looped for dozens of seconds around his friend's hook and instantly disconnected when I caugh him. Then he insulted me on my profile for "camping", when I was playing with Leatherface's addon not to oneshot with the chainsaw, meaning I was playing for fun and never tunnel in these cases. So, that's a no for me !
---
I could clock Ace, Jeff and Jake at 1,000 paces. 
---
But seeing this makes me think Feng has a secret. 
---
What about 72hrs? He used to be #1 for entertainment.
---
No you are~
---
I do the follow me emote since it sort of looks like a wave
---
why D:
---
cant speak for others, but I always do that with friends, if they would get the hatch otherwise.
---
often it ends up in me getting killed and they get the hatch xD
---
Woof woof
---
Well its not making it much harder to mori people. You just have to check your surroudings before the ritual begins
---
Bet! I'm now inspired to start my quest of meme-making. Thank you good maam or sir! 
---
This is more for late game chases, but, I'm always trying to stay cognizant of where the gens are and where my chase is. If the chase is near 3 gens that are close together, I know I can waste some time because those three gens are being patrolled while I'm chasing. Once I see that survivor start pulling me across map or towards completely gens I'll abandon it.
---
Usually do it to mess with friends lol. We all screw with each other when we SWF
---
GEN
---
It's pretty much a NOED without insta downs.
---
Y no HybridPanda? :c or PaulieEster?
---
N00b3 and Monto are DBD gods.
---
Man, Vinc3ntVega is a good one too if you like segments and an actual show. Perk Royale slot machine, a fortune teller to determine his last match of the evening and the beloved favorite in his community, Scaredette. 
---
He puts a lot of production into his stream and he truly cares about people enjoying the game.
---
Imagine saying something so stupid in a *horror video game* subreddit. 
---
I‚Äôm more curious, what‚Äôs your normal go to build when you‚Äôre playing solo? 
---
Because he used very vocal about what he thinks is right or wrong about the game, complained a lot, and people still have this image of him. But it was when the game was completly broken for killers. Now I think it's probably because he's very stubborn and doesn't want to change his opinion sometimes. Also because were butthurt about his killer tierlist.
---
This shows that we do,in fact,live in a society
---
I nod as well or leave an item sometimes. If I‚Äôm down and I have a merciful killer, I‚Äôll spin around in a circle lol. 
---
Xbox one. Visual. Ace is t posing on me. When you load up the game select either SWF or Survivor, you  can also do it after switching from the killer menu. What should happen is you see your character doing their animation. For me I see Ace asserting his dominance over me (T posing) for some weird reason it only happens for Ace. I have posted two screenshots of the issue on the this subreddit already and I can provide more later if needed.
---
Oh, I see, thanks for the explanation
---
People stop saying howdy it's a repost.
---
It's either a goof, or they're annoyed that someone is so immersed in a locker that they're not contributing. 
---
A lot of new players crouch walk around everywhere and spend a ridiculous amount of time in lockers. It's counter-productive and they'd be better off being on a hook.
---
i feel like I'm part of that generation that really needs to google who that woman is 
---
We just like to argue on this sub. 
---
Mad Grit, Agitation and Iron Grasp. Typically on Billy. It's hilarious to just chase down a survivor with their teammate swinging on your shoulder. 
---
A more accurate version would be pinhead going on a 20 minute rant about how much pain and pleasure he is going to bring while everyone escapes or solves the cube puzzle similiar to 90% of the hellraiser movies.
---
Because he's too immersed, check the bushes for Scaredette!
---
Trash
---
I hate how many people make out like she's such a saint. A lot of what I've seen(and heard) of her makes me really dislike her. Sad that these kinds of people are what represent DbD's community...
---
Kindred
---
I was a bit late to posting the comment, but I appreciate your appreciation of it!
---
Don't stay in the game for too long, say "gg" in chat.
---
It‚Äôs just a worse version of bond is the problem 
---
Maybe set that file to Read-Only after you verify it? I have no clue, hasn't happened to me.
---
You should also do a report on the site with the YouTube video in de description. Hopefully will that get her banned. 
---
Save the Best for Last on Freddy. It saves so much time in a chase that he desperately needs, plus it makes his successful hit animation faster, which I like. Plus I like feeling unstoppable in a chase, so it works well with the other perks I use for him (Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, and Enduring).
---
Until it‚Äôs more beneficial to go for someone who is close by. Like if the person I‚Äôm chasing is going into a safe infinite and I see somebody else obliviously working on gen nearby
---
Doctor with distressing, sloppy butcher, thanatophobia, Coulrophobia.
---
Throw in an add on to help increase terror radius. If you really want a laugh and it to be effective throw in a game map offering.
---
Always makes me laugh because normal doctors heal, this doctor wants you to suffer.
---
LMAO
---
Some survivors get butthurt when a teammate steps into a locker for some reason. I guess they feel like using an in-game tool is worse than grassing your teammates in to the killer. Either that or they‚Äôre SWF trying to annoy each other. 
---
It‚Äôll be funny until they easily mind game you beneath loops because you can‚Äôt see them
---
Tineye actually hasn't been that helpful lately, this image came back with zero hits...
---
I went in a game with a claudette that was doing this. Not fun at all
---
If a survivor flashlight spams and teabags at me I tend to ignore them as they most likely want me to waste time chasing them in nigh infinite loops. The thing about survivors like those is that they will chase after you trying to annoy you into chasing them.
---
Also I tend to drop the loop if I see the survivor is much better at looping than I am. I'll swallow my pride any day of the week if I get a better score for it.
---
Throw on territorial imperative 
---
As a killer I've always taken the emotes as a taunt, since survivors will also point or wave when they toss a pallet on me (as opposed to t-bagging but with the same meaning). When I try to communicate that I'm friendly to survivors I tend to head-nod, so I think that could be a good way to say gg.
---
Self-care: Because I have basic knowledge on how to cleanse wounds
---
Ace in the hole: Because I'm lucky
---
Lithe: Because I'm good at parkour
---
Urban Evasion : Because I can crouch walk at the speed of a light jog
---
When I get really easy survivors I like to chase them with another survivor on my shoulder to assert dominance.
---
It's kind of dumb to expect people to use these made up rules
---
Do you habe prove it was actually tithi and not someone inpersonating him
---
5k BP for every 5 seconds?  good lord, Face camp me all day long if that in the case
---
I‚Äôll have to try that because normally I‚Äôm in the mindset that I have to down the first guy and hook him ASAP to force ppl off gens but you‚Äôre right that once ppl see someone hurt they just stay on the gens 
---
you - did -  a - fabulous - thing
---
One problem, insidious.
---
Cute
---
New players? You mean anybody at any rank who runs urban evasion? Lol
---
Other possible solutions:
---
1) Killer hemorrhages bloodpoints while in a 16m radius of a hooked survivor while no other survivor is in the radius. (This is similar to the current system but targeting BPs instead of Emblem points - which nobody really cares about anyway).
---
2) Make Kindred baseline. (I dont particularly like this one though but with SWF as popular as it is - is there really a reason it shouldnt be?)
---
3) A survivor perk that increases generator repair speeds for all other survivors while hooked in killers terror radius. (This would only effect early/mid-game camping as endgame, when gates are powered, it wont make much of a difference)
---
4) A survivor perk that increases "hook time" while hooked in killers terror radius.
---
5) Basically 3 and 4 but as baseline mechanics?
---
Besides the point?  That is your whole point or am I missing something?  So maybe I should have said ‚Äúcounterplay‚Äù instead of ‚Äúcounter‚Äù. Because the killer has ways to deal with DS just as survivors have ways to deal with noed.  The game isn‚Äôt balanced so there are good and bad outcomes.  Downvote me all you want killers but both perks will be used because they are game changers. 
---
No0b3 and Jendenise are my fav streamers tbh but I don‚Äôt think a lot of people are big Jen fans on this sub? Haha 
---
exactly! I wouldnt mind not getting to play if I'm at least rewarded for my time!
---
Yeah I feel like I have no choice but to ignore any arm flails (or lack thereod) because everyone interprets them differently. It sucks, but I‚Äôd rather rely on my own judgment when pulling someone off the hook than misread their flails entirely and go in too hard. 
---
Yep. They obviously have some skill most of the time, judging from how they know where every goram pallet is, but when you eventually get that sweet sweet hook, they ragequit. 
---
Thank you!

---
Howdy Jake! 
---
I dont see why you think mori is hard is litterly a shortcut to kill surviors faster. Overall a mori is making it easier for the killer and since the surviors are supposed to work together i just think its weird that there is no mechanic to help someone out. Also if you get caught again as i wrote,  the sequence cant be broken. Sorry m8 i just dont see your theory :(
---
Excessive head nodding while I'm on the hook always cracks me up

Ah yes, the whole ‚ÄúBetterhelp are thrives‚Äù controversy üôÑ

When he moris me I cum a little. Or a lot.

I feel it likely that there are too many players that don‚Äôt use reddit or any form of media to learn this type of stuff. Best way would be to let people know in end game chat or something but even then it probably wouldn‚Äôt help much.

No one does this anymore! It annoys me so much. Haven‚Äôt seen this much at all since around the time between when clown dropped and it went free on ps4

Yes it can be but most players probably don‚Äôt think this way. I only learned because when I first played it was with a fairly experienced player who let me know all of this stuff.

ok wouldnt have expected tithi to do such things.
---
So because 1 in 100 killers pull mid game it‚Äôs ok for survivors to be toxic pieces of shit? 10/10 logic bud
---
100% deserves the gold, funny as hell 
---
i know that feeling. sometimes the call me a camper when i literally didnt have enough time to even walk away or someone ran into me when i was walking away and fled away towards the hooked guy. those survivors are the funniest. salty because they are bad.
---
Those THIGHS
---
How are these things equivalent? One is a player trying to use an item and cosmetic that killers mislabel as ‚Äúunfair &amp; unfun‚Äù to go against (the item and the player‚Äôs experience) and the other is a player ragequitting like a child. 
---
If you compare what the perks do then ruin and ds are more comparable. They both buy time. 
---
If you compare how unfair the perks feel, then yes NOED and DS are comparable. But other than that they don't have much in common, NOED is more comparable to adrenaline than anything in function.
---
Yes exactly. Some people are just... god damn so idiotic. They think you can just press X and hack the console and go online because a hoax video said so and they believe every shit they see online.
---
Pregame chats always get weirdly sexual for some reason... And I'm here for it 
---
Lol. 'Console peasant', really? I have the game both on PC and on console and I play mostly on console because my tv is brand new and 55" and my PC monitors are only 27", and a controller is more comfortable and less carpal tunnel inducing than a keyboard/mouse, but okay, dude. Everyone who chooses to play on console is totally a peasant.
---
Immersed Crawldettes who've put up 3k bloodpoints in the match urbaning the outskirts of the map don't deserve to live.  Anytime I've done it to a survivor that's the reason.  Immersed Claudettes are the survivor equivalent of facecampers.
---
i do have the mentality that people who are ignorant and can't accept that their console is inferior are stupid, if that's what you mean. if you like consoles because any number of reasons that are opinions, that's fine, but there's next to no advantages to it. calm down, bud
---
when i have time for 2 gmaes i dont get to play because the time of 2 games it's the time i spend trying to find a lobby where the killer doesnt dodge
---
I've heard of it.  Do people play it?  JK... I'm in red ranks and I literally never see it.
---
you can play PC on a tv and use your controller, what's your point? and, i never said everyone who plays on console is a peasant, im saying everyone who tries to say it's better than PC is a peasant. im having a hard time believing that you "have a pc" if you dont know you can hook it up to a TV and use a controller on it

---
NOED's function is that its clutch as hell and rewards bad play. So, yes it's the DS equivalent. Something that rewards bad play is unfair and just backs up my point that DS is equal to NOED.
---
Your response has no actual substance and there is nothing for me to take apart or digest. I'm reading it again for the 4th time and I'm not actually sure what you are trying to say. Are you suggesting that something being unfair and having different functions are two mutually exclusive events?
---
Why yikes? Iridescent button sucks. 
---
Seems like this sub isn't a big fan of angrypug, any reason why?
---
yeah rnaks dont mean anything in this game, iv'e seen worse in rank 1. but surely you can understand the confusion beeing that you are not a chase and not doing anything productive. if you are not on an active chase you should be working gens, not crouching in no mans land imo just my 2 cents tho 
---
Happy mic day
---
How doesn't it relate? 
---
Little pussycat  OBV
---
Aight where tf is zub
---
There are few notable map specific loops, like the chute in Game. Mostly the loops are just jungle gyms with one or two vault windows. Therefore it's somewhat easy to see where the survivor is taking you and whether you should chase to the end.
---
This is the best
---
Everyone forgot morf and it hurts
---
Yeah and not only you're dumb as shit you're also an illiterate. I repeat. ''Nobody has ever managed to get online on a hacked PS4 at least and probably not on an Xbox too.'' Can you read it? Stop embarassing yourself. You keep your shitty PC i keep my PC AND console and enjoy every fucking game on the market i want to. You probably don't have any friends and all my friends are on PS4 so that's why i play mostly on my PS4. Yeah and the exclusives are cool too.

If actually Pinhead joins with DBD, he would be real powerful killer. Probably even DS makes him stronger I guess.

Legion isn't fun too play vs the fact that you complain about DC's instead of people actually playing legion is mind boggling, I've been playing this game since release almost, and I've basically quit playing cause I was afraid I would get a temp ban with all my DC's, I refuse to play a video game where I get a killer who removes EVERY skillful interaction that can be had by both parties, don't hate them for doing the literal only thing that counters legion, be mad at the devs for allowing that abomination too exist for 2 goddamn months with no good changes.
---
I LOVE THIS COMMENT! 
---
Demi, Tofu, SpaceCoconut and 72hrs. Best. 
---
You intentionally left an exit gate and fed a Myers a tier 3 and gave him multiple opportunities to drop you all so you could bm some 360's at end of game.  If I have to explain to you why that was a moronic play you're probably beyond saving.  Also I been playing 2 years maybe it was the second year that teaches fucking around in front if an insta down away from the gate is a boosted play?
---
Empathy is a really good perk, but I personally use Alert since the killer is going to be breaking things more often than hitting survivors. Plus it has infinite range on all tiers, wahoo
---
The issue is, after 50 hours of gameplay this game isn't scary anymore. Perks like Urban Evasion, Premonition and Spine Chill become almost redundant at higher level play because it's better to have perks that help you loop the killer than it is to have perks that help you stay immersed. 
---

It's not about them being good, it's about them being cocky about it and actively trying to piss off the killer.

okay buddy. i would go back 2 years ago into your history and find some dumb shit you said, but im not because it's not an argument. your "pc is expensive" argument has been destroyed, so you resort to this. lol :^)
---
So engineer bad?
---
What the...?
---
and from now on I wont be able to see the doctor the same way.  
---
not complaining tho
---
Loading screens kill more survivors than the killer
---
Engineer bad.
---
No, you get the gen done immediately, saving you less time than other toolboxes.
---
I was joking about matchmaking times. On ps4 the last week or so can take 10-15 mins just to get a match 
---
yep, not zu mention those that DC after missing DS :D
---
This was so quality, ''goth bitch'' lol.
---
Yea I try to avoid that chute or if I think they will just run and jump not looking I‚Äôll try and cut them off downstairs and the cowshed I know about lol 
---
If you look at my post history on this sub i posted a video about a month ago where i literally dead harded away from a corner and ran all the way around the house and got downed and hooked in the same spot. maps trash and this was before the patch. the fact that its still happening now is bullshit lol.
---
"You cant alter a memory" 
---
I don't play it that much anymore lol. Fixing a game however is a good business decision. I still play from time to time because it because it has its moments. It's my time after all, I do whatever I want with it.
---
Well this is fucking brilliant
---
they started running out, then the glitch to constantly buy infinite of the same item came along and replenished all of their Mori's.
---
The only thing ‚Äúpetty‚Äù here is the fact that you feel like you should talk down to anyone who prefers console, and when they say why, shoot down their reasons with ‚Äúnot valid reason because I said so lol, next?‚Äù
---
But whatever, go ahead and keep thinking you ‚Äúwon‚Äù an argument on the Internet. I‚Äôm done.
---
yeah no joke there man, every 2-3 games...sometimes it will ever freeze up.  Ive been playing the same since 2016 and I think this has been the worst with infinite load screens
---
I'm talking about the current gen consoles. Sure hack away on a PS3 i've seen hackers in BO1. If you can do that on a PS4 you would be rich.
---
Yes i do have a PC i'm typing this on it right now :), but if you got 13825 trophies on PS4, 500+ games and all your friends are there, there is no reason to make a complete switch for one damn game you have played for 1500 hours already and start from scratch.
---
I wasn't trying to insult you, it was an assumption because of your own behaviour. You act like a rat.
---
Name me these PC exclusives and i'll buy them. I don't care about some early access BR crap or simulators Steam is cluttered with. Oh and the only requirement is i want something on the level of God of War, Spiderman and RDR2. Yeah that's gonna take a while, right?
---
And about sales we have constant sales just like Steam does. You would know this if you would make some research. They're not that much different from our sales by the way.
---
uncloth the spirit you mean amirite
---
Holy fuck, I didn't realize I needed pinhead as a killer
---
We have such sights to show you
---
And?
---
ive never talked down anyone who prefers console if they don't say it's superior to a PC objectively. 
---
draw hentai
---
alright, and? as long as you're not playing for 7 hours at a time you're not going to get carpel tunnel. and i don't know how many times i have to repeat myself, but people who prefer consoles aren't who im calling out. people who try to say it's objectively better are who im calling out.
---
it's funny how you're calling me upset, but you're the one scrounging through pages of my shit to find something to "call me out on". and no, not when they say something i "disagree with", when they say something objectively wrong like consoles being more powerful than PC's.
---
I'm sorry to hear that you have such trouble understanding simple concepts. Let me try to put it in another way. NOED is and endgame perk that gives killer a much better chance to hook a survivor, but at the expense of playing with 1 less active perk for most of the match. DS is not an endgame perk, it is actually strongest in the early game where the killer needs to hook a survivor early or he risks the game snowballing out of control. The main purpose of DS is not to escape getting hooked, it's to waste more killer's time by extending the chase. This is most effective in early game. This is much like Ruin, which main purpose is to buy more time for the killer by slowing down early game, especially if survivors look for the totem instead of doing gens. This is why DS and Ruin serve pretty much the same purpose, but NOED is purely an endgame perk and does not effect time management in early game positively at all. NOED is more comparable to something like Adrenaline in its purpose because Adrenaline gives you a free health state and gives you a speed boost, just like NOED allows killer to take away 2 health states with one hit and also gives a speed boost. Am I clear now or do I need to draw you kiddy pictures?
---

---
That would actually makes sense as i've found that this error appears when EAC doesn't launch.
---
For me simply launching the game directly from my Steam Library fixes it.
---
if you want to protect your router on a PC, get a VPN, much better benefits than the paid online services that they force you to use to play your games. consoles "may" hit 60 FPS, but 60 FPS isn't too hot anymore. and I've heard the "well all PC exclusives are just mmos" things too many times to count.
---
games are just better on PC unless they're limited by the company who ports it so nobody knows that the PC is better (see watch dogs 2)
---
and im not going to explain how PC's are cheaper than consoles for the same amount of power again.
---
Yeah, I get it. Sounded weird on my first read. Dcs are pretty much part of the experience of this game now, sadly.
---
Same here. Anyone joins with twitch or any kind of stream name I'm outta there. I'm not going to be the scapegoat for your stream.
---
His parents bought him a gaming PC from Best Buy and ever since he‚Äôs obviously elite. Don‚Äôt mess with him!
---
They're choosing the grounds you chase them on (bad for killer), they're more experienced in looping than their gen jockey friends. You SHOULD ignore them &amp; go after their friends that they're trying to distract you from, who are easier pickings.
---
To be fair that's not an opinion that like anyone shares lol.  
---
People who say it's higher quality are stupid, because the game sucks on console, especially in terms of frame rate, but I just really hate the pretentious 'console peasant' bs, I guess.
---
Ya ppl are really happy but the ban is prob not going to do anything. At most it will just stop him from streaming 
---
Until they fix infinite loading screens, no. I've gotten infinite loading frequently and have to exit the game each time, which counts as a dc.
---
He seriously looks nothing like the character in the movie, aside from looking convincingly tired from trying not to sleep.
---
why is there noob3?
---
*unclothe
---
That‚Äôs so weird. I played my ace with the same build but got med kits and toolboxes. I was hoping for a key but got those instead. And one chest I opened without plunders or ace in the hole got me a flashlight 
---
Myers with no perks. Just walk around staring at people. Peek around corners slowly when you know there's a survivor there.
---
team fortress 2 is still one of the most played games on stream
---
overwatch still played
---
consoles don't get triple A games for 5 bucks either.
---
by the way, your name is "rape my asshole myers" and you play fortnite so i really can't take you seriously when you try to threaten me with harm. that whole last paragraph was just nonsense that means nothing and has no relation to the argument, what are you on dude? if you wanna go that direction about the thing i said 2 years ago, why don't we talk about how your name is appropriating and making fun of rape victims? what's that? it's a joke? haha well, so was the post i made. congratulations, you became the thing you hate me so much for.

This is so me. I even get anxiety thinking about playing the game. Still play about 3 hours a night. But damn, my heart is pounding through the whole thing just like this. It's a kind of excited anxiousness though. I like the adrenaline rush.

this is less than a PS4 Pro, and has all the parts included. it's also way better than a PS4 Pro. it also doesn't make you pay for online access.
---
i literally took 2 seconds and found that, you could find something alot cheaper and alot more powerful if you tried.
---
IM NOT THE ORIGINAL CREATOR OF THIS VID I JUST FOUND IT AND SHARED IT 
---
Michael mains will disagree with you bud.
---
Oops didn't see, but thank you! I love your pig!! 
---
Depends. At the start of the game, if I can't end a chase quickly then I just go after the other gens. Once the match progresses and there's people hooked/killed, then I stick with chases for longer.
---
No need to get so offended over a shitpost legion mains
---
Can't forget Cahlaflour and the dragon army!!
---
Legion=Dc idgaf what anyone says 
---
His terror radius is Sussudio blasting in your ears as he chases you. 
---
I lost it at I DC and Naked Michael.
---
I will always say this - check him out with his P3 set. 
---
For some reason the anime blood completely masks his innate ugliness. I‚Äôm not sure how it happens but it turns him from a 2 to a 10. 
---
I‚Äôve had similar stuff happen to me. Go into a locker to avoid BBQ since I‚Äôm death hook and two of my teammates haven‚Äôt been chased for even a second, and one of them takes umbrage and points at me. People who rat out others are worse than people who d/c.
---
i'm a Legion Main and I actually liked the "Legion is trash" meme, but now its so overused its not even funny

No need to talk yourself down like this :(
---
Today a rank 2 wraith walked past me as I was hugging the back of a bus. You know the loud yellow bus and I was playing as Jake with his ugly green jacket. But somehow through out that time I hugged the bus and he didn't see me.
---
Now instead of survivors randomly screaming when the doctor is near, they will scream when those thicc thighs come into view.
---
Was hoping to see Myers with that BDSM outfit
---
Weird! I've never seen BM during moris before. Usually people are busy scattering so they don't get mori-ed next.
---
Yes yes, it is debatable if the word "function" is correct to use here. Obviously by function I mean purpose. Do you know what is one of the synonyms for function? Purpose. Or do I need to get you a dictionary? And why are we talking about dictionaries? Clearly you have internet and you are able to use google. So have we got the semantics out of the way or do you still have trouble understanding what I'm trying to say?
---
Saying that all survivor perks are geared towards buying time is too vague, just like saying all killer perks are for buying killer time is also too vague. Even so, NOED does not buy killer time, it gives  him better chance to catch survivors before they get out, something like Remember Me is much better at buying time in the endgame I would say. 
---
&gt; Also fucking Sherlock here - DS and NOED have different functions? Damn, and here I thought they did the same thing. 
---
Well good for you. I have seen many people state that NOED and DS should both be removed and that they serve a similar purpose. This is wrong. You seem to agree with me on that, so what is the problem?
---
Many people seem to compare DS and NOED not only in how clutch and unfair they are, but also like they are a different sides of the same coin. I am saying yes they are somewhat comparable in how unfair they are but they do not serve a similar purpose at all. One is and endgame perk, another one is early-midgame perk, one gives the killer a better chance  to catch someone in midgame, the other extends the chase, one is active when the game is almost over, another one can be used whenever etc etc.. When a survivor wants longer chases and to distract the killer longer he brings DS, when a killer wants to end chases faster he brings something like enduring or spirit fury or to have more time for chases without gens popping he brings Ruin. 
---
So no, DS and NOED don't compare in their purpose like for example Sloppy Butcher or Botany Knowledge do compare. There is no direct comparison for DS for killer, but Ruin is close in purpose, because in the end the reason why DS is so strong because it forces killer to waste more time on a single chase.
---
This is why DS and NOED can't really compared in other than their clutchess, they don't directly counter each other or anything. Am I clear now?
---
I wish my team was like that, instead of all 3 trying to save me and they get salty at the killer for camping.
---
yeah, now that coop genning goes red I feel like there‚Äôs little difference between solo genning and dual genning.
---
Wow his desk looks a lot like my desk. Dirty as hell with glasses stacked into each other. 
---
or you could just never prestige and save lots and lots of time...
---
There always was a difference now it just tells the noobs that it is in fact slower. 8 second slower to do 2 gens together then to do them separately (base speed)
---
Premonition will give an alert if you look in the direction of the killer while they are in a radius of 45m.
---
Spine Chill only shines while the killer is looking in your direction, but you don't know where he is coming from.
---
i can understand why people would rather use a controller, it's ergonomic and comfortable to hold. and yeah, the PC version of DBD is pretty toxic, but that's because everyone are somewhat sore losers.
---
also, this entire comment section is shaming me for what i've been saying, ive been trying to reason and explain myself but i don't think they can be reasoned with, and it's sad honestly. atleast you're reasonable. good talk.
---
Saw Trapper dialogue and automatically played the Samination voice in my head.
---
Holy crap, clean your desk. I say this while surrounded by mail at mine, but dirty dishes need to go in the sink. That's asking for roaches.
---
Also my cat sits with me when I play, too.
---
That is so awesome! After work, I will be on Patreon to support more content like this! Keep it up boss!
---
You dirty wall-hacking sniper--  oh, wait...  we get zero benefits from this glitch, other than giving the other survivors hand signals about where the killer is.  Oh, wait, nvm--  scratch that.
---
But doesn‚Äôt the timer of Premonition inherently make it more prone to false positives of ‚ÄúIs the killer coming towards me?‚Äù
---
Do you let them know they are camping by flailing your arms up and down.
---
I bought them off someone on eBay 
---
Here‚Äôs the item number if you‚Äôd like to check it out 182562729562 
---
that‚Äôs stupid
---
I don't like your post but the downvotes are ok
---
I honestly thought this was going to turn out to be a joke about No0b3 moonwalking, and how people joke about Nea being a killer.
---
The normal healing is 16 seconds though?
---
Yeah but what if you accidently prestige after you have all the perks?
---
As a wraith main, I approve!
---
She gave her life for the gen.
---
that was my question too, it doesn‚Äôt always work but I try anyways...
---
How could I forget Patrick smh please downvote my first comment 
---
Spotted the toxic survivor, everyone.
---
Comment sections can suck sometimes. I'm always open to hearing what people are trying to get across, as long as they're being reasonable too.
---
Good talk! Better dbd reddit hivemind luck in the future.
---
I always thought it was too. For 2 people on separate gens it takes 80 seconds to pop both of them base speed, if they are on the same gen that gen will pop in 44 seconds. It works in favour of the killer as you are all spread out this easier to find, but it also works in favour for the survivors because if 1 is chased then 3 gens can pop 90 second into the game.
---
those thighs are my reason to live
---
wb the stain?
---
If someone is at red ranks and doesn't ignore you when you are spam clicking on the hook they don't deserve to be at red ranks.
---
Haven't ever been a problem for me, I mostly use it as a way of knowing "okay the killer is in that direction, if the heartbeat grows louder I should run in the opposite direction".
---
hey lolita, you support "rapemyassholemyers"? does that mean you support rapists? you think rape is a joke? do you enjoy seeing people ruthlessly violated and beaten? you like seeing people cry out for help while they're threatened to be killed for not doing what their violator says? what kind of monster do you have to be to support rapist? oh, what's that? his name is obviously a joke? well i've got news for you, what i said &gt;&gt; 2 years ago &lt;&lt; was also obviously a joke. seriously, keep your double standards to yourself.
---
Oh I noticed, and for you.
---
username checks out
---
Probably a coincidence, it's a reference to the torture device
---
No, just a lot of disconnects lol
---
PS4
---
In game 
---
Grabs are still bugged. Sometimes they work properly, but other times you‚Äôll make a grab, see the animation start, and then the survivor will run off and you‚Äôll swipe at the air. This happens on gen grabs, window grabs and hatch grabs that I‚Äôve seen, not sure about hook grabs. 
---
That‚Äôs different because you‚Äôre walking at 100% speed with urban evasion at tier 3. Why would you walk when you can crouch walk at the same speed and bring less attention to yourself?
---
They get idead for new killers and powers by these things. So yes it wont embe exact but the power could be similar or the perks could.
---
Cry of Fear
---
Monto did it in his latest Trapper video
---
Who the fuck uses lockers?
---
Spine Chill notifies you when the killer is looking to your direction. It could be 2 steps away or the other side of the map. In case you decide you should leave, you have no ideia where to go.   
---
Premonition may get you false alarmed too, but at least you will be able to run to the other direction. 
---
I, too, would like to get behind her.
---
For killers you should P3 your mains. For survivor however just P3 the one you want to main so and get everyone else to 40 for their teachables. It‚Äôs also smart to make a backup character for when your P3ing your survivor/killer.
---
SWEET
---
Nea looks even uglier now
---
I love that Trapper!
---
The cosmetic and flashlight aren‚Äôt inherently toxic at all, it‚Äôs the certain behavior typically associated with it (which people like Ochido popularized) that‚Äôs toxic. I‚Äôm mainly not a fan of Jen just because she flames killers in post game chat for stupid reasons. 
---
Thank you, my friend!
---
who you callin pinhead 
---
No it's not. It makes survivors make a choice - get one gen done more quickly, or get progress on more than one gen done more quickly, but get an individual gen finished in less time.
---
I like to juke Legions. Window techs are super satisfying and it makes me feel like the chases are actually fun
---
She doesnt need new cosmetics. She has like 5000 already
---
I mean, you have a guaranteed down with him since his ability has no counter.  The two aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive.
---
I‚Äôm sorry. But it does take the attention. It‚Äôs either this or the fact he plays a doctor which doesn‚Äôt really help to be fair hahahah
---
And I‚Äôm not judging you, I was just curious x
---
thanks (i was actually reading the wiki, but thanks for writing it out too) feels about the same to me, but that‚Äôs probs just me
---
Not sure Legion members listen to metal. Looks like more heavy electronic music to me.
---
m‚Äôgoodboy
---
Haha, that's ok. I give him stern talkings to about playing Ruin Doctor all the time
---
You can tell it's Leatherface in the right-hand corner because he's *thicc.*
---

Just wanted to throw that out there.
---
Update: You've successfully shamed him into clearing his desk off. We did it Reddit.
---
You can also switch build for a few day right ?
---
I don‚Äôt like playing in the red, but this situation happens anywhere
---
Crow offerings sound neat. But then where would they be placed on maps like Swamp or Rotten Fields? I think that placing them on the ground would not help much especially in the middle of a map. They need to be placed on top of something. 
---
To be quite honest, in my decades of pc gaming, I've ran into maybe a handful of hackers. I honestly ran into way more on xbox modern warfare two. 
---
Never noticed part of her lips were cut off.
---
Quentin is 17. 
---
The Devs say all characters are "international adults" because having kids being tortured in a game is a bit iffy in some countries. However, lorewise, Quentin and Laurie are the only kids we know of whom are stuck in the entity's realm.
---
i originally thought he meant two people complete a gen 8 seconds slower than one but i looked it up and OP clarified.
---
nea is the killer xDD
---
OINK!
---
me me big boy
---
Dude, ever since I hit rank 1 I've been seeing a lot of P3 Quentins. Is this where my squad has been hiding the entire time? I've played like 10 matches today and saw 2 other P3 Quentins. I thought we didn't exist.
---
They‚Äôre not. Also Anna‚Äôs appearance is common knowledge already. 
---
I think Legion &amp; Huntress have the most appealing/interesting cosmetics, tbh. Legion looking like a regular person was a big appeal to me. Huntress just has some super cool things now, like her boar head and her bear head, and the kitty mask.
---
I don‚Äôt see the issue with dstrike... I feel the only thing survivors have that bothers me is gens going WAY too fast. Everything else I can build around ... even with ruin I just find the pacing too fast 
---
I have so many moments like that.
---
I have a video of me spending 20\~30mins sneaking around, after everyone else died, trying to find the hatch while avoiding The Huntress, as Claudette.  On that very map.  The encounters were so comical that I almost didn't want to leave.
---
Mission accomplished.
---
Oh wow surprised that one got by me I watch most of his vids.  Thanks for the heads up 
---
Bond is better. 
---
I actually knew Amanda had beaten her drug addiction via her add-ons, but I never watched the Saw movies. And I was on mobile and I needed to keep the joke short... I would have overexplained myself if I continued. Thanks though.  
---
I think she was put through another small "test" from Jigsaw himself, failed to control her own emotions and took a bullet as a result. It was in Saw 3 or Saw 4, I don't remember. I "saw" the Saw movies (pun intended) via CinemaSins.  
---
I do wonder if it was intentional that Amanda specifically got a cigarette and not anyone else...
---
Ah, I see.
---
She looks like Eleven (from Stranger Things not the age, but also, maybe)
---
"You never see it cooooominggggg!"
---
killer: scratched mirror michael with m&amp;a and third seal (just to annoy them for a bit) for the other two perks i pick random stuff
---
another fun killer build: jumpscare freddy, paintbrush and pill bottle with m&amp;a on the game. 
---
one more fun freddy build: class photo with nancy's masterpiece, with these add-ons you can basically snipe survivors and keep all 4 of them in the dream world most of the game. perks i use are pop goes the weasel, bbq, sloppy, either surveillance or discordance. to slow the game down a lot.
---
as for survivor: no mither, object, diversion, dead hard.
---
one that i came up with just the other day but haven't tried yet: bond, empathy, aftercare, either kindred or object. 
---
Lol the game!  No grass at all.  Take the upvote for biting on that one lol.
---
I‚Äôve never seen her fave...
---
Cause I'm a survivor main and I would abuse the shit out of it
---
That's often the best solution.
---
After all the hours of playing or watching someone play, I find that survivors running away in panic are what helps get them spotted so much.  Most killers I have encountered are just walking around, trying to make people panic and seeing what shakes loose;  they don't even bothering looking around things.
---
i cant remember but i have a clip, i'll see
---
No thanks for Angrypug, Sad Pugfan
---
give the hook a radius of so much space... if the  killer is in that radius, the timer wont start on the hook
---
Yeah I obviously saw it and even had a teammate gesturing to leave it. My greed got the best of me. And they didn‚Äôt even untrap me. Totally 100% deserved. 
---
Huh? What in the world are you even talking about. You can look at my post history and see that I've never made a post advocating for rape. Would be strange considering I have had my own experience with sexual abuse. You're nuts and you need help if you think killing any human is okay no matter how late at night it is.
---
or maybe a survivor with lantern glow going to the exit door?
---
Yeah I kind of thought it was blurry enough but anything is possible. 
---
*no uu*
---
Nothing's bad about it if you just bring it, but it's pretty sweaty and toxic to try hiding it until the last second to sneak it when basically everyone else in the match will just take it with them. 
---
Also if I see no cosmetic nobody survivors I might play someone like no addons freddy, or in that specific game I played no addons pig. If I see like all p3 and maybe a legacy or full squadette it tells me I should take the game a bit more seriously because they're gonna be sweating bullets all match, like in my game they were running coms like a mfer even to the point of coordinating flash saves. In a normal game of dbd you don't get that
---
&gt;Foxtrot4504

Np
---
‚ÄúJust let people upload what they want and leave them alone.‚Äù 
---
Well you uploaded it to try to impress sooooooo...
---
Also it‚Äôs kinda heartbreaking to see a survivor with such an altruistic build and then watch him be the biggest dick to poor Daddy Myers. ): 
---
ughhh same ive used bond three times and each time my teammates did nothing besides crouching around the map. it gave me a headache. never again. 
---
Then you wonder why people play Legion
---
Also, who is rape my asshole myers? I usually respond to comments without much attention to their usernames. You seem oddly upset about being called out for being a racist though. Weird.
---
Where is Tru3? He was the one who was developing Legion builds on the PTB back when it was just released, no?
---
the OP that you're so blatantly supporting. you seem oddly upset for being called a rape supporter, though. 
---
Well don't thank me. Try to understand the context better where the word is used in. Also is this your only reply? lol.. Why even reply to me at all then?
---
thinking all females should be raped and they can't complain about it is disgusting and you should be ashamed for even trying to rationalize it.
---
No love for Jendenise, Boxghostz ;w;
---
zubSAD
---
It‚Äôs been on google images for quite some time now. All you have to do is search ‚Äúdbd huntress face‚Äù 
---
I love Edgar. He just had his bday stream too :D
---
Iridescent stone &amp; bloody coil lol
---
Honestly though I missed a new killler announcement and the community was just going wild 
---
forsen subs forsenH
---
Just ignore them. If they're gonna keep coming after you, that's 1 less survivor doing generators.
---
It will always baffle me that Trapper‚Äôs power, one of the weaker powers in the game, is the only one that can actually be destroyed by the survivors. 
---
Is this the new Freddy buff? 
---
Well, as much as I can‚Äôt seem to get away from this game, I fortunately don‚Äôt spend my late nights googling ‚Äúdbd huntress face‚Äù but yes I assume that would probably be the most apt way to find this.
---
We need a buff daddy goth doctor skin now. XD
---
Who thinks that exactly? Where do you see me supporting that? I work with these type of women in my family law internship so I'm curious to know how exactly this is related to me.
---
Graphics wizard here. It's blurry enough for me to doubt anyone could enhance this pic unless they're really, -really- determined and tell an IA to find the same medicine on the internet and enhance it using another photo as a sample. In other words, you're safe.
---
I would like to play against you :D
---
I Love having a good chase as Legion, but most end too fast
---
Someone t-bagging in the open equals someone not on a gen and I‚Äôll just ignore them lmao. Even if they run beside me and try to goad me, I‚Äôm just gonna keep ignoring them. It‚Äôs even better when it happens while I‚Äôm legion cause those are the exact kind of people I‚Äôll Moonwalk and let them bleed out and nod at them. 
---
Also using the plight of women (and men) to defend yourself is just, wow.
---
Was that on apex legends because i saw that too lol
---
&gt; i don't think anyone who uses consoles are inferior  
---
&gt; console peasant
---
I prefer to be sweaty and succesful than a loser and respectful
---
Now Google "dbd Trapper face" :) 
---
Carol wasn‚Äôt very good at survivor.
---
Head nod very slowly. The surest way to thank the Killer is to leave an item as a sacrifice, tho. It's really flattering when this happens.
---
If you're in the dying state, just spin twice and leave asap so you can write GGWP&lt;3 in the post-game chat when you're sure they're looking at it.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
I'd like to play against you too! I swear I am fun to play against. 
---
I do jumping jacks to signal my teammates to rescue me
---
well ya I mean who hasn‚Äôt spent some really fantastic heaven-sent nights googling that tho (Trapper, please call me)
---
Doc here, I'm the Wiki Guardian of the English DbD Wiki. I investigated the issue and resolved it.
---
The number is produced automatically by a Template counting all pages that are categorised as "Survivors". We recently got a Portuguese version of the Wiki up and running. New language versions are done by creating new Articles on the English Wiki and adding a language abbreviation to the name. The creator of the Portuguese Dwight Fairfield Article had forgotten to remove the categories when creating the page and also forgot to delete the Article itself after the new Wiki went up. This lead to there having been 2 Dwight Articles in "Survivors", hence the wrong number.
---
Joey from the Legion, the Spirit. I also like Doctor, I think he's one of the creepiest killers in the game. 
---
(let's not forget daddy Myers)
---
But he just needs the nerf..
---
Yeah I'd imagine at that level it's more of a matter of time before the killer finds you. In lower ranks these tactics can get you unseen the majority of the game, but in the high ranks it becomes much more about outskilling and confrontation than not being seen at all.
---
I really dont get why people ever play freddy, hes shit and nothing about him is fun
---
Maybe I should draw more of the goth doctor lol
---
by the way, im pretty sure ive explained this several times, but when i refer to console peasants, im not referring to everyone who plays console, a console peasant is someone who thinks console is objectively better than PC in terms of power and usefulness  and will do anything to defend it
---
Just tried to check it up.   I didn't receive a confirmation email but there is an open ticket on my account, so hopefully they'll look into it :)
---
Rude
---
I recommend watching the first two at least, they were really good suspense-horror films (albeit with a few plot holes that I'm sure CinemaSins pointed out). 
---
I stopped at Saw 2 because I *heard* the films from there on lost their focus on psychological horror and just became extremely convoluted gore fests. Judging on what I know from Mandy's in-game backstory she gets shot in the neck because she failed her second test due to being blackmailed about something.
---
As for if it is was intentional, only the artist could answer that question. It's a shame a lot of fan-art on here is posted second-hand. I like talking to the artists about their work (as long as they do too :p).
---
Ok the ending was worth it.

Not to say I don‚Äôt like this idea because I really do, having an offering that increases the amount of crows would be great.
---
Where did I ask if rape was wrong?? Are you making stuff up now? 
---
But you only need to use sprint burst to avoid the initial hit the few times you start a chase - once the chase is started, you are trying to keep it going as long as possible. With balanced landing, you need to start a chase in an elevated position, which is hard. With dead hard, you need to be injured to start the chase, which is not ideal. With lithe, you need a safe window nearby once the chase starts, which is the most doable out of the other 2.
---
I‚Äôd like to mention some of the streamers I love watching that aren‚Äôt mentioned here: Jendenise, Geistra, Kittychipz, Vooshy, SwagDracula, Al boyo, Zubat, and Scott Jund.
---
I still don't get why everyone bitches about these. Both are a pain in the ass to deal with but neither are game-breaking mechanics. 
---
no, im using your own arguments against you and you're completely shutting down, it's pretty funny. all your arguments are appeals to emotions and ad hominems, nothing to do with the actual subject. 
---
Same here. Still get flamed afterwards for "not doing anything". :D Well, hold your fucking hands still then. I should change my Steam name to "Wiggle = Camped" so people know what's up.
---
That's... actually a good idea... hold my beer.
---
It's a little faster. No the instructions give you far more uses so it's better for total objectives.
---
Console?
---
Did you fucking see that the other 2 survivors escaped. Funny how you can make all these comments and not actually know what went on in that game apart from those 30 seconds. The Myers wasn't actuly bad in game but I suppose you wouldn't know that.
---
I hope it too :)
---
‚¨ÜÔ∏èüö´SCAM WARNINGüö´‚¨Ü 
---
This listing was created today, almost certainly in response to this post. There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny shirts. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post‚Äôs photo, onto garment preview images.
---
The broken English nonsense description is also a red flag (even though it‚Äôs inadvertantly hilarious). When you buy the shirt, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a shit quality shirt with a fuzzy blurry print.Be careful, friends! 
---
I hope you mean mending because you shouldn‚Äôt heal against a legion
---
*obligatory 'i will make it legal' joke*
---
I don‚Äôt care about shirtless Myers. I do know absolutely care about suit Myers now. BHVR when?
---
If someone is doing Jacks and I save them with no camping killer, I send them a friendly message letting them know what the flailing is telling other survivors. 
---
Flail = Not Safe
---
No Flail = Safe
---
Struggle = Snuggle
---
Wish this happened to me when I play survivor. I also seem to get hit even if the swing is half a meter away.
---
Luck does not dictate the items you get from chests, it merely increases the odds of escaping beartraps and jumping off hooks, you got the key because you were running plunderers or just got really lucky lol
---
It's pretty damn strong. Honestly, never being hooked is only gonna happen in a genrush game. You *will* get hooked, so why not run an obnoxiously underrated perk for when (not if) it happens?
---
If you are near a playable tile without sprint burst, you are forced to use it. 
---
Literally, the best thing about sprint burst is that it starts chases amazingly. No other exhaustion perk can start a chase as easily or reliably. And you don't need to worry about walking around the map when you are looping the killer for 5 generators.
---
Maybe you go down on the 3 or 4th gen pop - just use DS and run away while you wait for that sweet, sweet Adrenaline to activate.
---
Most people are wrong
---
Spicy
---
Oh trust me I know. I‚Äôve seen it at rank 1 too. But in my experience I see it happening waaay more in the lower ranks. 
---
Please, please do more of these. Absolute quality.
---
Well, I am improving. Slowly. I don't have a lot of time to play, so that hinders my progress a bit. Eventually I'll shoot the killer dead with nothing but the fingerguns, I'm sure of it!

His last like 20 youtube uploads he constantly reaffirmed "this teams really strong, these guys are smart." The guy constantly drops tunnels for obvious fair play. Give me a video of him tunneling and BM'ing, cause I swear theres always some guy saying Tru3s toxic and then has zero fucking proof, "OH I DONT HAVE PROOF BUT VISITED HIS STREAM ONCE AND SAW!!!111!!" 
---
Every time.
---
I‚Äôve read the things you‚Äôve been saying and I think they‚Äôre stupid. 
---
Hag's too a point too with a flashlight but it doesn't matter because she always just has traps, compared to Trapper who has to walk around the whole fucking map for them.
---
BOTTOM TEXT
---
well, sir, please try to provide some arguments as to why consoles are better than pc.
---
They were aged up for the game, which I have zero issue with. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
---
We really, really don't care.
---
If you crouch twice really quickly, it‚Äôs like saying thank you.
---
By all means go circlejerk about console peasants in pcmasterrace, but to the rest of the world calling people ‚Äúpeasants‚Äù just makes you look like a dick.
---
Yeah the issue is my favourite boi is 17 but he looks 89.
---
Happens on PS4 as well. The map is bugged to hell. Nothing more infuriating than thinking you gave the killer the slip just to get phantom struck twice and downed, then getting teleported back into the resort.
---
I also do this if I have deliverance.
---
It requires literally no time or knowledge to set up a console, you buy it and plug it in and it‚Äôs ready to play every single game you can buy for it. If you want a gaming PC that doesn‚Äôt cost the Earth you likely have to build it yourself, which a lot of people don‚Äôt have the time for. Even if you don‚Äôt build it, you have to research the various components and software and make sure it‚Äôs powerful enough to run and compatible with the games you want. Consoles don‚Äôt have any of these issues, you can have them up and running in minutes and they require no knowledge, maintenance, or upgrading. 
---
it's linked in the sidebar
---
‚ÄúA-ra-ra-ra, what do we have here‚Äù
---
Honestly it's just survivors bitching because they get 4k'ed when they can usually run circles around other killers, all while pointing and flashlight spamming them. Legion just gave those survivors a run for their money and that makes the sweaty survivor mains salty because it challenges their precious e-peen and ego.
---
Sweet survivor gameplay man I wish I was as good as you
---
Well maybe if BHVR did something about the toxicity and broken Killers instead of making yet another shade for Nea's hair.
---
Thanks 
---
I so rarely get the chance to use them since I don‚Äôt play in a team, I usually bring them to give to someone when I run with plunderers and am usually busy with gens or unhooks. Crackers the only chance a scrub like me has to save.
---
Haha ^^
---
he is a character in a game... i like to play with all characters even if they are not tiered like the others. specially if i like the game as much as this one. plus the feeling of killing every single survivor on a match **knowing** that he is considered the worst killer, it just makes you feel something inside, a burst of happiness on a microscopic level on your chest. 
---
See you.

---
Anyone else cringing at this fake voice? Yikes 
---
My Dwight Build is probably so shit. I run Bond, Leader, Prove Thyself and Unbreakable and escape consistently 
---
Alright. I'll keep playing Killer and getting 4ks against P3 Claudettes that you probably instadodge. And you'll keep flexing *your* e-peen and boasting about how you have a very high IQ because you can follow a dotted line on the ground.
---
Play against a Legion past Rank 20 and then come back and tell us they're skillful and have counters. While I don't consider myself a Legion main I play them a lot and I can tell you as a solid fact that they are the most imbalanced thing in the game currently. They're not the most *overpowered* thing nor are they unfixable (my flair is "Legion's Lawyers" for a reason) but as they are currently they are completely unfun and ignore several parts of the game entirely. "Just gen rush 4head" is not a counterplay strategy, because it's the counterplay strategy for **every** Killer. (And if a Legion gets gen rushed enough they'll probably take game stall like Ruin and late game perks like Remember Me anyways)
---
You are actually the reason that this subreddit is a joke. Ignoring replies that actually tell you why you're wrong to instead tackle the easy bait of someone who's Prestige 2 as Legion telling you that Legion lacks counterplay.
---
I'd tell you why you're wrong if u/Human_Kirby didn't already summarize it perfectly. There's no counterplay in the chase beyond "pallet stun 4head" (which just means that you get M1ed to death) and seeing everyone within *attack range* **through perks/mechanics that counter aura reading** (you can't hide in a locker or use Distortion to counter Legion) is not compariable to a counterable aura reveal several miles away from your location, giving Survivors time to prepare for your arrival and hide, and having counterplay options by hiding your aura in a locker.
---
But again: keep pretending that Legion takes skill because following a dotted line on the ground is hard, somehow. I honestly can't fucking wait for Behavior to get off their lazy asses and nerf Legion despite the fact that I love playing them. It's just so retards like you can stop rank boosting and stop acting like know-it-alls because you're at Rank 17 instead of Rank 20.
---
Then you probably have some kind of medical disorder 
---
Your friends sound like cunts

There are so many memeable snippits of this comic. I think my favorites are Michael in pannel 6 (Trapper and Huntress are freaking out and Mikey just *doesn't care*), "Herman wake up / It's 7 AM", and "OK, THIS IS **PAINFUL...**"
---
As a new player i was wondering if there was a norm to tell people cuz people kept unhooking me right next to the killer and i get auto hooked again
---
also, yes, it will take around 45 minutes if you watch tutorial. it's about as simple as putting together a lego set.

Thanks, I liked some of the movies but the game is pretty bad in my opinion.

What exactly is fun about waiting 7 seconds to hit someone. Thats what makes freddy different, everything else could be done with any other killer

Oh gosh I laughed!!! Loved it! Please make more!

How on earth does someone game with that little mouse room? That looks so uncomfortable(minus the kitty)

I agree. I like that my play style doesn't work against every killer. I like the challenge.

The art and design is so good! One constructive criticism that you can ignore if you‚Äôre not here for comments : the character ‚Äúvoices‚Äù don‚Äôt come through. They all kind of speak the same. It would improve your comics if their speech patterns were more distinct and matched their design/character history more.

I managed to get it to work thanks! 
---
&gt; I heard through the grapevine (i.e. my girlfriend) that both killers were bad, but I'm interested to see how the community feels. 
---
She thinks Spirit is bad? lol no
---
If you find enjoyment out of being macilous towards random people, then go for it. Our time is so precious after all, you should be spending it doing something that rewards fulfillment.
---
god damn deathgarden could not be more dead huh
---
So that killers can actually win by camping even if survivors just do the objective? I think not.
---
Well this is my first time ever posting to this subreddit or making ‚Äùcontent‚Äù for that matter, so I‚Äôm a bit of a rookie but I‚Äôll take note of that, thank you :) 
---
Shes VERY close
---
God I love this
---
i think 80 seconds is fine when doing it solo but maybe if they made it so when 2 people are on a gen it will take 60 seconds instead of 40.
---
Jendenise stopped deranking ever since the big thing went down a month ago or whatever. She is always at rank 1 in her streams. That accusation is also nonsense because if you actually watched her, she is one of the best survivor streamers easily. I‚Äôve watched her solo queue plenty at rank 1 and not get ‚Äúoutplayed‚Äù

Seriously. If a killer catches someone very early game they can get at the very least an easy 2k with camping unless it's a 4-man swf 
---
Calm Spirit play : "Just ignore it, just ignore the atrociously thicc thighs..."
---
There's a fine line between something being too strong and something not being fun.
---
I don't think it's too strong, but I think it's extremely not fun. Fun should always come first, then adjusted for balance. Neither of these things have been done in this situation.
---
I stopped using kindred after the one game where all the 3 survivors were still crouching around the hook, with the killer visible. Some people just cant be helped
---
That was months and months ago, and this is just insight she had learned.  Good to hear though. What does the Spirit do exactly and what makes it good?
---
-Calm Spirit (Quiet boi)
---
-Balanced Landing (I've done a lot of dumb shit that usually entailed jumping from high places, I got this one)
---
-Deja Vu (i'm pretty good with directions)

-Decisive strike (If I have to, I can get ugly)

*laughs in claudette*

Every single thing you said relies on the person playing legion to be bad, that's not countering that's them being awful, so no there is no counter play

everybody gangsta til quentin see some shit
---
Imma have to go to church for this one.
---
Yep, I say this every single time I see a thread like this pop up. Killers never want to acknowledge this side of the argument.

Can not add objectives or extended repair time without also stopping camping. The issues are linked.

Literally. I had to swap out my shadowborn just to counter it. If they gonna rush gens nights as well go for a late game build

---
Welcome back! 
---
Legion is pretty debatable, and is supposedly going to get reworked. He can be fun to play as sometimes and is good for BP grinding but going against him isn‚Äôt fun. Not in a whiny salty Survivor way. But it just literally is boring spending half the game mending even if you do usually escape. His perks aren‚Äôt terrible, but they aren‚Äôt getting used really, other than Discordance, allowing the killer to see when gens are worked on buy 2+ people.
---
I think Spirit is great and many argue that she‚Äôs top-tier. Her difficulty is listed as Hard but I picked her up fairly easily and I am a terrible killer. She is very fun to play as her map pressure is good and the mindgame potential is wonderful. And zooming around the map is so satisfying. Her perks are all decent in my opinion. Spirit Fury and Enduring are perks that go together for good spooks as well. I highly recommend trying her out.
---
I don‚Äôt know if the meta has changed so much. I have changed my own survivor build though since a nice buff to Prove Thyself. People still run DS and NOED, and people still whine about them both. Oh and half this subreddit is memes which you probably remember. üòÇ
---
Ive said this once and I‚Äôll say it again; I want to read the chat!
---
I probably should have said that you wouldn‚Äôt run in there in a chase. If you get caught you are kinda fucked.
---
Also had a game as Wraith (lost the screenshot) where **every** gen was in the lower floor. To be fair one person didn't load in so IDK if the one gen that despawned was the one upstairs.
---
Yeah, I just thought of the first thing I could I think of. I think a better example is mastering Doctor shocks so you can also interrupt a window.

Yeah same here. I think he‚Äôs fun for the various reasons you‚Äôve stated in other comments. I don‚Äôt even think he‚Äôs that bad. 
---
Myers is kinda immortal I think ? Maybe him.
---
Leatherface is too thicc to die. Huntress is also a good contender because swole mom best mom. One of them.
---
Shook Huntress in panel 6 is killing me
---
What was he like in the beginning ?
---
He tried that on jason. 
---
Photoshop level over 9000.
---
I still enjoyed your post.
---
Ignore him on the basis that there is no ‚Äúkiller code‚Äù. However, next time I recommend breaking contact in match. They want you to chase them but they are easier to kill when trying to unhook someone else in the basement. You‚Äôre the killer, so how the match plays is on your terms &gt;:)
---
Holy shit baby killer lmao
---
I wrote a little essay on how to get better at chainsawing people. I also stocked up on shitloads of instant saw's with 100+ Guide's and Mixes. I did that by using the Bulb + Spark Plug and grinding away. The downside to using the Bulb + Spark Plug is the longer recovery on the saw. 
---
You did the right thing, he's just a salty bisnatch
---
He said afterwards that he only played Myers for the daily ritual
---
Michael Myers.
---
He's pretty much impossible to kill and will just relentlessly stalk down every last killer until they're all dead.
---
Nothing flashy, no frills, just straight up unrelenting brutality.
---
Is it really selling out if its a game he enjoys playing and hes doing it competitively?
---
Every tryhard killer
---
I point and do 1 tbag, then I slowly walk away. Its a passive gesture.
---
I know I know, it's just that I want to destroy my desk (one day it will break, it's thin wood lol) when I get tunneled, so I try my best not to be a toxic killer to others
---
As a console player, lag is always an issue
---
Ok but what‚Äôs keeping him from just waiting for the last person to be left standing to only go against them at the end?
---
I bet the doctor dreams about freddy
---
His annoying laugh, static sound is just unpleasant.  It all got old real fast for me.

---
Lol at the killers in the comments. If you slug for the 4K you‚Äôre sweaty as fuck. 
---
Both work- like you won‚Äôt get better if you focus on solely easy pickings, you have to chase experienced players to get better loop reads. One lost game isn‚Äôt the end of the world.
---
My fav thing is when they unhook or heal and the healthy one runs straight at you to take the aggro. Like, yeah right bitch.
---
Some assembly required
---
Idk why you‚Äôre downvoted, noed and slugging to stop the hatch are both super fucking sweaty. 
---
I had this happen once and it was... Interesting. I did my best to break totems, hook save and heal, etc. I got to practice my killer distracting skills, which I‚Äôm admittedly horrible at, too. 3/10, would not recommend.
---
Doesn't this design already have the "worn down" look with the bags under her eyes and the slightly closed eyes? And the wild hair.  
---
TBH, this design is so cool, I want it to be official.  
---
Or there could be a hidden Prestige 4 that would allow you to take the masks/faces off of all the Killers.  
---
For any distorted Killers, like Wraith or Hillybilly, it could show what they were like before the Entity got them.  
---
For Freddy, it could be like before he was burnt.  
---
For Leatherface, his original face would be nice. (If he has one, I dunno.)
---
The only perk I feel is underrated is Alert. Ive been using it and I have not once regretted it.
---
I try to do the "come here" gesture before unhooking to make sure my quarry knows to follow me after we unhook
---
I always flail my limps when the killer heads off to say 'I want to get off this hook please'
---
I looked at their Twitter history out of curiosity.  
---
This artist is... very... uh... interesting when it comes to the ships and the... other art they draw.,
---
Self care, Iron will, Dead hard, then any perk, maybe bond, borrow time ect.
---
Nothing to do with that. I know they're SWF for how they play, for their builds and for the ranks.
---
Haha, I do remember that. What's the prove thyself buff?  Also, good write up. 
---
I bet if you cut him into small pieces with bubba he wont be so brutal anymore xD
---
Tier 4 huntress lullaby.
---
It's a great perk, but I'm more of a bond guy. 
---
Sometimes getting a good map for Killer is better than being able to Mori the last Survivor. Ever play Huntress on Gideon Meat Plant? Moris don't matter if you can't down anyone.
---
I don‚Äôt see why they can‚Äôt make a requirement for people to be within a certain rank to be able to SWF. It‚Äôs unfair for mid rank killers to go up against rank 1‚Äôs and rank 15‚Äôs the same game. It‚Äôs not terribly hard to rank up in this game so their friends could just grind to their ranks. 
---
Well go chase one of them then, they're clearly not doing gens anyway.
---
Not if they were rated in terms of blood points and not longevity 
---
Getting a touch of the vapors, dearie?
---
I love Lithe (Feng Min) and Urban Evasion (Nea Karlsson)!
---
When I play survivor, I definitely go more stealth. I play Claudette and run Iron Will, Lithe, Empathy, and Urban Evasion. I‚Äôll switch our Empathy or Iron Will once in a while for another perk, but I‚Äôve always got Lithe and Urban on. 
---
Because walking slows the game and gets people killed. 
---
lol David taking a leisurely stroll there
---
Oh no, I comprehend your jokes, they're just not good. There's no point in a comeback, that would only make me look as ridiculous as you. I'm just sitting back and watching you completely destroy the very little dignity you have left. 
---
I get this. It‚Äôs kind of annoying for me when I‚Äôm playing and I come up against a Myers with NOED (or other 1 hit killers)
---
Maybeeee
---
No. You can play the game however you want. If someone loops me on some of the broken infinite loops like the deck on backwater swamp I will tunnel them for the entire game to get my face camp satisfaction 
---
OH BOI
---
&gt; His teachable Tinkerer allowed his charge time for his chainsaw to be ridiculously fast
---
WTF are you talking about? Before they changed Tinkerer the charge time on the saw with good add-ons was 2 seconds. And after they changed Tinkerer it was still the same, 2 seconds. 
---
He's good for farming though. Maybe not for the kills, he's pretty bad at downing people with his frenzy without the add-ons, that's why I usually just hit survs with the regular M1 after injuring them. Which pretty much makes feral frenzy worthless, asides from that  easy first hit. 
---
Try the usain Bubba build. Play with your food+the 2 marks add ons. You'll go soo damn fast with your chainsaw, it's crazy. Try it 
---
Correct 
---
Survivor main here: I live for NOED games. It's the only thing that gets me going. Every game I purposefully gen rush in hope that the killer runs NOED.  I gotta hold on to that hope. I preserve it because I need it. It keeps me sharp, on the edge, where I gotta be. 
---
For survivors try the immersed build:
---
Urban evasion, lightweight, quick and quiet, lithe or dance with me. You'll pull some crazy plays with it 
---
He is fun to play and the team I was against very nearly won, but they forgot how to do gens with one left so  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø  Like I said i'm survivor main so I can concede to when survivors play poorly or the killer did really well.
---
I really wish I didn‚Äôt click that 
---
I love how you managed to grab your phone and take a pic at 3 seconds left. Close one, my friend!
---
All they associate Jen with is ‚Äúderanking to face bad killers REEE‚Äù even though she‚Äôs shown time and time again that it‚Äôs not the case. They just want any reason to hate on her.
---
It was an example of an idea...and when was the last time Jake park had an add-on that helped out an ok there survivors speed? But it's fine, just keep being a smart ass online, I'm sure you will make tons of friends big guy. Good luck
---
*I didn't think about overcharge scaring off survivors, I could see that working especially against a pig as they may think she will creep over, but against a standard terror radius killer they probably won't be scared off it as they can just hide when the heartbeat starts.
---
* Going against survivors who don't make mistakes you will struggle regardless of what perks you take but I still think the overcharge skillcheck is too easy to hit for most survivors, plus one tends to just run round all the gens popping them on purpose and stopping the regression.
---
* Also wondering if you bring 2+ gen perks, is it worth taking brutal strength? Its not always worth kicking gens if you know a survivor is nearby but it saves time and helps in the chase.
---
Hm, i really dont understand why *only* the African male characters receive such luxurious cosmetics
---
They really should fix this, it gives killer big adventage when tracking 
---
Please stab me dadd.... I mean,good job!!
---
I blame Panda if you won't.  I understand the entertainment aspect of your vids, but for the love of Spider God, stop muddying the waters, my guy.  
---
You say that as if you had any dignity but you left that long ago. You pretend to get the joke but it may as well be an inside joke because of how you feel so alone. You‚Äôre calling me ridiculous but you‚Äôre the one who keeps coming back like you‚Äôve got something to prove but you‚Äôre only proving that the worst joke here is you. This was my post, I‚Äôve been the one sitting back, now you can either continue to be my poor sad jester or you can leave my presence. 
---
He enjoys witch hunting people for not sharing his opinion and obsessively goes on arguments with the entire community just to prove he‚Äôs right when in reality he‚Äôs a man child that refuses to see different aspects of an argument. 
---
NOED rewards killers for failing pretty much like DS. I‚Äôd be fine with NOED if 3 only did instant down like it used to but now it‚Äôs every tier. 
---
I'm aware that this is the popular method, so of course it's the one that I use, but I still insist that this way makes no sense. For one: when the killer is camping and you start flailing it lets the killer know someone is nearby trying to save you. Also, it makes more sense to have flailing mean urgency, as in, "hes left quick help me before he comes back". 
---
Life has been hard for poor Dexter
---
Perfect for tunneling if you lose hooked survivor, you hit other surv to see him
---
Bag of seed offering.
---
The hero we needed.  Go forth, person who's name I can't be added to pronounce 
---
I made it at -4 and it went up again dude.
---
This is amazing! GG EZ baby killer lol
---
There's something special about trapper's face / mask on panel #2
---
I see her bald head when in Dream World using Freddy
---
If you're using it on Freddy do your thing.  He's the only killer still weak enough to justify the use.  If you're anyone else it's simply a safety net to crutch out a kill or more endgame after getting destroyed and applying no map pressure.  No other killer in game needs it post pallet vacuum removal.  Chases end quickly if you're not a potato.  It rewards poor play much in the same vein of Decisive Strike and the killers that use it rely on it at the end to salvage their game.  Taking out 5 totems only works in swf randoms can and will allow it to take effect every game.  Devs buffing it to work on every level was the worst decision made since they removed the timing temporarily from flashlight saves.  At rank 1 75% of the killers I face use the crutch.  Billy's, Myers, Clowns, Spirits it doesn't matter the opponent.
---
They switched that, and totem spawn recently so it's tough to say. I haven't memorized the new ones yet ;^; haven't been playing the event
---
Ever play survivor on meat plant? That map is horrible in general for both sides 
---
Petition to get Bhvr to add "hook gymnastics" to the loading screen tips and tutorial?
---
If you bamboozle one of the two windows, and chase her, she can only use the second window 3 times. Which you should be able to force her to do within 20 seconds or less. So I'm not sure how this chase took 3 times as much?
---
Oh really ? I see
---
You just explained the exact opposites of why I like true. I mean people literally make memes about how often he acknowledges other players skill: "nice" 
---
And plus I have noticed that he rarely tunnels and most of the time just blatantly ignores unhooks and continues doing whatever he was already doing
---
I know this isn't helpful, but I've not experienced any of this. I've been hit by D-Strike plenty of times.
---
Lol I do that too just to encourage them to waste the juggle time 
---
I didn‚Äôt have bamboozle. Only enduring and got the pallet on my head halfway through? I swear I‚Äôm decent as killer but this meg was unreal. Legacy 3 outfit and just flew. I was Rank 4 and she was rank 1. Maybe I was at a jungle gym? Trying to learn the lingo. 
---
That‚Äôs Brandon Rogers on FBE LMAO
---
It‚Äôs from the day in the park reacts
---
As a fellow data-nerd, I appreciate this info (it is also hilarious, I wonder if that would be possible with any other killer). Going to try this out after resetting.
---
Doin gens, you?
---
This was so great to read! Very informative. I really am not good a killer and this *almost* makes me want to play as legion just to not hook people. 
---
Emoting at the killer is usually considered a taunt.
---
Bro pressure gens and you shouldn't be chasing anyone that long.  I play Wraith and Trapper consistently at rank 1.  The last thing this games balance needs is another killer buff.  We took their pallet vacuum and destroyed their building spawns.  Do we really need any more help.  Play efficiently, pressure gens and stop the babyraging.  And they're absolutely right adding more time to gens would absolutely benefit the scumbag campers.
---
Daily legion thread insulting it's user? Check 
---
You just reminded me of how much I missed my other hex perks.
---
I used to run ruin and haunted ground... fun times
---
Not DS but have had it happen on gens where I'd go to start repairing and it wouldn't do anything. Worst part was when me and a teammate was by a gen...I stop working on it to heal her and next thing I know BOOM! Like wtf?! 
---
Just get used to tracking it by sound and focus on covering and much new ground as possible during the search.  I get the hatch in these scenarios about 4 out if every 5 games.
---
I feel you dude: I missed it so many times that I actually stopped using it.
---
Possible problems are:
---
A: Your TV's response time (the higher it is, the worse)
---
B: your ping (the higher the worse) 
---
C: your controller's delay time (time for the command you gave on the controller to transmit to the console) 
---
The possible solutions are:
---
For problem A: set your TV on game mode/ switch to a smaller TV, which usually has less response time. 
---
For problem B: try connecting your console to your modem using an ethernet cable and be sure not to have too many devices connected to the wifi/too many downloads going on. 
---
For problem C: if you have a new generation Dualshock controller you can go in settings and set the cablated connection as the main communication connection between you controller and your console. 
---
Sorry for any typo: English is not my main language. 
---
Hope this helps
---
Today one Meg actually blinded me with them. I was another survivor and had no idea where I'm running so the killer got me xD
---
Honest question - why even play then? If that one scenario is what makes you have fun then what's the point?
---
I like the Swamp. As a killer, yes. I mean Grim Pantry, I don't like boat
---
&gt; and literally nobody does all the dull totems on the map so it's almost gaurunteed it'll be up.
---
Criticizing a perk for the survivor's personal incompetence is a weird route to take
---
Thank you for the advice! I know Pinhead is a totally different guy, but I just made him funnier. If actual Pinhead join in DBD, everyone will be afraid of him. 
---
Usually play Claudette... never use any of those perks. 
---
The funny thing is, this guy is a Billy main. If he‚Äôs having trouble with survivors as Billy, he‚Äôs simply not a very good killer and needs a lot of work.
---
Yeah, what the Dick, OP?
---
How you just gonna disrespect our memey boi like that?

---
If you're underage, then you missed being diddled by ochido.
---
Wow dude-_-
---
Get yo dirty ass back here
---
Are we sure the survivor didn't T-bag Leatherface?
---
Because the only time I personally do that as Leatherface or HillBilly is when someone T-bags. Then it's a "how do you like it" thing.
---
There needs to be more comics and things like this that just have the killers being "casual"
---
I see, I don't play them 'cause i'm not rich to spend 10 reais on the game, also I don't play surv so I've never seen them in action since the PTB.
---
Thanks for the explanation.
---
Both are bitch perks that have the possibility to grant you a free win when you were losing.
---
Yeah, Adrenaline really needs to be nerfed. It does far too much against Freddy to be justified.
---
My tracking is so bad I miss people when I hit them --'
---
What joke? There is no joke here. If you purposely acting like a child is a joke... Then jokes have totally gone down the shitter these days. Wow, funny, 10/10 /s. And no, I'm only coming back so you can keep going, not because I have anything to prove. It's just entertaining. It's great when you think you're the one playing me, but you're the one getting played. Keep it up, you're doing a great job. üëç
---
* Do not publicly shame other players.
---
I'm currently rank 3 but I'm mostly matched up against 1s and 2s. 
---
&gt;I don't see it happening at rank 1? Not without playing **scummy** and **hard tunneling** off a hook at least
---
I don't care what other people think of *scummy* play. I play to win, plain and simple. That said, if you hard tunnel as Freddy you're going to get wrecked by survivors. 
---
Balanced.. landing(?) and Dead Hard? Question Mark
---
I see that nip slip ;)
---
Lol got you.  I can take it from your repetition of the hard tunneling line that you take the rank 17 approach to playing Frederick.  Makes sense.
---
Exactly!
---
Guys be real. This is all of us. 
---
Would be dope to have pinhead
---
You don‚Äôt know true annoyance until your cat jumps on you mid chase lol. Mine has recently taken to standing on my shoulder while I play 
---
Yah sometimes they slip up
---
lol what? 
---
What dat mouf do, tho?
---
I mean... is she wrong then?
---
Do you only care about the achievements, or are you actually going to play/learn survivor?
---
I'd definitely recommend David King first if you want to actually play survivor. His "We're Going to Live Forever" perk gives 100% BP bonus at level 3, so you'll want the teachable of that (Level 30) ASAP.
---
Claudette, her cosmetics are perfect for staying hidden.
---
To get the old school Best Survival Rate build, you need Bond from Dwight and Sprint Burst from Meg, Rest is free by default.
---
^^Same
---
I get where you are trying to go with this but Dexter wasn't a doctor, so it's a stretch.
---
No
---
Uh oh, neither give you a free win you weirdo.  What is a win to you anyways? I‚Äôm curious 
---
Even if she is right she doesn‚Äôt have to be an ass about it. Just saying GG would have been fine. It kind of seems like she or they would have been toxic players. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Rin be like: *Continue...*
---
Ty from a rank 15 killer
---
DC
---
Too much?
---
This is why as the killer I just let the players DS and we resume the chase. 
---
The only thing that keeps going is me and your mom ; ) and of you don‚Äôt even get how much of a joke your life is then that‚Äôs even more sad. Clearly you‚Äôre in denial and don‚Äôt even realize you have to prove to yourself that you‚Äôre not so much of a joke, though I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs easy enough because it really isn‚Äôt funny, you‚Äôre a joke and it‚Äôs disappointing. And yes, I am being played, or atleast my penis is but you‚Äôre mom clearly doesn‚Äôt understand how to play flute.
---
ISSA JOKE.
---
could have been a joke tbh
---
Slowing it just 50% doesn't really work. Freddy has to wait to hit people, they should have to wait to continue working on something until the dream transition finishes, as well.
---
I use enduring so DS has never been a really big problem to me
---
oh wow I just got out of a match with a camping leatherface too lmao
---
Yeah, honestly I find Pugs gameplay to be pretty entertaining, but not the type I‚Äôd ever sub or donate too for the reason you gave. Seems more the money hungry type streamer like you said...whereas others I like seem really genuinely appreciative when people give. He‚Äôs the kinda guy I put on when the usual people I watch aren‚Äôt on. 
---
Yup, enduring is a pretty good counter as well. 
---
Dude you should get that couch checked out by a carpenter 
---
You mean, killers prefer a 4k over a 3k?
---
We needed more piggy gal
---
YES!
---
Pig mains rise up 
---
If I just did several gens and chased for the last few I am not going back for the Dwight who hid in a locker all match
---
Actually no, I watched pretty much every video on his YouTube channel up till about about two months ago. Any survivors who do better then him must be survive with friends. You are right in saying I haven't seen any of his newer uploads and personally I have never been to his stream. Everything I had said had been from what I had seen of his. I also stated on another reply here when I meant tunneling I don't mean goes out of his way to get the unhook, but if it's done in his face. I apologize for that misunderstanding. In his older videos that I had seen most times a survivor outplayed him he would say they were abusing a broken part of the game. He's really good at the game, but he acted like no one could be better. That is what I meant.
---
Lawwwl ok, I‚Äôm gonna leave the hook while gens are done and gates are open.
---
You fully blacked out every other name and might as well have not done anything for his. Easy witch hunt right here.
---
They dont extend the same courtesy.
---
interesting concept
---
Prove Thyself used to give a small bonus to most actions of teammates nearby. Now it‚Äôs only Repair speed but it‚Äôs 10% per survivor now so running it with toolboxes and the Bond perk gets gens done fast... as long as the killer doesn‚Äôt have that Discordance perk I mentioned. (; 
---
Also they added a BP bonus to co-op actions which is nice for the rough survivor grind. I‚Äôm enjoying it a lot so far.
---
noob3's loadout. he uses dead hard whenever possible, and balanced landing for the staggered effect and only sometimes the sprint burst
---
The idea was the cat, right?! 
---
Your logic is flawless, bravo sir.
---
To fix hold ALT and press L :p

I'm not saying go to the other side of the map, just don't camp. Even if the gate's are open a hooked survivor should still be given a chance to get away. It's no fun if you've got a guaranteed win.
---
Then don't release the game in said countries. Not that it matters because people there will either pirate it or buy/play with a VPN. Also please, show me 1 country where you can't buy movies that show on-screen violence that involves minors.

There is a yellow mori as well

I appreciate your feedback. Some canvasing we did during conventions and on some other sites showed some support for the idea so we're taking a shot. 
---
Choosing your battles is getting better at the game, being taunted into a losing battle is dumb so just call yourself george mcfly

It's crazy how rank 5-10 survivors forget they can croutch to avoid traps. Maybe because of the big gray. 
---
It's just the ones who fit ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è really think Billy is going to look right in a suit?
---
Don't know if this is a glitch/or mouse problem. I am having this problem where I can't heal others, even though I'm holding down the mouse, it stops in a split second, like tapping a gen, but not repeating. I can repair and heal myself just fine, which is what is strange. Anyone know what is happening?
---
I am experiencing the healing problem on PC. And I have been having problems with Billy's chase music cutting out, which is even worse! That's been happening a long time.
---
Wraith nor Doc have never come across to me as African. Honestly didn't even think of their race until this comment. Now they're black. Yay 
---
While I'm not going to go through each individual point here, I will say that in spite of all of Freddy's weaknesses, he does have *some* strengths (Transition mindgame/best tracking in the game/arguably best power-based stall).  Granted, these aren't used by the bad Freddys and even the good Freddy players can get screwed by RNG.  IMO all he needs are some number tweaks like Wraith and Hag got to be golden, maybe getting the Blue Dress built in or something.  TBH I'd rather they leave him alone than give him a complete rework that could very well leave Freddy mains out in the cold like it seems like we're getting.
---
Psuedo-back on topic, I agree on the point of trash players using Freddy poorly.  It doesn't help that his power requires a lot more thought than other, more effective killers.  I don't blame the killer, I'm not even mad at the players that use him as a Tunnel Simulator.  I'm always just disappointed. 
---
The devs honestly could make a whole new cash cow if they made a god damn Mori shop where you can buy all sorts of different moris. Wonder why they don't just do it. 
---
Probably not, we already see the amount of skilled players de-ranking on purpose. I'd assume those people wouldn't care about rank and jump into un-ranked just to stomp the casuals.
---
I remember during a dev stream they said something about gore and keeping rating in some countries. I do find it a little disappointing but they made a decision for money. The gore from friday the 13th is probably the only area I think it has this game beat its got some pretty true to horror executions.
---
Id be fine with that i guess

Jesus Christ, I didn't need to see this.
---
I had a satisfying cocky moment today wish I had saved the recording. An adam was hard to catch he was good at looping. Finally caught up and hit him as he vaulted a window. So on the other side he teabagged and then turned and pointed at me... he was a bit to close to window and I hit him through the window he even did that half backflip down like when you hit them at a run. His friend then tried to flashlight save him when I picked him up but failed so he DC'd and then 5 seconds later so did his flashlight friend. Felt good.
---
Bullshit
---
Freddy just looks so happy
---
if u hook each player twice i think they should.

And i agree, i just say that the hawk guy here is safe from that since the chances of someone getting his actual profile are slim
---
And so? You can make assumptions on where the traps may be but every hag seems to be different on their choice of trap spots. It's highly frustrating without urban evasion and even if you have it your teammates may not. Earlier I was playing a match against one and I unhooked an Adam after urban evading past the trap. I kept urban evading but he didn't have it so he got up and triggered a trap by a nearby pallet and she downed me with make your choice. Also it seems all hags must come back to a hook right before a person dies on it and then tunnel the person if they are unhooked.
---
Genuine: Hag
---
Meme: Nea
---
the cat is possessing him
---
the cat is the true killer
---
Maybe because half of the oldest and non-licensed male Killers are african[-american]?
---
Don't disagree there but I'm talking about games where some don't even get hooked. I've had matches as killer where I get completely stomped by a good team and still pip.
---
Laughs in cat.
---
That's why it's unpopular opinion cause everyone seems to focus on their hatred towards legion 
---
Wait till he is 2 and he still wants too...

ahh thats never happened to me, if i play a god swf and i hook maybe 2 of them i lose a rank.
