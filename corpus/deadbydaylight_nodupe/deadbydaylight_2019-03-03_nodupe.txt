How can you abuse constant 50% reduction to action speed and being revealed to the killer for like the entire game?

No. What I want is a perk that can be useful and not just something that'll be wasted with me on the ground. It's not like borrowed time where a short timer is fine. You need some time so you aren't just left on the ground. Consider this. It's used as intended and youre pulled off hook and then youre slugged as he goes after the other guy. Pointless. He'd just leave you and it'd be pointless.
---
The tier list is the same on PC, XBOX and PS4 it is just harder to play killers like Nurse on console. It is still the same character.
---
That’s why you download a recording software whilst it’s happening, record it, and open a ticket on their support site and they’re pretty good about banning pieces of shit there as long as you have easily accessible proof.
---
Freddy has tracking that can be used against him, his stealth is good, and his mind games are situational and inconsistent as best. 
---
Spirit is within the 3 best killers in the game in chases, has superior mind games to Freddy and above average map control. She does have tracking, only her tracking relies on the players skill rather than the killer themselves. 
---
Keep in mind map control and chase potential are the two most important things for a killer to have with mindgame potential being a close third. 
---
Tracking isn’t that relevant, I mean look at doc. He is the best tracker in the game but is considered in the top 5 worst killers by the majority of the playerbase. 
---
Sure. I'm down for a shameless plug!
---
Damn these are great, loving the bell
---
*Screaming in heavy breathing*
---
Good point, I forgot about that.
---
Agreed. Plus they have other perks with second chances but they have some counter-play to them.
---
Deliverance - Get off the hook. Borrowed time - extra hit off the hook. Adrenaline- instant heal + sprint burst. Unbreakable - get off the floor.
---
What do killers have? Totem perks that are broken almost instantly at the start of the game; like they can literally take away our perks for the rest of the game. Yikes.
---
I play Nurse because of SWF. Only the sweatiest tryhards would keep playing Nurse and complaining if they deleted SWF. I'd rather play low tier killers, but I'd much rather not get my shit pushed in every game.
---
Can I have a mp3 file so I can set this as my ringtone
---
Fair point, but it isn't always optimal. Sometimes the unhooked person manages to heal fully, sometimes he manages to hide and escape. Plus yes a survivor healing is wasted time but a survivor dead is way better. I care about people having fun but in the same time I care about winning. All of this of course depends on what I'm facing. If I come up against a bunch of randoms who are uncoordinated and just trying to have fun, not take it too seriously I do the same. I play nicely and won't try to piss anyone off and 9/10 I'll give someone the hatch. If I however come up against a super coordinated good team who are playing smart and good at looping or a strong swf team then ill play smart too since we're all doing that. I think that's a fair treatment, but that's subjective 
---
Damn 5 fps lmao
---
I can easily get 3 kills REGULARLY. Would be 4 but stupid hatch.
---
What the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land
---
I play only one killer, so I don't know if this theory is true, but I get a lot of different maps when I play Spirit.
---
Lately with survivors, though, I've been getting that shitty ass map that has a tree in the middle (always forget the name), and I feel this is on purpose, maybe they want data from matches in that map, 'cause before I rarely saw that one and now I've been getting it over and over, sometimes twice in a row.
---
No, I ain... I ain't talkin' about that freak, alright. He's not here is he?
---
*Evil Within Tier III music plays*
---
How do I get this fucking thing off?!
---
Cries in console. 
---
Even if you actually vault the window and are 5ft away, you somehow still get hit. 
---
Do you have a flair? I'm on mobile so I can't see. if not you should ask the mods about it
---
Skin for Clown for sure! 
---
Blinded By Fear is the only killer perk I feel is remotely balanced...
---
There's a me at the end of that remind
---
Snitches get stitches!

They all look really good, but for the life of me i dont remember who has the axe on the bottom.

go check it's awesome comics
---
It made noise, but there was no model and he couldn't get in. Never seen this before.
---

---
No?  I started my opinion. That suffices for me.
---
Yeah it's called a censer my guy. Common in many religions and some spiritual paths. Also big in the catholic church. Which is what I think they're leaning towards.
---
Thank you!! It was the most relaxing thing to draw, so flowy!!
---
He was like I saved you and you really left me wow 
---
Some context - was doing a daily and practicing Huntress at the same time. Got looped a shit ton in the match and downed one in the hut as the gates were opened, so played the camp lure game. 
---
Got the good ol' teabag taunting, and neither one ran out despite both being injured, and thankfully, snagged the teabagger with a hatchet in the gate, and got to take him to hook town as well :D 
---
I would love my perks to be useful every game as well but unfortunately survs spawn on ruin or find it in the first 30 seconds and then i have 3 perks for the rest of the game its risk reward.
---
 If he slugs you how is it useless? it served its purpose you have not been tunneled and someone else will get you up seems like its working well to me.
---
Lets address your idea of a 3 min timer for ds.
---
You've just been saved from the hook and I'm somewhere else starting a chase with another survivor. Lets say it take 1 min any longer and I'm probably losing. In this time you have been saved healed and found a gen to work on no problem there all pretty standard. So i hook this new guy and bbq procs i see a humanoid shape on a gen no way to tell who so i go over there. Shit its you you have ds wtf am i meant to do i dont no where the other survs are maybe dwight was in a locker there probably already crouching over for the save. I cant just leave you on the gen so i chase you and down you again. This takes what another min at most wtf do i do now leave you on ground and hope? i just committed a gen worth of time in to chasing you.
---
His face looks weird xd
---
Why are there so many all of a sudden 
---
Noob3:uses pallet” I’m sO tOxIc”
---
Deserved that, just leave already and stop wasting everyone's time.
---
I’m gonna love the new DS change, it’s gonna make playing LF easier unless you’re doing a basement build.
---
Honestly sounds pretty good
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
I still don't know why we need to button mash. Button mashing is a fad that died with the old God of War games. We should just have a "give up" button instead. All struggling does is break keyboards / controllers and make you more prone to accidentally dying due to a hardware glitch.
---

When I kill you, could you fall down right here? That'd be great, thanks! 
---
I don’t see a lot of salt on dbd but sometimes people can get super salty.
---
Instead of shirtless, how about suit?
---
All I see is that medkit with full charge being wasted..
---
See I hear this being said all the time but I have yet to see someone actually SHOW us gameplay of them "knowing how to play him" that doesn't just amount to survivors making dumb mistakes against him. *shrugs*
---
what app is that?
---
Myers asserting dominance over 4 teenagers
---
Pretty decent suggestions, post it on the official forums, because people keep suggesting making small game show the totems
---
My only complain about your suggestion is that it should say how many you cleansed, since it still remains a mistery if your team cleansed the last totem or not
---
What’s the top right
---
The only rank that seems to mean something is for killer. The games start to get sweaty around purple/red ranks.
---
Oh, whatever it is it still looks good
---
It should be a skill check every 5 seconds, if missed, there is a penalty, that way you can’t sit on the hook doing absolutely nothing as the last survivor, and you have to stay alert
---
Nothing yet. They don't like hatch standoffs because it SUCKS, and isn't fair to either side. But they haven't found a solution they like yet. Several solutions included the killer being able to reclose a hatch temporarily or permanently, but it made killer too strong.
---
Slender man is a fictional character and what happened is in the past if this was really how it was all murder would be illegal in games
---
That was an incredible escape. 
---
As for him hitting you through the window... well, vaults can be a bad idea. You need a fair amount of distance between yourself and the killer in order to not catch a machete across the back. 
---
They missed their ds too
---
&gt;since it still remains a mistery if your team cleansed the last totem or not
---
As it should be. 
---
Yeah everyone says somewhere around purple-green ranks are the best.
---
My personal opinion is that Hag's and Doctor's abilities need more colors. Maybe miniature glyphs on hag's trap, and streaks of white or yellow on the branches of Doc's electricity.   
---
Clown's bottle is pimpin', though.
---
One match I ignored every hooking and did like 3.5 gens solo. I got hooked after gates, and the chat said it was my fault for being useless. I'm sorry you guys just got chased the whole time. 
---
My most embarrassing was when I first tried killer. I tried trapper, couldn't figure out how to place traps--and stepped into my own traps repeatedly when I placed them. I was so bad that the survivors after the game added me as steam friends to give me killer tips.
---
Disembowel them and stuff your weapon into what remains of their colon. 
---
Yeah they were definitely all SWF. They just messaged me again (7 hours later) saying they were reporting me again lol. I don’t mind hate mail, it’s being reported for no reason that annoys me 
---
Would Hand Banana be the killer?
---
It's good if you're running sabotage, but... yeah. Not great.
---
Think about what that means on a national level in Russia as well...
---
I was having this issue too like a month ago! 
---
Generally you're going to want to make sure you're as close as possible. 
---
Ideally if they are physically body blocking you from moving past them (to be safest, but you can be a bit farther especially with add-ons).
---
It feels weird at first but you get used to it once you realise you're effectively extending the chase by a few seconds now to cut it much shorter compared to hitting them normally.
---
I was thinking spaghetti as the killer. 
---
Bing Bong
---
Think about what that means on a national level in Russia, as well...
---
I love how Reddit just circlejerks about how bad Freddy is rather than play him and realize he's better than what he's given credit for.
---
Good job with his placement OP, Freddy is definitely solid. He just has a high skill cap, and people don't like to hear they play him incorrectly. 
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Imo they should just make it where dying light's effects, once activated, cannot be undone. Therefore once the current obsession dies, dying light is active the rest of the match 
---
Thank you! :D I hope you do, I’d love to see! 
---
I want to do Hallowed Blight Huntress someday as well but Boar was a more interesting project for me to try at first atleast ^ ^ It’s really interesting and really cool working with faux fur even if it’s a hell to clean up and I keep sneezing every half minute but I love trying out a new fabric/material! It’s so much fun and I’m so excited to finish this mask! :3 
---
I wish you the best of luck doing the costumes! If you ever feel like you need someone to ball some ideas with me I’d love to talk and see if I can help you come with ideas or something! C:
---
If a team of 4 solos manage to get the 5 gens done under 5 minutes dont you think that might be on the killer for being bad?
---
Oh, hell if I didn't. Goddamn was it so annoying. Survivors just acted like Sonic the Hedgehog on crack. 
---
You must consider the person playing killer is good when making tier lists. If you do not do that killers like nurse don’t belong at S rank. Due to this tracking is not very relevant. 
---
Spirits mind games are a complete 50/50 guess in best case scenarios as survivor. They are hardly predictable when they are almost entirely chance for the survivor. 
---
She has quite high map control actually. The only killers with better map control are nurse, hag and billy. When her map control is fourth best in the game can you really say it’s only slightly above average? 
---
Chase potential does make up for lacking in other areas, depending on how their chase potential works. Look at nurse for example. Her map control isn’t truly as good as most say, I feel even I overestimate it often times, she however has godlike chase potential to make up for her poor tracking, “stealth,” mediocre mindgames and her somewhat above average map control. Her map control is only decent because of her chase potential. She can be on multiple survivors at the same time, something no killer other than her can do.
---
She is way better than clown. He has zero map control and above average chase potential. She curbstomps clown in every way imaginable. 
---
Thankfully some people are sensible.
---
I like your perk idea. 
---
DON'T PUT THAT PICTURE IN MY HEAD 😱
---
No but im talking about the average noed player who normally are the worst players
---
Yeah, I'm not having that kind of cake.
---
Ans what about the other 10 matches you played? Oh yeah i forgot you killers only remember the bad matches. Never the good ones
---
Just 2-3 days left hopefully...
---
We will know 2pm eastern monday 😁 
---
u/gifreversingbot
---
That is honestly pretty damn good. Most posts I see about perk changes either want to destroy it or make it so strong it’s stupid. 
---
You can't report someone for toxicity. If they use an exploit or whatever you sadly need video footage or the report does nothing. The only kind of reporting that works is if you report them for using the N or F words in the chat.

---
Now do it for survivor. *Evil laugh
---
That has nothing to do with this post lol.. Dying Light still essentially ruins one survivor’s experience with how most people use it. It just needs to be looked at as a perk in general.
---
That doesn't fix the tunneling.
---
I mean..either way they are rewokring the perk to get rid of that. 
---
It’s not your job to save everyone but you should make the effort to save someone
---
Yeah have you ever tried to reach trough an open window? Its fucking impossible! You just hit a mysterious air wall.
---
(Sighs) What's with the downvoting?!
---
It's actually easier to down the unhooker if you are there when it happens, smack him before, smack him right after. What I hate is the auto aim  not allowing me to hit the unhooker when the unhooked still has I-frames.
---
Her map control is only that high because most other killers don't have much. Thus, she isnt good but rather less bad. Though huntress has better map control imo. Her mindgames are still predictable and you get a decent warning that shes attempting to. 
---
&gt;She curbstomps clown in every way imaginable. 
---
This is why I said shes a better clown. Similar purpose, better execution.
---
And what build would that be may I ask
---
Rush basement cyka blyat 
---
spend bloodpoints?
---
w h a t
---
It's one of my favorite maps. For killers, generators are pretty close to each other and it's really good for doctor and terror radius builds, and for survivors it literally has 4 100% safe pallets. Imagine 4 killer shack pallets 
---
Lmao stop
---
His killer ability utilizes the awesome power of the Foreigner Belt.
---
Oh thanks
---
i try to keep it to 950k
---
You killer mains will cry cry and bitch about ANYTHING. “Instaheals. DS. Self care”   All I’m saying is get the fuck off of my ass and find someone else you unskillful twat. 
---
Okay...
---
No one who actually plays killer is just like "omg actually I'm totally fine with my catch getting away for no fucking reason"
---
fuck off
---
What? 
---
Just stand on the hatch and come back in 20 minutes. 
---
They are inexperienced and complain about gen rushing or looping. Just like inexperienced survivors complain about tunneling or camping.
---
Freddy darn
---
excuse me why are Rin and Amanda so low
---
If he stands over you his a idiot that's a worse version of face camping do gens you win he de pips. 
---
A good start for ruin would make it so they dont spawn next to gens or out in the open with nothing blocking them they may as well be a fucking flare.
---
Sorry but no if the killer doesn't chase off the hook and leaves you alone for a minute or so and then finds you again that's not tunneling.
---
Well I'm not playing wraith and trapper at rank 1 so yer its a good chance i will be playing those killers clown as well (bar nurse i suck at nurse :( ) 
---
Imma need clown to be a tad bit higher
---
Mmm, it just sounds like you're salty and have nothing to add to the convo.
---
Look, if they want to waste a good perk slot to get off for a few seconds, let 'em. That means 1 less perk working against me.
---
Do people actually play games that they aren’t having fun playing? If I’m not having fun, I’m not gonna play. Some matches can be pretty awful, but the next one usually makes up for it. 
---
Well they're barn animals so its surprising they have any at all.
---
I'm also almost positive the implication is that Bubba is developmentally challenged in some way, further making his condition the product of manipulation and abuse.
---
Switch itself can handle things fine, albeit with lower resolutions and usually a capped 30 FPS. But BHVR havent done great, to say the least, with console optimization so the game coming out on worse hardware doesn't look promising.
---
They give you new ritual at 5
---
What do you main?
---
Imma still need clown to be a tad bit higher
---
Hey buddy, it looks like it's time to COOL DOWN.
---
I don't know who you think you're fighting for or against, but the facts remain, DS is fine. You have dribble and even then, why does it take so much time for you to down them again?
---
It's between red and pink, neither purely one or the other, and that's ok.
---
No
---
(King crimson ability is to delete time, aka hillbilly deleted your attempt at juke and ends up chainsawing you)
---
Happened to me against Doctor too.
---
It's actually disturbing how many people find him sympathetic.
---
lmao this is exactly how I know you're a fucking liar. Killer has way, way less room for error, so a perk that sets back the killer one chase is a big deal, especially if more than one person has it.
---
Fucking liars, I swear
---
You're welcome, enjoy your salt.
---
Well, this attitude about english kinda justifiable? I mean English considered as universal language, in a lot of countries people learn English in school as second language. In Russia in most schools there’s no other choice other than English. 
---
Idk tho why I’m getting downvotes.  I’m Russian, so I know what I’m talking about...
---
oh look the lying fuck face didn't have an actual answer. 
---
I cannot wait for you fucks to lose that perk
---
&gt; why does it take so much time for you to down them again?
---
again, evidence that you're lying fucking scum. It's literally impossible for it to be 5 seconds every time like your pathetic ass is acting.
---
Spencer's Last Breath
---
Да я на самом-то деле тоже предпочитаю русский ;D
---
Spies is a good perk now. A bit annoying but good
---
Theres definitely games that dip below 30. DOOM did a lot before its optimization update and still does sometimes after it. Hell BOTW does in docked mode funny enough
---
Do I even have it 
---
Hillbilly has 2 builds i like, gas gas gas doom engravings with death engravings and multi track drifting steering shoes &amp; thompson's moonshine but otherwise its all boring. I want to level my Michael but i wanna see the new killer first to see if its worth leveling.
---
It's the crow. The full name is Spies from the shadows
---
as a killer you could run blood warden to stop people from being able to borrowed time themselves to the exit gates at endgame.
---
Yes. Freddy's power doesn't help him in the least bit. It's detrimental to him
---
I decided to make my own because I don't agree with the rest
---
Sounds like Billy already knows the what's important 
---
Glad I could help in some way! :D
---
Yeah but Freddy can down people without entering a slow motion chase. The legions "deep wound" is just a small scratch that's easily gotten rid of
---
It’s very annoying even as a killer main
---
True it’s easier for me to win but what about the other players they are going to have a very hard time winning
---
There’s also been times where as soon as I’m about to hook someone they dc and every single player does it until I win the match because everyone dc because I was about to hook them
---
The game saved you from playing against legion... so it’s a win I guess.
---
&gt;You are gonna find survivors that are better than you, it’s just how it is.
---
But that’s not the issue, because swf doesn’t make you a better player, it’s just gives you a major advantage over the killer. 
---
People want a fair match, they don’t care whether they win or lose, it’s whether that win or loss feels justified that bothers people.
---
Not really,  one survivor can easily make a chase last 60-70 seconds generators only take 80 without hitting greats so that easily 3 gens by first down if they spawned by generators
---
I don't believe she has the capabilities to down people as fast as the killers in A tier. Yeah I know she can, but for her it requires setup
---
Can someone now make these into pins for me to purchase?
---
unrelated but happy cake day lmao
---
CYKA BLYAT D:&lt;
---
Hag one up, clown one down. Myers deserves his own tier between A and B
---
Remove yourself from the game, thanks.
---
I've gotten Preschool literally once in my entire time playing, then the rest of my team DCs :(
---
Freddy is easily looped because his power isn't useful in chase. Legion atleast has the certainty to down them. Freddy also has to literally wait to hit people. And coming out of the dream-state is too easy
---
I can do you one better: who are macros
---
Not really. With franks he can easily down you, and without franks he can leave you on your toes and only adds about 10 more seconds to a chase than franks does
---
What
---
They also didn't have DS, Deliverance, Borrowed Time, SWF.
---
Leatherface and legion are way worse than Freddy 
---
I know, right? Clown is way too high.
---
He can cut off loops by stopping fast vaults
---
And I meant he can make it hard to tell where you're at. 
---
Freddys power works against him. That's why he is f-tier and the worst killer
---
Thank you
---
Ok then
---
Many people think wraith is a lost cause so I’d understand if they wanted to run far far away but thanks for your advice 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-YpVhBaOuw
---
Freddys power works against him. That's all I have to say
---
Makes sense, and I understand 100%. It’s just frustrating getting told every other game that i deserve to die because I finished objectives too quickly lol. Appreciate the in depth response my dude! 
---
I would love to have these in a pack. Nice work!
---
I wish someone loved me the way all of you love Daddy Myers 😪
---
I’m Russian and most of the time in games I either don’t talk, or say “thanks/gg/&lt;3” etc. Frequently there are times when I want to ask something but I don’t know how to spell a lot of words and without phone I type veeeery slow. And there are a lot of people like me who just don’t talk because of those reasons.
---
Well I guess we could disagree all day but there’s no fun in that
---
You seem like someone who's interested in an actual debate instead of a flame war. What do you agree and disagree with? I'm interested in your opinion ^_^
---
Don’t moan about hatch stand offs. You want them to jump, back off or hit them. No survivor will jump with you up their ass. These posts are boring just hit them and get on with your life.
---
I don't even need to look at anything else. The fact that you're complaining about Freddy without any reasoning invalidates your comment.
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie 
---
As does legions. It literally makes his hits do nothing but cause a minor inconvenience which doesn't even have skill checks to get rid of
---
My guess is, they just announced the new Hunter in DeathGarden. They will easily have DbD there as well, just not sure in what capacity. 
---
Bottom and top are ok but the middles a bit wonky. 
---
I wanna download these as like
---
Custom icons for the game
---
But the anti-cheat picking that up as a file change scares me
---
Yeah all you loose is rank.
---
I agree with Spirit being too low, but Freddy's actually really good. If the Freddy isn't tunnelling, that opens him up to insane map knowledge and stall, which allows him to pressure survivors off of gens. Every time he sleeps someone, he gets a hit or a pallet drop. If he hits, they waste time waking up and then getting healed - but since waking up makes a noise, Freddy can just drop what he's doing to go sleep them again. If he gets a pallet drop, he starts creating deadzones, which allows him to start getting easy downs mid-to-late game. Then his slug comes into play, and Freddy's slug is extremely good, to say the least.
---
Yeah but don’t you get that warm feeling when someone replies a helpful comment?
---
So... I just played against an extremely good spirit  and she fucking rolled everyone. Could not get away from her at all and she was so good at mind gaming with her ability. I would argue putting her in nurse tier because of how good she can be played. My apologies for doubting her power but she is absolutely insane.
---
Pig should be higher tbh. Agree with billy and spirit, I’d say spirit is easily the best console killer with prayer beads.
---
Agreed. Both sides need more evidence.
---
12 is basically 13 in my book
---
Some days I wonder if I'm playing a video game or working in a salt mine XD
---
Without addons, sure to legion but LF is very heavily debatable. With addons he MIGHT be better than LF but legion stomps almost any killer with addons. 
---
big boi's too high lol
---
Why shadow born it’s not that good is it especially tier one? Also I barely use hex perks for obvious reasons 
---
Not toxic, but really dumb.
---
The love to tilt player more than anything, and it isn't really good for anyone to be out to be a dick head. 
---
Gotta take a step to get a mile, right?
---
It looks great!
---
r/unexpectedbillwurtz
---
I'll do you one better! Why is macros!
---
well for now its gonna have to do, youll unlock more stuff the more you play

Would be my main, forevermore. 
---
So is 17 actually 18 in your book? 
---
It’s still an insta down. Both Trapper and LF are M1 killer’s with a neat twist that can backfire bad.
---
Oh fuck. I sound like a rapist.
---
It's a css thing. Looks correct on desktop
---
I did not play dbd back then but I know of the horrors. Vacuum pallets, 40+pallets on each map, 2 pallets super close to each other, infinites on almost every single map, old brand new parts, insta flashlights, fast heals and exhaustion recovery even when sprinting. There's probably some more things I forgot but holy fuck, how did people even play killer back then? It was pretty much become a God nurse or shove a broom up your ass 
---
Understandable have a nice day

Just pallets and the stun from D strike
---
I love how even your mom just *knows* that Freddy is bad. Also, PRIME TIME BITCH isn’t too scary.
---
Aww damn thanks
---
I don't think so, I was only playing Bill to get a double daily, which I did thanks to you &lt;3
---
Myers is supposed to be he slowly comes out the shadows you've taken it away how could you?
---
hey for all you know i could be a woman! i mean im not
---
but you shouldnt just assume that just because im only sexually attracted to other men that im gay
---
it just means im very gay
---
And once you set up (which hardly takes any time at all) you can switch targets and get free hits like crazy for some terrifying damage. Also maybe swap Michael and clown, or like someone else said put him in some limbo tier between A and B

Naw just a mid life booty call that I’m attempting now lol. Besides I’m way to high to be having any kind of crisis, Well actually a lack of Funyuns and Strawberry Fruit Roll-ups are a very serious crisis affecting many stoners.
---
Ooooh, thanks!
---
I understand now lol
---
I haven't either :(
---
I am frustrated but I still have fun :D
---

---
Very accurate tier list... this is no add-ons right??
---
Ah ic 
---
So is French and Spainish... Even Russian itself is spoken widely. It's not really justifiable, especially if your gonna complain about them not knowing. 
---
I mean...I'd rather play the game than sit in one while watching a show if a killer is going to be a cunt. 
---
Ruin, trap that baby. Enduring+spirit fury, express yourself by obliterating pallets. Monitor and Abuse, ruin their saved sprint burst and get that first hit in. Just what works for me on trappy boy.
---
I think battleborn had the issue of competing with overwatch, poor advertisement strategy, and not really letting everyone know what the game is until it came out. Game had moba mechanics as a first person shooter which is fine but the time to kill was relatively wrong and doing things in that game did not feel good. 
---
Deathgarden suffers from very similar problems (advertisement, gameplay isnt fun/rewarding,) but has a chance if the devs put a full rework into it and maybe also make it free. Then the game has a chance at being fun and most people will try free games once.
---
As of right now, 1 million blood points gets you to around level 40. Now, most streamers I watch have so many shards, they can buy all the perks in the shrine and get another 800k, so most people can easily get to P1 on a new killer first day.
---
V I d e o s I d e w a y s w h a t a m e s s 
---
Is monitor that effective? I didn’t pick it up from the the shrine cause 8 meters doesn’t seem like much
---
Hag is good but not better than huntress! 
---
Yes
---
Have we gotten an explanation on why it's so loud?
---
Well, most of them were newbies when they started making DBD.. You see the reason why there's spaghetti all over the place? (No hate towards the devs tho!)
---
Premonition + spine chill are redundant. I prefer spine chill because it gives you an extra 2 or 3 seconds to skidaddle before the heartbeat begins.
---
Looking at your load outs overall, I would ask what is your primary strength/weakness? The builds seem to be scattered.
---
Thanks for the advice but ima go with another suggestion deceptive tap for kindred tanks though 😃
---
That's the problem with the community, you would just rather yell your opinion and what you think is best but you never want to try and get it known and seen by devs and BHVR
---
Old huntress was better than hag, back when insta hatchets were actually insta. She lost a decent bit of her viability when she lost tinkerer and her addons got changed. Not to say she’s bad at all, but she dropped a few tiers. Hag is above her but not by a ton. 
---
Survivors need to be sacrificed, not killed. I made the same mistake with Myers lol.
---
That makes nurse even more fun to play, not
---
👌(6
---

---
I find it infinitely useful on most M1 killers, its almost a must have for Myers. Don't underestimate the value of Monitor and Abuse, a lot of people hide as soon as they hear your terror radius. With M&amp;A you'll usually catch them off guard before they get to their hiding spot. Pairing it with Nurses Calling works really well also as most killer terror radius is larger than the aura range of Nurses Calling. 
---
Same situation happened to me today. I unhooked one person who got hooked by NOED and then busted ass to the exit, but she didn't follow me. She ran to the other guy on hook, got that guy off and they both got away. Major respect.
---
...So your team kept the killer running around, and you're acting like you're some kind of pro, because you were able to knock out 3 gens in 4 and a half minutes, completely unopposed?
---
I don't understand what goes through their heads, people like this. "man, another gen done and I haven't even seen the killer! I must be REALLY GOOD at stealth!"
---
Why waste rendering power for something that is going to be only seen for 3-4 seconds.
---
Why waste money in drawing an area that is going to be only seen for 3-4 seconds.
---
Why waste time in coding an area that is going to be only seen for 3-4 seconds.
---
Why have potential areas that have potential to have bugs when you can just leave them void and not have errors.
---
Would you pay more for the game if there was rendered areas you mentioned?
---
Why would you needlessly make it resource heavy to reach a lesser portion of the audience?
---
You're only looking at it from a consumer's point of view. Look at things in a developer's point of view.
---
Have to get a Merciless Killer, lots of hooks, no moris can be done still if one person DCs.
---
What's the last one?
---
Wait a minute, there are five survivors now?
---
**Purpose:**
---
Based on what I have seen and played NOED is meant to be a late game perk, a bit of a bandaid so to speak to the, I don’t want to say problem, but the dynamic that once the generators are done killer loses a lot of power( the problem with this is a topic for another time). Survivors on the same half of the map as an open gate tend to be safe due to the time it takes to down people with killers without instant downs, and usually the time you spend chasing is enough for another person to get the gate open for your first target. NOED was a way to help with this, giving the killer the power to one shot a person so regardless of how close of far you are to the gates, your still in danger until a few centimetres before the exit. 
---
The problem with NOED is that it’s a Good idea, with a bad execution. The idea of a perk that makes killer still a threat in the late game is good, especially with weaker killers have issues  with the gens getting done, such as Trapper, who has to invest time into traps setup for what is inconsistent results, or killer like Wraith or Freddy who simply lack power to end chases fast. 
---
The problem is that Exposed is not the best way to do it, dying in one hit to a killer can be frustrating, especially in situations where the killer is clearly unskilled or weaker and is being used not because the killer has control issues but because the killer is simply bad and is using it as a crutch. IE cases where something like a Billy is getting beaten in chases but still manages a 2K because Noed let them get two easy hits, despite the fact the entire match they didn’t hook someone and or wasted their time on one chase, or a similar case where a Nurse who can’t track gets kills because Noed is used as a crutch. So because of this NOED Exposed is uninteractive and too easy for strong killers to exploit as a crutch due to lack of skill.
---
So my rework planned to do as follows.
---
1.Keep the Late game post generator completed pressure and purpose to the perk
---
2.Allow it to have places the Perk can be tweaked if it ends up too weak or 2 strong
---
3.Allow it to be less exploited by unskilled killers as a crutch
---
4.Make it more interactive for survivors, allowing them a chance to respond to the perk without it being a death sentence while by extension still letting killer use it
---
With that in Mind I decided to rework NOED by introducing a Blood Warden effect as a New Status effect called Confined, it functions the same as bloodwarden in regards to blocking the gates but is a Status effect that NOED applies once hitting the person. This changes how NOED works, instead of being a one hit down it now functions like a reverse borrowed time, once your hit the counter starts and the chase is on, can the Survivors dodge,loop and generally avoid the killer for long enough for the timer to elapse and for them to escape, or will the killer down them before that time. It still has issues of course but at least there will be some form of a chase, meaning the survivor has some control in the situations. This also means its harder to use as a crutch, if the survivors are more skilled then you then they will have a pretty good chance of avoiding the second hit before the confined durations burns through, and it also encourages survivors to try end games rescues, as NOED is not a complete death sentence for them and can either give them the chance they need, or be a perfect bait for the killer to rack in more killer.
---
Finally with this confined effect it means that sitting at the exit gates will be quite a bit more dangerous, none of this sitting on the edge and crawling out as the killer weapon wipes, no, if your hit, your trapped, no if or buts about it.
---
As part of the introduction of Confined effect, Blood warden would also change its text and use confined for its gate blocking aswell, this is more just a consolidation thing, in the same way BT now uses Deep wounds.
---
A lot of things to complain w/ the in-game gameplay. This ain’t it tho. :x 
---
Pretty sure everyone would be irritated if they decided to do something like that when there are legit things that need fixing and haven’t been addressed. 
---
This is great, hahhaah. Good job.
---
Haha right? She was the last adept I got lol. 
---
Medium Vault: that's where you're wrong kiddo
---
Do you make these just for fun? Or would u make one for commission? These are epic. Lmk. 🤔
---
3 dead already. Is the last one that necessary?
---
Urban Evasion, Sprint Burst, Self care, and Adrenaline are the most common meta perks I run into and works well in most scenarios.
---
Jesus no one is playing this deathgarden at the moment. 
---
So great to see u/SrGrafo leaking into DBD xD
---
I'm no expert on the game, but I feel like the core concepts of your idea are pretty good! 
---
I think the numbers might need some tweaks. 
---
 Not being able to see hooks while also having a noticeable decrease in carry time might be a tad too strong if numbers are too high. 
---
I say this because if the numbers impact too strongly iron grasp will essentially become a required perk, which dilutes build variety. 
---
I like it
---
Why does every Pig do this? Stop...
---
Myers. He's an amazing killer. So much fun to play. 
---
[removed]
---
Ok and now someone add spirit’s cackle pls 
---
So generally speaking I don't feel NOED is in a particularly bad spot for either side. 
---
But I'm not going to lie, the overall concept of confined is actually really interesting!
---
I do have one question, would the confined effect persist for the duration even if the totem is destroyed?
---
If not I feel it's a bit too weak as survivors could easily remove it during that time period, and it would effectively be much weaker overall imo. 
---
With enough power to thanos snap feng away
---
No skill. No counter-play. No fun.
---
Just about any word can mean something sexual, though
---
Yeah I guess stretched out smiles are hard not to like. Some just feel people who stare at you without blinking are aggro. 
---
dont worry about dying, you're gonna die a lot
---
Watch streamers like Noob3, ZubatLEL and Scott Jund. Also search up proper tile, pallet loop and jungle gym techniques on YouTube.
---
majority of the russian community is toxic lol, especially csgo
---
As I've stated...most Clowns are underwhelming to play against. 
---
I’d second that, dead hard is the difference between being stuck in the basement and escaping an impossible situation.
---
If this wasn't a hex perk it would be cool. 
---
NOED used to be on a timer and all the survivors did was just hide to wait it out. It's in a perfectly fine place right now and doesn't need to be changed.
---
The first survivor to have voice lines
---
Both can be very useful. 
---
Alert is helpful when your working on a gen because once the killer is revealed, you generally have just enough time to see the direction they're heading, giving you early potential warning of an investigation.
---
I feel dark sense is also good, but for different reasons. Once you complete your gen or once they're all done, dark sense can effectively stop you from accidentally running into the killer while trying to leave the area. 
---
Being able to see a killer coming towards the gen you fixed, and knowing the direction can make a huge difference in terms of figuring out the ideal place/angel to hide.
---
Was blowing through all my offerings trying to p3 tapp today and ran spine chill, resilience, botany and sc. Brought a tool box with socket swivels and instructions. That worked pretty well, considering it's a waste of time to heal. 
---
It might be time to change up perks to counter how killers play at that level. What are you running now? Are you usually just getting caught at the beginning? Sometimes you have to change your play style, too. 
---
It would be better if that perk activates when any survivor complete a gen and not specifically you.
---
another aspect that could bet tweaked, i kept in mind the fact that it could be changed and removed as a Hex perk when i made it, but for the sake of giving balance options i retained the Hex status, gives too directions to go balance wise, making the effect stronger (longer duration, more people effected) or dropping the Hex status.
---
I feel both. I have fun sometimes, but frustrated most times. I swing between them, which I'm sure is not healthy.
---
I run spinechill, lightweight, empathy, self care 
---
This. Plus, people don't want to look at the other side of the coin: doesn't NOED only proc on bad survivors who either are too lazy to cleanse totems or just simply can't find them all? 
---
Safe hook rescues are bugged right now, even unsafe hooks give the +500 now.
---
Fight me, mate.
---
&gt;another aspect that could bet tweaked, i kept in mind the fact that it could be changed and removed as a Hex perk when i made it, but for the sake of giving balance options i retained the Hex status, gives two directions to go balance wise, making the effect stronger (longer duration, more people effected) or dropping the Hex status.
---
Hex perks are shit because of how easy they are to counter play and makes sense that their effect are proportionally strong. 
---
Your suggestion doesn't feel strong enough worth of a hex perk.
---
As he opens the exit gate “frickin come on” 
---
Btw the Clown is actually 115% movement speed even while charging his bottles. They changed this since the ptb he had. 
---
That's why I main him 😭 so I can hear that sexy breathing all the time
---
The problem is that in most games people can’t be coordinated enough to find and destroy each totem efficiently. This leads to an extremely long seek/destroy “mission” that can lead to nothing happening if the killer doesn’t even run NOED. 
---
Everyone has a main, and with console, some Killers are better to play than others. 
---
I had to change my controls so I don’t accidentally throw down pallets or vault things.
---
I dont even play David, but this was me the day the update came out.
---
That's literally part of the risk inherent in this game. You're not meant to know what the killer is running, thus have to guess if you should do certain things each match (BBQ, Discordance, NOED, etc. etc.). This game is supposed to be full of risks and decisions like that.
---
K then.
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
I agree. Killer when getting trollwd still has a 15 min game at least. Suvivor 3 mins. 1 min if you have myers and DS. You get one hit killed.
---
What about when he fucks up a gen
---
It’s noticeable but non consequential. Only time is near doors but even then it’s just a, “holy fuck let me through,” moment.
---
Tunnel shark a savage
---
To make the game short as possible abd get the least points. Cool
---
Nah we are talking  about the fakey you killers do where you pretend to walk away and come right back. To hook smash!
---
Friggin crap for when he fucks up and friggin awesome for when he hits a great skill check. When he hits a regular one he says “alright” as monotone and unenthusiastic as possible. 
---
Make the game go longer. Duh!
---
What was the last one?
---
Learn the landmarks of each specific map to get a better understanding where pallets are going to likely spawn. 
---
Congratulations! Hope you enjoyed your grind :D
---
First off: might I suggest making a shorter list of just the killers in your particular order. A TL;DR of sorts.
---
Also, I personally don't place a lot of faith in many of the lists I see online, just because of the fact that just because it is ranked "S" tier, doesn't mean you're gauranteed a 4k. Also, some killers (primarily Nurse) are better on PC than console.
---
I agree with Freddy being up there, due to how little he's played. You don't see him very often, meaning you don't really know how to counter him (this varies, obviously).
---
I wish Trapper was more up there because he completely destroys, if you play him right. I once got a 4k vs a SWF because a trapped the shack, hooked one person in the basement, and downed the other three that went to save him. Also, if you have certain add-ons it makes him better on maps that are usually bad for him.
---
A layer of fat with extreme muscle underneath, too thicc.
---
Tier 1: wig... off
---
Well if that's the case then you got baited and fell into my trap! Hehe..
---
I actually do this if I feel like the survivors are going to be super altruistic. Lotta wasted time if it doesn't end up working tho :'(
---
It's sad when concert speakers hurt my ears even when I'm far away
---
Trapper should be on there too - the addons which darken the trap are only visible to the trapper, it has no effect on the survivors lmao
---
Am I the only one that actually looked on Twitter to see if there were actually dbd parody accounts?
---
Uhh.. ok. Haven’t seen that before 
---
How **DARE** she labels my boy billy as "scary". He is handsome and delightful.
---
Hey look, it took about ten minutes for someone to say it's my fault!
---
If you'd read my argument, you would've noticed that the Clown argument isn't my argument. It's from a Clown main. I don't play Clown.
---
Furthermore, Clown is slowed. If he's not meant to be slowed, then it's a bug, because I have seen recent footage of him holding his bottle and being slowed because of it. Unless it was fixed within like last week.
---
That's not what I've seen. He's probably bugged again lol
---
Man did everyone seriously just blow past “They’re doing a pretty good job so far”. No way this was a coincidence and no way you’ve been playing a few months when you know this gem. I’m on to you ;)
---
I meant it more as a joke but yeah that’s on me. You really don’t use Clown’s bottles for holding, I use them with a single tap so if he is slowed I don’t notice it. He’s certainly not good but he shouldn’t be *the* worst.
---
Yoinked
---
1. There was supposed to be an image attached to this post, but apparently Reddit doesn't let you do that. I'll attach a TL;DR to the bottom.
---
2. This list is meant for PC. And no, you're not guaranteed a 4k with Nurse, nor are you guaranteed a 0k with Clown. I agree ^_^
---
3. Wow, really? Nice! Someone actually agrees!
---
4. Again, that's because you're a good killer - at least, better at killer than the survivors were at survivor - not because Trapper is good. That's why I try not to bring personal experience into debates. It's not generally reliable. He's way too easily abused (disarming traps, bugged hitboxes, etc).
---
5. Something like that, yeah! The idea of Legion's power applying debuffs was suggested by No Mither, No Problem. At least, that's where I heard it from.
---
Thanks for the constructive points! ^_^
---
i'm too afraid too say anything in case of a woosh
---
Just remove the speed boost from NOED 
---
open handed is only meant to change survivor aura reading abilities not killer no aura abilities
---
No. I’ll collide with the survivor whilst sprinting for ex and go through the swing animation only for the survivor to come out unscathed. Admittedly it’s not a very common occurrence but it’s a very irritating one none the less
---
Fight me. Dwight is a better killer than Clown.
---
I am one of many dudes who argued with Tyde. I am also one of the many dudes who didn't get an answer from Tyde :P
---
Coming soon 
---
Anti cheat won't pick it up because these are loose files. I'm currently recording game play and such with them on to prove that it won't trigger anything :)
---
Wholesome leather face :,)
---
I did do that. Teir 1 looks almost invisible in the icon box because you're not supposed to be seen on Teir 1. 
---
This is in general how publishers/distributors/investors work vs the actual devs :c
---
Jesus you could have warned me.. MY EARS!!!!
---
This is literally the only skin item I've bought, I just wanted shirtless David, and if shirtless Myers ever comes out....
---
Ah, okay. Sarcasm is hard over the internet! :P
---
The bottle barely goes anywhere if you just tap M2. You probably would get a hit without even bothering in that case.
---
Wow, you agree Clown isn't good! Nice! My experience of Reddit is already better than most people I know. If he's not the worst, though, who's worse than him?
---
I think you guys are getting confused...its not just about killing the survivor quickly. Its about making the match long enough so wvweyone ranks up and has a fun game. If your a salty killer who just smashes unhookers for no reason than cause they are just there. Is not a good enough excuse for your low points at the end of the match. GET MORE POINTS ANS HAVE FUN!
---
Its about bloodpoints. Not how fast you can piss someone off. And if thats what you do. Then thats the issue. And this will never change.
---
I find him annoying as hell to deal with because I can't position myself to make a good escape in time if I heard a heartbeat. When i hear his lullaby he could be coming from anywhere and I cant judge from where. In my opinion,stealth killers are just a nuisance to deal with
---
Personally for the bottom I would put Trapper, Clown, LF. Clown and LF being the same power level. I have a small bias with Trapper because he’s my main but I just don’t like LF and from my own experience I’ve done better with Clown.
---
I’ve seen it happen 3-4x and experienced it myself. Was it the Hag?
---
&gt; but he needs charge addons to use his power in a chase
---
He doesn't, you're just not playing him right. 
---
I believe it's an alternate icon, I thought it was only shown when you're actually IN teir three using the ability but because I don't own Meyers the person I had test told me the fourth is unused but will most likely replace the regular teir 3
---
Real question, not trying to bash, but aren't all of those guys people who de-rank to play vs green rank killers for easy matches? 
---
What else encourages killers not to tunnel?
---
Who the fuck runs third seal.  ^^^i ^^^do
---
I see your reasoning but Adrenaline makes way more sense for Quentin both in that he already has an endgame perk for synergy and he literally uses it in the film to wake Nancy up because nothing else is working.
---
I wholeheartedly despise this idea. 
---
They're all kinda equally trash, lol. I might end up putting them in the same tier and having Legion by his own. But for heaven's sake, why is Trapper able to step in his own traps?! Imagine if Hag could set her phantasms off!
---
I was thinking about doing it depending on how much people want it 
---
I had to switch the struggle space bar to mouse wheel because my space wouldnt register as struggle at times and I'd just die. Hasnt happened since I did the change
---
It hurts cause it’s true. I feel like the game was balanced around Trapper with no intention of adding other killers. Several perks directly counter his traps but stepping in your own traps has to be the funniest thing ever. Trapper is the only horror movie feeling killer. 
---
Up you go
---
I don't really play Billy, and for that reason I try and keep personal experience out of my reasoning because it can vary based on the survivors one is against. From what I have seen, against survivors who know what they're doing, Billy cannot chainsaw at a large amount of loops.
---
Even if he could (and maybe I can, I just don't see it happening at pallets) it wouldn't really change his ranking. He's still a super powerful killer.
---
no pig hear oink oink just me a friendly survivor i just want to make sure its safe oink
---
The Bee.
---
You need everyone to die in any way, though moris have issues. More than 2 moris seems to bug and not count, but 1 or 2 seems to be ok.
---
*Nea’s 100% heal intensifies*
---
&lt;3
---
Yeah, I get why people put Trapper mostly B tier and below. With certain add-ons, he can become godlike (assuming, of course, you aren't a total dumbass), but if you take add-ons out of the equation, you can see the raw usefulness of each killer.
---
The code for dbd is such a rat's nest I wouldn't be surprised if the devs had no idea what's causing it
---
*notices your edit* OwO wats dis?
---
Answer: Freddy isn't really above either of them, he's on par. Read my reasoning, please.
---
*MORIS CLAUDETTE IT'S R E D!
---
What if the killer is a camper though? When someone is camped, are you doing totems or following the “Just do gens” advice that 99% of people say to people who complain about campers? 
---
If we're lucky
---
50% kids 50% kids and Ochido fans 
---
Considering that they are non-existent, I’d recommend
---
You're right no one should do gens in protest.
---
Maybe, don't play with the volume maxed? If I did that it would literally make me deaf.
---
He go FAST
---
I mean, they could be running her now because they're getting ds as a teachable to actually use it after the changes.... I've never gotten it or used it outside of the adept trophy on ps4 but I actually want it now to prevent tunneling.
---
Do not run perks that only work in the end game (adrenaline, hope, etc) if you find you're not making it that far. I'd suggest urban evasion and iron will. You can crouch most of the game and it's easier to hide. Iron will will keep you quiet if you get hit and you can lose the killer. 
---
What a great teammate. I wish everyone else was as amazing as this lad. :D
---
When you sacrifice your life to save 3 others and they don’t even attempt to get you off the hook.
---
A nurse can even blink through an unopened gate. Wait for survivors to open it and jump on them with her NOED. This happened to me once,I knew she was out there because I had Dark Sense,not sure if it was a bug that was fixed or not tho
---
Like it fucking hurts my ears every time. -.-
---
Oh please, [this again](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9p2gc4/us_generators_we_gotta_stick_together_if_we_wanna/)? It first happened well over 4 months ago; but it was supposed to have been fixed IIRC. 
---
Thanks for bringing this to attention OP, you should also [submit a bug complaint to BHVR](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/bug-reports) so they can fix it.
---
I don't think anyone would want to face a 3-gen Doc or Trapper guarding these two gens. :p
---
It's actually entirely made from pitch shifted Kate screams
---
Depends on the headset, some can go louder than others. The max volume on my headset is actually pretty low.
---
I know, right? Gotta love dbd's player base :)

Felt like boo-boo the fool when I tried to trick a killer into thinking I was going for a window only to look behind me after I did it to see that he didn't see it because a wall blocked his sight. 
---
When Billy catches Bubba cross-dressing with his chainsaw
---
It's sad, money makes the world go round, and corrupts everything it touches, even if it's only a little. I've seen great games with potential stop development because no one was buying it and the dev was only one or two dudes.
---
You must be really slow.
---
I want David to choke me.

wow this is worthless

He's also got his deceptive lunge, short height, and wonky terror radius with wall hacks going for him.

His face fucking shows how we all feel

i havent played in a while, mind explaning?
---
“spangbab”?😂
---
Honestly, I'm ok with Nurse being overpowered in the right hands. If you put in the time to learn her, then you should be rewarded. It's also the case that Nurse's number one counter is fear, and a lot of times survivors never fear the killer knowing all the basic looping strategies and the like. These cocky fearless survivors are easy prey for Nurse, and I suspect she was designed (then redesigned) with this exact purpose in mind, and she does it perfectly.
---
The Legion's special power is having the zoomies like a cat at 3am
---
You do realise back-face culling makes the game run better right? Why would you make your client render something you are never supposed to see.
---
Oh i saved someone from the basement but the killer is at the top of the stairs so there is no counter play 
---
If I ever deal with Russians in-game, I just say "cyka blyat" and "America #1" over and over and over again
---
1. It shouldn't be nearly as easy as it is to wake up, especially since it takes a long time for Freddy to put someone to sleep *and* again, there's nothing stopping survivors from doing stuff during the dream transition. 
---
2. I've both had it happen to me and watched it happen to others during their Freddy games where the Freddy does what he's supposed to do and sleeps everyone, then decides to chase one and the others are all awake in less than twenty seconds. Freddy has to commit to a chase at some point. 
---
3. I don't have anything more to say on this point. 
---
4. Freddy really can't camp, because, once again, survivors can do stuff during the dream transition (including unhooks). This especially screws him over during late game unless everyone else is asleep (and really, how often does *that* happen?).
---
5. Then it's a bug that should've long since been fixed, bug or Freddy's power or whatever it is. It's still a problem. 
---
6. I don't have anything more to add to this. 
---
7. Then you'd have to be either damn lucky, get survivors that are potatoes, or are damn good at Freddy to slug all four survivors at the same time. Freddy should not have an issue with a basic mechanic of the game (hooks and hooking). 
---
8. Any other killer can at least slap the other survivor away. Freddy literally can't do anything in that scenario. 
---
9. Then that requires him to slug the last survivor and go look for the fourth, and we all know how much survivors just *love* that. /s
---
10. You clearly don't know how Distortion works. Yes, it does block Freddy's aura reading *and* has no scratch marks (so it's effectively broken against Freddy for those 30 seconds it does work, wasting his time, and if the survivor wakes up before the 30 seconds are over Freddy got exactly nothing out of putting that survivor to sleep). Lockers shouldn't block his aura reading either, there is literally no reason that it does other than to screw Freddy over some more. 
---
11. I don't have anything else to add to this. 
---
12. I would just "memorize the timing" if there was, again, any in-game indication of when Freddy was flickering. There seems to be one in KYF, but I have yet to figure out if this is merely a bug or a feature that just doesn't work in ranked mode for some reason. Considering how much love the devs have given Freddy over the past year, I wouldn't put it past them to just ignore an entire element of Freddy's power that hasn't been working all this time. 
---
Must be a PC thing, never stumbled upon a moonwalking Legion on PS4 and I myself barely use frenzy, usually just to fast travel between gens.
---
DC's aren't always player enabled. I was playing as survivor once, got another player off a hook, everything looking good, then my game just shit itself. And each and every game with party streamers or cake seems to be a connection death sentence. 
---
Why should I be punished for the game not working right?
---
Yup,I’m pretty sure that been confirmed
---
What a sweet little baby... Must resist...urge to...touch the tummy...

I live here so let's just say that sometimes it is not a pleasant experience. Like, not at all. 
---
Wrong about Billy.  The difference between Doom Engraving Billy and Regular Speed Billy is that the first one makes the survivors drop their entire butt.
---
Yeah, I said killer is simple to understand, hurt people, break other things (pallets and gens). The second clause was talking about pulling an ancient person and sticking them in modern time and expecting them to not freak out about the other survivors, the settings, or the generators and gates themselves.

Anyone notice high ping and lag in every single match today?
---
lmfao I saw this comment and went to look and its so FUCKING FUNNY how accurate this is
---
that's true, however I meant to specify that it's not even the physical gate part, but the entity spikes that come up at the exact point of escape. you can drop past that and they can roam about the out side of the map freely. Do it to the wrong person and your game is held hostage lol
---
Most logical choice but also incredibly boring. Like a boxing match that ends on the first round, or Frodo using the eagles to drop the ring into the lava.

what IS that thing
---
his tummy is like a bear trap sometimes actually! 
---
Well, legion's pretty bad, wraith and him are sort of swappable, and LF and Trapper suck.
---
Oh, I know it's not hard if you try, I just got the impression they wanted to discourage it.  I *think* they mentioned it in a stream quite a ways back, but my memory is unreliable.

---
None a this matta’s
---
Let’s just admit it we all use maps to gain bp😂
---
I think they should rework noed by getting rid of exposing survivors when the gates are powered and getting rid of the hex, what it should do instead is activate when the hatch is opened, and it exposes all survivors left alive and makes them moriable, the hatch will be blocked and highlighted for 60 seconds when it opens, make it an anti hatch perk, would be cool
---
You need the volume to be loud,  as is safely tolerable, in order to track killers/survivors.
---
Jeff breathing.
---
Freddy should be lower. Imo he's not above spirit. You could make an argument for Michael but not spirit at least.
---
You should add an S+ tier imo. Putting killers in B tier makes them seem too average when you have huntress, Michael, or Fedora man there.
---
Clown is at least above LF and Trapper, maybe legion. His bottles can be used effectively enough and his power can be negated nearly as bad as LF or Trapper.
---
Solid recommended channels/streams too. 
---
Side note: Are you in the tutorial entity discord? 
---
Now, I only play survivor, and I don't do that. I'm like "this bitch is open, my ass is gone."

"you aren't appreciating life enough, time to be kidnapped and put into a torture puzzle!" what is he trying to achieve, he's not "helping" them by giving them ptsd or killing them. having to cut off one of my limbs and become disabled isn't going to make me enjoy life more.
---
Everyone hates gen rushing. I'm a rank 1 survivor and know plenty of other survivors that hate it. Short games blow as no one makes any decent points. Survivors just have their gen points and maybe some co-op bonuses from doing the gens together and the killer gets possibly nothing. No one wants that shit, I think most of us want to see fair games that involve hooks, chases, and rescues as well as gens popping but as long as it's fun for both sides. Gen rushing survivors make no sense to me, it's like, uhh, enjoy your 10k point?
---
I think you’ve hit the nail on the head. In all communities, not just the DBD community, people that enjoy acting toxic and whatnot don’t get the satisfaction purely from the action, but the reactions they seek to elicit.
---
It’s a tired cliche that I sort of hate hearing, but the best way to deal with them is really to kill them with kindness. In the end, acting like they didn’t even affect you in the slightest is probably the best way to get back at them 
---
Excuse me? I've been playing since launch and tunneling and camping are bullshit trash tactics by bad killers. 
---
I commit myself to the idea that every game will be horrible. That way I'm always delightfully surprised when things actually go my way.
---
I guess they also enjoy making like 10k points too. That's about it, maybe even less, if they just do gens and escape. No chases, no unhooks, etc. I play more survivor than killer and am baffled at the idiots that gen rush. I get it if the killer is a camping/tunneling twat but otherwise I don't see why any group would gen rush and leave. 
---
spies from the shadows are the same as normal crows? I don't understand
---
nea main big brain
---
you'd also think after his horrific success rate he'd have a rethink.
---
The Huntress has such easy hotboxes now anyone can use her and look good. I used to never fear her myself until they changed her hitboxes and now with that change plus latency they just have to throw in your general direction and you're getting hit no matter what. 
---
thats fucking red I dont care what anyone says that is obviously red
---
Normal crows are just sitting there or flying around and spies from the shadows is an aura
---
&gt; There were people in the discord server you invited me to saying that. What do you mean no one has said that?
---
No they didnt lmao
---
&gt; Hags map control is heavily dependant on survivors not paying attention/being careless.
---
Again, not at all. Its extremely hard to see the traps, and even harder to avoid them if the Hag is smart.
---
&gt;  Spirit has very good map control, not quite as good as Billy’s but nearly as formidable.
---
Eh, sort of agree on that. Just depends on the addons tbh.
---
&gt;  So spirits chase potential is better than Billy’s at high ranks, I really doubt anyone would argue against, meaning it’s 1/1 for the two. 
---
His map pressure and insta down more than makes up for Spirits edge in chase potential imo
---
&gt; or amazing chase potential with above average map control. Take your pick.
---
I wouldnt call it amazing tbh, I'd call it good. She can be outplayed, but most survivors just play against her wrong (much like clown)
---
Thats not true mate I'm sorry
---
Exactly. They get very little points from it. What do they get from it, unless they're just spiteful and looking to make the game hell for a complete stranger?
---
Freddy’s hidden passive is he’s bottom tier regardless of what the tiers are for
---
I linked her spotlight trailer to somebody else's reply if you want to see true overpoweredness
---
If all you have to say is "that's not true", then you're wrong. Everything I wrote there is true. Besides, you can't say that my own experiences aren't true "mate", lmfao.
---
"why waste rendering power" but it won't be rendered if its not in line of sight?? unless im really overestimating the optimization of dbd...
---
Cringe af
---
Weird.
---
If you didn't know already, you don't have to "mash" it as fast as you think. You can press it every half a second or a little faster and still struggle. 
---
I play this, Civilization VI if I feel like not interacting with anyone and sink the time, or PUBG if I want some competetive experience. 
---
Yeah, you can’t put kiddie fiddler with....wait a minute 
---
Really 😓 I thought it was cool
---
Who??
---
I mean this would happen without swf, if you are playing a killer with no map pressure to try and defend totems it wont work, the tea will just pressure and cleanse the totems
---
It's more of a dig at BHVR.  There are plenty of great looking games on the Switch.  It's resolution is honestly fine.  1080p on TVs and 720p portable.
---
It is. 
---
They do, without Franklins Mixtape or cheap tactics, they do mediocre without SB or Thanatophobia. If a survivor is injured they are just a 110% killer, the FF is bad and just adds more time on the chase. The power is a mess. 
---
Lmao

Whooooshhh

Am I the only one who had a giggle at this?
---
LMAO Freddy, I will actually give you a thumbs up I like your mom opinion lol 
---
Thanks man! 
---
😏
---
It was easy peasy.
---
I just imagined you shaking your head in a sarcastic manner with the “oh you” and then cue laugh track. 
---
I don’t know who the killer will be, nor the power, but here’s my theory..
---
The devs said this killer will be the oldest yet, by a long shot. The oldest killer is from WWI. Judging by the look of the killers arm, it seems he (yes, he, because this killer will be a male) is from the plague era (1340s). He has discoloration in his arms, a gray/black color, which reminds me of plague victims. The (What looks like?) burn marks, which would also fit the chapter title “Demise of the Faithful.” Fire was considered a form of cleansing in those times, around that era. Maybe I’m wrong. We shall see. 
---
Play swf. Generally rank 1 killers just sweat with billy and nurse and usually even swf vs a pro billy and nurse it’ll be exactly the same lol.
---
I feel like that’s a bad idea. Whilst I agree it would be useful for killers like yourself, it has major exploit potential.
---
I main survivor, and even if I avoid chases and altruistic plays, if I saw a player on death hook being chased I’d probably try to take the chase away from them so I end up being hooked instead, that way, we’re not a man down.
---
As for killers, it makes it incredibly easy to see who’s the easiest survivor to kill, if someone’s been hooked twice, and someone else hasn’t been hooked at all, who are you going to go after (if you’re playing for killers?).
---
So whilst the idea is great for players like you, I believe it would be a bad one as a whole as it’d make it far more tempting to be toxic as both a survivor and a killer as tunnelling would be significantly easier and so would BMing to get the chase off another survivor.
---
Why not make it like ... 
---
once the last gen Is complete. Every survivor is put in the injured state. This perk happens before any other last gen perks activate, and delays healing/perks that would activate at this time for 20 seconds. 
---
 I dunno.   Still make you a threat to down people but give them a chance to heal and slow down opening the gates . Stops adrenaline for a time if in chase with survivor  with it .
---
You have to be altruist at a point, at least one of you. Either way you will lose the game.
---
I don't understand your point. If you are injured without selfcare, you need to find someone to heal you. Which is harder when you are solo.
---
Yes you can do that, still, if you could shlut at your teammate where the totem is the game will end faster.
---
SWF is really superior even if all surv are playing optimaly.
---
Big salt. You suck at this game. Case closed.
---
Ok why do you consider A tier? What makes him a solid killer more than Spirit ? Pig ?
---
Basically every killer has a mori and is a nurse/billy or spirit with good addons. 
---
If i play with friends its not too bad but its just kinda boring, solo im lucky if 2 gens get done
---
Spirit is too add-on dependent. She's ok without but amazing with.
---
Pig is trying to do what Freddy does: stall, only she doesn't do it as effectively due to RNG. Her stealth is better but she has limited mindgames with her charge.
---
I am insulted by your mother's placement of the nurse. When I first began the game, I wanted to choose the scariest killer, and it was a tie between the wraith and the nurse!
---
:P
---
I'm kidding, of course. But nurse is my bae
---
Im going to get hated for this.
---
Its cool tat 10/10 but you got a tat of a dead game that is buggy and trash. I understand that you might like it but that game don't got anymore time. One day they are going to stop putting updates because they aren't getting their returns due to lack of players and you'll be stuck with a shit game and a permantly tat.
---
But it does look amazing and if you love the game then that's your decision 
---
What you are giving to me is the weaknesses of those killers.
---
What I want is to understand why do you consider Freddy a stronger killer.
---
Thats some viable information right there.
---
Godly tracking, a bit of stealth due to 24 meter terror radius, amazing game slow potential, and of course the mindgames.
---
I look forward to a pack :)
---
That's literally what I've done for every character except for Ace, whom I made the exception because his perks were trash and I didn't feel like farming through 50k a pop Bloodwebs Jesus Christ.
---
I'll waste my BP however I feel like thanks.
---
It's not dead it's still played by thousands daily... And I do love the game, it's saved me from suicide and I'm at 1300 hours now.

Just a Na’ vi from James Cameron’s Avatar
---
Wat
---
so far no ones been mori’d that ive seen, and they almost all run ruin but even if we get it off quickly or complete a gen or two in the beginning thats about as far as i ever see
---
what do i do if i dont have any friends to survive with? theyre all rank 20s and dragging them along w my rank 1 butt just makes things worse. and i dont have a mic so i cant befriend skilled randos :(
---
Honestly, I’d say you’re actually going about it the right way. If the perks are just god-awful unusable or boring, prestige game lets you clear about 7-8 levels for new perks to use besides the character exclusives, where at level 50 you’d receive 2 new perks for your points, assuming you’re using a modest 100k bloodpoints or so. 
---
My guess is having survivors trigger 100 hag traps. Triggered its called. Could also be even punishment. 
---
Every time I’ve played Legion, I have managed to 3k/4k because his power is good when used right. Freddy on the other hand is shit and definitely not better than Legion
---
If i made that shot id feel great. If i got hit by you id hate you for having such blind aim. 
---
the same but 10% the volume.
---
The simple answer would be that no one wants to play Freddy, cause he is considered bad. Cheap way to answer but it is true. You just have to take me for my word. I have 2K hours in the game 800 of which are only on Freddy. Back in April of 2018 I changed how I played Freddy. And ever since then I have had a lot more fun, doing better and most importantly, doing better consistently. Maybe I am just getting better at Freddy after so much practice. But what you're saying can also be said the other way around, how can you complains bout Freddy if you never played him effectively. As I see someone who doesn't know how to play Freddy effective would say something like "I need to wait 7 sec before I can hit them". The way I play the 7 sec doesn't even matter, hell I run add-ons that put it up to 9,5 sec and I have no problem. Freddy is not your standard killer, he has the same goal but he approaches it differently. Killer like Nurse and Hillbilly are very aggressive and killers like Hag or Trapper are defensive. Freddy is a bit of both, and during the game you constantly switch between these two. 
---
im fine with this but.   
---
1. it has to be self enacted. meaning. they hvae to leave the game via clicking. any other way wouldnt beable to be tracked reliably.   
---
2. against the legion its all fair game to dc. 
---
Yeah, you’re right about getting hatred for your comment. Something about how you take plenty of time shitting on the game and then wrapping up with a “you do you”.
---
I was willing to bet that the op had more reason for getting the tattoo other than just being a fan of the game on only a surface level. And wouldn’t you know it, they have a deeper reason for liking the game and meaning behind the tattoo. Weird.
---
Well if you divide a country I'd call it a hissy fit at least but agree to disagree.
---
Shaggy was born a high school graduate and doesn't need grammer. 
---
Numerous times. It's actually getting quite old.
---
People say “oh rank means nothing” but it influences the kinds of survivor teammates you get. Rank 9+ are just god-awful to me as far as teammates not knowing how to play the game and crouching around the map. 
---
I feel like it'd be a better fit for Small Game considering that is mainly focused on Totems anyway, seeing as we have only 2 trap using Killers.
---
Although a nice change for Detective's Hunch would be a longer timer than 5 seconds.
---
Brutal xD
---
Can you elaborate? 
---
Oh please. Me having a differing opinion than you doesn't mean I'm bad at Freddy. 
---
&gt;First of all 50% reduction to action speed, and by keeping all survivors asleep at all times this drastically slows down the game.
---
Okay, but what about them waking up very quickly because gens exist and oh yeah, awake survivors clapping them awake is a thing. Freddy's aura-reading and 50% reduction speed in the dreamworld means jack shit if the survivors aren't asleep for a considerable period of time.
---
Ive gone afk after hooking the last survivor in a game, come back to 10 minutes of angry ranting from a rank 2 or 3 (was rank 15 killer). I hadnt said a single thing and deliberately trying to keep the obsession and others alive for Rancor.
---
Ooooo suicide. Look at me guys i had suicidal thought everyone give me sympathy. 90% of the people that play DBD are emo old fucks so don't feel special because half of them have suicidal thoughts. But anyways, uhhh the game is dead. You compare it to fortite,apex,R6,COD and even Minecraft has more monthly players then DBD
---
THE GAME IS DEAD. You can look up the stats and its right next to h1z1
---
yeah that’s 90 percent of my post game chats 
---
Olives are a worse topping change my mind

When you noticed the Feng there, you should have pressed yourself against her to trap her in the corner and then hit her with a throwing hatchet. If you had done it that way, she wouldn’t have even made it to the gate.

Tbh, if you're an immersed Survivor that never gets found and also idle on Gen fixing while not going for saves, I guess it could be relaxing. 
---
The angle he was at made it impossible for the doctor to tell which locker was used. 
---
How tf did you manage to do the hatch achievement
---
I run WGLF, BT, Bond and Prove thyself. My perfect game is gen rushing 1.5 gens coop for my   quick obj 8000, then get two unhooks where the killer hits me just as the unhook happens giving 2 stacks. They rush after the BT, smack, realize their mistake but I'm gone by then. Repeat one more time for my full stacks. If I die I get a quick 11k x 2, and go repeat.in the next game. If I live I just get dulls and then go on a pallet camping chase to rack up as much boldness to double. It's a pretty decent and fast system as long as I get my coop right away. 
---
This looks amazing! Keep up the good work!
---
playing against legion is getting old
---
&gt; Granted they weren't transparent about this, but they didn't necessarily lie.
---
I mean, they absolutely lied.  They weren't transparent either but at different points they completely denied ever even mentioning an upcoming optimization patch and there were both clips from their dev streams and tweets from the official DBD account mentioning the patch that never happened.
---
I'm glad they've got their bearings now and have decided to truly dig in on console optimization now but they did lie.
---
I don't want to be greedy.  Give me the level of performance we see in the tutorial on console and I'll be happy.
---
That said, they did say that they would make an Xbox One X Enhanced version back in 2017... https://comicbook.com/gaming/2017/10/08/dead-by-daylight-xbox-one-x-enhancements-nintendo-switch/
---
So she the Doctor and the first word she think about is "Friendly" ?
---
Hmmm no, I enjoy this game with friends and I love killer, but want to play survivor with friends too, so if I can’t due to waiting I can’t really see a point in carrying on.
---
People seems to think there’s no counter play, these are people who don’t go against good nurses, a good nurse will down you far quicker then a legion will. 
---
Like you said? When did you mention anything close to that?
---
This tuesday.
---
People need to justify their purchase of the PS4 by bashing everything else. 
---
God, I can't even express what this makes me feel. 
---
"Here's my experience"
---
"Your experience is wrong because other people also have this experience and handled it in different ways"
---
Oh I know but also from my own experiences not a lot of killers realise that. I have played against loads of killers who use streamers and think 'I need to obliterate in this game to make it worth it'. They camp, they tunnel and they mori. Afterwards I just sit perplexed because had they just played normal they would have more points even if one got away lol. 
---
After playing high rank LoL for 4 and a half years, can confirm that Dbd is just friendly and sweet people.
---
And guys who complain about salt and toxicity have nevet actually experienced true salt and toxicity.
---
Oh, and try playinf r6 siege for 1k hours, lmao. Now that's a cesspool of toxicity
---
I suppose, but y'know, him being a detective I feel like he'd have a *detective's hunch* about how many totems are left in the match.
---
I don't know what logic you're using, but I gave you a discussion, which is what you were seemingly looking for when you made this post. 
---
I guess if you try hard enough you can make a statement like this that is blatantly wrong on all levels.     
---
The studio that put out the game was NOT Behavior, they bought it.  
---
They focus on needs and wants?  We need and want a better Freddy, and shirtless Myers.... Haven't seen shit regarding either.   Leatherface is an entirely useless killer only bought for his perk, which they refuse to allow us access to unless we buy him
---
Performance patches?  You must not play Console.   
---
How much they care?  They refuse to hotfix ANYTHiNG, and would rather spend time and money pumping out skins over fixing various bigs/issues that are *constantly* brought up on this forum.  Again, focus on needs and wants?  Lmfao.   The game is buggy as shit, and if you've spent more than a day on this sub you would've seen the backlash when they announced releasing the game on Switch in the current state it's in.
---
Transparent?  Yeah, I can see right through the bullshit into their cartoonish $-shaped-eyes.   
---
Love?  You mean of the money they're making off of gullible fucks like you, or the game?  It's widely believed they dont even test shit before releasing it due to some incresibly obvious and game-breaking bugs that have been seen after a patch.  How can you love the game and not even fucking play it?   
---
Dear god, go make a run at Congress or Trump's VP.  You're so confident in your own bullshit it's absolutely fascinating.
---
The add-ons have a lot of variety and i did consider putting him at the top, but even though the add-ons change a lot, they don't really change the power in the same level as Hag or Myers. Myers's and power can be turned into something entirely different using his Mirror add-ons and the Hag's power can also be turned into something almost entirely different with the body blocking add-ons. So even though i understand with what you're saying, the Doctor will always be "go to treatment to make people mad, use punishment to make people sad" no matter what add-ons he uses. That's why i put him in the tier below
---
During one of the events the survivors and I decided to farm, but then I accidentally hooked the wrong person and ended up killing them. I went to a corner and stood there in shame 'till everybody left.

Good job OP.

Oh god why does this match the meme so much 
---
I love it on my huntress, with knockout it's amazing
---
Billy in general can make the game hell for survivors. His add-ons don't make it that much worse. Nurse in general can make the game hell for survivors. Her add-ons can make it even worse

---
January 2019: 22k average players - 41,4k peak players
---
Doesn't really look dead to me. At least on PC it's running just fine and bigger than it ever was. In April 2017, the game had its all time low of 8,4k average players which is still far from dead. It's bigger than it ever was currently according to the data.
---
But people don't read anymore I guess. 
---
&gt; That's why their power needs to be completely reworked/replaced rather than just buffed or nerfed; either it's too strong or it's too weak.
---
+1 Said this since the day we got to play them, Legion's design breaks the game.
---
Thank you for your service.
---
NOED, that's why I use it 
---
Nice one, good job. I like it :)
---
I'd rather go against a good Nurse than Legion. 
---
We should ignore this guy, if he keeps posting like this, he will get banned in no time anyway. 
---
Mental disorders are a thing no one to this day understands and if a game can help an individual to get through it, that's wonderful and doesn't deserve to be called out like this. Maybe games can help other individuals just as well, maybe even this game. Who knows. 
---
It would be cool if it could count gens done in general, not specifically gens done by you. Like if you get tunneled for 3 gens you’ll get your 3 stacks anyway. 
---
"ooOOH you give the killer a notification if you fast vault?!"
---
I am glad you found your individual way of dealing with your individual problem (as mental disorders are different for every person and really complicated to understand even in modern sciences)
---
That's what he wanted to say ;)

run dead hard and it becomes not a big deal

Yeah 19k sounds fucking dead to me lmao

I can grind a single prestige in a day, but i don't solely play survivor &amp; if i play killer it's most likely Nurse with BBQ so it's quick games with 50k bp per game.

You're a male and got this lmao you're a fucking beta bitch pussy 😂 you got a DBD tat on your arm? You fucking loser lmaooo

I can’t tell what’s going on in the pictures

It was the Clown, but it could’ve been that the person just played as a different killer

I disagree strongly lol.

Thanks it's just making me feel self conscious about my tattoo

---
Imo, switching Spirit and Doctor makes more sense.
---
No problem, also the hag is worth it not just for the perks but for the ability
---
Honestly, Legion is not even annoying, they're just weak. People who cry about Legion are the same people who die to Freddie.  
---
Unless the Legion player is using the very clear meta stuff (such as Frank's Mixtape), which they won't have access to most of their matches, all they do is waste time, and not in the same, more effective way the Pig wastes time. They just kind of prolong chases.  
---
Legion needs a rework, but not in the way salty and toxic survivor mains want them reworked. They need a buff.
---
What are you even talking about
---
I'd be angry too if all I had to eat and drink was Turnips and Vodka.
---
these are crisssspppp tattoos. i love them!!!!
---
I would like to see the totem counter at least available as part of Small Game.  The biggest times I've had NOED be a problem is when the killer is able to get a hook near the totem, and even worse if it's near the totem and a gate.  At that point even Borrowed Time/other survivor perks can't save the person.  Aside from that, knowing the spawn points of totems makes finding it after it is active pretty quick usually, especially if you had already cleansed some number of totems during the match(or even just noted their locations to check later).  It's possible as survivor to make NOED essentially a shorter duration Haunted Ground that triggers at a more predictable time, but I also often see many survivors who are afraid of getting downed by it and stick nearby a gate despite knowing the killer is unlikely to stray too far away from the hook once a gate is open.  
---
It does suck when you were already being chased when the last gen pops though, but NOED or not, getting hooked at that point is often going to lead to at least 1 person dying from it.
---
How is this abuse? Just because they’re talking to each other? You could’ve chased one of them down instead of protecting all the totems. I don’t see any fault in the survivors behaviour. If this shouldn’t be allowed then camping should also not be allowed
---
He is charming
---
&gt;Wouldn't it make sense to make totems count visible in the hud?
---
Please no. Making totems feel like more of an actual objective for survivors will hurt my poor Hex: Devour Hope even more. I don't need survivors being reminded to cleanse totems. 
---
I'm sure breakdown would do the same as well
---
Same sound just a lot quieter. 
---
In response to your 2nd "point," congratulations, you are what's wrong with the game.
---
I mean the one that used to be in the picture before OP edited it.

„Hey, gamers! Are you ready for some spooky, solid 360p textures and flaming-hot 15 FPS on the go? Dead by Daylight is here to scare you off your socks for the Nintendo Switch! B)“
---
Halloween from 1978 and Halloween II are more than enough if you only want it for the DBD lore.
---
If you like the character you should just watch them all, they are not that bad.
---
Also the new movie from 2018 has a lot of cool references from the 1978 movie (and its supposed to happen after the 1978 one, ignoring all the sequels)
---
Maybe the way you play is making them be toxic
---
Maybe she wants to hug it out
---
Reminds me of the time I had a Generator outside on top of the Balcony facing the street. Classic Haddonfield.
---
I think the game needs to be way harder on people who DC. If a person leaves even a 10th of their matches in a month's time, I believe they deserve a lengthy temporary ban.  
---
As for people with dodgy connections being punished for something out of their control, while I can see the frustration of it, it isn't even close to being common enough to justify the amount of toxic scum-fucks who leave matches for the hell of it.  
---
I also think it'd be a good idea to implement a DC player pool, where people who DC are put in a low priority queue, greatly increasing their wait time to join a lobby, as well as try to only pit them with other people who DC.
---
Artist tag in picture
---
Statistics page for a player would be neat.
---
Idd like to compare myself as a Freddy player and see how good I am compared to all other Freddy players, as an example.

I‘d suggest the first two ones for lore and I really would recommend the newest Halloween movie, „Halloween 2018“, that was probably the best Halloween movie so far imo.

It's my favourite. The right combo with it is devastating.
---
Ah just checking.
---
Meh, just haven't updated them, they work fine.
---
As for 2 hex perks, you'd be surprised how effective devour hope can be 
---
I have reported it and submitted a ticket but from my experience nothing ever happens
---
There wasn't enough time to fully heal though? And if Jake had been a little bit closer to the exit, Feng healing him would've not let him escape.
---
I know that Devour hope is good, but 2 hex perks is to much, specially if you have Ruin. Ruin is in effect as the game starts while Devour is a bit sneaky and comes in later. So by having ruin survivors will start looking for it and when they find a totem they'll cleanse it and then boom Devour gone as well (if you are unlucky).

Ha, you think we'd even get 5?

You keep telling yourself that kid but the facts don't care about your feelings
---
Ranks reset on the 13 of every month
---
It should reset everyone that is below 10 to rank 15 I believe.
---
Because he can down you regardless of your skill as survivor. Whereas with every other killer, aside from Nurse, the chase is entirely on whether the survivor fucks up or not.
---
Survivors don't like it when they aren't the power role.
---
Why tf do we need to compare games anyway? It doesnt even matter. Plus a game thats actually dead is F13 or Deathgarden. DBD is far from dead. 
---
I agree. McLean said Carburetor is overtuned for a green and will be nerfed at some point. I refuse to play Billy and Nurse out of principal.
---
I'm dead.

---
It's the hotness tax.
---
1) Ranks reset on every 13th of the month
---
2) I got to Rank 1 Killer for the first time, and yeah it's that bad.I am just waiting for reset at this point.And the higher ranks you are, the less enjoyable the game is.
---
Just ignore the messages and move on.Blocking them does wonders
---
As a Doctor main...NOW WE ARE TALKING 
---
Ohhhhh thanks for letting us know that your statement is invalid and means absolutely nothing 👋👋
---
I got dull key with weaved ring (only ace in the hole and no plunderers)
---
There a few rotten grapes, but overall I really like the community 
---
It's expressly related to the first one though, it's meant to be a direct sequel to try and straighten out the goofy ass history of the franchise.
---
Rainbow maps are even better 150 for literally anything, you walk by a hook, 150 points,  you walk by the exit gates boom another 150, walk within range of a totem, bam another 150.
---
On the same level with the Windows XP start sound...
---
I agree. If not my complete suggested \[ToP\] then at least the 15 mins per DC. Something to say, "Hey, STOP doing that!" It really ruins the experience for all involved. I don't mind 3-4 flashlights, tea-bagging, decisive, broken hooks or gen rushing. No salt here for those or whatever. But a broken match due to a quit? One, "Okay, might have been an accidental connection fail." Two, "Kid had to leave for dinner/class?" Three in five trials, "Oooo hell nah. F this man. Just play the game." Every game cannot be easy. That would eventually get boring. Me personally, I want a challenge to make me better. "Oh you crawled back through the window. Bet it won't happen again; \[insert evil laugh here\]."
---
1 - Rank reset is the 13th of every month. Everyone doesn't just go back to 20. For where you'd be reset to, [here's a link](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rank) just jump to the *Seasons* part of the wiki and look at *Rank Reset* and you can calculate where you'd be placed at the next rank reset. 
---
2 - Depends on the role you're playing and the time of day you're playing. During the day, doesn't matter what role I'm playing, I can usually find a match quick enough. It does take longer at the red ranks (rank 1 killer/ rank 4 survivor) but not much. Though, searching for a game at night, in the survivor role, it takes forever to find a match at the red ranks. So, if you're not playing late at night, it's not much of an issue. Playing the killer I never have problems finding games. Sometimes the matchmaker will screw over survivors by placing someone who doesn't belong in your match with you, but thems the breaks. Either way, I find it is worth it making it to the red ranks, simply for the challenge in game play. If you enjoy the challenge, you'll enjoy it a lot more than the other ranks. 
---
Can't pick em up while being healed, so she'd have to hit her and go into the animation. It has to be timed right though
---
Yeah, it’s not awful I just didn’t enjoy it. 
---
Better than the top comment's one. Actually has the right amount of "Do"s. It's important...
---
Yeah I was gonna make the percent smaller at first but I wanted to make sure that the perk would be powerful enough to outweigh the small benefits the survivors get from the perk.
---

He doesn't just look like Michael Jackson.....he acts like him too if you know what I mean....
---
I'll see you in court.
---
1. Agreed.  
---
2. Not Valid.
---
Not going to argue why (2) is not valid. Just going to say that, "NO DC is Valid."
---
I say P3 your survivor main, then that's about it. Survivors are just skins, and for killers - well perks matter more for them.
---
I always love these mini-bear trap shitposts...
---
That's new :D
---
For me Myers is the most boring character to play as xD
---
Yeah, WHEN you compare them, they dont need to be compared. Dont worry, you didnt hurt my feelings, youre just wrong. Why are you even here if the game is so dead? Why arent you in the other games subs then? I dont find the top games fun. Battle royale is boring and all COD games are the same. 
---
Valid point indeed. I would still implement a 15 min DC ToP regardless. Even if nothing further is set in place. Something has to be there to say, "What you did is a no no."
---
Freddy is so underrated its not even funny. His playstyle is unique and i do think he's B tier. The only problematic thing here is that you placed him too high. I think he should be moved down one spot or two
---
Poor nea didn't get a single kill
---
I also made a version for the next chapter
---
https://imgur.com/a/oFINPRr
---
Legion scary :(
---
But they change everything, it often changes the outcome of a match which is pretty huge if you ask me. Everything I listed changes an aspect of the Billy's power, and forces the survivor to play around it. Yes I'm aware that Myers can mori people but MOST people use faster tier up (or silent T1) so yeah, so much for that. Scratched mirror is pretty cool but both Pig and Wraith has it (albeit weaker, but still does), and there goes his 'unique' addons.
---
Idk if this was a newer play but when I was new I didn’t know that you could crouch after getting unhooked
---
Can't the pig down them in one hit with her special attack?
---
All you really need is Halloween (1978) but if you want some EXTRA SPICY lore, watch Halloween 6, here's the [plot synopsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween:_The_Curse_of_Michael_Myers) if you want to save time.
---
**Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers**
---
Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is a 1995 American slasher film directed by Joe Chappelle and written by Daniel Farrands. The film stars Donald Pleasence in one of his final film appearances. The film also features the first starring role by Paul Rudd and Marianne Hagan. The sixth installment in the Halloween film series, it follows Dr.

No it makes perfect sense you just can't admit you're wrong. Dude I went to a ivy school i was top of my class and you a normal person with the IQ of a chimp is going to tell me that it doesn't make sense. Maybe im just to smart but the graph is there and the number don't lie 
---
try playing some Telltale games C:
---
Before I experienced it, I tought people were exaggerating. Once I loaded into a match, I realised they weren't. I think it's about 10dB louder than normal intro music. That might be qn exaggeration but I don't think it's that much away from it

As much as I love it, the series is a bit of a mess.  
---
I'd suggest watching the original Halloween and Halloween 2 for starters.  
---
If you like them, you can keep going with the whole series.  
---
Halloween 3 is something else, it doesn't involve Myers. It was an attempt to make the franchise an anthology but it didn't do well.  
---
Halloween 4, 5, and The Curse of Michael Myers continue the story after the second one. They add more lore and explain why Michael Myers is the way he is.  
---
They decided to retcon everything with Halloween H20, which ignores every movie after Halloween II. Halloween Resurrection is a sequel to this one.  
---
Then there's the Rob Zombie reboots which are really controversial among Halloween fans.  
---
And finally there's the new Halloween movie that came out last year. It ignores everything after the original movie and is set 40 years later.

I go for the save if I know for a fact the other survivors aren't, if they've not been saved in ~25-30 seconds, or if someone else gets hit (so I know the killer's not camping)
---
That's a pretty good build you got there ,I am looking to run a similar type of perk setup once I get bond
---
He’s really fun to play as, and he’d be my main if Pig and Freddy weren’t so damn fun. People will complain about him, rightfully so, but you can’t deny that he’s fun. 
---
Survivor isn't too bad if you don't mind playing against hillbilly.
---
for Killer it is way worse and I do not recommend it.
---
you mean a pedo
---
The emblem system.
---
Not a single one of those games runs at a stable 60 fps lmao. Especially games like Uncharted, Last of Us, etc. the average is going to be about 30-40.
---
I think OP's trying to claim that they got 4 iridescent emblems in every single game but their first one. 
---
No.
---
I don’t think so, and even if it does the terror radius has to be louder. Never even heard of an ambient heartbeat till you pointed it out, and I can still tell when the killers coming into the basement. 
---
You are playing at low ranks, not when survivor are any good at the game.
---
Get to the the Red ranks and spend some time there and you will understand.
---
Survivors who play well will always win, no matter what the killer does (unless he is nurse).
---
Same, tried running steam as admin and opening it and still nothing. I’ve just submitted a ticket to dead by daylight so hopefully something will work! 
---
If she was such a baby than that means she got no kills right? 
---
Can we talk about the blue whale insert? I’m confused. 
---
She's doing an achievement
---
Welcome to DBD. survivors will be angry and toxic to you no matter what. Play how you want, send them a "gg" and move on. People on this sub will tell you "don't play toxic" but i can assure you from experience that doesn't work. So just be used to it, and expect it.
---
You can turn chat off for what it’s worth 
---
Now the best dash addons are video tape and John's medical files. You don't really need straps right now :D

Just to suffer?

Evil Within 1: Spooky Myers.

Evil Within 2: Normal Myers.
---
Evil Within 3: Big Man Myers.
---
Evil Within 3: 3: Angery Myers. (Tombstone)
---
lol ok didnt know billy wad the hardest killer
---
Probably bad ping
---
No no no, it's **ㄒ卄丨匚匚**.
---
Hez a lazy designed character, a simple mechanic with 0 fun for either surv or killer. Remove all the skill from the game at the same time he ruin the survivor experience.
---
They dins even reach their goal; legion was suposed to be always hiting all survivors, but the mechanic only encourage tuneling. 
---
Don’t let them get to you bud. It’s awesome that the game helped you and don’t let anyone tell you what is or isn’t appropriate to attach importance to. If it’s meaningful for you that’s all that matters. For the record I think the tat is sweet as hell! :)
---
Even against SWF, it'll buy you some extra time. The perk just loses a lot of its effectiveness. 
---
Still is just a gimmick at that point. 
---
I don't usually play Huntress but wanted to give her a try for my daily,  I surprised myself and did great with her, I'm usually terrible!  Got some fantastic shots in &amp; was really pleased.  After the game I received a toxic message calling me desperate etc... :\  The surv I received it from played pretty badly.  
---
I do wonder if these people are toxic in real life too.
---
You cant be picked up while being healed. Killer would have to hit feng which gives time for jake to crawl out
---
The Babadook should be a Killer
---
I'm glad you think it does. Trying to get the face right took me quite some time.
---
If the killer is camping once all gens are powered the other survivors should just leave and they will only get one kill. I'm surprised how many don't do that. Even against NOED. 
---
Well the modifications i would do to it is, make it 60 seconds at base and the level of the perk changes how many people can be affected at once up to 3 people at level 3.  This will still makes players afraid of it, but still having counterplay with looping etc.
---
4K Nurse on console? I salute you man.
---
He isn’t, but why would people even use ruin in general if killers can just kill?
---
I mean just win it’s not that hard 4head
---
You tell this person”go get help if you have suicidal thoughts” and then when you find out they’re male “lmAO bETa pUsSY.” People like you are why men are scared to be honest about their mental health struggles.

Thanks for the detailed answer! I usually don’t play late at night, so I’m guessing that should be fine. I enjoy a challenge and also challenging game play, but if its going to be billy after billy after billy or nurse after nurse after nurse I fear it might get very repetitive. I don’t want every game to be the same, because then it does not feel challenging anymore, just annoying. Thanks again!

This image is bouncing on my phone screen when I scroll up and down.

Sometimes, but most of the time I solo and when I play swf it’s with one or max two other people.
---
i know billy is easy to master it was a joke. There's no point on using ruin on any killer except setup killers if you know how to pressue decently
---
Can you edit his model maybe? To stop seeing his suckworthy nipples? If you have any knowledge about this please comment.
---
I don’t mind playing against hillbilly, but I would mind playing against him 10 x in a row lol
---
Yeah I suck at Killer anyways so its gonna be a loooong time before I start ranking up properly with Killer and even then I think I will 100 % stay away from Killer Red Ranks

Well, specifically I’m  pointing out how hypocritical it is that you say they should seek help and then turn around and make fun of them when you find out they’re male. Men face a lot of stigma when it comes to being open about mental illness, such as you know, being harassed for how they cope with their depression. And that directly contributes to them not seeking help. 
---
But anyway, I’m sure you have more trolling and try hard edgelording to do elsewhere. Have fun. 
---
You serious? 
---
Considering the PTB will be out Tuesday (maybe Monday), it is more than likely that they already moved your savefile to PTB, which means grinding now would be pointless. 
---
Yes.
---
best tier list
---
No one will know the answer to that question unless a dev announced it.
---
You will only find speculation to questions like that.
---
S Tier:
---
* Nurse- Everyone knows why. But a hot take I have (that i see no one agreeing with me about) is Nurse would be a lot worse if survivors would change their mindset when playing her.
---
* Spirit- once you get good you can body people at pallets, the mindgame potential is off the charts.
---
A+ Tier:
---
* Hillbilly- I think hillbilly is overrated. He is head and shoulders above A tier but i think he is way worse than Spirit and Nurse.
---
A Tier:
---
* Clown- Has no downsides, can shut down loops, and end chases super quick. People think he isn't as good because his power isn't as strong *at a glance* as some of the others. But while it doesn't sound like much, it really is a lot.
---
* Myers- Everyone knows why myers is good.
---
* Hag- super map dependent but very effective. S tier on a good map, C tier on a bad one.
---
B Tier:
---
* Leatherface- Very good against bold survivors, and super underrated in a chase. If you can catch someone in a bad spot you win, period. If that doesn't happen, you can still force pallet drops early. Also counters annoying plays like bodyblocking and flashlights.
---
* Huntress- Map dependent, super slow and easy to hear, can get fucked on certain tiles and buildings. But hatchets are very, very good if they land.
---
* Pig- Stealth is underrated, Traps are super good for an Endgame build and for slowing down the match in general. No real downsides.
---
C tier:
---
* Trapper- Lots of risk and work for little payoff. Can still do well, but power is easy to avoid.
---
* Legion- Easy to bully, surprisingly bad at chases even though he can fucking vault pallets.
---
* Wraith- everyone knows why wraith is low.
---
F tier:
---
* Doctor- brings little to the table outside of some addons. Shock is sometimes helpful.
---
* Freddy- 7 seconds before he can hit a survivor. You cannot change chases without waiting 7 seconds. You cannot defend Ruin without waiting 7 seconds. You have no map pressure at all with Freddy because in the time it takes for you to get a swing they are at a loop. Yes, the mindgame is nice. No, it does not make up for how shitty of a downside this is.
---
At least the face camped guy is being nice about it. He may be the only person that does this though
---
Perfect game 100/10
---
i too play dbd on my calculator
---
19k players is obviously enough to sustain the dev team and add more content to the game regularly. 
---
Just because other games have millions of players doesn't mean this one is dead with 19k. Comparing it to other games has no relevance in this context.
---
Camping pig? Ew. You have make your choice for a reason
---
good survivors in NA  , will do this 
---
u play this game for 2 weeks solo survivor and u are rank 5?
---
and some people wonder why this game is garbage
---
On behalf of this oinker as a fellow oinker main I’m sorry
---
Well for the harder ones most people farm, and for all the adept survivor/killer trophies anything that speeds up leveling to get them to level 15 (used to be level 20) like BBQ and wglf help there.  Other than that it's really just picking a trophy from the list and going for it
---
If you're playing survivor it's a walk in the park considering DbD is meant to be a horror game.
---
If someone dc’s, replace it with a bot. 
---
There are downsides to playing alongside a computer al, but nothing compared to being down a teammate. 
---
Honestly it can't be that hard of a fix right? I have no idea why they've had this bug sit around for so long. I feel like I'm gunna go deaf pretty soon unless they fix it
---
I hated that when I was new to Dbd. But after countless hours I learned to ignore it. Random fucking players and their opinions are one of the most unimportant things in this world.
---
The short quip, the monotone voice, the trap on the desk, the screaming, it all fit so perfectly. I can honestly this is a top tier post and I died laughing
---
It was probably between 49.5 and 49.999% and you just ended up getting a rounding error.  Still F for being so close. 
---
Well no, I’m rank 6 and while I agree that ranking up is not really hard in this game, I have played daily and probably about 80 hours now? I’ve been off from work for the past weeks so I have played a lot. It’s not like I played 1 or 2 rounds a day and ranked up from that.
---
Grinds not over yet bud, those dlc trophies are still out there, waiting to be claimed 
---
Does anyone have a link for the original clip of the guy saying this? It made me laugh my ass off
---
I don't think so. They propably let all their negativity out on games because they don't have to fear any consequences.
---
No, it isn’t one hit, that’d be op as fuck
---
These would be some sick stickers
---
Main issue with this, isnt even the legitimacy it's the fact that you cant add. The legion group graduated in 1986 its 2019 they sure as hell ain't teens anymore 
---
Totally worth getting injured from touching it though!! (I hope)
---
Please please don't let this idiot affect you ! 
---
Trust me I am not the guy who gives a fuck about someone randomly and not a SJW who gets offended over something really quickly, but what he said was just plain idiotic
---
Keep your chin up and stay happy and healthy
---
Usually it’s one of three things that net an in game DC. Hissy fits, asshole play, and connections.  Hissy fits have been rare for me - I’ve had only one so far playing legion and I feel the rage is a bit exaggerated in this sub.  Ofc this is just my experience , most come from wraith tbh or me lagging a lot, so I think ops issue is his connection if it’s THAT many dcs
---
Lol don't try act like some sanctimonious twat who's better than everyone, we know this game is not that popular but it's far from dead and H1Z1
---
Your strongest killer with BBQ&amp;Chilli, thats it. 
---
I also do it for deliverance
---
BHVR?
---
I feel bad for being the best with legion and doc. I am a terrible human being.
---
I had revived in the cellar. I didn't know the killer went AFK on the stairs.
---
Is this also work for perk icons? Do Will I not get banned?
---
Lolololol look at me I am getting hated on by everyone for saying something really dumb and I am just gonna go with it 
---
Been in reddit for so long buddy don't tryna act like you don't wanna cry rn
---
Maybe all of them ?
---
there not dolls.....there action figures 
---
Legion is just easy. Very low skill cap. Lots of people are good as him. 
---
What do you mean destalk? Like speed up your evil within 3 duration?
---
Empathy is one of the best perks for survivor because it gives you so much information. Getting a bloodpoint perk instead of a perk that would actually affect the game is a bad choice imo
---
Well good for you those are the best killers for farming
---
The devs
---
Oh cool! 
---
Saying not a single one can do it makes me question if you know what you're talking about. You should check your PS4 because a LOT of these games runs stable at 60. As I said, Resident Evil 7 runs smoothly at 60 because in VR it must run even higher. But not limited to it: GoW 3, Yakuza Kiwami, Hollow Knight, Outlast and a few more. [IGN shows some games that are capable of](https://m.ign.com/wikis/xbox-one/PS4_vs._Xbox_One_Native_Resolutions_and_Framerates). Also, TLoU remastered runs at 60 for sure, but not so smooth, as in certain areas it drops a bit.
---
And now, even if most games didn't run at 60, DbD looks like a 2014 indie game and run worse than 30 fps, lol.
---
This optimization will be greatly appreciated!
---
Also no.
---
Yea it is. Let me know if you have any interest!
---
Well I am quite good as wraith and doc too but I main legion now cuz it's fun for me (idk why rly I don't) .
---
İ still cant believe a game played this much can still be in this broken state
---
Depends on the killer and how much you tunnel vision on what you're doing. If it's a normal terror radius killer it's usually whatever but there are certain killers that still can get a jump out of me. Usually a good pig, Tier 1 Myers, Spirit with prayer beads, Hillbilly with tinkerer etc.
---
This. Lol! Basically me
---
Yes I'm gonna have to call bullshit, stalked the whole ew3 and the didn't lose any red. 
---
Urban dictionary search 1337 if you didnt get it
---
Just take the mercy shot already. I've been here too long. I'm not strong enough to witness the full potential of his power.
---
For Rancor, if you kill the obsession early you still get the location alerts after they're dead you just don't get the free mori at the end. But I wonder if that will change when the DS changes go live and someone uses it and becomes the new obsession?
---
Ah, I get what you mean now. I had just figured that Myers and Hags play-styles completely change when using those add-on's, Myers trading his one shot ability to become a wall hacking ninja, and Hag trading her ability to teleport to become a faster moving, body blocking chaser, and both are entirely different play-styles from what they normally do that screws with survivors. In that idea, Doc had them beat by being able to change his style in more ways than them, but the only thing that changes Docs power is really just the decent interview tape, and stupid scrapped tape, but those don't change the power in the same way; they just alter how he shocks survivors. Kinda wish he had an add-on that changed his shocks to stuns instead of madness gain, but then everybody would just whine about how OP he is. Still, among the killers he has more ways to change up his play-style and be less predictable than the others on the tier you have him on, but I understand now why you put him there instead of the top.
---
Drake and Josh?
---
More likr Drake and THICC
---
It looks good :D
---
you do you, but solo TotH can be absolutely hilarious. I've had games where multiple survivors died to get TotH and in postgame they are mad af.
---
I feel bad for you 
---
          ~ baby killer 2019
---
WGFF*
---
What bugs me is those situations where you're hooked near a gen you've almost finished and the killer doesn't kick it for whatever reason and you go to finish it after being unhooked and instead of helping or even letting you GET to the gen the other survivor insists on healing you. It's like they fail to grasp that you could both finish the gen quickly, sprint off, THEN heal.
---
Actually, my mom bought it from Dairy Queen. It's fine, I'll just get something else.
---
Came here to say this. Thanks for doing the lord's work. Check for God damned perk icons. There's a reason why things like we'll make it, leader, prove thyself, etc have icons.
---
Hell yeah
---
Hag is godlike. Definitely (in my opinion) one below Nurse’s tier. It’s just that people don’t know how to play her - for example people don’t know really know not to chase with her, to put traps in places where survivors tend to run, not directly at pallets, etc...
---
Give us an idea for his power and perks. Otherwise, hell no
---
I agree.
---
The Entity's trials exist outside of time, just as the Entity does. That's why the newest Killer could be from the Dark Ages while the Legion comes from 1996.
---
Additionally, even though Legion was kidnapped in 1996, they will never age and will always physically remain teenagers no matter how long they remain in the trials.
---
Guess I’m Korean
---
Me: Says anything
---
I'm a Hag main but on rare occasions I do play Pig I don't do this. It's dumb. Let them be saved. Chase someone else. Then hook them again later and get the sacrifice. :D
---
I like to try atleast, I go for every 4K I want and I do as much as I can for a 4e aswell. Idk why people are upset - she had to guarantee her kill, while we have to guarantee our survival... what confuses me most is survivors expecting them to just give up and run around as they ninja unhook.
---
It is called Survivor
---
Did that guy seriously white ward a yellow flashlight 😬
---
I was still laughing when they buried me.
---
Freddy can moonwalk as well which makes his tier 8x more funny
---
The map, Springwood. The killer, Michael Myers. They had taken a secret offering into the match also, which I didn't really pay much attention to at the time.
---
1 minute into the match I was already on my 1st hook and was rescued off the hook by one of my fellow survivors. By this time we had started to pop the generators and Michael had began hooking other people. 3 generators were done and I saw that Michael had killed his 1st survivor. Not long after that he killed another one, his offering was the Mori that would let him kill everyone who had been hooked once.
---
I began my quest to ensure I wasn't going to get killed. I was going to survive this game and make it back to the campfire. I worked on the 4th generator and made my way to a house with another inside it. The terror radius of Michael began, I prayed he wouldn't come into the house to check. Thankfully he didn't and went to the other side of the map and stayed there, regressing another generator on the other side.
---
I found a green toolbox in a chest and worked on the final generator, hoping that he didn't come back to check on it. The exit gate was powered and I ran for it, holding down the power switch and hoping for he wouldn't get there in time. Unfortunately for me, he was making his way there as he chased my fellow survivor. Evil Within 3 was popped and he downed them. He picked them up, he hadn't hooked this survivor, I mentally apologised to them as I had already been hooked and didn't want to die in this game, I wanted to live.
---
The exit gate open and I ran, Michael hooked them as I made my escape, I look behind me as I left the map. I saw the unmistakable spikes of the Entity pop up. Michael had just activated Blood Warden. I had just had my closest escape in Dead by Daylight. My hoping for a miracle paid off. And I had the biggest smile on my face because of that single moment
---
Long one I know but for something like that, I needed to tell a tale.
---
Tl;Dr - Had a really lucky escape against a Michael using Blood Warden. If I was a second slower of be was a second faster I would have died. Was probably the best escape from a killer I've had in this game
---
Because throwing menhirs on survivors would not leave much to hook, by Toutatis!
---
weebs
---
I always text GG EZ TRASH to killers after the game. Fuck killer mains
---
I had the daily that required me to unhook a survivor so of course I went for the save. 
---
Peeeeer tooooooo peeeeeeeer
---
Power: Scream pitifully.
---
To warn you on what’s to come
---
It’s a teachable from Dwight Fairfield
---
Hey, don't be dissuaded by what salty survivors say. If you feel a certain killer is best for you, then there's not a damn thing they can do to stop you. You're at the disadvantage and have to take what you can get as a killer. 
---
You don’t need a new PC you can just get a new keyboard
---
The pants should totally be his leggins 
---
Okay, just thought I'd point out how much I like your flair. 
---
This is all the better - or more fun Choice. If I want to win as killer is obvious that I want less survivors gone ASAP. While you can argue about two injured survs healing can stop gens from going , it’s a risk. So depending on the match thus far I’ll hit either one for the situation . So while your way is awesome and friendly- it isn’t the point of the game. Kudos to you for doing it, but logically the best choice to win is remove survs ASAP. 
---
Yes you did get lucky a smart griefer would move from that edge to the other edge as soon as they saw what you were attempting. 
---
4/10 would grief again
---
However I don't like Sprint Burst, because it doesn't provide the convenience I like in a chase (similar to balance landing).
---
Their downsides definitely work, though. Award-winning Chilli makes the tantrum last about 5 or 6 whole seconds, no joke.
---
Thanks that’s really helpful I need to start putting points in him 
---
Because it doesnt work when I want it to, like when I'm against a mikey or wraith.
---
I thought for the longest time it made the timer go down quicker, but I guess it doesnt. Not sure why it doesn't. Each swing including a missed one should take off a chunk of each power.
---
&gt;Doctor with Distressing, BBQ, Thrill of the Hunt and Beast of Prey.
---
Why Distressing on Doctor without Unnerving Presence at least? He already max out his Deviousness in a heartbeat purely by using his power. Distressing would just make it that you reach the 8k within the first minute of the game, then its a waste of a perk slot for the rest of it.
---
I hate whenever I see this suggestion "dOcToR wItH dIsTrEsSiNg". Sure you reach the cap for one category very quick but you might struggle to get points in Sacrifice and Brutality considering he is a mid-ish tier killer. 
---
Just use the best killer you can play, using the best build and just make sure to include BBQ in that. 
---
Bubba he gives Franklins and BBQ Two amazing perks, one of which lets you progress the game faster 100% of the time
---
Clown's power actually hurts him, pay attention to your movement *after* you throw the bottle. 
---
You will notice that you get a significant slowdown that gives survivors enough distance to pretty much nullify the effects of the gas (if you don't run bleach that is).
---
 He shortens loops, yes, but someone who knows what to do against clown, will loop maybe once if it's actually safe and then camp the pallet. Clown can't do anything against survs camping the pallet
---
Pinaccle of culture righ here!
---
Well, devs are supposed to listen to their audience if they want this game to have a future somehow. This is clearly a bug, it's supposed to be their job to fix it. We're not talking about a power-playing technique that requires tweaks or balancing of some sort: this is bad programming. 
---
I'm still too green on this to actually know if devs care about this or not, though, so I'm just hoping they really care about their project.
---
Was it 96 or 86? I haven't looked at the varsity jacket cosmetic for a bit but still, Jeff is a grown ass man so I'd assume they are at least 20 
---
Nice work! Thoroughly wrecking a group of survivors like this is altogether too satisfying. 
---
It will help you get out more easily from bear traps (25% at base) or unhook yourself (4% at base). 
---
This is the worst damn feeling in this game, especially when you see the obsession icon shaking without a terror radius, so you know the killer is miles away but still they run halfway across the map.
---
You want toxic 12 year-olds to swarm DBD? Because that's how you get toxic 12 year-old to swarm DBD.
---
It all started because The Clown told The Doctor that he was, in fact, pagliacci the clown
---
"GODDAMN IT" said the Trapper, dropping his weapon and pulling the trap back apart. 
---
If you think its hag crouch everywhere, her traps wont go off if you aren't standing 
---
Damn, calm down. This much blind rage can’t be good for your heart. 😱
---
I'd really like it if the Devs occasionally released new add ons for killers that switched up their gameplay along with dlcs, along the lines of Myers and Hag's more dramatic ones. Would be an easy way to keep the game fresh and add new strategies that don't necessarily need to be super viable.
---
Welcome to "I want more attention" 101.
---
Some would disagree but I think aftercare is the best aura perk for survivors because they can see you as well. I can’t tell you how many times my teammates run to body block for me
---
On my way out with a killer behind me or I can point them to the open door. You have to play to the perk though, be altruistic and it’s god tier. 
---
Caught myself doing this on my last hook against a hillbilly
---
Please use the [Megathread.](https://redd.it/aqchce)
---
I'd argue that hag is pretty good. I started my Killer career as Trapper and liked his gameplay but hated gathering traps, so hag was perfect for me and I play her quite a bit. She was horrible before her buffs and I think that stigma stuck around but she's actually a pretty above-average-tier killer now. She also starts with a really good perk and two decent perks, so there's that.
---
Freddy is terrible because his power works against him more than it helps him. The only plus is the free tracking without need of perks, and in lower ranks being invisible is okay but Wraith does it better.
---
She was abducted by the Covenant. 
---
After that stupid fog horn im deaf anyways
---
I love when survivors get upset because ONE of them died. Especially if I am just doing a daily. Had a game where the survivor I facecamped for being a douche typed out "get yeeted". Dunno what the fuck that means, but I got my daily, so 30k for me!
---
WHat?! I can't hear you over the sound!
---
Agreed. Good thing it's over for him, right?
---
I don't enjoy that sir's content. D:
---
If the survivor severely fucks up she can. On that same note hag can do the same thing. Hit them once and then they run into a trap giving you a down. You can’t make tier lists based around low level gameplay.
---
Frames are still like 30 for me with a lot of frame drops on the s
---
Don't use NOED, it promotes playing bad
---
#FARMED
---
I feel like it’s definitely in the Roman Empire era, something to do with the Ides of March 
---
NOED
---
gg ez against afk killer ZUBLegion :wheelchair: good survivor btw
---
We killers hate them and fix them our own way.

You would be surprised how effective the mindgame is in terms of getting pallets down and getting a free hit. If you have the timing of your visibility down, it's super easy to fool survivors. Also, you don't have to directly find people, you can literally keep holding down M2 while walking around and the power will lock on them. You can also abandon someone who you hit to slow the game down even more.
---
No I mean that you can stalk survivors again that are full on red. So survivors you can't stalk anymore you can stalk them again.
---
Ohhh. Took me a moment, but yeah! Wtf?
---
This is really well-thought-out. 
---
F
---
But you do see it. Maybe you don’t see out the exit gate often but that doesn’t mean I don’t.
---
I was gonna defend Trapper but I realized that can go for both killers.
---
Time to farm without being a jerk! Hooray! 
---
Actually, constantly lunging makes you cover more distance. It's weird. (At least, without movement speed addons. Maybe with too, not sure.)
---
Oh no, a Survivor perk with a very situational potential weakness/counter play? Quick, make it OP!
---
Stop asking the game to play for you and just adapt, dude.
---
&gt;this isn't
---
&gt;4chan
---
 Bloodlust isn't needed if your a good killer and the good loops take a while to get to giving you time to get to them, and the loops are a *bit* to long making it super easy to gain distance, and they're also easily countered and mind gamed in my opinion
---
Then what youre asking for doesnt exist. Deal with it 
---
ARCHIMEDES, GET OUT OF ZERE
---
You'll get slightly less DCs with doc, so more points overall.
---
Sometimes noobs like myself do it to finish a daily ritual. 
---
It was an expression dumbass
---
I was joking but ok
---
upvoted. I always tunnel shirless daves or unhok them in front of the killer. I dont play DBD to have gay shoved in my face. 
---
VIVA A SHIRLESS MEG!
---
Yes but that’s not a counter to him. He can vault pallets and windows making loops not a thing. Sure you can pallet stun him to make his power go away for just a few seconds but there’s only a limited amount of pallets, so you manly just gotta rely on juking him but even if you’re doing so well he can still hit you because he just swings 20 times just to get that one hit.

Halloween night 1963
---
in Haddonfield Illinois there would be
---
A gruesome case of sibling rivalry
---
Between kids of the Myers Family 
---
When Michael a six year old leisurely 
---
Walked into his sister's room silently 
---
And Butchered her body so violently 
---
Thing is, as strong as Nurse is, she DOES have counterplay: since she's slower than survivors, she has to land blinks to get hits - and she can be juked out, which is very satisfying to do. Also stealth, she can't hide very well, but you can, and should.  
---
And lastly, Nurse requires skill and practice, easily being the hardest killer to play - high skillcap, immense potential, and fun to play against because she's so different from other killers. 
---
Now invert everything I've written above, and you'll have an image of Legion.
---
110% MS and power can be mitigated by flashlights and Urban. But still really strong
---
Knyuck knyuck knyuck, gonna moitalize ya
---
Any survivor main can attest that Totems take forever to find the majority of time unless you’re lucky, and with a perk that literally gives you a mori after a certain amount of unhooks on EVERY survivor- a perk that TELLS YOU IF THEYRE ON THE TOTEM - and one that can virtually guarantee a 4K of people aren’t careful, those kinda need counterplay too. Decisive is easily missed most of the time, unbreakable practically never gets used, deliverance is obsolete if the killer focuses on you early on and borrowed time literally just leads to tunneling. So yeah, “Yikes”. 
---
Not sure how this is how MCoye was *specifically* wrecked by Korean Gamers. All I can say is NA players can and will do this too, but I want pips and bloodpoints so if I see a totem, I will cleanse it. If I see a chest, I will search it. Maybe not so much sabo hooks unless I have a daily or want to play that way for a match just to change stuff up a bit. 
---
I do have to ask why someone would complain about camping but not see it as toxic? And how does camping help the killer? 3 gens can be done while the person is hooked if no one comes for them (or sometimes by the time they are in struggle) it’s not a very good strategy for the killer, I would think. 
---
Iron Grasp is a hard counter to this perk. Paired with Agitation? Forget it, you're still going to a hook no matter what. 
---
Because you don’t if you’re really gonna try to say killers have the short end of the stick right now. 
---
I never thought if it that way! I must get CAAAAAAAKEEE!
---
Ah the good old matchmaking system! Normally around 9-10pm I start getting matched up with people in South America and in live in the south east part of the USA! Ping will be from 300-600
---
Yeah, I also thought it was neat to see some of the triple A games pop up real close to the top at their launch, and then just drop drop drop. 
---
It’s literally a logical fallacy to say killers are being treated unfairly when - if anything- they’re being favored. 
---
i think he might have miss clicked the wrong locker and didnt see you get back out
---
No. Just... no. 
---
This perk *has* been nerfed. Do you even know how painful it was to deal with as a survivor way back when?
---
Same thing happened to me in a cannibal game i was going to give them hatch but they just kept wiggling so i just hooked them. Also they saw me walk PAST the hook.
---
Doctor, Distressing, BBQ, Beast of Prey, Brutal Strength. For me at least
---
I "agreed?" slightly up until you said Freddy was on Par/Better than Spirit the only killer in my opinion that the Spirit is on par or better than is the nurse (Yes I believe the Spirit is better than nurse)
---
The real question is why you're still crouch walking everywhere after that idiot set off every trap from the basement to that hook he died on.
---
Her MS doesn’t matter because you don’t chase with her, you place traps everywhere so the survivors have no where to go, allowing you to end chases quickly.
---
Flashlights only really work if your traps are at obvious places (not to mention that people don’t really bring flashlights, unless they’ve got DS too) and Urban Evasion counters it sure. Definitely not when you’re in a chase however. Yeah, still strong, in my opinion, which I stated it was.
---
Sexualise ALL the killers 
---
YES,  it is their normal behavior.  They're fucking white you numbskull.  Everyone is trying to figure out why they're *white*. 
---
He's a doctor, he's here to heal you
---
She looks so much cuter with her hair down. I love it
---
Just your friendly neighborhood doctor-man.
---
I 'm guessing it only (seems) worked because; he was only a bit off your leauge with all that whiff &amp; simply opening the wrong locker. You did your part too, you misplayed by entering to a locker which eventually ends by free grabbing.
---
They WOULDN'T have flown away if it was spies from the shadows.  A survivor would have set it off, therefore, it is not a bug from Spies with the Shadows.  It is a bug with the crows. 
---
ha ha ha, I do that...
---
that's like 50 fly life cycles bro smh
---
Is there anywhere in there where they say comms are intended?
---
They're tip-toeing around the issue and you fucking know it
---
I wish more killers were like this. 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IWINtUCshxY “Funny how? Funny like a Clown?” (From Goodfellas, yeah I know this is Godfather, I also thought of Crazy Joe Davola from Seinfeld)
---
Lol I did this exact thing with a clown in Haddonfield. I was doing the gen in the house and he was out on the roof shufflin in and out of view outside the window. 
---
I was doing the Mori daily on a character with no mori items. 
---
Well what did he say? 
---
You mean Xūr, the exotic trader that never gives you what you want
---
Foggy!
---
The tits look weird as hell and the face definitely does not jive with this at all.  
---
I do that when I'm sick of hags shit. I had a hag place 8 traps around a hooked survivor. Was that really necessary? Just face camp and get it over with, you're either going to do 1 of 2 things, teleport to a set off trap or run straight back to the unhooked survivor. And if you come back for the unhooked survivor I have to run anyway. 
---
Wait, what? Obsession icon moving indicates killer location?
---
On the plus side, if you can fix both of them, the killers gonna have a baaaad time tryin to get the last handful of gens
---
They just kept telling the clown to get his shinebox.
---
I knew someone would say this as soon as I typed it, i hate u 
---
The fact that it is Elmo makes this even more funny. 
---
We have enough killers belonging to the Apidae, we need more diversity. 
---
I think i forgot. I was just in awe of what happened
---
3 minutes? 
---
Yeah, that loser!
---
Hm, I wonder how good a 3 gen trapper would be. I’m rank 1 on Xbox playing 3 gen doc exclusively. 
---
This was from a while back, when I first got the game. I was going through my old video captures to see if I could trim them down and I found one where I was in the Levy Theatre. The killer was the Wraith and I was David.
---
Because I was still pretty new, I did not realize that the Wraith had taken a liking to me and was trying to help me do generators. I didn’t understand why he was hitting a generator multiple times while I watched next to a thrown down pallet.
---
Once the generators were done, he chased me for a good two minutes before downing me and bringing me to a gate. He spun around in circles while I got the gate open and after that, because I didn’t know how to say thank you at that time, I also spun in circles to say thanks.
---
It was an interesting game that round.
---
*proceeds to facecamp with leatherface*
---
The opened mouth is supposed to be a sacrifice to the entity and the skull is for death, whether by bleed out or mori. They've never really worked properly though
---
I expected a DC in the end. Would have been typical for that kind of player
---
Oh i think i get it
---
I just tested it and nothing happened, sure
---
Me too but ok
---
Is that a nippie I see?
---
Dr. Sam sounds pretty jealous
---
Atleast he can possibly stop survivors from vaulting or throwing down a palette. He also has better tracking and can make skill checks harder to hit for the rest of the game. Freddy has some tracking but not as good. He also doesn't have to wait 7 seconds to even try to hit, although doctor has to schock, it atleast does something.
---
It's one thing if the killer is 100% not coming to hook for whatever reason. But otherwise, I feel like I'm getting sandbagged if someone heals me under hook with low stack autodidact
---
Do you need a hug? That wasnt any expression I've ever heard. Sounded like a miserablely presumptuous blanket statement.

---
Go to the main hub on the subreddit. Top right hand corner. 
---
It’s not a matter of them being too strong, it’s just that a lot of people think they are annoying to go against. 
---
not really, they're honestly the worst killers due to how latency based the doctor's shock is and freddy is just freddy, easy to loop.
---
First match versus the Pig ever I thought it was Claudette with the red blazer on. Once I noticed the Pig stopped moving for a good second and did a double take did I realize her swine like face. Gave me a good jump scare, but did I ever learn.

If they gave Amanda different color jacket cosmetics, she would be a force to be reckoned against.

---
That’s not welcome in a school environment 
---
We already have a perk that shows Killer's aura every time you complete a gen. It fucking sucks.
---
Then you remain injured  
---
I'm sure you would toxic tough guy lol.  Players that feel they have to disrespect every opponent are too sad for words man.  Bet you run decisive crutch too lol.  I'm a god but I need a get out of jail free card for when you outplay me.
---
I like the new version. It allows us to hear the lower pitched notes better. I always hope to play in Haddonfield not only because it is my favorite map, but because I always enjoy hearing the song.
---
they grow a dick, the entity works in mysterious ways
---
I played against the same exact person before and they did this on the Clown’s map. Their team was getting slaughtered and they just hung out on the rock t-bagging and clicking their flashlight. No unhooking or anything. Just let their team die. 
---
When I eventually downed them, I let them bleed out on top of that rock. Of course, they DC’d right before they died. Absolute asshat. 
---
Lol at the "art experts" ripping this piece

Yup and after I messaged him he said I was teaming? OK I was just trying too do a doctor ritual and I have too deal with this it's sucks

He said I was lagging, that that's why he missed hits.

 "Lol me? A killer? Being Toxic? Never. How could you think such a thing? Next time I’ll make sure to let you escape buddy. :)"

play legion with no perks or addons or power
---
it's stupid and not fun at all but it sometimes still is fun. i do it from time to time for shits and giggles and believe it or not, sometimes i get a few kills. i don't know if that means that i'm good at killer or some survivors are tragically bad at the game. either way, give it a try if you want to just fuck about in the game. it might go horribly wrong but when you're playing legion like that, you know that you are not playing seriously and it doesn't piss you off as much.
---
I believe Noob is the only one out of the three to do that. He’s still a damn good survivor, but I don’t specifically remember Scott or Zubat deranking.
---
That video is fucking garbage. The guy is playing rank 10 players. He's not playing people who are using loops correctly or have Sprint Burst to get away. It's funny that whenever I play Legion, at Rank 1, as I chase one guy (maybe I stab one or two others before I focus on one) that's still enough time to get a gen done.
---
Let me recount a match I had: I have Ruin. Red Forest map. I find one guy and give chase, I have a Mori, the guy got a gen up to about 20%, there's another guy on the cancerous loop spot (you all know the one I'm talking about) and that gen was about 50%, another gen is done on the opposite side of the map, I chase this one guy and moonwalk, he DC's, the other guy on the cancer spot DC's, the last 2 just give up. They never got Ruin. I didn't get anyone hooked until they all just gave up. Now, you don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out that they easily could have gotten all the gens done or at the very least 2 gens done so last guy gets hatch.
---
But shit videos like this created by shitheads are used as concrete evidence (by other shitheads) that the character is broken. 
---
That perk got swapped out for Coagulation due to Distortion existing.
---
Just git gud nerd lol... but honestly you can’t let a few bad experiences ruin the game for you. Playing killers like spirit, huntress, nurse, billy require some skill but once you learn em you’ll have fun with them (at least from my experiences)
---
The crows will help you soon enough.
---
Yet again. How does your feelings about the current state of the game reflect the balance of the perk? 
---
I'm not looking for a discussion about current state or balance of the game, I want to know why NOED is being considered 'in the right place' by developers. As far as I know it is a crutch perk, a counter part to current Decisive strike which is going to change with the new patch. 
---
He's not it's because the last three gens were right next to each other so he's running up and down checking them and stupidly got in a locker right in the middle xD
---
A nerf I wouldn't wish upon anyone 
---
No Mans Sky was hilarious to see.
---
When is the tournament?

Ahh, you’re learning. Great job then
---
I play as survivor and killer, I am playing more killer because there's no way to get more bp, with Distressing and BBQ together are awesome \*.\*, anyway I think I have fun as killer when my guesses, strategies are right and I hit and get survivors according to my thoughts, for example: when I set a trap in places they couldn't imagine and they get caught, I feel so good lol, but other things with other killers too.
---
The thing I am working on is Achievements, I already did all survivor adepts and other achievements, now I am doing for all killers, and it feels so good when you get those hard achievements that you worked so hard facing many toxic swf :/
---
Another way to have fun in this game is making many builds, get your favorite perks and see if it works.
---
So thats actually real people treating PS messages, i thought it was bots that just ban accounts whenever theres a bad word in the chat
---
Maybe he's saying that Michael fucked THEM, but he hasn't fucked HIM yet
---
My favorite is when someone crouches to come save me and then runs immediately after the unhook. Really cool, guys.
---
nice

Treat the game as if perks are a want. Prestige when you can and just push through everything. Use a character’s teachables for a challenge.

---
It's not feelings that are defining the state of the game. And in order to talk about perk balance, the state of the game needs to be looked it.
---
Looking at the game itself, games can be over within five minutes and that is not based on feelings but facts. Survivors only need to do generators and survive that is facts. Killers need to hunt down four survivors in a full game, they need to guard hooks that survivors are on, they need to stall generator progress and they need to prevent hatch escapes if it comes to that. All facts. Not feelings.
---
NOED counters survivors only needing to do generators by giving them a reason to do something else. NOED fixes the issue with the game, and because of that it is in a good place. The game's state determines if a perk is overpowered or underpowered. Decisive strike is currently overpowered since it increases the duration of a chase which is bad since the game can go relatively fast. Adding a second objective for survivors that they need to do before they can leave would make some perks better and some worse. If a second objective was added DS in it's current state would be fine since the duration of the game is increased.
---
Idk man tell me when u find out 
---
Glad to see they still haven't fixed this shit.

Is this the murder boner perk?

OMGosh..second match someone DC'd while the camera was still circling the Killer in the beginning of the trial. Watch me, I'm LIVE this is crazy. [mixer.com/DarcShinobi](https://mixer.com/DarcShinobi) So the other three basically gave up. No chase points, three hooks, no deviousness or anything. Experience ruined for all.
---
I love using bond. They both have their perks (ha get it?) but I prefer bond more
---
His power is rape...jk :))
---
Nice icons bud 👀
---
One of my favorite things to do as Michael Myers in the end game when Survivors are at the gates is just to stand on one side of the gate and very slowly inch my vision into the gate. It's fun to watch the Survivors point at me as I pull a Halloween 1978 and poke my head out slightly from behind a bush.
---
Cool but her hair is supposed to be floating or whatever
---
&gt;Gate open! Me smell noobs inside!
---
Serious moment though if that Feng wasn't a potato she could've easily saved Jake with a blind.
---
Yea that was me xD
---
**B E E**
---
LFs are always like this or facecampers. No in-between
---
You're thinking of Deliverance in this case, however WGLF awards a token as soon as you complete the unhook action. It doesn't matter if the rescued survivor goes down instantly, as the game will still give you the token for a hook "rescue".
---
So people could ask me this question:D
---
I'd rather live a lie, as huntress is best killer
---
&gt; Seeing as I was the one talking with people, I think I’d know what was said. I also never once saw your name so im not entirely sure if you even took part.
---
I was there, just had a different name
---
&gt; It’s not about seeing the traps, it’s about knowing the good placements and playing around them. Once you’ve learned how the hag you are playing against plays she becomes somewhat easy to play against.
---
Bad hags for sure, you will be able to predict the trap placement eaisly. You probably haven't played against a good Hag, which isnt on you, its just that there are very few good Hags, much like there are very few Freddys who don't tunnel with double blocks. I'd recommend watching Space Coconut, he's an actual good Hag.
---
&gt; I mean this entire thing has been about no addons so kinda irrelevant?
---
Aight if we are talking about no addons, Spirits map pressure is kind of bad. She doesn't move fast at all in base, then you have to waddle around at 110% speed for 15 seconds.

&gt; Freddy is a stall killer who is bad at his own job
---
Thats not true 
---
&gt;  Aside from it being extremely easy to wake up
---
Thats not true, especially with dresses.
---
&gt;  Awake people can bodyblock for a 100% safe bodyblock because Freddy's aim will swipe into awake survivors. 
---
Kinda true, but not always
---
&gt; Survivors can get skillchecks during the dream transition and cancel it before it even finished.
---
Oh no half a second wasted darn 
---
&gt;  Let's not forget how there's literally nothing in Freddy's base kit for the chase at all
---
Oh no not like Freddy has a small stature and a foggy Dream world PLUS a deceptive lunge that mean that Freddy is the best killer for m1 mindgames.

and just imagine a silent hill themed map.
---
No template today, relatively basic photo
---
His face in the second shot was... difficult to match the original meme. Not as much control as I needed
---
But are they new? They have tier 3 meta perks.
---
you only commit the hook suicide once theres 4 gens left w 2 survs alive and youre both getting constantly chased
---
Lmao his hit box would be massive 
---
The only thing shocking does is wasting Doctor's time ;) Freddy has way better tracking, wtf, if you juggle survivors he has the best tracking in the game. 
---
Would be amazing. I always imagined one that looks like the Ski Lodge, but shifts between the fog and the darkness every few minutes. 
---
Eh even at that point you have hatch potential, depending on various factors

thanks
---
The game is DC worthy as survivor 
---
The SUPER (HOT) Chapter
---
of course it is
---
Thanks I made it myself
---
That's why it's two f's. Double respect for the sweater boi
---
There is no fun to be had in DBD.
---
&gt;Has no downsides
---
Aside from his 0 map pressure, 0 tracking, and only slightly better chase.
---
He’d fit right in, then. 
---
Bond is better
---
😂
---
I’d love to say you’re wrong but it’s true. Prolly just swing and hit anyone on the map
---
good thread
---
I haven't noticed an abundance of pallets 
---
I would love to have DWM and Lithe, but I haven't got Kate or Feng yet. I bought the licensed DLCs and I'm grinding up shards for others. 
---
Thank you tho! I love Iron Will and Quick and quiet.
---
Thank
---
I survived until the doors were open, and I’ve been given silver for much less than that. The sad thing is that I would have made it out if Feng Min wasn’t so dead set on unhooking me right in front of the killer. The other teammate that was alive had borrowed time and I could have escaped safely, but Feng had to have those WGLF stacks.
---

---
It's absolutely a basic mistake to slide across a pallet after tossing it when the Spirit isn't moving
---
I’m aware, but it would help to have Open Handed be used in at least ONE perk build
---
Bond.
---
Doctor deserves a high rank with how hard it is to lose him. Once he finds you, you're kinda guaranteed to be on the hook 
---
Run Iron Grasp.
---
Ohhhhh okay
---
And if I notice you not sliding, I’ll phase around and go for the smack. Some survivors wait a bit before sliding back over but multiple things can happen there. 
---
A) slide over immediately (not the best move)
---
B) wait a while, and then slide (hoping that she is phasing around to you) 
---
C) immediately run away and force her to break the pallet or move around (probably the best option depending on the kind of loop or pallet drop)
---
I’ve noticed good survivors make basic mistakes against Spirit, she’s unpredictable, unless she keeps making the same basic moves and mistakes. 
---
That would be nice lol so i guess its the devs being lazy then
---
I want no indication because sometimes the killer just thinks “Sabo Jake” if they can’t see a hook, and the killer would be rewarded for having that prior knowledge of the perk, an unskilled killer that doesn’t know about the perk’s effects shouldn’t have the same chance of instantly figuring out “they have boil over” as an experienced killer
---
I run it with We'll Make It. The only problem is so far is that most of my recent games have soft-camping killers in them who will literally make a b-line straight back to the unhooked person even if they were already chasing someone.
---
Atleast the hit boxes would make sense now with him in
---
Thats genuinely terrifying 
---
Bronze and silver are destined by a set time (5 and 8 minutes respectively) so you could die before 1 Gen gets done, but as long as it's after 8 minutes you'll get silver. You probably died at 7:58 or 7:59 into the match, just another second or two and you've gotten it. 
---
I'm with you on this. Is not scary in game per say, BUT thinking as a real killer, human killers are the scariest. No supernatural crap or deformed creature is scarier than a normal looking guy that kills without remorse, see Myers too.
---
HOn HOn HOn HOn EEEAAACHAGHAGH
---
I only want a SH killer for radio static replacing the heartbeat
---
I would be a salt mine if I was the killer
---
Best one so far 
---
I know it kinda is,but from the Resort you can see half of the map,and there is a million of mind games you can do there.
---
The place is also in the middle of the map,so if you protect that gen,it will always be closer to the last 2 ones.
---
And i personally really like the stethic of the place.
---
I agree with this statement, I was just thinking in my head “what is the best way to make the killer go to a further hook.”. Aura block numbers are strong, I was just imagining to perk Spies from the shadow’s distances.   It would make perks like Mad Grit, Agitation, and Iron Grasp more used perks however, I was also keeping in mind how one perk change can change many more perk’s necessity in perk builds
---
Oh no*
---
Focusing on just one survivor is probably the worst thing you can do as Freddy, unless a survivor is blatantly pulling survivors off the hook in front of his face and farming them all to death. 
---
Omg...I haven't thought about that. That's gold, good one.
---
_humming motheringly intensifies_
---
D  I  C  K
---
Exactly. I’d assume Freddy wanted to go get a gallon of milk late at night without the children’s glares and unwanted attention. But any sane person is undoubtably going to assume the worst when seeing a group of 16-19 year olds with serial killer masks and hunting knifes. It’s less that Freddy isn’t scary and more that he doesn’t wear a mask so it’s not obvious that he’s a killer and not just a deformed man. 
---
It's what I thought after a certain age would happen ... But you do you 
---
Fair. I think a lot of it is dependent on what's in the vicinity 
---
Imho I can't say much about Legion because of his weird state (Some say he's too powerful, others say he's too weak...) but I feel like Freddy's big issue is that you can get taken out of Dream State by healing. In high rank, everyone runs self care, and if all you have to do is purposefully miss a skill check with self care to snap out of dream state, there's no problems. You don't have to worry about finding a gen to blow up, or trying to find someone else in dream state. Imo take away the ability to snap out with Self Care (Perhaps instead do it where another survivor has to heal them/stab them).
---
I heard heretic and got my boltor loaded as fast as I could

---
Баю-баюшки-баю, не ложися на краю...
---
That is an amazing idea
---
If the new killer is gonna be a priest then this should be one of it's perks
---
at least small game should show how many totems are up
---
That usually means either a face camping killer or just a straight insta DC in ny experience...
---
The resort is so far from being mind game-able for killers. Almost all of the pallet spawns on it are ones you have no option but to break and god help you if they run BL
---
and that middle gen is *so easy to get done*
---
Or the zealot or fanatic one or the other
---
Buzz buzzy buzed
---
I remember all the hype and "OMG THIS WILL BRING BACK SABO!!!" posts that this perk made... yikes. Does anyone even use Jeff's perks?
---
Shouldn't have to give up a perk slot. It's a no from me.
---
you made me wheeze
---
Awww ... Awww
---
This is amazing thank you OP for blessing us with this 
---
So the game ended and they were all up for man’s ride with friends so I killed three of them
---
The game ended and they were four-man survive with friends so we killed three of them
---
Part of it is replacing the game’s Unreal blueprint hell with code which sounds like a time-consuming nightmare. But I don’t know anything about programming, so maybe not
---
You need to press RB
---
The gen rushed so fucking hard
---
All I know is that if the killer is male its little nickname has to be "the altar boi"
---
Well, this is a follow-up to [this](https://i.redd.it/cbv3z5j3ua911.gif), so maybe you'll find out ;)
---
If i remember correctly they said they wont directly ban you but if the anti cheat system picks it up then they wont help
---
I missed no hatchets today in straight two rounds ,I will admit there was no crazy long blind head shots but as a baby huntress it was big deal for me and ended the game in only 2 gen done .. 
---
I am happy and I had no add-ons too
---
Yeah it was even punishment 
---
6000 BP, do you mean 7000?
---
Looking forward to seeing some more of your amazing work!
---
0_o that siren in the movie gets me everytime! Good looking out, I thought predator would make a great killer but this definitely tops it. Let’s cross our fingers.
---
This makes me feel weird and sad
---
All I did was change a couple of pictures it’s not game breaking, or hacking :/ it doesn’t effect anyone either.
---
IDK youd have to ask, hes changed his nickname.
---
Cursed
---
I know I mean because the killer keeps going infront of me when I'm about to
---
Thank you 
---
(Removes tear which is dribbling down my eyes )
---
Thank you for this 
---
It's been a long time since I've been called out for ESP... I kind of miss it.
---
Silly newbies
---
EAC doesn't care tho, if it finds it and bans it, the devs wont help. I agree tho, they do look better.
---
I'm never trusting these rats and their bullshit lies again
---
If it makes you feel any better, when I see this I essentially let the unhooked person get away and down the one who farmed
---
BHVR don't mind if you do this, but they won't help you if the EAC catchs you.
---
Your rank is stored locally on your computer and can be edited
---
Those are awesome. I'd love to do this if we can confirm nothing will happen
---
I can imagine we both saw the same thing first.
---
So a Nurse head that can't fit through any door or window?
---
Perfection.
---
Did you see my earlier post as Pyramid Head being a potential killer or is it a coincidence that you posted about too?
---
This is amazing
---
When people say they're a korean gamer but you don't know If they're good a survior or a camper
---
And no ruin. You are really a hero.
---
I would love to join but i cant hear you over the jet engine in my room... Oh wait thats my ps4 starting up DBD
---
your welcome sir, I live to please
---
Luck or not, no better feeling than landing some far Huntress shot. 
---
I managed to sacrifice 4 friends and one of them flamed me after the game, ironically the weakest runner. While I've gotten 4 sacrifices before, this felt much harder than usual because the moment I turned away and head for my BBQ targets someone would unhook and run away.
---
They couldn't even find my ruin and finished only 2 generators. 
---
The bad english hate mail after the game was the cherry.
---
Glad you liked it
---
*laughs in doctor*
---
Lery's belongs in balanced.  That shit sucks for survivors ever since they reworked the window spawns a while back.  The rooms are mostly open now so you can't window loop nearly as effectively.  There never was many pallets on the map but it was awesome because of how cheesy the windows were.  Now it still doesn't have many pallets and the windows are gone too.  There are only a couple legit good loops on the entire map at this point.
---
Add in there some more details if you may, mix it up :D (suggestions from other users and me)
---
1. Instead of heartbeat as PH approaches there's the radio static getting more and more intense
---
2. Just like Freddy has the dream world, PH can pull survivors in the alternate map - you can hear the siren right before the map shifts to the alternate version, maybe that's where PH gets stronger
---
And last but not least...the metal scraping sound when he moves around.
---
I’m doing the same thing right now, I’ve also got 7000 shards saved up so I can get blood points from the shrine as well. 
---
Run monitor &amp; abuse will help prevent survivors to find you. Run predator and bloodhound and you will never lose track of a survivor again. 
---
Storing 1million blood points to spend on the new dlc
---
sweet! will check it out, thanks for the link!
---
oh
---
/r/notinteresting
---
Love this.
---
New killer from chapter 11 “The Cock” 
---
Oh, and Mori: lift up survivors and pull the skin off them.
---
"I have adrenaline, you noob! Why waste 4 seconds healing with WGLF, when we can do these three remaining gens so I can get healed for fr- and I'm down again."
---
Power: the clap, with every step your cock slaps against your leg making a clap noise, the closer you are to a survivor the slower their action and movement speed.
---
It's less than worthless, my boy!
---
That's the trade off. Legion is easier than Nurse but has no map control and it takes a while for a Survivor to go down.
---
Maybe you should git gud and adapt to Legion rather than cry on social media? 
---
How long does it take you to get this much BP? As someone with 1.4k hours in-game since launch I am curious how long it takes for different people. 
---
shhhhh, shhhhh, I'm here, I'm here
---
what do you think spies from the shadows does?
---
MORE
---
Geez I wonder what the add ons are. 
---
Yeah I messed that up lol
---
I understand that they're white but the spies from the shadows talk has been confusing me
---
This sounds like "The Crusher" idea that was scrapped during development.
---
It would take me two sessions 
---
I thoroughly enjoy aftercare.
---
Why does Jake look like a shinobi from the hidden mist with a tragic backstory
---
Because edgy = good
---
Now this is SHITPOSTING
---
What the fuck is this trash
---
Thanks they're pretty good but take a while to complete
---
His mori would be skinning someone bare handed
---
“The likes little bois” if he’s a priest
---
max of three inches? think all that murder might be some pent up anger from daddy myers :/
---
They should make it 100% louder in the next patch. Please
---
Give this Bing Bong boy a hug.
---
I can totally understand the frustration - 1 perk becomes obsolete instantly.
---
&gt;stall
---
For one missed skillcheck. You will get more stall out of Thana.
---
&gt;Stealth
---
Sort off. He is hard to keep track of but once again, 7 seconds, so it really is only helpful for finding people before a chase and that's it.
---
&gt;Good M1 mindgames.
---
That are mandatory, and easy to deal with if there is a pallet or window nearby. Many times i would have rather just hit them.
---
&gt;Can easily leave a chase
---
Yeah but then he is back to square one like everyone else who leaves a chase.
---
&gt;Map pressure is a meme
---
No it is not.
---
&gt;Tracking is not as good as chasing.
---
It's really good when done right.
---
His bottles also slow him down after he throws them.
---
These are major downsides not minor oversights. Without map pressure or a game stall mechanic you cannot counter gen rushing no matter how good of a chaser you are.
---
The real guessing game is the passive phasing at window vaults.  Killer shack I'm looking at you.  Is she vaulting the window or is she faking it?  I find that I play her very well at pallets it's the shack and T-walls I have a harder time with.
---
The main problem that people have is that they dont have fun against legion. They should complain about that since games are supposed to be fun
---
Both of the asylum maps are very much survivor sided. Easy runs around the main buildings even without balanced landing.
---
Can you give me a link? Sounds interesting 
---
I can imagine, but I definitely enjoy seeing what you'll make next :) will you be making survivors as well?

Most Likely xd
---
That one day must have been so traumatizing, it's why her story is so well written. Great art uWu
---
The only killers with "map pressure" are hillbilly (on a good map) and nurse. That's it. Maybe hag on a claustrophobic map.
---
Tracking is good when done right, but other then certain addons it hasn't been done right, and good tracking will never be as good as good chasing. Never.
---
His bottles only slow him if you hold them, you shouldn't do that.
---
The best counter to gen rushing is putting people on hooks as fast as possible. Hooked people cannot do gens, dead people cannot do gens, people trying to save others on the hook cannot do gens. There is a reason the best killers in the game are the ones with the shortest chases.
---

---
Drawn on paper, edited in Photoshop.
---
Upcoming but.. NNNOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Shoulda just slowly gotten out as he started to walk away
---
I love this game actually. 
---
When a teammate is being chased do gens
---
Dont be afraid to sprint around at the beginning and throughout the match
---
Map pressure means nothing when you cannot back it up with good chasing. The top tier characters you mentioned are in the top tiers for other reasons. And I don't know what world has Huntress, Pig and Freddy in the top tiers.
---
Tracking and map pressure are nice to have, but someone with good game sense and experience does not need them. The only time tracking is really good is when there is one survivor left.
---
Fucking hilarious. Im subbing
---
I'm begining to wonder if the mods here have died.
---
So much non toxicity
---
It hurts
---
IT HUUUIIRTS
---
32 meters uh...
---
Perk build makes a big difference. Work on getting important teachables unlocked. 
---
On the game? I've seen that too. Easiest game of my life. A full patrol on all 7 gens takes like a minute or two, tops.
---
Imagine your mom walking through the door right when the hag moris you
---
What perks fo you recommend?
---
It’s the entitled man children with big egos who think they are better than everyone else and blames everyone else when they lose
---
They act like they are God’s when they win but get hissy when they lose and blames the killer
---
ITS SHITHEAD

why?

Just give them a 'gg' reply or if you can...ignore them. All they want and wait for is a reaction from you. Besides, whoever writes that kind of a message cannot be older than 16. Just be the bigger person and let thw kids have their 'fun'.

whats wrong with that UwU

I love you please make more

Wat.

Ehm uh OwO nothing my good sir. Its just kind of  L          O          N          G
---
If there is Hex: Ruin, do a quick scan. To do so, either go search a place that commonly spawns a Totem or go to a Generator since totems have a thing for most of the time spawning next to Generators. If there isn’t the Hex Totem, it is more likely wise to just burn through the Generator you looked at as there is a chance another Survivor is also doing a quick scan 50+ meters from you and found the Hex Totem. 
---
Also periodically look behind you when getting chased. You need to know if the Killer is still chasing you or trying to ambush you.
---
After Kratos and Atreus, Anna and... ?
---
The best tip is just to keep playing. This is a game where playing it is really the best way of getting better. Check out a couple of streamers or youtubers if you want a basis of how the game is played.
---
For killer, try them all until you find one you like. Don't be afraid of not getting kills in the beginning. Get the Cannibal and unlock his BBQ+Chili perk ASAP, because it gives double bloodpoints. 
---
For survivor, learning chases is the most important thing. Which, again, will happen with experience. Before starting a gen, look around for an exit in case the killer comes around, whether it be a pallet or a window. Try and level David King and unlock We're Gonna Live Forever. Again, it gives double bloodpoints.
---
Ultimately, get as many bloodpoints as you can. Perks are incredibly important and you can only unlock them with bloodpoints. There's a lot of things about builds for survivor and killer. Try and pick a couple that you think look interesting and work towards unlocking those specific perks in your bloodwebs. 
---
Thanks! I think Together Forever could use some numbers tweaking for sure, and probably a detachment from Terror Radius to discourage stealth killers hook camping the obsession and so on. Possession maybe lasts too long but it's kinda useless if it's too short, and I don't see any issues with Repentance.
---
Fuck Nurse and Legion and fuck whoever designed them
---
Idk dude, since when is a guy being shirtless automatically gay? If you see a shirtless dude and start thinking about gay folks, that's something going on with you.
---
*INTENSE MOTHERLY HUMMING*
---
Oh, so you are telling me freddy's power stalls after they have missed a skillcheck? Because not being able to interrupt people on gens while being a "stall" character is not a good look.
---
You keep saying 7 seconds fedora man bad, but it really is true. You cannot convince me the world is flat by saying "durr round earth".
---
In a chase he has no more mindgames then any other killer. Him being short can help sometimes, i'll give you that. But you have no special power to help you deal with a pallet. 
---
The guy who you aren't chasing and asleep is just about to wake up 90% of the time. And then what happens when you go over to start another chase? 7 seconds fedora man bad.
---
Watch the whole r/TheEricAndreShow . This guy is a pinnacle of humor.
---
Probably saving for new keeler
---
Ehhh it still helps a lot more than ot hurts 
---
Also THANK YOU for getting the hands right...I always imagined her mother to have developed hard working digits!
---
I will, and I have been
---
Survivor perks for newer players: self-care, bond/empathy/alert, deliverance, balanced landing/sprint burst, urban evasion.
---
Killer: Hex:Ruin, Nurse's Calling, Bbq and Chili are 3 of the best
---
That really good! You really have a talent!
---
Upgrade David King first, get dead hard and We’re gonna live forever (both David’s perks)
---
While playing Claudette - For self care.
---
So play Claudette, unlock both of David’s perks and then get those 2 on Claudette.
---
That way you have Self care, We’re gonna live forever (WGLF for short) and Dead hard (best exhaustion perk in the game in my opinion.
---
It will be hard at first to master dead hard and you may think it’s shit, but once you learn how to loop pallets and you know all the maps, dead hard becomes a must have (for me at least)
---
As for WGLF, this is the most important perk for beginners, it allows you to gain double bloodpoints EVERY MATCH! You’ll be swimming in bloodpoints if you play well and it is very important. It also teaches you not to be a coward in this game and be more altruistic, so just rescue from hooks and you’re good :)
---
Good luck.
---
Thats why its a perk, it buffs your wiener 
---
Well thats my Steam
---
 I even got a paint letherface as my profilepic xD
---
I play on Xbox too, so I feel you on a lot of your complaints. I play both sides. Basically, I play survivor with friends, so that helps. And I also like doing challenges on survivor like random perk wheels and such. Also, I'm an achievement hunter, so I've been going for the unhook yourself 50 times achievement and been messing about with different deliverance builds, so achievements are good motivation for me. 
---
For killer, I admit, I prefer some meme builds. My personal favorite is totem protector. I run it mostly on Spirit but it can work on Hillbilly, Doctor, Huntress, Hag, or Nurse. As one would expect, all totems, including Thrill of the Hunt. Try and snag them off the totems. Random perk wheels are much more irritating on killer imo, so I don't frequently do them, but it's worth it to try and see if you like it. Some enjoy the challenge. Basically, I just keep trying new builds, and seeing what I like to play. Try looking up Monto, a lot of his builds are fun to try. 
---
But hey, there's going to be a new killer coming out soon, so you can have some fun trying them in a couple weeks. That, or hey, take a break from the game, ~~play Civ 5.~~ I've stepped away from the game for a few weeks and come back feeling refreshed and loving the game again. (It does help if rank reset happens in those few weeks so then you have a couple chill games before returning to higher ranks.)
---
This was on xbox
---
So, I'm assuming you're on PC. I play on PS4 and when I play killer I just have my messages set to private so no one can message me. But on PC, don't you close the end game chat once you leave the match? Why not leave without reading the end game chat?
---
Honestly hate survivors right now.
---
Decided to prestige my spirit so I spent my 5 moris.
---
Every. Single. Game. They either all dc or they instantly gave up and teabagged me and laughed in post game chat for wasting a mori. I didn't get any good games...
---
Just play survivor it's right there 
---
I love this game. It's my favorite game since Ninja Gaiden II. I rarely complain about perks or balance. Only thing that gets under my skin game wise are the ridiculous rate gens can get finished and playing extremely well only to have the last two survivors escape through the hatch because they found a key in a chest (literally happened to me 3 games in a row one night). What I absolutely hate about this game is a majority of the players. If someone escapes, they're at the exits tbagging or holding up th game instead of leaving. If you win you're a "try hard". 
---
Earlier today, I'm practicing Nurse on my PS4 (I'm ranked 1 on Xbox). Only perk worth a damn is a Tier 2 Nurses calling. No gens done, one guy tbags. Fine, you obviously want my attention. I don't tunnel or camp, but I give this guy my undivided attention since it's what he wanted. I'm downing and hooking everyone left and right. Tbagger is on his final hook, I'm chasing someone else, he ends up walking right in front of me. So I knock him down, he quits, two others also quit. 3 man SWF, and this guy begins with the stupid, overused lingo the DBD community has killed. Every other message was "try hard" "toxic" and "toxic try hard".  I let the last guy finish two gens and take the hatch. But in my experience, there are a TON of players like the rage quitting SWF. They saw they couldn't bully the rank 13/level 30 Nurse and we're getting absolutely demolished, so they quit. Had they escaped, I guarantee they'd all be waiting at the exit tbagging or clicking their flashlight.
---
Is spies from the shadows a good perk?
---
I used to run whispers but it confused me at times, especially on smaller maps like that clinic or the meat packing warehouse.
---
I am running BBQ and Chilly 2, Bitter Murmur 2, Hex: ruin 3 and hex: no one escapes death 1 on Leatherface. 
---
Why on earth does it make you sad that someone doesn’t spend their blood points right away 
---
i know the devs said they wanted the trophy to be hard, but yeah you actually have to throw to get it
---
I'd say about camping that camping isn't that simple. They do tunnelings more, out of terror radius, let them hook, and chase the blood.
---
And thats how 'Cover' is a thing in Korea, they go to aggro once in a while and block killer and get hit so aggro can rest for a term.
---
That works cuz killers gotta chace the one already got hooked once or twice.
---
fuck u noob git gud
---
I like it bc it’s an easy hook if someone is screwing around on the outskirts of the map
---
In case you forgot, they released data that said killers get something around 2.5 kills across all ranks per game. That was around a year ago and killers have pretty much only gotten buffs since then. 
---
They might feel weaker but the fact is that they are the favored ones right now. 
---
Oh also, what helped me a lot is playing as the other side (only if you ars a beginner) after a few matches you will know how they play. Idk if this worked for other people but it helped me learning how to play survivor.
---
I got called wallhacks once because a survivor grunted in to a locker on the other side of the wall I was at. I picked the locker closest to the wall I was by and he was there.
---
Since I picked the right locker, it was hacks.
---
Play legion
---
trash is king here
---
I hate getting 3 immersed Urban evaders on my team who self care in the corner of the map, go down fast in chase, don't take agros, etc. 
---
Like I get playing stealthy is fun for you somehow, but can you please learn how to run the killer. Cuz y'all at red ranks and it's kinda sad.
---
It’s like they don’t realize we have ears
---
My guess is the cultist
---
TBH, these should have a NSFW tag. Just a suggestion. Yeah, it's not anything visual, but I wouldn't read erotica at work.
---
The main building is bad I agree, but the rest of the map is decent, with few pallets.
---
I don't hate that it was nerfed, that's whatever. I hate that it got nerfed into the fucking ground. 
---
Well he'd not really sing it all through next to the hooked survivor he'll be far enough to not sing and then come back when unhooked.
---
In that way you can avoid thing called 'Cover' Which is getting hit once in a while instead of letting aggro die who got hooked already
---
I play both sides, i'm currently prestiging all characters (killers and survivors), decided to prestige survivors first since they don't really need perks/add ons (items). But yeah, if i want quick bloodpoints i just play Nurse with BBQ.
---
Mm, juicy reports and denied survival.
---
LMAODO
---
NOED is a waste of a perk slot.
---
*laughs in huntress*
---
Should of been clown :/
---
Just by the thumbnail, don’t run unrelenting. It is one of the worst killer perks around. I would also say no distressing, but it is good on doc
---
I think there's parts of every game that will be boring to one party, but makes it fun for the other. Sitting on the hook and waiting to be saved isn't fun as a survivor, but it's nice for the killer. Looking for UE'ing survivors isn't very fun for killers (especially when they're the last survivor and won't leave) but it's fun as a survivor when you're using it with the killer right in your sight. 
---
I love how Michael is stalking in the background of the second photo. Great work. 
---
By chasing doesn't matter as much, I meant a standard 115% M1 killer with a normal lunge.
---
I mean, you clearly dont pick killers that are very good. So can the really kill survivors?
---
The left side should be slighly more visible and we should be able to see another dwight in there lmao
---
Don't worry about pipping to a lower rank until you're good (or feel good at playing). Everyone has different play styles. Learning to win chases is all in what the killer has for perks and how good they are at chasing. You'll learn that some killers CAN NOT chase without finding scratch marks to lead them (corn fields can be great places to lose the killer by gaining distance and then walking away or crouching away).   
---
Something I didn't know as a new player that I wish I knew - fast vaulting through windows and fast entering lockers can alert the killer even when not in chase. If you want to be \*that person\* to cause diversions so that other people don't get caught, you can, but be ready to hide somewhere else or get chased.  
---
When you are hooked, don't immediately attempt escape. Give your teammates time to come to you. If you are solo playing, it might take a bit if your team is not heavily altruistic, or until they see someone else is being chased (hit specifically) and sometimes downed. 
---
At the beginning of the match, if you find yourself right in front of a hexed totem, you can either take it out right then or you can wait until the killer comes by and leaves to make sure you don't get caught. There is a high chance most killers will go and "check on" their totem. I have had better matches where I wait until the killer comes by and leaves to take it out, usually by that time they are chasing someone else or on the other side of the map. After that, leave the area to another gen to do. Hopefully it wasn't Haunted Grounds lol
---
Can’t confirm nothing will happen. No one can. Even bhvr said that if you got auto banned they won’t help. But if it’s any consolation I’ve been using custom perks, icons, items, and addons for a few months now.
---
Urban Evasion pushes survivors to go around the map crouching, wasting so much time. It's almost only useful against Hag/Huntress tbh, most of the time it does nothing.
---
Total bullshit about the praying in basement. I’m sure they’re smart enough to notice that if someone had huntress’s perks they would be super op
---
Sucks that your totem broke, but Hex Ruin is just so boring, let me sell you on some of that good Third Seal and Devour Hope. (And cue absolute misunderstanding and failure of a joke)
---
Thanks so much!!! and yes, she’s my favorite because of her origins!! So much pain :’)
---
With Freddy the goatttttt
---
can someone explain what this is happening tho
---
Thanks I hate it cause now I have a face I can put to the woman getting impaled by an elk.
---
Yeah you’re right lol
---
find out who their dad is and fuck him, they’re always so mad when they find out 
---
);
---
Yeah lol I just always tend to do well on ormond. Idk why
---
wtf this is so good
---
At that time I was running it because I was whiffing a lot of hits.
---
Remove that carrot, COWARD
---
xd I clicked on the link XD
---
why the carrot 😡 i needa see dwights Carrot
---
It's obviously not about that. It about "Your vault speed is reduced by 60 seconds."
---
The base vault speed for killers is 1.7 seconds. So, if you reduce that by 60 seconds, then it becomes -58.3 seconds.
---
I was gonna stick around to say gg but I’m gonna stop doing that it usually leads to this
---
does the smile in the title looks like a RAGE to you ?
---
Killer is farming. You can let him hit you, heal up, then get hit again.  
---
Recently prestiged my main claude so i had no good perks. Just her 3 then adrenaline. So days just play way to heavily against me
---
Not gonna deal with obvious bait.
---
i always think the killer lags out bc me and a friend were in a match just messing around for like 10 mins and they didnt even move. its happened twice
---
Really, it should make everyone sad that those little bits of electric code that result in an in game currency that are now lost in the vast void of data and programming and can not be brought back are wasted now. How can you not be sad at the lack of consideration to the blood points that were made to be spent are now just floating in the netherworld of technology?
---
&gt;You really are unintelligent aren't you?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Now get used to being wrong, it's going to happen to you a lot I feel.
---
What's with the insults?
---
&gt;Killers can't win if they don't hunt down survivors. Killers can't win if they don't hook survivors. Killers need to prevent survivors from doing generators or they will leave.
---
I didn't know that, thanks.
---
&gt;And after that RNG and skill determines how games go.  Survivors have the advantage because they have the ability to rush the game when RNG favors them.
---
What RNG? You mean skill of players you go up against?  So NOED fixes your lack of skill by giving you a free kill or two, got it.
---
Dead hard gives you 2-3 seconds of additional breathing room to get to a pallet or window if the killer swings, the direct counter - which by the way does not require you to go out of your way, is to bait dead hard out the next time you chase the same survivor. What's wrong with self-care?
---
&gt;But the difference is those perks work the whole trial and not at the very end
---
Because they are not crutch which are meant to get them out of a pickle if they're bad.
---
&gt;Killers don't have perks that can help if RNG hurts them at the start because nothing works until after a gen has been completed and by then they are already hurting.
---
Yet again, what RNG? Didn't you say there is RNG on both sides? So how is it hurting when one of five generators got done? Heard about Ruin before?
---
&gt;I can't tell you how many times I had a game as a survivor because RNG was in my favor and I got one or two gens done before the killer found me.
---
OK. Now I am certain when you refer to RNG you actually mean skill.
---
&gt;​I play both sides, while you probably only play survivor. I know what's good and what's bad, and at the end of the day the worst thing for both sides is how much RNG there is. Player spawning, generator spawning, totem spawning, bloodweb, map design and more. Killers are hurt the most though because their is only one of them.
---
Yup [https://imgur.com/a/sXCbsUP](https://imgur.com/a/sXCbsUP) survivor main, me. All P3 killers have all the perks currently available. 
---
&gt; NOED makes up for some of that crappy RNG and the lack of objectives for survivors.
---
You just admitted you lack skill and need that NOED for compensation. No objectivity from you whatsoever. 
---
You just know Michael ain't stalking but watching the aftermath of locking all Closets in the Map.
---
I think a ton of people don’t know wtf this perk is. They always sprint burst right off the hook. Fuck’em. I’ll fix this other guy mid chase instead. Lol
---
Obvious bait lmao its a teaching server for all killers and survivors. Dont join then if you want to keep your head in the sand
---
The problem is, it's damn easy to wake up. Freddy's on enough of a time limit as a killer in general, nevermind he's Freddy. 7 seconds is a big problem, especially since the dream transition does exactly nothing in stopping survivors from doing pretty much anything during it.

You crouch at 100%, that's not wasting time. I evaded so many killers with it. I have three games recorded today where i only survived because of it.
---
[Check rank 1 or rank 15.](https://youtu.be/3KquFZYi6L0)
---
I proudly support this! Thank you 
---
Dude, the zealot is the best idea for this new killer I've heard so far. 
---
Time to get a VPN
---
Or just stop crouching around and grow a sack
---
Hmm, how do people say thank you now ?
---
What purpose did you have in responding to me with this? Like literally the second comment on that page says: just because SWF may have been intended, being on voice comms was not. ***Stop trying to justify voice comms in a game that was specifically designed to not be used with voice comms***.
---
you cant divide a country by asking for diversity in video games lol
---
Zealot seems fitting since it’s blindingly serving n evil deity
---
[the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aww3o4/perk_idea_1/) 
---
I’ve seen from others that they usually do a slow crouch, not spamming the button, and sometimes they’ll leave their items in front of the killer. I’ve also seen others crouch in front of the killer and move their camera up and down, so it moves the character’s head in those directions.
---
This happens a lot. The killer does this the whole round. I think it’s a glitch 
---
I see. What I like to do is nod once or twice slowly
---
If he didn't move at all and was only swinging, then it was probably a farm bot. 
---
That’s the best the way to do it, I agree. Or be a newbie like me and just spin around lol
---
It's two syllables, fits what we know so far, gives a general idea of the killer's character and sounds cool. 
---
Well that sucks
---
zzz lol xD
---
That sounds funny though. Might try it sometime weee
---
Lol I played a game last night against a 4 person swf. Killed all 4 of them and was showered with compliments and positivity. I was in shock. 
---
Delete this nephew
---
Nope.
---
Yeah that's why he'sjealous
---
"ggez you dumb killer!"
---
how was that?
---
I thought this was Monster Hunter fan art first.. 
---
Ohhh. Same wants Mike's shape.
---
True, it is only fun if everyone is getting stuff from it. I played a match though where it was just me and one other person against a Wraith and all he would do it slug the Dwight, I would go heal, run - he would slug the Dwight again! I would go back, heal, run - it was over and over again until he came for me, hooked me and Dwight died on the ground in front of me from bleeding out. I actually thought that was a pretty fun match just from the sheer absurdity from it. 
---
Not sure the cosmetics exist in the *lore* 
---
Petition to have this added to the store. 
---
Saya the guy calling himself Lordofthefags69
---
Nvm then. Why did you leave Tutorial Entity?
---
Yes. Ever since they buffed this perk it’s CRAZY GOOD. No longer 75% chance perk. If they scare a bird, you know exactly where they are and are going. 
---
That is, if you are on a map with birds. Lol
---
Treatment Theater is the best map for this perk. 
---
GIVEN YOUR NSFW HISTORY ON REDDIT, THIS SEEMS LIKE A PERSONAL PROBLEM 👀 
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
Mini hunty is 100% palico
---
Yep
---
Why?
---
Also, I like to keep my server list trimmed down to servers I know I'll actually talk in, and I didn't feel like I was going to talk in there. Besides that, I don't really need to learn about other killers, and I'm fine as a survivor.
---
That’s David’s chest. You’ve lied one too many times, worm.
---
I actually use Ruin for Hag and Trapper. Even if it lasts only thirty seconds, that's thirty seconds of setup time, which is valuable. I can usually get at least two or three pallets trapped for free and I can trap the totem too if it lasts long enough or I spawn next to it. Too unreliable for other killers though, except maybe All Totems Spirit.
---
Play with your food, most certainly **does not**, spark any joy. 
---
I actually just had a match with the killer Farming. In the lobby screen, the killer will ready/unready at a steady pace. That usually means he will be swinging away. So you can bring perks or items to help earn the points faster. Although I was fooled once thinking the killer was going to farm and brought all the wrong perks to a slaughter. 
---
But that's what I mean, if you just wanna survive alone that's a legitimate reason, but if you want to be time efficient, running is way better.
---
Watch them in Dwight
---
I’ve had this happen twice with a Legion and  doctor. The difference between the two is that the Legion was able to move from their spot once or three times even after swinging in their feral frenzy.
---
I don’t know why that happens, but someone did mention a farm bot so maybe? I don’t know why the Legion moved while the Doctor didn’t.
---
It sucks. Just rush the gens, destroy the totems and bail.
---
You're right, actually. The basement's lit up red, like the killer's FoV, but there's no heartbeat. My bad.
---
I used to use Urban Evasion, then I realized it was just slowing me down. I went to other perks instead, for a stealthy yet speedy build.
---
Dailies can be a pain for killers you haven't leveled. Its unfortunate some players don't know the difference between a killer trying to kill and a killer just trying to get everyone drunk on clown juice.
---
Its not just about learning, its a discussion server as well. Theres a Freddy mains there, with over 2000 hours, who know that he isnt a bad killer. Try having a discussion with them.
---
Bruh, look who made this and look at the tag. 
---
I loled. 
---
Thank you for your insightful and enlightening feedback. 
---
ahh ok sorry, not sure what it was before it was a meme :&gt;
---
No problem, it's what I live for!
---
It's not Freddy being bad as himself, it's that he's extremely easily abusable and there's nothing he can do about it at this point in time. Anybody who plays Freddy will tell you that. Stop saying I'm bad just because I'm bringing up points.
---
When I first started playing, every time I saw the killer I shift-tabbed out of the game. I could barely get past the tutorial 
---
That’s basically what happened to me. I kept getting slugged and every time the Claudette got me up I got downed again. He just had to hook me one more time to sacrifice me but he just wouldn’t do it and the Claudette wouldn’t let me die either xD
---
this is the epic meme you wanted a coldwind offering for? lel
---
I'm actually sad fake pallets no longer show up as a bright yellow image anymore. One of the most satisfying things as Doc was surveying the map at the end of a match and seeing just how many pallets you burned through during the game.
---
Because you don't just have all 4 people to look for totems have 2 gen rushing detectives 1 toxic Dwight to be chased and 1 invisible Claudette to look for totems
---
I'm not feeling the face. Very nice art though.
---

---
pretty sure it doesn’t work if you escape through the hatch.
---
I’m pretty sure the red icon is for when you’re using a tombstone or tombstone piece and you can Moro people
---
Even though that's theoretically strictly better for Freddy, it could be a nerf.  I tend to get lots of value as Freddy from survivors who try to abuse the dream transition time instead of just running away. Survivors being able to heal/repair/unhook during the dream transition gives them the opportunity to make more mistakes, instead of being forced to make the more optimal play of denying that first free hit.  Of course there are times where they complete the generator in front of you, or unhook near an open gate and you can't stop it, but in most situations it just saves Freddy time/let's Freddy apply more pressure faster.  He can struggle to protect totems though, and it's probably a good exchange early game for the survivor to trade 1 hit for finishing Ruin.  No killer can truly protect a hex totem that well though, and at least sometimes Freddy gets a grab from it due to survivor greed/trying to abuse the dream transition. 
---
Back in the day this was very common, they use a program that keeps them always hitting
---
is the new Killer there?
---
Would've been a waste. Most survivors I've tried to mori leave the game. 
---
One time I was playing as Michael and I just stood there, still, and loaded up his skills—just staring at them. And I let them keep doing it for a while. Then I lunged and got one of them on the floor, dragged them off to the hook. Everybody else fled through the gate after that. Moral of the story: be careful with your t-bagging. 😂
---
Is
---
Hm? has the PTB already been released? wth 
---
As soon as I saw this buff, I threw it on my doctor. You just can’t hide from him on smaller maps. BBQ for stacks. Whispers and spies. Top it of with Rancor. 
---
I read this and was like "it's ok, it got a giggle out of me" but then I read the quote on the bottom and it broke me lol
---
I think you meant, 32 ***METERS*** UHHHHHHHH
---
Just a tip for how i do it, as you rotste from gen to gen and spot dulls, do them on the way.
---
Or even better, when near a gen or hook and killer is still hanging around do a dull then while you wait.
---
I got accused of hacks when I slugged a survivor to get another, I hooked the other guy and used bbq to get the slugged one. He claimed I was hacking, and I pointed out I had bbq. He said he had distortion despite it explicitly saying it didn’t fire if you’re in the dying state.
---
Nice :D
---
Don't worry, you'll get another soon enough. I got about 6 on the way to level 50

Not everyone realizes that when you're unhooked by we'll make it the icon shows up next to your perks. So they just assume it's a waste of time or it's too risky.

What did you change about perks, items and addons?

Id do Stake Out. Stake out is good for survivor against hex ruin. Unless your getting tunneled

It's a good idea to play both. I've started playing a lot more survivor (am currently farming adept achievements. 3 left!)

Excellent! Thank you :)

put this on r/expanddong

NURSE! I HAVE GENS TO DO TOMORROW. DONT MAKE ME DECISIVE STRIKE YOU!
---
Tgey were never alive to begin with
---
I have been learning nurse on PC. I expected to get my ass handed to me for a while, but what I didn't realize was how quick the games would go without being able to create actual map pressure or use ruin. The time I had in matches didn't always seem like enough to really work on building the muscle memory for blinks. I had a broken lobby that only loaded two survivors in the match. I found one and hooked him. Both of them figured out pretty quick that I just wanted two hooks each and let them do gens and give one trap door. While they were healing or working on gens, I was able to blink around and get a lot of good practice blinking exactly where I want to go. I'm not a great nurse yet, but I've gotten much better at blinking where I intend to because of that match. We stayed long enough that we all got some decent blood points out of it and the post game chat was as fun and friendly as I've seen in the game in a while!
---
Well I am a rank 15 killer. I don’t play it as much
---
Sadly don’t have them
---
Thanks :)
---
*mmmm that lunge*
---
That happened to me as I was trying to heal someone. 
---
because you are trash
---
Me in 90% of survivor games
---
Background: When the Pig hooked me, my game froze sort of like how it freezes when you disconnect. I watched Dwight run past into a wall so I was just waiting for my game to drop. And then it all resumed and I couldn't do anything except hang there. My health never went down but the other survivors couldn't unhook me.
---
I stayed to see what would happen when the gens were completed but my adrenaline didn't proc. I ended up disconnecting and everyone in endgame chat was basically ?????.
---
Is this a known glitch?
---
Nice. But then there are games when you last ally dies and your first hook goes immediately into struggle. Rip
---
Then you deserve no salt
---
Oh, yes, the dreaded OP power to have the icon in the menu for the hag be a frog.
---
Lol, yeah it's kinda hard to hit survivors with analog sticks when the 360.  I'm assuming the "trash" insult is a way to get around the tos agreement regarding harrasment?

There is no better feeling then kicking a gen with PGtW, downing a survivor, and immediately re-kicking the same gen. Bonus points if you can get a 99% gen regressed to 0 in a match.
