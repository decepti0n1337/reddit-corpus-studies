I thought it was. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

---
---
Dodge this game
---

---
Devs dont care and will just sell you fixes to problems as perks
---
Revert the pallet amount? To what?
---
Changing two perks into one means you have to come up with more perks. 
---
You‚Äôd be fucking queue times up by removing SWF of 4. 
---
The buff you want LF to have is probably too ridiculous and unrealistic. 
---
As someone very critical of the design team, you‚Äôre not much better yourself. Stop crying. The game is at its most balanced point in the years it‚Äôs been out. 
---
Maybe you wont. 
---
Toxic. 
---
I've never had much problems with bugs on console but it seems to me they're starting to get really bad. Had a meg float to the ceiling when she started working on a gen with me in a game earlier and dead hard keeps literally sticking me into walls if I dead hard into one by accident.
---
The first one sounds like Legion haha *and myself* 
---
*gasp* dbd x cuphead confirmed?!!!! 
---
Played huntress the other day to do a daily and even with bloodhound I could hardly even see fresh scratches/blood. It was not a fun match.
---
Stuff like that yes. I mostly just meant perks. Maybe make the other killers items blue and yours red. Add more totem spawns aswell. 
---
Might even be worth having 2-3 mins in lobby to figure out builds and have a way to see the other persons build.
---
For more balance, make some perks limited. Like only 1 killer can use noed or only 3-4 survivors can use adrenaline or whatever. You get what im saying lol. Itd be a really fun mode.
---
Her grunts from getting hit are pretty funny too lol
---
It's in the itemaddons folder in steam files, who knows if it's unused though.
---
God I wish there was a season 4 :'(
---
Downing someone with a chainsaw on your first sprint of the match is one of the most satisfying feelings in the game
---
Groovy
---
People doing dailies? People trying out Nurse? I haven't played many matches as her and while I can control blinks somewhat well, I can't for the life of me blink through objects. The timing is awful and certain props you can't even go through.
---
Yeah definitely, The devs might fuck it up though but I‚Äôd still play it.
---
"Or the Trapper and Hag."
---
**Small Game notification never shuts up**
---
Some of them would make good killers ü§î
---
In general, Killer needs more practice to get into, since you have to have good game sense and stay aggressive and on people, but is definitely easier at Rank 10-20.
---
 Survivor usually gets easier around Rank 10-1, since your team can power through the gens (and sometimes even ignore Hex: Ruin) and manage healing and unhooks well, giving the killer less time to build momentum and get all 3 hooks on everyone.
---
It is definitely unused as of now. There are a few other dummy perk icons in the folders there from basically the release of the game. 
---
Time will tell
---
What's with the level 58?
---
The Neet
---
‚ÄúLoneliness is his friend‚Äù
---
Less survivors in the radius the better is he 
---
Great for late game 
---
GG and enjoy! Keep practising and you'll see improvements. There's a lot of streams and YT videos to help you but for the time I would say to just enjoy the feeling for that after some time its gonna fade. Lol didn't mean to sound depressing. Anyway, gg
---
Legion: Origins
---
What are you planning you ~~handsome boi~~ evil monster
---
Shirzless Myers turns your evil inside out ;)
---
It'd be a dumpster fire. Id also play.
---
You guys still wouldnt be happy. 
---
Das a bubba, billy's ability icon doesn't have the woosh effects on the blade of the chainsaw
---
If your goal when playing games is to piss somebody off, you‚Äôre a loser. 
---
It completely fucks over killers like Wraith and Freddy, who have absolutely no counter to this perk whatsoever, other than ignoring their obsession and hoping to God that none of the other survivors have it (you know, exactly like old DS...). 
---
This movie was kinda weird. 
---
I think it‚Äôs because both Drag Race‚Äôs and DBD‚Äôs subreddits have such great shitposts - really funny and clever and lazy and creative memes. So it‚Äôs quite a coincidence when users from both (or at least fans) happen to visit both subreddits. I‚Äôm gay and I love DBD. I‚Äôm gay and I love RPDR. I love them both. :)
---
&gt;Nurse can bypass this because if she blink M1s this DOES NOT count as a stack which is understandable as there is a different score event 
---
This one is confirmed a bug, it should work on Nurse blink attacks. 
---
That being said, while it's not confirmed, it might also be a bug when other M1 attacks don't apply (like spirit and Freddy too I've heard)
---
Does The Neet reee when pallet stunned? 
---
I thought it was funny
---
Just had it on PS4, constant wiggle meter throughout the whole game. It even persisted through being hooked.
---
It is destiny - your next cosplay is PHOENIX DWIGHT
---
I played as clown the other night. Before i wasnt good with him but his smokey glass bottles are the bees nees. I played against a clown only 2 times in 200 hours. 
---
It makes me tickled when I'm survivor
---
Yeah man, like detention and trapple and stuff, but indeed! Time will tell! 
---
I believe that a misleading video made the rounds claiming that the clown is a powerless killer.
---
It's all bullshit. The person that made the video has no idea how the clown works outside a vacuum. 
---
Orgasms 
---
Nope, don‚Äôt use it after I got the adept achievement
---
You‚Äôre welcome!!! We are pretty proud of what we‚Äôve made and can‚Äôt wait for what‚Äôs coming next!!
---
^_^   thats flipping hilarious
---
Anyone one who says it‚Äôs worse than DS is completely full of it, popular streamers be damned. Old DS was good against everyone whereas MoM is almost useless against half the killers. 
---
The perk is fine. Killers are just salty. Not that it matters, they‚Äôll still run NOED and down you. And then write an essay to justify NOED. 
---
Honestly Legion should have been a killer that enables ‚ÄúKill with friends‚Äù Mode.  A mode where multiple killers can do their job and kill with their friends.
---
It is broken against m1-only killers. 
---
Actually SWF with two killers would be about fair lol 
---
I love you
---
You're so fucking toxic, you're the reason most killers dc
---
Damn sorry it was an offer im not begging its if somebody wants to then they can its up to them
---
Right but i'm not saying that though xD so that's why i was questioning it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Ds buff lmao
---
That's an intense new Claudette skin.
---
I know... I‚Äôm agreeing with you. This is what OTHERS are saying. 
---
People like you are the reason this community sucks. Boo fckn hoo. A few more pallets.
---
you can mind game legion with iron will, Legion don't see  scratch marks  
---
Those without calm spirit shall not pass!
---
If you think it's unfair as a survivor to play against a killer who uses NOED, Ruin, tunnels, or camps, then you're just bad.
---
This is too wholesome for this subreddit.
---
‚ÄúIf you need to play survive with friends you‚Äôre just bad.‚Äù 
---
See how this logic works both ways? Survive with friends groups are noticeably more difficult than ransoms and it‚Äôs not unreasonable that killers don‚Äôt want an unfair challenge. 
---
Cry about it. It‚Äôs easy as shit to be a killer 
---
Pallet change was 100% needed. Maps like The Game or Shelter woods had nearly no pallets on them unless rng blessed survivors. I do think that the game is still survivor sided except against top tier killers, but there still needs to be enough pallets that they won‚Äôt all be used in the first 2 minutes.
---
That requires Legion to be legally blind.
---
He‚Äôs actually probably my favorite.  I haven‚Äôt played him in a while, though, as I want to unlock all the Killer perks. I think I‚Äôve only played against a Clown once or twice and have only ever been hit by a bottle once. 
---
I chock it up to his lack of cosmetics. He has fewer recolors than anyone else and they cost twice as much for some reason. Everything else is premium or super expensive. 
---
It‚Äôs a perk that really good but it‚Äôs only good against the weaker killers.
---
man I sure am glad this is in the news category, real breaking news stuff here stop the presses everybody because this guys got the news
---
Scrub killers thinking it‚Äôs a SWF loading in, allot of little kids getting on around that time too!
---
OP‚Äôs SWF team just got manhandled? Or another reason for this post?
---
Ahegao pretty much
---
Only reason is I just see people complaining about SWF
---
Same I had this happen with a trapper and hag! I was like well that was a lose lose match! 
---
One time i virgos shrouded and spawned in his terror radius god has forsaken me
---
Really dope huntress
---
lol she looks so cute. And that myers its just badass!
---
Trick or treat studios.  [https://www.trickortreatstudios.com/halloween-2018-michael-myers-mask.html](https://www.trickortreatstudios.com/halloween-2018-michael-myers-mask.html) 
---
It doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs a visual error in the end game screens.
---
Aren‚Äôt you the same guy crying because they raised the minimum number of pallets to 8?
---
;-;
---
I wish there was emotes in dead by daylight 
---
It depends, I have a rough idea of the time to wiggle out, if I know I can't reach a hook I just drop the survivor 
---
Know, eye donut believe that was two much. Noting outlet the ordinary here. 
---
he looked pretty horrified when i took his flashlight though
---
As a killer, I find it relatively easy to pip and I'm at rank 1 so safety pips and pips do the same for me now. I have a more rough time getting pips as a survivor is q much more stressful task because its almost up to randomness if you get to participate enough in each category 
---
&gt; Survicors dont use fountain
---
Cool so now everyone is super easy to see and get 1-hit
---
&gt; Im rank 3
---
Now you're just trolling
---
Absolutely not.
---
Imo Nea with black pixie bob and skirt and the red biker jacket looks the best aside from feng mini's trapper mask costume
---
Puking on non-sick hooked survivors is an easy way to make them sick. Only, is only gaim, y u heff to be mad? 4Head
---
Where the hell are the pajamas?
---
Tinkerer would‚Äôve came in clutch 
---
The Mist + Supermarket Map?
---
I‚Äôm getting Haggar from Voltron vibes from this :D
---
Don't see how it's unfair considering most killer perks are op and totally unfair and the fact they have unbelievably dumb hit boxes but okay.
---
YASSSSSS QUEEN make that trash camping cunt work for it!
---
the name "THe Nurse" is misleading, as gameplay wise it has no meaning
---
They have so many map issues already I doubt their code is even remotely encapsulated. If you merged two maps together you'd probably get something that looks like dali's melting clock.
---
Don't get me wrong I wish there was a bunch of different game modes like L4D2 but we'll probably never get a serious update until they remake the game from the ground up.
---
Looks to me like he's just salty he died and you survived 
---
You need to have 1 more gen finished than you do remaining survivors. So for the whole team to escape out the hatch with a key, you actually need all 5 gens done. 
---
Just like you, miserable till the end of time.
---
I have fun playing him and against
---
But one thing is broken the moonwalk.  
---
Devs have to remove that 
---
The game back then was super broken but damn do I agree with this one. I found this game a little late 
---
It's still around, actually. How the hell "Ghost" is a *common* add-on given how ridiculously good it is is beyond me. Running it with Coxcombed turns Wraith into a fucking Ninja. It's fun as hell on indoor maps. 
---
But, wait. Someone questioned you for *not* having Insidious?! 
---
If you don't have a certain dlc, it is possible to get splinters in bloodwebs.
---
What can I say? Can't shut my mouth.

That's an assumption. My deal is people get good perks for killers and survivors and get them nerfed. Go through my dbd history man. That's what I complain about. Not because I'm miserable. I'm assuming you are projecting your feelings onto me. 
---
It's because survivor mains are entitled af. They were heavily catered to for the first 18 months of the game's lifespan, and once the devs started to balance the game (nerfing survivors) they raged so hard they review bombed the game's steam page.
---
sitting holding m2 all game then instantly killing everyone without them being able to much isn‚Äôt pip worthy imo
---
upvote for including the ochido video
---
Really? So 3 could get out with a key and 3 survivors with one gen left? 
---
Possibly. I still think Legion's pretty weak and doesn't deserve the hate. 
---
Besides, I adore Wraith, and Freddy's pretty awesome to have around. Hurts to say that they're at the bottom of any tier list. 
---
r/NuclearRevenge
---
Very cool! Just started playing her today and she is a challenge, but I know I'll get better. Keep up the good work! :)
---
That one scary movie clip ‚ÄúJUST DIE ALREADY BITCH‚Äù
---
[removed]
---
I agree too. Survivors can‚Äôt run that fast
---
I mean yeah, but two still got out. Oh wait, it's in spectate. So no, they didn't. 
---
Fair and balanced ^^^landing
---
It‚Äôs just the opposite with me, and I‚Äôm not sure if it is just my playstlye, but a couple of my buddies have the same issue as me. I figure it‚Äôs just because if you main one side as opposed to the other it will obviously be a bit harder to pip as a side you‚Äôre not quite used to.
---
I don't have DLC. I got this same offering in my Wraith bloodweb when I first started playing but I haven't used it yet.
---
This was like 2 minutes in the game and no gens were done. I'm pretty sure they died but I didn't spectate
---
you‚Äôre a moron
---
The problem is that making a new game mode for a killer is unrealistic. Other than that, neat idea. I'm not sure how anyone even could translate a "4 in 1" killer into this game. 
---
(Cough) Oversaturated Content (Cough) 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he gets a rework in the near future, he is essentially just a worse Huntress. I still enjoy playing him and don‚Äôt find his power awful.
---
Ooooh. Can picture it now. Dry as ever. 
---
Use hiding perks. Or get better at hiding.
---
‚ÄúNow tell them I‚Äôm pretty‚Äù
---
Whats a Hex Totem 
---
Omg! I jumped when I saw it.
---
no
---
Lol sent it to my friends and they were like ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù 
---
Adds 13 chain blinks
---
Yep, if you're even alive and standing on the hatch spawn location you'll hear it but can't interact/see it until you move off of it and back onto it. It refuses to spawn when there would be a collision. That kate is preventing it, as she can't move off.
---
It looks like you‚Äôre playing this on a gameboy. Why does your quality look like shite?
---
USE FRANKLIN'S AND MAKE THEM PAY
---
I've kobe'd twice without deliverance. Ypu basically have to be willing to die to try it.

Find them first. Let someone else have fun at little expense to your own. All that cool stuff.

D:
---
Why do they need to be human? All because of the coding? 
---
I can also just let them lie on the floor and look for the last without any Stress 
---
Shit, I didn‚Äôt know someone would of gotten this triggered by something so stupid. Get nae naed liberal
---
Yes, someone understands. I dont understand why people think its fun to slug survivors and have them lay on the ground for 3 minutes just to get a 4k.
---
Wow so your opinion won‚Äôt ever matter. 
---
This invite isnt working?
---
Hence why i asked if you must or if its just for being polite...
---
I shed a tear every time someone calls her ugly, shes the best female in the roster for me :^)
---
First it wont load
---
Second alone in a room vs dbd not the same scenario. All animals can do anyways is bite and scratch, not much room for creativity 
---
Itd be wrong if I didnt.
---
‚ÄúZombrex, stuff makes you loopy for a hour... speaking of... got any?‚Äù 
---
It‚Äôs an alien though, not an animal 
---
&gt;This game is highly competitive for many people, and you will be bullied by some jerks, yes, but i've never seen high rank players being proud of winning against newbies.
---
I have and boy was it sad. -.
---
Legacy 3 Billy against me and my all rank 20 team  (back when you could still depip to rank 20 if you didn't play survivor after a reset) guy was really toxic. -. That in mind now you can't depip to that level anymore and newbies are safer'ish to these people. 
---
Finally she's helping! 
---
Ash: "I'm interested"
---
Xenomorphs shoot acid and stab, congrats it's the plague with a knife
---
RNG seems to not favor you these days
---
Equally original comment.. Very witty. üòÇ 
---
Yeah, assuming the game started as 4. I don‚Äôt think it counts people who don‚Äôt load in at all.
---
I agree and think she has pretty eyes.
---
You are just that bad at the game and have no morals. It‚Äôs a video game you filth.
---
sorry bud. it's been a long day
---
But its haunted grounds
---
Ghost is still around, but it only works for 6 seconds while allowing you to move. The old Ghost was basically Insidious. Stand still, uncloak, Insidious (exactly the same as the perk). 
---
...stopping people from unhooking isn‚Äôt camping?
---
k
---
bet you‚Äôre the type of guy to say new DS is op
---
Ok, but you‚Äôre straying from you‚Äôre original point of a non humanoid killer would just be lame and not scary which just plain isn‚Äôt true past your opinion.
---
Yeah. I was an uncloaked wraith, so they expected me to have Insidious because sneaky sneaky. 
---
You usually do not pip without escaping. 
---
They're bots, and botting is bannable, so just report them.
---
I think that was me. Was it the Halloween skin,a carter's notes calm add-on, and a cornfield map? Did everyone have over 20,000k points? 
---
Ace and Hag? David and Huntress? Kate and Clown? Even before the spirit came out the only Original characters that had any sort of relation with each other to be released was Nea and Nurse through the asylum and arguably Feng and Doc with that Chinese doctor who uses electrotherapy on people game addictions.
---
Kindred should be baseline apart of the game, but god forbid solo survivors get buffed. 
---
Ok that actually made me laugh 
---
Ive had just 3 load in it always starts with 4 gens. 
---
&gt;What‚Äôs in it for these people that do this?
---
Bloodpoints
---
I main nurse and hag, so I'm pretty confident in my abilities to catch up to survivors and down them. I trust in my phantasm trap placements 
---
*That moment when you are opening the exit gate while injured but still have mettle of man and the killer thinks they got yo ass*
---
I don't have a Hag, but I do enjoy some Trapper. Getting them to fall into a trap you randomly left at the beginning of the match feels heavenly
---
"You guyths want sum mewnshyyn?"
---
Love this art.
---
I have no idea what‚Äôs going on here. 
---
Look at the right person on the generator, very. Closely.
---
I love when a survivor accidentally trips a hag trap and gets super spooked when I'm all of a sudden behind them 
---
*P3 Claudettes be like* I prefer immersed lmao
---
Adding to the original post, third emperor of Rome, Caligula wanted to apoint his horse, Incitatus as an ambassitor of Rome.
---
Bonus: there are also some accounts stating Caligula tormented his high ranking senators by making them run miles in front of his chariot.
---
Oh Jesus. Lol. Thank you. 
---
Listen... that‚Äôs the beauty of this. Nobody cares if you buy it or not lol. 
---
They will continue to play the way they want, with 0 thought or care about what you think. 
---
And stop acting like this game is an mlg competition, it‚Äôs impossible to please everyone no matter how you play. So it doesn‚Äôt matter at all how the other players feel imo. I‚Äôve heard some absurd complaints in this game lol

---
I found this on google
---
Rank 30
---
I didnt know jumping in the hatch was so fun.
---
Maybe? Nobody wants a hatch stand off because its a shitty mechanic on BOTH ends.
---
Or. 
---
Maybe the killer wants to pip because the recent system is poop.
---
If you haven‚Äôt downed a survivor after 1 minute and you see that they‚Äôre still in safe areas, it‚Äôs best to leave them. Sometimes you can tell it they‚Äôre going to be a problem immediately.
---
Every damn time 
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Oh, right. (Facepalm) I call myself a Legacy player. Maybe my memory's going...
---
Either way, it's actually better now, then. WRAITH CAN NOW PERFORM NINJITSU 
---
Yeah, the fan wikia says she‚Äôs based on the wendigo but I was thinking it could be part of the design choices for her.
---
Lisa seems to be a real mix of things. I mean essentially She‚Äôs a witch who likely lived in the bayou, was half eaten alive, used her magic as revenge, ate her captors and essentially became a wendigo. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that was some inspo for her Her model and name 
---
Very interesting, i think some of the perks could use a a little nerf as its just a little bit too powerful. But otherwise a very interesting idea. And one id love to. Play with and against
---
DC
---
With the new pipping system? No.
---
She is str√∂ng Scandinavian Skateboard girl, i give applause. Take my Upvote.
---
I should run franklins more lol
---
A garrot wire but you cant swing it. 
---
Thanks for being nice about it, and yeah they might need a nerf
---
ya so
---
Nothing
---
Wait you read it that fast damn
---
sorry
---
I think in a few ways the scoring system may be broken. The other day I played a survivor game. I did 3 gens, searched a chest and opened an exit. Two people got hooked and I never saved or healed anyone or got involved in a chase. I got iridescent in everything except chaser I got gold. 
---
lol how would 2 killers vs 6 survivors be even remotely balanced given the base game?
---
They did it before they changed pipping. I assume that they just want to kill everyone. 
---
This is facts. I mean how is it worth it to extend the game for another 20 minutes just to get one more kill
---
Killers should get no sympathy. It's always a trick. I probably would Bing bonged at them so they slowly ran closer and then on the second bell hit not turn completely invisible and give em a good smack
---
More trailer park memes!
---
It was an idea they talked about during a Q and A some time ago. The idea is to make kindred baseline because at the time, they were thinking about ways to help solo survivors more. Similar to were they eventually shown who the Obsession was to all survivors and if they were being chased due to the icon moving.
---
Although based on a Chinese man, the character of Herman was American so we really only have 1 killer and survivor link lol
---
Isnt that the point of the game? The hatch is the only reason the slugging happens. To go as far as to say someone "sucks because they want to play the game a specific way" is pretty weak.
---
Indeed my friend, its a really interesting idea
---
Proceed to teabag on survivor during mori. 
---
I mean maybe to op it sucks but its not like i dont get it i just dont do it. 
---
It's sorta strange. He's clearly ACTUALLY at least somewhat over the top given he fuckin destroyed his room after an off-stream LoL session, but there's so much that he does that's just him being hilarious. The T1 Magic Show showed that the dude legitimately oozes charisma though.
---
Sometimes I really hate this subreddit
---
Mending with an rbt on. Sounds like a ball hahaha
---
Hate toxic people. It‚Äôs just a game like chill you won one match way to go. Lol if I see him in abt my killer matches I‚Äôll make sure to face camp him for you. 
---
I do it to an extent. Ill slug for a min or two. But ill just pick em up if I cant find the other guy. Or ill slug if theyve been cunts, which lets be honest, we all do lol.
---
Jesus, if designing a game is as easy as you make it sound Dead By Daylight would already be great. I honestly don't think you understand how designing games works, or how designing anything in general works.
---
Not to mention the "increase in pallets" increased the minimum to 8. Which meant that there could have been less than 8 pallets on a map at once. 
---
Calm the fuck down. The devs already have to deal with the stress of designing this game, they don't need your unhelpful whining.
---
Mending...or removing the bear trap...
---
Make your choice
---
Damn I ain‚Äôt reading this essay
---
the point is that people aren't happy with the ds change. so instead of using ds, they use dc
---
Please make a Tl;DR

I still get these on console because I bought some killers with tokens instead of buying the DLC directly. They suck because you get no perks or add-ons. Waste of space in the bloodweb.
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
when you finish a match and the first screen that pop up is your total points including bonus bp from things like bloody party streamers, escape cakes, survivor pudding etc
---
Haha thanks!
---
Ok read a bit of the end and how stupid are you? You do realise Thrill Of The Hunt is a hex that tells you when totems are being worked on right? Like so much didn‚Äôt make sense to me
---
I see you‚Äôre a Claudette main lol
---
indeed
---
Its definitely a good idea. And one that id love to see in the game, honestly ive seen a lot of these but if i heard this was coming out id be super hype
---
Not just that why would Deerstalker stop you from recovering to full!? (95%) like what?

---
Not if killers choose powers that cover each others weakness. How about doctor+nurse? Doctor uses his zap to reveal survivor's location and then nurse blinks right next to them.
---
Now I‚Äôm just imagining what all the survivors moris would look like
---
I would honestly much rather have the devs focus on reworking all the low tier perks (both survivor and killer) than to add a new chapter. Of course I would love a new chapter but they can hold it off until after they finish reworking perks. Especially the base survivor perks,liteally the only ones I can think of that are worth running are We'll make it,Spine chill and kindred (since it got buffed).
---
If one person dcs I play super nicely, more than normally. If two DC then I just give the other two the game. I wont give anyone hatch unless they did really well the entire game and didn't get caught until the end 
---
With a damn mocking username and everything...

Sadly no

That's a double take.

Ty! &lt;3 
---
Even the best nurse players can‚Äôt consistently do well or even decent against the best SWF‚Äôs. 
---
Killer lead me to the hatch today. Today was a good day.
---
Playing 1 of the several killers in the game is not a reasonable or viable way of suggesting that all forms of SWF are fair. You‚Äôre acting childish if you truly think that. 
---
No then they aren‚Äôt a good nurse 
---
This can only happen with a glitch that takes ages to do
---
I only give Hatch if I feel like it. At no other time. 
---
Dwight: Grabs his victim and smashes their heads in with locker doors.
---
David: Takes off his shirt and fistacuffs to death.
---
Claudette: Tbags so fast she creates a nuclear explosion
---
Jake: uses a sabo'd hook to slit his victims throat
---
Adam: Grounds his victim and throws stones at them to death
---
Jane: sits on her victim ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Killers need to go on dates also! Nothing says romance than some murder and chill. It‚Äôs a good way to ‚Äúhangout‚Äù 
---
Make it so the killers aren‚Äôt allowed to be the same. You would have to have at least 10 survivors though. 
---
You're about to be downed by a raging Billy, but are suddenly saved as he's instadowned by a misaimed hatchet from across the map.
---
Nope she was in that locker the entire time he was on the hook 
---
There's a pretty good add on to combat disarming which injures the survivors. But I can't remember how common it is.
---
Yes
---
It's the bloody coil (an ultra rare add-on). And it only affects healthy survivors - not injured.
---
Killer mains are whiny, incompetent bitches - exhibit #6495
---
Get it if u level a survivor up the first 1 should be David for were going to live forever 
---
Moris*, can't use 's for plurals.
---
Mikeys buldge needs to be at least twice as big lul 
---
I started off by 1st watching others play and what everything meant. Than went in to the game with at least some tips and tricks. With the new match system you will sometimes get matched with say me as a rank 15 killer going against rank 8-9 survivors is sometimes frustrating. Lol. Also encounter a ton more swf teams. Getting teabagged a ton more also. 
---
absurd level of survivor entitlement going on here
---
You must be a low rank or console player because the doctor is a JOKE 
---
Actually the most attractive character in the game.
---
Inb4 muh daddy Myers hehe
---
Freddy could sleep the other killers and then molest them in his big boiler room.
---
You can have superior aim that could make you seem like a descendant of Shroud but nope a macro counters it all
---
Seena match on YouTube with a Myers who had a Nurse somehow join his game. It was hilarious.
---
Ace: Shoots victim to death with finger guns
---
Didn‚Äôt even know it was a thing when I started. I would be the last survivor and get beat down, killer just walks me to the hatch and drops me on top of it. I do the same now when I‚Äôm the killer if I feel like I was tunneling or camping. Or make them crawl to it following me, only for them to disconnect at some point ;)
---
Wow, givin Batman a run for his money as World's Greatest Detectice, /u/JudeNarukami
---
Thank you I'll correct myself next time
---
It‚Äôs either you slug, or wait 20 minutes until that immersed claudette finds the hatch
---
If Freddy‚Äôs lullaby scaled with his terror radius, then Insidious would make him unstoppable
---
Oof yeah like The 2v8 mode in identity V
---
You do don't like that idea, and I can understand that. However, what drove me to suggest bear traps being unable to be disarmed was the fact that being able to disarm his traps means you can disable his power. None of the other killers have that. Yes, there are counters to all killers, but none of their powers can be completely disabled by a survivor.
---
Never played it.
---
Doc:‚ÄùI see my prey...walking through the grass, this is what we call:‚ÄôThe Oblivious Nea within the roots.‚Äô Watch as I regulate my lungs to prepare myself for a shot on her head.‚Äô
---
You say that like you read the fork knife subreddit with the daily remove the fun thing you just added to the game posts. :&lt;
---
The spacing and all that really messed up for me, maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a mobile user 
---
&gt; I'm like rank 9 getting matched with fuckin 20s 
---
You answered your own question.
---
It's just the matchmaking system being wacky. I'm Rank 5 Killer and I'll consistently face people from Ranks 8-20. It's total nonsense.
---
Lmao imagine waiting that long! This post was made by the Xbox gang
---
Nah I‚Äôm kidding but yea matchmaking for survivors is horrible, I say that since I play killer and don‚Äôt experience the same thing
---
Get rid of bbq for rancor and monitor for blood warden. Nasty build either way lol.
---
It‚Äôs really fun because in the end everyone can buy flare guns and start an American revolution right at the gate, unless the hunter has excitement 
---
Statistically thinking since there are like an average of 4 survivors in a game to one killer woulden't there be a higher chance for a survivor to dc than a killer?
---
They could've been lag switching.
---
Honestly Self Care isn't even that good of a perk anymore.  It wastes so much time ever since the nerf to healing speed.  Better off getting heals from others anyway or just bring a medkit.
---
First let's keep this discussion civil with valid arguments.
---
I think both are viable strategy's because like it or not they work and I don't see the issues with them.
---
There will always be that one player who is incompetent and will screw over the whole team so camping is viable it may be annoying and unfun to deal with but so is looping which to me is just as annoying that's just my opinion though I can't speak for everyone else.
---
Don't worry, if they have a pump shotgun you can ~~fly into their walls~~ ~~sword their walls~~ ~~do explosive damage through their walls~~ ~~SMG their walls~~ ~~minigun their walls~~ have a pump shotgun and hope you click first.
---
Yeah, I hate jumping to "they're hacking" but it seems like every other match someone is hacking lmao :,) 
---
So if the trapper puts you in the basement and traps all 3 entrances, someone has to get stuck? Sounds pretty messed up. But on the off chance someone has sabo or a tool box its fine. You dont see how messed up this is?
---
he really walks with determination
---
Chuck off red paint brush and put on something like Class Photo. The speed decrease really hurts you
---
Id rather spend my money on stuff that matters, like $10 pants for a character I like.
---
Jokes aside ill check it out.
---
when i noticed that his hips sway in treatment mode and carrying a survivor i‚Äôve never been the same....
---
"You motherfuckering kids pallet looped me for the last time."
---
Oof good luck and prepare for one of the longest tutorials of all time 
---
It's really up to you, if you're having fun and enjoying it then keep on going
---
Yeah been having a lot of problems recently. I don't like to bitch, I know the devs are trying but the more posts and attention the issues get hopefully the more the devs will focus on them. 
---
What criteria lol
---
So you'd rather the killer pretty much give them a free escape LOL of course. Idk what I expect from survivor mains anymore. Y'all literally complain about the killer doing their job, but when killer mains complain about the hatch, gen rushing, etc., (which are legitimate issues) your response is "lol git gud baby killer"
---
Weird flex lol.  Quick do the same loadout on a Frqnks Mixtape Legion and then a 4 Blink Nurse and post those too.
---
Oh god nurse I full potato. Legion on the other hand...
---
there are hackers in the game but i rarely see them last one i saw was about a week ago and they were running like they had sprint burst 100% of the time
---
Console?
---
Ps4 player here, got a twitchy and i was playing as plague, not a high leveled on at that had some basic perks. He disconnects, than another one, than another one. And then the last survivor, a Claudette. I let her get out and we farmed and then he messaged me and said "Im streaming" and i told him that he dc'd, which in my opinion is worse than farming. Not only that but he dc'd on stream, and complained about me farming. Idk about you, but i wouldnt like to here a whiny twitchy complaining that were farming when he just dc'd
---
How is stealth out of the question isn't that their main gimmick except when playing against doctor with the whole third person view they have?
---
Also aren't you supposed to tunnel the obsession when using dying light since you have to kill them quickly?
---
How tho? It shares a name with a disliked killer and they have literally nothing else in common
---
I'm gonna go give a thumbs down to Texas Chainsaw Massacre because Leatherface is in it and he's a toxic camping baby killer lmao comedy gold
---
I like Clown, and his power is strong and fun to use, but it feels less interesting than others. Other killers have a part of their power that affects the chase, and a part that affects the rest of the game. Or they don't have the chase part. Wraith makes you have to watch out for his cloak, Doc makes you deal with madness, Nurse and Hillbilly make you worry about them crossing the map in an instant. Clown's all chase though, his power in no way affects survivors he's not chasing, and that makes him feel a little less interesting.

Yeah, it is a bug
---
Please don't listen to these people telling you to get it. It wastes so much time, it would be better if you went through a chest or find other people. As a killer main, you should know how good it feels to find a meg self caring in the corner of the map from BBQ or Nurses. Imagine being their teammate? Or being the person to waste time self caring when you could be finishing a gen
---
 I recently bought DBD today on steam and booted it up thinking it would run just fine only to find out on low settings AND ultra setting it runs 40-50fps which is insane as i have a 1070 ti and i7 8700. Has this always been a thing and is there a way to fix it or is it just my pc. 
---
Lol u didn't read the entire sentence, I said "If u were already seen then stealth is out of the question" meaning if the killer sees u and starts chasing u, there's no way to be steathly, that is unless u somehow get out of their sight/lose them.
---
As for the tunneling do to Dying Light, yes I understand tunning/camping THEN but not everyone uses that perk, I see that perk once every like 15 games.
---
How can you make these dbd meme formats?
---
Meg be looking like hiding the pain, Harold. Also, Jeff looks hella cute
---
As a trapper main I'm telling you unequivocally having traps that can't be disarmed without a perk or item is a horrible idea.  You could literally take away the most important pallets and windows on a map for the duration of the game in theory.  That would be broken.  I wouldn't mind seeing him get a little love but what you're suggesting is insanely op.  All he needs is to have the brown bag added to his base kit so he can always hold a minimum of 2 traps.  Do that and I feel he would finally be viable across the ranks without addons.
---
There‚Äôs a disgusting amount of homophobia in this thread. Really sad to see. 
---
i have nights where it happens to me every single match until i give up. i'm more cursed. not exaggerating btw
---
Its not only a console thing its happened on pc
---
Pardon me, but fuck that shit.
---
We really don't need another dude in a mask with a knife do we?
---
Damn, I haven‚Äôt seen it on pc yet so I figured they were safe lmao 
---
My pleasure üòá .
---
I mean, yes it would be more immersive if you didn't have duplicate killers (except for legion), but at the other side, I'd like to go against 2 of the same killers at once from time to time
---
Just imagine Myers hiding in the basement for the first few  minutes of a match and then when you least expect it, he pulls you off of your gen
---
That sounds like a horrible idea. Of course people say that you should gen rush for; legion and the plague but isnt that the strategy for every killer??? But not cleansing? Thats gonna leave you and everybody else vulnerable
---
Step 1. WIN key+print screen for a screenshot /s
---
Step 2. Verify game files. 
---
Step 3. If step 2 didn't work, try uninstalling/reinstalling 
---
Chuck is the Killer. Frank the Survivor lol I'd dig it
---
looks like the next killer will be an SCP.
---
Wow, it's like they JUST added a perk that you can bring if you don't like this.
---
If I want a 4k I'm not getting cheesed out of it cos you barely scraped 2 gens.
---
What?
---
Spies of Sarumans 
---
Nice try, Plague! You can‚Äôt trick us!
---
You are out of your mind if you think survivors have been getting the buffs as of late.  The past 7 months or so have been pretty much all killer buffs and survivor nerfs.  The game has never been more balanced for killers at present.  You got balls to mention Decisive lol.  They nerfed it out of the game by reducing it to a pathetic 3 second duration on top of the change to where it only works to punish tunneling off hook.  3 seconds especially with the meta perk Enduring meant you wouldn't make it 9 feet without being redowned lol.  The devs realized this and rightfully increased the stun duration.  Even with this change it still is nerfed overall because you used to all be able to use it to avoid your first hook.  Now you have to eat a hook and even then it's on a short 60 second timer to be used at all.  Removal of the Pallet Vacuum, Rework of the building window spawns, removal of instablinds and brand new parts, buff to survivor pick up animation,  buff to NOED downing at all levels, buff to ruin affecting all survivors at all levels, buff to surveillance, Devour Hope, addition of discordance, nerf to survivor healing speeds.  Killers like you will never ever be satisfied until survivors start the game on hooks.  It's impossible to take you seriously.
---
I thought i was alone in this, doing whatever that is only when i play killer. Doesn't happen all the time but it's quite annoying. Play on PS4 also.
---
I'm seeing there are 3 survivors loaded in so I'm guessing the fourth somehow loaded in as a killer? Funny glitch indeed. 
---
Maybe if quinton was badass
---
Bruh the plaugue is the boomer she just lost some weight
---
Legendary save! Can't wait for head on to be in the web.
---
The first one sounds way to damn OP
---
I always wanted a killer with a nunchuck-esque weapon 
---
what was the video 
---
She looks like she‚Äôs been smoking meth under a bride for a few days üòî
---
Nice dude.  Facecamping with two people left and a gen up lol.  Trash 
---
1 hit downs aren‚Äôt really that scary unless the killer has a way too counter loops. So being broken isn‚Äôt too bad unless someone does give her the purge. As for the apple addons, I rarely see them right now. Most often I see cool down or effectiveness addons so I wouldn‚Äôt really worry about the apples. I do cleanse if my team is cleansing, but I prefer she doesn‚Äôt get her purge at all, cause without it she has no way to snowball and has as much map pressure as clown.
---
[Just for you bb I googled it.](https://youtu.be/9NDLSfr49co)
---
Dude who wouldn‚Äôt want to marry Bruce Campbell
---
How about a Doctor to make survivors scream and a Nurse to wreck them?
---
Your point about the lore is not true, the point of the offering is that you beseech the entity to grant you those kills. That's why you gotta burn an offering and can't just kill them willy-nilly whenever you so please.
---
I know that winning with a mori is much easier, but winning with brand new parts is much easier, winning with instaheals is much easier, winning with a key is much easier etc, etc.
---
My role is 'killer'. I'm here to kill people. Not to give people scares and spook them, I'm here to mercilessly murderise them. The game's rules allow me to use any and all tools at my disposal. So if I'm allowed to use this tool, why do I have to take such a hefty hit to the face and why with ONLY that one tool? 
---
If they gonna go about and punish people for using the most powerful tools at their disposal then they would have their hands full and balancing would be even more of a nightmare than I assume it already is.
---
If a mori would only penalise me slightly I might be okay with it, however, it hurts super bad atm you are almost guaranteed to de-rank with it. You are literally hurting yourself almost as much as you hurt the survivors.
---
Man, I‚Äôm loving these DBD TPB memes lately
---
 i would like to say its leftover from the teacher, but its prob just the nurse 
---
What? that‚Äôs not very low they would use agitation iron grasp and 3 traps. It‚Äôs not that low
---
Aren‚Äôt you the same person who got messaged from the huntress?
---
People always just base it off her in game portrait, but fail to comprehend the monstrosity that is megs portrait

F*cking awesome cosplay
---
Aurora Borealis?! At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localized entirely within Azarov's resting place!?
---
It just objectively does unless there is a voice comms feature in the game. I don't even watch him. I only watch Panda, Cahla, and Edgar, and Monto. But good job making a complete non-argument, bruhbruh
---
Why you do him like that
---
Depends on how you want to play, either play split pressure to hit multiple survivors and then go for a single person, or just tunnel a single survivor until they go down.
---
If you are doing split pressure, I highly recommend using Discordance.
---
If you are gonna try to tunnel a single survivor down, try to listen out for the survivor since it can be easy to Juke a legion because he can't see scratch marks.
---
/u/zombiehugger
---
Would know
---
You would still be able to do ot with a Cypress mori
---
Because he wasn't the stressed one? It was the one he was interrogating
---
Fuck me how many times is someone gonna post this exact joke
---
It's a great perk, but Claudette is one of the easier survivors to raise to 40 if you're able to. Her perks sync really well together, and some of them are even fine alongside or separate from self care.
---
Nah fam 
---
God this stream was so good
---
From a gameplay point of view alone, he's real weird to play.
---
I'm a chase he can be a God if you know how to use him well enough (which I don't) , cutting loops short and punishing survivors for being greedy. However he has basically 0 map pressure and 0 time wasters at his disposal without perks.
---
 Pig has her traps, to slow the game down, just a little bit.
---
Plague has her infected effect.
---
Doc has his madness levels
---
Even Freddie's dream state 
---
These killers are low tier but they all have something in their disposal to delay gens being done without the need of perks, even if it's not by much.
---
Clown however, he's got nothing. You can get really good at throwing bottles sure but it doesn't interrupt actions unless it's a direct hit, and once you down and hook someone the only delay would be healing and whatever perks you bring in the match. (you can argue trapper is the same but honestly I'm a paranoid mess when playing against trapper and check every loop for traps, plus they instadowm if caught. )
---
Not asking for a buff for him as I feel he's in a fine place but in a game with a plethora of other fun abilities and builds, his are rather small because of the limitations his ability has. 
---
If you couldn‚Äôt disarm traps by default, then he could literally 100% guarantee a kill if he locks someone in the basement by trapping all 3 points of ingress.  Doing so is already an 85% confirmed kill, but having that sort of 0 counter play strat seems gun for no one.  I know Bubba can already 95% guarantee basement kills (unless one player  is running Borrowed Time with a prepared MoM) but to do that Bubba has to physically be inside the basement shack, whereas Trapper in this scenario could patrol anywhere within 50 meters of it, or even further if he‚Äôs running add-ons which reduce escape likelihood.
---
Im sure he still plays but hides his username to avoid another ban, he recently put out an apology
---
Yea the fact is if you dont run ruin, dont play killer and since you cant have ruin on all your killers unless you put a SHIT TON of hours into the game, its unplayable. Thats the main issue with the game for killers, gen rushing is a MASSIVE problem. I wouldnt mind if they nerfed killers BUT also massively slowed down the game. The fact you can have 3 survivors working on 3 gens while chasing one. By the time you catch your first guy, you got 2 gens left, second hook logically all the gens are already down. I used to be rank 15 hard stuck until i got ruin on everyone now i get to rank 6 by not trying
---
Wait, didn't you also get messaged by a huntress role-playing? People love to send you weird stuff it seems 
---
üòÇ
---
lol yes i did. &amp; it seems so.
---
I‚Äôd much rather just get the game over with than run around looking for an immersed Claudette. But yeah, that‚Äôs just my opinion. Doubt me of being a fellow killer main if you‚Äôd like, I could not diss one of my own kind 
---
It‚Äôs not your PS4... it‚Äôs just that the game fucking sucks since they reverted back to old matchmaking!
---
Survivors should not be punished like by doing their objective as they fukcing should. Its actully bhvr who should get their shit together and fix the speed of the game by adding more time as a small fix or a mandatory secondary objective that aint an m1 simulator. (And tbh that secondary objective aint hrd to come up with) 
---
If you ask my pet mosquito he‚Äôd say I got the biggest balls in the west
---
First person perspective really changes how you approach things.
---
One turn from one of those points and that survivor is gone.
---
Survivors think its cute when they point away and run as soon as killer turns around, so a lot of killers don't do that anymore.
---
I really wish I could be on either end of that scenario.
---
üíÄ
---
Yeah, bad wording. I thought you said a 100% chance for a skillcheck.
---
Though the exhaustion thing is bonkers, lol.

How is he holding your game hostage, he maybe couldn't find you, and the add-ons do effect mend time, like alot. Those are the two best add ons for mend time, he clearly didn't want them to go to waste.
---
His perk set up is to stop genrushing 
---
I didnt say you were angry, I said if you are. But I get your point

Thats alright, used to it aha
---
Who‚Äôs ochido? I‚Äôm new sorry.
---
To me its gotten better.
---
Out of 20 games I've only been told "kys" once, its definitely an improvement.
---
As with any competitive game, you are going to find angsty teens and childish adults.
---
For such a delicate ecosystem this game has, where if less people played killer, the game would just die from inactivity, people surprisingly care more about their ego than the health of this game. Egotistical people come in waves though and tend to burn out on this game faster, which means after a time and during certain times (at least on PC) the population is quite fun actually.
---
I imagine the PS4, Xbox crowd is rougher because statistically speaking those populations consist of higher concentrations of children. Children tend to have less experience with dealing with their emotions so they tend to lash out and throw tantrums more often. I've seen people as old as 22 still have emotional immaturity but almost never beyond that. 
---
I never said they shouldnt do their objective, I said they shouldnt gen rush. Gen rushing in its purest form is to do generator and ONLY generators (leaving other survivors on hook without saving them)
---
While in game, shift + tab to open the steam overlay then go to view players. You might be able to find the killer there.
---
Now I imagine the killers sitting at a campfire of their own, holding a bad-anon.
---
Its decent at the low ranks but its very much useless outside of that.
---
Honestly? I find survivors with boil over to be a lot easier to transport
---
Might be a bug or something but it's always been easy, almost as if I'm transporting a survivor that isn't moving 
---
Lets get a Nightmare/Doctor duo in here 
---
I think you and I have very different definitions of "a good boy"
---
We all gotta find fun in the game
---
So you're saying increasing mend timers on every mend application is intended? I clearly don't see that in the perk description.
---
i'd like to think of it as nurse's pepsi

If you hook them all, at least twice then that's a pip.
---
The entity doesn't actually want you to kill them, it wants you to hook them.
---
Killing them is your reward, not your goal.
---
He definitely lifts. 
---
It's the basic part of Legion, the more someone is hit with it the harder it becomes to mend

---
Looks like the entity spikes from corrupt intervention. Was the killer using it per chance? 
---
I got that bug today too. I was killer and I could not play at all.
---
Some perks work like that bud
---
It is totally ok for survs to just do the gens cause you never know what your team is doing half the time so why not just secure your own escape at the very least.
---
Yep xD
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
I know some killers that could use that, Nurse, Clown and Freddy to name a few.
---
Bless me, oh father. 
---
Watch over me, and keep the killer on the other side of the map.
---
Protect me from mori, and deliver me a hatch escape.
---
Amen
---
well they'd need to be asleep to get hit, yeah, but the vault thing I figured would just happen if Freddy aimed his power at a vault
---
I'm way too cautious around crows in the first few minutes because of this. I know the perk is so uncommon, but I always go "What if this is the guy who runs it?"
---
This is why Myers will always be the best killer for immersion.
---
Welp...
---
I've been against every single rework idea I've seen, but this is actually great. Chase potential, mobility, cool for lore
---
Needs 
---
Anyone‚Äôs mistake, I turned just as the entity was going to take him. 
---
I don't think having a murderer as a survivor would be a good idea though...
---
"Let someone else have fun at little expense to your own"
---
You could apply this to the survivor looking for the hatch too though- just let the killer kill you because it's fun for him even if you don't find it fun
---
It's a pretty shitty argument imo
---
It's because of the pipping system and audio problems.
---
Honestly, I would stay away from DBD until either rank reset (the 13th) or the mid-chapter patch (approx. the 30th).
---
Im afraid i dont understand what you mean
---
It‚Äôs a bug from what I‚Äôve heard - the addons stack in a weird way. Tbh I‚Äôm hoping instead of fixing this bug they just delete legion altogether
---
I don't have problems if it's just me and a friend, but yeah the wait times for 3 or 4 man lobbies are ridiculous. What's funny is that this issue went away completely when they updated the matchmaking system when Plague came out, but now that they reverted it back the old system we're back to the same shitty queue times we had before the update.
---
No.. It‚Äôs actually a bug. Pretty ridiculous you think it‚Äôs intended to spend 3 or 4 minutes mending. 
---
What region are you from? I‚Äôm from Europe and finding games very fast 
---
Perhaps we PS4 survivors should spend time playing killer. More bloodpoint per game too. 
---
Do you have the pics with their original resolution? I wanna use them instead of the game's 
---
While this looks bad it‚Äôs more due to the emblem system then matchmaking. There is literally no red rank survivors right now cause of how hard it is to rank up. Last update the purple and green survivors may have both been red. The two brown survivors is definitely just shitty matchmaking though.
---
Sorry you‚Äôre just so old that you can‚Äôt find enjoyment in the best joke ever told, it makes me sad honestly üòî
---
You're that one guy from Twitter, aren't you?
---
Yeah I'm sure god disconnected from that game. 
---
The thing is, everywere in rank 1 before the new rank system lmao wtf you trynna do ??
---
That rank doesn‚Äôt matter???
---
I play solo and my shortest queue time is around 17 minutes :/
---
Also yes it‚Äôs incredibly easy for anyone to reach it so why‚Äôd you bring it up??
---
It's a glitch in the addons man.  4 minute mend timers aren't an actual supposed to exist thing.  The update broke the addons and now pieces of cheating shit like this killer are purposely running them knowing the bug it creates to create an unwinnable cancerous game for survivors.  It's cheating and it's pathetic.
---
Everyone keeps talking about how thick she is, I'm just staring at her huge knockers that have physics 0_0
---
Your argument is invalid sir 
---
Bing Bong has a nice way of waving. Just bang the cowbell without finishing your transition!
---
***I want it to hang the survivors by their asses.***
---
It scares me. It‚Äôs so abnormal, to see them happy, haha.
---
[deleted]
---
The best is when someone goes down across the other side of the map and they still run for 20 seconds before  allowing you to heal their dumbass.  Scared survivor logic.
---
Holy fuck I‚Äôm losing brain cells by talking with you, I‚Äômma stop
---
Just played a game where I played a white ward and escaped through the hatch without using all of my commodious toolbox and the killer did not have Franklin's demise. I still lost the toolbox. Is this s ok me kind of glitch? 
---
a sociopath bug made of salt‚Ä¶ !
---
Uhuh that‚Äôs what I thought now get the fuck outta here loser 
---
I would rather fight legion then a competent nurse, 
---
This game could use some arcade modes like this. Maybe 2 or 3 killers and 8 survivors. With a ton of generators and perk options.
---
Perk affecting bloodlust should not exist. Bloodlust is a shitty mechanic that was added only for bad spawns in maps and should not be powered in every way
---
The amount of idiots that donate to him, he‚Äôs just bought a new pc with all the free money he gets, and now he blocks his name so people can‚Äôt ban him anymore. 
---
I wonder where the hit box is in that thing. 
---
Legion really isn't that bad unless they use the nasty bug, or a combination of addons and chasing you without being in a chase.
---
The biggest problem is survivors wasting their time by healing. Stay in injured and do gens.
---
Also don't drop pallets unless you are sure to stun and take him out of rage. Everything else is a waste.
---
Classic rank 20
---
I‚Äôm free !!!
---
Your Monitor rework would be broken.  It would immediately become meta for the perma speed increase on just about every killer.  Also Monitor is perfectly fine exactly where it is.  It's already a good perk.
---
Not to mention the exit gates could just be trapped so no one can get out, throw in extra bear traps and then the hatch could be trapped the exact same way.
---
Bitch I'm rank 16

---
You could have gotten away if you didn't run back to the pallet at the beggining
---
You smart as hell
---
its not that i didn't listen its that i have a mild form of autism that makes it difficult for me to establish what spelling i need and effects my spelling in general so when i said i was sorry i really meant it. its not like its deliberate guys....
---
I disagree. As long as the survivor doesn't work with the killer it's fair game.
---
If i see that baby meg crying in the corner i give her a nod telling her it will be alright and then slaughter the other three giving her the hatch.
---
I see it as my right as a killer to decide who lives and who dies.
---
Also don't wanna discourage new players or those that are simply not good. I'd rather have a popular game with lots of noobs than a handful of sweaty gods.
---
Well, if you get an unhook but your teammate get almost instantly put down, the game would say its an unsafe unhook and you get negative points. But yeah, this should be more punished because I got screwed way to often because of my teammates.
---
You can doubt if you want but it was fast as fuck on ps4 until they reverted it back lol
---
Surv leaving after being downed first time or right at the start of the game is one thing, but I personally hate being moried by some killers so I disconnect right before it. Imo these are two different levels screwing up your team for 3vs1 and just leaving instead of being killed
---
I still think Platinum is out of my reach, especially with the Pip changes making Adept Killer that much harder.
---
Nurse has been a pain at first, spent numerous games absolutely humiliating myself, but she's starting to click now. Still get that SWF group that know what they're doing and walk over me, but I've managed to go from being unable to do anything, to getting 3-4k fairly often. Definitely up there in amongst my top 5 with Spirit, Huntress, Hag and Clown for my favourite Killers to play. 
---
Nope. I cant stay i just cant. I had multiple matches tonight where someone tried to unhook then heal right there and guess who gets tunneled? Me. I have self care i will let someone heal me but we gotta go around the corner or something. 
---
Adam the clown could be his killer
---
But it will be enough for every survivor, lest say Tier 1 will be 2 or 3 birds, tier 2 will be 5 or 6 while tier 3 being 7-8 birds.
---
I suppose my real question is "Does that mean it was better?" Considering the rank matchmaking seemed screwed up, it might be a good price to pay to wait. But catch me probably making more memes about falling asleep in queue 
---
As a nurse main I highly recommend trying out shadowborn it helps you see the survivors better after blinking
---
Fuck swf, hope you never find a game :) downvote to hell. Thats what you do anyway right, gang up on one poor killer.
---
Yeah, I need DBD content so it doesn‚Äôt get removed 
---
But! I think you deserve a pip when played well, not for surviving. Example: got 2 gens done, got 4 SAFE unhooks, healed 4, juked the killer multiple times but got killed. Overall good game so you get granted 1 pip and around 20k points. Thats fair
---
I love your style!
---
&gt; I would give her a hug and treat her nice
---
she does not want your hug 'cause she does not think you are actually fine yourself
---
Distressing, Unnerving, Hex: Ruin and good old BBQ as Doctor does the trick on that map :D
---
This game me a good chuckle.
---
I only take green moris or red. Yellows are next to useless. Its safe to say i wont have any just in case i need a ritual done. 
---
Nah game is fine. Just play and learn. If you feel your rank is too high and games are too hard then de rank a bit
---
Wow, how DARE you try and succeed! Go FUCK YOURSELF you babby killer! /s
---
For me I was matchmaking with even level killers so I‚Äôd not know. For what it seemed it was only a big issue for PC consoles seem to be doing fine 
---
Not gonna lie, sometimes when i'm playing Ash I get a Frank West from DR4 vibe. I'm not sure why because they don't really look all that similar.
---
I suppose it depends on your definition of better. All I care about is care about is finding games quick (when playing with friends), so going by that the matchmaking DID get better. Does mismatched matchmaking ruin the experience for newer players (which I think was the main reason for it being reverted)? Yes, but you also want to know what ruins the experience? Long queue times.
---
As someone that loves Deliverance I think it's fine as it is. It's a good mix of power and risk.
---
This is honestly really fucking cool. I highly suggest you post this on the DbD forums if you haven't already as that is where the Devs are most likely to see this:  [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories)
---
I really want this to happen.
---
I think there are two problems with Freddy, and this is a great idea to help alleviate one of them: his weakness.
---
The other problem is that he's just not fun to play against, and I'm not sure this will help that, but I don't know what really would. 
---
Cool idea though! Definitely a step in the right direction. 
---
No idea, I was thinking the same thing and hoping it's soon
---
No, you deserve a pip for surviving no matter what. Here's why along with some new ideas to support that argument.
---
The goal of the ranking system is to encourage all survivors to escape and to encourage killers to kill everyone. 
---
Escaped: 1 point
---
Escaped with 1 other survivor: 2 points
---
Escaped with 2 other survivors: 3 points 
---
Escaped with 3 other survivors: 4 points
---
Sacrificed/Dead: -1 point
---
No matter what you did to help/drag your team down, the rewards of escape and death will remain the same. Whether you hid in a corner all game or did all 5 gens alone, the reward for surviving (assuming you survived alone) is always 1 point. The punishment for death is always -1 point.
---
Now, we want to discourage hiding the whole game or playing selfishly. Here are some ideas to discourage it.
---
-Remove the hatch. This will discourage camping out for the hatch to save yourself only.
---
-Add a 30 minute time limit. If all survivors fail to escape in less than 30 minutes, the entity will automatically kill them. This forces the team to work together in order to not waste time.
---
-The new ranking system seen above. More survivors escaping = more points.
---
High iq plays from him right there 
---
Yeah, just re-read my post and it comes off a little entitled. What I can add is that I don't have the necessary spare time it takes to get a chunk of upgrading done.
---
Sucks, but that's life, I guess.
---
Can someone remind me how to block people on reddit? I'm sick of these unfunny, tryhard remake meme posts. 
---
One last chance to spite them. That purple flashlight will never hurt anyone again
---
Most of them have nothing to do with eachother, but the accident that got spirits dad fired may have been the train crash Adam was taken in
---
While I appreciate the compliment, I'm sure Batman's detective skills go further than "look down and right". :P
---
What about on the game....
---
12% is literally not even 2 seconds and it's the same as iron grasp. If the hook is near it will be useless anyway
---
I would love him in the game! But they are already making a scream game, realeasing in 2020/21, and we‚Äôll be able to play as the film and tv characters, I hope it‚Äôs not toooo similar to dbd and f13, I hope it‚Äôs something completely new! But maybe they could sort something out and have him/her in both games!!
---
Console, if they play him right its impossible to win, add ruin, unnerving and a small map and gg game over
---
i've been blindin and popin generators man i feel just like toxic surviva!!!!!!
---
Don‚Äôt forget a lot of people are DCing for no reason. Yeah there are the crybabies who leave, but there‚Äôs a massive problem with people being kicked for no reason. 
---
Pig's add-on which moderately increases skill check in jigsaw boxes. "Moderately" means 2% and even with that, more skill checks means more probability to hit the white zone and remove the trap faster.
---
I‚Äôve imagined some interesting scenes between her and Meg. 
---
Not all swf groups bully killers. Sometimes people like to play games with a friend or two just to have fun. Don‚Äôt be that one guy who cries over friends playing a game together. 
---
Unfortunately they don't usually announce them too far ahead of time. Usually like a week or so early.
---
Cancer
---
Just listen to footsteps 4HEad.
---
We all know that every killer has +2k hours and has perfect awareness of 360¬∫ sound, perfect hearing, good headphones and they can even listen to urban evasion/walking.
---
Joking aside, in a world where every killer has ZubatLEL's skill level , then yeah odd bulb would be pretty pointless, but we dont live in that world, not even close.
---
literally who cares, move on
---
Will it show previously played with players? 
---
me misplay
---
me DC
---
me good survivor main
---
they got rid of the hag and doctor splinters but not the licensed ones
---
I just remembered that Huntress exists, she is also not an M1 killer, I don't think they call her an M2 killer. I think in general that M2 doesn't get mentioned. Not only in DBD, but also in other games I only see people mention M1.
---
Anyways, Billy, Bubba and Huntress are not concidered M1 killers
---
Actually I very rarely run it, but there were a lot of situations where I went searching if I saw a crow take off and actually found somebody there
---
Well he's one of the best streamers if you ask me. Can't watch him tho, league is too boring.
---
Both are shitty
---
my issue is more on the people who have to dart across the map to heal, I would actually prefer if you made some distance beforehand. just dont go cross country.
---
I don't think adding more blinks to the game is a good idea. 
---
We already have nurse that is problematic enough.
---
I see you're a person of culture. I didn't want to buy the skirt so I use the black torn up skinny jeans.

There should be some sort of punishment for deliberately leaving games, or atleast a better punishment rather than less bloodpoints gained

Yes!

Why are people still defending legion? Since the release it has been obvious legion isn't good for the game. If bhvr wants to keep the game alive reworking, legion should be their top priority.
---
all the trappers got the traps and they always been featured in my montage
---
Thanks for the tip, already decided not to use NOED because I think it's about as cheep as the old decisive strike. Just trying to make fun and effective builds with my 0 dlc other then the nurse. (which I think was free) Who knows, maybe one day I'll actually be able to do any kind of mind game and move away from a shitty wraith tracking build. :D
---
Oh man, yea, this is what Freddy needs. Like, it's his nightmare, he controls it, why should he be limted to just chasing the survivors? I would love Freddy if his whole kit was themed like that.
---
I personally would add one more layer - illusions. Freddy can choose between teleporting to the location or sending an illusion (without red stain) for mind-game potential. Also make this ability work on more than just windows (break pallets, gens, check lockers, etc. - If Freddy does it it counts as an action, if the illusion does it it plays the sound and animation, but has no effect)

So you want swf removed then? See how many will quit this game if that ever happens. If you can‚Äôt handle some swf stacks, then just don‚Äôt play dbd.

Dude he's talking about the double weapon
---
"nice guys like me are basically forced to be douchebags because of ~~girls~~ players like you"
---
Let idiots be idiots and move on. Or just don't play competitive games if you can't handle that. Same thing with Overwatch and LoL, same thing with this one, you will not stop idiots from playing the game, so either you stop caring or you're just gonna suffer.
---
Also, don't put excuses in to justify something like camping. If you feel bad about doing that then you won't keep doing it, if you don't feel bad about it knock yourself out. 
---
And put freaking addons on, the hell dude.

I think that'd be awesome, my only thought would be what if there's a survivor in the locker? 
---
Much appreciated üëçüèª
---
Hey guys, let's try to maybe keep it civil. A discussion about the viability and effects of perks is always good but you're getting pretty close to a dick measuring contest here. I'm sure your both great players simply with different opinions, maybe try to change each overs minds instead of comparing rank.
---
It only allows for vaults and the accuracy is up 100%. I like it.
---
Why on earth would I just take that kind of behaviour with a happy smile? I've encountered a shitton of toxic survivors, no matter my playstyle. I've done nothing but play fair for multiple games, and most of them go straight southwest, and are hair pullingly frustrating. 
---
I'm not making any excuses. I'm doing it 'cause I want to, because I'm frustrated at the sheer shit I have to deal with. Nobody's manipulating my actions, it's just a lot more relaxing to not deal with people being assholes at the gate after a completely fair game. It happens often. Very often
---
Trust me, you don't sound entitled. The grind for the game has become insane. And if you don't have BBQ it feels like you can't justify playing that killer until you get BBQ on them. So not only is the time to grind out points insane but if you aren't getting BBQ on killers then you are stuck playing the same one so now you spend a ton of time grinding and you don't even get a verity of killers to play. that's how I feel at least. And as a survivor you get less points and can't always stack WGLF if you take it. This grind was ok at launch but with so much new content they need to do something to help us out.
---
How do you get this many survivor dailies 0_0
---
F12
---
That‚Äôs not really a moment it excels in tho, it‚Äôs not supposed to let you outrun a killer lol, it‚Äôs for those moments the killer slugs you and gets stalled/distracted enough that you can squirm just out of reach that they need to track your blood or guess which way you went. I‚Äôve had multiple times where someone‚Äôs gotten picked up when I shoo their friends off a flashlight save only to have them be 3x the distance away I thought they‚Äôd be. It‚Äôs not perfect but it does okay.
---
Freddy: \*Teleports in front of you.\*
---
Also Freddy: Nothing personal kid.
---
Instaheal isn't toxic or bad. MoM isn't toxic or bad. Survivors **and killers** will ALWAYS push the limit with what they have and what they can get away with. 
---
That's part of a competitive game. That isn't even in any form toxic or bad game design. SWF with coordinated perks, woop, again, get it over with, be done with it, stop being frumpy about it. 
---
And against gens being done fast, Corrupt Intervention my dude.
---
This trend of just whining about the other side nonstop is what kills this game, not BHVR. 
---
Same. I take those as nights where I'm clearly meant to play something else
---
Literally happens in every game I play nowadays
---
That's just what i can gather. He wants the dog (killer) to go after the chew toy (objective?) that's not related to the person (survivors).
---
This happens in surprisingly more matches then you think and I'm always amazed when I pick up a survivor. Like man you know its huntress how do you just like have the mentality to step inside a locker at all
---
Also I'm pretty sure bloodlust is lost instantly rather than decaying tier by tier, right?
---
With that timing, it might be more that when Plague released more people were playing the new killer, so faster queues for survivors. Around that time I was getting 5-6 minute wait times for Killer. Since Ash's release, I'm getting almost instant queues as Killer while everyone plays the new survivor.

I think you don‚Äôt understand this nor any competitive game.  The ‚Äúdog‚Äôs‚Äù goal isn‚Äôt to walk with you.  It is to rip your throat out.  You want them to always walk ‚Äúthe path‚Äù (which I can only infer as farming) but they don‚Äôt give a shit about what you want.
---
To use your horrible analogy to try to correct your prospective.  The ‚Äúdog‚Äù is the killer, you are the ‚Äúchew toy‚Äù dangled by the stick and the one guiding the path is Behavior (the Devs).  As a survivor you are there for dogs to chew to pieces unless you wiggle around enough to escape their teeth.
---
Uh I‚Äôm console tho
---
This is fucking hilarious
---
Him zig-zaging showed he panicked and didn't know what to do üòÇüíÄ
---
I honestly think it could be as simple as a numbers change to make Freddy good. Reducing the dream transition time or simply giving Freddy a little more movement speed might be enough to make him mid tier instead of bottom.
---
You keep up the good work too! My fave thing to do with her when I‚Äôm being friendly is vomit straight up and message the survivors ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a fountain‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ it is so stupid but so funny to me 
---
But lol thank you! 
---
Yes, you will be tbagged and laughed at unless you dominate the survivors. And if you dominate them you have to listen to 'camper' 'tunneler' accusations or they blame the game for bugs or the rank system is at fault. This fits about 95% of this playerbase.Toxicity fuels toxicity, devs don't care, and it usually gets promoted to be toxic. 
---
There is a russian streamer, he is a fogwhisperer, therefore, supported by the devs in what they do. I must say, there are only a handful of people who have been worse than him, he actually tunnels and is toxic(hitting on hook), and if you call him out for it you get blocked on steam, if you call him out in his stream-chat you get banned by his majesty himself.
---
So its fair to tell new players to not touch this game.
---
Not getting my point, not gonna keep having this discussion, good luck on the salt front.
---
&gt;  There just needs to be a separate game mode for swf, in the least.
---
why would killers choose to play against swf if they have the choice‚Ä¶ it removes most of the fun they can have. There is only one killer who have the potential to regularly have fun against swf and it's the Nurse.
---
Great idea tho

I'm crying from laughter right now.

It would at least get rid of some crying from killers who complain about swf. But taking perk from swf is maybe one of the worst things suggested for this game. Crippling survivors in order to appease killers is not balance, at all. 
---
Thank you üñ§
---
Photoshop will fix that lol 
---
I never compared rank man, just setting the record straight with people who think it‚Äôs an elite achievement.
---
You‚Äôll see in a few weeks what i mean when you end up in rank 1 yourself, just a reflection of time played. 
---
Yeah, BHVR should punish players who purposely disconnect way harder. It can't be that hard to set up a feature which detects whether a player dcs on purpose or not. And then immediately derank them or something. There are way too much bad losers out there.
---
So the only way you can play a good killer is constant voice comms with the other survivors?
---
Bullying isnt what's bad, it's the coordinated teamwork. Not how this game was meant to be played.

Quentin always looks good no matter what you do
---
-FTFY
---
If it wasn‚Äôt meant to be coordinated, why add swf in the first place? I get that it‚Äôs really annoying playing against a coordinated team, but that‚Äôs a part of the challenge. Being able to shit on swf stacks and outplay their calls makes you a smarter, more aware killer. And even if people can‚Äôt swf, they can still invite randoms to parties, discord‚Äôs, etc. 
---
Yes, more posts like this pls
---
8 survivors, double the killers, double amount of survivors. That would be a good game mode
---
Not on high ranks
---
Either way, I don't watch him much except for the occasional compilation, but the dude is entertaining as hell.
---
‚ÄúNo one, cares‚Äù
---
I also would like these pics
---
Don't worry, this will be "hot-patched" in 2 months, with the mid-chapter update - BHVR doesn't like to do stuff inbetween those. And then it's only a matter of a few more months before Legion is made into something that promotes actual gameplay, I'm sure.
---
I mean at rank 17 use what you need to. Chances are the survivors your facing as a new Killer are going to be better than thier rank. NOED is handy on killers that struggle with map pressure, and only rely on M1.   
---
NOED isnt "Cheap" as you get better, you won't need it just because your goal is to not let gens be completed. But when you are just starting, you are going to get genrushed, so use it. Once you start being able to snowball teams and apply the right pressure on gens, the games where NOED is actually useful become far fewer, and its better taking a perk that will help you before the gens are done. But dont let anyone tell you not to use something because its "Cheap".  
---
just use till you dont need it. The spiral of toxcity is real for killers, but tbh I would say thats more a mentality of kills are more important than emblems/points, and thats what turns into camping, cheap killers. If you play every game to try and score the most, and priotise new chases and downs and just try to 3 hook everyone rather than camping, thats what you should be doing. 
---
Jeez what‚Äôs with all the dam negativity??? Really this is the first time I‚Äôve experienced this much hate??is it Freddy??
---
its good until you realize its actually trash but then it's too late to refund it
---
Meg goes down, oof, yahoo into the hatch.
---
for real tho, that‚Äôs a hella far jump
---
Prey and Predator.
---
i see killers complain about stuff and all. but i wish i could just get a lobby, i wouldn't complained D: give me a Squadette with MoM, Dead Hard and instaheals on Rotten Fields i'll be happy :c
---
I‚Äôm currently in a game of Dead by Daylight on my Xbox one. I went to heal my partner while he was hurt and for some reason the icon showing RB to heal didn‚Äôt show up on the screen. I tried it anyway and I couldn‚Äôt heal anyone. 
---
Bruh are you being serious or trolling? the game is still heavily on the survivors side XD i mainly play solo surv but if i play SWF with good teammates its an almost 100% escape rate with all 4 getting out at high rank. if you think its \`easy\` for killer and you can down people \`In JuSt A cOuPle SeCoNds\` then you are delusional or basing it off rank 20 games.
---
"Dammit, now I still have to go get some hatchets."
---
If every killer gave hatch, the last two survivors would do everything to screw each other over
---
Does anyone know how to do this glitch?
---
ooga booga 
---
clicky flashlight
---
If I recall correctly they said something like ''it's not bannable but if the anti-cheat system caughts you we can't help you''.
---
We Freddy mains always get bullied
---
);
---
There's an add on that reveals a survivor 's aura everytime he trew up too
---
Been Rank 1 since Feb 2017 but okay. 
---
A good idea, however it would need some tweaking to work. In the state you've mentioned, a decent survivor could easily just 180 and run away from a window as soon as Freddy vanishes since they'll be anticipating the teleport in front of them. It'd work better if Freddy didn't have an arm-raising power animation and instead a stationary clone persisted for several seconds, much like a doctor clone, so you could mind-game. It'd work even better if you were invisible/silent while teleporting to a vault and during the vaulting animation so a survivor would have to guess whether you're baiting them to run away from the window or actually teleporting to it. That's my 2 cents at least, I hope it makes sense.
---
That's how I have it written. It would just be replacing the FoV addition to the perk.
---
No, that‚Äôs just a baby killer swinging wild
---
How? The movement speed buff is the same Buff given to NOED.
---
Billy
---
Sounds to broken that means free hits at damn near every window and windows already kinda suck 
---
Wow, this is a pretty cool idea! But there would have to be a second parr
---
How so? It's just a 4% increase... Is NOED broken then?
---
Agreed.
---
I‚Äôve been wanting a perk that gives haste out of chase for so long. Would make all the weaker killers so much  more viable (I‚Äôll always be a pig main). BUT I don‚Äôt agree with putting it on Monitor. Monitor is already meta asf exclusively for the smaller terror radius and doesn‚Äôt need to be made stronger. I would rather it be a new perk or a rework to another, maybe weaker existing perk. I would suggest adding it to lightborn, predator or bloodhound instead. That way I could run piggy with something like Ruin, Monitor, Sloppy Butcher and reworked Bloodhound. Nothing insanely OP but I would get to where I‚Äôm going a few seconds faster and have a pretty fun time tracking people too.
---
Sad ps4 doesn't have an end game chat
---
It‚Äôs hard, yes, but at the same time I find it ridiculous it is only part of their lore for BHVR to get rich off of Joey and Susie‚Äôs cosmetics.
---
Not sure why you‚Äôre getting downvoted. #deletelegion
---
you should have changed it to buggzy wilson. Since that's basically who he is
---
Just just got old 
---
Aha yes the killers are always accused of lag switching, but when survivors do it,!everyone laughs and thinks it‚Äôs funny?
---
It's a mind game in the same way the Spirit is. If a survivor is heading to a window and sees Freddy stop in his tracks, it's possible he's teleporting so you can assume the window is blocked, and would have to head elsewhere, however Freddy could be doing that to bait the survivor to run elsewhere. If you have an alternative idea please do share, I just don't think the original concept by OP is enough to help Freddy catch up to/down a survivor.
---
Nope
---
An oldie but a goodie
---
Exactly that, prolonging the chase lets your teammates do more generators
---
~~unless im getting wooooshed~~
---
Wait, does laurie have cosmetics? I've seen her with a black sweater thing and the blue shirt?

You use it to get to a window or pallet and extend a loop or reach the next one. 
---
Little side note, you would still be ducked even if you MoM cuz it needs to be M1
---
Ok so its not just me
---
No you just yeet the killers hit in hope to get closer to a window or pallet 
---
You use it to cause the killer to whiff a hit or to gain that extra distance needed to get to a pallet or window. When used properly it can allow you to get to the next loop when you would be downed without it.
---
Ever played a nurse with 2000+ ping? I was blinking more as a survivor than she was. I later got booted offline for telling them to improve their connection...
---
Thanks! What was the novel? 
---
You were a mistake
---
I didn‚Äôt realise that was meant to be a Zoey cosmetic. I know we have Bill and Francis Jake; is there a Louis for anyone?
---
whats BL
---
i don't mind when the killer leave as soon as the game start but it's fucking boring when they do it while in the loading screen. You have to wait 5min stuck in there or have to shut down the game.
---
Balanced Landing.
---
Nurse Bepis
---
I don't remember, I just remember the character. He was a trucker who the main character found at a gas station.
---
INSIDIOUS FREDDY 
---
Funny how the only rework ideas people listen to are in image form...
---
It lets you whiff an attack and get to a pallet or window. It's also useful to regain ground if you made a mistake. Can also be used against camping killers and getting past someone defending the exit gate. 
---
Basically all exhaustion perks except head on let you extend a chase or gain distance, but they each vary in terms of ease of use as well as potency. Sprint burst gives you the most distance (no delay due to vaults or falls consuming haste) but you can't easily save it in a chase. Lithe gives you a more controlled boost if there are windows nearby, which is most of the time, but it'll still activate when you don't need it to sometimes. Balanced landing is difficult to take advantage of in most maps but also opens up loops (pale rose boat, houses in haddonfield, etc.), and is very easy to control. 
---
Dead hard is the most accessible and easiest to control, but gives very small distance. It makes up for this by also giving iframes but yeah, not my favorite exhaustion perk either (mine is BL).
---
Nope, but Rochelle is Claudette.
---
Along with all the other comments it can let u run over the Trappers bear traps, so if ur running toward a pallet and he's right behind u u can dead hard through it causing either the Trapper to step in it following up with a pallet stun OR it can create extra space by him going around the pallet. It also helps with Huntress hatchets and especially helps when ur about to get smacked down at an exit gate. A lot of ppl think dead hard sucks but its all in the timing, it can be a real game changer.
---
Oh yeah, if you hover over the clothing it says a quote from Zoey too. Not sure if we have Louis but maybe Dwight? 
---
BL is still better. Trumps all the other exhaustions. Might be slightly harder to activate the burst but definitely worth it more.
---
First of all, self care is not meta anywhere but amongst green rank peasants. SWF dont use self care and bontany + medkit is factually better.
---
STBFL and thrill of the hunt are weak perks; thrill is currently meta on no killer and only viable on Nurse. If the killer wants to walk across the map to find a survivor they can try. Getting bl1 then going to find a new survivor is off meta, especially if they know you have it and force trigger the chase.
---
You can blame your parents for making you such a pussified piece of shit who gets triggered by people pressing the crouchbutton.
---
Literally shelter woods is the only map that doesn't have a proper drop on it. 
---
Your ps4 had a stroke 
---
Thanks!
---
DH is for people who know how to loop.
---
Lol I seen this post and instantly I knew there was gonna be a comment like this one. So I had to check and here it is.
---
You can just wait for them to get close to the window, use the power to block it and get a hit on them.
---
It's a blink, there is not much counterplay to it.
---
There‚Äôs a bug where the heal simply stops after starting it, so you have to hit M1 again. 
---
He's a rank 16 killer on twitch ;/
---
I love it honestly
---
Looks awesome. Reminds of Hollow Knight lol.
---
Had a similar experience with the winter menu screen, the menu screen!!
---
 They don't care much for console support unless it bring them the money.

---
Lol OK. I'd love to see how you correlate liberals with those offended by tbagging. Do you personally ask each player their political affiliation? Or do you so center your identity around your ability to own teh libz that anyone who does anything you don't like = liberal? 
---
That‚Äôs how all killer mains look when they complain about adrenaline.
---
It's a weaker blink, but don't forget his existing ability too - survivors in the dream world have auras revealed and slowness to repair.
---
That's not true.  Behavior released statistics showing killers dominate about 55% of games. Ill agree the game used to be more survivor leaning but those days are long gone.
---
Nah, even if you did ToTS's paintjobs are all over the place and look horrible... compare OP's pic to the actual product picture and you'll see...
---
Thank you! I'm still fairly new to digital drawing so every piece is a learning curve for me, but I was happy how this one turned out :)
---
You didn't read the original post or mine then. It's not a blink, it's a teleport and the killer plays the vault animation towards the survivor.
---
I see its P1. It's not too late to change mains you know. Are you sure that you want to main a P3 Claudette?
---
Could I interest you in a Jeff? Maybe a Quentin? How about Tapp?
---
I really want Freddy to have the chance to morph into something random...       Also caterpillar Freddy smoking a bong and then eating a entire downed survivor.
---
It's cause whoever you're healing is starting to move as you heal so it stops. 
---
I don't care how bad your lag is... Why would you run around the loop after talking a hit instead of THROUGH huntress into the hatch?
---
Makes sense
---
This is absolutely adorable. I love how much detail is in his mask from the shadows and highlights. Really nice work!
---
*Hex: Feisty Midget*
---
I love it.
---
Kinda off topic but i don't understand how showing your teeth is considered smiling.
---
And that‚Äôs every time, wow people are impatient. Thanks for telling me tho

---
It's a blink that isn't omnidirectional and can only target vaults. Good freddys will he able to fake it but bad ones will get looped. You still have to do the dream world shenanigans, and you still have to do the entire vault animation. Additionally, if you want to run perks to increase the vault speed, that means you aren't running other high tier perks. It seems fine to me. Saying it's a "free hit at any window" is objectively false.
---
You should check out the DBD requirements on steam and compare them with this system. That should give you a hint on wether it'll run well or not
---
They're dancing there
---
Beautifully done! As a suggestion, when doing shadows. If you would like a more natural looking shadow, use the complement of the color of your light source as the base of your shadow. Here is a good article on the concept.

Label this as humor, not gameplay. I've played for 3 years and have never had anything like this happen to me.
---
actually I Prefer this new DS.
---
Thats a really good counter against farmers/tunneling and its even fair for the killer now 
---
That's not the Freddy we got for this game, remember? 
---
Im not saying he becomes nurse tier broken after this, I'm saying that there isn't much counterplay to the window blink.
---
You can simply wait till the survivor gets close to the window, you use the power and block the window. The vault animation doesn't matter as you are fast enough to close the distance and hit them before they can get to anything.
---
the only one who can complain about any perk is freddy about adrenaline
---
I've had so many strange glitches happen to me in this game I probably wouldn't be able to tell if someone's hacking or not
---
I never understand this...I've been rank 1 Freddy and struggle to do the same with the Pig...maybe we should focus our attention on the pig? Freddy is honestly fine.
---
I don't understand what it what sadly. I've tried looking but it's all foreign to me. Do you understand it mate please?
---
Oh ya 100 percent lol. It‚Äôs so dumb it wakes you up 
---
Give it time, perhaps!
---
yep, they really need to give him a way to counter that
---
agrees, just like you shouldnt be able to depip if you get a 4k
---
I mean, if you came back after two rank resets... I'm sure you would be facing noob survivors
---
Just make it so it does not wake you up. Or wakes you up but your still hurt just like with borrowed or legion 
---
Idk about the rest of yall but if I see a freddy vaulting a window in front of me I'm pulling a full 180 the other way. And then what? He has to re-vault the window just to get back in the chase? Seems like a lot of wasted time to me. I'd like to see the opinions of popular dbd content creators. Regardless I see your points and recognize them. I just disagree. I appreciate the discussion though. 
---
Ping maxes out at 1200 on console. I've played it. I don't like talking about it. No man should ever have to go through what I went through.

100% same goes for killer for sure, I just never play killer so it wasn‚Äôt on my mind lol sorry.
---
Son,do you even know what "adrenaline" is and does? 
---
It's fitting. They wont change it,stop complaining.
---
/r/boneappletea
---
Because it‚Äôs too strong of a perk for every survivor to be running. It was a mistake (amongst other perks still in game) to add it in the first place.
---
who the hell tryhards a 2 man game?
---
I think all of the Survivors have to be in tier 3 at the same time. 
---
Ya I do know and I‚Äôm pretty sure it would not automatically  make you not hurt so I don‚Äôt know what your point is. Second I‚Äôm not really complaining I just can see why ppl who play Freddy would want it changed as a game stand point it is pretty dumb how much it fucks Freddy over compared to other killers like say legion 
---
Look at the picture again. 
---
Freddy is facing the survivor when he's vaulting. The power places you in front of the survivor on the other side of the window and makes you vault it towards them.
---
I had this bug last night. Confused the heck out of me. 
---
I like this idea, but it should be more late game. As in, maybe, ‚ÄúIf the killer gets (2 or 4) hits on survivors, ‚ÄòPower Down‚Äô activates on all other hits. Pallets provide a 3% regression while hitting a survivor does 5%.‚Äù
---
Who said I was complaining? I said I understand why Freddy mains hate it I mean unlike with other killers it fucks him the hardest for no reason. And it would not be a unfair thing if they made it so you stayed asleep but it still auto heals. But hey opinions opinions  
---
Its the PARTY HARD Killer, everyone runs ! 
---
The GPU may be a bit lacking. I have a PC with similar specs, (i5-7400, 8GB RAM, 1060 3gb) and it can run the gam on high, but I turn the graphics down to low because it seems to put a lot of strain on the GPU. I think it would be saggy on a 1030.
---
hell no. survivors abused that shit + the killer who didn't want to deal with old DS just slugged the obsession to death which it was really annoying. i love the new DS, i can finally run Deliverance with it knowing I'll be safe until the broken effect vanished.
---
Tree in the middle
---
This would be so op. An efficient survivor can loop using 1 pallet for every 15 to 20 seconds. One full gen takes 80 seconds. This perk would mean that every 15 ish seconds all the generators on the map would lose most of their progress since the beginning of the chase. That would be stronger than ruin, and not even a hex perk.
---
I like how you use f word followed by fuck. 
---
This place full of noob survivors? lol the Doc is one of the worst killers in the game.
---
not at all what i was talking about. I'm referring to the Blindness effect survivors get if hit with certain add-ons or hex: The Third Seal.
---
Should just be a movement buff
---
*^^Tina!*
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Goddamn, I love this idea. Great work.
---
I would be totally for it if there‚Äôs like a cool down for a few seconds 
---
My interpretation was that he would use the power to just vault the window from a distance. Guess we would need more clarification from OP
---
I think Hunter would be better
---
No. The last survivor had options to move the game forward (doing a gen instead of taking the hatch). 
---
Now if the killer had AFKed on the basement stairs so the survivor had no options to do anything, that‚Äôs an example of reportable for holding the game hostage. 
---
That would make it worse than hope.
---
(Sigh)
---
I tried to save you. Another soul has been taken by the Immersed Claudette gang. rip for our fallen brother.
---
Most of the drops are too situational. You have to be near it to get value from BL. If you get caught on the other side of the map, it's a dead perk.
---
Are you sure you Depip?
---
Because I was drunk last night while playing DBD, had a bunch of Killers DC on me, it showed that I depiped, but when I looked after on the screen I was still where I was before.
---
Haha. Don't worry, I am barely immersed. I usually am the one on my team doing gens while everyone is fighting the killer and being altruistic. As well I have balls lol, I don't loose my shit when I get slightly in the killer's terror radius haha. That's why I run spine chill, so I know when the killer is coming at me.
---
Ah gotcha. That's fine then, thanks. Still sucks though, but oh well. 
---
Oh I‚Äôm sure, happened several times last night. Figured i would give it some time to see same rank this morning.
---
Probably just a beginner from the steam free weekend.
---
&gt;That's why I run spine chill
---
;(
---
This is partly your fault, and partly the fault of P2P servers.
---
It happens because you move. 
---
They are not messing up M1.
---
These are the recommended system specs.  
---
* Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system  
---
* OS: 64-bit Operating Systems (Windows 7, Windows 8.1 or above)  
---
* Processor: Intel Core i3-4170 or AMD FX-8300 or higher  
---
* Memory: 8 GB RAM  
---
* Graphics: DX11 Compatible GeForce 760 or AMD HD 8800 or higher with 4GB of RAM  
---
* DirectX: Version 11  
---
* Network: Broadband Internet connection  
---
* Storage: 25 GB available space  
---
* Sound Card: DX11 compatible  
---
The most important things to note here are the CPU, the GPU clock speed, the RAM size, and DirectX 11. If you meet or supersede the requirements on these four, you should generally be fine.  
---
Pretty much every modern PC runs x64 Windows. Pretty much every modern PC supports DX 11. So those are two things you've already got out of the way and don't need to worry about.  
---
The GPU should clock at 4GB, at the very least, which the GTX 1030 unfortunately does not. If you can afford it, I highly recommend investing in a GTX 1060.  
---
As for the CPU, any i5 processor released in the past three years ought to do. I know this, because I use a three-year-old i5 processor and get by just fine with plenty of performance-intense games.  
---
As for RAM, it's cheap, so I recommend doubling up and getting 16 GB, instead of the recommended 8. That way you'll comfortably be able to run other programs in the background while playing, such as Discord or whichever browser you like using.  
---
I'm not exactly a PC expert, but I certainly know a thing or two about this stuff, having built my own custom PC.
---
Bunny tech, you shoulda dced.
---
This happens when you move.
---
I think the GPU is not good enough. The minimum requirement for DBD is a GTX 460 and the 1030 is worse than that.
---
YOu should try to get a PC which has at least a 1040 better would be the 1050.
---
I'd use it if it didn't have a 60 sec expiration on it.
---
I remember that happened to me when a Claudette tried to flashlight save me against a Wraith. She fucked it up but the Wraith dropped me to moried me in front of her :')
---
Honestly I just hit them with the power once and use the power to chase them so I can hit them a second time without the power it‚Äôs kinda toxic but it does the job perfectly 
---
A perk is not adequate when it is so underpowered that nobody uses it. That speed burst can be force triggered and countered by exhausts, and can only be activated by taking the perk and not hitting somebody after 15 seconds of chase AND finding a new survivor.
---
Beast of prey reworked doesnt actually provide any physical value and takes a perk slot. On open maps like autohaven it will not generate any value. On closed maps new slipeory meat, iron will, and poised will allow you to break away from a loop.
---
YES. I haaaate that map for that reason! I thought I was just going crazy, or my TV colors were off. But the auras are definitely dimmer than any other map.
---
Wouldn't doubt it
---
Thank you mate. I appreciate that a lot.
---
She must be new because Spirit has a glitch in which she emits a broken glass sound when she starts phasing and it's harder to fake phase now.
---
No, bodyblocking is a normal part of the game. If the killer body blocked the last survivor in a corner in a way the game couldn‚Äôt progress in anyway whatsoever, then yes, that would be holding the game hostage, but in the event of body blocking the hatch, the survivor can still do gens and do so easily as they have plenty of time to map out traps, exit gates and anything else while the killer is no longer a threat, eventually putting the situation into the survivors favor who will have three escape options. Just have to be careful not to get hit by NOED or rancor once the gates are open, especially if you‚Äôre full health with Mettle of Man.
---
I‚Äôm don‚Äôt have the best eyesight to begin with but never had a problem with vision in this game until that. I wish there was a color blind mode in this game. 
---
Thank you very much mate. I'm trying to understand it all and this has helped a lot tbh. I'll try and call the shop tomorrow as I'm on a tight budget.  Plus I need a desk ect too.
---
I've never encountered any bodyblocking killers until now so I didn't know this was normal. Thanks for clearing that up though! 
---
Yeah but also super buff Freddy 
---
This clip was before that bug
---
Haha, I feel you! I wear glasses, and play on a decent sized TV. Still can't see shit. But it's not us, lol it's the map. 
---
Thanks mate. I've been told to play on low quality anyway as you can see better haha. Not sure why this works but it's what I remember from last time haha.
---
Huh?
---
It‚Äôs a joke tech where you disconnect when the killer swings at you. It‚Äôs not anything significant but when it happens to me on killer I usually dc.
---
That skirt is not within school regulations 
---
Thanks, I'll have to try tweak it a little bit. The original versions time started at 30 and when I typed it I realised how unfair that would be. What if it wasn't broken but instead just injured them, sort of a reverse of how Jane's perk works?
---
Yeah, my bad
---
We need this
---
Do you ever laugh not irl?????
---
Killers: METTLE OF MAN IS OP
---
Also Killers: NO MY PERK THAT REWARDS ME FOR FAILING ISN‚ÄôT OP, JUST DO TOTEMS LAWL 
---
Still can‚Äôt believe they haven‚Äôt changed the hatch bullshit 
---
did we say survivors don't? lol 
---
How wide is this hallway? Cause all I'm imagining is something that people could only go through single-file. 
---
Ummm yeah NOED is pretty unbalanced currently when looking at other crutch perks that have been reworked hard such as Decisive or Borrowed Time.  But at least with NOED the haste is only available endgame.  You want to give it to them for the entirety of the game.  The difference between a huntress who crawls compared to most killers and a Billy is 5% movement speed.  That amount makes a sizable difference when it comes to getting looped.  You want to almost give every killer that increase for the entire duration of the game including all the ones that are already 115% movement speed.  Add bloodlust into this and they will be moving ridiculously fast and become unloopable.  There's a reason permanent midgame haste as a perk doesn't exist dude.  It would be frightfully unbalanced.  If you don't see this you clearly haven't played enough of the game yet to see how broken it would be with the other mechanics of the killers themselves and the chase itself.
---
Then the post game chat explosion when you make them drop it right as they scoot out of the gate makes the painful game so so worth it.
---
Freddy is already annoying to play against, making it more unfun doesn't seem like the right way to go
---
Implying survivors don‚Äôt complain just as much? DCing against Legion, getting downed in the first minute, being camped etc. Both sides complain about loads but don‚Äôt imply survivors only complain about NOED
---
that is the idea, yes
---
Plague: :)
---
Huntress: ;)
---
Doctor: ;D
---
Shape: &gt;;D
---
Cannibal: &gt;8D

Hillybilly: &gt;8D!

Wish we could laugh ingame.
---
The subreddit can be a hellscape. You do get some wholesome and creative posts there but theres so much whining. 
---
If you're better than someone at the game you're a "sweat" and it your not as good as them you're a "bot".
---
Dont you dare wear that skin you bought with your money because for some reason it means you're a tryhard even though skins are just cosmetic.
---
Not every game has to be so serious and "e-sports ready". Every online "arcade style" game gets frustrating if its exclusively the only thing you play. 
---
^almost ^sounds ^like ^this ^sub ^sometimes
---
MICHAEL SAN, don‚Äôt stab meeeee vwv
---
*Insert Spongebob no one cares meme*
---
No more cooldowns pls
---
I have no trouble fidning killer matches at Rank 1. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This is an oppertunity to put Freddy in a position where he is stronger and more fun to play against
---
Yeah if you don‚Äôt defend gens a lot you usually don‚Äôt pip. It‚Äôs to discourage campers but it screws over late game killers and killers without high mobility like Pig
---
Great work on the accurate hitboxes of the huntress' weapon
---
Do you ever wonder: "Man I wonder if Garbador will ever get a Mega evolution?"
---
Look no further than this Wraith.
---
I thought about that, and I figured just nothing would happen, so then Freddy would realize "Oh someone's in there". It wouldn't make checking lockers easier for him either, as if the locker he checked was empty, he'd have to do his teleporting and exiting animation.
---
forgive the subtitle; I capped this from netfli-ah damn the fbi is here gotta go
---
I love playing against hag which makes me sad that I haven't seen her as often recently.  I feel like my games are pretty much always Daddy Michael and Spirit.  I'm cool with that though, they've both got the booty.
---
Or just don't pip at all. You shouldn't be able to farm rank off of boosted players. 
---
Now getting matched against boosted players isn't your fault, so you shouldn't get punished for doing it. So de-pipping from it, I find complete horseshit. But pipping from it shouldn't be a thing either
---
Thanks mate. I'm 30 but not has a PC in over a decade and even then it was basic as hell.
---
I keep going over the website but I think ill end up leaving it as I can't really go over 400 English pound.
---
How would the survivors do a gen if the killer knows where they are the whole time?
---
So how do you get over a gen if there's no vaulting?
---
I've seen a lot of shit too but when Billy rips through time and space with his chainsaw to down someone across the map at light speed...? 
---
OP, question. And I need a serious answer here... \*Inhales\*  
---
Do you have any other drawings and do you upload them to a twitter/Tumblr?
---
Had a lovely Trapper boi be friendly just now, leading us to items and pallets after we fooled around in his traps, he didn't hit us once. Wish I could send them a thank you for it as I really needed some points.
---
Was a nice break from the usual chaos.
---
Trapper is a good example of a skill to effectiveness killer. It's one of the easiest killers to play, so it shouldn't be the most effective killer ever. Don't change him. Also balancing should be done from a skill ceiling perspective. Any other logic would cause the nurse to be buffed since for bad players it's the worst killer.
---
Also an actual developer has already responded to this chain saying it's a known issue and they're working on it.
---
Delete this then yourself, please, thanks.
---
*ignores that killer get multiple perks/abilities that also give double, even triple chances at catching a survivor.*
---
Well in the movie Nancy and Quentin were using adrenaline to keep themselves up. So it actually does make sense. 
---
No system runs dbd properly
---
Its okay though, for my part I always associate it with the final test on the Holy Grail of Indiana Jones. 
---
from the OP
---
&gt; refused to down us
---
Then you write a comment about how at least two people were downed
---
I got you I'll make a meme out of that. 
---
Haha so I've heard. I want to switch from PS4 TO PC though. Just a shame killer lobbies take so long.
---
You realize you can go down from not mending?
---
Spirit is honestly just super cute, Maybe not In-game. but most definitally in art stuff she's just precsiou
---
I wouldn't mind this cutie killing me 
---
No more of a pussy than the little bitches that expect you to give them a free escape for getting their asses kicked.
---
Maybe you can't read, but not mending and slowly bleeding out is not the same as the killer picking us up and putting us on the hook after 40 minutes of mending while he runs away over and over.
---
I agree that the devs should reward off meta play. But some of these perk reworks are a bit ridiculous. You know which ones im talking about already, although a 40% movement speed would be nice ,from a survivor stand point itd be ridiculous (i play both sides of the spectrum)
---
I don‚Äôt think people are upset that you have this preference, I think more people share it than you realize, it‚Äôs just kind of a useless thing to comment on someone‚Äôs story, and it carries a self righteous inflection, which redditors tend not to like I‚Äôve noticed 
---
My first hacker was the second game i played on pc after switching fron ps4. A billy as well. Was speedhacking and walking through walls and knew where everyone was. Ive never gotten anything after that unless you consider lag switchers.
---
Unless its a legion or plague. Just run and do gens
---
much fun =/
---
Nurse can be frustrating if you‚Äôre still learning how to blink, especially against good survivors. Just be patient and practice and eventually you‚Äôll be getting 4Ks and rage messages to the wall
---
Nurse is the hardest killer to learn. You not only have to be good and control her mechanics, but you also need to be able to predict where survivors will go, otherwise you‚Äôll miss and fatigue the entire game.
---
This isn‚Äôt going to be the advice you want, but I‚Äôd recommend playing survivor 50-100 hours. Being able to think like a survivor will make you an apex Nurse. This is true with any killer, but definitely way more important for Nurse. Investing time as a survivor will improve your overall killer rating in general. At a minimum, you should be watching some survivor streamers.
---
Other than that, check out a Nurse guide. Blink where they are going to be not where they are.
---
personnel*
---
look at all those beautiful smiles.
---
Survivor Killer Coop.  They aren't working with you built you are definitely working with them.  At least on your end you're in the wrong.
---
I would disagree. If the killer breaks every pallet in his way and keeps chasing you at 115% movement speed it would be difficult to make more than 15 seconds worth of distance between you and the killer. I forgot to mention this in the first comment, but I am excluding strong window loops such as shack, ironworks, coal tower, auto haven bus, and mother‚Äôs dwelling. 
---
It took me a while to get it but yeah they are selling broken games lol
---
so who outplayed who?
---
True but just because it‚Äôs like that in the movies does not really mean it should be in the game in my opinion at least.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm definitely going to try to play her more.
---
:(
---
Oh yeah I do play survivor a lot tho like I main Jake and I already have Feng and clauddet teachables on him, I mean it helps but not that much thanks for the help tho!
---
And thanks for the blinking tip 
---
They should have had his third prestige cosmetic be his chainsaw in place of the robot hand.
---
Jane lookin' like a S N A C C
---
Yup, this is a shit mechanic in the game. It‚Äôs called a hatch stand off. Still hasn‚Äôt been fixed yet. Glad we‚Äôre getting all this new pricey content though /s
---
„Ç∂‚Ä¢„Ç∑„Çß„Ç§„Éó„ÅØÊÄñ„ÅÑ„Åß„Åô

You want another fucking leri‚Äôs?
---
Cant watch those clips yet but didnt him and tyde scream at jen for deranking. And compare it to murder lmao
---
Yeah... All the changes, reworks and fixes in the work won't even get rid of that bad reaction when people see Legion.
---
It's a shame. Visually, they're really cool. Too bad that everything else with the killer is so problematic.
---
I dont see your point. You kinda explained the answer. Gen rush be weary of noed, do totems no noed gives killer more time. I dont see the problem...
---
Well there's 4 of you or 3 think of something.
---
Nice block üòÅ
---
They just need a slight adjustment to Hex perks and PGTW. Hex perks are a little more complicated to fix, but PGTW is so easy. Put it on a token system instead of a derpy timer and it will likely be meta.
---
DS for tunneling, mettle of man and borrowed time for facecamping.
---
I recognize that place, where is it?
---
My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive
---
You‚Äôre among the minority
---
It's not a 2-man game. When you are in spectator mode the other people who died before you entered spectator mode do not show up on the bottom left. 
---
You can disable chat by clicking on the button right next to the chat box. 
---
Doing this means you won't have to deal with survivor post-game chat on PC. Do expect them to comment on your steam profile if they are particularly salt. Can fix this by privatising your steam profile while playing.
---
No i'm not. Working with them would be if that survivor would lead me to other survivors. Simply not killing them is not working with them. That would need cooperation from both sides.
---
Again i cited the exact wording from the official forum on the rules about banable offense. And nothing in there mentions the behaviour i'm describing here.
---
I wanna Ash in his S-Mart uniform!
---
that just seems like a cover up for a serious comment 
---
As soon as the match is over, leave the end game lobby ASAP. You don‚Äôt get the see chat and don‚Äôt have to worry what they say 
---
It takes less than 20 seconds to read, its not that hard. If your curious about the post then take 20 seconds out of your day to read it. And people read much longer posts than this for your information. 
---
Always run empathy on my survivors when I solo queue. It‚Äôs just so useful to know when someone is being chased across the map, and while I know that Leader is generally better I prefer Empathy for what it does. Most of the time you‚Äôll hear people on gens anyway, or see them when you‚Äôre going for hook saves
---
Rate players sounds really good.
---
That sounds rediculous... Maybe as a Hex perk but otherwise that's rediculous. Also everyone uses Self-Care anyways so...
---
Yes but outside that range, you know someone is hooked but can not see them. Makes up for the fact that being able to silently unhook someone is pretty strong.
---
Okay.
---
Meg looks so nervous üòÇ
---
Jen does it because she wants to go bully people who just got the game so she can look good. As it stands, there are literally like 10 red rank survivors due to the new ranking system, so if you‚Äôre a killer in red rank you can end up waiting like 30 minutes to find a match. 
---
It‚Äôs basically the difference between dropping rank because you‚Äôre a horrible person and dropping rank because you literally can‚Äôt play the game if you get too high.
---
B u t  i f  t h e y ' r e  h i n d i n g  t h e n  t h e y ' r e  n o t  d o i n g  g e n s . Hmmm ü§îü§îü§î
---
Ya but that "downside" is non-existent with SWF's and not sure how that effects Killer.
---
NOED is super fun if...  
---
  
---
1.  Three people are alive and unhooked while one is on the hook.  
---
2.  Your team works together.  
---
In all other cases it is super unfun.
---
There is 5 totems...if your teammates at whatever rank you are failed to do totems then that your teams fault. Thats the point of the game to trust your teammates. NOED is not the problem...the problem is that people are selfish and that leads to people getting killed. I dont think NOED needs a rework, i think people need to be reminded that its a team game.
---
They used to be rough for me on PS4 but honestly that Optimization update we received a month ago made them silky smooth for me.  Ruin got a lot easier to work through.
---
That sounds really damning until you realize the starting point for this game was infinites every map. As in, it started out as survivors literally never being caught by killers unless they wanted.
---
That looks like a box of pizza. üòÇ
---
*no one liked that*
---
trust me, being an Adam main isn't fun (though I'll still do it) tons of killers are hellbent on hooking you first since they all assume you have Deliverance.
---
Exactly like it use to give us bloodpoints for when the disconnected now it doesn‚Äôt... like your taking a L just take it don‚Äôt dc because of some stupid shit. And literally no one was being toxic plus the killer had NoED he could of knocked us all down.
---
it's a nice idea but i don't think someone will run this perk since it's somehow way too risky and BT is more beneficial atm
---
Well. On the bright side, you got to practice against a decent killer. Better to learn from your mistakes against good killers than to form bad habits against bad killers.
---
Yes please!
---
Honestly with how much use you can get out of a pallet being to do it all over again is too much. Perhaps if they‚Äôre repaired but already thrown down? Then with some tweaking...it would still be something that likely wouldn‚Äôt be healthy for the game but there‚Äôs *some* potential here me thinks
---
When your camera takes some LSD before taking a picture.
---
This picture looks so intense.
---
honestly it‚Äôs not because of that. it‚Äôs a lot of hate mail and it‚Äôs because I just don‚Äôt open them half the time.
---
That's fair. Also, Flashlight's are ridiculously ineffective against Ninja Wraith (Ghost/Coxcombed) because he's subtle about uncloaking. He'll uncloak out of sight and use his utter lack of a terror radius or red stain to smack you upside the head before you even have a chance to score a Flashlight blind. 
---
Flashlights are a lot more annoying as Speed Wraither, though, because they can sabotage your attack rush if they're quick enough at scoring lightburn. 
---
Yeah, had the same thing happen a few hours ago. I asked one of the other survivors and he said everything was normal on his end. They were probably wondering why I kept running into walls, but I just couldn't see past my sweater. :D
---
Stop moving when I'm trying to heal you then this usually doesn't happen!
---
These are the rancor rituals so have fun.
---
If you remove the timer then it just goes back to what it was before, except now arguably more powerful since nobody has to wiggle to 35%, and everyone gets it guaranteed on their second down.
---
Lol maybe they don‚Äôt want a heal. One time I was unhooked and a Jake ran with me for like 30 seconds. I just wanted to work on a gen. The dude didn‚Äôt get the hint so I just let him heal me.
---
That's true for a portion of the game. But after the first person gets downed the split becomes 1 survivor hooked, 1 survivor going for save/heal, 1 survivor being chased, and only one survivor left doing gens.  It gets even muddier if the survivors aren't SWF with voice coms, because then you have scenarios where two or more healthy survivors leave gens to go for a save.   And if the killer does have ruin or lullaby, that usually means one or two survivors are going to be looking for the totem.
---
Think about it like this:  If it was true that gen rushing beat killers, even Nurse, 100% of the the time there would be no killers at Rank 1 getting 4k which is just not the case.
---
Bhvr sucks and instead of fixing bugs and balancing perks they release chapter after chapter 
---
Pig: Come over
---
Wraith: Can‚Äôt I‚Äôm killing survivors 
---
Pig: The entity isn‚Äôt home
---
Wraith: *Cloaks for the speed boost and runs for the nearest gate* 
---
It's in the DLC section of the game. There should be cosmetic packs besides the buy-able chapters.
---
I love this game but it really hasn't been that fun lately because of all this. And it's even worse on the odd occasions I play killer. First person hit almost always DCs. Dude, somebody has to be first. What do you expect, that I let you all do the gens and then walk out? WTF
---
Everyone were in the red ranks up until last patch so you have no point, your ideas are so fucking bad that they make me cringe
---
I could see this working with a cool down to prevent it from being OP......there will obviously be an ebony add on to get rid of this cool down.
---
gen rush isnt real 
---
its literally the only objective survivors have to do and complaining about them doing it quickly just makes you come off as entitled
---
do you also want them to hook themselves for you so you dont have to actually play at all?
---
Unrelenting OP
---
Ya but when BHVR takes time just to fix bugs everyone complains there's no DLC. BHVR can't make everyone happy.
---
It's also not.like BHVR isn't doing anything. They are always updating the game. Like have you seen the Bug Fix sections of Patch Notes... They are like full novels.
---
She's easily looped, but not the most vulnerable if she uses her traps. Also once you get to lower levels survivors know how to deal with her. Either using flashlights on traps or just crouching all the time.
---
She's my main killer and I'll have games where I steamroll and games where I barely get two hooks. She's an M1 killer (power doesn't help down or hit), and that's basically why she's mid tier. And low and mid level though she's a blast to play.
---
OK good. If you'll excuse me, I'm going to follow it ASAP
---
Groovy.
---
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a bad killer, I just think you‚Äôre a new killer. You haven‚Äôt been forged by the Great Hammer of Toxicity yet.
---
I was matched with a Kate 2 games in a row yesterday that was pulling off mad flashlight/pallet saves. Had a small moment where we looked at each other after I blew up the first gen in the second match (instant skillcheck as soon as I touched it and got off to go get a box). Always love those little social moments that can happen in this game.
---
That aside, speaking on subreddit meta terms here (again): I never see these threads get too terribly much traction on a day-to-day basis. Would a daily discussion thread be better suited to this sub? A place to share small stories and other things that don't necessarily need their own posts?
---
Absolutely. It prevents hatch standoffs as well.
---
Give me a reason why it is a sgitty idea or not.
---
That has to be every Killers nightmare, choosing a totem perk and having said totem destroyed in the first minute.
---
You're gonna get a lot of shit because people will read "rush gens" and think you're shit talking survivors even though you're not and will feel attacked, just FYI
---
But yeah it's an issue that without Ruin a killer can't have any bad chases. Maybe a Nurse or a Billy can, but the others? Nah.
---
Killers have extremely little room for any error at all.
---
Thank you for the support! I honestly couldn't tell if this was a good idea or I was way too tired lmao
---
Making rank based on surviving and killing will lead to nothing but toxicity in a community that‚Äôs toxic enough as is. 
---
Noed is a problem because not only do you have to do 5 totems yourself while doing everything else. If you miss 1 and they gen rush which you cannot stop then now the killer cant get an easy 4k because noed rewards the killer for not doing their objective and pressuring gens.
---
I made one for my own chapter. If you wanna read it, link is below.
---
[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wrr\_D4MKE0Uluw3LavIdKblNFYsMTARiF0ZLC4Qmyqw/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wrr_D4MKE0Uluw3LavIdKblNFYsMTARiF0ZLC4Qmyqw/edit)
---
The thing is I'm not talking about every game. Just games where you get survivors that are dedicated to gens. Tons of games survivors fool around and don't do gens. It's the games where they focus on them even when injured. That's when there isn't a thing you can do.
---
platform and how often you ply killer and survivor
---
Why would killers be afraid of topsoil?
---
Hiding until you leave to finish the gen. You don't want to waste time looking too long
---
Thanks guys
---
Im just saying he shouldn't derank because he yelled at jen for deranking. No matter the reasoning. He was strongly against it. And made it quite clear. 
---
Derank
---
So youre saying it takes you longer to find totems and cleanse them. Than it takes for you to gen rush?
---
Huh? I'm just saying that if they do gens and ignore healing they will win most of the time.
---
I had this happen to me as well, and I escaped
---
Moonwalking only works on The Legion because of the Deep Wound timer. Increasing Killers movement speed by **4%** isn't that crazy of an idea.
---
Just saying it's a gray area the way you're going about it.  Get caught being a care bear to a survivor in front of other still alive survivors you attempt to kill and I'm just telling you don't be surprised if you get reported and catch salt for it.  There are other ways to go about doing exactly what you're doing without being overt about it.
---
Finding and doing all totems WHILE unhooking/being chased/being hooked is longer than gen rushing.
---
Camping and tunneling is part of the game, and so is leveling for teachables. There is no easy short term fix to always survive as survivor.
---
\&gt;Not playing both survivor and killer, realizing that both sides have cheesy, game-breaking shit that ultimately ruins this game's potential to be genuinely competitive
---
aww and he has that real life money brown shirt for immersion as well. what a baby
---
Yeah you are right, I will fix that thanks
---
Maybe if we got a fuckin icon that shows how many totems are left, I‚Äôd bother doing them. Totems only work out with SWF. And no I‚Äôm not running fuckin Small game, don‚Äôt tell me to run a meme perk because NOED is bullshit. 
---
It‚Äôs to get you to play other survivors that‚Äôs all. 
---
You should.
---
So thats all happening to you or do you not have 3 other teammates?
---
Encourage levelling all survivors/get their perks, try new builds on different survivors because you don't have x perk(s) on Claudette or whatever
---
Time stopping on hook when killer is nearby would be abused, but maybe if the time run slowly it would actually help. 
---
Imagine being able to use god pallet multiple times a match. I‚Äôm sure this perk has potential but they wouldn‚Äôt use it for the sole reason that a portion of the perk is a direct upgrade to windows of opportunity.
---
good question, but why are Killer dailies tied to specific killers? I want to hit intoxicated survs as Myers.
---
No offense but that is the stupidest comment I've seen. Toxicity will always exist. And if can rank up even dying as survivor, or can rank up without kills as killer, then the system is fucking flawed.
---
And if you need pips to encourage fair play, the actual gameplay is still flawed.
---
they do listen to the community, but they're experimenting where they actially should. like after every major patch, they're fucked.
---
These new skins are getting out of hand
---
What program and stuff do you use? I love the texture of the brush you used
---
It would be nice to have this work for dropped pallets and lockers aswell.
---
Yes, you are, glad we can agree on something
---
Survivors do offer free hits my Congo Line loving fan but let‚Äôs not forget this is not true altruism to the killer. Survivors get another chase escape BP bump when doing this! üòâ Make no mistake killers know this as well! üòé
---
I didn‚Äôt realize the devs added a jump button! üòÜ
---
Killers that complain about Gen Rushing are garbo killers. How dare the survivors play the objective?!!?!?
---
I‚Äôm like 90% sure this is a joke but if it isn‚Äôt, absolutely not.
---
I caught the last survivor last night because they stopped to teabag at the exit. I got her with the clowns potion and managed to down her an inch away from safety. I was laughing so much. 
---
TFW you glad you suck with survivor and mainly play killer
---
Damn, that's a lot. I always leave the lobby if the ping is higher than 200.
---
Maybe taking away his built-in BBQ on slept survivors but make it a little harder to wake up?
---
I think one way to solve this is it will light up after the first skillcheck.Like how NOED gets lit up after all gens are powered.
---
Other hexes can be solved differently,like DH lighting up after the first token,that way killer will at least get some use out of it.
---
My bad, forgot the s/.
---
I was thinking that as well!
---
Yeah, the daily system sucks and needs a total revamp, but I never see anyone talking about how awful it is.
---
I guess we‚Äôll just have to agree to disagree, because I can‚Äôt say I expect Tru3 to just not play killer because he told Jen off for being morally unjust. 
---
Tru3 isn‚Äôt deranking so he can get easy matches and bully bad players to look good, Tru3 is dropping rank so he doesn‚Äôt have to wait half an hour before he can play a match, because you and I both know just how exciting it would be to join Tru3‚Äôs stream and watch him wait for a lobby for about half the time the stream is up. 
---
The whole deranking debacle came from a time where queue times were just fine in the high ranks, and it feels kinda odd to be justifying it now but I can‚Äôt sit here and compare Jen‚Äôs slimy behavior to Tru3 just wanting to play the game he makes his career out of.
---
Yeah this is kinda gross 
---
Don‚Äôt even waste your time with this guy lol. He‚Äôs so ridiculously biased on balance and bug issues I can‚Äôt help but wonder if he‚Äôs just a troll.
---
E.T. fail skillcheck 
---
oh ok. Makes sense
---
i got the pig recently and she's been a ton of fun and has given me the confidence to play killer again. i guess i have this strange fear of toxic survivors and being looped so it's refreshing that i play a killer without that fear and i can actually get things done as them. the only con is that ive run into a ton of salty disconnects, and right when i was gonna unlock adept piggy
---
oink
---
&gt;You realize he is terrible right? 
---
It's not because a killer is terrible that they are fun to play against
---
&gt;His power doesn‚Äôt help with chases and it is actually advantageous to survivors because it basically reads ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt hit a survivor who you haven‚Äôt used this on 10 seconds in advance‚Äù.
---
And survivors can't really hide from him, so it's an unfun power for both sides, more reason to change it.
---
&gt;but he moves at 4.4 speed and can still be looped. 
---
Please fact check first, he has a movement speed of 4.6m/s or 115%. Buffing his movement speed would make him the fastest base movementspeed killer. But in your defence, his addon "red paint brush" does reduce his movement speed to 4.4m/s or 110%.
---
Buffing him would only reduce the fun factor if you ask me. If you remove certain parts of the kit and give him the teleportation rework, I think he has a better chance at becomming a more viable and fun killer
---
Is that supposed to be Zabuza? 
---
Luck of the draw.  They're the strongest effects possible in game so thems the risks.  To be fair a lot of the new totem spawns are considerably better than they used to be.
---
i thought it was Zabuza
---
Dying? I see him more than Freddy.
---
My personal idea for freddy is to be able to link 2 objects of the same type together. When the survivor interacts with the object they would be teleported to the other, ending up on freddys side of it. In addition freddy could also use lockers he has linked. 
---
I don't know, I just find beyond retarded bragging about not being able to read
---
The real question is, why wouldn't they be afraid of topsoil. It's malicious
---
I wouldn't fix it, I don't really care about these perks. Just saying they're not balanced.

They balanced it pretty nicely now with the increase to 5 seconds.  I didn't really run it before because I always saw it as pretty cheap and unfair but now that it's been adjusted to counter hard tunneling off hook I really like it and plan on using it myself at times.
---
Thats weird since it was spammed when it actually happened almost 2 days ago. Even was on the frontpage.
---
I love the art style.  Neat idea.

Context is that I went to a Japanese cosplay festival yesterday and I didn't have an anime/game inspired cosplay ready other than Michael. Rolled with it and people loved it
---
Reverse it and its a pig meme
---
Yeah especially the original ones which is what I have but I'm saving for a nice pc 
---
I can deal with all of those, but what's made me hardly play at all is the fact that after the plague patch I get kicked from 1/3 of my games as survivor and if I'm on killer someone else gets kicked 100% of the time. I'm not talking ragequits, I mean the game boots you.
---
Legion would have a field day xDDD
---
Fucking deserved. Real nice when people who are dicks for no reason get a nice helping of karma.
---
[Song lyrics related.](https://youtu.be/SJkj3DgW8Y0?t=43)
---
A lucky one, I could of easily missed on the turn. Especially on console.
---
The problem I see with those dc's is that there isn't a bug crash message, which gives the devs the information in details. After the plague coming out, I only got to report 2 times, when the game actually crashed but there isn't such thing when character models are giant, making really hard to see anything both as survivor or killer. Or when there's this annoying wiggle bar that makes the survivors stop mid running for no reason, or when survivors load into a game with no HUD whatsover, or when they can't heal their teammate.
---
There's so much in game bugs that won't make impossible to play but it does make the match frustating, for both parties, resulting in DC. 
---
In with you though, its not like we don't notice people abusing this, dcing only when they get hit or quittibg when about to lose the match
---
No this is certainly a hack.
---
I mean, the Freddy nerf was pretty shit. But I dont mean people like the thousands of people in this subreddit. I mean the people that have been playing since release and are well trusted among the community. Yet they are constantly ignored by the devs in favor of adding more content. 
---
Mori me senpai uwu
---
So survivors aren‚Äôt supposed to do their main objective so you don‚Äôt DC? You‚Äôre part of the reason this community is so toxic. 
---
A David I was playing against DCd mid-chase and went flying into the air. I looked up at him in wonder and laughed. I love glitches. 
---
I wonder why it was nerfed tho
---
The end game screen leaderboard shows base points. Otherwise every killer would get past 32k with BBQ. Post game only shows on your side
---
It's so cute take my upvote!!
---
Oh man, if you like quiet, stay far away from David. Have you heard that motherfucker cleansing a totem? I thought he was injured! 
---
1: Doing totems solo play is good because you get 600 bloodpoints for a totem anyway.
---
2: NOED punishes Adrenaline and greedy survivors that don't do totems. It doesn't reward failure, you will still depip if by a big margin because NOED basically gives you one additional hook event.
---
3: NOED literally does nothing until the gates are powered. Until the gates are powered, you are literally playing against a 3 perk killer, and you have the option of making them a 3 perk killer for the ENTIRE game. 
---
But nurse is OP :D
---
Recently have been feeling really tired of being a Survivor main for the last 2 Years, especially solo given how poor and unfair it can be currently. Switched to killer, maining Amanda with some Rin on the side and I‚Äôm LOVING IT. I‚Äôm not very good and I need bloodhound to help me track so bad but even in my bad games where I only get 1 or no kills I‚Äôm still enjoying it. I‚Äôd probably get more if I tunneled or camped but meh it‚Äôs still more points hooking everyone a few times than it would be in any given match as feng Min 
---
Obviously there‚Äôs a risk attached but there needs to be a limit. Some shit like this is not okay. And no it‚Äôs really not better at all. 
---
I thought they added dedicated servers this year?
---
Fair enough :)
---
I understand and absolutely despise the bugs. Although many bugs would be fixed if they brought back the old hitboxes. And u also know that's why DCing cant be the top priority for the devs, it should be fixing all the bugs, which is what of the majority of the community wants. (I also want to specify that when I say community, I dont mean the people that have been playing for only a few months and think they're pros, I mean people that have played since release and are well trusted)
---
With that I agree
---
And there he is again.  You told me I was completely untrue when I said there are some phenomenal totem spawns post rework.  You said that.  I said some not all.  You shot that down in a blanket statement claiming them all to be shit which is not true man not even a little bit. One plead spawn pictured does bot apply to every placement.  How are you not getting this.  You deal in nothing but absolutes.  EVERYTHING is either shit or EVERYTHING is either good with you.  There is so much in between you completely dismiss.
---
Had this bug about two weeks ago?? I think I was the only one who could see it. Made the game impossible to play lol
---
Relatively easy to look up, I think. You can even download SFM and find the Legion workshop uploads for the easy 3D viewing. 
---
If that doesn't tickle your fancy, PM me in 6 hours and I'll get a couple of angles for you. 
---
Oh my bad... I haven‚Äôt been keeping up with this game much as of late.
---
The only thing you got downvoted for was for saying camping wasn't camping. Trash opinions are nothing to do with being survivor or killer. 
---
I've been a big supporter of making Freddy's power similar to the doctors in terms of illusions popping up 
---
Leaving and then coming back later isn‚Äôt camping. You‚Äôre literally giving their teammates a chance to unhook. What‚Äôs so hard to understand?
---
I knew that much, but I dont know anything about who they are or what input they provided. Or if their input was anything like what the rest of the community from release wants. 
---
Dw man. I am not immersed despite my perks. I do gens frequently an can loop and mindgame killers. Being immersed does nothing.
---
I mean it‚Äôs risky to loop after the pallet is dropped
---

---
Some people are just toxic cunts whose only source of validation in life is to spread their misery onto others any way they can.

Not too powerful, it‚Äôs mainly to prevent looping after a pallet drops-somewhat

***SCP 096 HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT***
---
I‚Äôve gotten stuck on a tree several times as a survivor and it never occurred to me that it could happen to killers! I mean, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs much rarer since killers have no reason to become one with a tree usually. Sorry about the scumbag Ash. I‚Äôve only ever had one killer find me on a tree and show me mercy (thanks again for carrying me to the exit gate if you‚Äôre out there, Plague). 
---
That‚Äôs like most of looping. Looping primarily happens when the pallet is dropped and the killer refuses to break it. This would be like noed levels of crutch perk.

Yup :) even though it's really hard to make Autodidact work with randoms, they usually run away when they see the negative healing, thinking that you failed a skill check or something.
---
I really don't know, as you're the one who can't seem to understand it. "Coming back to check on the hooked survivor" is still camping. You're coming back to either interfere with them being unhooked, or worse tunnel them once unhooked, so it doesn't matter if you're one foot away or ten. And just to be clear, you're entitled to play that way if you want to, it's your prerogative. But other people are entitled to call you out on it, and that's the part you can't seem to handle.
---
I feel like the huntress thinks her ping is normal
---
I've got 550 hours in DBD, with all but ~30 of those as survivor. And I've kobe'd twice, ever. One of which was last week, after having this game since 2017.
---
Enduring is a soft counter unless you're going against a legitimately terrible survivor. It definitely helps, but 2 and a half seconds is more than enough time to get to a safe pallet or a vault and reset the chase.
---
I mean, legion is pretty easily dealt with. Yes he can vault pallets and etcetera but if you're good at baiting. You can hit him out of his feral frenzy. Also, if you realize he's just trying to follow the blood, trick him. Get ahead and then double back. Move into heavy grass patches. There are plenty of counters. I'm a survivor main myself and see no problem. If anything I think the spirit is far worse especially with the add on to make her silent in phase walk. Getting instantly yanked off gens or totems is frustrating. You literally go from full health to being hooked in the span of 5 seconds. At least with legion if he hits me with his ability I can attempt to run him around the map. If he's moon walking then I  double back and trick him with these mind games. I feel like the only reason that people hate legion so much is because he is a killer that actually challenges players to stay hidden and do more than run in a tight circle around a pallet. 
---
I was getting tired of the chibi art till this. Mirin‚Äô that texture work. It looks almost otherworldly too like Twilight Myers or something lol nice 
---
It's a bit embarrassing if you get downed by a Leatherface before a single gen is done... 
---
Good job.
---
The Game has always had decent amounts of pallets, now it's insane. I've counted as many as thirty pallets on that map. And the map was only ever strong for killer because rooms were closed off - now every room is open, so it makes it expedites the pallet problem even more. Everywhere you go on that map you will find a pallet.
---
&gt; NOED rewards failure
---
is mutually exclusive with
---
&gt; It doesn't reward failure, you will still depip for failing during gen phase
---
I like this killer a lot, the only thing I would change is for regret, the chances are %50/%60/%70 so it isn't too op.
---
I didn't know they added Pagan Min to dead by daylight 
---
Very nice and neat idea 
---
It was more the downvoting/ one comment for no reason. You were posting your accomplishments on a Dead by Daylight sub, and good on you is my whole point.
---
You be surprised tbh played a few games at r4 yesterday still fooled some people.
---
That wasn't my point.
---
My point is NOED punishes adrenaline and greedy survivors that don't do totems. NOED also rewards failure, because it only works on alive survivors after all 5 generators have been done.
---
Surveillance is better imo. Sometimes it is critical to guard a specific generator and surveillance lets you do it from a distance.
---
I wouldn't replace either for ruin though, personally.
---
unrelenting... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
yeah, I first made it as a hex perk but they said it would be too trashy so I removed the hex, probably the chances would be better as you said
---
Of course, sorry; I thought survivors completing the objective was them winning - my mistake.
---
Unrelenting is only good at the highest ranks, but only once or twice before the survivors figure it out. You can get a fast hit on someone that relies on your missed cooldown duration being consistent. 
---
With all the random window ledge and corner hits though, it might have more use with M1 killers again. Until they fix the window hit boxes. 
---
Not totally true. I know it‚Äôs kind of splitting hairs but structures like the disturbed ward can spawn like 3 safe pallets and one regular pallet

Own it on PC, Xbox One and PS4. On PC and Xbox I don't have issues but on PS4 it's harder.
---
OwO what's this pointy thing
---
Legion just with base kit is easily counted as well.....
---
I guess the counter to freddy would be pallets then. Just like every other M1 killer.
---
Oh wait.
---
Then I guess your point is that you're working with a flawed definition of failure. 
---
Without Frank's mixtape the legion is easily countered honestly
---
This looks like it‚Äôd be a good map for dbd
---
If you are comparing a killer with top tier addons with one without you are totally playing favorites. A Legion with their addons is way worse than a Spirit.
---
I consider failure as a survivor as dying regardless of pips or bloodpoints. It's not a flawed definition if it's the common definition.
---
I don‚Äôt disagree.
---
Just got out of a match where I had Brand New Part/Spring Clamp combo on an Engineer's Toolbox and the killer was running Ruin. Nailed both my skill checks - but I got zero Gen progression. The Brand New Part stayed on my toolbox until I abandoned that gen and then disappeared.
---
Anybody else ever experienced that? Super frustrating. Basically just wasted a BNP for nothing.

How so? At least a legion I can counter play. What counter play is there to a killer who is invisible, completely silent, and able to RIP you off gens? If we're comparing add ons... spirit is worse. Without add ons. Legion is no better than any other top tier killer without add ons. He's easily countered

I didn't talk about Jen once, so stop putting words in my mouth. I said the "mentality of bullying lower ranks." It only is associated with people with that mentality.
---
I'd love to see this happen. However. Freddy needs this far more than them and this hasn't happened yet. So. Yeah.
---
Yes when i see a tote m i cleanse it
---
Yes but do you cleanse E v e r y totem
---
That‚Äôs cause most of them are.
---
Underatand that its still 4 or 3 of you. Its not like everytime its endgame the doors spawn right next to each other. I know that happens sometimes but not everytime. Probably not even the majority.
---
It's actually fairly easy to avoid the Corrupt Purge when you have something to loop around. You're not going to figure out how to counter the Plague by being pissy and quitting.
---
I used Procreate on Ipad Pro with free to download Jingsketch brushes. I mainly used a chalk brush for this piece :)
---
Thank you so much!
---
Dev's said some phrases in the game are decipherable. Apparently the Entity has a language.
---
There is an addon for maps which allows yoi to mark a certain spot on the map so other survivors can see it. The killer can‚Äôt see this.
---
Sometimes I don't know what survivors want. If I'm nurse like usual, I'm unfun. If I play Billy they're "sick of Billy". If I play spirit, she's deemed overpowered. Huntress? Nope. Ranged attacks are unfair. Plague? Nope. They don't like corrupt purge. Hag? No matter what I do I'm a camper. Survivors seem to hate every killer in the game besides the fucking Trapper.
---
No. So if the killer runs noed then its my teams fault to include my self that we didnt cleanse all the totems
---
Mate Thats normal
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me to run a good counter! I‚Äôm busy being entitled!‚Äù
---
I usually cleanse around 3 totems even without small game and still get other stuff done. You guys need to stop being so ridiculous 
---
Both are good with spirit+prayer beads
---
You made a comment telling them to cleanse totems 
---
Well youd be delighted to know my ash build is self care, tenacity, meddle of man, flip flop
---
I enjoy playing all of those killers. Legion is the only killer I don‚Äôt enjoy other than a face camping leatherface. 
---
Most concerns with the Xmas Bugroo fiasco is that Bahroo was made aware of the bug at least a couple days before he revealed it but chose to wait until the devs began their extended Xmas shutdown/vacation to reveal. Many other streamers were also aware of the bug for far longer and never made any reference about it publicly until after Bahroo blew it wide open.
---
Hell, it was a pretty infamous exploit amongst the late night players I often ran into in the red ranks. It needed attention to get the devs on it obviously, just not at the very hour after the devs locked the doors for a month. 
---
Halloween. It's a licensed dlc. You can buy Feng with shards or just wait the shrine
---
I'd say bhvr should consider hiring you.
---
I'd be down for this.
---
Yeah the fucking point is that sometimes I‚Äôll proc even if you really go after it. You fucking players just want a guaranteed counter every single game
---
Yeah, it's like the more valuable the offering the higher chance the game dies.
---
Yeah...? I said if you have a problem with NOED cleanse the totems. I dont care about NOED so whether or not im caught i dont care. Im logical though how can you rework a pwrk that has so multiple counters to it already?
---

You could've jumped in the hatch when she first injured you

---
It's the Entity
---
my computer can't handle sfm unfortunately
---
but if you can I would really appreciate 
---
Seeing the comments, I'll probably buy the Halloween DLC first. However, let me ask, what is Feng Min's cosmetic for buying the DLC over using shards?
---
Very nice. My only criticism is the lips don't really feel like they belong. Could do without or otherwise make them less of a presence. 
---
Otherwise, I love the color palette 
---
huntress actually requires aim.
---
I did google it, but all I get are pictures that aren't viewed from above, soo I can't trace the knife to cut it in real life
---
rank 17, gg
---
No, the game only loaded 2 people in.
---
If you check the Generator/Survivor HUD on the bottom, only 2 people are shown. If there were 4, they would have either had Escape/Sacrifice/Disconnect icons.
---
The players who never loaded in are shown regardless of quitting/lagging out.
---
Thank you. I‚Äôm always trying to improve my art so the criticism is always welcome 
---
"Never playing killer" is an epidemic in this community tbh.
---
You should probably play some Plague before saying shit because you have no idea what you're talking about. Landing Corrupt is not as easy as you think
---
Ya but Google Translate or whatever that is definitely isn't the answer lol
---
The fact that you can sacrifice all four survivors and still barely safety pip is fucking stupid. By trying to "discourage campers" they fucked killer ranks up the ass. 
---
I just realized you're the person who thinks Spirit isn't counterable without beads. You're abjectly absurd 
---
Since you want for killer and one for survivor I would suggest getting whichever you play the most.
---
Those are the counters, small game, detectives hunch, map with yellow wire, just walking around, swf. Why!? Why do you guys care so mich about NOED when.it cant even be a thing if every survivor tries to cleanse one totem not 3 not 4. ONE TOTEM EACH PERSON!!! And then you can cleanse the last one. I mean im all for having discussion but this a agrument that too survivor sided. I can support or like a rework for a perk that can be stopped before and after its activated. 
---
Feng will have the same base outfits regardless of which way you buy it.
---
I never said she isn't able to be countered without beads...I said there is no counter to the beads
---
There‚Äôs no counterplay to legion, at least not in chases. 
---
Wrong. If you played a competent survivor like me and my swf we would wreck you like we did zubat and ardetha
---
Oh, okay. I was under the impression that buying a DLC instead of using shards would give you an additional cosmetic suit for the character and killer. 
---
I personally prefer discordance because;
---
- It provides more information than Surveillance. Not only does it tell you what gen survivors work on, it also tells you that half or more of the survivor team are working on a single gen.
---
- Being able to be aware of where half a survivor team is at a given time can allow you to make a mental map of where the other survivors are. For example if you are chasing a survivor &amp; discordance lights up, you know which gen to pressure after finishing the chase.
---
- It can allow you to apply pressure to gens that survivors are really focussing on. Combining perks like Pop or overcharge can allow you to remove significant progress on specific gens
---
- It is amazing for kick-starting a game. Considering how survivors will usually start together, they will usually congregate onto one gen at the beginning of the match. This can allow you to quickly locate your first survivors &amp; apply pressure fast.
---
- You do not have to waste time kicking gens to apply its effect. This saves a lot of time considering kicking a gen requires around 3 seconds without brutal. This accumulates over the match. 
---
- Surveillance can give false positives. For example survivors might tap gens then run away from it which gives you false information. This can be abused by survivors that figure out that you have surveillance to wase your time.
---
I like surveillance for stealth-based killers that can ambush survivors who are working on regressing gens. Not being a stealth killer usually means surveillance works as a relatively weak tracking perk as you cannot get free hits from survivors.
---
Discordance is best for all killers IMO. That initial pressure of pushing off 2 survivors from a generator is really strong &amp; can net you multiple downs if the other survivor remains too close or you have an instant down ability. 
---
Discordance also provides an idea on the progression of a gen. This can give you the information you need to use perks like pop or overcharge.
---
I would not consider them replacements for ruin. Although the perks are both great tracking perks, it does not really slow down the gens as most of your time is wasted chasing survivors rather than looking for them. 
---
Discordance is great for the beginning of the game as long as you can down someone before the first generator is complete. 
---
Surveillance is good during mid to late game when you are trying to guard specific gens. Still inferior to discordance though In my opinion.
---
1.) why waste a perk slot on small game, it‚Äôs terrible
---
2.)same goes for detectives hunch
---
3.)why use a map?
---
4.)walking around the whole game instead of doing gens is just annoying 
---
5.) positive here‚Äôs more than 4 totems a match and not everyone‚Äôs gonna know to cleanse a totem not everyone plays survive with friends 
---
You can still loop a legion and out think him. If he's using federal frenzy then don't drop pallets until you're sure you'll hit. If you get stabbed and have deep wounds and he continues to chase you then your timer doesn't deplete. If he does dip off, then find a building to duck out on him. Don't just run in a straight line and then wonder how he continued to follow you. 
---
No, they haven't fixed it yet.
---
That's metal as hell  :)
---
Your comment reads like you did in context of OP's post. OP was complaining about Plague not being counterable and you said:
---
&gt; I think the spirit is worse. Especially with the add on that makes her silent in phase walk. 
---
A proper reading in context of OP's post would mean that you're saying Spirit is worse for being non-counterable and that beads aggravate it further 
---
It always looks like that when you‚Äôre spectating. Also farming is the most boring thing in the world and while I‚Äôll do it out of mercy, I don‚Äôt blame any killer who doesn‚Äôt want to farm cause they got four 3 man games in a row.
---
Nice drawing. I'm not a big fan of the whole character + cutesy/miniturized format that has been taking place over the past however many years. Like those one little action figure things I see in Gamestop.
---
We're you also choking?
---
That sounds fair, since if you‚Äôre at a broken pallet that would usually mean there‚Äôs no safe spaces nearby so there‚Äôs great risk to it but it would be annoying to have it happen across the map mid-chase constantly, where you can‚Äôt really do anything about it
---
Oh yeah.
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt DC after getting caught once, even if it‚Äôs against a killer I don‚Äôt like.‚Äù- world‚Äôs strongest survivor.
---
What would make him... new then? Billy runs and bubba swings
---
At least safety pip it‚Äôs not fair that you derank because of something out of your control.
---
I had no idea and I love him now 
---
If your post gets 50 upvotes, I'll make a survivor variant of this meme

It was a genuinely question, lol.

I'm P E R P L E X E D by some survivors. This dude sent the message, not me. I'd have gone on about my business. 
---
There should be a counter to the biggest crutch perk in the game.  NOED is for trash players man.  It completely stunts the developement of learning how to play killer.  It's gameplanning to fail everytime you bring it into a match.  Aim to end every game with gens up and equip a loadout accordingly to aid in accomplishing this.  It's far more impressive than simply relying on a safety net to bail you out when you fail to protect your objectives.  
---
I started reading this and all I could think of was the [engineer taunt from tf2.](https://youtu.be/MfTMYEFaXt8)
---
I don't even use Ruin. You do not need to lecture me on how NOED is a crutch. All I'm saying is that there is a perfect adequate counter but you guys do not give a fuck and want a perfect 100 percent guaranteed counter
---
Why does she think it‚Äôs bad? Tbh console is a lot easier to play as killer than PC I find?
---
Zombie can't find any brains there, so he leaves. 
---
Looking at the numbers, I'm guessing the blades supposed effect when stacked is to increase the base time of 22 seconds by 60%.
---
When the blades have been patched, they should increase mending from 22 seconds to a final mend time of 35 seconds. 
---
Thanks for testing this out. This was something desperately needing to be highlighted for the devs to look at.
---
Aren't they already? That's all I see on ps4 is billy n legion
---
How often do you play killer? Just curious. Because what I am talking about is NOT the traditional reasons survivors DC. I am referring to the crazy uptick in survivors DCing even when they‚Äôre clearly winning and not about to be downed or hooked.
---
I get that it‚Äôs frustrating to be DCed against, but there‚Äôs more at work here and if you ignore it because you think it‚Äôs all just salt, the game will stay broken.
---
I welcome you to join my project of messaging the people who DC under suspicious circumstances and you‚Äôll see most of them think YOU DCed. It‚Äôs just fucked right now.

Anyway...peach

In which game can Myers hit INTOXICATED survs?
---
Happened complitely accidentally. Sorry for the terrible video quality.
---
*What is clown doing with that stump* 
---
oh ok thx op just used it weird
---
Had a game on coldwind farms against a huntress. The beginning of the game was kinda okayish. Everyone but me had gotten hooked once by the time we got 2 gens done. She had lullaby and was up to 4 stacks now. Just as I was about to get unhooked, Ace decided to dc right in front of me. Someone else had just gotten hooked giving killer 5 lullaby stacks making skill checks painfully unfun. That person ended up getting hooked again leaving just me and Claudette left to complete 3 gens. I'm on a single person gen in the corner of the map and I end up completing getting lucky that huntress didn't see me. Claudette completed one gen on the other side of the map. So we have 1 gen left and each have 1 hook remaining. I start to head towards her to look for the last gen, but end up getting caught by huntress. She slugs me and eventually gets Claudette. The match went on for like 20-25 mins. It was really fun. Huntress said her totem was near one gen that I completed, but I couldn't find it. Overall one of my most fun survivor games.

Not cleansing is the way to go 100%. I will last much longer as a one shot than I will against a corrupt purge. Being 1 shot isn‚Äôt a big deal. If you cleanse against Plague you‚Äôre a newb. 
---
I never understood this. Survivors can't tbag because it's toxic, but Killers can nod their had at you after they down you and it's fine? 
---
I play killer all the time and can say that 95% of the frequent DCs I see are survivors purposely disconnecting. 
---
It will but not at 60fps. Just set it on low and maybe drop the resolution to 90%. you should get around 50fps
---
4k doesn't always = good plays

survivors are braindead

This is a joke right?

That is so freakin awesome. I CRAVE 2 KILLERS MODE SO BAD
---
i want to  level up david king first to get more bloodpoints, but without self care sucks
---
Technically it‚Äôs supposed to not be rng based. It‚Äôs supposed to pick a box at random and you can only find the key in that box but that seems like a lie.
---
I would say all of them. But I like the game. Survivors are just skins so only the perks matter there. With killers you get splinters as you level other killers which let you try them out
---
If you enjoy both as you say  letherface dlc for killer since his perks help especially BBQ and Chili is an amazing grinding xp perk. And the others are you have to research what survivor perks you want. Each dlc pack comes with a survivor and killer except letherface and ash vs evil dead.
---
Hell, optimistic, ain't ya? There are *lots* of potential memes to reformat. 
---
But in all honesty, I'm thinking of calling it at Day 100. We'll see how things look from there, really. The amount of *quality* memes that I can come up with gets tougher and tougher each week.

Die a hero or live long enough to see yourself be the villain, y'know?
---
When did cosmetics for buying a dlc start?

I know! Me too. That was the best game i‚Äôve ever had.

All depends on the killer and their perks and the survivors perks. Whatever ones you find to be the most interesting should be the ones you get
---
Hex: What The Hell
---
When you read this post you take 5/10/15 seconds to try to understand what does it mean.
---
Whether or not the killer is bad is a different issue than whether SWF is fair. SWF objectively subverts game mechanics. It's blatantly unfair.
---
I know! Thats why this game was the best i‚Äôve ever had
---
Here‚Äôs this post again. 
---
And some killers can't get kills even with NOED. Just because there are SWF teams that suck doesn't mean that SWF isn't a game balance and mechanics issue
---
That was the point of the experiment, if it was a predetermined box the results should came out looking like 25% found it in the first box 25 % find it in the 2nd 25% for the 3rd and 25% for the fourth, but the results came out looking like 50 % for the first 25% for the second 10% for third 5% last with the dropped numbers having died or dced
---
This is true. As of recently, I swear even in games that I make little to no mistakes at all during chases, there is 3 gens popping before I even finish my second chase. I‚Äôve been trying to play without ruin for quite some time now and it‚Äôs pretty difficult if you‚Äôre not an almost insta down killer or have map pressure like billy, spirit, and nurse at high rank. People just absolutely fly through gens
---
Dude what the hell! Who won you or the other killer? 
---
No. A small percentage of survivors could be called toxic considering the fact they are barely allowed to do anything anymore. The reason campers exist is because there is no downside to it. You still get kills, points and a pip if you camp. Give a group of people too much freedom and they will abuse it. It's the same shit that happened in the early days with insta blinds and all that crap.
---
The point of hexes are that they're op versions of perks with downsides. That downside is it being destroyed early. Sure, they shouldn't spawn right next to where a survivor loads in, but they definitely shouldn't change the totem spawns. You risk it spawning in a crappy place or a hard-to-find place. And they definitely should not be buffed to that capacity. In the same vein, NOED should light up the first time a survivor is hit (Of course it won't activate until end game). 
---
Fuckass
---
Today i ran Devour Hope and Haunted Ground. As I eqquiped them I thought "I'm sure this meme of a perk will be the first to be cleansed". Guess what happened.
---
He's just deranking to stay around rank 3. For some reason when he was rank 1 he can't find any games as killer.

We let the survivors go. We were able to tag team them so quickly. Fun af

You act like she deranks all the way back to 15. I highly doubt those players rank 10-5 just got the game. The rest of what you said I do agree with. I watched noob3 play killer and I don‚Äôt think he ever got a lobby of red rank survivors. Pretty sad state right now.
---
‚ÄúAlmost solo‚Äù so not solo? 
---
Also 3 =/= 5 totems
---
*and you‚Äôre bad
---
And you verify this by reaching out to the surv? You do realize a lot of the time, they think you DCed? 
---
Ruin is for shit players lol ok
---
1:23 holy shit that‚Äôs terrifying lmao 
---
Not 100% sure as both Jake and Nea had perks to counter them (Calm Spirit and Urban Evasion). 
---
You sound like you can‚Äôt play Plague well. She can actively move while charging up her vomit, use Vile Purge on pallets and windows to force an infection even if the survivor has a high enough loop to avoid the streams (which isn‚Äôt that common except on Coldwind and Macmillian‚Äôs) and once they become broken it becomes extremely easy to down someone via mindgames and just not respecting pallets. 
---
If you can see yourself playing killer get leatherface for BBQ 
---
Other than that maybe get hag for even more meta perks.
---
For survivor the default ones give good perks, if you want even more than probably ash and feng would give good perks.
---
For DLC, I would recommend what killer you think both looks the best &amp; has perks that you really like.
---
if you are going for killers that have a skill ceiling but are really good, I would go for;
---
Of Flesh &amp; Mud - Hag DLC
---
- Killer is very strong with being able to place traps that when triggered allows her to teleport to them. Gives her amazing map pressure in the game &amp; allows you to jumpscare people.
---
- Her perks are really good &amp; will help you play greatly when playing killer
---
- The survivor, Ace, isn't that good. His perks are only really for searching chests. His other perks are rather weak &amp; don't provide much of a noticeable benefit.
---
Shattered Bloodline - Spirit
---
- Killer has the ability to phase out of the game &amp; move really fast which can allow her to catch up with survivors or transverse the map faster. Her power has a high skill ceiling as the survivors disappear meaning she has to rely on the environment &amp; sounds to show where a survivor is. While phasing survivors cannot see her but can hear that she is phasing meaning they have no idea where you are.
---
- Her perks are quite alright. One is a trapped totem perk that is good if combined with other hex perks. Rancor is a nice tracking perk that allows you to kill your obsession at the end. Spirit fury is great for quickly getting rid of pallets. Amazing if combined with enduring as killer to eat through pallets fast.
---
- The Survivor is alright. His perk Deliverance allows you to unhook yourself if you unhooked someone before you were hooked. Can be amazing for escaping a camper. His other perks are pretty bad. One allows you to heal other people really fast but relies on skill checks &amp; another allows him to throw a rock &amp; distract the killer.
---
My personal favorite DLC was the Halloween one.
---
- Michael Myers is a fun killer to play &amp; has an amazing aesthetic. Is chase music is also really good &amp; is different from the rest of the killers.
---
- The survivor is not that great.
---
The best DLC avaialble though if you like killer &amp; want the game to be less of a grind is the leatherface DLC.
---
- The killer is alright but his perks are amazing.
---
- One of his perks allows you to gain 100% bonus bp during matches while playing killer if you hook everyone atleast once.
---
- His other perks are really fun to use
---
I would like a predator DLC. Many possibilities 
---
Hag leather face and shape
---
True though sometimes it does glitch and hits you they just need to fix hitbox but I doubt that would happen 
---
So u are rank 20 and expect survivors to be good at the game? 
---
OP trying any other killer after playing Huntress: *I am speed*
---
Idk.
---
Chainsaw massacre and Halloween 
---
Ash doesn‚Äôt even need his chainsaw or boomstick to fuck up legion 
---
Well either you‚Äôre lying or you‚Äôre facing shit killers. What rank are you?
---
&gt;Legion has literally no counterplay besides small jukes and mind games that have small effect on him because of the nature of his power.
---
Thanks for the laugh, oh my god my sides are hurting.
---
We both spawned right by eachother (like 2-3 meters between). I could not hear heartbeat or anything. When we both used bell ability it kinda glithed the animation but otherwise there was no problems.
---
Aight so how do you consistently loop a legion?
---
The best thing I‚Äôve read about the plague was that ‚Äúshe‚Äôs like if you gave the huntress a flamethrower‚Äù and Ash is groovy
---
Same lol its so fun trying to play with weird glitches 
---
You sound like you can't avoid her well lmao
---
&gt; She can actively move while charging up her vomit
---
And slows when holding it. Her charge doesn't take long so the speed boost is totally meaningless.
---
&gt;  use Vile Purge on pallets and windows to force an infection even if the survivor has a high enough loop to avoid the streams (which isn‚Äôt that common except on Coldwind and Macmillian‚Äôs) and once they become broken it becomes extremely easy to down someone via mindgames and just not respecting pallets. 
---
If you're not going to respect pallets you need a build for that.
---
And if the survivors are even halfway decent, they won't mind being infected. And I have looped Plagues while broken for centuries.
---
None of this was even an argument against her being the worst killer when it comes to pallets and loops. All you did was argue that she isn't totally hopeless against them which was never my position.
---
She's still weaker at loops than Freddy, Trapper, Pig, etc. You never said anything to disprove that
---
Oink
---
Just looked, and all of that is within acceptable fluctuation. It kicks up around Legion's release, and goes back down to now at a similar rate to where it's been.
---
Game is by no means dead, It's still doing better than most of it's run, and I think you need to find a better graph to blame Legion with.
---
Taking the time they‚Äôve been waiting for a change, beside minimum QoL fixes all that Freddy needs is some kind of second ability to help him in the chase, whereas Legion is broken from its very core, whatever you do to him that isn‚Äôt major overhaul is not going to fix the fact that his both weak and utterly unfun to play against
---
I don't know who is the artist but if anyone does please tell me.
---
GROOVY
---
Something that isn't discussed enough is that dull totems only do anything at all if the killer runs one of two perks.  Thrill of the Hunt notifies a survivor when they begin cleansing a totem.  If you have already tested for TotH then cleansing dull totems only helps potentially prevent NOED.  If this really is intended to be a secondary objective for survivors then it should alter gameplay outside if these two perks.
---
I had this happen. I didn't see any reason why it wouldnt let me though. 
---
I rarely try to loop legion, I run away until Legions frenzy ends, and then do my best to leave their line of sight and go back to the gen I was previously on. In my experience they get bored or distracted by another survivor.
---
He could have, but he wanted free views while abused bugs.
---
Amazing, makes me want to play killer and get my chances too ^‚àÜ^  
---
It  would be a blast if this is some kind of leak to a upcoming mode &gt;=]
---
If they think my comment is self righteous because they enjoy farming, then they seriously have issues with there self-esteem.
---
Nope. However it's useful to note though that it slows Survivors' healing rates by 20%. Sloppy Butcher effectively hard-counters Self-Care because the 30% heal rate is slower than the time it takes to open an exit by a significant margin. Stack that up with Coulrophobia or Thanatophobia and Self-Care is even less than useless. 
---
Finally, a balanced game
---
Ok I just started playing this game, what is noed? I know how it's pronounced and stuff but not like what it is.
---
That's a good point yeah.
---
Bubbas power basically consists of around 5 attacks. These attacks come in a set pattern &amp; if a survivor is hit with one of them then they are insta-downed. 
---
The charge has a specific rhythm to it &amp; if a survivor is good enough, they can pallet stun Bubba during his charge. 
---
This is relatively difficult to do as miss timing it can either lead to the survivor being downed through the pallet or having the pallet immediately broken.
---
To avoid this try &amp; time your swings so that when the next swing comes you are in the pallet. This takes some practice but it will eventually feel natural. It forces the survivor to bring the pallet down on top of you &amp; can allow you to break it. 
---
You could respect the pallet. A survivor has to have some serious balls to expect you to respect the pallet &amp; if they do you can resume the charge to break the pallet as the next hit comes in.
---
Leatherface's chainsaw should really only be used if a survivor has left themselves exposed with no near vaulting locations. When you rev your chainsaw you should judge if the survivor can vault within the base 5 seconds of charging the saw. If you see a pallet that the survivor is going to, You could rev the chainsaw behind them &amp; break the pallet as soon as they vault it. This can allow you to have a chance at sawing them after the pallet break.
---
Only use his saw when you are really close to a survivor. I believe you move at the same speed as a survivor when you are charging the saw &amp; slow down after charging it to 100%. I usually wait until I'm within lunging distance before unleashing a chainsaw charge.
---
You should only really use the Saw when the type to rev the saw is faster than the survivors ability to find a vault location &amp; you are close enough you can close the distance. The bubba charge is sadly relatively weak meaning you cannot really use it to mind-game loops  unless you are maybe using his speed add-ons. Even then you maybe mind-game short loops. 
---
In my opinion, his charge speed add-ons are his strongest, with second best being cool-down reduction. A budget bubba add-on list would be the spark plug &amp; primer or Spark plug &amp; vegetable oil. This help make better use of a chainsaw without relying on survivors running in an empty area for more than 5 seconds.
---
When using the saw do not strafe. Only use your mouse &amp; W key. This really helps you not stun yourself on obstacles. The bubba stun animation is horrible as it gives survivors a lot of time to run away from you during it. 
---
The biggest thing about Bubba is to play him like any M1 killer until a survivor is out in the open. Then you can use the chainsaw. The chainsaw should never be used in a jungle gym or in a place like the killer shack unless you are planning on breaking the pallet or you have serious charge add-ons. 
---
The fastest the chainsaw can rev is around 3 seconds I believe.
---
There are variants that could affect it, even if it was predetermined. For instance, when is it ‚Äúdetermined‚Äù for each trap; at the start of the match, or when it‚Äôs placed on the heads of the Survivors? How does it make that determination? And so on
---
Sometimes not as good as vaulting right in to you but sometimes it can trick people into go into an unsafe spot around the loop allowing you to get a hit you normally wouldn't of been able to :)
---
It's called a Karambit. 
---
definitely not. i‚Äôve used it a lot of times and it doesn‚Äôt always work due to killers who can one hit people. i think it has potential but so far it‚Äôs been meh to me
---
I'm just saying there were 2 different experiments that iirc were several hundred traps each that showed similar results that pointed towards it being 50/50 per box instead of a predetermined box 
---
Dude, the only reason they use this bug is not because they want to win but to see the survivors suffer. They said so. They complain so much about how bad killers are treated badly, even after the DS nurf they were like ‚Äúfinally, now remove the hatch and give the killer another slot, also lemme one shot every SWFs‚Äù. It may sound like a joke but at this point they are too toxic to tell if they are serious or not. Literally 90% of the posts are the discussions as to how to be toxic against survivors.
---
I‚Äôve played entire games against legion from the time that the dlc came out until last month. Even the devs have acknowledged that legion is poorly designed and needs a rework. He can keep up with survivors no matter what, assuming he knows how to play the game. 
---
I just dodge any lobbies with more than one Ash. Maybe I'll start bringing in NOED if I notice a good number of non-Ash players using it in my games because MoM really is problematic. Deadass, even Panda hates it and he even never really cared about DS
---
I mean I don‚Äôt know if this is all smiles, but just had the weirdest killer afk farm party. Like why would you put all these hexes and be an afk farming killer? Ruin, Thrill of the Hunt AND NOED? I guess we gotta work for those blood points. Pretty hilarious finding out he had NOED after he put someone in the dying state while we were in the middle of farming heals and someone did the last gen. 
---
Spread the truth brotha
---
I think I just had a stroke watching this 
---
You mean..... when there was an... event? 
---
And on Rank 17
---
I think it was supposed to pair with David Kings other perks and his whole point was to take hits for other survivors. By being injured the whole time he in return could use Dead Hard whenever and then also he had WGLF so he got bonus blood-points for taking hits. So yeah that‚Äôs what I think the reason for no mither was and also if you took a hit and the killer ran after the survivor you where protecting you could then get yourself up.

Unbalanced, as all things should be...
---
I mean, depends on the Killer's connection. If their connection sucks then your connection to their connection gonna suck.
---
Hmmm, 80% of players in a Match are Survivors.  Despite All Statistics showing that Killers have the Advantage, they keep Nerfing Survivors. I can't imagine why potentially annoying 80% of the player base might result in the # of players declining....
---
Because he's taking a comment literally.
---
Welcome to the internet/Reddit.
---
Have you verified the integrity of your game files?
---
Anytime I watch somebody play dbd on YouTube, everybody always shits on others for cleansing dull totems whether they are playing killer or survivor, saying that it's a waste of time. 
---
But at the same time I feel like this subreddit tries to convince that cleansing a dull totem is almost more important than doing a generator (incredibly gross exaggeration I know) because the killer MIGHT have noed and at this point I'm not sure who I should be listening to.
---
Bhvr mostly does shows and film, so Rick has a better chance
---
Killer perk that activates if there‚Äôs an unlit totem on the map when the generators are all powered. An unlit totem gets lit and until it is destroyed, the killer moves 3%/6%/9% faster and all survivors are Exposed (go down in one hit).
---
Some survivor mains feel like it‚Äôs an overpowered perk that can easily turn a shutout into a 2 or 3 kill, which isn‚Äôt entirely wrong.
---
Some killers disagree and think survivors should just cleanse dull totems and run Small Game (helps detect traps/totems). This strat is difficult in practice because there‚Äôs no way of tracking how many dull totems are left ‚Äî so unless you‚Äôre in Discord and everyone is counting off dull totems cleansed, there could always be one more you missed.
---
This conversation has only gotten more strained now that Decisive Strike, the go-to perk that killers complained about, has been reworked to the point that it‚Äôs in line with other survivor perks, if not slightly less useful.
---
What's going on , another 2v3? 
---
No and idk how
---
There could be some really strong combos like doctor getting everyone screaming and hill billy would just chainsaw between everyone.
---
Obviously nothing worth running in your load out or killer mains will say it‚Äôs op.
---
Over Act: When in the wounded state, if the Killer misses an attack you can press the action button to fall to the ground to pretend like you were hit.  If the Killer then tries to pick you up, they get Stunned for 4 seconds.
---
Was finally able to get self care on ash :)
---
We're only allowed to drop the f-bomb one time. This is a family friendly place you know
---
I‚Äôve never used ruin to be honest. I only use Trapper with Agitation, Iron grasp, Brute Strength, and Bloodhound
---
Right click on the game in your steam library and go down to properties. Under the local files tab there should be a button titled ‚Äúverify integrity of game files‚Äù
---
Agreed :)
---
*SCP-096 SPOTTED*
---
I'll try it when I'm home thanks
---
It's a shortening of the killer perk "No-One Escapes Death"  
---
It's a hex-perk that makes it possible for the killer to insta-down survivors when all generators are done, provided there is at least one hex-totem left
---
Bloodhound?
---
I see you are also a man of culture. 
---
Np
---
Exactly what I thought when i saw it haha
---
How do people do this glitch?? Seems like fun!
---
Hex Perks are already quite viable since they are used so frequently. Killers already have the advantage. The last thing they need is more buffs.
---
Lmao I just realized you left a comment in my rep post small world err platform I guess lmao
---
Pallets and windows are kinda the only things survivors have to get away. Imagine trying to run away from a 115 killer while hindered
---
HOW DOES THIS SHIT HAPPEN??
---
I really think a 2 killers mode would be best if the Killers could choose to work together, but also compete. Like, 1 killer *could* screw the other over to get more points or their own sacrifice. 
---
yea, and she couldnt get out of it so she dced pretty quick
---
Oh sacred people of reddit who summon another mailicous being into the realm, give my humble soul an opportunity to taste this amazing feeling
---
I go for the most efficient way. I'm not handicapping myself for some moral high ground. This is not a skill question. I can play without tunnelling if need be, but those games are more tedious than fun for me.
---
It was a DC. Do you know if it‚Äôs a bug?
---
cool
---
Damn I wish I could get this glitch to work haha 
---
Honestly same goes for if the killer has ruin and you are playing with rank 1 survivors, lol.
---
yep. also couldn't mend or wake people up and vice verse. this bug is since Plague chapter
---
Psss they shouldn't know! 
---
Coo
---
Damn, 3 killers in 1 pic
---
If you really wanted to disconnect half the universe, use 4 blink nurse with the green range add-on, ebony, ruin, BBQ, discordance and shadowborn. With the blinks and range, near zero skill is required. Ebony is self explanatory. Spicier if you tunnel off of hooks. Ruin halts early game, their only chance to do much. Discordance solidifies their progression halt. BBQ is self explanatory on Nurse, and shadowborn makes it easier to track after fatigue. GG/EZ 10 IGN would not require any skill to completely slam dunk on survivors again.
---
Co
---
In response to your edit, yeah, that's kind of the point. It's a situational perk, meaning it's strong in its given situation.  
---
It's an anti-slugging perk, much like Unbreakable and Tenacity, punishing the killer for slugging.  
---
I would not call it too strong, however. Hooks are usually within 50 % wiggle range.
---
best one i encountered lately was some dude using a internet cafe and called us salty when we got rekt cuz he was laggin so hard
---
I get way more Bloodpoints with BBQ than Murmut hmmm
---
NOED and camping I agree with, but Ruin is almost a necessity at higher ranks. Gens get done so quickly, often before you even reach it in your patrol
---
Especially for killers that don‚Äôt have any pressure early game and/or need time to set up such as Trapper in particular, or Huntress
---
On killers like Hillbilly who don‚Äôt need help pressuring gens, Ruin is often a little overkill but there‚Äôs little that can be done about that
---
I think about what new killers/survivors they could add and this is the best idea I've heard on the matter. I fully agree with this suggestion. I would play the hell out of the killer if they added the Keeper. 
---
please just upload the video from your system 
---
I meant in terms of finding and chasing survivors.

Dunno bout anyone else but it's coming up on the end of the school year for a lot of us in college/uni here in NA, so people are probably taking breaks in order to finish up their last few weeks. Not a huge deal
---
each fucking time there  is this fucking comment...
---
&gt; Discordance solidifies their progression halt
---
At early game? Survivors should not be working the same gen while Ruin is up
---
Left 4 dead, a game by valve, great game, recommend picking it up. It's the game bill is from .
---
Wait wtf yeah lmao
---
Lol sounds legit
---
Or nea and pig for the ultimate survivor fakeout. 
---
Regardless if it's more fun for the killers, it still ruins the game for survivors especially new players. It might be efficient for you to tunnel someone who just got off a hook but that's why ppl D/C and send hate mail. What's the point in playing survivor when u can't do anything because the killer is too afraid to go after different people and give the survivor a chance to actually play? Also what's the point in continuing to tunnel causing D/C's that just result in even more d/C's throughout the match, ur just wasting ur time.  In my eyes tunnellers and campers will always be the worst part of the community, not only by moral but also because it ruins the game for all survivors who go through it whether they be skilled, new or just casuals.

No teabagging 5/10 not accurate to the game
---
At least some of them I'm pretty sure just wants more time to teabag the killer and waste more time not opening the gates.
---
In their defense it was Legion with Mori, Frank's and Button.
---
I'm pretty sure you can't. It'll show a depip on the emblem screen and show your rank as down a pip on your rank counter in the top right corner, but as soon as you navigate back to the main screen it'll return the pip. At least that's how it is for me.
---
Is there any way to compile a list of it with add-ons as well since her add-ons effect a lot of this? It'd probably just be mostly basic math with a bit of testing to confirm those numbers are accurate 
---
Listen to your heart
---
I give the hatch to people that aren't the best but seem to try to learn to make them want to keep going.
---
Against good team i may give the hatch if i see that they weren't playing with external communication.
---
I like to think of my character as a human with enhanced natural abilities. I use Trapper specifically because one of his masks looks cool.
---
Yeah, but they didn't used to be that bad.
---
Recently, playing Killer has been painful. Sure there's the argument that "Dead by Daylight is 'yadda yadda' sided" but even if it is truly in the Killer's favor that doesn't stop some of the experiences from being rather painful.
---
That's nice. I never even thought of that 
---
You might be right, specifically with the one add-ons(cant think of them rn)
---
better dont
---
if you do then youll probably have to buy some keyboards/controllers in a pack
---
so if anyone asks you for dead by daylight then say "nein nein nein nein"
---
This.
---
Oct till Dec = Drops. Dec = Jan = goes up
---
Feb till early April = Drops. 
---
It's a normal fluctuation. 2 months down, one month up. This game still has more players than a year ago, even more than May.
---
tbf sometimes my connection is completely fine for 3/4 people, but some jackass joins with 900 ping while the 3 others have 50 and then complains to me post game when he didn't dodge the lobby.
---
I can't read the text :/
---
Agreed. Been playing since launch. Jason is supposed to be an OP god. Makes playing as the survivors fun and exciting. But yes everything else above is true. Its a buggy mess.
---
If I have to go against between Plague or Legion. I‚Äôd choose Plague straightaway. End of story.
---
I‚Äôve done a vault Wraith for the lols, I swear you clear windows in .2 or .3 seconds...you are cloaked however.
---
You forgot the loading screen freeze bug
---
Honestly if you are looking for time efficiency it's better to do gens first, then get a 50/50 gamble whether or not someone has noed, and then go look for the hex totem if they do.
---
In a lot of instances, they won't be using it and you won't be wasting a ton of time, since without a counter displayed on your screen it takes a really long time for everyone to check all of the spots if they are not in swf communication.
---
Text isn't really important, just that one guy's name which I highlighted in the second pic. He was saying he's making a video about how broken Legion is and apologized for the overkill.
---
I finally learnt to accept that the reason I'm starting to not like playing dbd anymore is not because I've played so much but that the devs are actively trying to kill the game off.
---
I love the white outline and the glow. Looks amazing
---
oh fuck I didn't even see the rest of the image lol
---
Wow that‚Äôs frustrating

---
I was running no mither, Dead Hard, resilience and unbreakable and the nurse continued to slug me and another guy who just happened to be running it as well. Then I was the last one and they caught me so they dropped me on hatch
---
Man I dunno what you all are talking about, I've had some genuine "Holy shit moments" in F13.
---
Lol.
---
I totally get that, the main problem I have with the whole system is that within 30 seconds of spawing in it's usually gone from my experience and it tends to not be very worth it
---
So you came back after 2 rank resets, played against survivors who you shouldnt have been ranked against because they were clearly worse than you, and nodded at them when you got a down.
---
This is BM and the equivalent of teabagging. 
---
Ever consider that your shitty BM was the reason they DCed and not just because they made a bad play? 
---
This game is tilting as is, no need to salt the wound - especially when playing against babies.
---
Yep, a few days ago this happened to me, lost the game entirely because of it.
---
I‚Äôd replace bamboozle with enduring 
---
ü§´STFU nobody cares this is a gift from god
---
I find it funny so idc lol
---
Yeah I feel stuck to playing only like, the two killers I have learned so far because apparently in DbD it is deep tradition to be assholes to new players or people learning a new killer.
---
It‚Äôs not their fault that Behaviour decided that the killer should be hosting the match.
---
That‚Äôs a healthy woman right there üíµüíµ
---
I know it is.... it has much potential to be great. The keeper would make sense but what would make his power different from hag but still it would be cool.
---
excellent work. make us survivors put in effort and fear you! 
---
Have you only been playing since the Plagues‚Äô release?
---
He says it in a very salty way but most of it is very sadly true.
---
It's a terribly designed perk that shouldn't have been released if we're using the logic the very same devs used to rework DS. The devs stated about DS (paraphrasing): "It penalizes killers for a mistake they didn't make and robs them of momentum". Which is exactly what this perk does, especially if you happen to play Freddy, Clown, Doctor, etc. This is a poorly designed perk if one survivor gains an extra hit and extends a chase for 30 seconds (which good survivors can do). It's WTF bad when multiple survivors can all run the perk in the same trial in combination with Adrenaline and instaheals. It's awful design if the counter to a perk is "don't play half the killers on the roster". 
---
it‚Äôs alright, my advice if you‚Äôre trying to get items with this build is to use luck offering/ extra chest offerings with it to increase your odds of profit :)
---
Alright, it was slightly under two months. One month and 20 days. I just rounded up
---
It's got a second season confirmed.
---
Interesting how you'd clip out the part that supposedly justifies your BM. Clearly the survivor was bad with the failed jukes and waiting at a pallet. Just looks like high rank syndrome, not them trying to be toxic. You, however, were pretty obviously being rude. An eye for an eye I guess. 
---
A rank 1 not playing for two months would be reset from 1 to 10 to 14. So all thats really going on in this clip is you playing against babies and BMing them after an ez down because theyre bad.
---
In homage to the death of his twat krew?
---
Idk I haven't kept up with anything dbd-related for a few weeks other than watching Noob3 and Monto videos on youtube. I thought maybe there would be a wave of new playstyles but nope, still the same cocky survivors that attempt 360's on "low ranked" (rank 12 in this clip btw) killers and expect to get away with it, and proceed by disconnecting in frustration when they fail. Just hilarious honestly
---
They keep creating new slugging perks that are very situational instead of buffing the older ones with a stronger effect. Flip-flop and tenacity should be an all-in-one perk for example.
---
Please please please could you share this with the community, it's so well done :)
---
"Oho! You're approaching me?"
---
"I can't kick your ass without getting closer"
---
&gt; It doesn't reward failure, you will still depip by a big margin
---
This is assuming the killer's goal is to pip. To many people, the goal of the game is to kill as many survivors as possible, or to escape alive. That's what is "on the tin" so to speak, and rank isn't the primary motivator.
---
Honestly, this is why using emblem shenanigans to balance game play is a bad idea. The objective is to kill as many survivors as possible, not '3 hook all survivors and win chases and damage generators and break pallets and ...'.
---
Whispers 1 tho?
---
Say gg and then leave
---
Cope lol. You‚Äôre trying so hard to defend yourself from camping. ‚ÄúIts more efficient to eliminate one survivor‚Äù....yeah its not efficient to stand in front of the survivor on the hook while 3 do generators. You apply no pressure doing that
---
I love it
---
I appreciate that. I‚Äôll consider it 
---
Yeah everyone is thinking of the perk in a vacuum, and not in conjunction with other perks and a half a squad running it. I'm pretty sure people would be up in arms if there was a perk that said "When three generators are completed, another generator will spawn at a random location on the map, increasing the total number of generators to complete in a trial by one."
---
Brown shirt Claudettes are truly the worst teammates to have
---
That shoot bullets!
---
Yeah, unfortunately. Hopefully they get it worked out soon!
---
Since when there two killer for this game? I have not played since the Plague came out as I was playing different game
---
Elsa Jean
---
Turn off chat/ignore the comments is the best way. Then hell forbid when you have a good match they'll nitpick whatever u did however u did it to justify losing... like tunneling, Haha, which is the worst excuse in a video game I've ever heard.
---
OP you get a hurt feelings award for triggering so many survivors lmfao
---
also that DC is gonna make the game much, much harder for the rest of the team and then survivor mains will use their lack of success because of shit like this to whine that killers are too strong
---
This was extremely helpful, thank you!
---
‚ÄúShould‚Äù. I‚Äôve found that this is rarely the actual case though 
---
Lmao he‚Äôs new obviously, get a grip and find something better to do than try to put down new players
---
I think the harbinger would fit in dbd though with his flame thrower as his character power and Laura would be a terrifying killer to go up against but she also has no unique power. 
---
That "No" is just such a genuine reaction to all these bugs as of late
---
What about the killers who do nothing but stand in front of hooks and BM by nodding or hitting? And the killers who tunnel for an entire game? Sadly, I need to disclose that I play both killer and survivor as to not set this SR off on another war but you should still consider the fact that the survivors shouldn't be singled out as having a toxic mentality.
---
Nice. They were all at your rank, too!
---
Ash would honestly kick their asses
---
Mustve been a real.....nightmare....sorry.

iis that actual lagswitch?
---
Aw that is disappointing. Would love for there to be two killers in one game xD 
---
It‚Äôs not even true. He just wanted to make a ‚Äújoke‚Äù on my post and he knew it would puss me off. 
---
Spread the knowledge, that's all you can do. Now with the mega-hard ranking system the potatoes and NOED users should be shifted down into green ranks.
---
~~or play swf like me sometimes lmao~~
---
Head nodding/shaking and hitting people on hook are universally agreed upon to be BM. So Elsewise why would you do it? 
---
Way to try to sidebar with whatever that was lol
---
You "clipped out" the person supposedly teabagging you. You downed a survivor who is clearly bad and then BMed them. So yeah this seems rude and unskilled. I got nothing more to say. 
---
I haven‚Äôt used Surveillance much so I can‚Äôt comment on which is better, but Discordance is definitely useful to have. With Freddy, Doctor, Legion and Plague for example you can find and hit multiple survivors with your power which allows you to apply a bit more pressure. I don‚Äôt run it in every build, but it helps in some - if you lose Ruin early it can slow down gen progression a lot, for example. It‚Äôs also good for getting information, and it‚Äôs really useful against certain SWF groups. 
---
ü§îü§îü§î
---
Best choice is probably a sound cue for when all totems have been cleansed. That way there won't be any awkward looking UI clutter.
---
SHUT UP AND MAKE PETSCOP 2
---
This game really needs a 2 v 8 gamemode with larger maps
---
Clones.
---
I would love this!!
---
And actually I didn‚Äôt unfriend him for what he‚Äôs talking about (which isn‚Äôt even true). I unfriended him because he made this dumb joke and my post was serious. But he just likes ruining everything.
---
didn't this get posted a couple days back? 
---
Why reply with hostility? I‚Äôm just trying to help here. Don‚Äôt attack the person, but the argument.
---
Or nurses.
---
?
---
The only cute Myers lol
---
Nice. I was disappointed ASH didn't have something more. Like a unique strike.
---
It doesn't matter if it's "funny" the aim of it is to be rude to the other party
---
Any killer goes and hooks, Bubba camps. The unbeatable combo.
---
I always do. I hit em with the nice rage quit and they always respond with some salt confirming their rage quit DC
---
how long has this game been out? ive played for about 6 months off and on, and love it when it works but the lingering bugs and connection problems just get ignored.....the game has so much potential in just about every direction yet nothing seems to get fixed 
---
THANK YOU 
---
I've found its pretty good most of the time. Some days it can take up to 15 to fill a lobby, but it doeant happen often in my experience. 
---
**Groovy**
---
You can do 2 killers in a kyf game. It just takes timing to get right but if you really wanted to play a game with 2 killers it's pretty easy to pull off!
---
i don't DC against legion, give me 10, i better see 10s
---
Lol what!?!?!?üòÇüòÇ
---
Inspect the body. Might give you an idea as to which Killer it is. 
---
Its been pretty solid for me OP.
---
Depends on how many Teachables you actually have. You certainly have a higher chance if you don't have many Teachables but it's far from guaranteed. I remember back in the day with Trapper when he was just a pre-prestige Lad, I didn't get Agitation III until almost Level 35 with no Teachables unlocked. His journey through P3 a lot more recently was an absolute nightmare given how many perks I've unlocked since then. 
---
How about saboteur also affect totem cleaning speed by like 25% and also give you a token counter of how many totems are left? 
---
The three around the edges are phantasms, the one licking her fingers in the middle is the real hag. The survivor triggered 3 traps (or possibly 4, if the hag teleported to one to make the hit), and then the hag hit and downed her while the phantasms were still up.
---
Damn Coldwind...
---
A perfect game. Bravo. (No sarcasm here) 
---
Oof. Freddy Basement too...
---
Feng is anime gamer
---
almost like Joy from Payday 2
---
Trapper: "If I tunnel you, will you die?"
---
Ash: "It would be extremely painful."
---
Trapper: "You're a big guy."
---
Ash: "For you." *rushes out exit gates after getting hit 3 times.*
---
Industry standard missing textures. 
---
Gamer isn‚Äôt a personality. Anime? Isn‚Äôt that Japanese? I *was* like 100% sure she was Chinese. One of us is racist here and it‚Äôs probably me.
---
Pure post. Must be protected at all costs!
---
Or a cut of one of Freddy's shirts...
---
What‚Äôs up with Michael‚Äôs pants ;)
---
Where'd you get nervous from for feng? Her personality seems much more like a "Focused and out for themselves" based off their backstory and survivor quote thing.
---
Please never post again
---
You didn't ask me to tell you what her personality is?? I just pointed out that you did list a personality for her, so it's clearly not NO personality.
---
I haven't read her lore, but her perks suggest to me that she is perceptive/skilled with technology (alert/technician). I never read their lore and just get their personality from their perks/mannerisms.
---
She is nervous of disappointing her friends and family. Also her fans.
---
It is in the way, isn't it? Modeler must have accidentally forgotten to leave them on...
---
Yeah I'm not sure either. It was at the beginning of the game too
---
Get unhooked by a person with Borrowed Time, 1 hit, get downed out of Borrowed Time, 2 hits, as you're getting picked up, Divisive Strike, run away, get downed, 3 hits, before the killer can pick you up, Adrenaline, Adrenaline into instaheal, get hit, 4 hits, get hit again but Mettle Of Man activates, 5 hits, finally get downed, 6 hits.
---
Yea, this games filled with low life morons like that.
---
Do killers even mind being teabagged by her?
---
Basically she is a gamer girl, parents are disappointed, she goes out to video game tournaments, she gets wasted and turns into an absolute ass. Gets taken by the Entity because even it knows she has no purpose in life. Tbh I thought I asked you lol. Maybe I should change my post to say, ‚Äúhas no good traits,‚Äù instead of no personality. I rather be boring than a piece of shit but you do you man.
---
A separate thing is that you can't see feng being anything but "cute" but Kate's is "Innocent and Pure"? That's much less character than being ambitious and nervous to me.
---
I didn't think about that. What do you think would be a good substitute for the FoV gains with Monitor &amp; Abuse.
---
Just pictured that creepy old guy with the dollar from the geico commercial..
---
"You gotta be quicker than that!" 
---
why arent the survivors saying 'gg ez' and 'baby killer' to freddy?
---
earlier, i hit a survivor once who was afk and then left him alone and the cunt still had the cheek to stand at teabag and point at the exit gate
---
This Does Put A Smile On My Face
---
Omfg üòÇ I remember that shit. 
---
I mean, I‚Äôm a Survivor main and I love when the Killers headbang. It looks hilarious. Especially ‚ÄòBilly.
---
The aim of it isn‚Äôt always to BM. The reason we‚Äôre in this ‚Äòeverything is toxic‚Äô mess is because everyone perceived everything as toxic. Not only that, but even if people are intentionally trying to be toxic (such as teabagging), people let it get to them so much. Like, oh no, a Dwight is crouching and uncrouching repeatedly at the open exit gates! Better make a big stink of it! 
---
Anyone can play nurse with that many blinks. 
---
Yeah you lose everything.
---
You gain bloody clothes and face each time you prestige.
---
I only did it for the trophies.
---
Happened to me twice as Jane.  Perma No Mither rest of match 
---
Well look, I said cute because it seems like the devs want her to be like that. See Bunny Feng. I personally don‚Äôt like Kate but she probably has some of the most interesting lore imaginable. Imma edit her to Fighter and pure because that‚Äôs what she is. Would you rather have a person that is just drunk gamer girl or a character that is the only person to remember the Entity grabbing hem AND the only one to fight back? Kate is a bad character but she is basically dbd‚Äôs final girl like Laurie or that one girl from the original Friday the 13th movies whose name I totally remember.
---
As a former killer main, no.
---
This post is just a reminder to tell you its 2019 - Selfcare was meta two years ago. 
---
It's not worth spending 40 seconds to heal yourself anymore, just let that perk go.
---
Ha lol i think huntress is actually pretty fast
---
Yes indeed now 16 
---
Hahahah! Hahahah! HAHAHAHAHA!!!
---
:)
---
/r/dbdLFG
---
I mean it's ok on xbox I've been running into a lot of face camping at lower ranks but other than that its not bad. 
---
yes and no.  the idea of others healing you can be an issue too, as it takes two away from gens.  the best rule is do fucking gens - period.
---
red paint brush is a must try addon. It can to super fun matches
---
I think that is more then one tick. Anyway, I don't think you should care about ranking up in this game. There is no benefit or anything to it. As someone who mostly play killer I am actually hoping I lost rank after every match, since killer on high ranks is just not fun. Or survivor I don't care. I just play for fun, and I think so should you. Never get frustrated at not ranking up.
---
Yes, you lose everything but gain bloody clothing and a small chance at rarer stuff on bloodweb. I'll just get every teachable perk you want unlocked first then prestige a character that you want as your "main" .
---
Loop is 110% movement speed ass for 5 minutes while the other survivors mend. Then when the legion detects that the other survivors are on generators, he can go and stab them once, buying him another 5 minutes of fucking around. 
---
It‚Äôs 100% a bug - you can‚Äôt convince me a killers power is meant to waste MINUTES at a time without counterplay. That‚Äôs inane and you know it
---
Real talk: how could Pig be reworked to be much less rng based without a major overhaul?
---
Yup. Shame it‚Äôs so rare, though. I usually just play without add ons when I don‚Äôt have red paint brush. Still get 3-4 kills because it‚Äôs only mid tier ranks

Dance with me or Hope cooldown stops you using Head On.

Do a gen, do a chase, do a totem... Pip. Having 2 bronzes and complaining you didn‚Äôt pip is a little... mesmerizing.

generally VPNs just go with one IP, so it shouldn't be "bouncing the signal all over the world", it would just be an IP some place else.  Not all VPNs are equal, either.

most players.

DCface.
---
When you save three people and do four gens, then die and de-pip for it. 
---
Outstanding move 
---
I haven't even attempted to get Adept David because of this perk lol.
---
Imagine being this much of a sensitive pussy. Lmfao. You are either 15 years old or have the mental makeup of a 15 year old. Anyways. You're a mentally weak dumbass. Which is probably why you haven't amounted to anything. Well. Good luck with having peaked in highschool and shit.

---
What does the old DS and tunneling have anything to do with each other ?
---
I have a great time. Matches are mostly easy to find. A bit harder in the morning, especially for killer, but otherwise fine.
---
I thought self care was still useful in solo play? 
---
So far, my most successful build for No MIther has been combining it with Premonition, Lightweight, and Resilience. Depending on how bold I'm feeling, I'll switch out Lightweight with TINH.
---
Interesting, very interesting.
---
if you were a kid that grew up on call of duty, then toxicity is normal to you, yeah, but to the rest of us being a douche is unnecessary and unwanted
---
Yea
---
Can‚Äôt really think of anything that fits the theme without overlapping with doc‚Äôs power/add-ons but they could make the terror radius when in/out of chase change gradually instead of immediately.
---
Yes, Dance With Me is on a separate cooldown from exhaustion.
---
Based on the feedback here clearly not. 
---
When he‚Äôs calling for you
---
Ahh, It‚Äôs good to see PS4‚Äôs still consistent
---
I need a closer look I don't see it lol
---
Ok I‚Äôll try again this screenshot is to show the Line and where the Pips are... I‚Äôm not trying to show how dumb the game is and I should‚Äôve pipped that game (which I know I shouldn‚Äôt) I GET IT BRO 
---
Lol I always thought it would be funny to farm the lobby until the generators are done than wreck the whole team with NOED when their guard is down. Everytime we get a friendly killer I'm like "watch him be the one...."
---
Big meaty claws
---
You're still silent going in with Iron Maiden, it's the going out where you scream.
---
My comment was posted before a lot of the comments condemning them for it. I thought everyone had just glossed over it. Also, it's not just an issue with this post, you always see killers complaining about toxic survivors yet I rarely get a game where a killer doesn't nod at me when they down me just because I played the game right and looped. Instead of just, you know, running to pallets like I'm brain-dead and throwing them all down. Or even if I never encountered them until the end of the game and get downed when the exit gates are powered, they camp me, which is okay to secure a kill I guess, but they always come up right to my face and look up at me, smack me, or nod their head. Killers are just as toxic as survivors are. 
---
Oh fuck, the game is full of immature children now the last thing it needs is more
---
People know where the pips are... Your post was complaining about the new system which was made harder because it was far to easy. Now people have to ACTUALLY do shit to rank up lol. Jesus I posted a match where I dicked around let all 4 people go and I still 1piped as killer. If you weren‚Äôt trying to suggest you ‚Äúshould have pipped‚Äù why would you even say it needs to be reverted üòÇ, you clearly shouldn‚Äôt be rewarded for not playing well.
---
Dude Ive been looking for his shoes for a while now. They're dope!
---
Right because my resume is connected to my reddit account haha 
---
Oh really? Thanks, did not know that
---
If you want improvement with the current perks you have, switch unrelenting and deerstalker with huntress lullaby and iron grasp. If you want a better perk build overall, I highly suggest you get hex ruin, bbq and nurse's calling. Hex ruin will massively help you slow the game down(just a little bit), bbq will give you a lot of bloodpoints and show you where survivors are and what they're doing and nurses calling will show you survivors healing so that you can capitalize on them. These 3 perks work very well especially with huntress(since you are playing her). The 4th perk is up to you but you can pick sloppy butcher for longer heals, pairs well with nurses calling or whispers for tracking since huntress sucks at that
---
funny how no one notices bing bong boi in the background XD
---
At that point might as well lump together Bond and Locker-stun perks together... no... you don't mash together 2 perks that have nothing to do with each other.
---
There's even less of a reason to give a shit about ranked now.
---
This is stunning, I adore your art style!!
---
Artist: null\_erste ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/null_erste?lang=en))
---
Self care isn't meta(since the healing changes), but it's probably the most used survivor perk(in my experience anyway). Pretty much every survivor I play with or come up against uses it. I personally use it because I can't rely on my team to heal me since, well, sometimes they aren't there to heal me. I do acknowledge however that sometimes you should not heal yourself and crank out gens instead, and I do that 
---
Thank you.
---
&gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt DC after finding out it's a Legion
---
FTFY
---
I mean at this point rank is even more meaningless now so why even try?
---
it's console I'm not surprised
---
Hell yeah! I was just making a joke but that's so good that you actually double pipped. I havent been able to do it without farming
---
My thoughts exactly. Now wr just have to decide how many generators. 
---
ET haul ass! 
---
Didn't think you spoke for the whole  subreddit lmao
---
I was going for the trophy and I was about to give up on it when this happened lol

---
Yes, Feng is Chinese.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
Thank jeebus it wasn‚Äôt me.

Yes because he‚Äôs playing legion he can‚Äôt play huntress /s
